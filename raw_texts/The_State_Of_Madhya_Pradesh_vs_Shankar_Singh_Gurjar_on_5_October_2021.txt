This judgment shall govern the disposal of Criminal Appeal No. 625/2009
(Raghuveer Savita Vs. State of MP), Criminal Appeal No. 713/2009 (Shailendra

2. Appellant-Raghuveer Savita and appellant-Shailendra Sharma @ Sonu have preferred appeals
under Section 374 of CrPC, against the judgment of conviction and sentence dated 7.9.2009 passed
by Special Judge (MPDVPK Act) Morena (MP) in Special Case No.91/2006 (Dacoity), whereby
Raghuveer Savita (appellant in Cri.Appeal No.625/2009) and Shailendra Sharma (appellant in
Cri.Appeal No.713/2009) have been convicted under Sections 120-B, 364(A)/34 of IPC, Section 13
of MPDVPK Act, Section 302/34 of IPC and under Section 201 read with Section 34 of IPC and each

Surendra Singh S/o Shankar Singh Gurjar and Kampoter Singh Gurjar @ Pappu S/o Ramjilal, who
were acquitted by the same judgment.
3. The prosecution story in short is that on 23.6.2006 at around 7 pm the complainant Moharman
Lal lodged the missing report of his grand son Shubham @ Shailu S/o Neeraj Sharma, aged around
10 years and has stated that his grand son Shubham @ Shailu went to the Variety Public School, Pati
Gali, Morena for tuition. When Shubham not returned back at around 1.00 pm then he was
searched to all the relevant places. His teacher told him that Shubham @ Shailu conveyed him that
he was going to learn skating. That missing report was lodged and search was started. Till 1.7.2006
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7977056/ 2
The State Of Madhya Pradesh vs Shankar Singh Gurjar on 5 October, 2021
the missing child was not traced, hence, FIR under Section 365 of IPC was lodged in Crime
No.450/2006. On 7.7.2006 information was given telephonically to the police that from the house of
Shankar Singh Gurjar which was locked from the outside, foul smell was coming out. Hence, police
reached the spot and opened the house. There the body of the deceased boy was found in a plastic
bag and it was kept over the shelf of lavatory and wall was constructed to hide the body of the
deceased. The brick wall made was broken and body was recovered. Postmortem of the deceased
was done wherein the doctor had opined that the cause of death was strangulation. The statements
of prosecution witnesses were recorded wherein the prosecution witnesses Ramkrishan, Bajrangi,
Bafatan, Ameena, Sonu Sharma, Ranjeeta had given evidence with regard to last seen theory and
had stated that they had seen 15-16 days back the deceased Shubham along with two boys residents
of first floor of the building. The dead body was identified by the prosecution witnesses. The accused
Raghuveer and Shailendra Sharma were arrested. After completion of investigation, charge sheet
was filed against the appellants/accused.
4. It is also found during investigation that the accused persons were knowing the grand father of
the deceased got retired from police department thereby he had received retiral benefits of Rs. 3 to 4
Lacs. Therefore, the accused/appellants planned to get ransom and they abducted the deceased.
5. The trial Court framed charges under Sections 120, 364-A/120-B read with Section 13 of
MPDVPK Act, in alternative under Sections 364-A/149 of IPC read with Section 13 of MPDVPK Act,
under Section 302 read with Section 149 of IPC, in alternative under Section 302 read with Section
120-B of IPC and under Section 201 read with Section 149 of IPC. Appellants abjured their guilt and
stated under Section 313 Cr.P.C. that they are innocent. They have not committed any offence. No
defence witness was produced. After marshalling the evidence available on record, the trial Court
has convicted and sentenced the appellants as under :-
Name of Section Punishment Fine In default, accused punishment Raghuveer 120-B
of 14 years RI 500/- Three Savita IPC months additional RI 364-A/34 Life Imprison-

6. The grounds raised in this appeal are that in the missing report there was no mention of
commission of offence by the appellants, despite of it, convicting the appellants are erroneous.
There is no direct or indirect involvement of the appellants. The evidence of Moharman Lal (PW/1),
Bafatan (PW/2), Ameena (PW/3), Sonu (PW/4), Bajarangi (PW/5), Ramdeen (PW/6) and Niraj
Sharma (PW/7) are inconsistent and lots of discrepancies are there. The prosecution story is
unnatural. There is no any evidence against the present appellants. The present case is the case of no
evidence. The appellants have not committed any offence. There was no pre-mediation or pre-
meeting of mind. There is no eyewitness in the case. The entire prosecution story is based on mere
surmises and conjunctures wherein the present appellants have been roped up. The dead body was
recovered from the house of Shankar Singh Gurjar which was locked from outside. As per the
postmortem report the deceased was strangulated, but there is no any evidence of committing the
aforesaid act by the appellants.
7. It is also submitted by the learned counsel for the appellants that Neeraj Sharma (PW/7) is the
father of the deceased whose statement was recorded on 27.11.2007. However, in his entire
statement he has not disclosed the name of the present appellants who have participated in the
alleged commission of murder. Rather he has admitted that there was no enmity between him and
Sonu @ Shailendra Sharma. There is no any ingredient of Section 364-A of IPC. Therefore, Section
364-A of IPC is not made out. Similarly, Section 11/13 of MPDVPK Act is also not made out as the
prosecution is lacking of ingredients of aforesaid Sections. The appellants have been roped in this
case only on the basis of hearsay evidence. There is no complete chain of circumstantial evidence
against the appellants. Hence, prayed to allow the appeals.
8. Per Contra, learned State Counsel opposed the submissions and submitted that the prosecution
has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and there is sufficient evidence against the appellants.
There is specific chain is made out of circumstantial evidence and the scientific evidence also
corroborates the prosecution evidence. Hence, prayed for rejection of the Criminal Appeal
No.625/2009 and Criminal Appeal No.713/2009 filed by the appellants Raghuveer Savita and
Shailendra Sharma. It is further contended that the trial Court has erred in acquitting the accused
Shankar Singh Gurjar, Surendra Singh and Kampoter Singh Gurjar @ Pappu. It is further submitted
that Shankar Singh Gurjar, Surendra Singh and Kampoter Singh Gurjar @ Pappu were also the part
of conspiracy. Hence, they have committed the alleged offence in furtherance of common object
whereby they inserted the bundle of thread used for candle preparation in the mouth of deceased
Shubham whereby the case is also proved against Shankar Singh Gurjar, Surendra Singh and
Kampoter Singh Gurjar. Hence, prayed to allow the appeal filed by the State being Criminal Appeal
No.1046/2014.

9. Heard the learned counsel for the rival parties and perused the record.
10. In the present case, the following question emerges for consideration :
"(i) Whether the death of Shubham @ Shailu is an unnatural death and comes within
the purview of culpable homicide that amounts to murder ?
(ii) Whether the deceased Shubham @ Shailu aged around 10 years was abducted on
23.06.2006?
(iii) Whether the deceased Shubham @ Shailu was abducted to get the ransom and
thereafter accused/appellants murdered him?
(iv) Whether the accused/appellants had caused disappearance of evidence by hiding
the dead body of deceased in a lavatory shelf and closed the shelf by constructing
brick wall?
(v) Whether the aforesaid act was done in furtherance of common object?
11. Before considering the merits of the case, it would be appropriate to throw light on relevant
provisions of Sections 299 and 300 of Indian Penal Code.
12. The Law Commission of United Kingdom in its 11th Report proposed the following test :
"The standard test of 'knowledge' is, Did the person whose conduct is in issue, either
knows of the relevant circumstances or has no substantial doubt of their existence?"
[See Text Book of Criminal Law by Glanville Wiliams (p.125)] "Therefore, having regard to the
meaning assigned in criminal law the word "knowledge" occurring in clause Secondly of Section 300
IPC imports some kind of certainty and not merely a probability. Consequently, it cannot be held
that the appellant caused the injury with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the appellant
knew to be likely to cause the death of Shri Ahirwar. So, clause Secondly of Section 300 IPC will also
not apply."
13. The enquiry is then limited to the question whether the offence is covered by clause Thirdly of
Section 300 IPC. This clause, namely, clause Thirdly of Section 300 IPC reads as under: -
"Culpable homicide is murder, if the act by which the death is caused is done with the
intention of causing bodily injury to any person and the bodily injury intended to be
inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death."
The argument that the accused had no intention to cause death is wholly fallacious for judging the
scope of clause Thirdly of Section 300 IPC as the words "intention of causing death" occur in clause
Firstly and not in clause Thirdly. An offence would still fall within clause Thirdly even though the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7977056/ 5
The State Of Madhya Pradesh vs Shankar Singh Gurjar on 5 October, 2021
offender did not intend to cause death so long as the death ensues from the intentional bodily injury
and the injuries are sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature. This is also borne out
from illustration
(c) to Section 300 IPC which is being reproduced below: -
"(c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-
wound sufficient to cause the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature. Z dies in consequence.
Here A is guilty of murder, although he may not have intended to cause Z's death."
Therefore, the contention advanced in the present case and which is frequently advanced that the
accused had no intention of causing death is wholly irrelevant for deciding whether the case falls in
clause Thirdly of Section 300 IPC.
14. The scope and ambit of clause Thirdly of Section 300 IPC was considered in the decision in Virsa
Singh vs. State of Punjab, [AIR 1958 SC 465], and the principle enunciated therein explains the legal
position succinctly. The accused Virsa Singh was alleged to have given a single spear blow and the
injury sustained by the deceased was "a punctured wound 2" x =" transverse in direction on the left
side of the abdominal wall in the lower part of the iliac region just above the inguinal canal. Three
coils of intestines were coming out of the wound." After analysis of the clause Thirdly, it was held: -
"The prosecution must prove the following facts before it can bring a case under S.
300 "Thirdly"; First, it must establish, quite objectively, that a bodily injury is
present; Secondly, the nature of the injury must be proved. These are purely objective
investigations. Thirdly, it must be proved that there was an intention to inflict that
particular bodily injury, that is to say, that it was not accidental or unintentional, or
that some other kind of injury was intended.
Once these three elements are proved to be present, the enquiry proceeds further
and, Fourthly, it must be proved that the injury of the type, just described, made up
of the three elements set out above, is sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course
of nature. This part of the enquiry is purely objective and inferential and has nothing
to do with the intention of the offender. Once these four elements are established by
the prosecution (and, of course, the burden is on the prosecution throughout), the
offence is murder under S. 300 "Thirdly". It does not matter that there was no
intention to cause death, or that there was no intention even to cause an injury of a
kind that is sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature (there is no real
distinction between the two), or even that there is no knowledge that an act of that
kind will be likely to cause death. Once the intention to cause the bodily injury
actually found to be present is proved, the rest of the enquiry is purely objective and
the only question is whether, as a matter of purely objective inference, the injury is
sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death."

15. In Arun Nivalaji More vs. State of Maharashtra (Case No. Appeal (Cri.) 1078-1079 of 2005), it
has been observed as under :-
"11. First it has to be seen whether the offence falls within the ambit of Section 299
IPC. If the offence falls under Section 299 IPC, a further enquiry has to be made
whether it falls in any of the clauses, namely, clauses 'Firstly' to 'Fourthly' of Section
300 IPC. If the offence falls in any one of these clauses, it will be murder as defined in
Section 300IPC, which will be punishable under Section 302 IPC. The offence may
fall in any one of the four clauses of Section 300 IPC yet if it is covered by any one of
the five exceptions mentioned therein, the culpable homicide committed by the
offender would not be murder and the offender would not be liable for conviction
under Section 302 IPC. A plain reading of Section 299 IPC will show that it contains
three clauses, in two clauses it is the intention of the offender which is relevant and is
the dominant factor and in the third clause the knowledge of the offender which is
relevant and is the dominant factor. Analyzing Section 299 as aforesaid, it becomes
clear that a person commits culpable homicide if the act by which the death is caused
is done
(i) with the intention of causing death;
or
(ii) with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death; or
(iii) with the knowledge that the act is likely to cause death."
If the offence is such which is covered by any one of the clauses enumerated above, but does not fall
within the ambit of clauses Firstly to Fourthly of Section 300 IPC, it will not be murder and the
offender would not be liable to be convicted under Section 302 IPC. In such a case if the offence is
such which is covered by clauses (i) or (ii) mentioned above, the offender would be liable to be
convicted under Section 304 Part I IPC as it uses the expression "if the act by which the death is
caused is done with the intention of causing death, or of causing such bodily injury as is likely to
cause death"
where intention is the dominant factor. However, if the offence is such which is
covered by clause (iii) mentioned above, the offender would be liable to be convicted
under Section 304 Part II IPC because of the use of the expression "if the act is done
with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death, but without any intention to cause
death, or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death" where knowledge is
the dominant factor.
12. What is required to be considered here is whether the offence committed by the
appellant falls within any of the clauses of Section 300 IPC.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7977056/ 7
The State Of Madhya Pradesh vs Shankar Singh Gurjar on 5 October, 2021
13. Having regard to the facts of the case it can legitimately be urged that clauses
Firstly and Fourthly of Section 300 IPC were not attracted. The expression "the
offender knows to be likely to cause death" occurring in clause Secondly of Section
300 IPC lays emphasis on knowledge. The dictionary meaning of the word
'knowledge' is the fact or condition of being cognizant, conscious or aware of
something; to be assured or being acquainted with. In the context of criminal law the
meaning of the word in Black's Law Dictionary is as under: -
"An awareness or understanding of a fact or circumstances; a state of mind in which a
person has no substantial doubt about the existence of a fact. It is necessary ... to
distinguish between producing a result intentionally and producing it knowingly.
Intention and knowledge commonly go together, for he who intends a result usually
knows that it will follow, and he who knows the consequences of his act usually
intends them. But there may be intention without knowledge, the consequence being
desired but not foreknown as certain or even probable. Conversely, there may be
knowledge without intention, the consequence being foreknown as the inevitable
concomitant of that which is desired, but being itself an object of repugnance rather
than desire, and therefore not intended."
In Blackstone's Criminal Practice the import of the word 'knowledge' has been described as under: -
"'Knowledge' can be seen in many ways as playing the same role in relation to
circumstances as intention plays in relation to consequences. One knows something
if one is absolutely sure that it is so although, unlike intention, it is of no relevance
whether one wants or desires the thing to be so. Since it is difficult ever to be
absolutely certain of anything, it has to be accepted that a person who feels 'virtually
certain' about something can equally be regarded as knowing it."
16. Section 299 of Indian Penal Code runs as under :-
"299. Culpable homicide.-- Wheoever causes death by doing an act with the intention
of causing death, or with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to
cause death, or with the knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death,
commits the offence of culpable homicide."
17. Section 299 of IPC says, whoever causes death by doing an act with the bodily injury as is likely
to cause death, or with the knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death, commits the
offence of culpable homicide. Culpable homicide is the first kind of unlawful homicide. It is the
causing of death by doing :
(i) an act with the intention of causing death;
(ii) an act with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death;
or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7977056/ 8
The State Of Madhya Pradesh vs Shankar Singh Gurjar on 5 October, 2021
(iii) an act with the knowledge that it is was likely to cause death.
Without one of these elements, an act, though it may be by its nature criminal and may occasion
death, will not amount to the offence of culpable homicide. 'Intent and knowledge' as the ingredients
of Section 299 postulate, the existence of a positive mental attitude and the mental condition is the
special mens rea necessary for the offence. The knowledge of third condition contemplates
knowledge of the likelihood of the death of the person. Culpable homicide is of two kinds : one,
culpable homicide amounting to murder, and another, culpable homicide not amounting to murder.
In the scheme of the Indian Penal Code, culpable homicide is genus and murder is species. All
murders are culpable homicide, but not vice versa. Generally speaking, culpable homicide sans the
special characteristics of murder is culpable homicide not amounting to murder. In this section,
both the expressions 'intent' and 'knowledge' postulate the existence of a positive mental attitude
which is of different degrees.
18. Section 300 of Indian Penal Code runs as under :-
"300. Murder.-- Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is
murder, if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing
death, or--
Secondly.-- If it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the
offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the person to whom the harm is
caused, or--
Thirdly.-- If it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person and
the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature
to cause death, or--
Fourthly.-- If the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous
that it must, in all probability, cause death or such bodily injury as is likely to cause
death, and commits such act without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing
death or such injury as aforesaid."
19. 'Culpable Homicide' is the first kind of unlawful homicide. It is the causding of death by doing ;
(i) an act with the intention to cause death; (ii) an act with the intention of causing such bodily
injury as is likely to cause death; or, (iii) an act with the knowledge that it was likely to cause death.
20. Indian Penal Code reconizes two kinds of homicides :
(1) Culpable homicide, dealt with between Sections 299 and 304 of IPC (2)
Not-culpable homicide, dealt with by Section 304-A of IPC. There are two kinds of
culpable homicide; (i) Culpable homicide amounting to murder (Section 300 read
with Section 302 of IPC), and (ii) Culpable homicide not amounting to murder
(Section 304 of IPC).

21. A bare perusal of the section makes it crystal clear that the first and the second clauses of the
section refer to intention apart from the knowledge and the third clause refers to knowledge alone
and not the intention. Both the expression "intent" and "knowledge" postulate the existence of a
positive mental attitude which is of different degrees. The mental element in culpable homicide i.e.,
mental attitude towards the consequences of conduct is one of intention and knowledge. If that is
caused in any of the aforesaid three circumstances, the offence of culpable homicide is said to have
been committed.
22. There are three species of mens rea in culpable homicide. (1) An intention to cause death; (2) An
intention to cause a dangerous injury; (3) Knowledge that death is likely to happen.
23. The fact that the death of a human being is caused is not enough unless one of the mental staes
mentioned in ingredient of the Section is present. An act is said to cause death results either from
the act directly or results from some consequences necessarily or naturally flowing from such act
and reasonably contemplated as its result. Nature of offence does not only depend upon the location
of injury by the accused, this intention is to be gathered from all facts and circumstances of the case.
If injury is on the vital part, i.e., chest or head, according to medical evidence this injury proved
fatal. It is relevant to mention here that intention is question of fact which is to be gathered from the
act of the party. Along with the aforesaid, ingredient of Section 300 of IPC are also required to be
fulfilled for commission of offence of murder.
24. In the scheme of Indian Penal Code, "Culpable homicide" is genus and "murder" is its specie. All
"Murder" is "culpable homicide" but not vice versa. Speaking generally 'culpable homicide sans
special characteristics of murder' if culpable homicide is not amounting to murder.
25. In Anda vs. State of Rajasthan [1966 CrLJ 171), while considering "third" clause of Section 300
of IPC, it has been observed as follows :-
"It speaks of an intention to cause bodily injury which is sufficient in the ordinary
course of nature to cause death. The emphasis here is on sufficiency of injury in the
ordinary course of nature to cause death. The sufficiency is the high probability of
death in the ordinary way of nature and when this exists and death ensues and
causing of such injury was intended, the offence is murder. Sometimes the nature of
the weapon used, sometimes the part of the body on which the injury is caused, and
sometimes both are relevant. The determinant factor is the intentional injury which
must be sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature."
26. In Mahesh Balmiki vs. State of M.P. [(2000) 1 SCC 319, while deciding whether a single blow
with a knife on the chest of the deceased would attract Section 302 of IPC, it has been held thus :-
"There is no principle that in all cases of single blow Section 302 I.P.C. is not
attracted. Single blow may, in some cases, entail conviction under Section 302 I.P.C.,
in some cases under Section 304 I.P.C and in some other cases under Section 326
I.P.C. The question with regard to the nature of offence has to be determined on the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7977056/ 10
The State Of Madhya Pradesh vs Shankar Singh Gurjar on 5 October, 2021
facts and in the circumstances of each case. The nature of the injury, whether it is on
the vital or non-vital part of the body, the weapon used, the circumstances in which
the injury is caused and the manner in which the injury is inflicted are all relevant
factors which may go to determine the required intention or knowledge of the
offender and the offence committed by him. In the instant case, the deceased was
disabled from saving himself because he was held by the associates of the appellant
who inflicted though a single yet a fatal blow of the description noted above. These
facts clearly establish that the appellant had intention to kill the deceased. In any
event, he can safely be attributed knowledge that the knife blow given by him is so
imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause death or such bodily injury
as is likely to cause death."
27. In Dhirajbhai Gorakhbhai Nayak vs. State of Gujarat [(2003) 9 SCC 322, it has been observed as
under :-
"The Fourth Exception of Section 300, IPC covers acts done in a sudden fight. The
said exception deals with a case of prosecution not covered by the first exception,
after which its place would have been more appropriate. The exception is founded
upon the same principle, for in both there is absence of premeditation. But, while in
the case of Exception 1 there is total deprivation of self-control, in case of Exception
4, there is only that heat of passion which clouds men's sober reason and urges them
to deeds which they would not otherwise do. There is provocation in Exception 4 as
in Exception 1; but the injury done is not the direct consequence of that provocation.
In fact Exception 4 deals with cases in which notwithstanding that a blow may have
been struck, or some provocation given in the origin of the dispute or in whatever
way the quarrel may have originated, yet the subsequent conduct of both parties puts
them in respect of guilt upon equal footing. A 'sudden fight' implies mutual
provocation and blows on each side. The homicide committed is then clearly not
traceable to unilateral provocation, nor in such cases could the whole blame be
placed on one side. For if it were so, the Exception more appropriately applicable
would be Exception 1. There is no previous deliberation or determination to fight. A
fight suddenly takes place, for which both parties are more or less to be blamed. It
may be that one of them starts it, but if the other had not aggravated it by his own
conduct it would not have taken the serious turn it did. There is then mutual
provocation and aggravation, and it is difficult to apportion the share of blame which
attaches to each fighter. The help of Exception 4 can be invoked if death is caused (a)
without premeditation, (b) in a sudden fight; (c) without the offender's having taken
undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner; and (d) the fight must have
been with the person killed. To bring a case within Exception 4 all the ingredients
mentioned in it must be found. It is to be noted that the 'fight' occurring in Exception
4 to Section 300, IPC is not defined in the IPC. It takes two to make a fight. Heat of
passion requires that there must be no time for the passions to cool down and in this
case, the parties have worked themselves into a fury on account of the verbal
altercation in the beginning. A fight is a combat between two and more persons

The State Of Madhya Pradesh vs Shankar Singh Gurjar on 5 October, 2021
whether with or without weapons. It is not possible to enunciate any general rule as
to what shall be deemed to be a sudden quarrel. It is a question of fact and whether a
quarrel is sudden or not must necessarily depend upon the proved facts of each case.
For the application of Exception 4, it is not sufficient to show that there was a sudden
quarrel and there was no premeditation. It must further be shown that the offender
has not taken undue advantage or acted in cruel or unusual manner. The expression
'undue advantage' as used in the provision means 'unfair advantage'.
28. In Pulicherla Nagaraju @ Nagaraja vs. State of AP [(2006) 11 SCC 444, while deciding whether a
case falls under Section 302 or 304 Part-I or 304 Part-II, IPC, it was held thus :-
"Therefore, the court should proceed to decide the pivotal question of intention, with
care and caution, as that will decide whether the case falls under Section 302 or 304
Part I or 304 Part II. Many petty or insignificant matters plucking of a fruit, straying
of a cattle, quarrel of children, utterance of a rude word or even an objectionable
glance, may lead to altercations and group clashes culminating in deaths. Usual
motives like revenge, greed, jealousy or suspicion may be totally absent in such cases.
There may be no intention. There may be no pre-meditation. In fact, there may not
even be criminality. At the other end of the spectrum, there may be cases of murder
where the accused attempts to avoid the penalty for murder by attempting to put
forth a case that there was no intention to cause death. It is for the courts to ensure
that the cases of murder punishable under section 302, are not converted into
offences punishable under section 304 Part I/II, or cases of culpable homicide not
amounting to murder, are treated as murder punishable under section 302. The
intention to cause death can be gathered generally from a combination of a few or
several of the following, among other, circumstances : (i) nature of the weapon used;
(ii) whether the weapon was carried by the accused or was picked up from the spot;
(iii) whether the blow is aimed at a vital part of the body; (iv) the amount of force
employed in causing injury; (v) whether the act was in the course of sudden quarrel
or sudden fight or free for all fight; (vi) whether the incident occurs by chance or
whether there was any pre- meditation; (vii) whether there was any prior enmity or
whether the deceased was a stranger; (viii) whether there was any grave and sudden
provocation, and if so, the cause for such provocation; (ix) whether it was in the heat
of passion; (x) whether the person inflicting the injury has taken undue advantage or
has acted in a cruel and unusual manner; (xi) whether the accused dealt a single blow
or several blows. The above list of circumstances is, of course, not exhaustive and
there may be several other special circumstances with reference to individual cases
which may throw light on the question of intention. Be that as it may."
29. In Sangapagu Anjaiah v. State of A.P. (2010) 9 SCC 799, Hon'ble Apex Court while deciding the
question whether a blow on the skull of the deceased with a crowbar would attract Section 302 IPC,
held thus:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7977056/ 12
The State Of Madhya Pradesh vs Shankar Singh Gurjar on 5 October, 2021
"16. In our opinion, as nobody can enter into the mind of the accused, his intention
has to be gathered from the weapon used, the part of the body chosen for the assault
and the nature of the injuries caused. Here, the appellant had chosen a crowbar as
the weapon of offence. He has further chosen a vital part of the body i.e. the head for
causing the injury which had caused multiple fractures of skull. This clearly shows
the force with which the appellant had used the weapon. The cumulative effect of all
these factors irresistibly leads to one and the only conclusion that the appellant
intended to cause death of the deceased."
30. In State of Rajasthan v. Kanhaiyalal (2019) 5 SCC 639, this it has been held as follows:
"7.3 In Arun Raj [Arun Raj v.
Union of India, (2010) 6 SCC 457 : (2010) 3 SCC (Cri) 155] this Court observed and
held that there is no fixed rule that whenever a single blow is inflicted, Section 302
would not be attracted. It is observed and held by this Court in the aforesaid decision
that nature of weapon used and vital part of the body where blow was struck, prove
beyond reasonable doubt the intention of the accused to cause death of the deceased.
It is further observed and held by this Court that once these ingredients are proved, it
is irrelevant whether there was a single blow struck or multiple blows.
7.4 In Ashokkumar Magabhai Vankar [Ashokkumar Magabhai Vankar v. State of Gujarat , (2011) 10
SCC 604 : (2012) 1 SCC (Cri) 397] , the death was caused by single blow on head of the deceased
with a wooden pestle. It was found that the accused used pestle with such force that head of the
deceased was broken into pieces. This Court considered whether the case would fall under Section
302 or Exception 4 to Section 300 IPC. It is held by this Court that the injury sustained by the
deceased, not only exhibits intention of the accused in causing death of victim, but also knowledge
of the accused in that regard. It is further observed by this Court that such attack could be none
other than for causing death of victim. It is observed that any reasonable person, with any stretch of
imagination can come to conclusion that such injury on such a vital part of the body, with such a
weapon, would cause death.
7.5 A similar view is taken by this Court in the recent decision in Leela Ram (supra) and after
considering catena of decisions of this Court on the issue on hand i.e. in case of a single blow,
whether case falls under Section 302 or Section 304 Part I or Section 304 Part II, this Court
reversed the judgment and convicted the accused for the offence under Section 302 IPC. In the same
decision, this Court also considered Exception 4 of Section 300 IPC and observed in para 21 as
under: (SCC para 21) "21. Under Exception 4, culpable homicide is not murder if the stipulations
contained in that provision are fulfilled. They are: (i) that the act was committed without
premeditation;
(ii) that there was a sudden fight; (iii) the act must be in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel;
and (iv) the offender should not have taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual
manner."

The State Of Madhya Pradesh vs Shankar Singh Gurjar on 5 October, 2021
31. In the case of Bavisetti Kameswara Rao v. State of A.P. (2008) 15 SCC 725 , it is observed in
paragraphs 13 and 14 as under:
"13. It is seen that where in the murder case there is only a single injury, there is
always a tendency to advance an argument that the offence would invariably be
covered under Section 304 Part II IPC. The nature of offence where there is a single
injury could not be decided merely on the basis of the single injury and thus in a
mechanical fashion. The nature of the offence would certainly depend upon the other
attendant circumstances which would help the court to find out definitely about the
intention on the part of the accused. Such attendant circumstances could be very
many, they being (i) whether the act was premeditated; (ii) the nature of weapon
used; (iii) the nature of assault on the accused. This is certainly not an exhaustive list
and every case has to necessarily depend upon the evidence available. As regards the
user of screwdriver, the learned counsel urged that it was only an accidental use on
the spur of the moment and, therefore, there could be no intention to either cause
death or cause such bodily injury as would be sufficient to cause death. Merely
because the screwdriver was a usual tool used by the accused in his business, it could
not be as if its user would be innocuous.
14. In State of Karnataka v. Vedanayagam [(1995) 1 SCC 326 : 1995 SCC (Cri) 231]
this Court considered the usual argument of a single injury not being sufficient to
invite a conviction under Section 302 IPC. In that case the injury was caused by a
knife. The medical evidence supported the version of the prosecution that the injury
was sufficient, in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. The High Court had
convicted the accused for the offence under Section 304 Part II IPC relying on the
fact that there is only a single injury. However, after a detailed discussion regarding
the nature of injury, the part of the body chosen by the accused to inflict the same
and other attendant circumstances and after discussing clause Thirdly of Section 300
IPC and further relying on the decision in Virsa Singh vs. State of Punjab [AIR 1958
SC 465] , the Court set aside the acquittal under Section 302 IPC and convicted the
accused for that offence. The Court (in Vedanayagam case [(1995) 1 SCC 326 : 1995
SCC (Cri) 231] , SCC p. 330, para 4) relied on the observation by Bose, J. in Virsa
Singh case [AIR 1958 SC 465] to suggest that: (Virsa Singh case [AIR 1958 SC 465],
AIR p. 468, para 16) "16. With due respect to the learned Judge he has linked up the
intent required with the seriousness of the injury, and that, as we have shown, is not
what the section requires. The two matters are quite separate and distinct, though the
evidence about them may sometimes overlap."
The further observation in the above case were:
(Virsa Singh case [AIR 1958 SC 465] , AIR p. 468, paras 16 & 17) "16. The question is
not whether the prisoner intended to inflict a serious injury or a trivial one but
whether he intended to inflict the injury that is proved to be present. If he can show
that he did not, or if the totality of the circumstances justify such an inference, then,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7977056/ 14
The State Of Madhya Pradesh vs Shankar Singh Gurjar on 5 October, 2021
of course, the intent that the section requires is not proved. But if there is nothing
beyond the injury and the fact that the appellant inflicted it, the only possible
inference is that he intended to inflict it. Whether he knew of its seriousness, or
intended serious consequences, is neither here nor there.
The question, so far as the intention is concerned, is not whether he intended to kill, or to inflict an
injury of a particular degree of seriousness, but whether he intended to inflict the injury in question;
and once the existence of the injury is proved the intention to cause it will be presumed unless the
evidence or the circumstances warrant an opposite conclusion. But whether the intention is there or
not is one of fact and not one of law. Whether the wound is serious or otherwise, and if serious, how
serious, is a totally separate and distinct question and has nothing to do with the question whether
the prisoner intended to inflict the injury in question.
17. ... It is true that in a given case the enquiry may be linked up with the seriousness of the injury.
For example, if it can be proved, or if the totality of the circumstances justify an inference, that the
prisoner only intended a superficial scratch and that by accident his victim stumbled and fell on the
sword or spear that was used, then of course the offence is not murder. But that is not because the
prisoner did not intend the injury that he intended to inflict to be as serious as it turned out to be
but because he did not intend to inflict the injury in question at all. His intention in such a case
would be to inflict a totally different injury. The difference is not one of law but one of fact."
32. Section 364(A) of Indian Penal Code runs as under :-
"364A.-- Kidnapping for ransom, etc.-- Whoever kidnaps or abducts any person or
keeps a person in detention after such kidnapping or abduction and threatens to
cause death or hurt to such person, or by his conduct gives rise to a reasonable
apprehension that such person may be put to death or hurt, or causes hurt or death to
such person in order to compel the Government or any foreign State or international
inter- governmental organisation or any other person to do or abstain from doing any
act or to pay a ransom, shall be punishable with death, or imprisonment for life, and
shall also be liable to fine."
33. Section 365 of Indian Penal Code runs as under :-
"365. Kidnapping or abducting with intent secretly and wrongfully to confine
person.-- Whoever kidnaps or abducts any person with intent to cause that person to
be secretly and wrongfully confined, shall be punished with imprisonment of either
description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to
fine."
34. It is relevant to point out that Section 364A of IPC had been introduced in the Indian Penal Code
by virtue of Amendment Act 42 of 1993. The Statement of Objects and Reasons are as follows :-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7977056/ 15
The State Of Madhya Pradesh vs Shankar Singh Gurjar on 5 October, 2021
"Statement of Objects and Reasons.-- Kidnapping by terrorists for ransom, for
creating panic amongst the people and for securing release of arrested associates and
cadres have assumed serious dimensions. The existing provisions of law have proved
to be inadequate as deterrence. The Law Commission in its 42 nd Report has also
recommended a specific provision to deal with this menace. It was necessary to
amend the Indian Penal Code to provide for deterrent punishment to persons
committing such acts and to make consequential amendments to the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973."
35. While considering the facts of the present case, it would be appropriate to deal with the relevant
provisions along with the dictum of various Courts.
36. Section 364(A) of IPC is attracted and a person/accused is convicted only if the prosecution
proves following ingredients :-
(i) the accused must have kidnapped, abducted or detained any person;
(ii) he must have kept such person in custody or detention; and,
(iii) kidnapping, abduction or detention must have been for ransom. To pay a
ransom, in the ordinary sense means to pay the price or demand for ransom. This
would show that the demand has to be communicated.
37. In Omprakash Shrivastava vs. State [2007 CrLJ 696 (Del), it is observed that to establish a
charge of kidnapping for ransom a demand for ransom has to be made and it should be properly
communicated not only to the third person but also to the victim himself. It was held that this plea
will not be entertained that ransom demand was made to the complainant/victim himself and not to
any other person.
38. Hon'ble Apex Court in Shaik Ahmed vs. State of Telangana (Criminal Appeal No. 533 of 2021,
decided on 28 th June, 2021), has observed as under :-
"7. From the submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties and materials
on record, following questions arise for consideration in this appeal:-
I. What are the essential ingredients of Section 346A to be proved beyond reasonable
doubt by the prosecution for securing the conviction of an accused under Section
364A IPC?
II. Whether each and every ingredient as mentioned under Section 364A needs to be
proved for securing conviction under Section 364A and non-establishment of any of
the conditions may vitiate the conviction under Section 364A IPC? III. Whether the
learned Sessions Judge as well as the High Court recorded any finding that all
ingredients of Section 364A were proved by the prosecution? IV. Whether there was
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7977056/ 16
The State Of Madhya Pradesh vs Shankar Singh Gurjar on 5 October, 2021
any evidence or findings by the Courts below that the accused had threatened to
cause death or hurt to the victim or by his conduct gave rise to a reasonable
apprehension that victim may be put to death or hurt?
8. The appeal having arisen out of order of conviction under Section 364A, we need
to notice the provisions of Section 364A IPC before proceeding further to consider
the points for consideration.
9. Sections 359 to 374 of the Indian Penal Code are contained in the heading "of
Kidnapping, Abduction, Slavery and Forced Labour". Offence of Kidnapping for
lawful guardianship is defined under Section 361 and Section 363 provides for
punishment for kidnapping. Section 364 deals with kidnapping or abduction in order
to murder.
10. The Law Commission of India took up the revision of Indian Penal Code and
submitted its report, i.e., 42nd Report (June, 1971). In Chapter 16, offences affecting
the human body was dealt with.
The chapter on kidnapping and abduction was dealt by the Commission in paragraphs 16.91 to
16.112. Section 364 and 364A was dealt by the Commission in paragraphs 16.99 to 16.100 which are
as follows:-
"16.99. Section 364 punishes the offence of kidnapping or abduction of a person in
order to murder him, the maximum punishment being imprisonment for life or for
ten years. In view of our general recommendation as to imprisonment for life, we
propose that life imprisonment should be omitted and term imprisonment increased
to 14 years.
The illustrations to the section do not elucidate any particular ingredient of the
offence and should be omitted.
16.100. We consider it desirable to have a specific section to punish severely
kidnapping or abduction for ransom, as such cases are increasing. At present, such
kidnapping or abduction is punishable under section 365 since the kidnapped or
abducted person will be secretly and wrongfully confined.
We also considered the question whether a provision for reduced punishment in case
of release of the person kidnapped without harm should be inserted, but we have
come to the conclusion that there is no need for it. We propose the following section:-
"364A. Kidnapping or abduction for ransom .--Whoever kidnaps or abducts any
person with intent to hold that person for ransom shall be punished with rigorous
imprison- ment for a term which may extend to 14 years, and shall also be liable to
fine."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7977056/ 17
The State Of Madhya Pradesh vs Shankar Singh Gurjar on 5 October, 2021
11. Although the Law Commission has in paragraph 16.100 proposed Section 364A, which only
stated that whoever kidnaps or abducts any person with intent to hold that person for ransom be
punished for a term which may extend to 14 years. Parliament while inserting Section 364A by Act
No.42 of 1993 enacted the provision in a broader manner also to include kidnapping and abduction
to compel the Government to do or abstain from doing any act or to pay a ransom which was further
amended and amplified by Act No.24 of 1995. Section 364A as it exists after amendment is as
follows:-
"364A. Kidnapping for ransom, etc.
--Whoever kidnaps or abducts any person or keeps a person in detention after such
kidnapping or abduction and threatens to cause death or hurt to such person, or by
his conduct gives rise to a reasonable apprehension that such person may be put to
death or hurt, or causes hurt or death to such person in order to compel the
Government or any foreign State or international inter- governmental organisation or
any other person to do or abstain from doing any act or to pay a ransom, shall be 12
punishable with death, or imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to fine."
12. We may now look into section 364A to find out as to what ingredients the Section itself
contemplate for the offence. When we paraphrase Section 364A following is deciphered:-
(i) "Whoever kidnaps or abducts any person or keeps a person in detention after such
kidnapping or abduction"
(ii) "and threatens to cause death or hurt to such person, or by his conduct gives rise
to a reasonable apprehension that such person may be put to death or hurt,
(iii) or causes hurt or death to such person in order to compel the Government or any
foreign State or international inter-
governmental organisation or any other person to do or abstain from doing any act or to pay a
ransom"
(iv) "shall be punishable with death, or imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable
to fine."
13. The first essential condition as incorporated in Section 364A is "whoever kidnaps or abducts any
person or keeps a person in detention after such kidnapping or abduction". The second condition
begins with conjunction "and". The second condition has also two parts, i.e., (a) threatens to cause
death or hurt to such person or (b) by his conduct gives rise to a reasonable apprehension that such
person may be put to death or hurt. Either part of above condition, if fulfilled, shall fulfill the second
condition for offence. The third condition begins with the word "or", i.e., or causes hurt or death to
such person in order to compel the Government or any foreign State or international
inter-governmental organisation or any other person to do or abstain from doing any act or to pay a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7977056/ 18
The State Of Madhya Pradesh vs Shankar Singh Gurjar on 5 October, 2021
ransom. Third condition begins with the word "or causes hurt or death to such person in order to
compel the Government or any foreign state to do or abstain from doing any act or to pay a ransom".
Section 364A contains a heading "kidnapping for ransom, etc." The kidnapping by a person to
demand ransom is fully covered by Section 364A.
14. We have noticed that after the first condition the second condition is joined by conjunction
"and", thus, whoever kidnaps or abducts any person or keeps a person in detention after such
kidnapping or abduction and threatens to cause death or hurt to such person.
15. The use of conjunction "and" has its purpose and object. Section 364A uses the word "or" nine
times and the whole section contains only one conjunction "and", which joins the first and second
condition. Thus, for covering an offence under Section 364A, apart from fulfillment of first
condition, the second condition, i.e., "and threatens to cause death or hurt to such person" also
needs to be proved in case the case is not covered by subsequent clauses joined by "or".
16. The word "and" is used as conjunction. The use of word "or" is clearly distinctive. Both the words
have been used for different purpose and object. Crawford on Interpretation of Law while dealing
with the subject "disjunctive" and "conjunctive" words with regard to criminal statute made
following statement:-
"..........................The Court should be extremely reluctant in a criminal statute to
substitute disjunctive words for cojunctive words, and vice versa, if such action
adversely affects the accused."
17. We may also notice certain judgments of this court where conjunction "and" has been used. In
Punjab Produce and Trading Co. Ltd. Vs. The CIT, West Bengal, Calcutta (1971) 2 SCC 540, this
Court had occasion to consider Section 23-A Explanation b(iii) of Income Tax Act, 1922 which
provision has been extracted in paragraph 5 of the judgment which is to the following effect:-
"Explanation. -- For the purposes of this section a company shall be deemed to be a
company in which the public are substantially interested--
(a) If it is a company owned by the Government or in which not less than forty per
cent of the shares are held by the Government. (b) If it is not a private company as
defined in the Indian Companies Act, 1913 (7 of 1913) and--
(i) its shares (not being shares entitled to a fixed rate of dividend, whether with or
without a further right to participate in profits) carrying not less than fifty per cent of
the voting power have been allotted unconditionally to, or acquired unconditionally
by, and were throughout the previous year beneficially held by the public (not
including a company to which the provisions of this section apply):
Provided that in the case of any such company as is referred to in sub-section (4), this
sub-clause shall apply as if for the words 'not less than fifty per cent' the words 'not
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7977056/ 19
The State Of Madhya Pradesh vs Shankar Singh Gurjar on 5 October, 2021
less than forty per cent', had been substituted;
(ii) the said shares were at any time during the previous year the subject of dealing in
any recognised stock exchange in India or were freely transferable by the holder to
other members of the public; and
(iii) the affairs of the company or the shares carrying more than fifty per cent of the
total voting power were at no time during the previous year controlled or held by less
than six persons (persons who are related to one another as husband, wife, lineal
ascendant or descendant or brother or sister, as the case may be, being treated as a
single person and persons who are nominees of another person together with that
other person being likewise treated as a single person:
Provided that in the case of any such company as is referred to in sub-section (4), this
clause shall apply as if for the words 'more than fifty per cent', the words 'more than
sixty per cent', had been substituted."
18. This Court held following in paragraph 8:-
"8. ........................The clear import of the opening part of clause (b) with the word
"and" appearing there read with the negative or disqualifying conditions in
sub-clause (b)
(iii) is that the assessee was bound to satisfy apart from the conditions contained in
the other subclauses that its affairs were at no time during the previous year
controlled by less than six persons and shares carrying more than 50 per cent of the
total voting power were during the same period not held by less than six
persons............................"
19. In another judgment, Hyderabad Asbestos Cement Products and Anr. Vs. Union of India, (2000)
1 SCC 426, this Court had occasion to consider Rule 56-A of Central Excise Act, 1944. The Court
dealt with interpretation of conjunctive and disjunctive "and", "or". Proviso to Rule 56-A also uses
the conjunctive word "and". The Provision of the Rule as quoted in paragraph 4 is as below:-
"56-A. Special procedure for movement of duty-paid materials or component parts
for 18 use in the manufacture of finished excisable goods.--(1) Notwithstanding
anything contained in these rules, the Central Government may, by notification in the
Official Gazette, specify the excisable goods in respect of which the procedure laid
down in sub-rule (2) shall apply. (2) The Collector may, on application made in this
behalf and subject to the conditions mentioned in sub-rule (3) and such other
conditions as may, from time to time, be prescribed by the Central Government,
permit a manufacturer of any excisable goods specified under sub-rule (1) to receive
material or component parts or finished products (like asbestos cement), on which
the duty of excise or the additional duty under Section 2-A of the Indian Tariff Act,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7977056/ 20
The State Of Madhya Pradesh vs Shankar Singh Gurjar on 5 October, 2021
1934 (32 of 1934), (hereinafter referred to as the countervailing duty), has been paid,
in his factory for the manufacture of these goods or for the more convenient
distribution of finished product and allow a credit of the duty already paid on such
material or component parts or finished product, as the case may be:
Provided that no credit of duty shall be allowed in respect of any material or
component parts used in the manufacture of finished excisable goods--
(i) if such finished excisable goods produced by the manufacturer are exempt from
the whole of the duty of excise leviable thereon or are chargeable to nil rate of duty,
and
(ii) unless--
(a) duty has been paid for such material or component parts under the same item or
sub-item as the finished excisable goods; or
(b) remission or adjustment of duty paid for such material or component parts has
been specifically sanctioned by the Central Government:
Provided further that if the duty paid on such material or component parts (of which
credit has been allowed under this sub-rule) be varied subsequently due to any
reason, resulting in payment of refund to, or recovery of more duty from, the
manufacturer or importer, as the case may be, of such material or component parts,
the credit allowed shall be varied accordingly by adjustment in the credit account
maintained under sub-rule (3) or in the accountcurrent maintained under sub- rule
(3) or Rule 9 or Rule 178(1) or, if such adjustment be not possible for any reason, by
cash recovery from or, as the case may be, refund to the manufacturer availing of the
procedure contained in this rule."
20. This court held that when the provisos 1 & 2 are separated by conjunctive word "and", they have
to be read conjointly. The requirement of both the proviso has to be satisfied to avail the benefit.
Paragraph 8 is as follows:-
"8. The language of the rule is plain and simple. It does not admit of any doubt in
interpretation. Provisos (i) and (ii) are separated by the use of the conjunction "and".
They have to be read conjointly. The requirement of both the provisos has to be satisfied to avail the
benefit. Clauses (a) and
(b) of proviso (ii) are separated by the use of an "or" and there the availability of one of the two
alternatives would suffice. Inasmuch as cement and asbestos fibre used by the appellants in the
manufacture of their finished excisable goods are liable to duty under different tariff items, the
benefit of pro forma credit extended by Rule 56-A cannot be availed of by the appellants and has
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7977056/ 21
The State Of Madhya Pradesh vs Shankar Singh Gurjar on 5 October, 2021
been rightly denied by the authorities of the Department."
21. Thus, applying the above principle of interpretation on condition Nos. 1 & 2 of Section 364A
which is added with conjunction "and", we are of the view that condition No.2 has also to be fulfilled
before ingredients of Section 364A are found to be established. Section 364A also indicates that in
case the condition "and threatens to cause death or hurt to such person" is not proved, there are
other classes which begins with word "or", those conditions, if proved, the offence will be
established. The second condition, thus, as noted above is divided in two parts- (a) and threatens to
cause death or hurt to such person or (b) by his conduct gives rise to a reasonable apprehension that
such person may be put to death or hurt.
22. Now, we may look into few cases of this Court where different ingredients of Section 364A came
for consideration. We may first notice the judgment of this Court in Malleshi Vs. State of Karnataka,
(2004) 8 SCC 95. The above was a case where kidnapping of a major boy was made by the accused
for ransom and before this Court argument was raised that demand of ransom has not been
established. In the above case, the Court referred to Section 364A and in paragraph 12 following was
observed:-
"12. To attract the provisions of Section 364-A what is required to be proved is: (1)
that the accused kidnapped or abducted the person; (2) kept him under detention
after such kidnapping and abduction; and (3) that the kidnapping or abduction was
for ransom. Strong reliance was placed on a decision of the Delhi High Court in Netra
Pal v. State (NCT of Delhi) [2001 Cri LJ 1669 (Del)] to contend that since the ransom
demand was not conveyed to the father of PW 2, the intention to demand was not
fulfilled."
23. This court in paragraphs 13 to 15 dealt with demand for ransom and held that demand originally
was made to person abducted and the mere fact that after making the demand the same could not be
conveyed to some other person as the accused was arrested in meantime does not take away the
effect of conditions of Section 364A. In the above case, this Court was merely concerned with
ransom, hence, other conditions of Section 364A were not noticed.
24. The next judgment is Anil alias Raju Namdev Patil Vs. Administration of Daman & Diu, Daman
and Another, (2006) 13 SCC 36. In the above case, this Court noticed the ingredients for
commission of offence under Section 364 and 364A. Following was laid down in paragraph 55:-
"55. ...........................for obtaining a conviction for commission of an offence under
Section 364-A thereof it is necessary to prove that not only such kidnapping or
abetment has taken place but thereafter the accused threatened to cause death or
hurt to such person or by his conduct gives rise to a reasonable apprehension that
such person may be put to death or hurt or causes hurt or death to such person in
order to compel the Government or any foreign State or international
intergovernmental organi- sation or any other person to do or abstain from doing any
act or to pay a ransom."

The State Of Madhya Pradesh vs Shankar Singh Gurjar on 5 October, 2021
25. At this stage, we may also notice the judgment of this Court in Suman Sood alias Kamaljeet Kaur
Vs. State of Rajasthan (2007) 5 SCC 634. In the above case, Suman Sood and her husband Daya
Singh Lahoria were accused in the case of abduction. They were tried for offence under Section
364A, 365, 343 read with Section 120-B and 346 read with Section 120-B. The trial court convicted
the appellant for offence under Sections 365 read with 120-B, 343 read with 120-B and 346 read
with 120- B. She was, however, acquitted for offence punishable under Section 364-A. Her challenge
against conviction and sentence for offences punishable under Sections 365 read with 120- B, 343
read with 120-B and 346 read with 120-B IPC was negatived by the High Court. But her acquittal for
offences punishable under Sections 364-A read with 120-B was set aside by the High Court in an
appeal and she was also convicted for the offence under Section 364A and was sentenced to life
imprisonment. In the appeal filed by her challenging her conviction under Section 364A, this Court
dealt with acquittal of Suman Sood under Section 364A by trial Court. In Paragraph 64 this court
noticed as follows:-
"64. According to the trial court, the prosecution had failed to prove charges against
Suman Sood for an offence punishable under Sections 364-A or 364-A read with
120-B IPC "beyond reasonable doubt" inasmuch as no reliable evidence had been
placed on record from which it could be said to have been established that Suman
Sood was also a part of "pressurise tactics" or had terrorised the victim or his family
members to get Devendra Pal Singh Bhullar released in lieu of Rajendra Mirdha. The
trial court, therefore, held that she was entitled to benefit of doubt."
26. The findings of trial court that no reliable evidence had been placed on record from which it
could be said to have been established that Suman Sood was also a part of pressurise tactics or has
terrorized the victim or his family. This court approved the acquittal of Suman Sood by trial court
and set aside the order of the High Court convicting Suman Sood. In paragraph 71 following was
held by this Court:-
"71. On the facts and in the circumstances in its entirety and considering the evidence
as a whole, it cannot be said that by acquitting Suman Sood for offences punishable
under Sections 364-A read with 120-B IPC, the trial court had acted illegally or
unlawfully. The High Court, therefore, ought not to have set aside the finding of
acquittal of accused Suman Sood for an offence under Sections 364-A read with
120-B IPC. To that extent, therefore, the order of conviction and sentence recorded
by the High Court deserves to be set aside."
27. Thus, the trial court's findings that there was no evidence that Suman Sood was part of
pressurize tactics or terrorized the victim or his family members, hence, due to non-fulfillment of
the condition as enumerated in Section 364A, the trial court recorded the acquittal, which has been
confirmed by this Court. The above case clearly establishes that unless all conditions as enumerated
in Section 364A are fulfilled, no conviction can be recorded.
28. Now, we come to next judgment, i.e., Vishwanath Gupta Vs. State of Uttaranchal (2007) 11 SCC
633. In the above case, the victims were abducted from district of Lucknow, State of U.P. demands
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7977056/ 23
The State Of Madhya Pradesh vs Shankar Singh Gurjar on 5 October, 2021
for ransom and threat was extended from another district, i.e., Nainital and the victim was done to
death in another district, i.e., Unnao in the State of U.P. This Court had occasion to consider the
ingredients of Section 364A and in paragraphs 8 and 9, the following was laid down:-
"8. According to Section 364-A, whoever kidnaps or abducts any person and keeps
him in detention and threatens to cause death or hurt to such person and by his
conduct gives rise to a reasonable apprehension that such person may be put to death
or hurt, and claims a ransom and if death is caused then in that case the accused can
be punished with death or imprisonment for life and also liable to pay fine.
9. The important ingredient of Section 364-A is the abduction or kidnapping, as the
case may be. Thereafter, a threat to the kidnapped/abducted that if the demand for
ransom is not met then the victim is likely to be put to death and in the event death is
caused, the offence of Section 364-A is complete. There are three stages in this
section, one is the kidnapping or abduction, second is threat of death coupled with
the demand of money and lastly when the demand is not met, then causing death. If
the three ingredients are available, that will constitute the offence under Section 364-
A of the Penal Code. Any of the three ingredients can take place at one place or at
different places. In the present case the demand of the money with the threat
perception had been made at (Haldwani) Nainital. The deceased were kidnapped at
Lucknow and they were put to death at Unnao. Therefore, the first offence was
committed by the accused when they abducted Ravi Varshney and Anoop Samant at
Lucknow. Therefore, Lucknow court could have territorial jurisdiction to try the
case."
29. This Court in the above case, laid down that there are three stages in the Section, one is
kidnapping or abduction, second is threat of death coupled with demand of money and third when
the demand is not met, then causing death. The Court held that if the three ingredients are available
that will constitute the offence under Section 364 of the IPC. Dealing with Section 364A in context of
above case, following was laid down in paragraph 17:-
"17. ...............But here, in the case of Section 364-A something more is there, that is,
that a person was abducted from Lucknow and demand has been raised at Haldwani,
Nainital with threat. If the amount is not paid to the abductor then the victim is likely
to be put to death. In order to constitute an offence under Section 364-A, all the
ingredients have not taken place at Lucknow or Unnao. The two incidents took place
in the State of Uttar Pradesh, that is, abduction and death of the victims but one of
the ingredient took place, that is, threat was given at the house of the victims at
Haldwani, Nainital demanding the ransom money otherwise the victim will be put to
death. Therefore, one of the ingredients has taken place within the territorial
jurisdiction of Haldwani, Nainital. Therefore, it is a case wherein the offence has
taken place at three places i.e. at Haldwani, Nainital, where the threat to the life of
the victim was given and demand of money was raised, the victim was abducted from
Lucknow and he was ultimately put to death at Unnao. ......................"

The State Of Madhya Pradesh vs Shankar Singh Gurjar on 5 October, 2021
30. Next case which needs to be noticed is a Three Judge Bench Judgment of this Court in Vikram
Singh alias Vicky and Anr. Vs. Union of India and Ors., (2015) 9 SCC 502. In the above case, this
Court elaborately considered the scope and purport of Section 364A including the historical
background. After noticing the earlier cases, this Court laid down that section 364A has three
distinct components. In Paragraph 25, following was laid down with regard to distinct components
of Section 364A:-
"25. ................Section 364-A IPC has three distinct components viz. (i) the person
concerned kidnaps or abducts or keeps the victim in detention after kidnapping or
abduction; (ii) threatens to cause death or hurt or causes apprehension of death or
hurt or actually hurts or causes death; and (iii) the kidnapping, abduction or
detention and the threats of death or hurt, apprehension for such death or hurt or
actual death or hurt is caused to coerce the person concerned or someone else to do
something or to forbear from doing something or to pay ransom ........................"
31. We may also notice one more Three Judge Bench Judgment of this Court in Arvind Singh Vs.
State of Maharashtra, (2020) SCC Online SC 400. In the above case, an eight year old son of Doctor
Mukesh Ramanlal Chandak (PW1) was kidnapped by the accused A1 and A2. Accused A1 was an
employee of Dr. Chandak. It was held that A1 had grievance against Dr. Chandak. A2 who
accompanied A1 when the boy was kidnapped and after the kidnapping of the boy it was found that
boy was murdered and at the instance of A1, the dead body was recovered from a bridge constructed
over a Rivulet. Trial court had sentenced both A1 and A2 to death for the offences punishable under
Sections 364A read with 34 and 302 read with 34. The High Court had dismissed the appeal
affirming the death sentence. On behalf of A2, one of the arguments raised before this Court was
that although child was kidnapped for ransom but there was no intention to take the life of the child,
therefore, offence under Section 364A is not made out. This Court noticed the ingredients of Section
364A, one of which was "threatening to cause death or hurt" in paragraphs 90, 91 and 92, the
following was observed:-
"90. An argument was raised that the child was kidnapped for ransom but there was
no intention to take life of the child, therefore, an offence under Section 364A is not
made out. To appreciate the arguments, Section 364A of the IPC is reproduced as
under:
"364A. Kidnapping for ransom, etc.
-- Whoever kidnaps or abducts any person or keeps a person in detention after such
kidnapping or abduction and threatens to cause death or hurt to such person, or by
his conduct gives rise to a reasonable apprehension that such person may be put to
death or hurt, or causes hurt or death to such person in order to compel the
Government or any foreign State or international intergovernmental organisation or
any other person to do or abstain from doing any act or to pay a ransom, shall be
punishable with death, or imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to fine."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7977056/ 25
The State Of Madhya Pradesh vs Shankar Singh Gurjar on 5 October, 2021
91. Section 364A IPC has three ingredients relevant to the present appeals, one, the fact of
kidnapping or abduction, second, threatening to cause death or hurt, and last, the conduct giving
rise to reasonable apprehension that such person may be put to death or hurt.
92. The kidnapping of an 8-year-old child was unequivocally for ransom. The kidnapping of a victim
of such a tender age for ransom has inherent threat to cause death as that alone will force the
relatives of such victim to pay ransom.
Since the act of kidnapping of a child for ransom has inherent threat to cause death, therefore, the
accused have been rightly been convicted for an offence under Section 364A read with Section 34
IPC.
The threat will remain a mere threat, if the victim returns unhurt. In the present case, the victim has
been done to death. The threat had become a reality. There is no reason to take different view that
the view taken by learned Sessions Judge as well by the High Court."
32. We need to refer to observations made by Three Judge Bench in paragraph 92 where this Court
observed that kidnapping of an eight year old victim for ransom has inherent threat to cause death
as it alone will force the relatives of victim to pay ransom. The Court further held that since the act
of kidnapping of a child has inherent threat to cause death, therefore, the accused have been rightly
convicted for an offence under Section 364A read with Section 34 IPC. In the next sentence, the
Court held that the threat will remain a mere threat, if the victim returns unhurt, "the victim has
been done to death the threat has become a reality". The above observation made by Three Judge
Bench has to be read in context of the facts of the case which was for consideration before this Court.
No ratio has been laid down in paragraph 92 that when an eight year old child (or a child of a tender
age) is kidnapped/abducted for ransom there is inherent threat to cause death and the second
condition as noted above, i.e., threatens to cause death or hurt to such person, is not to be proved.
The observations cannot be read to mean that in a case of kidnapping or abduction of an eight year
old child (or child of a tender age), presumption in law shall arise that kidnapping or abduction has
been done to cause hurt or death. Each case has to be decided on its own facts. In the foregoing
paragraphs, we have noticed that all the three distinct conditions enumerated in Section 364A have
to be fulfilled before an accused is convicted of offence under Section 364A. Thus, the observations
in paragraph 92 may not be read to obviate the establishment of second condition as noticed above
for bringing home the offence under Section 364A."
39. Section 149 of Indian Penal Code runs as under :-
"149. Every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution
of common object.-- If an offence is committed by any member of an unlawful
assembly in prosecution of the common object of that assembly, or such as the
members of that assembly knew to be likely to be committed in prosecution of that
object, every person who, at the time of the committing of that offence, is a member
of the same assembly, is guilty of that offence."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7977056/ 26
The State Of Madhya Pradesh vs Shankar Singh Gurjar on 5 October, 2021
40. There are two essential elements covering the act under Section 149 of Indian Penal Code, which
are as under:-
(i) The assembly should consist of at least five persons; and
(ii) They should have a common object to commit an offence or achieve any one of
the objects enumerated therein.
41. For recording a conclusion that a person is guilty of any offence under Section 149 of IPC, it must
be proved that such person is a member of an "unlawful assembly" consisting of not less than five
persons irrespective of the fact whether the identity of each one of the five persons is proved or not.
If that fact is proved, the next step of inquiry is whether the common object of the unlawful
assembly is one of the five enumerated objects specified under Section 141 of IPC.
42. The common object of assembly is normally to be gathered from the circumstances of each case
such as the time and place of the gathering of the assembly, the conduct of the gathering as
distinguished from the conduct of the individual members are indicative of the common object of
the gathering. Assessing the common object of an assembly only on the basis of overt acts
committed by such individual members of the assembly is not permissible.
43. In Dani Singh v. State of Bihar [(2004) 13 SCC 203], the Hon'ble Apex Court has observed as
under :-
"The emphasis in Section 149 IPC is on the common object and not on common
intention. Mere presence in an unlawful assembly cannot render a person liable
unless there was a common object and he was actuated by that common object and
that object is one of those set out in Section
141. Where common object of an unlawful assembly is not proved, the accused
persons cannot be convicted with the help of Section 149. The crucial question to
determine is whether the assembly consisted of five or more persons and whether the
said persons entertained one or more of the common objects, as specified in Section
141. It cannot be laid down as a general proposition of law that unless an overt act is
proved against a person, who is alleged to be a member of unlawful assembly, it
cannot be said that he is a member of an assembly. The only thing required is that he
should have understood that the assembly was unlawful and was likely to commit any
of the acts which fall within the purview of Section 141. The word 'object' means the
purpose or design and, in order to make it 'common', it must be shared by all. In
other words, the object should be common to the persons, who compose the
assembly, that is to say, they should all be aware of it and concur in it. A common
object may be formed by express agreement after mutual consultation, but that is by
no means necessary. It may be formed at any stage by all or a few members of the
assembly and the other members may just join and adopt it. Once formed, it need not
continue to be the same. It may be modified or altered or abandoned at any stage.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7977056/ 27
The State Of Madhya Pradesh vs Shankar Singh Gurjar on 5 October, 2021
The expression 'in prosecution of common object' as appearing in Section 149 has to
be strictly construed as equivalent to 'in order to attain the common object'. It must
be immediately connected with the common object by virtue of the nature of the
object. There must be community of object and the object may exist only up to a
particular stage, and not thereafter. Members of an unlawful assembly may have
community of object up to certain point beyond which they may differ in their objects
and the knowledge, possessed by each member of what is likely to be committed in
prosecution of their common object may vary not only according to the information
at his command, but also according to the extent to which he shares the community
of object, and as a consequence of this the effect of Section 149, IPC may be different
on different members of the same assembly."
44. In Mahadev Sharma v. State of Bihar [(1966) 1 SCR 18], the Hon'ble Apex Court has discussed
about applicability of Section 149 of IPC and observed as under :-
"The fallacy in the cases which hold that a charge under Section 147 is compulsory
arises because they overlook that the ingredients of Section 143 are implied in Section
147 and the ingredients of Section 147 are implied when a charge under Section 149 is
included. An examination of Section 141 shows that the common object which
renders an assembly unlawful may involve the use of criminal force or show of
criminal force, the commission of mischief or criminal trespass or other offence, or
resistance to the execution of any law or of any legal process. Offenses under Sections
143 and 147 must always he present when the charge is laid for an offence like
murder with the aid of Section 149, but the other two charges need not be framed
-separately unless it is sought to secure a conviction under them. It is thus that
Section 143 is not used when the charge is under Section 147 or Section 148, and
Section 147 is not used when the charge is under Section 148.
Section 147 may be dispensed with when the charge is under Section 149 read with an
offence under the Indian Penal Code."
45. It is relevant to mention here that if all the necessary ingredients are present in a case when
charges were framed under Section 149 of IPC, each member of unlawful assembly shall be held
liable. The condition precedent is that the prosecution proves the existence of unlawful assembly
with a common object, which is the offence.
46. In Kuldip Yadav vs. State of Bihar [(2011) 5 SCC 324], it is held that a clear finding regarding
nature of the common object of the assembly must be given and the evidence discussed must show
not only the common object, but also that the object was unlawful, before recording a conviction
under Section 149 of IPC. Foremost essential ingredient of Section 141 of IPC must be established.
47. Section 201 of Indian Penal Code runs as under :-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7977056/ 28
The State Of Madhya Pradesh vs Shankar Singh Gurjar on 5 October, 2021
"201. Causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to
screen offender.-- Whoever, knowing or having reason to believe that an offence has
been committed, causes any evidence of the commission of that offence to disappear,
with the intention of screening the offender from legal punishment, or with that
intention gives any information respecting the offence which he knows or believes to
be false;
if a capital offence.--shall, if the offence which he knows or believes to have been
committed is punishable with death, be punished with imprisonment of either
description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to
fine;
if punishable with imprisonment for life.--and if the offence is punishable with
[imprisonment for life], or with imprisonment which may extend to ten years, shall
be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to
three years, and shall also be liable to fine;
if punishable with less than ten years' imprisonment.
--and if the offence is punishable with imprisonment for any term not extending to
ten years, shall be punished with imprisonment of the description provided for the
offence, for a term which may extend to one-fourth part of the longest term of the
imprisonment provided for the offence, or with fine, or with both."
48. Dead body of Shubham @ Shailu was identified by Moharman Lal (PW/1) who is the grand
father of the deceased i.e. Ex-P/6. Neeraj Sharma (PW/7) has also affirmed the statement of
Moharman Lal and has also stated that the dead body of the deceased was found on 7.7.2006 at
around 7.30 pm from the house of Shankar Singh where he identified the dead body. The dead body
was decomposed but he was able to recognize the face.
49. J.N. Soni (PW/12) conducted the postmortem of the deceased and has opined that the deceased
was strangulated thereby the deceased died. The death of deceased was homicidal. The deceased was
also identified by his wearing. The death of deceased was not natural rather homicidal.
50. Prosecution witness Moharman Lal (PW/1) has specifically stated in his statement that on
23.06.2006 deceased Shailu @ Shubham S/o Niraj Sharma, aged around 10 years who was
preparing for entrance exam of Sainik School went to learn the skating but he did not return back
and report was lodged. This witness has also stated that on the same date at around 6 pm he
received a call whereby ransom of Rs.5 Lacs was demanded. This witness has also stated that he was
recently retired, therefore, he was having the aforesaid retiral benefit amount.
51. Bafatan (PW/2) has stated in her statement that she is tenant in the same building since last 10
years. Bajarangi, Ramdeen, Mahendra Singh, Mangilal are also the residents of that building. Earlier
the accused/appellants Raghuveer and Shailendra Sharma were residing as tenant in that building
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7977056/ 29
The State Of Madhya Pradesh vs Shankar Singh Gurjar on 5 October, 2021
and they again came back to reside in that building 15 days prior to the incident. This witness is the
witness of last seen theory and Ameena, Sonu, Bajarangi are also the witnesses of last seen theory.
She has stated that on the date of incident she had seen that one ten years boy was coming along
with the accused Shailendra and Raghuveer Savita. Ameena (PW/3) and Sonu (PW/4) have also
affirmed the aforesaid statement. They have also stated that thereafter the deceased had not
returned back. The seizure of cycle, sandle, skating shoes, key, one tasla, kanni, folding chair and
cement bag was made as per the memorandum given by the accused-appellants Raghuveer and
Shailendra. The seized articles were sent for scientific examination.
52. In the case of Ramreddy Rajeshkhanna Reddy {(2006) 10 SCC 172}, placing reliance on the
judgment in the case of Anil Kumar Singh v. State of Bihar (2003) 9 SCC 67 and Reddy Sampath
Kumar v. State of A.P. (2005) 7 SCC 603, Hon'ble Supreme Court has also considered the last seen
theory and held that-
"The last seen theory, furthermore, comes into play, where the time-gap between the
point of time when the accused and the deceased were last seen alive and the
deceased is found dead is so small that possibility of any person other than the
accused being the author of the crime becomes impossible. Even in such a case
Courts should look for some corroboration. [Held in the case of State of U.P. v. Satish
(2005) 3 SCC 1141.]"
53. Hon'ble Apex Court in case of Hatti Singh vs. State of Haryana, reported in 2007(2) CCSC 802
(SC), relying on the earlier decision of Ramreddy Rajesh Khanna Reddy vs. State of A.P., reported in
{(2006) 10 SCC 172}, held here as under:-
"27. The last-seen theory, furthermore, comes into play where the time gap between
the point of time when the accused and the deceased were last-seen alive and the
deceased is found dead is so small that possibility of any person other than the
accused being the author of the crime becomes impossible. Even in such a case
Courts should look for some corroboration."
54. Similarly, in another decision of State of U.P. v. Satish, reported in {(2005) 3 SCC 114}, again
held as under :-
"22. The last-seen theory comes into play where the time-gap between the point of
time when the accused and the deceased were last seen alive and when the deceased
is found dead is so small that possibility of any person other than the accused being
the author of the crime becomes impossible. It would be difficult in some cases to
positively establish that the deceased was last seen with the accused when there is a
long gap and possibility of other persons coming in between exists. In the absence of
any other positive evidence to conclude that the accused and the deceased were last
seen together. It would be hazardous to come to a conclusion of guilt in those cases.
In this case there is positive evidence that the deceased and the accused were seen
together by witnesses P.Ws. 3 and 5."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7977056/ 30
The State Of Madhya Pradesh vs Shankar Singh Gurjar on 5 October, 2021
55. In Bodhraj @ Bodha and others v. State of Jammu and Kashmir, 2002 (8) SCC 45 it has been
held as follows:
"The last seen theory comes into play where the time- gap between the point of time
when the accused and the deceased were last seen alive and when the deceased is
found dead is so small that possibility of any person other than the accused being the
author of the crime becomes impossible. It would be difficult to some cases, to
positively establish that the deceased was last seen with the accused when there is a
long gap and possibility of other person coming in between exists. in the absence of
any other positive evidence to conclude that the accused and the deceased were last
seen together, it would be hazardous to come to a conclusion of guilt in those cases"
Whereby theory of last seen has been established and this fact remained unchanged.
56. Learned counsel for the appellants have submitted that the relevant and independent witnesses
Vijay and Suryapratap were not examined and there was delay of lodging FIR. But the aforesaid
arguments have no force as number of witnesses are not required to prove the case rather the
statement/quality of evidence is required to be analysed. In the present case, initially missing report
was lodged. Thereafter, on getting the dead body of the deceased the FIR was registered and further
investigation was done. Therefore, it cannot be said that the FIR is delayed.
57. Learned counsel for the appellants have also submitted that there are lots of contradictions and
omissions in the statements given by the prosecution witnesses. But again there is no force in the
aforesaid arguments and the contradictions and omissions are not material and not fatal to the
prosecution case..
58. Learned counsel for the appellants have also submitted that Sonu (PW/4) has not supported the
prosecution case. Rather in his cross-examination he has specifically denied the existence of
incident. Therefore, prosecution case is doubtful.
59. In Khujji @ Surendra Tiwari vs. State of Madhya Pradesh, AIR 1991 SC 1853, wherein it is held
that if the evidence of a prosecution witness cannot be rejected in toto merely because the
prosecution chose to treat him as hostile and cross- examined him. The evidence of such witnesses
cannot be treated as effaced or washed off the record altogether, but the same can be accepted to the
extent their version is found to be dependable on a careful scrutiny thereof. In the present case, it is
apparent from the record that cross-examination of Sonu got delayed due to delaying tactics of
accused/appellants. Therefore, the trial Court has rightly considered the statement of Sonu.
60. Learned counsel for the appellants have also submitted that the rope seized was not the same
which was scientifically examined. But again this argument has no force as the doctor concerned has
specifically opined that the deceased was murdered by strangulation done by the rope. It is also
submitted by the learned counsel for the appellants that the prosecution case is that the dead body
was recovered from the house locked from outside and its lock was broken by using force and the
seized lock was pressure marked from one side. But the lock sent for FSL examination was different
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7977056/ 31
The State Of Madhya Pradesh vs Shankar Singh Gurjar on 5 October, 2021
as in FSL report the scientist has submitted in its report that there was no any pressure mark on the
seized lock. But again this argument has no force as the prosecution story is that the lock was
broken. However, breaking of lock or opening of lock is not material as the dead body was recovered
from inside of Bukhari of this house and the Bukhari was shut down with the help of wall of bricks
and cement. Therefore, the trial Court has rightly held that the aforesaid act was not done with
ulterior motive and reflects the criminal motive/modus operandi of the appellants.
61. As discussed above, Moharman Lal has specifically stated in his statement that as retiral dues he
received Rs.4 Lacs and this fact was in the knowledge of accused/appellants and the demand of
ransom on telephone was received by his daughter-in-law Manoj. It is true that the daughter-in-law
Manoj has not been examined by the prosecution in this case. But there is a complete chain of
circumstantial evidence in the present case and the dead body was recovered under the exceptional
circumstances from the Bukhari and as per memorandum of accused/appellants articles were
recovered/seized and as per scientific evidence reports, chain of circumstantial evidence is
complete. Therefore, the trial Court has rightly observed that non-examining of witness Manoj
(daughter- in-law) is non fatal to the prosecution case. The aforesaid act has been done by the
accused/ appellants and the area from where abduction had taken place for ransom is a notified area
under the provisions of MPDVPK Adhiniyam, 1981. Therefore, the trial Court has rightly held guilty
accused/appellants under Section 11/13 of MPDVPK Act.
62. In the light of the foregoing discussion, we are of the considered opinion that the trial Court did
not err in convicting and sentencing the appellants. Hence, the appeals filed by the appellant
Raghuveer Savita and appellant Shailendra Sharma @ Sonu being Cri.Appeals No.625/2009 &
713/2009 are hereby dismissed and their conviction and sentence are affirmed.
63. As per report dated 9.8.2021 received from Superintendent, Central Jail, Gwalior, Appellant
Raghuveer Savita and appellant Shailendra Sharma @ Sonu are in jail but they have been released
on parole. Trial Court is directed to take steps to ensure the custody of the appellant to serve out
their remaining sentence.
64. In the present case, on perusal of record it is apparent that the trial Court has rightly acquitted
the accused Shankar Singh Gurjar, Surendra Singh and Kampoter Singh Gurjar as there is no
sufficient evidence on record rather against these accused persons the prosecution evidence is
lacking. Therefore, the appeal (Criminal Appeal No.1046/2014) filed by the State has no merits.
Hence, it is hereby rejected.
With a copy of this judgment record of the trial Court be sent back immediately.
