2. It is submitted by the counsel for the petitioner that the petitioner has filed a civil suit against the
respondents which is pending before the Court of Civil Judge, Class-II Datia and an THE HIGH
COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH Mukesh Kumar Ahirvar Vs. State of M.P. and others order of
removal of encroachment was passed by Nazul Tahsildar by holding that the petitioner is an
encroacher. The petitioner being aggrieved by the order of the Nazul Tahsildar had filed an appeal
before the SDO, District Datia, which was dismissed by order dated 23/8/2018. Initially the
respondents had issued warrant of arrest against the petitioner for not having removed the
encroachment. Since the appeal filed by the petitioner was pending before Commissioner
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108140320/ 1
Mukesh Kumar Ahirwar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 3 May, 2019
accordingly, this Court by order dated 6/10/2018 passed in Writ Petition No.23897/2018 observed
as under:-
"Neither pleadings nor learned counsel for the petitioner is able to inform that any
application for stay has been moved alongwith the said appeal before the
Commissioner. Unless and until a prayer for stay is made before the appellate
authority, the order of removal of encroachment, if not complied with, entitles the
competent authority to take coercive steps under the Madhya Pradesh Land Revenue
Code.
In view of above, no case for interference is made out and this petition is disposed of
with liberty to the petitioner to move an appropriate application for stay before the
appellate authority, which if moved within a period of ten days from today, shall be
considered and decided on its own merits without being influenced by this order and
of the fact of petitioner having approached this court.
THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH Mukesh Kumar Ahirvar Vs. State of
M.P. and others Till decision on the said application, if filed by the petitioner within
ten days from today, no coercive steps be taken against the petitioner."
3. It is submitted that since the order of the SDO dated 23/8/2018 was challenged by the petitioner
and the appeal was pending before the Commissioner, Gwalior Division, Gwalior, therefore, he was
directed to decide the application for stay on its own merits, however, as the application for stay was
not decided, therefore, the petitioner filed another Writ Petition No.195/2019, by which the
following order was passed:-
"Gwalior dated 06.01.2019 Shri K.K. Shrivastava, Advocate for the petitioner.
Shri Prakhar Dengula, Government Advocate for the respondents/State.
Shri Anmol Khedkar, learned counsel for the complainant.
Heard on the question of admission and interim relief.
In this petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, the petitioner has
assailed the order dated 31/12/2018 (Annexure P/1), whereby, encroachment made
by the petitioner is directed to be removed. The aforesaid action would be initiated on
07/01/2019 at 10 Am.
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the respondents could not have
issued the impugned order inasmuch as this Court in W.P. No. 23897/2018 vide
order dated 06/10/2018 had granted liberty to the petitioner THE HIGH COURT OF
MADHYA PRADESH Mukesh Kumar Ahirvar Vs. State of M.P. and others to move an
appropriate application for stay before the appellate authority within a period of 10
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108140320/ 2
Mukesh Kumar Ahirwar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 3 May, 2019
days. The petitioner moved an application for stay within a period of 10 days from the
date of order i.e. 06/10/2018, but without deciding the same, impugned order dated
31/12/2018 (Annexure P/1) has been issued. This Court had specifically mentioned in
the order dated 06/10/2018 that till the decision of the said application, if filed by the
petitioner within 10 days from the date of passing of the order, no coercive steps be
taken against the petitioner. Learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that
without deciding the application for stay, the respondents/authorities are bent upon
to remove the encroachment, which cannot be done as the same amounts to
contempt of the order dated 06/10/2018. The petitioner submits that till the
application as directed by this Court is decided, the order dated 31/12/2018
(Annexure P/1) may not be given effect to.
On the other hand, learned State counsel for the respondents opposed the
submissions made by the petitioner and submits that the order passed by this Court
on 06/10/2018 in W.P. No. 23897/2018 relates to issuance of warrant for sending
the petitioner to civil jail, against which, this Court had directed that no coercive
action be taken against the petitioner till the decision of the said application, but has
nothing to do with the proceedings under section 248 of M.P. Land Revenue Code,
1959 (for brevity, MPLRC).
Heard learned counsel for the parties. On bare perusal of the order dated 06/10/2018
passed in W.P. No. 23897/2018, it is seen that the petitioner has already filed an
appeal against the order dated 23/08/2018 THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA
PRADESH Mukesh Kumar Ahirvar Vs. State of M.P. and others passed under section
248 of MPLRC, but could not file an application for interim relief, therefore, this
Court had granted liberty to the petitioner to file the same within 10 days and till then
no coercive steps be taken against him. The respondents instead of deciding the
application has issued the impugned order dated 31/12/2018 which could not have
been done in view of the order dated 10/06/2018.
In these circumstances, the impugned order dated 31/12/2018 (Annexure P/1) is
hereby set aside. However, the respondents are at liberty to first get the said
application filed by the petitioner decided on merits in accordance with the directions
issued by this Court in W.P. No. 23897/2018 vide order dated 06/10/2018 and
thereafter are free to take action against the petitioner in accordance with law. The
said application be decided within a period of 15 (fifteen) days from the date of
receipt of certified copy of this order passed today.
Accordingly, the instant petition stands allowed to the extent indicated herein above.
Certified copy today."
4. It is submitted by the counsel for the petitioner that it is clear that the order issuing arrest
warrant was set aside by this Court in Writ Petition No.195/2019. Later on, the Commissioner,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108140320/ 3
Mukesh Kumar Ahirwar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 3 May, 2019
Gwalior Division, Gwalior has dismissed the appeal filed by the petitioner by impugned order dated
13/3/2019. IA No.1772/2019 has been filed stating that in execution of the arrest warrant the
petitioner has been sent to civil jail for a period of six months THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA
PRADESH Mukesh Kumar Ahirvar Vs. State of M.P. and others and, therefore, the petitioner may
be directed to be released from the civil jail.
5. Heard learned counsel for the petitioner.
6. It appears that, earlier the petitioner was sent to civil jail for not having removed the
encroachment and after undergoing the entire sentence of civil jail, he was released on 5/9/2018.
Thereafter, the Revenue Inspector was sent on spot and it was found that the petitioner has not
removed the encroachment and accordingly, by order dated 14/9/2018 it was directed that as the
petitioner has once again encroached upon the land in question, therefore, the jail warrant be issued
for undergoing the civil jail for a period of six months. It is the contention of the petitioner that this
jail warrant was set aside by this Court by order dated 6/1/2019 passed in Writ Petition
No.195/2019 and, therefore, now the petitioner cannot be sent to jail on the strength of the jail
warrant which has already been set aside by this Court.
7. Since the petitioner had not annexed the copy of the writ petition No.195/2019, therefore, the
record of writ petition No.195/2019 was called. After going through the record of the writ petition
No.195/2019 as well as after going through the THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
Mukesh Kumar Ahirvar Vs. State of M.P. and others present writ petition and the documents
annexed with the same, it is clear that the petitioner is guilty of suppressing material facts, as the
factum of dismissal of his application under Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2 of CPC as well as
Miscellaneous Appeal has not been mentioned and thus on earlier occasion, he had succeeded in
obtaining favourable order.
8. Similarly, the record of Writ Petition No.23897/2018 was called. I have gone through the writ
petition and in the entire writ petition except by mentioning that the suit filed by the petitioner for
declaration of title and permanent injunction is pending, there is no whisper with regard to the
rejection of the application under Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2 CPC as well as dismissal of his appeal.
Thus, it is clear that the order dated 6/10/2018 passed in Writ Petition No.23897/2018 was also
obtained by the petitioner by suppressing the material fact. Further, one Smt. Rajshri Ahirvar, who
claims herself to be the Whistle Blower, has filed a petition for review on the ground that the order
dated 6/10/2018 has been obtained by the petitioner by suppressing material facts and the said
Review Petition has been registered as R.P. No.1723/2018. In the Review Petition by order dated
3/12/2018 THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH Mukesh Kumar Ahirvar Vs. State of M.P.
and others this Court had directed for payment of process fee within a period of three days,
otherwise the Review Petition shall stand dismissed and the office was also directed to reflect the
name of Shri K.K. Shrivastava, as the counsel for the respondent. The notice of the said Review
Petition has been served on the petitioner on 27/12/2018. Thus, the petitioner is also aware of the
fact that Review Petition No.1723/2018 is pending against the order dated 6/10/2018 passed in Writ
Petition No.23897/2018, but still there is no reference of the pendency of said Review Petition.

Mukesh Kumar Ahirwar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 3 May, 2019
9. Be that as it may.
10. The petitioner was declared as an encroacher by the revenue authorities, therefore, he has filed a
suit for declaration of his title and permanent injunction. The copy of the plaint is filed as Annexure
P/2. It appears that the petitioner had filed an application under Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2 CPC,
however, nothing has been mentioned by the petitioner in the writ petition about the filing of the
application for temporary injunction as well as about the outcome of the said application except by
mentioning that "stay was rejected by Trial Court". In the THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA
PRADESH Mukesh Kumar Ahirvar Vs. State of M.P. and others meanwhile, the order of the revenue
authorities was challenged by the petitioner and now by the impugned order dated 13/3/2019
passed by the Additional Commissioner, Gwalior Division, Gwalior the appeal filed by the petitioner
against the order of the SDO has been dismissed. The present petition has been filed challenging the
order dated 13/3/2019 passed by the Additional Commissioner, Gwalior Division, Gwalior. Since
there was nothing in the writ petition to indicate that whether the petitioner had filed any
application under Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2 CPC and what happened to the said application,
therefore, without granting any interim relief, this Court had issued notices. During the course of
arguments it is accepted by the counsel for the petitioner that the petitioner had filed an application
under Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2 CPC before the trial court and the said application was dismissed
by the trial court by order dated 26/10/2004. Being aggrieved by the said order passed by the trial
court the petitioner had filed an appeal under Order XLIII Rule 1 CPC, which too was dismissed by
the appellate court by order dated 6/7/2005.
11. When a specific question was put to the petitioner as to THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA
PRADESH Mukesh Kumar Ahirvar Vs. State of M.P. and others why he had not disclosed the fact of
dismissal of his application filed under Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2 CPC as well as his appeal under
Order XLIII Rule 1 CPC, then initially the counsel for the petitioner tried to submit that since the
said orders have been placed on record by the respondent no.7, therefore, it cannot be said that
there was any suppression on the part of the petitioner. The answer given by the counsel for the
petitioner was shocking, therefore, this Court directed the petitioner to read out the entire writ
petition and to point out that whether any specific averment has been made in the writ petition to
the effect that the petitioner had filed an application under Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2 CPC before
the trial court and whether there is any reference to the outcome of the said application, then with
great difficulties, the counsel for the petitioner admitted that he has not pleaded specifically in this
regard. Thereafter, again the counsel for the petitioner was asked as to why he has not placed the
said two orders on record, then he tried to divert the attention of this Court by saying that since in
the impugned order there is a reference of rejection of application under Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2
CPC, therefore, he did not file it. Thus, it is clear that there THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA
PRADESH Mukesh Kumar Ahirvar Vs. State of M.P. and others is a deliberate suppression by the
petitioner and by suppressing this fact that his application for temporary injunction was already
dismissed and the appeal arising therefrom has already been dismissed, the petitioner has tried to
obtain the order from this Court for the protection of his encroachment and in the past he had
succeeded in obtaining the favourable order . This suppression on the part of the petitioner cannot
be tolerated.

Mukesh Kumar Ahirwar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 3 May, 2019
12. At this stage, it is submitted by the counsel for the petitioner that by IA No.1772/2019 the
petitioner has prayed for release of the petitioner from civil jail because he has been sent to jail on
the basis of the warrant of arrest, which has already been set aside by this Court in Writ Petition
No.195/2019. Accordingly, this Court has gone through the record of Writ Petition Nos.23897/2018
and 195/2019. In Writ Petitions No.23897/2018 and 195/2019, there is again complete silence
about dismissal of application filed by the petitioner under Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2 CPC as well
as dismissal of his appeal under Order XLIII Rule 1 (r) CPC. Thus, it is clear that even writ petitions
No. 23897/2018 and 195/2019 were filed by suppressing the material facts. Furthermore, this Court
by order THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH Mukesh Kumar Ahirvar Vs. State of M.P. and
others dated 6/1/2019 passed in Writ Petition No.195/2019 has quashed the order dated
31/12/2018 on the ground that this Court by order dated 6/11/2018 passed in Writ Petition
No.23897/2018 had granted the liberty to the petitioner to move an appropriate application for stay
before the appellate authority and during the pendency of the said stay application, the order dated
31/12/2018 has been issued. This Court has gone through the order dated 31/12/2018. By this order,
the Nazul Tahsildar, Datia has written to the SDO (P), Datia for providing police protection for
removing the encroachment. The order dated 14/9/2018 by which the arrest warrants were issued
has not been set aside by this Court by its order dated 6/1/2019 passed in Writ Petition
No.195/2019. Thus, the submission made by the counsel for the petitioner that since his arrest
warrant has already been set aside, therefore, the petitioner cannot be arrested on the strength of
the said arrest warrant, cannot be accepted, but on the contrary, it is clear that once again the
petitioner has tried to mislead the Court.
13. The Supreme Court in the case of S.J.S. Business Enterprises (P) Ltd. v. State of Bihar reported
in (2004) 7 SCC 166 has held as under :
THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH Mukesh Kumar Ahirvar Vs. State of
M.P. and others "13. As a general rule, suppression of a material fact by a litigant
disqualifies such litigant from obtaining any relief. This rule has been evolved out of
the need of the courts to deter a litigant from abusing the process of court by
deceiving it. But the suppressed fact must be a material one in the sense that had it
not been suppressed it would have had an effect on the merits of the
case..........................."
The Supreme Court in the case of Dalip Singh v. State of U.P. reported in (2010) 2 SCC 114 has held
as under :
"4. In Welcom Hotel v. State of A.P. [(1983) 4 SCC 575 ] the Court held that a party
which has misled the Court in passing an order in its favour is not entitled to be
heard on the merits of the case.
5. In G. Narayanaswamy Reddy v. Govt. of Karnataka [(1991) 3 SCC 261] the Court
denied relief to the appellant who had concealed the fact that the award was not
made by the Land Acquisition Officer within the time specified in Section 11-A of the
Land Acquisition Act because of the stay order passed by the High Court. While
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108140320/ 6
Mukesh Kumar Ahirwar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 3 May, 2019
dismissing the special leave petition, the Court observed: (SCC p. 263, para 2) "2. ...
Curiously enough, there is no reference in the special leave petitions to any of the stay
orders and we came to know about these orders only when the respondents appeared
in response to the notice and filed their counter-affidavit. In our view, the said
interim orders have a direct bearing on the question raised and the non- disclosure of
the same certainly amounts to suppression of material facts. On this ground alone,
the special leave petitions are liable to be rejected. It is well settled in law that the
THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH Mukesh Kumar Ahirvar Vs. State of
M.P. and others relief under Article 136 of the Constitution is discretionary and a
petitioner who approaches this Court for such relief must come with frank and full
disclosure of facts. If he fails to do so and suppresses material facts, his application is
liable to be dismissed. We accordingly dismiss the special leave petitions."
6. In S.P. Chengalvaraya Naidu v. Jagannath [(1994) 1 SCC 1] the Court held that where a
preliminary decree was obtained by withholding an important document from the court, the party
concerned deserves to be thrown out at any stage of the litigation.
7. In Prestige Lights Ltd. v. SBI [(2007) 8 SCC 449] it was held that in exercising power under
Article 226 of the Constitution of India the High Court is not just a court of law, but is also a court of
equity and a person who invokes the High Court's jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution
is duty-bound to place all the facts before the Court without any reservation. If there is suppression
of material facts or twisted facts have been placed before the High Court then it will be fully justified
in refusing to entertain a petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution. This Court referred to
the judgment of Scrutton, L.J. in R. v. Kensington Income Tax Commissioners [(1917) 1 KB 486
(CA)], and observed: (Prestige Lights Ltd. case, SCC p. 462, para 35) In exercising jurisdiction under
Article 226 of the Constitution, the High Court will always keep in mind the conduct of the party
who is invoking such jurisdiction. If the applicant does not disclose full facts or suppresses relevant
materials or is otherwise guilty of misleading the court, then the Court may dismiss the action
without adjudicating THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH Mukesh Kumar Ahirvar Vs. State
of M.P. and others the matter on merits. The rule has been evolved in larger public interest to deter
unscrupulous litigants from abusing the process of court by deceiving it. The very basis of the writ
jurisdiction rests in disclosure of true, complete and correct facts. If the material facts are not
candidly stated or are suppressed or are distorted, the very functioning of the writ courts would
become impossible.
8. In A.V. Papayya Sastry v. Govt. of A.P. [(2007) 4 SCC 221] the Court held that Article 136 does not
confer a right of appeal on any party. It confers discretion on this Court to grant leave to appeal in
appropriate cases. In other words, the Constitution has not made the Supreme Court a regular court
of appeal or a court of error. This Court only intervenes where justice, equity and good conscience
require such intervention.
9. In Sunil Poddar v. Union Bank of India [(2008) 2 SCC 326] the Court held that while exercising
discretionary and equitable jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution, the facts and
circumstances of the case should be seen in their entirety to find out if there is miscarriage of justice.

Mukesh Kumar Ahirwar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 3 May, 2019
If the appellant has not come forward with clean hands, has not candidly disclosed all the facts that
he is aware of and he intends to delay the proceedings, then the Court will non-suit him on the
ground of contumacious conduct.
10. In K.D. Sharma v. SAIL [(2008) 12 SCC 481] the Court held that the jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court under Article 32 and of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution is extraordinary,
equitable and discretionary and it is imperative that the petitioner approaching the writ court must
come with clean hands and put forward all the facts before the Court without concealing or
suppressing anything and seek an appropriate THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
Mukesh Kumar Ahirvar Vs. State of M.P. and others relief. If there is no candid disclosure of
relevant and material facts or the petitioner is guilty of misleading the Court, his petition may be
dismissed at the threshold without considering the merits of the claim. The same rule was reiterated
in G. Jayashree v. Bhagwandas S. Patel]." The Supreme Court in the case of Bhaskar Laxman Jadhav
v. Karamveer Kakasaheb Wagh Education Society reported in (2013) 11 SCC 531 has held as under :
"Suppression of fact
42. While dealing with the conduct of the parties, we may also notice the submission
of the learned counsel for Respondent 1 to the effect that the petitioners are guilty of
suppression of a material fact from this Court, namely, the rejection on 2-5-2003 of
the first application for extension of time filed by the trustees and the finality
attached to it. These facts have not been clearly disclosed to this Court by the
petitioners. It was submitted that in view of the suppression, special leave to appeal
should not be granted to the petitioners.
43. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that no material facts have been
withheld from this Court. It was submitted that while the order dated 2-5-2003 was
undoubtedly not filed, its existence was not material in view of subsequent
developments that had taken place. We cannot agree.
44. It is not for a litigant to decide what fact is material for adjudicating a case and
what is not material. It is the obligation of a litigant to disclose all the facts of a case
and leave the decision-making to the court. True, there is a mention of the order
dated 2-5-2003 in the order THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH Mukesh
Kumar Ahirvar Vs. State of M.P. and others dated 24-7-2006 passed by the JCC, but
that is not enough disclosure. The petitioners have not clearly disclosed the facts and
circumstances in which the order dated 2-5-2003 was passed or that it has attained
finality.
45. We may only refer to two cases on this subject. In Hari Narain v. Badri Das stress
was laid on litigants eschewing inaccurate, untrue or misleading statements,
otherwise leave granted to an appellant may be revoked. It was observed as follows:
(AIR p. 1560, para 9) "9. ... It is of utmost importance that in making material
statements and setting forth grounds in applications for special leave care must be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108140320/ 8
Mukesh Kumar Ahirwar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 3 May, 2019
taken not to make any statements which are inaccurate, untrue or misleading. In
dealing with applications for special leave, the Court naturally takes statements of
fact and grounds of fact contained in the petitions at their face value and it would be
unfair to betray the confidence of the Court by making statements which are untrue
and misleading. That is why we have come to the conclusion that in the present case,
special leave granted to the appellant ought to be revoked. Accordingly, special leave
is revoked and the appeal is dismissed. The appellant will pay the costs of the
respondent."
46. More recently, in Ramjas Foundation v. Union of India the case law on the subject was
discussed. It was held that if a litigant does not come to the court with clean hands, he is not entitled
to be heard and indeed, such a person is not entitled to any relief from any judicial forum. It was
said: (SCC p. 51, para 21) "21. The principle that a person who does not come to the court with clean
hands is not entitled to be heard on the merits of his THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
Mukesh Kumar Ahirvar Vs. State of M.P. and others grievance and, in any case, such person is not
entitled to any relief is applicable not only to the petitions filed under Articles 32, 226 and 136 of the
Constitution but also to the cases instituted in others courts and judicial forums. The object
underlying the principle is that every court is not only entitled but is duty-bound to protect itself
from unscrupulous litigants who do not have any respect for truth and who try to pollute the stream
of justice by resorting to falsehood or by making misstatement or by suppressing facts which have a
bearing on adjudication of the issue(s) arising in the case."
47. A mere reference to the order dated 2-5- 2003, en passant, in the order dated 24-7-2006 does
not serve the requirement of disclosure. It is not for the court to look into every word of the
pleadings, documents and annexures to fish out a fact. It is for the litigant to come upfront and clean
with all material facts and then, on the basis of the submissions made by the learned counsel, leave
it to the court to determine whether or not a particular fact is relevant for arriving at a decision.
Unfortunately, the petitioners have not done this and must suffer the consequence thereof." The
Supreme Court in the case of Manohar Lal v. Ugrasen, reported in (2010) 11 SCC 557 has held as
under:
"48. The present appellants had also not disclosed that land allotted to them falls in commercial
area. When a person approaches a court of equity in exercise of its extraordinary jurisdiction under
Articles 226/227 of the Constitution, he should approach the court not only with clean hands but
also with clean mind, THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH Mukesh Kumar Ahirvar Vs.
State of M.P. and others clean heart and clean objective. "Equally, the judicial process should never
become an instrument of oppression or abuse or a means in the process of the court to subvert
justice." Who seeks equity must do equity. The legal maxim "Jure naturae aequum est neminem
cum alterius detrimento et injuria fieri locupletiorem", means that it is a law of nature that one
should not be enriched by the loss or injury to another. (Vide Ramjas Foundation v. Union of India,
K.R. Srinivas v. R.M. Premchand and Noorduddin v. Dr. K.L. Anand at SCC p. 249, para 9.)
49. Similarly, in Ramniklal N. Bhutta v. State of Maharashtra this Court observed as under: (SCC p.
140, para 10) "10. ... The power under Article 226 is discretionary. It will be exercised only in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108140320/ 9
Mukesh Kumar Ahirwar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 3 May, 2019
furtherance of interests of justice and not merely on the making out of a legal point. ... the interests
of justice and the public interest coalesce. They are very often one and the same. ... The courts have
to weigh the public interest vis-à-vis the private interest while exercising ... any of their discretionary
powers."
(emphasis added)
50. In Tilokchand Motichand v. H.B. Munshi, State of Haryana v. Karnal Distillery Co. Ltd. and
Sabia Khan v. State of U.P. this Court held that filing a totally misconceived petition amounts to
abuse of the process of the court. Such a litigant is not required to be dealt with lightly, as a petition
containing misleading and inaccurate statement, if filed, to achieve an ulterior purpose amounts to
abuse of the process of the court. A litigant is bound to make "full and true disclosure of facts".
51. In Abdul Rahman v. Prasony Bai, S.J.S. Business Enterprises (P) Ltd. v. State of Bihar and Oswal
Fats & Oils Ltd. v. Commr. (Admn.) this THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH Mukesh
Kumar Ahirvar Vs. State of M.P. and others Court held that whenever the court comes to the
conclusion that the process of the court is being abused, the court would be justified in refusing to
proceed further and refuse relief to the party. This rule has been evolved out of need of the courts to
deter a litigant from abusing the process of the court by deceiving it."
14. The manner in which the petitioner has repeatedly approached this Court by suppressing the
material facts, this Court is of the considered opinion that the petitioner is required to be dealt with
firmly. All the orders from this Court have been obtained by the petitioner by suppressing the
material fact that his application for grant of temporary injunction has already been rejected by the
trial court as well as the appeal has also been dismissed. Under these circumstances, this Court is of
the prima facie opinion that this petition is liable to be dismissed with heavy cost in the light of the
judgment passed by the Supreme Court in the case of Messer Holdings Ltd. v. Shyam Madanmohan
Ruia reported in (2016) 11 SCC 484, wherein the Supreme Court has held as under:-
"49. This case should also serve as proof of the abuse of the discretionary jurisdiction
of this Court under Article 136 by the rich and powerful in the name of a "fight for
justice" at each and every interlocutory step of a suit. Enormous THE HIGH COURT
OF MADHYA PRADESH Mukesh Kumar Ahirvar Vs. State of M.P. and others
amount of judicial time of this Court and two High Courts was spent on this
litigation. Most of it is avoidable and could have been well spent on more deserving
cases.
50. This Court in Ramrameshwari Devi v. Nirmala Devi observed at para 54: (SCC p.
268) "54. While imposing costs we have to take into consideration pragmatic realities
and be realistic as to what the defendants or the respondents had to actually incur in
contesting the litigation before different courts. We have to also broadly take into
consideration the prevalent fee structure of the lawyers and other miscellaneous
expenses which have to be incurred towards drafting and filing of the
counter-affidavit, miscellaneous charges towards typing, photocopying, court fee,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108140320/ 10
Mukesh Kumar Ahirwar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 3 May, 2019
etc."
51. We therefore, deem it appropriate to impose exemplary costs quantified at Rs 25,00,000
(Rupees twenty-five lakhs only) to be paid by each of the three parties i.e. GGL, MGG and the Ruias.
The said amount is to be paid to the National Legal Services Authority as compensation for the loss
of judicial time of this country and the same may be utilised by the National Legal Services
Authority to fund poor litigants to pursue their claims before this Court in deserving cases."
15. Therefore, the present petition is dismissed with a cost of Rs.30,000/- (Rs. Thirty Thousand
Only) to be deposited by the petitioner in the account of Legal Aid Services Authority, Gwalior
within a period of one month from today.
16. At this stage, it is submitted by the counsel for the THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
Mukesh Kumar Ahirvar Vs. State of M.P. and others petitioner that since the petitioner has already
been arrested by the police in execution of the warrant of arrest issued by order dated 14/9/2018,
therefore, it would not be possible for him to deposit the cost of Rs.30,000/- within a period of one
month from today.
17. Considering the submissions made by the counsel for the petitioner, it is directed that the cost
shall be deposited within one month from the date of release of the petitioner from the civil jail and
the respondents are directed to immediately serve a copy of this order on the petitioner, in the jail.
18. Since, all previous orders from this Court were obtained by the petitioner by suppressing
material facts, accordingly, this petition is dismissed with direction to the respondents to proceed
for removal of encroachment as per law.
19. The office is directed to immediately send a copy of this order to the respondents and the
respondents are directed to file their report regarding removal of encroachment within a period of
two months. Generally, this Court would not have issued above mentioned direction, but after
having come to a conclusion that order dated 16/1/2019 passed by this Court in Writ Petition THE
HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH Mukesh Kumar Ahirvar Vs. State of M.P. and others
No.195/2019 (by which the request for police force for removal of encroachment was set aside by
this Court) as well as order dated 6/10/2018 passed in W.P. No.23897/2018 were obtained by
concealing facts, therefore, this Court is left with no other option but to issue above mentioned
direction.
20. The office is directed to list this case under the caption "Direction Matters", for consideration of
compliance report.
