M/S Mahadev Enclave Pvt. Ltd. & Anr vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 27 October, 2016
The issues, which the present writ petition raises, are:
Whether a settlee of a minor mineral becomes the owner of the minor
mineral, namely, sand, which it extracts and, having become the owner
of the sand, whether the settlee becomes free to fix the sale price of its
sand with no legal impediment of having to cap the maximum limit of
Patna High Court CWJC No.9908 of 2016
2/13
its sale price inasmuch as sand is not an essential commodity and the
Government has no authority or jurisdiction to fix the upper limit of the
sale price? Yet another question, which pertinently arises, is: Whether
the State Government(cid:128)s decision to fix the sale price of extracted sand
by taking resort to Rule 48(1)(A) of Bihar Minor Mineral Concession
Rules, 1972, is ultra vires Section 15 of the Act and also in violation of
Articles 14, 19(1)(g) and 300-A of the Constitution of India?
2. With the help of this writ petition, the petitioner prays
for the following reliefs:
(a) for issuance of an order declaring Rule 48 of
the Bihar Minor Mineral Concession Rules,
1972, ultra vires the provisions of the Mines
and Minerals (Development and Regulation)
Act, 1957 (hereinafter referred to as â€žthe
Act(cid:128)), and Article 14, 19(1)(g) and 300-A of
the Constitution of India and, consequently,
issue a writ of mandamus to the respondents
not to give effect to Rule 48 of the Bihar Minor
Mineral Concession Rules, 1972;

Background facts:
Patna High Court CWJC No.9908 of 2016
3. Shorn of unnecessary details, the facts necessary for adjudication of writ petition
are, in brief, as under:
4. The petitioner, which is a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956,
pursuant to the Notice Inviting Tenders (NIT), dated 16.10.2014, for settlement of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173380154/ 4
M/S Mahadev Enclave Pvt. Ltd. & Anr vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 27 October, 2016
sand ghats located at the Banka district, in the State of Bihar, for a period
commencing from 01.01.2015 and ending on 31.12.2019, issued by the Department of
Mines and Geology, Government of Bihar, submitted its bids, technical as well as
financial, which came to be finalized on 21.10.2014. The petitioner, having been
declared the highest bidder in the tender process aforementioned, deposited
accordingly the bid amount and the security money on different dates and entered
into an agreement, with the State Government, on 20.05.2015, for mining, extracting
and removing sand, for the period aforementioned under the provisions of the Bihar
Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1972, (hereinafter referred to as 'the Rules').
5. According to the petitioner, Department of Mines and Geology, Government of Bihar, did not
notify the sale price as required in terms of Clause 16 of the NIT, dated 16.10.2014. Later on , when
all the settlees of the sand ghats of Bihar, on their own, enhanced the sale price of sand in
accordance with Clause 16 of the NIT, the Department of Mines and Geology, Government of Bihar,
came out Patna High Court CWJC No.9908 of 2016 with a letter, dated 30.12.2015, restraining the
settlees from increasing the sale price at their level and asserted that the power and authority to
enhance the sale price lies with the Department exclusively under the provisions of Rule 48 (1) (A)
of the Rules.
6. In the meanwhile, the rate of Bihar Value Added Tax was, according to the petitioner, increased
from 5% to 14.5% in the light of the Notification, contained in SO 10, dated 13.01.2016, issued by the
Commercial Taxes Department, Government of Bihar, without there being any increase in the sale
price of the sand thereby compelling the petitioner to realize the difference of Bihar Value Added
Tax, being an indirect tax, from the purchasers.
7. The petitioner contends that even for the settlement year 2016, the Department of Mines and
Geology, Government of Bihar, had not come out with any notification fixing or revising the sale
price of sand under Clause 16 of the NIT.
8. The petitioner, therefore, as the owner of the sand, so extracted, claims the right to fix the sale
price of sand at its own level, and has challenged, with the help of this writ petition, the power of the
State Government to fix the sale price of sand taking the aid of Rule 48(1)(A) of the Rules, which,
according to the petitioner, ultra vires not only Section 15 of the Act, but also violative of Articles 14,
19(1)(g) and 300-A of the Constitution of India. Patna High Court CWJC No.9908 of 2016
9. The question, which falls for consideration, as already indicated above, is: Can the State
Government fix, under Rule 48(1)(A) of the Rules, the upper limit of the sale price of extracted
minor mineral, such as, sand and, if so, whether Rule 48(1)(A) of the Rules is ultra vires Section 15
of the Act and violative of Articles 14, 19(1)(g) and 300-A of the Constitution of India?
10. We have heard Mr. Devasis Bharuka, learned Counsel, appearing for the petitioner, and Mr. D.
K. Sinha, learned Senior Counsel, appearing for the respondent Mines Department. We have heard
also Mr. Anshuman Singh, learned Counsel, appearing for the respondent No.6, and Mr. Khurshid
Alam, learned Additional Advocate General No.XII, appearing for the State-respondents.

M/S Mahadev Enclave Pvt. Ltd. & Anr vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 27 October, 2016
11. Section 15 of the Act, being relevant, is reproduced hereinbelow:
"15 - Power of State Governments to make rules in respect of minor minerals (1) The
State Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, make rules for
regulating the grant of quarry leases, mining leases or other mineral concessions in
respect of minor minerals and for purposes connected therewith.
(1A) In particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power,
such rules may provide for all or any of the following matters, namely:--
Patna High Court CWJC No.9908 of 2016
(a) the person by whom and the manner in which, applications for quarry leases,
mining leases or other mineral concessions may be made and the fees to be paid
therefor;
(b) the time within which, and the form in which, acknowledgement of the receipt of
any such applications may be sent;
(c) the matters which may be considered where applications in respect of the same
land are received within the same day;
(d) the terms on which, and the conditions subject to which and the authority by
which quarry leases, mining leases or other mineral concessions may be granted or
renewed;
(e) the procedure for obtaining quarry leases, mining leases or other mineral
concessions;
(f) the facilities to be afforded by holders of quarry leases, mining leases or other
mineral concessions to persons deputed by the Government for the purpose of
undertaking research or training in matters relating to mining operations;
(g) the fixing and collection of rent, royalty, fees, dead rent, fines or other charges
and the time within which and the manner in which these shall be payable;
Patna High Court CWJC No.9908 of 2016
(h) the manner in which rights of third parties may be protected (whether by way of payment of
compensation or otherwise) in cases where any such party is prejudicially affected by reason of any
prospecting or mining operations;
(i) the manner in which rehabilitation of flora and other vegetation, such as trees, shrubs and the
like destroyed by reason of any quarrying or mining operations shall be made in the same area or in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173380154/ 6
M/S Mahadev Enclave Pvt. Ltd. & Anr vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 27 October, 2016
any other area selected by the State Government (whether by way of reimbursement of the cost of
rehabilitation or otherwise) by the person holding the quarrying or mining lease;
(j) the manner in which and the conditions subject to which, a quarry lease, mining lease or other
mineral concessions may be transferred;
(k) the construction, maintenance and use of roads, power transmission lines, tramways, railways,
aerial ropeways, pipelines and the making of passage for water for mining purposes on any land
comprised in a quarry or mining lease or other mineral concession;
(l) the form of registers to be maintained under this Act;
(m) the reports and statements to be submitted by holders of quarry or mining leases or other Patna
High Court CWJC No.9908 of 2016 mineral concessions and the authority to which such reports
and statements shall be submitted;
(n) the period within which and the manner in which and the authority to which applications for
revision of any order passed by any authority under these rules may be made, the fees to be paid
therefor, and the powers of the revisional authority; and
(o) any other matter which is to be, or may be prescribed.] (2) Until rules are made under
sub-section (1), any rules made by a State Government regulating the grant of1[quarry leases,
mining leases or other mineral concessions] in respect of minor minerals which are in force
immediately before the commencement of this Act shall continue in force.
(3) The holder of a mining lease or any other mineral concession granted under any rule made
under sub-section (1) shall pay royalty or dead rent, whichever is more in respect of minor minerals
removed or consumed by him or by his agent, manager, employee, contractor or sub-lessee at the
rate prescribed for the time being in the rules framed by the State Government in respect of minor
minerals:
Patna High Court CWJC No.9908 of 2016 Provided that the State Government shall
not enhance the rate of5[royalty or dead rent] in respect of any minor mineral for
more than once during any period of three years.
(4) Without prejudice to sub-sections (1), (2) and sub-section (3), the State
Government may, by notification, make rules for regulating the provisions of this Act
for the following, namely:--
(a) the manner in which the District Mineral Foundation shall work for the interest
and benefit of persons and areas affected by mining under sub-section (2) of section
9B;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173380154/ 7
M/S Mahadev Enclave Pvt. Ltd. & Anr vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 27 October, 2016
(b) the composition and functions of the District Mineral Foundation under
sub-section (3) of section 9B; and
(c) the amount of payment to be made to the District Mineral Foundation by
concession holders of minor minerals under section 15A."
12. From a bare reading of Section 15 of the Act, what becomes clear is that it (Section 15) authorizes
the State Government to regulate the grant of mining lease of minor minerals. Clause (O) Sub-
Section (1-A) of Section 15 of the Act does not, admittedly, empower the State Government to fix the
sale price of minor mineral so extracted. In the present case, it is sand, which has been extracted by
Patna High Court CWJC No.9908 of 2016 the petitioner, and the sand, too, comes within the ambit
of minor mineral.
13. The issue, as to whether a State Government can fix upper limit of sale price of sand, is no longer
res integra inasmuch as the Supreme Court has, in State of T.N. Vs. M.P.P. Kavery Cheety, reported
in (1995) 2 SCC 402, held as follows :
"There is no power conferred upon the State Government under the said Act to
exercise control over minor minerals after they have been excavated. The power of
the State Government, as the subordinate rulemaking authority, is restricted in the
manner set out in Section 15. The power to control the sale and the sale price of a
minor mineral is not covered by the terms of clause (O) of sub-section (1-A) of
Section 15. This clause can relate only to the regulation of the grant of quarry and
mining leases and other mineral concessions and it does not confer the power to
regulate the sale of already mined minerals."
14. From a close reading of the above observations made by the Supreme Court, in State of T.N. Vs.
M.P.P. Kavery Cheety (supra), it becomes abundantly clear that the law laid down, in State of T.N.
Vs. M.P.P. Kavery Cheety (supra), with regard to fixing upper limit of sale price of sand, is that
Clause (O) of sub-Section (1-A) of Section 15 of the Act does not empower a State Government to
control Patna High Court CWJC No.9908 of 2016 the sale and the sale price of a minor mineral or to
regulate the sale of minerals already mined.
15. Confronted with the proposition of law, as laid down by the Supreme Court, in State of T.N. Vs.
M.P.P. Kavery Cheety (supra), Mr. D. K. Sinha, learned Senior Counsel, appearing on behalf of the
respondents, could not bring on record anything to defend the impugned Notification.
16. In the result and for the foregoing reasons, this writ petition is allowed. The impugned
Notification, dated 27.08.2013, insofar as it relates to the fixing of the upper limit of sale price of
extracted sand is concerned, is hereby set aside and quashed.
17. However, there shall be no order as to costs.
(I. A. Ansari, CJ) Dr. Ravi Ranjan, J: I agree.
