carried out an amendments under its statutes framed under Section 40 of the Sher-e-Kashmir

vide notification no. 33 (Secy) of 2022 dated 28.09.2022 by virtue of which an amendment in

Sohnika Rani And Ors vs Sher-E-Kashmir University Of ... on 13 December, 2023
Professor-cum-Jr. Scientist in various disciplines and with regard to the reservation, miscellaneous
instruction (4) of the notice provided as under: -
"The reservation policy and reservation roster in teaching positions in SKUAST
Jammu (at the level of Professor/Associate Professor/Assistant Professor and

certificates........"
4. The petitioners herein claim to be members of Schedule Castes and Schedule Tribes (SC & ST)
categories and possessed of Doctorate degree in different subjects and aspiring candidates for
appointment against the posts advertised in notification dated 12.07.2023 under the said category,
however, are aggrieved of the adoption of the Reservation Policy notified by the Central Government
for Central Educational Institutions, which according to the petitioners has exposed them to
unwarranted competition on national level as the petitioners wish to compete at local/Union
Territory level and as such, have thrown challenge to notification dated 33 (Secy) of 2022 dated
28.09.2022 (for short impugned amendment dated 28.09.2022) and advertisement notice No. 06
(Secy) of 2023 dated 12.07.2023 (for short impugned notice dated 12.07.2023) inter-alia on the
ground that the SKUAST being creation of an Act of legislature of the erstwhile State of Jammu and
Kashmir, is bound to follow the provisions of J&K Reservation Act, 2004 (for short the Act of 2004)
and the rules being Reservation Rules of 2005 (for short the Rules of 2005) in view of the UGC
guidelines/regulations issued in the year 2006 for strict implementation of Reservation Policy of the
Government in Universities, Deemed to be Universities, Colleges and other Grant in- aid
Institutions and Centers as according to Clause 7 of the aforesaid guidelines/regulations dealing
with the Extent of Reservation at (a) and (b) provides as under: -
(a) In all educational institutions refereed to in clause 6(a) above, the extent of
reservation applicable is 15% for SC and 7.5% for ST.
(b) Without prejudice to the provisions contained in clause (a) above, in all the
educational institutions referred to in clause
(a) above, and functioning within any State shall follow the percentage of reservation
prescribed by the respective State Governments.
5. It has been further urged in the petition that in terms of the impugned amendment dated
28.09.2022 the candidates who are domicile of J&K belonging to RBA/ALC categories have no
reservation in SKUAST, which is a State University and that the impugned amendment is violative
of the right of reservation of candidates belonging to said RBA/ALC category provided under the Act
of 2004, as has been done in the impugned notice dated 12.07.2023 which provides for reservation
only to SC/ST/OBC/EWS/PWD categories.
6. Lastly it has been urged in the petition that the S.O 2515(E) dated 12.07.2019 supra which has
been adopted by the SKUAST having been issued by the Central Government in terms of Section 3 of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99681848/ 3
Sohnika Rani And Ors vs Sher-E-Kashmir University Of ... on 13 December, 2023
the Act of 2019 which is not applicable to the SKUAST, for the reason that the SKUAST is a State
University and the Act of 2019 is applicable to Central Educational Institutions alone which fulfill
the criteria provided under the Act of 2019 itself and, as such, the SKUAST could not have adopted
the said S.O. 2515(E) dated 12.07.2019.
7. Objections to the petition have been filed by the SKUAST wherein it is being inter-alia stated the
SKUAST is a Deemed University and receives aid from the Indian Council of Agricultural Research
(ICAR) which is an autonomous organization under the Department of Agriculture Research and
Education (DARE), Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Government of India and, as such,
it falls within the definition of Central Educational Institutions as provided under the Act of 2019.
8. It is being further stated that SKUAST is creation of Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural
Sciences and Technology, Act, 1982 (for short the Act of 1982) and the statutes framed there under
as also Regulations of UGC are not ipsofacto of its own applicable to it unless same are adopted by
the SKUAST.
9. It is next stated in the objections that the SKUAST has framed statutes in exercise of power
conferred to it under the Act of 1982 and clause 8 of which provides for appointment of officers and
teachers in the SKUAST on merits and suitability on the level of All India Competition.
10. It is being further stated in the objections that since there was no Reservation Policy in the
SKUAST, an opinion in this regard was sought from the Department of Law, Justice and
Parliamentary Affairs, Government of Jammu and Kashmir, as to which law would govern to the
SKUAST in the matter of reservation which opinion came to be provided to the SKUAST providing
therein that it is open for the SKUAST to implement the Act of 2004 or the Reservation Policy of
Central Government and thus, the SKUAST consequently took a policy decision and adopted
Reservation Policy notified by the Central Government under S.O 2515(E) in terms of Section 3 of
the Act of 2019.
Heard counsel for the parties and perused the record.
11. Having regard to the nature of controversy involved in the petition, it would be appropriate in the
first instance to examine the applicability of the Act of 2019 to the SKUAST, as such, a reference to
the preamble of the Act becomes necessary which reads as under: -
"An Act which provide for the reservation of posts in appointment by direct
recruitment of persons belonging to Scheduled castes, Scheduled Tribes, the social
and Educational backward classes and economically weaker sections, to teachers
cadre in certain Central Educational Institutions established, maintained or aided by
Central Government and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto."
A reference to Section 2(c) of the Act of 2019 also becomes necessary hereunder which defines
Central Educational Institutions as follows: -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99681848/ 4
Sohnika Rani And Ors vs Sher-E-Kashmir University Of ... on 13 December, 2023
(i) A University established or incorporated by or under a Central Act;
(ii) An institution of national importance established by an Act of Parliament;
(iii) An institution, declared as an institution deemed to be University under section 3
of the University Grants Commission Act, 1956 (3 of 1956 and maintained by or
receiving aid from the Central Government;
(iv) An institution maintained by or receiving aid from the Central Government,
whether directly or indirectly, and affiliated to an institution referred to in sub-clause
(i) or sub-clause(ii) or a constituent unit of an institution referred to in sub-clause
(iii); and
(v) An educational institution established by the Central Government under the
Societies Registration Act, 1860 (21 of 1860);
A plain reading of the clause 3 supra suggests that an institutions declared as an institution Deemed
to be university under Section 3 of the University Grants Commission Act, 1956, and maintained by
or receiving aid from the Central Government is a Central Educational Institute, but said Clause (iii)
is silent about as to whether Institution, Deemed to be a University should be receiving the aid
directly or indirectly. However, in clause (iv) supra the expression "whether directly or indirectly has
been inserted" and as such, absence of such expression/term in clause (iii) while being read with
preamble of the Act of 2019, it becomes clear that an Institution Deemed to be a University under
Section 3 of the University Grants Commission Act 1956, should be in receipt of the aid from the
Central directly. Merely because SKUAST is in receipt of aid from the ICAR does not necessarily
mean that SKUAST has become the Central Educational Institution. In fact the ICAR has published
a list of as many as 63 State Universities which are aided by ICAR in which SKUAST is listed at serial
no. 21 and mere receipt of aid of ICAR does not convert these 63 universities into Central
Educational Institutions more so, Government order No. 520-JK (GAD) of 2022 dated 07.05.2022
clearly provides that SKUAST Jammu/Kashmir are under the Administrative control of Agricultural
Production Department of the Union Territory of J&K. Thus, as appears from above the SKUAST
does not fulfill the criteria enumerated in Section 3 of the Act of 2019, therefore, it can safely be said
that the Act of 2019 is not applicable to the SKUAST and consequently neither would S.O 2515(E)
dated 12.07.2019 apply to it.
12. In view of the aforesaid conclusion the question that would arise now is as to whether the
non-applicability of the Act of 2019 would bar SKUAST from adopting the Reservation Policy
notified in terms of the Act of 2019 vide S.O. 2515(E). To answer to this question, it needs a
reiteration that the SKUAST is the creation of the Act of 1982 and Section 39 of the Act empowers
the SKUAST to frame statute for any matter connecting with the affairs of the University and the
SKUAST under such power has framed statute which stands approved by the competent authority
and clause 8 under chapter (II) of the said statutes being relevant herein provides as under: -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99681848/ 5
Sohnika Rani And Ors vs Sher-E-Kashmir University Of ... on 13 December, 2023
Merit:-
"Appointments shall be made on the basis of merit and suitability on the level of All
India Competition without any discrimination on account of race, creed, sex or class
as envisaged in Section 7 of the Act."
13. Perusal of the statutes, carrying the principle envisaged in Section 7 of the Act of 1982 clearly
provide that candidates from across the Country can be appointed on the basis of merit and
suitability. In other words it suggest that appointment is not restricted to the domiciles of the Union
Territory of J&K and further suggesting that once such appointments are not restricted to the
domiciles of the Union Territory of J&K, the benefits of reservation can also not be restricted to the
domiciles of the Union Territory but, such appointments are to be made in the same manner in
which appointments are made under the SKUAST are made. Therefore, in presence of Section 7 of
the Act of 1982 read with clause 8 of the statutes providing for appointments on the level of All India
Competition, the reservation too cannot be restricted for the reserved categories of the domiciles of
the Union Territory of J&K alone.
14. It is significant to note here and as has been noticed in the preceding paras, that there has been
no provision for reservation in recruitment in teaching faculty either in the Act of 1982 or statutes
supra, as such, the teaching faculty in SKUAST were open for all irrespective of the category to
which a candidate would belong as it was only in the year 2020, that for the first time, SKUAST
incorporated the provisions for reservation which is under challenge in the present petition.
15. Coming to the issue of applicability of Reservation Act of 2004 to the SKUAST, a reference of
Section 2 (d) of the said Act would be appropriate which defines "available vacancies" as the
vacancies permanent or temporary, in any service and includes other posts under the Government,
Statutory Authorities Autonomous Bodies and Public Sector Undertakings owned and managed by
the Government.
A plain reading of the expression "aforesaid available vacancies" would show that the said Act of
2004 is not applicable, to the SKUAST, as such, consequently the J&K Reservation Rules, 2005
framed under Section 23 of the Act of 2004, by virtue of which the Government has fixed the
percentage of reservation for various categories will also not be applicable to the SKUAST.
16. Having regard to the aforesaid position it can safely be said that it was thus, open for the
SKUAST to provide for reservation in appointments by carrying out necessary amendment in its
statutes which has been done by virtue of impugned amendment. This was the position and this is
the position. The SKUAST could have either adopted the reservation on the pattern as provided by
the Government in Reservation Act of 2004 and the Reservation Rules of 2004 or the UGC
guidelines of 2006 on which the Act of 2019 and subsequent S.O 2515(E) dated 12.07.2019 is based.
The plea of the petitioners that SKUAST was bound to follow the percentage of reservation as
provided by the Government of Union Territory of J&K under the Act of 2004 read with Rules of
2005, therefore, cannot said to be correct position, in that, the UG guidelines of 2006 are neither
mandatory or binding upon the SKUAST or even any other State University as the same is clear
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99681848/ 6
Sohnika Rani And Ors vs Sher-E-Kashmir University Of ... on 13 December, 2023
from the language employed in the communication dated 19.10.2020 and 01.02.2021 addressed by
the UGC to all the Central/State/Deemed to be Universities and Grant in-aid Institutions wherein a
request has been made to the State Universities functioning within the State to follow the percentage
of reservation of SC/ST and OBC as prescribed by the concerned State Governments.
17. Thus, it is evident that from above that SKUAST in exercise of its powers and manner provided
under the Act of 1982 seemingly took a policy decision to adopt the reservation for appointment in
the manner providing under S.O 2515(E) dated 12.07.2019 in terms of Section 3 of the Act of 2019 as
the same is in tune with the guidelines of UGC of 2006. Therefore, even if the Act of 2019 was not
applicable to the SKUAST, yet, it has been within its powers to adopt the Reservation Policy notified
under the Act of 2019 if it was of the opinion that adoption of such a policy would give a fair and
better competition and consequently a better faculty and as such, in law, such a policy decision
cannot be interfered with by this Court in exercise of extraordinary writ jurisdiction enshrined
under Article 226 of the Constitution, that too in absence of a specific plea of mala-fide. The
impugned amendment indisputably seems to be in the public interest which in any case is not
prevail over any personal interest like that of the petitioners herein.
18. It is also significant to note here that plea of the petitioners that by virtue of impugned
amendment dated 28.09.2022 SKUAST has excludes various reserved categories including
RBA/ALC, the plea ex-facie is misconceived, in that, the SKUAST has reservation under the
categories viz SC/ST Socially and Educational Backward classes and Economically Weaker Sections
wherein RBA and ALC and sub categories of said Socially and Educationally Backward Classes. The
plea of the petitioners as well is not tenable.
19. Viewed thus, what has been observed, considered and analyzed hereinabove the petition is liable
to be dismissed.
20. Accordingly, petition is dismissed without any costs.
