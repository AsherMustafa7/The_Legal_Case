JUDGMENT
This Criminal Appeal is filed by appellant Nos.1 and 2 / accused Nos.11 and 20 respectively under
the provisions of section 21(4) of National Investigation Agency Act (hereinafter referred to as "NIA
Act"), against the order dated 29.12.2020 made in Crl.Misc.No.7268/2020 filed by accused Nos.11
and 20, on the file of XLIX Addl. City Civil & Sessions Judge and Special Court for NIA Cases,
Bengaluru (CCH-50), Bengaluru, rejecting the application for bail filed by the accused persons
under the provisions of section 439 of Cr.P.C.
2. It is the case of prosecution that one Mr.Niranjan Kumar, Inspector of Police attached to the
Economic Offence Wing, CCB, Bengaluru, gave information to Suddaguntepalya Police Station,
Mico Layout Sub-Division, Bengaluru City on 10.01.2020 at about 9.00 p.m. On the basis of the said
information, a FIR in Crime No.10/2020 came to be registered by Suddaguntepalya Police Station
against 17 accused persons for the offences punishable under the provisions of sections 153A, 120A,
120B, 122, 123, 124A & 125 of IPC and under the provisions of sections 13, 18, 19 and 20 of the
Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 (hereinafter referred to as "UA(P) Act"). On 22.01.2020,
the matter was referred to the National Investigation Agency (hereinafter referred to as "NIA").
Accordingly, on 23.01.2020, the NIA re-registered the case in RC.No.4/2020/NIA/DLI and accused
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148108327/ 2
Sri Saleem Khan vs State Of Karnataka on 21 April, 2022
No.11 was arrested on 20.01.2020 and accused No.20 was secured under body warrant on
09.03.2020. After investigation, the Investigation Officer filed the chargesheet on 13.07.2020
against accused Nos.11, 20 and others.
3. It is the further case of the prosecution that during the course of investigation, the role of the
present appellants i.e., accused Nos.11 and 12 came to light. Accordingly, the Investigation Officer
filed chargesheet against accused No.11 for the offences punishable under the provisions of sections
18, 18A, 20 and 39 of UA(P) Act and section 120B of IPC and against accused No.20 for the offence
punishable under the provisions of sections 18, 20 & 39 of UA(P) Act and section 120B of IPC.
4. The accused Nos.11 and 20 filed application under section 439 of Cr.P.C., seeking regular bail,
mainly contending that the accused No.11 has been in judicial custody since 20.01.2020 and accused
No.20 since 09.03.2020. They are totally innocent of the alleged offences and they have not
committed any offences much less the offences as mentioned in the chargesheet against them. Both
the accused persons have got valid and tenable defence to make at the trial. The accused persons
have neither directly or indirectly committed any offence nor are they involved in commission of
alleged offence. They have been falsely roped in by the police at the instigation of their ill-wishers.
Despite having taken both the accused persons to the police custody, the Investigation Officer could
not place any material on record to indicate that the accused persons / appellants have committed
the offences and they have been victimized by the police even though there are no prima facie
materials available against them. It is further contended that they have been languishing in judicial
custody for more than one year. The Investigation Officer has filed the chargesheet after completing
the investigation and further judicial remand of the appellants is not required for any other purpose.
If both the accused are detained in prison for any further time, their whole career will be spoiled in
the midst of hardcore criminals in prison. Both the accused persons have aged parents, wife and
children to look after and they are the only bread winners of their respective family and they are
hailing from respectable family and they have no bad antecedents. They have got deep roots in
society owning sufficient movable and immovable properties and they are ready to offer surety to
the satisfaction of the court and also abide by any condition imposed by the court.
5. The respondent / complainant - State has filed objections contending that there are serious
allegations of criminal conspiracy, waging war against the nation and members of terrorist
organization are being made against the accused Nos.11 and 20. There are sufficient prima facie
materials available indicating that these accused persons along with co-accused have indulged in
commission of the offences, to pose a threat to the sovereignty and integrity of the nation and also
its security. It is further contended that, during the course of investigation, the Investigating Officer
has collected prima facie materials from the accused persons containing incriminating information.
Thus, sufficient materials are secured by the Investigating Officer which prima facie indicate
involvement of the accused persons in the alleged crime. Therefore, the accused are not entitled for
bail in view of section 43-D of the UA(P) Act and the accused have not made out any extraordinary
ground to grant bail and sought to reject the application.
6. Based on the aforesaid pleadings, learned Sessions Judge framed a point for consideration, which
reads as under:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148108327/ 3
Sri Saleem Khan vs State Of Karnataka on 21 April, 2022
Whether the petitioners / accused Nos.11 and 20 are entitled for bail under Section
439 of Cr.P.C.?
7. Considering the entire material on record, trial Court recorded a finding that the accused persons
have not made out any case to grant bail as the prosecution has placed sufficient materials
indicating the involvement of the appellants / accused Nos.11 and 20 in the alleged crime. It is not in
dispute that, as per section 43-D(5) of UA(P) Act, the accused shall not be released on bail, if the
court, on perusal of report made under section 173 of Cr.P.C., is of the opinion that there are
reasonable grounds for believing that the accusation against the accused are prima facie true.
Accordingly the trial Court, by order dated 29.12.2020, rejected the application filed by both the
accused persons. Hence, the present appeal is filed by the accused persons.
8. We have heard learned counsel for the parties.
9. Sri.S.Balakrishnan, learned counsel for the appellants / accused, vehemently contended that the
impugned order passed by the trial Court rejecting the application under section 439 of Cr.P.C., is
erroneous, contrary to the material on record and cannot be sustained in law. He would further
contend that both the accused Nos.11 and 20 are the members of Al-Hind group, which is not a
banned terrorist organization, as contemplated under Schedule I of the UA(P) Act. He would further
contend that, it is alleged against them that they have attended conspiracy meetings and also Jihadi
meetings, but no date, place are shown in the chargesheet. It is further contended that both the
accused persons had gone to pistol training classes and purchased training materials like tent,
sleeping bags and organized shelters for co-accused at Gujarat and recovered knifes. He would
further contend that during the period shown in the FIR (Annexure-B) i.e., for a period of six
months from 01.07.2019 to 10.01.2020, no incident has taken place during the said period involving
accused Nos.11, 18, 19, 20, 21, 49 and 50. Eight witnesses namely CW.16, CW.17, CW.18, CW.19,
CW.20, CW.21, CW.49 and CW.50 have deposed about tent, knives, sleeping bag. CW.20 and CW.21
have deposed about Document No.30 which pertains to seizure of Maruti car and Document No.139
- one laminated student identity card, and absolutely there is no material to prove that accused are
involved in the offence as alleged by the prosecution. Learned counsel would further contend that
the accused persons are of the members of Al-Hind group and not ISIS, their stand is indicated by
the fact that the prosecution has failed to produce any iota of material to prove their stand in any
organization. To attract the provisions of section 18 of UA(P) Act, there must be some material
abetting, advising, inciting, directing any one to do a terrorist act. In the present case, the
prosecution has failed to prove anything on record against the accused persons.
10. He would further contend that under the provisions of section 20 of the UA(P) Act, punishment
for being member of terrorist gang or organization as contemplated under sections 2(1)(l) and
2(1)(m) of UA(P) Act, none of the provisions are applicable to these accused persons and the present
appellants are not linked and cannot be linked to any organization as defined either under sections
2(1)(l) and 2(1)(m) of UA(P) Act. He would further contend that, in respect of accused No.20,
Document No.41 - two Dell laptops, one black colour shoulder bag, one Samsung mobile set with
sim card have been recovered; Document No.49 discloses statements deposed by witnesses CW.19
and CW.21; Document No.55 observation mahazar witnesses CW.102 and CW.103, but no recovery
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148108327/ 4
Sri Saleem Khan vs State Of Karnataka on 21 April, 2022
was made. Document No.60 - social media account screen shot deposed by CW.90 and CW.91. No
charges are made against accused No.11 except under sections 120B of IPC and sections 18, 18A, 20,
39 of UA(P) Act and in respect of accused No.20, only under the provisions of sections 120B of IPC
and sections 18, 20 and 39 of UA(P) Act, thereby he sought to allow the appeal.
11. Learned counsel also relied upon the provisions of sections 2(k), 15, 18, 18A, 20 and 39 of UA(P)
Act. In support of his contention, learned counsel for the appellants relied upon the dictum of the
Division Bench of the Kerala High Court in the case of A.RAMACHANDRAN vs. CENTRAL
BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION & Others reported in 2015(3) KHC 678 para 36, and also on the
Division Bench judgment of Bombay High Court in Criminal Appeal No.355/2021 in the case of
IQBAL AHMED KABIR AHMED vs. THE STATE OF MAHARASHTRA dated 13.08.2021 - para 23.
12. Per contra, Sri.P.Prasanna Kumar, learned Spl. PP, while inviting the attention of this Court to
the averments made in the chargesheet which depicts that the accused Nos.11 and 20 had attended
several conspiracy meetings with accused Nos.1 and 2, it is thereby the accused are involved in the
offences made out against them in the chargesheet filed. He would further contend that accused
No.20 was accused No.8 in RC-02/2020/NIA/DLI under the Supplementary Charge Sheet under
section 173 Cr.P.C. dated 21.01.2020, wherein the present accused No.20 - Mohammed Zaid is
alleged to have been involved in commission of the offences under section 120B read with sections
465 and 471 of IPC, section 25(1A) of Arms Act besides sections 17, 18 and 39 of UA(P) Act. It is
stated that the court has not granted any bail to accused No.20.
13. He would further contend that accused No.11, as per the chargesheet allegations, is one of the
close associates of accused No.1 since 2015 and motivated and recruited accused Nos.19 and 20 to
Al-Hind Group. Further, accused No.11 attended several criminal conspiracy meetings of Al-Hind
Group with accused No.2 and other accused persons at Al-Hind Office and arranged two secret
conspiracy meetings at Kolar with accused Nos.2, 19, 20 and 21. Learned counsel would further
contend that accused No.11 regularly attended jihadi and martial arts (Taekwon-do and Kungfu)
classes at Al-Hind Office during late night hours and attended the training classes for handling of
pistol and bow and arrow, conducted by accused No.6.
14. He would further contended that accused No.20 is a close associate of accused No.11, accused
No.1 and other Al- Hind Group members. He attended several criminal conspiracy meetings of
Al-Hind Group with accused No.2 and other accused persons at Al-Hind Office, Bengaluru, Kolar,
Mysore, Hosur, Edepalyam, Salem etc., Learned counsel would further contend that accused No.20
regularly attended jihadi and martial arts (Taekwon-do and Kungfu) classes at Al-Hind Office
during late night hours and attended the training classes for handling of pistol and bow and arrow,
conducted by accused No.6. Therefore, he sought to dismiss the appeal.
15. In view of the aforesaid rival contentions urged by the learned counsel for the parties, the points
that arise for our consideration, in the present appeal, are:-
"(i) Whether the accused No.11 has made out a case to interfere with the impugned
order of rejection of bail under the provisions of section 439 of Cr.P.C.?
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148108327/ 5
Sri Saleem Khan vs State Of Karnataka on 21 April, 2022
(ii) Whether the accused No.20 has made out a case to interfere with the impugned
order of rejection of bail under the provisions of section 439 of Cr.P.C. and made out
a case to grant bail under section 439 Cr.P.C. in the facts and circumstances of the
case?"
16. We have given our anxious consideration to the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for
the parties and perused the entire material including the original records carefully.
17. It is an undisputed fact that Sri.Niranjan Kumar, Inspector of Police, CCB, Bengaluru, gave
information to Suddaguntepalya Police Station, Mico Layout Sub-Division, Bengaluru, on
10.01.2020 at about 9.00 p.m. and accordingly, Crime No.10/2020 came to be registered by the said
Police against 17 accused persons, including the present appellants, under the provisions of sections
153A, 121A, 120B, 122, 123, 124A, 125 of IPC and sections 13, 18 and 20 of UA(P) Act. It is also not in
dispute that on 23.01.2020, the National Investigation Agency re-registered the FIR in
RC.04/2020/NIA/DLI against 17 persons and others including the present appellants. It is also not
in dispute that accused No.11 was arrested on 20.01.2020 and accused No.20 was secured under
body warrant on 09.03.2020 and after investigation, Investigation Officer filed chargesheet on
13.07.2020 against the present appellants / accused Nos.11 and 20 i.e., under the provisions of
section 120B of IPC, sections 25(1B)(a) of Arms Act and sections 18, 18A, 18B, 19, 20, 38 and 39 of
the UA(P) Act against accused No.11 and under the provisions of section 120B of IPC, sections 18, 20
and 39 of the UA(P) Act against accused No.20.
18. While considering the application filed by the accused, against whom the offences under Chapter
IV and VI of the UA(P) Act have been alleged, the Court has to consider, whether there are
reasonable grounds for believing that the accusation against the accused is prima facie true. If the
Court is satisfied, after examining the material on record that there are no reasonable grounds for
believing that the accusation against the accused is prima facie true, then the accused is entitled to
bail. It is also well settled that the scope of inquiry is to decide whether prima facie material is
available against accused Nos.11 and 20 of commission of offences alleged under the provisions of
section 120B of IPC, sections 18, 18A, 18B, 19, 20, 38 and 39 of the UA(P) Act, which comes under
Chapters IV and VI of the UA(P) Act and the grounds for believing that the accusation against the
accused is prima facie true must be reasonable grounds.
19. It is also not in dispute that the Court, while examining the issue prima facie case, as
contemplated under sub-section (5) of section 43-D of UA(P) Act, is not expected to hold a mini
trial. The Court is not supposed to examine the merits and demerits of the evidence. If a chargesheet
is already filed, the Court has to examine the material forming a part of the chargesheet for deciding
the issue whether there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accusation against accused
Nos.11 and 20 is prima facie true. While doing so, the Court has to take the material in the
chargesheet as it is. Keeping the aforesaid principle in mind, let us examine the material forming
part of the chargesheet against accused Nos.11 and 20.
20. As could be seen from the chargesheet filed by the Investigation Officer of NIA against Saleem
Khan @ Kolar Saleem - accused No.11, it reads as under:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148108327/ 6
Sri Saleem Khan vs State Of Karnataka on 21 April, 2022
"i. He is one of the close associates of Mehboob Pasha (A-1) since 2015. He motivated
and recruited Mohammed Zaid (A-20) and Syed Fasiur Rahman (A-19) to Al-Hind
group.
ii. He attended several criminal conspiracy meetings of Al-Hind group with Khaja
Moideen (A-
2) and other accused persons at A1 Hind Office. He arranged two secret conspiracy
meetings at Kolar with Khaja Moideen (A-2), Syed Fasiur Rehman (A-
19), Mohammed Zaid (A-20) and Sadiq Bhasha (A-
21).
iii. He regularly attended jihadi and martial arts (Taekwon-do and Kungfu) classes at A1-Hind office
on late night hours. He attended the training classes for handling of Pistol and Bow and Arrows
conducted by Jaffar Ali (A-6).
iv. He purchased training materials such as tents, sleeping bag knives etc for the use of Al-Hind
group. The same were recovered and seized from his house.
v. As per the direction of Khaja Moideen (A-2) and Mehboob Pasha (A-1), he visited Gujarat twice
and arranged shelter for Al-Hind group members at Jambusar, Gujarat through his friend.
vi. Thereby, accused Saleem Khan(A-11) committed offences punishable under section 120b of IPC,
1860 and sections 18, 18A, 20 and 39 of the UA(P) Act 1967."
21. The chargesheet is filed by the Investigation Officer of NIA against Mohammed Zaid - accused
No.20, it reads as under:-
"i. He is one of the close associates of Saleem Khan (A-11), Mehboob Pasha (A-1) and
other Al- Hind group members. He attended several criminal conspiracy meetings of
al-Hind group with Khaja Moideen (A-2) and other accused persons at Al-Hind
Office, Bengaluru, Kolar, Mysore, Hosur, Edepalyam, Salem etc., ii. He regularly
attended jihadi and martial arts i.e. taekwon-do and Kungfu classes at Al-Hind office
during late night hours. He attended the classes for handling of pistol, Bow and
Arrows, conducted by Jaffar Ali (A-6).
iii. He assisted Mehboob Pasha (A.1) for contacting unknown ISIS handler through
dark Web. He also taught Dark Web operations to Syed Ali @ Anis (A-14) for
assisting KhajaMoideen (A-2) to contact ISIS handler, Bhai (A-23). He along with
Abdul Matheen Ahmed Taahaa (A-12) prepared fake Aadhar Card for Al-Hind group
members.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148108327/ 7
Sri Saleem Khan vs State Of Karnataka on 21 April, 2022
Thereby, accused Mohammed Zaid (A-20) was part of the terror group, and was
involved in furthering the activities of ISIS in India and assisted Mehboob pasha(A-1)
in communicating with the ISIS handler through dark web and thus, committed
offences punishable under section 120B of IPC, 1860 and sections 18, 20 and 39 of
the UA(P) Act 1967."
22. A careful examination of the materials forming part of the chargesheet clearly depicts that the
allegations against accused No.11 are that he is a member of Al-Hind Group and attended several
criminal conspiracy meetings as well as jihadi meetings and underwent pistol and bow and arrows
training classes, purchased training materials such as tents, sleeping bag, knives and organized
shelters for Al-Hind Group members at Gujarat. Mere attending meetings and becoming Member of
Al-Hind Group, which is not a banned organization as contemplated under the Schedule of UA(P)
Act and attending jihadi meetings, purchasing training materials and organizing shelters for
co-members is not an offence as contemplated under the provisions of section 2(k) or section 2(m)
of UA(P) Act. Admittedly, in the present case, in order to attract section 2(k), in the absence of any
allegation of the offences under section 15 of the UA(P) Act, section 18 of the UA(P) Act would not
arise. Section 18A deals with imparting training in terrorism and section 20 deals with punishment
for being member of terrorist gang or organization. In the present case, the prosecution has not
produced any material, as could be seen on examination of the chargesheet, against accused No.11
about his involvement in terrorist act or being member of terrorist gang or organization or training
terrorism. Admittedly, Al-Hind Group is not a terrorist organization as contemplated under section
39 of the UA(P) Act, thereby the prosecution has failed to prove the prima facie case for rejection of
bail against accused No.11. Therefore, the trial Court is not justified in rejecting the bail application
filed by accused No.11.
23. It is well settled that, in view of the provision of section 43D of the UA(P) Act, it is necessary to
strove to strike a balance between the mandate under Section 43D on the hand and the rights of the
accused on the other. To decide as to whether the accusation in such cases is prima facie true, the
following circumstances would provide adequate guidance for the Court to form an opinion, which
read as under:-
1. Whether the accused is/are associated with any organization, which is prohibited
through an order passed under the provisions of the act?
2. Whether the accused was convicted of the offences involving such crimes, or
terrorist activities, or though acquitted on technical grounds; was held to be
associated with terrorist activities?
3. Whether any explosive material, of the category used in the commission of the
crime, which gave rise to the prosecution; was recovered from, or at the instance of
the accused?
4. Whether any eye witness or a mechanical device, such as CC camera, had indicated
the involvement, or presence of the accused, at or around the scene of occurrence?
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148108327/ 8
Sri Saleem Khan vs State Of Karnataka on 21 April, 2022
and
5. Whether the accused was/were arrested, soon after the occurrence, on the basis of
the information, or clues available with the enforcement or investigating agencies?
24. Admittedly, in the present case, the prosecution has not proved that accused No.11 has
associated himself with any organization which is prohibited or barred under the provisions of the
UA(P) Act. Admittedly, he is a Member of Al-Hind Group. It is not a prohibited organization under
the Schedule of the UA(P) Act, 1967 and the chargesheet material does not depict that he was
convicted for the offences involved or crimes or terrorist activities and the prosecution has also not
proved whether the accused has used any explosive material of the category used in the commission
of the crime or recovered from him nor the chargesheet depicts any eyewitness or mechanical device
such as CCTV, camera indicating the involvement of accused No.11, let alone scene of occurrence as
shown in the chargesheet. On careful examination of the material forming part of the chargesheet,
there are no reasonable grounds for believing the accusation against the accused No.11 prima facie
true. In the absence of any prima facie case, restrictions imposed by sub-section (5) of section 43-D
per se do not prevent a Constitutional Court from granting bail on the grounds of violation of part
III of the Constitution. Our view is fortified by the dictum of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, in an
identical case i.e., in the case of THWAHA FASAL vs. UNION OF INDIA reported in+ 2021 SCC
OnLine SC 1000, in paras 27, 42, 43, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as under:-
27. "Now we turn to the material against the accused nos.1 and 2 in the charge sheet.
In paragraph 18 of the charge sheet, the charges against accused nos.1 and 2 have
been set out. Paragraph 18.1 to 18.17 reads thus:
"18.1 That, accused A-1, A-2 and A-3 had, knowingly and intentionally, associated
themselves and acted as members of Communist Party of India (Maoist) in short CPI

Schedule to the Act.
18.2 That, accused A-1, A-2 and A- 3 knowingly and intentionally attended various

Sri Saleem Khan vs State Of Karnataka on 21 April, 2022
18.4 That, the accused A-1 had knowingly possessed documents supporting and
published by CPI (Maoist) with the intention of supporting the proscribed terrorist
organisation and propagating its violent extremist ideology.
18.5 That, the accused A-2 had knowingly possessed documents supporting and
published by CPI (Maoist) with the intention of supporting the proscribed terrorist
organisation and propagating its violent extremist ideology.
18.6 That, the accused A-3, on seeing the Police party, had fled from the scene and
managed to escape owing to his membership in the proscribed terrorist organisation
CPI (Maoist). He is still absconding.
18.7 That, A-1 had knowingly and with the intention of aiding CPI (Maoist) possessed
on his digital devices, materials supporting the proscribed terrorist organisation and
its violent extremist ideology, for the purpose of spreading such ideology.
18.8 That, the materials found during the house search of A-2 such as notices,
pamphlets, books, hand written notes, banners besides digital devices and
publications were knowingly and intentionally possessed by A-2 for supporting the
proscribed terrorist organisation CPI (Maoist) 18.9 That, in pursuance of the
conspiracy to further the activities of CPI (Maoist), during the house search of A-2, he
had, intentionally and knowingly, raised slogans, supporting the ideology of the
proscribed terrorist organisation.
18.10 That, in furtherance of the conspiracies with co- accused and others, A-2 had
knowingly and intentionally prepared cloth banners supporting secession f Kashmir
from the Indian Union, for displaying at public places on behalf of CPI (Maoist) and
thus committed unlawful activity as defined under the Unlawful Activities
(Prevention) Act.
18.11 That A-1, knowingly and intentionally participated in the meetings of the
proscribed terrorist organisation CPI (Maoist) with professional members including
A-3 and had prepared notes that were maintained by A-1.
18.12 That, A-1 and A-3 knowingly and intentionally conspired and conduced secret
meetings at the rented accommodation of A-1 in Kannur district, for furthering the
objectives of the proscribed terrorist organisation CPI (Maoist).
18.13 That, the accused A-1, had knowingly and intentionally propagated the Maoist
ideology amongst his close friends with the intention of radicalizing and recruiting

Sri Saleem Khan vs State Of Karnataka on 21 April, 2022
furthering the objectives of the proscribed terrorist organisation CPI (Maoist).
18.15 That, the accused A-3 and other underground professional members of CPI
(Maoist) had radicalised and recruited A-1 and A-2, besides others, into the
proscribed terrorist organisation, with the intention of furthering the activities of CPI
(Maoist).
18.16 Therefore, Allan Shuaib @ Mamu @ Mammu @ Vivek (A-1) committed
offences punishable under Section 120B of the Indian Penal Code besides sections 38
and 39 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967.
18.17 Therefore, Thwaha Fasal @ Thaha @ Fasal @ Kishan (A-2) committed offences
punishable under section 120B of the Indian Penal Code besides sections 13, 38 and
39 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967.
42. As held in the case of K.A. Najeeb (supra), the stringent restrictions imposed by
sub-section(5) of Section 43D, do not negate the power of Constitutional Court to
grant bail keeping in mind violation of Part III of the Constitution. It is not disputed
that the accused no.1 is taking treatment for a psychological disorder. The accused
no.1 is a student of law. Moreover, 92 witnesses have been cited by the prosecution.
Even assuming that some of the witnesses may be dropped at the time of trial, there
is no possibility of the trial being concluded in a reasonable time as even charges have
not been framed. There is no minimum punishment prescribed for the offences under
Sections 38 and 39 of the 1967 Act and the punishment can extend to 10 years or only
fine or with both. Hence, depending upon the evidence on record and after
consideration of relevant factors, the accused can be let off even on fine. As regards
the offence under Section 13 alleged against accused no.2, the maximum punishment
is of imprisonment of 5 years or with fine or with both. The accused no.2 has been in
custody for more than 570 days.
43. It is true that without recording a satisfaction as contemplated by sub-section (5)
of Section 43D, the order granting bail to the accused no.1 could not have been
confirmed by the High Court. However, we have examined the material against both
the accused in the context of sub-section (5) of Section 43D. Taking the materials
forming part of the charge sheet as it is, the accusation against both the accused of
the commission of offences punishable under Sections 38 and 39 does not appear to
be prima facie true."
The said material fact has not been considered by the trial Court while rejecting the bail application,
filed by accused No.11, under section 439 Cr.P.C., thereby accused No.11 is entitled to bail.
25. In so far as accused No.20 - Mohammed Zaid, while examining the material forming part of the
chargesheet which clearly indicates that he is associated with accused No.1 for contacting unknown
ISIS handler through Dark Web. (ISIS is a banned organization as contemplated under the Schedule
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148108327/ 11
Sri Saleem Khan vs State Of Karnataka on 21 April, 2022
of UA(P) Act.) He also taught Dark Web operations to Syed Ali @ Anis - accused No.14 for assisting
Khaja Moideen - accused No.2 to contact ISIS handler, Bhai - accused No.23. He along with Abdul
Matheen Ahmed Taasha - accused No.12 prepared fake Aadhar Card for Al-Hind group members,
thereby, accused No.20 was part of the terror group and was involved in furthering the activities of
ISIS in India and assisted Mehboob Pasha - accused No.1 in communicating with the ISIS handler
through dark web and thus, committed offences punishable under section 120B of IPC and sections
18, 20 and 39 of the UA(P) Act.
26. It is also relevant to note, at this stage, that accused No.20 was also an accused in FIR
No.RC-02/2020/NIA/DLI filed by the National Investigation Agency, New Delhi, under the
Supplementary Charge Sheet filed wherein the present accused No.20 - Mohammed Zaid was
accused No.8 in the said case and the charge against him in the said case was also under section
120B read with sections 465 and 471 of IPC, section 25(1A) of Arms Act besides sections 17, 18 and
39 of UA(P) Act. Admittedly, it is brought to our notice that in the said case also, he was not granted
bail.
27. The material on record clearly depicts that there is sufficient material against accused No.20 -
Mohammed Zaid. In the chargesheet it is projected active participation of the appellant / accused
No.20 in the offences. Call details between accused No.20 with other accused persons from his
mobile bearing No.7022664577 read as under:-
Accused No. Mobile No. No.of calls
Accused No.11/Saleem Khan 8151997123 397
Accused No.19/Faziur Rehman 9535548323 191
Accused No.8/Imran Khan 8861882487 22
Accused No.9/mohammed Haneef 7349619220 13
Accused No.1/Mehaboob Pasha 8553462902 67

28. Considering the material on record, including the chargesheet filed against the accused No.20 by
the Investigation Officer, this Court is of the considered opinion that there are reasonable grounds
for believing that the accusation against accused No.20 - Mohammed Zaid is prima facie true,
thereby he is not entitled for grant of bail in view of sub-section (5) of section 43-D of UA(P) Act,
1967. The scope of inquiry to decide whether prima facie material is available against accused for
commission of offences alleged under Chapters IV and VI of the UA(P) Act, the Court while
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148108327/ 12
Sri Saleem Khan vs State Of Karnataka on 21 April, 2022
examining the issue of prima facie case as required by sub-section (5) of section 43-D of UA(P) Act,
is not expected to hold a mini trial and the Court is not supposed to examine the merits and
demerits of the evidence. If a chargesheet is already filed, the Court has to examine the material
forming a part of the chargesheet for deciding the issue whether there are reasonable grounds for
believing that the accusation against accused No.20 is prima facie true.
29. As already stated supra, the chargesheet filed against accused No.20 clearly depicts his active
participation in the offence as a Member of terrorist gang and conspiracy with other accused
persons for criminal act and violent acts thereby he was in contact with other accused persons
including Mehboob Pasha - accused No.1 for contacting unknown ISIS handler through dark web,
thereby accused No.20 is not entitled to the discretionary relief of bail under section 439 of Cr.P.C.
The trial Court is justified in rejecting the bail application of accused No.20.
30. The judgment relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellants in the case of
A.RAMACHANDRAN vs. CENTRAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION & Others reported in 2015(3)
KHC 678 has no application to the case of accused No.20 - Mohammed Zaid. In view of sufficient
material against him in the chargesheet filed, as he is involved in the terrorist organization ISIS and
he is already involved in another case stated supra which attract terrorist activities and he is
involved in teaching dark web operations to other accused persons, thereby, the said judgment has
no application to the facts of case of accused No.20.
31. In so far as the judgment of Bombay High Court relied by the learned counsel for the appellants
in the case of IQBAL AHMED KABIR AHMED vs. THE STATE OF MAHARASHTRA dated
13.08.2021 in Criminal Appeal No.355/2021, in para 23, enunciating the import of the word "prima
facie" coupled with the word "true" as contemplated under the provisions of section 43D(5) of UA(P)
Act, on examination of the material forming part of the chargesheet, there are reasonable grounds
for believing that the accusation against accused No.20 is prima facie true, thereby the said
judgment is also not application to the facts of the present case.
32. For the reasons stated above, the point No.1 raised in the present appeal is answered in the
affirmative, holding that accused No.11 - Saleem Khan has made out a case for grant of bail. Point
No.2 is answered in negative holding that accused No.20 - Mohammed Zaid has not made out any
ground to interfere with the impugned order passed by the trial Court rejecting the application for
bail under the provisions of section 439 of Cr.P.C.
33. In view of the above, we pass the following:-
ORDER (I) Criminal Appeal is allowed-in-part. (II) Criminal Appeal filed by
appellant No.1 / accused No.11 is hereby allowed.
(III) Criminal Appeal filed by appellant No.2 / accused No.20 is hereby dismissed,
confirming the order dated 29.12.2020 in Crl.Misc.No.7268/2020 passed by the
