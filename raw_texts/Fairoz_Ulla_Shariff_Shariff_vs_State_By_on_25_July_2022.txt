THIS WRIT PETITION COMING ON FOR PRELIMINARY HEARING
THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:
-4-
WP No. 5415 of 2022
ORDER
Heard Sri.Mohammed Tahir, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners and Sri. K.S.Abhijith, the
learned High Court Government Pleader appearing for respondent No.1.
2. The petitioners are before this Court calling in question the proceedings in Crime No.103/2019,
registered for offences punishable under Sections 188, 141, 143, 145 and 147 read with Section 149 of
IPC.
3. The learned counsel for the petitioners would submit that the issue in the case at hand stands
covered by the judgment rendered by the Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in Crl.P.No.2896/2022,
disposed of on 20.06.2022, wherein this Court has held as follows:
" 2. Learned counsel appearing for the petitioners submits that the issue in this
petition stands covered by the judgment rendered by the Co-ordinate Bench of this
Court in W.P.No.13328/2018, which submission is accepted by the learned HCGP
appearing for the respondent.
3. In the light of there being no dispute with regard to the fact that the issue stands
covered by the judgment rendered by the Co- ordinate Bench of this Court, I deem it
appropriate to close the proceedings by following the judgment so rendered by the
Co-ordinate Bench of this Court. The Co-ordinate Bench has held as follows:
4. The case of the prosecution in brief is as follows:
The Commissioner of Police, Mangalore City promulgated the prohibitory order from
6.00 a.m. to 6.00 p.m. of 08.12.2014 and prohibited assembling of five or more
persons in Mangalore city. The accused persons violating such prohibitory order
organized procession consisting 2000 persons belonging to Hindu Organization.
When the complainant and his colleagues tried to prevent the accused from
proceeding with the procession advising that, that is likely to create communal
tensions, the accused obstructed the police from discharging their duties, crashed the
barricades erected at the scene of offence, damaged the police vehicles and caused
injuries to CWS.5 to 8.

5. On receipt of charge sheet, the Magistrate by order dated 24.10.2016 took
cognizance of the offences punishable under Sections 143, 144, 145, 147, 148, 153,
188, 332, 353 of IPC and Sections 2(a) and 2(b) of the KPDLP Act and summoned the
accused to face trial for the said offences.
6. The petitioners seek quashing of Annexures-A to Annexures-D on the ground that
the prime offence was under Section 188 of IPC and Section 195 of Cr.P.C. bars taking
cognizance of such offences, except upon the complaint as required under Section
200 of Cr.P.C, therefore the whole proceedings are without jurisdiction.
7. As rightly pointed out, Section 188 of IPC is the main offence. The other offences
flow from that. Section 195(1)(a) of Cr.P.C. bars the Court to take cognizance of such
offence unless in accordance with the procedure laid down therein.
Section 195(1)(a) reads as follows:
"195. Prosecution for contempt of lawful authority of public servants, for offences
against public justice and for offences relating to documents given in evidence (1) No
Court shall take cognizance-
(a)(i) of any offence punishable under sections 172 to 188 (both inclusive) of the
Indian Penal Code, 1860 (45 of 1860); or
(ii) of any abetment of, or attempt to commit, such offence; or
(iii) of any criminal conspiracy to commit such offence, except on the complaint in
writing of the public servant concerned or of some other public servant to whom he is
administratively subordinate;"
8. Reading of the above provision makes it clear that to take cognizance there should be a written
complaint and such complaint should be filed either by the officer issuing such promulgation order
or the officer above his rank. In the case on hand, as per the complaint itself, prohibitory order
under Section 144 of IPC was promulgated by the Commissioner of Police and not the complainant.
9. Further Section 2(d) of Cr.P.C. defines complaint as allegations made orally or in writing to the
Magistrate with a view to the Magistrate taking action on such complaint under the Code. Only on
such complaint, the Magistrate can take cognizance under Section 190(1)(a) of Cr.P.C. Thereafter
the procedure prescribed under Section 200 of Cr.P.C. has to be followed. Therefore the first
information report, charge sheet and the order taking cognizance on such charge sheet are without
jurisdiction.
10. Then the question is Annexures-A to D get vitiated only so far as the offence under Section 188 of
IPC. In para 8 of the judgment in State of Karnataka v. Hemareddy, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held
as follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/142587082/ 5
Fairoz Ulla Shariff @ Shariff vs State By on 25 July, 2022
"8. We agree with the view expressed by the learned Judge and hold that in cases
where in the course of the same transaction an offence for which no complaint by a
Court is necessary under Section 195(1)(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and an
offence for which a complaint of a Court is necessary under that sub-section, are
committed, it is not possible to split up and hold that the prosecution of the accused
for the offences not mentioned in Section 195(1)(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure
should be upheld."
(Emphasis supplied)
11. Reading of the above judgment makes it clear that if the offences form part of same transaction
of the offences contemplated under Section 195(1) of Cr.P.C, then it is not possible to split up and
hold that prosecution of the accused for the other offences should be upheld. Therefore the entire
complaint, first information report, charge sheet and the order taking cognizance are liable to be
quashed. The petition is allowed.
The impugned first information report, complaint, the charge sheet and the proceedings in
C.C.No.3660/2016 are hereby quashed."
4. For the aforesaid reasons, the following:
ORDER i. Criminal Petition is allowed. ii. Proceedings in C.C.No.388/2014 on the file
of the II Additional Civil Judge and J.M.F.C., Nanjangud, Mysore, stand quashed."
4. The learned HCGP would not dispute the aforesaid order and the fact that it covers
the case at hand on all its fours.
- 10 -
5. In the light of the order passed by the Co-ordinate Bench of this Court (supra) and for the reasons
aforementioned, the following:
ORDER
(i) The Writ Petition is allowed.
(ii) The FIR dated 19.12.2019 i.e., Crime No.103/2019, the charge sheet dated
06.08.2020 and the proceeding in C.C.No.688/2020 pending on the file of the
Hon'ble J.M.F.C. (II Court), Mysore, stand quashed.
