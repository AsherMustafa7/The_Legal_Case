ordering Dr.N.Surbala Devi, Associate Professor, College of

Principal, College of Nursing in addition to her normal duties with
effect from 1.3.2022, Ibeyaima Devi has filed W.P.(C) No.173 of
2022.
4. Since all three writ petitions are interlinked with
each other, they were heard together and disposed of by this
common order.
5. For the sake of convenience, the parties are
referred to as per their array in W.P.(C) No.167 of 2022. For
clarity, Dr.N.Surbala Devi is referred as "petitioner" and Ibeyaima
Devi is referred as "third respondent" hereinafter.
Facts:
WP(C) No.167 of 2022, WP(C) No. 173 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 528 of 2021 Page |5
6. The case of the petitioner is that she obtained her B.Sc. (Nursing) degree from the University of
Calcutta in the year 1989 and was initially appointed as Nursing Sister in the Health Department,
Manipur, vide order dated 12.7.1989. In the meantime, she obtained her M.Sc. (Nursing) from Tamil
Nadu Dr. M.G.R. Medical University, Madras in the year 1996 and the Health Department,
Government of Manipur, vide order dated 3.5.2003, utilized the services of the petitioner as Sister
Tutor at GNM School of Nursing, Lamphel. On the other hand, the third respondent was initially
appointed as Sister Tutor of the Female Health Worker Training School, Churachandpur on adhoc
basis vide order dated 29.3.1984 and her service was regularized vide order dated 24.5.1986 and,
thereafter, she was transferred to GNM School of Nursing, Lamphel vide order dated 4.8.1990.
7. In course of time, GNM School of Nursing was upgraded as College of Nursing in the year 2012
and upon upgradation, the Health Department issued an order dated 7.9.2012, by which, among
others, the third respondent was utilized as Associate Professor in the College, while the petitioner
was utilized as Lecturer in the College. On 19.4.2013, the Director of Health Services, submitted a
proposal for post creation, framing of recruitment rules and appointment of qualified faculty
members in the College of Nursing to the WP(C) No.167 of 2022, WP(C) No. 173 of 2022 and WP(C)
No. 528 of 2021 Page |6 Principal Secretary, Health and Family Welfare, Government of Manipur.
In the meantime, the Secretary, Indian Nursing Council, vide letter dated 30.5.2013, informed the
Principal of the College of Nursing the staffing pattern of INC for collegiate programme, thereby
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9768240/ 4
Dr. N. Surbala Devi vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 24 February, 2023
directed to follow the staffing pattern prescribed by the Council from time to time. The staffing
pattern relaxed by INC till 2012 was extended upto April, 2014 i.e. 2013- 2014 academic year.
8. By cancelling the utilization order dated 7.9.2012, the Directorate issued an order dated 16.7.2013
wherein the third respondent continued to be utilized as Associate Professor in the College and at
the same time, after consideration of her educational qualification and other criteria, the petitioner
was utilized as Associate Professor in the College with effect from 16.7.2013. Thereafter, vide order
dated 1.8.2014, the substantive post of Nursing Sister held by the petitioner and the substantive post
of Sister Tutor held by the third respondent were re-designated as Associate Professor, College of
Nursing and they were absorbed thereto and in the order dated 1.8.2014, the name of the petitioner
appeared at Serial No.3 and the name of the third respondent appeared at Serial No.5. Thereafter,
the Health Department issued an order dated 30.1.2015 notifying the WP(C) No.167 of 2022, WP(C)
No. 173 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 528 of 2021 Page |7 concurrence of the Department of Personnel,
Government of Manipur to the earlier order dated 1.8.2014.
9. According to the petitioner, the relevant staffing pattern of INC applicable at the time of issuance
of the orders dated 1.8.2014 and 30.1.2015 was the staffing pattern communicated by the Secretary,
INC vide letter dated 30.5.2013 and the relaxed staffing pattern of INC till 2012 was extended only
upto April, 2014 and the same was no longer applicable when orders dated 1.8.2014 and 30.1.2015
were issued and also communicated the applicable staffing pattern for collegiate programme
mentioning the qualifications and experience for the post of Associate Professor and Assistant
Professor.
10. The third respondent obtained M.Sc. (N) degree in the year 2011 and when she was absorbed as
Associate Professor, College of Nursing, vide order dated 1.8.2014, she had only three years'
experience after M.Sc. (N) and, as such, she was not all eligible to be appointed as Associate
Professor and she was just merely eligible for appointment to the post of Assistant Professor. Thus,
the absorption/appointment of the third respondent to the post of Associate Professor in the College
of Nursing, Medical Directorate, Manipur is illegal and void ab- WP(C) No.167 of 2022, WP(C) No.
173 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 528 of 2021 Page |8 initio, as she did not possess the eligibility criteria
prescribed by the INC.
11. The case of the third respondent is that she was initially appointed as Sister Tutor at the School
of GNM under the Department of Health, Government of Manipur on 24.5.1986. In the final
inter-se seniority list of Sister Tutors, Public Health Nurses and Public Health Nurse Instructor
notified on 30.11.2011, her name appeared at Serial No.4 in respect of the post of Sister Tutor
showing her date of appointment as 24.5.1986 and the date of birth as 1.9.1957. On 7.9.2012, the
petitioner was utilized as Associate Professor in the College of Nursing which was upgraded from the
School of GNM. On 1.8.2014, the service of the petitioner was absorbed as Associate Professor at the
College of Nursing by re-designating her post as Associate Professor. On 3.9.2020, while publishing
the tentative seniority list of the Associate Professors of the College of Nursing, her name appeared
at Serial No.4. Being unsatisfied, she submitted an objection to the said tentative seniority list.
However, without considering the objection properly, the tentative seniority list was finalized on
19.4.2021. Challenging the same, the third respondent filed W.P.(C) No.528 of 2021. While the said
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9768240/ 5
Dr. N. Surbala Devi vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 24 February, 2023
writ petition was pending, on 26.2.2022, the petitioner was given the charge of Principal of the
above said WP(C) No.167 of 2022, WP(C) No. 173 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 528 of 2021 Page |9
College by the Special Secretary, Health & Family Welfare, Government of Manipur. Assailing the
order dated 26.2.2022, the third respondent has filed W.P.(C) No.173 of 2022.
12. Resisting the writ petitions, the respondent State and the Health and Family Welfare
Department filed affidavit-in- opposition stating that as per the letter dated 30.5.2013 of the INC,
the qualification and experience for the post of Associate Professor, College of Nursing, is M.Sc. (N)
with 8 years' experience after M.Sc. (N) including 5 years teaching experience. The third respondent
at the time of her initial date of utilization as Faculty Member in the College of Nursing on 7.9.2012,
she had only 1 year experience after passing M.Sc. (N), as she passed M.Sc. (N) only in 2011.
Therefore, the third respondent did not possess the requisite experience for the post of Associate
Professor, College of Nursing prescribed by the INC at the time of her utilization as Faculty Member.
13. It is stated that even at the time of re-designating and absorption of the third respondent vide
order dated 1.8.2014, she has not completed 8 years' experience after M.Sc. (N) as required under
the guidelines/instructions of the INC. The matter relating to fixation of final seniority list of
Associate Professor, College of Nursing was referred to the Department of Personnel, WP(C) No.167
of 2022, WP(C) No. 173 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 528 of 2021 P a g e | 10 Government of Manipur
and the Department of Personnel recommended the petitioner for appointment to the post of
Associate Professor and the inter-se-seniority of Kh. Ratna Devi, Nandarani Devi, the third
respondent and Nalinibala Devi be fixed as per the Medical Directorate Memorandum dated
3.10.2021. Accordingly, the final seniority list of Associate Professors, College of Engineering, was
notified vide notice dated 19.4.2021 and, as such, there is no illegality or irregularity in the seniority
list dated 19.4.2021. Though the petitioner was initially appointed to a non-teaching post of Nursing
Sister, she was utilized as Sister Tutor, a teaching post and, accordingly, her teaching experience
after M.Sc. (N) has been counted for the purpose of appointment as Associate Professor and fixation
of seniority. The petitioner being senior most Associate Professor serving in the College of Nursing,
she has been allowed to hold the charge of Principal, College of Nursing, in addition to her normal
duties with effect from 1.3.2022 vide order dated 26.2.2022 and, as such, there is no illegality in the
order dated 26.2.2022.
Arguments:
14. Assailing the impugned orders dated 1.8.2014 and 30.1.2015, learned counsel for
the petitioner submitted that the petitioner has been continuously utilized as a
teaching faculty as WP(C) No.167 of 2022, WP(C) No. 173 of 2022 and WP(C) No.
528 of 2021 P a g e | 11 Sister Tutor in the GNM School of Nursing since 3.5.2003.
Though the petitioner was initially utilized as Lecturer in the College of Nursing, vide order dated
7.9.2012, the same has been cancelled and superseded by the order dated 16.7.2013, wherein she has
been utilized as Associate Professor after due consideration of her educational qualification, work
experience and teaching experience. He would submit that there is no difference between the pay
scale of the petitioner and the third respondent prior to their absorption as Associate Professor in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9768240/ 6
Dr. N. Surbala Devi vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 24 February, 2023
the College vide order dated 1.8.2014.
15. The learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted that the staffing pattern relaxed by the
INC till 2012 was extended upto April, 2014 and at the time of issuance of the order dated 1.8.2014,
the staffing pattern communicated by the INC was in force and, therefore, the third respondent was
not at all eligible for absorption as Associate Professor. Contrary to the allegations of the third
respondent, the order dated 1.8.2014 was illegally issued in favour of the third respondent. Further,
the absorption of the third respondent as Associate Professor, College of Nursing, vide order dated
1.8.2014 read with order dated 30.1.2015, is patently illegal and void ab-initio. As the third
respondent was at most eligible for the post of Assistant Professor, a post of Assistant Professor
must have been created WP(C) No.167 of 2022, WP(C) No. 173 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 528 of 2021
P a g e | 12 in the College of Nursing or her substantive post must have been upgraded as Assistant
Professor instead of Associate Professor.
16. The learned counsel for the petitioner then submitted that there is no illegality in the impugned
final seniority list published vide notification dated 19.4.2021. The impugned final seniority list
clearly mentions that the petitioner was the only person who fulfilled the eligibility criteria
prescribed by INC. The third respondent has nowhere refuted the fact that she did not fulfill the
eligibility criteria laid down in the staffing pattern communicated by the INC vide letter dated
30.5.2013. Further, the third respondent was not eligible to be utilized as Associate Professor in the
College of Nursing for the reason that she did not fulfill the eligibility criteria prescribed by the INC.
In fact, the third respondent did not fulfill the eligibility criteria when the orders dated 1.8.2014 and
30.1.2015 were issued. On the other hand, the petitioner was eligible for utilization as Lecturer when
the order dated 7.9.2012 was issued and as Associate Professor when orders dated 16.7.2013,
1.8.2014 and 30.01.2015 were issued and the INC has nothing to do with appointments in Nursing
Colleges/Institutions. Therefore, there is no illegality in placing the petitioner at Serial No.1 in the
impugned final seniority list, which was done after due examination of the relevant/applicable INC
staffing pattern.
WP(C) No.167 of 2022, WP(C) No. 173 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 528 of 2021 P a g e | 13
17. Coming to the challenge made to the order dated 1.8.2014 and 30.1.2015 as regard the
absorption of the third respondent as Associate Professor, the learned counsel for the petitioner
argued that the upgradation of the third respondent who was otherwise not eligible for the post of
Associate Professor is illegal and not permissible in the service jurisprudence. At most, the third
respondent is eligible for the post of Assistant Professor and, in fact, in the proposal submitted by
the Director of Health Services vide letter dated 19.4.2013, the third respondent was proposed for
absorption as Assistant Professor in consideration of her qualification and experience. However,
when the impugned order dated 1.8.2014 was issued, she was illegally absorbed as Associate
Professor. Therefore, the said order is liable to be set aside in respect of the third respondent.
18. Per contra, the learned counsel for the third respondent submitted that the acts of the official
respondents in issuing the impugned notice dated 19.4.2021 fixing the seniority of the third
respondent, petitioner as well as other faculty members of the College of Nursing by placing the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9768240/ 7
Dr. N. Surbala Devi vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 24 February, 2023
name of the petitioner and one Shanti Devi above the name of the third respondent by giving
reasons according to their choice, are illegal, unlawful, arbitrary and discriminatory to the extent
that WP(C) No.167 of 2022, WP(C) No. 173 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 528 of 2021 P a g e | 14 they
have deprived the third respondent of her fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution of
India. The said acts are also in total violation of the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.
Therefore, the official respondents are required to be directed to rectify the seniority list by placing
the name of the third respondent above the name of the petitioner and Shanti Devi to meet the ends
of justice.
19. Assailing the impugned order dated 26.2.2022, the learned counsel for the third respondent
submitted that pending W.P.(C) No.528 of 2021 filed by the third respondent challenging the
seniority list dated 19.4.2021, the Special Secretary (Health and Family Welfare), Government of
Manipur, issued an order dated 26.2.2022, whereby the petitioner, who is not eligible to hold the
post of Principal, was allowed to hold the charge of the said post in addition to her normal duties
with effect from 1.3.2022. The impugned in-charge appointment order dated 26.2.2022 is illegal for
the reason that the said order is in total contradiction to the affidavit-in-opposition of the State
Government filed in W.P.(C) No.637 of 2020, wherein the State Government has submitted clearly
that the utilization period of the private respondent therein as Lecturer in the College with effect
from 3.5.2003 cannot be treated as teaching experience. WP(C) No.167 of 2022, WP(C) No. 173 of
2022 and WP(C) No. 528 of 2021 P a g e | 15
20. According to the learned counsel for the third respondent, as per settled law, the Government is
not permitted to take a stand which is contradictory to its own earlier conduct. He would submit
that in view of the stand taken by the Government in the earlier affidavit-in-opposition, the
petitioner is not at all eligible to hold the post of Principal of the College. However, by arbitrary
exercise of power, the official respondents have allowed her to hold the charge of Principal of the
said College without any authority of law. The action of the official respondents also violates the
public trust doctrine and that the period of utilization of the service of the petitioner as Lecturer in
the College shall not be counted as a teaching experience. Hence, the impugned order dated
26.2.2022 is not at all sustainable in the eyes of law and the same is liable to be quashed.
21. In reply, Mr. S. Nepolean, the learned Government Advocate appearing for the official
respondents submitted that firstly the affidavit-in-opposition filed by the State respondent in
W.P.(C) No.637 of 2020 was prior to the decision/recommendation of the Department of Personnel
in the matter relating to fixation of final seniority list of Associate Professor, College of Nursing.
Therefore, the final seniority list of Associate Professor was finalized and published only on WP(C)
No.167 of 2022, WP(C) No. 173 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 528 of 2021 P a g e | 16 19.4.2021 i.e. after
the decision/recommendation of the Department of Personnel. Thus, the affidavit-in-opposition
filed by the State respondent in W.P.(C) No.637 of 2020 was through bona fide mistake, but not
intentional. He would submit that the final seniority list of Associate Professors was notified vide
impugned letter dated 19.4.2021 and, as such, there is no illegality in it.
22. The learned Government Advocate further submitted that the College of Nursing was established
with effect from 7.9.2012 by upgrading the erstwhile GNM School and necessary posts for the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9768240/ 8
Dr. N. Surbala Devi vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 24 February, 2023
College of Nursing were not created while establishing the College. Therefore, for the purpose of
establishment of the College, the services of nursing personnel possessing M.Sc. (N) qualification
with teaching experience were utilized as faculty members as per the Government Order dated
7.9.2012. Since there were no separate posts creation for the Nursing College, the posts
substantively held by the incumbent concerned and other vacant posts in Health Department were
re- designated as Associate Professor and the incumbents were absorbed on regular basis against
the re-designated posts of Associate Professor as per the approval of the State Cabinet accorded on
7.7.2014 and with the concurrence of the Finance WP(C) No.167 of 2022, WP(C) No. 173 of 2022
and WP(C) No. 528 of 2021 P a g e | 17 Department and Department of Personnel vide orders dated
1.8.2014 and 30.1.2015 respectively.
23. Adding further, the learned Government Advocate submitted that though the third respondent,
at the time of utilization and absorption as Associate Professor, did not have experience for the
required number of years after passing M.Sc. (N) as prescribed by the INC, her service was absorbed
as Associate Professor as per the approval of the State Cabinet accorded on 7.7.2014, whereas the
petitioner who had completed her M.Sc. (N) in the year 1995 and had 9 years' experience after
passing M.Sc. (N) as on the date of her initial utilization as faculty member in the College of Nursing
and she fulfilled the eligibility criteria prescribed by the INC for the post of Associate Professor.
Thus, the petitioner being the senior most Associate Professor serving in the College of Nursing has
been allowed to hold the charge of Principal, College of Nursing, in addition to her normal duties
with effect form 1.3.2022 vide impugned order dated 26.2.2022. Therefore, there is no irregularity
and illegality in the said order. Thus, a prayer has been made to dismiss the writ petitions.
24. This Court considered the rival submissions and also perused the materials available on record.
WP(C) No.167 of 2022, WP(C) No. 173 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 528 of 2021 P a g e | 18 Discussion:
25. There were three challenges made in these writ petitions. The petitioner challenged the
absorption of the third respondent as Associate Professor alleging that the absorption is illegal. The
third respondent has challenged the seniority position of the petitioner stating that she is the senior
most and she be placed above the petitioner. The third respondent also challenged the order of the
respondent authorities thereby allowing the petitioner to hold the post of Principal, College of
Nursing, in addition to her normal duties as Associate Professor.
26. The grievance of the petitioner is that she was initially appointed as Nursing Sister in the Health
Department and thereafter, the Health Department issued an order dated 3.5.2003 whereby
utilizing the service of the petitioner as Sister Tutor at GNM School of Nursing. On the other hand,
the third respondent, who was initially appointed as Sister Tutor of the Female Health Worker
Training School, Churachandpur, was transferred and posted at GNM School of Nursing and by the
order dated 7.9.2012. She was initially utilized as Associate Professor and, subsequently, in
supersession of the order dated 7.9.2012, the authorities have issued another order dated 16.7.2013
by which she continued to be utilized as Associate WP(C) No.167 of 2022, WP(C) No. 173 of 2022
and WP(C) No. 528 of 2021 P a g e | 19 Professor of the College of Nursing. At the same time, after
due consideration, the petitioner also came to be utilized as Associate Professor with effect from
16.7.2013. Thereafter, vide order dated 1.8.2014, the substantive post of Sister Tutor held by the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9768240/ 9
Dr. N. Surbala Devi vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 24 February, 2023
third respondent was upgraded as Associate Professor and she was permanently absorbed thereto.
Similarly, the substantive post of Nursing Sister held by the petitioner was re-designated as
Associate Professor and she was absorbed thereto. In the order dated 1.8.2014, the name of the
petitioner appears at Serial No.3, while the third respondent's name appears at Serial No.5.
Thereafter, the authorities have issued another order dated 30.1.2015 notifying the concurrence of
the Department of Personnel to the earlier order dated 1.8.2014. According to the petitioner, the
third respondent obtained her M.Sc. (N) degree only in the year 2011. When she was absorbed as
Associate Professor, she had only three years' experience after M.Sc. (N) and, as such, the third
respondent is not eligible to be appointed as Associate Professor.
27. On the other hand, it is the plea of the third respondent that the petitioner has challenged the
legality of the orders dated 1.8.2014 and 30.1.2015 after the delay of 8 years and, therefore, she is
not entitled to maintain W.P.(C) No.167 of 2022. Since the post of Sister Tutor is a teaching post, the
WP(C) No.167 of 2022, WP(C) No. 173 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 528 of 2021 P a g e | 20 teaching
experience of the third respondent has to be counted from the date of her initial appointment i.e.
24.5.1986. The third respondent possessed the requisite criteria prescribed by the INC guidelines,
2012 and, this Court has already declared one Nalinibala Devi eligible for absorption to the post of
Vice Principal and Principal of the College of Nursing, Medical Directorate, Imphal and the said
Nalinibala Devi passed her M.Sc. (N) degree in December, 2012 and the third respondent passed her
M.Sc. (N) in the year 2011. In view of the order dated 12.5.2017 passed in W.P.(C) No.512 of 2015,
the third respondent is quite eligible for absorption to the post of Associate Professor and even for
higher post. There was no illegality in the absorption of the third respondent to the post of Associate
Professor.
28. It is the say of the respondent State that the third respondent at the time of her initial date of
utilization as Faculty Member in the College of Nursing, she had only one year experience after
passing M.Sc. (N) as she passed M.Sc. (N) in the year 2011. Therefore, the third respondent did not
possess the requisite experience for the post of Associate Professor prescribed by the INC at the time
of her utilization as Faculty Member. Even at the time of re-designation and absorption of the third
respondent vide order dated 1.8.2014, she has not completed 8 years' experience after M.Sc. (N) as
required under WP(C) No.167 of 2022, WP(C) No. 173 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 528 of 2021 P a g e |
21 the guidelines issued by the INC. On the other hand, the petitioner, though was initially
appointed to a non-teaching post of Nursing Sister, her service has been utilized as Sister Tutor, a
teaching post since 2003 and, as such, the petitioner has the teaching experience after M.Sc. (N).
29. It is an admitted fact that while establishing the College of Nursing, the required posts were not
created. Therefore, for the purpose of establishment of the College of Nursing, the services of
nursing personnel possessing M.Sc. (N) qualification with teaching experience were utilized as
Faculty Members. The qualification and experience for the post of Associate Professor, College of
Nursing is M.Sc. (N) with 8 years' experience after M.Sc. (N), including 5 years teaching experience.
30. The contention of the third respondent that the petitioner does not have the teaching experience
of 5 years at the time of utilization as Faculty Member in the College of Nursing as she was holding
the post of Nursing Sister a non- teaching post has no basis. Similarly, the argument of the learned
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9768240/ 10
Dr. N. Surbala Devi vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 24 February, 2023
counsel for the third respondent that the stand taken by the respondent Government in favour of the
petitioner by counting her utilization period as Sister Tutor is highly WP(C) No.167 of 2022, WP(C)
No. 173 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 528 of 2021 P a g e | 22 condemnable and not sustainable in the
eyes of law has also no basis. Further, the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
Union Territory of Chandigarh v. Rajesh Kumar Basandhi, (2003) 11 SCC 549 relied upon by the
learned counsel for the third respondent is not applicable to this case in the given facts and
circumstances. As rightly argued by learned counsel for the petitioner, the third respondent, who
had obtained her M.Sc. (N) in the year 2011, would not be eligible for utilization as teaching Faculty
Member in the College of Nursing, as she had only one year experience after passing M.Sc. (N).
31. As could be seen from the records, the petitioner was holding the post of Nursing Sister, a
non-teaching post, however, she has been ordered to work as Sister Tutor, a teaching post at GNM
School of Nursing, Lamphel vide order dated 3.5.2003. This fact has not been disputed by the third
respondent nor any contra document has been produced by the third respondent in support her
claim. Thus, it is clear from the materials produced by both sides that the petitioner was working in
a teaching post since 2003 and the teaching experience obtained by her has to be counted, which the
respondent authorities have rightly done in this case and after fixing seniority when the final
seniority list of Associate Professor, College of WP(C) No.167 of 2022, WP(C) No. 173 of 2022 and
WP(C) No. 528 of 2021 P a g e | 23 Nursing was forwarded to the Department of Personnel, it has
recommended the petitioner at Serial No.1.
32. At this juncture, the learned counsel for the respondent Shanti Devi submitted that the rules,
norms for fixation of seniority amongst similar cadres of the employees depends upon the nature of
services and Department concerned in which the Government has fixed from time to time. The
private respondents have no capacity to frame rules and regulations, but every employee has to
follow for smooth functioning of the duty. This Court finds some force in the submission made by
the learned counsel for the respondent Shanti Devi.
33. When the third respondent contended that due care has not been taken while finalizing the
seniority, it is her duty to prove the same. On the other hand, when this Court peruses the
order/notice dated 19.4.2021, it has been clearly mentioned the reasoning for placing the petitioner
at Serial No.1. In other words, it has to be held that while issuing the order/notice dated 19.4.2021
sufficient reasoning was given by the concerned authority. This Court finds any fault in the
order/notice dated 19.4.2021. The competent authority has considered the ground reality and has
taken due note of the fact that the petitioner has been rendering service as a teaching faculty i.e.
Sister Tutor with WP(C) No.167 of 2022, WP(C) No. 173 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 528 of 2021 P a g e
| 24 effect from 3.5.2003 in GNM School of Nursing at the time of her utilization as well as
absorption as Associate Professor.
34. It is apposite to mention that the qualification and experience for the post of Associate Professor,
College of Nursing is 8 years' experience after M.Sc. (N) including 5 years teaching experience,
which the third respondent does not fulfill. Therefore, there is no illegality in placing the petitioner
at Serial No.1 in the impugned final seniority list dated 19.4.2021 and there is also no violation of
any fundamental rights of the third respondent or any law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.

Dr. N. Surbala Devi vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 24 February, 2023
The writ petition at the hands of the third respondent challenging the impugned final seniority is
misconceived one. Therefore, the said writ petition is liable to be dismissed.
35. As far as the challenge made by the petitioner to the absorption of the third respondent as
Associate Professor, College of Nursing, is concerned, the learned Government Advocate contended
that it is not open to the respondent State to commit any illegality to appoint an ineligible and
unqualified candidate as Associate Professor in the College of Nursing in blatant violation of the
guidelines issued by INC. It is also the say of the learned Government Advocate that only after
following WP(C) No.167 of 2022, WP(C) No. 173 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 528 of 2021 P a g e | 25 the
guidelines issued by the INC, the third respondent and the petitioner have been absorbed in the post
of Associate Professor.
36. The learned Government Advocate further submitted that the writ petition, being W.P.(C)
No.512 of 2015, was primarily related to the post of Professor-cum-Vice Principal of the College of
Nursing, wherein this Court, vide order dated 12.5.2017, quashed the appointment of one Nalini
Devi as Professor-cum-Vice Principal of the College and directed the respondent State to consider
the petitioner therein, namely Nalinibala Devi for appointment by absorption as Vice-Principal or
any equivalent post in the cadre of the Principal. As against the order dated 12.5.2017, W.A.Nos.37
and 38 of 2017 have been preferred by the State and Nalini Devi, who is respondent in the writ
petition. The position now is both Nalini Devi as well as Nalinibala Devi have retired on attaining
the age of superannuation.
37. The petitioner by filing W.P.(C) No.167 of 2022 contended that the absorption/appointment of
the third respondent to the post of Associate Professor in the College of Nursing is illegal and void
ab-initio, as she did not possess the eligibility criteria prescribed by the INC. Further contention of
the petitioner is that the upgradation of the third respondent along WP(C) No.167 of 2022, WP(C)
No. 173 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 528 of 2021 P a g e | 26 with the post which she is not eligible is not
permissible in service jurisprudence. Hence, the absorption of the third respondent as Associate
Professor vide order dated 1.8.2014 read with the order dated 30.1.2015 is patently illegal and that
at most, the third respondent is eligible for the post of Assistant Professor only.
38. On a perusal of the order dated 12.5.2017 passed in W.P.(C) No.512 of 2015, it is seen that
though the third respondent and the petitioner herein were made as respondents in the aforesaid
writ petition, the issue of eligibility of the third respondent for appointment by absorption as
Associate Professor was not considered by this Court as the same did not arise in the said writ
petition. Moreover, in the said writ petition, it was clearly recorded that the absorption of the
teaching faculties to the College of Nursing was done in terms of INC guidelines, 2012 and the
petitioner did not challenge the said stand of the Government which was recorded in the said order
and she has already waived her rights and now after a delay of about 8 years, the petitioner cannot
take a u-turn and contend that the third respondent is not eligible to be absorbed to the post of
Associate Professor of the Nursing College. The reason for such a long delay of 8 years has not been
properly explained by the petitioner.
WP(C) No.167 of 2022, WP(C) No. 173 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 528 of 2021 P a g e | 27
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9768240/ 12
Dr. N. Surbala Devi vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 24 February, 2023
39. The argument of learned counsel for the petitioner that even though the orders impugned in
W.P.(C) No.167 of 2022 have been passed almost 7-8 years ago and for the reason that the grievance
of the petitioner against them and the cause of action for filing the said writ petition as well as her
locus standi arose only in the month of January, 2022 cannot be accepted. The said excuse pleaded
by the petitioner is only for the purpose of filing the writ petition and the same is otherwise legally
not sustainable.
40. At this juncture, it is to be pointed out that the law is well settled that a thing which cannot be
done directly shall not be done indirectly.
41. Admittedly, the petitioner has not challenged the order dated 12.7.2015 passed in W.P.(C)
No.512 of 2015 though she was made as party. Therefore, it is to be presumed that the petitioner is
not aggrieved with the order/findings recorded against her in the said writ petition. After sleeping
over her rights for about 8 years, the petitioner cannot challenge the legality of the order dated
1.8.2014 and 30.1.2015 by taking several grounds, which she did not raise in W.P.(C) No.512 of
2015. Therefore, on the sole ground itself, the writ petition, being W.P.(C) No.167 of 2022, filed by
the petitioner challenging the WP(C) No.167 of 2022, WP(C) No. 173 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 528 of
2021 P a g e | 28 impugned orders dated 1.8.2014 and 30.1.2015 is liable to be dismissed. On merits
also, the petitioner has no case. In view of the discussions held supra, W.P.(C) No.167 of 2022 filed
by the petitioner challenging the order dated 1.8.2014 and 30.1.2015 is not maintainable and the
respondent State has rightly considered the position of the third respondent for absorption and even
for the petitioner and issued the aforesaid orders. Therefore, this Court cannot find any fault in the
orders dated 1.8.2014 and 30.1.2015.
42. The third respondent, by filing W.P.(C) No.173 of 2022, has challenged the appointment of the
petitioner to hold the post of Principal of the College of Nursing. She claimed that she is the only
eligible person to hold such post as she is the senior most Associate Professor.
43. According to the third respondent, the Government cannot permit the petitioner to hold the
charge of Principal, as it will amount to taking a contradictory stand than taken in W.P.(C) No.637
of 2020, which is not permissible in law.
44. In reply, the learned Government Advocate submitted that the stand taken through the
affidavit-in-opposition filed in W.P.(C) No.637 of 2020 on 26.2.2021 was prior to the decision of the
Department of Personnel in the matter relating to WP(C) No.167 of 2022, WP(C) No. 173 of 2022
and WP(C) No. 528 of 2021 P a g e | 29 fixation of final seniority list of Associate Professor, College
of Nursing and the final seniority list of the Associate Professor was finalized and published only on
19.4.2021 i.e. after the decision of the Department of Personnel and, therefore, the said affidavit-
in-opposition filed by the respondent State in W.P.(C) No.637 of 2020 was through a bona fide
mistake, but not intentional.
45. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that there is no illegality in the order dated
26.2.2022, as the same has been issued on the basis of the final seniority list published vide notice
dated 19.4.2021, wherein the authority concerned has recorded reasoning for placing the third
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9768240/ 13
Dr. N. Surbala Devi vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 24 February, 2023
respondent as well as the petitioner at appropriate places.
46. Considering the overall submissions of the learned counsel for the third respondent, petitioner
as well as the learned Government Advocate, it is clear that the third respondent has neither
challenged the orders dated 3.5.2003, 16.7.2003 and 7.9.2012 for utilization of service of the
petitioner as teaching faculty nor the absorption orders dated 1.8.2014 and 30.1.2015. Therefore, in
the absence of any challenge to the legality of the absorption/utilization orders of the petitioner, the
third respondent cannot raise any issue at this stage qua counting of the utilization period of the
petitioner as teaching experience in WP(C) No.167 of 2022, WP(C) No. 173 of 2022 and WP(C) No.
528 of 2021 P a g e | 30 W.P.(C) No.173 of 2022. Moreover, this Court, in the earlier paragraphs of
this order, held that there is no illegality in the final seniority dated 19.4.2021 which is impugned in
W.P.(C) No.528 of 2021 filed by the third respondent.
47. The impugned order dated 26.2.2022 reads thus:
"No.MED-1601/20/2021-HS-HEALTH:
Whereas Smt. N.Nalinibala Devi, Associate Professor who is holding charge of
Principal, College of Nursing, Medical Directorate, Manipur is retiring on attaining
the age of superannuation w.e.f. 28th February, 2022 (AN).
2. Now, therefore, the Governor of Manipur is pleased to order that Dr.N.Surbala
Devi, Associate Professor, College of Nursing, Medical Directorate, Manipur shall
hold the charge of Principal, College of Nursing, Medical Directorate, Manipur in
addition to her normal duties w.e.f. 1st March, 2022.
3. This is subject to outcome of the ongoing Writ Petitions being W.P.(C) No.394 of
2021 and W.P.(C) No.528 of 2021 before the Hon'ble High Court of Manipur and any
other connected Court cases."
48. It is reiterated that though the third respondent at the time of utilization and absorption as
Associate Professor did not have experience of the required number of years after WP(C) No.167 of
2022, WP(C) No. 173 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 528 of 2021 P a g e | 31 passing M.Sc. (N) as
prescribed by the INC, her service was absorbed as Associate Professor as approved by the State
Cabinet dated 7.7.2014. Whereas the petitioner, who had completed her M.Sc. (N) in the year 1995,
had 9 years of experience after passing M.Sc. (N) as on the date of her initial utilization as Faculty
Member in the College of Nursing and she had fulfilled the eligibility criteria prescribed by the INC
for the post of Associate Professor. Further, as discussed above, though the petitioner was initially
appointed to a non-teaching post of Nursing Sister, she was utilized as Sister Tutor, a teaching post
and accordingly, her teaching experience after M.Sc. (N) has been counted for the purpose of
appointment as Associate Professor and fixation of the seniority. Since the petitioner being a senior
most Associate Professor serving in the College of Nursing, she has been allowed to hold the charge
of Principal, College of Nursing, Medical Directorate, Manipur, in addition to her normal duties with
effect from 1.3.2022 vide the impugned order dated 26.2.2022. This Court finds no irregularity or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9768240/ 14
Dr. N. Surbala Devi vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 24 February, 2023
illegality in the impugned order dated 26.2.2022 and on the other hand, the grounds raised by the
third respondent to challenge the said order are untenable. Resultantly, W.P.(C) No.173 of 2022
filed by the third respondent fails. On overall analysis, the acts done by the respondent authorities
cannot be WP(C) No.167 of 2022, WP(C) No. 173 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 528 of 2021 P a g e | 32
faulted and they have acted only in accordance with law. Therefore, the challenges made by the third
respondent and the petitioner in these writ proceedings are not sustainable in the eyes of law.
49. For all the reasons stated above the writ petitions filed by the third respondent and the
petitioner fail. Accordingly, W.P.(C) No.528 of 2021, 173 of 2022 and 167 of 2022 are dismissed.
There will be no order as to costs.
