and 31.05.2020 respectively. Investigation is complete and chargsheet has been filed. They are no
more required for custodial investigation. Neither there was any intention nor enmity with the
complainant. Looking to the Covid-19 situation, trial is not likely to conclude early in the near
future. Hence, under such circumstances and on the ground of parity, the applicant may be enlarged
on bail on such terms and conditions this Court deems fit and proper.
P er contra, learned Panel Lawyer supports the order impugned and opposes the bail applications
with submission that gravity of the offence can be adjusted with the fact that the applicant had
caught hold the injured Abdul and co-accused had caused knife injuries to him. The injuries are life
threatening. Hence no indulgence is warranted.
Learned counsel for the objector/complainant submits that he has no objection if the the bail
applications of the applicants are allowed as both the parties are members of the same community
and are well known to each other.

that looking to grave critical social economic condition of poor persons living in old age homes,
Vidhwa Ashrams or orphans living in orphanage and due to outbreak of Covid-19 Pandemic, the
