(UDAY SINGH THAKUR Vs CENTRAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION)

Jabalpur, Dated : 29-03-2019
Shri Anurag Gohil, Advocate for the appellant.
Shri J.K. Jain, Advocate for the CBI-respondent.
Heard on I.A. No. 5608/2019, which is an application for suspension of sentence and grant of bail to
the appellant.
The appeal has been preferred under Section 374(2) of Cr.P.C.,1973 by the appellants against
judgment dated 09.03.2019 passed by learned Special Judge, CBI, Bhopal (M.P.) in Spl. Case No.
11/2012. Appellant stand convicted for an offence punishable under Sections 420 r/w 120-B, 467
r/w 120-B and 471 r/w 120-B of IPC and has been sentenced to undergo R.I. for 3 years with fine of
Rs. 2,000/- in each Section with default stipulation in each.
As per prosecution case, co-accused K.K. Chourasiya and Basant Pavse were posted as Senior
Manager and Assistant Manager Credit respectively in the Central Bank of India at Arera Hills
Branch, Bhopal. Co-
accused persons in connivance with the present appellant, who was the proprietor of M/s
Pitambhara Constructions & Developers, M/s Pitambhara Constructions & M/s Pitambhara
Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. Bhopal forged the payslip of the debtors/borrowers Sanish Das and Somesh
Das and obtained loan from the bank by causing monetary loss of Rs.150.75 lacs to the Central Bank
of India. Thereafter, on the report of the complainant, case was registered against the present
appellant and other co-accused persons.
Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the jail sentences of the appellant has been
suspended by the trial Court till 08.04.2019. The present appellant is builder. He further submits
that learned Court below has erred in appreciating the evidence on record which very clearly states
that co- borrower applied for loan alongwith security and thereafter co-accused on the 2
CRA-2651-2019 basis of report and on the basis of other report has further sanctioned the loan
which was further deposited into the account, as per the norms. No audit infirmities were also
found. The prosecution has not established the fact that in any way the present appellant was in
agreement with the other co-accused persons for causing any financial loss to the bank. There are
many contradictions, omissions and improvements in the version of the prosecution witnesses.
There are fair chances to succeed in the case. The final hearing of this appeal will take time. If the
appellant is not released on bail, purpose of filing this application will be futile. Therefore, the
application filed on behalf of the appellant may be allowed and the period of his remaining jail

sentence may be suspended and he may be released on bail.
Learned ASJ for the respondent/CBI has opposed the application for suspension of sentence and
grant of bail to the appellant.
After hearing rival submissions of learned counsel for the parties, looking to the facts and
circumstances of the case and looking to the fact that the learned Trial Court has held in its
judgement para-125 that as per the record, the aforesaid money from the mortgage amount with
regard to the present appellant would be recovered, but without expressing any opinion on the
merits of the case, I am of the considered opinion that it would be appropriate to suspend the
custodial sentence awarded to the appellant and grant bail to him.
Consequently, I.A. No.5608/2019 is allowed subject to deposit of fine amount, if already not
deposited. The custodial sentence awarded to the appellant shall remain suspended during the
pendency of this appeal.
Appellant-Uday Singh Thakur be released from custody subject to his furnishing a personal bond in
the sum of Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand) with one surety in the like amount to the
satisfaction of the trial Court. He shall appear and mark his presence before the Trial Court on
26.07.2019 and shall continue to do so on all such future dates, as may be given in this behalf,
during pendency of the matter.
3 CRA-2651-2019 Record of the Court below be called for.
List the matter for admission after four weeks.
Certified copy as per rules.
