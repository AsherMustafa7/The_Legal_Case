THIS WRIT PETITION COMING ON FOR FURTHER
HEARING THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:
9
ORDER
The essential lis between the parties relates to non- compliance of the Government orders dated
09.04.2012, 18.04.2011 & 12.01.2012. The collective reading of these orders and is to the effect that
the case of petitioners should be considered for allotment of sites in question. After service of notice
the respondents having entered appearance through the learned AGA and the learned Senior Panel
Counsel vociferously oppose the petition.
2. In the meanwhile, a learned Co-ordinate Judge of this court vide order dated 06.03.2014 had
observed as under:
"Petitioners having made representations seeking allotment of sites under
discretionary quota of the Karnataka Housing Board and having not been allotted the
sites had filed W.P.Nos.14059/2005 and 19639/2005 and 34237-250/2009. The
Government having passed orders on 18.04.2011, 12.01.2012, 09.04.2012 and
04.08.2012 for allotment of sites under discretionary quota and the petitioners
having not been allotted the sites, these Writ Petitions were filed on 19.04.2013 to
quash Annexure-F and grant consequential reliefs.
Matter was heard in part on 05.03.2014.
During the course of hearing, Sri.S.N.Ashwathnarayana, learned advocate for the 2nd
respondent submitted that the impugned allotments have been made in the
discretionary quota as provided under Regulation 4 of K.H.B. (Regulations) which
provides for such allotment being made. Certain records were shown to the Court on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/53741480/ 8
Sri P S Kushalappa vs The State Of Karnataka on 3 March, 2022
the basis of which the impugned allotments were made. Since it was submitted that
the allotments were made based on the recommendations of the then Housing
Minister and other VIPs and as the list showed the names of certain persons whose
addresses are also not forthcoming, apart from some retired civil servants and
serving as I.F.S. Officer, etc. Sri.S.N.Ashwanthnaryana was directed to make available
the applications, if any, of 198 allottees whose name appear in the list dated
04.08.2012. He was also directed to make available the recommendations, etc on the
basis of which the allotment of sites to 198 persons was made.
Today, Sri.Ashwanthnaryana has made available certain records running to about 64
pages in respect of the impugned allotments in favour of about 33 persons. He
submitted that efforts are being made to trace out the recommendations made in
respect of others and sought time to make available the records in respect of the other
allottees.
Sri.H.T.Narendra Prasad, learned AGA
submitted that only one file bearing
No.UD/246/KHB/2012 is available with the
Government and he made available the same for perusal of the Court.
The files which have been made available to the Court are required to be retained by
the registry in safe custody. In the circumstances, Registrar General is directed to
keep the two files produced by Sri.Ashwanthnaryana and Sri.H.T.Narendra Prasad
respectively, in a sealed cover and safe custody.
Since the matter needs deeper consideration, as the impugned allotments are based
on discretion and whether there is an unguided discretion, which can be exercised is
required to be considered and decided, Sri.S.N.Ashwanthnaryana is directed to make
avaialbe the remaining recommendations as well by next hearing date.
Interim order passed earlier shall operate until further orders.
Re-list on 20.03.2014."
3. By the said order the original records produced by the respondent-KHB concerning the subject
matter should retained in the safe custody of Court. There appears to some reason as to why such an
order was made; be that as it may. On the previous hearing, both the sides graciously agreed that an
amicable settlement can be worked out within the frame of law, failing which, matter would be
heard on merits. The Senior Panel Counsel appearing for the respondent-KHB on his own shares
with the Court a copy of communication dated 02.03.2022 between himself and his client. The text
of he said communication is as under:

4. This Court notices that it is carefully texted, as rightly submitted by the learned counsel appearing
for the petitioners. However, it cannot be construed as noncommittal, especially keeping in view the
submission made by learned Panel Counsel for the KHB. There is no reason for the petitioners
apprehension of the kind. The impression the Court gathers on the basis of the text of the above
communication coupled with the submission made at the Bar is to the effect that the claim of the
petitioners would be considered positively against the available sites as mentioned in the said
communication itself. This should happen within a period of four weeks. This period is specified on
the indication of learned Panel counsel appearing for the KHB. In view of this assurance from the
side of KHB made pursuant to the communication mentioned above on the submission made by the
learned Panel counsel on the instruction of the Assistant Revenue Officer Sri. Suresh Babu
personally present in the court nothing more remains to be done in this case.
In the above circumstances, this nearly decade old petition is disposed off with the above
observations.

Sri P S Kushalappa vs The State Of Karnataka on 3 March, 2022
It hardly needs to be mentioned that whatever request fee or allotment fee payable in accordance
with the extant rules shall be paid by the petitioners as may be specified by the KHB in writing and
comply with other requirements of law.
Period for compliance is four weeks from the date of copy of the judgment is handed to the KHB.
The original file is returned to the learned Senior Panel counsel and he has accepted the same, in
person.
Now, no costs.
