5. Learned counsel for the respondents pointed out that the institution of the appellant is deficient

dated 10th of April, 2012 passed by a learned Single Bench of this Court in C.W.J.C. 1727 of 2009
(Sarswati Bhawan Jai Kant Madhyamik Sanskrit Vidyalaya, Chikna Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors.)

to examine the case of the appellant's school in isolation for continuation of its recognition and seek
necessary approval of the State Government as prescribed under Section 6 of the Bihar Sanskrit
Shiksha Board Act, 1981.
6. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and find that the present Letters Patent Appeal is
required to be disposed of in the light of the order passed by the Single Bench of this Court on 10th
of April, 2012 in C.W.J.C. No. 1727 of 2009 (Sarswati Bhawan Jai Kant Madhyamik Sanskrit
Vidyalaya, Chikna Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors.) with a direction to the Bihar Sanskrit Shiksha
Board for considering the availability of the infrastructure for the purpose of recognition. Once the
Board finds that the institution of the appellant is not deficient in infrastructure or is capable of
meeting out the deficiencies, the Bihar Sanskrit Shiksha Board will make recommendation to the
State for necessary orders; otherwise, the appellant will be informed of the deficiencies to enable the
appellant Patna High Court LPA No.687 of 2014 dt.03-05-2016 to take recourse to the remedies in
