11. Learned counsel for the applicants submitted that by way of instant Criminal Misc. Application
under Section 482 the applicants seeks to challenge the chargesheet filed in the case as well as
consequential proceedings pending before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ballia in Criminal Case
No.1253 of 2005 related to above stated offence. The matter pertains to payment of salary which has
been made to certain teachers namely Surendra Natha Singh, Mangala Singh and Ravi Shankar
Pandey. Present case relates to payment of salary to one Surendra Nath Singh who was posted as
assistant teacher in Sri Narhagee Inter College Narhai Dasra, District Ballia. Apart from that
payment of salary to other teachers Mangala Singh and Ravi Shankar Pandey is also under challenge
in other criminal cases in FIR lodged on 25.07.2003 against the applicant No.1 and some other
person at Police Station Kotwali District Ballia with the allegation that illegal appoint has been made
of one Surendra Nath Singh as assistant teacher in collusion of other accused persons, and some
payments of salary have been made to him. Name of applicant is not mentioned in the FIR.
12. He next submitted that a bare perusal of the FIR demonstrates that a letter was sent to the State
Government by the then SHO, P.S. Kotwali District Ballia in relation to the irregularity in
appointment made by aforesaid persons and consequently the State Government formed a
committee for the investigation and referred the matter for investigation. The Investigating Officer
during preliminary inquiry recorded the statement of some persons and submitted report and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/96864349/ 3
Rajendra Pratap And Another vs State Of U.P. And Others on 4 February, 2025
consequently the FIR was lodged at Police Station Kotwali District Ballia.
13. He further submitted that feeling aggrieved by said FIR, the applicant No.2 approached this
Hon'ble Court challenging the FIR dated 25.07.2003. This Hon'ble after considering the material
facts was pleased to stay the arrest of the applicant in Case Crime No.309 of 2003, which pertains to
present criminal case pending against the applicants, till the conclusion of the investigation or
submission of any report vide order dated 27.05.2005.
14. He further submitted that the Investigating Officer failed to record the statement of the
applicants during the course of investigation and further more he failed to consider the counter
affidavit and the other aspects of the case as he did not consider the fact that some payment of salary
to Surendra Nath Singh and other assistant teachers have already been made under the directions of
higher authorities, and further initially payment has been made by earlier DIOS in the year 1995. As
such the ignorance of facts itself vitiates the entire proceedings against the applicants. The
Investigating Officer without considering the material facts filed chargesheet against the applicants
together with other accused persons, whereas the applicants had no concern with the appointment
of said teachers. The main allegation in the chargesheet are with regard to illegal appointment and
payment of salaries to the teachers. It is relevant to point out here that illegality in appointment and
payment of salaries, the assistant teachers should be scrutinized in the manner provided under the
provisions of U.P. Secondary Education (Service Selection Board) Act, 1982 and removal of difficulty
order framed there under and also under the provisions of Payment of Salaries Act, 1971.
a. Learned counsel for the applicants submitted that Section-9 of the U.P. High School and
Intermediate Colleges (Payment of Salaries of Teachers and other Employees) Act, 1971, U.P. Act
No.24 of 1971, which reads as follows:-
"9- Approval for post:- No institution shall create a new post of teacher or other
employee except with the provisions approval of the Director, or such other officer as
may be empowered in that behalf by the Director)."
b. He next submitted that the teachers and employees would get the payment of salary from the
States Fund, if they appointed against the sanctioned post, under the provisions of Section 9 of
Payment of Salaries Act, 1971. The appointment of Sri Surendra Nath Singh is said to have been
made prior to 1995, when power of making the appointment on the post of assistant teachers vested
in committee of management (two substantive vacancies under Section 18 of the U.P. Secondary
Education (Services Selection Board) Act, 1982 and under the removal of difficulties order (if the
short term vacancy). All the provisions referred above have been scrutinized by the then DIOS,
Ballia, he has proved the appointment of Sri Surendra Nath Singh and his payment of salary was
was released as per direction of higher authorities. The appointment of Sri Surendra Nath Singh has
not been challenged to any court of law or to the knowledge of the applicant and same is not
declared as invalid at any forum.
c. Reference may be made to proceeding initiated by the teachers and employees of Narheji Inter
College Narhi, District Ballia where Surendra Nath Singh has been appointed as assistant teacher by

Rajendra Pratap And Another vs State Of U.P. And Others on 4 February, 2025
filing a writ petition before this Hon'ble Court vide writ petition No.18277 of 1996, which was filed
by certain staff of teachers, in that writ petition this Hon'ble Court directed to pay the salary to
teachers and other employees in accordance with law.
d. The Director of Education after issuing the notices to the Management, Principal as well as to the
teachers passed a detailed order on 05.08.1996, in which it has been held that in the institution
there are only 26 sanctioned posts and the teachers and employees working against the said
sanctioned posts are entitled to their salary. A copy of order dated 05.08.1996 of the Director of
Education is being filed herewith and marked as Annexure No.4 to the affidavit. The Director of
Education has referred the order of Hon'ble High Court passed on 24.05.19996 in Writ Petition
No.18277 of 1996 (U.P. Madhyamik Shikshak Sangh,Narheji Inter College Narhi, District Ballia
through the Mangala Prasad Singh, Assistant Teacher and another Vs. State of U.P. through
Secretary Education and others) e. In contempt proceedings arising out for non compliance of the
order passed in Writ Petition No.18277 of 1996, in which this Hon'ble Court was pleased to pass a
detailed order and directed the State Government to form a high level committee, into the illegality
in appointment of teachers and employees in said college. This Hon'ble Court vide order dated
19.09.1996 further directed the State Government to fix responsibility regarding illegal appointment
of the teachers and employees of the institution initially. As per the direction of this Hon'ble court
dated 19.09.1996 the high level committed was formed consisting of Additional Director of
Education, Joint Secretary Education Department and Chief Accounts Officer etc. The high level
committed passed a detailed order after looking into the entire record of the institution as well as
sanctioned strength of post vide its order dated 08.07.1997. That in the order dated 08.07.1997 the
high level committee held that the appointment of Mangala Prasad Singh and Surendra Nath Singh
are against the sanctioned post. The high level committee has further fixed responsibility on several
persons. The name of the applicant did not find place in that list. The copy of report of high level
committee dated 08.07.1997 is annexed as Annexure No.5 to the affidavit.
f. The authority to sanction the posts and to make appointment is the Director of Education and
DIOS under the provisions of law. The appointment of Sri Surendra Nath Singh has been verified by
the Director of Education who was one of the members of the high level committee and the
appointment has been approved by the then DIOS. The investigation conducted by CBCID was not
fair on account of the fact that appointment of those teachers held valid by education department
and this fact was not looked into by the Investigating Officer. The observation of Investigating
Agency held that 116 posts in the institution is the result of malafide exercise with intention to
facilitate the management to get illegal payments from the State fund.
g. The appointment of Sri Surendra Nath Singh was made against the sanctioned posts approved by
the DIOS and held valid by Director of Education as well as High Level Committee.
h. He next submitted that there is no evidence against the applicants, what so ever to justify the fact
that they have discharges their duties in collusion with other officials and disobeyed the order of
their higher authorities, hence, the impugned chargesheet submitted by the investigating officer
deserves to be set-aside qua applicants.

Rajendra Pratap And Another vs State Of U.P. And Others on 4 February, 2025
I. The ingredients to charges levelled against the applicants Under Sections 409, 419, 420,467, 468,
471, 201 and 120-B I.P.C. are not applicable in relation to the applicants, threre is no evidence that
they have committed any criminal beach of trust, cheating by false impersonation, cheating,
disappearance of evidence or forgery as a public servant. The payment has been made to said
teacher Surendra Nath Singh under the direction of higher authorities. There is no material to
suggest that the applicants have fabricated any documents nor there is any finding that direction of
the Director of Education for payment of salary to Surendra Nath Singh is forged. In so far as the
payment of salary to Sri Mangala Singh and Surendra Nath Singh are concerned, the salaries have
been paid to them pursuant to direction of Director of Education. Since the payment has been made
under the permission of superior authorities against the sanctioned post, as such, no illegality was
committed by the applicants in making the payment to Sri Mangala Singh and Surendra Nath Singh.
The State Government had issued direction for payment of salary to these teachers pursuant to
order of this Hon'ble Court, as such in making the payment of salary for compliance of order of this
Hon'ble Court no offence has been committed by the applicants.
15. He lastsly submitted that athis court passed an order on 10.08.2005 in present petition under
Section 482 Cr.P.C. that further proceedings against the applicants in pursuance of chargesheet
No.16 of 2005 under said sections shall remain stayed till the next date of listing and said stay has
been extended from time to time.
16. With above submissions, leaned counsel prayed for quashing the proceedings initiated against
the applicants by the court below in criminal case arisen out of investigation in the Case Crime No.
309 of 2003, Under Sections 409, 419, 420,467, 468, 471, 201 and 120-B I.P.C. Police Station
Kotwali, District Ballia before the criminal court concerned.
17. Per contra, learned A.G.A. pressed the grounds taken in counter affidavit submitted that the
present applicant No.1 was working as DIOS Ballia and applicant No.2 was working as Account
Officer at the relevant point of time, and the alleged offences are made out against them. During the
course of investigation this fact came into picture that one person namely Surendra Nath Singh an
alleged assistant teacher in Narheji Inter College Narhi, District Ballia was removed from the service
after due process of inquiry on the ground of absence from service since February, 1999 for
misconduct. This person Surendra Nath Singh prepared forged documents with regard to his service
book in conspiracy with the officials and employees of education department and had got his bill of
arrear forwarded to the superior authorities for arrear of payment. On the basis of which he had
been paid a total Rs.6,68,845/- in illegal manner in conspiracy with the erstwhile District Inspectors
of Schools, Ballia and officials of finance and account department. He lastly submitted that it is well
settled principle of law laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court as well as by this Hon'ble Court in
various judgments that jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C. should be exercised sparingly in
rarest of rare cases and after meticulous of evidence collected during course of investigation, the
grounds taken in the present application are matter of trial. As such, the relief sought by the present
applicants is misconceived and devoid of merit. The evidence resent in the case diary depicts the
guilt of the present applicant for said charges.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/96864349/ 6
Rajendra Pratap And Another vs State Of U.P. And Others on 4 February, 2025
18. That on perusal of record and annexures it appears that applicants have filed a copy of order
dated 23.08.1998 passed by this Hon'ble Court as Annexure No.7 to the affidavit, wherein this Court
passed the following order:-
"If the petitioners are in service and teachers in the school, in that event, the salary of
the petitioners be paid within three months and arrears of salary be paid within four
months from the date of production of a certified copy of this order, if the
appointment is accordance with law.
With this observation the petitioner is disposed of finally."
19. The above order of Hon'ble Court has been mentioned in Government Order
No.625/15-12-2002-1601(116) dated 03.04.2002 through letter issued by the Special Secretary Uttar
Pradesh Shashan to Director of Education (Intermediate) U.P. Lucknow on subject regarding
payment of salary in Narheji Inter College Narhi, District Ballia in compliance of order of Hon'ble
High Court. In the said letter director of education is asked to ensure payment of salary to
petitioners in pursuance of order dated 23.01.1998 passed by this Hon'ble Court. The petitioner No.1
acting as District Inspector of Schools, Ballia vide letter dated 06.05.2002, wherein order of this
Hon'ble Court dated 23.01.1998 passed in Writ Petition No.1253 of 1998 Shiv Kumar Sharma and
others Vs. State of U.P. and Government letter dated 625/15-12-2002-1601(116) dated 03.04.2002
and letter of Deputy Director of Education dated 10.04.2002 have been referred, had directed the
Principal/Manager of Narheji Inter College Narhi, District Ballia to produce salary bill of 37
employees which include 25 assistant teachers, 2 lecturers and 10 class III and Class IV employees.
20. In FIR itself it is stated that applicant No.1 Rajednra Pratap was posted as District Inspector of
Schools in District Ballia during the period January 2002 to December 2002 and prior to payment
of salary by orders of Rajendra Pratap to Surendra Nath Singh. The earlier District Inspector of
Schools Sri Rakesh Kumar Pandey also made payment of salary to Surendra Nath Singh, but earlier
District Inspector of Schools has not been made accused in the case.
21. Hon'ble Supreme Court in Ramveer Upadhyay and another Vs. State of U.P. and another in
Special Leave Petition (Crl.) No.2953 of 2022 observed as under:-
"26. Section 482 of the Cr.P.C provides:− "482. Saving of inherent powers of High
Court.--Nothing in this Code shall be deemed to limit or affect the inherent powers of
the High Court to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order
under this Code, or to prevent abuse of the process of any Court or otherwise to
secure the ends of justice."
27. Even though, the inherent power of the High Court under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C., to interfere
with criminal proceedings is wide, such power has to be exercised with circumspection, in
exceptional cases. Jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C is not to be exercised for the asking.
37. In State of Haryana and Ors. v. Bhajan Lal and Ors. 1992 Supll (1) SCC 335 this Court held:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/96864349/ 7
Rajendra Pratap And Another vs State Of U.P. And Others on 4 February, 2025
"102. In the backdrop of the interpretation of the various relevant provisions of the
Code under Chapter XIV and of the principles of law enunciated by this Court in a
series of decisions relating to the exercise of the extraordinary power under Article
226 or the inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code which we have extracted
and reproduced above, we give the following categories of cases by way of illustration
wherein such power could be exercised either to prevent abuse of the process of any
court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice, though it may not be possible to lay
down any precise, clearly defined and sufficiently channelised and inflexible
guidelines or rigid formulae and to give an exhaustive list of myriad kinds of cases
wherein such power should be exercised.
(1) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the complaint, even
if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie
constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused.
(2) Where the allegations in the first information report and other materials, if any,
accompanying the FIR do not disclose a cogizable offence, justifying an investigation
by police officers under Section 156(1) of the Code except under an order of a
Magistrate within the purview of Section 155(2) of the Code.
11 (2021) 5 SCC 524 121992 Suppl (1) SCC 335 (3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the
FIR or complaint and the evidence collected in support of the same do not disclose the commission
of any offence and make out a case against the accused.
(4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable offence but constitute only a
non−cognizable offence, no investigation is permitted by a police officer without an order of a
Magistrate as contemplated under Section 155(2) of the Code.
(5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently improbable on
the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground
for proceeding against the accused. (6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the
provisions of the Code or the concerned Act (under which a criminal proceeding is instituted) to the
institution and continuance of the proceedings and/or where there is a specific provision in the
Code or the concerned Act, providing efficacious redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party. (7)
Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and/or where the proceeding is
maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a
view to spite him due to private and personal grudge.
103. We also give a note of caution to the effect that the power of quashing a criminal proceeding
should be exercised very sparingly and with circumspection and that too in the rarest of rare cases;
that the court will not be justified in embarking upon an enquiry as to the reliability or genuineness
or otherwise of the allegations made in the FIR or the complaint and that the extraordinary or
inherent powers do not confer an arbitrary jurisdiction on the court to act according to its whim or
caprice."

Rajendra Pratap And Another vs State Of U.P. And Others on 4 February, 2025
22. After considering the submissions of learned counsel for the parties and meticulous examination
of material on record and taking into consideration the totality of the facts and circumstances of the
case this Court is of the opinion that the applicants who were posted as DIOS and Accounts Officer
respectively in district Ballia made payment of salary to assistant teacher Surendra Nath Singh,
purportedly acting in compliance of order dated 23.01.1998 passed by this Court, Government
Order No. 625/15-12-2002-1601(116) letter dated 03.04.2002 and letter of Deputy Director,
Director of Education U.P., Lucknow dated 10.04.2002 and prior to their posting in said districts
payments of the salary was also made by their predecessors to said assistant teachers Surendra Nath
Singh and one Mangala Singh. The ingredients of the offence as alleged against the
applicants/petitioners are missing in this case. There is no allegation against them that they had
derived any wrongful gain by making payment of salary to said teacher or they were aware of the
fact the appointment of said teacher was disputed are was found illegal in some official inquiry.
There might have been lapses on their part to undertake some inquiry regarding legality of the
appointments of said teachers but only due to that fact their bonafide cannot be doubted and no
criminal liability can be fastened against them with regard to payment of salary to said teachers at
their instance, when there were orders of this court and government orders in that regard.
23. In light of the foregoing discussion, this court finds it lawful and in fitness of things to quash the
proceedings of criminal case pending against the applicants who are already facing trial together
with other accused persons which was registered as Criminal Case No.1253 of 2005 in the court
concerned arising our of Case Crime No. 309 of 2003, Under Sections 409, 419, 420,467, 468, 471,
201 and 120-B I.P.C. Police Station Kotwali, District Ballia arising out chargesheet No.15 of 2005
dated 16.06.2005 pending in the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ballia in respect of present
applicants only, if the case of applicants is already decided this order will not be given effect.
24. The proceedings of above stated criminal case is accordingly quashed in respect of the applicants
only, if their case is still pending.
25. It is clarified that so far as the proceedings with regard to other chargesheed accused persons is
concerned the same will continue in accordance with law, until a contrary order order is passed by a
competent court.
26. The application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. is allowed in the manner as stated above.
