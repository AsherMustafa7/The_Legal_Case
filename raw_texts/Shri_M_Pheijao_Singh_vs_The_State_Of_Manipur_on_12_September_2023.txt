of charges vide order dated 10.6.2020 and to direct the
respondents to provide the consequential service benefits as if

filed W.P.(C) No.688 of 2021 and, this Court, by the order dated
15.11.2021 in W.P.(C) No.688 of 2021, quashed the suspension

Though the first Inquiring Authoritywas appointed on 22.6.2020,
the said authority could not conclude the inquiry within six

24.6.2021, the audit report was submitted to the effect that the
petitioner has cleared the amount, except Rs.45,881/- and the
said amount was ordered to be recovered immediately. In the
said report, it has been stated that the petitioner may be allowed
to revoke his suspension order. However, the authority has not
put the report into action.
4.3. Challenging the initiation of the departmental
proceedings, vide order dated 25.2.2020 and framing of charges
dated 10.6.2020, the petitioner has filed W.P.(C) No.913 of 2021
and during the pendency of the said writ petition, the respondent
authorities issued the impugned order dated 18.12.2021 which
was communicated to the petitioner on 11.1.2022 initiating the
second departmental proceedings by framing of charges after
withdrawing the earlier article of charges on the same set of facts,
for which the earlier departmental proceedings could not be
proved which is under challenge in W.P.(C) No.913 of 2021.
Aggrieved by the issuance of the second departmental
proceedings, the petitioner has filed W.P.(C) No.37 of 2022.

Shri M. Pheijao Singh vs The State Of Manipur on 12 September, 2023
petition vide order dated 15.11.2021. In compliance of this
Court's order, the authorities have issued an order dated
21.12.2021 thereby reinstating the petitioner with effect from
20.11.2020.
5.1. It is stated that on 10.6.2020, the respondent
authorities issued a Memorandum along with article of charges
and statement of imputations of misconduct etc. for holding
inquiry against the petitioner. However, the same was withdrawn

order dated 21.1.2022 the respondent authorities cancelled the
order dated 11.1.2022 on the ground that there was some
inadvertent mistake in it.
5.2. It is stated in the affidavit-in-oppositions that the
inability of the respondent authorities to supply documents to the
petitioner expeditiously may not be viewed as victimization of the
petitioner. The impugned order dated 18.12.2021 communicated
on 11.1.2022 has not been cancelled vide order dated 21.1.2022.
Hence, the allegations of mala fide, illegalities etc. are denied.
Since the impugned orders have already been cancelled, no
WP(C) No. 37 of 2022 and WP(C) No.913 of 2021

cause of action survives and, therefore, the writ petitions are
liable to be dismissed.
6. Assailing the impugned orders, Mr. A.

Shri M. Pheijao Singh vs The State Of Manipur on 12 September, 2023
Romenkumar, the learned senior counsel for the petitioner
submitted that the petitioner was functioning as Drawing and
Disbursing Officer in the Department of TA & Hills from 24.4.2014
to 31.8.2016 and subsequently he was removed from functioning
as Drawing and Disbursing Officer. On 25.2.2020, the petitioner
was placed under suspension on the ground that disciplinary
proceedings are initiated against him and article of charges were
framed against the petitioner vide order dated 10.6.2020.
Challenging the suspension, the petitioner has filed W.P.(C)
No.688 of 2021 and, this Court, by the order dated 15.11.2021,
allowed the said writ petition and directed the respondents to
treat that the petitioner have been reinstated in service with effect

Shri M. Pheijao Singh vs The State Of Manipur on 12 September, 2023
months as contemplated under Rule 14(24)(a) of the CCS (CCA)
Rules, 1965.
8. The learned senior counsel for the petitioner urged
that the departmental proceeding against the petitioner was
initiated with cool calculation and deliberate design to humiliate,
harass and victimize the petitioner. When the Director of Local
and Fund Audit conducted a special audit in the Department of
Tribal Affairs and Hills, the said authority submitted his report to
the effect that (a) almost the issue is cleared, except an amount
of Rs.45,881/-, which is to be recovered immediately; (b) the
petitioner may be allowed to revoke his suspension order
immediately. However, the respondent authorities have not acted
on the report of the Director of Local and Fund Audit.
9. The learned senior counsel further submitted that
challenging the suspension order dated 25.2.2020 and the
initiation of departmental proceedings and framing of article of
charges dated 10.6.2020, the petitioner has filed W.P.(C) No.913
of 2021. During the pendency of the said writ petition, the
respondent authorities issued the impugned order dated
WP(C) No. 37 of 2022 and WP(C) No.913 of 2021

Shri M. Pheijao Singh vs The State Of Manipur on 12 September, 2023
set of facts, for which the earlier departmental proceedings could
not be proved which is under challenge in W.P.(C) No.913 of
2021.
10. According to the learned senior counsel for the
petitioner, the initiation of second departmental proceedings
without the leave of the Court is illegal, mala fide and unjust and
also interfering with the administration of justice. In support of
his submission, the learned senior counsel for the petitioner has
placed reliance upon the decision in the case of Athokpam
Sukhendrajit Singh v. State of Manipur and others, 2021 (1) MLJ
93.
11. The learned senior counsel for the petitioner, by
placing on record the decision in the case of Ziauddin v. State of
Manipur, (2016) 4 NEJ 323 (MN), submitted that there is no
denial in the affidavit-in-opposition filed by the respondents 1 and
2 that the second departmental proceedings on the same set of
facts is not permissible.

12. According to the learned senior counsel for the
petitioner, if an averment is not specifically denied, such
averment is deemed to have to been admitted and judgment can
be delivered under Order 12, Rule 6 CPC. In support, the
learned counsel for the petitioner placed reliance upon the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128758593/ 9
Shri M. Pheijao Singh vs The State Of Manipur on 12 September, 2023
decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Indian Bank
v. S.N.Engineers and Suppliers, (2018) 4 SCC 606. Thus, a
prayer has been made to quash the impugned orders.
13. Per contra, Mrs. Ch. Sundari, the learned
Government Advocate for the respondents submitted that the
petitioner has filed W.P.(C) No.37 of 2022 to quash the order
dated 18.12.2021 initiating the second departmental proceedings
along with framing of charges on selfsame charges of the earlier
charges which are under challenge in W.P.(C) No.913 of 2021;
that the petitioner has already filed W.P.(C) No.688 of 2021
challenging the suspension order dated 25.2.2020 andthis Court
allowed the said writ petition on 15.11.2021. In compliance of
the order passed in the said writ petition, the respondent
authorities have issued an order dated 21.12.2021reinstating the
petitioner with effect from 20.11.2020; that the respondent
authorities have issued Memorandum dated 10.6.2020 for
holding enquiry against the petitioner and the article of charges

whereby charges framed against the petitioner, was withdrawn
vide order dated 7.12.2021; that the Government issued an order

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128758593/ 10
Shri M. Pheijao Singh vs The State Of Manipur on 12 September, 2023
mistake.
14. The learned Government Advocate further
submitted that the inability of the respondents to supply
documents to the petitioner expeditiously may not be viewed as
victimization of the petitioner. Since the impugned order dated
11.1.2022 has already been cancelled, no cause of action exists
in maintaining the writ petition.
15. Adding further, the learned Government Advocate
submitted that during the preliminary hearing, the Inquiring
Authority was apprised by the Presenting Officer that the
authority desires to issue a modified charge sheet and that the
Commissioner, Departmental Enquiry also agreed the proposal
of the Inquiring Authority for serving revised charge sheet to the
petitioner. As such, vide order dated 18.12.2021, article of
charges against the petitioner were framed after the withdrawal
of the order dated 10.6.2020. The impugned order dated
WP(C) No. 37 of 2022 and WP(C) No.913 of 2021
P a g e | 12
18.12.2021 framing article of charges against the petitioner has
not been cancelled. Arguing so, the learned Government
Advocate prayed for dismissal of the writ petitions.
16. This Court considered the rival submissions and
also perused the materials available on record.

19. By the order dated 22.8.2020, the Additional Chief
Secretary (TA & Hills), appointed Shri R K Dinesh Singh (IAS),
Commissioner, Departmental Enquiry, as the Inquiring Authority
to inquire into the charges framed against the petitioner. In the
said order, the suspension period was extended for another three
months or till their revocation whichever is earlier. Again by the
order dated 17.9.2020, Shri H.Gyan Prakash, IAS,
Commissioner-cum-Secretary (Social Welfare/Veterinary) &
Special Secretary (Home) & Commissioner Departmental

28.9.2021, Shri Devesh Deval, IAS, Commissioner Departmental
Enquiry (DE), Government of Manipur was appointed as the
Inquiring Authority to inquire into the charges framed against the

cancellation of the first Inquiring Authority in the appointment
order of second Inquiring Authority and similarly, there is no

reference about the cancellation of the second Inquiring Authority
in the appointment order of third Inquiring Authority.
21. The petitioner has challenged the suspension order
dated 25.2.2020 in W.P.(C) No.688 of 2021 and, this Court, by
the order dated 15.11.2021, allowed the said writ petition. The

Shri M. Pheijao Singh vs The State Of Manipur on 12 September, 2023
which is violative of Rule 14(24)(a) of the CCS (CCA) Rules,
1965.
24. Rule 14(24)(a) of the CCS (CCA) Rules, 1965 reads
thus:
"14. Procedure for imposing major penalties.
.....
(24)(a) The Inquiring Authority should conclude the inquiry and submit his report within a period
of six months from the date of receipt of order of his appointment as Inquiring Authority."
25. On a perusal of Rule 14(24)(a), it is seen that the Inquiring Authority should conclude the
inquiry and submit his report within a period of six months from the date of receipt of order of his
appointment as Inquiring Authority.
26. In the present, the first appointment of Inquiring Authority was made on 22.8.2020 and after

Authority was appointed and thereafter, the WP(C) No. 37 of 2022 and WP(C) No.913 of 2021 P a g
e | 18 second Inquiring Authority was transferred, which necessitated the authority to appoint Shri
Devesh Deval, IAS as Inquiring Authority. However, the same is not reflected in the order of
appointment of the Inquiring Authority for the second and third time.
28. The learned Government Advocate further submitted that the preliminary hearing of the
departmental enquiry against the petitioner was held on 26.10.2021 and during the course of the
preliminary hearing the Inquiring Authority was apprised by the Presenting Officer that the
authority intends to issue a modified charge sheet.

seen that the charges framed against the petitioner dated 10.6.2020 were withdrawn and the
proceedings initiated against the petitioner by appointing Shri Devesh Deval, IAS dated 28.9.2021
was also cancelled. In this regard, the affidavit-in-opposition filed by the respondents 1 and 2 in

"2 (iii) The authorities issued Memorandum dated 10.6.2020 for holding enquiry

Pheijao Singh, Deputy Director (under suspension) Department of Tribal Affairs and Hills and
Drawing and Disbursing Officer and Head of Office of the Directorate of Tribal Affairs and Hills,
Manipur violated Rule 3 of the Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1964."
32. The learned senior counsel for the petitioner has made three-fold submissions. Firstly, the
second departmental enquiry without arriving at a finding qua the earlier enquiry on the same set of
facts is not permissible in law. Secondly, the authority had constituted special audit by the Director,
Local and Fund Audit, Manipur and after conducting the audit, the Director has submitted a report
to the effect that the amount recoverable from the petitioner is only Rs.45,881/-. Thirdly, pending
W.P.(C) No.913 of 2021 and that too without leave of the Court, the WP(C) No. 37 of 2022 and
WP(C) No.913 of 2021 P a g e | 27 second departmental proceedings was initiated, which is unjust
and unreasonable.
33. It is pertinent to note that with regard to the averments set out in paragraphs 13 to 15 of the writ
petition in W.P.(C) No.37 of 2022, the respondents 1 and 2 have filed affidavit-in-opposition in the
following manner:
and 15 of the writ petition, it is humbly submitted that the impugned Order
No.1/64/2020-TA & H (Pt-4) communicated on 11.1.2022 (Annexure-A/9 to the writ
petition) has now been cancelled vide order dated 21.1.2022. Hence, the allegations
of mala fide, illegalities, etc. are denied."
34. In paragraph 7 of the affidavit-in-opposition filed by the respondents 1 and 2, it has been stated
as under:
of the writ petition, it is humbly submitted that since the impugned order has already
been cancelled no cause of action survives (sic) and this writ petition is liable to be

closed."
WP(C) No. 37 of 2022 and WP(C) No.913 of 2021 P a g e | 28
35. The petitioner has filed a rejoinder to the affidavit- in-opposition filed by the respondents 1 and
2. In paragraphs 4 and 5 of the rejoinder, it is has been stated as under:
"4. That at Para 7 of the Affidavit-in- Opposition of W.P.(C) No.37 of 2022 the
Respondents have admitted that since the impugned order has already been
cancelled no cause of action survives and this Writ Petition is liable to be closed.
5. That the impugned order is order of 11.1.2022 and 18.12.2021 but cancellation
order mentions only order of 11.1.2022 (Annexure X-3 Page 10 and 11) but it is
mentioned at Para 7 that no cause of action survives.
In view of the position stated above, it is therefore prayed that the order of 18.12.2021
of framing of Article of charges of 2nd Department Proceeding may kindly be
quashed, Annexure A/9 of the Writ Petition No.37 of 2022 by allowing the present
Writ Petition (C) No.37 of 2022 for the ends of justice so that the case can be closed
as contended by the Respondents."
36. The stand taken by the respondents 1 and 2 in the affidavit-in-opposition and the reply to the
rejoinder filed in WP(C) No. 37 of 2022 and WP(C) No.913 of 2021 P a g e | 29 W.P.(C) No.37 of
2022 is admittedly contradictory to each other. The respondents 1 and 2 firmly averred in the
affidavit-in- opposition that since the impugned order has already been cancelled no cause of action
survives and the writ petition (W.P.(C) No.37 of 2022) may be closed.
37. A litigant can take different stands at different times, but cannot take contradictory stands in the
same case.
38. In Suzuki Parasrampuria Suitings Private Limited v. Official Liquidator of Mahendra
Petrochemicals Limited (In Liquidation) and others, (2018) 10 SCC 707, the Hon'ble Supreme Court
held:
"12. A litigant can take different stands at different times but cannot take
contradictory stands in the same case. A party cannot be permitted to approbate and
reprobate on the same facts and take inconsistent shifting stands. The untenability of
an inconsistent stand in the same case was considered in Amar Singh v. Union of
India, (2011) 7 SCC 69, observing as follows:
"50.This Court wants to make it clear that an action at law is not a game of chess. A
litigant who comes to court and invokes its writ jurisdiction must come with clean
hands. He cannot WP(C) No. 37 of 2022 and WP(C) No.913 of 2021 P a g e | 30
prevaricate and take inconsistent positions.""

39. When the respondents 1 and 2 contended that the impugned order No.1/64/2020-TA & H (Pt-4)
communicated on 11.1.2022 (Annexure-A9 to the writ petition) has now been cancelled vide order
dated 21.1.2022, it is unfair on the part of the respondents 1 and 2 in saying that the Government,
vide order dated 21.1.2022, cancelled only the letter dated 11.1.2022 issued against the petitioner
and the order dated 18.12.2021 framing article of charges against the petitioner has not been
cancelled. At the risk of repetition, this Court reiterates paragraph 7 of the affidavit-in-opposition
filed in W.P.(C) No.37 of 2022 that since the impugned order has already been cancelled no cause of
action survives and this Writ Petition is liable to be closed.
40. At this juncture, it is worthwhile to extract the communication letter dated 11.1.2022 hereunder:
"No.1/642020-TA&H(Pt.4) GOVERNMENT OF MANIPUR SECRETARIAT: TRIBAL
AFFAIRS & HILLS DEPARTMENT ***** Imphal, the 11th January, 2022 WP(C) No.
37 of 2022 and WP(C) No.913 of 2021 P a g e | 31 To Shri M Pheijao Singh Deputy
Director, TA&H Manipur Subject: Submission of fresh Article of Charge.
Sir, I am directed to refer to the subject mentioned above regarding submission of
fresh Article of Charge and request you kindly to submit written statement of defence
within 7 (seven) working days i.e. on or before 21st January, 2022 failing which the
enquiry will hold ex-parte.
Encl: As stated above.
Yours faithfully, Sd/-xxx (Dr. RA Ransing) Under Secretary (TA&H) Govt. of
Manipur"
41. It is also necessary to extract the contents in the order dated 21.1.2022, referred to by the
respondents 1 and 2 and the same reads thus:
"Whereas in pursuance of Office Memorandum being No.1/64/2020-TA&H(Pt-
3) dated 7.12.2021 an Office Memorandum WP(C) No. 37 of 2022 and WP(C) No.913 of 2021 P a g e
| 32 being No.1/64/2020-TA&H(Pt.4) dated 18.12.2021 proposing to hold an enquiry against Shri
M. Pheijao Singh, Deputy Director/TA&H, Manipur who was under
suspension by then but reinstated vide Order No.1/5/2021-TAH(H) dated 21.12.2021
was served upon the said Shri M.Pheijao Singh, Deputy Director/TA&H, Manipur
with a direction to submit his written statement of defence on the charges set out in
the Article of Charges (Annexure-I & II) enclosed with the Memorandum dated
18.12.2021 within 15 (fifteen days) of the receipt of the above said Memorandum
dated 18.12.2021.
Whereas, Orders being Nos. being No.1/64/2020-TA&H(Pt.3) dated 07.12.2-22 and
No.1/64/2020-TA&H (Pt.3) dated 07.12.2022 have been issued appointing Shri

Shri M. Pheijao Singh vs The State Of Manipur on 12 September, 2023
Devesh Deval, IAS, Commissioner, Departmental Enquiry, Government of Manipur
as the Inquiring Authority to inquire into the charges framed against the said Shri M.
Pheijao Singh and Shri Th. Chandrabir Singh, Retired Deputy Director (Admn),
RIMS, Imphal as the Presenting Officer of the case respectively.
Whereas through some inadvertent
mistakes, the Tribal Affairs and Hills
WP(C) No. 37 of 2022 and WP(C) No.913 of 2021 P a g e | 33 Department,
Government of Manipur, have issued a letter No.1/64/2020-TA&H (Pt.-4) dated
11.01.2022 to Shri M. Pheijao Singh, Deputy Director/TA&H, Manipur asking him to
submit written statement of defence within 7 (seven) working days, i.e. on or before
21.01.2022, failing which the enquiry will hold ex-parte which is nothing but
redundant.
Now, therefore it is to order that the letter No.1/64/2020-TA&H (Pt.4) dated 11.01.2022 is hereby
cancelled with immediate effect."
42. The respondents 1 and 2 filed reply to the rejoinder stating that the Memorandum/Order dated
18.12.2021 framing article of charges against the petitioner has not been cancelled. Admittedly, the
said stand taken by respondents 1 and 2 is totally inconsistent with the statement made in
paragraph 7 of the affidavit-in-opposition filed in W.P.(C) No.37 of 2022. The respondent
authorities should not blow hot and cold by taking inconsistent stands and protract the proceedings
unnecessarily.
43. Since the letter dated 11.1.2022 is the communication of fresh charges thereby calling upon the
petitioner to submit his written submission of defence, the cancellation includes the
Memorandum/Order dated 18.12.2021. WP(C) No. 37 of 2022 and WP(C) No.913 of 2021 P a g e |
34 The order dated 22.1.2022, nowhere states retaining of the Memorandum/Order dated
18.12.2021. If the intention of the concerned authority is not to cancel the Memorandum/Order
dated 18.12.2021, the said authority ought to have stated accordingly in the order dated 22.1.2022.
The aforesaid mistake committed by the authority cannot be legalised by saying that only the letter
dated 11.1.2022 is cancelled. The cancellation of the communication letter dated 11.1.2022 alone
cannot be made, as the said letter accompanied the Memorandum/Order dated 18.12.2021. That is
why the respondents 1 and 2 have filed their affidavit-in-opposition dated 28.9.2022 in W.P.(C)
No.37 of 2022 that since the impugned order has already been cancelled no cause of action survives
and the writ petition is liable to be closed. If the authority concerned has really not cancelled the
proceedings, it ought not to have filed such an affidavit praying to close the writ petition. Now taking
a volte-face, the respondents 1 and 2 cannot contend that the letter dated 11.1.2022 is alone
cancelled and the Memorandum/Order dated 18.12.2021 remained as such.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128758593/ 22
Shri M. Pheijao Singh vs The State Of Manipur on 12 September, 2023
44. Assuming arguendo, the Memorandum/Order dated 18.12.2021 remains as such, as rightly
argued by the learned counsel for the petitioner, initiating the second WP(C) No. 37 of 2022 and
WP(C) No.913 of 2021 P a g e | 35 departmental proceedings by framing of article of charges after
withdrawing the earlier article of charges on the same set of facts is not permissible. Admittedly,
there is no denial by the respondents 1 and 2 in the affidavit-in-opposition that the second
departmental proceedings on the same set of facts is not permissible.
45. The impugned Memorandum/Order dated 18.12.2021 is quoted hereunder for ready reference:
"No.1/64/2020-TA&H(Pt-4): It is proposed to hold an inquiry against Shri M.Pheijao
Singh, Deputy Director (under suspension), Department of Tribal Affairs and Hills,
Government of Manipur, Imphal under Rule 14 of the Central Civil Services
(Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1965. The substance of the imputations of
misconduct or misbehavior in respect of which the inquiry is proposed to be held is
set out in the enclosed statement of articles of charge (Annexure-I). A statement of
the imputations of misconduct or misbehavior in support of each article of charge is
enclosed (Annexure-II). A list of documents by which, and a list of witness by whom,
the articles of charge are proposed to be sustained are also enclosed (Annexure-III
and IV).
WP(C) No. 37 of 2022 and WP(C) No.913 of 2021 P a g e | 36
2. Shri M. Pheijao Singh, Deputy Director (under suspension), Department of Tribal
Affairs and Hills, Government of Manipur is directed to submit within 15 (fifteen)
days of the receipt of this Memorandum a written statement of his defence and also
to state whether he desires to be heard in person.
3. He is informed that an inquiry will be held only in respect of those articles of
charge as are not admitted. He would, therefore, specifically admit or deny each
article of charge.
4. Shri M. Pheijao Singh, Deputy Director (under suspension), Department of Tribal
Affairs and Hills, Government of Manipur Imphal is further informed that if he does
not submit his written statement of defence on or before the date specified in para 2
above or does not appear in person before the inquiring authority or otherwise fails
or refuses to comply with the provisions of the Central Civil Services (Classification,
Control and Appeal) Rules, 1965, or the Order/directions issued in pursuance of the
said rule, the Inquiring Authority may hold inquiry against him ex-parte.
5. Attention of Shri M. Pheijao Singh, Deputy Director (under suspension),
Department of WP(C) No. 37 of 2022 and WP(C) No.913 of 2021 P a g e | 37 Tribal
Affairs and Hills, Government of Manipur, Imphal is invited to Rule 20 of the Central
Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1964, under which no Government servant shall bring
or attempt to bring any political or outside influence to bear upon any superior
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128758593/ 23
Shri M. Pheijao Singh vs The State Of Manipur on 12 September, 2023
authority to further his interest in respect of matters pertaining to his service under
the Government, if any representation is received on his behalf from another person
in respect of any matter dealt with in these proceedings, it will be presumed that Shri
M. Pheijao Singh, Deputy Director (under suspension), Department of Tribal Affairs
and Hills, Government of Manipur, Imphal is aware of such a representation and that
it has been made at his instance and action will be taken against him for violation of
Rule 20 of the Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1964."
46. While withdrawing the first departmental proceedings under order dated 7.12.2021, the first
respondent has stated that the authority intends to issue a modified charge sheet.
47. It is pertinent to note that under Rule 14 of the CCS (CCA) Rules, 1965, under which the
disciplinary authority is WP(C) No. 37 of 2022 and WP(C) No.913 of 2021 P a g e | 38 initiating the
departmental proceedings, there is no provision enabling and empowering the authority to alter,
amend, modify the article of charges already issued.
48. The explanation to Rule 14(23) of the CCS (CCA) Rules, 1965 empowers the Inquiring Authority
to give a finding different from the original article of charges and it may record its findings on such
article of charges. Qua modifying, altering, amending the article of charges, finding can be recorded
other than original article of charges. As held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, the disciplinary
authority cannot read any expressions into the provisions of Rule 14 of the CCS (CCA) Rules to
modify, alter and amend the original article of charges.
49. On a reading of the article of charges framed during the first departmental proceedings
(challenged in W.P.(C) No.913 of 2021) and the second departmental proceedings (challenged in
W.P.(C) No.37 of 2022), it is clear that both are similar. As stated supra, there is no specific denial in
the affidavit-in-opposition that second departmental enquiry on the same set of facts without logical
conclusion of the earlier departmental enquiry is not permissible, being violative of Rule 15 of the
CCS (CCA) Rules, and it also amounts to admission by the respondents 1 and 2.
WP(C) No. 37 of 2022 and WP(C) No.913 of 2021 P a g e | 39
50. In Kanailal Bera v. Union of India and others, (2007) 11 SCC 517, the Hon'ble Supreme Court
held:
"6. ... Once a disciplinary proceeding has been initiated, the same must be brought to
its logical end meaning thereby a finding is required to be arrived at as to whether the
delinquent officer is guilty of charges levelled against him or not. In a given situation
further evidences may be directed to be adduced but the same would not mean that
despite holding a delinquent officer to be partially guilty of the charges levelled
against him another inquiry would be directed to be initiated on the selfsame charges
which could not be proved in the first inquiry."

51. An averment made in the petition is expected to be specifically denied by the replying party and
if there is no specific denial, such averments is deemed to have been admitted by the respondent.
52. In T.P.Gopalakrishnan v. State of Kerala, 2023 (1) SCALE 1, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held:
"38. ...... Thus, it can be said that the present cases pertain to the same set of facts
and are in respect of same offences, for the same WP(C) No. 37 of 2022 and WP(C)
No.913 of 2021 P a g e | 40 period, committed in the same capacity as the previous
three cases wherein the appellant herein was already prosecuted in the year 1999.
The core allegation in all these five cases pertains to misappropriation by making
false entries in the cash book. The allegation of the prosecution that two- thirds of the
auction amount was not remitted to the treasury would be covered under the
allegations of misappropriation of funds, that the appellant has already been
prosecuted for in the year 1999. The appellant is right in contending that the charge
in the first three cases were framed on 17.08.1999 which is much after the audit and
the prosecution would have been well aware of the misappropriation in respect of the
present cases on 17.08.1999."
53. In the light of the decision in T.P. Gopalakrishnan, supra, when we examine the present case, it
is clear that the second departmental proceedings pertains to the same set of facts and in respect of
the same allegation of the first departmental proceeding and allegedly committed in the capacity as
in the previous departmental proceedings, which was cancelled by the respondent authorities.
WP(C) No. 37 of 2022 and WP(C) No.913 of 2021 P a g e | 41
54. As righty argued by the learned counsel for the petitioner, the initiation of second departmental
proceedings thereby framing of article of charges on the selfsame charges as the earlier charges
without the leave of the Court is illegal, mala fide and also interfering with the administration of
justice. In other words, W.P.(C) No.913 of 2021 was filed on 13.12.2021 to quash the first
departmental proceeding. During the pendency of the said writ petition, the respondent authorities
issued the impugned order initiating second departmental proceedings by framing charges on
18.12.2021, which was communicated to the petitioner on 11.1.2022 without the leave of the Court.
The argument of the learned senior counsel for the petitioner is that the action of the respondent
authorities is not only mala fide, but also an abuse of process of the Court to render W.P.(C) No.913
of 2021 otiose and infructuous. This Court finds some force in the submission made by the learned
counsel for the petitioner. Admittedly, the aforesaid plea of the petitioner has not been controverted
by the respondents. On the other hand, the respondents have stated in the affidavit-in-opposition
filed in W.P.(C) No.913 of 2021 that "no cause of action survives and the writ petition is not
maintainable". Similarly, the stand taken in the affidavit-in-opposition filed by the respondents 1
and 2 in W.P.(C) WP(C) No. 37 of 2022 and WP(C) No.913 of 2021 P a g e | 42 No.37 of 2022 is that
"since the impugned order has already been cancelled no cause of action survives and this writ
petition is liable to be closed". The impugned order assailed in W.P.(C) No.37 of 2022 is the order
dated 18.12.2021, which was communicated on 11.1.2022. This Court in the earlier paragraph held
that the second departmental proceedings initiated against the petitioner for the same set of
selfsame charges is not legally sustainable.

Shri M. Pheijao Singh vs The State Of Manipur on 12 September, 2023
55. The learned senior counsel for the petitioner argued that the authority had constituted a special
audit done by the Director, Local and Fund Audit, Manipur, and, after conducting the audit, the
Director has submitted a report to the effect that the amount recoverable from the petitioner is only
Rs.45,881/-. In support, the learned counsel drew the attention of this Court to the report of the
Director, Local Fund Audit, Manipur (Annexure- A/8). On a perusal of the audit report, this Court
finds that the audit was conducted for the period from 2011-2012 to 2019-20. Upon auditing, the
authority submitted the report in respect of the petitioner as follows:
"C) Shri M. Pheijao Singh, Deputy Director w.e.f. 25/04/2014 to 30.08.2016 WP(C)
No. 37 of 2022 and WP(C) No.913 of 2021 P a g e | 43 An amount of Rs.87,68,631/-
standing as outstanding advance against Shri M. Pheijao Singh, Deputy
Director/former HOO/DDO (TA & Hills) now under suspension w.e.f.
25/02/2020. During the test check of the documents submitted by the office of the TA & Hills and
Shri M. Pheijao Singh, Dy.
Director/TA & Hills, former HOO/DDO (under suspension) submitted documents to the Director,
TA & Hills. It is found that the amount of Rs.87,22,650/- charged to him as liability stands
Rs.45,881/- only as an advance as per documents enclosed.
In view of examination/auditing of expenditures incurred by Shri M. Pheijao Singh, almost the issue
is cleared excepting the amount of Rs.45,881/-. The amount be recovered immediately.
It is pertinent to mention that Shri M. Pheijao Singh may be allowed to revoke his suspension
immediately as per his statement of Accounts occurred during his tenure."
56. While issuing the first departmental proceedings, the respondents stated that during the period
from 24.4.2014 to 31.8.2016, the petitioner had misappropriated a sum of Rs.3,96,46,031.00 of the
Government money. In the second WP(C) No. 37 of 2022 and WP(C) No.913 of 2021 P a g e | 44
departmental proceedings, the respondent stated that during the period from 24.4.2014 to
31.8.2016, the petitioner had caused loss to the tune of Rs.34,86,761/-, Rs.1,02,47,367/-, 4,28,599/-,
16,82,109/- and Rs.3,10,98,184/- respectively of the Government money and he has failed to make
any attempt to recover a sum of Rs.79,90,500/- from M/s. Kamal Polymers Industries. When the
auditing authority audited the accounts for the period from 2011-2012 to 2019-2020 and came to
the conclusion that the liability stands on the petitioner is only Rs.45,881/-, the misappropriation of
the Government money alleged by the respondent authorities in the charge memo is highly doubtful.
That apart, the report of the auditor is prior to the initiation of the second departmental
proceedings.
57. It is not the case of the respondents that the audit report is not reliable. In paragraph 12 of the
writ petition, the petitioner averred that since the audit report is in favor of the petitioner, the
authority has not put the report into action, which clearly and abundantly proved the mala fide and
bias of the authority. With regard to the averments made paragraph 12 of the writ petition, the
respondents 1 and 2 filed affidavit-in- opposition as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128758593/ 26
Shri M. Pheijao Singh vs The State Of Manipur on 12 September, 2023
WP(C) No. 37 of 2022 and WP(C) No.913 of 2021 P a g e | 45 "5. That with reference
to para No.12 of the writ petition, it is denied that there has been any mala fide and
bias on the point of authority."
58. Except the above, no particulars have been mentioned by the respondents in the
affidavit-in-opposition that the audit report dated 24.6.2021 cannot be used by the petitioner. As
rightly argued by the learned counsel for the petitioner, since the audit report is in favour of the
petitioner and Rs.45,881/- is shown as liability of the petitioner out of the charged amount of
Rs.87,22,650/-, the respondent authorities are bound to put the report into action. Further, the
auditing authority has recommended for revocation of suspension of the petitioner. If the petitioner
has committed huge loss to the Government, the auditing authority would not recommend
revocation of suspension order.
59. The initiation of departmental proceedings by issuance of article of charges against the
petitioner and its subsequent cancellation by the respondent authorities for one reason or the other
would definitely prove the cool calculation and malevolent design to harass, humiliate and victimize
the petitioner. As stated supra, under Rule 14(24)(a) of the CCS WP(C) No. 37 of 2022 and WP(C)
No.913 of 2021 P a g e | 46 (CCA) Rules, 1965, the Inquiring Authority has to conclude the inquiry
and submit his report within six months from the date of receipt of the order of appointment.
60. Though the respondent authorities initiated departmental proceedings against the petitioner
way back in the year 2020, they have not taken keen interest in proceeding further to reach a logical
conclusion in the departmental proceedings. In other words, the first enquiry could not be brought
to its logical end and the same charges were withdrawn and second enquiry has been initiated on the
same set of facts which are split up facts by splitting the article of charges which is admittedly not
permissible in law.
61. The role model of governance and decision making thereof should manifest justice, fair play,
equity and free from illegalities, arbitrariness. The cardinal principle of governance in a civilized
society based on rule of law must create an impression that the decision making is motivated on the
consideration of probity, strictly adhering to rule of law, law declared by the Court and the
principles of service jurisprudence. This Court is highlighting the above only to show the intention
and action of the respondent authorities to victimize the petitioner. Admittedly, in the case on hand,
the respondent authorities have taken WP(C) No. 37 of 2022 and WP(C) No.913 of 2021 P a g e | 47
inconsistent pleas. Taking the inconsistent pleas by a party makes a conduct far from satisfactory. As
rightly argued by the learned counsel for the petitioner, the action of respondent authorities is not
only mala fide, but also an abuse of process of the Court. On the whole, this Court is of the
considered view that there are merits in the writ petitions. Exercising the arbitrary power, the first
respondent has issued the impugned orders, which are not sustainable in the eyes of law and,
therefore, the same are liable to be quashed.
62. In the result,
(i) W.P.(C) Nos. 37 of 2022 and 913 of 2021 are allowed.
