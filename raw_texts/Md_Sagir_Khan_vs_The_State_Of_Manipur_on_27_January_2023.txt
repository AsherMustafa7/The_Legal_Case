Md. Sagir Khan vs The State Of Manipur on 27 January, 2023
@ Laila, to preventive detention in exercise of power under W.P. (Crl.) No. 50 of
2022 Page 1 Section 3 (2) of the National Security Act, 1980. He seeks a
consequential writ of habeas corpus to set her at liberty forthwith.
[2] Heard Ph. Sanajaoba, learned counsel for the petitioner; Mr. Th. Vashum, learned
Government Advocate, appearing for respondents No. 1 & 2; and Mr. BR Sharma,
learned CGSC, appearing for respondent No. 3. [3] The primary ground of attack
urged by Mr. Ph. Sanajaoba, learned counsel, is that there was no material before the
detaining authority to surmise that there was any likelihood of the petitioner's
mother being released on bail in the near future. He would point out that she was
arrested in September, 2022, in connection with 3 FIRs, viz., FIR No. 25 (5) 2022
Khongjom PS; FIR No. 77 (6) 2022 Kakching PS; and FIR No. 26 (7) 2022 Andro PS.
Two of these FIRs pertained to offences under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention)
Act, 1967. [4] Perusal of the impugned order of detention reflects that the District
Magistrate, Thoubal District, noted in unnumbered para 4 thereof as follows:-
'And whereas, I am satisfied from the police report that Mrs. Thambalmani @ Laila
(46 yrs.) W/o, Md. Tomba of Yairipok Singa Ethei Mapal, P.O & P.S. Yairipok,
District-Thoubal, Manipur who is now in judicial custody and is likely to be released
on bail in the near future and also she is likely to continue to act in the manner
prejudicial to the security of the State and maintenance of public order, and also that
an alternative preventive measure is called for.' However, the documents furnished to
the detenu along with the grounds of detention made no mention of any bail petition
having been filed by the detenu in connection with any of the FIRs registered against
her. [5] The affidavit-in-opposition filed by the Deputy Secretary (Home),
Government of Manipur, also does not shed any light on this aspect of the matter.
W.P. (Crl.) No. 50 of 2022 Page 2 No mention is made therein of any bail petition
having been filed by the detenu in relation to any of the cases registered against her,
whereby it could be apprehended that there was a likelihood of her being released on
bail. [6] The original files pertaining to this detention case were produced by Mr. Th.
Vashum, learned Government Advocate. However, there is not a single document
found in either of the files referring to bail applications, if any, filed by the detenu in
relation to the 3 FIRs registered against her. In effect, the statement made by the
District Magistrate, Thoubal District, in unnumbered para 4 of the impugned
detention order had no basis whatsoever and there was no material placed before him
to infer that there was a likelihood of the detenu being released on bail, necessitating
issuance of the detention order.
[7] Significantly, in Rekha vs. State of Tamil Nadu, through Secretary to Government
and another [(2011) 5 SCC 244], the Supreme Court observed that there would be a
real possibility of release of a person who is already in custody provided he has
moved a bail application, which is pending, as in such a case, the detaining authority
can reasonably conclude that there is likelihood of the detenu being released on bail.

Md. Sagir Khan vs The State Of Manipur on 27 January, 2023
Reference may also be made to A. Shanthi (Smt) vs. Govt. of T.N. and others [(2006)
9 SCC 711], wherein, the Supreme Court noted its earlier judgment in T.V. Saravanan
vs. State [(2006) 2 SCC 664] holding to the effect that the imminent possibility of the
appellant therein coming out on bail was merely the ipse dixit of the detaining
authority unsupported by any material whatsoever as there was no cogent material
before the detaining authority on the basis of which he could satisfy himself that the
detenu was likely to be released on bail. The Supreme Court pointed out that the
inference in that regard had to be drawn from the available material on record and in
the absence of such W.P. (Crl.) No. 50 of 2022 Page 3 material, the mere ipse dixit of
the detaining authority would not be sufficient to sustain the order of detention.
[8] In the light of the aforestated precedential edicts, it would be incumbent upon a
detaining authority to verify whether or not the person in custody has actually moved
a bail petition so as to determine the possibility of his/her being released on bail and
only thereafter, proceed to exercise power under the special law of preventive
detention.
[9] In the case on hand, except for the bald statement in unnumbered para 4 of the
impugned detention order, there is no material whatsoever to support the conclusion
that the detenu may be released on bail. Based on the mere ipse dixit of the detaining
authority, the impugned order of detention cannot be sustained.
[10] W.P. (Crl.) No. 50 of 2022 is accordingly allowed, setting aside the order of
detention dated 11.11.2022 passed by the District Magistrate, Thoubal District, in
exercise of power under Section 3 (2) of the National Security Act, 1980. All
consequential proceedings based thereon shall also stand set aside.
The detenu, Mrs. Thabalmani @ Laila, presently incarcerated in Manipur Central
Jail, Imphal, shall be set at liberty forthwith unless her continued incarceration is
validly required in connection with any other case.
In the circumstances, there shall be no order as to costs.
