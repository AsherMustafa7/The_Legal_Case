Jabalpur, Dated : 27-03-2019
Shri Uttam Maheshwari, learned counsel for the petitioner.
Shri J.K. Pillai, learned counsel for the respondent.
Petitioner has filed this petition under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. to quash the proceedings of
RCT/3210/2012 pending before the JMFC, Bhopal.
Heard on I.A. No.4017/2019, an application for stay.
I t is submitted by learned counsel for the petitioner that against the order of assessment, the
establishment has been granted interim protection by learned Appellate Tribunal, assessing
contribution for period May 2002 to December, 2009, wherein the complaint pertains to
non-remittance of contribution for the period July, 2004 to September, 2004. Thus as the aforesaid
period for which complaint has been lodged has already been stayed by the learned appellate
authority, thus, the balance of convenience is in favour of the petitioner. It is further submitted that
the establishment never engaged 20 or more employees and after closure of business it has been
dissolved in April, 2005 therefore, if any contributions are recovered from the petitioner, then it
would neither benefit of assessment nor the workman. Accordingly, if the impugned proceedings are
not stayed, then the petitioner would suffer an irreparable damage.
It is submitted by counsel for the petitioner that criminal complaint No. RCT 3210/2012 has been
instituted on the report of Assistant Provident Funds Commissioner, SRO Bhopal dated
01/03/2012. This order has been stayed by the Employees Provident Funds Appellate Tribunal, New
Delhi dated 17/05/2012, So the proceeding in RCT/ 3210/2012 be stayed.
Learned counsel for the respondent opposed the prayer of stay and supported the order of JMFC.
Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, further 2 MCRC-8896-2019 proceedings of the
RCT/3210/2012 shall remain stayed till the next date of hearing.
List the case after two weeks.
C.C. as per rules.
