THIS MISCELLANEOUS FIRST APPEAL IS FILED
UNDER SECTION 173(1) OF THE MOTOR VEHICLES ACT,
1988 AGAINST THE JUDGMENT AND AWARD 08.02.2010
PASSED IN MVC NO.8750/2007 ON THE FILE OF VIII
ADDITIONAL JUDGE, MEMBER, MACT, COURT OF SMALL
CAUSES, BANGALORE CITY, AWARDING A
COMPENSATION OF RS.9,06,000/- WITH INTEREST AT 6%
P.A. FROM THE DATE OF PETITION TILL DEPOSIT.
THIS APPEAL COMING ON FOR FINAL HEARING THIS
DAY, THE COURT THROUGH VIDEO CONFERENCE
DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING:
JUDGMENT
This appeal is filed by the insurer challenging the Judgment and Award passed by the Motor
Accident Claims Tribunal - V, Court of Small Causes, Bengaluru City in MVC No.8750/2007, in so
far as it relates to the liability imposed upon it by the Tribunal to pay the compensation awarded.
2. The claim petition would disclose that on 10.11.2007 at about 7.45 pm., the deceased was riding
his motor cycle and when he reached Sri.Shanimahatma temple, Naganathapura, a JCB bearing
registration No.KA-51-N-4498 came in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the
deceased. As a result, the deceased sustained serious injuries and was shifted to St.John's Hospital,
where he succumbed to injuries on the next day. A case was registered by Madivala Traffic Police
Station in Crime No.466/2007 against the driver of the JCB under Sections 279, 337 and 304A of
IPC. The claimants who were the legal representatives of the deceased filed a claim petition seeking
compensation of a sum of Rs.50,00,000/-.
3. The insurer contended that the JCB in question was insured by it, but, the driver of the JCB did
not possess a valid driving licence. The driver possessed only a licence to drive a light motor vehicle
and there was no endorsement permitting the driver to drive a JCB. It further contended that the
rider of the motor cycle was responsible for the accident.

4. Before the Tribunal, the claimant No.1 was examined as PW1 and she marked Exs.P1 to P25, while
for the respondents, an executive of the insurer was examined as RW1 and the Assistant RTO was
examined as RW2, while RW3 was the owner of the JCB in question and Exs.R1 to R4 were marked.
5. The Tribunal considered the evidence on record and held that the claimants were entitled to a
sum of Rs.9,06,000/- as compensation along with interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the
date of claim petition till the date of deposit in the Court.
6. The Tribunal while considering the question of liability, held that the JCB in question was a
construction vehicle and that construction equipment would not fall within the Class of non
transport vehicle and that the driver of the JCB not only possessed a driving licence to drive the light
motor vehicle but also a light motor vehicle cab. Thus, the Tribunal held that the driver of the
offending JCB was authorized to drive the JCB in question, since it fell within the meaning of a 'light
transport vehicle'. The Tribunal therefore, fastened the liability to pay the compensation upon the
insurer of the offending vehicle - JCB.
7. Learned counsel for the insurer in this appeal contended that the JCB is not a vehicle which is
classified anywhere in the Motor Vehicles Act as either a 'transport vehicle' or as a 'construction
vehicle'. Learned counsel further contended that in view of evidence of RW2, it is apparent that the
vehicle in question was a special type of vehicle which required special driving skills and therefore,
the learned counsel for the appellant-insurer would contend that the driver ought to have possessed
an endorsement to drive the JCB. The learned counsel further contended that in the light of
evidence of RW2, the Tribunal was not justified in fixing the liability to pay the compensation upon
the insurer.
8. Per contra, the learned counsel for the claimants contended that the JCB is treated as a
'construction equipment' as defined under Rule 2(ca) of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 and
that the notification issued by the Central Government under Section 41(4) of the Motor Vehicles
Act, 1988 specifies construction vehicle as 'non-transport vehicle' and therefore, in view of the
Judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Mukund Dewangan Vs. Oriental Ins.Co.Ltd. reported in
2017(14) SCC 663, the driver of the JCB in question who held a licence to drive the light motor
vehicle was authorized to drive a non transport vehicle as well.
9. The learned counsel for the respondents relied upon the Judgment of this Court in MFA
No.21800/2010 and connected appeals, wherein this Court while considering the very same
question held that a JCB is a construction equipment vehicle and is considered as a non transport
vehicle. In that case too, this Court was dealing with a case of JCB vehicle which was responsible for
an accident claim.
10. It is not in dispute that the Central Government in terms of its notification dated 19.06.1992 had
clearly delineated 'construction equipment vehicles' as 'non transport vehicles'. In view of the fact
that the driver of the JCB in question possessed a licence to drive a light motor vehicle and in view of
what was held by the Apex Court in the case of Mukund Dewangan, the driver of the JCB was indeed
authorized to drive a JCB in question and therefore, the Tribunal was right in fixing the liability to

pay the compensation upon the insurer.
11. There is no merit in the appeal and the same is dismissed.
12. The amount in deposit is directed to be transferred to the Tribunal for further orders.
