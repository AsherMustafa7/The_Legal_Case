**********
COMMON ORDER
These original petitions are filed at the instance of two employees of the respondent Company.
2.It is the case of the petitioners that the ex-parte award came to be passed by the learned
Arbitrator. The petitioners moved the learned Arbitrator seeking to set aside the ex-parte award
against them. However, even the setting aside applications came to be rejected by the learned
Arbitrator and therefore, the petitioners have come up by way of challenge to the said award by
means of the above respective original petitions. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis O.P.Nos.524 &
525 of 2014
3.I have heard Mrs.Lakshmipriya and Mr.C.Manohar Gupta, learned counsel for the petitioners and
Mr.M.S.Murali, for M/s.R & P Partners, learned counsel for the respondents in both the original
petitions.
4.The learned counsel for the petitioners would attack the award of the learned Arbitrator on the
ground that the petitioners were not put on notice by the arbitration proceedings and the learned
Arbitrator erroneously refused to entertain the applications to set aside the ex-parte award as well.
Further, according to the learned counsel for the petitioners, the learned Arbitrator has not applied
his mind to any of the claims and has merely endorsed the claims made by the respondent by
passing the awards as prayed for, without going into the merits and legalities in the claims made by
the respondents.
5.The learned counsel for the petitioners would further submit that even if the respondents had
chosen to remain ex-parte, it was still incumbent for the Arbitrator to decide the claims on its
merits. In this regard, the learned counsel for the petitioners would take me through the award to
fortify her contention that there has been absolutely no discussion https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
O.P.Nos.524 & 525 of 2014 whatsoever, as to how and why the respondents are entitled to succeed
to the claims made in the petitions. The learned counsel for the petitioners would also take me
through the relevant documents with regard to non service of the copy of the award and as to how
the copy of the award came to be obtained by the petitioners, which alone enable them to challenge
the award before this Court.
6.The learned counsel for the petitioners would also refer to Section 31(3) of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996 and contend that it is a clear violation of the mandate of Section 31(3),
warranting interference. The learned counsel for the petitioners would also refer to the following
decisions in support of her contentions:
1.P.Nagarajan Vs. Southern Structurals Limited and Others (MANU/TN/0532/1995).

10.Rochem Separation Systems (India) Private Limited Vs. Nirtech Private Limited
(MANU/MHOR/21331/2023).
7.Per contra, Mr.M.S.Murali, learned counsel for the respondents would submit that the original
petition is hopelessly barred by limitation referring to Section 34(3) of the Act. The learned counsel
would further submit that the award has to be challenged within a period of three months with a
grace period of 30 days and according to the learned counsel for the respondents, the petitioners
came to be aware of the award dated 02.08.2011 having been passed even as on 15.09.2011. When
the petitioners came to be aware of the award dated 02.08.2011 in September 2011, the original
petition filed in the year 2014 is hopelessly barred by limitation. The learned counsel for the
respondents would further submit that the Arbitrator has discussed the documents filed by the
claimants/respondents and therefore it is not as if the Arbitrator has not applied his mind before
passing of the award. He would therefore pray for dismissal of the original petition.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis O.P.Nos.524 & 525 of 2014
8.I have carefully considered the submissions advanced by the learned counsel on either side. I have
also gone through the records produced by way of typed set of papers and the pleadings as well as
the impugned award.
9.The respondents made the following claims before the Arbitrator:
(i) Permanent injunction restraining the
petitioners herein from using/misusing and/or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/180293096/ 4
Saju Kalilyuvilayil Varghese vs M/S.Financial Software & Systems (P) ... on 21 December, 2024
disclosing confidential information and trade secrets of the claimant either directly/indirectly or in
any other manner whatsoever without the prior written consent of the claimant; and
(ii) Directing the petitioners to pay Rs.7,50,000/- together with interest at 18% per annum from 3rd
November 2008 till the date of payment and costs of the arbitration.
10.Admittedly, the respondent did not appear before the Sole Arbitrator and on 02.08.2011, the
Arbitrator proceeded to pass an award in favour of the respondent. On 19.09.2011, the Arbitrator
has sent a E-mail to https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis O.P.Nos.524 & 525 of 2014 the parties
informing them that one S.R.Sundaram, learned counsel for the petitioners has filed an application
to set aside the ex-parte award dated 02.08.2011 and that the respondent herein was called upon to
file counter by 19.10.2011. By notice dated 01.02.2012, the Arbitrator directed the respondent to
arrange for a sitting on 29.02.2012 to proceed to hear the setting aside applications. However, at
request of the petitioners herein, the matter was adjourned to 06.04.2012 and subsequently to other
dates. Finally, the learned Arbitrator proceeded to dismiss the setting aside applications on
21.08.2012. Thereafter, a request was made by the petitioners seeking duly scanned award copy, in
and by a letter dated 27.08.2013. In response to the said request, the Arbitrator issued a notice
dated 31.08.2013, enclosing a scanned copy of the award as requested by the petitioners and at the
same time pointing out that the petitioners were aware of the award dated 02.08.2011, as admittedly
filed application to set aside the ex-parte award on 15.09.2011 and that it was only the petitioners
who had not remitted Rs.1000/- for preparation and sending of the award. After obtaining the
copies from the Arbitrator, the above petitions have been filed.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis O.P.Nos.524 & 525 of 2014
11.It is not in dispute that the above original petitions filed within the period of three months as
permitted under Section 34(3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 after receiving the
award copy from the Arbitrator in September 2011.
12.The main contention of the learned counsel for the respondent is that the petitioners were aware
of the award even in September 2011 and therefore the original petitions filed in October 2013 were
clearly and hopelessly barred by Limitation. Section 34(3) of the Act is extracted hereunder for easy
reference:
“ Section 34(3):- Application for setting aside arbitral awards.
(3) An application for setting aside may not be made after three months have elapsed
from the date on which the party making that application had received the arbitral
award or, if a request had been made under Section 33, from the date on which that
request had been disposed of by the arbitral Tribunal.
Provided that if the Court is satisfied that the applicant was prevented by sufficient cause from
making the application within the said period of three months, it may entertain the application
within a further period of thirty days, but not thereafter.” https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis

Saju Kalilyuvilayil Varghese vs M/S.Financial Software & Systems (P) ... on 21 December, 2024
O.P.Nos.524 & 525 of 2014
13.A plain reading of Section 34 of the Act makes it clear that when a party aggrieved by the award
intends to challenge the same by way of Section 34 petition, the said application for setting aside the
award has to be necessarily made within three months from the date of receipt of the arbitral award
by such party aggrieved and there is further 30 days window period provided for making an
application beyond the permissible 90 days period. As far as dates are concerned, it is clear that the
original petition has been filed beyond 120 days from the date of passing of the award or even the
date on which the petitioners admittedly had knowledge of the passing of the award. However, the
question that remains to be answered is as to whether the relevant date would be the date of
knowledge of the passing of the award or the date of receipt of the copy of the award. The language
employed under Section 34 leaves no room for any discretion.
14.It is clear that Section 34 application would have to be made within three months from the date
of receipt of the copy of the award by the party aggrieved by the award and intends to challenge the
same. Therefore, in my opinion, imputing date of knowledge of the award on the petitioners
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis O.P.Nos.524 & 525 of 2014 would not be relevant in determining
the question of limitation. In any event, in the light of the discussion to be made hereunder, it would
only make it abundantly clear that the original petitions cannot be thrown out on the ground of
limitation. The award was admittedly passed ex-parte, for non appearance of the respondent.
15.It is the specific case of the petitioners that the petitioners had engaged a counsel by name,
S.R.Sundaram who had entrusted the case to his junior by name Premkumar, Advocate to conduct
the arbitration proceedings and that the petitioners were never aware of any of the hearing dates
including the passing of the ex-parte award under bonafide impression that the award being passed
ex-parte could be set aside on the advice of their counsel, S.R.Sundaram. The petitioners moved an
application for setting aside the ex-parte award dated 02.08.2011. However, the said application
filed by the petitioners was also dismissed on 31.08.2013.
16.It is the further specific case of the petitioners that the original award was never received by them
until 05.09.2013. According to the petitioners, they are deprived of an opportunity of contesting the
claim of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis O.P.Nos.524 & 525 of 2014 the respondent and in any
event, the impugned award was passed without adhering to not only the principles of natural justice
but also was perverse and contrary to the equity and justice and good conscious. The learned
counsel for the petitioners would vehemently contend that the respondent had to show the positive
evidence before the Tribunal that the petitioners had made use of trade secrets and had rendered
themselves liable to suffer the award for injunction and damages.
17.I would first take up the issue regarding limitation. As contended by the learned counsel for the
petitioners, the original petition was filed within the stipulated time under Section 34(3) of the Act,
on receipt of a copy of the award in September 2013. However, a strong objection taken to the filing
of the original petitions by the learned counsel for the respondent on the ground that the petitioners
had knowledge of the ex-parte award dated 02.08.2011 even in September 2011 when they
admittedly approached the Arbitrator seeking to set aside the ex-parte award passed against them.

Saju Kalilyuvilayil Varghese vs M/S.Financial Software & Systems (P) ... on 21 December, 2024
As I have already found the clear language employed under Section 34(3) is 'only the date of receipt
of the copy of the award' therefore the date of knowledge cannot be substituted in the place of date
of receipt of the copy https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis O.P.Nos.524 & 525 of 2014 of the award to
deny the petitioners right to challenge the award. However, it is seen from the records that
admittedly, neither the Arbitrator in the various correspondence by way of E-mails with the
petitioners nor the respondent have been able to establish that the copy of the award was only
served on the petitioners immediately after the award came to be passed in August 2013.
18.In fact, it is contended that at the centre where the arbitration proceedings took place, they had
updated the software and therefore no records were available with them also. Further, the Arbitrator
himself has stated that his computer was attacked by virus and he was also not in a position to
retrieve any of the records pertaining to service of copy of the award on the petitioners herein. In
fact, even in the award, I find that the Arbitrator has recorded that a counter statement was filed
along with the restoration petitions dated 06.06.2011 raising certain preliminary issues alone and
that the said counter statement would not have been signed by the petitioners herein but only of
their counsel who had not even filed a vakalat nor produced any Power of Attorney to represent the
petitioners and since the respondent had not appeared, the Arbitrator did not choose to award costs
as well.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis O.P.Nos.524 & 525 of 2014
19.Therefore, in the light of the above and the materials available on record, it is clear that there was
no objection for the petitioners herein to receive the copy of of the award before September 2013
and consequently, the filing of the original petitions in October 2014, within the time frame
stipulated under Section 34(3) of the Act. This question is answered in favour of the petitioners.
20.Coming to the challenge to the award on its merits, as rightly contended by the learned counsel
for the petitioners, the award is literally one paragraph award, where the Arbitrator refers to filing of
proof affidavit enclosing filed documents, the nature of the filed documents are set out and the
Arbitrator merely proceeds to hold that since there is no contra evidence to the oral evidence and
the claimant has proved the case and therefore are entitled to both the reliefs of permanent
injunction as well as compensation.
21.As I have already set out the reliefs prayed for in the claim petition by the respondents, the
Arbitrator ought to have fundamentally discussed the reliefs and whether the respondents herein is
entitled to the reliefs based https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis O.P.Nos.524 & 525 of 2014 on the
available materials. The first prayer pertains to a permanent injunction to restrain the petitioners
herein from disclosing confidential information and trade secrets. In order to entitle to the said
relief, the claimant would have to necessarily show that the petitioners were in the know of any
confidential information or trade secrets of the respondents Company as employer and that they
had used or other misused such confidential information. Therefore, strong evidence had to be let in
by the respondents claimants to before becoming entitle to the relief of permanent injunction.
However, there is absolutely no discussion in the award as to any of such requirements having been
met by the claimants.

Saju Kalilyuvilayil Varghese vs M/S.Financial Software & Systems (P) ... on 21 December, 2024
22.Similarly, with regard to the relief of compensation for damages to the tune of Rs.7,50,000/-,
together with interest also there is absolutely no evidence on the side of the claimants as to how they
have become entitled to loss as result of any act of omission on the part of the petitioners, leave
alone quantifying the loss suffered by them, the Arbitrator has merely endorsed the claims made by
the respondent and passed an award in their favour.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis O.P.Nos.524 & 525 of 2014
23.The learned counsel for the petitioners has placed reliance on the judgement of the Hon'ble
Division Bench of this Court in Transtonnelstroy – Afcons (JV) and Others Vs. Chennai Metro Rail
Limited reported in 2023 (3) CTC 266, where the Division Bench of this Court held that referring to
Sections 18 and 24(3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act that full opportunity is not given to any
of the parties then it would be a ground for setting aside the arbitral award under Section
34(2)(a)(iii) of the Act, elaborating on the phrase “unable to present the case”. The Division Bench
further held that the parties should be given full opportunity under Section 18 of the Act and that
even under Section 24(3), false statement/documents or other information suppled to or application
made to the Tribunal to one party shall be communicated to the other party and if any materials are
taken behind the back of the parties by the arbitral Tribunal, on which the parties had no
opportunity to comment would amount to a parties otherwise being unable to present the case.
24.Reliance is also placed on the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Asma Lateef and Others
Vs. Shabbir Ahmad and Others reported in 2024 (1) CTC 520, where the Hon'ble Supreme Court
referring to the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis O.P.Nos.524 & 525 of 2014 decision in Balraj
Taneja and Another Vs. Sunil Madan and Another reported in (1999) 8 SCC 396, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court held that the judgment should contain the concise statement of the case, points for
determination and the decision thereof and the reasons for such decisions and that in judicial
proceedings there cannot be arbitrary orders and a Judge cannot cannot say merely the suit decreed
or dismissed and the whole process of reasoning has to be set out for deciding the case one way or
the other. The above said decisions would squarely apply to the facts of the present case.
25.Next, the learned counsel fo the petitioner would place reliance on the decision of the High Court
of Kerala in Devchand Construction Vs. Union of India, Rep. by the Deputuy Chief Engineer,
Southern Railway, Kannur passed in Arb.A.No.29 of 2018, where the Division Bench of Kerala High
Court referring to Section 73 of the Contract Act and held that when a contract is broken the party
who alleges breach and seeks compensation has to prove that such breach of contract was
occasioned because of the other party and that such breach resulted in direct loss or damage
suffered. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis O.P.Nos.524 & 525 of 2014
26.Here as already discussed, the Arbitrator has not discussed the entitlement of the compensation
claimed by the respondent for the alleged breach. In fact, as rightly pointed out by the learned
counsel for the petitioners, the respondents have not even proved that there has been any leaking of
confidential information with the petitioners in the first place leave alone such confidential
information being used or misused by the petitioners, thereby resulting in losses suffered by the
respondents.

Saju Kalilyuvilayil Varghese vs M/S.Financial Software & Systems (P) ... on 21 December, 2024
27.It is settled law that under Section 31(3) of the Arbitration and conciliation Act, the arbitral
award shall state the reasons upon which the award is passed. The only exceptions to such
requirement are when the parties themselves have agreed that no reasons need to be given or where
the award is passed on agreed terms between the parties under Section 30. Both the exceptions are
not applicable in the present case and therefore, the requirement of reasoned award is not dispensed
with. Unfortunately, the award, as already discussed above, is an one paragraph award, merely
discussing the proof affidavit and documents filed therein and no reasons have been assigned for the
decision taken by the learned Arbitrator to pass the award. Therefore, it is clear that there is no
patent illegality or perversity https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis O.P.Nos.524 & 525 of 2014 in the
award, warranting under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
28.For all the above reasons, both the original petitions are liable to be allowed.
29.In fine, both the Original Petitions are allowed and the award dated 02.08.2011 is hereby set
aside. There shall be no order as to costs.
