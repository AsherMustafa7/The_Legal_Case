The appointment of the appellant as a Constable came to be questioned by the department itself on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/121267767/ 1
Shailesh Kumar Mall @ Shailesh Kumar vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 8 February, 2019
the ground that his appointment under special circumstances by the then police authorities was
without following the procedure prescribed in law.
2. The appellant was put to a show cause on 14 th June, 2003 after almost 12 years of having served
the police force to which he gave reply on 26th June, 2003. The reply refers to the selection having
been held, but in response to the issue of advertisement, it was categorically stated by the appellant
that he cannot be held responsible as he is not aware of any advertisement having been made.
3. The appellant's service came to be terminated by the order dated 10th September, 2003 and an
appeal in respect thereof also failed. The appellant approached this Court by filing C.W.J.C.
No.12148 of 2003, which was dismissed on 02 nd March, 2005. Letters Patent Appeal No.291 of
2007 against the same was also dismissed on 27th February, 2008 by a Division Bench after having
referred to the judgment in the case of Patna High Court LPA No.569 of 2018 dt.08-02-2019
Hemkant Jha Vs. State of Bihar & Ors., reported in 2007(3) PLJR 657. The appellant approached
the Apex Court and his special leave to appeal was dismissed on 25th July, 2008 on merits,
observing that the appellant would be entitled to the benefit of the observation made for future
appointment in age bar relaxation keeping in view the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of
Nagendra Chandra & Ors. Vs. State of Jharkhand & Ors., reported in (2008) 1 SCC 798.
4. It appears that arising out of similar dismissals, certain other writ petitions had been filed,
including C.W.J.C. No. 5279 of 2005, decided on 18 th May, 2005, whereby the writ petition was
allowed on account of violation of principles of natural justice. The said judgment was accepted in
L.P.A. No. 945 of 2010 that had arisen out of C.W.J.C. No.204 of 2004. A Division Bench of this
Court on 5th January, 2012 approved the order passed in C.W.J.C. No.5279 of 2005.
5. The said judgments were taken notice of in C.W.J.C. No.3799 of 2006 that was decided along with
C.W.J.C. No.4097 of 2006 on 23rd of July, 2012. While allowing the aforesaid writ petition, the
learned single Judge of this Court came to the conclusion that violation of principles of natural
justice vitiated the impugned order and consequently, the orders Patna High Court LPA No.569 of
2018 dt.08-02-2019 were quashed with liberty to the respondents to proceed afresh. It is, therefore,
clear that the said judgment was delivered only on the premise that no opportunity had been given
to the petitioners therein to defend themselves.
6. However, while allowing the writ petition, even though the judgment of the learned single Judge
in the case of Sudhir Kumar Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors., reported in 2000(3) PLJR 717, was
noticed, yet no consideration thereof appears to have been made.
7. After the aforesaid two writ petitions were allowed, the petitioners therein approached the
respondents and an order was passed on 06th August, 2013 referring to the said judgment
reinstating both the petitioners with a rider that it will be open to the department to undertake fresh
proceeding against them. There is nothing on record to indicate as to whether any proceeding was
undertaken or have culminated in any further action in the matter or not, but the fact remains that
the writ petition had been allowed only on the ground of violation of principles of natural justice
without entering into the issue of the procedure of appointment as was discussed and deliberated

upon in the judgment in the case of Sudhir Kumar (supra). It may be mentioned that the judgment
of Sudhir Kumar (supra) Patna High Court LPA No.569 of 2018 dt.08-02-2019 was subjected to
challenge in L.P.A. No.1131 of 1999 that was dismissed by a Division Bench on 15.02.2000. The
judgment is extracted herein under:-
"Heard learned counsel for the appellant.
We are not persuaded to interfere in this appeal because we find that the appellant
was not even applicant for the post of Constable and his appointment was made de
hors the rules on the approval of the Director General of Police. The learned Judge in
the impugned judgment and order has carefully considered various provisions of law
and has found that the Director General of Police has no special power to
recommend/approve an appointment, that too of a person who was not even an
applicant. This appeal is dismissed."
8. In the background aforesaid, what we find is that with the dismissal of the special leave to appeal
of the appellant on 25th July, 2008, his claim stood foreclosed and even otherwise the claim made
on the basis of parity also does not appear to be available inasmuch as the judgments relied upon are
only in relation to the violation of principles of natural justice leaving it open to the department to
take appropriate proceedings in the matter. The said ratio would not be attracted on the facts of the
present case inasmuch as here the appellant had been given a show cause to which he gave a reply
whereafter his services were terminated. Consequently, the said Patna High Court LPA No.569 of
2018 dt.08-02-2019 judgments do not come to the aid of the appellant.
9. Apart from this, the judgment in the case of Sudhir Kumar (supra) appears to have laid down the
law correctly after going through the entire gamut of the provisions relating to selections and
appointments and the powers to be exercised by the police authorities while making appointments.
We find that the judgment has been referred to by the Apex Court in the case of State of Bihar & Ors.
vs. Chandreshwar Pathak, reported in (2014) 13 SCC 232, which finally clinches the issue. The
judgments running contrary to the said ratio, therefore, cannot be said to lay down the law correctly.
10. Consequently, for all the reasons aforesaid, we do not find any reason to extend any such benefit
on the ground of parity to the appellant on the facts of the present case. The appeal is, therefore,
consigned to records with the aforesaid observations.
