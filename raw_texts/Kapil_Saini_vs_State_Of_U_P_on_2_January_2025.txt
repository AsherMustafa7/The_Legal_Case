Hon'ble Ashutosh Srivastava,J.
Heard learned counsel for the applicant, Shri D.P.S. Chauhan, learned AGA for the
State-respondents and perused the record.
This bail application under Section 483 of Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 has been

evidence in case of release on bail. Learned counsel for the applicant submits that there is two days
delay in lodging the FIR. The applicant was not named in the FIR. After six days, in the confessional
statement of co-accused, name of applicant has surfaced on record. The general role has been
assigned to the applicant. Learned counsel for the applicant submits that co-accused Dushyant Saini
has already been enlarged on bail by co-ordinate Bench of this Court on 6.11.2024 in Criminal Misc.
Bail Application No. 37397 of 2024. Hence, bail has been prayed for.
Learned AGA has vehemently opposed the prayer for bail.
Considering all above facts and circumstances, the nature of accusations, severity of the punishment
in the case of conviction and nature of supporting evidence, reasonable apprehension of tampering
with the witness and prima facie case, but without commenting on merit of case, a case for bail is
made out.
Accordingly, the bail application is allowed.
Let the accused-applicant, Kapil Saini, involved in above mentioned case crime number be released
on bail, on his executing a personal bond and two reliable sureties each, in the like amount to the
satisfaction of the court concerned, subject to the following conditions:
1. The applicant will not tamper with the evidence.
2. The applicant will not indulge in any criminal activity.
3. The applicant will not pressurize/intimidate the prosecution witnesses and
co-operate in the trial.
4. The applicant will appear regularly on each and every date fixed by the trial court,
unless his personal appearance is exempted through counsel by the court concerned.
In the event of breach of any of the aforesaid conditions, the court below will be at liberty to proceed
to cancel his bail.
