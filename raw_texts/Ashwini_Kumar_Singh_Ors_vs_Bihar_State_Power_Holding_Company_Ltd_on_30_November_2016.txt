Ashwini Kumar Singh & Ors vs Bihar State Power Holding Company Ltd. & ... on 30 November, 2016
The present Letters Patent Appeal is directed against the order dated 30th June, 2016 passed in
C.W.J.C.No. 7013 of 2016 whereby the writ application seeking quashing of the Notice of the
Departmental Examination 2016 whereby "Proficiency-in-Accounts' Patna High Court LPA No.1640
of 2016 dt.30-11-2016 2 Examination (Lekha Pravin Pariksha) Part I and Part II Examination (for
short the "Departmental Examination") was not set aside.
The appellants are the Accounts Assistants working with the respondent Board. On 16th March,
1962 the Board introduced "Proficiency-in-Accounts" examination. Each candidate was given three
chances in respect of each part of the examination. The relevant condition from the circular of the
Board mentions as follows:
"The present tentative policy for filling up vacancies in the cadre of
Accountants/Senior Auditors has generally been one of promotion on a provisional
basis from the existing Accounts Assistant/Bill intendments/Auditors on fulfillment
of the criteria of seniority cum good Confidential Reports. In view of the pressing
need for manning these posts by persons with suitable capacity and professional
ledge, it has been decided to introduce a system of examination called the (L.P.P.) for
the purpose of filling up the vacancies of Accountants and above. No Accounts
Assistant (or other equivalent category will be considered for further advancement or
promotion, unless they have passed parts of this qualifying Examination. For details
please see the appendix to this order.
2. This examination will be in two part viz., part I and part II, as per syllabus in the Appendix to
Standing Order. Only those who have passed part I, will be permitted to appear in Part II of the
Examination.
Patna High Court LPA No.1640 of 2016 dt.30-11-2016 3
6. The number of chances that an individual will be given in respect of each part of the examination
be three." The appellants contend that such decision was modified when Standing Order
No.23/DEX-2501/07/869 issued on 7th October, 2009 and the chances of passing the
Departmental examination was increased to five but was made sequential. The relevant clause from
such circular reads as under:
"8. For passing the aforesaid departmental examination maximum of five consecutive
chances will be allowed. This will not be applicable in case of lower division
confirmatory examination. Consecutive chance means conduction of examinations. If
a candidate fails to appear in any of the conducted examination, he will be deemed to
have appeared for the proposer of calculating maximum five consecutive chances."
Departmental Examination was not mentioned in the above circular which examination was
introduced by another circular dated 4th of October, 2010 (Annexure-3). The appellants have
appeared in such examination after availing three chances but before availing five chances. It is only
at this stage on declaration of the result, the Board found that the appellants have availed more than

Ashwini Kumar Singh & Ors vs Bihar State Power Holding Company Ltd. & ... on 30 November, 2016
three chances, therefore, in terms of circular of 16th of March, 1962 Patna High Court LPA No.1640
of 2016 dt.30-11-2016 4 the appellants are not eligible for promotion on the basis of the
Departmental Examination.
The argument of the respondent Board is that Annexure- 2, the Circular no. 862 of 7th October,
2009 deals with the revision of the syllabus of the various examinations including Departmental
Examination vide communication dated 4th October, 2010 but does not deal with the number of
attempts in such examination. Such is the stand communicated by the Managing Director of the
respondent Board on 10th May, of 2016 as well.
We have heard learned counsel for the parties and find that the order of the learned Single Bench
holding that the Circular no. 862 dated 7th of October, 2009 is not applicable to the Departmental
Examination in question cannot be sustained. The reading of the extract from the Circular shows
that it was issued not only to revise the syllabus but also the Rules and Regulations for conducting
various examinations. Though initially, Departmental Examination was not part of the Circular but
such examinations was included vide communication dated 4th of October, 2010. Therefore, not
only syllabus of Departmental Examination stands revised but also the number of attempts stands
increased to five in terms of Clause 8 of the circular dated 7th October 2009. Clause 8 of the Circular
deals with "aforesaid departmental examination" that examination includes the Patna High Court
LPA No.1640 of 2016 dt.30-11-2016 5 Departmental Examination, therefore, it cannot be said that
the Circular of 16th of March, 1962 will continue to be applicable for the Departmental Examination
and that the Circular dated 7th of October, 2009 is not applicable as it is applicable in respect of
syllabus and not in respect of examination. Consequently we find that the order passed by the
learned Single Bench is not sustainable, the same is set aside.
The Letters Patent Appeal is, thus, allowed. The respondents shall take consequential steps in
accordance with law expeditiously.
