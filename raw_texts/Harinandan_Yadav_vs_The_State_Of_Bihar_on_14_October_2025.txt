(iii) For issuance of writ in the nature of Mandamus directing the respondents that stay the
functioning of the above mentioned allocation of PDS Shop forthwith.
(iv.) For grant of any other relief or reliefs which the petitioner may be found entitled by this
Hon'ble Court."
2. At this juncture, the Learned counsel for the respondents contended that Section 32(iii) of the
Bihar Targeted Public Distribution System (Control) Patna High Court CWJC No.12379 of 2019
dt.14-10-2025 Order, 2016 provides for the provision of appeal and Section 32(vi) of the Bihar
Targeted Public Distribution System (Control) Order, 2016 provides for the provision of revision.
Section 32(iii) 32(v) and 32(vi) read as follows:
"32 (iii). Any person aggrieved by an order of the licensing authority denying the
issue or renewal of the license to the fair price shop owner or cancellation of the
license may appeal to the District Officer within thirty days of the date of receipt of
the order and the District Magistrate shall, as far as practicable, dispose the appeal
within a period of sixty days."
32. (v) Till the disposal of appeal pending, the Appellate Authority may direct that the order under
appeal shall not take effect for such period as the authority may consider necessary for giving a
reasonable opportunity to the other party under sub-clause (4) or until the appeal is disposed of,
whichever is earlier.
(vi) Due to non disposal of the appeal within sixty days by the District Officer or against the order
passed in the appeal, a revision may be filed before the Patna High Court CWJC No.12379 of 2019
dt.14-10-2025 Divisional Commissioner. The revision shall be disposed of within two months.
3. Admittedly, from the reliefs prayed for in the writ petition, it is evident that the petitioner has an
alternative remedy under the provisions of Bihar Targeted Public Distribution System (Control)
Order, 2016.
4. The remedy available under the Act is to prefer an appeal before the District Magistrate. As the
District Magistrate is the head of the Selection Committee he cannot review his orders in an appeal.
Therefore, the petitioner is directed to file a complaint/application before the Divisional
Commissioner.
5. The Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that he intends to file a complaint/application
before the concerned authority, but the limitation period for filing the Patna High Court CWJC
No.12379 of 2019 dt.14-10-2025 same has lapsed. He prayed for a direction to the concerned
authority to entertain the same in accordance with Section 5 of the Limitation Act.
6. Taking into consideration that the petitioner has an alternative remedy for filing
complaint/application, the writ petition is disposed of with a direction to the petitioner to file
complaint/application within one month from the date of receipt of this order before the concerned

authority. The delay in filing the complaint/application shall be condoned by the authority
concerned, and the authority shall dispose of the same within three months from the date of filing of
the same. It is needless to mention that before passing any order the petitioner should be given a fair
opportunity for hearing.
7. With the above said observation, the Writ petition is disposed of.
Patna High Court CWJC No.12379 of 2019 dt.14-10-2025
8. Interlocutory Application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
