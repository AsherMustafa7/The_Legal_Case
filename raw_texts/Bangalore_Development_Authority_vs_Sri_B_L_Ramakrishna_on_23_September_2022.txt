THESE MATTERS HAVING BEEN HEARD AND RESERVED FOR
JUDGMENT, COMING ON FOR PRONOUNCEMENT OF JUDGMENT
THIS DAY, B. VEERAPPA J., DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING:
15
JUDGMENT
These intra court appeals are filed by the Bangalore Development Authority (for short, hereinafter
referred to 'BDA') against the orders passed by the learned Single Judge of this Court allowing the
writ petitions in terms of the decisions of this Court in the cases of Jayakumar Shetty, Kempamma,
Mohan Kumar and Manjunath R., in similar circumstances and in identical writ petitions i.e., writ
petition Nos.13568/2015, 19093/2012, 38258/2013 and 5150/2019, quashing the Cancellation
Orders and Endorsements issued by the BDA on respective dates and granting four weeks' time to
the respective petitioners to pay the entire sital value together with interest at 21% per annum to the
BDA and on making such payment, the BDA was directed to take necessary steps to allot the subject
site or an alternative site in favour of the petitioners within a period of three months from the date
of such payment.
I. FACTS OF THE CASE Writ Appeal No.49/2022 arising out of the order dated 8.12.2020 passed
by the learned Single Judge in Writ Petition No.14291/2020:
2. It is the case of the original petitioner - Smt. Nirmala Bai N., that her husband late
V. Sathyanarayana Rao belonging to General Catergory, had applied to the BDA for
allotment of the site measuring 30 x 40 sq. ft., and the BDA allotted a site bearing
No.883 in Gnanabharathi Layout Block, Block-2 (Nagadevanahalli), Bangalore vide
allotment letter dated 26.12.2000. As per the allotment letter, the total cost of the site
was Rs.1,77,250/- and after deducting the initial payment of Rs.22,200/-, remaining
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190080663/ 12
Bangalore Development Authority vs Sri B L Ramakrishna on 23 September, 2022
balance amount of Rs.1,55,350/- was required to be deposited within the time
stipulated, but due to financial difficulty, her husband could not deposit the said
amount within time. Thereby, her husband submitted a representation to the BDA
requesting to grant some more time to deposit the balance sital value. However, the
BDA without issuing any notice and without giving an opportunity to pay either by
her or her husband, issued a Cancellation Order dated 30.9.2004 for non-payment of
amount within the time stipulated which was contrary to the BDA Allotment Rules.
Thereafter, the petitioner-her husband approached the BDA with a request to cancel
the cancellation order as the aforesaid balance amount was deposited by him and to
execute the Sale Deed in respect of the site allotted, in view of the Circulars issued by
the BDA in the year 2007 and 2010, to accept the balance sital value with 21%
interest from the allottees of the small sites measuring 20 x 30 feet and 30 x 40 feet,
who have not deposited the sital value within time stipulated as per Annexures-D and
E to the writ petition and to execute the Sale Deed. Thereafter, the matter was placed
before the Commissioner of BDA for taking necessary decision and the Law Officer of
the BDA had opined to accept the sital value with 21% interest in respect of the site
allotted. Inspite of the repeated representations made, the BDA has not considered
the same. In view of the fact that with regard to similarly placed persons, who had
approached the Court by filing writ petitions, this Court had granted relief as sought
for, the petitioner also filed writ petition seeking quashing of the Cancellation Order
dated 30.9.2004 and direction to the respondents-BDA to consider his
representation dated 16.3.2016 and 20.1.2020 and accept the balance sital value with
21% interest per annum from the date of allotment in terms of the Circulars issued by
the BDA and the order passed by this Court.
3. The learned Single Judge, after hearing both the parties, by the order dated 8th
December, 2020 allowed the writ petition and quashed the Cancellation Order and
the endorsement in view of the earlier orders passed by this Court; granted four
weeks' time to the petitioner to pay the balance sital value together with 21% interest
per annum to the BDA and on such payment, the BDA was directed to take necessary
steps to allot the subject site or an alternative site in favour of the petitioner within a
period of three months from the date of such payment. Hence, the present writ
appeal is filed by the BDA.
Writ Appeal No.518/2016 arising out of the order dated 25.11.2015 passed by the
learned Single Judge in Writ Petition
4. It is the case of the original petitioner - B.L. Ramakrishna before the learned Single
Judge that he is a registered applicant for allotment of site in the BDA vide
Registration No.2406 dated 9.10.1984. He had made more than 7 attempts for
allotment of site measuring 40 x 60 sq. ft., since the year 1987 till 2000 and
ultimately on 7.7.2001, the BDA issued an allotment letter allotting a site bearing
No.63, Block-V, Anjanapura, measuring 12 x 18 meters. Thereafter, he approached
the BDA seeking extension of time for payment of balance sital value and accordingly,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190080663/ 13
Bangalore Development Authority vs Sri B L Ramakrishna on 23 September, 2022
the BDA granted time till 14.10.2001 by issuing an Endorsement, dated 20.8.2001. At
the time of allotment, the petitioner was residing at No.759, 5th 'A' Cross, 2nd Block,
Banashankari 1st Stage, Bangalore-560050. Therefore, he submitted a letter dated
25.10.2002 intimating the BDA about the change of his address and requested for
further extension of time for payment of the balance sital value of Rs.3,01,450/-. On
subsequent enquiries with the BDA, he came to know that BDA had taken up
proceedings for cancellation of the site for non-payment of the sital value by issuance
of show cause notice to the old address and to that effect, an order dated 23.4.2002
was also passed.
Thereafter, he submitted a representation dated 2.4.2012 requesting to take a lenient view in the
matter by bringing notice to the Authority the bonafide reasons for non-payment of the sital value
due to ill health of his mother and death of his brother. On continuous request to the BDA for
acceptance of sital value and for retaining the allotment made to him after seven attempts, the same
did not yield. He again made a representation on 5.6.2014 explaining in detail the circumstances in
which he could not pay the sital amount. Since the petitioner, who had waited for 31 years for
allotment and after seven attempts, a site was allotted in his favour which came to be cancelled for
non-payment of the balance sital value within time, he approached this Court by filing a writ
petition to quash the Cancellation Order dated 23.4.2002 and to issue a writ of mandamus directing
the BDA to accept the balance sital value of Rs.3,01,450/- along with appropriate interest and
execute Conveyance Deed in his favour contending that the BDA had issued a Circular dated
18.11.2010 for taking a lenient view regarding delayed payment.
5. The learned Single Judge after hearing both the parties, by the order dated 15th November, 2015
disposed of the writ petitions and directed the petitioner to pay the balance sital consideration with
interest at 24% per annum from the date of allotment till the date of deposit. On payment of such
penalty for the delay in payment of the balance sital value and also keeping in view the fact that the
site in question was available for allotment to the petitioner, the BDA were directed to execute a
Lease-cum-Sale Agreement in favour of the petitioner without reference to the Order of Cancellation
dated 24.4.2002. Accordingly, three months' time was granted to the petitioner to deposit the
balance sital value with interest at 24% per annum. It was also held that in case if the petitioner did
not deposit the aforesaid amount in time, the Order of Cancellation would stand and becomes
operational and till such time, it would remain in abeyance. It was further directed that on receipt of
the said amount within two months from the date of deposit of the balance sital value with interest,
the BDA to execute Lease-cum-Sale Deed in favour of the petitioner without reference to the Order
of Cancellation. Thereby the present writ appeal is filed by the BDA.
Writ Appeal No.111/2020 arising out of the order dated 7.2.2019 passed by the learned Single Judge
in Writ Petition No.2000/2017
6. The original petitioner belonging to scheduled caste had applied for allotment of site measuring
20 x 30 sq. ft. and accordingly, on 12.4.2000, the BDA allotted a site bearing No.126, measuring 20
x 30 situated at Gnanabharathi Layout, Valagerehalli, Block-I in his favour. As per the rules, he had
to deposit the sital value within three years from the date of communication of allotment letter. Due
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190080663/ 14
Bangalore Development Authority vs Sri B L Ramakrishna on 23 September, 2022
to ill-health and financial difficulty, he could not deposit the amount in time. After mobilizing the
amount, on 16.10.2003, he had deposited the entire site value of Rs.33,490/- through D.D. and
requested the BDA to accept the same and execute the Sale Deed in respect of the site allotted. The
BDA having received the entire sital value from him, has issued the cancellation order to cancel the
site allotted on the ground of non- payment of sital value within the time stipulated on 13.10.2004.
Thereafter on 18.11.2015, the BDA issued a Circular to accept the balance sital value from the
allottees, who have not deposited the amount in time by accepting 21% interest per annum.
Accordingly, on 30.12.2010, the petitioner made representation to the BDA to accept the sital value
with interest at 21% per annum and execute the Sale Deed for the site allotted. The said
representation was not considered. Thereby, the petitioner filed Writ Petition No.2672/2015 before
this Court and this Court, allowed the writ petition on 18.12.2015 and directed the BDA to consider
the representation of the petitioner, without being influenced by the cancellation order, within a
period of four months from the date of the order. Since the case of the petitioner was not considered
by the BDA, he filed a contempt petition i.e., CCC No. 694/2016. In the said contempt petition, the
BDA issued an endorsement stating that the request of the petitioner's is rejected on the ground that
he had not deposited the sital value on or before 31.12.2010 as per the Circular dated 18.11.2015
issued by the BDA. He further contended that in identical cases and in similar circumstances, this
Court had directed the BDA to consider and accept the entire sital value with 21% interest per
annum and execute the Sale Deed in favour of the allottees. Therefore, the petitioner made one more
representation but the same was not considered. Thereby, he filed a writ petition to quash the
Cancellation Order dated 30.10.2004 and the Endorsement dated 22.10.2016 and issue a writ of
mandamus directing the BDA to consider his representations dated 10.12.2010, 6.8.2012 and
2.4.2014 to accept the balance sital value with 21% interest per annum and to execute the Sale Deed
in terms of the Circular issued by the BDA.
7. After hearing both parties, the learned Single Judge by the impugned order dated 7th February,
2019 disposed of the writ petition on the statement made by the BDA that a particular site has
already been allotted which the petitioner has to see, so that, further steps would be taken for
allotment of the same, subject to legally admissible terms. Based on the said statement and
recording the statement made by the BDA, two months time was granted for allotment of site and
registration of conveyance. Aggrieved by the said order, the BDA filed Review Petition No.303/2019
which came to be dismissed on 24th October, 2019. Hence, the present writ appeal is filed by the
BDA. Writ Appeal No.618/2021 arising out of the order dated 23.12.2020 passed by the learned
Single Judge of this Court in
8. It is the case of the original petitioner - Smt. H. Vimalabai that she belongs to Scheduled Caste
and her husband Sri M.K. Omprakash had filed an application for allotment of site measuring 15 x
24 sq. mts., on 19.10.2001. Considering his application, the husband of the petitioner was allotted
site bearing No 182, situated at 7th Block, Banashankari, 6th Stage, Bengaluru and allotment letter
was issued on 13.3.2002. As per the allotment letter, the total cost of the site was Rs.5,46,300/- and
at the time of filing the application, the petitioner had paid the initial deposit of Rs.28,600/-. After
receiving the allotment letter, petitioner's husband paid a sum of Rs.30,000/- on 19.5.2002, a copy
of the remittance challenged is produced as per Annexure-D to the writ petition. Due to his ill

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190080663/ 15
Bangalore Development Authority vs Sri B L Ramakrishna on 23 September, 2022
BDA issued a show cause notice calling upon him to pay the balance sale consideration, to which he
filed an application seeking extension of time to pay the balance sale consideration. Without
considering his application, the BDA issued Cancellation Order on 15.11.2002, cancelling the
allotment and her husband died on 14.4.2003 as per the death certificate Annexure-F to the writ
petition. Thereafter, the petitioner made representation for transfer of the above said allotted site in
her favour and permit her to pay the remaining balance sale consideration. Without considering the
said representation, BDA issued an endorsement dated 25.4.2019 stating that already Cancellation
Order has been issued for non- payment of sital value and hence there is no ground to consider her
request again. She further stated that in similar circumstances one Sri Puttu Rao was allotted a site
bearing No.219 measuring 15 x 24 sq. mts., at Arkavathi, 5th Block. He died due to his ill health after
allotment was made and due to financial difficulties, he could not pay the balance sale
consideration. As such, his wife Smt. P. Nirmala filed an application for transfer of the above
allotted site in her favour and she was permitted to pay the balance sale consideration and the said
site was allotted in her favour. A copy of the office proceedings, possession certificate and
Lease-cum-Sale Agreement executed in her favour were produced as Annexures-J, K and L
respectively to the writ petition.
9. The petitioner further submitted that even after receiving an endorsement, she also made one
more representation on 8.9.2019 requesting the BDA to revoke the Cancellation Order and permit
her to pay the balance sale consideration with interest at the rate of 21% per annum for the belated
period as she could not pay the balance sale consideration within the stipulated period as her
husband had died before paying the entire sital value. Since BDA did not take any action, she
approached this Court by filing writ petition to quash the endorsement dated 25.4.2019 and the
Cancellation Order dated 15.11.2002 and writ of mandamus directing the BDA to consider her
representation dated 8.3.2019.
10. The learned Single Judge after hearing both the parties, by the order dated 23rd December,
2020 relying upon the order passed in similar circumstances in the case of Sri Jayakumar Shetty,
Kempamma, Mohan Kumar and Manjunath R. , allowed the writ petition and quashed the
Cancellation Order and the endorsement; granted four weeks' time to the petitioner to pay balance
sital value together with interest 21% per annum to the BDA and upon such balance payment, the
BDA was directed to take necessary steps to allot the subject site or an alternative site in favour of
the petitioner within a period of three months from the date of such payment. Hence, the present
writ appeal is filed by the BDA.
Writ Appeal No.874/2021 arising out of the order dated 26.11.2020 passed by the learned Single
Judge of this Court in
11. It is the case of the original petitioner - Smt. S. Thara that BDA allotted a site measuring 20 x 30
sq. ft., in her favour under the category of Economically Weaker Section. As the allotment letter was
not communicated to her, she could not deposit the amount within the time stipulated. The BDA
without communicating the allotment letter, issued cancellation order within three years from the
date of allotment which is contrary to the BDA Allotment of Site Rules, 1984 and the said
cancellation order was passed by the respondent without issuing show cause notice and without
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190080663/ 16
Bangalore Development Authority vs Sri B L Ramakrishna on 23 September, 2022
giving an opportunity for the petitioner to deposit the amount.
12. It was further contended that the BDA had taken a decision in Subject No.213/2004 providing
an opportunity for the allottees, who have not received the allotment letter for payment of sital
value. On the basis of the said decision, she gave representations on 19.4.2017 and 22.5.2017. Since
BDA did not take any action, she approached this Court by filing writ petition to quash the
endorsement dated 18.12.2014 and the Cancellation Order dated 16.5.2000 and issue a writ of
mandamus directing the BDA to consider her representations dated 19.4.2017 and 22.5.2017.
13. The learned Single Judge after hearing both the parties, by the order dated 26th November,

Cancellation Order dated 16.5.2000 and the Endorsement dated 18.12.2014 issued by the BDA;
granted four weeks' time to the petitioner to pay balance sital value together with 21% interest per
annum to the BDA and upon such balance payment, the BDA was directed to take necessary steps to

from the date of such payment. Hence, the present writ appeal is filed by the BDA. Writ Appeal
No.899/2021 arising out of the order dated 19.11.2020 passed by the learned Single Judge of this
Court in
14. It is the case of the original petitioner that she filed an application for allotment of a site
measuring 30 x 40 sq. ft. under General Category. After number of attempts, the BDA allotted the
site bearing No.64, measuring 30 x 40 sq. ft., situated at Block-8, Banashankari 6th Stage as per the
allotment letter dated 13.3.2002 issued by the BDA for the total value of Rs.1,71,700/-. After
deducting the initial deposit amount of Rs.21,500/-, the petitioner was required to pay the balance
sital value of Rs.1,50,500/- within the stipulated time. After allotment of the site, the petitioner
incurred huge medical expenses towards his mother as she was suffering from cancer. After
prolonged illness, she died on 10.6.2002. Hence, he could not deposit the balance sital value within
the stipulated time. Annexures-B and C are the discharge summary and death certificate produced
in the writ petition. After his mother's death, the petitioner gave a representation before the BDA
stating that due to his mother's death, he could not deposit the balance sital value within time
stipulated and was ready to deposit the balance sital value and to accept the same by executing the
Sale Deed in respect of the site allotted. The respondent without issuing any notice to him, by its
order dated 23.4.2003 cancelled the allotment of site in his favour for non-payment of balance sital
value in time. After mobilizing the amount, the petitioner deposited the entire sital value of
Rs.1,50,500/- through Demand Draft bearing No.338353 dated 20.1.2004 drawn on Indian
Overseas Bank, J.P.Nagar Branch, Bengaluru, in favour of the BDA. Along with the demand draft,
the petitioner also addressed a letter dated 20.1.2004 requesting the BDA to accept the same and to
execute the Sale Deed in respect of the site allotted and along with that, he had also furnished a copy
of the discharge summary and death certificate of his mother. Having accepted the D.D., the BDA
failed to execute the Sale Deed of the site in his favour. As such, he filed one more representation
dated 4.1.2007 requesting to accept the balance site value and to execute the Sale Deed in respect of
the site allotted.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190080663/ 17
Bangalore Development Authority vs Sri B L Ramakrishna on 23 September, 2022
15. It was submitted by the petitioner that in the year 2007 and 2010, the BDA had issued Circulars
dated 18.10.2007 and 18.11.2010 stating the allottess of small site measuring 20 x 30 and 30 x 40
who have not deposited the balance sital value within the time stipulated, have been extended an
opportunity for payment of balance sital value with 21% interest per annum. Based on the said
Circulars, the petitioner made one more representation with a request to accept the balance sital
value with 21% interest per annum and to execute the Sale Deed in respect of the site allotted, but
the same was not considered. He further stated that in similar circumstances, the BDA had accepted
the balance sital value with 21% interest per annum from the allottees, who had not deposited the
balance sale value in time. Since BDA did not take any action, he approached this Court by filing
writ petition to quash the Cancellation Order dated 23.4.2003 and writ of mandamus directing the
BDA to consider his representations.
16. The learned Single Judge after hearing both the parties, by the order dated 19th November, 2020
relying upon the order passed in similar circumstances in the case of Sri Jayakumar Shetty,
Kempamma, Mohan Kumar and Manjunath R. , allowed the writ petition and quashed the
Cancellation Order dated 23.4.2003 and directed the BDA to consider and pass appropriate orders
and execute necessary documents pursuant to the representations made by the petitioner in
accordance with law in the light of the observations made in the order within a period of three
months from the date of receipt of a copy of that order. Hence, the present writ appeal is filed by the
BDA.
Writ Appeal No. 924/2021 arising out of the order dated 8.12.2020 passed by the learned Single
Judge of this Court in Writ
17. The petitioner filed an application for allotment of site measuring 30 x 40 sq. ft., to the BDA and
had been filing applications from 1982 to 1987 and after having completed 8 attempts, the BDA
allotted a site bearing No.1275 situated at Nagarabhavi, 2nd Stage, 9th Block, Bengaluru measuring
30 x 40 sq. ft., by issuing an allotment letter dated 15.3.1990. After receiving the allotment letter,
when the petitioner went to the spot to verify the allotted site, he came to know that the above
allotted site was not suitable to construct house as it was in ditch and was adjacent to gutter. The
dimension of the site is less than 30 x 40 feet. Hence, he made representation to the BDA to verify
the above allotted site. The Assistant Executive Engineer conducted the survey and submitted a
report stating that the sites bearing Nos.1274-1275 and 1276 are situated in low lying area and were
not suitable to construct house and for residence. The dimensions of those sites were less than 30 x
40 sq. ft. and therefore, those sites could be converted into 20 x 30 sq. ft. and a copy of the report
issued by the Assistant Executive Engineer was produced as Annexure-C. Due to the abovesaid
reasons, the petitioner could not pay the balance amount within the stipulated period. This fact was
brought to the notice of the BDA by the petitioner requesting to allot alternative site. No action was
taken by the authorities. Hence, he paid the entire sital value of Rs.21,825/- on 3.2.1995 under
protest. After receiving the entire sital value, the BDA issued Cancellation Order on 29.11.1996 for
termination of the above allotted site on the ground that he had not paid the sital amount within a
stipulated period, but has paid after the lapse of six years. Therefore, he made representation on
22.2.2003 stating that he had been regularly submitting applications as and when called for and on
repeated visits, he was told that the above site has been allotted to two persons and he has to wait
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190080663/ 18
Bangalore Development Authority vs Sri B L Ramakrishna on 23 September, 2022
for some time to know the actual allotment. He was asked to remit the sital amount and accordingly,
he remitted Rs.21,085/- through Demand Draft No.25744 on 3.2.1995 and requested to look into
the matter at the earliest by the representation dated 22.2.2003. Since the BDA has not taken any
action, he made one more representation on 28.4.2003. It was the contention of the petitioner that
since he is aged about 80 years and still he does not have any site or house in Bengaluru, he
requested the BDA to allot an alternative site considering his age and attempts made by him. He had
also agreed to pay interest at the rate of 21% on the sital value for the belated period. It was the
contention of the petitioner that there is a delay in filing the writ petition as he is a Government
employee and was being transferred from one place to another, he could not file the writ petition in
time. In the writ petition he sought to quash the cancellation order dated 29.11.1996 and for a writ of
mandamus directing the BDA to consider his representation dated 28.4.2003 and allot an
alternative site by issuing allotment letter and to execute the absolute Sale Deed by receiving the
interest at 21% for the belated period.
18. The learned Single Judge after hearing both the parties, by the impugned order dated 8th
December, 2020 relying upon the order passed in similar circumstances in the case of Sri
Jayakumar Shetty, Kempamma, Mohan Kumar and Manjunath R., allowed the writ petition and
quashed the Cancellation Order dated 29.11.1996 and the endorsement dated 30.6.2003; granted
four weeks' time to the petitioner to pay balance sital value together with interest 21% per annum to
the BDA and upon such balance payment, the BDA was directed to take necessary steps to allot the
subject site or an alternative site in favour of the petitioner within a period of three months from the
date of such payment. Hence, the present writ appeal is filed by the BDA.
Writ Appeal No.956/2021 arising out of the order dated 6.11.2020 passed by the learned Single
Judge of this Court in Writ
19. It is the case of the original petitioner that she filed an application for allotment of a site
measuring 30 x 40 ft. under Backward Community. Considering her application, the BDA allotted
the site bearing No.330 measuring 30 x 40 sq. ft. at Banashankari Layout, 6th Stage, 9th Block,
Bangalore after six attempts and issued an allotment letter dated 13.3.2002 specifying that the
balance amount is required to be paid within three years from the date of receipt of allotment letter.
After receiving allotment letter, when the petitioner went to the spot to verify the site, she came to
know that it was not suitable for residence as there was a stream. Hence, she immediately gave a
representation to the BDA on 26.4.2002 requesting for allotment of alternative site. Instead of
taking action on the representation made by the petitioner, the BDA straightaway issued show cause
notice on 22.8.2002 as to why allotment of site should not be cancelled on the ground that she had
not paid the balance amount within the stipulated period. In turn, the petitioner gave a reply to the
said show cause notice stating that without considering objection and without giving an opportunity
of being heard, allotment of site cannot be cancelled as the same is in violation of Articles 14 and 21
of the Constitution of India. It was further contended that in identical circumstances with respect to
similarly placed persons, this Court had allowed the writ petition Nos.13568/2015, 19093/2012,
38258/2013 and 5150/2019. Therefore, Writ Petition No.22681/2015 was filed seeking to quash the
Cancellation Order dated 29.1.2003 and a writ of mandamus directing the BDA to consider his
representation dated 25.4.2013 and allot an alternative site by issuing allotment letter.

November, 2020 relying upon the order passed in similar circumstances in the case of Sri
Jayakumar Shetty, Kempamma, Mohan Kumar and Manjunath R., allowed the writ petition and
quashed the Cancellation Order dated 29.1.2003; granted four weeks' time to the petitioner to pay
balance sital value together with 21% interest per annum to the BDA and upon such balance
payment, the BDA was directed to take necessary steps to allot the subject site or an alternative site
in favour of the petitioner within a period of three months from the date of such payment. Hence,
the present writ appeal is filed by the BDA. Writ Appeal No.985/2021 arising out of the order dated
21.12.2020 passed by the learned Single Judge of this Court in
21. It is the case of the original petitioner that he filed an application before the Commissioner, BDA
for allotment of 20 x 30 site under Scheduled Caste category. Accordingly, the BDA issued an
allotment letter dated: 10-04-2000 allotting the site bearing No. 128, measuring 20 x 30, situated at
Gnanabharathi Layout, Valagerahalli, Block-2, Bangalore under SC category in his favour. The total
cost of the site was Rs.33,600/- and after deducting the initial deposit amount and clearance
charges, he was required to deposit balance amount of Rs.33,490/ within the stipulated time. As per
the BDA Allotment of Site Rules, 1984, if an allottee belongs to SC/ST category, he has to deposit
balance sital value within 3 years from the date of communication of the allotment letter. The
petitioner could not deposit the balance sital value within 3 years, due to financial difficulty and
medical expenses incurred as his mother was suffering from ill-health. After mobilizing the amount,
he deposited the entire balance sital value of Rs.33,490/- through Demand Draft No. 134427, dated
18-10-2003 drawn in favour of the BDA along with the representation requesting to accept the same
and to execute the Sale Deed in respect of the site allotted. Since the respondent failed to consider
his two representations for allotment of site, the petitioner once again made a representation dated
12-10-2004. But the BDA after receiving the demand draft filed by him, by the order dated
12.10.2004 cancelled the site allotted in his favour for non payment of amount in time, without
giving notice and without hearing him and as such, the same is contrary to the BDA rules.
22. It is the further case of the petitioner that, in the year 2007 and 2010, the BDA had issued a
circular to accept the balance sital value with 21% interest from the allottees, who have been allotted
a small site measuring 20 x 30 Sq. ft. and 30 x 40 sq. ft. and have not deposited the sital value
within the stipulated time. But in terms of the Circulars, dated: 18-10-2007 and 18-11-2010 issued
by the BDA, the petitioner gave a representation dated: 13- 09.2017 with a request to accept the
balance sital value with 21% interest and to execute the Sale Deed in respect of the site allotted or in
alternative, if the site is not available, to allot an alternative site in his favour which was not
considered by the BDA.
23. It is the further case of the petitioner that in identical circumstances with regard to similarly
placed persons, this Court had allowed the writ petition Nos.13568/2015, 19093/2012, 38258/ 2013
and 5150/2019. Therefore, Writ Petition No.15169/2020 was filed seeking to quash the Cancellation
Order dated 12.10.2004 and a writ of mandamus directing the BDA to consider his representations
dated 12.10.2004 and 13.9.2017 to accept the balance sital value with 21% interest from the date of
allotment as per the Circulars, dated 18.10.2007 and 18.11.2010 issued by the BDA and allot an
alternative site by issuing allotment letter.

time for depositing the amount. However, the respondent without issuing notice and without
hearing him passed a Cancellation Order, dated 8-10-2004 cancelling the site allotted in his favour
for non-payment of amount in time which is contrary to BDA Allotment Site Rules, 1984. After
cancellation, the petitioner repeatedly approached the respondent with a request to reconsider the
cancellation order and to accept the amount deposited by him and to execute Sale Deed in respect of
the site allotted. It is further submitted that, in the year 2007 and 2010 the BDA issued a Circulars,
dated 18-10-2007 and 18-11-2010 to accept the balance sital value with 21% interest from the

deposited the sital value within the stipulated time. As such, he filed a representation with a request
to accept the balance sital value with 21% interest and to execute the Sale Deed in respect of the site
allotted. Thereafter, the matter has been placed before the Law Officer for legal opinion. The Law
Officer opined that the site allotted in favour of the person belongs to Backward Tribe and in an
identical cases, the authority accepted 21% interest per annum from the allottees and executed sale
deed, the same principle is also applicable to the allottees in this case also and hence, the request of
the petitioner can be considered for allotment of site by accepting 21% interest. In the
circumstances, he once again made representations, dated 28-02 2016 and 05-06-2016 with a
request to accept the balance sital value with 21% interest per annum and to execute sale deed in
respect of the site allotted.
27. It is the further case of the petitioner that in identical circumstances with regard to similarly
placed persons, this Court had allowed the writ petition Nos.13568/2015, 19093/2012, 38258/2013

placed persons, this Court had allowed the writ petition Nos.13568/2015, 19093/2012, 38258/2013

Judge in Writ Petition
49. It is the case of the petitioner that he had applied for allotment of a site measuring 20 x 30 sq.ft.,

Bangalore Development Authority vs Sri B L Ramakrishna on 23 September, 2022
53. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties. II. ARGUMENTS ADVANCED BY THE
LEARNED COUNSEL FOR THE APPELLANT-BENGALURU DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY
54. Sri K.G.Raghavan, learned Senior Counsel along with Sri B.Vachan, learned counsel for the
Bengaluru Development Authority contended that Rule 13 of the Bengaluru Development Authority
(Allotment of Sites) Rules, 1982, does not make any difference in allotment, on the basis of
dimension of sites. He further contended that the directions of the Government/proceedings dated
23.07.2007 applies only to sites with dimensions of 20 ft. x 30 ft. and 30 ft. x 40 ft. In obedience to
the proceedings of the Government, the Bengaluru Development Authority issued Circulars dated
18.10.2007 and 18.11.2010 providing for payment of balance amount beyond the stipulated time
under Rule 13 stated supra. The relief sought for by the writ petitioners is against the Circulars dated
18.10.2007 and 18.11.2010 issued by the Bengaluru Development Authority. Therefore, writ of
mandamus sought was not maintainable.
55. Learned Senior Counsel further contended that an identical issue is pending before the Hon'ble
Apex Court. Having regard to the language of Rule 13, there cannot be any allotment and allotment
if any, is in violation of mandatory Rules. Thereby, the very impugned Orders passed by the learned
single Judge quashing the cancellation of allotment and permitting the petitioners to pay the
balance sital value with 21% interest within four weeks and directing the Bengaluru Development
Authority to accept the same and allot the site or alternative site is erroneous and contrary to the
provisions of the Bengaluru Development Authority(Allotment of Sites) Rules, 1982. Thereby, the
impugned Order cannot be sustained.
56. Learned Senior Counsel further contended that the Government Circulars lost sanctity in the eye
of law, in view of the provisions of Section 65 of the Bengaluru Development Authority Act. The
Resolutions of the Bengaluru Development Authority dated 03.09.2007 and 29.04.2010 relied upon
by the petitioners are not applicable to the case of the petitioners. He further contended that
Circular dated 18.10.2007 issued by the Bengaluru Development Authority applies only to the sites
with dimensions 30 ft. x 40 ft and 20 ft. x 30 ft. and resolution is applicable only to portion of the
value of site, apart from the initial deposit made by the applicants. Admittedly in the present case,
all the applicants have only made initial deposit. They have not paid any portion of the amount, in
time. Therefore, Rule 13 of the Bengaluru Development Authority(Allotment of Sites) Rules, 1982, is
not applicable as alleged by the applicants.
57. Learned Senior Counsel made reference to Annexure-B in W.P.No.22681/2015 to contend that
the allotment letter dated 13.03.2002 clearly depicts that only initial deposit of `21,500/- was made
and not any portion of value of the property paid. Thereby, no mandamus can be issued in the
absence of any statutorily enforceable right. Thereby, the learned single Judge is not justified in
issuing a writ of mandamus.
58. Learned Senior Counsel further contended that the learned single Judges of this Court, while
passing the impugned Orders in different writ petitions have not considered the fact that there was
inordinate delay in approaching the Court.

59. In support of his contentions, with regard to Rule 13 of the Bengaluru Development Authority
(Allotment of Sites) Rules, 1982, learned Senior Counsel relied upon the following dictums of the

III. ARGUMENTS ADVANCED BY THE LEARNED COUNSEL FOR THE RESPONDENTS-WRIT
PETITIONERS
62. Per contra, Sri N.Devadas, learned Senior Counsel for some of the respondents/writ petitioners
contended that the Bengaluru Development Authority Act, 1976 (Karnataka Act 12 of 1976) came
into force with effect from 05.02.1976 with an object to have a common Authority for the
development of metropolitan city. The Act was enacted to provide for the establishment of an
Authority for the development of the City of Bengaluru and areas adjacent thereto and for matters
connected therewith. Bengaluru City with its population is a Metropolitan City. Different authorities
like the City of Bengaluru Municipal Corporation, the City Improvement Trust Board, the Karnataka
Industrial Area Development Board, the Housing Board and Bengaluru City Planning Authority are
exercising jurisdiction over the area. Some of the functions of these authorities like development,
planning etc. are overlapping, creating thereby avoidable confusion, besides hampering coordinated
development. It is, therefore, considered necessary to set-up a single authority like the Delhi
Development Authority for the city areas adjacent to it which in course of time become part of the
city.
Accordingly, the Bengaluru Development Authority Act was enacted for speedy implementation of
the said objects and also the 20 point programme and, for establishing a co-ordinating Central
Authority, urgent action was called for. Moreover, the haphazard and irregular growth would
continue unless checked by the Development Authority and it may not be possible to rectify or
correct mistakes in future. Thereby, the Bengaluru Development Authority Act, 1976 was enacted.

Bangalore Development Authority vs Sri B L Ramakrishna on 23 September, 2022
63. Learned Senior Counsel for the respondents/writ petitioners further contended that under
Section 2(a) of the Bengaluru Development Authority Act, 1976, 'Authority' means the Bengaluru
Development Authority constituted under Section 3; Section 2(h) defines 'Chairman' means the
chairman of the Authority; Section 3 of the Act stipulates the constitution and incorporation of the
Authority. Section 8 contemplates Meetings of the Authority. Section 8(4) contemplates that, all
questions which come up before any meeting of the Authority shall be decided by a majority of the
votes of the members present and voting and in the event of an equality of votes, the Chairman or in
his absence, the person presiding, shall have and exercise a second or casting vote. Section 12
stipulates the appointment of Commissioner, Section 13 (2)(a) contemplates 'carry into effect the
resolutions of the Authority'. He further contended that the proceedings of the resolution dated
23.07.2007 issued by the Bengaluru Development Authority refers to sites with dimensions 20 ft. x
30 ft, 30 ft. x 40 ft. and not 40 ft. x 60 ft. or 50 ft. x 80ft.
64. Learned Senior Counsel further contended that the resolution dated 03.09.2007 in Subject
Number 106/2007 referred to the Circular dated 18.10.2007 and it refers to sites measuring 20 ft. x
30 ft and 30 ft.x 40 ft. He further contended that resolution dated 29.04.2010 issued by the
Bengaluru Development Authority refers to Circular dated 18.11.2010 which stipulates that payment
should be made on or before 31.12.2020. The provisions of Section 65B of the Bengaluru
Development Act came into force with effect from 06.06.1986. He further contended that the
statement of objections filed in the present writ appeals narrates how applicants/original petitioners
are entitled to sites by paying remaining balance sital value with 21% interest as has been done to
the similarly placed persons by the Bengaluru Development Authority either through Court Order or
by the BDA itself and that about 300 sites have been allotted. The same is produced as per
Annexure-R2 along with statement of objections. Annexure-R3 series depicts sale deeds of the year
2015.
65. The respondent filed statement of objections in W.A.No. 956/2021 contending that the
Commissioner, Bengaluru Development Authority, in his affidavit dated 27.09.2021 and the
endorsement dated 24.09.2021 has suppressed the material facts and has made misrepresentation.
It is further contended that the Writ Appeal cannot be entertained, as the same is filed beyond the
prescribed period of 30 days as provided under the Karnataka High Court Act. It is further
contended that the learned single Judge by the Order dated 06.11.2020 disposed off
W.P.No.22681/2015 based on the decisions made in the following writ petitions, viz.,
(i) W.P.No.13658/2015 dated 07.04.2016 (Jayakumar Shetty vs. The Commissioner, BDA);
(ii) W.P.No.19093/2012 dated 06.06.2013 (Kempamma vs. The Commissioner, BDA); and
(iii) W.P.No.38258/2013 dated 02.11.2013 (Mohan Kumar vs. The Commissioner, BDA).
It is further contended that the Bengaluru Development Authority has not filed any Appeals
challenging the Orders passed by the learned single Judge in the aforementioned three writ
petitions. On the other hand, BDA has complied with the directions issued in the said writ petitions
and has made allotment of alternative sites in favour of the writ petitioners therein. It is further
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190080663/ 32
Bangalore Development Authority vs Sri B L Ramakrishna on 23 September, 2022
contended that, in first writ petition i.e., (i)W.P.No.13658/2015, the petitioner deposited the balance
amount after the time limit prescribed by the Court. The BDA allotted the same site after lapse of
three months from the time frame fixed by the Court. In the second writ petition i.e.,
W.P.No.19093/2012, the petitioner has deposited the balance amount as per the directions in the
writ petition and thereafter, BDA executed the sale deed in her favour. In the third writ petition i.e.,
W.P.No.38258/2013, petitioner paid the amount after the time permitted by the Court. However,
BDA executed the sale deed in favour of the writ petitioner.
66. It is further contended that, in the cases on hand, inspite of the directions issued by this Court,
BDA has rejected the request for allotment of alternative site, mainly on the ground that the interest
amount is not paid by the respondent/applicants within the time permitted, though the balance sital
value is paid and received by the BDA. It is further contended that though the applicants had
requested the BDA to calculate the interest at 21% on the said amount payable by the applicants, the
BDA failed to furnish the amount of interest to be paid.
67. It is further contended that in addition to the matters stated supra, similar directions are issued
by this Court in nearly 100 writ petitions. In nearly 30 writ petitions, BDA has accepted the Orders
of the Court and no Writ Appeals have been filed against the said Orders. The respondent has
furnished the list of 39 writ petitions as per Annexure-R2 wherein, the BDA has made allotment of
alternative sites to the writ petitioners therein. Thereby, conduct of the BDA can be assessed. The
BDA has filed Writ Appeals in certain cases with a malafide intention only for the reason that the
petitioners therein could not raise to the unlawful expectations of the Officers of BDA. It is further
contended that taking advantage of the directions issued by this Court in nearly 100 writ petitions,
BDA Officers on their own have made re-allotment of sites to many people who were allotted sites
during the year 2000 and have cancelled the allotment of sites from 2002 and onwards. The
respondent has furnished the details of persons in whose favour re- allotment is made by the BDA,
and the same is extracted, as under:

08.10.2004 24.11.2015 03.02.2018
68. It is further contended that, in view of the repeated complaints of citizens against
the Officers of the Bengaluru Development Authority about their corrupt practices
adopted and followed in respect of the affairs of the BDA such as, allotment and
re-allotment of sites, execution of sale deeds, plan approvals, the Anti Corruption
Bureau raided the Office of BDA on 19.11.2021 and on subsequent dates and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190080663/ 33
Bangalore Development Authority vs Sri B L Ramakrishna on 23 September, 2022
unearthed the large scale irregularities and corruption by officials during acquisition
and allotment of lands in residential layouts. During the said raids, the preliminary
estimates pegged the fraud at over `100 crores. The Secretary of the Bengaluru
Development Authority did not issue any statement either on the raid or on the initial
findings of the Anti Corruption Bureau. However, the Chairman of BDA admitted a
large scale corruption indulged in by the Officers/officials of the Bengaluru
Development Authority from top to bottom and his efforts to cleanse the BDA from
corruption could not succeed so far.
69. It is further contended that W.A.No.49/2022 filed is not in good faith. The
contention of the appellant/BDA that, 'the learned single Judge ought to have taken
note of Rule 13 of the of the Bengaluru Development Authority (Allotment of Sites)
Rules, 1982, and since the validity of the said Rule was not challenged, a direction
cannot be issued by the Court in violation of the Rule and direction could not have
been issued to allot an alternative site after a lapse of long time', are untenable and
such contentions are unfair and unreasonable. Though BDA has accepted and
implemented the directions of this Court in hundreds of writ petitions, till recently,
but filing Writ Appeals only in respect of certain cases depicts that BDA lacks
bonafides and as such the very conduct of BDA as observed by the Division Bench by
the Orders dated 24.08.2021 and 16.09.2021 passed in CCC No.455/2021 has to be
seriously taken note of. It is further contended that BDA has issued the Circular in
the year 2010 authorising to accept the sital value with 21% interest from the
allottees. Immediately after coming to know about the said Circular, a representation
was filed to accept the balance sital value with 21% interest. Since the BDA failed to
consider the representation, the respondent is left with no other option but to
approach this Court for necessary relief. Hence there is no delay in approaching this
Court.
70. It is further contended in the statement of objections that, the BDA has
suppressed the material and relevant facts that the Appeals filed earlier by BDA are
dismissed by this Court. Writ Appeal No.3079/2019 filed by the BDA against the
directions issued in W.P.No.9092/2015 dated 11.03.2019 came to be dismissed by the
Division Bench by the Order dated 17.02.2021. The said Order when challenged in
Special Leave to Appeal (C) No.13861/2021 the Hon'ble Supreme Court, dismissed
the same by the Order dated 27.09.2021. So also, W.A.No.45/2020 and
W.A.No.110/2020 filed by the BDA came to be dismissed by the Order dated
10.11.2020.
There are many such appeals filed by the BDA which are already dismissed by the Division Bench.
With regard to the contention of the BDA relating to the application of Rule 13 undermining the two
Circulars issued by the BDA at the instance of the State Government, the respondent contended that
both the State Government and the BDA were aware of the existence of Rule 13 of the Rules but on
the face of it, they have issued Circulars as a matter of policy to help the economically weaker
sections who had lost their sites due to their inability to pay the allotment price within time. It is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190080663/ 34
Bangalore Development Authority vs Sri B L Ramakrishna on 23 September, 2022
further contended that the contention urged by the BDA which is noted in the Order dated
01.10.2021 that in any case the learned single Judge should have directed to allot the alternative site
on the prevalent rate which is subject to availability of alternative site, is wholly arbitrary, unjust
and unreasonable. BDA has not stipulated such terms and conditions for similarly placed allottees
who have secured directions from this Court.
71. It is further contended that the conduct of the BDA amounts to hoodwinking the orders of the
Division Bench in Contempt Petition, by filing the present Writ Appeal to escape from the contempt
proceedings. It is further contended that BDA is not fair in adopting the policy of 'pick and choose'
in filing writ appeals and, justice and fair play does not permit a statutory authority to indulge in
dubious methods depriving a citizen of weaker section, of his/her legitimate right to secure
allotment of a site taking benefit of BDA's own circulars issued de-horse Rule 13, discriminating
between allottees who are similarly placed, which is violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of
India and the action of the BDA amounts to violation of Right to Life guaranteed under Article 21 of
the Constitution by discriminating between the beneficiaries of the Circulars of the BDA in securing
sites/alternative sites to a person of weaker section. The Court ought to have directed to allot
alternative sites on the prevalent rate, which virtually defeats the right of such allottee due to her
weak economic position. Thereby, sought to dismiss the Writ Appeals.
72. Learned Senior Counsel further contended that the allotment letter dated 13.03.2002 issued by
the Bengaluru Development Authority produced as per Annexure-B in W.A.No.956/2021 clearly
depicts that the price of the site measuring 9 mtrs x 12 mtrs is `1,71,700/-. The initial deposit made
by the allottee is `21,500/- and the balance payable is `1,50,500/- No Objection Certificate dated
13.03.2002 issued by the Bengaluru Development Authority depicts that the Sale Deed will be
executed and possession of the site will be handed over to the allottee on completion of all
formalities. The Bengaluru Development Authority has no objection to mortgage the property by the
allottee in favour of LIC/HDFC/HUDCO/IDBI/BOB/ Nationalized Banks/ Scheduled Banks/ Citi
Bank/ ICICI Bank/ Co- op. Banks for the purpose of raising loan to meet the cost of the site. The
letter dated 26.04.2002 produced as per Annexure-D to W.A.No.956/2021 depicts that the
respondent-Shanthamma has addressed a letter to the Commissioner, Bengaluru Development
Authority, stating that she has received the Allotment Letter in respect of Site No.330, 9th Block, 6th
Stage, Banashankari Layout and when she inspected the site, it was found that there was a
ditch(halla) in the allotted site and as she is aged and not owning any house, sought for allotment of
alternative site and that she is ready to pay the sital value. Annexure-E is the Show Cause Notice
dated 22.08.2002 issued by the BDA asking as to why the allotment should not be cancelled as the
respondent failed to pay the balance sale consideration amount and Annexure-F is the copy of the
envelop which depicts that the show cause notice is not served on the allottee. The BDA, by the
Order dated 29.01.2003 as per Annexure-G, cancelled the allotment. The Annexures-H and J are
Circulars dated 18.10.2007 and 18.11.2010. Again, the respondent made representations dated
03.06.2004 and 25.04.2013 as per Annexures-K and L for allotment of site. Annexure-M is the
representation dated 12.03.2007 addressed to the Hon'ble Chief Minister, by the respondent,
praying for allotment of site. Learned Senior Counsel also referred to the Order dated 06.06.2013
passed in W.P.No.19093/2012 produced as per Annexure-P, wherein, the learned single Judge of
this Court directed the BDA to consider the prayer of the petitioner therein for allotment of site in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190080663/ 35
Bangalore Development Authority vs Sri B L Ramakrishna on 23 September, 2022
the light of the Circular dated 18.11.2010 issued by the BDA.
73. Learned Senior Counsel further contended that, Annexure-R1-copy of the note sheet produced
along with statement of objections by the respondent, at paragraph 62 depicts regarding the Order
passed by this Court in W.P.No.22681/2015 dated 06.11.2020 and the endorsement at paragraph 65
regarding the decision taken to transmit the file to the legal department to take legal opinion in the
matter. Paragraph 72 of the said note sheet depicts that the Law Officer has given his opinion to take
suitable decision to inform the petitioner to make payment of balance amount along with interest
and on making payment, steps can be taken to allot an alternate site in her favour and further that
there are no sufficient grounds to prefer Writ Appeal and the same is also accepted by the
Commissioner. In spite of the same, the present Commissioner who took charge on 30.04.2021, at
paragraph 90 of the note sheet, on 10.05.2021, directed to file Writ Appeal, immediately. In view of
the above, learned Senior Counsel contended that the Writ Appeal filed by the BDA is not
maintainable. He contended that the State should act like Public Trustee and sought to dismiss the
Writ Appeals.
74. In support of his contentions, Sri Devadas, learned Senior Counsel relied upon the dictum of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of:-
(i) M/s Shantistar Builders vs. Narayan
Khimalal Totame and others reported in
(1990)1 SCC 520 to contend that right to
shelter is a fundamental right guaranteed under Articles 19 and 21 of the Constitution of India.
(ii) State of Karnataka and others vs. Narasimha Murthy and others reported in (1995)5 SCC 524, to
contend that right to reasonable residence is fundamental right guaranteed under Article 21 of the
Constitution of India.
(iii) Chameli Singh and others vs. State of U.P and another reported in (1996)2 SCC 549,
paragraphs-8, 9 to 14, to contend that right to shelter, does not mean a mere right to a roof over
one's head but right to all the infrastructure necessary to enable them to live and develop as a
human being. Right to shelter when used as an essential requisite to the right to live should be
deemed to have been guaranteed as a fundamental right.
(iv) People's Union for Civil Liberties vs. Union of India and others reported in (2014)15 SCC 327,
paragraphs 1 to 3.
(v) National Legal Services Authority vs. Union of India and others reported in (2014)5 SCC 438,
paragraphs- 99, 104, 123, 131, to contend that the concept of equality in Article 14 so also the
meaning of the words "life", "liberty" and "law" in Article 21 have been considerably enlarged by
judicial decisions. Anything which is not "reasonable, just and fair" is not treated to be equal and is,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190080663/ 36
Bangalore Development Authority vs Sri B L Ramakrishna on 23 September, 2022
therefore, violative of Article 14.
(vi) Ashok Kumar Kalra vs. Wing CDR. Surendra Agnihotri and others reported in (2020)2 SCC 394
(Three Judges Bench).
75. Sri B.V.Shankaranarayana Rao, learned Senior Counsel for Sri T.A.Chandrashekar, learned
counsel for the respondent in W.A.No.518/2106 contended that no third party rights have been
created. In support of his contention, learned Senior Counsel relied upon the dictum of this Court in
the case of M.N.Umesh vs. State of Karnataka, rep. by its Under Secretary, Urban Development
Department, Bengaluru and others reported in ILR 2014 KAR 3079, wherein, at paragraph 31, it is
held as under:
"31. In the instant case, the facts are otherwise. When the appellants made their
respective applications for allotment of sites, they were well aware that after the
allotment, the balance sital value had to be deposited within the stipulated time. If
they did not do so, they were liable to pay interest and if the time stipulated for
payment of the balance sital value with interest also expired, the allotment was
deemed to be cancelled. Thus, an express order of cancellation of allotment was not
required. But in these cases, there has also been an express cancellation of allotment.
But the appellants did not choose to assail the same at the earliest point of time, in
case they had a grievance about the cancellation of the allotment. That apart, if these
appellants were a part of 317 persons, who formed a class of persons who had failed
to pay the balance sital value in time, they could have sought relief at an earlier point
of time in terms of the Government Orders dated 27/12/2005 and 04/03/2008, in
case the said orders were applicable to them. However, these appellants approached
this Court after the issuance of Circular dated 04/02/2011 by the Government
directing MUDA to abide by Rule 19 of the Allotment of Sites Rules, 1991 and after
the affidavit being filed to that effect in W.A. No. 499/2011 before this Court. Thus,
these appellants remained mute spectators when several legal proceedings were
being pursued by other allottees. They were not inclined to approach this Court at the
earliest point of time to seek a direction against MUDA, assuming that such a
direction could have been issued with regard to payment of balance sital value with
interest. Probably, these appellants were complacent and thought that even without
approaching this Court, the orders of cancellation of their allotment would be
revoked and they would be benefited in terms of the earlier orders of the State
Government. Plausibly, these appellants were under the impression that in view of
the judgment of the Division Bench of this Court in W.A. No. 499/2011, they would
be entitled to re-allotment of their cancelled sites. But that was an incorrect
impression, particularly having regard to the Circular dated 04/02/2011 and the
affidavit filed before this Court. Relief was granted to the allottees in that appeal
based on the premise that as a one time measure 91+4 persons could be re-allotted
the sites. This Court also held in that appeal that the doctrine of desuetude did not
apply to Rule 19 of the Allotment of Sites Rules, 1991. In that view of the matter,
Learned Single Judge was right in dismissing the writ petitions not only on merits
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190080663/ 37
Bangalore Development Authority vs Sri B L Ramakrishna on 23 September, 2022
but also on the ground of delay and laches."
76. He further contended that Writ Appeal No.2940/2012 filed by one Ravindran against the BDA
came to be allowed by the Judgment dated 10.09.2012. Further, W.A.No.35/2020 filed by the BDA
came to be dismissed on 11.01.2021. When the said Judgment was challenged in Special Leave to
Appeal (C) No.6786/2021, the Hon'ble Supreme Court (3 Judges Bench) by the Order dated
01.07.2021 confirmed the Judgment passed by the Division Bench of this Court. The BDA has not
challenged the execution order passed by the State or its resolution. Against the orders passed in
Writ Petitions, no Writ Appeals have been preferred by the BDA. Thereby, delay in approaching the
Court would not arise. Therefore, sought to dismiss the Writ Appeals.
77. Sri H.T.Vasanth Kumar, learned counsel for the respondent in W.A.No.618/2021, adopted the
arguments of Sri N.Devadas, learned Senior Counsel. He submitted that the respondent belongs to
scheduled caste and scheduled tribe and site measuring 60 ft. x 40 ft. was allotted to the respondent.
IV. POINTS FOR DETERMINATION
78. In view of the afore said rival contentions urged by the learned counsel for the parties, the points
that would arise for our consideration are:
(i) Whether the BDA has made out a case to interfere with the impugned Orders of the learned
single Judge directing the BDA to allot alternative sites after receipt of remaining sale consideration
with 21% interest, in terms of the Circulars issued by the BDA?
(ii) Whether the respondents/allottees are entitled to the relief sought for in the writ petitions, in
view of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India?
79. We have given our thoughtful consideration to the arguments advanced by the learned counsel
for the parties and perused the entire material on record, carefully.
V. CONSIDERATION
80. It is undisputed fact that all the respondents herein are the applicants for allotment of sites
under various categories, applied as per the applications invited by the BDA. Some of the applicants
belong to SC/ST, backward community, general category and to the weaker Sections of the Society.
Most of them have applied for site measuring 20 ft. x 30 ft., 30 ft. x 40 ft. Only two applicants have
applied for site measuring 60 ft. x 40 ft. It is also not in dispute that after number of attempts i.e.,
about 7 to 8 attempts, BDA allotted the sites fixing the price after receiving initial deposit made by
the applicants.
81. It is also not in dispute that some of the applicants made part payment to the BDA. Some of the
applicants who could not make payment, sought for extension of time, and in terms of the BDA
(Allotment of Sites) Rules, for the applicants belonging to scheduled caste and scheduled tribe, three
years time was granted to pay the amount. In respect of some of the applicants, even before the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190080663/ 38
Bangalore Development Authority vs Sri B L Ramakrishna on 23 September, 2022
expiry of three years, BDA cancelled the allotment. In some of the cases there was delay in making
payment of the balance sital value either due to the death of the applicants themselves or due to the
death of their kith and kin in the family.
82. It is also not in dispute that large number of allottees made representation stating that they
could not pay the entire sital value within the time stipulated. Therefore, the State Government
initiated proceedings and based on the said proceedings, BDA issued two Circulars dated 18.10.2007
and 18.11.2010 permitting the persons who could not pay the remaining balance amount to pay the
said amount with 21% interest as a policy decision to ensure allotment of sites to weaker sections of
the Society. The said Circulars were issued in respect of sites measuring 20 ft. x 30 ft. and 30 ft. x 40
ft. The last date fixed for payment of the balance amount was 31.03.2008.
83. It is also not in dispute that in pursuance of the said Circulars, as a scheme to provide an
opportunity to the weaker section of the Society, the learned single Judge issued directions for
allotment of sites measuring 20 ft. x 30 ft. and 30 ft. x 40 ft. Alternative sites have already been
allotted to some of the allottees, and allotment is made as mentioned in the statement of objections,
as per Annexure-R2, as under:

84. It is also not in dispute that, the learned single Judge by the Order dated 06.11.2020 disposed off
W.P.No.22681/2015 directing for allotment of site or alternative site, by following the decisions
made in the following writ petitions, viz.,
(i) W.P.No.13658/2015 dated 07.04.2016 (Jayakumar Shetty vs. The Commissioner, BDA);
(ii) W.P.No.19093/2012 dated 06.06.2013 (Kempamma vs. The Commissioner, BDA); and
(iii) W.P.No.38258/2013 dated 02.11.2013 (Mohan Kumar vs. The Commissioner, BDA).
(iv) W.P.No.5150/2019 dated 21.10.2019 (Manjunath R. vs. BDA) The petitioners in the above writ
petitions have been reallotted with alternative sites and the said orders passed by the learned single
Judge have reached finality.
85. The respondents/applicants who applied for allotment of sites measuring 30 ft. x 40 ft., 20 ft. x
30 ft. belong to weaker section of the Society and after more than eight attempts, they got allotment.
Though allotment was made, the allottees were unable to pay the balance sital amount within the
time stipulated therein. On large number of representations being made, the Government initiated
proceedings and based on the proceedings of the Government, BDA issued Circulars dated
18.10.2007 and 18.11.2010 holding that relief should be granted to the allottees after receipt of
remaining amount with 21% interest on delay before cut off date and the allottees approached this
Court with great expectations that judiciary is the repository of public faith. It is the trustee of the
people. It is the last hope of the people. After every knock at all the doors, failed people approach the
judiciary as last resort. It is the only temple worshipped by every citizen of this nation, regardless of
religion, caste, sex or place of birth.
86. The public authorities acting under the BDA Act are under constitutional duty coupled with
power. Every public servant is a trustee of the society and in all facets of public administration, every
public servant has to exhibit honesty, integrity, sincerity and faithfulness in implementation of the
political, social, economic and constitutional policies to integrate the nation, to achieve excellence
and efficiency in the public administration. A public servant entrusted with duty and power to
implement constitutional policy under Articles 14, 21 and 300 and all inter-related directive
principles of State Policy under the Constitution, should exhibit transparency in implementation
and are accountable for due effectuation of Constitutional goals.
87. It is also not in dispute that the allottee filed W.A.No.2940/2012 against the Order dated
10.04.2012 passed in W.P.No.39831/2010. The Division Bench of this Court, by the Judgment dated
10.09.2012, allowed the Writ Appeal and at paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 recorded the finding as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190080663/ 42
Bangalore Development Authority vs Sri B L Ramakrishna on 23 September, 2022
"3. xxx In the present case, however, it transpires that the Bangalore Development
Authority has in its resolution No.1996/2007 in its meeting held on 03.09.2007 has
taken a decision that in respect of sites measuring 20 ft.x30 ft./ 30ft.x40ft., since the
applicants belonged to the economically weaker sections of society, a relaxation of the
time frame in the payment of balance sital value was necessary. Keeping in view the
relative penury of these applicants, a strict approach i.e., cancellation of allotment
was abjured and instead the delay was to be condoned and any other alternate site
was to be allotted in any other layout of the Bangalore Development Authority
provided interest at the rate of 21% per annum fro the delayed period was paid. It is
also for this reason, we find that the decision in Banda Development Authority,
Banda vs. Motilal Agarwal and others reported in (2011)5 SCC 394, is not applicable
for the reason that the petitioner is not disentitled from taking advantage of the
ameliorative decision of Bangalore Development Authority itself passed on
03.09.2007. By present standards, payment of interest to the demand or receipt of
interest at the rate of 21% p.a. is nothing but punitive in nature.
4. It bears repetition that the initial sum of `21,500/- has not been tendered back by
Bangalore Development Authority to the appellant/petitioner. It also needs to be
emphasized that the balance sital value stood deposited in favour of the Bangalore
Development Authority in the Indian Overseas Bank, Bangalore, as far back as on
23.05.2002. This amount also has not been refunded or re-tendered. Therefore the
issue continued to be alive and was certainly resurrected in September 2007, when
the very salutary decision of the Bangalore Development Authority came to be taken.
5. We are of the view that the appellant/petitioner should be allowed to take
advantage of the decision of the Bangalore Development Authority taken on
03.09.2007. Accordingly, upon the appellant/petitioner making good the payment of
the interest at the rate of 21% p.a. on the balance sital amount within four weeks from
today, the Bangalore Development Authority shall allot a site measuring 30 ft. x 40 ft.
in any of its layouts, wherever such a site is available in Anjanapura, or any other
area. Interest shall be calculated with effect from the day after the last date the
amount was due till 23.05.2002, which is the date on which the entire sital value was
deposited by the appellant/petitioner. Appeal is allowed in the aforesaid terms."
88. The Commissioner, Bengaluru Development Authority, filed Writ Appeal No.35/2020
challenging the Order dated 08.04.2019 passed in W.P.No.58482/2015, and the Division Bench of
this Court, by the Judgment dated 11.01.2021, dismissed the Writ Appeal, wherein, at paragraphs 9,
10 and 11, it is observed as under:
"9. Even on merits, we find that the learned single Judge has found that there was a unilateral
decision taken by the appellant/ authority in canceling the allotment without providing any
opportunity of hearing. In the circumstances, learned single Judge directed the BDA to allot an
alternative site of the same/reasonable dimension in the same layout or in any other layout, regard
being made to all competing equities with applicable sital value as per the allotment price as on the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190080663/ 43
Bangalore Development Authority vs Sri B L Ramakrishna on 23 September, 2022
date of the impugned order with interest at 24% per annum from the date of allotment till the date
of deposit.
10. Learned counsel for the respondent also states that the respondent will abide by the conditions
imposed by the learned single Judge.
11. We find no merit in the appeal. The appeal is hence dismissed both on the aspect of delay as well
as on merits."
89. The aforesaid Judgment passed in W.A.No.35/2020 was challenged by the Commissioner,
Bengaluru Development Authority, before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Petition for Special Leave
to Appeal(c) No.6786/2021, and the three Judges Bench, by the Order dated 01.07.2021, dismissed
the petition confirming the Judgment passed in the Writ Appeal, wherein, it is observed as under:
"The Court is convened through Video
Conferencing.
Having heard learned counsel appearing for the petitioner and carefully perusing the material
available on record, we see no reason to interfere with the impugned Order passed by the High
Court of Karnataka at Bengaluru.
The Special leave Petition is, accordingly,
dismissed on merits."
90. At this stage, it is relevant to read the Circular dated 18.10.2007 issued by the Commissioner,
Bengaluru Development Authority, which reads as under:

92. Admittedly, the scheme introduced by the State Government was implemented by the Bengaluru
Development Authority, by issuing the Circulars stated supra and admittedly, till today, neither the
scheme nor the Circulars which are beneficial schemes have been withdrawn. Thereby, the
Bengaluru Development Authority cannot contend that the allottees are not entitled to writ of
mandamus, since illegality is committed by the State Government and the Bengaluru Development
Authority. Once the State Government and the Bengaluru Development Authority introduced the
scheme for the benefit of people belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, backward
community and weaker sections of the Society and, when almost all such similarly placed persons
have been allotted sites by the Bengaluru Development Authority, as stated supra, there cannot be
any discrimination between similarly placed persons.
93. It is not in dispute that the proceedings dated 23.07.2007 passed by the Bengaluru Development
Authority refers to sites with dimensions 20 ft. x 30 ft. and 30 ft. x 40 ft., and not 40 ft. x 60 ft. and
50 ft. x 80 ft. It is also not in dispute that the nearly 300 similarly placed persons like that of
petitioners have already been allotted with sites by the Bengaluru Development Authority by
receiving the balance sital value with 21% interest , as directed by the learned single Judge, in
several writ petitions, as stated supra. It is also relevant to refer to the Site Confirmation Letter
dated 12.06.2015 produced as per Annexure-R3 to the Statement of Objections in
W.A.No.956/2021, which reads as under:

94. The learned single Judge of this Court directed the Bengaluru Development Authority to allot
sites to the petitioners, after receiving the balance sital value with 21% interest. The Orders passed
by this Court in W.P.No.13658/2015 dated 07.04.2016 in the case of Jayakumar Shetty vs.
Commissioner, Bengaluru Development Authority, has reached finality. The Bengaluru
Development Authority, though belatedly, has already implemented the Orders passed by this Court
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190080663/ 48
Bangalore Development Authority vs Sri B L Ramakrishna on 23 September, 2022
and executed the sale deeds.
95. It is also not in dispute that the Bengaluru Development Authority has made re-allotment in
favour of the writ petitioners in nearly 30 writ petitions. The claim of the writ petitioners has been
accepted by the Bengaluru Development Authority and allotment is made to the writ petitioners as
per the orders passed by the learned single Judge and no Writ Appeals have been filed by the
Bengaluru Development Authority challenging the Orders passed in the writ petitions. Thereby, the
conduct and attitude of the Bengaluru Development Authority amounts to wilful discrimination
among the citizens who are similarly placed. The statement of objections filed by the
respondent/writ petitioner in W.A. No.956/2021 clearly depicts that details of persons in whose
favour re-allotment was made by the Bengaluru Development Authority, as extracted above.
96. It is further contended that, in view of the repeated complaints of the applicants against the
Officers of the Bengaluru Development Authority about their corrupt practices adopted and
followed in respect of the affairs of the BDA such as, allotment and re-allotment of sites, execution
of sale deeds, plan approvals, the Anti Corruption Bureau raided the Officers of BDA on 19.11.2021
and on subsequent dates, and unearthed the large scale irregularities and corruption by officials
during acquisition and allotment of lands in residential layouts. During the said raids, the
preliminary estimates pegged the fraud at over `100 crores.
97. It is also not in dispute that the Bengaluru Development Authority filed W.A.No.3079/2019
against the directions issued in W.P.No.9092/2015 dated 11.03.2019 which came to be dismissed by
the Judgment dated 17.02.2021, wherein, at paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 it is held as under:
"5. This Court has carefully gone through the aforesaid judgment. The learned Single
Judge in the aforesaid case also granted the relief to the person who was claiming
site. Paragraph-5 of the said judgment, reads as under:-
"5. It is no doubt true that the petitioner did not attempt to pay sital value once again
after 10.04.2008 pursuant to the Circular dated 18.11.2010. But the fact remains that
the petitioner had mad representation and attempted to pay sital value in the year
2008 itself. Since the Circulars at Annexures-D and E are issued by the BDA in order
to help poor people who are allotted site measuring smaller dimensions, ie., 20'x30'
and 30'x40'; and as the petitioner was ready to pay sital value in the month of April
2008 itself, he may be shown leniency. Accordingly, the following order is made."
6. In the considered opinion of this Court, the learned Single Judge was justified in allowing the writ
petition, especially keeping in view the fact that the respondent has deposited the entire sale
consideration on 17.03.2004 and no amount was due. However, the respondent has been directed to
pay interest at 21% pa. from the due date till the date of depositing the entire amount.
7. Resultantly, this Court does not find any reason to interfere with the order passed by the learned
Single Judge. The writ appeal is dismissed."

Bangalore Development Authority vs Sri B L Ramakrishna on 23 September, 2022
98. When the said Judgment was challenged by the BDA in SLP No.13861/2021, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court, by the Order dated 27.09.2021, dismissed the Special Leave Petition, which reads as
under:
"Heard the learned Counsel for the petitioner.
We do not find any good ground to interfere with the judgment and order passed by
the High Court.
The special Leave Petition is dismissed.
Pending application(s) shall stand disposed of. However, the question of law is kept
open.
Thus, the Order passed by this Court has reached finality.
99. It is also not in dispute that the State Government and the Bengaluru Development Authority,
knowingfully well the provisions of Section 65 of the Bengaluru Development Authority Act, 1976
and Rule 13 of the BDA (Allotment of Sites) Rules, 1982, issued Circulars as a matter of policy to
facilitate economically weaker sections of the Society who lost the sites due to their inability to pay
the sital vale within the time stipulated by the Bengaluru Development Authority. When that is the
case, it is not fair on the part of the Bengaluru Development Authority to adopt the policy of "pick
and chose" and filing Writ Appeals in some cases and not filing in some other cases and thereby
depriving weaker sections of the Society which amounts to willful discrimination and violation of
Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India.
100. At this stage, it is relevant to extract Section 65 of the Bangalore Development Authority Act,
1976, which reads as under:
"65. Government's power to give directions to the Authority - The Government may
give such directions to the authority as in its opinion are necessary or expedient for
carrying out the purposes of this Act, and it shall be the duty of the authority to
comply with such directions."
The aforesaid provision empowers the State Government to issue general directions to the
Bengaluru Development Authority and Government to give such directions to the Authority as in its
opinion are necessary or expedient for carrying out the purpose of the Act, which shall be the duty of
the Authority to comply with such directions.
101. The contention raised by the learned Senior Counsel for BDA in the present Writ Appeals that
directions issued by the State Government and the Circulars issued by the Bengaluru Development
Authority are irregular, cannot be accepted. The Government can issue directions, which, in its
opinion, are necessary or expedient for carrying out the purpose of the Act. Such directions have to
be implemented which is the objective of the Act and the BDA cannot act contrary to the provisions
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190080663/ 50
Bangalore Development Authority vs Sri B L Ramakrishna on 23 September, 2022
of the Act and Rules.
102. Admittedly, in the present cases, based on the directions issued by the State Government,
Circulars came to be issued and the BDA precipitated for allotment of sites on payment of 21%
interest on the balance sital value. It was a 'policy decision' taken by the State Government and
accordingly, the Bengaluru Development Authority issued Circulars. Admittedly, the direction
issued by the State Government under Section 65 of the Bengaluru Development Authority Act has
not been withdrawn till today, so also the Circulars issued by the Bengaluru Development Authority
to allot sites by receiving 21% interest on the balance sital value is also not withdrawn.
103. Though learned Senior Counsel for the BDA contended that Rule 13 of the Bengaluru
Development Authority (Allotment of Sites) Rules, 1982, does not make any difference on the basis
of dimension of sites and it applies to all allotments, the said contention cannot be accepted, as the
proceedings issued by the Government dated 23.07.2007 applies only in respect of sites measuring
20 ft. x 30 ft. and 30 ft. x 40 ft. and, in obedience of the said proceedings, two Circulars dated
18.10.2007 and 18.11.2010 came to be issued by the BDA precipitating the applicants to pay the
balance sital value beyond the time stipulated under Rule 13 of the Bengaluru Development
Authority (Allotment of Sites) Rules, 1982. It is also not in dispute that in similar circumstances, on
the directions issued by the learned single Judge of this Court confirmed by the Division Bench and
the Hon'ble Supreme Court, now the BDA cannot contend that the writ petitioners cannot claim
equity in illegality, in violation of Rule 13 of the Bengaluru Development Authority (Allotment of
Sites) Rules, 1982.
104. It is not the case of the BDA that after realising the mistake, they have rectified the same. In the
absence of such rectification, the contention of the learned Senior Counsel for the BDA that
mandamus cannot be issued, cannot be accepted as it was a 'policy decision' of the State
Government and the same was obeyed by issuing Circulars by the BDA and no contention was raised
by the BDA before the learned single Judge with regard to issuance of Circulars in violation of
Section 65 of the BDA Act and Rule 13 of the Bengaluru Development Authority (Allotment of Sites)
Rules, 1982. The same cannot be permitted to be agitated for the first time in the present Writ
Appeals.
105. It is also not in dispute that the resolution passed by the BDA dated 03.09.2007 in subject
No.106/2007 lead to issuance of Circular dated 18.10.2007 and it refers to sites measuring 20 ft. x
30 ft. and 30 ft.x 40 ft. Even the original file maintained by the BDA depicts that the proceedings
terminated into Circular and paragraph 72 of the note sheet depicts that the Law Officer gave his
opinion to take suitable decision to inform the allottee to make payment of balance amount along
with interest and on making payment, to take steps to allot an alternate site. It was also noted that
there are no sufficient grounds to prefer Writ Appeal and the same was also accepted by the
Commissioner. In spite of the same, the present Commissioner who took charge on 30.04.2021, at
paragraph 90 of the note sheet, on 10.05.2021, directed to file Writ Appeal, forthwith.
106. The State Government, as well as the BDA who act as public trustee and custodian of citizens of
the State like the present writ petitioners who filed applications for allotment of sites and after more
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190080663/ 51
Bangalore Development Authority vs Sri B L Ramakrishna on 23 September, 2022
than 7 to 8 attempts, ultimately got the allotment letters in respect of small sites measuring 20 ft. x
30 ft. and 30 ft. x 40 ft., cannot take step-motherly attitude in alloting sites. Therefore, the learned
single Judge was justified in issuing mandamus to the BDA and granting time to the petitioners
therein to pay balance sital value with 21% interest and upon making such payment, BDA to take
necessary steps to allot alternative sites in favour of the petitioners. The same is in accordance with
law.
107. The Order dated 11.04.2022 passed in Civil Appeal No.2884/2022 relied upon the learned
Senior Counsel for the BDA is a case where, the allottee had made number of attempts for allotment
of a site and finally, on 07.04.2003, a site measuring 40 ft. x 60 ft. was allotted by the BDA.
However, the notice sent by the BDA was not served on the petitioner since he was not residing in
the address shown in the application on account of his transfer to some other. Therefore, the
allotment was cancelled. He approached the High Court after lapse of 13 years, in
W.P.No.53206/2016 challenging the cancellation Order dated 17.12.2003. The learned single Judge
allowed writ petition, which order was confirmed by the Division Bench. When the BDA approached
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the aforesaid Civil Appeal No.2884/2022, the same was allowed,
dismissing the order passed by the learned single Judge of this Court, holding that Rule 13 of the
Bengaluru Development Authority (Allotment of Sites) Rules, 1982, mandates the allottee to deposit
the sital value after deducting initial deposit and the petitioner failed to deposit the said amount and
there is no corresponding application to allot alternative site. Admittedly, the facts and
circumstances of the said case is different. In the present cases, except two petitioners, all other
petitioners are claiming for allotment of small sites measuring 20 ft. x 30 ft. and 30 ft. x 40 ft. and
the facts are entirely different.
108. In the cases on hand, the Bengaluru Development Authority has passed two resolutions and
issued two Circulars. The representation made by the BDA is acted upon by the petitioners honestly
believing the promise made by the BDA and when the Commissioner, BDA, failed to carry out the
effect of the resolutions, petitioners approached this Court for the reliefs sought for with great
expectations treating the Court as temple of justice. Once the resolutions are passed by the BDA on
the basis of the directions issued by the State Government as contemplated under Section 65 of the
Act, admittedly, when the said resolutions are still existing, the BDA is estopped to contend that the
resolutions are not binding on the BDA and therefore, the said contention cannot be accepted.
109. The Hon'ble Supreme Court, in the case of M/s Shantistar Builders vs. Narayan Khimalal
Totame and others reported in (1990)1 SCC 520 held that right to shelter is fundamental right
guaranteed under Articles 19(1) and 21 of the Constitution of India and at paragraphs 9 and 12, it is
held as under:
9. Basic needs of man have traditionally been accepted to be three -- food, clothing
and shelter. The right to life is guaranteed in any civilized society. That would take
within its sweep the right to food, the right to clothing, the right to decent
environment and a reasonable accommodation to live in. The difference between the
need of an animal and a human being for shelter has to be kept in view. For the
animal it is the bare protection of the body; for a human being it has to be a suitable
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190080663/ 52
Bangalore Development Authority vs Sri B L Ramakrishna on 23 September, 2022
accommodation which would allow him to grow in every aspect -- physical, mental
and intellectual. The Constitution aims at ensuring fuller development of every child.
That would be possible only if the child is in a proper home. It is not necessary that
every citizen must be ensured of living in a well-built comfortable house but a
reasonable home particularly for people in India can even be mud-built thatched
house or a mud-built fire-proof accommodation.
12. Members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes have ordinarily been
accepted as belonging to the weaker sections. Attempt to bring in the test of economic
means has often been tried but no guideline has been evolved. Undoubtedly, apart
from the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, there would be
millions of other citizens who would also belong to the weaker sections. The
Constitution-makers intended all citizens of India belonging to the weaker sections to
be benefited when Article 46 was incorporated in the Constitution.
Parliament in adopting the same language in Section 21 of the Act also intended people of all weaker
sections to have the advantage. It is, there- fore, appropriate that the Central Government should
come forward with an appropriate guideline to indicate who would be included within weaker
sections of the society.
110. The Hon'ble Supreme court, in the case of state of Karnataka and others vs. Narasimha Murthy
and others reported in (1995)5 SCC 524, at paragraph 7, held as under:
"7. Right to shelter is a fundamental right under Article 19(1) of the Constitution. To
make the right meaningful to the poor, the State has to provide facilities and
opportunity to build a house. Acquisition of the land to provide house sites to the
poor houseless is a public purpose as it is a constitutional duty of the State to provide
house sites to the poor. Admittedly, final notification under sub-section (4) of Section
3 did contain the name of the first respondent."
111. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Chameli Singh and others vs. State of U.P and
another reported in (1996)2 SCC 549, at paragraphs-8, held as under:
"8. In any organised society, right to live as a human being is not ensured by meeting
only the animal needs of man. It is secured only when he is assured of all facilities to
develop himself and is freed from restrictions which inhibit his growth. All human
rights are designed to achieve this object. Right to live guaranteed in any civilised
society implies the right to food, water, decent environment, education, medical care
and shelter. These are basic human rights known to any civilised society. All civil,
political, social and cultural rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights and Convention or under the Constitution of India cannot be exercised
without these basic human rights. Shelter for a human being, therefore, is not a mere
protection of his life and limb. It is home where he has opportunities to grow
physically, mentally, intellectually and spiritually. Right to shelter, therefore,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190080663/ 53
Bangalore Development Authority vs Sri B L Ramakrishna on 23 September, 2022
includes adequate living space, safe and decent structure, clean and decent
surroundings, sufficient light, pure air and water, electricity, sanitation and other
civic amenities like roads etc. so as to have easy access to his daily avocation. The
right to shelter, therefore, does not mean a mere right to a roof over one's head but
right to all the infrastructure necessary to enable them to live and develop as a
human being. Right to shelter when used as an essential requisite to the right to live
should be deemed to have been guaranteed as a fundamental right. As is enjoined in
the Directive Principles, the State should be deemed to be under an obligation to
secure it for its citizens, of course subject to its economic budgeting. In a democratic
society as a member of the organised civic community one should have permanent
shelter so as to physically, mentally and intellectually equip oneself to improve his
excellence as a useful citizen as enjoined in the Fundamental Duties and to be a
useful citizen and equal participant in democracy. The ultimate object of making a
man equipped with a right to dignity of person and equality of status is to enable him
to develop himself into a cultured being. Want of decent residence, therefore,
frustrates the very object of the constitutional animation of right to equality,
economic justice, fundamental right to residence, dignity of person and right to live
itself. To bring the Dalits and Tribes into the mainstream of national life, providing
these facilities and opportunities to them is the duty of the State as fundamental to
their basic human and constitutional rights."
112. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of People's Union for Civil Liberties vs. Union of India
and others reported in (2014)15 SCC 327, paragraphs 1 to 6, held as under:
"1. Article 21 of the Constitution states that no person should be deprived of his life or
personal liberty except according to the procedure established by the law. Over the
years, this Court's jurisprudence has added significant meaning and depth to the
right to life. A large number of judgments interpreting Article 21 of the Constitution
have laid down that right to shelter is included in right to life.
2. In Francis Coralie Mullin v. UT of Delhi [Francis Coralie Mullin v. UT of Delhi,
(1981) 1 SCC 608 : 1981 SCC (Cri) 212] Bhagwati, J. stated that: (SCC pp. 618- 19,
para 8) "8. ... the right to life includes the right to live with human dignity and all that
goes along with it, namely, the bare necessaries of life such as adequate nutrition,
clothing and shelter and facilities for reading, writing and expressing oneself in
diverse forms, freely moving about and mixing and commingling with fellow human
beings. Of course, the magnitude and content of the components of this right would
depend upon the extent of the economic development of the country, but it must, in
any view of the matter, include the right to the basic necessities of life and also the
right to carry on such functions and activities as constitute the bare minimum
expression of the human-self."
3. In Chameli Singh v. State of U.P. [Chameli Singh v. State of U.P., (1996) 2 SCC 549] this Court
interpreted Article 21 in the following words: (SCC p.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190080663/ 54
Bangalore Development Authority vs Sri B L Ramakrishna on 23 September, 2022
555, para 8) "8. ... Right to live guaranteed in any civilised society implies the right to food, water,
decent environment, education, medical care and shelter. These are basic human rights known to
any civilised society.
All civil, political, social and cultural rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
and Convention or under the Constitution of India cannot be exercised without these basic human
rights. Shelter for a human being, therefore, is not a mere protection of his life and limb."
4. In CESC Ltd. v. Subhash Chandra Bose [CESC Ltd. v. Subhash Chandra Bose, (1992) 1 SCC 441 :
1992 SCC (L&S) 313] this Court held that right to social and economic justice is a
fundamental right. Right to health of a worker is a fundamental right. Therefore,
right to life enshrined in Article 21 means something more than mere survival or
animal existence. The right to live with human dignity with minimum sustenance and
shelter and all those rights and aspects of life which would go to make a man's life
complete and worth living, would form part of the right to life. Enjoyment of life and
its attainment--social, cultural and intellectual-- without which life cannot be
meaningful, would embrace the protection and preservation of life guaranteed by
Article 21.
5. The State owes to the homeless people to ensure at least minimum shelter as part of the State
obligation under Article 21.
6. In Parmanand Katara v. Union of India [Parmanand Katara v. Union of India, (1989) 4 SCC 286 :
1989 SCC (Cri) 721] this Court observed that Article 21 casts the obligation on the State to preserve
life which is the paramount duty of the State according to the Constitution.
113. The Hon'ble Supreme Court, in the case of National Legal Services Authority vs. Union of India
and others reported in (2014)5 SCC 438, at paragraph-99 to 104, held as under:
"99. The concept of equality in Article 14 so also the meaning of the words "life",
"liberty" and "law" in Article 21 have been considerably enlarged by judicial
decisions. Anything which is not "reasonable, just and fair" is not treated to be equal
and is, therefore, violative of Article 14.
100. Speaking for the vision of our Founding Fathers, in State of Karnataka v.
Ranganatha Reddy [(1977) 4 SCC 471 : AIR 1978 SC 215] , this Court speaking
through Krishna Iyer, J. observed :
(SCC p. 496, paras 44-45) "44. The social philosophy of the Constitution shapes
creative judicial vision and orientation. Our nation has, as its dynamic doctrine,
economic democracy sans which political democracy is chimerical. We say so because
our Constitution, in Parts III and IV and elsewhere, ensouls such a value system, and
the debate in this case puts precisely this soul in peril.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190080663/ 55
Bangalore Development Authority vs Sri B L Ramakrishna on 23 September, 2022
45. ... Our thesis is that the dialectics of social justice should not be missed if the
synthesis of Part III and Part IV is to influence State action and court
pronouncements. Constitutional problems cannot be studied in a socio-economic
vacuum, since socio-cultural changes are the source of the new values, and sloughing
off old legal thought is part of the process of the new equity-loaded legality. A Judge
is a social scientist in his role as constitutional invigilator and fails functionally if he
forgets this dimension in his complex duties."
(emphasis in original)
101. While interpreting Article 21, this Court has comprehended such diverse aspects as children in
jail entitled to special treatment (Sheela Barse v. Union of India [(1986) 3 SCC 596 : 1986 SCC (Cri)
337] );
health hazard due to pollution (M.C. Mehta v. Union of India [(1987) 4 SCC 463] ); beggars' interest
in housing (Kali Dass v. State of J&K [(1987) 3 SCC 430] ); health hazard from harmful drugs
(Vincent Panikurlangara v. Union of India [(1987) 2 SCC 165 :
1987 SCC (Cri) 329] ); right to speedy trial (Raghubir Singh v. State of Bihar [(1986)
4 SCC 481 : 1986 SCC (Cri) 511] ); handcuffing of prisoners (Aeltemesh Rein v. Union
of India [(1988) 4 SCC 54 : 1988 SCC (Cri) 900 : AIR 1988 SC 1768] ); delay in
execution of death sentence; immediate medical aid to injured persons (Parmanand
Katara v. Union of India [(1989) 4 SCC 286 : 1989 SCC (Cri) 721] ); starvation deaths
(Kishen Pattnayak v. State of Orissa [1989 Supp (1) SCC 258 : AIR 1989 SC 677] ); the
right to know [Reliance Petrochemicals Ltd. v. Indian Express Newspapers Bombay
(P) Ltd. [(1988) 4 SCC 592 : AIR 1989 SC 190] ]; right to open trial (Kehar Singh v.
State (Delhi Admn.) [(1988) 3 SCC 609 : 1988 SCC (Cri) 711 : AIR 1988 SC 1883] and
inhuman conditions in after-care home (Vikram Deo Singh Tomar v. State of Bihar
[1988 Supp SCC 734 : 1989 SCC (Cri) 66 : AIR 1988 SC 1782] ).
102. The most remarkable feature of this expansion of Article 21 is that many of the non-justiciable
directive principles embodied in Part IV of the Constitution have now been resurrected as
enforceable fundamental rights by the magic wand of judicial activism, playing on Article 21 e.g.:
(a) Right to pollution-free water and air (Subhash Kumar v. State of Bihar [(1991) 1
SCC 598 : AIR 1991 SC 420] ).
(b) Right to a reasonable residence
(Shantistar Builders v. Narayan Khimalal
Totame [(1990) 1 SCC 520 : AIR 1990 SC
630] ).
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190080663/ 56
Bangalore Development Authority vs Sri B L Ramakrishna on 23 September, 2022
(c) Right to food, clothing, decent
environment; and even protection of
cultural heritage (Ramsharan
Autyanuprasi v. Union of India [1989 Supp
(1) SCC 251 : AIR 1989 SC 549] ).
(d) Right of every child to a full
development (Shantistar
Builders v. Narayan Khimalal
Totame [(1990) 1 SCC 520 : AIR 1990 SC
630] ).
(e) Right of residents of hilly areas to
access to roads (State of H.P. v. Umed Ram
Sharma [(1986) 2 SCC 68] ).
(f) Right to education (Mohini
Jain v. State of Karnataka [(1992) 3 SCC
666] ), but not for a professional degree
(Unni Krishnan, J.P. v. State of A.P. [(1993)
1 SCC 645] ).
103. A corollary of this development is that while so long the negative language of
Article 21 and use of the word "deprived" was supposed to impose upon the State the
negative duty not to interfere with the life or liberty of an individual without the
sanction of law, the width and amplitude of this provision has now imposed a positive
obligation (Vincent Panikurlangara v. Union of India [(1987) 2 SCC 165 : 1987 SCC
(Cri) 329] ) upon the State to take steps for ensuring to the individual a better
enjoyment of his life and dignity e.g.:
(i) Maintenance and improvement of public health (Vincent Panikurlangara v. Union
of India [(1987) 2 SCC 165 : 1987 SCC (Cri) 329] ).
(ii) Elimination of water and air pollution (M.C. Mehta v. Union of India [(1987) 4
SCC 463] ).
(iii) Improvement of means of communication (State of H.P. v. Umed Ram Sharma
[(1986) 2 SCC 68] ).
(iv) Rehabilitation of bonded labourers (Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India
[(1984) 3 SCC 161 : 1984 SCC (L&S) 389] ).
(v) Providing human conditions in prisons (Sher Singh v. State of Punjab [(1983) 2
SCC 344 : 1983 SCC (Cri) 461 : AIR 1983 SC 465] ) and protective homes (Sheela
Barse v. Union of India [(1986) 3 SCC 596 :
1986 SCC (Cri) 337] ).
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190080663/ 57
Bangalore Development Authority vs Sri B L Ramakrishna on 23 September, 2022
(vi) Providing hygienic condition in a slaughterhouse (Buffalo Traders Welfare Assn.
v. Maneka Gandhi [1994 Supp (3) SCC 448] ).
104. The common golden thread which passes through all these pronouncements is
that Article 21 guarantees enjoyment of life by all citizens of this country with dignity,
viewing this human right in terms of human development.
114. The Hon'ble Supreme Court, in the case of Ashok Kumar Kalra vs. Wing CDR. Surendra
Agnihotri and others reported in (2020)2 SCC 394 (Three Judges Bench), at paragraph-50, held as
under:
50. It is well settled that procedural rules should not be interpreted so as to defeat
justice, rather than furthering it. This is because procedural law is not meant to serve
as a tyrant against justice, but to act as a lubricant in its administration. Thus, when
courts set out to do justice, they should not lose sight of the end goal amidst
technicalities. In some cases, this means that rules that have traditionally been
treated as mandatory, may be moulded so that their object and substantive justice is
not obstructed. It would be apposite to remember that equity and justice should be
the foremost considerations while construing procedural rules, without nullifying the
object of the legislature in totality. Thus, rules under the Limitation Act which may
allow for filing of a belated counterclaim up to a long period of time, should not be
used to defeat the ends of justice.
115. The Hon'ble Supreme Court, in the case of Varinder Kumar vs. State of Himachal Pradesh,
reported in LAWS(SC)- 2019-2-39, at paragraph 13 held as under:
"13. Law has to cater to wide variety of situations as appear in society. Law being
dynamic, the certainty of the legislation appears rigid at times whenever a
circumstance (set of facts) appears which is not catered for explicitly. Expediency
then dictates that the higher judiciary, while interpreting the law, considers such
exception(s) as are called for without disturbing the pith and substance and the
original intention of the legislature. This is required primarily for the reason to help
strike a balance between competing forces--justice being the end--and also because
the process of fresh legislation could take a long time, which would mean failure of
justice, and with it erosion of public confidence and trust in the justice delivery
system."
116. While considering the provisions of Article 300A and 21 of the Constitution of India, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court, in the case of Vidya Devi vs. State of Himachal Pradesh and others reported
in (2020)2 SCC 569 at paragraphs 12.10, 12.12 and 12.13, held as under:
12.10. This Court in State of Haryana v. Mukesh Kumar [State of Haryana v. Mukesh
Kumar, (2011) 10 SCC 404 : (2012) 3 SCC (Civ) 769] held that the right to property is
now considered to be not only a constitutional or statutory right, but also a human
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190080663/ 58
Bangalore Development Authority vs Sri B L Ramakrishna on 23 September, 2022
right.
Human rights have been considered in the realm of individual rights such as right to shelter,
livelihood, health, employment, etc. Human rights have gained a multi-faceted dimension.
12.12. The contention advanced by the State of delay and laches of the appellant in moving the Court
is also liable to be rejected. Delay and laches cannot be raised in a case of a continuing cause of
action, or if the circumstances shock the judicial conscience of the Court. Condonation of delay is a
matter of judicial discretion, which must be exercised judiciously and reasonably in the facts and
circumstances of a case. It will depend upon the breach of fundamental rights, and the remedy
claimed, and when and how the delay arose. There is no period of limitation prescribed for the
courts to exercise their constitutional jurisdiction to do substantial justice.
12.13. In a case where the demand for justice is so compelling, a constitutional court would exercise
its jurisdiction with a view to promote justice, and not defeat it. [P.S. Sadasivaswamy v. State of
T.N., (1975) 1 SCC 152 : 1975 SCC (L&S) 22]
117. While considering the provisions of Article 14 of the Constitution of India, the Hon'ble Supreme
Court, in the case of Vetindia Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and another reported
in AIR 2020 SC 5753 at paragraph 14, held as under:
"14. That brings us to the question of delay. There is no doubt that the High Court in
its discretionary jurisdiction may decline to exercise the discretionary writ
jurisdiction on the ground of delay in approaching the court. But it is only a rule of
discretion by exercise of self-restraint evolved by the court in exercise of the
discretionary equitable jurisdiction and not a mandatory requirement that every
delayed petition must be dismissed on the ground of delay. The Limitation Act stricto
sensu does not apply to the writ jurisdiction.
The discretion vested in the court under Article 226 of the Constitution therefore has
to be a judicious exercise of the discretion after considering all pros and cons of the
matter, including the nature of the dispute, the explanation for the delay, whether
any third-party rights have intervened, etc. The jurisdiction under Article 226 being
equitable in nature, questions of proportionality in considering whether the
impugned order merits interference or not in exercise of the discretionary
jurisdiction will also arise. This Court in Basanti Prasadv. Bihar School Examination
Board [Basanti Prasad v. Bihar School Examination Board, (2009) 6 SCC 791 :
(2009) 2 SCC (L&S) 252] , after referring to Moon Mills Ltd. v. M.R. Meher [Moon
Mills Ltd. v. M.R.Meher, AIR 1967 SC 1450], Maharashtra SRTC v. Balwant Regular
Motor Service [Maharashtra SRTC v. Balwant Regular Motor Service, (1969) 1 SCR
808 : AIR 1969 SC 329] and State of M.P. v. Nandlal Jaiswal [State of M.P. v. Nandlal
Jaiswal, (1986) 4 SCC 566] , held that if the delay is properly explained and no
third-party rights are being affected, the writ court under Article 226 of the
Constitution may condone the delay, holding as follows : (Basanti Prasad case
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190080663/ 59
Bangalore Development Authority vs Sri B L Ramakrishna on 23 September, 2022
[Basanti Prasad v. Bihar School Examination Board, (2009) 6 SCC 791 : (2009) 2
SCC (L&S) 252] , SCC p. 796, para 18) "18. In the normal course, we would not have
taken exception to the order passed by the High Court. They are justified in saying
that a delinquent employee should not be permitted to revive the stale claim and the
High Court in exercise of its discretion would not ordinarily assist the tardy and
indolent person. This is the traditional view and is well supported by a plethora of
decisions of this Court. This Court also has taken the view that there is no inviolable
rule, that, whenever there is delay the Court must refuse to entertain a petition. This
Court has stated that the writ court in exercise of its extraordinary jurisdiction under
Article 226 of the Constitution may condone the delay in filing the petition, if the
delay is satisfactorily explained."
118. Though a contention was raised by the learned Senior Counsel for the BDA that the writ
petitions are filed at a belated stage and therefore, they are liable to be dismissed on the ground of
delay and laches, the fact remains that the petitioners were made to run pillar to post for allotment
of site. The BDA discriminated the cases of the petitioners and when similarly placed persons have
already been allotted alternative sites, the writ petitioners approached the Court for the relief sought
for based on the scheme introduced by the State Government. The BDA in almost all cases after 7 to
9 attempts made by the applicants issued allotment letters. Thereby, there cannot be any delay in
filing the writ petitions as alleged by the BDA.
119. It is well settled that, when substantial justice and technical considerations are pitted against
each other, cause of substantial justice deserves to be preferred for the other side cannot claim to
have vested right in injustice being done because of a non-deliberate delay. It must be grasped that
judiciary is respected not on account of its power to legalize injustice on technical grounds but
because it is capable of removing injustice and is expected to do so.
120. Learned Senior counsel for BDA relied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the
case of Maharshi Dayanand University vs. Surjeet Kaur reported in (2010)11 SCC 159, to contend
that, no Court has competence to issue direction contrary to law nor can direct an authority to act in
contravention of statutory provisions. Admittedly, in the present intra Court Appeals, the orders
passed in the writ petitions are on the basis of the scheme formulated by the State Government and
Resolutions passed by BDA permitting the allottees to pay balance sital value together with 21%
interest and the BDA was directed to take steps to allot the subject sites or alternative sites. Thereby,
the learned single Judge has neither issued any direction contrary to law nor directed the BDA to act
in contravention of statutory provisions, but, has directed to act in accordance with the scheme
issued by State Government. Thereby, the said Judgment has no application to the facts and
circumstances of the present case.
121. Learned Senior Counsel for BDA relied upon the Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the
case of Chingleput Bottlers vs. Majestic Bottling Company reported in (1984)3 SCC 258 to the effect
that the High Court has no power to issue mandamus granting licence to the respondent therein i.e.,
Majestic Bottling Company and the High Court has no jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus
directing the Commissioner to grant licence, and it must be shown under the Act and Rules framed
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190080663/ 60
Bangalore Development Authority vs Sri B L Ramakrishna on 23 September, 2022
thereunder that there was a legal duty imposed on the Commissioner to issue a licence. Thereby no
mandamus lies where the duty sought to be enforced is of a discretionary nature nor will a
mandamus issue to compel the performance by public body or authority of an act contrary to law.
Admittedly in the present intra Court Appeals, mandamus has been issued by learned single Judge
directing the BDA to allot the sites in favour of the applicants on receiving the balance sale
consideration amount along with 21% interest. On the basis of the scheme of the State Government
and resolution of the BDA, admittedly, BDA has allotted sites to large number of similarly placed
persons, accepting 21% interest on the remaining sital value. Thereby there cannot be any
discrimination among respondents and other persons in whose favour already sites have been
allotted on the basis of the mandamus issued by this Court. When there are notifications and
resolutions passed by BDA to allot sites by accepting the remaining sital value with 21% interest, the
judgment relied upon by the learned Senior Counsel has no application to the facts and
circumstances of the present cases.
122 Learned Senior Counsel for the BDA contended that the Hon'ble Supreme Court, in the case of
Chameli Singh vs. State of U.P., reported in (1996)2 SCC 549, held that right to shelter, does not
mean a mere right to a roof over one's head but right to all the infrastructure necessary to enable
them to live and develop as a human being. Right to shelter when used as an essential requisite to
the right to live should be deemed to have been guaranteed as a fundamental right. As is enjoined in
the Directive Principles, the State should be deemed to be under an obligation to secure it for its
citizens, of course subject to its economic budgeting. In fact, this judgment is in favour of the
respondents and will no way help the appellants/BDA.
123. The learned senior counsel for appellants/BDA also relied upon the dictum of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of State of Haryana vs. Ram Kumar Mann reported in (1997)3 SCC 321,
to contend that, the petitioner must have an enforceable right; relief wrongly given to others cannot
be claimed; unless there is an enforceable right, plea of discrimination could not be validly raised. In
the present intra Court Appeals, though there is delay in filing the writ petitions based on the
scheme introduced by State Government as well as resolution passed by the BDA, it is not the case of
the BDA that the orders issued by State Government and circulars issued thereon by the BDA are in
violation of Section 65 of the BDA Act and Rule 13 of the Bengaluru Development
Authority(Allotment of Sites) Rules, 1982. The enforceable right to the petitioners have been
provided by the State Government and the BDA by introducing the scheme to allot sites by receiving
21% interest on the remaining sital value. It is to be noted at this juncture that, Article 14 would
apply only when invidious discrimination is meted out to equals and similarly circumstanced
without any rational basis or relationship in that behalf. Thereby the said judgment has no
application to the facts and circumstances of the present intra Court Appeals.
124. Learned Senior counsel further relied upon the dictum of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the
case of Vishal Properties (P) Ltd., vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and others reported in (2007) 11 SCC
172, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that, Article 14 of the Constitution of India is not
meant to perpetuate an illegality. It provides for positive equality and not negative equality. Any
action/order passed contrary to law does not confer any right upon any person for similar
treatment. In the present intra Court Appeals, except two petitioners, all the other petitioners
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190080663/ 61
Bangalore Development Authority vs Sri B L Ramakrishna on 23 September, 2022
belong to weaker sections of the society and applied for allotment of sites measuring 20 ft. x 30 ft.
and 30 ft. x 40 ft. and after 8 to 10 attempts and, at last, they were allotted the sites. As the value of
the allotment was not made within the time, allotment in respect of large number of applicants came
to be cancelled. And in pursuance of the representations made by the allottees to the State
Government, the State Government introduced the scheme and based on the said scheme, the BDA
passed resolutions to accept 21% interest on the remaining balance sital value and allot the sites or
alternative sites, as one time settlement, and almost all the applicants have utilized the said scheme
and got benefited. Admittedly the said scheme or the circular issued by State Government or BDA
has not been withdrawn till today. Thereby, the present respondents sought writ of mandamus
based on the positive equality. Thereby, the said judgment has no application to the facts and
circumstances of the intra Court Appeals on hand.
125. The other judgment with similar preposition is in the case of Basawaraj and another vs. Special
Land Acquisition Officer reported in (2013)14 SCC 81, the Hon'ble Supreme Court, while
considering Article 14 of the Constitution of India, held that Article 14 is not meant to perpetuate
illegality or fraud even by extending wrong decisions made in other cases. Article 14 has only
positive aspects and negative equality is not envisaged thereunder. This Court has no quarrel with
the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. But, when the scheme has been introduced by
State Government for the benefit of economically backward classes and till today the said scheme
has not been withdrawn, the petitioners who approached this Court on positive aspects cannot be
deprived of the relief given to similarly placed persons. Therefore, the said judgment has no
application to the facts and circumstances of the present intra Court Appeals.
126. Learned Senior Counsel for the BDA further relied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of Major E.G.Barsay vs. State of Bombay, reported in AIR 1961 SC 1762, to contend
that, where the evidence establishes that the order was made by Deputy Secretary on behalf of the
Central Government in exercise of the power conferred on him under the rules delegating such
power to him the order cannot be questioned. Admittedly in the present intra Court Appeals, the
State Government voluntarily came forward to introduce the scheme in order to protect the people
belonging to backward classes as they could not pay the amount within the time due to their
economical disability. Thereby all the respondents are entitled to the benefit of the scheme.
Therefore, said judgment has no application to the facts and circumstances of the present intra
Court Appeals.
127. Learned Senior counsel for the appellants also relied upon the dictum of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of Shankara Cooperative Housing Society Limited vs. M.Prabhakar and others
reported in (2011)5 SCC 607 regarding delay in filing writ petitions. It is true that delay and laches is
one of the factors that requires to be borne in mind by the High Courts when they exercise their
discretionary power under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The High Court may refuse to
invoke its extraordinary powers, if there is such negligence or omission on the part of the applicant
to assert his rights taken in conjunction with the lapse of time and other circumstances. In the
present intra Court Appeals, the State Government introduced the scheme and based on the said
scheme, BDA passed the resolutions for allotment of sites, as the applicants belong to backward
community or scheduled castes/ scheduled tribes and were unable to pay the sital value within the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190080663/ 62
Bangalore Development Authority vs Sri B L Ramakrishna on 23 September, 2022
time prescribed. When some of the applicants approached the Court and succeeded, there was some
delay for the present petitioners in approaching the Court. As delay is not fatal to the case, in order
to do complete justice and in the interest of both the parties, the High Courts can exercise
discretionary power under Article 226 of the Constitution of India to condone the delay. It is
relevant to state at this stage that, when substantial justice and technical considerations are pitted
against each other, cause of substantial justice deserves to be preferred for the other side cannot
claim to have vested right in injustice being done because of a non-deliberate delay. It must be
grasped that judiciary is respected not on account of its power to legalise injustice on technical
grounds but because it is capable of removing injustice and is expected to do so. Thereby, only on
the ground of delay, writ petitions cannot be dismissed as there is a reasonable explanation for the
delay, as the Court should not harm innocent parties if their rights had emerged by the delay on the
part of the petitioners. Thereby, the said judgment has no application to the facts and circumstances
of the present intra Court Appeals.
128. Another judgment relied upon by the learned Senior Counsel for the BDA in the case of
Smt.H.B.Premakumari vs. State of Karnataka and another reported in (2013)5 KLJ 279, rendered by
the coordinate Bench of this Court, was a case where, while considering Rule 13 of the Bengaluru
Development Authority(Allotment of Sites) Rules, 1984 it was held that, in terms of the Rules, even
if time is to be extended, the same can be extended upto 90+60+150 i.e., about 300 days, that too by
paying appropriate interest. However, the coordinate Bench, while dismissing Appeal permitted the
appellant to make fresh application seeking fresh allotment from BDA. Therefore, the said judgment
has no application to the facts and circumstances of the present intra Court Appeals.
129. The Division Bench of this Court in the case of Telecom Employees Co-operative Housing
Society Ltd. Vs. Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Minority Communities and Backward Classes
Improvement Centre reported in ILR 1990 KAR 3320 held that, the question as to whether the
Government has power to issue directions to make bulk allotment under Section 65 of the BDA Act,
answered that under the said Section, Government is enabled to give directions to the BDA 'as are
necessary or expedient' for carrying out the purposes of the Act. Section 65 is not subject to any
restrictions while Section 38 is so subjected, and it is merely an administrative order. The said
judgment has no application to the facts and circumstances of the present intra Court Appeals.
130. Learned Senior Counsel relied upon the judgment in the case of State of Karnataka and others
vs. Saveen Kumar Shetty reported in (2002)3 SCC 426, wherein, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has
dealt with the consequence of failure to execute the lease agreement provided by Rule 18 of the
Karnataka Excise (Lease of the Right of Retail Vend of Liquors) Rules 1969. In the present intra
Court Appeals, the cause of action arose for all the allottees when the scheme came to be introduced
by the State Government and BDA issued resolutions to that effect and allotted sites and alternative
sites to several persons who belong to economically weaker section, on the basis of the scheme and
when the State Government issued the scheme, same was followed by the BDA by passing
resolutions to implement the scheme. Naturally, the parties i.e., the State Government and BDA
should act like public trustees in order to fulfil the mandatory provisions of Articles 14, 21 and 300
of the Constitution of India. The State Government and authorities like Bengaluru Development
Authority are under constitutional duty coupled with power. Every public servant is a trustee of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190080663/ 63
Bangalore Development Authority vs Sri B L Ramakrishna on 23 September, 2022
society and in all facets of public administration, every public servant has to exhibit honesty,
integrity, sincerity and faithfulness in implementation of the political, social, economic and
constitutional policies to integrate the nation, to achieve excellence and efficiency in the public
administration. Thereby the said judgment has no application to the facts and circumstances of the
present intra Court Appeals.
131. The Order dated 11.04.2022 passed in Civil Appeal No.2884/2022 relied upon the learned
Senior Counsel for the BDA is a case where, the allottee had made number of attempts for allotment
of a site and finally, on 07.04.2003, a site measuring 40 ft. x 60 ft. was allotted by the BDA.
However, the notice sent by the BDA was not served on the petitioner since he was not residing in
the address shown in the application on account of his transfer to some other. Therefore, the
allotment was cancelled. He approached the High Court after lapse of 13 years, in W.P.
No.53206/2016 challenging the cancellation Order dated 17.12.2003. The learned single Judge
allowed writ petition, which order was confirmed by the Division Bench. When the BDA approached
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the aforesaid Civil Appeal No.2884/2022, the same was allowed,
dismissing the order passed by the learned single Judge of this Court, holding that Rule 13 of the
Bengaluru Development Authority (Allotment of Sites) Rules, 1982, mandates the allottee to deposit
the sital value after deducting initial deposit and the petitioner failed to deposit the said amount and
there is no corresponding application to allot alternative site. Admittedly, the facts and
circumstances of the said case is different. In the present cases, except two petitioners, all other
petitioners are claiming for allotment of small sites measuring 20 ft. x 30 ft. and 30 ft. x 40 ft. and
the facts are entirely different.
132. The other judgment relied upon by the learned Senior counsel for the BDA in the case of
Nasiruddin and others vs. Sita Ram Agarwal reported in (2003)2 SCC 577, and the judgment in the
case of Sangram Singh vs. Election Tribunal, reported in AIR 1955 SC 425, and other judgments are
not applicable to the facts and circumstances of the present intra Court Appeals.
133. For the reasons stated above, the first point raised for consideration in the present intra Court
Appeals has to be answered in the negative holding that BDA has not made out any case to interfere
with the impugned orders passed by the learned single Judge directing BDA to allot alternative site
after receipt of remaining sital value with 21% interest in terms of circular issued by the BDA.
Accordingly the second point is answered in the affirmative holding respondents/ allottees are
entitled to the relief sought for in the writ petitions as contemplated under Articles 14 and 21 of
Constitution of India, in view of the specific scheme introduced by the State Government and
resolution passed by the BDA as one time settlement.
134. On meticulous reading of the pleadings, documents, this Court is of the considered opinion that
BDA/appellants have not made out any ground to interfere with the impugned orders of the learned
single Judge in exercise of appellate powers under Section 4 of the High Court Act, as the scope of
the Intra Court Appeal is very limited.
135. In view of the above we pass following:
