insisted to retain weighing machine and there was a quarrel and altercation between
brothers. Hearing the commotion, A1/Murugesan had questioned PW2 as to why he
was shouting and had slapped him. Seeing that the victim had questioned the first
accused as to why he had slapped his brother and had told A1 that it
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis was a fight between brothers and they would settle
the matter among themselves. Pursuant to the wordy altercation, A1 had pushed the
victim/Senthil and punched him on his stomach and thereafter, A2 and A3 have
joined A1 and all the three had kicked the victim on his stomach repeatedly. PW3 who
is the co-brother of the victim was also informed about the incident. On the very

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99848151/ 3
Murugesan vs The State Represented By on 3 December, 2021
@ about 8.00pm and the victim breathed his last on 14.12.2015 @ 10.30pm, after a period of
78days. The occurrence had taken place during night hours and at that time of admission, no
external injuries were found on the deceased, even as per the prosecution few minutes prior to the
alleged occurrence there had been wordy quarrel and altercation between the victim/Senthil and his
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis brother/PW2, with regard to returning of a weighing machine.
8. As per the evidence of PW1/wife of the deceased, PW2 had came to their house and had requested
the victim/Senthil to hand over the weighing machine to sell and settle his liabilities. Since, the
victim had refused to return the weighing machine, there had been a quarrel between them and
since, they had raised their voice during quarrel, the accused who were stated to be neighbours are
alleged to have intervened and during intervention, one of the accused is stated to have slapped
PW2 and the victim had informed them, it was the fight between the brothers and they need not
interfere and they should not have assaulted his brother and there had been a quarrel and
altercation and the incident is alleged to have happened during that period. It is the specific case of
PW1 that she had left the house to a nearby shop, when her husband and PW2 were fighting and
when she came back after 10minutes, the fight was continuing between them. Therefore, the
evidence of PW1 in respect of having witnessed the intervention of the accused and having assaulted
the victim/deceased is doubtful and further, even assuming that the accused had intervened the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis fight between the brothers (deceased and PW2) and caused
injuries, no intention or knowledge can be attributed to them for having caused death of the
victim/deceased.
9. The learned counsel for the appellants would further submit that the victim/deceased is stated to
have sustained injuries on 27.09.2015 @ 8.30pm and he was referred to a nearby hospital and after
initial treatment brought back home and thereafter on the next day on 28.09.2015 referred to a
private hospital and from the private hospital he was referred to Coimbatore Government Medical
College Hospital, where a surgery was performed on the victim on 28.09.2015, initially, the case was
registered for the offence under Section 294(b), 324 and 506(ii) IPC. The victim deceased was
treated as inpatient and since the surgery performed on 28.09.2015 was not successful and there
was complication another surgery was performed on 20.10.2015 and even thereafter, the victim
continued to be in treatment for several days and he died on 14.12.2015 due to the complications in
surgery. Neither the scan report taken at hospital for first time nor the case sheets and the surgery
notes regarding the surgery https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis performed on the victim/deceased
were marked by the prosecution. The prosecution has failed to prove by letting in cogent evidence
that the injuries alleged to have been sustained by the victim was sufficient in the ordinary course of
nature to cause death of the victim. Though, three appellants were stated to have involved in the
occurrence, no specific evidence has been let in by the prosecution to prove which accused caused
which injury. Though there were several houses available in the vicinity other than PW1 and PW2 no
other independent witnesses had been examined to speak about the incident. Further, PW9/Sub
Inspector of Police is stated to have examined the victim while he was under treatment and no steps
have been taken to mark his statement or record the dying declaration of the victim, thereby
creating suspicion in the prosecution case.

Murugesan vs The State Represented By on 3 December, 2021
10. The learned counsel would further submit that even as per the prosecution no weapon has been
used and the incident is alleged to have happened during the sudden quarrel, when the accused
neither had the intention nor the knowledge that their act would result in the death of the victim
deceased and nothing has been elicited by the prosecution that such
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis injuries were sufficient in ordinary course of nature to cause
death. The appellants could utmost be held liable for the offence under Section 323 IPC and not
otherwise, he would reiterate that the incident had happened on 27.09.2015 and the death was on
15.12.2015, due to the complications in surgery.
11. Per contra, Mr.Sugendran, learned Government Advocate (Crl.side) would submit that the
appellants are neighbours of the deceased. On 27.09.2015 at 8.00pm there was a fight between
PW2/brother of the victim and victim/Senthil. Since, there was commotion and noise the accused
who are neighbours had intervened and the first accused had warned them not to raise voice and
had slapped PW2, the victim/deceased had questioned the accused stating that it was a dispute
between brothers and they may not intervene in it. During fight, the first appellant had punched on
the stomach of the victim/deceased and the other accused have assaulted the victim/deceased with
hands and they have also assaulted PW2 with hands. When the victim/deceased had fallen down
they have also kicked on his stomach, due to which the victim had sustained internal
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis injuries. He was taken to a private hospital nearby for treatment
and thereafter he was referred back to home. On the next day he was taken to a private hospital were
scan was taken and since, the victim/deceased did not have money to perform surgery in the private
hospital, they have taken him to the Coimbatore Government Medical College Hospital were a
surgery was performed on him and since there was complications in the surgery a second surgery
was performed on him on 20.10.2015. Thereafter, the victim continued to be as an inpatient in the
hospital and later he died on 14.12.2015, due to the complication in the surgery.
12. The learned Government Advocate would further submit that the victim/deceased had sustained
internal injuries due to the assault by the accused and the Doctor who had conducted postmortem
had deposed that the injury was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. However,
he would submit that scan report and the surgery notes and case sheets of the victim/deceased
regarding the surgery were not marked by the prosecution.
13. Heard the rival submissions made on both sides and perused the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis materials available on record.
14. Now what is to be seen is whether the prosecution has proved the charges against the
accused/appellant beyond all reasonable doubt. Whether the trial Court is right in finding the
accused guilty for the offence under Section 304(ii) IPC.
15. While analysing the evidence on record, PW1 who is the wife of the victim/deceased, had
deposed that on 27.09.2015 @ 8.00pm her husband and her brother in law (PW2) were discussing
and PW2 was asking her husband to give him the weighing machine at that time, the first
appellant/Murugesan had come to their house and questioning him why he was raising noise and
assaulted (PW2) and at that time her husband had questioned him why he had assaulted his brother

Murugesan vs The State Represented By on 3 December, 2021
and the other two accused had assaulted her husband in the stomach and stamped him and
thereafter the victim was taken to Jacob Hospital and they administered an injection to him and
sent them. However, her husband complained of stomach pain and on the next day morning she had
taken her husband to another hospital and https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis taken scan of her
husband and the Doctors there had informed that he was serious and referred him to Coimbatore
Government Medical College Hospital. The police had obtained her statement at Coimbatore
Government Medical College Hospital and registered the case. On 14.12.2015, her husband passed
away without responding to treatment. In her cross examination, she had stated that she is not
aware of the time of quarrel between her husband and her brother in law. She had further deposed
that she had left to a nearby shop and the fight continued between her husband and brother in law
for 10minutes, till she returned back from the shop. She had stated that at the time of occurrence all
the villagers had gathered there, however, she had denied the suggestions that her husband
sustained injury during the fight between her husband and her brother in law/PW2.

gone to his brother's house to show his two wheeler, at that time, he had asked his brother to give
the weighing machine to him to sell and settle his liabilities, his brother had refused and they were
discussing and at that time, the first accused had intervened and questioned
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis him as to why he was raising his voice and that he had told him
that it was his brother's house and he was discussing with his brother. The first accused had slapped
him and his brother had intervened and told him that it was a fight between brothers and he raised
his hands against A1 and attempted to assault A1, at that time, A1 had pushed his brother and
punched on his stomach and his brother had fallen down. A2 and A3 nearby had rushed to the place
and assaulted him and his brother and he intervened and the accused also pushed him. Hearing the
noise, the neighbours had gathered there and the accused have gone away. Thereafter, he had taken
his brother to Jacob hospital and they had administered an injection and sent his brother back.
During night his brother had stomach pain and it was informed to him by his sister in law/PW1. On
the next day, he had asked his sister in law to take him to Saran hospital and that they have taken
X-ray and informed that his brother had sustained injury in his stomach and they have to perform a
surgery and it will incur expenses. Since, he did not have money he had taken his brother to the
Coimbatore Government Medical College Hospital. The police enquired him in the hospital and later

30. The case of the prosecution as per Ex.P6/complaint given by PW1 is that on 27.09.2015 her
brother in law/PW2 had came to the house and asked her husband to give the weighing machine
and her husband had refused to give it to him, due to which there was a fight between her husband
and her brother in law/PW2. At that time, A1 who was living in the opposite house had shouted at
them saying why are they fighting and creating noise and slapped her brother in law and that her
husband told him that it was fight between the brothers and why he had slapped his brother and
there was a fight and at that time, two other neighbours A2 and A3 have rushed to the place and
they have punched his stomach and kicked on his stomach and her husband had sat down holding
his stomach and later she had taken him to Jacob hospital and after initial treatment had come back
to home and on the next day her husband was having stomach pain and she had taken him to Saran
hospital and the Doctor at Saran hospital after taking a Scan had informed her that there was a
bleeding inside the stomach and referred him to Coimbatore Government Medical College Hospital.

31. Thereafter, as per PW11 a surgery had been performed on 28.09.2015 by a team of Doctors in the
Emergency unit of Coimbatore Government Medical College Hospital, since there was complication
in the initial surgery a subsequent surgery had been performed on 20.10.2015 and ultimately the
victim had passed away on 14.12.2015 due to complications in surgery. Admittedly, in this case,
neither the initial scan report nor the case sheets, surgery notes of the victim had been marked by
the prosecution and no evidence had been let in by the prosecution to explain what was the nature of
the surgery performed and the nature of the treatment given to the victim. Though, PW9/Sub
inspector of Police is stated to have recorded a statement from the victim when he was in the
hospital during treatment, the statement has not been marked, thereby creating a suspicion in the
case. Further, PW1 had stated that all the villagers have assembled at the scene of occurrence,
whereas the prosecution has not examined any independent witnesses to speak about the incident.
Further, even as per the postmortem report/Ex.P8 excepting a surgical scar 13x2cm noted over the
upper abdomen, 4cm below xiphi sternum, no other injuries have been found. As per the evidence of
PW1 and PW2, the incident had occurred during a https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis quarrel and the
witnesses have not spoken as if the accused had intention or knowledge that their act would cause
death of the victim. However, in this case, the victim had died 78days after the occurrence. The
prosecution has failed to rule out that the victim did not died on account of complications in the

surgery and the injuries inflicted by the accused was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to
cause death. The prosecution has also failed to establish which accused caused which injury. In this
case, the charges have been framed for the offence under Section 302 IPC and not under Section
302 r/w.34 IPC.
32. In this case, the prosecution has failed to prove its case for the offence under Section 304 (ii) IPC
beyond all reasonable doubts. The trial Court had not considered the lacunas on the part of the
prosecution side in proper perspective. However, in this case, there is some evidence that the
accused have assaulted the victim deceased. This Court is of the opinion that at the most, the
accused could be convicted for the offence under Section 323 IPC.

33. In the result, the criminal appeal stands partly allowed by setting aside the judgment dated
30.01.2019 made in SC.No.156 of 2016 on the file of the II Additional District and Sessions Judge,
Tiruppur and the conviction of the appellants/accused for the offence punishable under Section
304(ii) IPC is modified to offence punishable under Section 323 IPC. Consequently, the sentence of
imprisonment is modified to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 325 day. It is stated that the
accused are now in prison and the period of sentence already undergone by them shall be set off
under Section 428 Cr.PC.
