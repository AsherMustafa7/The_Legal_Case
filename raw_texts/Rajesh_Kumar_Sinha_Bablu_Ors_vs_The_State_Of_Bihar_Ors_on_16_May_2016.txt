Having considered the absurd nature of allegations in the Complaint Petition and also the
relationship between the parties I have no hesitation in holding that the present prosecution is
malicious and deserves to be set aside.
Hence, the application is allowed and the proceeding including the order of cognizance dated
12.7.2010 passed by the Judicial Magistrate, 1st class, Motihari in Complaint case No.597 of 2009 is
hereby set aside.
