ORDER
22.07.2021 Order No. This matter is taken up by video conferencing mode.
Heard Mr. J.K. Khuntia, learned counsel for the petitioner and learned Additional Government
Advocate for the State-opposite parties.
The petitioner has filed this writ petition seeking direction to the opposite party no.2 to regularize
his services as NFCP Supervisor in the office of the CuttackMunicipal Corporation, Cuttack with all
consequential service benefits in terms of the principle decided in Secretary State of Karnataka and
Others v. Umadevi, (2006) 4 SCC 1 and in State of Karnataka & others Vrs. M.L. Kesari & others
reported in 2010 (II) OLR SC 982 involving SLP(C) No.15774/2006.
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner was engaged as NFCP Supervisor on
DLR basis on 01.09.1994. He has already rendered more than 26 years of service under the opposite
parties and therefore, seeks for regularization of services in view of the judgment passed by the
Hon'ble apex Court in Secretary State of Karnataka and others v. Umadevi, (2006) 4 SCC 1 and in
State of Karnataka & others Vrs. M.L. Kesari & others reported in 2010 (II) OLR SC 982 involving
SLP(C) No.15774/2006.
Considering the contentions raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner and after going through
the records, it appears that the petitioner has rendered service for more than 26 years on monthly
remuneration basis. Therefore, the case of the petitioner is squarely covered by the ratio decided in
the cases cited supra.
