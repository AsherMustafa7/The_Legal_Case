Page 21 [2] These petitions involve the question of validity of the insertion of 'failing clause' in the
Manipur Civil Engineering Service (PWD) Rules, 2016 as applicable to Irrigation and Flood Control
Department (IFCD) [now, redesignated as Water Resources Department] with respect to the rules
prescribing promotion from the post of Assistant Engineer (AE) to the post of Executive Engineer
(EE). Schedule-III to the adopted Rules of 2016 stipulates regular service in the feeder cadre as the
eligibility criteria for promotion from the post of Assistant Engineer to that of Executive Engineer
as- (a) in case of Degree holders, 6 years; (b) in case of Diploma holders, 9 years; and (c) in case of
Diploma holders who have passed both Sections of A & B of AMIE Examination of Institute of
Engineers (India), 6 years from the date of passing the examination or 7 years in the grade,
whichever is shorter. While adopting the Manipur Civil Engineering Service (PWD) Rules, 2016 and
the Manipur Electrical & Mechanical Engineering Service (PWD) Rules, 2016 in the Department of
Irrigation and Flood Control (IFCD), [now known as Water Resources Department] vide
Notification dated 14.12.2016, the offending 'failing clause' (impugned in the present petitions) was
added. The 'failing clause' reads as "Failing which, Assistant Engineer/Assistant Surveyor of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164783826/ 15
Shahid Mohammed Shah vs The State Of Manipur on 30 October, 2023
Works/Engineer Assistant possessing at least Diploma in Civil Engineering with 17 years of regular
service in the grades of Assistant Engineer and Section Officer Grade-I/Equivalent out of which at
least 3 years of regular service shall be in the grade of Assistant Engineer". The Direct Recruit
Assistant Engineers challenge this clause as violative of principle of equality enshrined under
Articles 14, 16 & 21 of the Constitution of India.
Page 22 Some of the writ petitions challenge the subsequent Department Promotion Committee
(DPC) and the subsequent promotion order; the Seniority List dated 01.02.2018 of Assistant
Engineers; and also Notification dated 04.01.2018 which introduced 'one time relaxation' in the
'failing clause' reducing the 3 years to 2 years. The failing clause has subsequently been deleted by
another Notification dated 17.11.2021 and in WP(C) No. 78 of 2022, some of the Direct Recruits
(who have now completed stipulated 6 years of regular service in the grade) pray for conducting
fresh DPC for promotion to the post of Executive Engineers in Water Resource Department in terms
of Notification dated 17.11.2021. Since all these writ petitions are related to the same issue of
promotion from the post of Assistant Engineer to the post of Executive Engineer in Water resource
Department and the vires of 'failing clause' in the recruitment rules, these petitions are taken up
together for disposal by this common judgment.
[3] Brief facts of the present cases shredding all unnecessary details are that vide Notification dated
14.12.2016, Government of Manipur adopted the Manipur Civil Engineering Service (PWD) Rules,
2016 and the Manipur Electrical & Mechanical Engineering Service (PWD) Rules, 2016 in the
Department of Irrigation and Flood Control (IFCD), now known as Water Resources Department.
While adopting the Rules of PWD, the impugned 'failing clause' has been introduced for the first
time in the adopted rules concerning Water Resources Department.
[4] Vide another Notification dated 04.01.2018, State Government introduced 'one time relaxation
clause' in qualifying period of service for Page 23 promotion to the post of Executive Engineer
(Civil/Mechanical) as 17 years regular service in the grade of Assistant Engineer and Section Officer
put together with at least 2 years of regular service in the grade of Assistant Engineers. The 'one time
relaxation clause' reads as- "By promotion from amongst the Assistant Engineers (Civil/Mechanical)
with 17(Seventeen) years regular service in the grades of Assistant Engineer (Civil/Mechanical) and
Section Officer (Civil/Mechanical) put together, out of which atleast 2(two) years of regular service
shall be in the grade of Assistant Engineer (Civil/Mechanical)." This 'one time relaxation' would be
valid till 31.03.2018. [5] Later on, vide Notification dated 17.11.2021, State Government dropped the
failing clause and restored the rules in the original position. However, 'one time relaxation clause'
valid for 3 months from the date of notification by adding clause (d) and the same reads as- " ....OR,
(d) By promotion from amongst the Assistant Engineers (Civil/Mechanical) with 20 years of regular
service in the grade of Assistant Engineer and Section Officer put together with a minimum year of 4
years in AE level". [6] The Notifications dated 14.12.2016; 04.01.2018 & 17.11.2021 issued by the
State Government adopted recruitment rules with respect to Water Resources Department are
reproduced below for easy reference.

[7] Vide order dated 24.01.2018 in WP(C) No. 917 of 2017, this Court passed an ex-parte ad-interim
order directing not to hold DPC till 31.01.2018 and on 31.01.2018 the interim order was extended till
05.02.2018. In another writ petition being WP(C) No. 80 of 2018, field by two direct recruit
Assistant Engineers challenging seniority list dated Page 29 25.11.2017, vide order dated 31.01.2018,
this Court passed an interim order not to hold DPC till 02.02.2018. However, WP(C) No. 80 of 2018
was closed on 02.02.2018 as infructuous as the authority produced another seniority list and
accordingly, interim order dated 31.01.2018 was vacated. [8] On 05.02.2018 when WP(C) No. 917 of
2017 was taken up, learned counsel for the petitioners informed this Court that the authorities
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164783826/ 20
Shahid Mohammed Shah vs The State Of Manipur on 30 October, 2023
conducted DPC on 03.02.2018 by issuing a Notice dated 01.02.2018 and on the same day, ie, on
03.02.2018 promotion order for 20 Assistant Engineers to the post of Executive Engineers. Vide
order dated 05.02.2018, the authority issued transfer and posting order of those 20 promoted
Executive Engineers. Having found prima facie materials for invoking suo motu contempt
proceedings for conducting DPC and issuing promotion order during the subsistence of interim
order, this Court issued notice the officials concerned including the DPC Members for personal
appearance on 12.02.2018.
[9] After passing of order dated 05.02.2017 in WP(C) No. 917 of 2017, the Manipur Public Service
Commission (MPSC) wrote a letter dated 07.02.2018 to the Secretary, Water Recourses, Govt. of
Manipur stating that the DPC was conducted on 03.02.2018 on the information furnished by the
department that the interim order not to hold DPC was vacated on 31.01.2018 and without verifying
the record, the DPC was conducted. On coming to know of this bonafide mistake, MPSC decided on
07.02.2018 to withdraw the concurrence to the DPC proceeding held on 03.02.2018. On Page 30
12.02.2018, the officials of MPSC appeared before this Court and explained in details the manner
the DPC was conducted on 03.02.2018 and the same was withdrawn on 07.02.2018 on coming to
know about the subsistence of interim order. The personal appearance of the officials was dispensed
and earlier interim order dated 24.01.2018 in WP(C) No. 917 of 2017 was extended from time to
time. It may be noted that there were two interim orders both dated 31.01.2018 directing not to hold
DPC- one in WP(C) No. 917 of 2018 and another in WP(C) No. 917 of 2017. The interim order dated
31.01.2018 in WP(C) No. 917 of 2017 was extended till 05.02.2018 while interim order dated
31.01.2018 in WP(C) No. 80 of 2018 was vacated on 02.02.2018 on disposal of the writ petition as
infructuous. This might be the reason for confusion in MPSC about the existence of interim order.
[10] Two set of writ petitions being WP(C) No. 156 of 2018 and WP(C) No. 164 of 2018 were filed by
the promotees to challenge the letter dated 07.02.2018 issued by MPSC withdrawing the
concurrence to the DPC held on 03.02.2018. Some of the direct recruit-Assistant Engineers also
filed another writ petition being WP(C) No. 166 of 2018 challenging the DPC proceedings dated
03.02.2018; promotion order dated 03.02.2018 and transfer and posting order dated 05.02.2018,
being violative of the interim order in WP(C) No. 917 of 2017.
[11] Vide common order dated 23.03.2018 in WP(C) No. 156 of 2018, WP(C) No. 164 of 2018 and
WP(C) No. 166 of 2018 and while considering the prayer for interim relief in these petitions, this
Court observed Page 31 that the DPC proceeding held on 03.02.2018 and consequent promotion
and posting orders could not be given effect as the same were issued during the subsistence of
interim order in WP(C) No. 917 of 2017. This Court did not grant any interim order with regard to
prayer for staying MPSC letter dated 07.02.2018 withdrawing the concurrence to the DPC
conducted on 03.02.2018 and leaving the issues raised to be considered at the time of final hearing.
With respect to WP(C) No. 166 of 2018, this Court suspended the DPC proceedings dated
03.02.2018, the promotion order dated 03.02.2018 and posting order dated 05.02.2018 until
further orders. However, the question of validity was kept open for consideration at the time of final
disposal.
[12] These are the brief facts involved in the present case. It may be noted that vide order dated
03.08.2022, WP(C) No. 156 of 2018 was dismissed as infructuous. The prayers in the pending writ

6. Cost of litigation:
[13] Learned counsel for the petitioners in WP(C) No. 917 of 2017 and connected writ
petitions submits that out of 23 direct recruit Assistant Engineers, 22 of them were
appointed on regular basis on 16.09.2014, one was appointed on 16.09.2015; whereas
10 out of the 20 promotees promoted vide DPC proceeding and appointment order
dated 03.02.2018 are their juniors, having been promoted to the post of Assistant
Engineers only on 02.02.2016. It is vehemently argued that the 'failing clause' was
inserted in the recruitment rules of Water Resources Department with a malafide
intention to adjust the promotees alone and the same is in violation of the
fundamental rights of the direct recruits in general and of the petitioners in
particular. It is pointed out that at the level of Assistant Engineer, all the direct
recruits and promotees merge into one unified cadre and lose the 'birth mark' of
being 'direct recruit' and 'promotee'. The learned counsel for the petitioners draws
the attention of this Court to the Schedule-III appended to Page 38 the Recruitment
Rules of 2016 concerning the column prescribing eligibility criteria for promotion to
Executive Engineer/ Surveyor of Works which prescribes the same as 100% by
promotion. In the case of cadre of Assistant Engineer, it is 60% by promotion and
40% by way of direct recruitment. It is the specific case of the petitioners that
bifurcating the common cadre of Assistant Engineer by inserting failing clause for the
purpose of promotion to the post of Executive Engineer is patently illegal and violates
the doctrine of equality enshrined in the Constitution of India. If relaxation in the
tenure in cadre post is to be given to the promotees by inserting 'failing clause' in the
relevant RR, the same benefit ought to be given to the direct recruits who are
similarly placed with the promotees in the same cadre of Assistant Engineer.
[14] On behalf of the petitioners, reliance is placed on the decision of Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Roshan Lal Tandon v. Union of India: AIR 1967 SC
1889 which held that '.... once the direct recruits and promotees are absorbed in one
cadre, they formed one class and they cannot be discriminated for the purpose of
further promotion to the higher Grade C...'. Referring to another decision in the case
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164783826/ 27
Shahid Mohammed Shah vs The State Of Manipur on 30 October, 2023
of State of Jammu & Kashmir v. Triloki Nath Khosa: (1974) 1 SCC 19, it is clarified
that the impediment imposed by Roshan Lal's case for classification is favouring
source of recruitment, but other consideration such as educational qualification can
be considered. Learned counsel for the petitioners draw the attention of this Court to
the case of State of Mysore v. M H Krishna Page 39 Murthy: (1973) 3 SCC 559 holding
that '..... unjustifiable discrimination in a single category, without any reference
either to merit or seniority, or educational qualifications, could justify the differences
in promotional chances. .... Article 14 and 16(1) of the Constitution must be held to be
violated when members of one class are not even considered for promotion. ...'. It is
prayed that the 'failing clauses' inserted by Notifications dated 14.12.2016 and
04.01.2018 giving preference in promotion to the promotees over direct recruits be
set aside and also consequent DPC proceedings dated 03.02.2018, the order dated
03.02.2018 promoting 20 private respondents (promotees Assistant Engineers) to
the post of Executive Engineers and their transfer and posting order 05.02.2018 be
set aside as violation of the provisions of Articles 14 & 16 of the Constitution as held
in the above cited case laws.
[15] In alternative, learned counsel for the petitioners submit that the 'failing clause' was
subsequently deleted from the RR vide Notification dated 17.11.2021 and a new final seniority list
dated 30.07.2021 has been issued. The latest seniority is not challenged till date. Moreover, the
direct recruits and promotees have completed the qualifying regular services of 6 years in case of
Degree holder and 9 years in case of Diploma holder. The reliefs sought in the pending writ
petitions, except for WP(C) No. 78 of 2022, have become infructuous. It is suggested that the writ
petitions may be disposed of with a direction to the authority to hold fresh DPC in terms of the latest
RR and new seniority list.
Page 40 [16] Mr. Lenin Hijam, learned Advocate General appearing on behalf of State respondents,
has raised the question of maintainability of the writ petitions filed by the direct recruits. It is
pointed out that on the date of the filing of the writ petitions in the years 2017 & 2018, the direct
recruits who were appointed in the year 2014 & 2015 did not complete the requisite tenure of 6 years
regular service in the feeder cadre of Assistant Engineer for being considered for promotion to the
post of Executive Engineer. It is submitted that ineligible persons cannot challenge the rules nor
claim relaxation of the eligibility criteria. Reliance is placed on the latest decision in the case of State
of UP v. Vikash Kumar Singh: (2022) 1 SCC 347 which dismissed the original writ petition filed
before the High Court by ineligible employee praying for direction in the nature of mandamus.
[17] Learned Advocate General has explained the object of introducing the 'failing clause' in the
recruitment rules in connection with promotion to the post of Executive Engineer. As per
Schedule-III, an Assistant Engineer with a qualifying regular service is eligible for promotion to the
post of Executive Engineer- (a) in case of Degree holder, 6 years; (b) in case of Diploma holder, 9
years; (c) in case of Diploma holder who passed both Sections A & B of AMIE Examination, 6 years
from the date of passing such examination or 7 years in the grade, whichever is shorter. It is also
stated that there is no quota system for promotion to Executive Engineer and all the Assistant
Engineers are to be considered from a common list. If none is available from any of the categories as
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164783826/ 28
Shahid Mohammed Shah vs The State Of Manipur on 30 October, 2023
mentioned in (a) to (c), promotion Page 41 can be given from those who fall in the 'failing clause'. It
is explained that the 'failing clause' has been introduced to fill up the large number of vacancies in
the cadre of Executive Engineers with special consideration of ongoing projects such as Thoubal
Project, etc. Resort to 'failing clause' will be exercised only when none is found eligible with the
regular service tenure. Keeping in mind all these factors and vide Notification dated 14.12.2016,
State Government introduced for the first time the 'failing clause' for considering Assistant
Engineers possessing at least Diploma with 17 years of regular services in the grades of Assistant
Engineer and Section Officer together out of which 3 years regular service in the grade of Assistant
Engineer. Vide another Notification dated 04.01.2018, as 'one time measure' valid till 31.03.2018 in
the 'failing clause', the 3 years regular service in the grade of Assistant Engineer is further reduced to
2 years. [18] Mr. Lenin Hijam, learned AG further submits that Rule 7(iv) of RR 2016 will not be
applicable in cases covered by 'failing clause', as the said clause is meant for the purpose of 'Future
Maintenance of the Service'. Attention is drawn to the decision in the case of N. Suresh Nathan v.
Union of India: (2010) 5 SCC 692 @ Para 33 wherein Hon'ble Supreme Court upheld the failing
clause of considering Section Officer holding Diploma with 6 years of service in the grade in case of
non-availability of Section Officer holding Degree with 3 years of service in the grade in the 50%
quota earmarked for promotion of Degree holder.
Page 42 [19] Learned AG refers to the decisions of Jaghnath v. Union of India: (1992) Supp (2) SCC
105 & State of U P v. J P Chaurasia:
(1989) 1 SCC 121 to highlight the settled proposition of law that classification based
on the experience is a reasonable classification. It was held that the quality of work
performed by persons of longer experience is superior than the work of the
newcomers. In the present case, it is pointed out that the direct recruits/petitioners
had an experience of only 3 years at the time of filing writ petitions while the
promotees had already more than 20 years of experience.
[20] Learned AG has further cited the case of R Prabha Devi v. Government of India: (1988) 2 SCC
233 to the point that a senior has to be eligible for consideration for promotion and seniority will be
relevant only amongst persons eligible. It is further held that rule making authority is the best judge
in prescribing the eligibility criteria and to amend the rule and no court shall interfere unless it is
shown to be violative of any fundamental right guaranteed to a citizen. Similar finding was held in
the case of P U Joshi v. Accountant General, Ahmedabad: (2003) 2 SCC 632. Reference is made to
the decision in the case of Ashok Kumar Uppal v. State of J&K: (1998) 4 SCC 179 which held that the
Government can exercise the power to relax the Rules in all those cases in which hardship is caused
in the implementation of those Rules to meet a particular situation or where injustice has been
caused to either individual employee or class of employees. It is submitted that the promotees are
long and genuine sufferers Page 43 whose services were stagnant for a considerable period of time in
the grade of Section Officer for the period ranging from 18 to 37 years due to various reasons such as
litigations, etc. Most of them were on the verge of retirement at the relevant time and now only 6 of
them are now in service. In fact, 'failing clause' may be considered as a last compensation for their
long suffering due to fault not attributable to them. If the 'failing clause' is quashed by this Court,
their loss cannot be compensated. It is submitted that the introduction of 'failing clause' is valid in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164783826/ 29
Shahid Mohammed Shah vs The State Of Manipur on 30 October, 2023
terms of the decisions cited above. The available vacancies are sufficient to adjust the direct recruits
and remaining promotees as per the new RR. It is prayed that the writ petitions challenging the
'failing clauses' be dismissed as not maintainable as well on merit.
[21] Mr. HS Paonam, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of some of the private
respondents/promotees adopts the submission of learned AG. He further points out that the present
RR has been adopted from the RR of PWD. The parent RR of PWD has not been challenged and
many promotions have been made in the PWD. In case the 'failing clauses' are set aside by this
Court, many confusions may happen. It is pointed out that 'failing clause' is to be resorted only when
none is found eligible under the normal criteria. The ineligible Assistant Engineers, whether direct
recruits or promotees, can be considered when they become eligible. It is prayed that the writ
petitions challenging the vires of 'failing clause' be dismissed being devoid of any merit.
Page 44 [22] Mr. S. Biswajit, learned senior counsel appearing for some of private
respondents/promotees has raised the preliminary objection to the maintainability of writ petitions
as the petitioners/direct recruits were not eligible for considering for promotion in the year 2017 &
2018. He refers to the case law of B Srinivasa Reddy v. Karnataka Urban Water Supply & Drainage
Board Employees Association: (2006) 11 SCC 731 (II) which held that writ of certiorari can be
exercised at the instance of the person who is qualified to the post and who is a candidate for the
post and ineligible person cannot challenge the appointment made. Referring to the decisions
reported as (1983) 3 SCC 601, it is submitted that to meet the exigencies of service, Government can
promote employees who have sufficient experience to the satisfaction of the authority. It is pointed
out that the policy of one-time relaxation in absence of eligible candidates, falls within the exclusive
domain of the executive/legislature and court ought not to interfere in the policy matter of service
rules as held in (2008) 2 SCC 750. It is stated that the promotees should not be made to suffer due
to interim order as held in (1997) 1 SCC 111. It is submitted that this Court declined to interfere with
the new service rule of Manipur Education Service Rules, 2012 vide judgment/order dated
02.02.2018 in WP(C) No. 974 of 2014. It is prayed that the writ petitions challenging the validity of
'failing clause' be dismissed.
[23] Mr. E. Premjit, learned counsel for the some of the private respondents and for the petitioners
in WP(C) No. 164 of 2018 submits that Page 45 the 'failing clause' will be resorted to only when
eligible candidates as per normal rule are not available. If sufficient number of eligible persons are
available, the impugned clause will not be applicable. In other words, the 'failing clause' does not
discriminate the interest of any employee whether belonging to direct recruits or promotees.
Learned counsel relies on the decisions in the cases of Ganga Ram v. Union of India: (1970) 1 SCC
377 and State of Gujarat v. C G Desai: (1974) 1 SCC 188 to highlight the point that direct recruits and
promotees constitute different classes and such classification is reasonable to the touchstone of
reasonableness under Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. He further refers to the cases of
Raghunath Prasad Singh v. Secretary Home: (1988) Supp SCC 519, State of Tripura v. K K Roy:
(2004) 9 SCC 65 & A Satyanarayana v. S Purushotam: (2008) 5 SCC 416 for necessity of providing at
least two promotional avenues to the employees during their whole service tenures. It is pointed out
that the promotees do not have enough promotional opportunity and they were stagnant at the stage
of entry level for a considerable period of time for more than 20 years. It is submitted that the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164783826/ 30
Shahid Mohammed Shah vs The State Of Manipur on 30 October, 2023
'failing clause' was introduced keeping in mind all these factors and the same cannot be alleged to be
violative of the principles embodied in Articles 14 & 16 of the Constitution. Mr. E. Premjit, learned
counsel adopts the submission of learned AG and prays for dismissing the writ petition challenging
the 'failing clause' and for granting the benefit of the DPC proceedings dated 03.02.2018 and
promotion order dated 03.02.2018, as the interim order in Page 46 WP(C) No. 917 of 2017 will not
be effective on the dismissal of the main petition.
[24] Learned counsel appearing on behalf of MPSC have also adopted the submissions of learned
Advocate General with respect to the question of validity of the 'failing clause'.
[25] We have considered the rival submissions made at bar, the materials on record and the relevant
law in this regard. On perusal of Schedule-III appended to the Rules of 2016 as adopted in the Water
Resources Department, it is seen that the nature of appointment to the post of Executive Engineer is
100% by promotion from the feeder cadre of Assistant Engineer which regular service tenure of 6
years for Degree holder, 9 years for Diploma holder and 6 or 7 years for Diploma holder who passes
both Section A & B of AMIE. It is also admitted fact there is no sub-quota for Degree holder,
Diploma holder or AMIE passed Assistant Engineers and all such officers are to be considered
subject to the satisfaction of fulfilling the eligibility criteria as mentioned therein. Only when eligible
persons with the requisite service tenure as stated above are not available, the 'failing clause' will
apply. In the impugned clause, experience is the only consideration and not the source of
recruitment. This clause has been introduced to fill up the large number of vacancies existing in the
grade of Executive Engineer and such an exercise was required for completion of pending major
projects in the State such as Thoubal Project, etc. 'Failing Clause' cannot be resorted to at the first
instance when eligible persons are available. It is only a stop gap Page 47 arrangement to tide up the
actute vacancy situation in the department. Another object is to grant at least a chance of
promotional avenue to the long sufferers promotees who are stagnant for a long time in the initial
post a long time, even more than 20 years without any promotion due to varios factors such as
litigations, etc. The only consideration in the 'failing clause' is experience in the service.
[26] In the present cases, when the writ petitions were filed in the years 2017 & 2018, the writ
petitioners/direct recruit Assistant Engineers had only 3 years of regular service and as such they
did not complete the minimum requirement of 6 years of tenure as prescribed by RR. We find merit
in the submissions of learned AG as well as of Mr. S. Biswajit, learned senior counsel for the private
respondents that the writ petitions praying directions in the nature of mandamus and certiorari filed
by ineligible candidates are not maintainable. In the case of Umakant Saran v. State of Bihar: (1973)
1 SCC 485, Hon'ble Supreme Court held that a person who is not eligible for consideration for
appointment at the relevant point of time has no right to question the appointments made under the
rule, since he is not an aggrieved person. We are of the view that the writ petitions challenging the
vires of the 'failing clause' are not maintainable as the petitioners/direct recruits were not eligible at
the relevant time for considering for promotion as they did not have requisite service tenure of 6
years as prescribed by the rules.
Page 48 [27] The main contention of the petitioners is that the homogenous group of Assistant
Engineers cannot be bifurcated for the purpose of promotion into direct recruits and promotees, as
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164783826/ 31
Shahid Mohammed Shah vs The State Of Manipur on 30 October, 2023
they lost their 'birth marks' when all of them are appointed to the post of Assistant Engineers by way
of direct recruitment and/or on promotion. It is vehemently argued that preferring only promotees
in the 'failing clause' is in violation of doctrine of equality as referred in the cases cited before this
Court. [28] On the face of it, this submission is attractive, but on close scrutiny it lacks force. In the
cases cited by the petitioners themselves, such as, Roshan Lal (supra), Trilok Nath (supra) and
Krishna Murthy (supra), Hon'ble Supreme Court held that classification based on source of
recruitment cannot be used for further promotion, but it was held that qualification, experience, etc.
are sources of reasonable classification. In the cases of Suresh Nathan (supra) and Jaganath (supra),
Hon'ble Supreme Court further held that experience can be a basis for valid classification. We are of
the considered opinion that experience of 17 years prescribed in the impugned 'failing clauses'
introduced by Notifications dated 14.12.2016 and 04.01.2018 are held to be valid classification and
the same do not violate the doctrine of equality as enshrined in Articles 14 & 16 of the Constitution.
[29] Accordingly, writ petitions challenging the vires of 'failing clauses' are dismissed. Other writ
petitions are disposed of as infructuous due to the subsequent developments of deleting the 'failing
clause' and Page 49 publication of new seniority list. WP(C) No. 78 of 2022 is disposed of with a
direction to consider the cases of direct recruits and promotees in terms of the new rule as they have
now completed the requisite tenures in view of law settled by the case of State of Himachal Pradesh
v. Raj Kumar:
(2023) 3 SCC 773.
[30] From case record, it is seen that there are 31 posts in the cadre of Executive Engineer/Surveyor
of Works/Engineers Officers, ie, 20 nos. of Temporary, 7 nos. of Permanent and 4 nos. of
Supernumerary. Due to the interim order, all these posts are lying vacant. 14 Executive Engineers
promoted by DPC proceedings dated 03.02.2018 and promotion order dated 03.02.2018, have
already retired from service and only 6 of them are now in service. The 23 direct recruit-Assistant
Engineers can be considered in the remaining 25 vacant posts of Executive Engineers, after
adjusting the serving 6 Executive Engineers promoted vide DPC proceeding dated 03.02.2018. [31]
Since the writ petition being WP(C) No. 917 of 2017 and connected matters challenging the 'failing
clauses' are dismissed, the interim orders are vacated and merged with the final decision. It is held
in the recent case of State of U P v. Prem Chopra: 2022 Live Law (SC) 378, Hon'ble Supreme Court
held that interim order merges with the final order. We are of the view that the proceedings of DPC
dated 03.20.2018 and promotion order dated 03.02.2018 can be acted upon, as the only
impediment in the form of interim order is now vacated. This is for the fact that the DPC
proceedings and promotion order were conducted/issued as per relevant Page 50 rules and were
kept in abeyance due to the interim order. In other words, the authority had jurisdiction to exercise
this power and the same might only be considered as an irregular proceeding as defined in para 15
of the Constitution Bench judgment in the celebrated case of Uma Devi v. State of Karnataka:
(2006) 4 SCC 1 and such irregular appointment can be regularised. A Constitution Bench of 5
Judges held in the case of State of Gujarat v. Ambica Mills: (1974) 4 SCC 656 held that the 'doctrine
of eclipse' is also applicable to post constitutional law and such law is not void ab initio. Only the
offending part is kept suspended. When the impediment is removed, such law is enforceable. This
principle is followed in the case of Dulare Lodh v. Addl District Judge, Kanpur: AIR 1984 SC 1260.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164783826/ 32
Shahid Mohammed Shah vs The State Of Manipur on 30 October, 2023
Since the DPC proceeding and promotion order were in consonance with the relevant rule, these will
be effective when the interim orders are vacated. It is also clarified that vide order dated 23.03.2018
in WP(C) No. 166 of 2018, this Court only kept in suspension the DPC proceedings dated
03.02.2018 and consequent promotion order dated 03.02.2018 leaving the rest for deciding on
merit at the time final order. On vacation of the interim order upon dismissal of WP(C) No.917 of
2017, the validity and enforceability of such proceeding/order will not be affected on application of
the 'doctrine of eclipse' with respect to post constitutional law to the peculiar facts of the present
case.
Page 51 [32] In terms of the above findings, observations and directions, the writ petitions are
disposed of. No cost.
