JUDGMENT
st 21 February, 2025 SASHIKANTA MISHRA, J. Both these writ applications involve common facts
and law and were therefore, heard together and are being disposed of by this common judgment.
However, for brevity, the facts pleaded in W.P.(C) No. 3217 of 2006 are considered.
INTRODUCTORY FACTS
2. The erstwhile Odisha State Electricity Board (OSEB) owned a power station in Talcher, presently
in the district of Angul, called Talcher Thermal Power Station (TTPS). Since TTPS, for various
reasons could not operate at the optimum level resulting in loss in generation of electricity and as
neither the OSEB nor the State Government were in a position to provide additional funds necessary
to achieve optimum production, the State legislature enacted the Talcher Thermal Power Station
(Acquisition and Transfer) Act, 1994 (in short '1994 Act") for taking over the power station by
National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), a wholly owned Government of India undertaking.
Said Act came into force w.e.f. 18.05.1995 being published in the Odisha Gazette. As per the
provisions of the 1994 Act, the right, title and interest of the OSEB in relation to TTPS was vested in
the State Government. Thereafter, the State Government vested the power station with NTPC free
from all encumbrances as per Section 5 of the 1994 Act w.e.f. 03.06.1995. The modalities of transfer
of the employees of OSEB (TTPS) to the Corporation, security of their tenure, protection of their
status etc. were governed by different provisions of the 1994 Act, particularly Sections, 10, 11 & 13
thereof. As such, about 1500 employees of the erstwhile OSEB working in TTPS were taken over by
NTPC pursuant to the 1994 Act. They became the regular employees of the NTPC without any break.
3. OSEB also owned and ran three schools being Talcher Thermal High School, Talcher Thermal
Model Primary School and Talcher Thermal Sector-IV Primary School. All the three Schools were
also transferred to NTPC by virtue of the 1994 Act with effect from 03.06.1995. By letter dated
03.07.1995, the Chief Personnel Manager, NTPC issued a letter to the Headmasters of the three
schools indicating the transfer of said schools to NTPC. CASE OF THE PETITIONERS
4. The petitioners in W.P.(C) No.11200 of 2005 were working as Asst. Teachers in Talcher Thermal
High School. The two petitioners in W.P.(C) No.3217 of 2006 were working as Trained Graduate
Teacher and Matric CT Teacher respectively in Talcher Thermal High School. Though strictly not
workmen yet they were treated at par with different categories of workmen by the management of
OSEB such as, Highly Skilled, Supervisory and Skilled-B etc. Their services were also taken over by
NTPC as per the 1994 Act.
5. By an office order dated 02.09.1998, the age of retirement of the employees of NTPC was
enhanced to 60 years. The retirement age of the employees of the power station was 58 years. But in
view of the aforementioned office order, they were also eligible to work till 60 years.
6. The petitioners believe that they were treated unequally as compared to the other taken over
employees and the direct employees of NTPC in the matter of wages, allowances and other service
conditions. They voiced such discontent before the management claiming equal treatment.

Saudamini Swain And Another vs State Of Orissa And Others ....... Opp. ... on 21 February, 2025
However, NTPC entered into a bipartite understanding with one of the six trade unions operating in
the power station on 20.08.1998, which ultimately became a tripartite settlement under the
Industrial Disputes Act. Subsequent to such settlement, an office order was issued on
20/22.08.1998 calling upon the taken over employees to give their option for coming over to the
NTPC Pay Scale. The petitioners being Teachers were excluded from the said order. Clause-2.8 of
the said order provided that revised pay structure and allowance of GRIDCO as notified by
Notification dated 21.04.1998 shall be extended to all teaching staff w.e.f. 03.06.1995.
7. Feeling aggrieved, the present petitioners and some other teachers approached this Court in OJC
No.13155 of 1998. Said writ petition was disposed of on 05.03.1999 by directing NTPC to frame
separate rules and regulations for the teaching staff of the Schools taken over by it as per the 1994
Act. A division Bench of this Court, inter alia, issued the following directions:
"In view of the aforesaid position we direct that necessary rules and regulations be
framed by NTPC keeping in view of the prescription in Section-11 of the 1994 Act as
accepted in the Counter Affidavit filed by it. Such action be taken within three
months from today."
8. The above direction was not complied with by NTPC for which a contempt application was filed
(OCRMC No.95 of 2000), which was disposed of granting eight weeks' time to the NTPC for
compliance. Again another contempt petition was filed (OCRMC No.103 of 2002). At this stage,
NTPC filed an additional affidavit in the contempt proceeding on 06.12.2004 enclosing an office
order dated 03.12.2004 regarding proposed rules and regulations of the teaching staff absorbed as
employees of NTPC pursuant to the 1994 Act. Said office order dated 03.12.2004 is enclosed as
Annexure-4 to the writ application.
9. In view of such development, the contempt proceeding was dropped inter alia, with the following
observations:
"Orl.Crl.Misc.Case No.103 OF 2002 Xxxx xxxxx xxxx Xxxx xxxx xxxx
5. The petitioners, if aggrieved by the fixation of scales of pay and other conditions,
are entitled to challenge or agitate the same in a separate proceeding or may move
the Management for the purpose, but the same cannot be considered in the present
contempt application. However, we feel that the points urged on behalf of the
petitioners need proper consideration by the Management.
6. In that view of the matter, we are of the considered opinion that there is no wilful
or deliberate violation of this Court's order, as alleged. However, while dropping the
contempt proceeding we observe that in the event the petitioners raise their
grievance with regard to fixation and parity of their scale of pay by way of a
representation, the Management should consider the same in its proper perspective.

[Emphasis added]
10. According to the petitioners, the office order dated 03.12.2004 is not in conformity with the
direction issued by the Division Bench in the earlier writ application and is nothing but an eyewash
inasmuch as, if the same is given effect to, it would amount to granting less favourable benefits than
what the petitioners were receiving or were entitled to receive as on 03.06.1995. By letter dated
14/15.01.2005, the Chief Manager (HR) intimated the Headmaster of Talcher Thermal High School
that the petitioners will be paid salary through DAV CMC management and will be under
administrative control of DAV management. The petitioners, unable to accept such offer, submitted
a joint representation to the Management on 14.02.2005 along with a tabular statement showing
their conditions of service, followed by a reminder on 02.03.2005.
11. In response, the General Manager of NTPC, vide letter dated 29/30.03.2005, (copy enclosed as
Annexure-7) informed that the revised conditions of service of the teaching staff framed on
03.12.2004 is being re-examined. Ultimately, by letter dated 25/23.05.2005 (copy enclosed as
Annexure-
8), the General Manager of NTPC, inter alia, informed that there is no cadre of teachers in NTPC
and therefore, in order to give an opportunity to the teachers to be redeployed in NTPC pay and
benefit structure, they were required to exercise option for being deployed in the post of
Stenographer subject to acquiring typing and shorthand speed as applicable to Stenographers of
NTPC and qualifying in the test to be conducted for the same. Significantly, said communication
contained no reference to the representation dated 14.02.2005. The petitioners, instead of accepting
the offer, submitted another representation on 08.08.2005 to the management to reconsider the
representation dated 14.02.2005 and not to give effect to Annexure-8. However, no action
whatsoever was taken by the management. The petitioners contend that the conduct of NTPC is
contrary to their own undertaking given before this Court in the earlier writ application as also the
observations of this Court. Furthermore, they have been made inferior to even Class-IV employees
of the School in the matter of pay scales. As such, the petitioners in both the cases have preferred
these writ applications with the following common prayers:
(i) To quash the office order dated 03.12.2004 (Annexure-4) and letter dated
25/23.05.2005 (Annexure-8);
(ii) To direct NTPC to absorb the petitioners as employees of NTPC w.e.f. 03.06.1995
and apply the service conditions of NTPC to them; and
(iii) To fit the petitioners in NTPC pay scale basing on the GRIDCO revised scale of
pay as on 02.06.1995.
Thus, the case of the petitioners, in a nutshell, is that in view of the express provision under Section
11 of the 1994 Act they are entitled to be treated as full-fledged employees of the NTPC and granted
all financial and service benefits applicable to its regular employees. CASE OF NTPC
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74476871/ 4
Saudamini Swain And Another vs State Of Orissa And Others ....... Opp. ... on 21 February, 2025
12. The stand taken by NTPC, as can be culled out from the preliminary counter affidavit and
counter affidavit filed in both these cases is that NTPC does not have any system of running Schools
departmentally in any of its projects across the country though as per its policy, it provides for all
infrastructure like building, playground, laboratory etc. The Schools are actually run by reputed
educational institutions. This policy is adopted by NTPC in all of its projects across the country
including taken over projects like UNCHHAR and TANDA in U.P. where the Schools have been
handed over to DAV Educational Society. As per Section 11(1) of 1994 Act and the bipartite
settlement with recognized unions, the service conditions of all workmen, excluding teachers were
changed over to those in NTPC as a package to their advantage. As regards the teaching staff, the
same was to be taken up separately but the petitioners and others approached this Court in OJC No.
13155 of 1998 apprehending discrimination and unfair treatment. Pursuant to direction of this Court
in order dated 05.03.1999, NTPC framed the terms and conditions of the service of the teachers on
09.09.1999 which was duly served upon all teachers including the petitioners.
13. In order to improve the quality of education in the Schools, the management decided to run the
said Schools under the management of DAV CMC vide circular issued on 16/19.06.2000. Said
circular was challenged before this Court in OJC No. 5568 of 2000, which is subjudice but the
circular was acted upon and implemented. NTPC management persuaded the DAV Management to
absorb the teaching staff of the taken over High Schools, which was accepted. NTPC therefore,
offered in writing the option to the petitioners to accept the offer of the DAV failing which they
would be treated as surplus and would have to be terminated from service. The DAV management
offered to pay the total emoluments (Basic Pay + DA) to the teachers on the condition that the same
shall not be less than the emoluments received by the petitioners.
14. It is the further case of NTPC that the teachers cannot be classified as 'workmen' in terms of the
Industrial Disputes Act. They were offered a package as per circular dated 03.12.2004, which they
did not accept. As such, they cannot claim the benefit of superannuating at the age of 60 years. Said
circular was accepted by 7 teachers and therefore, there is no question of any discrimination. The
petitioners, on their own volition rejected the package offered by NTPC on 03.12.2004. As such, they
are estopped to challenge the same before this Court.
ADDITIONAL FACTS
15. In view of the stand taken by NTPC in its counter affidavit the petitioners have put forth the
following additional facts in their rejoinder and additional affidavit. 13.1 The tripartite settlement
with recognised union cannot prevail over the 1994 Act, which does not provide for classification of
employees and particularly of the teaching staff on the basis of their cadre/grade under their former
employer. Section 11 of the Act clearly provides that the service conditions of the taken over
employees shall not be less favourable to what was available to them prior to the taking over. As
such, the offer given by the DAV management for granting only the basic pay and DA cannot, by any
stretch of imagination, be treated as favourable to the petitioners who were enjoying various
allowances and pension. Moreover, the petitioners were threatened with termination of their
services in case of non-acceptance of such offer. The claim of the petitioners also cannot be rejected
by treating them as non-workmen in view of the fact that they are members of NTPC Power

Saudamini Swain And Another vs State Of Orissa And Others ....... Opp. ... on 21 February, 2025
Workers' Union and were participating in the elections and were also enjoying several benefits
granted to other employees of OSEB/GRIDCO under various settlements entered into by the
management with the Unions. NTPC itself has provided a list of employees including the names of
the teaching staff to the Labour authorities for the purpose of holding secret ballot for electing the
recognized union. The teaching staff have been treated at par with various categories of
employees/workmen such as Semi-Skilled-A, Semi-Skilled-B, Skilled-A etc. The offer given by NTPC
is highly humiliating and arbitrary. In fact, because of such gross discrimination meted out to the
petitioners they are in receipt of salaries and allowances less than that received by even peons and
messengers. SUBMISSIONS
16. Heard Mr. J.K. Rath, learned Senior Counsel along with Mr. B. Mishra, learned counsel for the
petitioners and Mr. A.N. Das, learned counsel appearing for the NTPC.
17. Opening his arguments, Mr. Rath, learned Senior Counsel would submit that the NTPC is guilty
of violating not only the provisions of the 1994 Act but also the specific direction of this Court in
OJC No.1315 of 1998. Mr. Rath would draw attention of this Court to the provisions of the 1994 Act,
particularly to Sections 10 and 11 thereof. Referring to Section 10(1) of the Act, Mr. Rath would
submit that every person, who was a regular employee of the power station, shall, on and from the
appointed day, be deemed to be on deputation with the State Government on the same terms and
conditions as he was employed under the former employer. Sub-Section (2) provides that on the
vesting of the Power Station in NTPC under Section 5, NTPC shall absorb the employees of the
power station and the absorbed employees shall be governed thereafter by the rules and regulations
of NTPC in force from time to time. Mr. Rath further refers to Section 11 of the Act to submit that
every employee of TTPS absorbed in NTPC shall hold office or render service under the NTPC on the
same terms and conditions and with the same rights and privileges as to pension, gratuity, leave and
other matters as were applicable to him immediately before such vesting. It also provides that his
conditions of service can be altered by the NTPC only to his advantage.
18. On such basis, Mr. Rath argues that the petitioners were teachers in schools established by
TTPS. Said schools where duly established under the provisions of the Odisha Education Act being
recognised by the State Government as also by the Board of Secondary Education as educational
institutions. The students of the school were permitted to appear in the Board's examination and
certificates were also issued to the students by the Board. The teachers were appointed by TTPS for
the purpose of functioning and running the school. The pay structure of the teachers was also
finalized with the approval of the educational authorities and as prescribed by the Board. Thus, as
on the date of vesting of the TTPS with NTPC after coming into force of the 1994 Act i.e., on
03.06.1995, the petitioners, who were earlier employees of erstwhile OSEB working under TTPS,
became the taken-over employees of NTPC. In view of Section 11, the petitioners are entitled to be
given the same terms and conditions, rights and privileges as regards pension, gratuity, leave and
other matters as were applicable to them on the date of their vesting.
19. What the NTPC has done in the instant case is that the petitioners were discriminated as
compared to the other employees, inasmuch as they were never given the same service conditions as
were applicable to them at the time of taking over. Elaborating his argument, Mr. Rath, would
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74476871/ 6
Saudamini Swain And Another vs State Of Orissa And Others ....... Opp. ... on 21 February, 2025
submit that the petitioners were entitled to the revised GRIDCO scale as on 02.06.1995 available to
them as per their categorisation into different grades at par with the workmen. The TTPS being
taken over with effect from 03.06.1995, the petitioners became full-fledged employees of NTPC and
their salary and other entitlements ought to have been fixed on the basis of their pay scale and
category as on 02.06.1995. Mr. Rath further argues that instead of offering the same service
conditions, NTPC offered fitment on pre- revised GRIDCO Scale of pay and thereafter on the State
Government pre-revised and revised scales, which is less than their entitlement. When the same was
refused by the petitioners, NTPC offered them DAV scale, which is also less than what they were
entitled to lawfully.
20. Mr. Rath further argues that the teachers including the petitioners were ranked inferior to even
peons, messengers and attendants of the said School by giving them much higher pay scales and
when such fact was brought to the notice of this Court by the petitioners in the contempt proceeding
(OCRMC No. 103 of 2002), NTPC, ostensibly to cover up the same, shunted out such non-teaching
staff of the Schools to various offices/departments of NTPC in the administrative side as per order
dated 05.11.2004 (Annexure-
11). This, according to Mr. Rath shows the vindictive and step-motherly attitude of NTPC towards
the teachers.
21. Ultimately, acting purportedly on their representation, NTPC came out with a humiliating offer
by asking the petitioners to be redeployed as Stenographers for being given the NTPC scale of pay.
Naturally, the petitioners did not accept the offer.
22. Mr. Rath, also argues that the petitioners may not be workmen in the strict sense of the term but
they have been classified as different categories only for the purpose of fitment. Therefore, the stand
taken by NTPC that the teachers not being workmen, the NTPC scale cannot be granted to them is
untenable. Mr. Rath concludes his arguments by submitting that the petitioners are entitled to the
NTPC scale of pay and all other such service conditions as are applicable to the regular employees of
NTPC. This also entails that the age of superannuation of the petitioners ought to have been treated
as 60 years and their initial fitment ought to have been made on the basis of the revised GRIDCO
scale of pay as on 02.06.1995 corresponding to the appropriate category to which they had been
classified by their former employer.
23. Per contra, Mr. A.N. Das would first submit that a memo was filed on behalf of the petitioners on
22.05.2022 abandoning the prayer as at serial No.1. Such prayer being quashment of Annexure-4 is
therefore, no longer available to be granted.
24. On merits, Mr. Das would argue that as many as four offers were given by the NTPC to the
petitioners but they did not accept any of the same. By letter dated 09.09.1999, the teachers were
offered to be fitted from existing OSEB 1990 Pay Scales to the pre-revised scales for teaching staff
under OSRP Rules, 1989 till 31.12.1995 and thereafter, to the OSRP Rules, 1998 w.e.f. 01.01.1996.
But the petitioners did not respond. The situation is therefore, governed by the doctrine of sub
silentio, for which the petitioners are estopped to question the said order. Notwithstanding the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74476871/ 7
Saudamini Swain And Another vs State Of Orissa And Others ....... Opp. ... on 21 February, 2025
above, NTPC sought to make an arrangement with DAV Management for the benefit of the teachers
as it does not have a cadre of teachers. Said offer was also not accepted by the petitioners. As
directed by the Court, NTPC framed service conditions for the teachers by order dated 03.12.2004
offering fitment as per GRIDCO revised Pay Scales but same was also not accepted by the
petitioners. The representations of the petitioners and other group of teachers was duly considered
and in order to arrive at an acceptable arrangement regarding fitment of the teachers in appropriate
grades, the letter dated 23/25.05.2005 was issued offering to redeploy them in the post of
Stenographer subject to their acquiring the required skill and proficiency. This was also not
acceptable to the petitioners. As such, the petitioners are estopped to make any further claim.
25. As regards the allegation regarding violation of the provisions of the Act, Mr. Das would argue
that Section 10 relates to absorption while Section 11 relates to fitment. Fitment is to be made on the
same terms and conditions and rights and privileges as applicable on 02.06.1995. From the offers
given by NTPC it would be amply clear that it performed its part of the obligation which the
petitioners chose not to accept. As on 02.06.1995, the petitioners were getting GRIDCO (OSEB)
Scale and that is what NTPC offered as the basis for their further fitment. Teachers not being
workmen and there being no cadre of teachers in NTPC, there is no other way of effecting a fitment
of the teachers. In fact, 7 out of the 28 teachers accepted the offer, and the others, barring the
petitioners, did not raise any further claim. As regards letter dated 23/25.05.2005, Mr. Das would
submit that it was an honest attempt by NTPC Management to find out a corresponding grade to fit
the teachers in an appropriate scale. As regards the allegation regarding violation of the directions of
this Court in the earlier writ application, Mr. Das would argue that the proposed service conditions
having been framed by NTPC but not being accepted by the petitioners, no further obligation
remains with it.
26. Before highlighting the issues involved in the case it would be proper to deal with the first
contention raised by Mr. A.N. Das, learned counsel for the NTPC that the petitioners in W.P.(C) No.
3217 of 2006 had abandoned their prayer for quashment of Annexure-4 as per memo filed in the
Court on 25.02.2020. Mr. J.K. Rath, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioners on the
other hand would submit that though such a memo was filed by the previous conducting counsel,
yet the same was never acted upon nor any order passed by the Court accepting the same. That
apart, the present counsel engaging him has informed that the petitioners did not wish to press the
said memo.
27. This Court finds that a memo was filed on 25.02.2020 indicating that the petitioners do not want
to press the prayer to set aside Annexure-4 series since the same was never implemented and was
superseded by the revised proposal under Annexure-8. Reference to the order sheet of the case
however, reflects that said memo was never taken note of by the Court nor any order passed in that
regard and particularly in view of the statement of the learned Senior Counsel being instructed by
the counsel for the petitioner, this Court deems it proper to ignore the said memo.
ISSUES FOR DETERMINATION
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74476871/ 8
Saudamini Swain And Another vs State Of Orissa And Others ....... Opp. ... on 21 February, 2025
28. Having regard to the rival contentions, it is evident that the following issues primarily arise for
determination in these writ applications:
(i) Whether the mandate of Section 11 of the 1994 Act was followed in letter and spirit
by the NTPC management?
(ii) Whether the order dated 03.12.2024 (Annexure-4) passed and the subsequent
offers given by the NTPC were in consonance with the direction of this Court in OJC
No. 13155 of 1998 and OCRMC No. 103 of 2002?
(iii) Whether the claim of the petitioners of being discriminated in the matter of grant
of appropriate pay scale and allowances etc. is valid.
(iv) What relief are the petitioners entitled to?
ISSUE NO.(i)
29. This Court has given its anxious consideration to the rival contentions noted above. Simply
stated, according to the petitioners, they are entitled to be fully absorbed and treated as regular
employees of the NTPC and to all financial and service conditions but have been discriminated by
the Management of NTPC in this regard. This, according to the petitioners, violates Section 11 of the
1994 Act. On the other hand, it is the stand of the NTPC that the petitioners being teachers cannot
be treated as workmen within the meaning of Industrial Disputes Act and therefore, the terms and
conditions on which the workmen were absorbed cannot be extended to them. Moreover, NTPC
establishment does not have a cadre of teachers and therefore, the petitioners were offered to be
fitted against appropriate pay scales on the basis of what they were receiving immediately prior to
the date of acquisition of TTPS by NTPC. Four such offers were given but none was acceptable to
them.
30. In view of such opposing contentions it becomes imperative to first refer to certain background
facts at the outset. Admittedly, the petitioners were working as teachers in Schools established by
OSEB for the children of the employees of TTPS. There is no dispute that they were regular
employees of OSEB/TTPS. By virtue of the 1994 Act, TTPS was taken over by NTPC. In this context,
Section 10 of the said Act, being relevant is quoted below.
10. Absorption of employees. (1) Every person who has been, immediately before the appointed day,
a regular employ employee of the Power Station, shall, on and from the appointed day, be deemed to
be on deputation with the State Government on the same terms and conditions, subject to the
provisions contained in sub-section (2). (2) On the vesting of the Power Station in the Corporation
under section 5, the Corporation shall, save as otherwise provided, absorb the employees of the
Board working in the Power Station, in the following manner:-
(a) Subject to the provisions of clauses (b) and (c) of this sub-section and
sub-sections (3) and (4), all the employees on the regular rolls of the Power Station
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74476871/ 9
Saudamini Swain And Another vs State Of Orissa And Others ....... Opp. ... on 21 February, 2025
shall be absorbed in the services of the Corporation who may, with a view to
achieving better productivity and efficiency, redeploy them in Talcher Super Thermal
Power Project or in any other Project or Power Station belonging to them and such
employees absorbed in the services of the Corporation shall be governed by the Rules
and Regulations of the Corporation in force from time to time.
(b) Officers in the rank of Executive Engineer and above, whatever designation they
hold, shall be retained by the Board for deployment in other activities of the Board of
the State Government.
(c) Officers in the rank of Assistant Engineer, whatever designation they hold shall be
kept on deputation with the Corporation, and their absorption in the Corporation or
repatriation to the Board or the State Government shall be regulated in the following
manner:-
(i) twenty-five percentum of them shall be absorbed, in order of their suitability as
may be determined by the Corporation, during the first year of vesting of the Power
Station in the Corporation;
(ii) twenty-five percentum of them shall be repatriated to the Board during the first
year of such vesting for redeployment in the Board or under the State Government
Departments;
(iii) further twenty-five percentum of them shall be absorbed in order of their
suitability as may be determined by the Corporation, during the second and third
years of such vesting (that is 15% in second year and 10% in the third year);
(iv) the remaining twenty-five percentum of the officers shall be repatriated to the
Board during the second and third years of such vesting for redeployment in the
Board or under the State Government Departments.
(3) All Stipendiary Engineers in employment in the Power Station immediately
before the appointed day, shall be retained by the Board.
(4) Notwithstanding anything in the preceding sub-
sections, employees appointed, if any, in the Power Station after the 11th October 1994 shall be
retained by the Board.
[Emphasis added]
31. Thus, on and from the appointed date, all the employees of TTPS were deemed to be on
deputation with the State Government and upon vesting of TTPS with NTPC i.e., on 03.06.1995,
they were absorbed in the services of NTPC to be governed by its rules and regulations. As regards
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74476871/ 10
Saudamini Swain And Another vs State Of Orissa And Others ....... Opp. ... on 21 February, 2025
the terms and conditions of service of such employees, Section 11 is relevant and is quoted below:
"11. Terms and conditions of service of employees of Power Station at to be carried to
their disadvantage.: (1) Every employee of the Power Station absorbed in the
Corporation shall of hold office or render service under the Corporation on the same
terms and conditions and with the same rights and privileges as to pension, gratuity,
leave and other matters, as would have been applicable to him immediately before
such vesting, till his employment under the Corporation is duly terminated or until
his remuneration and other conditions of service as a package are duly altered by the
Corporation to his-advantage.
(2) The financial liabilities of the Board in relation to the employees absorbed by the
Corporation on account of the matters referred to in sub-section (1) for the services
rendered under the Board shall be computed till the date immediately preceding the
date of vesting of the Power Station with the Corporation and the amount shall be
paid to the Corporation as soon as the employees are absorbed."
[Emphasis added]
32. A plain reading of sub-section (1) of Section 11 would show that absorption of the employees of
TTPS in NTPC shall be on the same terms and conditions and with same rights and privileges as to
pension, gratuity, leave and other matters as were applicable to them immediately before such
vesting. The language employed in sub-Section (1) would also indicate that the conditions of service
cannot be altered to disadvantage of the absorbed employees. It therefore, becomes necessary to
know as to what were the service conditions of the absorbed employees immediately prior to the
date of vesting i.e. on 02.06.1995. Admittedly, the petitioners were teachers in different Schools run
by OSEB. It is pertinent to mention that GRID Corporation of Odisha (GRIDCO) after taking over
OSEB, effected a Pay revision for the employees w.e.f. 01.04.1995.
33. The following table reflects the position in detail.

From a conjoint reading of Sections 10 and 11 of the 1994 Act, it follows that the petitioners
(Teachers) were entitled to be fitted to the appropriate scale of NTPC on the basis of the GRIDCO
revised pay scale as on 02.06.1995.
34. Now, what would be appropriate pay scale of NTPC for fitment? In this regard, there appears to
have been a bipartite settlement signed by NTPC with one of the Unions, which was subsequently
held to be a tripartite settlement on 21.08.1988 to decide the fitment of the absorbed employees.
However, the petitioners being teachers were left out from the settlement on the ground that they
are not workmen within the meaning of Industrial Disputes Act. As already stated, it has been the
consistent stand of NTPC that the petitioners are not workmen and hence cannot be equated with
the workmen absorbed in NTPC. It is true that being teachers, the petitioners cannot obviously be
treated as workmen within the meaning of Section 2(s) of the Industrial Disputes Act but then, this
Court finds from the record that apparently for want of a specific cadre in the erstwhile
establishment, the teachers have been treated at par with different categories of workmen. As per
the document enclosed to the rejoinder vide Annexure-18, the OSEB in its 304th meeting held on
25.02.1988, granted TBA Scales for its employees, wherein all the employees were broadly
categorised as workmen with sub-categories such as Unskilled, Semi- Skilled-B, Semi-Skilled- A,
Skilled-C, Skilled-B, Skilled-A, Highly Skilled-B, Highly Skilled-A Supervisory-C and Supervisory-B.
They were further classified as Administrative and Technical. Most significantly, the teachers have
been included under the sub-classification of Administrative in appropriate grades. For instance,
Asst. Teacher is treated as Semi-Skilled-A; Asst. Teacher Matric Trained, Matric Teacher, P.E.T.,
and Head Pandit (U.P. School) have been treated as Skilled-B; Asst. Teacher Trained, I.A. Asst.
Teacher (Arts), Hindi Teacher and Graduate Teacher have been treated as Skilled-A; Sanskrit
Teacher is Highly Skilled-B; Asst. Teacher Trained Graduate is Highly Skilled-A Supervisory 'C'; and
Headmaster is Supervisory-B.
35. It would also be relevant to note that despite not being strictly workmen, the petitioners were
members of trade unions and were participating in elections. In fact, on as many as three occasions
NTPC itself forwarded a list of the members of the union for the purpose of voting, which includes
the names of the petitioners. Having done so, it is not open to the NTPC to reject the claim of the
petitioners on the ground that they were not workmen. From what has been narrated hereinabove, it
is clear that even though the petitioners cannot be treated as workmen strictly yet, they have been
always been treated at par with different categories of workmen obviously for the purpose of fitting
them in appropriate pay scales so as to bring about uniformity. This vital aspect has never been
considered by NTPC resulting in meting out differential treatment to the teachers which is amplified
in the succeeding paragraphs.
36. In the representation dated 14.02.2005, the petitioners have enclosed a comparative statement,
which is extracted below:

37. A bare look at the table would show that in case of a clerk and a peon, the total
emoluments as on 02.06.1995 were Rs.6161/- and Rs.4395/- respectively, whereas,
the total emoluments of the teachers (petitioners) were Rs.6,336/- and Rs.5,614/-
respectively. The same as on January, 2005 went up to Rs.21,922/- and Rs.15,231/-
respectively in case of the clerk and the peon, whereas in so far as the petitioners are concerned, the
same went only up to Rs.12,919/- and Rs.11,468/- respectively. There is thus a substantial difference
in the emoluments of the teachers as compared to the clerks and peons. Not only that, there is
disparity as regards the age of superannuation also inasmuch as while the same is 60 years for the
Clerk and the Peon, it is 58 years for the teachers. Significantly, this averment and comparative
statement has not been specifically denied or disputed by NTPC in its counter.
38. It would be more than evident from the above that discrimination is writ large and tell-tale on
the face of the record.
39. As already stated, despite not being workmen in the strict sense of the term, the teachers have
been treated at par with workmen and categorised accordingly for the purpose of payment of their
salaries and allowances by the erstwhile employer. Had the same been accepted by NTPC, the
petitioners would obviously have been fitted against appropriate grades like the workmen and other
employees, thereby receiving much higher emoluments than what they were actually given.
40. All the petitioners having rendered more than 10 years' service could have been placed in
appropriate grades under NTPC structure as was done in case of workmen as per Clause-2.3.2 of the
tripartite agreement in the following manner.
Sl. No. OSEB Structure NTPC Structure

41. Why such decision was not taken in respect of the teachers, has not been satisfactorily explained
by the NTPC save and except for taking the consistent stand that they are not workmen, which
needless to say, could not have been a valid reason for the gross discrimination meted out to them in
the manner narrated before. This Court is therefore, of the considered view that the mandate of
Section 11 of 1994 Act was not followed in its letter and spirit in case of the petitioners by the NTPC
Management.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74476871/ 14
Saudamini Swain And Another vs State Of Orissa And Others ....... Opp. ... on 21 February, 2025
42. NTPC has basically harped upon two pleas, namely, that the petitioners being teachers are not
workmen and secondly, it does not have a cadre of teachers in its establishment. The first plea has
already been discussed in detail hereinbefore and is rejected as untenable because it is not the case
of the petitioners that they were workmen but the fact that they have always been treated at par with
the workmen was never considered by the NTPC. As to the plea that NTPC does not have a cadre of
teachers, the same is also not worthy of consideration because it is not as if its management was not
aware of the existence of the three schools run by the OSEB and the teachers employed therein
before agreeing to take over TTPS. That apart, the 1994 Act, which is obviously binding on all
concerned, speaks of 'every employee' of TTPS, who as per Section 10 of 1994 Act were absorbed.
Having acted as per the provisions of Section 10 of the Act in absorbing all the employees of TTPS, it
is not open to the NTPC to turn around to complain that it does not have a cadre of teachers. Even
accepting the argument for a moment that it does not have a cadre of teachers, the same is
immaterial if the fundamental fact that the teachers being regular employees of TTPS were always
treated at par with workmen is taken into account. Therefore, irrespective of whether the services of
the teachers are placed under DAV Management or directly under the NTPC administration, the
mandate of Section 11 of the 1994 Act as discussed in detail earlier can never be ignored.
43. It would be worthwhile to refer to some judgments relied upon by Mr. Das to justify the stand of
the NTPC that there is no legal bar in providing different age of superannuation for different
employees of the establishment. Mr. Das has cited the judgments of the Supreme Court in Osmania
University v. V.S. Muthurangam1, K. Nagaraj v. State of A.P.2, and Union of India v. Lieut E.
Iacats3.
44. A reading of the cited decisions reveals that it is legally permissible to maintain different age of
superannuation for different categories of employees in one establishment. The question involved in
the present case is however, entirely different for the reasons indicated below. The employees of
TTPS, without distinction as to categories and grades were taken over by NTPC and as per Section 11
were entitled to be granted same benefits as they were receiving prior to such taking over. This
Court has already held that the petitioners, though teachers were treated at par with workmen by
the former employer. So, if NTPC decided to give the benefit of the enhanced age of superannuation
to the (1997) 10 SCC 741 (1985) 1 SCC 523 (1997) 7 SCC 334 workmen, there was no reason as to
why the same should not have been granted to the teachers. Not doing so amounts to
discrimination, hit by the principle of equality under Article 14 of the Constitution of India. Thus, on
peculiar facts of the case, this Court is of the considered view that cited judgments are not
applicable.
ISSUE NO.-(ii)
45. Coming to the contention that NTPC was also guilty of not complying with the specific direction
of this Court in the earlier writ application, as already stated, this Court taking note of the specific
stand taken by the NTPC in its counter affidavit directed it to frame necessary rules and regulations
keeping in view the prescription under Section 11 of the 1994 Act. In purported compliance of such
direction, NTPC came up with the impugned office order dated 03.12.2004 (Annexure-4) proposing
certain rules and regulations for the teaching staff. As regards pay scale, fixation of pay, annual
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74476871/ 15
Saudamini Swain And Another vs State Of Orissa And Others ....... Opp. ... on 21 February, 2025
increments and DA, the said office order proposed different scales for different categories of
teachers by considering the OSEB pay scale, pay scales under OSRP Rules, 1989 and pay scales
under OSRP Rules, 1998. The revised pay scales of GRIDCO which came into effect from 01.04.1995
was also taken into account, but despite doing so, NTPC proposed to extend the pay scales under
OSRP Rules, 1989 and OSRP Rules, 1998. It is not understood as to why the OSRP Rules was sought
to be applied to the teaching staff when the other employees of TTPS including the non-teaching
staff of the three Schools had been extended the NTPC pay scales. From the comparative statement
given below, it would be apparent that giving effect to the proposed service conditions would have
resulted in reduction of emoluments received by the petitioners.

46. As already stated, this Court, while dropping the contempt proceeding (ORMC No. 103 of 2002)
was of the view that the points urged by the petitioners need proper consideration by the
Management. That apart, it was also observed that in the event the petitioners raise their grievance
with regard to fixation and parity of their scale of pay by way of a representation, the Management
should consider the same in its proper perspective. From what is narrated hereinbefore, this Court is
also of the considered view that the proposed service conditions as per office order dated 03.12.2004
cannot be treated as a full compliance of the direction of this Court being in apparent violation of the
mandate of Section 11 of the Act. It is stated at the cost of repetition that this Court directed the
NTPC management to frame rules in view of the prescription of Seciton-11 of the 1994 Act. So,
essentially compliance of the mandate of Section 11 was the paramount consideration for this Court
while issuing the direction. This Court in OCRMC No. 103 of 2002, granted liberty to the petitioners
to raise their grievance with regard to fixation and parity of their scale of pay by way of
representation with direction to the Management to consider the same in its proper perspective.
Pursuant to such direction, the representation dated 14.02.2005 was submitted by the petitioners.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74476871/ 16
Saudamini Swain And Another vs State Of Orissa And Others ....... Opp. ... on 21 February, 2025
NTPC in its letter dated 29/30.03.2005 informed the petitioners that the revised conditions of
service of the teaching staff is being re- examined. There was no further response in so far as the
representation dated 14.02.2005 is concerned. But surprisingly, acting on a representation
submitted by another group of teachers on 09.02.2005, the General Manager of NTPC, in letter
dated 23/25.05.2005 intimated that their request had been examined keeping in view the judgment
passed by the High Court and the order passed in the contempt proceeding and gave an offer to the
teachers to be redeployed in NTPC pay scale and benefit structure in the post of stenographer at any
unit of NTPC other than TTPS wherever vacancy exists with a condition that such redeployment will
be subject to their acquiring typing and shorthand speed as applicable to Stenographer post in
NTPC and qualifying in the test for the same. The pay scale was fixed at Rs.6700-11750/- in W7
grade. This Court is of the view that having assured the petitioners in its letter dated 29/30.03.2005
to re-examine the revised conditions of service of the teaching staff framed on 03.12.2004, it was
obviously not open to the Management to come up with such an offer that had no bearing
whatsoever with the service conditions framed on 03.12.2004. By letter dated 06.08.2005, the
petitioners rightly refused to accept such offer.
47. Before going further into the above aspect it would be apposite at this stage to mention that
according to learned counsel appearing for NTPC, as many as four offers were given to the
petitioners regarding their fitment and placement in appropriate grades purportedly in consonance
with the mandate of Section 11. By letter dated 09.09.1999, the petitioners were informed that as on
03.06.1995 they shall be fitted from the existing OSEB 1990 pay scale to the pre revised scales of pay
for teaching staff under OSRP Rules, 1989 till 31.12.1995 and thereafter, the revised scales of pay for
teaching staff of Odisha Government w.e.f. 01.01.1996 with full revision benefits shall be granted.
The teachers did not accept the offer though no communication in this regard was made by them. By
office order dated 19.06.2000, the Management informed that the taken-over Schools were decided
to be run under the Management of DAV, CMC. Accordingly, offer letters were issued by the DAV
Management in June, 2002 indicating that their total emoluments (Basic Pay +DA) shall not be less
than their present emoluments (Basic Pay + DA). There was no response from the petitioners. The
third offer is the order dated 03.12.2004 (Annexure-4) proposing the service conditions, which has
already been discussed hereinbefore. The fourth and final offer of the NTPC is letter dated
23/25.05.2005 (Annexure-8), which has also been discussed hereinbefore.
As already stated, this Court has found that none of the offers extended to the petitioners was in
conformity with the mandate of Section 11 of the 1994 Act rather, were disadvantageous to them.
Therefore, this Court is of further view that non-acceptance of such offers cannot act as estoppel.
48. The final offer vide letter dated 23/25.05.2005 needs special mention. Teachers were asked to
become Stenographers! Persons, who had rendered decades of service as teachers, were asked to get
themselves trained to acquire proficiency, pass the qualifying test and be redeployed as
Stenographers in other units of NTPC. For one, the offer is, on the face of it, humiliating as rightly
contended by learned counsel for the petitioners. Secondly, this Court has not found anything to
suggest that there was any legal impediment in treating the petitioners at par with other employees,
including the non-teaching staff of the School, who were taken on NTPC Pay Scale and benefit
structure. Thirdly, it was given out that in case the petitioners did not opt for fitment in NTPC pay
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74476871/ 17
Saudamini Swain And Another vs State Of Orissa And Others ....... Opp. ... on 21 February, 2025
scale and benefit structure as offered, they shall continue in the existing pay scale and benefit
structure. The choice thus, given to the petitioners was nothing but a 'Hobson's Choice', meaning, no
choice. Viewed plainly, the petitioners/teachers, being already treated at par with different
categories of workmen, could have been fitted in appropriate pay scales of NTPC like the workmen
and other taken over employees of TTPS. The fact that NTPC does not have a cadre of teachers in its
establishment is immaterial inasmuch as on its own admission, the Management of the Schools
owned by NTPC is entrusted to DAV, CMC. In such event, the teachers working under Management
of DAV could also have been granted NTPC scale of pay.
49. It is well settled that an unfair or unreasonable contract cannot be endorsed by the Court.
Moreover on the face of unequal bargaining power of the parties the above principle becomes all the
more relevant. This proposition was highlighted by the Supreme Court in the case of the Central
Inland Water Transport Corporation Ltd, v. Brojo Nath Ganguly and Anr4, in the following words.
"88. As seen above, apart from judicial decisions, the United States and the United
Kingdom have statutorily recognised, at least in certain areas of the law of contracts,
that there can be unreasonableness (or lack of fairness, if one prefers that phrase) in
a contract or a clause in a contract where there is inequality of bargaining power
between the parties although arising out of circumstances not within their control or
as a result of situations not of their creation. Other legal systems also permit judicial
review of a contractual transaction entered into in similar circumstances. For
example, Section 138(2) of the German Civil Code provides that a transaction is void
(1986) 3 SCC 156 "when a person" exploits "the distressed situation, inexperience,
lack of judgmental ability, or grave weakness of will of another to obtain the grant or
promise of pecuniary advantages ... which are obviously disproportionate to the
performance given in return". The position according to the French law is very much
the same.
89. Should then our courts not advance with the times? Should they still continue to
cling to outmoded concepts and outworn ideologies? Should we not adjust our
thinking caps to match the fashion of the day? Should all jurisprudential
development pass us by, leaving us floundering in the sloughs of 19th century
theories? Should the strong be permitted to push the weak to the wall? Should they
be allowed to ride roughshod over the weak? Should the courts sit back and watch
supinely while the strong trample underfoot the rights of the weak? We have a
Constitution for our country. Our judges are bound by their oath to "uphold the
Constitution and the laws".
The Constitution was enacted to secure to all the citizens of this country social and economic justice.
Article 14 of the Constitution guarantees to all persons equality before the law and the equal
protection of the laws. The principle deducible from the above discussions on this part of the case is
in consonance with right and reason, intended to secure social and economic justice and conforms
to the mandate of the great equality clause in Article 14. This principle is that the courts will not
enforce and will, when called upon to do so, strike down an unfair and unreasonable contract, or an
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74476871/ 18
Saudamini Swain And Another vs State Of Orissa And Others ....... Opp. ... on 21 February, 2025
unfair and unreasonable clause in a contract, entered into between parties who are not equal in
bargaining power. It is difficult to give an exhaustive list of all bargains of this type. No court can
visualize the different situations which can arise in the affairs of men. One can only attempt to give
some illustrations. For instance, the above principle will apply where the inequality of bargaining
power is the result of the great disparity in the economic strength of the contracting parties. It will
apply where the inequality is the result of circumstances, whether of the creation of the parties or
not. It will apply to situations in which the weaker party is in a position in which he can obtain goods
or services or means of livelihood only upon the terms imposed by the stronger party or go without
them. It will also apply where a man has no choice, or rather no meaningful choice, but to give his
assent to a contract or to sign on the dotted line in a prescribed or standard form or to accept a set of
rules as part of the contract, however unfair, unreasonable and unconscionable a clause in that
contract or form or rules may be. This principle, however, will not apply where the bargaining power
of the contracting parties is equal or almost equal. This principle may not apply where both parties
are businessmen and the contract is a commercial transaction. In today's complex world of giant
corporations with their vast infrastructural organizations and with the State through its
instrumentalities and agencies entering into almost every branch of industry and commerce, there
can be myriad situations which result in unfair and unreasonable bargains between parties
possessing wholly disproportionate and unequal bargaining power. These cases can neither be
enumerated nor fully illustrated. The court must judge each case on its own facts and
circumstances."
It is not unreasonable to suppose that the 7 teachers, who are said to have accepted the above offer,
may have succumbed to pressure having perhaps realised their inability to put up a fight against the
mighty management, which the present petitioners have attempted. In the case of Chairman and
MD NTPC Ltd. v. Reshmi Construction, Builders and Contractors5, Supreme Court referring to
maxim 'Necessitas Non Habet Legem' observed as follows-
(2004) 2 SCC 663 "Further, necessitas non habet legem is an old age maxim which means necessity
knows no law. A person may sometimes have to succumb to the pressure of other party to the
bargain who is on a stronger position."
In this context it would be apposite to state that NTPC, being a Public Sector Undertaking (PSU)
under the Government of India, can also be treated as a functionary of the State. As such, the
obligation cast upon the State to act as a model employer can also be extended to a PSU like NTPC.
In other words, as a model employer, NTPC has a social obligation to treat its employees in such
manner that no employee feels left out from the benefits extended to other employees.
50. The Supreme Court expressed the above sentiment in its judgment in the case of Bhupendra
Nath Hazarika and another v. State of Assam and others6 in the following words-
61. Before parting with the case, we are compelled to reiterate the oft stated principle that the State
is a model employer and it is required to act fairly giving due regard and respect to the rules framed
by it. But in the present case, the State has atrophied the rules. Hence, the need for hammering the
concept.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74476871/ 19
Saudamini Swain And Another vs State Of Orissa And Others ....... Opp. ... on 21 February, 2025
62. Almost a quarter century back, this Court in Balram Gupta v. Union of India [1987 Supp SCC
(2013) 2 SCC 516 228 : 1988 SCC (L&S) 126 : (1987) 5 ATC 246] had observed thus : (SCC p. 236,
para 13) "13. ... As a model employer the Government must conduct itself with high probity and
candour with its employees.
xx xx xx"
51. Therefore the argument that seven of the teachers accepted the offer dated 23/25.05.2005 does
not necessarily make it a valid or acceptable offer for all. ISSUE NO.(iii) In the preceding
paragraphs it was mentioned that the petitioners were treated at par with different categories of
workmen by the erstwhile employer being sub-classified as Administrative Grade. An office order
was issued by NTPC on 21/22.08.1998 providing pay scales, allowances, benefits and other terms
and conditions of service of workmen on the regular rules of TTPS absorbed in NTPC. This was
evidently on the basis of the so called tripartite settlement entered into by the Management with the
concerned trade union. Clause- 2.2 provides the equivalence of grades in workmen category between
OSEB pay scales and NTPC pay scales as on the date of absorption in the following tabular form.

52. Clause- 2.3.1 provides for the placement in the equivalent grade of workmen who had not
completed ten years of service as on the date of absorption, while clause 2.3.2 provided for the same
for the workmen who had completed ten years of service. Same being relevant for the present case,
is quoted hereinbelow:
2.3.1 All workmen who have not completed 10 years of service in their existing grade
as on 03.06.95 (4 years in case of ITI qualified workmen in their respective trade)
will be placed in equivalent grade as per the table at 2.2. above w.e.f. 03.06.1995. On

placement they will be redesignated as per corresponding designation existing in
NTPC structure.
2.3.2 The workmen who have completed 10 years of service or more in existing grade
and payscale as on 03.06.95 (4 years or more in respect of ITI qualified workmen in
their respective trade) will be placed in the next higher grade in NTPC w.e.f.
03.06.1995 as under. The corresponding pay scales will be as stated in para 2.2.
above."
53. The petitioners have attempted to show that the persons placed in the same grade
under the erstwhile employer were given higher pay scales as compared to them.
In particular, a comparison is sought to be made between one Rabinarayan Barik, who was working
as Junior Grade Typist and Lambodar Pradhan (petitioner No.2 in W.P.(C) No. 3217 of 2006). Both
were on the pay scale Rs.4020-115- 4595-125-5220-135-7380. The pay of both as on 01.04.1995 was
fixed at Rs.5220/-by the GRIDCO in view of the pay revision effected on 23.07.1998. It would be
useful at this stage to refer once again to the classification made by the erstwhile OSEB vide order
dated 14.04.1988 regarding time bound advancement pay scales of its employees i.e., Annexure-18.
What is relevant to note is that both the Junior Grade Typist as well as Asst. Teacher (Matric
Trained) were categorised as Skilled-B with the sub-classification- Administrative. Petitioners have
relied upon the pay slip of said Rabinarayan Barik as well as Lambodar Pradhan for the month of
January, 2011. Rabinarayan Barik has been described as W-9 with his total emoluments being
Rs.68,852.20. Lambodar Pradhan, on the other hand, has been described as Highly Skilled-B with
his total emoluments being Rs.30,210/-. Thus, while both the employees were in receipt of same
emoluments under the erstwhile employer, the same was materially altered upon their absorption in
NTPC so much so that the emoluments of Rabinarayan Barik became more than double of that of
Lambodar Pradhan. The above fact being brought on record by the petitioners in the additional
affidavit filed in the case, the NTPC in its reply affidavit has stated as follows:
"7.0. In reply to paragraph 6 the deponent most humbly says and submits and adopts
the submissions in the paragraphs herein above. R.N. Barik, Junior Steno Typist was
changed to NTPC pay & benefit structure, etc., in terms of the tripartite settlement
dated 20.08.1998 under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. Accordingly, he has been
drawing salary under the NTPC pay & benefit structure w.e.f. 03.06.1995. The
petitioner and other teachers being not covered under the tripartite settlement dated
20.08.1998 and having on their own volition and choice not opted and accepted the
NTPC pay & benefit, etc are estopped in law from raising any grievance. The
petitioner continuing under the revised GRIDCO structure cannot therefore compare
with the salary drawn by R.N.Barik under the NTPC structure. The OPs adopt the
submissions in the above paragraphs and the same are not reiterated for the sake of
brevity and convenience."
54. In essence, according to NTPC, the petitioners not being workmen were not covered under the
tripartite settlement dated 20.08.1998 and not having accepted the offers given by NTPC cannot
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74476871/ 21
Saudamini Swain And Another vs State Of Orissa And Others ....... Opp. ... on 21 February, 2025
compare themselves with the salary drawn by Rabinarayan Barik under the NTPC structure. The
above plea can be considered only to be rejected for the following reasons:
Firstly, Section 11 of the 1994 Act does not make any distinction between workmen
and non-workmen but speaks of 'every employee' of the Power Station absorbed in
the Corporation.
Secondly, the provision mandates that such employee shall hold office or render
service under the Corporation on the same terms and conditions as would have been
applicable to him immediately before such vesting. So, the action of NTPC in picking
up only a section of employees of TTPS, even if they are in majority, and fitting them
to its pay structure under the so called tripartite agreement but offering the
remaining employees unacceptable offers of fitment to their disadvantage is certainly
not what is intended by Section 11.
Thirdly, there is no provision in the 1994 Act permitting NTPC to segregate the
employees of TTPS into different categories.
Finally, this Court is unable to accept that the so-
called offers given by NTPC were worthy of acceptance in the first place so that
refusal of the petitioners to accept them would estopp them from laying a valid claim.
55. Thus, the mandate of Section 11 was to maintain the status as existing immediately prior to the
date of vesting. This is where NTPC appears to have gone beyond the provisions of the 1994 Act by
entering into separate agreement for the workmen category of employees. Be that as it may, it was
still imperative for NTPC to have accepted the status of the other employees as existing immediately
prior to the date of vesting. Viewed thus, the status of teachers of being at par with different
categories of workmen with corresponding pay scales ought to have been accepted as the foundation
for their further fitment in NTPC pay scale but by treating them otherwise, the terms and conditions
on which the teachers were employed under the previous employer was never maintained.
56. Much has been argued with regard to the effect of the non-acceptance by the teachers of the four
offers given by the NTPC from time to time. The law of estoppel has been invoked in this respect.
Law is well settled that there can be no estoppel in case of a contract between two unequals. In the
instant case, teachers were pitted against the mighty NTPC and therefore, had practically no
bargaining power unlike the workmen who were represented by the trade unions resulting in a
much favour fitment for them as per the terms of the tripartite settlement. The teachers however,
despite being members of the trade union, were not made parties to the settlement.
57. From what has been narrated hereinbefore, this Court is left with no doubt that the claim of the
petitioners of being discriminated in the matter of grant of appropriate pay scales and allowances is
valid.

ISSUE NO.(iv)
58. Having held thus, this Court would now proceed to examine as to what relief can be granted to
the petitioners. Since the petitioners were treated at par with different categories of workmen prior
to vesting, there is no other option open to NTPC than to treat them as such in view of the provision
under Section 11 of the 1994 Act. This would entail firstly, ascertaining the appropriate grade in
which they were fitted in the former establishment and the equivalent grade under NTPC structure
to be extended to them. To illustrate, petitioner No.1 in W.P.(C) No. 3217 of 2006, Sibamohan
Senapati being a Trained Graduate Teacher was treated at par with Highly Skilled- A/Supervisory-C
category. As per the equivalence of grades effected for workmen (having more than 10 years of
service) the equivalent grade under NTPC structure is W-10 in the pay scale of
Rs.2865-115-4015-125-5265. Similarly, petitioner No.2 in W.P.(C) No.3217 of 2006, Lambodar
Pradhan, being Matric CT Asst. Teacher, was treated at par with Skilled-B category. So, the
equivalent grade under NTPC structure is W-5 in the Pay Scale of Rs.2350-70-2840-80- 3880. On
such basis the Basic Pay, DA, VDA and other allowance need to be worked out right from the date of
absorption i.e. 03.06.1995.
59. As regards the date of superannuation, it is to be noted that once the petitioners are absorbed in
NTPC then as per Section 11 of the 1994 Act, they are entitled to be governed by the Rules and
Regulations of NTPC. As already indicated, by Memo dated 02.09.1998, the Manager (Pers.)
clarified that 'For the purpose of any rule of NTPC where age of retirement is required, to be
considered, the age shall be reckoned as 60 years'. Therefore, the petitioners, having been absorbed
in NTPC are eligible to be superannuated on attaining the age of 60 years. It is borne out from the
pleadings and materials on record that the 7 teachers, who had accepted the offer dated
25/23.05.2005, were allowed to superannuate at 60 years. Most surprisingly however, the
petitioners were superannuated at the age of 58 years evidently because they had not accepted the
above mentioned offer. So, even though they became full-fledged employees of NTPC not only that
they were never given NTPC pay scales but also were made to retire from service at a different age. It
resulted in having two different ages of superannuation for the employees of one organization,
which is hardly conscionable in law. Be it noted that challenging the letters issued by the
Management regarding their dates of superannuation, the petitioners filed interlocutory application
being Misc. Case No. 7621 of 2011 in the present writ application and this Court, passed the
following order on 23.07.2007:
W.P.(C) No 3217 of 2006
5. 23.07.2007 Heard.
This misc. case has been filed by the petitioners for stay of order of superannuation dated
23.04.2007 (Annexure-1).
According to learned counsel for the petitioners, that they have been working as teachers in school
of Talcher Thermal Power Station since Orissa State Electricity Board was in operation, which was
subsequently taken over by NTPC as per 10(2)(a) and 11(1) of the TTPS (Acquisition and Transfers)

Saudamini Swain And Another vs State Of Orissa And Others ....... Opp. ... on 21 February, 2025
Act, 1994, which contains the provisions for protection of service conditions of the petitioners that
was prevailing while the petitioners, were serving under TTPS Now the learned counsel for the
petitioners submits that as undisputedly the petitioners are the employees of NTPC they may be
given salary as per the scale meant for the NTPC employee and they should also be superannuated at
the age of 60. Mr.Das, learned counsel for the OPs pointed out that the petitioners are yet to accept
the proposal of the NTPC for which they have remained in the scale of pay and other service
conditions as it was applicable to TTPS employees. However, learned counsel for the petitioners
contested the contention by. stating that there cannot be two different age of superannuation, one
for the direct employees of the NTPC and another for teachers of school run by the NTPC being
taken over from TTPS. But all these aspects can be taken care of during final hearing of the writ
petition. From what is narrated before, this Court is of the considered view that the petitioners could
not have been discriminated with regard to their age of superannuation.
Therefore, we are not inclined to grant stay as prayed for. However, we make it clear that the
petitioners shall be entitled to all the benefits including financial benefits that would accrue in that
would accrue in the event they succeed in the writ petition.
The misc. is disposed of accordingly.
List W.P.(C) No. 3217 of 2006 in the list of fresh admission on 21st August, 2007.
Issue urgent certified copy of this order as per rules.
[Emphasis added]
60. The date of superannuation being 60 years for the employees of NTPC, the same also ought to be
extended in favour of the petitioners. As such, the petitioners shall be entitled to differential pay
scales from 03.06.1995 till the date of superannuation calculated as 60 years.
61. Further, NTPC not having been able to demonstrate a plausible and justified reason for not
extending the due benefits to the petitioners including pension and pensionary benefits, if any,
resulting in the petitioners being involved in protracted litigation extending for more than two
decades, shall also be liable to pay interest calculated at the rate of 7.5% per annum on the arrears
till the date of actual payment.
CONCLUSION
62. In the result, the writ applications are allowed. The impugned orders i.e., office order dated
03.12.2004 (Annexure-4 of W.P.(C) No. 3217 of 2006 and Annexure-5 of W.P.(C) No.11200 of
2005) and order dated 25/23.05.2005 (Annexure-8 of W.P.(C) No. 3217 of 2006) are hereby
quashed. NTPC management is directed to re-calculate the dues of the petitioners in terms of the
observations made and illustration given in the preceding paragraph and to disburse the same in
their favour along with interest so also pensionary benefits at par with their counterparts in the
administrative side as early as possible, preferably within a period of three months from the date of
