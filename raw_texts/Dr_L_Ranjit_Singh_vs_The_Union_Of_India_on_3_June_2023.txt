counsel assisted by Mr. L. Rajesh, learned counsel for the fifth respondent today and the reply
arguments advanced by Mr. HS Paonam, learned senior counsel for the petitioner for the arguments

2. This writ petition has been filed by the petitioner to quash the impugned order dated 16.1.2023
issued by the second respondent entrusting the additional charge of Director, Regional Institute of
Medical Sciences (RIMS), Imphal to the fifth respondent and to direct the respondents to consider
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74604494/ 3
Dr. L. Ranjit Singh vs The Union Of India on 3 June, 2023
the case of the petitioner for conferring the WP(C) No. 65 of 2023 with MC(WP(C)) No. 121 of 2023
and MC(WP(C)) No. 160 of 2023 Page |5 charge of Director, RIMS being the senior most Professor
in RIMS pending appointment of a regular Director in RIMS.
3. Pending writ petition, the Under Secretary, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government
India had issued an order dated 10.4.2023 extending additional charge of the post of Director, RIMS
without any financial benefits up to 11.10.2023 or till regular appointment of Director, RIMS or till
further orders, whichever is earlier, the petitioner has filed MC (WP) No.121 of 2023 to quash the
same coupled with a prayer to stay the said order.
4. Pending writ petition, the petitioner has filed a fresh Misc. Case in MC(WP(C)) No. 160 of 2023
seeking prayer to dispose of the above writ petition without taking into account of the order dated
01.05.2023 regarding regular appointment to the post of Director, RIMS and also seeking further
prayer to direct the official respondents to allow the present applicant to function as In-charge
Director, RIMS even for a few days or month for doing complete justice for the gross injustice meted
out to him by quashing and setting aside the impugned order dated 16.01.2023 as prayed for by the
applicant in the main writ petition and subsequent extension order for securing ends of justice.
5. The brief facts are that by an order dated 12.10.2022, the petitioner was entrusted with the charge
of Director, RIMS and the said WP(C) No. 65 of 2023 with MC(WP(C)) No. 121 of 2023 and
MC(WP(C)) No. 160 of 2023 Page |6 order was challenged by the fifth respondent in W.P.(C)
No.867 of 2022 claiming to be senior to the petitioner on the basis of an inter-se seniority list which
has not been approved by the competent authority. The petitioner who is older in age is senior to the
fifth respondent as both of them were appointed as Professor in RIMS on the same day under the
Time Scale Promotion Rules without maintaining any merit. This Court, by the order dated
19.12.2022, quashed the order dated 12.10.2022 on the ground of non-consideration of senior
persons at the time of conferring the charge to the petitioner with liberty to the official respondents
for making fresh interim in-charge arrangement in respect of vacant post of Director, RIMS strictly
in terms of Rule 12(1)(iii) of the Rules and Regulations of the RIMS. Thereafter, a seniority list in
respect of 5 senior most Professors were prepared by constituting a Committee in pursuance of the
direction of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the same was forwarded to the Health
Ministry by the officials of RIMS. However, ignoring the fresh seniority list, the fifth respondent was
entrusted with the additional charge of Director, RIMS by cancelling the earlier order dated
12.10.2022, which is arbitrary exercise of power in mala fide without considering the case of other
senior Professors. Hence, the writ petition.
6. Resisting the writ petition, the respondents 1 to 4 filed affidavit-in-opposition stating that Dr.
A.Santa Singh has been WP(C) No. 65 of 2023 with MC(WP(C)) No. 121 of 2023 and MC(WP(C))
No. 160 of 2023 Page |7 repatriated from the post of Director, RIMS with effect from 11.10.2022 AN
and the authorities have issued an order dated 12.10.2022 entrusting the additional charge for the
post of Director, RIMS to the petitioner for a period of 6 months or till regular appointment of
Director, RIMS. Being aggrieved by the said order dated 12.10.2022, the fifth respondent filed
W.P.(C) No.867 of 2022 on the ground that she is at Serial No.3 in the seniority list of Professors,
RIMS and Serial No.1 being Dr. L.Jaichand Singh has already superannuated and Serial No.2 being
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74604494/ 4
Dr. L. Ranjit Singh vs The Union Of India on 3 June, 2023
Dr. Taruni Ngangbam is about to retire which is leaving the fifth respondent as the senior most
Professor and her further claim that she is the senior most person in the next lower grade of
Director.
7. It is stated that the inter-se seniority list of Professor of RIMS relied on by the fifth respondent
was not yet approved by the Executive Council of RIMS and therefore, the plea that the fifth
respondent is the senior most Professor is unfounded and without any basis. As against the order
passed in W.P.(C) No.867 of 2022, the petitioner has filed W.A.No.131 of 2022 and the same was
dismissed by a Division Bench of this Court on 19.1.2023. Pursuant to the letter dated 1.12.2022 of
the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, the then Director, RIMS constituted a four member
Committee to examine the seniority list of the Professor and, on 9.1.2023, the then Director (the
petitioner herein) has sent a letter to the Ministry for fixing of final inter- WP(C) No. 65 of 2023
with MC(WP(C)) No. 121 of 2023 and MC(WP(C)) No. 160 of 2023 Page |8 se seniority list of 5
senior most Professors of RIMS based on the recommendation of the Committee. It is stated that
the Appointment Committee of Cabinet vide DoPT dated 13.1.2023 has not approved the proposal of
entrustment of additional charge of the post of Director, RIMS to the petitioner and based on the
available tentative seniority list of Professors, ordered entrusting of additional charge of Director,
RIMS to the fifth respondent as she is found to be the senior most which has neither been
challenged by anybody nor have been interfered with by any Court of law vide the impugned order
dated 16.1.2023.
8. It is stated that the additional charge given to the fifth respondent is for making up the interim
vacancy caused thereon, particularly, after the Court's order dated 19.12.2022 passed in W.P.(C)
No.867 of 2022 and the Contempt Case Nos.202 of 2022 and 2 of 2023. The tentative inter-se
seniority list of all Professors of RIMS on roll as on 31.12.2022 has been notified vide notice dated
19.1.2023 for information and submission of objection, if any on or before 28.1.2023. As per Rule
12(1)(iii) bye-laws of RIMS and as directed by this Court in the order dated 19.12.2022 in W.P.(C)
No.867 of 2022, the Ministry have decided to entrust the additional charge for the post of Director,
RIMS to the fifth respondent as stop gap till a regular Director is appointed. Since the appointment
of the Director, RIMS is going on full swing, the respondents 1 to 4 prayed for dismissal of the writ
petition. WP(C) No. 65 of 2023 with MC(WP(C)) No. 121 of 2023 and MC(WP(C)) No. 160 of 2023

9. The fifth respondent filed affidavit-in-opposition stating that as per final inter-se seniority list of
Associate Professors of the RIMS as on 31.1.2009 issued by the then Director, the fifth respondent
has been placed at Serial No.7 and the petitioner has been placed at Serial No.11. Though both of
them were promoted on the same day i.e. 1.2.2005, the fifth respondent was promoted on regular
basis and the petitioner was promoted under the time scale promotion. It is stated that the fifth
respondent was not aware of any seniority list wherein the petitioner is alleged to have been senior
to the fifth respondent. In fact, in the final inter-se seniority list issued in the year 2015, the fifth
respondent has been placed at Serial No.37 and the petitioner has been placed at Serial No.40. In
the combined inter-se seniority list of Professors 2022, the fifth respondent has been placed at
Serial No.37 and the petitioner has been placed at Serial No.40.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74604494/ 5
Dr. L. Ranjit Singh vs The Union Of India on 3 June, 2023
10. It is stated that there is no provision in the RIMS bye-laws and the Rules and Regulations of the
RIMS which requires the Executive Council Society of the RIMS to prepare approval of seniority list
of any faculty or non-teaching staff without which seniority lists can be enforced. Assuming but not
admitting the necessity of finalizing a fresh seniority list of Professors, how can the Committee
decide on the seniority of only five Professors without even publishing a tentative seniority list and
inviting objections from interested parties. The manner WP(C) No. 65 of 2023 with MC(WP(C)) No.
121 of 2023 and MC(WP(C)) No. 160 of 2023 P a g e | 10 in which the said seniority lists was
finalized and the hastiness shown by the then Director in submitting the seniority list to the
Ministry raise questions of mala fide intention and collusion of the then Director in- charge with
other vested interested persons. The ratio decidendi in D.P.Das v. Union of India, (2011) 8 SCC 115
is not applicable to the case on hand.
11. Assailing the impugned order, Mr. HS Paonam, the learned senior counsel for the petitioner
submitted that the impugned order dated 16.1.2023 pertaining to the entrustment of additional
charge of the post of Director, RIMS, Imphal to the fifth respondent cannot be considered as an
order issued in compliance with the order passed in W.P.(C) No.867 of 2022 dated 19.12.2022, as
the condition provided for consideration have not been satisfied and, hence, it would be in the
interest of justice that the order dated 16.1.2023 is liable to be quashed.
12. The learned senior counsel further submitted that when the impugned order dated 16.1.2023 was
issued the seniority list prepared by the Committee in pursuance of the communication dated
1.12.2022 was already in the knowledge of the official respondents and therefore, the impugned
order dated 16.1.2023 having been issued without considering many senior Professors above the
fifth respondent. WP(C) No. 65 of 2023 with MC(WP(C)) No. 121 of 2023 and MC(WP(C)) No. 160
of 2023 P a g e | 11
13. The learned senior counsel would submit that the petitioner and the fifth respondent have been
promoted to the post of Professor on the same day under the Time Scale Promotion Rules where the
merit is not involved and the petitioner being older in age than the fifth respondent, she should be
treated as junior in terms of the principles enunciated in the case of D.P. Das v. Union of India,
(2011) 8 SCC 115. Similarly, it is an undeniable fact that the petitioner and the fifth respondent were
promoted to the post of Associate Professor on the same day in RIMS. However, the petitioner was
promoted to the post of Assistant Professor on 1.2.1997, whereas the fifth respondent was promoted
to the post of Assistant Professor on 1.2.1999 i.e. two years later than the promotion of the
petitioner. Thus, the petitioner shall be treated as senior to the fifth respondent on the basis of the
age as well as on the basis of seniority in the grade of Assistant Professor.
14. The learned senior counsel submitted that there are more than four Professors above the fifth
respondent, who were given promotion to the post of Assistant Professor earlier than the fifth
respondent even though they were given promotion to the post of Associate Professor and Professor
on the same day without maintaining merit. Such a pick and choose policy of the official
respondents in conferring higher charge of Director, RIMS to the fifth WP(C) No. 65 of 2023 with
MC(WP(C)) No. 121 of 2023 and MC(WP(C)) No. 160 of 2023 P a g e | 12 respondent has violated
the fundamental rights of the petitioner as guaranteed under Article 14 and 16 of the Constitution of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74604494/ 6
Dr. L. Ranjit Singh vs The Union Of India on 3 June, 2023
India.
15. Adding further, Mr. HS Paonam, the learned senior counsel for the petitioner submitted that
pending writ petition, the second respondent issued an order dated 1.5.2023 conveying approval for
appointment of Dr. Guruaribam Sunil Kumar Sharma, Director Professor (Forensic Medicine &
Toxicology), Vardhman Mahavir Medical College and Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi to the post of
Director, RIMS, Imphal on deputation on foreign service basis for a period of 5 years with effect
from the date of assumption of charge of the post or upto the age of superannuation in his parent
cadre or until further orders, whichever is earlier. The said order stipulates Dr. Guruanbam Sunil
Kumar Sharma to join the post of Director, RIMS, Imphal within one month of the issue of the said
order.
16. Per contra, Mr. Kh. Samarjit, the learned DSGI appearing for the respondents 1 to 4 submitted
that just to fill up the post as stop gap till such time a regular Director is appointed, the Ministry has
decided to entrust the additional charge for the post of Director, RIMS to the fifth respondent on the
larger interest and importance attached to such an important Medical Institute, which is not only
catering to the needs of the State of Manipur, but also of the entire North-East Region and such
good intention of the respondent authorities in not WP(C) No. 65 of 2023 with MC(WP(C)) No. 121
of 2023 and MC(WP(C)) No. 160 of 2023 P a g e | 13 letting/leaving the Institute in high and dry
condition without a Director cannot be faulted with, more so, when the fifth respondent has already
reported assumption of additional charge as Director vide joining letter dated 16.1.2023 and the
report of the Deputy Director dated 16.1.2023.
17. Mr. Kh. Samarjit, the learned DSGI further submitted that pending writ petition, the
Appointment Committee of Cabinet conveyed approval of competent authority for appointment of
Dr. Guruaribam Sunil Kumar Sharma, Director Professor (Forensic Medicine & Toxicology) as
Director, RIMS, Imphal on deputation on foreign service for a period of 5 years with effect from the
date of assumption of charge of the post or upto the age of superannuation in his parent cadre, or
until further orders, whichever is the earliest. Since the appointment Dr. Guruaribam Sunil Kumar
Sharma is pursuant to the approval of the Appointment Committee of Cabinet, no fault can be
attributed against the respondent authorities.
18. Mr. Kh. Samarjit, learned DSGI also submitted that the respondent authority already called for
the objection from the professors for considering the final seniority list and the same is pending. He
also pointed out that by letter dated 19.01.2023, the tentative seniority list is prepared based on the
final seniority list of professors notified by notice No. B/2243/2005-RIMS (Pt.) dated 27.07.2015
and subsequent addition of promotees after 2015 and WP(C) No. 65 of 2023 with MC(WP(C)) No.
121 of 2023 and MC(WP(C)) No. 160 of 2023 P a g e | 14 against this notice dated 19.01.2023, the
petitioner as well as the 5 th respondent alongwith the other persons were submitted their
objections and the same is pending for consideration.
19. Mr. Kh. Samarjit, learned DSGI further stated that the petitioner has prayed in the writ petition
that he may be given In-Charge by quashing the In-charge order given to 5th respondent till the
regular Director appointment to be made by the official respondent but in the MC(WP(C))No.160 of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74604494/ 7
Dr. L. Ranjit Singh vs The Union Of India on 3 June, 2023
2023 strengthening the prayer made in the writ petition has prayed that he may be given In-Charge
even after the regular appointment given to Mr. Dr. Guruaribam Sunil Kumar Sharma. Therefore,
the Misc. application cannot be taken into and as per the prayer made in the writ petition once the
regular appointment of Director was appointed, the petitioner has no case at all.
20. Dr. RK Deepak, the learned senior counsel for the fifth respondent submitted that the seniority
of Professors should be based on the seniority position by the incumbents while they were Associate
Professors. Since the fifth respondent was senior to the petitioner while they were Associate
Professors, the authorities of RIMS had rightly fixed the seniority position of Professors in the final
inter-se seniority list of Professors 2015 as well as the combined final inter-se seniority list of
Professors 2017. He would submit that the entrustment of additional charge of Director, RIMS to
the fifth respondent was in compliance with WP(C) No. 65 of 2023 with MC(WP(C)) No. 121 of 2023
and MC(WP(C)) No. 160 of 2023 P a g e | 15 the order dated 19.12.2022 passed in W.P.(C) No.867 of
2022. In fact, the official respondents have exercised due diligence and have not violated any law in
issuing the impugned orders. Further, the seniority list of five Professors prepared by the Committee
is not a seniority list at all and it suffers from irregularity that the petitioner claims to have been
associated with the tentative seniority list. That apart, the petitioner is trying to mislead this Court
by reiterating wrong material facts again and again.
21. The learned senior counsel further submitted that vide order dated 1.2.2005, the fifth
respondent was appointed through regular promotion to the substantive post of Associate Professor,
whereas vide order dated 21.4.2005, the petitioner was appointed to the post of Associate Professor
with effect from 1.2.2005 under the Time Scale Promotion Rules, 1991 and that the preference of
those appointed through regular promotion over those appointed on Time Scale Promotion as
regards fixing seniority is a well settled principle of law. Thus, a prayer has been made to dismiss the
writ petition.
22. This Court considered the rival submissions and also perused the materials available on record.
23. The grievance of the petitioner is that ignoring the fresh seniority list, the fifth respondent was
entrusted with the additional WP(C) No. 65 of 2023 with MC(WP(C)) No. 121 of 2023 and
MC(WP(C)) No. 160 of 2023 P a g e | 16 charge of Director, RIMS, Imphal by cancelling the earlier
order dated 12.10.2022. Further grievance of the petitioner is that pending writ petition, the order
dated 1.5.2023 came to be issued by the second respondent appointing Dr. Guruaribam Sunil Kumar
Sharma as Director, RIMS without the leave of the Court. Therefore, both the orders are liable to be
quashed.
24. As could be seen, prior to the issuance of the order dated 12.10.2022, one Dr. Ahanthem Santa
Singh was appointed to the post of Director, RIMS, Imphal on deputation basis for a period of 5
years with effect from 9.11.2018 vide order dated 28.7.2021 and before completion of his tenure of 5
years, Dr. Ahanthem Santa Singh was repatriated prematurely from the post of Director to his
parent cadre with effect from 12.10.2022 vide order dated 18.7.2022 issued by the Joint Secretary to
the Government of India, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. After repatriation of Dr.Ahanthem
Santa Singh and pending process for appointment of Director, RIMS on regular basis, the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74604494/ 8
Dr. L. Ranjit Singh vs The Union Of India on 3 June, 2023
authorities of RIMS issued the order dated 12.10.2022 entrusting the additional charge for the post
of Director, RIMS to the petitioner for a period of 6 months or till regular appointment of Director,
RIMS or till further orders whichever is earlier.
25. Challenging the order dated 12.10.2022, the fifth respondent herein has filed W.P.(C) No.867 of
2022 and, this Court, by WP(C) No. 65 of 2023 with MC(WP(C)) No. 121 of 2023 and MC(WP(C))
No. 160 of 2023 P a g e | 17 the order dated 19.12.2022, allowed the writ petition. In paragraph 14,
this Court observed thus:
"[14] In so far as the contention advanced by the learned senior counsel appearing for
respondent No.5 is concerned, it has to be pointed out that as the validity and
correctness of the said tentative inter-se- seniority list of Professor, RIMS has not
been questioned or challenged by anybody and as such issue is not before this Court
in the present proceeding, this Court is of the considered view that it will not be just
and proper to entertain and decide the points and contentions raised by the learned
senior counsel appearing for respondent No.5 in the present proceedings.
Accordingly, this Court declined to do so.
For the findings and reasons given hereinabove, the present writ petition is hereby
allowed by quashing and setting aside the impugned order dated 12.10.2022.
Quashing of the impugned order will not preclude the official respondents from
making fresh interim in-charge arrangement in respect of the vacant post of Director,
RIMS, Imphal strictly in terms of the provisions of Rule 12(1)(iii) of the Rules and
Regulations of RIMS.
With the aforesaid directions, the present writ petition is disposed of without any
order as to costs."

26. Aggrieved by the order dated 19.12.2022, the petitioner has filed W.A.No.131 of 2022 and, by the
judgment dated 19.1.2023, the Division Bench of this Court dismissed the writ appeal by observing
as under:
"[7] Mr. HS Paonam, learned senior counsel, would contend that it would be
necessary to examine whether the cases of other senior professors were considered
when the decision was taken to entrust the additional charge to respondent No.1
herein. However, in our considered opinion, any grievance that the appellant may
have with regard to the later order dated 16.1.2023 would constitute a fresh cause of
action as the decision embodied therein was taken by the authorities independently,
in compliance with the direction of the learned Judge that they should follow the
relevant Rules scrupulously. As to whether there was any error on the part of the
authorities in doing so would not fall for consideration in this appeal and would

necessarily have to be subjected to judicial review by way of independent proceedings
instituted in accordance with law.
Leaving it open to the appellant to do so, if so advised, W.A.No.131 of 2022 is
dismissed."
27. Pursuant to the leave granted by the Division Bench of this Court and aggrieved by the order
dated 16.1.2023, the petitioner is before this Court. The observation of the learned Single Judge in
WP(C) No. 65 of 2023 with MC(WP(C)) No. 121 of 2023 and MC(WP(C)) No. 160 of 2023 P a g e | 19
W.P.(C) No.867 of 2022 is quashing of the order dated 12.10.2022 will not preclude the official
respondents from making fresh interim in- charge arrangement in respect of vacant post of Director,
RIMS, Imphal strictly in terms of the provisions of Rule 12(1)(iii) of the Rules and Regulations of
RIMS.
28. Rule 12(1)(iii) provides:
"12. Director of Institute 12(1)
(iii) Notwithstanding anything contained hereinabove, the President, RIMS may
appoint a person to officiate as director either during temporary absence of the
regular incumbent or where the office of Director falls vacant for any reason for a
period not exceeding six months at a time within the concurrence of the Central
Government. However, in respect of unanticipated vacancies (the regular
appointments to which require ACC approval) the administrative ministry may, with
the approval of the Minister in charge, order additional charge arrangements subject
to maximum period of six months, with effect from the date of occurrence of the
vacancy and also subject to the condition that the officer to whom the additional
charge is assigned is the senior most officer in the next lower grade and is clear from
vigilance angle."

29. On examination of the provisions of Rule 12(1)(iii) supra, it is clear that in respect of
unanticipated vacancies in the post of Director, RIMS, the administrative Ministry may, with the
approval of the Minister in-charge, order additional charge arrangements subject to maximum
period of 6 months, with effect from the date of occurrence of the vacancy and also subject to the
condition that the officer to whom the additional charge is assigned is senior most officer in the next
lower grade and is clear from the vigilance angle.
30. In the order impugned dated 16.1.2023, it has been stated as under:
"In compliance of Hon'ble High Court order dated 19.12.2022 in W.P. (C) No.867 of
2022 filed by Dr. H.Priyosakhi Devi vs UOI & others, this Ministry's order

2. The additional charge to the post of Director, RIMS, Imphal is hereby entrusted to
Dr. H.Priyosakhi Devi, Prof. ENT, RIMS, Imphal upto 11.04.2023 or till regular
appointment of Director, RIMS, Imphal or till further orders, whichever is the
earliest.
3. This issues with the approval of competent authority."

31. The second respondent entrusted the additional charge to the post of Director, RIMS, Imphal to
the fifth respondent based on the inter-se seniority list of Professors, RIMS, Imphal as on 25.7.2015.
Whereas when we see the inter-se seniority list of Professors, RIMS, Imphal as on 9.1.2023, the
petitioner's name found place at Serial No.1 and the fifth respondent's name found place at Serial
No.5. The said seniority list states the date of birth of the petitioner as "01.09.1958" and the date of
birth of the fifth respondent as "05.06.1960". As rightly argued by the learned counsel for the
petitioner, ignoring the seniority list dated 9.1.2023, the second respondent issued the impugned
order dated 16.1.2023 whereby entrusting the charge of the Director, RIMS to the fifth respondent.
32. As stated supra, in the earlier writ petition, the observation of this Court is to the effect that the
authorities had not even considered the cases of other senior Professors while placing the petitioner
herein as in-charge Director of RIMS, Imphal and the Court has also observed that it is left open to
the authorities to make interim in-charge arrangements strictly as per Rule 12(1)(iii) of the Rules
and Regulations of RIMS, Imphal. When such being the observation of this Court and the Rule
12(1)(iii) made it clear that an additional charge arrangement was subject to the condition that the
officer to whom such additional WP(C) No. 65 of 2023 with MC(WP(C)) No. 121 of 2023 and
MC(WP(C)) No. 160 of 2023 P a g e | 22 charge is assigned is the senior most officer in the next
lower grade, ignoring the inter-se seniority which was prepared as on 9.1.2023, the second
respondent has entrusted the additional charge to the fifth respondent as if she is the senior most.
That apart, as pleaded by the petitioner, the tentative seniority list on the basis whereof, the fifth
respondent was entrusted with the additional charge of Director, RIMS, Imphal was not approved
by the Executive Council.
33. The argument of Mr. Kh. Samarjit, the learned DSGI that the Appointment Committee of
Cabinet has not approved the proposal of entrustment of additional charge of the post of Director,
RIMS to the petitioner and that while awaiting finalization of the seniority list of Professors, the
process which has already been undertaken and going on in good pace, the authorities, based on the
available tentative seniority list as on the date, have ordered entrusting of additional charge of
Director, RIMS, Imphal to the fifth respondent is not well founded. Further, the statement of the
official respondents that the fifth respondent is senior most in the said tentative list, which has
neither been challenged by anybody nor have been interfered with by any Court of law is against the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74604494/ 11
Dr. L. Ranjit Singh vs The Union Of India on 3 June, 2023
inter-se seniority list of Professors prepared as on 9.1.2023.
34. The argument of the learned senior counsel for the petitioner is that the Appointment
Committee of Cabinet ought to have WP(C) No. 65 of 2023 with MC(WP(C)) No. 121 of 2023 and
MC(WP(C)) No. 160 of 2023 P a g e | 23 approved the proposal for entrustment of additional charge
of Director, RIMS being the senior most Professor in RIMS. Further, the tentative seniority list was
not circulated and not approved by the Executive Council and therefore, it cannot be acted upon in
any manner. The aforesaid arguments of the learned senior counsel for the petitioner cannot be
brushed aside for the reason that, as stated supra, nothing has been produced by the respondents to
show that the tentative seniority list on the basis whereof, the fifth respondent was entrusted
additional charge Director, RIMS was approved by the Executive Council.
35. The other argument of the learned senior counsel for the petitioner that the objection of the
petitioner claiming to be the senior most Professor on the ground that he is older than the fifth
respondent and since they were promoted to the post of Associate Professor on the same date
without merit and that the petitioner ought to be senior to the fifth respondent cannot also be
brushed aside, as the petitioner claimed that he was promoted to the post of Assistant Professor
earlier than the fifth respondent and, as such, the petitioner ought to be placed above the fifth
respondent. In view of the flaw stated above in entrusting the additional charge of Director, RIMS to
the fifth respondent, this Court is of the view that till the finalization of the seniority list, the
petitioner, who is the senior most and being older and also promoted earlier to the post WP(C) No.
65 of 2023 with MC(WP(C)) No. 121 of 2023 and MC(WP(C)) No. 160 of 2023 P a g e | 24 of
Assistant Professor than the fifth respondent ought to have been entrusted with the charge of
Director, RIMS, Imphal. As stated supra, nothing has been produced to show on the basis whereof
the fifth respondent can be treated as senior to the petitioner. On the other hand, prima facie, it has
been proved by the petitioner that by taking shelter on an unapproved tentative seniority list which
the respondents 1 to 4 themselves termed as unauthenticated, the impugned order dated 16.1.2023
was issued by a colourable exercise of power. In view of the findings arrived at by this Court that the
impugned order dated 16.1.2023 has been issued in colourable exercise of power, the subsequent
extension dated 10.4.2023 granted upto 11.10.2023 or till regular appointment of Director, RIMS,
Imphal or till further orders whichever is earlier, is unsustainable in law.
36. Coming to the order dated 1.5.2023 issued by the second respondent, whereby appointing Dr.
Guruaribam Sunil Kumar Sharma, Director Professor (Forensic Medicine & Toxicology),
Vardhaman Mahavir Medical College and Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi to the post of Director,
RIMS, Imphal, on deputation on foreign service basis for the period of 5 years with effect from the
date of assumption of charge of the post or upto the age of superannuation in his parent cadre or
until further orders whichever is earlier, is without the leave of Court. When the petitioner has
challenged the entrustment of additional WP(C) No. 65 of 2023 with MC(WP(C)) No. 121 of 2023
and MC(WP(C)) No. 160 of 2023 P a g e | 25 charge of Director, RIMS, Imphal in the writ petition
and the respondent authorities and the fifth respondent are contesting the writ petition, it is the
bounden duty of the authority concerned to obtain permission/leave of the Court to issue the order
dated 1.5.2023. Nothing has been produced by the respondents 1 to 4 to show that the order dated
1.5.2023 has been issued with the permission of the Court.

Dr. L. Ranjit Singh vs The Union Of India on 3 June, 2023
37. It is not the case of the respondents 1 to 4 that the petitioner is not suitable to hold the additional
charge to the post of Director, RIMS, Imphal. The respondents 1 to 4 contended that pursuant to the
order dated 1.5.2023 Dr. Guruaribam Sunil Kumar Sharma has not joined the duty till date even
though the respondent No. 2 extended the time for 2 (two) weeks i.e. upto 15.06.2023 by order
dated 30.05.2023. Since the petitioner is senior most Professor and already held the additional
charge to the post of Director, RIMS, Imphal and also he is likely to be superannuated in the month
of September, 2023, this Court is of the view that in the interest of justice and equity, the
respondents 1 to 4 are directed to consider to give in-charge post of Director, RIMS, Imphal to the
petitioner till his retirement.
38. In the result,
(a) The writ petition is allowed and the order dated 16.1.2023 and the subsequent extension dated
WP(C) No. 65 of 2023 with MC(WP(C)) No. 121 of 2023 and MC(WP(C)) No. 160 of 2023 P a g e |
26 10.4.2023 issued by the second respondent are set aside.
(b) MC (WP(C)) No.121 of 2023 and MC(WP(C)) No.
160 of 2023 are disposed of.
(c) The respondents 1 to 4 are directed to give additional
charge of Director, RIMS, Imphal to the petitioner till his retirement in the month of September,
2023.
(d) Since the order dated 1.5.2023 has been issued without leave of Court and Dr. Guruaribam Sunil
Kumar Sharma has not joined duty, this Court directs the respondents 1 to 4 not to give effect of the
order dated 1.5.2023 issued by the Deputy Secretary to the Government of India, Ministry of Health
and Family Welfare (NE Section) and the same shall be kept in abeyance.
(e) There will be no order as to costs.
