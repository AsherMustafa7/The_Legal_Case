1. The Jammu and Kashmir Public Commission (JKPSC) has set into course a recruitment process
for 69 posts of Civil Judge (Junior Division) in Subordinate Judiciary under the Jammu and
Kashmir Civil Service (Judicial) Recruitment Rules, 1967. For the said purpose, the Jammu and

Mridulla Kirti And Others vs High Court Of J&K And Others on 20 September, 2023
3. Twenty three (23) petitioners have joined together to be the writ petitioners in the present writ
petition before this Court bearing an issue with prescription of maximum age of 35 years as on
01.01.2023 required for appearing in the current recruitment process.
4. All the writ petitioners, claim themselves eligible except for the upper age limit in terms of their
academic credentials. In fact, some of them even claim to be in practice of law by reference to their
date of enrolment as an advocate.
5. The petitioners' issue with the upper age prescription is that prior to the aforementioned
recruitment notification, the last recruitment related notification for the post of Civil Judge (Junior
Division)/Munsiff was issued in the year 2019 when Jammu and Kashmir Public Service
Commission had sought to undertake a recruitment exercise by issuance of selection advertisement
vide Notification no. PSC/Exam/2018-19/4 dated 09.10.2019 for 24 posts which however came to
be aborted by the Jammu and Kashmir Public Service Commission in terms of a communication no.
GAD(Adm) 59/2019-1 dated 21.11.2019 from the General Administration Department (GAD
Government of J&K to the J&K Public Service Commission).
6. Thus, for the years 2019, 2020, 2021 & 2022, there was no recruitment exercise undertaken by
the Government of UT of Jammu & Kashmir and Public Service Commission for the selection to the
post of Civil Judge (Junior Division)/Munsiff and as such the petitioners did not have an
opportunity to appear in a competition meant for selection to the post of Civil Judge (Junior
Division)/Munsiff while they were still in the prescribed age limit in the aforementioned missed out
years.
7. The petitioners' plead in the writ petition that all of them had responded to the advertisement
notification no. PSC/Exam/2018-19/4 dated 09.10.2019 in which also the maximum age limit was
35 years and all the petitioners were within that age limit eligible to apply and compete for the
selection but came to be deprived of an occasion and opportunity to prove their merit for selection
because of the fact that the selection/recruitment exercise was aborted without the petitioners
having any role in the decision of the General Administration Department Government of J&K in
not carrying forward the recruitment process with respect to said 2019 notification. Now, when the
petitioners have come across with the next available opportunity in the form of present notification
dated 27.08.2023 issued by the Jammu and Kashmir Public Service Commission for 69 posts of
Civil Judge (Junior Division)/Munsiff in which are included 24 posts of last notification dated
09.10.2019, the petitioners feel themselves robbed off an opportunity to compete for the selection
process just because they are found to be now over 35 years of age and that they have not become
over age by their own choice to suffer denial of opportunity which has come to them now.
8. It is in this background, the petitioners are seeking their participation in the ongoing selection
process by having the indulgence of this Court on its judicial side in the face of the fact that on its
administrative side the High Court of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh has turned down the plea to
grant any age relaxation in favour of the petitioners.

Mridulla Kirti And Others vs High Court Of J&K And Others on 20 September, 2023
9. Mr. Abhinav Sharma, the learned senior counsel for the petitioners submits that a scenario
obtaining in the present writ petition came to be so obtained before the High Court of Delhi with
respect to recruitment process in Delhi Judicial Services in the year 2022 taking place after a miss of
two recruitment years i.e. of 2020 and 2021 and the matter landed before Hon'ble the Supreme
Court of India resulting in a judgment in case of "High Court of Delhi Vs. Devina Sharma" in which
Hon'ble the Supreme Court in para-18 of the judgment summed up the situation in the following
manner which is reproduced as under:
"18. Having regard to the fact that the recruitment examination for DJS has been last
held in 2019 and two recruitment years have elapsed in the meantime, we are of the
view that the suggestion of the High Court should be accepted for this year. The
consequence of the acceptance of the suggestion by this Court, would be that
candidates who would have fulfilled the upper age limit of 32 years, for the
recruitment years 2020 and 2021 would be eligible to participate in the examination
for the ensuing recruitment year 2022. The age bar which they would now encounter
is not of their own volition. The real element of hardship faced by such candidates
has been remedied by the High Court and there is no reason for this court not to
accept the suggestion. The examination cannot however, be postponed indefinitely
nor can the candidates who have applied be left in a state of uncertainty. The existing
candidates can have no grievance by the widening of the competition. In order to
facilitate this exercise, we accept the suggestion of the High Court that the last date
for the receipt of application forms shall be extended to 3 April 2022 and the
examination shall be held on 24 April 2022. We direct that no impediment shall be
caused in the conduct of the examination and no court shall issue any order of stay at
variance with or contrary to the above directions of this Court."
10. In light of the aforesaid facts and circumstances and the spirit of the judgment of the Hon'ble the
Supreme Court of India, learned counsel for the petitioners urge that the petitioners are the ones
whose claim for participating in the selection process shall be entertained by the Jammu and
Kashmir Public Service Commission by reference to their status vis- Ã -vis 2019 notification to which
they had responded on account of being within the age prescribed.
11. Mr. Aditya Gupta, the learned counsel for the High Court of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh is
confronted by this Court with the aforementioned judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court of India and
the parity of the situation obtaining in the present case with that of the case dealt with by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.
12. Mr. Aditya Gupta, learned counsel for the High Court of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh seeks
time to apprise himself to the aforementioned judgment.
13. A copy of this judgment has been provided to Mr. Aditya Gupta, Advocate by the learned counsel
for the petitioners.
14. Let Mr. Aditya Gupta, report response tomorrow.
