5. Record shows that criminal prosecution of applicants commenced when an FIR dated 23.01.2021

whereby all the named accused were chargesheeted under Sections 420, 406, 504, 120B I.P.C.

others v. State of U.P. and another).
10. Aforementioned application came up for admission on 17.04.2023 and this Court passed the
following order:-
"List revised.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193576053/ 3
Amit Kumar Sharma @ Bablu Sharma And 2 ... vs State Of U.P. And Another on 1 April, 2025
Heard Sri Rakesh Kumar Shukla, learned counsel for the applicants, Sri B.B.
Upadhyay, learned counsel for the State and perused the records.
This application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. has been filed by the applicants - Amit
Kumar Sharma @ Bablu Sharma, Smt. Rajrani Sharma and Smt. Ruchi Sharma with
the prayer to allow this application and quash the charge sheet dated 20.111.2022 and
cognizance order dated 15.02.2023 as well as quash the entire criminal proceeding of
Case No.17039 of 2023 (State Vs. Deepmala Bajpai and others) arising out of Case
Crime No.12 of 2021, u/s 420, 406, 504, 120-B IPC, P.S. Kotwali, District Kanpur
Nagar, pending in the Court of Chief Metropolitan, Kanpur Nagar and further to stay
the further proceedings of the aforesaid case, during the pendency of present
application.
From the perusal of FIR and even the evidence collected during investigation it
appears that cognizable offence is made out against the applicant no.1 Amit Kumar
Sharma @ Bablu Sharma. The petition in so far as applicant no.1 is concerned, there
is no ground for interference. The petition with regards to applicant no.1 Amit Kumar
Sharma @ Bablu Sharma stands dismissed at this stage.
Learned counsel for the applicants states that the purpose of the applicants would
suffice if an order is passed directing the trial court to decide the bail application of
the applicant no.1 Amit Kumar Sharma @ Bablu Sharma, as expeditiously as
possible.
Looking to the prayer of learned counsel for the applicants with regards to applicant
no.1, it is directed that if the accused-applicant no.1 Amit Kumar Sharma @ Bablu
Sharma surrenders before the trial court and applies for bail within two weeks from
today, the same shall be considered and decided expeditiously in accordance with
law.
The present application thus survives for the applicant nos.2/Smt. Rajrani and
3/Smt. Ruchi Sharma only.
Learned counsel for the applicants argued that the applicants have been falsely
implicated in the present case. It is argued that in so far as the applicant no.2 and 3
are concerned they are the mother and wife of applicant no.1 Amit Kumar Sharma @
Bablu Sharma. In the First Information Report, there is no allegation whatsoever
against them. The only allegation against them is that when the first informant went
to the house of Amit Kumar Sharma @ Bablu Sharma the applicant no.2 and 3 who
are mother and wife of Amit Kumar Sharma @ Bablu Sharma stated that he is in jail
in connection with some case under Section 307 IPC. It is argued that there is no
allegation against the said applicants.
Issue notice to the opposite party no.2 returnable within six weeks.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193576053/ 4
Amit Kumar Sharma @ Bablu Sharma And 2 ... vs State Of U.P. And Another on 1 April, 2025
Opposite party no.2 may file counter affidavit within four weeks. Learned A.G.A. may
also file counter affidavit within the same period. Rejoinder affidavit may thereafter
be filed within two weeks.
Let the matter be listed on 14.08.2023.
Till the next date of listing, no coercive actions shall be taken against the applicants
Smt. Rajrani Sharma and Smt. Ruchi Sharma of the aforesaid case."
11. During pendency of above mentioned application, parties amicably settled their dispute outside
the Court. On the basis of settlement arrived at between the parties, a compromise was entered into.
Thereafter, the terms of the compromise were reduced in writing and filed before court below.
12. In view of above, accused Amit Kumar Sharma alias Bablu Sharma and another approached this
Court by means of an Application u/s 482 Cr.P.C. No.25697of 2024 (Amit Kumar Sharma alias
Bablu Sharma and another v. State of U.P. and another). Aforementioned application was disposed
of finally vide order dated 07.08.2024 passed by his lordship Hon'ble Arun Kumar Singh Deshwal.
For ready reference the order dated 07.08.2024 which is on record at page 26 of the paper book is
extracted hereinbelow:-
"1. Heard Sri Padmaker Pandey, learned counsel for the applicants and Sri
Ghanshyam Kumar, learned A.G.A. for the State.
2. The instant application has been filed seeking quashing of the entire criminal
proceeding of the Case No. 47039 of 2023 (State vs. Deepmala Bajpai and others),
arising out of Case Crime No. 12 of 2021 under Sections 420, 406, 504, 120-B I.P.C.,
P.S. Kotwali, District Kanpur Nagar in pursuance of the compromise between the
parties dated 14.7.2023.
3. At the very outset, learned counsel for the applicants submits that the applicants
and opposite party No.2 have entered into settlement and pursuant to that settlement
the entire outstanding amount against the applicants has been paid to the first
informant. A copy of the same has been annexed at page No. 65 of the paper book. It
is further submitted that the court below be directed to verify the aforesaid
compromise. Learned counsel for the applicant has also produced original deed of
compromise dated 14.7.2023.
4. In view of the above, the applicants are directed to file the original deed of the
present compromise or a fresh compromise between the parties before the court
below within a period of 15 days.
5. In case such a compromise is filed by the applicants, the court below will verify the
same after summoning the parties and after verification of the same, it will permit the
parties to obtain certified copy of the verified compromise. The aforesaid exercise of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193576053/ 5
Amit Kumar Sharma @ Bablu Sharma And 2 ... vs State Of U.P. And Another on 1 April, 2025
verification of the compromise shall be completed by the court below within a period
of two months.
6. For a period of two months, no coercive action shall be taken against the applicants
in the aforesaid case.
7. It is further provided that the parties are at liberty to file a fresh application u/s
482 Cr.P.C. for quashing of the impugned proceeding on the basis of the verified
compromise.
8. With the aforesaid direction, the application is disposed of"
13. In compliance of above order dated 07.08.2024, parties appeared before court below and filed an
application dated 27.08.2024 containing the terms of the compromise so entered into by the parties
and also the prayer to terminate the proceedings of above-mentioned criminal case on the basis of
compromise entered into by the parties.
14. Court below in compliance of above order dated 07.08.2024 verified the compromise so entered
into by the parties vide compromise verification order dated 07.09.2024. The same is on record at
page no.77 of the paper book.
15. On the above premise, the learned counsel for applicants submits that the dispute between
parties is a purely private dispute. The criminality alleged to have been committed by accused
applicants is neither a crime against State nor against society. Furthermore, in view of the
compromise entered into by the parties, the chances of conviction of accused applicants are not only
remote but also. As such, no useful purpose shall be served by prolonging the criminal prosecution
of applicants. On the above conspectus, the learned counsel for applicants submits that the entire
proceedings pending against applicants before court below are liable to be quashed and present
application is also liable to be allowed.
16. Per contra, the learned A.G.A. for State opposite party-1 has vehemently opposed the present
application. He submits that applicants were chargesheeted under Section 120B I.P.C. which is a
non compoundable offence. Referring to the provisions contained in Section 320 Cr.P.C., the
learned AGA submits that as one of the offences complained of against accused applicants non
compoundable, therefore court below has rightly rejected the compromise entered into by the
parties vide order dated 17.09.2024. As such, no interference is warranted by this Court in the
present application. However, he could not be disclosed the factual submissions urged by learned
counsel for the applicants with reference to the record at this stage.
17. On the other hand, Mr. Prabhat Kumar Singh, the learned counsel representing first informant
opposite party-2, does not oppose the present application. He submits that he has received
instructions not to oppose the present application. Accordingly to the learned counsel representing
first informant opposite party-2, it is now an admitted fact that the parties have entered into a
compromise who has been enacted upon and verified by court below. He, therefore, contends that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193576053/ 6
Amit Kumar Sharma @ Bablu Sharma And 2 ... vs State Of U.P. And Another on 1 April, 2025
he cannot have any grievance in case the present application is decided by this Court taking into
consideration aforementioned facts.
18. Having heard the learned counsel for applicants, the learned A.G.A. for State, and upon perusal
of record, this Court finds that the crux of the matter is that the parties have entered into a
compromise which has been enacted upon and verified by the court below.
19. Be that as it may, this Court is not unmindful of the following judgements of Apex Court:

xviii. H.N. Pandakumar Vs. State of Karnataka, 2025 SCC OnLine SC 38.
wherein the Apex Court has categorically held that compromise can be made between
the parties even in respect of certain cognizable and non compoundable offences.
However, Apex Court in State of M.P. Vs. Laxmi Narayan (Supra) held that no
compromise can be made in respect of offences against society as they are not private
in nature. Similarly in Ram Pal Vs. State of Haryana (Supra) it has been held that no
compromise can be made in cases relating to rape and sexual assault. Recently, Apex
Court in Daxaben (supra) has held that no compromise can be made in matter under
Section 306 IPC. In state of Kerala Vs. Hafsal Rahman (Supra), Court has held that
no compromise can be entertained in matters under the POCSO Act. Reference may
also be made to the decision given by this Court in Shaifullah and others Vs. State of
U.P. And another [2013 (83) ACC 278] in which the law expounded by the Apex court
in some of the aforesaid cases has been explained in detail.
20. Recently Apex court in Parbatbhai Aahir @ Parbatbhai Bhimsinhbhai Karmur (Supra) has laid
down the following guidelines with regard to quashing of criminal proceedings as well compromise
in criminal proceedings in paragraphs 16 to 16.10 of the report, which read as under:
"16. The broad principles which emerge from the precedents on the subject, may be
summarized in the following propositions 16.1. Section 482 preserves the inherent
powers of the High Court to prevent an abuse of the process of any court or to secure
the ends of justice. The provision does not confer new powers. It only recognises and
preserves powers which inhere in the High Court;
16.2. The invocation of the jurisdiction of the High Court to quash a First Information
Report or a criminal proceeding on the ground that a settlement has been arrived at
between the offender and the victim is not the same as the invocation of jurisdiction
for the purpose of compounding an offence. While compounding an offence, the
power of the court is governed by the provisions of Section 320 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973. The power to quash under Section 482 is attracted even if
the offence is non-compoundable.
16.3. In forming an opinion whether a criminal proceeding or complaint should be
quashed in exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 482, the High Court must
evaluate whether the ends of justice would justify the exercise of the inherent power;
16.4. While the inherent power of the High Court has a wide ambit and plenitude it
has to be exercised; (i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent an abuse of the
process of any court;
16.5. The decision as to whether a complaint or First Information Report should be
quashed on the ground that the offender and victim have settled the dispute, revolves
ultimately on the facts and circumstances of each case and no exhaustive elaboration
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193576053/ 8
Amit Kumar Sharma @ Bablu Sharma And 2 ... vs State Of U.P. And Another on 1 April, 2025
of principles can be formulated;
16.6. In the exercise of the power under Section 482 and while dealing with a plea
that the dispute has been settled, the High Court must have due regard to the nature
and gravity of the offence. Heinous and serious offences involving mental depravity
or offences such as murder, rape and dacoity cannot appropriately be quashed
though the victim or the family of the victim have settled the dispute. Such offences
are, truly speaking, not private in nature but have a serious impact upon society. The
decision to continue with the trial in such cases is founded on the overriding element
of public interest in punishing persons for serious offences;
16.7. As distinguished from serious offences, there may be criminal cases which have
an overwhelming or predominant element of a civil dispute. They stand on a distinct
footing in so far as the exercise of the inherent power to quash is concerned;
16.8. Criminal cases involving offences which arise from commercial, financial,
mercantile, partnership or similar transactions with an essentially civil flavour may
in appropriate situations fall for quashing where parties have settled the dispute;
16.9. In such a case, the High Court may quash the criminal proceeding if in view of
the compromise between the disputants, the possibility of a conviction is remote and
the continuation of a criminal proceeding would cause oppression and prejudice; and
16.10. There is yet an exception to the principle set out in propositions 16.8 and 16.9
above. Economic offences involving the financial and economic well-being of the
state have implications which lie beyond the domain of a mere dispute between
private disputants. The High Court would be justified in declining to quash where the
offender is involved in an activity akin to a financial or economic fraud or
misdemeanour. The consequences of the act complained of upon the financial or
economic system will weigh in the balance."
21. In Ramgopal and another (supra), Court has again reiterated the guidelines regarding quashing
of criminal proceedings in view of compromise. Following has been observed in paragraphs 18-19 of
the report:-
"18. It is now a well crystalized axiom that plenary jurisdiction of this Court to impart
complete justice under Article 142 cannot ipso facto be limited or restricted by
ordinary statutory provisions. It is also noteworthy that even in the absence of an
express provision akin to Section 482 Cr.P.C. conferring powers on the Supreme
Court to abrogate and set aside criminal proceedings, the jurisdiction exercisable
under Article 142 of the Constitution embraces this Court with scopious powers to
quash criminal proceedings also, so as to secure complete justice. In doing so, due
regard must be given to the overarching objective of sentencing in the criminal justice
system, which is grounded on the sub-lime philosophy of maintenance of peace of the
collective and that the rationale of placing an individual behind bars is aimed at his
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193576053/ 9
Amit Kumar Sharma @ Bablu Sharma And 2 ... vs State Of U.P. And Another on 1 April, 2025
reformation.
19. We thus sum-up and hold that as opposed to Section 320 Cr.P.C. where the Court
is squarely guided by the compromise between the parties in respect of offences
'compoundable' within the statutory framework, the extra-ordinary power enjoined
upon a High Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C. or vested in this Court under Article
142 of the Constitution, can be invoked beyond the metes and bounds of Section 320
Cr.P.C. Nonetheless, we reiterate that such powers of wide amplitude ought to be
exercise carefully in the context of quashing criminal proceedings, bearing in mind:
(i) Nature and effect of the offence on the conscious of the society; (ii) Seriousness of
the injury, if any; (iii) Voluntary nature of compromise between accused and the
victim; & (iv) Conduct of the accused persons, prior to and after the occurrence of the
purported offence and/or other relevant considerations."
22. In State of M.P. Vs. Laxmi Narayan (Supra), the Apex Court held that mere mention of Section
307 IPC cannot be sole basis for not quashing the proceedings. Court has to examine whether the
prosecution has collected sufficient evidence for framing of charge under Section 307 IPC. The Court
is further required to examine the weapons used and nature of injury and whether injury has been
inflicted on vital/delicate parts of the body, the previous antecedents of accused and whether they
are absconding and how the compromise was got entered into by the parties are relevant factors,
which must be considered. The above observations can be clearly delineated from the recital
occurring in paragraphs 11 to 18 of the aforementioned report.
23. Having heard the learned counsel for applicant, the learned A.G.A. for State-opposite party-1,
the learned counsel representing first informant-opposite party-2, upon perusal of record and in
view of observations made by the Apex Court as noted herein above, this Court finds that there does
not exist any legal impediment in accepting the compromise entered into by the parties. In view of
the compromise entered into by the parties, the chances of conviction of accused-applicants is
remote and bleak. As such, no useful purpose shall be served in prolonging the criminal proceedings
pending against accused-applicants. The trial would only entail loss of judicial time in a futile
pursuit particularly when torrents of litigation drown the Courts with an unimaginable flood of
dockets.
24. In view of the discussion made above, the present application succeeds and is liable to be
allowed.
25. It is, accordingly, allowed.
26. The entire proceedings of chargesheet dated 20.11.2022 and cognizance order dated 15.02.2023
as well as quash the entire criminal proceeding of Case No.17039 of 2023 (State v. Deepmala Bajpai
and others) pending in the Court of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Kanpur Nagar arising out of
Case Crime No.12 of 2021, under Sections 420, 406, 504, 120B I.P.C. at Police Station Kotwali
District Kanpur Nagar and Case No.17039 of 2023 (State v. Deepmala Bajpai and others) pending in
the Court of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Kanpur Nagar arising out of Case Crime No.12 of 2021,
