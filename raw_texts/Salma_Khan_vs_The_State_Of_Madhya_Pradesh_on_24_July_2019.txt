Salma Khan vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 24 July, 2019
2. Misc. Criminal Case No. 15828/2019 has been filed by the petitioner for quashing the FIR
registered at Crime No.260/2018 for the offence punishable under Sections 363 and 511 of IPC,
whereas Misc. Criminal Case No.12252/2019 has been filed by the complainant seeking direction to
the respondents for fair and impartial investigation of Crime No.260/2018.
3. Facts are being taken from Misc. Criminal Case No.15828/2019:-
M.Cr.C. No.15828/2019.
4. The complainant lodged FIR on 13.6.2018 alleging that she was returning back to her home from
school. When she reached near Paganvisi School, one Bolero vehicle bearing registration No.
MP-07/CF-1637 reached there and a person offered her chocolate.
When she denied, then the person forcibly tried to abduct the complainant but the complainant
escaped from the place using hooks and crooks.
5. It is contended by counsel for the applicant that the applicant has been falsely implicated in this
case. Annexure P-1 is abuse of process of law. The case has been registered to get the
-( 3 )- MCRC No.15828/2019 & MCRC No.12252/2019 Prakash Singh Vs. State of MP & Salma Khan
Vs. State of MP & Anr.
property of late Jahan Singh. The complainants are economically and politically sound persons. It is
further submitted that the FIR is not named. The footage of CCTV shows non-commission of any
offence, hence requested to qaush the FIR.
6. It is submitted by counsel for the applicant that there was previous enmity between the parties
due to civil litigation, therefore, the applicant has been falsely implicated in the criminal case to
compel him to file compromise in the concerning case.
Hence, it is prayed that the application may be allowed by quashing the FIR registered at Crime No.
260/2018 and other consequential proceedings.
7. Per contra, learned Public Prosecutor for the State has opposed the submissions and submitted
that there is sufficient material available against the present applicant to constitute the offence
against him, hence requested to reject the petition under Section 482 of Cr.P.C.
8. I have considered rival contentions of the parties and perused the record.
9. In the present case, the applicant has sought reliefs praying therein to quash the FIR registered by
Police Station Madhoganj, District Gwalior in connection with Crime No. 260/2018 for the offence
under Sections 363 and 511 of the IPC.

Vs. State of MP & Anr.
10. In Amit kapoor Vs. Ramesh Chander and Anr. (2012) 8 SCC 460, the Hon. Apex Court has
observed as under:-
27.1. Though there are no limits of the powers of the Court under Section 482 CrPC
but the more the power, the more due care and caution is to be exercised in invoking
these powers. The power of quashing criminal proceedings, particularly, the charge
framed in terms of Section 228 CrPC should be exercised very sparingly and with
circumspection and that too in the rarest of rare cases.
27.2 The court should apply the test as to whether the uncontroverted allegations as
made from the record of the case and the documents submitted therewith prima facie
establish the offence or not. If the allegations are so patently absurd and inherently
improbable that no prudent person can ever reach such a conclusion and where the
basic ingredients of a criminal offence are not satisfied then the Court may interfere.
27.3 The High Court should not unduly interfere.
No meticulous examination of the evidence is needed for considering whether the case would end in
conviction or not at the stage of framing of charge or quashing of charge.
27.4. Where the exercise of such power is absolutely essential to prevent patent miscarriage of
justice and for correcting some grave error that might be committed by the subordinate courts even
in such cases, the High Court should be loathe to interfere, at the threshold, to throttle the
prosecution in exercise of its inherent powers.
27.5. Where there is an express legal bar enacted in any of the provisions of CrPC or any specific law
in force to the very initiation or institution and continuance of such criminal proceedings, such a bar
is intended to provide specific protection to an accused.
27.6. The Court has a duty to balance the freedom
-( 5 )- MCRC No.15828/2019 & MCRC No.12252/2019 Prakash Singh Vs. State of MP & Salma Khan
Vs. State of MP & Anr.
of a person and the right of the complainant or prosecution to investigate and prosecute the
offender.
27.7. The process of the Court cannot be permitted to be used for an oblique or ultimate/ulterior
purpose.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135052453/ 3
Salma Khan vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 24 July, 2019
27.8. Where the allegations made and as they appeared from the record and documents annexed
therewith to predominantly give rise and constitute a civil wrong with no element of criminality and
does not satisfy the basic ingredients of a criminal offence, the court may be justified in quashing the
charge. Even in such cases, the court would not embark upon the critical analysis of the evidence.
27.9. Another very significant caution that the courts have to observe is that it cannot examine the
facts, evidence and materials on record to determine whether there is sufficient material on the basis
of which the case would end in a conviction; the court is concerned primarily with the allegations
taken as a whole whether they will constitute an offence and, if so, is it an abuse of the process of
court leading to injustice.
27.10. It is neither necessary nor is the court called upon to hold a full-fledged enquiry or to
appreciate evidence collected by the investigating agencies to find out whether it is a case of
acquittal or conviction.
27.11. Where allegations give rise to a civil claim and also amount to an offence, merely because a
civil claim is maintainable, does not mean that a criminal complaint cannot be maintained.
27.12. In exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 228 and/or under Section 482, the court cannot
take into consideration external materials given by an accused for reaching the conclusion that no
offence was disclosed or that there was possibility of his acquittal. The court has to consider the
record and documents annexed with by the prosecution.
27.13. Quashing of a charge is an exception to the
-( 6 )- MCRC No.15828/2019 & MCRC No.12252/2019 Prakash Singh Vs. State of MP & Salma Khan
Vs. State of MP & Anr.
rule of continuous prosecution. Where the offence is even broadly satisfied, the court should be
more inclined to permit continuation of prosecution rather than its quashing at that initial stage.
The court is not expected to marshal the records with a view to decide admissibility and reliability of
the documents or records but is an opinion formed prima facie.
27.14. Where the charge-sheet, report under Section 173(2)CrPC, suffers from fundamental legal
defects, the Court may be well within its jurisdiction to frame a charge.
27.15. Coupled with any or all of the above, where the court finds that it would amount to abuse of
process of CrPC or that interest of justice favours, otherwise it may quash the charge. The power is
to be exercised ex debito justitiae i.e. to do real and substantial justice for administration of which
alone, the courts exist.
27.16. These are the principles which individually and preferably cumulatively (one or more) are to
be taken into consideration as precepts to exercise of extraordinary and wide plenitude and
jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code by the High Court. Where the factual foundation for an
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135052453/ 4
Salma Khan vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 24 July, 2019
offence has been laid down, the Court should be reluctant and should not hasten to quash the
proceedings even on the premise that one or two ingredients have not been stated or do not appear
to be satisfied if there is substantial compliance with the requirements of the offence."
11. It has been held by the Apex Court in the case of State of Haryana and others Vs. CH. Bhaiyalal
[AIR 1992 SC 604] that when allegations in the complaint clearly constitute cognizable offence, then
quashing of FIR is not justified. Similarly, in the case of State of Orissa and another vs. Saroj Kumar
Sahoo [(2006) 2 SCC 272], it has been observed that inherent powers are to be exercised sparingly
and that too
-( 7 )- MCRC No.15828/2019 & MCRC No.12252/2019 Prakash Singh Vs. State of MP & Salma Khan
Vs. State of MP & Anr.
in the rarest of rare cases and the High Courts should not embark upon an inquiry as to reliability of
evidence to sustain the allegations, which is the function of the trial Court.
12. Truthfulness or falsehood of allegations made by the complainant in his complaint is to be
established by evidence to be produced before the trial Court and only looking to the FIR it cannot
be inferred that prima facie no case is made out against the present applicant.
Therefore, in the case in hand, there is no question of invoking inherent powers vested in this Court
under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. for quashing of FIR.
13. In view of the aforesaid discussion, looking to the offences charged against the applicant, I am of
the view that no ground is made out for quashing the FIR. The petition (M.Cr.C. No. 15828/2019)
filed under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. sans substance and is hereby dismissed being devoid of merit.
14. In this petition the complainant has sought following relief:-
"It is therefore, most humbly prayed that this Hon'ble Court may kindly be pleased to
allow this petition and pleased to direct the non-applicant to conduct the fair and
impartial investigation of Crime No. 260/2018 for offence under section 366, 511 of
IPC registered at P.S. Madhoganj, District Gwalior."
15. It is contended by counsel for the petitioner/complainant that the action on the part of police is
highly objectionable because the police had not registered case against the accused under the
POCSO Act. It is
-( 8 )- MCRC No.15828/2019 & MCRC No.12252/2019 Prakash Singh Vs. State of MP & Salma Khan
Vs. State of MP & Anr.
further pleaded that even after registration of FIR they are not taking any action against the culprits.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135052453/ 5
Salma Khan vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 24 July, 2019
16. It would not be out of place to mention here that Misc. Criminal No. 15828/2019 filed by
applicant-accused Rakesh Singh has been dismissed by this order.
17. The Supreme Court in the case of D.Venkatasubramaniam v. M.K. Mohan Krishnamachari
reported in (2009) 10 SCC 488 has held as under :-
''19. The High Court, within a period of one month from the date of filing of the
petition, finally disposed of the same observing that, "it is obligatory on the part of
the respondent police to conduct investigation in accordance with law, including
recording of statements from witnesses, arrest, seizure of property, perusal of various
documents and filing of chargesheet. It is also needless to state that if any account is
available with the accused persons, or any amount is in their possession and any
account is maintained in a nationalised bank, it is obligatory on the part of the
respondent police to take all necessary steps to safeguard the interest of the aggrieved
persons in this case".
The Court accordingly directed the police to expedite and complete the investigation
within six months from the date of receipt of a copy of the order. The said order of the
High Court is impugned in these appeals.
****
25. It is the statutory obligation and duty of the police to investigate into the crime
and the courts normally ought not to interfere and guide the investigating agency as
to in what manner the investigation has to proceed. In
-( 9 )- MCRC No.15828/2019 & MCRC No.12252/2019 Prakash Singh Vs. State of MP
& Salma Khan Vs. State of MP & Anr.
M.C. Abraham v. State of Maharashtra (2003) 2 SCC 649 this Court observed: (SCC pp. 657-58,
para 14) "14. ... Section 41 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides for arrest by a police officer
without an order from a Magistrate and without a warrant. The section gives discretion to the police
officer who may, without an order from a Magistrate and even without a warrant, arrest any person
in the situations enumerated in that section. It is open to him, in the course of investigation, to
arrest any person who has been concerned with any cognizable offence or against whom reasonable
complaint has been made or credible information has been received, or a reasonable suspicion exists
of his having been so concerned. Obviously, he is not expected to act in a mechanical manner and in
all cases to arrest the accused as soon as the report is lodged. In appropriate cases, after some
investigation, the investigating officer may make up his mind as to whether it is necessary to arrest
the accused person. At that stage the court has no role to play.
Since the power is discretionary, a police officer is not always bound to arrest an accused even if the
allegation against him is of having committed a cognizable offence. Since an arrest is in the nature of
an encroachment on the liberty of the subject and does affect the reputation and status of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135052453/ 6
Salma Khan vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 24 July, 2019
citizen, the power has to be cautiously exercised. It depends inter alia upon the nature of the offence
alleged and the type of persons who are accused of having committed the cognizable offence.
Obviously, the power has to be exercised with caution and circumspection."
**** **********
31. The High Court, without recording any reason whatsoever, directed the police that it is
obligatory on their part to record statements from witnesses, arrest, seizure of property and
-( 10 )- MCRC No.15828/2019 & MCRC Prakash Singh Vs. State of MP & Salma Khan Vs. State of
MP & Anr.
filing of charge sheet. It is difficult to discern as to how such directions resulting in far reaching
consequences could have been issued by the High Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under Section
482 of the Code. The High Court interfered with the investigation of crime which is within the
exclusive domain of the police by virtually directing the police to investigate the case from a
particular angle and take certain steps which the police depending upon the evidence collected and
host of other circumstances may or may not have attempted to take any such steps in its discretion.
32. It is not necessary that every investigation should result in arrest, seizure of the property and
ultimately in filing of the charge sheet. The police, in exercise of its statutory power coupled with
duty, upon investigation of a case, may find that a case is made out requiring it to file charge sheet or
may find that no case as such is made out. It needs no reiteration that the jurisdiction under Section
482 of the Code conferred on the High Court has to be exercised sparingly, carefully and with
caution only where such exercise is justified by the test laid down in the provision itself.
33. Yet another aspect of the matter, the appellants have not been impleaded as party respondents
in the criminal petition in which the whole of the allegations are levelled against them. The High
Court never thought it fit to put the appellants on notice before issuing appropriate directions to the
police to arrest, seize the property and file charge sheet. This Court in Divine Retreat Centre V. State
of Kerala & Ors. (2008) 3 SCC 542 observed:
(SCC p.565, para 51) "51..........We are concerned with the question as to whether the
High Court could have passed a judicial order directing investigation against the
appellant and its activities without providing an opportunity of being heard to it. The
case on
-( 11 )- MCRC No.15828/2019 & MCRC Prakash Singh Vs. State of MP & Salma Khan
Vs. State of MP & Anr.
hand is a case where the criminal law is directed to be set in motion on the basis of the allegations
made in anonymous petition filed in the High Court. No judicial order can ever be passed by any
court without providing a reasonable opportunity of being heard to the person likely to be affected
by such order and particularly when such (2008) 3 SCC 542 order results in drastic consequences of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135052453/ 7
Salma Khan vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 24 July, 2019
affecting one's own reputation."
(emphasis is of ours)
34. The High Court in the present case, without realizing the consequences, issued directions in a
casual and mechanical manner without hearing the appellants. The impugned order is a nullity and
liable to be set aside only on that score.
******* **********
36.The power under Section 482 of the Code can be exercised by the High Court either suo motu or
on an application (i) to secure the ends of justice; (ii) the High Court may make such orders as may
be necessary to give effect to any order under the Code; (iii) to prevent abuse of the process of any
Court. There is no other ground on which the High Court may exercise its inherent power.
37. In the present case, the High Court did not record any reasons whatsoever why and for what
reasons, the matter required its interference. The High Court is not expected to make any casual
observations without having any regard to the possible consequences that may ensue from such
observations.
Observations coming from the higher Courts may have their own effect of influencing the course of
events and process of law. For that reason, no uncalled for observations are to be made while
disposing of the matters and that too without hearing the persons likely to be affected. The case on
hand is itself a classic illustration as to how such observations could
-( 12 )- MCRC No.15828/2019 & MCRC Prakash Singh Vs. State of MP & Salma Khan Vs. State of
MP & Anr.
result in drastic and consequences of far reaching in nature. We wish to say no more.
******* *********
42. For the aforesaid reasons, we find it difficult to sustain the impugned judgment of the High
Court. Leave granted. The appeals are accordingly allowed and the impugned order is set aside. ''
18. Thus, the High Court in exercise of power under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. cannot supervise the
investigation.
19. Section 173 (1) of Cr.P.C. reads as under:-
"173. Report of police officer on completion of investigation.-- (1) Every investigation
under this Chapter shall be completed without unnecessary delay."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135052453/ 8
Salma Khan vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 24 July, 2019
20. Thus, it is the mandate of law that the investigation should be completed without any
unnecessary delay. As per the application, the FIR was lodged in the year 2018.
21. Under these circumstances, the petition filed by the complainant is disposed of with a direction
that the police would conclude the investigation as early as possible and would file the final report /
closure report / charge-sheet in accordance with law without any unnecessary delay.
22. With aforesaid observations, M.Cr.C. No. 12252/2019 is hereby disposed of.
