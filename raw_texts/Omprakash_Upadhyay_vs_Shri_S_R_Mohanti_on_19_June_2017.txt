Omprakash Upadhyay vs Shri S.R. Mohanti on 19 June, 2017
IN MATTERS NOTIFIED AT SERIAL NOS.1001 to 1020, 1021 to 1040, 1041 to 1060, 1061 to
1080, 1081 to 1100, 1101 to 1120, 1121 to 1140, 1141 to 1160 and 1161 to 1163 ON THE
BOARD DATED 19.06.2017 DUE TO NON−COMPLIANCE OF COURT ORDER
19.06.2017
The Court proposes to pass this common conditional order to obviate passing of identical
conditional order in these matters involving similar office objection/default.
In all these matters, due to non−removal of office objection within the prescribed time as
per the Rules, the concerned matter was placed before the Registrar in the first instance. The
Registrar granted sufficient time to the petitioner(s)/applicant(s)/appellant(s) to cure the
defect/office objection, however, due to non−removal of office objection/default within the
prescribed time, the concerned matter was required to be once again listed before the Court. The
Court granted further time, by passing common order on the earlier occasion.
Inspite of repeated opportunity (three times−one under Rules, second by the Registrar and
third by Court), the petitioner(s)/applicant(s)/appellant(s) has failed to cure the office
objection/default. As a result, by way of indulgence and last opportunity, in terms of this order,
SIX WEEKS' further time is granted to the petitioner(s)/applicant(s)/appellant(s) in the respective
matters to remove office objection/default and make the matter ready for further hearing within
that time, failing which the concerned petition/application/appeal shall stand dismissed for non−
prosecution without further reference to the Court.
Provided, however, in cases, where the objection/default is about non−service of any
of the respondent, on expiry of the extended period, the concerned matter will stand
dismissed for non−prosecution only against the unserved respondent(s), without further
reference to the Court. The matter would then proceed against the remaining respondent(s).
In cases where the office objection/default has already been cured before passing of this order, it
will be open to the concerned party to bring that fact to the notice of the Registrar
(Judicial−II), who may examine the same and proceed with the matter as per the listing /scheme, if
ready for hearing.
If the office objections are removed within the time extended in terms of this order, the
concerned matter(s) be made returnable on the date notified hereafter.
