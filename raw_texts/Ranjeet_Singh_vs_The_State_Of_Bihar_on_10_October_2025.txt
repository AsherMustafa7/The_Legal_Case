Ranjeet Singh vs The State Of Bihar on 10 October, 2025
and Sessions Judge VI, Kaimur at Bhabhua in POCSO Case No.
16 of 2021, arising out of Mahila P.S. Case No. 30 of 2021
whereby Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 have been acquitted by the
learned trial Court from the charge of Sections 363/34, 341/34,
323/34, 376D of Indian Penal Code and Section 6 of the
POCSO Act.
2. The prosecution case, in brief, is that the victim girl
has alleged that she is 17 years old and is resident of Sarai,
Ramgarh. Further, it is stated that on May 14, 2021, at 8:00 am,
her friend Khusbhoo Kumari called her near the Daitra Baba
tree outside the village and she went there to meet her and was
talking to her friend. Suddenly, a four-wheeler car came there
and the people sitting in it forcibly made her sit in the car. No
one could hear her voice as the glass of the car was closed.
When she looked inside the car, Aniket Singh alias Golu and
Dhiraj Singh alias Pinku were sitting in it. They took her to a
secluded place around the Kudra petrol pump and raped her and
asked her not to tell anyone. Somehow, on 15 May 2021, she
escaped from the grip of these people and went to the petrol
pump located at Kudra Bypass. Her family members who had
been searching for her reached there. In the meantime, Aniket
and Dhiraj also followed her to the petrol pump. From there, her

family members caught them (both accused) and brought them

to Ramgarh police station, but Dhiraj managed to escape.
3. On the basis of written statement of the informant,
Mahila P.S. Case No. 30 of 2021 was instituted under Sections
323, 341, 363, 376/34 of Indian Penal Code and Section 4 of the
POCSO Act and investigation was taken up by the police. The
police after investigation submitted charge-sheet against
Respondent Nos. 2 and 3, accordingly, cognizance was taken.
Thereafter the case was committed to the Court of Sessions.
Charges were framed against the accused persons to which they
pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.
4. During the trial, the prosecution examined
altogether ten prosecution witnesses i.e. PW1- Ranjeet Singh,
PW2- the victim herself, PW3- Nitu Devi, PW4- Pinki Devi,
PW5- Ajay Kumar Singh, PW6- Pramod Singh, PW7- Deepak

produced certain documents which were marked as 'Exhibits'
i.e., Ext. D1- Entries on the admission register of Utkramit

accused persons were recorded under Section 313 Cr.P.C. and after conclusion of trial, learned trial
Court has acquitted the accused persons.
5. The learned trial Court on the basis of the materials available on record, and the evidence
produced before the Court, acquitted the accused persons observing that there is no evidence at all
against the accused persons to prove the charge framed u/s 341 and 323 IPC. Likewise the charges
u/s 363 would also not be applicable as the prosecution has failed to prove that the victim is below
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/176899946/ 4
Ranjeet Singh vs The State Of Bihar on 10 October, 2025
18 years at the time of occurrence, hence POCSO would also not be applicable. The trial Court also
observed that the elopement of the victim is voluntary, and even presuming the culpability of the
accused persons in it, the facts of forceful compulsion or inducement by any deceitful means have
not been proved.
6. Learned counsel for the appellant has submitted Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.69 of 2024
dt.10-10-2025 that the learned trial Court has miserably failed to scrutinize the evidence of
interested defence witnesses and court witnesses with care and circumspection and it is pertinent to
state that the conclusion arrived by the learned trial Court is perverse and against the evidence on
record.
7. The learned counsel for the State has submitted that there is no perversity in the judgment of the
learned trial Court, and the prosecution has failed to prove the guilt of the accused before the
learned trial Court. Therefore, the order of the learned trial Court requires no interference in the
present case.
8. We have heard learned counsel for the appellant and the State and have also gone through the
records of the case.
9. The sole question that requires consideration by this Court is whether the impugned judgment
requires any interference by this Court.
10. After a meticulous evaluation of the oral and documentary evidence adduced by the prosecution
and the defence, this Court finds several material deficiencies that cast serious doubt on the
prosecution's version of events.
11. It is revealed from the testimony of the Investigating Officer (PW10) that the place of occurrence
could not be established with certainty. No independent witness has Patna High Court CR. APP
(DB) No.69 of 2024 dt.10-10-2025 corroborated the prosecution's claim regarding the alleged site of
the incident. The law is well-settled that failure to establish the exact place of occurrence creates a
fatal gap in the chain of circumstances In this regard, reliance may be placed on the judgment of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in Syed Ibrahim vs. State of Andhra Pradesh reported in (2006) 10 SCC 601,
wherein it was held in Paragraph No. 11 as under:
"11.....But there is another significant factor which completely destroys the
prosecution version and the credibility of PW 1 as a witness. He has indicated four
different places to be the place of occurrence. In his examination-in-chief he stated
that the occurrence took place in his house. In the cross-examination he stated that
the incident took place at the house of his wife, the deceased's mother. This is a very
important factor considering the undisputed position and in fact the admission of PW
1 that he and his wife were separated nearly two decades ago, and that he was not on
visiting terms with his wife. Then the question would automatically arise as to how in
spite of strained relationship he could have seen the occurrence as alleged in the
house of his wife. That is not the end of the matter. In his cross-examination he
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/176899946/ 5
Ranjeet Singh vs The State Of Bihar on 10 October, 2025
further stated that the incident happened in the small lane in front of the house of his
wife. This is at clear variance with the statement that the occurrence took place inside
the house where allegedly he, the deceased, his son, PW 2 and daughters, PWs 3 and
6 were present. That is not the final say of the witness. He accepted that in the FIR
(Ext. P-1) he had stated the place of occurrence to be the house of the deceased.
Though the FIR is not a substantive evidence yet, the same can be used to test the
veracity of the witness. PW 1 accepted that what was stated in the FIR was correct.
When the place of occurrence itself has not been established Patna High Court CR.
APP (DB) No.69 of 2024 dt.10-10-2025 it would not be proper to accept the
prosecution version."
12. Further, no incriminating material was recovered from the alleged spot. Neither any torn
clothing, semen stain, nor sign of struggle was found. In Kali Ram vs. State of Himachal Pradesh
reported in (1973) 2 SCC 808 , the Supreme Court reiterated that where two views are possible, the
one favouring the accused must be adopted, especially when corroborative evidence is lacking, as
observed in Paragraph No. 25 of the judgment which reads as under :
"25. Another golden thread which runs through the web of the administration of
justice in criminal cases is that if two views are possible on the evidence adduced in
the case, one pointing to the guilt of the accused and the other to his innocence, the
view which is favourable to the accused should be adopted. This principle has a
special relevance in cases wherein the guilt of the accused is sought to be established
by circumstantial evidence. Rule has accordingly been laid down that unless the
evidence adduced in the case is consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the
accused and is inconsistent with that of his innocence, the Court should refrain from
recording a finding of guilt of the accused. It is also an accepted rule that in case the
Court entertains reasonable doubt regarding the guilt of the accused, the accused
must have the benefit of that doubt. Of course, the doubt regarding the guilt of the
accused should be reasonable; it is not the doubt of a mind which is either so
vacillating that it is incapable of reaching a firm conclusion or so timid that is is
hesitant and afraid to take things to their natural consequences. The rule regarding
the Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.69 of 2024 dt.10-10-2025 benefit of doubt
also does not warrant acquittal of the accused by report to surmises, conjectures or
fanciful considerations. As mentioned by us recently in the case of State of Punjab v.
Jagir Singh [(1974) 3 SCC 227 : 1973 SCC (Cri) 886] a criminal trial is not like a fairy
tale wherein one is free to give flight to one's imagination and phantasy. It concerns
itself with the question as to whether the accused arraigned at the trial is guilty of the
offence with which he is charged. Crime is an event in real life and is the product of
interplay of different human emotions. In arriving at the conclusion about the guilt of
the accused charged with the commission of a crime, the Court has to judge the
evidence by the yardstick of probabilities, its intrinsic worth and the animus of
witnesses. Every case in the final analysis would have to depend upon its own facts.
Although the benefit of every reasonable doubt should be given to the accused, the
Courts should not at the same time reject evidence which is ex facie trustworthy on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/176899946/ 6
Ranjeet Singh vs The State Of Bihar on 10 October, 2025
grounds which are fanciful or in the nature of conjectures."
13. The medical examination report prepared by PW9, categorically states that no signs of recent
sexual intercourse or physical assault were found. The doctor opined that there was no external or
internal injury on the body of the victim.
14. Additionally, the mobile location records produced by the Investigating Officer indicate that the
prosecutrix was in contact with the accused prior to the alleged occurrence. Such evidence
introduces an element of consent and weakens the prosecution's claim of forcible intercourse. The
Supreme Court in Deepak Gulati vs. State of Haryana reported in (2013) 7 Patna High Court CR.
APP (DB) No.69 of 2024 dt.10-10-2025 SCC 675 observed that a prior relationship and continuous
contact between the prosecutrix and the accused are significant factors in determining the
genuineness of allegations, as observed in Paragraph No. 21 of the judgment which reads as under:
"21. Consent may be express or implied, coerced or misguided, obtained willingly or
through deceit. Consent is an act of reason, accompanied by deliberation, the mind
weighing, as in a balance, the good and evil on each side. There is a clear distinction
between rape and consensual sex and in a case like this, the court must very carefully
examine whether the accused had actually wanted to marry the victim, or had mala
fide motives, and had made a false promise to this effect only to satisfy his lust, as the
latter falls within the ambit of cheating or deception. There is a distinction between
the mere breach of a promise, and not fulfilling a false promise. Thus, the court must
examine whether there was made, at an early stage a false promise of marriage by the
accused; and whether the consent involved was given after wholly understanding the
nature and consequences of sexual indulgence. There may be a case where the
prosecutrix agrees to have sexual intercourse on account of her love and passion for
the accused, and not solely on account of misrepresentation made to her by the
accused, or where an accused on account of circumstances which he could not have
foreseen, or which were beyond his control, was unable to marry her, despite having
every intention to do so. Such cases must be treated differently. An accused can be
convicted for rape only if the court reaches a conclusion that the intention of the
accused was mala fide, and that he had clandestine motives."
15. In view of these infirmities namely; non-recovery Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.69 of 2024
dt.10-10-2025 of incriminating material, negative medical report, inconsistency regarding the place
of occurrence, and evidence of prior contact between the parties, this Court is of the considered
opinion that the prosecution has failed to establish the charge beyond reasonable doubt.
Accordingly, the accused is entitled to the benefit of doubt.
16. We find that the findings recorded by the learned trial Court do not suffer from any illegality and
perversity. In a criminal case, it is incumbent upon the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused
beyond the shadow of a reasonable doubt. Wherever, any doubt is cast upon the case of the
prosecution, the accused is entitled to the benefit of doubt.

Ranjeet Singh vs The State Of Bihar on 10 October, 2025
17. In criminal appeal against acquittal what the Appellate Court has to examine is whether the
finding of the learned Court below is perverse and prima facie illegal. Once the Appellate Court
comes to the finding that the grounds on which the judgment is based is not perverse, the scope of
appeal against acquittal is limited considering the fact that the legal presumption about the
innocence of the accused is further strengthened by the finding of the Court. At this point, it is
imperative to consider the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Mrinal Das vs. State
of Tripura reported in Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.69 of 2024 dt.10-10-2025 (2011) 9 SCC
479, Paragraph Nos. 13 & 14 of which read as under:
"13. It is clear that in an appeal against acquittal in the absence of perversity in the
judgment and order, interference by this Court exercising its extraordinary
jurisdiction, is not warranted. However, if the appeal is heard by an appellate court, it
being the final court of fact, is fully competent to reappreciate, reconsider and review
the evidence and take its own decision. In other words, the law does not prescribe any
limitation, restriction or condition on exercise of such power and the appellate court
is free to arrive at its own conclusion keeping in mind that acquittal provides for
presumption in favour of the accused. The presumption of innocence is available to
the person and in criminal jurisprudence every person is presumed to be innocent
unless he is proved guilty by the competent court. If two reasonable views are
possible on the basis of the evidence on record, the appellate court should not disturb
the findings of acquittal.
14. There is no limitation on the part of the appellate court to review the evidence
upon which the order of acquittal is found and to come to its own conclusion. The
appellate court can also review the conclusion arrived at by the trial court with
respect to both facts and law. While dealing with the appeal against acquittal
preferred by the State, it is the duty of the appellate court to marshal the entire
evidence on record and only by giving cogent and adequate reasons set aside the
judgment of acquittal. An order of acquittal Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.69 of
2024 dt.10-10-2025 is to be interfered with only when there are "compelling and
substantial reasons" for doing so. If the order is "clearly unreasonable", it is a
compelling reason for interference.........."
18. In the case of Ghurey Lal vs. State of Uttar Pradesh reported in (2008) 10 SCC 450 in Paragraph
No. 75, the Hon'ble Supreme Court reiterated the said view and observed as under:
"75. The trial Court has the advantage of watching the demeanour of the witnesses
who have given evidence, therefore, the appellate court should be slow to interfere
with the decisions of the trial court. An acquittal by the trial court should not be
interfered with unless it is totally perverse or wholly unsustainable."
19. Thus, an order of acquittal is to be interfered with only for compelling and substantial reasons.
In case if the order is clearly unreasonable, it is a compelling reason for interference. But where
there is no perversity in the finding of the impugned judgment of acquittal, the Appellate Court must
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/176899946/ 8
Ranjeet Singh vs The State Of Bihar on 10 October, 2025
not take a different view only because another view is possible. It is because the trial Court has the
privilege of seeing the demeanour of witnesses and, therefore, its decision must not be upset in
absence of strong and compelling grounds.
20. In view of the above, we do not find any illegality Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.69 of 2024
dt.10-10-2025 and perversity in the findings recorded by the Trial Court.
21. Accordingly, the present appeal is dismissed.
22. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
