The applicants are in custody since 18.04.2021. The allegation against the applicants is one of
black-marketing of Remdesivir Injection. It is alleged that during the peak of COVID-19 Virus, the
applicants were found in possession of Remdesivir Injection, which they intended to sell at a higher

Criminal Case No.33423/2021, one Remedesivir Injection was found and from the possession of
applicant Kavita in Miscellaneous Criminal Case No.32468/2021, another such injection was
recovered.
Shri Rishi Tiwari, learned counsel for the applicants has submitted that the applicants have been
falsely implicated in the case, as the applicants Bhupendra and Shubham who are real brothers,
were found in joint possession of Remedesivir Injections which were purchased by them for the
purpose of their family members who were suffering from COVID-19 Virus, hence on 01.04.2021
and 02.04.2021, eighteen Remedesivir Injections were purchased from Shanti Medical Store, G-27,
Dawa Bazar, 13-14 RNT Marg, Indore vide Annexure A/8 and in the Invoice of which, batch number
of injection (Vial) is also mentioned and from the possession of applicant, one Remedesivir Injection
of the same batch number has been recovered.

A/6 along with their medical prescription slip as Annexure A/7.
Counsel has also submitted that even otherwise, the maximum sentence under Section 188 of IPC is
one month only whereas the applicants are in jail since almost three months and the final
conclusion of the trial is likely to take sufficiently long time, despite the fact that the charge sheet
has already been filed. It is further submitted that the offence registered against the applicant is
triable by Judicial Magistrate First Class.
Shri Anil Malviya, learned counsel for applicant Kavita in Miscellaneous Criminal Case
No.32468/2021 has also submitted that she has been falsely implicated in the case, as she has been
arraigned on the basis of memo prepared under Section 27 of the Evidence Act by the main accused
Nilesh Chouhan s/o Ghanshyam Chouhan. So far as recovery of Remedesivir I.V. Injection is
concerned, it is submitted that the applicant is a Diploma Holder in General Nursing MCRC

Hospital only (Managed by Gokuldas Hospital).
Thus, counsel for the applicants have submitted that the applicants, who are in jail since 18.04.2021,
be released on bail and their bail applications be allowed.

(Annexure A/5).

which has been filed by the counsel for the applicants in Miscellaneous Criminal Case
No.33423/2021 as Annexure A/9), this Court finds force with the contention raised by the counsel
for the applicants and taking into account the period of incarceration of the applicants and the
nature MCRC Nos.33423 & 32468 of 2021 of the allegations leveled against the applicants, this
