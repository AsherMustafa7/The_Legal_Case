Applicant :- Faheem @ Faheem Khan And 5 Others
Opposite Party :- State of U.P. and Another
Counsel for Applicant :- Manoj Pandey
Counsel for Opposite Party :- G.A.
Hon'ble Vinod Diwakar,J.
1. Heard learned counsel for the applicants, learned A.G.A. for the State, and perused the entire
record.
2. This application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. has been filed with a prayer to quash the charge-sheet
dated 16.12.2015, cognizance order dated 29.01.2016 passed by learned Special Judge, Gangster
Act/Additional District Judge, Moradabad as well as entire proceedings of S.T. No. 39 of 2016 titled

Section 3(1) of U.P. Gangsters and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act, 1986, at P.S. Sambhal,

against the applicants on the basis of two cases shown in Gang Chart, i.e. (i) case crime no.493 of

Faheem @ Faheem Khan And 5 Others vs State Of U.P. And Another on 3 March, 2025
Crime No. 435 of 2015, under Sections 304, 286, 427 I.P.C. and Section 3, 4, 5, 6 of Explosive
Substances Act and Section 9-B of Arms Act, P.S. Sambhal, District Sambhal. Learned counsel
further submits that the applicants have been acquitted in the aforesaid cases vide order dated
04.11.2019 passed by Sessions Judge, Sambhal and order dated 25.07.2024 passed by Sessions
Judge, Sambhal, respectively, therefore, there remain absolutely no basis to initiate and continue
the instant proceedings, hence the proceedings of instant case are liable to be quashed.
4. Per contra, learned A.G.A. has opposed the application, but could not dispute the submissions
raised by the learned counsel for the applicants.
5. In the instant case, perusal of record shows that the proceedings under Gangster Act were
initiated against the applicants mainly on the basis of aforesaid cases, in which the applicants had
already been acquitted by the trial Court. The case of the applicants is that as the very basis of
initiating proceedings under Gangster Act stand vanished and thus, the impugned proceedings
under Gangster Act cannot be continued. At this stage it would be pertinent to mention that recently
in case of Farhana Versus State of U. P., SLP (Crl.) No.437 of 2023, decided on 19.2.2024, the
Supreme Court held as under:
"12. From a bare perusal of Section 2(b)(i) of the Gangsters Act, it would become
apparent that the person alleged to be the member of the gang should be found
indulging in anti-social activities which would be covered under the offences
punishable under Chapters XVI, or XVII or XXII IPC. There is no dispute that the
case set up by the prosecution against the appellants insofar as the offences under the
Gangsters Act are concerned, is limited to Section 2(b)(i) reproduced supra and none
of the other clauses of the provision have been pressed into service for the proposed
prosecution.
13. Needless to say that for framing a charge for the offence under the Gangsters Act
and for continuing the prosecution of the accused under the above provisions, the
prosecution would be required to clearly state that the appellants are being
prosecuted for any one or more offences covered by anti-social activities as defined
under Section 2(b).
14. There being no dispute that in the proceedings of the sole FIR registered against
the appellants for the offences under Chapter XVII IPC being Crime Case No. 173 of
2019, the appellants stand exonerated with the quashing of the said FIR by the High
Court of Judicature at Allahabad by exercising the powers under Section 482 of Code
of Criminal Procedure, 1973, vide order dated 3rd March, 2023 passed in Application
No. 7228 of 2023.
15. Hence, the very foundation for continuing the prosecution of the appellants under
the provisions of the Gangsters Act stands struck off and as a consequence, the
continued prosecution of the appellants for the said offence is unjustified and
tantamounts to abuse of the process of Court.

16. As a consequence of the discussion made herein above, the impugned orders
dated 14th November, 2022 and 6th December, 2022 passed by the High Court of
Judicature at Allahabad are quashed and set aside. Resultantly, the impugned FIR
being Crime Case No.424 of 2022 for offence punishable under Section 3(1) of the
Gangsters Act, registered at Police Station- Bhognipur, District- Kanpur Dehat and
all the proceedings sought to be taken thereunder against the appellants are hereby
quashed.
17. The appeals are allowed accordingly"
6. From the aforesaid pronouncement of the Supreme Court, it appears that in aforesaid case the
proceedings under Gangster Act were initiated on the basis of two criminal cases, which were
quashed by the High Court and it was observed by the Supreme Court that since the very foundation
of continuing the prosecution of the appellants under the provisions of Gangster Act stand struck off
and consequently continuing prosecution of the appellant for offence under Gangster Act is
unjustified and tantamount to the abuse of the process of the Court. The said case law is squarely
applicable to facts of the present case. In the instant matter also, the proceedings of solitary case, on
the basis of which impugned proceedings were initiated, have been quashed and thus, the very basis
of the impugned proceedings stands vanished and receded. Here it would be relevant to mention
that there is no such evidence of any specific incident that the applicants were found indulging in
anti-social activities covered under Chapter XVI, XVII and XXII, so as to bring them within the
purview of Section 2 (b) (i) of the Gangster Act.
7. In view of the aforesaid, particularly considering the fact that in the two cases, on the basis of
which the proceedings under Gangster Act were initiated against the applicants, the applicants had
already been acquitted by the learned trial Court and considering the aforesaid position of law, the
instant criminal proceedings against the applicants for offence under Gangster Act are unjustified
and tantamount to the abuse of the process of the Court, hence the impugned proceedings are liable
to be quashed.
8. Accordingly, entire proceedings of charge-sheet dated 16.12.2015, cognizance order dated
29.01.2016 passed by learned Special Judge, Gangster Act/Additional District Judge, Moradabad as
well as entire proceedings of S.T. No. 39 of 2016 titled as State v. Bashir Khan and Others, arising
out of Case Crime No. 535 of 2015, registered under Section 3(1) of U.P. Gangsters and Anti-Social
Activities (Prevention) Act, 1986, at P.S. Sambhal, District Sambhal, against the applicants, are
hereby quashed.
9. Application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. is allowed.
