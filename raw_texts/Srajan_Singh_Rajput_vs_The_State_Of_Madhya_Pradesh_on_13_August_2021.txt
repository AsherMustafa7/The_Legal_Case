Heard through Video Conferencing.
Mr.Ankit Saxena, learned counsel for the applicant.
Mr.Harish Shukla, learned Panel Lawyer for the respondent/State.
This is first application under Section 439 of Cr.P.C. for grant of bail filed on behalf of applicant who
has been arrested in connection with Crime No.219/2021 registered at Police Station- Ghandinagar,
District- Bhopal (M.P.) for commission of offences under Sections 269 and 270 of the Indian Penal
Code, Sections 53 and 57 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, Section 3 of the Epidemic Diseases
Act, 1897, Sections 3 & 7 of the Essential Commodities Act and Sections 5/13 of the M.P. Drugs
Control Act, 1949.
As per prosecution case, police received information that the applicant was found in unauthorized
possession of one Injection- Remdesivir. Hence, police reached the spot and seized one Injection-
Remdesivir from the applicant.
Learned counsel for the applicant submits that the applicant is innocent and has been falsely
implicated in the crime in question. The applicant is in custody since 07.05.2021.
Co-accused/Gaurav Lodhi has already been released by this Court in M.Cr.C.No.37108/2021 vide
order dated 29.7.2021. In similar circumstances, a Coordinate Bench of this Court vide order dated
14.07.2021 passed in M.Cr.C. 26420/2021 has granted bail to the accused. The trial would take
considerable time. Hence, it is prayed that the applicant be released on bail.
Learned Panel Lawyer for the State has strongly opposed the bail application.
Considering the facts and circumstances of the case as well as keeping 2 MCRC-37666-2021 in view
the principle of parity without commenting on the merits of the case, this application is allowed. It is
directed that Applicant-Srajan Singh Rajput be released on bail on his furnishing a personal bond in
the sum of Rs.40,000/- (Rupees Forty Thousand only) with one solvent surety in the like amount to
the satisfaction of the concerned trial Court for his appearance on the dates so fixed by that Court
during trial.
