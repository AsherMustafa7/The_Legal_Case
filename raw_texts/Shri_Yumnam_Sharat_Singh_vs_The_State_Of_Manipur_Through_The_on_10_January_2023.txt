consider the case of the petitioner for promotion to the post of Revenue Officer, Mayang Imphal

[5] After creation of the said 226 different categories of posts, the
Secretariat (MAHUD) Department wrote a letter dated 19.12.2016 to the Executive Officer of all
Urban Local Bodies conveying the approval of the Government to the regularisation of 128
employees of the Urban Local Bodies in various categories of posts as recommended by the
Screening Committee and as per the Cabinet decision taken on 04.08.2016 subject to the following

regularisation shall be with effect from the date of issue of this letter.

Pursuant to the aforesaid letter dated 19.12.2016 of the Secretariat (MAHUD) Department, the
Executive Officer, MayangImphal Municipal Council, issued the order dated 26.12.2016 regularising
the contract service of the petitioner as Revenue Inspector. In the said order, it is also provided that
the regularisation of the petitioner was subject to the following conditions:-
"(i) The regularisation shall be effective from 19.12.2016.
WP(C) No. 86 of 2019 Page 4
"(ii) The past service shall be reckoned for the purpose of
seniority and pensionary benefits.
"(iii) No arrear shall be paid for the period between initial appointment and
regularisation."
[6] The next promotional posts from the post of Revenue Inspector is the post of Revenue Officer.
Under the Manipur Municipality (Revenue Officer) Recruitment Rules, 1990 (hereinafter referred to
as â€žRecruitment Rules of R.O(cid:129) for short), the method of recruitment is by promotion failing which
by direct recruitment. In case of promotion, Revenue Inspector under the Municipal Board having
at least 10 years regular service in the grade are eligible.
[7] One post of Revenue Officer became vacant in the MayangImphal Municipal Council with effect
from 12.03.2015 due to the promotion of the Officer who was earlier holding the said post.
Subsequently, the Director (MAHUD), Manipur, issued an advertisement dated 17.01.2019 inviting
applications for selection of candidates for direct recruitments to various posts of the Urban Local
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/53019436/ 3
Shri Yumnam Sharat Singh vs The State Of Manipur Through The ... on 10 January, 2023
Bodies of Manipur including one post of Revenue Officer in the Mayang Imphal Municipal Council.
Having been aggrieved by issuance of the said advertisement dated 17.01.2019, the petitioner
challenge the same by filing the present writ petition. [8] Mr. Sh. Athoi Singh, learned counsel for
the petitioner submitted that the petitioner has been rendering service as Revenue Inspector in the
Mayang Imphal Municipal Council with effect from 24.11.2003 till date, for WP(C) No. 86 of 2019
Page 5 the last more than 19 years. Even though the petitioner(cid:129)s service as Revenue Inspector was
regularised only with effect from 19.12.2006, he is entitled to count his past service as qualifying
service for the purpose of promotion to the higher post of Revenue Officer, inasmuch as, his service
was regularised subject to the condition that the past service shall be reckoned for the purpose of
seniority and pensionary benefits. According to the learned counsel, the petitioner is quit eligible for
appointment on promotion to the higher post of Revenue Officer in the Mayang Imphal Municipal
Council and preference had to be given to the petitioner, who is holding the feeder post, prior to
consideration for appointment by direct recruitment. The learned counsel vehemently submitted
that the acts of the respondents in issuing the impugned advertisement before considering the case
of the petitioner for his promotion as provided under the Recruitment Rules of R.O. is very much
arbitrary and illegal and the impugned advertisement is liable to be quashed and set aside. [9] The
learned counsel also submitted that as per section 43 of the Manipur Municipality Act, 1994, the
appointing authority of the Revenue Officer is the Council and not the Director (MAHUD) and that
the Director (MAHUD) has no power or authority to issue the impugned advertisement. The learned
counsel accordingly submitted that as the Director of (MAHUD) has no power or authority to issue
the impugned advertisement, the same is liable to be quashed and set aside.
WP(C) No. 86 of 2019 Page 6 [10] Mr. H. Debendra, learned Government Advocate and Mr. N.
Zequeson, learned Advocate appearing for the respondents submitted that though the petitioner
claimed to have been holding the post of Revenue Inspector continuously with effect from
24.11.2003, the past service rendered by the petitioner prior to regularisation of his service with
effect from 19.12.2016 was only on contract basis as clearly provided in his initial appointment order
and such prior service on contract basis cannot be counted as regular service by any stress of
imagination. It has also been submitted that as the service of the petitioner as Revenue Inspector in
the Mayang Imphal Municipal Council was regularised only with effect from 19.12.2016, the
petitioner has not rendered 10 years regular service and accordingly, he is not eligible for promotion
to the higher post of Revenue Officer as he does not possess the requisite eligibility criteria of having
minimum 10 years of regular service in the cadre of Revenue Inspector. [11] It has also been
submitted by the learned counsel appearing for the respondents that the conditions that the past
service of the petitioner shall be reckoned for the purpose of seniority and pensionary benefits does
not rendered the past services of the petitioner to be on regular basis when it has been specifically
mentioned in the regularisation order that the regularisation of the petitioner is only with effect
from 19.12.2016. It has further been submitted that as there is no eligible person available for
promotion to the post of Revenue Officer, the vacant post of Revenue Officer in the Mayang Imphal
Municipal Council had been advertised for WP(C) No. 86 of 2019 Page 7 filling up by direct
recruitment under the impugned advertisement dated 17.01.2009 as provided under the
Recruitment Rules of R.O. and that the authorities have not committed any illegality or irregularity
in issuing the impugned advertisement and accordingly, the present writ petition is liable to be
dismissed as being devoid of merit.

Shri Yumnam Sharat Singh vs The State Of Manipur Through The ... on 10 January, 2023
[12] I have heard the submissions advanced by the learned counsel appearing for the parties and
also carefully examined the material available on record. As per the relevant provisions of the
Recruitment Rules of R.O., the method of recruitment to the post of Returning Officer is by
promotion, failing which by direct recruitment. In case of promotion, only Revenue Inspector
having 10 years regular service in the grade are eligible to be considered for such promotion. As per
the order dated 26.12.2016 issued by the Executive Officer, Mayang Imphal Municipal Council, the
service of the petitioner was regularised as Revenue Inspector only with effect from 19.12.2016. It
has also been specifically stated by the respondent No. 3 in its additional affidavit-in-opposition
dated 17.10.2022 that there are only two sanction posts of Revenue Inspector existing in the Mayang
Imphal Municipal Council which were newly created by the Secretariat (MAHUD) Department,
Government of Manipur, under its order dated 25.11.2016 pursuant to the State Cabinet decision in
its meeting held on 04.08.2016 and that the petitioner was given regular appointment against one of
the newly created post of Revenue Inspector.
WP(C) No. 86 of 2019 Page 8 [13] On careful examination of the memorandum for Cabinet for
rationalisation of the staffing pattern in the Urban Local Bodies of Manipur which had been
approved by the State Cabinet, the Government order dated 25.11.2016 creating 226 different
categories of posts for the Urban Local Bodies under (MAHUD) Department including two posts of
Revenue Inspector in the Mayang Imphal Municipal Council, the order dated 26.12.2016 issued by
the Executive Officer, Mayang Imphal Municipal Council regularising the service of the petitioner as
Revenue Inspector in the MayangImphal Municipal Council with effect from 19.12.2016 and the
categorical statement made by the respondent No. 3 in the aforesaid additional
affidavit-in-opposition dated 17.10.2022 that there are only two sanction posts of Revenue Inspector
in the Mayang Imphal Municipal Council which are created under the Government(cid:129)s order dated
25.11.2016 and the petitioner had been regularised against one of the said newly created post, it is
clearly revealed that the service of the petitioner can be regularised only with effect from 2016. The
past service rendered by the petitioner as Revenue Inspector on contract basis cannot be counted as
regular service as there was no sanction post of Revenue Inspector in the Mayang Imphal Municipal
Council to accommodate the petitioner prior to issuance of the Government order dated 25.11.2016
which created two posts of Revenue Inspector in the Mayang Imphal Municipal Council. Being faced
with such undisputed facts, this Court is not inclined to accept the submissions advanced on behalf
of the petitioner WP(C) No. 86 of 2019 Page 9 that the past service rendered by the petitioner prior
to his regularisation can be counted as qualifying service for availing promotion to the next higher
post. In my considered view, such a stand will defeat the provisions of the Recruitment Rules of R.O.
[14] With regard to the argument advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the
Director (MAHUD) has no power or authority to issue the impugned advertisement, it is to be
pointed out that there is no provision under Section 43 of the Manipur Municipality Act, 1994
specifying the authority who can issue the advertisement or prohibiting the Director (MAHUD)
from issuing the impugned advertisement. Accordingly this Court is not inclined to interfere with
the impugned advertisement only on this ground.
In view of the above facts and circumstances, this Court do not find any irregularity or illegality
having been committed by the respondents in issuing the impugned advertisement. In the result, the
present writ petition is hereby dismissed as being devoid of merit.
