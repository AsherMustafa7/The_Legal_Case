CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE ASHWANI KUMAR SINGH
ORAL JUDGMENT
Date : 02-05-2019 This application under Article 227 of the Constitution of India has been filed for
quashing the order dated 22.12.2018 passed by the learned Sub-Judge-VIII, Aurangabad in Title
Suit No.302 of 2012 by which an application filed under Order 6 Rule 17 of the Code of Civil
Procedure (for short 'CPC') by the plaintiff-respondents has been allowed but on cost of Rs.1,000/-.
Patna High Court C.Misc. No.305 of 2019 dt.02-05-2019
2. It is submitted by the learned counsel for the defendant-petitioner that the trial court has erred in
law while allowing the amendments sought for by the plaintiffs-respondents.

3. On perusal of the order impugned, it would be evident that the plaintiffs had sought amendment
in the plaint by adding:-
(a) figure "I to III" in the second line of para 1,
(b) to delete figure 551 in schedule no. I and add in its place figure 511,
(c) to add boundaries in the right side of each plot in schedule I to III.
4. The contention of the plaintiffs before the trial court was that due to inadvertence boundaries of
the suit plots as well as schedule I to III in the second line of para 1 had not been mentioned, which
was necessary for the adjudication of the suit. The proposed amendments are formal in nature and
does not change the nature of the suit.
5. The defendant-petitioner contested the matter. He contended that the amendment was sought for
without any basis. No documents in support of amendment had been filed. The boundaries of each
plot sought to be amended by the plaintiffs do not tally with the alleged deed of sale of the plaintiffs.
He contended that it is a settled a principle of law that no amendment should be allowed without
any basis.
Patna High Court C.Misc. No.305 of 2019 dt.02-05-2019
6. On hearing the parties, the trial court found that as far as the amendment sought for is in
schedule I is concerned, the figure 551 has already been deleted earlier and in its place figure 511 has
been inserted. Hence, it required no correction. As far as the other two amendments are concerned,
it held that adding of figure I to III in second line of para in formal in nature and adding of
boundaries in each plot mentioned in schedule I to III is necessary for ascertaining the suit plot and
determining the real point of controversy completely between the parties and the same will not
cause injustice to the defendants.
7. Having held so, the petition filed on behalf of the plaintiff under Order 6 Rule 17 was allowed, vide
impugned order dated 22.12.2018 passed by the trial court passed by the trial court with cost and
defendant has also been given liberty to file additional written statement.
8. It is well settled that while deciding an application for amendment ordinarily the court should not
refuse bona fide, legitimate, honest and necessary amendments.
9. In Pirgonda Hongonda Patil vs. Kalgonda Shidgonda Patil and Ors. [AIR 1957 SC 363], which still
holds the field, it was held that all amendments ought to be allowed which satisfy the two
conditions:-
Patna High Court C.Misc. No.305 of 2019 dt.02-05-2019
(a) of not working injustice to the other side, and

Santosh Kumar Singh vs Smt. Shushila Devi And Ors on 2 May, 2019
(b) of being necessary for the purpose of determining the real questions in
controversy between the parties.
10. Thus, a liberal approach is a general rule particularly in cases where the other side can be
compensated with cost. Moreover, the amendments are allowed in the pleadings to avoid
multiplicity of the litigation.
11. In that view of the matter, since there is no illegality in the order impugned whereby formal and
necessary amendments sought for in the plaint has been allowed, I see no reason to interfere with
the same in exercise of supervisory jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution of India.
12. The application is dismissed.
