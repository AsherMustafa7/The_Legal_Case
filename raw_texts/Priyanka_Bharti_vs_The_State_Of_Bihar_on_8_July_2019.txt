Priyanka Bharti vs The State Of Bihar on 8 July, 2019
ORAL JUDGMENT
Date : 08-07-2019
Patna High Court CWJC No.6030 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019
31/50
The writ petitioners in these batch of writ petitions have
approached this Court being aggrieved by rejection of their
candidature in the selection process conducted by the respondent
Bihar Public Service Commission (hereinafter referred to as 'the
Commission). 64th Bihar Combined Competitive Examination
conducted by the respondent Commission is in issue in the instant
proceedings, for which advertisement was issued on 02.08.2018 for
filling up total 1465 vacancies in different posts under the
Government of Bihar .
The brief facts giving rise to the instant writ proceedings is
that the petitioners applied for consideration in the process of
selection. Altogether there were 4,71,145 applicants. The process of
selection comprised of an objective preliminary examination
comprising of 150 multiple choice questions carrying one mark each.
Successful candidates to the tune of ten times the number of vacancies
were to be selected on the basis of objective preliminary examination
for writing the mains subjective examination.
The Commission for the purpose of evaluation had got
prepared a model answer key by the question setters. After the
preliminary examination, the model answer key was uploaded on the
website on 26.12.2018 and objections were invited from the
candidates who participated in the selection process. Objections

32/50
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/114156833/ 30
Priyanka Bharti vs The State Of Bihar on 8 July, 2019
submitted before the last date i.e. 07.01.2019 were considered by the
expert committee constituted by respondent Commission. The expert
committee modified/corrected the model answer key in respect of
eight questions. In respect of three questions expert committee was of
the opinion that correct answer options were not available or that the
questions answers were likely to cause confusion to examinees and on
such grounds three questions were deleted from the process of
evaluation. The report of the expert committee, was thereafter
approved by the Full Commission in its meeting dated 31.1.2019.
Accordingly, answer sheets were evaluated. Result was published on
23.2.2019
declaring 19109 candidates successful in the general category who had secured the cut off marks, i.e.
97 or more.
The petitioners herein have not been declared successful in the examination. Admittedly all of them
have secured between 1 - 5 marks less than cut off marks 97.
A joint petition was again filed by several candidates thereafter before the Chairman of the
respondent Commission raising the issue regarding correctness of model answer uploaded by the
Commission on the basis of which the evaluation had been done. The Chairman thereafter
reconstituted the expert committee. Model answers were thus reconsidered for the second time. The
Patna High Court CWJC No.6030 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019 reconstituted expert committee found no
error or mistake in the model answer approved by the earlier expert committee.
Some of the candidates, who have not been declared successful in the preliminary test, are
petitioners in the instant writ proceedings. It is their case that model answer key on the basis of
which evaluation has been done was incorrect. It is submitted that they can demonstrate that wrong
has been committed in preparation of the model answer key. The wrong options has been
considered to be the correct answer in the model answer key in respect of some questions. Another
infirmity alleged in the model answer key is that questions have been deleted even though correct
answer options were available. By raising such grievance they submit that on account of glaring
defects in the model answer key which they have urged can be demonstrated as being wrong, the
result published by the Commission for the preliminary examination cannot be sustained. They have
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/114156833/ 31
Priyanka Bharti vs The State Of Bihar on 8 July, 2019
submitted that evaluation in respect of such questions is to their prejudice as they had marked the
answer option which was correct, however since the option marked by the petitioners were not the
correct answer as per the model answer key they have wrongly been deprived of marks for such
questions. It is also the submission of petitioners in some of the cases that questions which have
been deleted by the expert committee contained the correct answer option. Patna High Court CWJC
No.6030 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019 The petitioners had also marked the correct answer. Having
devoted time for answering such questions they have suffered prejudice by deletion of such
questions since by attempting such questions they have lost time in the examination and suffered
due to non grant of marks in respect of the same.
The petitioners, in order illustrate that the model answer key which formed the basis of evaluation
did not contain the correct answer options have relied upon material, which according to them are
authoritative text and government publication. The options declared correct by the expert body is in
conflict with such authoritative text and government publications and as such it is submitted that
the petitioners could not have been deprived of marks for such questions, when answers marked by
the petitioners were correct as per authoritative text and government publication.
It would be relevant to take note of the fact that the same 150 questions were asked from all the
appearing candidates at the preliminary test. The same were arranged/numbered in four different
ways in 4 sets namely set 'A', 'B', 'C' & 'D', to rule out use of unfair means at the examination centre.
Copy of set 'B' of the final/corrected model answer key has been placed on record by the
Commission as Annexure C to its counter affidavit.
Patna High Court CWJC No.6030 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019 This Court would make a note that the
counter affidavit filed by the Commission is common in all the cases.
Referring to question nos. 15, 41, 69, 84, 100, 107, 113, 119, 133 and 134 of set 'B', it is submitted that
model answers for the same are incorrect. It is also submitted that question paper had the correct
answer option for question numbers 118 and 122 of set 'B' and the same have wrongly been deleted.
Referring to the authoritative text and government publication Counsels appearing in the various
cases have strenuously urged that the model answer key does not provide the correct answer for the
above noted questions. One of the questions, on which all the petitioners have laid emphasis is
question No. 133 in the model answer key (Annexure F). The question and model answer provided
for the same are being reproduced for consideration:-
" Where did Kunwar Singh join the Rebellion of 1857 against the British?
(A) Arrah (B) Patna
(C ) Bettiah (D) Varanasi
(E) None of the above/More than one of the above."
Model Answer:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/114156833/ 32
Priyanka Bharti vs The State Of Bihar on 8 July, 2019
Q. No. 133 - In 1857, Babu Kunwar Singh was in contact with sepoys at Dinapore and
even sent emissaries to them to say that he had consented to lead them Patna High
Court CWJC No.6030 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019 (K.K.Dutta, Pg 96-99). Thereafter the
sepoys went to Arrah where they were joined by Kunwar Singh (P 92). The
implication is that Kunwar Singh led the mutiny from Dinapore near Patna, but
physically joined them at Arrah. Therefore the correct answer would be (B)."
The petitioners have straneously urged that the model answer key in respect of the
said question is wrong. It is their submission that even going by reasoning given by
the experts only possible answer would be "Arrah". The expert committee has
wrongly provided answer to be "Patna" in the model answer key.
Another question on which great emphasis was laid was question No. 84 from
Question "A' series which is as follows:-
"114. Bihar as an Indian State was formed in (A) 1911 (B) 1912 (C )1936 (D) 2000 (E)
None of the above/More than one of the above.
Model answer:
"The Province of Orissa was separated from Bihar and Orissa in 1936 and declared a
separate province in Govt. of India Act 1935 which came into force in 1936. When the
Constitution of India Patna High Court CWJC No.6030 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019 was
adopted in 1950, the same area was named Bihar State Instead of Bihar Province.
Hence Correct answer would be (C ).
From bare perusal of the expert opinion and reasoning the same does not call for any
interference.
In respect of question No. 41, objection to its deletion as per report of the expert
committee is clearly unfounded. Question No. 41is:-
"In which city/State was air pollution control system 'VAYU' installed in September
2018?
(A) Chennai (B) Amritsar (C ) Delhi (D) Varanasi (E) None of the above/More than
one of the above.
Model Answer:
"This question was correctly deleted as it was wrong. The official spelling is WAYU
and not VAYU as given in the question. The spelling of capital noun cannot be
disputed on grounds of grammer, logic or publication in media."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/114156833/ 33
Priyanka Bharti vs The State Of Bihar on 8 July, 2019
The question was in respect of installation of Air Pollution Control System which officially is spelled
"WAYU". The answer Patna High Court CWJC No.6030 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019 however referred to
the same system as "VAYU". Such error in spelling has rightly been relied upon by the expert to
delete the question. The same could not have been allowed to continue on the basis of any logic or
publication in the media.
The other objection regarding wrong deletion of question No. 122 by the expert committee is also
clearly unfounded. Question No. 122 is :
"The Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar was confined within the walls of the Red
Fort. He had no power on outside territory. The question asks "
It is said" which is vague and uncertain. The question may be deleted."
The question is about the extent of empire of the Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar. The
expected answer is with reference to a very vague and uncertain basis i.e. "it is said". In view of the
manner in which the question has been framed the expert committee has rightly concluded that the
question is a vague question as it does not specify as to with reference to which authoritative text or
person the expression "it is said" has been understood by the examinees. The question has rightly
been deleted.
Counsel appearing for the petitioners in support of their submissions have relied upon certain
decision of the Apex Court. They have placed heavy reliance on the decision in the case of Ran Vijay
Singh & ors Vs. State of U.P. & ors. reported in (2018) 2 SCC Patna High Court CWJC No.6030 of
2019 dt.08-07-2019
357. They have laid emphasis on para 18, 30, 30.2 and 35 of the said decision. The judgment in the
case of Rajesh Kumar vs. State of Bihar reported in (2013) 4 SCC 690 has also been relied upon by
the petitioners' Counsel. They submitted that the Apex Court has not mandated the "hands of
approach". On the basis of questions brought by way of illustration before this Court and the model
answer key for the same, they submitted that errors in the model answer key are glaring and cannot
be denied or disputed. In respect of the answer which has been taken note of in the instant order by
way of illustration they would further submit that even as per text book relied upon by the
Commission the model answer is wrong. The wrong demonstrated by the petitioners constitute a
material error in terms of para 30.2 of the judgment in the case of Ran Vijay Singh (supra).
Counsels have also relied upon decision of the Apex Court in the case of High Court of Tripura vrs.
Tirtha Sarathi Mukherjee reported in 2019(2) PLJR 114 (SC), decision of Division Bench of this
Court in the case of Akshay Lal Pandit & ors vs. The State of Bihar & ors, as also recent decision by a
Single Judge of this Court in the case of Ashish Kumar Pathak & ors. Vs. The State of Bihar through
its Chief Secretary & ors in the proceedings arising out of CWJC No. 3670 of 2019.
Patna High Court CWJC No.6030 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019 Learned Senior Counsel Mr. Lalit Kishore,
appearing for the respondent Commission, has submitted that the answer considered correct as per
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/114156833/ 34
Priyanka Bharti vs The State Of Bihar on 8 July, 2019
model answer key provided a uniform yardstick for assessing all the candidates. None of the
petitioners can contend that they have been evaluated on a different yardsticks than those who have
qualified at the preliminary test. He has further submitted that the Commission has in the 64th
combined competitive examination taken more than abundant precaution so as to avoid such
disputes being raised by the candidates and to ensure that a fair and transparent evaluation is done.
The Commission had duly published the marks on its website and invited objections from the
candidates. Objections were duly considered by the expert committee constituted for the said
purpose. It is only thereafter that the result of the preliminary test were declared. Even after
publication of result on 23.2.2019, on objections being received, the Chairman in order to rule out
such disputes being raised reconstituted the expert committee to reconsider and revisit the
objections/suggestions submitted by candidates. Based on such objections/suggestions 25 questions
were reconsidered/ revisited by the expert committee by referring to the reliable source/evidence.
The expert committee in spite of such reconsideration found no error/mistake. It is after such
thorough Patna High Court CWJC No.6030 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019 exercise that model answer key
was finalised for evaluation of the candidates.
Because some candidates, referring to some texts or government publications contended that model
answer key is wrong, this Court exercising jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India
should not exercise its jurisdiction. He submits that opinion of the two expert committees based on
authoritative and reliable source/evidence should be preferred as against the opinion of the
candidates based on their claimed authoritative text and government publication. He submits that
parameters for evaluation are fixed and uniform on the basis of the model answer key for all the
candidates. On the basis of same parameters others have succeeded in the process. He also submits
that this Court should not venture to examine as to which answer for which question ought to be
correct; and on the basis of which text or government publication. The issues settled by the expert
committees comprising of academicians should be taken to be correct so as to ensure finality in the
process of examination/selection. If this Court ventures to examine the claims made by the
candidates on different text and government publications then the process of selection would
become endless. The Court exercising jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution should
confine its exercise of judicial review to the process.
Patna High Court CWJC No.6030 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019 In support of his submissions he has relied
upon decisions in the case of Ravindra Kumar Singh vs. High Court of Judicature at Patna & ors
reported in 2016 (1) PLJR 865 (Para 43, 46, 49, 51, 52 and 54), Himachal Pradesh Public Service
Commission vs Mukesh Thakur & anr reported in (2010) 6 SCC 759 (para 20), Ran Vijay Singh &
ors Vs. State of U.P. & ors. reported in (2018) 2 SCC 357 (Para 30, 31, 32 & 35), U.P. Public Service
Commission Vs. Rahul Singh reported in (2018) 7 SCC 254 (para 13).
In relation to deletion of three question he submits that the same effected to all candidates and that
no particular candidate can raise the grievance as the three questions have been deleted for
everyone. In this connection he relies upon a decision in the case of Anshu Ranjan Vs. State of Bihar
through the Chief Secretary & ors. Reported in 2019(1) PLJR 1055 (para 3). He has laid great
emphasis on decision in the case of Ran Vijay Singh (supra) which has recently been taken note of
and considered by a Division Bench of this Court in the case of Kunal Vs. State of Bihar in LPA No.

Priyanka Bharti vs The State Of Bihar on 8 July, 2019
1522 of 2018 on 29.1.2019.
Referring to the judgments cited at the bar, learned Senior Counsel representing the Commission
submits that this Court should refrain from examining the correctness of the model answer key as
this Court is not a super expert.
Patna High Court CWJC No.6030 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019 Having said so, he has made submissions
in respect of questions No. 133 noted hereinabove to submit that the answer option "Patna" as
opined by the expert should not be interferred with. As per the expert committee the answer was to
indicate not physical joining of Babu Kunwar Singh based on which the candidates claimed answer
to be at "Arrah". The expert committee has rightly considered "Patna" to be the correct answer as
Veer Kunwar Singh joined the rebellion in 1857 against the British as he was in contact with Sepoy
at Dinapore and even sent messeries expressing his consent to lead them at Dinapore, which is in
Patna. The effect of his physically joining subsequently at Arrah was rightly not considered to be the
correct answer by the expert committee, which in no manner can be treated to be a possible correct
answer as per the expert committee. View of the expert committee based on such valid
consideration, in opinion of this Court, does not call for any interference.
Having considered the rival submission of the parties and the various judgments cited at the Bar,
this Court would observe that submission of the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the
Commission that this Court should refrain from interferring in such matters has to be considered in
light of the law laid down by the Apex Court in the case of Ran Vijay Singh (supra) and the later
judgment Patna High Court CWJC No.6030 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019 of the Apex Court, considering
the same, i.e. In the case of High Court of Tripura (supra).
After considering the law in the case of Mukesh Thakur (supra), in para 18 of the said judgment that
complete hands off approach, or no interference approach has not been suggested, the Apex Court
has highlighted a few significant conclusions in para 30 of the judgment in the case of Ran Vijay
Singh (supra) which reads as follows:-
30. The law on the subject is therefore, quite clear and we only propose to highlight a few significant
conclusions. They are:
30.1. If a statute, Rule or Regulation governing an examination permits the
re-evaluation of an answer sheet or scrutiny of an answer sheet as a matter of right,
then the authority conducting the examination may permit it;
30.2. If a statute, Rule or Regulation governing an examination does not permit
re-evaluation or scrutiny of an answer sheet (as distinct from prohibiting it) then the
court may permit re-
evaluation or scrutiny only if it is demonstrated very clearly, without any "inferential process of
reasoning or by a process of rationalisation" and only in rare or exceptional cases that a material
error has been committed;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/114156833/ 36
Priyanka Bharti vs The State Of Bihar on 8 July, 2019
30.3. The court should not at all re-evaluate or scrutinise the answer sheets of a candidate--it has
Patna High Court CWJC No.6030 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019 no expertise in the matter and academic
matters are best left to academics;
30.4. The court should presume the correctness of the key answers and proceed on that assumption;
and 30.5. In the event of a doubt, the benefit should go to the examination authority rather than to
the candidate.
Para 31 & 32 of the said judgment are also important for the instant case and as such are being
reproduced:-
"31. On our part we may add that sympathy or compassion does not play any role in the matter of
directing or not directing re-evaluation of an answer sheet. If an error is committed by the
examination authority, the complete body of candidates suffers. The entire examination process
does not deserve to be derailed only because some candidates are disappointed or dissatisfied or
perceive some injustice having been caused to them by an erroneous question or an erroneous
answer. All candidates suffer equally, though some might suffer more but that cannot be helped
since mathematical precision is not always possible. This Court has shown one way out of an
impasse -- exclude the suspect or offending question.
32. It is rather unfortunate that despite several decisions of this Court, some of which have been
discussed above, there is interference by the courts in the result of examinations. This Patna High
Court CWJC No.6030 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019 places the examination authorities in an unenviable
position where they are under scrutiny and not the candidates. Additionally, a massive and
sometimes prolonged examination exercise concludes with an air of uncertainty. While there is no
doubt that candidates put in a tremendous effort in preparing for an examination, it must not be
forgotten that even the examination authorities put in equally great efforts to successfully conduct
an examination. The enormity of the task might reveal some lapse at a later stage, but the court
must consider the internal checks and balances put in place by the examination authorities before
interfering with the efforts put in by the candidates who have successfully participated in the
examination and the examination authorities. The present appeals are a classic example of the
consequence of such interference where there is no finality to the result of the examinations even
after a lapse of eight years. Apart from the examination authorities even the candidates are left
wondering about the certainty or otherwise of the result of the examination -- whether they have
passed or not; whether their result will be approved or disapproved by the court; whether they will
get admission in a college or university or not; and whether they will get recruited or not. This
unsatisfactory situation does not work to anybody's advantage and such a state of uncertainty
results in confusion being worse confounded. The overall and larger impact of all this is that public
interest suffers."
Patna High Court CWJC No.6030 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019 On consideration of the law laid down in
the case of Ran Vijay Singh (supra), Apex Court in the case of High Court of Tripura (supra) has
considered the scope and limits for exercise of jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of
India by Writ Courts in examination matters. This Court would consider it useful to quote
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/114156833/ 37
Priyanka Bharti vs The State Of Bihar on 8 July, 2019
paragraphs 20 - 22 which read as follows:-
"20. The question however arises whether even if there is no legal right to demand
revaluation as of right could there arise circumstances which leaves the Court in any
doubt at all. A grave injustice may be occasioned to a writ applicant in certain
circumstances. The case may arise where even though there is no provision for
revaluation it turns out that despite giving the correct answer no marks are awarded.
No doubt this must be confined to a case where there is no dispute about the
correctness of the answer. Further, if there is any doubt, the doubt should be resolved
in favour of the examining body rather than in favour of the candidate. The wide
power under Article 226 may continue to be available even though there is no
provision for revaluation in a situation where a candidate despite having giving
correct answer and about which there cannot be even slightest manner of doubt, he is
treated as having given the wrong answer and consequently the candidate is found
disentitled to any marks.
21. Should the second circumstance be demonstrated to be present before the writ
court, can the writ court become helpless despite the vast reservoir of power Patna
High Court CWJC No.6030 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019 which it possesses? It is one thing
to say that the absence of provision for revaluation will not enable the candidate to
claim the right of evaluation as a matter of right and another to say that in no
circumstances whatsoever where there is no provision for revaluation will the writ
court exercise its undoubted constitutional powers? We reiterate that the situation
can only be rare and exceptional.
22. We would understand therefore the conclusion in paragraph 30.2 which we have
extracted from the judgment in Ran Vijay Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh (2018) 2
SCC 357 only in the aforesaid light. We have already noticed that in V.S. Achuthan v.
Mukesh Thakur's case reported in (2010) 6 SCC 759, a two Judge Bench in paragraph
26 after survey of the entire case law has also understood the law to be that in the
absence of any provision the Court should not generally direct revaluation."
Errors in the model answer keys alleged by the petitioners have to be considered within the law as
laid down by the Apex Court in the case of Ran Vijay Singh (supra) and High Court of Tripura
(supra) taken note of above.
Model answers disputed by the petitioners have been examined by this Court. On the touch stone of
the standards of scrutiny in respect of such academic matters specified in the case of Ran Vijay
Singh (supra) this Court finds that the opinion of the Patna High Court CWJC No.6030 of 2019
dt.08-07-2019 expert body constituted for examining and re-examining the model answers, does
not require any interference.
The action of the Commission in view of the consideration hereinabove cannot be said to be such so
as to cast any doubts on the bonafide of the exercise adopted by them. The model answer key has

been revised/revisited twice by two expert committees comprising of academicians. This Court in an
effort to allow the petitioners to demonstrate a wrong or material error has also examined some
questions and model answers by way of illustration taken note of hereinabove. The strenuous
submissions made on behalf of the petitioners however does not reveal any such material error in
the model answers. The view taken by the expert committee is a possible correct view. Merely
because the candidates feel otherwise or the Counsels are arguing that another view is possible in
respect of model answer on the basis of some text or government publication, this Court would not
interfere with the model answer key.
Having regard to the enormity of the exercise and abundant precaution exercised by the
Commission and the fact that model answer key has been reviewed/ visited twice, this Court placing
reliance on the decision in the case of Ran Vijay Singh (supra) would prefer the view of the expert
committee.
Patna High Court CWJC No.6030 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019 This Court has examined in detail the
model answers to consider the claim of the petitioners regarding model answers being wrong.
Petitioners have not been able to make out any rare or exceptional case and have failed to
demonstrate that material errors has been committed, so as to interfere in the result published or to
issue any directions in favour of the petitioners.
Writ petitioners are dismissed.
