Petitioners : Mr. Th. Ibohal, Sr. Adv.& Mr. Th. Mahira, Adv.
For the respondents : Mr. Lenin Hijam, AG.
Date of Hearing : 27.04.2022.
Date of Judgment &Order : 17.05.2022.
Judgment & Order
[1] Heard Mr. Th. Ibohal, learned senior advocate and Mr. Th.
Mahira, learned advocate appearing for the petitioners. Heard also Mr. Lenin Hijam, learned
Advocate General (AG), Manipur, appearing for the respondents.
The present two writ petitions have been filed with a prayer for quashing the order dated 08.01.2001
passed by the Deputy Commissioner (D.C), Imphal East, in Rev. Misc. Case No. 4 of 2020 and also
the order dated 15.01.2021, passed by the Deputy Commissioner, Imphal East, in Eviction Case No.
1 of 2021. Since the facts and law involved in the two writ petitions are identical, the present two
writ petitions are heard jointly and the same are being disposed of by this common judgment and
order.
[2] The facts of the present cases in a nutshell is that the petitioner in W.P.(C) No. 42 of 2021 and
the petitioner in W.P.(C) No. 46 of 2021 claim that they are the owners and recorded pattadars of
the W.P.(C) No. 42 of 2021 &Anr. Page 2 homestead land under Patta No. 238 (Old), 438 (New) of
C.S. Dag No. 309, 310, 311/812 having an area of 0.28 acre of Village No. 5/Khabam and of the
homestead land under Patta No. 115 (Old), 439/910 (New) of C.S. Dag No. 313/1130 having an area
of 0.08 acre of Village No. 5/Khabam respectively.
[3] It is the case of the petitioners that they are in physical possession of the said land by
constructing wooden structures and carrying on their business. According to the petitioners, the
Sub-Deputy Collector (S.D.C.), Heingang, without giving any notice to the petitioners and behind
their back, carried out an enquiry and submitted a report dated 30.04.2020 to the Sub-Divisional
Officer (S.D.O.), Porompat, Imphal East, stating, inter-alia, that the homestead land of the
petitioners are Government Khas land. On the basis of the aforesaid enquiry report submitted by the
Sub-Deputy Collector, Heingang, the Sub-Divisional Officer, Porompat registered Rev. Misc. Case
No. 7/SDO/P/IE of 2020 and Rev. Misc. Case No. 5/SDO/P/IE of 2020 against the petitioners
respectively for cancellation of the Jamabandi of the petitioners.
[4] The petitioners contested the aforesaid revision cases by filing their written statements and after
hearing the parties, the Sub-Divisional Officer, Porompat disposed of the said cases by an order
dated 12.10.2020, passed in the aforesaid revision cases by holding that he W.P.(C) No. 42 of 2021
&Anr. Page 3 had no jurisdiction to decide the dispute in view of the provisions of section 11 (3) of

the MLR & LR Act, 1960.
[5] After disposal of the aforesaid revision cases, the Deputy Commissioner, Imphal East, registered
a case being Rev. Misc. Case No. 4 of 2020 in his own motion and issued a notice dated 21.11.2020
to the present petitioners stating, inter-alia, that the Patta/Jamabandi of the petitioners were
fraudulently prepared in their names without any allotment order issued by the Government of
Manipur and that the entry of their names in the land records were made fraudulently and illegally
without following the procedure prescribed under the Allotment Act and Rules and without any
prior approval of the Government or the Deputy Commissioner and summoning the petitioners to
appear before him on 30.11.2000 either in-person or by a duly instructed person who will be able to
answer all the material questions relating to the case or otherwise to submit written statement and
to produce witnesses/evidences and documents upon which they intend to rely in support of their
claim.
[6] The petitioners contested the case by filing their respective written statements and by appearing
before the Deputy Commissioner, Imphal East, through their counsel. After hearing the counsel
appearing on behalf of the present petitioners, the Deputy Commissioner, Imphal East, passed an
order on 08.01.2021 in Rev. Misc. Case No. 4 of 2020 W.P.(C) No. 42 of 2021 &Anr. Page 4 in
exercise of the power under MLR & LR Act, 1960 with the following observations and directions:-
" (a) The suit lands covered by C.S. Dag No. 309, 310, 311 & 313 claimed by the Opp.
Parties as C.D. Dag Nos. i) 309, 310, 311/812 ii) 313/1130 iii) 313/853 iv) 853/1498 &
v) 853/1499 are recorded as "State Land"
"Khas Land". And in absence of any allotment order for the same, the respondent
cannot be held to be pattadar of the land.
(b) The Respondents/Objectors are unable to establish how they acquire ownership
without due process of law, particularly in absence of allotment orders by the State
Government and also in absence of duly registered allotment deeds.
(c) State Land, Khas Land etc., can be mutated in the name of an individual only
through land allotment process and the respondents have not produced any such
document from which it can be deduced that allotment process has been duly
completed.
(d) The so called mutation Orders in respect of the disputed Patta could not be
produced as the said Offices in which those records were kept had gutted down to fire
on 23/7/2004 and again on 4/3/2006 and it has submitted an FIR No. 25(3)06
LLI-PS U/s 436/447/34 IPC & PDPPA dated, 4/3/2006. However, in absence of any
allotment orders being issued by the State Govt. or in absence of duly registered
allotment deeds, the question of existence of mutation orders or Patta or Jamabandi
does not arise.

Tayenjam Biju Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 17 May, 2022
(e) The Jamabandi Patta being Nos. i) 438(New), ii) 115(Old), 439/910(New), iii)
438/1251(New), iv) 238(Old), 1251/1268(New) & v) 238(Old), 1251/1269(New) are
all fake without there being any allotment orders or execution of registered allotment
deed by the State Govt., and as such the subject Dag-
Chithas/ Jamabandis are all declared null and void. Consequently, the respondent/objectors are
illegal encroachers of the said Government Land and liable to be evicted forthwith.
(f) It is also important to note that an internal inquiry is also under process as to how the said
alleged fake Mutation orders/Jamabandi/Pattas have been prepared without any allotment process
and as to how state land has been transferred to individual without due process of law. And, officials
involved in such W.P.(C) No. 42 of 2021 &Anr. Page 5 illegal activities shall be proceeded in
accordance with law.
Before parting the relevant record, this Court request the O.C. Heingang Police Station to cause and
investigate with respect to the Land under Patta No. i) 438(New), ii) 115(Old), 439/910(New), iii)
438/1251(New), iv) 238(Old), 1251/1268(New)& v) 238(old), 1251/1269(New) as to who
manufactured the fake and bogus Jamabandi/Patta etc., and to book the culprits according to law."
The sum and substance of the order passed by the Deputy Commissioner, Imphal East is that the
Dag-Chithas/Jamabandis recorded in the name of the petitioners were all declared null and void
and consequently, the petitioners were also declared as encroachers on Government land and liable
to be evicted forthwith. [7] After passing the aforesaid order dated 08.01.2021 in Rev. Misc. Case
No. 4 of 2020, the Deputy Commissioner, Imphal East registered an eviction case being Eviction
Case No. 1 of 2021 against the petitioners and passed an order on 15.01.2021 in the said eviction
case thereby directing the petitioners to remove the illegal structures constructed upon the land in
question and to deliver vacant possession within 17.01.2021, failing which necessary eviction shall
be carried out without giving further notice. Having been aggrieved, the petitioners approached this
Court by filing the present writ petitions assailing the aforesaid orders dated 08.01.2021 and
15.01.2021, passed by the Deputy Commissioner, Imphal East, in Rev. Misc. Case No. 4 of 2020 and
Eviction Case No. 1 of 2021 respectively.
W.P.(C) No. 42 of 2021 &Anr. Page 6
[8] Mr. Th. Ibohal, learned senior counsel appearing for the
petitioner in W.P.(C) No. 42 of 2021 and Mr. Th. Mahira, learned counsel appearing for the
petitioner in W.P.(C) No. 46 of 2021 submitted that the Deputy Commissioner erroneously issued
the notice dated 21.11.2020 in Rev. Misc. Case No. 4 of 2020 under section 14 of the MLR & LR Act
and Sub-Rule (vii) of Rule 15 of the MLR & LR (Allotment of Land) Rules, 1962 and proceeded
under the provisions of the said Section and Rules and passed the impugned order dated 08.01.2021
in Rev. Misc. Case No. 4 of 2020. The learned counsel further submitted that the provisions under
Section 14 of the MLR & LR Act, 1960 and Rule 15 (vii) of the MLR & LR (Allotment and Land),
Rules, 1962 are not at all applicable for deciding the issue raised in the said Rev. Misc. Case No. 4 of
2020 and that the Deputy Commissioner is not empowered under the aforesaid Section and Rules to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/36176259/ 4
Tayenjam Biju Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 17 May, 2022
decide the issues raised in the Rev. Misc. Case No. 4 of 2020 and to pass the impugned order dated
08.1.2021. The learned counsel also submitted that the impugned order dated 08.01.2021 have been
passed illegally and without any power and jurisdiction and accordingly, the said order is liable to be
quashed and set aside.
[9] In respect of the impugned eviction order dated 15.01.2021, passed by the Deputy
Commissioner, Imphal East in Eviction Case No. 1 of 2021, it has been submitted by the learned
counsel appearing for the petitioners that the said impugned order have been passed illegally
W.P.(C) No. 42 of 2021 &Anr. Page 7 and in complete violation of the mandatory provisions under
Rule 18 of the MLR & LR Rules, 1961, inasmuch as, the Deputy Commissioner neither issued any
show cause notice to the petitioners nor hold any summary enquiry as provided of Rule 18 of the
MLR & LR Rules before passing the said eviction order and accordingly, the learned counsel
submitted that the impugned eviction order is liable to be quashed and set aside.
[10] Mr. Lenin Hijam, learned Advocate General, Manipur, submitted that after registering the Rev.
Misc. Case No. 4 of 2020, the Deputy Commissioner, Imphal East issued a notice dated 21.11.2020
to the petitioners directing them to appear before him to establish their right and title over the land.
Pursuant to the said notice, the petitioners appeared before the Deputy Commissioner, Imphal East
through their respective counsel on many occasions, however, the petitioners failed to establish
their ownership over the disputed land and accordingly, the Deputy Commissioner passed the
impugned order dated 08.01.2021 in the said Rev. Misc. Case No. 4 of 2020 declaring, inter-alia,
that all the Jamabandis recorded in the name of the petitioners are all fake and null and void and
that the petitioners are illegal encroachers on Government land and liable to be evicted forthwith.
Thereafter, the Deputy Commissioner passed the impugned order dated 15.01.2020 in Eviction Case
No. 1 of 2021 directing the petitioners to remove the illegal structures constructed upon the disputed
land and to deliver vacant W.P.(C) No. 42 of 2021 &Anr. Page 8 possession within 17.01.2021, failing
which necessary eviction shall be carried out without giving further notice.
The learned Advocate General, Manipur further submitted that the Deputy Commissioner is
empowered under Section 11 (3) and Section 15 of the MLR & LR Act to issue the impugned orders
and that the Deputy Commissioner had issued the impugned orders after giving notice to the
petitioners and after complying fully with the principle of natural justice.
[11] So far as the contention of the petitioners about non issuance of any notice prior to issuing the
impugned eviction order as contemplated under Rule 18 of the MLR & LR Rules is concerned, it has
been submitted by the learned Advocate General that as the Deputy Commissioner, Imphal East had
already given ample opportunity to the petitioners to establish their claim of ownership over the
land and as the Deputy Commissioner had already issued an order declaring the petitioners as
illegal encroachers after holding an elaborate enquiry just prior to issuance of the eviction order,
issuing any further notice will not serve any useful purpose and it will be just a mere useless
formality and that such an exercise will be totally futile and that non issuance of such notice does
not prejudice the petitioners in any manner. In support of his contentions, the learned Advocate
General relied on the judgment rendered by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the Case of "Dharampal
W.P.(C) No. 42 of 2021 &Anr. Page 9 Satyapal Ltd. Vs. Deputy Commissioner and Central Excise,

Gauhati"
reported in (2015) 8 SCC 519 wherein, it has been held as under:-
"38. But that is not the end of the matter. While the law on the principle of audi
alteram partem has progressed in the manner mentioned above, at the same time,
the courts have also repeatedly remarked that the principles of natural justice are
very flexible principles. They cannot be applied in any straitjacket formula. It all
depends upon the kind of functions performed and to the extent to which a person is
likely to be affected. For this reason, certain exceptions to the aforesaid principles
have been invoked under certain circumstances. For example, the courts have held
that it would be sufficient to allow a person to make a representation and oral hearing
may not be necessary in all cases, though in some matters, depending upon the
nature of the case, not only full-fledged oral hearing but even cross-examination of
witnesses is treated as a necessary concomitant of the principles of natural justice.
Likewise, in service matters relating to major punishment by way of disciplinary
action, the requirement is very very strict and full-fledged opportunity is envisaged
under the statutory rules as well. On the other hand, in those cases where there is an
admission of charge, even when no such formal inquiry is held, the punishment
based on such admission is upheld. It is for this reason, in certain circumstances,
even post- decisional hearing is held to be permissible. Further, the courts have held
that under certain circumstances principles of natural justice may even be excluded
by reason of diverse factors like time, place, the apprehended danger and so on.
"39. We are not concerned with these aspects in the present case as the issue relates
to giving of notice before taking action. While emphasising that the principles of
natural justice cannot be applied in straitjacket formula, the aforesaid instances are
given. We have highlighted the jurisprudential basis of adhering to the principles of
natural justice which are grounded on the doctrine of procedural fairness, accuracy of
outcome leading to general social goals, etc. Nevertheless, there may be situations
wherein for some reason-perhaps because the evidence against the individual is
thought to be utterly compelling-it is felt that a fair hearing "would make no
difference"-meaning that a hearing would not change the ultimate conclusion
reached by the decision-maker-then no legal duty to supply a hearing arises. Such an
approach was endorsed by Lord Wilberforce in Malloch v. Aberdeen Corpn., who said
that: (WLR p. 1595 : All ER p. 1294) "... A breach of procedure ... cannot give [rise to]
a remedy in the courts, unless behind it there is something of substance which has
been lost by the failure. The court does not act in vain."
Relying on these comments, Brandon L.J. opined in Cinnamond v. British Airports Authority that:
(WLR p. 593 : All ER p. 377) W.P.(C) No. 42 of 2021 &Anr. Page 10 "... no one can complain of not
being given an opportunity to make representations if such an opportunity would have availed him
nothing."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/36176259/ 6
Tayenjam Biju Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 17 May, 2022
In such situations, fair procedures appear to serve no purpose since the "rights" result can be
secured without according such treatment to the individual.
"45. Keeping in view the aforesaid principles in mind, even when we find that there is
an infraction of principles of natural justice, we have to address a further question as
to whether any purpose would be served in remitting the case to the authority to
make fresh demand of amount recoverable, only after issuing notice to show cause to
the appellant. In the facts of the present case, we find that such an exercise would be
totally futile having regard to the law laid down by this Court in R.C. Tobacco.
"47. In Escorts Farms Ltd. v. Commr., this Court, while reiterating the position that
rules of natural justice are to be followed for doing substantial justice, held that, at
the same time, it would be of no use if it amounts to completing a mere ritual of
hearing without possibility of any change in the decision of the case on merits. It was
so explained in the following terms: (SCC pp. 309-10, para 64) "64. Right of hearing
to a necessary party is a valuable right. Denial of such right is serious breach of
statutory procedure prescribed and violation of rules of natural justice. In these
appeals preferred by the holder of lands and some other transferees, we have found
that the terms of government grant did not permit transfer of land without
permission of the State as grantor. Remand of cases of a group of transferees who
were not heard, would, therefore, be of no legal consequence, more so, when on this
legal question all affected parties have got full opportunity of hearing before the High
Court and in this appeal before this Court. Rules of natural justice are to be followed
for doing substantial justice and not for completing a mere ritual of hearing without
possibility of any change in the decision of the case on merits. In view of the legal
position explained by us above, we, therefore, refrain from remanding these cases in
exercise of our discretionary powers under Article 136 of the Constitution of India."
"48. Therefore, on the facts of this case, we are of the opinion that non-issuance of
notice before sending communication dated 23-6-2003 has not resulted in any
prejudice to the appellant and it may not be feasible to direct the respondents to take
fresh action after issuing notice as that would be a mere formality."
[12] The learned Advocate General submitted that the Deputy Commissioner, Imphal East passed
the impugned orders dated W.P.(C) No. 42 of 2021 &Anr. Page 11 08.01.2021 in Rev. Misc. Case No.
4 of 2020 in exercise of the power conferred under Section 11 (3) of the MLR & LR Act and the
impugned order dated 15.01.2021 in Eviction Case No. 1 of 2021 in exercise of the power under
Section 15 of the MLR & LR Act and that if the petitioners are aggrieved by the said two orders, they
can challenge the same by filing appeals, revision, review or civil suit as provided under Section 93,
95, 96 and 11(4) of the MLR & LR Act. It has also been submitted that as the petitioners have filed
the present writ petitions challenging the said impugned orders without exhausting the alternative
and effective statutory remedies available under the MLR & LR Act, the present writ petitions are
not maintainable and are liable to be dismissed outright.

Tayenjam Biju Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 17 May, 2022
In support of his contentions, the learned Advocate General relied on the following judgments of the
Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of:-
(1) "Rajasthan State Industrial Development and Investment Corporation And
Another Vs. Diamond & Gem Development Corporation Limited And
Another"reported in (2013) 5 SCC 470, wherein, it has been held that-
"39. The cancellation of allotment was made by appellant RIICO in exercise of its
power under Rule 24 of the 1979 Rules read with the terms of the lease agreement.
Such an order of cancellation could have been challenged by filing a review
application before the competent authority under Rule 24(aa) and, in the alternative,
the respondent Company could have preferred an appeal under Rule 24(bb)(ii)
before the Infrastructure Development Committee of the Board. The respondent
Company ought to have resorted to the arbitration clause provided in the lease deed
in the event of a dispute, W.P.(C) No. 42 of 2021 &Anr. Page 12 and the District
Collector, Jaipur would have then decided the case. However, the respondent
Company did not resort to either of the statutory remedy, rather preferred a writ
petition which could not have been entertained by the High Court. It is a settled law
that writ does not lie merely because it is lawful to do so. A person may be asked to
exhaust the statutory/alternative remedy available to him in law."
(2) "Phoenix ARC Private Limited V. VishwaBharatiVidyaMandir and Others" reported in AIR 2022
SC 1045, wherein, it has been held that-
"7.3 In the case of Satyawati Tondon and Ors. (supra), it was observed and held by
this Court that the remedies available to an aggrieved person against the action taken
under section 13(4) or Section 14 of the SARFAESI Act, by way of appeal under
Section 17, can be said to be both expeditious and effective. On maintainability of or
entertainability of a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, in a
case where the effective remedy is available to the aggrieved person, it is observed
and held in the said decision in paragraphs 43 to 46 as under:-
"43. Unfortunately, the High Court over-looked the settled law that the High court
will ordinarily not entertain a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution if an
effective remedy is available to the aggrieved person and that this rule applies with
greater rigour in matters involving recovery of taxes, cess, fees, other types of public
money and the dues of banks and other financial institution. In our view, while
dealing with the petitions involving challenge to the action taken for recovery of the
public dues, etc. the High Court must keep in mind that the legislations enacted by
Parliament and State Legislatures for recovery of such dues are a code unto
themselves inasmuch as they not only contain comprehensive procedure for recovery
of the dues but also envisage constitution of quasi-judicial bodies for redressal of the
grievance of any aggrieved person. Therefore, in all such cases, the High Court must
insist that before availing remedy under Article 226 of the Constitution, a person
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/36176259/ 8
Tayenjam Biju Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 17 May, 2022
must exhaust the remedies available under the relevant statute.
"44. While expressing the aforesaid view, we are conscious that the powers conferred
upon the High Court under Articles 226 of the Constitution to issue to any person or
authority, including in appropriate cases, any Government, directions, orders or writs
including the five prerogative writs for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred
by Part III or for any other purpose are very wide and there is no express limitation
on exercise of that power but, at the same time, we W.P.(C) No. 42 of 2021 &Anr.
Page 13 cannot be oblivious of the rules of self-imposed restraint evolved by this
Court, which every High Court is bound to keep in view while exercising power under
Article 226 of the Constitution.
"45. It is true that the rule of exhaustion of alternative remedy is a rule of discretion
and not one of compulsion, but it is difficult to fathom any reason why the High
Court should entertain a petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution and pass
interim order ignoring the fact that the petitioner can avail effective alternative
remedy by filing application, appeal, revision, etc. and the particular legislation
contains a detailed mechanism for redressal of his grievance."
[13] Before considering the rival submissions advanced by the learned counsel appearing for the
parties, it will be appropriate to examine the provisions of the MLR & LR Act and Rules relevant for
the purpose of deciding the issues involved in the present writ petitions. The relevant provisions of
the Act and Rules are reproduced hereunder for ready reference :-
"11. * * * * * * * (3) Where any property or any right in or over any property is claimed
by or on behalf of the Government or by any person as against the Government and
the claim is disputed, such dispute shall be decided by the deputy commissioner

(4) Any person aggrieved by an order made under sub-
section (3) or in appeal or revision therefrom may institute a civil suit to contest the order within a
period of six months from the date of such order, and the decision of the civil court shall be binding
on the parties.
"15. Unauthorised occupation of land.-(1) Any person who occupies or continues to
occupy any land belonging to Government without lawful authority shall be regarded
as a trespasser and may be summarily evicted therefrom by the competent authority
and any building or other construction erected or anything deposited on such land, if
not removed within such reasonable time as such authority may from time to time fix
for the purpose, shall be liable to be forfeited to the Government and to be disposed
of in such manner as the competent authority may direct :

"96. Review of orders.-A Revenue Officer may, either on his own motion or on the
application of any party interested, review any order passed by himself or by any of
his predecessors-in-office and pass such order in reference thereto as he thinks fit :"
"Rule 18. (1) Before ordering eviction of a person under sub-section (1) of section 15
the competent authority shall issue a notice to him requiring him to show cause
within a period to be specified in the notice why he should not be evicted from the
land.
(2) If the person concerned files an objection within the period specified in the notice
or such extended period as may be allowed by the competent authority it shall hold a
summary inquiry in the manner laid down in Schedule III.
(3) If the person concerned files no objection within the time so allowed or if after
inquiry the competent authority finds that the person is a trespasser it shall order his
eviction and shall also require him to remove any building or other construction
erected or any thing deposited on the land within a time specified in the order."
[14] On careful examination of the above quoted Act and Rules, this Court is of the considered view
that the Deputy W.P.(C) No. 42 of 2021 &Anr. Page 15 Commissioner is the competent authority and
empowered under Section 11 (3) of the MLR & LR Act to decide the dispute regarding any claim of
ownership or any right in or over a property on behalf of the Government or by any person against
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/36176259/ 10

the Government and that any person aggrieved by an order made under Sub-Section (3) of Section
11 can institute a civil suit to contest the order passed by the Deputy Commissioner.
[15] Section 15 (1) of the MLR & LR Act provides that any person who occupies or continues to
occupy any land belonging to the Government without lawful authority shall be regarded as a
trespasser and may be summarily evicted there from by the competent authority and any building or
constructions erected, if not removed within such reasonable time fixed by the authority for the
purpose, shall be liable to be forfeited or disposed of. However, under Rule 18 of the MLR & LR
Rules, it is provided that before ordering eviction of a person under Section 15 (1) of the MLR & LR
Act, the competent authority should issue a notice to him requiring him to show cause as to why he
should not be evicted from the land and that if the person file an objection an enquiry should be held
before his eviction.
[16] Under Section 93, it is provided that an appeal shall lie against an order passed by the Deputy
Commissioner to the tribunal and that under Section 95 and 96, there is provisions for filing
revision W.P.(C) No. 42 of 2021 &Anr. Page 16 and review against the order passed by the Revenue
Officers under the MLR & LR Act.
[17] In the present cases, the Deputy Commissioner, Imphal East issued a notice dated 21.11.2020 to
the petitioners summoning them to appear before him in-person or by a duly authorised
representative to establish their rights and title over the land in dispute and after hearing the
counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners, the Deputy Commissioner passed the impugned
order dated 08.01.2021 in Rev. Misc. Case No. 4 of 2020 declaring, inter-alia, that the DagChithas
or Jamabandis recorded in the name of the petitioners are null and void and consequently, the
petitioners were also declared as encroachers on Government land and liable to be evicted
forthwith. Subsequently, the Deputy Commissioner, Imphal East, issued the impugned order dated
15.01.2021 in the Eviction Case No. 1 of 2021 directing the petitioners to remove the illegal
structures constructed upon the said land and to deliver vacant possession. In view of the
undisputed facts, this court is of the considered view that the Deputy Commissioner, Imphal East,
had acted in compliance with the provisions of Section 11 (3) and Section 15 of the MLR & LR Act
and Rule 18 of the MLR & LR Rules and that the Deputy Commissioner, Imphal East has the power
and authority to issue the impugned orders.
W.P.(C) No. 42 of 2021 &Anr. Page 17
[18] On careful examination of the records of the present writ
petitionsmore particularly the notice dated 21.11.2020 and the impugned order dated 08.01.2021
passed by the Deputy Commissioner, Imphal East in Rev. Misc. Case No. 4 of 2020, this Court did
not find any material whatsoever to substantiate or to support the contentions of the writ petitioners
that the Deputy Commissioner, Imphal East, had erroneously issued the said notice dated
21.11.2020 under the provisions of Section 14 of the MLR & LR Act and Rule 15 of the MLR & LR
(Allotment of Land) Rules, 1962and that the Deputy Commissioner had proceeded under the
erroneous and inapplicable provisions of the Act and Rules and passed the impugned orders without
any authority or jurisdiction. Mere mentioning of Section 14 of the MLR & MR Act and Rule 15 of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/36176259/ 11
Tayenjam Biju Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 17 May, 2022
the MLR & LR (Allotment of Land) Rules, that too, in the context as contained in the said notice
dated 21.11.2020 cannot, by any stress of imagination, be construed that the said notice has been
issued under the said Section and Rule. Moreover, since the source of power of the Deputy
Commissioner, Imphal East, in taking up the proceedings and issuing the impugned orders are
traceable under Section 11 (3) and Section 15 of the MLR & LR Act, mere non mentioning or
mentioning of wrong provisions of the Act and Rules cannot vitiate the impugned orders. In this
regard, we can gainfully rely on the following judgments of the Hon'ble Apex Court:-
W.P.(C) No. 42 of 2021 &Anr. Page 18 (1) "N. Mani Vs. Sangeetha Theatre And Others"
reported in (2004) 12 SCC 278 "9. It is well settled that if an authority has a power
under the law merely because while exercising that power the source of power is not
specifically referred to or a reference is made to a wrong provision of law, that by
itself does not vitiate the exercise of power so long as the power does exist and can be
traced to a source available in law."
(2) "PK. Palanisamy Vs. N. Arumugham & Another"
reported in (2009) 9 SCC 173 "27. Section 148 of the Code is a general provision and
Section 149 thereof is special. The first application should have been filed in terms of
Section 149 of the Code. Once the court granted time for payment of deficit court fee
within the period specified therefor, it would have been possible to extend the same
by the court in exercise of its power under Section 148 of the Code. Only because a
wrong provision was mentioned by the appellant, the same, in our opinion, by itself
would not be a ground to hold that the application was not maintainable or that the
order passed thereon would be a nullity. It is a well-settled principle of law that
mentioning of a wrong provision or non- mentioning of a provision does not
invalidate an order if the court and/or statutory authority had the requisite
jurisdiction therefor.
"28. In Ram Sunder Ram V. Union of India it was held:
(SCC pp.260-61, para 19) "19. .... It appears that the competent authority has wrongly
quoted Section 20 in the order of discharge whereas, in fact, the order of discharge
has to be read having been passed under Section 22 of the Army Act.
„9. It is well settled that if an authority has a power under the law merely because while exercising
that power the source of power is not specifically referred to or a reference is made to a wrong
provision of law, that by itself does not vitiate the exercise of power so long as the power does exist
and can be traced to a source available in law.(cid:129) (See N. Mani V. Sangeetha Theatre, SCC p. 280, para
9.) Thus, quoting of wrong provision of Section 20 in the order of discharge of the appellant by the
competent authority does not take away the jurisdiction of the authority under Section 22 of the
Army Act. Therefore, the order of W.P.(C) No. 42 of 2021 &Anr. Page 19 discharge of the appellant
from the army service cannot be vitiated on this sole ground as contended by the learned counsel for
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/36176259/ 12
Tayenjam Biju Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 17 May, 2022
the appellant."
"29. In N. Mani V. Sangeetha Theatre it is stated: (SCC p. 280, para 9) "9. It is well
settled that if an authority has a power under the law merely because while exercising
that power the source of power is not specifically referred to or a reference is made to
a wrong provision of law, that by itself does not vitiate the exercise of power so long
as the power does exist and can be traced to a source available in law."
[19] In the present cases, as the Deputy Commissioner, Imphal East issued a notice dated 21.11.2020
summoning the petitioners to appear before him to substantiate their claim of rights and title or
ownership over the disputed land and as the Deputy Commissioner held an elaborate enquiry and
heard the petitioners through their counsel before issuing the impugned eviction order dated
15.01.2021, this Court is of the considered view that the Deputy Commissioner, Imphal East, had
substantially complied with the provisions of Rule 18 of the MLR & LR Rules and had also complied
with the principles of natural justice. This Court is also of the considered view that the petitioners
could not make out any case of causing any prejudice to them by non-issuance of a notice prior to
issuance of the impugned eviction order. In view of the above, this Court declines to interfere with
the impugned eviction order.
[20] So far as the claim of the petitioners about their right and title over the disputed land is
concerned, it has been submitted by the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners that the
petitioners have W.P.(C) No. 42 of 2021 &Anr. Page 20 already filed Original Suit No. 9 of 2021 and
Original Suit No. 8 of 2021 respectively in the Court of Civil Judge (Senior Division), Imphal East,
Manipur and that in the said pending suits, the learned Civil Judge had already passed an order for
maintaining status-quo. In view of the above, this Court is not inclined to consider the claims of the
petitioners of having their rights and title over the disputed land in the present writ petitions.
In the result, the writ petitions are hereby dismissed and all the earlier interim orders stands
vacated. Parties are to bear their own costs.
