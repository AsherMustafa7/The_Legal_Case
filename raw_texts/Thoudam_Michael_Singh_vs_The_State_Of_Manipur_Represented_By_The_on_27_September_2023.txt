Thoudam Michael Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The on 27 September, 2023
determination of the age of the petitioner.
[4.1] The date of birth of the elder sister of the petitioner as per matriculation admit card is
12.11.1994, i.e., her elder sister was 18 years 4 months and 23 days on the date of occurrence, i.e., on
4.5.2013. For the purpose of determination of juvenility of the petitioner, the trial Court has
examined 6 (six) witnesses.
[5] The petitioner/accused was examined as PW No.1 and stated that he has 3(three) elder sisters
and he studied in Maipakpi Memorial New Age Public School at Langthabal from Nursery to KG and
studied in Meera Public School, Mongsangei from class 1 to 7 and studied in Little Master English
Higher Secondary School, Samurou from class 8 to 9. But,he could not appear the final examination
of class 9 due to poverty. He was born on 1.2.1996, but he did not know the date of birth of the
3(three) elder sisters.As narratedby his mother, there is a gap of 2 years in between the petitioner
and the 3 rd elder sister.
Page |6 Exhibit P-1 is the reading certificate issued by thePrincipal, Little Master English Higher
Secondary School, Samurou dated 21.12.2021 certifying that the petitioner was reading in class 9 in
the year 2009 and his date of birth was shown as 1.2.1996. Exhibit P-2 is the provisional certificate
of her third sister passing HSLC examination in 2011 and Exhibit P-3 is the admit card of her third
elder sister issued by the Board of Secondary Education, Manipur for appearing in the matriculation
examination, 2021. Both Exhibits P-2 and P-3 indicate the date of birth of the third sister of the
petitioner as 12.11.1994. [6] PW No.2 is the third sister of the petitioner. She stated that the
petitioner was born in the year 1996, but she could not remember the exact date and month on
which, he was born. She stated that she was born on 12.11.1994 and as stated by her mother there is
a gap of 2 years in between her and the accused. In the cross-examination, PW No.2 admitted that
there is a gap of 2 years in between her and the petitioner.
[6.1] PW No.3 is the mother of the petitioner and she stated that she has 3(three) daughters and one
son and the petitioneris her last son. She stated that the petitioner was born on 1.2.1996, the first
daughter was born in the year 1990 and the second daughter was born in the year 1992 and the third
daughter was born in the year 1994. It is also stated that there is a gap of 2 Page |7 years between
her children. She stated that the petitioner could not appear in the class 9 examination due to
poverty and the petitioner studied from nursery in Maipakpi Memorial New Age Public School,
Langthabal and studied from class 1 to 7 in Meera Public School and both the schools are now
closed. [6.2] PW No.4 is the Principal-in-Charge of the Little Master English Higher Secondary
School and stated that Exhibit P-1 was the reading certificate of the accused issued under his
signature and the petitioner was reading in class 9 under Roll No.338 in the academic session of
2019 and his date of birth was 1.2.1996 as shown in the certificate and that the details were copied
from the broad-sheet maintained by the school and the witness also submitted a copy of the
broad-sheet maintained by the school. The broad-sheet is compared with the original and the same
was found tallied. The broad-sheet was issued by the Board of Secondary Education, Manipur after
the School had submitted the list of students of class 9 to the Board of Secondary Education,
Manipur. [7] In the course examination, PW No.4 admitted that the date of birth of the petitioner,
being 1.2.1996 as reflected at Sl. No.335 of Exhibit-P/4, was by virtue of the certificate of passing
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/25347001/ 3
Thoudam Michael Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The on 27 September, 2023
Class - VIII issued by his previous school and the certificate of passing class 8 by the petitioner
issued by previous school is untraceable due to frequent siftings of place of school.
Page |8 [7.1] PW No.5 is the Clerk of the Little Master English Higher Secondary School which
issued the reading certificate for the petitioner. PW No.5 stated that the date of birth of the
petitioner,exhibited as Exhibit-P/1, i.e., 1.2.1996, was copied from the previous record of passing
Class VIII and in the cross- examination, it is stated that thedate of birth of the petitioner was based
on the alleged Class VIII certificate submitted by the petitioner and only on his statement.
[7.2] PW No.6 is the Doctor serving as Sr. Resident in the Department of Forensic Medicine and
Toxicology, RIMS, Imphal who examined the petitioner on 17.8.2022 with general physical
examination, secondary sexual characters and dental examination. The Doctor opined that the age
of the petitioner is above 21 years at the time of the examination, i.e., as on 17.8.2022. However,
upper age of the petitioner could not be ascertained. In the cross-examination, PW No.6 admitted
that the upper age limit of the petitioner could not be determined, but it could be 25 years, 30 years
or 40 years, but it cannot be more than 50 years.
[8] Vide impugned order dated 31.3.2023, the trial Court considered only the evidence of deposition
of PW No.6 (Doctor who examined the petitioner). The Ld. Court is of the view that the age of the
accused as on date of his Page |9 medical examination on 17.08.2022 to be 21+/- 2 years, age of the
petitioner cannot be 19 years or 23 years as on the date of examination, i.e., on 7.8.2022.
Accordingly, the age of accused on the date of the incident, i.e., on 5.4.2013would be between 10 to
14 years. The Ld. Trial Court is of the view that this calculation could not be accepted. It would be
quite absurd in the facts of the present case. It is held in Para 6 of the impugned order that when the
education certificate andage determination medical report of the accused person are found to be not
conclusive, the age of the accused person may be considered based on all the information available
on record of the case. Ld. FTSC No.1, Manipur observed that the petitioner was a married person
with children at the time of the incident and hence, he was not below the age of 18 years at the time
of incident and held that the petitioner was not a juvenile at the time of the incident. Being
aggrieved by the impugned order, the petitioner approached this Court by way of the present
petitioner under Section 102 of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 on the following grounds inter-alia:
(i) For that, the Ld. Trial Court below failed to apply his judicial mind in passing the
impugned order.
(ii) For that, the Ld. Trial Court below failed to see that the petitioner can never be
older than his immediate elder sister Sobita Devi who is born on 12/11/1994.
P a g e | 10
(iii) For that, the Ld. Trial Court failed to observe the evidence of the PW-6 (Dr.Soibam Neha) that
the age of the petitioner on the date of his OSSIFICATION TEST, is/would be 25 years, or 30 years,
or 40 years but not more than 50 years. If that is so, the petitioner can never be 30 years, or 40
years. If the petitioner is 30 years of age on the date of his ossification test, he (petitioner) is older
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/25347001/ 4
Thoudam Michael Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The on 27 September, 2023
than his immediate elder sister Sobita Devi (PW-2).
(iv) For That, the Ld. Trial Court below had failed to discharge his bounden duties that should have
been rendered as per law and his finding against the prayer of the petitioner is not based on any
authority of law and the same is based on mere assumption as such the impugned order cannot be
acted upon.
(v) For that, the impugned order is bad in law and not fair as such cannot be acted upon.
(vi) For that, there are also other grounds and the same may kindly be submitted during final
hearing of the case.
[9] It is the case of the petitioner that the upper age limit of the petitioner cannot be more than 25
yearson the date of medical examination because he cannot be older than his sister PW No.2 who
was born on 12.11.1992 as per matriculation certificate of the date of examination, i.e., 17.8.2022,
the age of PW No.2 would be 26 years 8 months and as per the deposition of the PW Nos.1, 2 & 3,
there is a gap of 2 years between the P a g e | 11 petitioner and PW No.2 and hence upper age of the
petitioner would be 24 years 8 months.
[10] This Court issued notice on 17.4.2023 and the Ld. PP accepted notice on behalf of the
respondent and sought 2 weeks. At the time of issuance of notice, this Court framed the issue
involved in the present case on 17.4.2023. The same is reproduced as below:
"When the Court/Competent Authority does not accept 3 (three) documents
mentioned in Section 94 of Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, ie, (1) School of Matriculate
Certificate, (2) Birth Certifiacte issued by the Birth and Death Registrar, and (3)
Medical Examination Report, what will be the procedure to be adopted by the Court
in such situation?"
[11] The State respondent has failed to file counter affidavit and vide order dated 08.06.2023, this
Court observed that extensive counter affidavit is not required and the question of law regarding the
document to be relied while deciding juvenility of a person within the meaning of Section 94 of the
Juvenile Justice Act is required. As no counter affidavit was filed, the matter was heard P a g e | 12
on 04.07.2023 on the basis of the available record and the matter was reserved for orders.
[12] Mr. Y. Devadutta, learned counsel for the petitioner has assailed the impugned order mainly on
the ground that learned Trial Court committed error in rejecting all the documents stipulated in
Section 94 of JJ Act, 2015. When the documents as mentioned in Section 94 are rejected by the
court, it is incumbent to rely upon the medical opinion. It is pointed out that the statute does not
provide any other documents except for the three methods as contemplated in Section 94 of the Act.
Assuming for the sake of argument that the court rely on other sources, the finding that the
petitioner was not a juvenile at the time of occurrence cannot be sustained on the simple logic that
he cannot be older than his immediate elder sister. As per the uncontroverted depositions of
witnesses examined for this purpose, it is established that the immediate elder sister was 18 years 4
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/25347001/ 5
Thoudam Michael Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The on 27 September, 2023
months and 23 days old on the date of offence and there is a gap of 2 years between them. Learned
counsel vehemently submits that the petitioner ought to be treated as 16+ years on the date of the
offence. It is pointed out that learned Trial Court failed to consider this important document. If the
same is considered, the petitioner is a juvenile on the date of the occurrence.
P a g e | 13 [13] Mr. Y. Devadutta, learned counsel for the petitioner relies upon the recent decision
of P. Yuvaprakash vs. State Rep. by Inspector of Police (18.07.2023 - SC) : MANU/SC/0777/2023.
Hon'ble Supreme Court has considered the procedure for determining juvenility and had held that
in absence of certificates as mentioned in Section 94 of JJ Act, medical report authenticated by the
examining doctor can be reliable. It is observed that transfer certificate is not a document as
mentioned in Section 94 of the Act.
13. It is evident from conjoint reading of the above provisions that wherever the dispute with respect
to the age of a person arises in the context of her or him being a victim under the POCSO Act, the
courts have to take recourse to the steps indicated in Section 94 of the JJ Act. The three documents
in order of which the Juvenile Justice Act requires consideration is that the concerned court has to
determine the age by considering the following documents:
(i) the date of birth certificate from the school, or the matriculation or equivalent
certificate from the concerned examination Board, if available; and in the absence
thereof;
(ii) the birth certificate given by a corporation or a municipal authority or a
panchayat;
(iii) and only in the absence of (i) and (ii) above, age shall be determined by an
ossification test or any other latest medical age determination test conducted on the
orders of the Committee or the Board.
14. Section 94(2)(iii) of the JJ Act clearly indicates that the date of birth certificate from the school
or matriculation or equivalent certificate by the concerned examination board has to be firstly
preferred in the absence of which the birth certificate issued by the Corporation or Municipal
Authority or Panchayat and it is only thereafter in the absence of these such documents the age is to
be determined through "an ossification test" or "any other latest medical age determination test"
conducted on the orders of the concerned authority, i.e. Committee or Board or
Court. In the present case, concededly, only a transfer P a g e | 14 certificate and not
the date of birth certificate or matriculation or equivalent certificate was considered.
Ex. C1, i.e., the school transfer certificate showed the date of birth of the victim as
11.07.1997. Significantly, the transfer certificate was produced not by the prosecution
but instead by the court summoned witness, i.e., CW-1. The burden is always upon
the prosecution to establish what it alleges; therefore, the prosecution could not have
been fallen back upon a document which it had never relied upon. Furthermore,
DW-3, the concerned Revenue Official (Deputy Tahsildar) had stated on oath that the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/25347001/ 6
Thoudam Michael Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The on 27 September, 2023
records for the year 1997 in respect to the births and deaths were missing. Since it did
not answer to the description of any class of documents mentioned in Section
94(2)(i) as it was a mere transfer certificate, Ex C-1 could not have been relied upon
to hold that M was below 18 years at the time of commission of the offence.
15. In a recent decision, in Rishipal Singh Solanki v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Ors.,
MANU/SC/1081/2021 : 2021 (12) SCR 502 this Court outlined the procedure to be followed in cases
where age determination is required. The court was dealing with Rule 12 of the erstwhile Juvenile
Justice Rules (which is in parimateria) with Section 94 of the JJ Act, and held as follows:
20. Rule 12 of the JJ Rules, 2007 deals with the procedure to be followed in
determination of age. The juvenility of a person in conflict with law had to be decided
prima facie on the basis of physical appearance, or documents, if available. But an
inquiry into the determination of age by the Court or the JJ Board was by seeking
evidence by obtaining: (i) the matriculation or equivalent certificates, if available and
in the absence whereof; (ii) the date of birth certificate from the school (other than a
play school) first attended; and in the absence whereof; (iii) the birth certificate given
by a corporation or a municipal authority or a panchayat.
Only in the absence of either (i), (ii) and (iii) above, the medical opinion could be sought from a duly
constituted Medical Board to declare the age of the juvenile or child. It was also provided that while
determination was being made, benefit could be given to the child or juvenile by considering the age
on lower side within the margin of one year.
17. In Abuzar Hossain @ Gulam Hossain v. State of West Bengal [2012] 9 SCR 224, this Court,
through a three-judge bench, held that the burden of proving that someone is a juvenile (or below
the prescribed P a g e | 15 age) is upon the person claiming it. Further, in that decision, the court
indicated the hierarchy of documents that would be accepted in order of preference.
19. It is clear from the above narrative that none of the documents produced during the trial
answered the description of "the date of birth certificate from the school" or "the matriculation or
equivalent certificate"
from the concerned examination board or certificate by a corporation, municipal
authority or a Panchayat. In these circumstances, it was incumbent for the
prosecution to prove through acceptable medical tests/examination that the victim's
age was below 18 years as per Section 94(2)(iii) of the JJ Act. PW-9, Dr. Thenmozhi,
Chief Civil Doctor and Radiologist at the General Hospital at Vellore, produced the
X-ray reports and deposed that in terms of the examination of M, a certificate was
issued stating "that the age of the said girl would be more than 18 years and less than
20 years". In the cross-examination, she admitted that M's age could be taken as 19
years. However, the High Court rejected this evidence, saying that "when the precise
date of birth is available from out of the school records, the approximate age
estimated by the medical expert cannot be the determining factor". This finding is, in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/25347001/ 7
Thoudam Michael Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The on 27 September, 2023
this Court's considered view, incorrect and erroneous. As held earlier, the documents
produced, i.e., a transfer certificate and extracts of the admission register, are not
what Section 94(2) (i) mandates; nor are they in accord with Section 94(2) (ii)
because DW-1 clearly deposed that there were no records relating to the birth of the
victim, M. In these circumstances, the only piece of evidence, accorded with Section
94 of the JJ Act was the medical ossification test, based on several X-Rays of the
victim, and on the basis of which PW-9 made her statement. She explained the details
regarding examination of the victim's bones, stage of their development and opined
that she was between 18-20 years; in cross-examination she said that the age might
be 19 years. Given all these circumstances, this Court is of the opinion that the result
of the ossification or bone test was the most authentic evidence, corroborated by the
examining doctor, PW-9.
[14] Learned counsel further draws the attention of this Court to the leading case of
Rishipal Singh Solanki v. State of U.P.: (2022) 8 SCC 602, P a g e | 16 whereHon'ble
Supreme Court has laid down the principles to be followed while deciding juvenility
of a person as below:
33. What emerges on a cumulative consideration of the aforesaid catena of judgments
is as follows:
33.1. A claim of juvenility may be raised at any stage of a criminal proceeding, even
after a final disposal of the case. A delay in raising the claim of juvenility cannot be a
ground for rejection of such claim. It can also be raised for the first time before this
Court. 33.2. An application claiming juvenility could be made either before the court
or the JJ Board.
33.2.1. When the issue of juvenility arises before a court, it would be under
sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 9 of the JJ Act, 2015 but when a person is brought
before a committee or JJ Board, Section 94 of the JJ Act, 2015 applies.
33.2.2.If an application is filed before the court claiming juvenility, the provision of
sub-section (2) of Section 94 of the JJ Act, 2015 would have to be applied or read
along with sub-section (2) of Section 9 so as to seek evidence for the purpose of
recording a finding stating the age of the person as nearly as may be.
33.2.3. When an application claiming juvenility is made under Section 94 of the JJ
Act, 2015 before the JJ Board when the matter regarding the alleged commission of
offence is pending before a court, then the procedure contemplated under Section 94
of the JJ Act, 2015 would apply. Under the said provision if the JJ Board has
reasonable grounds for doubt regarding whether the person brought before it is a
child or not, the Board shall undertake the process of age determination by seeking
evidence and the age recorded by the JJ Board to be the age of the person so brought
before it shall, for the purpose of the JJ Act, 2015, be deemed to be true age of that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/25347001/ 8
Thoudam Michael Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The on 27 September, 2023
person. Hence the degree of proof required in such a proceeding before the JJ Board,
when an application is filed seeking a claim of juvenility when the trial is before the
criminal court concerned, is higher than when an inquiry is made by a court before
which the case regarding the commission of the offence is pending (vide Section 9 of
the JJ Act, 2015).
33.3. That when a claim for juvenility is raised, the burden is on the person raising
the claim to satisfy the court to discharge the initial burden. However, the documents
mentioned in Rules 12(3)( a)(i), (ii) and P a g e | 17
(iii) of the JJ Rules, 2007 made under the JJ Act, 2000 or sub-section (2) of Section
94 of the JJ Act, 2015, shall be sufficient for prima facie satisfaction of the court. On
the basis of the aforesaid documents a presumption of juvenility may be raised.
33.4.The said presumption is however not conclusive proof of the age of juvenility and the same may
be rebutted by contra evidence let in by the opposite side.
33.5. That the procedure of an inquiry by a court is not the same thing as declaring the age of the
person as a juvenile sought before the JJ Board when the case is pending for trial before the criminal
court concerned. In case of an inquiry, the court records a prima facie conclusion but when there is a
determination of age as per sub-section (2) of Section 94 of the 2015 Act, a declaration is made on
the basis of evidence. Also the age recorded by the JJ Board shall be deemed to be the true age of the
person brought before it. Thus, the standard of proof in an inquiry is different from that required in
a proceeding where the determination and declaration of the age of a person has to be made on the
basis of evidence scrutinised and accepted only if worthy of such acceptance.
33.6.That it is neither feasible nor desirable to lay down an abstract formula to determine the age of
a person. It has to be on the basis of the material on record and on appreciation of evidence adduced
by the parties in each case.
33.7. This Court has observed that a hypertechnical approach should not be adopted when evidence
is adduced on behalf of the accused in support of the plea that he was a juvenile.
33.8.If two views are possible on the same evidence, the court should lean in favour of holding the
accused to be a juvenile in borderline cases. This is in order to ensure that the benefit of the JJ Act,
2015 is made applicable to the juvenile in conflict with law. At the same time, the court should
ensure that the JJ Act, 2015 is not misused by persons to escape punishment after having
committed serious offences. 33.9.That when the determination of age is on the basis of evidence
such as school records, it is necessary that the same would have to be considered as per Section 35 of
the Evidence Act, inasmuch as any public or official document maintained in the discharge of official
duty would have greater credibility than private documents.
33.10. Any document which is in consonance with public documents, such as matriculation
certificate, could be accepted by the court or the JJ P a g e | 18 Board provided such public
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/25347001/ 9
Thoudam Michael Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The on 27 September, 2023
document is credible and authentic as per the provisions of the Evidence Act viz. Section 35 and
other provisions. 33.11.Ossification test cannot be the sole criterion for age determination and a
mechanical view regarding the age of a person cannot be adopted solely on the basis of medical
opinion by radiological examination. Such evidence is not conclusive evidence but only a very useful
guiding factor to be considered in the absence of documents mentioned in Section 94(2) of the JJ
Act, 2015.
[15] In view of the clear mandate of Rishipal Singh case (supra), Mr. Y. Devadutta, learned counsel
for the petitioner has submitted that the court ought to consider the documents on record while
considering the juvenility of the petitioner. It is stated that learned Trial Court has failed to do so in
ignoring the vital document, ie, age certificate of immediate elder sister of the petitioner. If the same
is relied, the petitioner is 16+ years old on the date of occurrence. It is pointed out that the learned
Trial Court drew the conclusion that the petitioner could not be a juvenile on the relevant date as he
was married man with children.
[16] Mr. Y. Ashang, learned PP has submitted that there is no manifest error in the impugned order,
as the Trial Court has considered the materials on record including the important factum that the
petitioner was a married person with children at the relevant time. He relies on the judgment of
Manoj v. State of Haryana: (2022) 6 SCC 187, whereHon'ble Supreme Court excluded the P a g e | 19
family register for considering as a document for considering juvenility as the same is not
contemplated by the statute.
40. In terms of Rule 12(3)(iii) of the Rules, birth certificate issued by corporation or municipal
authority or a panchayat is a relevant document to prove the juvenility. The family register is not a
birth certificate. Therefore, it would not strictly fall within clause (iii) of Rule 12(3) of the Rules.
Even Section 94(2)(ii) of the 2015 Act contemplates a birth certificate issued by a panchayat to
determine the age.
41. The appellant sought to rely upon juvenility only on the basis of school leaving record in his
application filed under Section 7-A of the 2000 Act. Such school record is not reliable and seems to
be procured only to support the plea of juvenility. The appellant has not referred to date of birth
certificate in his application as it was obtained subsequently. Needless to say, the plea of juvenility
has to be raised in a bonafide and truthful manner. If the reliance is on a document to seek juvenility
which is not reliable or dubious in nature, the appellant cannot be treated to be juvenile keeping in
view that the Act is a beneficial legislation. As also held in Babloo Pasi9, the provisions of the statute
are to be interpreted liberally but the benefit cannot be granted to the appellant who has approached
the Court with untruthful statement. *9. Babloo Pasi v. State of Jharkhand, (2008) 13 SCC 133 :
(2009) 3 SCC (Cri) 266 [17] This Court has considered the rival submissions of the parties, materials
on record and relevant law in this regard. It is settled proposition of law that the provisions of
Section 94 of Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 contemplates three types of documents to be relied while
considering juvenility. First is the date of birth certificate from school or matriculation certificate;
second is birth certificate issued by a municipal or panchayat; third is the age determined by
medical test. The document mentioned at first is to be preferred to others and P a g e | 20 only in
absence of certificate, medical test is to be resorted. However, the statute does not provide any other

method for determination of age. In the present case, learned Trial Court rejected all the documents
as prescribed in Section 94 of JJ Act and considered the factum of marriage of the petitioner at the
relevant time and held that the petitioner could not be a juvenile at the relevant time based on this
factum of marriage. However, other available documents on record such as age of the immediate
sister which was not disputed by the prosecution was not considered. As per the document Ext.P-3
(Admit Card for appearing in matriculation), the immediate elder sister of the petitioner was 18+
years at the relevant time and there is a gap of 2 years between the petitioner and his immediate
elder sister. [18] In the case of Jyoti Prakash Rai v. State of Bihar: (2008) 15 SCC 223,Hon'ble
Supreme Court held that juvenility has to be determined on the basis of materials brought on record
by the parties and observed in Para 12 as below:
12. The 2000 Act is indisputably a beneficial legislation. Principles of beneficial
legislation, however, are to be applied only for the purpose of interpretation of the
statute and not for arriving at a conclusion as to whether a person is juvenile or not.
Whether an offender was a juvenile on the date of commission of the offence or not is
essentially a question of fact which is required to be determined on the basis of the
materials brought on record by the parties. In the absence of any evidence which is
relevant for the said purpose as envisaged under Section 35 of the Evidence Act, the
same must be determined keeping in view the factual P a g e | 21 matrix involved in
each case. For the said purpose, not only relevant materials are required to be
considered, the orders passed by the court on earlier occasions would also be
relevant.
[19] In the case of Babloo Pasi v. State of Jharkhand, (2008) 13 SCC 133, Hon'ble Apex Court has
held that juvenility has to be determined on the basis of material on record and on appreciation of
evidence adduced by the parties. Para 12 is reproduced below:
22. It is well settled that it is neither feasible nor desirable to lay down an abstract
formula to determine the age of a person. The date of birth is to be determined on the
basis of material on record and on appreciation of evidence adduced by the parties.
The medical evidence as to the age of a person, though a very useful guiding factor, is
not conclusive and has to be considered along with other cogent evidence.
[20] In the leading case of Ashwani Kumar Saxena v. State of M.P., (2012) 9 SCC 750 for
determination of juvenility, Hon'ble Supreme Court laid down the principles to be followed while
considering juvenility and held that admission register is also a relevant piece of evidence of date of
birth.
34. Age determination inquiry contemplated under the JJ Act and the 2007 Rules has nothing to do
with an enquiry under other legislations, like entry in service, retirement, promotion, etc. There may
be situations where the entry made in the matriculation or equivalent certificates, date of birth
certificate from the school first attended and even the birth certificate given by a corporation or a
municipal authority or a panchayat may not be correct. But court, Juvenile Justice Board or a
committee functioning under the JJ Act is not expected to conduct such a roving enquiry and to go

Thoudam Michael Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The on 27 September, 2023
behind those certificates to examine the correctness of those documents, kept during the normal
course of business. Only in cases where those documents or certificates are found to be fabricated P
a g e | 22 or manipulated, the court, the Juvenile Justice Board or the committee need to go for
medical report for age determination.
43. We are of the view that admission register in the school in which the candidate first attended is a
relevant piece of evidence of the date of birth. The reasoning that the parents could have entered a
wrong date of birth in the admission register hence not a correct date of birth is equal to thinking
that parents would do so in anticipation that child would commit a crime in future and, in that
situation, they could successfully raise a claim of juvenility.
[21] From the above case laws, it is clear that the materials available on record have to be considered
while determining juvenility. However, in the present case Ext.P-3 was not considered. This Court is
of the opinion that non- consideration of the Ext.P-3 is fatal and the same cannot be overridden by
the factum of marriage of the petitioner. Accordingly, it is held that the petitioner was 16+ years old
on the date of occurrence, ie, 05.04.2013 and hence was a juvenile on the relevant date. The
impugned order is set aside. In compliance with the provisions of Section 9 of Juvenile Justice Act,
2015, the present case is transmitted to the Juvenile Justice Board, Imphal West for further
proceedings as per law.
P a g e | 23 [22] With these observations and directions, the present petition is allowed. No cost.
Send a copy of this order to learned FTSC No.1, Manipur for information.
