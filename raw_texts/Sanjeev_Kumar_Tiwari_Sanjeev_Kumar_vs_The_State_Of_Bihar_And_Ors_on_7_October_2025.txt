ORAL JUDGMENT
Date : 07-10-2025
1. The petitioner has filed the instant
application for the following reliefs:
"For quashing the modified
time table issued by the Secretary,
S.T.A, Bihar (Respondent no 3) to the
petitioner for his Permanent Inter State
Stage Carriage Permit no 35/2018
covered with Bus No BR-06PD-8224 and
BR-06PD-8227, valid for the period
01.09.2018
to 31.08.2023 on the route Chapra to Siliguri as contained in Annexure-4 to this writ petition,
whereby the Learned Secretary Patna High Court CWJC No.22539 of 2018 dt.07-10-2025
(Respondent no 3) of its own without any order of the S.T.A, Bihar or any request made by the
petitioner, modified the proposed time table after curtailing the arrival and departure timing of the
notified bus stand lying between the route which has already been sanctioned and granted by the
State Transport Authority, Bihar in favour of the petitioner in the meeting of S.T.A, Bihar dated
24.07.2018 proceeding of which has been signed on 25.07.2018, and be pleased to grant the

proposed time table to the petitioner's permit."
2. The petitioner challenges the modification of the proposed time table for the Inter-State Stage
Carriage Permit granted by the State Transport Authority (S.T.A.), Bihar, for the route Chapra to
Siliguri.
3. The factual matrix, as stated by the petitioner, is as follows: pursuant to a Reciprocal Transport
Agreement between the States of Bihar and West Bengal, published in the Bihar Gazette on
9.5.2016, ten vacancies were notified for Inter- Patna High Court CWJC No.22539 of 2018
dt.07-10-2025 State Stage Carriage Permits on the route from Chapra to Siliguri. The petitioner
submitted an application in the prescribed form with the requisite fees and a proposed time table.
Objections were invited by publishing the proposed time table on the official website; further
objections were received, the S.T.A. included the petitioner's application in its agenda for the
meeting held on 24.07.2018. The permit was sanctioned in favour of the petitioner at this meeting
and the proceedings were signed on 25.07.2018. It is submitted that subsequently, the petitioner
furnished all requisite vehicle and other documents for issuance of the permit. The Permanent
Permit No. P.St.S 35/2018, along with the time table, was issued to the petitioner on 14.09.2018
(Annexure-4), and received by the petitioner on 21.09.2018.
4. The Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that upon receipt, the petitioner came to know
that the S.T.A. had unilaterally modified the originally proposed time Patna High Court CWJC
No.22539 of 2018 dt.07-10-2025 table by deleting the arrival and departure timings at several
notified bus terminals along the route Araria, Purniea, Dalkhola, Kishanganj and Islampur. It is
further submitted that this deletion was contrary to Clause (xiii) of the Reciprocal Transport
Agreement, which mandates that both reciprocating states i.e., State of Bihar and State of West
Bengal shall allow stage carriages of the other state to pick up and set down passengers at their
respective notified bus terminals.
5. The Learned counsel for the petitioner also submitted that Section 2(40) of the Motor Vehicles
Act, 1988, defines "stage carriage". Clause (XIII) of Reciprocal Transport Agreemnet contains that
"Both the reciprocating State carriage of other State to pick up and set down the passengers from
their respective notified but terminal. Furthermore, Section 2(38) of the Act defines "route" as a line
of travel with specified highways and via points, which include notified bus terminals where
stoppages can be scheduled. The unilateral deletion of halt timings by the S.T.A. Patna High Court
CWJC No.22539 of 2018 dt.07-10-2025 without the petitioner's consent and without any order
authorizing such modification, is illegal and contrary to the Motor Vehicles Act and the Reciprocal
Transport Agreement. The petitioner emphasizes that the revised time table envisages a continuous
journey of approximately 8 hours without any halts, which is impracticable and contravenes Section
91 of the Motor Vehicles Act read with Section 15 of the Motor Transport Workers Act, 1961. These
provisions mandate rest intervals for drivers and workers, and reasonable stoppages for passenger
comfort, including access to essential facilities such as restrooms.
6. The Learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted that the S.T.A. office has acted without
jurisdiction and committed a gross illegality by issuing a time table inconsistent with statutory
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91966257/ 2
Sanjeev Kumar Tiwari @ Sanjeev Kumar ... vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 7 October, 2025
provisions and the agreement. Since there is no statutory remedy of appeal or revision available
against issuance or modification of time tables, the petitioner has approached this Court invoking
writ jurisdiction for redressal of his Patna High Court CWJC No.22539 of 2018 dt.07-10-2025
grievance.
7. By filing a supplementary affidavit, the petitioner brought on record the renewal of the permit. It
is submitted that after expiry of the permanent Inter State Stage carriage Permit No. 35/2018
(W.B.), which was valid for the period 01.09.2018 to 31.08.2023 (Annexure-4), the permit granting
authority i.e. State Transport Authority, Bihar, Patna further renewed the permit for 5 years w.e.f.
01.09.2023 to 31.08.2028 vide order dated 07.06.2023 of the Secretary, S.T.A., Bihar, Patna.
8. The Learned counsel for the respondents submitted that the Government of Bihar, in exercise of
powers conferred under Section 88(5) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, issued a draft notification of
the proposed Reciprocal Transport Agreement between the States of Bihar and West Bengal. This
draft was published in the Bihar Gazette on 26.05.2014, inviting objections and suggestions within
30 days, in accordance with the statutory procedure. Following receipt of objections from various
Patna High Court CWJC No.22539 of 2018 dt.07-10-2025 transport owners, associations, and the
public, the State Transport Commissioner, Government of Bihar, conducted a hearing on
02.07.2015, duly considering all representations. After disposal of objections, the final Reciprocal
Transport Agreement was published in the Bihar Gazette (Extraordinary) on 09.05.2016 in full
compliance with Section 88(5) of the Motor Vehicles Act.
9. The Learned counsel for the respondents further submitted that under this Agreement, vacancies
for Interstate Stage Carriage Permits were created for various routes, including the route from
Chapra to Siliguri via Darbhanga and Pratapganj. Ten permits were allocated to each state for this
route. The State Transport Authority, Bihar, accordingly invited applications for permits on the said
route. It is further submitted that in response, the petitioner filed an application along with the
proposed time table and requisite fees. Objections were invited, and the petitioner's application was
placed before the State Transport Authority on 24.07.2018. After considering the Patna High Court
CWJC No.22539 of 2018 dt.07-10-2025 comparative merits, the Authority granted the permit
subject to submission of all valid documents.
10. It is further submitted that the petitioner's proposed time table was not in conformity with the
"via" points specified in the Agreement. No permit can be granted for operations beyond the
prescribed via points-- Darbhanga and Pratapganj. Consequently, the time table allotted to the
petitioner only includes timings at these via points in strict compliance with the terms of the
Agreement.
11. The Learned counsel for the respondents submitted that further, Clause (xiii) of the Reciprocal
Transport Agreement permits stage carriages to pick up and set down the passengers only at their
respective notified bus terminals, but this does not authorize allotment of time tables for all bus
terminals falling within the route's via. The permit-issuing authority has the discretion to fix the
time table while avoiding timing clashes with other operators on the same or overlapping routes.

12. The Learned counsel for the respondents lastly submitted that in the aforesaid view of the
matter, the relief sought by the petitioner, which challenges the modification of the time table and
inclusion of only certain notified terminals, is contrary to the terms and conditions of the Reciprocal
Transport Agreement and the applicable law and the writ petition lacks merit and is liable to be
dismissed in the interest of justice.
13. Heard the Learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the Learned counsel for the respondents.
14. During the course of arguments, the Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that, after the
expiry of the permanent Inter-State Stage Carriage Permit, the competent authority had renewed
the said permit for a further period of five years.
15. Upon prayer made by Learned counsel for the petitioner, this Court, vide order dated
20.08.2025, directed the petitioner to bring Patna High Court CWJC No.22539 of 2018
dt.07-10-2025 on record the renewal of the permit.
16. In compliance, the petitioner filed a supplementary affidavit, bringing on record Annexure-5,
whereby Inter-State Stage Carriage Permit No. 35/2018(W.B.), originally valid from 01.09.2018 to
31.08.2023 (Annexure-4), was renewed by the competent authority--namely, the State Transport
Authority, Bihar, Patna--for an additional period of five years with effect from 01.09.2023 to
31.08.2028, as per the order dated 07.06.2023 issued by the Secretary, S.T.A., Bihar.
17. This Court has perused the order of renewal of the permit by the competent authority and finds
that the permit remains valid until 31.08.2028.
18. Based on the facts and circumstances stated above, and upon due consideration of the
submissions, this Court is of the considered opinion that the modified time table issued by the
Secretary, S.T.A., Bihar (Annexure-4) is not sustainable in law, as it was issued contrary to the terms
of the permit, the relevant legal Patna High Court CWJC No.22539 of 2018 dt.07-10-2025
provisions, and despite the fact that the competent authority had already renewed the permit for a
further period up to 31.08.2028.
19. Accordingly, Annexure-4 is hereby quashed and set aside.
20. As such, the writ petition stands allowed.
21. Interlocutory Application(s), if any, shall stands disposed of.
