JUDGMENT & ORDER
(CAV)
[1] Heard Mr. Th. Khagemba, learned counsel appearing for the
petitioners, Mr. Y. Ashang, learned Government Advocate for the State respondents and Mr. U.
Augusta, learned counsel for the respondent No.3. WP(C) NO. 644 OF 2023: L. ARENKUMAR
SINGH & ORS. V. STATE OF MANIPUR & ORS. 2 [2] The petitioners are the Care Taker Councilors
of the Ward No. 4, 3 & 2 of the Imphal Municipal Corporation (IMC), respectively. [3] The
petitioners were allowed to continue as Care Taker Councilors of the concerned Urban Local Bodies
of the IMC vide order dated 06.03.2023 issued by the Under Secretary (MAHUD), Government and
Manipur. Even after expiry of their 5(five) year tenure, the Imphal Municipal Corporation has been
implementing various programs under the 15 th Finance Commission award tied Grant and untied
Grant installment 2020-21. [4] On 29.08.2022 the Director (MAHUD) Government of Manipur
wrote a letter to the Municipal for submission of work program to be implemented under 15th
Finance commission - Basic Grant (tied) 2nd installment 2020-21. On 23.06.2023 the Director
(MAHUD), Government of Manipur informed the Municipal Commissioner, IMC that the
Government has conveyed approval for work programmes constituting 25% (Corporation Level) to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/94520596/ 2
Shri. Laishram Arenkumar Singh ... vs The State Of Manipur Through The ... on 29 November, 2023
be implemented under 15th Finance Commission - Basic Grant (Tied), 2nd Installment 2020-21. A
sum of Rs. 2,00,87,817(Rupees two crore Eighty Seven Thousand Eight Hundred and Seventeen)
only were released to the respective Municipal Corporation through Public Financial Management
System (PFMS). The Municipal Commissioner, IMC submitted revised work programme to be
implemented under the 15th Finance Commission, Basic Grant (tied), 2nd WP(C) NO. 644 OF 2023:
L. ARENKUMAR SINGH & ORS. V. STATE OF MANIPUR & ORS. 3 Installment 2020-21 for an
amount of Rs.6,02,63,450/-(Rupees Six Crore Two Lakh Sixty Three Thousand Four Hundred
Fifty). Joint Secretary (MAHUD), Government of Manipur wrote a letter dated 16.08.2023 to the
Director (MAHUD) Manipur by informing that State Government may execute the work of 75%
under 15th Finance Commission - Basic Grant (Tied) 2nd Installment 2020-21 and 15th Finance
Commission - Basic Grant (Untied) 2nd Installment 2020-21 in respect of Imphal Municipal
Corporation since the term of 5(Five) years of Ward Development Committee of Imphal Municipal
Corporation has expired. Since the above letter is discriminatory, the Ward Councilors/Corporators
(Caretaker) of Imphal Corporation submitted a representation on 18.08.2023 to the Commissioner
(MAHUD) Government of Manipur for withdrawal of the letter dated 16.08.2023. [5] It is stated
that no step has been taken to the representation submitted by the petitioners and other elected
members. It is further stated that for other Municipal Councils and Nagar Palikas, the works are
being executed by the Ward Development Committee even after the expired of the 5(five) years
tenure. In Para 7, the petitioners have cited the case of the Nambol Municipal Corporation where
the Ex-Care Taker/ Councilors were permitted to execute the work under 15th Finance Commission.
[6] Vide order dated 15.09.2023, this Court issued notice. However, counter affidavit has not been
filed by the respondents. On 18.10.2023 this WP(C) NO. 644 OF 2023: L. ARENKUMAR SINGH &
ORS. V. STATE OF MANIPUR & ORS. 4 Court took on record an additional affidavit dated
16.10.2023 filed by the petitioners indicating that the elected members of the other Municipal
Councils such as Nambol Municipal Council, Kakching Municipal Council and Thoubal Municipal
Council are permitted to undertake the work allocated under 15 th Finance Commission by the Care
taker Councilors/members/ even after the expiry of 5(Five) years' time.
[7] Mr. Th. Khagemba learned counsel for the petitioners submits that singling out of the Imphal
Municipal Corporation by the impugned order dated 16.08.2023 issued by the Joint Secretary
(MAHUD) Government of Manipur for taking up the work under 15th Finance Commission
allocated to the Imphal Municipal Corporation to be executed by the State Government is highly
arbitrary, illegal and discriminatory. The learned counsel for the petitioners further submits that the
impugned order dated 16.08.2023 may be set aside and the petitioners and others similarly situated
persons of Imphal Municipal Council may be permitted to execute the work earmarked under 15 th
Finance Commission award.
[8] This Court has considered the submissiosn made at the Bar and the materials on record. The
State respondents have not filed any counter affidavit. From the materials record, it is seen that for
other Municipal Councils such as the Nambol Municipal Council, Thoubal Municipal Council etc.,
the WP(C) NO. 644 OF 2023: L. ARENKUMAR SINGH & ORS. V. STATE OF MANIPUR & ORS. 5
Care Taker Councilors/members are permitted to execute the work under 15 th Finance Commission
award even after the expiry of their 5(five) years tenure. However, in the case of the Imphal
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/94520596/ 3
Shri. Laishram Arenkumar Singh ... vs The State Of Manipur Through The ... on 29 November, 2023
Municipal Corporation, the State respondents had issued a letter dated 16.08.2023 for taking up the
work by the State Government as the 5(five) years terms of the Ward Development Committee of the
Imphal Corporation has expired and no reason is provided for singling out of Imphal Municipal
Corporation for denying the work to be executed by the Care Taker/ members of the Ward
Committee. In the case of other Municipal Corporations, the same work is allowed to be executed by
the similarly situated persons as the Petitioners herein. Reference may be made to the decision of
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Re. Special Courts Bill MANU/SC/0039/1978: [1979] 2SCR476 which
held as under:
"4. The principle underlying the guarantee of Article 14 is not that the same rules of
law should be applicable to all persons within the Indian territory or that the same
remedies should be made available to them irrespective of differences of
circumstances. It only means that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated
alike both in privileges conferred and liabilities imposed. Equal laws would have to be
applied to all in the same situation, and there should be no discrimination between
one person and another if as regards the subject matter of the legislation their
position is substantially the same."
WP(C) NO. 644 OF 2023: L. ARENKUMAR SINGH & ORS. V. STATE OF MANIPUR & ORS. 6 [9]
This Court is of the view that the content of the letter dated 16.08.2023 issued by the Joint Secretary
(MAHUD) Government of Manipur to the Director (MAHUD) Manipur for undertaking the work
under 15 th Finance Commission entrusted to the Imphal Municipal Corporation on expiry of the
terms of the various Committee is discriminatory and violates the principle of equality as enshrined
in the article 14 of the Constitution. In the present case without assigning any reason equals have
been treated unequally. [10] Accordingly the impugned order dated 16.08.2023 issued by the Joint
Secretary (MAHUD) is set aside and petitioners are allowed to execute the work under the 15th
Finance Commission-Basic Grant (Tied) and (Untied) 2nd instalment 2020-21.
[11] There will be no order as to costs.
