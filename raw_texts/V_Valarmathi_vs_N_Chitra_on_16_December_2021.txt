V.Valarmathi vs N.Chitra on 16 December, 2021
This Criminal Appeal has been filed by the appellant/complainant to set aside the order of acquittal
dated 02.06.2017 made in C.A.No.179 of 2016 on the file of the II Additional District and Sessions
Court, Erode, reversing the Order dated 03.10.2016 made in S.T.C.No.153 of 2014 on the file of the
learned Judicial Magistrate, Fast Track Court, No.II, Erode.
2. The facts of the case in brief are as follows:
This case has arisen due to dishonour of the cheque issued by the respondent
/accused. The appellant in this appeal is the complainant before the trial Court. The
appellant/complainant has filed a private complaint against the respondent/accused
to punish him for the offence under Sec. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. 1883.
2.1. It is alleged in the complaint that the accused had availed a loan of
Rs.25,00,000/- from the complainant on 10.01.2013; on the same day, the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis accused had issued a post dated cheque (Ex.P.1)
dated 21.01.2014 for a sum of Rs.25,00,000/-, drawn on City Union Bank,
Thiruchengodu Branch.
When the complainant presented the cheque for collection through his Karur Vysya Bank, Erode
Branch, it was returned on 25.01.2014 as “Payment Stopped by the drawer”. Thereafter, the
complainant issued a statutory notice to the accused on 25.01.2014 and the notice was returned on
28.01.2014 as refused, and thereafter, the complainant has filed the private complaint before the
Court against the accused for the commission of offence under Sec.138 of the Negotiable
Instruments Act.
2.2. Thereafter, the case was taken on file and during the course of trial, on the side of the
complainant, the complainant was examined herself as PW.1 and six documents were marked as
Exs.P.1 to P.6. On the side of the accused, three witnesses have been examined as DWs.1 to D.W.3
and Exs.D.1 to D.9 were marked.
3. After the conclusion of the trial and on considering the materials
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis available on record, the learned trial Judge found the accused
guilty for the offence under Sec.138 N.I. Act and convicted and sentenced him to undergo one year
simple imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs.5000/-, in default to undergo three months simple
imprisonment. The accused challenged the above judgement by filing an appeal before the II
Additional Sessions Court, Erode in Crl.A.No.179 of 2016 and the same was allowed and the
judgement of the trial Court was set aside. Aggrieved over that, the complainant has preferred this
Criminal Appeal.
4. Heard the submissions of Mr. Arun Anbumani, learned Counsel for the Appellant/complainant
and Mr. N.Manokaran, learned Counsel for the respondent/accused.
5. The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the learned Appellate Judge has himself held
that the preponderance of probabilities is in favour of the respondent/accused and that the alleged
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/2356794/ 2
V.Valarmathi vs N.Chitra on 16 December, 2021
transaction between the appellant/complainant and the respondent/accused is false and that the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis cheque was not issued for legally enforceable debt. It is further
submittted that if the executants admits the execution of the cheque, the holder of the cheque is
entitled to a presumption that the cheque was issued for a legally enforceable debt. But the learned
Appellate Judge had wrongly dislodged the said presumption and acquitted the accused by
accepting the improbable defence taken up by the respondent/accused. In support of his arguments,
the learned counsel for the Appellant/complainant relied on the following citations:
S.No. Name of the parties Citation particulars 1 Rangappa Vs Sri Mohan 2010(11)SSC
441 2 Uttam Ram Vs. Devinder Singh Hudan and 2019 (10) SCC 287 another 3
Sumeti Vij Vs. Paramount Tech Fab 2021(2)CTC 579 Industries
6. The learned counsel for the respondent/accused submitted that the impugned cheque was not
issued by the respondent/accused for discharging any legally enforceable debt; but it was stolen by
the appellant/complainant and it was misused to file this case. Further the petitioner/complainant
does https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis not have any financial capability to give such a hefty sum of
Rs.25,00,000/- as loan to the accused. Though the initial presumption lies in favour of the
complainant, if the same was rebutted through contrary proof offered by the accused, then the initial
presumption as to legally enforceable debt will get reversed. It is further submitted that in order to
disprove the initial presumption the accused need not even get into the box and substantiate his
defence and it is sufficient if the improbabilities of the case of the complainant is exposed before the
Court. The learned counsel for the respondent relied on the following decisions in support of his
defence:
S.No. Name of the parties Citation particulars 1 Basalinga Vs.Mudibasappa 2019(5)
SCC 418 2 John K.Abraham Vs. Simon C.Abraham 2014(2) SCC 236 3 John K.John
Vs. Tom Varghese and another 2007(12) SCC 714 4 Kumar Exports Vs. Sharma
Carpets 2009(2) SCC 513 5 Chandrappa and others Vs. State of 2007(4) SCC 415
Karnataka https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
7. The point for consideration is Whether the judgment of the learned Sessions Judge in acquitting
the accused from the offence under sec.138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act basing on the
materials available on record is fair and proper?
8. The complainant and the accused are already known to each other as family friends. The
respondent/ accused is working as an appraiser in the City Union Bank, Thiruchencode. The
husband of the accused is doing jewellery business. The signature in the cheque (Ex.P.1) was not
disputed by the accused. However she has stated that since the cheque was stolen by the
petitioner/complainant she advised her banker to stop payment. It is claimed by the
petitioner/complainant that the presumption under Sec.139 of the Negotiable Instrument Act
cannot be denied to the complainant if the execution of the cheque was not disputed and no rebuttal
evidence is produced to shatter the said presumption.

9. Both the presumption contemplated under Sec.118 and 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act are
mandatory presumptions. It is relevant to extract the provisions:
“Section 118 in The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 118 Presumptions as to
negotiable instruments. —Until the contrary is proved, the following presumptions
shall be made:
—
(a) of consideration —that every negotiable instrument was made or drawn for
consideration, and that every such instrument, when it has been accepted, indorsed,
negotiated or transferred, was accepted, indorsed, negotiated or transferred for
consideration;
(b) as to date —that every negotiable instrument bearing a date was made or drawn
on such date;
(c) as to time of acceptance —that every accepted bill of exchange was accepted
within a reasonable time after its date and before its maturity;
(d) as to time of transfer —that every transfer of a negotiable instrument was made
before its maturity;
(e) as to order of indorsements —that the indorsements appearing upon a negotiable
instrument were made in the order in which they appear thereon;
(f) as to stamps —that a lost promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque was duly
stamped;
(g) that holder is a holder in due course —that the holder of a negotiable instrument
is a holder in due course:
Provided that, where the instrument has been obtained from its lawful owner, or
from any person in lawful custody https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis thereof, by
means of an offence or fraud, or has been obtained from the maker or acceptor
thereof by means of an offence or fraud, or for unlawful consideration, the burden of
proving that the holder is a holder in due course lies upon him.
Section 139- Presumption in favour of holder—It shall be presumed, unless the
contrary is proved, that the holder of a cheque received the cheque of nature referred
to in Section 138 for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or other liability.”
10. The complainant who was examined as PW.1, has stated in her evidence that she had sold an
extent of 83 cents of her lands in favour of the accused for a sum of Rs.42,52,000/-. A witness of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/2356794/ 4
V.Valarmathi vs N.Chitra on 16 December, 2021
accused was examined as DW.2, and he has stated in his evidence that he only made arrangements
for selling the complainant’s land in favour of the accused. Despite the sale, the petitioner
/complainant had executed a power of attorney document dated 12.06.2013 in favour of the
accused. On the very same day, when the power document was executed in favour of the
respondent/accused, the complainant and her daughters had executed a
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis receipt (Ex.D.2) in favour of the respondent/accused by stating
that as per the power document they were in receipt of the entire sale consideration of
Rs.22,50,000/- and there was no further dues.
11. The complaint transaction of Rs.25,00,000/- is said to have taken place on 10.11.2013, which is
subsequent to the execution of the above receipt dated 12.06.2013. It is pertinent to note from the
cross examination of DW.1, that the complainant had received the entire true sale consideration of
Rs.42,50,000/- from the accused. However the sale price is shown in the receipt as Rs.22,50,000/-.
From the pattern of documents executed between the parties during the above sale transactions
would show that the respondent had purchased the properties as a part of his real estate business.
12. During the pendency of these proceedings before the trial Court and after examination of PW.1,
the respondent /accused has sent a notice to the complainant, which is marked as Ex.D1. It is
alleged in the said notice that the property, which was sold in favour of the respondent had already
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis been encumbered by the complainant's husband and he had
executed the power document in favour of one Udhayakumar on 23.03.2008 and the said
Udhayakumar had entered into a sale agreement with one Murugesan. When PW.1 was confronted
about the facts in her evidence, she had stated that she had no knowledge about the above
transactions and the land in question was settled in her favour by her husband.
13. Whatever may be the antecedents and consequences of the property transactions between the
petitioner and the respondent, the fact remains that shortly before the sale transaction, it was the
respondent/accused, who had given money to the petitioner/complainant. Having sold the
complainant’s property in favour of the accused and having executed Ex.D2/ receipt by stating that
the accused had no more dues to her, it is surprising why the complainant had given another sum of
Rs.25,00,000/- as loan to the accused during the month of November-2013.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
14. Before adverting into the probative value of the rebuttal circumstances or proof, it is relevant to
highlight the defence of the accused. According to the respondent/accused, four cheques bearing
cheque Nos.001055, 001056, 001057 and 001058 were stolen. The account statement of the accused
has been produced by the defence and it is marked as Ex.D4 series. It is seen from Ex.D4 that on
20.09.2013 in connection with the cheque No.001055, a sum of Rs.112.36 has been debited from the
account of the respondent towards bank charges.
15. It is interesting to note from the evidence of PW.1 that the earlier cheque given by the accused for
a sum of Rs.5,00,000/- was dishonoured on 19.9.2013, ‘for want of funds’. When it was suggested to
PW.2 that the earlier dated cheque for Rs.5,00,000/- was returned only because the holder stopped
the payment, she asserted that it was retuned due to ‘insufficient funds’. It is difficult to understand
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/2356794/ 5
V.Valarmathi vs N.Chitra on 16 December, 2021
why the defacto complainant had given a very hefty loan of Rs.25,00,000/- to a person in the month
of November-2013 to a person, when the earlier cheque issued for the very
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis same person in the month of September-2013 for a sum of
Rs.5,00,000/- was dishonoured.
16. PW.1 has stated in her evidence that she did not have any proof to show that she was in
possession of Rs.25,00,000/- during the relevant period in order to give it as a loan to the
respondent/accused. As it stated already the standard for rebuttal proof can be inferred even from
the improbabilities exposed in the case of the prosecution. When the financial capability of the
complainant is challenged by showing a prima-facie proof or circumstance, it is obligatory on the
part of the complainant to substantiate her financial potential for lending the amount involved in
the cheque to the accused. But the petitioner/complainant has failed to undertake such an exercise
and rebuild the presumption once again in her favour.
17. In this context of reverse burden on the part of the accused, it is relevant to refer the judgement
of the Supreme Court reported 2019(5) SCC 418 [Basalingappa Vs.Mudibasappa]. The relevant
portion is under:
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis “20. A Three-Judge Bench of this Court in
Rangappa Vs. Sri Mohan, (2010) 11 SCC 441 had occasion to elaborately consider
provi- sions of Sections 138 and 139. In the above case, trial court had acquit- ted the
accused in a case relating to dishonour of cheque under Section
138. The High Court had reversed the judgment of the trial court con-
victing the accused. In the above case, the accused had admitted signa- tures on the cheque. This
Court held that where the fact of signature on the cheque is acknowledged, a presumption has to be
raised that the cheque pertained to a legally enforceable debt or liability, however, this presumption
is of a rebuttal nature and the onus is then on the accused to raise a probable defence. In Paragraph
No.13, following has been laid down:-
“13. The High Court in its order noted that in the course of the trial proceedings, the
accused had admitted that the signature on the impugned cheque (No. 0886322
dated 8-2- 2001) was indeed his own. Once this fact has been acknowledged, Section
139 of the Act mandates a presumption that the cheque pertained to a legally
enforceable debt or liability. This presumption is of a rebuttal nature and the onus is
then on the accused to raise a probable defence. With regard to the present facts, the
High Court found that the defence raised by the accused was not probable.”
21. After referring to various other judgments of this Court, this Court in that case
held that the presumption mandated by Section 139 of the Act does indeed include
the existence of a legally enforceable debt or liability, which, of
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis course, is in the nature of a rebuttable
presumption. In paragraph No.26, following was laid down:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/2356794/ 6
V.Valarmathi vs N.Chitra on 16 December, 2021
“26. In light of these extracts, we are in agreement with the respondent claimant that
the presumption mandated by Section 139 of the Act does indeed include the
existence of a legally enforceable debt or liability. To that extent, the impugned
observations in Krishna Janardhan Bhat, (2008) 4 SCC 54 may not be correct.
However, this does not in any way cast doubt on the correctness of the decision in
that case since it was based on the specific facts and circumstances therein. As noted
in the citations, this is of course in the nature of a rebuttable presumption and it is
open to the accused to raise a defence wherein the existence of a legally enforceable
debt or liability can be contested. However, there can be no doubt that there is an
initial presumption which favours the complainant.”
22. Elaborating further, this Court held that Section 139 of the Act is an example of a
reverse onus and the test of proportion-
ality should guide the construction and interpretation of reverse onus clauses on the
defendant-accused and the defendant- accused cannot be expected to discharge an unduly high
standard of proof. In paragraph Nos. 27 and 28, following was laid down:-
“ 2 7 . S e c t i o n 1 3 9 o f t h e A c t i s a n e x a m p l e o f a r e v e r s e
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis onus clause that has been included in furtherance
of the legislative objective of improving the credibility of negotiable instruments.
While Section 138 of the Act specifies a strong criminal remedy in relation to the
dishonour of cheques, the rebuttable presumption under Section 139 is a device to
prevent undue delay in the course of litigation. However, it must be remembered that
the offence made punishable by Section 138 can be better described as a regulatory
offence since the bouncing of a cheque is largely in the nature of a civil wrong whose
impact is usually confined to the private parties involved in commercial transactions.
In such a scenario, the test of proportionality should guide the construction and
interpretation of reverse onus clauses and the defendant-accused cannot be expected
to discharge an unduly high standard of proof.
28.In the absence of compelling justifications, re-
verse onus clauses usually impose an evidentiary burden and not a persuasive burden. Keeping this
in view, it is a settled position that when an accused has to rebut the presumption under Section 139,
the standard of proof for doing so is that of “preponderance of probabilities”. Therefore, if the
accused is able to raise a probable defence which creates doubts about the existence of a legally
enforceable debt or liability, the prosecution can fail. As clarified in the citations, the accused can
rely on the materials submitted by the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis complainant in order to
raise such a defence and it is conceivable that in some cases the accused may not need to adduce
evidence of his/her own.”……….
25. We having noticed the ratio laid down by this Court in above cases on Sections 118(a) and 139,
we now summarize the principles enumerated by this Court in following manner:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/2356794/ 7
V.Valarmathi vs N.Chitra on 16 December, 2021
(i) Once the execution of cheque is admitted Section 139 of the Act mandates a
presumption that the cheque was for the discharge of any debt or other liability.
(ii) The presumption under Section 139 is a rebuttable presumption and the onus is
on the accused to raise the probable defence. The standard of proof for rebutting the
presumption is that of preponderance of probabilities.
(iii) To rebut the presumption, it is open for the accused to rely on evidence led by
him or accused can also rely on the materials submitted by the complainant in order
to raise a probable defence. Inference of preponderance of probabilities can be drawn
not only from the materials brought on record by the parties but also by reference to
the circumstances upon which they rely.
(iv) That it is not necessary for the accused to come in the witness box in support of
his defence, Section 139 im- posed an evidentiary burden and not a persuasive
burden.
(v) It is not necessary for the accused to come in the wit-
ness box to support his defence.” https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
18. So the standard of rebuttal proof that need to be produced by the accuses is not necessarily strict
proof beyond reasonable doubt. It is sufficient if the probabilities are proved through
preponderance. Hence, the accused need not necessarily get into the box and subject himself for
examination or produce any records of his own. And it is sufficient that he could bring out the
improbable facts and circumstances from the case of the complainant. Because the object of
punishment contemplated u/s 138 N.I. Act for dishonour of cheque is for improving the creditability
of the Negotiable Instruments exchanged during commercial transactions and to ensure business
viability and not the deterance of criminals.
19. Though it is open to the accused to cull out the improbabilities from the case of the complainant,
in the present case, the respondent /accused had come to the box and got herself examined. She was
also subjected to the examination by the complainant. The admissions given by PW.1 during her
cross-examination, the materials produced as defence side https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
documents coupled with the evidence of DW.3 would show that the accused did not take a casual
defence.
20. Though, it might be an exaggeration on the part of the accused to state that the complainant had
stolen away her cheques when she came come to her house in order to see her sick husband, there
are materials to probablise her defence that the impugned cheque was not supported by
consideration and it was not given for discharging a legally enforceable liability or debt. A person,
who already aggrieved due to non payment of a money-due by a debtor, would not dare to give an
another enhanced loan to the same debtor and that too without any security. This is especially clear
from the fact established by the defence through Ex.D2/receipt that after the sale transaction
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/2356794/ 8
V.Valarmathi vs N.Chitra on 16 December, 2021
between the complainant and the accused, the accused did not owe any money to her.
21. The appellate Court has evaluated the facts and circumstances and other materials available in
this case and gave due weight to the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis preponderance of
probabilities established by the defence. Since the case of the defence is more probable and strong
enough to improbabilise the case of the complainant, it has chosen to reverse the judgement of the
Trial Court. In my opinion, the judgement of the learned II Additional District and Sessions Court,
Erode does not suffer from any factual or legal infirmity and hence it does not warrant any
interference.
22. In the result this Criminal Appeal stands dismissed and the Judgement of the learned II
Additional District and Sessions Judge dated 02.06.2017 made in C.A.No. 179 of 2016 is upheld.
