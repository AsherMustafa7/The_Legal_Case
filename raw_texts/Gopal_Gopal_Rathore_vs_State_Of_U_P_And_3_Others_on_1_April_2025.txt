7. In Dr. Rajesh Talwar and another Vs. C.B.I. and another, (2014) 1 SCC 628, the Supreme Court
considered the issue of fair trial observing in Para 10, which is as under:-
"10. This Court in Selvi J. Jayalalithaa & Ors. v. State of Karnataka & Ors. (Writ
Petition (Crl.) No.154 of 2013) decided on 30.9.2013, after referring to its earlier
judgments in Triveniben Vs. State of Gujarat, AIR 1989 SC 1335; Zahira Habibullah
Sheikh and Another Vs. State of Gujarat and others, AIR 2006 SC 1367; Capt.
Amarinder Singh Vs. Prakash Singh Badal & Ors., (2009) 6 SCC 260; Mohd. Hussain
@ Julfikar Ali v. State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi), AIR 2012 SC 750; and Natasha Singh
Vs. CBI (State), (2013) 5 SCC 741, dealt with the issue of fair trial observing:
Fair trial is the main object of criminal procedure and such fairness should not be
hampered or threatened in any manner. Fair trial entails the interests of the accused,
the victim and of the society. Thus, fair trial must be accorded to every accused in the
spirit of right to life and personal liberty and the accused must get a free and fair, just
and reasonable trial on the charge imputed in a criminal case. Any breach or violation
of public rights and duties adversely affects the community as a whole and it becomes
harmful to the society in general. In all circumstances, the courts have a duty to
maintain public confidence in the administration of justice and such duty is to
vindicate and uphold the 'majesty of the law' and the courts cannot turn a blind eye to
vexatious or oppressive conduct that occurs in relation to criminal proceedings.
Denial of a fair trial is as much injustice to the accused as is to the victim and the
society. It necessarily requires a trial before an impartial judge, a fair prosecutor and
an atmosphere of judicial calm. Since the object of the trial is to mete out justice and
to convict the guilty and protect the innocent, the trial should be a search for the
truth and not a bout over technicalities and must be conducted under such rules as
will protect the innocent and punish the guilty. Justice should not only be done but

should be seem to have been done. Therefore, free and fair trial is a sine qua non of
Article 21 of the Constitution. Right to get a fair trial is not only a basic fundamental
right but a human right also. Therefore, any hindrance in a fair trial could be violative
of Article 14 of the Constitution.
xx xx xx xx Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides for the
right to a fair trial what is enshrined in Article 21 of our Constitution. Therefore, fair
trial is the heart of criminal jurisprudence and, in a way, an important facet of a
democratic polity and is governed by rule of law. Denial of fair trial is crucifixion of
human rights."
8. In the case of Natasha Singh Vs. C.B.I. (State), (2013) 5 SCC 741, the Supreme Court dealt with
the scope of discretionary power of Section 311, Cr.P.C. after referring the judgment of P. Sanjeeva
Rao Vs. State of A.P., AIR 2012 SC 2242, which is as under:-
"Grant of fairest opportunity to the accused to prove his innocence was the object of
every fair trial, observed this Court in Hoffman Andreas v. Inspector of Customs,
Amritsar, (2000) 10 SCC 430. The following passage is in this regard apposite:
`In such circumstances, if the new Counsel thought to have the material witnesses
further examined, the Court could adopt latitude and a liberal view in the interest of
justice, particularly when the Court has unbridled powers in the matter as enshrined
in Section 311 of the Code. After all the trial is basically for the prisoners and courts
should afford the opportunity to them in the fairest manner possible.' xxx xxx xxx xxx
We are conscious of the fact that recall of the witnesses is being directed nearly four
years after they were examined in chief about an incident that is nearly seven years
old..... we are of the opinion that on a parity of reasoning and looking to the
consequences of denial of opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses, we would
prefer to err in favour of the appellant getting an opportunity rather than protecting
the prosecution against a possible prejudice at his cost. Fairness of the trial is a virtue
that is sacrosanct in our judicial system and no price is too heavy to protect that
virtue. A possible prejudice to prosecution is not even a price, leave alone one that
would justify denial of a fair opportunity to the accused to defend himself."
9. It is admitted fact that the PW-2 and PW-3 has not been cross-examined by the present applicant
and the opportunity has been closed, after observing that none was present for applicant.
10. In view of the facts and circumstances of the case and keeping in mind the settled position of law
in Dr. Rajesh Talwar (supra) and Natasha Singh (supra), the present application is liable to be
allowed and the order dated 23.12.2024 is liable to be quashed. Hence, the present application u/s
528 of BNSS is accordingly, allowed and the order dated 23.12.2024 is set-aside. The trial court is
directed to issue summon to PW-2 and PW-3 for cross-examination and the cross-examination of
the aforesaid witnesses to be continued till the conclusion of the cross-examination on day to day
basis.
