aforesaid contract of which was given to

petitioner and remaining bill amount
has still not been paid to the petitioner.
The petitioner further prays for any
other relief(s) for which the petitioner
may be found entitled in the facts and
circumstances of the present case."
2. The brief facts as culled out from
the petition are that the petitioner, a registered
contractor, participated in Tender Notice No. W-
7/Tender/02/Open/DNR/07-08 dated 06.06.2007,
floated by the Railways for the aforementioned
contract work. Upon successful bidding, the
contract was duly awarded to the petitioner. It is
submitted that the petitioner was directed by the
Divisional Engineer, to deposit the performance
guarantee and commence the work, which he did
Patna High Court CWJC No.13010 of 2016 dt.14-10-2025
3/6
accordingly.
3. It is submitted by the Learned
counsel for the petitioner that due to non-
availability of essential railway materials and
simultaneous extension of time in the project area,
the execution of the contract work was delayed.
Multiple extensions for the date of completion were

sought and it was subsequently, granted by the
respondent authorities.
4. It is further submitted that after
completion of the work, the final bill was duly
prepared and submitted. However, the outstanding
dues amounting to Rs.4,63,520.72 was not
released despite repeated requests and
representations made by the petitioner. The
petitioner claims that withholding of dues is
arbitrary and in violation of his constitutional
rights.
5. A counter affidavit was filed by the
respondent Nos. 2 to 6.
6. It is submitted by the Learned
counsel for the respondents that the petitioner

4/6
failed to attend on the date of the final joint
measurement. The last date of completion was
31.10.2010
, and it is stated that the petitioner only appeared for final measurement in July 2011, after a lapse of
nearly nine months. By that time, was the said work was deleted from the sanctioned works list
(commonly referred to as the Railway "Pink Book") i.e. end of financial year. It is contended the
delay in completion that was attributable solely to the petitioner, due to his casual approach and
failure to deploy adequate manpower and equipment. The date of completion was extended five
times, on request of petitioner.
7. It is further submitted that all other dues, including the performance guarantee and security
deposit, have been paid to the petitioner and the respondents are in the process of re- appropriating

M/S Ramay Enterprise vs The Union Of India And Ors on 14 October, 2025
the required funds to facilitate payment of the final bill and have assured that the amount will be
disbursed once such re- appropriation is complete.
8. Heard the Learned counsel for the Patna High Court CWJC No.13010 of 2016 dt.14-10-2025
petitioner as well as the Learned counsel appearing for the respondents and perused the materials
available on record.
9. It is not in dispute that the work in question has been completed and that the final bill for
Rs.4,63,520.72 has been prepared and submitted. The only ground taken by the respondents for
non-payment of the said amount is the delay on the part of the petitioner in witnessing the final
measurement, which allegedly resulted in deletion of the work from the sanctioned list and thereby
deletion of funds allocated for the said project. While there may have been lapses on the part of the
petitioner in timely execution and witnessing of final measurements, the fact remains that the work
in question has been completed to the satisfaction of the Railways and a final bill has been drawn.
The petitioner cannot be made to suffer indefinitely due to procedural lapses and
inter-departmental fund management issues of the respondent authorities.
10. Admittedly, the work was Patna High Court CWJC No.13010 of 2016 dt.14-10-2025 completed
by 31.10.2010. The petitioner waited for 6 long years to his payment and was continued to file the
present Writ petition. This Court is of the considered view that the respondents are under a legal
obligation to ensure payment of the said contractual dues, after necessary re-appropriation of funds.
11. In view of the foregoing discussion, the writ petition is allowed. The respondents are directed to
release the outstanding amount of Rs.4,63,520.72 to the petitioner within a period of two months
from the date of receipt / production of a copy of this order.
12. With the above observations and directions, the writ petition is allowed.
13. Interlocutory Application, if any, shall stands disposed of.
