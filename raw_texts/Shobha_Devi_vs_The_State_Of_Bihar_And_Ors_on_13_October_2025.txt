petition are that the petitioner for establishing rice
mill took an electricity connection bearing Service
Connection No. AIR-3059, energized on 06.07.2012

3. It is submitted that the petitioner filed representation dated 07.01.2015 based on these grounds in
response to Letter No. 424, but no final order was passed under Section 126 of the Electricity Act.
Despite this, the electricity supply was disconnected on 31.03.2015, and a certificate proceeding was
initiated under the Bihar & Orissa Patna High Court CWJC No.8704 of 2018 dt.13-10-2025 Public
Demand Recovery Act, 1914, (hereinafter called as the PDR Act) for recovery of Rs. 7,71,843/-.
4. The Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that in the absence of a final assessment under
Section 126 of the Electricity Act, initiation of recovery under the PDR Act is illegal. It is further
submitted that without a final order, the petitioner is deprived of the statutory right to appeal under
Section 127 of the Electricity Act.
5. It is contended that the requisition for recovery filed by respondent no. 4 is defective and
incomplete, vitiating the proceedings initiated thereupon and the entire recovery proceeding are
contrary to the statutory scheme, thereby violating Articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of
India.
6. A counter affidavit was filed on behalf of the respondents wherein the respondents admitted the
inspection findings and the issuance of the provisional assessment.

7. The Learned counsel for the respondents submitted that the petitioner did not file objections
within the stipulated time.
8. It is argued that the certificate proceeding was validly initiated based on the provisional
assessment and the requisition was filed properly.
9. The respondents asserted that the petitioner should have availed the remedy under Section 10 of
the PDR Act before approaching the Writ court. They denied any violation of constitutional rights
and submitted that the certificate officer was the competent authority to adjudicate the objections.
10. Heard the Learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the Learned counsel for the respondents.
11. Upon hearing the parties and perusing the records, it is evident that the final order under Section
126 of the Electricity Act was not passed despite the petitioner having filed objections to the
provisional assessment due to this procedural Patna High Court CWJC No.8704 of 2018
dt.13-10-2025 lapse the petitioner could not avail the statutory right of appeal under Section 127 of
the Electricity Act.
12. Further, the initiation of certificate proceedings under the Bihar & Orissa Public Demand
Recovery Act, 1914, without finalization of the assessment process, is found to be premature and
legally unsustainable.

13. The Court also notes from the record that the petitioner has filed an objection under Section 9 of
the PDR Act, but the Certificate Officer has not yet passed any order under Section 10.
14. Under the facts and circumstances stated above, the Court finds it appropriate to remit the
matter to the Certificate Officer to decide the objections filed by the petitioner in accordance with
law.
15. In view of the foregoing discussions, the matter is remitted to the concerned Certificate Officer to
decide the objection filed by the petitioner under Section 10 of the Bihar & Orissa Patna High Court
CWJC No.8704 of 2018 dt.13-10-2025 Public Demand Recovery Act, 1914.
