(Per: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE S. B. PD. SINGH)
Date : 14-10-2025
Heard the parties.
2. The appellant-husband (Alok Kumar) has come
up in this appeal against judgment and decree dated
11.09.2018
passed by the learned Principal Judge, Family Court, Muzaffarpur in Matrimonial (Divorce) Case
No. 211 of 2013 whereby the petition filed by the appellant under Section 13(1)(i-a) of the Hindu
Marriage Act, 1955 (in short 'the 1955 Act') seeking dissolution of marriage by Patna High Court MA
No.996 of 2018 dt.14-10-2025 a decree of divorce, has been dismissed.
3. Succinctly, the marriage of appellant- Alok Kumar was solemnized with respondent-Anupma
Singh on 2nd December 2010 as per Hindu rites and ceremonies. The marriage was solemnized and
performed at Lichhavi Hotel, Imlichatti, Muzaffarpur. The marriage was duly consummated;

Alok Kumar vs Smt. Anupama Singh on 14 October, 2025
however, no child was born from the wedlock.
4. The pleaded case of appellant-husband in his petition filed under Section 13 (1)(i-a) of the 1955
Act was that appellant was employed in Merchant Navy. The marriage with the appellant was
arranged one. The case of the appellant, in short is that appellant got married with respondent
Anupma Singh on 02.12.2010 according to Hindu rites and rituals. The marriage was solemnized
and performed at Lichhavi Hotel, Imlichatti, Muzaffarpur. It is further alleged that after the
marriage, respondent came to her Sasural on 03.12.2010 where she was warmly welcomed by the
appellant's parents and relatives and she was offered valuable goods including cash and gold
ornaments. The behavior of the respondent since the date Patna High Court MA No.996 of 2018
dt.14-10-2025 of the marriage with the appellant and other in-laws was bad and the appellant
anyhow continued to live with the respondent for 15 days. It is further alleged that respondent
started pressurizing the appellant to go to her paternal hose and she stopped taking food and
sometimes she abused the appellant and his family members. Lastly, on 28.01.2011, the respondent
went to her Maike along with her brother taking all her articles without any information. By this act
of the respondent, appellant felt humiliation and he also made complaint to his in-laws but the
family members of the respondent did not respond. It is further alleged that on 30.01.2011, the
appellant visited to the parental house of the respondent and requested her to join him at his house
but she refused then appellant came back to his house and went to his place of posting on
31.01.2011. It is further alleged that the father of the appellant regularly visited to the paternal house
of the respondent about her well being but respondent did not behave properly with the father of the
appellant and respondent was not ready to come back to her Sasural, rather she remained abusive
with the appellant and other family members. It is alleged that Patna High Court MA No.996 of
2018 dt.14-10-2025 when the appellant returned from his service to his house on leave, at that time
also, the respondent was in her parental house and she did not join the appellant in her matrimonial
house and on request by the appellant to his in-laws to send respondent to her matrimonial house,
the same was refused and told that she would never back to her Sasural. It is further alleged that the
behavior of the respondent with the appellant was never good after 28.01.2011 and she kept the
appellant away from herself and whenever the appellant tried to pursue her, she used to abuse the
appellant and threatened that if he insisted further to go to her Sasural, she would commit suicide
and get him and his family members in jail. The respondent deliberately denied for any cohabitation
with the appellant about for the last two and half years as respondent is living at her paternal house
without any rhyme and reason and by this attitude of the respondent, the appellant suffered great
mental shock and he is gradually becoming sick while respondent is enjoying at her parents house.
The further case of the appellant is that by way of last chance, he along with his father and relatives
came to the parental Patna High Court MA No.996 of 2018 dt.14-10-2025 house of the respondent
on 30.05.2013 and requested her to go along with him but she refused. The appellant, thereafter
arranged a Punchayati where the respondent flatly refused to live with the applicant. The
matrimonial relation between the appellant and respondent has already irretrievably broken down
and there is no hope of restoration of their conjugal life. Hence, the divorce petition was filed by the
appellant for dissolution of marriage between the parties.
5. The respondent-wife appeared and filed her written statement and submitted that the instant case
is fit to be dismissed as it is not maintainable either in eye of law or on fact. It is further submitted
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/90640992/ 2
Alok Kumar vs Smt. Anupama Singh on 14 October, 2025
that marriage of the appellant with the respondent was solemnized on 02.12.2010 and she stayed at
her matrimonial home till 10 February 2011. She has alleged that at the time of the marriage,
appellant was working as Marin Engineer at Varun Shipping and after return of the appellant to his
place of posting, in-laws family members subjected her to the worst type of cruelty on small issues.
The allegation made about abusive behaviour is totally incorrect rather Patna High Court MA
No.996 of 2018 dt.14-10-2025 she was subjected to abuse and assault by the members of the
appellant's family. It is further asserted that in the absence of the appellant, the in-laws drove her
out from the matrimonial house. The appellant never intervened regarding ill behaviour by his
family members with the respondent. The father of the respondent was in government service and
to the best of his ability, he fulfilled the demand and after marriage also, he fulfilled the dowry
demand. The father of the respondent had booked a flat in Sahara City Home Centre at Gaziabad in
the name of his daughter (respondent) and after having came to know about this, the appellant and
his family members mounted pressure upon her to sell the flat. The respondent was initially not
interested to take refund of the deposited money against the booked flat, but in order to satisfy the
demands of her in-laws, she sold the property and she could earn respect for sometime till she was
able to meet the requirements of the sale proceeds of the flat. It is further alleged that respondent
tolerated all humiliation and insult for the safeguard of her marriage but the behavior of the in-laws
became bad to worst when the Patna High Court MA No.996 of 2018 dt.14-10-2025 entire money of
the sale proceeds of the flat was exhausted. It is further alleged that in the month of December 2011,
the respondent was driven out forcefully and the appellant also maintained distance from her and
supported the misdeeds of his family members. The father of appellant is an alcoholic and after
consuming liquor he used to pass lewd comments and indecent abuses against the respondent and
there was none in the family who can support her in absence of her husband. It is further alleged
that appellant is now Captain of the ship and he can keep the respondent with him but he never
cared for taking her to his place of posting and now, he has developed interest outside his marriage
and extra marital relationship was becoming deeper day by day and that is why her husband is not
willing to keep her at her place of posting. It is also asserted that the income of the appellant is about
one crore per annum but he is hardly taking interest to financially support his legally wedded wife
who is totally dependent upon him. The respondent denied to have any Punchayati held on
30.05.2013 and also denied that she has left the matrimonial home, to the contrary she alleged that
she was Patna High Court MA No.996 of 2018 dt.14-10-2025 not allowed to stay at her matrimonial
house and even she was not allowed by the appellant to live with him at his place of posting. It is
further alleged that being a traditional lady she can not think to live without her husband or to
dissolve the marriage. Hence, the respondent prays to dismissed the matrimonial suit filed for
dissolution of marriage.
6. On conclusion of the trial and considering the material evidences available on record, learned
Principal Judge, Family Court, Patna held that the appellant- husband has not established his case
for divorce on the ground of cruelty and desertion. Accordingly, the matrimonial suit, filed for
dissolution of marriage has been dismissed on contest. The appellant-husband, aggrieved by the
said judgment of the learned Family Court filed the instant appeal before this Court.
7. Learned counsel for the appellant-husband submits that the learned Family Court has erred in
law and facts both in not allowing the divorce petition filed by the appellant-husband. The marriage
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/90640992/ 3
Alok Kumar vs Smt. Anupama Singh on 14 October, 2025
of the appellant with the respondent was solemnized on 02.12.2010 according to Patna High Court
MA No.996 of 2018 dt.14-10-2025 Hindu rites and rituals. The marriage was consummated though
no child was was born out of the wedlock. The behavior of the respondent since the date of the
marriage with the appellant and other in-laws was bad and the appellant anyhow continued to live
with the respondent for 15 days. Lastly, on 28.01.2011, the respondent went to her Maike along with
her brother taking all her articles without any information. On 30.01.2011, the appellant visited to
the parental house of the respondent and requested her to join him at his house but she refused then
appellant came back to his house and went to his service place on 31.01.2011. The appellant and
other in-laws family members of the respondent made all efforts to bring the respondent back to her
matrimonial house but all their efforts went in vein. The respondent deliberately denied for any
cohabitation with the appellant about for the last two and half years as respondent is living at her
paternal house without any rhyme and reason and by this attitude of the respondent, the appellant
suffered great mental shock and he is gradually becoming sick while respondent is enjoying at her
parents house. It is further submitted that Patna High Court MA No.996 of 2018 dt.14-10-2025 the
appellant along with his father and relatives came to the parental house of the respondent on
30.05.2013 and requested her to go along with him but she refused. The appellant, thereafter
arranged a Punchayati where the respondent flatly refused to live with the applicant. It is further
alleged that after filing of the present divorce petition, as a counter blast and for the sake of
vengeance and with a mala fide intention, the respondent has filed Domestic Violence Complaint
Case No. 847 of 2015 before learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Muzaffarpur. She has also filed
Complaint Case No. 1158 of 2015 against the appellant and other in-laws family members on
15.05.2015 under Sections 498(A) and other provisions of the Indian Penal Code, in which they are
on bail.
8. Learned counsel further submits that appellant- husband is paying Rs. 10,000/- per month to the
respondent as maintenance in pursuance to the order of learned Family Court dated 12.09.2013.
The order-sheets of learned Court below clearly demonstrates that several efforts were made by the
Court below to reconcile the issue between the appellant and the respondent, but it was Patna High
Court MA No.996 of 2018 dt.14-10-2025 the respondent, who does not want to reconcile the issue
with the appellant. Learned counsel also submits that due to the lackadaisical approach of the
respondent, the dispute could not be settled before the Mediation Center of this Hon'ble Court also.
9. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant-husband has brought on record by way of
affidavit, the proposal for permanent alimony wherein the appellant has offered Rs. 50 lakhs to the
respondent as permanent alimony.
10. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent-wife, however, has not accepted the
proposal of permanent alimony of the appellant-husband and submits that appellant-husband is
getting salary of Rs. 1 crore per annum and keeping in view the income of the appellant-husband
and the dependency of the respondent- wife completely on her old aged persons, an amount of Rs.
50 lakhs does not appear to be appropriate. The respondent, however, agrees for mutual divorce, if
appellant is ready to pay Rs. 90 lakhs as permanent alimony.

Alok Kumar vs Smt. Anupama Singh on 14 October, 2025
11. Considering the submissions advanced on behalf of the appellant-husband and the
respondent-wife, we find that the marriage between the appellant-husband and respondent-wife
have irretrievably been broken and forcing them to continue their matrimonial relationship will be
an abuse of the process of law where both sides does not want to continue their matrimonial
relationship.
12. Accordingly, the judgment and decree dated 11.09.2018 passed by the learned Principal Judge,
Family Court, Muzaffarpur in Matrimonial (Divorce) Case No. 211 of 2013 is hereby set aside and
the marriage between the appellant and the respondent which was solemnized on 02.12.2010 is
dissolved by a decree of divorce.
13. Registry is directed to prepare the decree accordingly.
14. So far as grant of permanent alimony to the respondent-wife is concerned, it is useful to refer to
Section 25 of the 1955 Act, which reads thus:-
"Section 25. Permanent alimony and maintenance: (1) Any Court exercising
jurisdiction under this Act may, at the time of passing any decree or Patna High
Court MA No.996 of 2018 dt.14-10-2025 at any time subsequent thereto, on
application made to it for the purpose by either the wife or the husband, as the case
may be, order that the respondent shall pay to the appellant for her or his
maintenance and support such gross sum or such monthly or periodical sum for a
term not exceeding the life of the applicant as, having regard to the respondent's own
income and other property, if any, the income and other property of the applicant
(the conduct of the parties and other circumstances of the case), it may seem to the
Court to be just, and any such payment may be secured, if necessary, by a charge on
the immovable property of the respondent."
15. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Rajnesh v. Neha reported in (2021) 2 SCC 324,
provided a comprehensive criterion and list of factors to be looked into while deciding the question
of permanent alimony. This judgment lays down an elaborate and comprehensive framework
necessary for deciding the amount of maintenance in all matrimonial proceedings, with specific
Patna High Court MA No.996 of 2018 dt.14-10-2025 emphasis on permanent alimony and the same
has been reiterated by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Kiran Jyot Maini v. Anish Pramod Patel reported
in 2024 SCC OnLine SC 1724.
16. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Pravin Kumar Jain v. Anju Jain reported in 2024 SCC
OnLine SC 3678 has taken note of the various judgments to clarify the position of law with regard to
determination of permanent alimony and the factors that need to be considered in order to arrive at
a just, fair, and reasonable amount of permanent alimony. In para 31 it is held as under:
"31. There cannot be strict guidelines or a fixed formula for fixing the amount of
permanent maintenance.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/90640992/ 5
Alok Kumar vs Smt. Anupama Singh on 14 October, 2025
The quantum of maintenance is subjective to each case and is dependent on various
circumstances and factors. The Court needs to look into factors such as income of
both the parties; conduct during the subsistence of marriage; their individual social
and financial status; personal expenses of each of the parties; their individual
capacities and duties to Patna High Court MA No.996 of 2018 dt.14-10-2025
maintain their dependents; the quality of life enjoyed by the wife during the
subsistence of the marriage; and such other similar factors. This position was laid
down by this Court in Vinny Paramvir Parmar v. Paramvir Parmar, and Vishwanath
Agrawal v. Sarla Vishwanath Agrawal."
17. The Hon'ble Apex Court, taking note of Rajnesh v. Neha (supra) and Kiran Jyot Maini (supra), in
para 32 of Pravin Kumar Jain (supra) laid down the following eight factors to be looked into in
deciding the quantum:
"i. Status of the parties, social and financial.
ii. Reasonable needs of the wife and the dependent children.
iii. Parties' individual qualifications and employment statuses.
iv. Independent income or assets owned by the applicant.
v. Standard of life enjoyed by the wife in the matrimonial home.
vi. Any employment sacrifices made for the family responsibilities. Patna High Court
MA No.996 of 2018 dt.14-10-2025 vii. Reasonable litigation costs for a non-working
wife.
viii. Financial capacity of the husband, his income, maintenance obligations, and
liabilities.
These are only guidelines and not a straitjacket rubric. These among such other
similar factors become relevant."
18. It is pertinent to mention here that duration of the marriage i.e., how long the marriage existed is
also a relevant factor in determining the quantum of permanent alimony. Generally, marriages that
lasts more than 10 years are entitled to be granted a lifetime alimony. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in
Rajnesh v. Neha (supra) in para 74 observed that:-
"74. In contemporary society, where several marriages do not last for a reasonable
length of time, it may be inequitable to direct the contesting spouse to pay permanent
alimony to the applicant for the rest of her life. The duration of the marriage would
be a relevant factor to be taken into consideration for determining the permanent
alimony to be paid."

Alok Kumar vs Smt. Anupama Singh on 14 October, 2025
Patna High Court MA No.996 of 2018 dt.14-10-2025 (emphasis supplied)
19. The conduct of the party seeking the relief is also relevant. The three-judges Bench of Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Sukhdev Singh v. Sukhbir Kaur reported in 2025 SCC OnLine SC 299,
observed in para 26 as under:
"26. .....We must note that sub- section 1 of Section 25 uses the word "may". A grant
of a decree under Section 25 of the 1955 Act is discretionary. If the conduct of the
spouse who applies for maintenance is such that the said spouse is not entitled to
discretionary relief, the Court can always turn down the prayer for the grant of
permanent alimony under Section 25 of the 1955 Act. Equitable considerations do
apply when the Court considers the prayer for maintenance under Section 25. The
reason is that Section 25 lays down that while considering the prayer for granting
relief under Section 25, the conduct of the parties must be considered."
(emphasis supplied) Patna High Court MA No.996 of 2018 dt.14-10-2025
20. Section 25 of the 1955 Act itself envisages that the wife can initiate proceedings for grant of
permanent alimony even after the decree of divorce. Therefore, the court does not become functus
officio with the passing of the decree and continues to have jurisdiction to award alimony even
thereafter.
21. Keeping in view the totality of circumstances and to do justice to the parties, we are of the
considered view that while keeping it open to the appellant-wife to institute her claim for grant of
permanent alimony before the court of competent jurisdiction, we deem it appropriate to grant
some amount towards Interim permanent alimony subject to any final decision to be taken by the
concerned court on an application to be filed under section 25 of the 1955 Act by the appellant-wife.
22. Be it stated, while granting permanent alimony, no arithmetic formula can be adopted as there
cannot be mathematical exactitude. It shall depend upon the status of the parties, their respective
social needs, the financial capacity of the husband and other obligations. In "Vinny Parmvir Parmar
v. Parmvir Parmar", (2011) 13 Patna High Court MA No.996 of 2018 dt.14-10-2025 SCC 112: (2011)
3 RCR (Civil) 900: 2011 (4) Recent Apex Judgments (R.A.J.) 357, while dealing with the concept of
permanent alimony, this Court has observed that while granting permanent alimony, the Court is
required to take note of the fact that the amount of maintenance fixed for the wife should be such as
she can live in reasonable comfort considering her status and the mode of life she was used to be
when she lived with her husband. At the same time, the amount so fixed cannot be excessive or
affect the living condition of the other party.
23. Be that as it may, it is the duty of the Court to see that the wife lives with dignity and comfort
and not in penury. The living need not be luxurious but simultaneously she should not be left to live
in discomfort. The Court has to act with pragmatic sensibility to such an issue so that the wife does
not meet any kind of man-made misfortune.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/90640992/ 7
Alok Kumar vs Smt. Anupama Singh on 14 October, 2025
24. This Court finds that appellant-husband is working as Master in Merchant Navy and getting Rs.
5,00,000/- to 6,00,000/- per month, a details of which has been mentioned in the supplementary
affidavit filed on Patna High Court MA No.996 of 2018 dt.14-10-2025 behalf of the
appellant-husband. Apart from the salary, the appellant has also possesses ancestral properties. The
appellant-wife has still not re-married with anyone. The appellant has no issue. She is solely
dependent on her old aged parents. The appellant has no other source of income and she is getting a
maintenance amount of Rs.10,000/- per month as awarded by the Family Court.
25. This Court, while hearing the present petition has observed in para 1, 2, and 3 of the order dated
12.12.2024 which reads as under :-
"Respective parties are living separately for more than one decade. The respondent had filed
petition under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and thereafter it was dismissed in the year
2015 during the pendency of the Matrimonial (Divorce) Case No. 211 of 2013..
2. The respondent has not taken further steps so as to show her bona fide in joining her husband. In
the absence of such interest shown by her, it is necessary to apprise the respective parties for
settlement. In this regard both the appellant and respondent are hereby directed to file Patna High
Court MA No.996 of 2018 dt.14-10-2025 their assets and liabilities in the form of affidavit in the
light of the Hon'ble Supreme Court decision in the case of Rajnesh vs. Neha reported in (2021) 2
SCC 324 read with Aditi alias Mithi vs. Jitesh Sharma reported in (2023) SCC Online SC 1451 before
the next date of hearing. They are hereby directed to exchange such affidavit in advance.
3. The appellant counsel is hereby directed to take note of latest Hon'ble Supreme Court decision in
the case of Pravin Kumar Jain vs. Anju Jain reported in 2024 SCC OnLine SC 3678 (Paragraph No.
32) where the Hon'ble Supreme Court has formulated certain factors for the purpose of considering
the permanent alimony. On this issue, he is hereby directed to give tentative proposal for permanent
alimony with a particular amount so as to examine on the next date of hearing."
26. We have also observed in para 2 of the order dated 18.01.2025 which reads as under:-
" 2. Be that as it may, Appellant has offered an amount of Rs. 50 lakhs as a Patna
High Court MA No.996 of 2018 dt.14-10-2025 permanent alimony and one time
settlement. In this regard, Respondent-Smt. Anupama Singh is requested to furnish
her counter proposal. If there is any settlement with reference to proposal and
counter proposal of one time permanent alimony, in that event, we need not examine
correctness and details of the assets and liabilities filed on behalf of the Appellant.
27. While hearing the present appeal on 11.04.2025 we have observed thus:-
"Pursuant to our earlier recording the fact that Appellant has offered a sum of Rs. 50 lakhs. Today,
learned counsel for the respondent, on instruction, submitted that Respondent is furnishing counter
offer of Rs. 90 Lakhs plus one residential accommodation.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/90640992/ 8
Alok Kumar vs Smt. Anupama Singh on 14 October, 2025
Therefore, matter is required to be adjudicated on merits with reference to assets and liabilities read
with the fact that how long both were living in a matrimonial home."
28. Accordingly, after going through the entire facts of this case, we deem it appropriate to grant an
Patna High Court MA No.996 of 2018 dt.14-10-2025 amount of Rs. 90,00,000/- (Rupees Ninety
Lakhs Only) towards Permanent Alimony to be paid by appellant- husband to the respondent-wife.
Let the said amount be paid by appellant-husband to the respondent-wife within a period of six
months from today; failing which the said amount shall carry simple interest @ 6% per annum.
29. Accordingly M.A. No. 996 of 2018 stands disposed of with the aforesaid direction. No order as to
costs.
30. Pending I.A(s), if any, stand disposed of.
