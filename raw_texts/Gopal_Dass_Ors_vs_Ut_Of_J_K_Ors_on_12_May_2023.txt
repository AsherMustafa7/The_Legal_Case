ORDER
1. Petitioners through the medium of this petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C, seek quashment of FIR
No. 110/2023 registered with Police Station, Akhnoor for commission of offences punishable under
Section 306 IPC against them, asserting therein that the respondent No. 2 had registered the
aforesaid FIR at the instance of respondent No. 3, namely, Pritam Lal, who was inimical to the
petitioners due to the cases pending between them in view of the caste bitterness.
2. It has been pleaded that one-Sawroop Sharma, son of respondent No. 3 was continuously teasing
the daughter of the petitioner Nos. 1 and 2 and sister of petitioner No. 3 and was asking her for
marriage and that he was also threatening the petitioners and their daughter of dire consequences,
however, the marriage between the said Sawroop Sharma and the daughter of the petitioner Nos. 1
and 2 could not mature, as neither of the families were interested for such a marriage, as the girl
belonged to Scheduled Caste family, whereas the boy was from the Brahaman family. The
petitioners' girl had also lodged an FIR against the said Sawroop Sharma for having threatened her
and her family and subjecting their house to stone pelting on 11.07.2022, with regard to which a case
was registered at Police Station, Akhnoor vide FIR No. 204/2022 for commission of offences
punishable under Sections 354, 354-D, 451, 427 and 504 IPC and the charge-sheet had also been
laid after investigation of the case against the said Sawroop Sharma before the Court below. On
12.07.2022, the daughter of the petitioner Nos. 1 and 2 again reported to the Incharge Police Post,
Jourian that the said Sawroop Sharma had created nuisance in her and her family's life, as he
follows her wherever she goes and asks her to make mobile calls to him and on denial, he forcibly
enters into her house and starts abusing all the family members and so much so, he also
manhandled her parents.
3. It has been also brought to the notice of the Court that even a community panchayat was
organized by the Sarpanch-Babu Ram, wherein it was decided that both the families shall desist
from committing any mistake further.

4. In the month of January, 2023, the said Sawroop Sharma committed suicide and the inquest
proceedings were initiated to ascertain the cause of his death. After conducting the inquiry, the
police registered the impugned FIR on 09.04.2023, of which the petitioners are aggrieved. In the
month of February, 2023, another FIR was registered at Police Station, Akhnoor for commission of
offences punishable under Sections 323, 504, 506, 341 and 147 IPC, as the house of the petitioners
was attacked and subjected to stone pelting by the family of the deceased-Sawroop Sharma, holding
them responsible for suicide of their son regarding which charge-sheet had also been laid before the
Court against many persons of the family of the respondent No. 3.
5. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the petitioners are so frightened of the attacks
from the family of respondent No. 3 that they have left their home and have taken shelter in the
house of the brother of the petitioner No. 1. It appears that both the parties due to caste conflict have
registered FIRs being inimical and hostile to each other.
6. Heard.
7. Issue notice to the respondents, returnable within three weeks. Requisite be furnished within one
week.
8. List again on 15.06.2023.
9. Meanwhile, subject to objections from the other side and till next date of hearing before the
Bench, investigation of the case is ordered to be stayed.
