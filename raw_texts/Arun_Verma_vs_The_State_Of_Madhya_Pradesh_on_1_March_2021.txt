Arun Verma vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 1 March, 2021
19.11.2020 (Ashwin Siroliya and Arun Verma), 21.11.2020 (Karandeep Singh and Anmol Sandhu)
and 23.11.2020 (Lucky).
W.P.No.1820, 1815, 2677, 3000 & 3001 of 2021 Regard being had to the similitude in the
controversy involved in the present cases, writ petitions were analogously heard and by a common
order, they are being disposed of by this Court. Facts of the Writ Petition No.1820/2021 are
narrated hereunder.
FACTS:
2. For the alleged incident dated 16.11.2020 a named FIR was lodged on the same
date against all five petitioners alongwith others and registered an offence at crime
No.416/2020 at Police Station, Chattripura, Indore for the offence punishable under
sections 147, 148, 149, 452, 307, 323, 294, 506 and 427 IPC.
On 20.11.2020, the Superintendent of Police, West, Indore prepared a note/report based on the
alleged incident and forwarded to the Collector, Indore recommending issuance of detention order
against all five persons. In exercise of powers under Section 3(2) read with section 3(3) of the
National Security Act, 1980 (for short 'the Act'), separate detention orders for three months were
issued on 21.11.2020 and confirmed by the State Government on 28.12.2020. Facts in that behalf
were also reported to the Central Government. Thereafter, the grounds of detention alongwith
record were forwarded to the Advisory Board for reference under Section 10 of the Act and the
Advisory Board has given its opinion under Section 11 of the Act on 18.12.2020, as under:
OPINION "We are of the opinion that there exists sufficient cause for detention of
Karandeep Rana S/o Harvindarsingh R/o Distt. Indore, under the National Security
Act, 1980. We, however, make it clear that W.P.No.1820, 1815, 2677, 3000 & 3001 of
2021 having regard to the decision of the Supreme Court in Cherukuri Mani w/o
Narendra Chowdari Vs. Chief Secretary, Government of Andhra Pradesh and others
(2015) 13 Supreme Court Cases 722, the State Government may extend the period of
detention upto the maximum 12 months from the date of detention, but, only after
reviewing the detention before every 3 months as required under the provisions of
the National Security Act, 1980. Let our opinion and records be sent to the State
Government."
(Emphasis supplied) Thereafter, the State Government has passed an order of detention under
Section 12 of the Act on 30.12.2020.
During the course of arguments, on 25.02.2021, it transpired that three months period of detention
order has expired on 22.02.2021. However, the State Government has further extended validity of
detention orders for three months. To place on record aforesaid facts by way of supplementary
affidavit, a day's time was granted. Due to administrative reasons, the same could not be placed on
record as ordered. However, in terms of the order passed by this Court on 27.02.2021, the order
dated 22.01.2021 passed by Collector, Indore extending the detention order for three months
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45674660/ 2
Arun Verma vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 1 March, 2021
expiring on 21.05.2021 based on the report of Superintendent of Police dated 19.01.2021, West,
Indore is placed on record.
Besides, the order of Collector, Indore has been approved by the State Government as contemplated
under Section 3(5) of the Act vide order dated 04/02/2021.
The details of orders passed against each of the petitioners are mentioned below:

3. Shri Chhabra & Makbool Mansoor, learned counsels have canvassed following
propositions:-
(i) respondent/State has not forwarded the detention order and other record to the
Central Government as required under Section 3(5) of the Act. As such, there is a
procedural lapse in the matter of passing of the impugned detention order.
(ii) the orders of detention and extension were not communicated to relatives of
petitioners
(iii) there is no sufficient material on record justifying passing of the impugned
detention order by the Collector, Indore dated 21.11.2020 and approved by the State
Government on 30.12.2020.
(iv) the obtaining facts and circumstances suggest that the alleged incident was in the area of 'law
and order' and not of 'public order'.
Learned counsels for the petitioners also submit that the original detention order for three months
expired on 22/02/2021. Vide the extension order dated 22/01/2021, the period of detention was
further extended for three months expiring on 22/05/2021. The factum of passing of extension
order is placed on record under W.P.No.1820, 1815, 2677, 3000 & 3001 of 2021 orders of this Court
on 25/02/2021 and 27/02/2021. Petitioners' liberty is curtailed and civil rights denied by force of
extended detention order without communication. Hence, the grounds of challenge made to the
original detention orders dated 19/11/2020, 21/11/2020, 23/11/2020 are also advanced against the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45674660/ 3
Arun Verma vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 1 March, 2021
extended detention orders of the petitioners.
Referring to the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Cherukuri Mani w/o Narendra
Chowdari Vs. Chief Secretary, Government of Andhra Pradesh and others (2015) 13 SCC 722,
learned counsels submit that under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, in a Habeas Corpus
petition, this Court may not insist strict rule of pleadings and relief sought and may examine the
sustainability of extension of detention order on the material available on record.
No other point was pressed.
4. Per contra, Shri Bhargava, learned Additional Advocate General submits that in compliance of
Section 3(5) of the Act, order of approval passed by State Government was also forwarded to Central
Government as well explicit from the document itself (Annexure R/7). Therefore, it is incorrect to
say that Section 3(5) of the Act was not complied with.
(ii) the order of detention dated 21.11.2020 was supplied to the relative of the petitioner as is well
evident from Annexure R/2 and also to the detenu in jail vide Annexure R/5 wherein not only order
of the detention but, also grounds of detention were supplied W.P.No.1820, 1815, 2677, 3000 &
3001 of 2021 to the petitioner. Likewise, the order of extension of detention order has also been
supplied through Superintended of Jail to the petitioner informing him of further extension of
detention order.
As such there is complete compliance of the provision of Sections 3(5) and 8 of the Act.
Learned Additional Advocate General further submits that a careful perusal of the grounds of
detention leaves no iota of doubt that the incidence occurred on 16/11/2020, the acts and conduct
attributed to the petitioners and others provided sufficient material affording justification for the
satisfaction of the detaining authority to pass detention orders against the petitioners preventing
them from indulging in such prejudicial activities to the public order.
The gravity and potentiality of the aforesaid incidence assumes significance that it was a well
planned conspiracy against Fiyaz Ahmed executed on the date of Deepawali festival, i.e., on
16/11/2020 while Fiaz Ahmed with some people had visited the house of Gopi Krishna Nema,
Ex-BJP Indore City President for wishing Deepawali greetings. The petitioners and his associates
armed with deadly weapons have caused heavy damage to the house of Gopi Krishna Nema. But, for
the efforts of Neema closing the door from behind to provide shield of safety to Fiyaz Ahmed, Aslam
Khan and his fellow men, they would have been brutally assaulted by the attacking party
endangering their lives.
The detaining authority on such material placed before him has rightly recorded his satisfaction that
the impact of such W.P.No.1820, 1815, 2677, 3000 & 3001 of 2021 planned attack at the house of
Gopi Krishna Nema, ex-BJP President, Indore was ill-intended to cause physical assaults on Fiaz
Ahmed and his people with deadly weapons to settled scores of business rivalry which could have
given raise to communal tension and disturb the safety, peace and tranquility in the area. Therefore,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45674660/ 4
Arun Verma vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 1 March, 2021
the alleged act was prejudicial to the maintenance of public order. Learned counsel relied upon the
judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of State of U.P., and another Vs. Sanjai Pratap
Gupta alias Pappu and others [(2004) 8 SCC 591 (paragraphs 7 & 8)] to bolster his submissions.
Combating the submission that the alleged incidence on 16/11/2020 for which FIR was registered
was in the area of "law and order" and not "public order" warranting invocation of authority under
sections 3(2) & (3) of the Act; issuance of detention orders, learned Additional Advocate General
submits that the aforesaid submission of learned counsels for the petitioners runs contrary to law
settled down by the Hon'ble Apex Court and various High Courts where a distinction has been
drawn between the "law and order" and "public order".
The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of State of U.P.,and others Vs. Sanjai Pratap Gupta alias
Pappu and others (2004) 8 SCC 591 relying upon the judgments in the cases of Arun Ghosh Vs.
State of West Bengal, (1970) 1 SCC 98 and Babul Mitra Vs. State of West Bengal, (1974) 4 SCC 504,
has held that the true distinction between the areas of "public order" and "law and order" lies not in
the nature or quality of the act, but in the W.P.No.1820, 1815, 2677, 3000 & 3001 of 2021 degree
and extent of its reach upon society. Therefore, it is not the nature and quality of the act but upon its
potentiality and degree which affects even tempo of life of the people in the society.
The case in hand squarely falls in well defined contours of concept of "public order" as laid down by
the Hon'ble Apex Court. Hence,the issuance of order of detention is bona fide and not open for
judicial review.
While justifying the extension order of detention vide order dated 22/01/2021, learned counsel
submits that the proviso to sub- section (3) of section 3 of the Act, empowers the State Government
to amend and extend the period of detention from time to time but not exceeding three months at
any one time. He further submits that the detaining authority has recorded its satisfaction on the
report submitted by the Superintendent of Police, West, Indore dated 19/01/2021. Therefore, the
satisfaction recorded is bona fide and based on relevant material. The State Government has also
recorded its satisfaction and affirmed the extension of the order of detention for three months
expiring on 22/02/2021 vide order dated 04.02.2021. The opinion /report of the Advisory Board
rendered while approving the original detention order had observed that the detention order can be
further reviewed and extended for twelve months but, three months at a time.
Besides, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Cherukuri Mani w/o Narendra Chowdari (supra)
has held that W.P.No.1820, 1815, 2677, 3000 & 3001 of 2021 the State Government may extend the
period of detention after review of detention order after every three months of the detention order.
Hence, no illegality can be attached to the extension of detention order warranting interference by
this Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
5. Heard.
6. Before adverting to the rival submissions on merits of the order of detention, it is appropriate to
reproduce the grounds of detention contained in the communication of the Superintendent of

7. The contention advanced in the context of compliances under section 3(5) of the Act in the matter
of forwarding of W.P.No.1820, 1815, 2677, 3000 & 3001 of 2021 detention order with record to the
Central Government and non- supply of the order of detention with grounds of detention referable
to section 8 of the Act are held to be in despair and devoid of substance in the light of the documents
placed on record vide Annexure R/7 whereby the order of detention with record was sent to the
Central Government and the order of detention was served on the relatives of the detenu as evident
from Annexure R/2 and also detenu in jail (Annexure R/5) alongwith grounds of detention. Hence,
the challenge to the detention orders on the aforesaid grounds is hereby rejected.
8. Before addressing the rival contentions on the grounds of detention as detailed in the report of
the Superintendent of Police dated 20/11/2020 (Annexure R/8), it is expedient to reiterate the well
settled distinction between the "law and order" and "public order".
The Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Ram Manohar Lohia (Dr.) v. State of
Bihar, AIR 1966 SC 740, wherein Justice Hidayatullah (As His Lordship then was) by stating various
illustrative instances and illustrations defined the 'public order' and 'law and order' as under:-
"51....Does the expression "public order" take in every kind of disorder or only some?
The answer to this serves to distinguish "public order" from "law and order" because
the latter undoubtedly takes in all of them. Public order if disturbed, must lead to
public disorder. Every breach of the peace does not lead to public disorder. When two
drunkards quarrel and fight there is disorder but not public disorder. They can be
W.P.No.1820, 1815, 2677, 3000 & 3001 of 2021 dealt with under the powers to
maintain law and order but cannot be detained on the ground that they were
disturbing public order. Suppose that the two fighters were of rival communities and
one of them tried to raise communal passions. The problem is still one of law and
order but it raises the apprehension of public disorder. Other examples can be
imagined. The contravention of law always affects order but before it can be said to
affect public order, it must affect the community or the public at large. A mere
disturbance of law and order leading to disorder is thus not necessarily sufficient for
action under the Defence of India Act but disturbances which subvert the public
order are. A District Magistrate is entitled to take action under Rule 30(l)(b) to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45674660/ 7
Arun Verma vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 1 March, 2021
prevent subversion of public order but not in aid of maintenance of law and order
under ordinary circumstances.
52. It will thus appear that just as "public order" in the rulings of this Court (earlier
cited) was said to comprehend disorders of less gravity than those affecting "security
of State", "law and order" also comprehends disorders of less gravity than those
affecting "public order". One has to imagine three concentric circles. Law and order
represents the largest circle within which is the next circle representing public order
and the smallest circle represents security of State. It is then easy to see that an act
may affect law and order but not public order just as an act may affect public order
but not security of the State...."
In Commissioner of Police v. C. Anita, (2004) 7 SCC 467 the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as
under:-
"28. In Commissioner of Police & Others v. C. Anita (Smt.) (2004) 7 SCC 467, this
court again examined W.P.No.1820, 1815, 2677, 3000 & 3001 of 2021 the issue of
"public order" and "law and order" and observed thus:
"7. ....The crucial issue is whether the activities of the detenu were prejudicial to
public order. While the expression "law and order" is wider in scope inasmuch as
contravention of law always affects order, "public order" has a narrower ambit, and
public order could be affected by only such contravention which affects the
community or the public at large. Public order is the even tempo of life of the
community taking the country as a whole or even a specified locality. The distinction
between the areas of "law and order" and "public order" is one of the degree and
extent of the reach of the act in question on society. It is the potentiality of the act to
disturb the even tempo of life of the community which makes it prejudicial to the
maintenance of the public order. If a contravention in its effect is confined only to a
few individuals directly involved as distinct from a wide spectrum of the public, it
could raise problem of law and order only. It is the length, magnitude and intensity of
the terror wave unleashed by a particular eruption of disorder that helps to
distinguish it as an act affecting "public order" from that concerning "law and order".
The question to ask is:
"Does it lead to disturbance of the current life of the community so as to amount to a
disturbance of the public order or does it affect merely an individual leaving the
tranquillity of the society undisturbed?"
This question has to be faced in every case on its facts." The aforesaid principle is again reiterated by
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of State of U.P., and another Vs. Sanjai Pratap Gupta alias
Pappu and others, (2004) 8 SCC 591 (paragraph 7).

Arun Verma vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 1 March, 2021
The aforesaid judgments amongst others succinctly have drawn distinction between "law and order"
and "public order".
This Court finds substantial force in the submission of learned Additional Advocate General that the
distinction between the areas of "law and order" and the "public order" are one of W.P.No.1820,
1815, 2677, 3000 & 3001 of 2021 degree and extent to the reach of the act in question upon society.
9. Upon careful perusal of the report of the Superintendent of Police West, Indore and the grounds
of detention dated 20/11/2020 (Annexure R/8) quoted above, it is 'as clear as Noon in the day' that
on 16/11/2020, the petitioners prima facie conspired and with common intention alongwith other
persons attacked Fiaz Ahmed and other people with him while he had gone to the house of Gopi
Krishna Nema, Ex-BJP Indore City President for wishing Deepawali greetings. The petitioners were
armed with deadly weapons. The petitioners and others indiscriminately and ransomly attacked the
house of Gopi Krishna Nema and caused heavy damage to his house. They allegedly made all out
efforts to brutally assault Fiaz Ahmed, Aslam Khan and his associates, as well detailed in the report.
The date and timing of attacked irresistibly had the potential to cause communal disharmony in the
area causing disturbance and imperil safety, peace and tranquility / even tempo of people of two
communities in the area. In our considered opinion, the satisfaction recorded by the detaining
authority on the basis of grounds of detention is bona fide and within well defined contours of the
concept of "public order". Hence, no interference under Article 226 of the Constitution of India is
warranted.
10. However, the question arises; whether the detaining authority was justified extending the
detention order by three months expiring on 22/05/2021?
11. For ready reference the report of the Superintended of W.P.No.1820, 1815, 2677, 3000 & 3001 of
2021 Police, West, Indore dated 19.01.2021 and based on which order passed by the Collector
extending the period of detention vide order dated 21.01.2021 are quoted below:-

Proviso to sub-section (3) of section 3 of the Act, though empowers the detaining
authority to amend the original detention order and extend for three months at any
one time but it casts an obligation of recording of satisfaction preceding extension of
detention order.
Recording of satisfaction is not a mere formality or a ministerial act. Instead, the
satisfaction must be based on such relevant material justifying further extension of
detention order.
Solemnity attached to the extension of detention order is same as the issuance of
detention order itself. In either case; a person is W.P.No.1820, 1815, 2677, 3000 &
3001 of 2021 kept in jail curtailing his personal liberty without trial frowning upon
the fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. Therefore,
prevalence of relevant material in the matter of formation of opinion or for recording
of satisfaction is an essential requirement for extension of the detention order as well.
Perusal of the aforesaid quoted reports suggest that the gist of same grounds have
been reiterated preceding the original detention orders dated 19/11/2020,
21/11/2020 and 23/11/2020 passed against petitioners and there is no new material
or such other material placed on record justifying recommendation for extension of
the detention orders. Mere perception of police personnel without factual foundation,
in our opinion, shall not provide sufficient relevant material for extension of
detention orders under the garb of threat to the safety and tranquility of the people in
society or even tempo of the people of the community.
As such, we hold that the extension of the detention orders are not in confirmity with
the requirement of sub-section (3) of section 3 of the Act.
Upshot of the aforesaid discussion leads to partial success of the writ petitions.
The original detention orders passed by the Collector, Indore as approved by the
State Government (supra) in respect of the petitioners are held to be fully justified.
However, the extension of detention orders passed by the Collector, Indore and
approved by the State Government dated 04/02/2021 as mentioned in the table
referred above are hereby quashed.
W.P.No.1820, 1815, 2677, 3000 & 3001 of 2021 The petitioners are reported to be in
jail. They are set at liberty, unless; they are required to be detained in any other case,
in jail.
