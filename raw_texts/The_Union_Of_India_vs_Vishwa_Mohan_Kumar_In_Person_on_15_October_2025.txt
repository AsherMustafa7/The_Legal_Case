2. The present writ petition has been filed for
challenging the order dated 04.01.2024 passed in OA No.
Patna High Court CWJC No.12586 of 2024 dt. 15-10-2025
2/14
050/00505 of 2019 by which the learned Central Administrative
Tribunal has been directed to the respondent's promotion to the
post of Executive Engineer should be regularized w.e.f. 30.11.2010
the date on which he was given the current duty charge of that post
as he held that post continuously till regular promotion. Apart from
the aforesaid, the learned Central Administrative Tribunal also
directed the petitioners to issue order of promotion to the post of
Executive Engineer w.e.f. 30.11.2010 with all consequential
benefits within three months from the date of this order.
3. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the
respondent herein was appointed as Assistant Engineer in the Civil
Construction Wing of All India Radio on 19.12.1990 and was
granted financial up-gradation to Grade Pay of Rs. 6600/- w.e.f.
18.12.2002
vide order dated 27.04.2005. Respondent was given current duty charge of the post of Executive
Engineer w.e.f. 30.11.2010. The grade pay for the post of Executive Engineer was Rs. 6600/-, so
there was no financial enhancement in the pay scale for the current duty charge. The respondent
was conferred second MACP with Grade Pay of Rs. 7600/- vide order dated 18.12.2020.
4. The respondent was promoted after regular Departmental Proceeding Committee (DPC) to the
post of Executive Engineer vide order dated 25.02.2020. Patna High Court CWJC No.12586 of 2024
dt. 15-10-2025
5. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the respondent's case was before Central
Administrative Tribunal (hereinafter referred as "CAT") that respondent was eligible for promotion
to the post of Executive Engineer after completing eight (08) years regular service on the post of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/98673198/ 2
The Union Of India vs Vishwa Mohan Kumar (In Person) on 15 October, 2025
Assistant Engineer. For the promotion to the post of Superintending Engineer, the eligibility of five
(05) years on the post of Executive Engineer. The respondent pleaded before the learned CAT that
he was granted only one substantive promotion in the last 30 years of his service. Learned counsel
for the petitioners submits that from perusal of letter dated 30.11.2010 by which the respondent was
officiating to the post of Executive Engineer (Current Duty Charge). The said appointment letter
clearly indicates that such appointment will not entitle for any monetary benefit or claim to
seniority. The private respondent was ultimately promoted to the post of Executive Engineer by
order dated 25.02.2020 after the recommendation of DPC. The delay in process by the DPC for the
appointment of Executive Engineer was due to a SLP No. 35912- 35913 of 2010 was pending before
the Hon'ble Apex Court with respect to seniority matter and the Hon'ble Apex Court had granted an
interim order of status quo by order dated 17.01.2011. The said status quo was vacated by the
Hon'ble Apex Court by Patna High Court CWJC No.12586 of 2024 dt. 15-10-2025 order dated
19.08.2015. Thereafter, the matter was kept pending in the Hon'ble Apex Court and ultimately the
same was disposed of by order dated 18.01.2017. After disposal of the aforesaid SLP, the seniority
list was prepared by the authority concerned. Ultimately, the said seniority list was also subject to
challenge before the Hon'ble Apex Court in M.A. No. 2220-2221 of 2018 and the same was finally
disposed of vide order dated 17.02.2020 thereafter the respondent has been given to the promotion
vide order dated 25.02.2020. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that from the aforesaid, it
transpired that due to multiple litigation, the DPC could not take place for the period of last 10
years. Learned Additional Solicitor General of India brought to our notice Office Memorandum
dated 10th April, 1989 where the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions Department
of Personnel and Training had formulated a guidelines which would govern the
promotion/appointment of such persons to the post in question. He has relied upon Para 6.4.4 and
Para 17.10 and Para 17.11 which is reproduced hereinbelow :-
"6.4.4 - While promotions will be made in the order of the consolidated select list, such promotions
will have only prospective effect even in cases where the vacancies relate to earlier year(s).
Patna High Court CWJC No.12586 of 2024 dt. 15-10-2025 17.10- The general principle is that
promotion of officers included in the panel would be regular from the date of validity of the panel or
the date of their actual promotion whichever is later.
17.11- In cases where the recommendations for promotion are made by the DPC presided over by a
Member of the UPSC and such recommendations do not require to be approved by the Commission,
the date of Commission's letter forwarding fair copes of the minutes duly signed by the Chairman of
the DPC or the date of the actual promotion of the officers, whichever is later, should be reckoned as
the date of regular promotion of the officer. In cases where the Commission's approval is also
required the date of UPSC's letter communicating its approval or the date of actual promotion of the
officer whichever is later will be the relevant date. In all other cases the date on which promotion
will be effective will be the date on which the officer was actually promoted or the date of the
meeting of the DPC whichever is later. Where the meeting of the DPC extends over more than one
day the last date on which the DPC extends over more than one day the last date Patna High Court
CWJC No.12586 of 2024 dt. 15-10-2025 on which the DPC met shall be recorded as the date of
meeting of the DPC.

Appointment to posts falling within the purview of ACC can, however, be treated as regular only
from the date of approval of ACC or actual promotion whichever later except in particular cases
where the ACC approves appointments from some other date".
6. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that from perusal of the aforesaid guidelines, it is
made clear that no such appointment/promotion could have been made effect with a retrospective
date, only a prospective promotion/appointment would have been made. Learned counsel for the
petitioners further relied upon a judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Government of
West Bengal and Others Vs. Dr. Amal Satpathi and Others, reported in (2024) SCC OnLine SC 3512,
Paragraph Nos. 19 and 20 of the said judgment which is reproduced hereinbelow:
"19. It is a well settled principle that promotion becomes effective from the date it is
granted, rather than from the date a vacancy arises or the post is created. While the
Courts have recognized the right to be considered for promotion as not only a
statutory right but also a fundamental right, there is no fundamental right to the
promotion itself. In this regard, we may gainfully refer to Patna High Court CWJC
No.12586 of 2024 dt. 15-10-2025 a recent decision of this Court in the case of Bihar
State Electricity Board v. Dharamdeo Das, wherein it was observed as follows:
"18. It is no longer res integra that a promotion is effective from the date it is granted
and not from the date when a vacancy occurs on the subject post or when the post
itself is created. No doubt, a right to be considered for promotion has been treated by
courts not just as a statutory right but as a fundamental right, at the same time, there
is no fundamental right to promotion itself. In this context, we may profitably cite a
recent decision in Ajay Kumar Shukla v. Arvind Rai where, citing earlier precedents
in Director, Lift Irrigation Corporation Ltd. v. Pravat Kiran Mohanty and Ajit Singh v.
State of Punjab, a three-Judge Bench observed thus:
41. This Court, time and again, has laid emphasis on right to be considered for
promotion to be a fundamental right, as was held by K. Ramaswamy, J., in Director,
Lift Irrigation Corpn. Ltd. v. Pravat Kiran Mohanty in para 4 of the report which is
reproduced below:
'4....... There is no fundamental right to promotion, but an employee has only right to
be considered for promotion, when it arises, in accordance with relevant rules. From
this perspective in our view the conclusion of the High Court that the gradation list
prepared by the Patna High Court CWJC No.12586 of 2024 dt. 15-10-2025
corporation is in violation of the right of respondent-writ petitioner to equality
enshrined under Article 14 read with Article 16 of the Constitution, and the
respondent-writ petitioner was unjustly denied of the same is obviously unjustified.'
42. A Constitution Bench in Ajit Singh v. State of Punjab, laying emphasis on Article
14 and Article 16(1) of the Constitution of India held that if a person who satisfies the
eligibility and the criteria for promotion but still is not considered for promotion,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/98673198/ 4
The Union Of India vs Vishwa Mohan Kumar (In Person) on 15 October, 2025
then there will be clear violation of his/her's fundamental right. Jagannadha Rao, J.
speaking for himself and Anand, C.J., Venkataswami, Pattanaik, Kurdukar, JJ.,
observed the same as follows in paras 22 and 27:
'Articles 14 and 16(1) : is right to be considered for promotion a fundamental right
22. Article 14 and Article 16(1) are closely connected. They deal with individual rights
of the person. Article 14 demands that the 'State shall not deny to any person equality
before the law or the equal protection of the laws'. Article 16(1) issues a positive
command that:
'there shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to
employment or appointment to any office under the State'. It has been held
repeatedly by this Court that clause (1) of Article 16 is a facet of Article 14 and that it
takes its roots from Article 14. The said Patna High Court CWJC No.12586 of 2024
dt. 15-10-2025 clause particularises the generality in Article 14 and identifies, in a
constitutional sense "equality of opportunity" in matters of employment and
appointment to any office under the State. The word "employment" being wider,
there is no dispute that it takes within its fold, the aspect of promotions to posts
above the stage of initial level of recruitment. Article 16 (1) provides to every
employee otherwise eligible for promotion or who comes within the zone of
consideration, a fundamental right to be "considered" for promotion. Equal
opportunity here means the right to be "considered" for promotion. If a person
satisfies the eligibility and zone criteria but is not considered for promotion, then
there will be a clear infraction of his fundamental right to be "considered" for
promotion, which is his personal right. "Promotion" based on equal opportunity and
seniority attached to such promotion are facets of fundamental right under Article
16(1).
* * *
27. In our opinion, the above view expressed in Ashok Kumar Gupta [Ashok Kumar
Gupta v. State of U.P., and followed in Jagdish Lal [Jagdish Lal v. State of Haryana,
and other cases, if it is intended to lay down that the right guaranteed to employees
for being "considered" for promotion according to relevant rules of recruitment by
promotion (i.e. whether on the basis of seniority or merit) is only a statutory right
and not a Patna High Court CWJC No.12586 of 2024 dt. 15-10-2025 fundamental
right, we cannot accept the proposition. We have already stated earlier that the right
to equal opportunity in the matter of promotion in the sense of a right to be
"considered" for promotion is indeed a fundamental right guaranteed under Article
16(1) and this has never been doubted in any other case before Ashok Kumar Gupta
[Ashok Kumar Gupta v. State of U.P.], right from 1950.' "20. In State of Bihar v.
Akhouri Sachindra Nath, it was held that retrospective seniority cannot be given to
an employee from a date when he was not even borne in the cadre, nor can seniority
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/98673198/ 5
The Union Of India vs Vishwa Mohan Kumar (In Person) on 15 October, 2025
be given with retrospective effect as that might adversely affect others. The same view
was reiterated in Keshav Chandra Joshi v. Union of India, where it was held that
when a quota is provided for, then the seniority of the employee would be reckoned
from the date when the vacancy arises in the quota and not from any anterior date of
promotion or subsequent date of confirmation. The said view was restated in
Uttaranchal Forest Rangers' Assn. (Direct Recruit) v. State of U.P., in the following
words:
'37. We are also of the view that no retrospective promotion or seniority can be
granted from a date when an employee has not even been borne in the cadre so as to
adversely affect the direct recruits appointed validly in the meantime, as decided by
this Court in Keshav Chandra Joshi v. Union of India held that when promotion is
outside the quota, seniority would be reckoned from the date Patna High Court
CWJC No.12586 of 2024 dt. 15-10-2025 of the vacancy within the quota rendering
the previous service fortuitous. The previous promotion would be regular only from
the date of the vacancy within the quota and seniority shall be counted from that date
and not from the date of his earlier promotion or subsequent confirmation. In order
to do justice to the promotes, it would not be proper to do injustice to the direct
recruits......
38. This Court has consistently held that no retrospective promotion can be granted
nor can any seniority be given on retrospective basis from a date when an employee
has not even been borne in the cadre particularly when this would adversely affect
the direct recruits who have been appointed validity in the meantime."
(emphasis supplied)
20. In the instant case, it is evident that while respondent No. 1 was recommended
for promotion before his retirement, he could not assume the duties of the Chief
Scientific Officer. Rule 54(1)(a) of the West Bengal Service Rules, clearly stipulates
that an employee must assume the responsibilities of a higher post to draw the
corresponding pay, thus, preventing posthumous or retrospective promotions in the
absence of an enabling provision".
7. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that it is not in dispute that the respondent was given
the officiating charge (Current Duty Charge) of Executive Engineer, the said Patna High Court
CWJC No.12586 of 2024 dt. 15-10-2025 appointment letter itself indicates that the respondent
could not have made claim for any monetary benefit or seniority on the basis of the said
appointment. The said appointment letter was issued in the year 2010 in favour of respondent and
the respondent was never challenged the aforesaid letter and now he has not claimed the promotion
on retrospective effect.
8. Mr. Vishwa Mohan Kumar, who has appeared in person submits that it is not in dispute that the
respondent was not eligible for the promotion to the post in question. The petitioners have denied
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/98673198/ 6
The Union Of India vs Vishwa Mohan Kumar (In Person) on 15 October, 2025
the promotion to the respondent solely on the ground that the status quo was maintained by the
Hon'ble Apex Court on the sole ground that the petitioners could not hold DPC. Mr. Vishwa Mohan
Kumar further submits that after the status quo order dated 17.01.2011 the petitioners conducted
DPC and issued Promotion Order No. 7/2011-BA (E) dated 24.10.2011 and issued posting order to
certain officials. Further submits that the status quo was modified by the Hon'ble Apex Court vide
order dated 19.08.2015 where the Hon'ble Apex Court held that "We modify the interim order and
permit the Union of India to make the promotions to the post of Executive Engineer. However, we
make it clear that the promotions will be subject to the outcome of this appeal". Apart from the
aforesaid, the petitioners could have Patna High Court CWJC No.12586 of 2024 dt. 15-10-2025
conducted the DPC immediately after the modification of status quo order by the Hon'ble Apex
Court on 19.08.2015. The indefinite 10 years long period of Current Duty Charge ratified in the
regular promotion on 25.02.2020. Further submits that respondent was neither a party in the said
SLP nor his eligibility or his position in Direct Recruit slot was to get affected. The appointment was
made on Current Duty Charge according to Rule of FR 49, Current Duty Charge is a stop gap
arrangement for a very short duration only. Mr. Vishwa Mohan Mumar also relied upon a decision
in the case of K Madhavan and Another Vs. Union of India, reported in (1987) 4 SCC 566 held that
with a view to ensure that miscarriage of justice does not occur, promotion should be deemed to
have taken effect retrospectively from the commencement of the so called ad hoc stop gap and
current duty charge, provided the incumbent concerned fulfilled the essential criteria for
consideration for promotion on the initial date.
9. We have heard both the parties at length and this Court has come to the conclusion that due to
statue quo granted by the Hon'ble Apect Court in SLP No. 35912-35913 of 2010 the petitioners had
not held the DPC for the promotion of the respondents in question and apart from the aforesaid in
the recent judgment as mentioned aforesaid by the petitioners in the case of Patna High Court
CWJC No.12586 of 2024 dt. 15-10-2025 Government of West Bengal and Others (supra) which
suggests that the promotion only becomes effective upon the assumption of duties on the
promotional post and not on the date of occurrence of the vacancy or the date of recommendation.
10. As a result of the above discussion, the judgment/order dated 04.01.2024 passed in O.A. No.
050/00505/2019 is hereby set aside.
11. The writ petition is allowed. No order as to costs.
12. Pending application (s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
(Sudhir Singh, J) I agree.
