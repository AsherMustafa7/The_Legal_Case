JUDGMENT & ORDER (CAV) Sanjay Kumar (C.J.):
[1] The State of Manipur; the Commissioner (Power), Government of Manipur; and
the Manipur State Power Distribution Company Limited (MSPDCL) are in appeal
against the judgment and order dated 19.03.2020 passed by a learned Judge of this
Court in W.P. (C) No. 167 of 2019. They also filed MC (W.A.) No. 59 of 2020 seeking
stay of operation of the said order, pending disposal of this appeal. By the order
under appeal, the learned Judge allowed the writ petition and directed the appellants
to pay compensation of (cid:128).10,00,000/- to the writ petitioners within 60 days, after
deducting the amount, if any, already paid to them. In the event the amount was not
paid within that time frame, interest was to accrue thereon @ 6% per annum and the
amount of (cid:128). 10,00,000/- along with interest was to be paid within 60 days from the
date of expiry of the earlier period of 60 days. The learned Judge also left it open to
the petitioners to seek more compensation by approaching the concerned Civil Court.

By interim order dated 11.12.2020, this Court granted stay of the order under appeal,
subject to deposit of a sum of (cid:128).5,00,000/- by the appellants with the Registry of this
Court. The appellants deposited the said amount under SBI Cheque dated
06.01.2021. Earlier, pursuant to the interim order dated 13.03.2019 passed in the
writ petition, a sum of (cid:128).50,000/- was paid by the appellants to the writ petitioners.

and Mr. Tungrei Ngakang, learned counsel, appearing for the respondents/writ petitioners.
W.A. No.47 of 2020 with MC (W.A.) No. 59 of 2020 Page 3
[3] On 17.12.2017, petitioner No. 1, a child aged about 5 years, was
playing in the verandah of the first floor of the building, where she and her family were staying on
rent, and she came in contact with a 11 KV electrical overhead line which passed adjacent to the
building. In consequence, she sustained serious injuries resulting in amputation of both her arms at
the shoulder level. Her disability was quantified as 90%.
[4] Entreaties for compensation by petitioner No. 2, her father, fell on deaf ears, leading to
institution of the writ petition. His claim therein was that artificial limbs for the child would cost
about (cid:128).7,00,000/- and that apart, the child's future was severely impacted by the loss of her limbs.
The prayer for compensation of (cid:128).1,62,97,800/- was founded on the violation of the child's
fundamental rights under Articles 14, 21 and 300 of the Constitution apart from an action in tort on
the principles of res ipsa loquitur, strict liability and restitutio in integrum. The assertion of the
child's father was that the authorities concerned failed to abide by the statutory norms in relation to
installation and maintenance of the overhead line, which resulted in his young daughter being
maimed for life. [5] The stand of the Commissioner (Power), Government of Manipur, who was the
only respondent who filed a reply in the writ petition, was that no negligence was attributable to the
MSPDCL. According to the Under Secretary (Power), Government of Manipur, who deposed on his
behalf, the child suffered electrocution owing to construction of a staircase very near to the overhead
line. She pointed out that the building in question was constructed in the year 2009 without a
staircase and the distance at that time from the 11KV line was about 1.9 metres, which was
permissible as the minimum horizontal clearance required under the rules was only 1.2 metres.
According to her, the staircase was W.A. No.47 of 2020 with MC (W.A.) No. 59 of 2020 Page 4
constructed in the year 2014 without obtaining necessary permission and without notice to the
electricity authorities and thereby, the distance from the 11 KV line to the staircase was reduced to
just about 1.5 feet. She placed reliance on Rule 82 of the Indian Electricity Rules, 1956 (for brevity,
'the Rules of 1956'), and asserted that no liability could be attached to the MSPDCL. According to
her, the authorities were abiding by all the measures prescribed under law and, therefore, they could
not be mulcted with liability to pay compensation to the petitioners. [6] Mr. S. Nepolean, learned
Government Advocate, would reiterate that the clear violation of Rule 82 of the Rules of 1956 would
divest the MSPDCL of any responsibility for the accident and, therefore, the learned Judge was not
justified and correct in directing payment of compensation to the writ petitioners. [7] Before
considering the issue on merits, it would be appropriate to take note of the statutory scheme relating
to the responsibility of the authorities under the electricity laws. Section 2(20) of the Electricity Act,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/183475660/ 3
The State Of Manipur vs Baby Khushi Kumari (Minor) on 3 November, 2022
2003 (for brevity, 'the Act of 2003') defines 'electric line' to mean any line which is used for carrying
electricity for any purpose. Section 2(48) of the Act of 2003 defines 'overhead line' to mean an
electric line which is placed above the ground and in the open air, but does not include live rails of a
traction system. Section 53 of the Act of 2003 makes provision for the Central Electrical Authority,
in consultation with the State Government, to specify suitable measures for protecting the public
from dangers arising from generation, transmission or distribution of electricity, or use of electricity
supplied, or installation, maintenance or use of any electric plant. Section 162 of the Act of 2003
empowers the appropriate Government to appoint qualified persons to be Electrical Inspectors who
would be required to exercise such powers and perform such functions as may be prescribed in
respect of such W.A. No.47 of 2020 with MC (W.A.) No. 59 of 2020 Page 5 class of works and
electric installations and subject to such restrictions as the appropriate Government may direct.
Section 185 of the Act of 2003 is titled 'Repeal and Saving' and provides that the Indian Electricity
Rules, 1956, made under Section 37 of the repealed Indian Electricity Act, 1910, shall continue to be
in force till Regulations are made under Section 53 of the Act of 2003. As no such Regulations have
been made till date, the Rules of 1956 still continue to operate. Rule 2(y) of the Rules of 1956 defines
'installation' to mean any composite electrical unit used for the purpose of generating, transforming,
transmitting, converting, distributing or utilizing energy. Rule 2(ai) of the Rule of 1956 defines
'overhead line' to mean any electric supply line which is placed above the ground and in the open air.
Significantly, an entire chapter in the Rule of 1956, viz, Chapter IV, is devoted to 'General Safety
Requirements'. Rule 29(1) in Chapter IV provides that all electric supply lines shall be of sufficient
insulation and shall be constructed, installed, protected, worked and maintained in such a manner
as to ensure safety of human beings, animals and property. Rule 46 in Chapter IV deals with
'periodical inspection and testing of installation' and Rule 46(1)(a) provides that where an
installation is already connected to the supply system, every such installation shall be periodically
inspected and tested at intervals not exceeding five years, either by the Electrical Inspector or any
officer appointed to assist the Inspector or by the suppliers as may be directed by the Government
concerned. Rule 46(1)(c) provides that the forms of inspection report contained in Annexure (IX A),
subject to the approval of the Inspector, may be used for the purposes of this sub-rule. Rule 46(2)(c)
states that in the event of failure of the owner of an installation to rectify the defects in the
installation pointed out by the Inspector W.A. No.47 of 2020 with MC (W.A.) No. 59 of 2020 Page 6
within time, such installation would be liable to be disconnected under the directions of the
Electrical Inspector as per due procedure. [8] Perusal of the photographs placed on record reflects
that the overhead line in question passes very close to the staircase of the building where the
incident occurred. The building is situated on a busy thoroughfare, as is evident from the
photographs. Had periodical inspections been undertaken as mandated by Rule 46 of the Rules of
1956, this incident could, perhaps, have been prevented. It may also be noted that in a congested city
with narrow lanes, such as Imphal, it is the responsibility of the MSPCL to see that proper insulation
is provided to overhead electrical lines which pass in close proximity to the living quarters of
citizens. In the case on hand, it is clear that the 11 KV line had no protective insulation, as required
under Rule 29(1) of the Rules of 1956. [9] Rule 79 of the Rule of 1956 prescribes the clearances to be
maintained between buildings and low/medium voltage lines. It reads to the effect that so far as low
and medium voltage lines and service lines are concerned, the minimum horizontal clearance from
any accessible point when the line passes adjacent to a building shall be 1.2 metres from the nearest
point. Presently, it is an admitted fact that the addition of the staircase to the building in question
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/183475660/ 4
The State Of Manipur vs Baby Khushi Kumari (Minor) on 3 November, 2022
took place only in the year 2014 and there is no evidence of compliance with Rule 82 of the Rules of
1956 by the owner of the building. There is, thus, clear violation by the owner of the building, in so
far as Rule 82 is concerned. However, such violation would not be sufficient, in itself, to exempt the
MSPDCL from responsibility, as maintenance of safety standards and periodic inspection of all
installations and overhead lines is a statutory duty cast upon it under Rules 29 W.A. No.47 of 2020
with MC (W.A.) No. 59 of 2020 Page 7 and 46 of the Rules of 1956. Failure of the MSPDCL to abide
by its mandatory duties would outweigh the violation by the building owner under Rule 82. The
statutory responsibility weighing upon the MSPDCL, as the distributor of electrical energy, is far
higher and sacrosanct than the narrow responsibility resting upon an individual building owner.
This is clear from the fact that Rule 140 of the Rules of 1956 levies only the meagre penalty of fine on
such errant building owner. Further, it is not open to the MSPDCL, which undertakes supply and
distribution of hazardous electrical energy to wash its hands off statutory measures put in place to
ensure public safety and claim that individual building owners, who violate the mandate of Rule 82,
would be at fault and, consequently, absolve it of all liability. Further, though the Under Secretary
(Power), Government of Manipur, attempted to project the weak financial condition of the MSPDCL
as a reason to absolve it of liability from paying compensation, the same needs mention only to be
rejected. As a State instrumentality, the MSPDCL cannot escape its liability for failure to abide by
statutory norms. More so, when such norms pertained to the measures to be taken for ensuring
public safety and the victim of such failure is a young child whose future lies in ruin as a result
thereof. [10] It may also be noted that, though Mr. S. Nepolean, learned Government Advocate,
would assert that there was no negligence on the part of the MSPDCL, the eloquent silence of the
MSPDCL, evidenced by its failure to file a separate affidavit-in-opposition, speaks for itself. No
material has been produced by it in proof of safety standards being maintained, in accordance with
Rule 29 of the Rules of 1956, and periodical inspections having been carried out, in terms of Rule 46
of the Rules of 1956, at any point of time. Had any such inspection been made by the authorities
concerned, it may have resulted in some safety measures W.A. No.47 of 2020 with MC (W.A.) No.
59 of 2020 Page 8 being put in place and saved this child from a lifetime of suffering. The negligence
of the MSPDCL is therefore demonstrable and it resulted in tragedy for this little girl. In this regard,
it may also be noted that a Division Bench of this Court had occasion to deal with increasing
incidents of electrocution of citizens in PIL No. 48 of 2017. By final order dated 11.07.2018 passed
therein, the Division Bench noted that a series of orders had been passed directing the authorities to
ensure proper maintenance of electricity service lines, transformers, etc., so as to protect the citizens
and the Managing Director, MSPDCL, was directed to take serious action in case of failure on the
part of his subordinates. Had proper action been taken pursuant to this order vis-à-vis the 11 KV line
in question, perhaps the mishap involving this unfortunate child could have been averted altogether.
[11] That apart, the petitioners maintain their claim for compensation not only by way of an action
in tort but also based on the violation of the fundamental rights of the child, which is clear and
manifest. As rightly noted by the learned Judge, redressal of such violations, in terms of being
compensated monetarily, is amenable to the writ jurisdiction of this Court under Article 226 of the
Constitution (See Rudul Sah Vs. State of Bihar and others [(1983) 4 SCC 141], Nilabati Behera (Smt)
alias Lalita Behera Vs. State of Orissa and others [(1993) 2 SCC 746], D.K. Basu Vs. State of West
Bengal [(1997) 1 SCC 416] and M.C. Mehta and another Vs. Union of India and others [(1987) 1 SCC
395].

The State Of Manipur vs Baby Khushi Kumari (Minor) on 3 November, 2022
[12] Even if it is to be taken that the petitioners are only maintaining a claim in tort, the negligence
on the part of the MSPDCL is writ large. When the authorities concerned, and more particularity the
MSPDCL, were dealing with W.A. No.47 of 2020 with MC (W.A.) No. 59 of 2020 Page 9 distribution
and transmission of a potentially dangerous and hazardous commodity, viz., electricity, it was
incumbent upon them to abide by all the prescribed statutory norms in the context of safety. The
MSPDCL never undertook any such measures as it seems to have failed to maintain safety standards
under Rule 29 of the Rules of 1956 and carry out periodical inspections, as mandated by Rule 46
thereof.
[13] Reliance placed by Mr. S. Nepolean, learned Government Advocate, on Chairman, Grid
Corporation of Orissa Ltd. and others Vs. Smt. Sukamani [(1999) 7 SCC 298] and SDO, Grid
Corporation of Orissa Ltd. Vs. Timudu Oram [(2005) 6 SCC 156] is of no avail as those were cases
where the Supreme Court held that exercise of jurisdiction under Article 226 was unsustainable on
the ground that negligence was not established on the part of the electricity authorities. However, as
the finding of this Court in the case on hand is to the contrary and the negligence of the MSPDCL is
spelt out in clear terms, the ratio laid down in these judgments has no application. [14] On the above
analysis, this Court holds that the learned Judge was correct and justified in exercising writ
jurisdiction and awarding compensation to the petitioners at least to the tune of (cid:128).10,00,000/- with
interest thereon. No grounds are made out for interference with the order under appeal. [15] The
writ appeal is devoid of merit and is accordingly dismissed.
In consequence, the interim order of stay is vacated and MC (W.A.) No. 59 of 2020 is dismissed.
W.A. No.47 of 2020 with MC (W.A.) No. 59 of 2020 Page 10 The balance of the compensation
amount of (cid:128).10,00,000/-, after deducting the amount already paid, shall be released to the
petitioners along with interest thereon, as directed by the learned Judge, within one month from
today. The Registry shall forthwith release the sum of (cid:128).5,00,000/- deposited with it, along with the
standard interest applicable to savings bank accounts in the State Bank of India for the entire period
of such deposit, to petitioner No.2 under proper acknowledgement.
Though deserving, we refrain from making any order as to costs.
