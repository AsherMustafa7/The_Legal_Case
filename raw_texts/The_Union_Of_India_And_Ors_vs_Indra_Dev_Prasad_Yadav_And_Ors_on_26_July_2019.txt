The Union Of India And Ors vs Indra Dev Prasad Yadav And Ors on 26 July, 2019
The appeal questions the correctness of the judgment dated 26th of February, 2018 contending that
the writ petition should not have been entertained when a challenge had been raised to a decision
taken by an authority on 3 rd of November, 2008 and which ought to have been assailed before the
Central Administrative Tribunal. Learned counsel has invited the attention of the Court to Section
19 of Administrative Tribunal Act, 1985, to advance his submissions and to contend that
entertaining of the writ petition was erroneous keeping in view the Constitution Bench judgment in
the case of L. Chandra Kumar Vs. Union of India & Ors. reported in A.I.R 1997 SC 1125.
The second ground of challenge raised is that even on merits the direction issued by the learned
Single Judge to consider the case of the respondent-petitioners to decide strictly on two grounds is
contrary to the earlier directions that are contained in the judgment dated 23rd of July, 2008 in the
case of Gyanendra Kumar Sharma Vs. Union of India and Ors. (C.W.J.C. No. 13920 of 2005) as well
as the connected writ petitions where the respondent-petitioners were also parties.
It is, therefore, submitted that the reasoned and Patna High Court L.P.A No.413 of 2018
dt.26-07-2019 speaking order dated 23rd of July, 2008 did require a re- consideration and
consequently, the impugned judgment of the learned Single Judge is vitiated.
Learned counsel for the respondents on the other hand submits that this issue has now been
considered in the case of Union of India & Ors. Vs. Gyanendra Kumar Sharma @G.K. Sharma
(L.P.A. No. 410 of 2018) which appeal was dismissed on 18th of December, 2018 upholding the
order of the learned Single Judge. It is, therefore, submitted that there is no reason to take a
different view in the matter even if the answering respondents have not approached the Central
Administrative Tribunal for a decision in the matter.
We have considered the submissions raised and the first issue with regard to the maintainability of
the writ petition requires a consideration in the wake of the fact that the writ petition was filed in the
year 2009 and was disposed off in the year 2018 which is after nine years.
The contention of Shri Bindhyachal Singh to the effect that the matter should have been brought
before the Central Administrative Tribunal at the first instance may be correct, but at the same time,
in view of the long pendency of the writ petition before this Court, we find it necessary to Patna High
Court L.P.A No.413 of 2018 dt.26-07-2019 indicate that on account of this long pendency and the
exchange of affidavits and further in the wake of the Division Bench judgment in the case of Union
of India & Ors. Vs. Gyanendra Kumar Sharma@ G.K. Sharma (supra), it would not be appropriate or
expedient in the interest of justice to now relegate the respondent-petitioners to the Central
Administrative Tribunal for a decision when a Division Bench of this Court has already taken a view
in the matter on merits after contest between the Railways and similarly situate employees.
It may further be pointed out that this issue had been advanced in the case of Union of India & Ors.
Vs. Gyanendra Kumar Sharma@ G.K. Sharma (supra) and the same has been dealt with by the
Division Bench in paragraph No. 5 of the said decision which is also another reason for not
accepting the contention on behalf of the petitioner.

The Union Of India And Ors vs Indra Dev Prasad Yadav And Ors on 26 July, 2019
Shri Bindhyachal Singh then urged that there would be a contradiction in terms inasmuch as the
earlier direction of the same learned Single Judge on 23 rd of July, 2008 was to exclude the two
grounds of under age and under qualification, and then to proceed to decide the matter whereas in
the second round of litigation, the direction issued is to proceed to consider in a confined way which
according to the Patna High Court L.P.A No.413 of 2018 dt.26-07-2019 learned counsel is contrary
to the earlier judgment.
As noted above, the judgment of the learned Single Judge in a similar matter has been upheld by a
Division Bench in the case of Union of India & Ors. Vs. Gyanendra Kumar Sharma@ G.K. Sharma
(supra) vide judgment dated 18th of December, 2018 after a consideration of entire facts on record
which are almost similar as in the present case. The fact remains that the impugned judgment is
almost similar in nature that was challenged in the case of Union of India & Ors. Vs. Gyanendra
Kumar Sharma@ G.K. Sharma (supra). In the wake of the said circumstances, we do not find any
reason to differ from the view taken in the case of Union of India & Ors. Vs. Gyanendra Kumar
Sharma@ G.K. Sharma (supra) and, therefore, the appeal is dismissed on the same grounds.
It shall be open to the respondents to pass appropriate orders keeping in view the terms of the
impugned judgment.
