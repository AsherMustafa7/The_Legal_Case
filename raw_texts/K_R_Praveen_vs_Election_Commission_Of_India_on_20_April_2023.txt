K R Praveen vs Election Commission Of India on 20 April, 2023
shall be completed (Thursday)
The Deputy Commissioner, Chikkamagaluru was appointed as a Returning Officer by the ECI for
Chikkamagaluru Local Authorities Constituency Election. It is contended that the elected members
of 9 municipalities in Chikkamagaluru were eligible to vote. Out of said 9 municipalities, City
Municipal Council, Chikkamagaluru did not have elected representatives, therefore, there were no
voters in the voters list from the City Municipal Council, Chikkamagaluru. Nominated members of
the 9 municipalities were included in the voters list in No.12, Chikkamagaluru Local Authorities
Constituency in view of mandate of proviso to Article 243R(2) of the Constitution of India. It is the
case of respondents No.1 to 4 that nominated members cannot be included in the voters list, as the
same would be contrary to Section 7 of the Karnataka Municipal Corporation Act, 1976 (for short
'the Act of 1976'), Section 11 and Section 352(1)(b) of the Karnataka Municipalities Act, 1964 (for
short 'the Act of 1964'). It is contended that the nominated members from 4 municipalities were not
included in the final voters list. However, nominated members from Town Panchayat Mudigeri,
Town Panchayat, Narasimharajapura Town Panchayat Shringeri and Town Panchayat Koppa were
included in the final voters list, contrary to law. Respondents No.1 to 4 filed a writ petition in
W.P.No.1824/2022 challenging the inclusion of nominated members in the final voters list of the
aforesaid Town Panchayats.
2.2. Respondent No.1 in W.A.Nos.1251/2022 and 1256/2022 was the candidate of Chikkamagaluru
Local Authority Constituency of biennial election to the Karnataka Legislative Council from Local
Authorities Constituency, 2021. It is contended that respondent No.1 was an ex-member of
Karnataka Legislative Council having represented the 12 Chikkamagaluru Local Authorities
Constituency during the year 2010-15. The Electoral Registration Officer issued notice of election to
the Karnataka Legislative Council in 12 Chikkamagaluru Local Authorities Constituency and the
calendar of events was published, as referred above in para 2.1. Respondent No.1 contested the
election as a candidate of the Indian National Congress party and four others have also contested
the election. The appellant was declared as a returned candidate. It is contended that 12
Chikkamagaluru Local Authorities Constituency, 2021 consists of Zilla Panchayat, Taluk Panchayat,
City Municipal Council and Town Municipal Council. It is further contended that the Electoral
Registration Officer included the names of nominated members in the final electoral list.
Respondent No.1 aggrieved by the inclusion of the names of respondents No.5 to 7 in the electoral of
Koppa Taluk Panchayat, filed a writ petition in W.P.No.1850/2022.
2.3. Respondents No.4 and 5 in W.A.No. 1247/2022 are elected as members of Saraswathipura
Gram Panchayat and Hiregowja Gram Panchayat. Both the gram panchayats are situated within
Chikkamagaluru District. Their names are entered in the electoral roll of the Chikkamagaluru Local
Authorities Constituency and they casted their vote in the election held on 10.12.2021. It is
contended in para-11 of the memorandum of writ petition that respondent Nos.4 to 15 therein are
nominated members to the Town Panchayats under Section 352(1)(b) of the Act of 1964. The
inclusion of nominated members in the electoral roll is contrary to law. Hence, filed writ petition in
W.P.No.1876/2022 challenging the inclusion of names of respondents No.4 to 15 therein.

K R Praveen vs Election Commission Of India on 20 April, 2023
2.4. Election Commission of India and Electoral Registration Officer filed statement of objections in
the aforesaid writ petitions taking common defence. It is contended that electoral roll for elections
to the Legislative Council of a State in any local authority constituency is prepared as per Section
27(2) of the Representation of People Act, 1950 (for short 'the Act of 1950'), and further contended
that the language used in Article 171(3)(a) of the Constitution of India is the members of the
municipalities. Similarly, Section 27(2)(a)&(b) of the Act of 1950, mentions "Members". Therefore,
for the purpose of election, the Electoral Registration Officer prepared electoral roll containing the
members of the local authorities concerned within the constituency. The Electoral Registration
Officer cannot confine the electoral roll to only certain category of members, i.e., elected members
as claimed by the petitioners in the writ petitions. It is further contended that Article 243R(2)(a)(i)
of the Constitution of India does not provide for a bar on voting in such elections by nominated
members of the local authorities. It is contended that the said provision cannot be stretched to
include within its ambit, bar on the right to vote in the elections to the State Legislative Councils.
Article 243R does not deal with the election to the Legislative Council. Had the Parliament intended
to exclude the nominated members from the electorate, it would have specifically stated so. It is not
the intention of the Parliament to exclude the nominated members from the electorate of local
authority constituency. It is contended that the word 'Councilor' and 'Constitution of Municipal
Council' under the Act of 1964, indicates that the nominated members are part of composition of the
municipalities, though nominated members are not entitled to vote in the meeting of the municipal
council/corporation, but they have every right to attend the meeting and participate in the
proceedings. It is contended that if nominated members are not entitled to vote, the same does not
imply that they cease to be members of the municipal council/corporation. It is contended that the
nominated members are the members of the municipal council/corporation. The Electoral
Registration Officer has rightly included the names of nominated members in the electoral roll. It is
further contended that the draft electoral roll was published on 11.11.2021. None of the political
parties filed objections regarding inclusion of nominated members in the draft electoral roll and
final roll was published on 23.11.2021. Hence, prayed to dismiss the writ petitions.
2.5. The appellants herein filed statement of objections reiterating the statement of objections filed
by the ECI and prayed to dismiss the writ petitions.
2.6. The learned Single Judge after hearing the parties, allowed the writ petitions vide order dated
03.11.2022, and declared the electoral roll of Koppa, Mudigeri, Shringeri, Narasimharajapura Town
Panchayats as ab-initio void, unconstitutional and quashed the impugned electoral roll and directed
the Electoral Registration Officer to delete their names in the electoral roll. The appellants aggrieved
by the common order passed by the learned Single Judge in the aforesaid writ petitions, filed these
writ appeals.
3. Heard learned senior counsel Sri. Ashok Haranahalli, Sri. K. N. Phaneendra and Sri. Vivek S.
Reddy for the appellants and learned senior counsel Sri. Ravivarma Kumar and Sri. Kantharaja, for
contesting respondents/petitioners.
4. Learned senior counsel Sri. Ashok Haranahalli submits that the writ petitions filed by the
petitioners therein is not maintainable as the petitioners therein have filed election petitions
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/38599845/ 19
K R Praveen vs Election Commission Of India on 20 April, 2023
challenging the inclusion of names of nominated members in the electoral rolls and the said election
petitions are pending for consideration. He further submits that the petitioners have got an
alternative remedy under Section 24 of the Act of 1950. He further submits that without exhausting
the alternative remedy, the petitioners have filed the writ petitions. Hence the writ petitions filed by
the petitioners are not maintainable. He submits that Section 22 and 23 of the Act of 1950, applies
to the local authorities. He further submits that nominated members have every right to cast their
vote. As per Section 62 of the Representation of People Act, 1951 (for short 'the Act of 1951'), every
person who is enrolled as a voter is entitled to vote, except who has occurred disqualification under
the provision. He further submits that Article 329B of the Constitution of India provides a bar for
interference by the Court in electoral matters. He submits that the petitioners under the guise of
challenge to the electoral rolls have challenged the election process itself. As such, by applying bar,
petitions ought not to have been entertained by the learned Single Judge. He further submits that
Article 171 of the Constitution of India provides for composition of legislative council and Article
243R provides for composition of municipalities and further submits that Article 243(2)(a) provides
that a person having a special knowledge or experience in the municipal administration is the
representative of the municipality. Hence, the appellants are the nominated persons having special
knowledge and experience in the municipal administration. Further, he submits that the 'nominated
members' fall within the definition of 'councilors' as per Section 2(6) of the Act of 1964. He further
submits that Section 11 of the Act of 1964 provides the constitution of municipal councils and
sub-section (b) specifies that not more than 5 members nominated by the Government from
amongst the residents of the municipal area and who are persons having special knowledge and
experience in municipal administration or matters relating to health, town planning or education, or
social workers. He further submits that the rider 'not to vote', cannot be stretched. Hence he submits
that the reasoning of the learned Single Judge is contrary to law and against the provisions referred
above.
In order to buttress his argument, he has placed reliance on the following judgments:

He further submits that the ECI has issued clarification in regard to whether nominated members
are entitled to right to vote. Hence on these grounds, he prayed to allow the writ appeals.
5. Learned senior counsel Sri. K. N. Phaneendra appearing for ECI submits that the writ petitions
filed by the petitioners are not maintainable as the petitioners have got an alternative remedy. He
further submits that the Electoral Registration Officer has rightly included the names of nominated
members in the electoral roll. He further submits that the learned Single Judge ought to have
relegated the petitioners to file an appeal under Section 24 of the Act of 1951. He further submits
that as per Section 355-B of the Act of 1964, the nominated member is called as an additional
councilor of municipal council. He further submits that draft voters list was published on 11.11.2021,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/38599845/ 21
K R Praveen vs Election Commission Of India on 20 April, 2023
including the names of nominated members in the Local Authority Constituency Electoral Roll.
None of them filed objections to the draft voters list. He further submits that final voters list was
published on 23.11.2021, and the date of polling was scheduled on 10.12.2021. He submits that after
the declaration of result, the petitioners have filed the writ petitions challenging the voters list. He
further submits that if the objections was not filed, they have no right to challenge the voters list
under Section 24 of the Act of 1951.
In order to buttress his argument, he has placed reliance on the judgment of this Court in the case of
L.SHIVANNA VS. STATE OF KARNATAKA reported in ILR 1988 KAR 2121. Hence on these
grounds he prays to allow the writ appeals.
6. Learned senior counsel Sri. Vivek Reddy places reliance on the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex
Court on the case of PONNUSWAMI VS. RETURNING OFFICER & ORS., reported in AIR 1952 SC
64. He submits that the point which emerged from para-29 in the said judgment is, the right to vote
is a creature of statute and he submits that as per Section 27(2)(b) of the Act of 1950, every member
has a right to vote and it is created by a statute. He further submits that once the right of vote is
given under Section 27, it cannot be taken by adding some words. He submits that such adding of
words by implication, as done by the learned Single Judge, is neither necessary nor is acceptable and
same would be amounting to rewriting of the provision. He submits that the intention of the law
maker was with reference to the entire body and not segregating the body between the elected
members and nominated members. He submits that there may be some omission in the provision.
The Court should not add the words and it is presumed that omission is considered by the
legislature. Further in order to buttress his argument, he has placed reliance on the judgment of the
Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of S.NARAYANASWAMY VS. ELECTION COMMISSIONER OF
INDIA reported in AIR 1972 SC 2284. He further submits that there is no difference between
nominated and elected member. Hence on these grounds he prays to allow the writ appeals.
7. Sri Ravivarma Kumar, learned Senior counsel submits that Article 171 of the Constitution of India
provides composition of the Legislative Councils and he submits that out of the total number of
members in the Legislative Council of a State, as nearly as may be, one-third shall be elected by
electorates consisting of members of municipalities, district boards and such other local authorities
in the State as Parliament may by law specify. Further he submits that the words used in Clause (a)
of Article 171(3) of the Constitution of India is, 'local authorities'.
7.1. He submits that Section 27 of the Act of 1950 provides preparation of electoral rolls for
Assembly constituencies and the words used in Clause
(a) of Sub-Section (2) of Section 27 is 'local authorities' and Clause (b) of Sub-Section (2) of Section
27 provides that every member of each such local authority within a local authorities' constituency
shall be entitled to be registered in the electoral roll for that constituency. The word used is
'member'. Only members are included in the electoral roll and other than members no other persons
are entitled to be registered in the electoral. He further submits that if there is any change in the
membership, then Clause
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/38599845/ 22
K R Praveen vs Election Commission Of India on 20 April, 2023
(d) of Sub-Rule 2 of Section 21 provides that the said provision was before 74th amendment to the
Constitution Part IXA was added.
7.2. Further, he places reliance on the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in regard to the
Constitution (Seventy-Fourth Amendment) Act, 1992, and the object is to remove anomaly and to
set vibrant democratic units of self-government and having regard to the ensuring regular conduct
of elections; ensuring timely elections; and providing adequate representations.
7.3. He submits that Article 243R of the Constitution of India provides Composition of
Municipalities. Article 243R(2)(a)(i) provides for the representation in a Municipality of persons
having special knowledge or experience in Municipal administration, etc. He further submits that
Section 352 of the Act of 1964, provides for Election to Town Panchayat. He submits that the
nominated members are not entitled to right to vote. He further submits that the nominated
members are only advisory members. He submits that doctrine of Adult Franchise is not available to
nominated members. He further submits that the State Legislature cannot amend the Central Act.
Further he places reliance on Articles 325 and 326 of the Constitution of India. He submits that once
the Councilors are elected, the process is complete and nominated members cannot be treated as
members and nominated members do not possess right to vote.
7.4. The sum and substance of his entire argument is that the nominated members do not possess
right to vote and he further submits that the Electoral Registration Officer has committed an error
in including the name of the nominated members in the electoral roll.
7.5. He further submits that Section 100 of the Act of 1951, provides the grounds for declaring
election to be void and he further submits that the voters list cannot be challenged in the election
petition. He further submits that the voters list can be challenged only by way of filing a writ petition
and bar is made under Section 100 of the Act of 1951 for challenging the electoral roll.
7.6. In order to buttress his arguments, he has placed reliance on the following judgments:

learned Senior counsel and also places reliance on the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the
case of L.SHIVANNA VS. STATE OF KARNATAKA reported in ILR 1988 KAR 2121 and he further
submits that there is no bar in filing a writ petition even if there an alternative remedy is provided.
He further places reliance on the order passed by the Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in
W.P.No.4457/2022, wherein the Co-ordinate Bench held that the nominated members have no right
to vote. Hence, on these grounds, he prays to dismiss the writ appeal.
9. Perused the records and considered the submissions of the learned counsel for the parties.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/38599845/ 24
K R Praveen vs Election Commission Of India on 20 April, 2023
10. The points that would arise for consideration are:
1) Whether the writ petition filed by the petitioners is maintainable even though an
alternative remedy is available?
2) Whether the nominated members have right to vote?
3) What order?
11. Point No.1: In order to consider the point, it is necessary to consider Section 22 of the Act of
1950, which reads thus:
"22. Correction of entries in electoral rolls. --If the electoral registration officer for a
constituency, on application made to him or on his own motion, is satisfied after such
inquiry as he thinks fit, that any entry in the electoral roll of the constituency--
(a) is erroneous or defective in any particular,
(b) should be transposed to another place in the roll on the ground that the person
concerned has changed his place of ordinary residence within the constituency, or
(c) should be detected on the ground that the person concerned is dead or has ceased
to be ordinarily resident in the constituency or is otherwise not entitled to be
registered in that roll, the electoral registration officer shall, subject to such general
or special direction, if any, as may be given by the Election Commission in this behalf,
amend, transpose or delete the entry after proper verification of facts in such manner
as may be prescribed:
Provided that before taking any action on any ground under clause (a) or clause (b)
or any action under clause (c) on the ground that the person concerned has ceased to
be ordinarily resident in the constituency or that he is otherwise not entitled to be
registered in the electoral roll of that constituency, the electoral registration officer
shall give the person concerned a reasonable opportunity of being heard in respect of
the action proposed to be taken in relation to him after proper verification of facts in
such manner as may be prescribed."
11.1. Section 21 of the Act, 1950 provides the electoral roll for each constituency shall be prepared in
the prescribed manner by reference to the qualifying date and shall come into force immediately
upon its final publication in accordance with the rules made under this Act.
11.2. Section 22 of the Act, 1950 deals with correction of entries in electoral rolls-If the electoral
registration officer for a constituency, on application made to him or on his own motion, is satisfied
after such inquiry as he thinks fit, that any entry in the electoral roll of the constituency is erroneous
or defective or etc. As authority to correct the entries in the electoral roll. Section 23 of the Act, 1950
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/38599845/ 25
K R Praveen vs Election Commission Of India on 20 April, 2023
provides inclusion of names in electoral rolls, wherein any person whose name is not included in the
electoral roll of a constituency may apply to the electoral registration officer for the inclusion of his
name in that roll.
11.3. Section 24 of the Act, 1950 provides filing an appeal to the district magistrate or additional
district magistrate from any order of the Electoral Registration Officer under Section 22 or Section
23.
12. Further, Rule 27 of the Registration of Electors Rules, 1960 (for short 'the Rules of 1960)
provides that every appeal under clause (a) of section 24 of the Act shall be in the form of a
memorandum signed by the appellant. Rule 23 of the Rules of 1960 provides for appeals from
orders deciding claims and objections.
13. From the perusal of Section 24 of the Act of 1950, it is clear that an appeal shall lie against an
order of Electoral Registration Officer under Section 22 or Section 23 to the District Magistrate or
Additional District Magistrate or Executive Magistrate, etc.
14. Admittedly, in the present case, the District Magistrate is the Electoral Registration Officer, who
as prepared the electoral roll and he himself being an appellate Authority, the appeal would not lie
before the person who was prepared the electoral roll. Further, the issue involved in the present case
is, whether the nominated member has right to cast his vote. The controversy involved in this writ
appeal is purely a legal one and does not involve disputed question of facts, but only a question of
law. If the controversy is purely a legal one, it should be decided by the High Court under Article 226
of the Constitution of India, instead of dismissing the writ petition on the ground of an alternative
remedy being available.
15. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of GODREJ SARA LEE LTD., VS. THE EXCISE AND
TAXATION OFFICER-CUM-ASSESSING AUTHORITY AND OTHERS, wherein the Hon'ble Apex
Court held in para No.4, as under:
"4. Before answering the questions, we feel the urge to say a few words on the
exercise of writ powers conferred by Article 226 of the Constitution having come
across certain orders passed by the high courts holding writ petitions as "not
maintainable" merely because the alternative remedy provided by the relevant
statutes has not been pursued by the parties desirous of invocation of the writ
jurisdiction. The power to issue prerogative writs under Article 226 is plenary in
nature. Any limitation on the exercise of such power must be traceable in the
Constitution itself.
Profitable reference in this regard may be made to Article 329 and ordainments of
other similarly worded articles in the Constitution. Article 226 does not, in terms,
impose any limitation or restraint on the exercise of power to issue writs. While it is
true that exercise of writ powers despite availability of a remedy under the very
statute which has been invoked and has given rise to the action impugned in the writ
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/38599845/ 26
K R Praveen vs Election Commission Of India on 20 April, 2023
petition ought not to be made in a routine manner, yet, the mere fact that the
petitioner before the high court, in a given case, has not pursued the alternative
remedy available to him/it cannot mechanically be construed as a ground for its
dismissal. It is axiomatic that the high courts (bearing in mind the facts of each
particular case) have a discretion whether to entertain a writ petition or not. One of
the self-imposed restrictions on the exercise of power under Article 226 that has
evolved through judicial precedents is that the high courts should normally not
entertain a writ petition, where an effective and efficacious alternative remedy is
available. At the same time, it must be remembered that mere availability of an
alternative remedy of appeal or revision, which the party invoking the jurisdiction of
the high court under Article 226 has not pursued, would not oust the jurisdiction of
the high court and render a writ petition "not maintainable". In a long line of
decisions, this Court has made it clear that availability of an alternative remedy does
not operate as an absolute bar to the "maintainability" of a writ petition and that the
rule, which requires a party to pursue the alternative remedy provided by a statute, is
a rule of policy, convenience and discretion rather than a rule of law. Though
elementary, it needs to be restated that "entertainability" and "maintainability" of a
writ petition are distinct concepts. The fine but real distinction between the two
ought not to be lost sight of. The objection as to "maintainability" goes to the root of
the matter and if such objection were found to be of substance, the courts would be
rendered incapable of even receiving the lis for adjudication. On the other hand, the
question of "entertainability"
is entirely within the realm of discretion of the high courts, writ remedy being discretionary. A writ
petition despite being maintainable may not be entertained by a high court for very many reasons or
relief could even be refused to the petitioner, despite setting up a sound legal point, if grant of the
claimed relief would not further public interest. Hence, dismissal of a writ petition by a high court
on the ground that the petitioner has not availed the alternative remedy without, however,
examining whether an exceptional case has been made out for such entertainment would not be
proper."
16. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of DHAMPUR SUGAR MILLS LTD., VS. STATE OF U.P.
reported in (2007)8 SCC 338 wherein the Hon'ble Apex Court held that "As an alternative remedy is
available to the writ petitioner, a finding has been recorded by the High Court in favour of the
petitioner and the same has not been challenged by the State before us. Even otherwise, from the
record it is clear that the decision has been taken by the Government. Obviously in such cases,
remedy of appeal cannot be termed as an "alternative or equally efficacious". Once the policy
decision has been taken by the Government, filing of appeal is virtually from Caesar to Caesar's wife,
an empty formality or futile attempt. The High Court was, therefore, right in overruling the
preliminary objection raised by the respondents". Admittedly, in the instant case, the electoral roll
was prepared by the District Magistrate who being electoral registration officer and also an appellate
Authority even if an appeal is preferred before the District Magistrate. It will be an empty formality
or futile attempt. Hence, the writ petition filed by the petitioner is maintainable. As observed above
the controversy is purely legal one and it does not involve the disputed question of fact, but only
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/38599845/ 27
K R Praveen vs Election Commission Of India on 20 April, 2023
question of law. Hence, the writ petitions filed by the petitioners are maintainable. In view of the
above discussion point No.1 is answered in affirmative.
17. Point No.2: In order to consider point No.2, it is necessary to consider Article 243R of the
Constitution of India which reads as under:
243R. Composition of Municipalities-(1) Save as provided in clause (2), all the seats in a
Municipality shall be filled by persons chosen by direct election from the territorial constituencies in
the Municipal area and for this purpose each Municipal area shall be divided into territorial
constituencies to be known as wards. (2) The Legislature of a State may, by law, provide-
(a) for the representation in a
Municipality of-
(i) persons having special
knowledge or experience in
Municipal administration;
(ii) the members of the House of
the People and the members of the
Legislative Assembly of the State representing constituencies which comprise wholly or partly the
Municipal area;
(iii) the members of the Council of States and the members of the Legislative Council of the State
registered electors within tile Municipal area;
(iv) the Chairpersons of the Committees constituted under clause ( 5 ) of article 243S:
Provided that the persons referred to in paragraph (i) shall not have the right to vote in the meetings
of the Municipality;
(b) the manner of election of the Chairperson of a Municipality.
(Emphasis Supplied) 17.1. Article 243R(2)(a) of the Constitution of India mandate that the
nominated members shall not have right to vote in the meeting of the municipality.
17.2. Further Section 2 (6) of the Act of 1964, reads thus:
2.Definitions.-- In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,--
(1) xxx (2) xxx (3) xxx (4) xxx (5) xxx (6) "Councillor" means any person who is

17.3. Section 11 of the Act, 1964 provides Constitution of Municipal Councils, reads thus:
11. Constitution of municipal councils.--(1) The municipal council shall consist of,--
(a) such number of directly elected councillors specified in column (3) of the table
below in respect of the municipal areas specified in the corresponding entries in
column (2) thereof, namely:--

Assembly, representing a part or whole of the municipal area:
(d) the members of the Council of States and members of the State Legislative
Council registered as electors within the municipal area:
Provided that the persons referred to in clause (b) shall not have the right to vote in
the meetings of the municipal council. (2) Seats shall be reserved in a municipal
council,--
(a) for the Scheduled Castes; and
(b) for the Scheduled Tribes;
and the number of seats so reserved shall bear, as nearly as may be, the same proportion to the total
number of seats to be filled by direct election in the municipal council as the population of the
Scheduled Castes in the municipal area or of the Scheduled Tribes in the municipal area bears to the
total population of the municipal area. Provided that atleast one seat each shall be reserved in a
municipal council for the persons belonging to the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/38599845/ 29
K R Praveen vs Election Commission Of India on 20 April, 2023
Provided further that, if no person belonging to the Scheduled Castes is available the

such seats shall be reserved for the persons falling under category "A" and the remaining twenty per
cent of the seats shall be reserved for the persons falling under category "B":
Provided further that if no person falling under category "A" is available, the seats
reserved for that category shall also be filled by the persons falling under the category
"B" and vice versa.
Provided also that the number of seats so reserved for the backward classes under
this sub-section shall be so determined that the total number of seats reserved for the
scheduled castes and the scheduled tribes under sub-section (2) and the backward

(6) Nothing contained in sub-sections (2), (3) and (4) shall be deemed to prevent the members of
the Scheduled Castes, Schedule Tribes, Backward Classes or Women from standing for election to
the non- reserved seats."
17.4. Section 11(1) of the Act, 1964 is in consonance with Article 243R (2)(a) of the Constitution of
India. Article 243R (2)(a) of the Constitution of India provides for constitution of municipal
councils. Article 243R(1) provides the council shall have elected members whereas Article 243R(2)
provides that the members can be nominated to the council and proviso to Article 243R(2)(a) of the
Constitution of India mandate that the nominating members of the council shall have no right to
vote in the meetings of the council. When the statute prevents from voting in the meetings of the
council, the nominated members have no right to vote in the legislative council.

17.5. Section 11 of the Act of 1964 provides for constitution of municipal councils. Section 11(1)(a) of
the Act, 1964 provides that the Councilors shall have elected member whereas Section 11(1)(b) of the
Act of 1964 provides that not more than five persons nominated by the Government from against
the residents of the municipal area. Proviso to Section 11(1)(b) of the Act of 1964 provides that the
nominated members shall not have the right to vote in the meetings of the Municipal council.
18. In an identical case, the Three Bench of Supreme Court in the case of SHELLY OBEROI & ANR.
VS. OFFICE OF LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR OF DELHI & ORS. reported in 2023 LIVELAW (SC)
119, held that right to vote is not a fundamental right, but it is a constitutional right. The Hon'ble
Apex Court further held that elected members of the Councilors held that the Constitution has
imposed a restriction in terms of which nominated members who are brought in on account of their
special knowledge or experience in Municipal administration do not have the right to vote. The same
restriction finds statutory recognition in Section 3(3)(b)(i) of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act,
and at para Nos.7 and 8, the Hon'ble Apex Court has held as under:
"7. Clause (1) of Article 243R stipulates that all seats in the Municipality shall be filled
in by direct election held from the territorial constituencies in the Municipal area, for
which the Municipal area is divided into wards. An exception, however, is stipulated
in clause (2), in terms of which the legislature of a State may, by law, provide for the
representation in a Municipality of persons fulfilling the descriptions set out in
clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv). Article 243R(2)(a)(i) provides that the legislature of a
State may, by law, provide for the representation in a Municipality of persons having
special knowledge or experience in Municipal administration. However, the proviso
to clause (2) clearly specifies that the persons who are referred to in paragraph (i)
shall not have the right to vote in the meetings of the Municipality. The legislature of
the State may also provide for the manner of election of the Chairperson of the
Municipality.
8. Section 3(3) of the Act is a law as contemplated by Article 243R. In terms of clause
(2) of Article 243R, Section 3(3)(b) provides for the representation in the
Municipality of persons who have special knowledge or experience in Municipal
administration. These persons are nominated by the Administrator. However, in
terms of the proviso to Article 243R(2), a similar restriction is introduced in the
proviso to Section 3(3)(b)(i) of the Act, by which the nominated members do not have
a right to vote in the meetings of the Municipal Corporation."
19. In an identical case, the Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in the case of SRI. LAKSHMIKANTA K.
AND OTHERS VS. THE STATE OF KARNATAKA AND OTHERS in W.P.No. 4457/2022 disposed of
on 18.04.2022 and also placing reliance on the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of
PEOPLE'S UNION FOR CIVIL LIBERTIES AND ANOTHER VS. UNION OF INDIA AND
ANOTHER reported in (2003)4 SCC 399; STATE OF UP VS. KARTAR SINGH reported in AIR 1964
SC 1135; JAILA SINGH VS. STATE OF RAJASTHAN, reported in AIR 74 SC 1436; and STATE OF
HARYANA VS. STATE OF PUNJAB reported in 2004(12) SCC 673 held that nominated and elected
members cannot be treated as belonging to one class. Further, the fundamental difference is that the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/38599845/ 31
K R Praveen vs Election Commission Of India on 20 April, 2023
elected members of the Council are chosen by popular vote and carry with them the mandate of the
people, whereas, nominated members of the Council are appointed as Councilors.
20. Further, by placing reliance on the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of RAMESH
MEHTA VS. SANWAL CHAND SINGHVI reported in (2004) 5 SCC 409 held that there is a
distinction between the nominated members and elected members. While dealing with the scope
and ambit of Article 243R of the Constitution of India, the Hon'ble Apex Court held that
Constitution itself makes a distinction between the elected members and the nominated members,
who play essentially an advisory role. The elected members of the councils are chosen by popular
vote and carry with them the mandate of the people, whereas, nominated members of the Council
are appointed as Councilors. The elected member and nominated members cannot be said to be
belonging to the same class and there is no pleading that differentiation between elected and
nominated members is either unreasonable or is arbitrary or that it does not rest on any rational
basis. Thus, the nominated members are not entitled to right to vote as the nominated members
stand on a different footing than the elected members.
21. In the case of Ramesh Mehta (Supra) at paragraph Nos.11, 22 and 25 the Hon'ble Apex Court has
held under:
"11. In the present case, on facts, we are concerned with post-1994 position. Article
243-R brought about a drastic change in the matter of composition of Municipalities.
It lays down guidelines with regard to the constitution, composition, election and
rights of the members of a Municipality. Under the said Act, members of a
Municipality are persons chosen by direct election by the residents of a municipal
area (ward). Article 243-R(2)(a)(i) allows the legislature of a State to appoint any
person as a member of the Board who has special knowledge in the field of municipal
administration, however, the proviso appended to the said Article precludes persons
nominated under sub-clause (i) from having a right to vote in the meetings of the
Municipality. The Constitution, therefore, makes a distinction between elected
members and nominated members who play essentially an advisory role. Pursuant to
the 74th Constitutional amendment of 1994, sections 9, 65 and 72 of the Act were
amended. Prior to the amendment the co-opted members were at par with the elected
members, however, after 1994 only elected members and members of the Legislative
Assembly have a right to vote under section 9(1) of the Act. Under sub-section (2) of
section 65, as amended, the Chairman has to be elected by "elected members of the
board". This change is very important. Prior to 1994, the Chairman was to be elected
by the "members of the board", which is the phrase used in the unamended section
65(2), as the co-opted members had a right to vote. However, in 1994, section 65(2)
of the Act was amended and the expression "members of the board" in the old section
is substituted by the expression "elected members of the board". In fact, the
expression "whole number of members" earlier appearing in sections 65 and 72 of the
Act have been deleted because in section 65(2) it is expressly provided that the
Chairman shall be elected only by elected members of the board from amongst
themselves. Therefore, the scheme of post-1994 Act is that the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/38599845/ 32
K R Praveen vs Election Commission Of India on 20 April, 2023
Chairman/Vice-Chairman shall be elected by the elected members of the Boards and
their office shall stand vacated on passing of no-confidence motion by the elected
members of the Board. The position which, therefore, emerges is that both before and
after 1994, the no-confidence motion had to be voted upon by members who were
entitled to vote. As stated above, Section 3 of the Act begins with the words "unless
the context otherwise requires". Section 3(36) defines the expression "whole
number"/"total number" to mean total number of members holding the office at the
given time. The said expression "whole number of members" finds place in rule 3(5),
(8) and (9). Hence, we have to read rule 3(5), (8) and (9) in the context of the
provisions of the said Act. As stated above, the basic scheme of the Act prior to 1994
and post-1994 has remained unchanged. In both cases, the legislative intent has been
that the office of the Chairman/Vice-Chairman shall stand vacated on passing of
no-confidence motion by the members of the Board who are entitled to vote. Hence,
in our view, the expression "whole number"
or "total number" connotes the "total number of elected members.
22. A right to contest election although arises under a statute but having regard to the Constitution
(Seventy-fourth) Amendment Act, the interpretation thereof must be made keeping in view the
constitutional scheme. Democracy at the grass-root level was sought to be introduced by reason of
the said amendment in the Constitution. Once the concept of a grass-root democracy is accepted, a
pragmatic and purposive meaning to the provisions of the Act must be assigned.
25. It is accepted that the Rules have not been altered despite the fact that amendments have been
carried out in the Municipalities Act in the year 1994. All members who were not elected members
under the unamended provisions were treated as elected members. Their rights were at par with
them. The very fact that the Constitution made a difference between an elected member and
nominated member in the matter of election and removal of a Chairman is suggestive of the fact that
now a new interpretation is called for. Nominated members are persons with special knowledge in
the subject. They are nominated so that they may render their advices properly to the members of
the Board which would enable it to run the municipal affairs efficiently. They remain as member of
the Board irrespective of the fact that as to who is the person occupying the post or his political
affinity. He is not concerned with election. He does not take part in it. A fortiorari he has also not
been assigned any role to play as regard removal of the Chairman or Vice-Chairman."
22. Further the Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in the case of SMT. SAVITRI VS THE STATE OF
KARNATAKA reported in ILR 2003 KAR 4653 held in para-16 that there is no merit in the
contentions of the learned counsel for the appellant that non- issuance of notice to MP and MLA and
their absence in the meeting has vitiated the proceedings. It is also the contention of the learned
counsel that the term "Councilors" has been defined under Section 2(6) of Act of 1964 as any person
who is legally a member of the Municipal Council or Town Panchayat. In view of the decision of the
Division Bench of this Court in CHANDUBI'S case which still holds the field, it is clear that for the
purpose of Section 42(9) of the Act of 1964, in order to quantify the total number of Councilors, it is
only the Councilors who are eligible and entitled for voting whose number has to be considered and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/38599845/ 33
K R Praveen vs Election Commission Of India on 20 April, 2023
the term 'councilor' referred to in Section 2(6) would only mean "legally elected member and not
otherwise".
23. From the perusal of the aforesaid judgment it is clear that only elected members are to be
considered as a councilor as per Section 2(6) of the Act of 1964 and not the nominated members.
24. Further, the statement of objects and reasons appended to the Constitution (Seventy- Fourth
Amendment) Act, 1992 is in many States local bodies have become week and ineffective on account
of a variety of reasons, including the failure to hold regular elections, prolonged supersessions and
inadequate devolution of powers and functions. Further, having regard to these inadequacies, it is
considered necessary that provisions relating to Urban Local Bodies are incorporated in the
Constitution.
25. Admittedly, the nominated members are represented having a special knowledge or experience
of municipal administration in the municipality . As per the Constitution (Seventy-Fourth
Amendment) Act, 1992 the nominated members have no voting right. The said aspect was
considered by the learned Single Judge and has passed the impugned order. We are of the opinion
that the nominated members have no voting right. The Chief Electoral Officer committed an error in
including the names of nominated members in the electoral roll.
26. The learned Senior counsel for the appellant submits that the petitioner/respondent cannot
initiate parallel proceedings as the petitioner has already filed an election petition and on the same
ground the petitioner has filed this writ petition.
27. We have perused the copy of election petitions. The relief sought in the election petition reads as
under:
"a) Call for records;
b) Order for re-counting of votes to exclude the twelve void votes caste by 'nominated
persons' (referred to in Table-A) in favour of respondent No.1.
c) Declare that the result of the Election of respondent No.1, as Returned Candidate
to fill the seat of Member of Legislative Council, Karnataka from Chikkamagaluru
Local Authorities Constituency - 12 is void in terms of section 100 (1) of the
Representation of People Act, 1951;
d) Declare that the result of the Election of respondent No.1, as Returned Candidate
to fill the seat of Member of Legislative Council, Karnataka from Chikkamalagaluru
Locak Authorities Constituency - 12 is "materially affected", by the improper
reception to twelve(12) void votes caste in favour of respondent No.1, by 'Nominated
Persons', referred to in Table-A in terms of section 100(1)(d)(iii) and section
100(1)(d)(iv) of the Representation of People Act, 1951;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/38599845/ 34
K R Praveen vs Election Commission Of India on 20 April, 2023
e) Declare that the respondent No.2 is duly elected to fill the seat of Member of
Legislative Council, Karnataka from Chikkamagaluru Local Authorities Constituency
- 12;
f) Pass such other order or orders as this Hon'ble Court deems fit in facts and
circumstances of the case, in the interest of justice and equity;
g) Award cost towards this petition."
The relief sought in the election petition is different from the one sought in the writ petition. Though
similar grounds are raised in the election petition, it does not prohibit the petitioner from
challenging the electoral roll in the writ petition. Further, the Election Tribunal has no jurisdiction
to go into the validity of the electoral rolls under Section 100 the Act of 1951. Hence, it cannot be
said that the petitioner has initiated a parallel proceedings.
28. Learned counsel for the appellant places reliance on various judgments. There is no dispute in
regard to the law laid down in the aforesaid judgments. But the said judgments are not applicable to
the case on hand.
In view of above discussion, point No.2 is answered in negative.
29. Point No.3: In view of the above discussion, we proceed to pass the following:
ORDER The writ appeals are dismissed.
In view of disposal of the writ
appeals, pending IAs., if any, do not
survive for consideration and are
accordingly disposed of.
