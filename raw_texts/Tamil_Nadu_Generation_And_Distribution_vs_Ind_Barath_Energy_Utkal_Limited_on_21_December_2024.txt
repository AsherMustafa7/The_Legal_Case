(cid:12) ORDER
The applicant, who suffered an award before the Arbitral Tribunal, in
and by an award dated 10.04.2024, has filed a petition under Section 34 of
the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, challenging the said award.

Tamil Nadu Generation And Distribution vs Ind Barath Energy Utkal Limited on 21 December, 2024
2.Pending the original petition under Section 34, the applicant seeks
for stay of the operation of the award.
3.I have heard Mr.Om Prakash, learned Senior Counsel for
Mr.S.T.Raja, learned counsel for the applicant and Mr.N.Vijaya Narayan,
learned Senior Counsel for Ms.Tanushree Arvind, learned counsel for the
respondent.
4.Mr.Om Prakash, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the applicant
would contend that even before the Arbitral Tribunal, an application was
moved under Section 16, questioning the jurisdiction of the Arbitral
Tribunal in view of the express provisions in the Electricity Act, 2003. He
would further fairly submit that the Arbitral Tribunal rejected the said
contentions raised by the applicant, which is being challenged as one of the
2/13
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
(cid:12) primordial grounds in the Section 34 petition. He would further refer to the
specific provisions in the Electricity Act, namely Section 79(f) of the
Electricity Act, 2003, in this regard.
5.The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the applicant would
further contend that since the very jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal is
under question in the Section 34 petition, interim stay of the award has to be
necessarily granted, as otherwise the respondent would proceed to recover
the huge amount of Rs.120 crores, together with interest and costs. The
learned Senior Counsel would further state that in view of the very challenge
to the lack of jurisdiction on the Tribunal itself, there is prima facie case for
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/136407668/ 2
Tamil Nadu Generation And Distribution vs Ind Barath Energy Utkal Limited on 21 December, 2024
grant of interim stay of the award. He would further submit that the
applicant is a public utility company, rendering an important service of
supply of power / electricity and if stay is not granted, irreperable loss and
hardship will be caused to the applicant. He would therefore pray for an
unconditional stay of the award in favour of the applicant.
6.Mr.Om Prakash, learned Senior Counsel placed reliance on the
3/13
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
(cid:12) judgement passed by the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity in PSPN Synergy
Private Limited Vs. Uttar Pradesh Electirity Regulatory Commission and
Others passed in Appeal Nos.202 & 205 of 2019 to fortify his contentions
that the applicant was justified in invoking the bank guarantee to the tune of
Rs.120 crores on the ground of liquidated damages, consequent to the delay
on the part of the respondent herein. Referring to the said decision of the
Appellate Tribunal, the learned Senior Counsel would submit that Power
Purchase Agreement would come into effect on the execution of the same
and the adoption by the State Commission was only a formal order and
therefore, invoices could be raised even pending the formal Tariff Adoption
order.
7.Per contra, Mr.Vijaya Narayan, learned Senior Counsel appearing
for the respondent would submit that merely because the applicant is a
public utility company, it cannot enjoy any special status and would have to
be treated like any other litigant. He would further contend with regard to
applicability of the statutory scheme under the Electricity Act, 2003. The
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/136407668/ 3
Tamil Nadu Generation And Distribution vs Ind Barath Energy Utkal Limited on 21 December, 2024
Arbitral Tribunal has rightly gone into the objections raised by the applicant
and negatived the same. He would further submit that even the cost of the
4/13
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
(cid:12) arbitration were not paid by the applicant and on behalf of the applicant, the
respondent was constrained to settle the arbitration fees to enable them to
even obtain a copy of the award.
8.The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the respondent would also
place heavy reliance on the decision of the Honorable Supreme Court in
International Seaport Dredging Private Limited Vs. Kamarajar Port
Limited, reported in 2024 SCC Online SC 3112, where the Honorable
Supreme Court has rejected the arguments of the applicant for stay that the
condition should be relaxed because of the status of the respondent being a
statutory authority and further held that under Order XLI of CPC, the Court
has the power to direct full deposit and / or funish security in respect of the
deposited amount and on the facts of the said case, the Honorable Supreme
Court directed the applicant seeking stay to deposit 75% of the decree
amount inclusive of interest and subject to compliance of the said deposit,
stay of the enforcement of the Arbitral award was granted.
5/13
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
(cid:12) 9.I have carefully considered the submissions advanced by the
learnerd Senior Counsel on either side.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/136407668/ 4
Tamil Nadu Generation And Distribution vs Ind Barath Energy Utkal Limited on 21 December, 2024
10.The Arbitral Tribunal, in and by an award dated 10.04.2024, has
directed the applicant to refund a sum of Rs.120 crores together with interest
at 9% per annum from the date of invocation of the Contract Performance
Guarantee i.e., 22.02.2018, till the date of payment. The Tribunal has also
directed the applicant to meet the costs of the arbitration. The learned Senior
Counsel has filed a memo of computation of the outstanding amount as on
17.12.2024, which calculation is not seriously disputed by the learned Senior
Counsel appearing for the applicant.
11.Admittedly the amount of Rs.222,64,31,107/- is due and payable
under the award as on 17.12.2024. The Arbitral Tribunal has also clearly
held that the issue of jurisdiction raised under Section 16 was already
declined in and by a detailed order dated 14.03.2023 and that even on
reconsideration, the Tribunal has come to the conclusion that it is vested
with jurisdiction to determine the claims made by the respondent.
6/13
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
(cid:12) 12.As rightly held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in International
Seaport Dredging Private Limited's case, under Section 36(3), an application
for stay may be considered by the Court subject to such conditions, it may
deem fit and for reasons to be recorded in writing. In fact, after the
amendment brought about by the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment)
Act, 2015, the first proviso to Subsection 3 stipulates that the Court while
considering the application for stay of the arbitral award for payment of
money would have to have due regard to the provisions related to grant of
stay of a money decree under the Code of Civil Procedure. No doubt, the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/136407668/ 5
Tamil Nadu Generation And Distribution vs Ind Barath Energy Utkal Limited on 21 December, 2024
second proviso provides that the Court even grant an unconditional stay.
However, I do not find on a prima facie examination of the award, especially
in the light of the grounds of challenge under Section 34 petition, there is
any allegation of fraud or corruption, warranting an unconditional stay.
Therefore, it is to be seen whether the applicant is entitled to stay and if so,
what conditions the stay order should be subjected to.
13.The case on hand is very similar to the facts of the case in
International Seaport Dredging Private Limited's case before the Apex
7/13
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
(cid:12) Court. The High court, in the said case, had shown leniency to the applicant
seeking stay of the award on the ground that it was a statutory authority and
thereby had directed furnishing of bank guarantee for the principal amount.
The Apex Court, following the ratio laid down in Pam Developments
Private Limited Vs. State of West Bengal, repoted in (2019) 8 SCC 112 and
Toyo Engineering Corporation Vs. Indian Oil Corporation Limited, reported
in 2021 SCC Online SC 3455, held that Arbitration Act being a self
contained Court, there is no distinction between Government and private
entities. It further held that the decision of the Court cannot be influenced by
the position of the party before it and the form of security required to be
furnished should not determined by weather the party is a statutory body or
Government body or private entity, since the parties have entered into
commercial transactions and they should be conscious of the implications of
compliance and non compliance of contracts and consequences thereof.

14.Admittedly the applicant has suffered an award by the Arbitral
Tribunal consists of three Arbitrators who have unanimously held in favour
of the respondent/claimant, rejecting the contention of the applicant with
regard to jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal.
8/13
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
(cid:12) 15.Even with regard to the reliance placed on by the learned Senior
Counsel, Mr.Om Prakash to the provisions of Electricity Act, 2003, I am
unable to prima facie see any statutory mandate for the dispute being
referred to the Electricity Regulatory Central Commission under Section 79.
The clause referred to by the learned Senior Counsel, Mr Om Prakash is
extracted hereunder for easy understanding.
“79.Functions of Central Commission.- 1.The
Central Commission shall discharge the following
functions, namely:-
(a) to regulate the tariff of generating companies
owned or controlled by the Central Government;
(b) to regulate the tariff of generating companies
other than those owned or controlled by the Central
Government specified in clause (a), if such generating
companies enter into or otherwise have a composite
scheme for generation and sale of electricity in more
than one State;
(c) to regulate the inter-State transmission of
electricity;
(d) to determine tariff for inter-State transmission
of electiricity;
(e) to issue license to persons to function as
transmission licensee and electricity trader with respect
of their inter-State operations;
9/13
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
(cid:12) (f) to adjudicate upon disputes involving
generating companies or transmission licensee in
regard to matters connected with clauses (a) to (d)
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/136407668/ 7
Tamil Nadu Generation And Distribution vs Ind Barath Energy Utkal Limited on 21 December, 2024
above and to refer any dispute for arbitration.”
16.On a plain reading of the above said provisions it stipulates that the
reference of any dispute for arbitration by the Central Commission would
arise only in relation to clauses (a) to (d) which all clearly pertain only to
regulation of tariff, as can be seen from the above extracted portion. In any
event, unless the applicant is able to show that Section 34 of the Arbitration
and Conciliation Act is attracted to the award in question and that it is liable
to be set aside on the available and limited grounds set out under Section 34,
this Court will not sit in appeal over the award of the Tribunal.
17.The Tribunal has arrived at specific findings that there is no delay
on the part of the claimant and the applicant was not justified in invoking the
bank guarantee for the alleged delay on the part of the claimant. Any how,
these issues can be gone into only while hearing the Section 34 petition and
the arbitration process itself being adopted for fast resolution of disputes
between the parties, no such special treatment can be given to the applicant
when it comes to granting of stay merely because it is a statutory authority.
10/13
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
(cid:12) 18.Section 18 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act also is very
clear that the parties before the Tribunal shall be treated with equality and in
view of the above, there is no merit in the contention that merely because the
applicant is a statutory authority, an unconditional stay ought to be granted.
However, considering the fact that the Arbitral Tribunal Tribunal has
awarded reimbursement of Contract Performance Guarantee amount of
Rs.120 crores, finding that it was wrongly encashed by the applicant and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/136407668/ 8
Tamil Nadu Generation And Distribution vs Ind Barath Energy Utkal Limited on 21 December, 2024
directed the same to be paid along with interest and costs, pending the
Section 34 application, if no stay is granted, the applicant would be put to
irreparable loss and hardship, especially when the application has also been
made without any unreasonable delay.
19.Keeping in mind the ratio laid down by the Honorable Supreme
Court in the above discussed cases, I inclined to issue the following
directions:
(i) The applicant shall deposit Rs.75 crores of the award amount to the
credit of Arb.O.P.(Com.Div.)No.358 of 2024.
(ii) The applicant shall furnish security for Rs.25 crores.
11/13
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
(cid:12) (iii) Both clauses (i) and (ii) shall be complied on or before
17.02.2025.
(iv) Subject to condition of the aforesaid deposit and security being
furnished within the time frame stipulated herein above, there shall be an
order of interim stay on the enforcement of the Arbitral award dated
10.04.2024.
20.Post the matter on 17.02.2025 for reporting compliance.
