Patna High Court CWJC No.16628 of 2024(7) dt. 16-10-2025
4. In the year 1990, a criminal proceeding was initiated against the petitioner's husband in reference
to the allegations concerning irregularity in purchase of fallopian tube and accordingly, the
Vigilance case got instituted vide Vigilance Case No. 100/1992. The Department of Health decided
to initiate departmental enquiry against the petitioner's husband on the same allegation and,
accordingly, was placed under suspension vide office order issued under the signature of
Director-in-Chief, Health Services as contained in Memo no. 78 dated 25.10.1991.
5. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that Charge Memo was issued vide Memo no. 601(5)
dated 15.09.1991 and the departmental proceeding was undertaken as per the Rule 55 of
Classification, Control and Appeal Rules (for short 'CCA Rules') has initiated by appointing

Puspa Sinha vs The State Of Bihar on 16 October, 2025
7. Learned counsel for the petitioner next submits that the departmental proceeding was initiated
against the petitioner's husband under the provisions of 'CCA Rules' but after the retirement, the
said inquiry was never converted into under the Bihar Pension Rules and the inquiry as initiated
under the provisions of 'CCA Rules' automatically comes to an end in law on 30.11.2003. It has
further been submitted that in the departmental enquiry, the Enquiry Officer in a very casual and
routine manner, even without properly conducting the enquiry by offering opportunity of hearing
supported with the material documents, submitted enquiry report before the Disciplinary Authority,
i.e., the Director-in-Chief, Health Services and to Patna High Court CWJC No.16628 of 2024(7) dt.
16-10-2025 utter surprise, the Disciplinary authority acting upon the report of Enquiry Officer
issued second show-cause notice on 22.07.2004.
8. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that even without there being a full-fledged inquiry
having been carried out by the Enquiry Officer, where at no point of time, the Presenting Officer
ever appeared to present the case of the Department. Still, the enquiry report was prepared and the
Disciplinary Authority acted upon the same by completing the formalities of issuing second
show-cause notice to the petitioner's husband which was duly responded by indicating in the said
response that the procedures of conducting the Departmental Enquiry in terms of 'CCA Rules' or
under Bihar Pension Rules have been violated but the authorities without taking any notice to such
objections have proceeded to pass orders on the report so submitted by the Enquiry Officer. The
objection of the petitioner's husband showing grievance of non furnishing the requisite documents
as demanded was lastly accepted on repeated representations at the stage of second show-cause by
issuing a letter to the petitioner's husband on 08.09.2004, was only allowed to submit fresh
response but still no documents pertaining to the allegations levelled in the Memo Patna High Court
CWJC No.16628 of 2024(7) dt. 16-10-2025 of Charge was ever supplied even at the stage of second
show- cause, which would be apparent from the demand reiterated by the petitioner's husband in
his response submitted for consideration by the Disciplinary Authority.
9. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner was ultimately forced to move to
the Hon'ble Court, for getting the departmental enquiry concluded which was pending for a long
time and no order was being passed in the pending enquiry, by filing writ petition being CWJC No.
18334 of 2011 in which the Co-ordinate Bench passed the order dated 25.11.2011 admitting the said
application and directed the respondents to file counter affidavit in this case, which was later on
disposed of vide order dated 21.09.2022 reserving liberty to the petitioner to agitate any other
contentions raised in the petition in a pending litigation in which petitioner has assailed the order of
penalty.
10. It is in this background, the Disciplinary Authority-cum-Director-in-Chief, Health Services
recorded a finding that the relevant file connected with the allegations for which the charges have
been framed is not available and the action proposed for which the proceedings for holding the
petitioner' husband guilty of the charges which is said to have Patna High Court CWJC No.16628 of
2024(7) dt. 16-10-2025 been initiated in connection with the purchase of the Fallopian tube at the
instance of petitioner's husband could not be established, therefore, it may not be justified to
withhold the pension of the petitioner's husband and accordingly, opinion to this effect was
rendered by the Disciplinary Authority, who being Director-in-Chief, Health Services, Bihar vide

Puspa Sinha vs The State Of Bihar on 16 October, 2025
opinion dated 27.11.2012 (Annexure- P/5 to the writ petition).
11. Learned counsel for the petitioner next submits that after submission of the said opinion by the
Disciplinary Authority, the provisional pension which the petitioner's husband received till October,
2014, was suddenly stopped from 2014 and therefore, the petitioner's husband had to again knock
the door of Hon'ble Court by filing CWJC No. 2656 of 2015 praying inter alia for release of his
provisional pension, which was disposed of on 06.04.2015 directing the Disciplinary Authority, the
Director-in-Chief, Health Services to ensure that the amount of provisional pension of the
petitioner's husband from the month of November 2014 onwards be paid by way of arrears and
current pension within a period of one month from the date of receipt of the order with a further
direction given in respect of payment of gratuity amount by commanding the Director-in-Chief,
Health Services to pass Patna High Court CWJC No.16628 of 2024(7) dt. 16-10-2025 appropriate
order after obtaining the order of competent authorities and intimate the decision in respect of
payment of provisional pension to the petitioner's husband.
12. It has further been submitted that though the provisional pension of the petitioner was released
but the request made in terms of the direction issued in the aforesaid writ petition for payment of
gratuity was not dispose of and ultimately for not carrying out the order passed by the Co- ordinate
Bench in letters and spirit, the petitioner's husband had to file contempt petition being MJC No.
1870 of 2015. Learned counsel further submitted that in order to evade the contempt proceeding, a
show-cause was filed in the said contempt case annexing Memo No. 89 dated 25.01.2018, showing
consideration of claim of petitioner's husband for payment of gratuity on the basis of obsolete
Circular of the Finance Department dated 22.08.1974 and got the contempt case dropped. However,
the liberty was restored to the petitioner to take steps in accordance with law before the appropriate
forum against the order of department of Health as contained in Memo No. 536(5) dated
29.04.2019 which is said to have been passed during the pendency of the contempt petition.
13. Learned counsel for the petitioner next Patna High Court CWJC No.16628 of 2024(7) dt.
16-10-2025 submits that the petitioner was again compelled to challenge the order passed by the
Authority as contained in Memo No. 536(5) dated 29.04.2019 by filing appropriate Interlocutory
Application in the pending writ petition being CWJC No. 8830 of 2020 which was filed for
settlement of retiral dues and the same was disposed of by directing the authorities concerned to
take a final decision with respect to entitlement of the petitioner and to ensure payment of dues to
the petitioner in accordance with law considering the fact that the deceased employee had already
died on 16.02.2020 and he was superannuated from the post of Senior Statistical Assistant and the
widow of the deceased employee is aggrieved for non payment of retiral dues.
14. It is next submitted that petitioner filed a detailed representation for redressal of his grievances
by annexing relevant documents in support thereof, but no decision was taken in the said matter
and ultimately the petitioner was compelled to file contempt petition being MJC No. 457 of 2024
and while filing the show-cause, the authorities placed on record another order issued by the
Director-in-Chief, Health Services which is contained in Memo No. 517(12) dated 10.06.2024
whereby the claim of the petitioner for payment of retiral dues was rejected keeping the order of
punishment as inflicted Patna High Court CWJC No.16628 of 2024(7) dt. 16-10-2025 against the

Puspa Sinha vs The State Of Bihar on 16 October, 2025
petitioner's husband in terms of forfeiture of pension and on having placed such order dated
10.06.2024 by way of show-cause in the said contempt petition and the contempt petition was
disposed of vide order dated 02.08.2024 with a liberty to the petitioner to assail the same by
instituting appropriate proceeding.
15. It has further been submitted that the impugned order nowhere discloses as to in absence of the
said file, how the findings of the then Disciplinary Authority, where it has been stated that no
liability could have been legally fastened in absence of appropriate records, which aspect of the
matter is conspicuously absent and does not find any reference of the same with appropriate
consideration in the impugned order.
16. In this background, the present/instant writ petition has been filed in which the challenge to the
manner, the entire procedures for fastening the liability has been conducted is questioned and this
Court, on the basis of the materials available and submission made by the parties, vide order dated
19.09.2025 passed the following order:-
"Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that on conclusion of the departmental
enquiry, the enquiry report was submitted and the said report was Patna High Court
CWJC No.16628 of 2024(7) dt. 16-10-2025 examined by the Director-in-Chief,
Health Services after issuing show-cause notice and on consideration of the
show-cause notice as well as the materials forming part of the enquiry report, the
Director-in-Chief was of the view that no case of forfeiture of entire pension is made
out against the petitioner's husband. The said report which is prepared by the
Director-in-Chief is a detailed report appended with the writ petition as
Annexure-P/5.
2. Learned counsel for the petitioner next submits that the order contained in Memo
No. 517(12) dated 10.06.2024 (Annexure-P/9) is said to have been passed by the
officer of the same rank who being the Director-in-Chief, Health Services and without
recording any difference of opinion differing with the findings recorded by the
erstwhile Director-in-Chief who being the Disciplinary Authority in the case of
petitioner's husband, another order which is said to have been passed forfeiting 100%
of pension does not indicate the procedures adopted for differing the findings of
earlier Disciplinary Authority and it is also well settled in law that a person of same
rank could not have reviewed the findings of earlier incumbent who had recorded his
findings after giving due opportunity of hearing to the petitioner's husband while he
was alive.
3. From the order dated 10.06.2024 (Annexure-P/9) which is said to be a reasoned
order, does not indicate any reason showing recording of difference of opinion
providing opportunity of hearing to the petitioner's husband before passing the order
impugned whereby 100% of pension is directed to be forfeited. Patna High Court

Puspa Sinha vs The State Of Bihar on 16 October, 2025
4. Learned counsel for the petitioner next submits that when this order dated
10.06.2024 (Annexure-P/9) was passed by the Authorities, by then, the petitioner's
husband had already died and according to the petitioner, no hearing was ever
provided to him and such contention of the petitioner finds support from the recitals
of the order itself, where it has categorically been mentioned by the author of the said
impugned letter, who has recorded in the order that the petitioner's husband had
died on 16.02.2020, still no reason assigned for violating the principles of natural
justice and impugned order is said to have been passed.
5. For addressing on the legal issues raised in this case, learned counsel for the
respondents seeks a short accommodation.
6. Accordingly, post it on 26.09.2025 retaining its position in the list."
17. Learned counsel representing the State, pursuant to the order passed by this Court on
19.09.2025, has filed supplementary affidavit and in order to justify their action, has taken this
Court to paragraphs-6 and 7 of the counter affidavit filed in compliance thereof, which are
reproduced as under:-
"6. That it is stated and submitted that the then Director-in-Chief, Health services,
Bihar, Patna had only expressed his opinion on 27/11/2012 after hearing the
application submitted in reference to the second show cause notice based Patna High
Court CWJC No.16628 of 2024(7) dt. 16-10-2025 Shri Arun Kumar Sinha, retired
Statistical, Assistant, Health Department, in connection with the departmental
proceedings initiated against him and Inquiry report submitted by the Conducting
Officer on 10/06/2004.
7. That it is stated and submitted that finally the Health Department, Government of
Bihar considered the matter in totality and by order issued vide memo No. 536(5)
dated 29/04/2019, under signature of Under Secretary, Health Department, Bihar,
Patna, the Health Department, Bihar, Patna, the Disciplinary Authority, agreeing
with the findings and recommendation of the Conducting Officer, Shri C.K. Anil, the
then Additional Secretary, in the departmental proceedings conducted under the
relevant provisions of Rule 43 (B) of the Bihar Pension Rules, decides to deduct the
full pension/gratuity (100%) of Shri Arun Kumar Sinha, the then Senior Statistical
Assistant under the provisions of Rule 139 of the Bihar Pension Rules, 1950 for the
substantiated charges of serious nature."
18. From the stand so taken in the supplementary counter affidavit, pursuant to the legal questions
framed, it is quite evident that the legal questions, which emanate from the present impugned order,
wherein the first Patna High Court CWJC No.16628 of 2024(7) dt. 16-10-2025 legal infirmity which
is said to have been caused in the course of conducting the departmental inquiry, where the Memo
of Charge, has been served to the petitioner's husband without any material documents germane to
the allegations forming part of form 'K' in terms of provisions of the 'CCA Rules', and despite
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/147313946/ 6
Puspa Sinha vs The State Of Bihar on 16 October, 2025
opportunities having been provided to them during the course of hearing of this case, the
Respondent authorities have not come out with any materials to show that the documents in
support of the imputations so made in the Memo of Charge was ever produced/supplied to the
petitioner's husband enabling him to understand the charge and submit his bona fide response. The
respondents rather could not have been in a position to serve any such materials because there is a
specific finding recorded by the Director-in-Chief, Health Services, who being the Disciplinary
Authority vide its opinion rendered in the said inquiry dated 27.11.2012, after submission of the
inquiry report based on which provisional pensions was allowed, from the report, it is
unambiguously clear that the records pertaining to the purchase of Fallopian tubes were not
available with the Department and therefore, no imputation could have been fastened against the
petitioner's husband holding him liable in any matter and therefore, as per the opinion of the
Disciplinary Patna High Court CWJC No.16628 of 2024(7) dt. 16-10-2025 Authority with regard to
forfeiture of pension and other pensionary benefits was not found to be appropriate in law.
19. At this stage, while appreciating the submission of learned counsel for the petitioner as well as
the Respondents, this Court finds that the valuable rights of the petitioner's husband has been
violated and the questions which were framed to be answered by the Respondent-Authority on
19.09.2025, as to how the Disciplinary Authority who has passed the order impugned dated
10.06.2024 has assumed jurisdiction to review and sit over the findings of the Director- in-Chief,
who had exercised his power in the same capacity being the Disciplinary Authority of the petitioner's
husband.
20. From the materials available on record and after going through the contents of the impugned
order, it would be quite evident that the author of the impugned order dated 10.06.2024 has himself
recorded in its order that the petitioner's husband got died on 16.02.2020 and there is no
explanation as to how in absence of any supportive materials to the imputation made, for which
Memo of Charge is said to have been served, the findings to further punishment of forfeiture has
been arrived. While the Authority of the same rank, who being the Disciplinary Authority of the
petitioner's husband had once Patna High Court CWJC No.16628 of 2024(7) dt. 16-10-2025
recorded the finding that the records relating to the purchase is not available in the office and it
would not appropriate to hold the petitioner's husband liable without there being any material to
support the allegations.
21. In such background without answering to such legal questions, which were raised by the
Authority of the same jurisdiction, the new incumbent being the Director-in- Chief, Health Services,
in the same capacity has overlooked the same and without resorting to the procedures adopted for
recording difference of opinion as provided in law has reiterated the same nature of punishment,
which was earlier inflicted vide order as contained in Memo No. 536(5) dated 29.04.2019, and
giving a new outfit to the said punishment order by keeping it in the fresh office order dated
10.06.2024 is said to have been passed which is impugned in this case. But, the question remained
to be answered by the respondent authorities that whether the procedures as prescribed under the
'CCA Rules' was followed, while holding the petitioner's husband guilty of the charge as
incorporated in the Memo, which is appended in the writ petition as Annexure-P/2, to which there
is no justifiable reason said to have been assigned by the Respondents either in the impugned order
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/147313946/ 7
Puspa Sinha vs The State Of Bihar on 16 October, 2025
or even have indicated such by Patna High Court CWJC No.16628 of 2024(7) dt. 16-10-2025 filing
further counter affidavit or even the supplementary affidavit dated 26.09.2025 to satisfy this Court,
which is said to have been filed pursuant to the order dated 19.09.2025 passed in this case.
22. Considering the aforesaid, this Court is of the opinion that the valuable rights of the petitioner's
husband has been violated and the conclusion drawn to fasten the guilt based on which the
consequential impugned punishment has been passed without any evidence and the same is
completely in derogation of law laid down in the case of Union of India v. H.C. Goel; (1964) 4 SCR
718, wherein it was held that the conclusion drawn to fasten the guilt must be based on cogent
evidence and in absence of such evidence to support the conclusion of guilt cannot be sustained in
law. Since the conclusion drawn to issue impugned punishment of forfeiture is contrary to the
provisions of 'CCA Rules' and as also based on no evidence, therefore, the order of forfeiture of
100% of pension and gratuity as contained in Memo No. 517(12) dated 10.06.2024 upholding the
order as contained in Memo No. 536(5) dated 29.04.2019 is wholly without jurisdiction and is
unsustainable in law and accordingly, the same is set aside. Since, the original petitioner has already
died as is apparent Patna High Court CWJC No.16628 of 2024(7) dt. 16-10-2025 from the impugned
order, therefore, there is no question of remanding the matter for proceeding afresh from the stage
of defect as is found to have occasioned in this case.
23. Consequently, the Respondent No.3 (the Director-in-Chief, Health Services, Health Department,
Govt. of Bihar, Patna) is directed to pay all consequential benefits including the entire pensionary
benefits with full amount of gratuity to the widow (petitioner) of the deceased employee within a
period of three months from the date of communication/production of a copy of this order, failing
which, the petitioner shall be entitled for Rs. 25,000/- towards the cost of litigation.
24. The instant writ petition stands allowed.
