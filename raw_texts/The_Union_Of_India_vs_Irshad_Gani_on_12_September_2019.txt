CORAM: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE
and
HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE ASHUTOSH KUMAR
ORAL JUDGMENT
(Per: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE ASHUTOSH KUMAR) Date : 12-09-2019 Heard the learned
counsel for the parties. In all the writ petitions, the Union of India is the petitioner. The challenge is
to the order passed in O.As. whereby the termination order of the respondents have been stayed till
the final disposal of the original application preferred by them.
From the records, it appears that the respondents were appointed as GDSMP at different branches
of the Post- Office but without observing the due procedure for their Patna High Court CWJC
No.18459 of 2019 dt.12-09-2019 appointment. On a complaint made by one of the applicants /
aspirants, the irregularity in the appointment process of the respondents was unearthed and taking
resort to the provisions contained in Section 8 (2) of the Gramin Dak Sevak (Conduct and
Engagement) Rules, 2011 (hereinafter called "the rules"), the services of the respondents were
terminated.
It further appears that challenge was made before the Tribunal by the respondents against such
orders of termination on the ground that they were not noticed and that the termination order was
not passed under Section 8(2) of the Act but only on the direction of the Superintendent of Post,
who was neither the appointing nor the recruiting authority. Since the order of termination was sent
for approval to the Superintendent of Post, the Tribunal perhaps suspected that something else had

The Union Of India vs Irshad Gani on 12 September, 2019
worked behind the termination of the services of the respondents. The matter was to be finally heard
by the Tribunal but in the interregnum, by the orders impugned, the order of termination has been
stayed.
Learned counsel for the Union of India has assailed the aforesaid interim orders by the Tribunal on
several Patna High Court CWJC No.18459 of 2019 dt.12-09-2019 grounds, but primarily on the
reason that an order of termination cannot be stayed and that such an order amounts to finally
disposing off the original application mid-way. The facts of the matter, it has been urged, were not
brought to the notice of the Tribunal and that the same Presiding Officer, in cases of similar nature,
while sitting in the Ranchi Bench had approved the termination of such employees under Section 8
(2) of the rules.
Section 8 (2) of the Gramin Dak Sevak (Conduct and Engagement) Rules, 2011, referred to above, is
being extracted hereinbelow for the sake of completeness:
"8. Termination of Engagement (1) The engagement of a Sevak who has not already
rendered more than three years' continuous service from the date of his engagement
shall be liable to be terminated at any time by a notice in writing given either by the
Sevak to the Recruiting Authority or by the Recruiting Authority to the Sevak;
Patna High Court CWJC No.18459 of 2019 dt.12-09-2019 (2) The period of such notice shall be one
month:
Provided that the service of any such Sevak may be terminated forthwith and on such
termination, the Sevak shall be entitled to claim a sum equivalent to the amount of
Basic Time Related Continuity Allowance plus Dearness Allowance as admissible for
the period of the notice at the termination of his service, or, as the case may be, for
the period by which such notice falls short of one month.
Note:- Were the intending effect of such termination has to be immediate, it should
be mentioned that one month's Time Related Continuity Allowance plus Dearness
Allowance as admissible is being remitted to the Sevak in lieu of notice of one month
through money order."
The services of an employee / Dak Sevak can be terminated forthwith and on such
termination, the concerned Patna High Court CWJC No.18459 of 2019 dt.12-09-2019
Dak Sevak would only be entitled to claim a sum equivalent to the amount of Basic
Time Related Continuity Allowance along with Dearness Allowance as admissible for
the period of the notice which is one month at the termination of his service or for the
period for which such notice falls short of one month.
It has been pointed out to this Court that after the order of termination, the
respondents have already been relieved.

In that view of the matter, the Tribunal ought not to have stayed the order and should
have proceeded ahead to decide the Original Applications finally.
Considering this aspect of the matter, we are of the considered view that the order
impugned in the present set of petitions, whereby the Union of India has been
directed not to implement the impugned orders of termination, is not sustainable in
the eyes of law and the same are therefore required to be and are set aside.
The Tribunal would be under an obligation to decide the Original Applications of the
concerned respondents within a reasonable period of time.
Patna High Court CWJC No.18459 of 2019 dt.12-09-2019 All the writ petitions are
disposed off accordingly with the aforesaid directions / observations.
