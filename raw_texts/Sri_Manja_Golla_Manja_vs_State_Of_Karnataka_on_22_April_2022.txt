PRONOUNCED THE FOLLOWING:

ORDER
The following observations of Hon'ble Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer in the case of MOHAMMAD
GIASUDDIN vs. STATE OF ANDHRA PRADESH1 should prelude this judgment:
"...Criminality is a curable deviance. The morality of the law may vary, but is real. The
basic goodness of all human beings is a spiritual axiom, a fall-out of the advaita of
cosmic creation and the spring of correctional thought in criminology...If every saint
has a past, every sinner has a future, and it is the role of law to remind both of this.
The Indian legal genius of old has made a healthy contribution to the world treasury
of criminology. The drawback of our criminal process is that often they are built on
the bricks of impressionist opinions and dated values, ignoring empirical studies and
deeper researches....India, like every other country, has its own crime complex and
dilemma of punishment. Solutions to tangled social issues do not come like the crack
of dawn but are the product of research and study, oriented on the founding faiths of
society and driving towards that transformation which is the goal of free India..."
All these petitions involving similar questions of law & facts essentially pertain to 'Rowdy Sheeting'
and 'History Sheeting'. After service of notice, the respondent - State having entered appearance
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103716906/ 18

through the learned Additional Government Advocate, has filed its Statement of Objections resisting
the petitions. A few police officials rich in experience and talented too participated in these
proceedings and thereby, appreciably contributed to the decision making process.

& W.P No. 23902/2021 seek a Writ of Certiorari for quashing endorsements/communications
whereby their names are loaded to the 'rowdy register'. Petitioners in W.P No. 14399/2020, W.P No.
14022/2021, W.P No.15696/2021, W.P No. 15708/2021, W.P No. 19880/2021, W.P No. 17538/2021
& W.P No. 23902/2021 seek a Writ of Mandamus for producing particulars of entries in the 'Rowdy
Register'. Petitioners in W.P No. 14566/2021 and 18632/2021 have sought for a Writ of Prohibition
and a Declaration respectively. Even their grievance, presumably is as to the legality of continuation
of their names in the 'Rowdy Register'.
III. CONTENTIONS OF PARTIES:
(i) Petitioners inter alia argue that there exists no discernable
procedure for entering of their names to the Rowdy Registers maintained in the jurisdictional police
stations and that there is no procedural & substantive safeguarding of victims of rowdy sheeting,
which has many implications on their liberty, privacy & reputation. Mindless rowdy sheeting
violates their fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14, 19, 21, & 22 of the Constitution. In
support of their submission, they rely upon comparative study material of Criminal Records
Information obtained from foreign jurisdictions like Australia, Canada, U.S. & U.K. They press into
service the following decisions: K.S PUTTASWAMY vs. UNION OF INDIA2, KHARAK SINGH vs.
STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH3, DHANJI RAM SHARMA vs. SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE4,
GOBIND vs. STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH5, MALAK SINGH vs. STATE OF PUNJAB &
HARYANA6, PEOPLE'S UNION FOR CIVIL LIBERTIES vs. UNION OF INIDA7, BHAVESH
JAYANTI LAKHANI vs. STATE OF MAHARASHTRA8, R.G SOMASHEKAR GOWDA vs. THE
COMMISSIONER OF POLICE9 and KAZIA MOHAMMED MUZZAMMIL vs. SUPERINTENDENT
OF POLICE10.
(ii) Respondent - State, per contra, contends that rowdy sheeting has been a necessary practice since
Colonial Days and it is managed by police officials with expertise and due restraint; there is enough

Sri Manja @ Golla Manja vs State Of Karnataka on 22 April, 2022
justification for 'institutionalized rowdy sheeting' since it is essential for maintaining law & order
and peace & tranquillity in an organized society. Sufficient substantive & procedural safeguards are
put in place; victims 2 (2017) 10 SCC 1 3 AIR 1963 SC 1295 4 AIR 1966 SC 1766 5 (1975) 2 SCC 148 6

1735 can avail the facility of grievance redressal mechanism. There is an 'institutionalized in-house
procedure' in the Police Department. After all, rowdy sheeting or history sheeting is not a punitive
measure and therefore no indulgence of Writ Court is warranted. In support of their stand, they
bank upon the following decisions: K.M MUNISWAMY REDDY vs. STATE OF KARNATAKA11,
DEPUTY INSPECTOR GENERAL OF POLICE vs. S. SAMUTHIRAM12, STATE OF KARNATAKA vs.

STATE OF KARNATAKA15and M.J SIVANI vs. STATE OF KARNATAKA16.
(iii) On request of the Court, learned Amicus Curiae, Mr. Sridhar Prabhu had appreciably
undertaken a comparative study of Criminal Information Practices prevalent in our country, and in
the United States & United Kingdom. A more local comparison was also made by referring to
'Maintenance of Police Station Records by Delhi Police'. This apart, various international
Conventions such as UNIVERSAL DECLERATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS (1948), EUROPEAN
CONVENTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS (1953) & CHARTER OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF THE
EUROPEAN UNION (2000) are cited. He also pressed into service the following decisions: VIJAY
NARAIN SINGH vs. 11 ILR 1992 KAR 2543 12 (2013) 1 SCC 598 13 (2004) 4 SCC 684 14 (2020) 16

S.G. JAISINGHANI vs. UNION OF INDIA19, SHAYARA BANO vs. UNION OF INDIA20 and WOLF
vs. COLORADO21.
IV. I have heard learned counsel appearing for the parties & learned Amicus Curiae. I have perused
the Petition Papers and adverted to the rulings cited at the Bar:
(a) These cases involve the following four categories broadly made on the basis of the
due process of rowdy sheeting, periodical suo motu review, review on representation
of aggrieved and absence of review despite representation. A Tabular Representation
of the categories is as under:
(a) Cases in which rowdy sheeting is done absolutely without any basis;
(b) Cases in which periodical suo motu review of rowdy sheets has not been done, in
regular course;
(c) Cases in which review of rowdy sheets has not been undertaken despite
representation and;
(d) Cases in which rowdy sheeting is continued beyond reasonable period sans
justification.

(b) Policing by its very nature, is a tough job whichever be the jurisdictions and
whatever be the cultural & educational levels of the society concerned. In a society
like ours it is even more complex, regard being had to a plurality of factors. Policing
essentially involves exercise of sovereign power of State having
16 (1995) 6 SCC 289 17 AIR 1984 SC 1334 18 (1972)1 SCC 240 19 (1967) 2 SCR 703 20 (2017) 9 SCC
1 21 (1948) 338 U.S. 25 implications on rights & liberties of individuals. Without policing one cannot
conceive of law & order and peace & tranquillity in an organised society. Paradoxically, police are, in
a sense, an unwelcome guest. However, their indispensability needs no proof. Policing, regardless of
its enormous social utility continues to be a thankless job. Ours is the governance limited by
Constitution. Police being the officials of the State do not enjoy immunity from constitutional
control and more particularly Part IIII discipline. It needs to be stated that the vitality of
fundamental rights has been enhanced by virtue of several international conventions such as United
Nations Declaration on Human Rights (1948), International Convention on Civil and Political
Rights (1966) and the like in the light of decisions in KESAVANANDA22, JOLLY GEORGE
VERGHESE vs. BANK OF COCHIN23 and VISHAKA vs. STATE OF RAJASTHAN24.
(c) The word 'Police' figures in Entry 2, List II of VII Schedule of the Constitution subject to Entry
2A, of the List I, vide 42nd Amendment with effect from 03.01.1977. Several States have enacted law
in respect of this subject. This State too has done it vide the Karnataka Police Act, 1963. A few sets of
Rules have been promulgated by the State Government, being the statutory delegate under the Act.
The Karnataka Police Manual, 1965 (hereinafter 'Manual') is one of them. The Manual comprises of
a 22 AIR 1973 SC 1461 23 1980 SCR (2) 913 set of subordinate legislations nomenclatured as
'Orders', and they are held to have statutory force vide K.M.MUNISWAMY supra. Some of these
orders regulate inter alia surveillance and Rowdy Sheeting/History Sheeting. Police have to exercise
this power subject to the Fundamental Rights, that are no longer 'water-tight compartments'25. The
scope, efficacy & interplay of these rights have been expanding precedent by precedent, hardly needs
to be mentioned. Such expansion more particularly in the realm of privacy jurisprudence warrants a
new approach to the subject matter.
(d) No reasonable person can deny that citizens seek protection of their rights & liberties more than
ever before, banking upon constitutional guarantees. Conversely, the State functionaries claim more
authority to restrict the rights & liberties of the citizens, as of necessity and in the larger public
interest. This has been the case all throughout and the conflict goes on, whatever be the
jurisdictions. The Writ Courts being the custodians of the Constitution have to balance these
competing claims, keeping in view all pragmatic considerations. This is where the following
observations of the Apex Court in MALAK SINGH vs. STATE OF PUNJAB, supra become
instructive:
"...Section 23 of the Police Act prescribes it as the duty of police officers to collect and
communicate
24 AIR 1997 SC 3011 25 MANEKA GANDHI V. UNION OF INDIA, (1978) 1 SCC 248 intelligence
affecting the public peace, to prevent the commission of offences and public nuisance. In connection
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103716906/ 21
Sri Manja @ Golla Manja vs State Of Karnataka on 22 April, 2022
with these duties it will be necessary to keep discreet surveillance over reputed bad characters,
habitual offenders and other potential offenders...but surveillance may be intrusive and it may be so
seriously encroach on the privacy of a citizen as to infringe his fundamental right to personal liberty
guaranteed under article 21 of the Constitution and the freedom of movement guaranteed by Article
19(1)(d)...permissible surveillance is only to the extent of a close watch over the movement of
persons under surveillance and no more..." V. A BRIEF HISTORY OF 'HISTORY SHEETS' &
'ROWDY SHEETS':
(i) As a prelude to the historical inquiry, it would be profitable to recall the words of
Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes26:
"...The law embodies the story of a nation's development through many centuries,
and it cannot be dealt with as if it contained only the axioms and corollaries of a book
of mathematics. In order to know what it is, we must know what it has been, and
what it tends to become. We must alternately consult history and existing theories of
legislation..."
Since the focal point is 'rowdy/history sheeting' and allied matters, it is pertinent to retrace the
historical origin of said practice, '...one gains the sense of an epic movement unifying the legal
process, - the picture and promise of a plot majestically unfolding itself amid all the interludes and
diversions - when one reads the history...'27. For the present, this Court limits the 26The Common
Law, (1881) 27 Benjamin N. Cardozo, The Paradoxes of Legal Science, Columbia University Press 18
- 19, (1928) inquiry to the emergence of said practice during the 19th & 20th centuries, when we
were under the Colonial Rule. To contextualise this discussion, it would be profitable to note the
following words of TOM LLOYD28 from the University of Edinburgh:
"In their attempts to constitute a particular kind of authority over bandits in early
colonial India, British Administrators of the East India Company were moved to
legislate against what they perceived as certain extraordinary criminal groups,
defined by the alleged secrecy of their operations and the fundamental irrationality of
their cause, which was figured as merciless depredation...'Thug' was the name given
to a figure located beyond the pale of 'civil' society, and held to be a member of a
community of 'irreclaimable' predators upon it, who could not be socialised into
conventional law...Through policing, this defining and controlling, they characterized
(and indeed caricatured) not only those individuals who would henceforth be
considered non-subjects to which ordinary procedures of British administration
would not apply - dacoits and thugs..."
(ii) In light of the above, the identification of categories of 'thugs' paved the way for innovative and
extra-judicial mechanisms for dealing with the rowdy elements. The 'Anti Thuggee Campaign'
provided to Governor General Bentinck's administration by Captain William Sleeman sought to deal
with the systematic and lurking menace that until now escaped justice by exploiting the margins of
Civil and State authority. Though the campaign was pursued for colonial security, it was undertaken
with overtones of 'duty' for the good of hapless society. An instance of such an approach is evident
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103716906/ 22
Sri Manja @ Golla Manja vs State Of Karnataka on 22 April, 2022
from judicial reforms introduced by Warren Hastings in 1772 whereby Article 35 of the Regulating
Act provided that bandits would be executed and their families would become 'slaves of the state'.29
However, much of this was not put to implementation. Hastings had said30:
"...the dacoits of Bengal are not, like the robbers in England, individuals driven to
such desperate course by sudden want: they are robbers by profession, and even by
birth; they are formed into regular communities, and their families subsist by the
spoils which they bring home to them: they are all, therefore, alike, criminal
wretches, who have placed themselves in a state of declared war with our
Government, and are therefore wholly excluded from any benefit of its laws..."
A Dacoit was not simply set outside the law, but rather abandoned by it. Discretion of the colonial
powers was the sole determinant as to whether the individual was to be protected by the law or
exempted from it. The bandit existed in a state of bare life in relation to the sovereign power that
banished him by branding.
(iii) The Criminal Tribes Act of 187131 enacted on the principle of 'hereditary criminality' is one such
example where Colonial powers drew up a list of certain Indian communities and branded them as
criminal tribes in a wholesale way. While the Act to be 28 Tom Lloyd, 'Thuggee' and the Margins of
the State in Early Nineteenth - Century Colonial India (2008) 29 M.P Jain, 'Outlines of Indian Legal
& Constitutional History', 56-57, 6th Edition, (2006) 30 Id.
repealed (1952) and tribes 'de-notified', the harrowing affects of such measure are still felt.32 The
words of PARAMA ROY 33 further elucidate upon the approach employed by Colonial Powers:
"...With all the discrepant valences of this discourse, one factor remained crucial in
the determination of thuggee: the idea of hereditary criminality...the dacoits of
Bengal were strenuously and repeatedly characterized...as fulfilling a hereditary
calling if not a genetic disposition..."
What MRINAL SATISH34 in his article writes as follows is also pertinent:
"...three categories of persons over whom the police in colonial times kept a constant
watch: first, the so-called 'criminal tribes'; secondly, the so- called goondas and
thirdly, the so called 'bad characters'...the third category of persons who were kept
under surveillance by the British were 'bad characters'...police maintained lists of
people they termed as bad characters and profiled based on their appearances. The
'bad characters' did not have to be convicted to make their way into the police lists.
Mere suspicion or apprehension that the individual would commit the crime or be an
inconvenience to the police was sufficient to warrant an entry. Every stereotype that
the British had sought to reinforce about people being born criminals was put to
practice in making the lists...People from the family of a convicted person
automatically found themselves on the list. Individual on these lists were kept under
surveillance to ensure that they did not commit any crimes..."

Parties: Concluding observations of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination,
U.N. Doc. CERD/C/IND/CO/19 33 'Discovering India Imagining Thuggee.' The Yale Journal of
Criticism, 121- 145, Volume 9(1), (1996).
34 Mrinal Satish, 'Bad Characters, History Sheeters, Budding Goondas and Rowdies': Police
Surveillance Files and Intelligence Databases in India, (2010).
(iv) The use of 'rowdy sheets' may find direct lineage to the precept of 'goondas'. The word 'goonda'
is reported to have been first used in the Bengal Goonda Act of 1926. It defined a goonda to include
a 'hooligan or other rough.' The 'goondas' included people with prior convictions, people suspected
of committing offences and political activists. The Act required the Police to maintain files of
goondas in their jurisdictions. Other States too have Goonda Acts as well, which inter alia provide
for externment of goondas by following a kind of quasi-judicial procedure which then did not
approximate to 'due process'. Order 1059 of the Police Manual defines 'a rowdy' as a goonda and
includes a hooligan, rough, vagabond or any other person, who is dangerous to the public peace and
tranquillity. The observations of a Co-ordinate Bench of this court in R.G SOMASHEKAR GOWDA
vs. COMMISSIONER OF POLICE, supra are illustrative of this genealogy:
"An extensive definition has been used to define the expression 'rowdy'. Thus, a
'rowdy' is a 'goonda' and includes a hooligan, rough, vagabond, or any other person
who is dangerous to the public peace and tranquillity. Only the main forms of
rowdyism are enumerated in Clause (2) of Order 1059...Needless to say that a goonda
as defined in the Goondas Act is also a rowdy."
The Apex Court in DHANJI RAM SHARMA vs. SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE, supra held that
persons reasonably believed to be habitually addicted to crime (aiding or abetting) is a condition
precedent for opening of a 'History Sheet'. This inference of one filling that character ought to be
drawn on reasonable grounds. The word 'habitually' would ordinarily mean 'repeatedly' or
'persistently'. A person thus should be in the 'habit' of exhibiting criminal instinct vide VIJAY
NARAIN SINGH vs. STATE OF BIHAR. A 'History Sheeter' is thus, a habitual offender, accustomed
to leading a life of crime. Ordinarily, a 'History Sheet' can be opened on conviction (Order 1054),
although acquitted from criminal charge per se may not result in his name being deleted therefrom.
(v) There exists a certain difference both in terms of substance and form of practice between a
History Sheet and a Rowdy Sheet: The former is confined to persons against whom some crime was
registered by the Police or some criminal case was instituted before Court or authority, regardless of
the nature of their outcome. However, in the latter, there is no such precondition/requirement. In
other words, a rowdy sheeter may be a person of clean slate insofar as criminal proceedings are
concerned. The underlying purpose in both the cases is broadly the same. Arguably 'History
Sheeters' and 'Rowdy Sheeters' are different. The only discernable elements of a 'rowdy sheeter' are
provided under Order 1059(1) & (2) which reads as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103716906/ 24
Sri Manja @ Golla Manja vs State Of Karnataka on 22 April, 2022
"1059 (1) a rowdy may be defined as a goonda and includes a hooligan, tough,
vagabond, or any other person who is dangerous to the public peace and
tranquillity.(2) The main forms of rowdyism are:-(a) passing indecent remarks at
women and Schools and College Girls; (b) Intimidation of law abiding people by acts
of violence or by show of force or by abusive language; (c) Forcible collection of
subscription; (d) Taking sides in petty quarrels between landlords and tenants or
between co- tenants and threatening people of the opposite party; (e) Disorderly
conduct; (f) Rioting; (g) Snatching and Committing robbery."
Chapter XXI, Part VI, of the Police Manual provides for 'History Sheets' and 'Register of Rowdies';
certain provisions are made common to both. Illustratively, Order 1057 states that History Sheets
can only be opened for a period of two years and extension can take place upon the order of Superior
Police officer. Clause (3) of 1057 applies the same to 'rowdy sheets' as well. Further, definition of a
rowdy implies any person dangerous to public peace & tranquillity. For example, eve teasers, people
who collected money, persons indulging in rioting, goondas, bootleggers, and land grabbers would
all come under the definition of 'rowdy'. To keep a watch on such persons a 'register of rowdies' is
maintained in every Police Station. For entering of names in the rowdy register order of the
Superintendent of Police/Sub Divisional Police Office is required.
(vi) In every Police Station, as a matter of statutory policy 'Register of Rowdies' has to be maintained
in three parts, viz, Part A containing names of persons who are residing in the jurisdictional limits of
the Police Station or Locals who are confirmed rowdies; Part B containing names of confirmed
rowdies whose activities occur in a Police Station but are resident in the jurisdiction of other Police
Stations or non - locals who are confirmed rowdies; Part C containing names of novices or persons
who have started coming to notice or are budding rowdies. Order 1059(12) provides that the name
of a person figuring in Part C would be struck off if no adverse conduct on his part is noticed for a
period of one year, reckoned from the date of entry. For removal of names from Part A or B, the
orders of Superintendent of Police are required. Further, Order 1059(15) provides the manner in
which a 'rowdy' may be dealt with, i.e., prosecution, externment proceedings, or the like.
VI. COMPARATIVE VIEW:
Learned counsel appearing for the petitioners and the learned amicus curiae drew the attention of
Court to the corresponding enactments and practices obtaining in other jurisdictions. Their perusal
in profitable.
A. IN UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:
(i) History sheets obtaining in India broadly correspond to a
Record of Arrest and Detention (hereinafter 'RAP Sheet') wherein all prior criminal antecedents of
persons are recorded. For example, the contents of a RAP sheet include, a unique record number,
date of arrest, particulars of the person, warrants issued, docket number, court of prosecution,
details of disposal of case, details of incarceration and whether the case has been sealed.

(ii) Each State has its own procedures and guidelines for registering to and expunging names from
the record; in New York the Division of Criminal Justice Service (DCJS) collects and distributes RAP
Sheet information & allied matters. Similarly, in California, the Department of Justice (DOJ) does
this. However, each instance has sufficient safeguards & procedures in terms of correction of
information, representation for sealing of cases and procedure for expungement of names or
particulars. Added, the U.S Supreme Court in US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE vs. REPORTERS
COMMITTEE FOR FREEDOM OF THE PRESS35 unanimously held that disclosure of
information/contents of RAP sheets to third parties offends privacy & autonomy of an individual,
that are constitutionally provided and Congressionally protected.
B. IN UNITED KINGDOM:
(i) In UK, criminal data is entered into consolidated data
bases, i.e., Police National Computer ('PNC') for information regarding convictions, cautions,
reprimands, warnings & arrests and Police National Database ('PND') for information such as
investigation, etc. The entries made in the PNC are regulated by Chief Constables; such a provision
corresponds to the prevalent practice of entering of names into a Register of Rowdies with the prior
permission of the Superintendent of 35 489 U.S. 749 (1989) Police, in our system. However, there is
no existing mechanism for expunging or sealing of criminal records.
(ii) For deletion of entries from the record, a written representation is to be made to the
jurisdictional Chief Constable in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the National Police
Chiefs' Council ('NPCC'). Interestingly, persons convicted by a court and persons currently under
investigation are not eligible for making representation for deletion. The Rehabilitation of Offenders
Act, 1974, provides that reprimands and warnings become 'spent' after duration of time; once so
spent the obligation to disclose also fades. Since May 2013, old and minor convictions are liable to
be removed from the PNC databases.
C. IN CANADA:
In Canada, the Criminal Records Act, 1985 is enacted for suspension of the records of persons who
have been convicted of offences and have been subsequently rehabilitated themselves. The Parole
Board of Canada has the exclusive jurisdiction over such matters. The Act at clause (4.1), sub -
clause (3) lays down the factors for determining whether ordering the record suspension would
bring about the administration of justice. The relevant portions of the said clause are profitably
reproduced as under:
"(3) In determining whether ordering the record suspension would bring the
administration of justice into dispute, the Board may consider
(a) The nature, gravity and duration of offence;
(b) The circumstances surrounding the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103716906/ 26
Sri Manja @ Golla Manja vs State Of Karnataka on 22 April, 2022
commission of offence;
(c) Information relating to the applicants
criminal history and, in the case of service offence, to any service offence history of
the applicant that is relevant to the application; and
(d) Any factor that is prescribed by regulation."
Further, the enactment of clause (4.2), sub - clause (4) also provides that an applicant may not make
a representation until expiry of one year from when request for suspension of criminal record has
been rejected. Revocation of suspension on cogent factors is also provided for at clause 7.
D. IN AUSTRALIA:
The Australian Federal Police records and collects a database with regard to criminal records of
individuals. The Criminal Records Act, 1991 enacted to ensure that conviction for minor offences,
when the person has spent a certain time period as 'crime - free', the conviction is to be considered
as spent, not forming a part of an individual's criminal history. This apart, the Privacy Act, 1988
protects the criminal record information of individuals.
VII. ROWDY/HISTORY SHEETING: MARCH OF LAW IN BRIEF
(i) Before addressing the points for consideration as articulated above, it is necessary to survey the
law that has been shaped by the judicial process. In N. VENKATACHALAPATHY vs. STATE OF
KARNATAKA36, a Co- ordinate Bench of this Court traced the provision for preparation of a 'rowdy
sheet' to Order 1059 of the Mysore Police Manual, 1965 pointing out that though there was no
statutory basis for said Order, it merely has the character of executive or departmental instruction.
Subsequently, a Division Bench of this Court in K.M MUNISWAMY REDDY vs. STATE OF
KARNATAKA supra considered its constitutionality and upheld its validity & statutory nature,
observing that: "...Order 1059 has statutory force made by the Inspector General of Police under
Section 21 of the Karnataka Police Act, 1963..."
(ii) This above case was followed by DEVADAS DEVAIAH VS. STATE OF KARNATAKA37, disposed
off on 27.09.1999 wherein the Court held that a 'rowdy sheet' can only be opened if the grounds
enumerated in Order 1059 were forthcoming and that they may not be opened against whom merely
a criminal case is registered. Next, another Division Bench of this court in KAZIA MOHAMMED
MUZZAMMILL vs. SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE, supra held that the 'register of rowdies' is a
confidential document meant only for the use of Police for maintaining surveillance or keeping a
watchful eye on persons suspected to cause disharmony in the community. Similarly, the Delhi
Court 36 ILR 1988 KAR 1261 in SARJEET SINGH vs. COMMISSIONER OF POLICE38 while
considering the opening of a history sheet, at paragraph 10 & 11 observed as under:
"...The Supreme Court in the case of Malak Singh vs. State of Punjab had gone into
this controversy and answered the question holding that the said principle that a
person must be given an opportunity of being heard will not be applicable in case of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103716906/ 27
Sri Manja @ Golla Manja vs State Of Karnataka on 22 April, 2022
history sheeters and surveillance register. The enquiry was held to be confidential
and the said principle of natural justice excluded..."
The High Court of Andhra Pradesh too while considering similar aspects in SUNKARA
SATYANARAYANA vs. STATE OF ANDHRA PRADESH39 observed as under:
"...(4) Scope of Judicial Review of Police Action vis- a-vis History Sheet/Rowdy
Sheet: (4.1) A mere conviction or convictions cannot be a thumb rule for opening
history sheets or rowdy sheets though history sheet can be opened even without
convictions for the limited purpose of watching a person discreetly. (4.2) At the time
of opening of history sheet or rowdy sheet a competent officer has to apply mind
taking into consideration the social background, the proceedings in the criminal trial
if a person is convicted and all other relevant material before passing orders for
opening history sheet or rowdy sheet..."
(iii) A Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in the case of MANI BHARATHI vs. STATE OF
KARNATAKA40 disposed off on 13.06.2008 observed that ordinarily if no adverse conduct is noted,
for about a year or so, the entry in the Register of Rowdies has to be struck off. Any discretion has to
be exercised 38 2002 CriLJ 3824 39 2000 (1) ALD (Crl.) 117 (A.P) 40 Writ Petition No. 6011/2007
c/w Writ Petition No. 6012/2007 in accordance with the rules of reason and justice, said Lord
Halsbury41 more than a century ago. The case of R.G SOMASHEKAR GOWDA vs.
COMMISSIONER OF POLICE, supra held that a 'rowdy' is a 'goonda' and that the meaning assigned
in analogous statutes such as The Goonda's Act, 198542 may aid interpretation of the provisions of
Order 1059, that are aimed at maintaining public peace and for preventing public nuisance.
Similarly, the case of SRI N.G. RAMACHANDRA vs. SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE 43 disposed
off on 28.02.2013 noted that though the history recorded in the rowdy register points towards
involvement of an individual in disruptive activities, 30 years having since passed, his 'life-boat'
apparently having undergone reformation, his name ought to be removed from the Rowdy Register.
(iv) In DOMLUR SREENIVAS REDDY vs. STATE OF KARNATAKA44 disposed off on 13.08.2014, a
Co-ordinate Bench of this Court held that the State having failed to produce any material to connect
the acts of the petitioner to the grounds enumerated in Order 1059, and there being no justification
for making an adverse entry in the Rowdy Register. The case of GANESAN vs. DISTRICT
SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE45 held 41 SHARP vs. WAKEFIELD (1891) A.C 173 42 The
Karnataka Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers, Drug Offenders, Gamblers, Goondas,
Immoral Trafficking Offenders and Slum Grabbers Act, 1985 45 2010 (6) CTC 507 that 'History
Sheets' should not be made mechanically and on permanent basis, change being the constant, in the
life of any individual. The observations of the court are profitably reproduced below:
"...The discretion conferred on the Police is both objective and subjective in nature.
Objective satisfaction with reference to the conduct of the History sheeted person, to
prevent commission or aiding or abetting of offences, by such persons, involving
breach of law and order. The subjective satisfaction should be based on valid
materials and it cannot be on the whims and fancies of the Police Officers. Reading of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103716906/ 28
Sri Manja @ Golla Manja vs State Of Karnataka on 22 April, 2022
the Police Standing Order shows that the discretion conferred on the Police Officers
is in-built, subject to limitations, including a specific period, provided under the said
orders and is not for an unlimited period, unless the conduct of the History sheeted
person is required to be monitored continuously..."
VIII. AS TO WHAT EMERGES FROM THE RULINGS ABOVE MENTIONED :
Before adverting to the marked characteristics, the observations of Brandies, J. in the
case of ADAMS vs. TANNER46 assumes importance:
"...Whether a measure relating to the public welfare is arbitrary or unreasonable,
whether it has no substantial relation to the end proposed, is obviously not to be
determined by assumptions or by a priori reasoning. The judgment should be based
upon a consideration of relevant facts, actual or possible -- ex facto jus oritur. That
ancient rule must prevail in order that we may have a system of living law..."
46 244 U.S. 590 (1917) From the perusal of the decisions mentioned in the preceding paragraphs,
the following broad propositions can be articulated:
i) Order 1059 of the Police Manual partakes statutory character and its provisions
answer the wide the wide definition of law given under Article 13(2) of the
Constitution and therefore, the validity of action taken by the Police thereunder
merits normative examination at the hands of higher ups in the department.
ii) A 'Rowdy Sheet' may be opened and maintained when there is material to form a
reasonable belief that the individual concerned has the propensity to disrupt
harmony & peace in the society. Order 1059(10) provides for such a requirement.
However, rowdy sheeting can only be done in regard to the grounds enumerated under Order
1059(1) & (2). This apart, in the exercise of this discretion, the authorities have to keep in mind that
adverse entries in the rowdy register or history sheet have some civil consequences on the liberties
of citizens that are constitutionally guaranteed.
iii) Ordinarily, a 'Rowdy Sheet' may not be opened in respect of a person merely because a criminal
case is registered against him and something more is required for that consistent with what is stated
in the above paragraphs. 'History sheets' are automatically opened on conviction and subsist for a
period of two years (Order 1054). However, Order 1049(3) provides that names of persons must be
removed from the history sheet ten years after the expiry of their last sentence; of course this can be
done earlier too if the Superior Police Officer authorises it.
iv) A 'Register of Rowdies' in all its parts is to be maintained as a record of confidentiality.
Ordinarily, no opportunity of hearing needs to be granted at the entry level of the register.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103716906/ 29
Sri Manja @ Golla Manja vs State Of Karnataka on 22 April, 2022
v) Rowdy sheeting though a matter of discretion ought to be carried out reasonably with and with
due deference to the existing provisions of law as construed by courts.
vi) Rowdy Sheets like History Sheets are also subject to periodical review. Representations ought to
be given due consideration for deletion/discontinuation of name. IX. ROWDY/HISTORY
SHEETING AND BALANCING OF INTERESTS:
(i) Learned advocates appearing for the petitioners vehemently contended that the
rowdy sheeting and history sheeting have grave implications on the rights & liberties
constitutionally guaranteed to the individuals. Learned AGA justifies this measure on
the ground of necessity and in public interest. Viewed from PUTTASWAMY
jurisprudence, what is argued on behalf of the citizens and what is contended on
behalf of the State appear to be the two extremes. Petitioners assert that the
institution of Rowdy Sheeting should have no place in a 'liberty oriented' regime
whereas, the State counters the same. Mikhail Bakunin (1814 - 1876) had said that
the State is formed on the premise that men are wicked and society is organized on
the assumption that they are virtuous. Keeping this in mind, a golden balance needs
to be struck between the two opposing claims so that the same shall serve the cause of
both the individual interest and the community interest. After all, our constitution
does not guarantee rights and liberties in absolute terms. It has been a settled
position of law that the private interest to an extent has to yield to the public welfare.
In any organised society, an individual barters away some of his rights & liberties as a
'fair-price' for being a member of the community. Therefore, the argument that the
institutionalized Rowdy Register/History Sheeting should be abruptly discontinued
by the stroke of a pen cannot be acceded to.
Ordinarily, what measures are to be put in place in for regulating the lives of people, is a matter
pertaining to the domain of Executive Wisdom. Our system enjoins a duty that every organ of the
State should show due deference to the decisions of co-ordinate organs. Arguably, this too is a 'basic
feature' of the Constitution. Courts cannot run a race of opinions with the Executive.
(ii) As already mentioned above, Rowdy/History Sheeting as an institutionalized State mechanism
to prevent social turmoil and to control crimes has been there since centuries in several civilized
jurisdictions. Its forms & nomenclatures may vary but its obtainment cannot be much disputed. This
fact itself proves its utility and consequent justification for continuance. Social scientists say that a
social institution that does not substantially enure to the benefit of community at large would wither
away, sooner or later. The enormous utilitarian value of this police practice justifies the same being
institutionalized by the State, some amount of evil associated with it, notwithstanding. At the same
time, learned Amicus Curiae's reliance on an article by CHARLES WAREN & LUIS D. BRADEIS47,
written more than a century ago, is also justified. A relevant portion of the said article has been
profitably reproduced below:
"...once a civilization has made a distinction between the 'outer' and the 'inner'
man...it becomes impossible to avoid the idea of privacy by whatever name it may be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103716906/ 30
Sri Manja @ Golla Manja vs State Of Karnataka on 22 April, 2022
called - the idea of a 'private space in which man may become and remain himself'... "
(iii) The above having been said, one has to broadly advert to the likely consequences of
Rowdy/History Sheeting: Senior Advocates, Mr. Sandesh Chouta & Mr. Prasanna Kumar rightly
submitted that the registration of an individual in Rowdy/History Sheets results into curtailment of
his rights & liberties, or at least it has such a potential. Registration assumes relevance in matters
relating to police surveillance, externment orders, preventive detention, parading of shady
characters, requisition for weapon deposit, verification of credentials for private & public
employment, furnishing of inputs to lending agencies & banks, discreet information for marriage &
business alliances. Human mind being what it is, entries in the Rowdy Register/History Sheets may
play as inarticulate factors, albeit in varying degrees, with the decision makers. In a world of
expanding transparency, there is enormous public gaze & scrutiny of all State actions. Even
classified information somehow leaks to the public domain, playing havoc with the privacy &
autonomy of individuals. These entries also pose a threat to their reputation, that enjoys
constitutional protection under the umbrella of Article 21 vide SUBRAMANIAN SWAMY vs. UNION
OF INDIA48. An individual being branded as a 'bad character/shady character', 'goonda' or 'rowdy'
is viewed as an 'anti-social element'. During special occasions such as elections, festivals,
social/political events, visits of Constitutional/Foreign dignitaries, social turmoil or the like, their
activities are put under acute scanner. Police surveillance per se casts social stigma that may mar the
political career of the individual concerned. This is where some mechanism/framework has to be
devised to minimize the damage potential in the light of privacy jurisprudence as developed in K.S.
PUTTASWAMY, supra.
(iv) Learned Advocate Mr. Prasanna Kumar is fairly justified in contending that persons being
tagged as 'rowdy' makes them susceptible to punitive treatments such as periodic parading &
interrogation based on 'antecedents' & assumed 'propensity to re-offend'; Even in matters like the
claim for grant or renewal of 47 Charles Warren and Luis. D. Brandeis, 'Right to Privacy', Harvard
Law Review, (4), 193, (1890) Passports, police verification is routinely undertaken in terms of the
Passport Manual which has some statutory force, the same having been promulgated under the
Passport Act, 1967. A rowdy/history sheeter runs some risk of being denied these travel documents.
This apart, the entries in the Registers are pleaded as a ground for opposing bail. In S.VENKATESH
vs. STATE OF KARNATAKA49 disposed off on 18.08.2015, a Co- ordinate Bench of this Court
observed as under:
"...the nature of the offences committed by this petitioner and further the fact that he
is a rowdy sheeter, though two criminal cases ended up in acquittal and in which
charge sheet is not filed, but the facts and materials placed before me in this case, I
am not inclined to grant bail. Accordingly, petition rejected."
Additionally, rowdy/history sheeting, casts a shadow upon legal proceedings especially when factors
such as criminal background, adverse history & pendency of criminal cases are some of the relevant
factors upon which sentencing of the convict is ordinarily undertaken vide GURUMUKH SINGH vs.
STATE OF HARYANA50.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103716906/ 31
Sri Manja @ Golla Manja vs State Of Karnataka on 22 April, 2022
(v) The question of surveillance by the State vis-à-vis fundamental rights of its citizenry is no longer
res integra. In this regard, the observations of FRANKFURTER, J. in WOLF vs. COLORADO, supra
which have also been quoted in KHARAK SINGH supra has been profitably reproduced below: 48
(2016) 7 SCC 221 "...The security of one's privacy against arbitrary intrusion by the police....is the
basis of a free society. It is therefore implicit in the 'concept of ordered liberty' and as such
enforceable against the State through the Due Process Clause. The 'knock at the door', whether by
day or by night as a prelude to search, without authority of law but solely on the authority of the
police, did not need the commentary of recent history to be condemned as inconsistent with the
conception of human rights enshrined in history and the basic constitutional documents of
English-speaking people...". Though, the extent of surveillance ought to be decided on the tangled
knots of specifics projected by each case, the constitutional threshold of surveillance stops short of
'squeezing the fundamental freedoms guaranteed to persons' and surveillance so intrusive that 'it
would offend the dignity of individuals' becomes impermissible. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in of
TOFAN SINGH vs. STATE OF TAMIL NADU51 observed:
"...The importance of Semayne case [77 ER 194] is that it decided that every man's
home is his castle and fortress for his defence against injury and violence, as well as
for his repose. William Pitt, the Elder, put it thus: The poorest man may in his cottage
bid defiance to all the force of the Crown. It may be frail--its roof may shake -- the
wind may blow through it--the storm may enter, the rain may enter--but the King of
England cannot enter--all his force dare not cross the threshold of the ruined
tenement..."
(vi) A closer examination of the constitutionality of surveillance as continuously shaped in the
judicial process 49 Criminal Petition No. 468 of 2015 50 (2009) 15 SCC 635 51 2020 SCC OnLine SC
882 points towards a balanced combination of compelling State interest, substantive grounds &
adequate procedural safeguards. Viewed from these yardsticks, Order 1059 only provides for a
'reasonable belief' based on 'substantive grounds' as a sine qua non for entering the names of
individuals to the 'register of rowdies'. However, it must be said that there is a stark non- existence
of adequate procedural safeguards, leaving the aggrieved with no hope of remedy. This malady has
to be addressed by ensuring 'due process' safeguards such as: (a) opportunity for representation
before making entry to the register; (b) periodic suo motu review of entries in the registers,
(c) review on request for deletion of names; & (d) petition against adverse decision. What the Apex
Court in MOHAMMAD GIASUDDIN vs. STATE OF ANDHRA PRADESH, supra is worth adverting
to:
"...Reform of the black letter law is a time-lagging process. But judicial metabolism is
sometimes slower to assimilate the spiritual substance of creative ideas finding their
way into the statute book... It is a truism, often forgotten in the hidden vendetta in
human bosoms, that barbarity breeds barbarity, and injury recoils as injury, so that if
hearing the mentally or morally maimed or malformed man (found guilty) is the goal,
awakening the inner being, more than torturing through exterior compulsions, holds
out better curative hopes."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103716906/ 32
Sri Manja @ Golla Manja vs State Of Karnataka on 22 April, 2022
(vii) In light of the discussion in the preceding paragraphs it can be safely stated that: the
implications of name of an individual being entered, and indefinitely continued in the 'Register of
Rowdies' are far reaching. There are discernible consequences adverse to the interest of the
individual concerned who may not be an accused. Therefore, there has to be a due procedure put in
place for making or continuing entries in the rowdy register/history sheets. There also has to be
evolved a proper Grievance Redressal Mechanism against a wrongful registration of names & their
continuation, regardless of the request of the aggrieved for deletion. The existing provisions of the
Manual as interpreted by the Courts hitherto supposedly prove inadequate in the light of
PUTTASWAMY jurisprudence which has expanded the content & contours of privacy and autonomy
of individuals.
X. HISTORY SHEETING OF INDIVIDUALS LONG AFTER ACQUITTAL:
One has to keep in mind that Rowdy Register and History Sheets have some
difference in the light of text of the provisions of the Manual. Ordinarily, for making
an entry in the history sheet an individual should have undergone some criminal
proceedings that may or may not have ended in conviction.
However, the rowdy sheet stands on a different footing in the sense that the person
whose name figures therein may be a 'clean slater'. Punishment, in criminal
jurisprudence, purges the guilt, is true. However, it is not that soon after completing
the prison term, one becomes a saint or a savant. Both, legal, social stigma or some
kind of disability continues for some period even after one completes his
imprisonment and comes out from the gaol. Several legislations, more particularly in
the realm of election law, service law and the like encumber rights of convicts even
after they have served the sentence and paid the fine. On the same analogy, it can be
argued that even after a person successfully comes out with an acquitted he may risk
his name being entered or continued in the history sheets, if cogent grounds
therefore do continue. Merely because a person is acquitted of the criminal charge or
that the criminal proceedings against him are quashed and since then long time has
lapsed, he cannot as a matter of right seek deletion of his name from the history sheet
on that ground per se. Something more is required. After all, rowdy sheeting &
history sheeting are not the punitive measures but preventive techniques of possible
disruption of societal peace. In any event, a History Sheeter can be shifted to the
register of rowdies, if there are cogent reasons for that. However, all these are matters
left to the regulated police discretion.
XI. DUE PROCESS IN ROWDY SHEETING:
(i) Indisputably, basic human rights are universal; however, their regulation is also a
constitutional reality. Restrictions and regulations on Part III rights, is the trade-off
which persons bear for being members of a civilized community. When law provides
for prevention detention, it cannot be gainfully argued that the rules providing for
rowdy registration & history sheeting are unconstitutional. The rights constitutionally
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103716906/ 33
Sri Manja @ Golla Manja vs State Of Karnataka on 22 April, 2022
guaranteed compete with the power constitutionally vested in the State to restrict
them. As already mentioned above, a golden balance needs to be a struck between
these competing interests. While deliberating the grant of bail, the Apex Court in
GUDIKANTI NARASIMHULU vs. PUBLIC PROSECUTOR, HIGH COURT OF
ANDHRA PRADESH52 observed:
"...After all, personal liberty of an accused or convict is fundamental, suffering lawful
eclipse only in terms of 'procedure established by law'. The last four words of Art. 21
are the life of that human right. The doctrine of Police Power, constitutionally
validates punitive processes for the maintenance of public order, security of the State,
national integrity and the interest of the public generally. Even so, having regard to
the solemn issue involved, deprivation of personal freedom, ephemeral or enduring,
must be founded on the most serious considerations relevant to the welfare objectives
of society, specified in the Constitution..."
Thus, the deprivation of liberty of an individual is a matter of grave concern and permissible only
when the law authorizing it is reasonable, even-handed and geared to the goals of community good
and necessity spelt out in the constitutional guarantees. Procedural due process rests on the
foundations of the 'just, fair & reasonable' clause, ensuring that the substance of the right is not
eroded by mere dictates of the black letter of law. The Apex Court in KESAVANANDA supra,
observed as under:
"...The reason why the expression "due process"
has never been defined is that it embodies a concept of fairness which has to be decided with
reference to the facts and circumstances of each case and also according to the mores for the time
being in force in a society to which the concept has to be applied. As Justice Frankfurter said, "due
process" is not a technical conception with a fixed content unrelated to time, place and
circumstances See Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath 341 U.S. 123..."
(ii) On similar lines, 'compelling State interest' avails as a ground for restricting personal liberty.
However, it has to satisfy the 'substantive due process' clause, as discussed by the Apex Court in K.S.
PUTTASWAMY, at paragraph 45:
"...Gobind resorted to the compelling state interest standard in addition to the Article
21 reasonableness enquiry. From the United States where the terminology of
'compelling state interest' originated, a strict standard of scrutiny comprises two
things- a 'compelling state interest' and a requirement of 'narrow tailoring' (narrow
tailoring means that the law must be narrowly framed to achieve the objective). As a
term, compelling state interest does not have definite contours in the US. Hence, it is
critical that this standard be adopted with some clarity as to when and in what types
of privacy claims it is to be used..."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103716906/ 34
Sri Manja @ Golla Manja vs State Of Karnataka on 22 April, 2022
Notably, 'procedural due process' is no longer a 'formalistic requirement' but rather signifies the
content of the procedure and its quality which must be fair, just and reasonable. Jurisprudentially, it
must be observed that the foundational blocks of 'substantive due process' correspond to inalienable
values of a social order, whence fundamental natural liberties too are derived. Procedural safeguards
in the form of 52 1978 (2) SCR 371 'substantive due process' too are the dictates of natural law.
Natural Justice is no mystic testament of judge-made juristics but the pragmatic, yet principled,
requirement of fairplay as norms of a civilized justice-system. On due process, RONALD
DWORKIN53 writes:
"...Our constitutional system rests on a particular moral theory, namely, that men
have moral rights against the state. The different clauses of the Bill of Rights, like the
due process and equal protection clauses, must be understood as appealing to moral
concepts rather than laying down particular concepts; therefore, a court that
undertakes the burden of applying these clauses fully as law must be an activist court,
in the sense that it must be prepared to frame and answer questions of political
morality..."
(iii) Law has marched further to include this interpretation of 'substantive due process' vide Apex
Court decision in K.S PUTTASWAMY wherein at paragraph 164, it is observed:
"...The quality of reasonableness does not attach only to the content of the procedure
which the law prescribes with reference to Article 21 but to the content of the law
itself. In other words, the requirement of Article 21 is not fulfilled only by the
enactment of fair and reasonable procedure under the law and a law which does so
may yet be susceptible to challenge on the ground that its content does not accord
with the requirements of a valid law..."
The above discussion highlights that though the determination of substantive content is left to the
wisdom of the legislature, judicial inquiry is founded upon the realm of processes that become 'due'
when the State authorities in their anxiousness to 53 Ronald Dworkin, Taking Rights Seriously,
Duckworth (1977) protect the public interest may abridge liberty of persons in an arbitrary,
unreasonable & unjust manner.
(iv) Though the institution of 'rowdy sheeting' is evolved by necessity, the due process clause needs
to embedded in the entire exercise. In K.S. PUTTASWAMY at paragraph 165 it is observed:
"...In his celebrated dissent, Justice Fazl Ali pointed out that the phrase 'procedure
established by law' was borrowed from the Japanese Constitution (which was drafted
under American influence at the end of the Second World War) and hence the
expression means 'procedural due process'. In Justice Fazl Ali's view the deprivation
of life and personal liberty under Article 21, had to be preceded by (i) a notice; (ii) an
opportunity of being heard; (iii) adjudication by an impartial tribunal; and (iv) an
orderly course of procedure..."

Sri Manja @ Golla Manja vs State Of Karnataka on 22 April, 2022
The marked areas of 'procedural due process' as mentioned above provides the broad guidelines for
identifying areas and forms of processes that accrue to the individual due to his name being
registered in the Rowdy sheet/History sheet. It may be said that while the State has a legitimate
interest in the protection of its citizenry, there is also a duty resting on its shoulders for protecting
the individuals as well. In matters of history sheeting and rowdy sheeting, because of their
implications, the Police should critically examine & adjust the boundaries between the societal
interest and liberties of the individual concerned. Therefore, arguably, there is a need for a
comprehensive legislation concerning the subject matter post PUTTASWAMY. Till that is done, the
commoners cannot be asked to put up with the legal regime now obtaining, unsatisfactorily.
In the above circumstances, all these Writ Petitions are disposed off prescribing the following
