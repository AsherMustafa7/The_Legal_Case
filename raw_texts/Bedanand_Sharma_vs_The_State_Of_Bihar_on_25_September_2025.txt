Heard the parties.
2. The petitioner, an aspirant for the post of Assistant

Advertisement No.AP-MATH-23/20-21 is aggrieved with the
action of the respondents, especially the Bihar State University
Service Commission (for brevity 'the Commission') in not

considering his candidature under the category of EBC/OBC
and treated him to be Unreserved Category candidate.
3. Learned Advocate for the petitioner submitted that
in terms with the captioned advertisement, the petitioner had
submitted his application by specifically clarifying that he
belongs to EBC/OBC (NCL) and has also submitted all the
documents. The scrutiny was done by the Commission and no
objection was raised; later on an important notice was issued on
30.04.2024
. It has been informed that since the petitioner could not submit the Non-Creamy Layer Certificate
and thus he has been treated as a candidate under the Unreserved Category. The said notice was
also invited objection from the candidates that in case they have any claim/objection, they may file
their objection till 15.05.2024. In pursuant to the aforesaid important notice, the petitioner
immediately submitted his Non-Creamy Layer Certificate dated 26.03.2022 and further Certificate
dated 06.05.2024. Despite the certificates duly furnished by the petitioner, his name did not find in
the result. He has also filed a representation before the Secretary of the Commission; however, till
date no action has been taken. Hence, the present application.
4. On the other hand, Mr. Tuhin Shankar, learned Patna High Court CWJC No.11093 of 2024
dt.25-09-2025 Advocate for the Commission has taken this Court through the advertisement and
submitted that the facts are admitted; the cut- off date for filing application through online along
with all the necessary documents/certificates was fixed on 02.11.2020, which was later on extended
through a Corrigendum to 24.11.2020 and the hard copy of the certificates was directed to be filed
before 30.12.2020. It is the admitted position that the petitioner has enclosed two Non-Creamy
Layer Certificates, one dated 26.03.2022 and another dated 06.05.2024, issued much after the
cut-off date and thus the request of the petitioner to treat him under EBC/OBC category is
manifestly unsustainable. So far the contention of the petitioner with respect to the important notice
dated 30.04.2024 is concerned, the same also appears to be misconceived for the simple reason that
at no point of time, the petitioner has filed Non-Creamy Layer Certificate before the cut-off date
and, as such, his claim for any correction in the category could not be entertained.
5. It is urged that identical issue has come up for consideration before the co-ordinate Bench of this
Court in the case of Neetu Kumar v. The Bihar State University Service Commission & Ors.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172986073/ 2
Bedanand Sharma vs The State Of Bihar on 25 September, 2025
[C.W.J.C. No.10202 of 2024] and further in the case of Prabhu Kumar v. The State of Bihar & Ors.
Patna High Court CWJC No.11093 of 2024 dt.25-09-2025 [C.W.J.C. No.10853 of 2024], wherein
the learned Court taking note of the relevant prescription of the advertisement did not interfere in
the matter and rejected the claim of the writ- petitioners, who had submitted their Non-Creamy
Layer Certificate after the cut-off date.
6. Reliance has also been placed on a decision of the learned Division Bench of this Court in Dr.
Shishu Pal Singh @ Shishu Pal Singh v. The State of Bihar & Ors. [L.P.A. No.1003 of 2024], wherein
the learned Division Bench underscored the primacy to the cut-off date mentioned in the
advertisement; if the candidate(s) failed to produce any certificate before the cut-off date, the same
could not be taken into consideration.
7. Having given careful consideration to the submissions advanced by the learned Advocates for the
respective parties, it would be worth benefiting to take note of the relevant prescriptions of the
advertisement. Clause 5 of the advertisement which deals with important points to be noted
regarding essential educational qualifications, clearly stipulates that all the certificates and degrees
regarding educational qualification must have been issued before 02.11.2020 i.e. the closing date for
filling the online application, otherwise the Patna High Court CWJC No.11093 of 2024
dt.25-09-2025 candidate's candidature will be rejected in terms with Clause 5.1 thereof. The
reservation policy, as has been stipulated in Clause 8 of the advertisement clearly prescribes that the
candidate of Backward Class and Extremely Backward Class will be required to submit the following
certificates:-(a) Caste Certificate, (b) Domicile Certificate and (c) Non-Creamy Layer Certificate.
Clause 8.3.3 further prescribes that in case of BC and EBC candidates the Caste Certificate, Domicile
Certificate and Non- Creamy Layer Certificate and in case of SC and ST candidates the Caste
Certificate and Domicile Certificate signed by the Circle Officer of the circle of his permanent
resident will be valid. Further, Clause 11.1 of the Advertisement prescribes that the applicants were
required to submit requisite documents specified therein, including Non-Creamy Layer Certificate,
who were claiming reservation under Extremely Backward Class/Other Backward Class category
within the specified date and time. The last date for submission of the application along with
documents prescribed was 02.11.2020 which was extended upto 10.12.2020 and further till
30.12.2020 by 5:00 PM.
8. Admittedly, the case in hand, the petitioner did not submit Non-Creamy Layer Certificate along
with his application within the stipulated time for submission as Patna High Court CWJC No.11093
of 2024 dt.25-09-2025 prescribed in the advertisement and in absence thereof, the petitioner has
been treated to be a candidate under General Category in terms of the advertisement. The
submission of the petitioner that in the light of the notice dated 30.04.2024 and prior thereto, the
petitioner has submitted his Non-Creamy Layer Certificate would not come to his rescue as the
terms of the advertisement specifically prohibits receipt of the Non- Creamy Layer Certificate after
the cut off date.
9. Counter affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent Commission further refuted the contention of
the petitioner that the Commission had given any opportunity to similarly situated candidates to
submit their application after the cut off date, as it was impermissible and no concession to any

Bedanand Sharma vs The State Of Bihar on 25 September, 2025
similarly situated candidates was accorded to submit their Non-Creamy Layer Certificate after the
cut off date.
10. The issue regarding primacy to the terms and conditions of the advertisement had come up for
consideration in the case Bedanga Talukdar vs Saifudaullah Khan & Ors [(2011) 12 SCC 85], where
the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as follows:
" 29. We have considered the entire matter in detail. In our opinion, it is too well
settled to need any further reiteration that all appointments to public office have to
be made in Patna High Court CWJC No.11093 of 2024 dt.25-09-2025 conformity
with Article 14 of the Constitution of India. In other words, there must be no
arbitrariness resulting from any undue favour being shown to any candidate.
Therefore, the selection process has to be conducted strictly in accordance with the
stipulated selection procedure. Consequently, when a particular schedule is
mentioned in an advertisement, the same has to be scrupulously maintained. There
cannot be any relaxation in the terms and conditions of the advertisement unless
such a power is specifically reserved. Such a power could be reserved in the relevant
statutory rules. Even if power of relaxation is provided in the rules, it must still be
mentioned in the advertisement. In the absence of such power in the rules, it could
still be provided in the advertisement. However, the power of relaxation, if exercised,
has to be given due publicity. This would be necessary to ensure that those candidates
who become eligible due to the relaxation, are afforded an equal opportunity to apply
and compete. Relaxation of any condition in advertisement without due publication
would be contrary to the mandate of equality contained in Articles 14 and 16 of the
Constitution of India."
11. Further, the Full Bench of this Court in the case of Braj Kishore Prasad vs. State of Bihar (F.B.)
[1998 (3) PLJR 34] underscored the relevance of the date prescribed in the advertisement and strict
compliance of the terms and conditions thereof. It would be worth benefiting to quote para-26
thereof which reads as under:
Patna High Court CWJC No.11093 of 2024 dt.25-09-2025 "26. Having regard to all
these considerations, I hold that:
(a) Where the advertisement specifies the last date for filing of supporting or other
documents, that date must be given effect to, and any document received after such
date shall be rejected by the selecting authority.
(b) In appropriate cases where the selecting authority is of the view that the time for
furnishing of documents should be extended, it may grant such extension by issuing a
public notice to this effect so that all candidates may get the benefit of such
extension. In the absence of any such extension granted by the selecting authority,
the date/dates mentioned in the advertisement should be treated to be the last date
for filing of documents, and no document shall be accepted thereafter.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172986073/ 4
Bedanand Sharma vs The State Of Bihar on 25 September, 2025
(c) No application/ document shall be entertained by the Commission if the same is
filed after the last date specified in the advertisement, or the extended date notified
by the commission, even if the same is filed before the finalisation of the select list.
(d) In appropriate cases where this Court is satisfied that a case of extreme hardship
or injustice has resulted on account of factors beyond the control of the concerned
candidate, this Court in exercise of its writ jurisdiction may grant relief in deserving
cases. But in doing so, the Court must be satisfied that the candidate concerned has
acted diligently, and is not guilty of delay or laches in taking necessary steps for
procuring the requisite certificates, etc. However, no relief shall be granted where the
requisite certificate is produced for the Patna High Court CWJC No.11093 of 2024
dt.25-09-2025 first time after the process of selection is complete and the selecting
authority has made its recommendation."
12. Identical issue has come up for consideration before a Bench of this Court in Neetu Kumar and
Prabhu Kumar (supra) wherein the Court having taken note of the fact that the applicants failed to
submit their certificate before the cut off date of 30.12.2020 did not interfere in the writ petition and
dismissed the same.
13. The reliance placed by the learned Advocate for the Commission on a decision of the learned
Division Bench of this Court in Dr. Shishu Pal Singh(supra) also emphasized the relevance and
importance of the cut off date mentioned in the advertisement. Placing reliance upon the decision
rendered in the cases of Bedanga Talukdar and Braj Kishore Prasad (supra), the learned Division
Bench affirmed the order of the learned Single Judge, whereby the writ petition filed by the
appellant was dismissed when he was unable to submit the required experience certificate in the
format prescribed by the Commission before the cut off date prescribed in the advertisement.
14. In view of the discussions and the legal position settled by the Courts, noted hereinabove, this
Court does not Patna High Court CWJC No.11093 of 2024 dt.25-09-2025 find any merit in the writ
petition and, accordingly, the same stands dismissed.
