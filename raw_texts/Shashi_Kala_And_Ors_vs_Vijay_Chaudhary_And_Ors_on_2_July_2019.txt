4. Claim case has been filed under Section 166 of M.V. Act by Shashi Kala, the widow of deceased
Krishna Kumar alongwith one major daughter and one minor daughter and one minor son.
Opposite party No. 1 Vijay Chaudhary is the owner of offending vehicle and opposite party No. 2 was
the driver and opposite party No. 3 is the Insurer of the offending vehicle.
5. Appellant is aggrieved by the quantum of compensation which has been assessed by the Tribunal
in which the monthly income of deceased has been held to be Rs. 6,253/- and the annual income has
been assessed as Rs. 75,036/- and 1/3rd has been deducted towards personal expenses of deceased
and loss of the dependency has been assessed to be Rs. 50,024/- and 13 has been applied as a
multiplier as deceased was 48 years old and the total amount of compensation has been assessed as
Rs. 6,50,312/- Apart from compensation amount, the Tribunal has granted additional compensation
under the head of loss of consortium as Rs. 5000/-, loss of estate as Rs. 2,500/- and funeral
expenses as Rs. 2000/-. Since 50,000/- of interim compensation was already paid to the claimant,
the total liability of the owner/insurer comes to Rs. 6,09,812/- with Patna High Court MA No.447 of
2017 dt.02-07-2019 interest @ 7% per annum which has been directed to be paid to the claimants.
6. It has been submitted on behalf of respondent Insurance Company that the award amount
alongwith up-to-date interest has already been paid to the claimant. It has been submitted on behalf
of appellant that Tribunal has wrongly deducted 1/3rd as personal expenses of deceased as there
were four dependents as such deduction should be 1/4th for personal expenses. Additional
compensation granted to the appellant is not in consonance with the law laid down by the Supreme
Court in case of National Insurance Company Ltd. Vs. Pranay Sethi and Ors. however, same was
opposed on behalf of counsel for the respondent that judgment and order is subsequent to order
passed by the Tribunal, as such the Tribunal has rightly calculated the compensation amount and
same has already been paid and at appellate stage same cannot be granted to the appellant,
however, as per judgment and order of Supreme Court Rs. 70,000/- is to paid under the head of loss
of estate, loss of consortium and funeral expenses in all claim cases. The quantum of compensation
for which claimants are entitled is being redetermined by this Court.
