S.John vs Regional Officer on 5 February, 2020
For Appellants : Mr.Sudesh Kumar P.A.

For Respondents : Mr.V.Anandhamoorthy
(in all WAs) [R1 & R2]
Mr.Su.Srinivasan [R3]
COMMON JUDGMENT
(Delivered by The Hon'ble Chief Justice) Heard learned counsel for the appellants.
2. The contention raised is that the competent authority proceeded to declare the award under the
National Highways Act, ignoring the amendment made under Section 105(3) of the Right to Fair
Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013. It
is not disputed that the National Highways Act has been kept outside the purview of the 2013 Act,
under the IV Schedule thereof, but by virtue of an amendment on which reliance has been placed by
the learned counsel for the appellants while determining compensation, the provisions of the Act
have been applied http://www.judis.nic.in WA.Nos.2627 to 2637 & 2641 to 2644 of 2019 to an
award of compensation under the National Highways Act.
3. Learned counsel has vehemently urged that this aspect of the matter has been completely
overlooked by the competent authority and inspite of repeated circulars and directions issued, the
award has been delivered ignoring the same. In this circumstance, a petition under Article 226 was
maintainable and the learned Single Judge has therefore, erroneously declined to interfere in the
matter.
4. The contention therefore, in short is that the remedy as provided under Section 3-G(5) of the
National Highways Act, 1956, cannot be resorted to by the appellants, as the Arbitrator does not
have this jurisdiction to entertain for which further reliance is placed on Section 3-G(7) of the Act.
5. We have heard learned counsel for the appellants, learned counsel appearing for the National
Highways Authority of India as well as the learned counsel for the State.

6. The provisions of Section 3-G(5) provide for a dispute being raised with regard to the
compensation payable and its determination, in the event, a party feels aggrieved by raising it before
the Arbitrator. Learned counsel contends that Section 3-G(7) restricts the area within which the
Arbitrator can proceed to determine such compensation and therefore, if any statutory amendment
has been ignored while determining compensation, the same cannot be gone into by the Arbitrator.

7. We are unable to agree with this proposition in as much as the amendment which is alleged to
have been ignored is in relation to the issue of award of compensation and the provisions of 2013
Act, relating to determination of compensation have been made applicable. Accordingly, it is an
amendment relating to determination of compensation and therefore, it does not in any way create
an impediment in the determination of the amount by the Arbitrator. To the contrary, the Arbitrator
will be bound to take into consideration the said provisions, as it directly relates to the quantum and
determination of compensation.

8. The learned Single Judge has therefore, in our opinion rightly declined to entertain the writ
petition, leaving it open to the appellants to seek their remedy as per the 1956 Act.
9. These Writ Appeals therefore, fail and the same are rejected, accordingly. Connected civil
miscellaneous petitions are closed.
