NO. 87 OF 2022 IN EP NO. 23 OF 2022: USHAM DEBAN SINGH V. MD. FAJUR RAHIM 2
BEFORE HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE A.GUNESHWAR SHARMA For the Applicant ::
Mr.M.Hemchandra, Sr. Adv, Mr.Tolapishak, Advocate & Mr. N. Rendy, Advocate For the
Respondent/1:: Mr.N.Ibotombi, Sr.Advocate, Mrs. N. Savitri, Advocate Date of Hearing ::
02.02.2024/13.02.2024 Date of Judgment :: 14.06.2024 JUDGMENT & ORDER [1] By the present
application being MC(Election Petition) No. 87 of 2022 in Election Petition No. 23 of 2023, the
respondent No.1/applicant (returned candidate) filed under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil
Procedure (in short, CPC), the maintainability of the election petition being Election Petition No. 23
of 2022 is challenged. [2] Heard Mr. M. Hemchandra, learned senior counsel assisted by Mr. Th.
Tolpishak, Advocate and Mr. M. Rendy, Advocate on behalf of the respondent No.1/applicant and
Mr. N. Ibotombi, learned senior counsel assisted by Mrs. N. Savitri, Advocate on behalf of the
election petitioner.
[3] The instant application arises out of Election Petition No.23 of 2022, which prayed for declaring
the election of the respondent No.1 as Member to the 12th Manipur Legislative Assembly from
36-Wabgai Assembly Constituency as null and void, coupled with a prayer to declare the Election
Petitioner, a candidate nominated and set up by the Indian National Congress, as elected Member of
the 12 th Manipur Legislative Assembly from 36-Wabgai Assembly Constituency, on the MC(EP)
NO. 87 OF 2022 IN EP NO. 23 OF 2022: USHAM DEBAN SINGH V. MD. FAJUR RAHIM 3 ground
that the names of the 30 service voters mentioned in para No.15 of the Petition are not ordinarily
residents of 36-Wabgai Assembly Constituency. These non-resident 30 service voters have casted
their votes as service voters on the basis of service voter list 2022 prepared by the Election Authority
in collusion with the said voters and respondent No.1 (returned candidate). It is also stated that the
names of the 111 voters mentioned in para No.16 of the Election Petition who are central
government employees and senior citizens 80+, have casted their vote by means of ETPBS and
Postal Ballots, ie, voted twice. As the said 111 voters have casted their votes in the polling stations as
well as by means of ETPBS and Postal Ballots, such ballots should be declared as void.
[4] As per Notice dated 16.02.2022 issued by the Returning Officer, the number of voters in respect
of AVSC or Senior Citizens and AVPD or persons with disability flagged in the database of electoral
roll are 229 numbers of 80+ and 44 numbers of PWD, whereas as per the Letter dated 28.03.2022
issued by the Returning Officer, the number of Senior Citizen (above 80 yrs.) is 453 voters and
number of PWD is
53. Regarding the discrepancy, the Election Authority is required to explain why the number of 80+
voter has been increased from 229 voters to 453 voters and also the increase of the number of voter
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/65953408/ 2
Usham Deben Singh vs Md Fajur Rahim Aged About 51 Years on 14 June, 2024
of PWD from 44 voters to 53 voters. It is submitted that the said increased votes have been casted in
favour of the Respondent No.1, in collusion with the Election Authority and as such, the Election of
the Applicant/Respondent No.1 be declared as void.
[5] The respondent No.1, at the outset submits that the petitioner in the above referred election
petition has failed to mention in each pages of the copy of the election petition "Attested to be true
copy" of MC(EP) NO. 87 OF 2022 IN EP NO. 23 OF 2022: USHAM DEBAN SINGH V. MD. FAJUR
RAHIM 4 the enclosed Annexures and conspicuously in para No.23 wherein, under Section 117 of
the RP Act, 1951 read with Chapter VII-A Rule 1(d) of the High Court of Manipur Rules, 2019 a sum
of Rs.2000/- (Two thousand rupees) only has not mentioned as "Attested to be true copy of the
Original Challan No.323 dated 19.04.2022 is enclosed herewith and marked as Annexure A/nil
therefore, when the enclosed statement of the Original Challan No.323 dated 19.04.2022 is not
mentioned in the same amount as not enclosed in the present Election Petition, thereby failed to
abide the section 117 of the RP Act, 1951 read with Chapter VII-A Rule 1(d) of the High Court of
Manipur Rules, 2019 and in these light the present Election is defective and not maintainable.
[6] It is further stated that after perusal of the present Election Petition the custody of the
documents claimed in para No.15 and 16 calling the records, i.e Register maintained by the Election
authority for issuing ETBPS, Electoral Roll of 38 Hiyanglam AC, 35 KhangabokAC, 23 Mayang
Imphal A/C and 37 Kakching AC through the Returning Officer, 36 Wabgai Assembly Constituency
in respect of the alleged thirty voters and the Register maintained by the Election authority for
issuing the ETBPS, Postal Ballot papers and marked copy of electoral Rolls, Electoral roll in the
polling Stations through the Returning Officer, 36 Wabgai Assembly Constituency of the alleged 111
(one hundred eleven) voters, however the grounds for calling the said records are under the domain
of District Electoral Officer and Joint/Chief Electoral Officer and there is no such particular
allegation for collusion along with the election authority and nowhere it is mentioned in the
pleadings the word "corrupt practice" that materially affect the election and make out locus standi
/right to file the present Election Petition.
MC(EP) NO. 87 OF 2022 IN EP NO. 23 OF 2022: USHAM DEBAN SINGH V. MD. FAJUR RAHIM
5 [7] It is also stated that there is no cause of action since all the allegation made in the Election is
wildly imaginary and submitted from procrastination of being unbearable from the loss of the
election against the returned candidate/applicant.
[8] Respondent No.1/election petitioner filed written objection to the misc. application for rejection
of the election petition of the applicant denying the averment of not mentioning 'attested to be true
copy' on annexures and stated that the same is marked on each page of the annexures. It is also
clarified that it is not required to mark 'attested to be true copy' in the petition itself and such lapses,
if any, could not be a ground for rejection of election petition. Regarding non- marking of the
original challan of Rs.2000/- as a security for the election petition in terms of High Court of
Manipur Rules, 2019, the same is not a ground for rejection of the election petition as challan under
Chapter VII-A of the High Court Rules is not a part of document for election petition. Annexing the
same with the election petition is sufficient compliance of the provisions of Section 117 of the
Representation of Peoples Act, 1951. It is further stated that election authority is not a necessary
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/65953408/ 3
Usham Deben Singh vs Md Fajur Rahim Aged About 51 Years on 14 June, 2024
party to the election petition as stipulated under Section 82 of RPA, 1951 and only candidates are the
necessary parties. It is further clarified that material facts as mandated under Section 83 of RPA,
1951 have been taken. The issues raised by the applicants in his written statement are to be decided
during the trial. It is prayed that the application for rejection of election petition be rejected with
exemplary cost.
[9] Mr. M. Hemchandra, learned senior counsel for the applicant/respondent No.1 in the election
petition has raised the following objections to the maintainability of the election petition in the
present form.
MC(EP) NO. 87 OF 2022 IN EP NO. 23 OF 2022: USHAM DEBAN SINGH V. MD. FAJUR RAHIM
6 [10] First objection is regarding failure to mention on each page of the election petition "Attested
to be true copy" of the enclosed Annexures, ie, on page Nos. 11, 12, 13, 35, 38, 40 and in para 23 also
not mention "Attested to be a true copy of the original Challan No. 323 dated 19.04.2022" as
annexures in violation of Section 117 of RPA, 1951 read with Chapter VII-A Rule 1(d) of the High
Court of Manipur Rules, 2019. It is submitted that the same amounts to incomplete material facts in
terms of Section 83(1)(a) of the RPA, 1951 and hence, the election petition can be rejected on this
ground alone. [11] The second ground for objection is for non-joinder of election authority as a
necessary party when allegations are made in para 15, 16 and 20 of the election petition about the
collusion between the election authority and the returned candidate. It is pointed out that the
election petition suffers from non-joinder of necessary party or proper party under the provisions of
Order 1 Rule 9 CPC and the same can be rejected on this ground also.
[12] The third ground for objection to the maintainability of the election petition is for failure to file
separate affidavit in support of the allegation of corrupt practice as mandated under proviso to
Section 83(1)(b) of RPA, 1951. It is explained the averment of 'collusion' with the election authority
and respondent No.1 (returned candidate) amounts to allegation of corrupt practice within the
meaning of Section 100(1)(b)&(d)(ii) and Part VII Chapter I of the Act (Section 123 which defines
'corrupt practice'). The averments made in para 15, 16 and 20 of the election petition are nothing but
instances of corrupt practice as defined in Black Law Dictionary. It is further submitted that
materials facts of collusion such as identity of the election officials, time and date of such act of
collusion, etc. are not explained in para 15 and 16 and hence the same amounts to incomplete facts
within the meaning of MC(EP) NO. 87 OF 2022 IN EP NO. 23 OF 2022: USHAM DEBAN SINGH V.
MD. FAJUR RAHIM 7 section 83(1)(a)&(b) of RPA, 1951 and non-compliance of Form 25 read with
Rule 94A of the Conduct of Election Rules 1961 regarding affidavit to be filed along with election
petition. It is reiterated that such lapses are incurable and fatal.
[13] With respect to the plea of non-disclosure of complete facts, Mr. M. Hemchandra, learned
senior counsel for the applicant refers to the following decisions:
(i) (2001) 8 SCC 233 @ Para 23 & 24- Failure to plead material fact is fatal to election
petition.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/65953408/ 4
Usham Deben Singh vs Md Fajur Rahim Aged About 51 Years on 14 June, 2024
(ii) AIR 1994 P&H 32 @ Para 12- Lack of material facts for collusion of corrupt
practice would lead to rejection of election petition.
(iii) (2008) 7 SCC 604 @ Para 20- insufficient material facts for corrupt practice to
go for a full trial.
(iv) (2009) 10 SCC 541 @ Para 14-21- Rejection of election petition on failure to
disclose material facts.
(v) (2014) 10 SCC 547 @ Para 18 & 19- Materials of corrupt practice should be given
completely.
(vi) (2009) 9 SCC 310 @ Para 50 & 51- Omission of single material fact is fatal.
(vii) 2022 LiveLaw(SC) 802 [Civil Appeal Nos. 5755-56 of 2021 dated 27.09.2022]-
Suit is liable to be dismissed for failure to implead necessary party.
[14] The fourth ground for objection to the maintainability for non- compliance of Sections 15, 17, 18
and 19 of RPA, 1950 and Section 62 of RPA, 1951 could not be a ground for declaring the election of
respondent No.1/returned candidate as null and void under Section 100(1)(d)(iv) of RPA, 1951. It is
highlighted that Section 30 of RPA, 1950 bars jurisdiction of civil court in respect of preparation of
electoral MC(EP) NO. 87 OF 2022 IN EP NO. 23 OF 2022: USHAM DEBAN SINGH V. MD. FAJUR
RAHIM 8 roll and its revision. Mr. M. Hemchandra, learned senior counsel for the applicant relies
on the decision reported as (1974) 3 SCC 415 @ Para 30- Non-compliance of Section 19 of RPA, 1950
cannot be a ground for declaring election result as void under Section 100(1)(d)(iv) of RPA, 1951.
[15] The fifth ground for objection is non-existence of the cause of action, as the election petition is
based on imaginary assumptions and allegations not supported by detailed facts.
[16] The sixth ground for objection is the question of limitation. It is stated that as per the
provisions of Section 81(1) of RPA, 1951, election petition should be filed within 45 days from the
date of declaration of the result. In the present case, the result of the assembly election was declared
on 10.03.2022 and the 45 days expired on 24.04.2022. However, the election petition was registered
on 30.05.2022 thereby causing a delay of 5 days. It is stated that registration of the election petition
after 5 days from the date of expiry of 45 days as contemplated under Section 81(1) of RPA, 1951
cannot be condoned and the same ought to be dismissed on the ground of limitation. It is submitted
that what is mandated under Section 81(1) of RPA, 1951 is the filing of election petition without any
defect within the stipulated 45 days. Mr. M. Hemchandra, learned senior counsel relies on the
decisions reported as (i) (1974) 2 SCC 133 @ Para 23- election petition shall be dismissed for
non-compliance of mandatory provisions of Sections 81, 82 or 117 of RPA, 1951; (ii) (1974) 4 SCC
237 @ Para 14- non- compliance of the provisions of Section 81(3) of RPA, 1951; and (iii) (1999) 8
SCC 266 @ Para 17. It is emphasised that the 'presentation' used in Section 81 of RPA, 1951 should
be read as 'registration' of the election petition. As per RTI reply given by the High Court, the
petition was registered after 5 days delay.

MC(EP) NO. 87 OF 2022 IN EP NO. 23 OF 2022: USHAM DEBAN SINGH V. MD. FAJUR RAHIM
9 [17] The seventh ground for objection is regarding no objection from the election petitioner on the
day of poll, ie, on 05.03.2022 as well as at the time of scrutiny as given in letter dated 28.06.2022
issued by the Returning Officer of 36- Wabagai AC.
[18] The eight ground for objection is that the grounds raised in para 20 of the election petition will
amount to roving and fishing enquiry by the court.
[19] The ninth ground for objection is that the election petitioner has failed to show how he has
materially been affected. [20] Mr. M. Hemchandra, learned senior counsel submits that the election
petition being Election Petition No. 23 of 2022 filed by the petitioner be dismissed with exemplary
cost for misusing the process of court.
[21] Mr. N. Ibotombi, learned senior counsel for the respondent No.1/ election petitioner submits
that in all annexures/documents annexed with the election petition, 'attested to be true copy of the
original' is marked by the petitioner along with his signatures. It is pointed out that as per Section
83(3) of RPA, 1951, such attestation is required only in the documents and not required in the body
of the election petition. It is urged that improper marking of annexures is a ground for rejection of
the plaint as contemplated under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC. It is pointed out that assuming for the sake of
argument that such attestation is to be made in the petition, the same cannot be a ground for
rejection of the election petition at the threshold.
[22] Further, it is clarified that the challan for payment of Rs.2000/- as security for cost of election
petition as contemplated under Section 117 of RPA, 1951 read with Chapter VII-A Rule 1(d) of the
High Court of Manipur Rules, 2019 is not a material particular within the meaning of Section 83(1)
of the Act as held by Hon'ble Supreme Court in a MC(EP) NO. 87 OF 2022 IN EP NO. 23 OF 2022:
USHAM DEBAN SINGH V. MD. FAJUR RAHIM 10 catena of cases. Challan is shown in the Index at
Sl. No.11 and original challan is placed at page No.92 of the election petition. The challan is not a
part and parcel of the election petition, rather it is only a statutory requirement under Section 117 of
RPA 1951 read with Rule 1(d) of Chapter VII-A of the High Court of Manipur Rules, 2019. It is
reiterated that mere filing of the original challan along with the election petition is a sufficient
compliance of the mandatory provisions. [23] In reply to the plea of non-joinder of necessary party,
Mr. N. Ibotombi, learned senior counsel submits that all parties required under Section 82 of the
Act have been impleaded in the election petition. It is pointed out that the election authority and the
voters are not parties as contemplated under Section 82 of the Act. It is stated that only the
candidates against whom reliefs are prayed for, are the necessary party in an election petition.
[24] With respect to the plea of non-filing of separate affidavit for corrupt practice in terms of the
provisions of the proviso to Section 83(1)(b) of RPA, 1951, it is clarified that the petitioner does not
plead corrupt practice in his petition and hence no separate affidavit is required. Even if assuming
for the sake of argument that the plea of corrupt practice is implicit in para 15 and 16 of the election
petition, the affidavit can be submitted later on as per the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the
case of Thangjam Arunkumar v. Yumkham Erabot: 2023 INSC 762. It is submitted that there is no
merit on this objection.

Usham Deben Singh vs Md Fajur Rahim Aged About 51 Years on 14 June, 2024
[25] Mr. N. Ibotombi, learned senior counsel relies on the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
the case of R K Roja v. U S Rayudu:
(2016) 14 SCC 275 to emphasise the point that the election petition can be rejected at
the threshold if on reading of the election petition, the entire petition falls within the
purview of the provisions of Order 7 MC(EP) NO. 87 OF 2022 IN EP NO. 23 OF
2022: USHAM DEBAN SINGH V. MD. FAJUR RAHIM 11 Rule 11 (a) to (f) of CPC. It
is pointed out that the election petition does not attract any of the situations as
stipulated in the above provisions.
On this point, reference is also made to the decision in the case of Dahiben v. Arvindbhai Kalyanji
Bhanusali: (2020) 7 SCC 366 to highlight that plaint can be rejected if cause of action is not
disclosed on entire reading of the plaint.
[26] With respect to the objection on the ground of limitation, Mr. N. Ibotombi, learned senior
counsel submits that Section 81 of RPA, 1951 specially mentions that an election petition has to be
presented within 45 days from the date of declaration of the result. Reading the word 'presented' as
registration of election petition would amount to judicial amendment of the statute. It is clarified
that the case law cited by the applicant, ie, Hukumdev (supra): (1974) 2 SCC 133, does not postulate
such an interpretation. It is submitted that the present application is filed with an intent to delay
proceeding of the election petition and prays that the application under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC for
rejection of election petition be dismissed being devoid of any merit with exemplary cost.
[27] This Court has perused the materials on record specially the contents of election petition, the
submissions made at bar, the relevant provisions of law and case laws in this regard. Before entering
into merit of the application, it will be useful to reproduce relevant provisions of the statutes.

(5) The High Court may, upon such terms as to costs and otherwise as it may deem fit, allow the
particulars of any corrupt practice alleged in the petition to be amended or amplified in such
manner as may in its opinion be necessary for ensuring a fair and effective trial of the petition, but
shall not allow any amendment of the petition which will have the MC(EP) NO. 87 OF 2022 IN EP
NO. 23 OF 2022: USHAM DEBAN SINGH V. MD. FAJUR RAHIM 15 effect of introducing
particulars of a corrupt practice not previously alleged in the petition.
(6) The trial of an election petition shall, so far as is practicable consistently with the interests of
justice in respect of the trial, be continued from day to day until its conclusion, unless the High
Court finds the adjournment of the trial beyond the following day to be necessary for reasons to be
recorded.
(7) Every election petition shall be tried as expeditiously as possible and endeavour shall be made to
conclude the trial within six months from the date on which the election petition is presented to the

rules made thereunder, every election petition shall be tried by the High Court, as nearly as may be,
in accordance with the procedure applicable under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) to
the trial of suits:
Provided that the High Court shall have the discretion to refuse, for reasons to be
recorded in writing, to examine any witness or witnesses if it is of the opinion that the
evidence of such witness or witnesses is not material for the decision of the petition
or that the party tendering such witness or witnesses is doing so on frivolous grounds
or with a view to delay the proceedings.
(2) The provisions of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (1 of 1872), shall, subject to the
provisions of this Act, be deemed to apply in all respects to the trial of an election
petition.
Section 100. Grounds for declaring election to be void.--(1) Subject to the provisions of sub-section
(2) if the High Court is of opinion--

1963 (20 of 1963); or
(b) that any corrupt practice has been committed by a returned candidate or his election agent or by
any other person with the consent of a returned candidate or his election agent; or
(c) that any nomination has been improperly rejected; or MC(EP) NO. 87 OF 2022 IN EP NO. 23 OF

(d) that the result of the election, in so far as it concerns a returned candidate, has been materially
affected--
(i) by the improper acceptance of any nomination, or
(ii) by any corrupt practice committed in the interests of the returned candidate by an agent other
than his election agent, or
(iii) by the improper reception, refusal or rejection of any vote or the reception of any vote which is
void, or
(iv) by any non-compliance with the provisions of the Constitution or of this Act or of any rules or
orders made under this Act, the High Court shall declare the election of the returned candidate to be
void.
(2) If in the opinion of the High Court, a returned candidate has been guilty by an agent, other than
his election agent, of any corrupt practice but the High Court is satisfied--
(a) that no such corrupt practice was committed at the election by the candidate or his election
agent, and every such corrupt practice was committed contrary to the orders, and without the
consent, of the candidate or his election agent;
(b) [Omitted];
(c) that the candidate and his election agent took all reasonable means for preventing the
commission of corrupt practices at the election; and
(d) that in all other respects the election was free from any corrupt practice on the part of the
candidate or any of his agents, then the High Court may decide that the election of the returned
candidate is not void.
[28] The sum and substance of the nine objections raised by the returned candidate in the
application for rejection of the election petition can be summarised into these broad heads- (i)
non-marking of annexures and challan in the election petition; (ii) non-disclosure of material facts;
(iii) limitation; (iv) non-joinder of necessary party; and
(v) other miscellaneous grounds.

any of the conditions laid down in (a) to
(f) in order to cut short of vexatious litigations at the threshold and in order to save precious judicial
time. It will be fruitful to refer to the decision of Dahiben v. Arvindbhai Kalyanji Bhanusali, (2020) 7

Usham Deben Singh vs Md Fajur Rahim Aged About 51 Years on 14 June, 2024
SCC 366 wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as below:
23.1. We will first briefly touch upon the law applicable for deciding an application
under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC, which reads as under:
"11. Rejection of plaint.--The plaint shall be rejected in the following cases--
(a) where it does not disclose a cause of action;
(b) where the relief claimed is undervalued, and the plaintiff, on being required by
the court to correct the valuation within a time to be fixed by the court, fails to do so;
(c) where the relief claimed is properly valued but the plaint is written upon paper
insufficiently stamped, and the plaintiff, on being required by the court to supply the
requisite stamp paper within a time to be fixed by the court, fails to do so;
(d) where the suit appears from the statement in the plaint to be barred by any law;
(e) where it is not filed in duplicate;
(f) where the plaintiff fails to comply with the provisions of Rule 9:
Provided that the time fixed by the court for the correction of the valuation or
supplying of the requisite stamp-papers shall not be extended unless the court, for
reasons to be recorded, is satisfied that the plaintiff was prevented by any cause of an
exceptional nature from correcting the valuation or supplying the requisite
stamp-papers, as the case may be, within the time fixed by the court and that refusal
to extend such time would cause grave injustice to the plaintiff."
(emphasis supplied) MC(EP) NO. 87 OF 2022 IN EP NO. 23 OF 2022: USHAM
DEBAN SINGH V. MD. FAJUR RAHIM 18 23.2. The remedy under Order 7 Rule 11 is
an independent and special remedy, wherein the court is empowered to summarily
dismiss a suit at the threshold, without proceeding to record evidence, and
conducting a trial, on the basis of the evidence adduced, if it is satisfied that the
action should be terminated on any of the grounds contained in this provision.
23.3. The underlying object of Order 7 Rule 11(a) is that if in a suit, no cause of action
is disclosed, or the suit is barred by limitation under Rule 11(d), the court would not
permit the plaintiff to unnecessarily protract the proceedings in the suit. In such a
case, it would be necessary to put an end to the sham litigation, so that further
judicial time is not wasted.
[30] It is provided by the provisions of Section 87 of RPA, 1951 that the provisions of CPC will be
applicable to the trial of election petition as nearly as possible subject to the provisions of the Act
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/65953408/ 12
Usham Deben Singh vs Md Fajur Rahim Aged About 51 Years on 14 June, 2024
and any rules made thereunder. In other words, the rule of CPC will be applicable in an election
petition in consistent with the provisions of RPA, 1951 and rules made thereunder. In case of any
inconsistency, the provisions of RPA will prevail over the provisions of CPC. From the above
referred para, it is seen that the provisions of Order 7 Rule 11 CPC will be applicable in an election
petition specially the rules stipulated under sub-rules (a) and (d) of non-disclosure of cause of action
and barred by limitation. In the case of Dahiben (supra), the 'cause of action' is defined as 'every fact
which would be necessary for the plaintiff to prove, if traversed, in order to support his right to
judgment. It consists of a bundle of material facts, which are necessary for the plaintiff to prove in
order to entitle him to the reliefs claimed in the suit'. In short, the cause of action consists of
materials facts for succeeding in a suit. If such facts are not disclosed on a plain reading of the
plaint, the same MC(EP) NO. 87 OF 2022 IN EP NO. 23 OF 2022: USHAM DEBAN SINGH V. MD.
FAJUR RAHIM 19 can be rejected at the threshold. Limitation is one of the grounds for rejection of
plaint under sub-rule (d) to Order 7 Rule 11 CPC. [31] Apart from the provisions of Order 7 Rule 11
CPC, Section 86(1) of RPA, 1951 mandates the High Court to dismiss the election petition for
non-compliance of the provisions of Sections 81 (petition filed beyond 45 days of period of
limitation) or Section 82 (non-joinder of necessary party) or Section 117 (non-deposit of a sum of
Rs.2000/- as security for cost of the election petition) of the Act. Section 83 stipulates that the
concise materials facts and full particular of any corrupt practices, if alleged in the petition, should
be disclosed. Apart from the provisions of Order 7 Rule 11 CPC, non-compliance of mandate of
Sections 81, 82, 83 and 117 of RPA, 1951 would be grounds of rejection of election petition on
co-joint reading of principles embodied in CPC and RPA, 1951.
[32] In the case of Hari Shanker Jain v. Sonia Gandhi, (2001) 8 SCC 233, Hon'ble Supreme Court
held that the provisions of Section 83(1)(a) of RPA, 1951 of disclosing material facts is mandatory
and its non-compliance, ie, failure to plead material facts is fatal to the election petition. Relevant
para are reproduced below:
23. Section 83(1)(a) of RPA, 1951 mandates that an election petition shall contain a
concise statement of the material facts on which the petitioner relies. By a series of
decisions of this Court, it is well settled that the material facts required to be stated
are those facts which can be considered as materials supporting the allegations made.
In other words, they must be such facts as would afford a basis for the allegations
made in the petition and would constitute the cause of action as understood in the
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. The expression "cause of action" has been
compendiously defined to mean every fact which it would be necessary for the
plaintiff to prove, if traversed, in order to support his right to the judgment of court.
Omission of a single material fact leads to an incomplete cause of action and the
statement of claim becomes bad. The function of MC(EP) NO. 87 OF 2022 IN EP NO.
23 OF 2022: USHAM DEBAN SINGH V. MD. FAJUR RAHIM 20 the party is to
present as full a picture of the cause of action with such further information in detail
as to make the opposite party understand the case he will have to meet.
(See Samant N. Balkrishna v. George Fernandez18, Jitendra Bahadur Singh v. Krishna Behari19.)
Merely quoting the words of the section like chanting of a mantra does not amount to stating
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/65953408/ 13
Usham Deben Singh vs Md Fajur Rahim Aged About 51 Years on 14 June, 2024
material facts. Material facts would include positive statement of facts as also positive averment of a
negative fact, if necessary. In V.S. Achuthanandan v. P.J. Francis20 this Court has held, on a
conspectus of a series of decisions of this Court, that material facts are such preliminary facts which
must be proved at the trial by a party to establish existence of a cause of action. Failure to plead
"material facts" is fatal to the election petition and no amendment of the pleadings is permissible to
introduce such material facts after the time-limit prescribed for filing the election petition.
24. It is the duty of the court to examine the petition irrespective of any written statement or denial
and reject the petition if it does not disclose a cause of action. To enable a court to reject a plaint on
the ground that it does not disclose a cause of action, it should look at the plaint and nothing else.
Courts have always frowned upon vague pleadings which leave a wide scope to adduce any evidence.
No amount of evidence can cure basic defect in the pleadings.
[33] In the case of C.P. John v. Babu M. Palissery, (2014) 10 SCC 547, Hon'ble Supreme Court
discussed the mandatory requirement of pleading all particulars of corrupt practices alleged in the
election petition under the provisions of Section 83(1)(b) of RPA, 1951 and on failure to plead the
material details of the alleged corrupt practices, such name of the persons involved, the time, date
and place of such corrupt practices, the election petition can be rejected at the threshold. Relevant
para are reproduced below:
18. When we read Section 83, the substantive part of Section 83(1) consists of three
important elements, namely, that an election petition should contain a concise
statement of material facts which MC(EP) NO. 87 OF 2022 IN EP NO. 23 OF 2022:
USHAM DEBAN SINGH V. MD. FAJUR RAHIM 21 an election petitioner relies
upon. The emphasis is on the material facts which should be stated in a concise form.
Under Section 83(1)(b) it is stipulated that the election petition should set forth full
particulars of any corrupt practice which is alleged by the petitioner. A reading of the
said Section 83(1)(b) is to the effect that such particulars should be complete in every
respect and when it relates to an allegation of corrupt practice it should specifically
state the names of the parties who alleged to have committed such corrupt practice
and also the date and place where such corrupt practice was committed. In other
words, the particulars relating to corrupt practice should not be lacking in any
respect. One who reads the averments relating to corrupt practice should be in a
position to gather every minute detail about the alleged corrupt practice such as the
names of the persons, the nature of the alleged corrupt practice indulged in by such
person or persons, the place, the date, the time and every other detail relating to the
alleged corrupt practice.
19. To put it differently, when the election petition is taken up for consideration, the
Court which deals with such an election petition, should be in a position to know in
exactitude as to what is the corrupt practice alleged as against the parties without
giving any room for doubt as to the nature of such allegation, the parties involved, the
date, time and the place, etc. so that the party against whom such allegation is made
is in a position to explain or defend any such allegation without giving scope for any
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/65953408/ 14
Usham Deben Singh vs Md Fajur Rahim Aged About 51 Years on 14 June, 2024
speculation. In that context, both Sections 83(1)(a) and (1)(b) and the proviso play a
very key role since the election petitioner cannot simply raise an allegation of corrupt
practice and get away with it, inasmuch as the affidavit to be filed in respect of
corrupt practice should specifically support the facts pleaded, as well as, the material
particulars furnished. Rule 94-A of the Rules in turn stipulates that the affidavit
should be in the prescribed Form
25 and should be sworn before the Magistrate of the First Class or a notary or the Commissioner of
Oaths and makes it mandatory for the election petitioner to MC(EP) NO. 87 OF 2022 IN EP NO. 23
OF 2022: USHAM DEBAN SINGH V. MD. FAJUR RAHIM 22 comply with the said requirement
statutorily. The format of the affidavit as prescribed in Form 25 elaborates as to the requirement of
specifically mentioning the paragraphs where the statement of facts are contained and also the other
paragraphs where material particulars relating to such corrupt practices are alleged. It also
mentions as to which of those statements of facts and material particulars are based on the personal
knowledge of the election petitioner and such of those statements and particulars that are made
based on the information gained by the election petitioner.
20. Therefore, a conspectus reading of Section 83(1)(a) read along with its proviso of the Act, as well
as, Rule 94-A and Form 25 of the Rules makes the legal position clear that in the filing of an election
petition challenging the successful election of a candidate, the election petitioner should take extra
care and leave no room for doubt while making any allegation of corrupt practice indulged in by the
successful candidate and that he cannot be later on heard to state that the allegations were generally
spoken to or as discussed sporadically and on that basis the petition came to be filed. In other
words, unless and until the election petitioner comes forward with a definite plea of his case that the
allegation of corrupt practice is supported by legally acceptable material evidence without an iota of
doubt as to such allegation, the election petition cannot be entertained and will have to be rejected
at the threshold. It will be relevant to state that since the successful candidate in an election has got
the support of the majority of the voters who cast their votes in his favour, the success gained by a
candidate in a public election cannot be allowed to be called in question by any unsuccessful
candidate by making frivolous or baseless allegations and thereby unnecessarily drag the successful
candidate to the court proceedings and make waste of his precious time, which would have
otherwise been devoted for the welfare of the members of his constituency. Therefore, while
deciding the issue raised, we wish to keep in mind the above lofty ideas, MC(EP) NO. 87 OF 2022 IN
EP NO. 23 OF 2022: USHAM DEBAN SINGH V. MD. FAJUR RAHIM 23 with which the provisions
contained in Section 83(1) read along with Section 86 came to be incorporated while deciding this
appeal.
[34] Section 81 of RPA, 1951 stipulates that an election petition shall be presented within 45 days
from the date of declaration of the result of the returned candidates. Chapter VII-A, Rule 1 of the
High Court of Manipur also prescribes that an election petition should be presented before the
Stamp Reporter of the Court within 45 days from the date of the election of the returned candidate.
In the case of Amin Lal v. Hunna Mal: AIR 1965 SC 1243, a 5-Judge Constitution Bench of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court held that under Section 81 of RPA, 1951, an election petition has to be
presented within 45 days from the date of election of the returned candidate. The same ratio is used
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/65953408/ 15
Usham Deben Singh vs Md Fajur Rahim Aged About 51 Years on 14 June, 2024
in the case reported as (2007) 1 SCC 770. None of the decisions held that the period of limitation is
counted up to the date of registration of the election petition. It has been consistently held that the
period of limitation for presenting election petition is 45 days from the date of election of returned
candidate. In the case of Chandrakant Shukla v. Martand Singh: (1973) 3 SCC 194, Hon'ble Supreme
Court specifically held that the election petition should be filed within 45 days of election of the
returned candidate.
[35] It may be pertinent to refer to the provisions of Section 83(2) of RPA, 1951 stipulating that any
schedule or annexures to the election petition shall also be signed by the petitioner and verified in
the same manner as the petition. This means that the petitioner has to sign and verify on each
annexure. This is the mandate of the statute. [36] On the basis of the above quoted provisions of
relevant statutes and decisions of the Apex Court, the objections are to be examined MC(EP) NO. 87
OF 2022 IN EP NO. 23 OF 2022: USHAM DEBAN SINGH V. MD. FAJUR RAHIM 24 whether these
are within the ambit of the provisions of Order 7 Rule 11 CPC read with Section 86(1) of RPA, 1951.
Decisions [37] The first objection is that the words "attested to be true copy"
have not been mentioned in the body of the petition while marking Annexures- A/1 to
A/7 and non-marking of the challan of depositing Rs.2000/- as an annexure in para
23 of the election petition. It is vehemently argued by Mr. M. Hemchandra, learned
senior counsel for the returned candidate that such non-compliance falls within the
vice of the provisions of Order 7 Rule 11 CPC read with Section 83(2) and Section 117
of RPA, 1951. This Court does not find any merit in the submission of Mr. M.
Hemchandra as the requirement of signature and verification as Section 83(2) of the
Act is on annexures appended to the petition and the challan for depositing of
Rs.2000/- as cost for security under Section 117 will not be a material document for
deciding the election petition. Mentioning about the deposit made under Section 117
of the Act in the petition enclosing the original copy of the challan is a sufficient
compliance of the mandate of section 117 of the Act. [38] The next important
objection raised is regarding non-disclosure of material facts with respect to the plea
of corrupt practice as alleged in para 15, 16 and 20 of the election petition. Mr. M.
Hemchandra, learned senior counsel for the returned candidate has vehemently
submitted that on minute reading of the pleadings in para 15, 16 and 20 of the
election petition would constitute plea of corrupt practice as there has be allegations
of collusion between election authority, voters and the returned candidate. However,
there is no particular of the instances of the corrupt practices and the same is not
supported by an affidavit as mandated under Section 83(1)(b) of the Act and its
proviso and the election petition is liable to be dismissed at the threshold. On
MC(EP) NO. 87 OF 2022 IN EP NO. 23 OF 2022: USHAM DEBAN SINGH V. MD.
FAJUR RAHIM 25 the other hand, Mr. N. Ibotombi, learned senior counsel for the
petitioner clarifies that the petitioner does not plead corrupt practice as one of the
grounds. On a plain reading of the election petition, the main grounds for challenge
are- (i) 30 non-voters of Wabagai A/C casted their votes as service voters, and (ii) 111
voters casted their votes physically as well as by means of ETPBS. The details of these
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/65953408/ 16
Usham Deben Singh vs Md Fajur Rahim Aged About 51 Years on 14 June, 2024
141 (30+111) voters are given in para 15 and 16 of the election petition. In para 20 of
the petition, the ground for challenge is mentioned as under
Section 100(1)(d)(iv) of RPA, 1951. In other words, the challenge is made on the
ground of non-compliance with the provisions of the Constitution of India or the
RPA, 1951 or any rules or orders made under the Act. It is seen from the pleadings
made in para 15, 16 and 20 that the grounds for challenge are voting by non-voters
and double voting by voters of the constituency. Plea of corrupt practice could not be
deciphered on plain readings of the petition. Moreover, material facts and particulars
of 141 illegal votes have clearly mentioned in para 15 and 16 of the petition.
Accordingly, the objection of non-disclosure of material facts specially the plea of
corrupt practice is rejected.
[39] The next plea is limitation. Mr. M. Hemchandra, learned senior counsel for the returned
candidate submits that the result was declared on 10.03.2022, the election petition was filed on
22.04.2022 and was registered on 30.04.2022. It is stated that there was a delay of 5 days in
registration of election petition and the word 'presented' used in Section 81 of RPA, 1951 should be
read as 'registered' and hence the election petition registered on 30.04.2022 is barred by 5 days.
[40] On perusal of the record, it is found that the election petition was filed on 22.04.2022 before
the Stamp Reporter of this Court and registered on 30.04.2022. Section 81 of the Act mandates that
the election petition be presented within 45 days from the date of MC(EP) NO. 87 OF 2022 IN EP
NO. 23 OF 2022: USHAM DEBAN SINGH V. MD. FAJUR RAHIM 26 declaration of result of the
returned candidate. As held in a catena of cases as referred above namely, Amin Lal (supra) and
Chandrakant (supra), the election petition is to be filed within 45 days from the date of result.
Reading the word 'presented' used in Section 81 as 'registered' will amount to judicial amendment.
This Court is of the opinion that the election petition filed on 22.04.2022 is within the stipulated
period of 45 days from the date of declaration of result on 10.03.2022. Accordingly, the objection on
the ground of limitation is also rejected.
[41] The next major objection is non-joinder of necessary party such as the election authority and 30
voters as mentioned in para 15 of the petition. As evident from reading of the provisions of Section
82 of RPA, 1951, it is seen that only candidates are the necessary parties in an election petition. This
Court is of the opinion that the provisions of CPC with regard to Order 1 Rule 9 will be excluded by
the provisions of Section 87 of the RPA, 1951. In case of any inconsistency, the provisions of the Act
will prevail upon the provisions of CPC. Accordingly, the objection of non-joinder of necessary party
is rejected. [42] This Court is of the opinion that the other objections raised by the returned
candidate on maintainability of the election petition do not fall within the purview of the provisions
of Order 7 Rule 11 CPC read with Section 86(1) of RPA, 1951 and the same are to be considered
during the trial.
[43] In view of the above discussions, this Court does not find any merit in the plea of
maintainability raised by the returned candidate. Accordingly, the application being MC(Election
Petition) No. 87 of 2022 in Election Petition No. 23 of 2022 filed by the returned candidate is
dismissed with a cost of Rs.30,000/- to be paid by the applicant/ MC(EP) NO. 87 OF 2022 IN EP
