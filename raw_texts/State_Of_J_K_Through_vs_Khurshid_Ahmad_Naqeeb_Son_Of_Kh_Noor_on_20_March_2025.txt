State Of J&K Through ... vs Khurshid Ahmad Naqeeb Son Of Kh Noor on 20 March, 2025
[„SKICC(cid:129)], arises out of an order and judgment dated 01.11.2019 passed by a learned Single Judge
of this Court ["the writ Court"] in SWP No. 809/2012 whereby the Writ Court has allowed the writ
petition of respondent No.1 and, by way of a writ of mandamus, declared condition (a) in the
Government Order No.216-TSM of 2014 dated 22-05-2014, impugned in the writ petition,
restricting the benefit of Defined Pension Rules 2014 [„Pension Rules of 2014(cid:129)] only to the
employees of appellant No.3 retiring on or after 01.01.2014, as non-est in law. The appellants are
also directed to release all the retiral benefits, including gratuity etc., due and payable to the
employees covered by the order dated 22.05.2014 (supra) in favour of respondent No.1 from the
date of his superannuation, i.e., 31.05.2010. The writ Court has also held the respondent No.1
entitled to interest at the rate of 6% per annum. 2 Before we advert to the grounds of challenge
urged by the learned counsel appearing for the appellants to assail the impugned judgment, we
deem it necessary to set out a few facts which are germane to the disposal of the controversy raised
in this appeal. 3 The case set up by the respondent No.1 in his writ petition, is that he was initially
appointed as Manager Administration and Secretary, Convention Centre, Srinagar vide Government
order No. 47-TSM of 1981 dated 04.06.1981. In the year 1998, he came to be appointed as Executive
Director, SKICC, Srinagar, vide Government order No.13-TSM of 1988 DATED 05.02.1988. The
post of Executive Director, SKICC came to be re-designated as Director SKICC vide Government
order No. 135- TSM of 1988 dated 31.08.1988. It was further claimed by the respondent No.1 that,
though Government Order 160-TSM of 1988 dated 28.09.1988 was categorical regarding the pay
scale and the annual increments, the respondent No. 1 was illegally and arbitrarily denied the
benefits of annual increments during the period from September 2000 to June 2009. The
respondent No.1 has, thus, claimed that an amount of Rs.3,25,080 is due and payable to him. As is
further pleaded, the respondent No.1 was transferred and posted as Managing Director, J&K
Tourism Development Corporation, vide Government order No. 1176-GAD dated 02.12.1996. He
was also posted as Vice Chairman, J&K Lakes and Waterways Development Authority [„J&K
LAWDA(cid:129)]. In the year 2002, the respondent No.1 was placed under suspension. However, upon
representation, he was reinstated vide Government order dated 06.07.2004. Upon reinstatement,
he was attached with General Administration Department and thereafter posted as Officer on
Special Duty in the Tourism Department. On 31.05.2010, the respondent No.1 attained
superannuation and retired from service. 4 The respondent No.1 was not accorded the benefit of
pension on the ground that, on the date of his retirement, SKICC was not a pensionable
organization. However, vide Government order dated 22.05.2014 (supra), the appellant No.1
accorded sanction to the adoption of Pension Rules of 2014 by SKICC, as applicable to the State
Government employees for the purpose of payment of pension, gratuity and other post-retiral
benefits. However, the said Government Order restricted the benefit of Pension Rules of 2014 only
to the employees of SKICC retiring on or after 01.01.2014. The respondent No.1 being aggrieved of
his exclusion from the benefit of Pension Rules of 2014, filed SWP No. 809/2012. At the time of
filing the writ petition, the Government Order dated 22.05.2014 (supra) had not yet come in
existence and, therefore, the respondent No.1 initially prayed for a writ of mandamus directing the
appellants herein to release his withheld retiral benefits, including gratuity and leave salary, etc.
However, during the pendency of the writ petition, Government order dated 22.05.2014 (supra)
came to be issued, and as a result whereof, the respondent No.1 amended his writ petition and
claimed the following reliefs:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108199193/ 2
State Of J&K Through ... vs Khurshid Ahmad Naqeeb Son Of Kh Noor on 20 March, 2025
"....(ii-a) Writ in the nature of mandamus or any other appropriate writ commanding
the respondents in particular respondent No.1 to treat the condition (a) in the
Government Order No. 216-TSM of 2014 dated 22.05.2014 restricting the benefit of
the Defined Pension Rules, 2014 only to the employees retiring on or after
01.01.2014, non-est in law, be also issued in favour of the petitioner and against the
respondents; and, (ii-b) Writ in the nature of mandamus or any other appropriate
writ commanding the respondents in particular respondent No.1 to admit forthwith
all the employees of the respondent No.4 to the benefit of Defined Pension Rules
adopted pursuant to the Cabinet Decision No. 76/06/2014 dated 21.05.2014 in
respect of the employees of respondent No. 4 vide Government order No. 216-TSM of
2014 dated 22.05.2014 be also issued in favour of the petitioner and against the
respondents".
5 The writ petition was contested by the Government as well as the appellants herein. In the reply
affidavit filed on behalf of General Administration Department (GAD), it was pleaded that the
respondent No.1 was initially appointed in SKICC as Manager Administration on a consolidated
salary and thereafter posted as Director, SKICC. The respondent No.1 was also transferred from
SKICC to JKTDC retaining his lien in his parent organization. It was, thus, pleaded that the
respondent No.1 belonged to SKICC and, therefore, his retiral benefits, if any, were to be settled by
the SKICC. In short, the claim of the respondent No.1 for post-retiral benefits was resisted by the
GAD on the plea that the respondent No.1 was an employee of SKICC, a Society registered under the
J&K Societies Registration Act and, therefore, his post-retiral benefits are required to be settled by
the SKICC itself. The claim of the respondent No.1 that he was a Government employee and,
therefore, entitled to post-retiral benefits on the analogy of Government employees serving in other
Departments was strongly refuted.
6 In the reply affidavit filed by the Department of Tourism under whose administrative control the
SKICC functions, it was pleaded that the respondent No.1 was initially appointed in SKICC in the
year 1981 at a consolidated pay of Rs.1100 per month and vide Government order No. 42-TSM of
1983 dated 06.07.1983, the ad hoc engagement of the respondent No.1 at a consolidated salary was
extended for a period of 18 months w.e.f 04.12.1981. Vide another order issued by the Government
dated 20.02.1984, the ad hoc engagement of respondent No.1 at a consolidated pay of Rs.1100 per
month was continued up to the end of March 1984. It was, thus, stated that while the respondent
No.1 was performing his duties as Manager Administration, SKICC, on an ad hoc basis and on a
consolidated pay, the Government, vide its order No. 166-GD of 1985 dated 16.01.1985, created a
post of Director, Sher-i-Kashmir Convention Complex, for a period of two years at a consolidated
salary of Rs.2400 per month. One Sh. Tariq Abdullah was appointed against the said post. In the
year 1988, the appellants issued Government order No. 160- TSM of 1988 dated 28.09.1988
releasing the pay scale of Rs.1850-2300 in favour of respondent No.1 w.e.f 11.04.1986 and allowed
him to work as Director, SKICC. As was pleaded by the Department of Tourism, the respondent No.1
also remained Administrator, Kashmir Golf Club, and Managing Director, JKTDC, on deputation
retaining his lien in his parent organization i.e, SKICC. The respondent No.1was also posted as Vice
Chairman, LAWDA in the year 2000 and was also directed to look after the affairs of International
Golf Course in addition to his own duties. On the basis of aforesaid averments made in the reply
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108199193/ 3
State Of J&K Through ... vs Khurshid Ahmad Naqeeb Son Of Kh Noor on 20 March, 2025
affidavit, it was claimed by the Department of Tourism, that the respondent No.1, having been
appointed in SKICC, remained an employee of SKICC.
7 In short, the stand of the Department of the Tourism, as can be culled out from the reply affidavit,
is that the respondent No.1 retired as an employee of SKICC, a Society registered under the J&K
Societies Registration Act, and that the employees of SKICC were not entitled to any pension in the
year 2010 when the respondent No.1 attained superannuation. 8 The writ Court, having regard to
the respective case set up by the parties and the rival contentions of the learned counsel
representing both sides, came to the conclusion that the fixation of the cut-off date, i.e., 01.01.2014,
in the Government Order dated 22.05.2014 (supra) restricting the benefit of pension only to the
employees of SKICC retiring on or after 01.01.2014, was arbitrary and violative of Article 14 of the
Constitution of India. The Writ Court, thus, concluded that the respondent No.1, though an
employee of SKICC, was entitled to the benefit of Pension Rules of 2014 promulgated vide
Government Order dated 22.05.2014 (supra). The writ Court, vide the judgment impugned, allowed
the writ petition, declared condition (a) of the impugned Government order as non-est in law, and
directed the appellants herein to release all retiral benefits in favour of the respondent No.1 in terms
of Government order dated 22.05.2014 w.e.f. his superannuation on 31.05.2010, along with interest
@ 6 %. The appellants, being aggrieved, have called the impugned order and judgment in question
before us in this appeal.
9 The impugned judgment is assailed by the appellants primarily on the following grounds:
(i) That the Writ Court has not properly appreciated the stand of the appellants taken
in their reply affidavits;
(ii) That the respondent No.1 was all along an employee of SKICC, a Society
registered under the Societies Registration Act and, therefore, the service conditions
of the employees, including the respondent No.1, were regulated by the bye-laws of
the society. It is urged that the writ Court did not appreciate the fact that the
respondent No.1 was not holding any pensionable post at the time of his retirement
and, therefore, was not entitled to any post-retiral benefits; and,
(iii) That the writ Court did not appreciate that the „Defined Pension Rules(cid:129), which
introduced pension benefits for the SKICC employees for the first time, vide
Government order dated 22.05.2014 (supra) restricted these benefits only to the
employees retiring on or after 01.01.2014. Since the respondent No.1 had retired on
31.05.2010, as such he was not held entitled to any pensionary benefits.
10 Per contra, Mr. R.A Jan, learned senior counsel assisted by Ms. Humaira Sajad, would support
the judgment of the writ Court on all fours. He submits that the fixation of cut-off date in the
impugned Government order for the purpose of giving the benefits of pension to the employees of
SKICC is totally arbitrary having no nexus with the object sought to be achieved. Relying upon
several judgments referred to by the Writ Court in the judgment impugned, Mr. Jan would argue
that fixation of cut-off date of 01.01.2014 for releasing the retiral benefits in favour of SKICC
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108199193/ 4
State Of J&K Through ... vs Khurshid Ahmad Naqeeb Son Of Kh Noor on 20 March, 2025
employees has resulted in discrimination against the respondent No. 1, who stood retired on
31.05.2010. The writ Court has properly appreciated the legal position and has come to the rescue of
the respondent No.1. He would, thus, urge this Court to uphold the judgment of the writ Court and
dismiss the appeal of the appellants as being without any substance and merit. Additionally, Mr. Jan
would also argue that, though the respondent No.1 had also raised the issue of his being a
Government employee at the time of his retirement, yet the writ Court did not advert to that aspect,
probably for the reason that it decided to grant relief to the respondent No.1 on other grounds.
11 Having heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the material on record, it is necessary
for us to understand the manner in which respondent No.1 came to be appointed in the SKICC,
which at the relevant point of time, was under the Department of Tourism. Several Government
orders issued on the subject need to be noticed herein-below:
(i) Vide Government order No. 1292-GD of 1981 dated 19.05.1981, a post of
Administrative Officer in the pay scale of Rs.750-1350 was created for Convention
Complex;
(ii) Vide Government order No. 47-TSM of 1981 dated 04.06.1981, the post of
Administrative Officer was re-designated as Manager Administration and Secretary.
Pending clearance from the Finance Department, the respondent No.1 was appointed to the said
post for a period of six months in the first instance on a consolidated salary of Rs.1100 per month.
Obviously, the engagement of respondent No.1 as Manager Administration and Secretary in SKICC
by the Government was without conducting any selection process in conformity with Articles 14 and
16 of the Constitution of India . The said Government order does not refer to the educational
qualification and experience, if any, possessed by respondent No.1 for holding the post;
(iii) Vide Government order No. 545-GD of 1982 dated 26.02.1982 sanction was accorded to the
deputation of respondent No.1 to proceed to Japan for six months for a fellowship programme.
(iv) Vide Government order No. 161-TSM dated 24.11.1982, the respondent No.1 was asked to take
over additional charge of the Project Director during latter(cid:129)s visit to Pakistan.
(v) Vide Government order No. 42-TSM of 1983 dated 06.07.1983, ex-post facto sanction was
accorded to the extension in the temporary appointment of respondent No.1 as Administration
Manager/Secretary of Convention Complex on an ad hoc basis on a consolidated pay of Rs.1100 per
month for a period of 18 months w.e.f 04.12.1981.
(vi) Vide government order No. 727-GD dated 17.05.1983, sanction was accorded to the deputation
of respondent No.1 to Philippine Convention Bureau and thereafter in the year 1984 to Kyoto
(Japan). Vide Government order No. 23-TSM dated 20.02.1984, another extension was accorded to
the ad hoc appointment of respondent No.1 up to the end of March 1984.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108199193/ 5
State Of J&K Through ... vs Khurshid Ahmad Naqeeb Son Of Kh Noor on 20 March, 2025
12 It seems that while the respondent No.1 was continuing as Manager Administration/Secretary
SKICC on an ad hoc basis, he came to be given the charge of General Manger, SKICC. However, no
such order posting the respondent No.1 as General Manager is placed on record by respondent No.1,
nor the same is traceable in the official record produced by the learned counsel appearing for the
appellants.
13 Vide Government order No. 13-TSM of 1988 dated 05.02.1988, sanction was accorded to the
conversion of SKICC into a registered society under the J&K Societies Registration Act. The said
Government order further provided that the Society will be controlled and run by a Board of
Governors to be nominated by the Governor, whereas the executive functions whereof would be
carried out by the Executive Director. By virtue of the aforesaid order itself, the respondent No.1,
who at the relevant point of time, was functioning as General Manger of SKICC, was allowed to work
against the post of Executive Director which post was later re-designated as Director SKICC vide
Government order dated 31.08.1988 (supra).While the respondent No.1 was holding the post of
Director SKICC, the appellants vide Government order No. 160-TSM of 1988 dated 28.09.1988
released the regular pay scale of Rs.1850-2300, in favour of respondent No.1 with starting salary of
Rs.2000 w.e.f 11.04.1986, with annual increments from time to time. From 05.03.1988, the
respondent No.1 was placed in the revised pay scale of Rs.3300-5050. The respondent No.1 was also
granted pay scale of Rs.700-1350 w.e.f 04.12.1981 to 15.04.1986, along with arrears. While holding
the post of Director, SKICC, the respondent No.1, as narrated above, came to be posted as Managing
Director, JKTDC and Vice Chairman LAWDA Srinagar on deputation basis retaining his lien in
SKICC. On 31.05.2010, the respondent No.1 retired on superannuation while holding the post of
Director SKICC, but while being attached with the GAD after his reinstatement from suspension.
14 From the above sequence of events, the following undisputed facts emerge:
(i) That respondent No.1 was never appointed on a substantive basis in SKICC, either a Government
department or later a registered society. The initial engagement of respondent No.1 as Manager
Administration/Secretary in the year 1981 was purely on ad hoc basis and on a consolidated salary
of Rs.1100 per month. The post held by the respondent No.1 was never filled up on a substantive
basis by following any regular selection process or otherwise. There is nothing on record of the
petition as also in the official record that the services of respondent No.1 were ever regularized
against any substantive post. From the official record, it is also not discernible as to what was the
educational qualification of respondent No.1. The only document which we found on record is a
Diploma of Matriculation Examination, Session 1966, on the basis whereof, we can presume that at
the time of his engagement as Manager Administration/Secretary in SKICC, the respondent No.1
was possessing the qualification of Matriculation;
(ii) That there are certain orders on record, which demonstrate that ad hoc engagement of
respondent No.1 was extended from time to time. The respondent No.1 was also deputed for
short-duration training programs outside India, even though he was not holding any substantive
post in the Government. Perhaps, this was the state of affairs during those years when „might is
right(cid:129) was the rule of law and the political dispensation was functioning in an autocratic manner,
picking up their blue eyed persons for manning the high positions in the Government. Be that as it
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108199193/ 6
State Of J&K Through ... vs Khurshid Ahmad Naqeeb Son Of Kh Noor on 20 March, 2025
may, by the dint of his proximity with the political bosses ruling the roost at that point of time,
respondent No.1 rose to the position of General Manager, SKICC; and
(iii) In the year 1988, when SKICC which was a part of Tourism Department was converted into a
Society registered under the Societies Registration Act, respondent No.1 was appointed as its first
Executive Director, later re-designated as Director. This is how the respondent No.1 rose to the
position of Director SKICC from his ad hoc appointment as Manager Administration/Secretary
without even becoming the permanent employee of the Government or SKICC.
15 As is apparent from the Government order dated 28.09.1988 (supra), all of a sudden and without
there being any justification, pay scale of Rs.1850-2300 came to be released in favour of respondent
No.1, that too, retrospectively. It is this Government order which is strongly relied upon by Mr. Jan
to contend that, w.e.f 04.12.1981, the services of the respondent No.1 came to be confirmed with the
release of a regular pay scale, firstly against the post of Manager Administration and thereafter as
Director SKICC. Although the Government order dated 28.09.1988 (supra) cannot be construed as
regularizing the services of respondent No.1, that too, with retrospective effect, yet even if we were
to assume that the said Government order confirms the services of the respondent No.1, it would
mean that from 04.12.1981 to 05.02.1988, the respondent No.1 could be treated as a Government
employee. However, with the SKICC being converted into a Society vide Government order No.
13-TSM of 19688 dated 05.02.1988 and with the simultaneous posting of respondent No.1 as
Executive Director SKICC, he ceased to be a Government employee and became an employee of the
Society.
16 From the above narration, it is quite evident that the respondent No.1 did retire while holding the
post of Director in SKICC, a Society registered under the Societies Registration Act. It is also beyond
any pale of discussion that on 31.05.2010, when the respondent No.1 attained superannuation as an
employee of the SKICC, he was not holding a pensionable post. The pensionary benefits in favour of
employees of the SKICC came to be sanctioned by the Government in terms of Government order
dated 22.05.2014 (supra), impugned in the writ petition, with a cut-off date of 01.01.2014. This
position has been accepted by the writ Court. The Writ Court has clearly proceeded on the
assumption that respondent No.1 retired as a employee of the Society and, therefore, in terms of
Government order impugned in the writ petition, he was not entitled to pensionary benefits for the
reason that he stood retired on 31.05.2010. The writ Court has, however, declared the cut-off date
mentioned in the impugned Government order as arbitrary and ultra vires the Constitution. That
being the clear position emerging from the reading of impugned judgment, our duty is now
circumscribed to determine only as to whether the cut-off date of 01.01.2014, mentioned in the
impugned Government order for grant of benefits under the Defined Pension Rules, is arbitrary and
ultra vires the Constitution. The writ Court has, however, held that the respondent No.1, having
served the appellants in different capacities over a period of time, cannot be denied the retiral
benefits, which, as per the writ Court, is a right available to an employee flowing from Article 31(1)
of the Constitution of India. The writ Court has found the classification between the employees of
the Society retiring prior to 01.01.2014 and the employees of SKICC retiring on and after 01.01.2014
to be arbitrary and discriminatory in nature. It is on this premise, the writ Court has allowed the
writ petition filed by respondent No.1.

State Of J&K Through ... vs Khurshid Ahmad Naqeeb Son Of Kh Noor on 20 March, 2025
17 Having considered the impugned judgment in light of the submissions made by learned counsel
appearing on both sides as also the written arguments submitted by learned counsel for respondent
No.1, it is seen that SKICC, which was earlier run by the Government, came to be converted into a
Society registered under the Societies Registration Act. Obviously, its employees were governed by
its bye-laws. Although the bye- laws have not been brought to our notice, yet from the minutes of
17th meeting of the Board of Governors of SKICC, held on 11.04.2021, it transpires that the bye-laws
of the SKICC did contain a provision stating that the employees of the Convention Centre shall be
entitled to pension and other retiral benefits. However, it took the Corporation almost 16 years to
implement this provision. There is no dispute with regard to the fact that even in the year 2010,
when the respondent No.1 retired on superannuation, the matter with regard to grant of pension to
the employees of Society was under consideration at different levels. However, the exercise
undertaken by the appellants to grant pensionary benefits to the employees of the SKICC reached
fruition only in the 2014 when the impugned Government order was issued by the Government
framing Redefined Pension Rules for the benefit of employees of the SKICC. The Government
having regard to various aspects decided to give the benefits of pension only to the employees
retiring on and after 01.01.2014.
18 It is true that the pension or post retiral benefits payable to an employee on superannuation, is
not a bounty to be granted by the employer but is a right vested in the employee, provided he holds a
pensionable post under the employer. It is not mandatory for the employer to make a provision for
payment of pension in the rules governing the service conditions of its employees. The employer
may, in its wisdom, opt to compensate his employee on superannuation by making a provision for
payment of GPF/CPF, gratuity, or other fixed sums. It is only where the rules governing the service
condition of an employee envisage grant of pension upon superannuation, the employer cannot
arbitrarily and without any authority of law withhold the same. It is only in this context, the
Hon(cid:129)ble Supreme Court, in its umpteen judgments, held that the right to receive pension is a vested
right of an employee and the same cannot be withheld by the employer by way of an executive fiat.
The mandate of judgments passed by the Supreme Court on this aspect, which have been elaborately
referred to by the Writ Court, do not lay down a thumb rule that all employees, irrespective of the
rules governing their service conditions, are entitled to pension and other retiral benefits. Rather,
these judgments unequivocally clarify that it is only in the cases where the rules governing the
service conditions of an employee envisage the pensionary benefits on superannuation, the same
cannot be denied or withheld by the employer without any justifiable reasons. The legal position
adumbrated in the judgment of the Supreme Court in Deokinandan Prasad vs. Slate of Bihar, AIR
1971 SC 1409 has not been appreciated by the writ Court in right perspective. With regard to right to
pension for an employee in the absence of service rules envisaging the benefit of pension, has
already been discussed by a Division Bench of this Court in State and others vs. Hamidullah Andrabi
and others, (LPA No. 10/2019 and other connected matters, decided on 11.11.2021, the relevant
extract whereof is reproduced hereunder:
"Right to pension is not a fundamental right guaranteed by any Article of Part III of
the Constitution of India. It is a mere condition of service. Whether or not an
employee of the Government or a Statutory Corporation is entitled to pension, is
determined by the terms and conditions of his employment. These terms and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108199193/ 8
State Of J&K Through ... vs Khurshid Ahmad Naqeeb Son Of Kh Noor on 20 March, 2025
conditions may be contractual or statutory in nature. No employee of the
Government or of any Public or Private Corporation can claim retirement pension de
hors the rules and regulations governing conditions of his service".
19 This brings us to the core question which arises for determination in this appeal: whether the
cut-off date of 01.01.2014, mentioned in the impugned Government order, is arbitrary and ultra
vires the Constitution. In D.S.Nakara and others vs. UOI, AIR 1983 SC 130, the Supreme Court, in
para (42) of the judgment, has summed up the principle of law in the following manner:
"If it appears to be undisputable, as it does to us that the pensioners for the purpose
of pension benefits form a class, would its upward revision permit a homogeneous
class to be divided by arbitrarily fixing an eligibility criteria unrelated to purpose of
revision, and would such classification be founded on some rational principle ? The
classification has to be based, as is well settled, on some rational principle and the
rational principle must have nexus to the objects sought to be achieved. We have set
out the objects underlying the payment of pension. If the State considered it
necessary to liberalise the pension scheme, we find no rational principle behind it for
granting these benefits only to those who retired subsequent to that date
simultaneously denying the same to those who retired prior to that date. If the
liberalisation was considered necessary for augmenting social security in old age to
government servants then those who retired earlier cannot be worst off than those
who retire later. Therefore, this division which classified pensioners into two classes
is not based on any rational principle and if the rational principle is the one of
dividing pensioners with a view to giving something more to persons otherwise
equally placed, it would be discriminatory. To illustrate, take two persons, one retired
just a day prior and another a day just succeeding the specified date. Both were in the
same pay bracket, the average emolument was the same and both had put in equal
number of years of service. How does a fortuitous circumstance of retiring a day
earlier or a day later will permit totally unequal treatment in the matter of pension ?
One retiring a day earlier will have to be subject to ceiling of Rs. 8,100 p a. and
average emolument to be worked out on 36 months' salary while the other will have a
ceiling of Rs. 12,000 p.a. and average emolument will be computed on the basis of
last ten months average. The artificial division stares into face and is unrelated to any
principle and whatever principle, if there be any, has absolutely no nexus to the
objects sought to be achieved by liberalising the pension scheme. In fact this arbitrary
division has not only no nexus to the liberalised pension scheme but it is counter
productive and runs counter to the whole gamut of pension scheme. The equal
treatment guaranteed in Art. 14 is wholly violated inasmuch as the pension rules
being statutory in character, since the specified date, the rules accord differential and
discriminatory treatment to equals in the matter of commutation of pension. A 48
hours difference in matter of retirement would have a traumatic effect. Division is
thus both arbitrary and unprincipled. Therefore the classification does not stand the
test of Article 14"

State Of J&K Through ... vs Khurshid Ahmad Naqeeb Son Of Kh Noor on 20 March, 2025
20 The judgment aforesaid essentially deals with the classification of pensioners in two classes for
the purpose of granting revised pension and, therefore, is rendered in a different context. In the
instant case, the cut-off date has been fixed for the purpose of giving the benefit of pension for the
first time to the employees of the Society. Prior to the promulgation of impugned Government order,
the services of SKICC were not pensionable and, therefore, the employees, who retired prior to
01.01.2014, did not receive any pension. It needs to be appreciated that the fixation of cut-off date,
in all cases, to some extent, would be somewhat arbitrary, but that alone would not be sufficient to
render it violative of the equality doctrine enshrined under Article 14 of the Constitution.
21. In National Council for Teacher Education vs.Shri Shyam Shiksha Prashikshan Sansthan, (2011)
3 SCC 238, the Supreme Court has clearly held that the cut-off date would not be declared illegal
unless „it is shown to be capricious or whimsical in the circumstances(cid:129). The Supreme Court has held
that a reasonable degree of latitude is required to be provided to the law-makers and, therefore,
when a cut-off date is fixed for the purpose of extending a benefit, it should not ordinarily be
interfered with by the judiciary. This was very aptly observed by the Supreme Court in the case of
State of Bihar and ors vs Ramjee Prasad and ors, (1990) 3 SCC 368, the relevant extract whereof is
reproduced hereunder:
"As pointed out by this Court the choice of date cannot be dubbed as arbitrary even if
no particular reason is forthcoming for the same unless it is shown to be capricious or
whimsical or wide off the reasonable mark. The same view was reiterated in Dr.
Sushma Sharma v. State of Rajasthan (1985) Supp. SCC 45, University Grants
Commission v. Sadhana Chaudhary (1996) 10 SCC 536, Ramrao v. All India
Backward 32 Class Bank Employees Welfare Association (2004) 2 SCC 76 and State
of Punjab v. Amar Nath Goyal (2005) 6 SCC 754".
22 In Union Of India vs S. R. Dhingra and Others, (2008) 2 SCC 229, the Supreme Court clarified
the legal position on the point in paragraph 25, which reads as under:
"It is well settled that when two sets of employees of the same rank retire at different
points of time, one set cannot claim the benefit extended to the other set on the
ground that they are similarly situated. Though they retired with the same rank, they
are not of the same class or homogeneous group. Hence Article 14 has no application.
The employer can validly fix a cut-off date for introducing any new
pension/retirement scheme or for discontinuance of any existing scheme. What is
discriminatory is introduction of a benefit retrospectively (or prospectively) fixing a
cut-off date arbitrarily thereby dividing a single homogenous class of pensioners into
two groups and subjecting them to different treatment (vide Col B.J. Akkara (Retd)
vs. Govt of India, (2006) 11 SCC 709, D.S. Nakara vs. Union of India (1983) 1 SCC
305, Krishna Kumar vs. Union of India (1990) 4 SCC 207, Indian Ex-Services League
vs. Union of India (1991) 2 SCC 104, V. Kasturi vs. Managing Director, State Bank of
India (1998) 8 SCC 30 and Union of India vs. Dr. Vijayapurapu Subbayamma (2000)
7 SCC 662)".

State Of J&K Through ... vs Khurshid Ahmad Naqeeb Son Of Kh Noor on 20 March, 2025
23 When we examine the case on hand in light of the legal position elaborately explained
hereinabove, we clearly find that the employees of the Society, including respondent No.1, who
retired prior to 01.01.2014, and the employees of SKICC, who retired or would retire on or after the
aforesaid date do not form a single homogeneous class. The employer is well within its right to
validly fix a cut-off date for introducing any new pension/retirement scheme or for discontinuing an
existing scheme. Simply because both sets of employees, i.e those who retired from SKICC prior to
01.012014 and those who retired thereafter, are retired employees of SKICC, is not a reason good
enough to place them in the same class or homogeneous group. Therefore, Article 14 would have no
application. As is held by the Supreme Court in S.R Dingra's case (supra), what is discriminatory is
the introduction of a benefit retrospectively or prospectively by fixing a cut-off date arbitrarily,
thereby dividing a single homogeneous class of pensioners into two groups and subjecting them to
different treatment. While considering a similar question as is posed before us, the Supreme Court,
in the case of Amar Nath Goyal (supra) held that a policy decision to restrict the benefit to persons
after a particular cut- off date on the basis of financial implications for implementation of such a
decision ought not to be considered discriminatory. 24 In the instant case, though the grant of
pension to the employees of the Society was mulled long back, but the same reached fruition only in
the year 2014. The Government, which exercises administrative control over SKICC, took a policy
decision to extend the benefit of pension to the employees of the Society who retired on or after
01.01.2014. The employees of the Society who stood retired at a time when they were not holding
any pensionable post and those who retired after the cut-off date when the Government order
impugned applied Redefined Pension Rules, form two different classes.
25 Viewed thus, we are of the considered opinion that the cut-off date fixed in the impugned
Government order of 2014, envisaging the benefit of pension in terms of the Defined Pension Rules
of 2014 for the employees retiring on or after 01.01.2014, is neither arbitrary, nor discriminatory.
The respondent No.1, who is amongst the employees who retired before 01.01.2014 form a class
different from the employees who have retired or would retire after 01.01.2014, and therefore,
Article 14 is not attracted.
26 For the foregoing reasons, we find merit in this appeal, and the same is, accordingly, allowed.
Consequently, the writ petition filed by the respondent No.1 is dismissed, and the impugned
judgment passed by the writ Court is set aside.
