3. Petitioner has annexed with the petition a compromise deed dated 22.12.2021 duly registered
before Notary, Jammu wherein respondent No.3 has stated that she does not want to pursue the FIR
No. 01/2017.
4. The instant petition is supported by affidavits of the petitioner.
5. Pursuant to the order dated 14.12.2022, the Registrar Judicial has recorded the statements of the
parties. The same are placed on record, which read as under:-
Statement of Yuvraj Kour (respondent No.3); Age; 46 years; D/o Avtar Singh R/o
Tarlokpur By Pass, Tehsil and District Jammu on oath today i.e 19.12.2022;
Stated, that I have amicably resolved all disputes and issues with Sham Lal (petitioner). A
compromise deed dated 14.12.2021 duly attested on 22.12.2021 by Notary Public, Jammu has also
been executed between us in this regard. Further, I have also no grievance against Sham Lal
(petitioner). In view of our compromise, I have no objection in case Hon'ble Court quashes FIR No.
01/2017 dated 12.01.2017 lodged at Police Station, Crime Branch, Jammu for commission of
offences under Sections 420, 466, 467, 468 and 120-B RPC.
Statement of Sham Lal (petitioner); Age; 60 years; S/o Sandauko Ram R/o Sunjwan,Tehsil Bahu,
District Jammu on oath today i.e 19.12.2022;
Stated, that I have amicably resolved all disputes and issues with Yuvraj Kour (respondent No.3). A
compromise deed dated 14.12.2021 duly attested on 22.12.2021 by Notary Public, Jammu has also
been executed between us in this regard. In view of our compromise, I pray before the Hon'ble Court
to quash FIR No. 1/2017 dated 12.01.2017 lodged at Police Station, Crime Branch, Jammu for
commission of offences under Sections 420, 466, 467, 468 and 120-B RPC.
6. Bare perusal of the statements of petitioner and respondent No.3 placed on record demonstrate
that the parties have entered into a compromise whereby they have settled their disputes/issues, so
there would be no chance of conviction in near future in case trial is held and concluded.
7. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that a Coordinate Bench of this Court has already
considered a similar issue in 561-A No. 345/2017 vide order dated 09.06.2017 wherein the petition
was allowed and the charge sheet and the proceedings against the petitioners therein were quashed
in non-compoundable offence on the basis of compromise. It is apt to reproduce operative part of
the said order as under:
"Offence under Section 307 RPC is also the offence relating to use of weapons by the
petitioners are non-
compoundable. However, it is stated that parties are next-door neighbours to each
other. They have buried the hatchets and want to live as friendly neighbours. Learned
counsel for the petitioners cites a judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of

Sham Lal vs Ut Of J&K & Ors on 10 February, 2023
"Narinder Singh & Ors. V. State of Punjab & Anr." 2014(2) Crimes (SC) Parties
having entered into a compromise, trial of the petitioners may not be fruitful. That
apart, it would be in the better interest of both the parties in case they are given
chance to materialize their intention to live as friendly neighbours. Allowing
compensation would be profitable as compared to continuing with the trial.
Viewed thus, this petition is allowed, the charge sheet and the proceedings against
the petitioners (supra) are quashed."
8. Learned counsel for the petitioner has also relied upon the judgment of Hon'ble the Apex Court
with regard to quashing of FIR in non-bailable offences on the grounds that parties have
compromised, has been given in the case titled CBI ACB Mumbai vs Narendra Lal Jain & Ors.,
reported in 2014(2) CRIMES SC-1, holding as under:
"6. We have heard Mr. P.P. Malhotra, learned Additional Solicitor General appearing
on behalf of the appellant and Mr. Sushil Karanjkar, learned counsel appearing on
behalf of Respondent Nos. 1 and 4.
7. Shri Malhotra, learned Additional Solicitor General, has taken us through the order
passed by the High Court. He has submitted that the High Court had quashed the
criminal proceeding registered against the accused- respondents only on the ground
that the civil liability of the respondents had been settled by the consent terms
recorded in the decree passed in the suits. Shri Malhotra has submitted that when a
criminal offence is plainly disclosed, settlement of the civil liability, though arising
from the same facts, cannot be a sufficient justification for the premature termination
of the criminal case. Shri Malhotra has also submitted that the offence under Section
120-B alleged against the accused-respondents is not compoundable under Section
320 Cr.P.C.; so also the offences under the PC Act. Relying on the decision of a three
Judges Bench of this Court in Gian Singh vs. State of Punjab and Another[1], Shri
Malhotra has submitted that though it has been held that the power of the High
Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C. is distinct and different from the power vested in a
criminal Court for compounding of offence under Section 320 of the Cr.P.C., it was
made clear that the High Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the
offences alleged before proceeding to exercise the power under Section 482 Cr.P.C.
Specifically drawing the attention of the Court to para 61 of the report in Gian Singh
(supra) Shri Malhotra has submitted that "any compromise between the victim and
the offender in relation to the offences under special statutes like the Prevention of
Corruption Act.... cannot provide for any basis for quashing criminal proceeding
involving such offences". Shri Malhotra had contended that having regard to the
gravity of the offences alleged, which offences are prima facie made out, in as much
as charges have been framed for the trial of the accused- respondents, the High Court
was not justified in quashing the criminal proceedings against the accused-
respondents.

8. Per contra, the learned counsel for the respondents (accused) have submitted that
the High Court, while quashing the criminal proceedings against the respondents
(accused), had correctly relied on the judgments of this Court in Central Bureau of
Investigation, SPE, SIU(X), New Delhi vs. Duncans Agro Industries Ltd., Calcutta[2]
and B.S.Joshi and Others vs. State of Haryana and Another[3]. Learned counsel has
submitted that though simultaneous criminal and civil action on same set of facts
would be maintainable, in Duncans Agro Industries Ltd. (supra) it has been held that
the disposal of the civil suit for recovery, on compromise upon receipt of payments by
the claimants, would amount to compounding of offence of cheating. No error is,
therefore, disclosed in the order of the High Court insofar as the offence under
Section 420 IPC is concerned. As for the offence under Section 120-B it is submitted
that this Court in B.S. Joshi (supra) has held that the power under Section 482
Cr.P.C. to quash a criminal proceeding is not limited by the provisions of Section 320
Cr.P.C. and even if an offence is not compoundable under Section 320 Cr.P.C., the
same would not act as a bar for the exercise of power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. As
the dispute between the parties have been settled on the terms of the compromise
decrees, it is submitted that the High Court had correctly applied the principles laid
down in B.S. Joshi (supra) to the facts of the present case.
9. Learned counsel has further pointed out that the charges framed against the accused-respondents
are under Section 120-B/420 of the Indian Penal Code and the respondents not being public
servants, no substantive offence under the PC Act can be alleged against them. The relevance of the
views expressed in para 61 of the judgment of this Court in Gian Singh (supra), noted above, to the
present case is seriously disputed by the learned counsel in view of the offences alleged against the
respondents. Learned counsel has also submitted that by the very same impugned order of the High
Court the criminal proceeding against one Nikhil Merchant was declined to be quashed on the
ground that offences under Sections 468 and 471 of the IPC had been alleged against the said
accused. Aggrieved by the order of the High Court the accused had moved this Court under Article
136 of the Constitution. In the decision reported in Nikhil Merchant vs. Central Bureau of
Investigation and Another[4] this Court understood the charges/allegations against the aforesaid
Nikhil Merchant in the same terms as in the case of the accused-respondents, as already highlighted.
Taking into consideration the ratio laid down in B.S. Joshi (supra) and the compromise between the
bank and the accused Nikhil Merchant (on the same terms as in the present case) the proceeding
against the said accused i.e. Nikhil Merchant was quashed by the Court taking the view that the
power and the Section 482 Cr.P.C. and of this Court under Article 142 of the Constitution cannot be
circumscribed by the provisions of Section 320 Cr.P.C. It is further submitted by the learned counsel
that the correctness of the view in B.S. Joshi (supra) and Nikhil Merchant (supra) were referred to
the three Judges Bench in Gian Singh (supra). As already noted, the opinion expressed in Gian
Singh (supra) is that the power of the High Court to quash a criminal proceeding under Section 482
Cr.P.C. is distinct and different from the power vested in a criminal court by Section 320 Cr.P.C. to
compound an offence. The conclusion in Gian Singh (supra), therefore, was that the decisions
rendered in B.S. Joshi (supra) and Nikhil Merchant (supra) are correct.

Sham Lal vs Ut Of J&K & Ors on 10 February, 2023
10. In the present case, as already seen, the offence with which the accused-respondents had been
charged are under Section 120-B/420 of the Indian Penal Code. The civil liability of the respondents
to pay the amount to the bank has already been settled amicably. The terms of such settlement have
been extracted above. No subsisting grievance of the bank in this regard has been brought to the
notice of the Court.
While the offence under Section 420 IPC is compoundable the offence under Section 120- B is not.
To the latter offence the ratio laid down in B.S. Joshi (supra) and Nikhil Merchant (supra) would
apply if the facts of the given case would so justify. The observation in Gian Singh (supra) (para 61)
will not be attracted in the present case in view of the offences alleged i.e. under Sections 420/120B
IPC.
11. In the present case, having regard to the fact that the liability to make good the monetary loss
suffered by the bank had been mutually settled between the parties and the accused had accepted
the liability in this regard, the High Court had thought it fit to invoke its power under Section 482
Cr.P.C. We do not see how such exercise of power can be faulted or held to be erroneous. Section
482 of the Code inheres in the High Court the power to make such order as may be considered
necessary to, inter alia, prevent the abuse of the process of law or to serve the ends of justice. While
it will be wholly unnecessary to revert or refer to the settled position in law with regard to the
contours of the power available under Section 482 Cr.P.C. it must be remembered that continuance
of a criminal proceeding which is likely to become oppressive or may partake the character of a lame
prosecution would be good ground to invoke the extraordinary power under Section 482 Cr.P.C.
9. In view of the above, this petition stands allowed.
10. Consequently, FIR No.1/2017 dated 12.01.2017 for the commission of offences punishable under
sections 420, 466, 467, 468 and 120-B RPC, registered at Police Station, Crime Branch, Jammu in
view of compromise arrived at between the parties stands quashed.
11. Copy of this order be sent to Incharge Police Station, Crime Branch, Jammu for compliance.
