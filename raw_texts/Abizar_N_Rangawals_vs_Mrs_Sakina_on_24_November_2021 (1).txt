maintenance of Rs.37,500/- was granted to the wife, protection order has also been granted and
compensation under Section 19 to an extent of Rs.10,00,000/- was also granted, which is exorbitant
and without any scientific method. She also drew my attention to the answer elicited in the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/16380014/ 4
Abizar N.Rangawals vs Mrs.Sakina on 24 November, 2021
cross-examination regarding position of partial share in the property and also stated that, at the
relevant point of time, the children were studying in a YGP Academy and thereafter, they moved to
the school run by the Bohra community. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.R.C.No.1097 of 2017
and
17. Per contra, Mr.V.Prakash, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the wife would contend that, in
view of the customary practice being prevalent in the Bohra Community in Muslim religion, divorce
has to be recorded in the Jamath, whereas even after obtaining the declaration of marriage between
one Sakin and Abizer N.Rangwala solemnized on 18.09.2005, which has been dissolved in
O.S.No.73 of 2012, by the learned II Additional Principal Judge, Family Court, Chennai. The
husband has not intimated to the Jamath and further, he has re-married and has two children
through the second marriage. Now, for the want of registration of declaration of Talaq, the wife is
unable to decide her future course of action in life.
18. The wife has also filed Crl.R.C.No.526 of 2015 before this Court for enhancement of sentence
awarded in C.C.No.1861 of 2012. The case arises out of the complaint given by the wife against the
husband and father in law and mother in law and the case has been registered and the same is filed
in against the order of the learned VII Metropolitan Magistrate wherein A1 and A2 were convicted
for the offence under Section 323 I.P.C with fine of Rs.1,000/- each and acquitted the accused under
Section 341 I.P.C. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.R.C.No.1097 of 2017 and
19. The case has been registered for an offence under Sections 341, 324, 498-A and 506(ii) read with
Section 34 of I.P.C., the learned Magistrate has held that A3/ mother in law has not committed the
offence, however, held that A1 and A2 have committed offence under Section 323 of the I.P.C and
accordingly, awarded the fine of Rs.1000/-
20. After considering the submissions made by Mr.V.Prakash, learned Senior Advocate appearing
for the wife and also the submissions of Mrs.Geetha Ramaseshan, learned counsel for the husband
in Crl.R.C.No1097 of 2012 and Dr.Krishnamurthy, learned counsel in Crl.R.C.No.526/2015, the
learned Magistrate, while dealing with M.C.No.3/2011 has considered the evidence of the wife and
also Exs.P10,11,12,15,16 and 17 and also Ex.R1 Income Tax Return filed by the husband. In the
appeal, additional documents were also marked.
21. After going through the finding rendered by both the Courts below, I find that the finding
rendered by the trial Court was confirmed by the Appellate Court in the appeal filed by the husband.
The wife underwent Domestic Violence in the shared house and the instance
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.R.C.No.1097 of 2017 and stated was in detail described by the
Lower Appellate Court clearly shows that the wife has been victim of repeated acts of Domestic
Violence in the hands of the revision petitioner/husband. Therefore, I find that the finding rendered
by the learned Magistrate, as confirmed by the Appellate Authority, the necessity for the protection
order on being satisfied and accordingly, the finding rendered by the Courts below that she was
subjected to Domestic Violence and compensation of Rs.10 lakhs has been granted, was confirmed
by the Lower Appellate Court.

Abizar N.Rangawals vs Mrs.Sakina on 24 November, 2021
22. On a perusal of the documents filed by both sides and also taking note of the fact that the
monthly maintenance awarded to the tune of Rs.37,500/- cannot be said to be excessive and also
Rs.17,000/- per year for the students for educational purpose of the minor also cannot termed as
excessive and hence I find that on both the score, the finding rendered by both the Courts below
appears to be just and fair assessment of maintenance.
23. On the point of compensation for domestic violence, I find that it is a higher side. Taking into
consideration the act of violence found to have been committed by the husband and in-laws, I find
that https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.R.C.No.1097 of 2017 and the same may be reduced to
Rs.7.5 lakhs to be payable within a period of two months. In all other respects, the order of
maintenance and order of educational expenses as ordered by the trial Court, is hereby confirmed.
The balance of the amount, has to be paid within a period of 3 months on equal installments, failing
which, the respondent/wife is entitled to move for appropriate orders before the learned Magistrate
Court.
24. (a) Since the Jamath is not a party before this Court, this Court is not expressing any opinion as
to the procedure adopted by the Bohra community in the Jamath. It is for the Jamath to decide the
future course of action in the matter of this kind.
(b) Taking into consideration the factual situation, as extracted supra, the wife should also be given
an option to make an entry of passing of the decree by the competent Civil Court for the entry in the
Jamath register and any such denial is being given to the Muslim Woman, I feel that the Woman's
right in the above stated situation cannot be denied on the ground of being woman. Right to declare
her marital status is a right of a woman.
(c) Such a right cannot denied on the ground of she being woman. The order of decree of dissolution
of marriage between the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.R.C.No.1097 of 2017 and parties
passed by the Family Court is binding upon the Jamath and thus, I find that in exercise of powers
conferred upon this Court under Section 482 of Cr.P.C., this Court directs the Jamath of Bohra
community situated in Chennai that the Jamath is hereby required to register the decree of divorce
passed by the competent Court in O.S.No.73 of 2012 between the parties so as to enable the wife to
decide the future course of action in her life which this Court feels that such a direction will meet the
ends of justice.
(d) As observed earlier, it is left open to the Jamath to decide the future course of action regarding
the procedure in the matters of this kind.
25. With these observations, Crl.R.C.No.1097 of 2017 filed by the husband, is partly-allowed to the
extent indicated above. Crl.R.C.No.526 of 2015:-
25. The trial Court on a consideration of the evidence, has come to the conclusion
that the evidence adduced by the prosecution is to infirm to hold the commission of
Section 498-A I.P.C and also Section 341I.P.C and accordingly, acquitted the accused
and convicted the accused for the offence under Section 323 sentenced to pay fine of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/16380014/ 6
Abizar N.Rangawals vs Mrs.Sakina on 24 November, 2021
Rs.1,000/- i.e., maximum fine that can be granted and hence, I find
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.R.C.No.1097 of 2017 and that Crl.R.C.No.526 of
2015 filed by the wife to enhance the punishment order passed in C.C., does not call
for any interference in the absence of any perversity in finding or irregular or
illegality in the proceedings of the learned Magistrate and in the absence of any
perversity, I find that the order passed by the learned Magistrate in CC.No. does not
call for interference and accordingly, this Criminal Revision petition is hereby
dismissed.
26. In the result,
(i) Crl.R.C.No.1097 of 2017 is partly allowed and the compensation of Rs.10,00,000/-
awarded by the learned Magistrate as confirmed by the Appellate Court is reduced to
Rs.7.5 lakhs. In all other aspects, the order passed under the Domestic violence Act is
hereby confirmed with a direction to the Jamath as stated in para 24.
(ii) Crl.R.C.No.526 of 2015 is dismissed.
