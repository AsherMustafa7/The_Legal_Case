THIS CRIMINAL PETITION IS FILED UNDER SECTION 482 OF
CR.P.C., SEEKING TO QUASH THE PROCEEDINGS AGAINST
PETITIONERS/ACCUSED NOS. 1 TO 6 AND 8 TO 9 IS CONCERNED
IN C.C.NO.2338/2015 (CRIME NO.11/2015) PENDING ON THE FILE
OF THE JMFC II COURT, HUBBALLI, FOR THE OFFENCE
PUNISHABLE UNDER SECTION 78 (3) OF KARNATAKA POLICE ACT
1963.
THESE PETITIONS HAVING BEEN HEARD AND RESERVED
FOR ORDERS ON 23.03.2018 AND COMING ON FOR
PRONOUNCEMENT OF ORDERS THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE
FOLLOWING:
: 28 :
COMMON ORDER
In this batch of petitions, the petitioners have sought to quash the criminal proceedings initiated
against them for the alleged offences punishable under Sections 78(3) of the Karnataka Police Act,
1963 ('the KP Act', for short) on the ground of non-compliance of the mandatory requirements
prescribed under Section 155(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
2. (i) The common contentions urged in all these petitions are that, the offence alleged against the
respective petitioners is a non-cognizable offence and by virtue of the safeguard provided under
Section 155(2) of Cr.P.C., the respondent - Police could not have embarked upon investigation into
the alleged offence, without the order of a Magistrate having power to try such case.
(ii) In Support of this contention, the learned counsel has referred to the decisions of this Court in
the case of Nabisab S/o Shek Imamsab V/s State of Karnataka (Crl.P.3365/2016 and connected
matters disposed on 07.04.2017) as well as the other decisions rendered by this Court in the Case of
Sharath @ Salim V/s The State of Karnataka (Crl.P.No.101833/2015 and connected petitions
disposed on 18.12.2015), wherein this Court following the decision passed by this Court in batch of
petitions in Crl.P.No.100319/2014 has held that non-compliance of the mandatory requirements
under Section 155(2) of Cr.P.C. would render the proceedings illegal and invalid.

Sri. Babasaheb Khutubuddin Nadaf vs The State Of Karnataka on 26 April, 2018
(iii) The learned counsel has also produced a copy of the order passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court
of India in S.L.P.Nos.8567-8580/2016 arising out of the common order passed by this Court in
Crl.P.No.100319/2014. The said S.L.P.Nos.8567-8580/2016 is dismissed by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court of India, thereby confirming the orders passed by this Court in Crl.P.No.100319/2014.
3. In Crl.P.No.3365/2016 and connected matters, this Court followed the decision rendered by the
Coordinate Bench of this Court in Moin Basha Kurnooli Vs. The State of Karnataka by Cowl Bazaar
Police Station, Bellary, reported in 2014(4) KCCR 3355, wherein on analysing the relevant
provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Karnataka Police Act, 1963, it is held that the
offence under Section 78(3) of the KP Act is a non-cognizable offence, the investigation whereof by a
Police Officer is prohibited without prior order of the concerned Magistrate. Further this Court has
laid down that the provisions of Section 155(2) of Cr.P.C. is mandatory in nature and failure to
comply with the said mandatory requirement is an incurable defect amounting to illegality vitiating
the entire proceedings.
4. In Praveen Basavanneppa Shivalli Vs. State of Karnataka and Others reported in 2017(1) AKR
461, this Court has laid down that a mere endorsement made by the Magistrate on the application
submitted by the Police Officer under Section 155 of Cr.P.C. as "permitted" is not an "order" in the
eye of law and on that ground also, the proceedings initiated against the accused are rendered illegal
and are liable to be quashed.
5. Undisputedly, in all these proceedings, the FIR came to be registered against the petitioners on
the basis of the complaint lodged by the Inspector of the Police of the respective police stations
alleging that on receipt of credible information that the accused herein were involved in playing a
game of chance by name Matka and were soliciting customers for the said purpose, the PSI of the
respective police stations made an application to the concerned Magistrate seeking permission to
investigate into the matter and thereafter rushed to the spot along with his team and the panchas
and found the accused engaged in the alleged activities, and accordingly, panchanamas were drawn
at the spot and incriminating materials were seized from the spot of occurrence and FIRs were
registered against the respective accused persons alleging commission of offence punishable under
Section 78(3) of KP Act.
6. The details of the cases registered against the petitioners, respective crime Nos. and the date of
the FIR and the endorsement made by the concerned Magistrate on the application submitted by
the complainant are detailed in the table hereinbelow:

Court, Kasabapeth Hubballi P.S.
7. Undeniably, the offence alleged in each of the above cases is a non-cognizable offence. Section 155
of the Cr.P.C. deals with the procedure of Investigation and cognizance of non-cognizable cases. It
reads as under:
"Section 155 Information as to non-cognizable cases and investigation of such cases.
(1) When information is given to an officer in charge of a police station of the
commission within the limits of such station of a non- cognizable offence, he shall
enter or cause to be entered the substance of the information in a book to be kept by
such officer in such form as the State Government may prescribe in this behalf, and
refer the informant to the Magistrate. (2) No police officer shall investigate a non-
cognizable case without the order of a Magistrate having power to try such case or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119605831/ 28
Sri. Babasaheb Khutubuddin Nadaf vs The State Of Karnataka on 26 April, 2018
commit the case for trial. (3) Any police officer receiving such order may exercise the
same powers in respect of the investigation (except the power to arrest without
warrant) as an officer in charge of a police station may exercise in a cognizable case.
(4) Where a case relates to two or more offences of which at least one is cognizable,
the case shall be deemed to be a cognizable case, notwithstanding that the other
offences are non- cognizable."
8. As per the above provision, when an Officer-in- charge of the police station received the
information as to the commission of non-cognizable offence, (i) he shall enter or caused to be
entered the substance of the information in a book to be maintained by the said Officer in a
prescribed form and (ii) refer the informant to the Magistrate. Further, Sub-Section (2) of Section
155 Cr.P.C. mandates that no Police Officer shall investigate a non-cognizable offence without the
order of a Magistrate having power to try such case or commit such case for trial.
9. In the instant case, the respondent police have utterly failed to comply with the requirements laid
down in Section 155(1) and 155(2) of Cr.P.C. Reading of the complaints lodged in each case indicate
that on receipt of information, the complainant informed the matter to his superior officer and
thereafter made separate applications to the concerned Magistrate seeking necessary order for
investigation into the allegations. But before securing the necessary "order", the complainants in the
above cases, rushed to the spot and commenced investigation even without registration of the FIR as
mandated under Section 154 of Cr.P.C. There is nothing on record to show that the respondent has
referred the informant to the concerned Magistrate as required under Section 155(1) of Cr.P.C. or
obtained necessary order as envisaged under Section 155(2) of Cr.P.C. before embarking upon
investigation. Thus, on the face of it, the respondents are seen to have committed blatant violation
of the provisions of Sections 155(1) and 155(2) of Cr.P.C.
10. The learned HCGP appearing for the State, however, has tried to take shelter under the
endorsement obtained by the respondents - Police on the applications wherein, the learned
Magistrate is seen to have made an endorsement as "permitted". It is argued that this is substantial
compliance of the requirements laid down under section 155 of Cr.P.C. It is the submission of the
learned HCGP that, in the decision referred to by the learned counsel for the petitioner, in Moin
Basha Karnooli Vs. State of Karnataka (2014 (4) KCCR 3355, as well as in Sharath @ Salim Vs. The
State of Karnataka (Crl.P.No.101833/2015 & connected matters), the Investigating Officer failed to
submit the necessary application and did not obtain any order from the concerned Magistrate and in
that circumstance, this Court found it appropriate to quash the proceedings on the ground that the
Police failed to comply with the mandatory requirements prescribed under Section 155(2) of Cr.P.C.
In other words, the submission of the learned HCGP is that, in the instant case, by making necessary
application to the concerned Magistrate, the respondents have substantially complied with the
requirements of Section 155 of Cr.P.C. and therefore, there is no irregularity much less any illegality
whatsoever in the action initiated by the respondents against the petitioners.
11. I am unable to accept the contention urged by the learned HCGP. This contention has already
been considered by this Court in the case of Praveen B. Shivalli (supra). Even in the said case,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119605831/ 29
Sri. Babasaheb Khutubuddin Nadaf vs The State Of Karnataka on 26 April, 2018
endorsement was made by the learned Magistrate on the application submitted by the police as
"permitted". Considering the purport of the above provision and the purpose and object of
prescribing such a pre-requisite, this Court in para 15 of the aforesaid judgment has observed as
under:
"15. In the present case, 2nd respondent having acted contrary to sub-section (1) of
Section 155 Cr.P.C. and the learned Magistrate having not passed 'an order', instead,
having made an entry 'permitted', being not 'an order' in the eye of law and in view of
the prohibition contained in sub-section (2) of S.155 Cr.P.C., the investigation; made
and the consequential charge-sheet filed for the offences under Ss.504, 506 and 323
of IPC and the taking of cognizance of those offences and the issue of non-bailable
warrant in the first instance itself for proceeding further with the case against the
accused are absolutely illegal. It is obvious that the police and the Magistrate have
not bothered to look into S.155 Cr.P.C. before proceeding further in the matter. Non
application of mind and mechanical approach to the case are apparent."
12. In view of the above factual and legal defects which amount to incurable illegalities and blatant
violation of the mandatory requirements of law, all the above proceedings are liable to be quashed.
13. Resultantly, all the petitions are allowed. the FIRs filed in all the above cases as detailed in the
table hereinabove at para 6 and consequent proceedings arising therefrom are hereby quashed.
