3. It is contended that after due deliberation it was ultimately decided to challenge the judgment
dtd.
26.12.2017 in question by filing the appeal in terms of the provisions contained under Section-24-C
of the Odisha Education Act, 1969 and the appeal was filed on 25.01.2019. With regard to
condonation of delay in filing the appeal, the following stand has been taken by the appellants in
Para-2 to 4 of the interim application which are reproduced hereunder:-
"2. That the statutory provisions of Section 24-C of the Orissa Education Act, 1969
requires for filing of Appeal within 60 days from the date of passing of the judgment.
The judgment passed by the learned State Education Tribunal on 26.12.2017 was
applied on 26.12.2017 which was delivered on 29.12.2017. The same was received in
the office of the Appellant No.1 on 12.01.2018 from the Govt. Advocate, State
Education Tribunal vide his Letter No.128 (2)/AGA (SET), dtd.10.01.2018. It was
diarized vide Dy.
No.3194/HE/2018, dtd.20.01.2018. Immediately thereafter, the Director, Higher Education was
requested by the Office of the Appellant No.1 vide letter No.3205/HE, dtd.05.02.2018 to furnish a
report indicating eligibility of the Respondent No.1 for the purpose of Grant-in-Aid as per GIA
Order, 1994. The Director, Higher Education examined such eligibility of the Respondent No.1 and
on verifying the service documents provided by the college and upon such verification report he
submitted the memorandum vide his letter No.30443, dtd.21.08.2018. The same was received in the
office of the appellant no.1 on 21.08.2018 and was diarized vide Dy. No.41532/HE, dtd.29.08.2018.
The eligibility of the Respondent No.1 was examined in the // 3 // Administrative Branch on
15.09.2018 and the file was sent to the Branch Officer on 15.09.2018. However, the proposal
regarding filing of FAO at the initial stage and thereafter to obtain ex post facto concurrence of Law
Department was approved by the Appellant No.1 on 15.09.2018. The Administrative Branch
thereafter placed the file on 20.09.2018 for approval of the Branch Officer to send request letter to
the office of the Advocate General, Odisha, Cuttack. Such proposal was approved on 24.09.2018.
Since, certain vital documents pertaining to continuance of the Respondent No.1, documents
relating to selection procedure and other important documents relied upon by the appellants could
not be traced out, were collected from the concerned quarters. After the same were collected as on
31.12.2018, the Administrative Branch sent relevant request proposal to the office of the Advocate
General vide Letter No.635/HE, dtd.09.01.2019.
3. That, the proposal sent by Administrative Department was received in the O/O the Advocate
General on 14.1.2019. The concerned proposal was placed before the Ld. Advocate General on
14.1.2019. The Ld. Advocate General entrusted the job of preparation of FAO and filing of the later
to the concerned Addl. Government Advocate on 15.1.2019. However, some delay was occurred in

An Appeal Under Section-24-C Of The ... vs Deepak Ku. Swain & Another on 7 March, 2024
processing the matter in the office of the Advocate General due to cease work call given by the
Lawyers' Association in the Hon'ble High Court.
4. That, the Ld. Addl. Govt. Advocate vide his letter dtd.16.1.2019 call for the officer well aware of
the issue to take up discussions in the matter for finalizing the FAO grounds. Sri Pranabandhu Rout,
Deputy Secretary was authorized for the purpose in the Administrative Department who attended
the Office chamber of the concerned Addl. Government Advocate on 24.1.2019 and held discussions
for the purpose with the Ld. Addl. Govt. Advocate on 24.01.2019 and as per discussions held, the
draft FAO was prepared by the Ld. Addl. Govt. Advocate concerned in the Office of the Advocate
General, Odisha, Cuttack on 24.01.2019. The draft FAO grounds were verified and it was finalized
on 25.1.2019. The finalized FAO memorandum was filed on 25.01.2019 wherein a delay of 334 days
occurred which is calculated excluding the period of 60 days available u/s 24(C) of Orissa Education
Act, 1969 and the duration consumed by the Tribunal to supply the certified copy of the impugned
judgment in filing an appeal against the orders passed by Ld. State Education Tribunal".
3.1. Placing reliance on the stand taken in Para-2 to 4 of the I.A, learned State Counsel contended
that the order passed by the Tribunal on 26.12.2017 after being received was duly proceeded and the
Department while approved the // 4 // proposal decided to challenge the judgment by filing the
appeal on 15.09.2018. The appeal thereafter was filed on 25.03.2019. It is accordingly contended
that the delay in filing of the appeal since is neither intentional nor deliberate, rather a bona fide
one, the delay in filing of the appeal is required to be condoned.
3.2. In support of his submission, learned counsel appearing for the Appellants relied on the orders
passed by the Hon'ble Apex Court on 22.11.2019 in SLP (Civil) Diary Nos.33245 of 2018 and similar
SLPs.
It is contended that in all the aforesaid orders, Hon'ble Apex Court was pleased to condone the delay
in filing the Special Leave Petition by imposing a cost of Rs.50,000/- on the State. Order passed in
SLP (Civil) Diary No.33245 of 2018 and other SLPs are reproduced hereunder:-
"Delay condoned.
Subject to the Petitioner-State depositing a sum of Rs.50,000/- (Rupees fifty
thousand only) in the Registry of this Court within four weeks from today, issue
notice, returnable on 13.01.2020, Dasti service, in addition, is permitted.
If the amount is not deposited within the stipulated time, the special leave petition
shall stand dismissed without further reference to the Court.
Upon deposit, the amount shall be invested in a fixed deposit receipt with a
nationalized bank initially for a period of 90 days with auto renewal facility.

Diary No.33248/2018; Diary No.33650/2018; Diary No.39345/2018;
Diary No.39309/2018; Diary No.39347/2018; Diary No.39352/2018 Diary
NO.31098/2019; and Diary No.33665/2019 Mr. Ashok Parija, learned Senior
Counsel invited out attention to the judgment and order dated 16.09.2019 passed in
Civil Appeal No.7295 of 2019 and all other connected matters. The issue involved in
the matter was set out in para 1 of the said judgment as under:
"1. The question involved in the appeals is whether the employees are entitled to
claim grant-in-aid as admissible under the Orissa (Non-Government Colleges, Junior
Colleges and Higher Secondary Schools) Grant-in-aid Order, 1994 (hereinafter
referred to as the ' the order of 1994), after its repeal in the year 2004 by virtue of
provisions contained in Orissa (Non-government Coleges, Junior Colleges and
Higher secondary Schools) Grant-in-aid Order, 2004 (hereinafter referred to as the
'the order of 2004'). The order of 2004 has also been repealed by Orissa (Aided
Colleges, Aided Junior Colleges, and Higher Secondary Schools) Grant-in-aid Order,
2008."
The conclusion drawn by the Court as set out in para 31 was as under:
"31. It is apparent on consideration of Paragrapha 4 of order of 2004 that only saving
of the right is to receive the block grant and only in case grant in aid had been
received on or before the repeal of the Order of 2004, it shall not be affected and the
Order of 1994 shall continue only for that purpose and no other rights are saved.
Thus, we approve the decision of the High Court in Lok Nath Behera (supra) on the
aforesaid aspect for the aforesaid reasons mentioned by us."
Relying on the aforesaid observations, it is submitted that the only right that was saved was to
receive the block grant and only in case the grant-in-aid was received on or before the repeal of the
Order of 2004. It is further submitted that the decision of the High Court in Loknath Behera was
approved by this Court. Exactly contrary situation has now been accepted by the High Court in the
orders presently under appeal.
We must however state that the matters were disposed of by the High Court as the petition in every
case was delayed by at least 800 days. In the circumstances, we pass following order:-
a) Delay condoned.

Subject to the petitioner-state depositing a sum of Rs.50,000/- (Rupees fifty thousand only), to the
account of // 6 // every petition in the Registry of this Court within four weeks from today, let

b) If the amount is not deposited within the stipulated time, the special leave petitions shall stand
dismissed without further reference to the Court.
c) Upon deposit, the amount shall be invested in a fixed deposit receipt with a nationalized bank
initially for a period of 90 days with auto renewal facility.
Mr. Subhasish Mohanty, learned Advocate-on-Record, who has appeared on behalf of Caveator/
Sole respondent in SLP (Civil) Diary No.31098 of 2019, accepts notice on behalf of sole respondent.
He prays for and is granted three weeks' time to put in affidavit in reply.
Rejoinder, if any, be filed within two weeks' thereafter.
List all the matters on 213.01.2020".
3.3. Learned State Counsel also relied on the decision rendered by the Hon'ble Apex Court on
09.10.2023 in Civil Appeal No.5867 of 2015 (Sheo Raj Singh (Deceased) Through Lrs. & Ors. vs.
Union of India & Anr.) Placing reliance on the decision in Sheo Raj Singh as provided under
Section-5 of the Limitation Act, it is contended that, the term sufficient cause is elastic enough for
Courts to do substantial justice. Further, when substantial justice and technical considerations are
pitted against one and another, the former would prevail. Since in the present case the Tribunal
allowed the claim of the respondent without following the decision of this Court in the case of
Laxmidhar Pati vs. State of Orissa & Others (1996) (I) OLR- 152 as well as other decisions rendered
by this Court, in view of the ratio decided in the case Sheo Raj // 7 // Singh and the order passed by
the Hon'ble Apex Court in SLP (Civil) Diary No.33245 of 2018, 38574 of 2015 and 11604 of 2020 in
condoning the delay, subject to payment of cost of Rs.50,000/- the delay in filing of the present
appeal is required to be condoned as substantial question of law is involved.
3.4. Hon'ble Apex Court in Para-31(b) and 37 of the Judgment in Sheo Raj Singh has held as
follows:-
"31.b. The expression sufficient cause is elastic enough for courts to do substantial
justice. Further, when substantial justice and technical considerations are pitted
against one another, the former would prevail".

37. Having bestowed serious consideration to the rival contentions, we feel that the
High Court's decision to condone the delay on account of the first respondent's
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/39037311/ 5
An Appeal Under Section-24-C Of The ... vs Deepak Ku. Swain & Another on 7 March, 2024
inability to present the appeal within time, for the reasons assigned therein, does not
suffer from any error warranting interference. As the aforementioned judgments
have shown, such an exercise of discretion does, at times, call for a illiberal and
justice-oriented approach by the Courts, where certain leeway could be provided to
the State. The hidden forces that are at work in preventing an appeal by the State
being presented within the prescribed period of limitation so as not to allow a higher
court to pronounce upon the legality and validity of an order of a lower court and
thereby secure unholy gains, can hardly be ignored. Impediments in the working of
the grand scheme of governmental functions have to be removed by taking a
pragmatic view on balancing of the competing interests".
4. Mr. N.K. Sahu, learned counsel appearing for the Respondent on the other hand made his
submission contending inter alia that even though G.I.A Case was disposed of by the Tribunal vide
judgment dtd.26.12.2017, // 8 // but the present appeal was only filed on 25.01.2019, with delay of
around 331 days. But no sufficient cause has been shown by the State-Appellant for such inordinate
delay, save and except taking a plea that after receipt of the judgment, the Department while
processing the claim of Respondent No.1, took a decision to file the appeal on 15.09.2018. Even
though decision was taken to file the appeal on 15.09.2018, but the appeal was only filed on
25.01.2019, without assigning any sufficient cause, save and except procedural delay.
4.1. It is contended that neither in the Interim Application nor in the memo of appeal, sufficient
cause has been assigned with regard to delay of around 331 days. It is accordingly contended that
since the delay in filing the appeal has not at all been explained by assigning sufficient cause, the
delay in filing of the appeal is not required to be condoned by this Court as prayed for.
4.2. Learned counsel appearing for the Respondent also contended that the delay in filing the appeal
has not been properly explained by showing sufficient cause and in view of the decision of the
Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Postmaster General & Ors. Vs. Living Media Ltd. & Anr. ((2012) 3
SCC 563) and the decision of this Court in State of Odisha & Ors. Vs. Sales Tax Officer, Cuttack II //
9 // (W.P.(C) No. 15763 of 2021), the delay is not required to be condoned.
4.3. Hon'ble Apex Court in Para 27 and 29 of the Judgment in the case of Postmaster General & Ors.
has held as follows:-
"27. It is not in dispute that the person(s) concerned were well aware or conversant
with the issues involved including the prescribed period of limitation for taking up
the matter by way of filing a special leave petition in this Court. They cannot claim
that they have a separate period of limitation when the Department was possessed
with competent persons familiar with court proceedings. In the absence of plausible
and acceptable explanation, we are posing a question why the delay is to be condoned
mechanically merely because the Government or a wing of the Government is a party
before us.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/39037311/ 6
An Appeal Under Section-24-C Of The ... vs Deepak Ku. Swain & Another on 7 March, 2024
29. In our view, it is the right time to inform all the government bodies, their agencies
and instrumentalities that unless they have reasonable and acceptable explanation
for the delay and there was bona fide effort, there is no need to accept the usual
explanation that the file was kept pending for several months/years due to
considerable degree of procedural red tape in the process. The government
departments are under a special obligation to ensure that they perform their duties
with diligence and commitment. Condonation of delay is an exception and should not
be used as an anticipated benefit for the government departments. The law shelters
everyone under the same light and should not be swirled for the benefit of a few."
Similarly this Court in the case of State of Odisha & Ors in Para -5 has held as follows:-
"5. The Supreme Court has recently in a series of matters reiterated that the explanation usually
offered by the State and its entities for the delay on account of administrative exigencies should not
be // 10 // accepted unless they are shown to be justified. A sampling of such orders is as under:
(i) Order dated 13th January 2021 in SLP No.17559 of 2020 (State of Gujarat v.
Tushar Jagdish Chandra Vyas & Anr.)
(ii) Order dated 22nd January 2021 in SLP No.11989 of 2020 (The Commissioner of Public
Instruction & Ors. v.
Shamshuddin)
(iii) Order dated 22nd January 2021 in SLP No.25743 of 2020 (State of Uttar Pradesh & Ors v.
Sabha Narain & Ors.)
(iv) Order dated 4th February 2021 in SLP No.19846 of 2020 (Union of India v.
Central Tibetan Schools Admin & Ors)
(v) Order dated 11th January 2021 in SLP No.22605 of 2020 (The State of Odisha & Ors v. Sunanda
Mahakuda)"
4.4. Learned counsel appearing for the Respondent also relied on the decision in the
case of State of Uttar Pradesh & Others vs. Sabha Narain & Others reported in (2022)
9 SCC 266 . Hon'ble Apex Court in Para-3 to 5 of the said judgment has held as
follows:-
"3. We have repeatedly discouraged State Governments and public authorities in
adopting an approach that they can walk in to the Supreme Court as and when they
please, ignoring the period of limitation prescribed by the statutes, as if the
Limitation statute does not apply to them. In this behalf, suffice to refer to our
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/39037311/ 7
An Appeal Under Section-24-C Of The ... vs Deepak Ku. Swain & Another on 7 March, 2024
judgments in State of M.P. v. Bherulal [State of M.P. v. Bherulal, (2020) 10 SCC 654 :
(2021) 1 SCC (Cri) 117 : (2021) 1 SCC (Civ) 101 : (2021) 1 SCC (L&S) 84] and State of
Odisha v. Sunanda Mahakuda [State of Odisha v. Sunanda Mahakuda, (2021) 11 SCC
560 : (2022) 1 SCC (Cri) 300 : (2022) 2 SCC (L&S) 393] . The leeway which was given
to the Government/public // 11 // authorities on account of innate inefficiencies was
the result of certain orders of this Court which came at a time when technology had
not advanced and thus, greater indulgence was shown. This position is no more
prevalent and the current legal position has been elucidated by the judgment of this
Court in Postmaster General v. Living Media India Ltd. [Postmaster General v. Living
Media India Ltd., (2012) 3 SCC 563 : (2012) 2 SCC (Civ) 327 : (2012) 2 SCC (Cri) 580
: (2012) 1 SCC (L&S) 649] Despite this, there seems to be little change in the
approach of the Government and public authorities.
4. We have also categorised such kind of cases as "certificate cases" filed with the only object to
obtain a quietus from the Supreme Court on the ground that nothing could be done because the
highest Court has dismissed the appeal. The objective is to complete a mere formality and save the
skin of the officers who may be in default in following the due process or may have done it
deliberately. We have deprecated such practice and process and we do so again. We refuse to grant
such certificates and if the Government/public authorities suffer losses, it is time when officers
concerned responsible for the same, bear the consequences. The irony, emphasised by us repeatedly,
is that no action is ever taken against the officers and if the Court pushes it, some mild warning is all
that happens.
5. Looking to the period of delay and the casual manner in which the application has been worded,
we consider appropriate to impose costs on the petitioner(s) of Rs 25,000 for wastage of judicial
time which has its own value and the same be deposited with the Supreme Court
Advocates-on-Record Welfare Fund within four weeks. The amount be recovered from the officers
responsible for the delay in filing the special leave petition and a certificate of recovery of the said
amount be also filed in this Court within the same period of time".
4.5. Learned counsel for the Respondent also relied on another decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court
in the case of State of Kerala vs. Akshaya Jewellers reported in 2023 SCC OnLine SC 1437. Hon'ble
Apex Court in Para-4 & 5 of the said order has held as follows:-
// 12 // "4. We have considered the rival contentions of the parties. At the outset, we
find that delay of 390 days in filing the Special Leave Petition, now converted into
Civil Appeal, has not been explained to the satisfaction of this Court, inasmuch as
there is no narration as to what happened between 18.02.2019, the date on which the
impugned order was passed till 25.04.2019.
Thereafter the only explanation given is that the file had got mixed up with some other files and,
therefore, ultimately only on 13.01.2021, the same was noticed and steps were taken to send a letter
to the Office of the Advocate General of the State of Kerala and a copy to the Special Govt. Pleader
(Taxes) and thereafter, steps were taken to file the appeal on 22.07.2021.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/39037311/ 8
An Appeal Under Section-24-C Of The ... vs Deepak Ku. Swain & Another on 7 March, 2024
5. We find that the reason cited for the gross delay of 390 days in filing the Special Leave Petition,
now converted into a Civil Appeal, does not pursuade us to condone the delay. The explanation
offered is not satisfactory and not sufficient in the eye of law to condone the delay".
4.6. Learned counsel for the Respondent also relied on the decision reported in (2020) 13 SCC 745,
Hon'ble Apex Court in Para-19 to 24 and 31 has held as follows:-
"19. Though we have exhaustively referred to the pleadings and the contentions of the
parties, including contentions put forth on merits, the same is only for completeness
and to put the matter in perspective before considering the issue relating to delay and
laches. In the instant case, considering that the Division Bench [University of Delhi v.
Union of India, 2018 SCC OnLine Del 12085] of the High Court has dismissed the
LPA on the ground of delay of 916 days, that aspect of the matter would require
consideration at the outset and the facts on merits are noted to the limited extent to
find out whether in that background the public interest would suffer.
20. The learned Senior Counsel for the appellant in order to impress upon this Court
the principle relating to consideration of "sufficient cause" for condonation of delay
and the factors that are required to be kept in view, has relied on the decision in LAO
v. Katiji [LAO v. Katiji, (1987) 2 SCC 107] // 13 // wherein it is held as hereunder :
(SCC pp. 108-09, para 3) "3. The legislature has conferred the power to condone
delay by enacting Section 5 [ Any appeal or any application, other than an application
under any of the provisions of Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, may
be admitted after the prescribed period if the appellant or the applicant satisfies the
court that he had sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal or making the
application within such period.] of the Limitation Act, 1963 in order to enable the
courts to do substantial justice to parties by disposing of matters on "merits". The
expression "sufficient cause"
employed by the legislature is adequately elastic to enable the courts to apply the law in a
meaningful manner which subserves the ends of justice--that being the life-purpose for the
existence of the institution of courts. It is common knowledge that this Court has been making a
justifiably liberal approach in matters instituted in this Court. But the message does not appear to
have percolated down to all the other courts in the hierarchy. And such a liberal approach is adopted
on principle as it is realised that:
1. Ordinarily a litigant does not stand to benefit by lodging an appeal late.
2. Refusing to condone delay can result in a meritorious matter being thrown out at
the very threshold and cause of justice being defeated. As against this when delay is
condoned the highest that can happen is that a cause would be decided on merits
after hearing the parties.

An Appeal Under Section-24-C Of The ... vs Deepak Ku. Swain & Another on 7 March, 2024
3. "Every day's delay must be explained" does not mean that a pedantic approach
should be made. Why not every hour's delay, every second's delay? The doctrine must
be applied in a rational common sense pragmatic manner.
4. When substantial justice and technical considerations are pitted against each
other, cause of substantial justice deserves to be preferred for the other side cannot
claim to have vested right in injustice being done because of a non-deliberate delay.
5. There is no presumption that delay is occasioned deliberately, or on account of
culpable negligence, or on account of mala fides. A litigant does not stand to benefit
by resorting to delay. In fact he runs a serious risk.
6. It must be grasped that judiciary is respected not on account of its power to legalise
injustice on technical grounds but because it is capable of removing injustice and is
expected to do so.
// 14 // Making a justice-oriented approach from this perspective, there was sufficient cause for
condoning the delay in the institution of the appeal. The fact that it was the "State" which was
seeking condonation and not a private party was altogether irrelevant. The doctrine of equality
before law demands that all litigants, including the State as a litigant, are accorded the same
treatment and the law is administered in an even-handed manner. There is no warrant for according
a step-motherly treatment when the "State" is the applicant praying for condonation of delay. In fact
experience shows that on account of an impersonal machinery (no one in charge of the matter is
directly hit or hurt by the judgment sought to be subjected to appeal) and the inherited bureaucratic
methodology imbued with the note-making, file- pushing and passing-on-the-buck ethos, delay on
its part is less difficult to understand though more difficult to approve. In any event, the State which
represents the collective cause of the community, does not deserve a litigant-nongrata status. The
courts therefore have to be informed with the spirit and philosophy of the provision in the course of
the interpretation of the expression "sufficient cause". So also the same approach has to be
evidenced in its application to matters at hand with the end in view to do even-handed justice on
merits in preference to the approach which scuttles a decision on merits. Turning to the facts of the
matter giving rise to the present appeal, we are satisfied that sufficient cause exists for the delay.
The order of the High Court dismissing the appeal before it as time-barred, is therefore, set aside.
Delay is condoned. And the matter is remitted to the High Court. The High Court will now dispose of
the appeal on merits after affording reasonable opportunity of hearing to both the sides."
(emphasis in original)
21. Further the decision in Dehri Rohtas Light Railway Co. Ltd. v. District Board, Bhojpur [Dehri
Rohtas Light Railway Co. Ltd. v. District Board, Bhojpur, (1992) 2 SCC 598] is relied upon, wherein
this Court has indicated the real test to determine the delay is that the petitioner should come to
Court before a parallel right is created and that the lapse of time is not attributable to any laches or
negligence.

22. The learned Senior Counsel for Respondent 13, on the other hand, has relied upon the decision
in Postmaster General v. Living Media (India) Ltd. [Postmaster General v. Living Media (India)
Ltd., (2012) 3 SCC 563 : (2012) 2 SCC (Civ) 327 : (2012) 2 // 15 // SCC (Cri) 580 : (2012) 1 SCC
(L&S) 649] wherein it is held as hereunder : (SCC p. 574, paras 28-29) "28. Though we are
conscious of the fact that in a matter of condonation of delay when there was no gross negligence or
deliberate inaction or lack of bona fides, a liberal concession has to be adopted to advance
substantial justice, we are of the view that in the facts and circumstances, the Department cannot
take advantage of various earlier decisions. The claim on account of impersonal machinery and
inherited bureaucratic methodology of making several notes cannot be accepted in view of the
modern technologies being used and available. The law of limitation undoubtedly binds everybody,
including the Government.
29. In our view, it is the right time to inform all the government bodies, their agencies and
instrumentalities that unless they have reasonable and acceptable explanation for the delay and
there was bona fide effort, there is no need to accept the usual explanation that the file was kept
pending for several months/years due to considerable degree of procedural red tape in the process.
The government departments are under a special obligation to ensure that they perform their duties
with diligence and commitment. Condonation of delay is an exception and should not be used as an
anticipated benefit for the government departments. The law shelters everyone under the same light
and should not be swirled for the benefit of a few."
23. From a consideration of the view taken by this Court through the decisions cited supra the
position is clear that, by and large, a liberal approach is to be taken in the matter of condonation of
delay. The consideration for condonation of delay would not depend on the status of the party,
namely, the Government or the public bodies so as to apply a different yardstick but the ultimate
consideration should be to render even-handed justice to the parties. Even in such case the
condonation of long delay should not be automatic since the accrued right or the adverse
consequence to the opposite party is also to be kept in perspective. In that background while
considering condonation of delay, the routine explanation would not be enough but it should be in
the nature of indicating "sufficient cause" to justify the delay which will depend on the backdrop of
each case and will have to be weighed carefully by the courts based on the fact situation. In Katiji
[LAO v. Katiji, (1987) 2 SCC 107] the entire conspectus relating to condonation of delay has been
kept in focus. However, what cannot also be lost sight of is that the // 16 // consideration therein
was in the background of dismissal of the application seeking condonation of delay in a case where
there was delay of four days pitted against the consideration that was required to be made on merits
regarding the upward revision of compensation amounting to 800%.
24. As against the same, the delay in the instant facts in filing the LPA is 916 days and as such the
consideration to condone can be made only if there is reasonable explanation and the condonation
cannot be merely because the appellant is public body. The entire explanation noticed above, depicts
the casual approach unmindful of the law of limitation despite being aware of the position of law.
That apart when there is such a long delay and there is no proper explanation, laches would also
come into play while noticing as to the manner in which a party has proceeded before filing an
appeal. In addition in the instant facts not only the delay and laches in filing the appeal is contended

on behalf of the respondents seeking dismissal of the instant appeal but it is also contended that
there was delay and laches in filing the writ petition itself at the first instance from which the
present appeal had arisen. In that view, it would be necessary for us to advert to those aspects of the
matter and notice the nature of consideration made in the writ petition as well as the LPA to arrive
at a conclusion as to whether the High Court was justified.

31. In the matter of condonation of delay and laches, the well-accepted position is also that the
accrued right of the opposite party cannot be lightly dealt with. In that regard, rather than taking
note of the hardship that would be caused to Respondent 13 as contended by the learned Senior
Counsel, what is necessary to be taken note of is the manner in which Respondent 11, DMRC has
proceeded in the matter. Respondent 11, DMRC is engaged in providing the public transport and for
the said purpose the Government through policy decision has granted approval to generate
resources through property development and in that regard the development as earlier indicated, is
taken up. Pursuant thereto Respondent 11 has received a sum of Rs 218.20 crores from Respondent
13 as far back as in the year 2008. The said amount as indicated is used for its projects providing
metro rail service to the commuting public. In such circumstance, if at this stage the inordinate
delay is condoned // 17 // unmindful of the lackadaisical manner in which the appellant has
proceeded in the matter, it would also be contrary to public interest".
4.7. Similarly reliance was placed in the decision in Civil Appeal No.4440/2008 (Arising out of SLP
(C) No.6111 of 2006, Perumon Bhagvathy Devaswom, Perinadu Village vs. Bhargavi Amma (Dead)
by Lrs. & Ors.
5. Placing reliance on the aforesaid decisions, learned counsel appearing for the Respondent
contended that since while filing the appeal with delay of more than 331 days, no sufficient cause
has been explained with regard to delay for the period from 26.12.2017 to 25.01.2019, the delay in
filing of the appeal is not to be condoned.
6. Having heard learned counsel for the Parties and after going through the materials placed before
this Court, this Court finds that the claim raised by the respondent in GIA Case No.62 of 2011 was
allowed by the Tribunal vide its judgment dtd.26.12.2017. The appeal against such an order was filed
before this Court on 25.01.2019. But it is found that no sufficient cause has been assigned with
regard to the delay starting from 26.12.2017 to 15.09.2018 and again from 15.09.2018 to
25.01.2009. Since no reason has been assigned by assigning any cause lest sufficient cause with
regard to the delay for the period from 26.12.2017 to 15.09.2018 and again from 15.09.2018 to // 18
// 25.01.2019, this Court placing reliance on the decisions so cited by the learned counsel for the
Respondent is not inclined to condone the delay in filing of the appeal.
Accordingly, the I.A stands dismissed.
