5. The precise submission advanced by learned counsel for the appellant is that, admittedly, the
deceased was appointed as Shiksha Mitra and, subsequently on 01.05.2015, he was absorbed in
Basic Education Department as Assistant Teacher and joined the duties on the same date. P.W. 4
Arun Kumar Srivastava who was posted as Finance and Accounts Officer in office of B.S.A., Basti
proved the income of the deceased based upon last drawn salary bills as Rs. 30,000/- per month.
However, the Tribunal has treated the income of the deceased as Rs. 3500/- per month mainly on
the ground that the absorption of Shiksha Mitra as Assistant Teacher became subject matter of
litigation which reached upto the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court upheld the decision of this
High Court to the effect that such absorption was illegal and , therefore, the Tribunal has not treated
the deceased as a duly appointed Assistant Teacher.
6. Contention is that decision of this Court as well as Supreme Court as regards nature of
appointment would remain confined to the service matter only and would not become a component
to assess the quantum of compensation in a matter arising out of accident and that the monthly
income earned by the deceased just before the day of accident would be treated as his income about
which there was sufficient documentary evidence on record. Further submission is that the Tribunal
has erred in awarding Rs. 20,000 as non pecuniary damages whereas, as per the Constitution Bench
Judgment of the Supreme Court in National Insurance Company Ltd. versus Pranay Sethi AIR 2017
SC 5157, the said amount is liable to be enhanced to Rs. 70,000/-.
7. Having heard learned counsel for the appellant , this Court finds that there was sufficient
documentary and oral evidence to establish that the deceased was appointed as Shiksha Mitra and
was absorbed as Assistant Teacher in May 2015 and was receiving salary of Rs. 30,000 per month.
The accident took place on 30.08.2015. The lis relating to the nature of appointment and absorption
of Shiksha Mitra as Assistant Teacher forming subject matter of proceedings before this Court and
up to the Supreme Court, in the opinion of the court, would be read only in relation to the service
matter. Further, this Court decided the matter of absorption in 2015 and Supreme Court upheld the
decision in 2017, but such an adjudication was not in connection with the entitlement of claimants
who are dependents of deceased who was rendering service as Assistant Teacher on the date when
the road accident took place.
8. Even if the judgment of this Court and the Supreme Court in the matter of absorption of Shiksha
Mitra as Assistant Teacher is given consideration in these proceedings, the Court may refer to
paragraph no. 4(1) of the Government Order dated 20.09.2017, which was issued by the State
Government in furtherance of the decision of the Apex Court. The said paragraph is reproduced as
under:-
"4. ?? ????? ??? ???? ?? ???? ?? ????? ??? ?? ?? ????? ??????? ?????? (???)

?????? ????? ???? ?????? 25.07.2017 ?? ??????? ??? ???? ???? ?? ????? ?????? ??

????????????? ?? ?????? 01.08.2017 ?? ??????? ???????? ?????????? ??? ???????????
?? ??? ??? ?????? ????? ???? ??????? ???? ??? ????? ??????? ?? ?? ?? ???? ??????
31.07.2017 ?? ?????? ???? ????"
9. A bare perusal of the afore-quoted clause of the Government Order would reveal that even the
Government , after following the decision of the Supreme Court, has held entitlement of Shiksha
Mitra to receive salary as Assistant Teacher upto 31.07.2017. Therefore, the decisions rendered by
the High Courts and Supreme Court and the Government Order issued thereafter, in no
circumstances , can nullify the entitlement of the deceased to receive salary for the post of Assistant
Teacher atleast on the date of his death nor is there any direction of any court to take away or
recover the amount of salary earned by such Assistant Teacher based upon the previous
Government Order.
10. Therefore, this Court is of the view that Tribunal was not justified in assuming the income of
deceased as Rs. 3500/- per month taking aid of decisions relating to absorption particularly when
there is no dispute that the deceased was receiving a salary of Rs. 30,000/- from the Basic
Education Department on the date of accident.
11. Further following the decision of Pranay Sethi (supra), appellants are held entitled to non
pecuniary damages to the extent of Rs. 70,000/-.
12. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.
13. The impugned award is modified in the following terms:-
i. The income of the deceased shall be treated as Rs. 30,000/- per month for the
purposes of all computations made in the impugned award.
ii. The non-pecuniary damages are enhanced from Rs. 20,000 to Rs. 70,000/-
14. A copy of this order shall be filed by the appellant before the concerned Tribunal within two
weeks.
15. The concerned Tribunal shall register a Misc. Case for the purposes of making re-computation of
the compensation in terms of this order with due notice and intimation to the learned counsel
representing the respondent no. 3, Insurance Company before the District Court.
16. Such computations shall be positively made within a period of next one month.
17. The amount so re-computated shall be paid by the Insurance Company to the claimants within
next two months failing which the award shall be executed and execution proceedings shall be
finalized within next one month.
