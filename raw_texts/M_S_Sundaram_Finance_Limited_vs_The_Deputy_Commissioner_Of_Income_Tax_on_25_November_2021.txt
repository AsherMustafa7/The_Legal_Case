M/S. Sundaram Finance Limited vs The Deputy Commissioner Of Income Tax on 25 November, 2021
to the assessment years 2001-02 & 2002-03.
2. On 07.07.2009, this Court admitted these two tax case appeals on the following common
substantial questions of law:-
"(i) Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case the Tribunal was right in law
in holding that the amount received towards restrictive covenant is revenue receipt
chargeable to tax though receipt of compensation for restraining one's business has
been brought only with effect from 01.04.2003 vide amendment to Section 28 by the
Finance Act, 2002?
(ii) Whether on the facts and circumstance of the case the Tribunal was right in law in
holding that the appellant is not entitled to deduction of the provision made in
respect of Non performing Assets which are considered irrecoverable?
3.1 The learned counsel for the appellant / assessee submitted that the first question of law involved
in these appeals has already been considered and decided by this Court by judgment dated
19.06.2019 in TCA No.1938 of 2008 in respect of the assessee's own case. For better appreciation,
the relevant portion of the said judgment is extracted below:
“5. The assessment for the year under consideration, namely, 2001- 02 was
completed by the assessing officer under Section 143(3) of the Act, vide order dated
31.03.2004. Though https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis TCA Nos.429 & 430 of 2009
there were several issues which were dealt with by the assessing officer, we are
concerned only with regard to the finding pertaining to the amount received by the
assessee towards Restrictive Covenant, whether it is a revenue receipt or capital
receipt?.
6. The assessee is the company engaged in the business of hire purchase financing,
equipment leasing and allied activities.
For the assessment year under consideration, namely, 2001-02, the assessee filed Return of Income
on 31.10.2001 declaring the total income of Rs.8,58,48,600/-. In the scrutiny assessment, which
was completed on 31.03.2004, the total income was determined at Rs.120,65,85,728/-. The
assessing officer while completing the assessment disallowed the amount received as compensation
for restrictive covenant. In the agreement entered into between Royal and Sun Alliance Insurance
(RSA), U.K., and General Insurance Company, India, the assessee was paid Rs.16.80 Crores based
on the agreement which according to the assessee is the receipt in the capital field, as it was received
as consideration for restraining the assessee from entering into insurance business on its own and
also restraining itself from negotiating with any other party for entering into insurance business.
7. The assessee filed an appeal before the Commissioner of Income Tax [Appeals]-VI, Chennai
['CIT-(A)' for brevity] . The appeal was allowed by order dated 13.01.2005. The CIT- (A) held that
the restrictive clause in the agreement for which amount of Rs.16.80 Crores was paid to the assessee
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/176584397/ 2
M/S. Sundaram Finance Limited vs The Deputy Commissioner Of Income Tax on 25 November, 2021
was in view https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis TCA Nos.429 & 430 of 2009 of the commitment given
by the assessee restraining itself from negotiating with any other party and restraining itself from
entering into insurance business. Thus, it held that this amount was paid on account of the
restrictive covenant and hence it is a capital receipt. Furthermore, it held that the payment was
received by the assessee before the commencement of the business activity and therefore, it opined
that the amount received by the aseessee was a capital receipt and accordingly, the addition made by
the assessing officer was deleted.
8. The assessing officer did not agree with the said contention primarily on the ground that the
assessee was not paid any money by the U.K.Company towards the restrictive covenant and only
when the assessee subscribed to the share capital on 19.10.2000, this amount was paid and
therefore, it cannot be treated as a capital receipt. Accordingly, the assessment is completed.
9. The Revenue filed an appeal before the Tribunal and the Tribunal after taking note of the finding
of the assessing officer and finding of the CIT-(A), reversed the order passed by the CIT(A)
particularly on the ground that the so called 'Non compete Fee' is being received by the assessee,
which is not for the business of insurance and the payment is clearly towards 'exploitation of the
service and infrastructure' of the assessee and hence falls under the revenue field. The assessee is
before us on appeal challenging the said finding and we are required to answer the above framed
substantial question of law.
10. The agreement entered into between the assessee and https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis TCA
Nos.429 & 430 of 2009 the U.K.Company is tiled as “Letter of Intent” agreed and accepted by the
parties on 5th April, 2000 in London. The following clause is the subject matter of interpretation:
“At the instance of the U.K.Company, assessee restrained itself from interfering with
any other party and also refrained from itself entering the insurance business. In
consideration of this restraint and the assurance to join hands only with
U.K.Company, agreed to pay lumpsum of E 2.4 million to the assessee.”
11. While completing the assessment, the assessing officer cannot examine the exigency of business
as to what would be the prudent decision from the point of view of the assessee. What is required to
be seen is the interpretation which has to be given to the covenant in the Letter of Intent. The
assessee has been non- suited on the ground that they were never in the insurance business and the
covenant cannot be considered as a restrictive covenant. We do not agree with the said finding of the
assessing officer because there is a background which cannot be ignored by the assessing officer
during the relevant point when the “Letter of Intent” was signed. It was the first time, the
Government of India took a decision to permit foreign insurance companies to set up general
insurance business in India. The entire matter was regulated by the Government of India under the
relevant regulations. Thus, several competing companies in India were desirous of starting
insurance business with foreign partnerships / Joint ventures. Therefore, commercial prudence
demanded the U.K.Company to restrain the assessee, preventing them from entering into insurance
business, which they had not https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis TCA Nos.429 & 430 of 2009 done
earlier, secondly, preventing the assessee from entering into an agreement with any other foreign
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/176584397/ 3
M/S. Sundaram Finance Limited vs The Deputy Commissioner Of Income Tax on 25 November, 2021
insurance company. The condition is clear and lucid and it is to be treated as a 'restrictive covenant'
and merely because the assessee was not in the insurance business is not a ground to read down the
condition. Thus, we are of the considered view that the interpretation given by the CIT(A) to the said
covenant is just and proper and we do not agree with the finding of the assessing officer as well as
the Tribunal in this regard.
12. Mr.T.Ravikumar, learned Senior Counsel for the respondent / revenue vehemently contended
that the factual finding that the payment was received by the assessee before the commencement of
business is the finding, which stares against the assessee and the same has not been challenged. In
our considered view, we are afraid that such a finding cannot work against the assessee. The terms
and conditions of the Letter of Intent is clear, in the sense, that it is the condition which precedes
other conditions, which relates to 'Investment for allotment of shares'. In fact, this amount which
was agreed to be paid as non-compete has been received by the assessee on 23.10.2000 and
immediately invested in the shares of the company. To be noted that all the transactions are in the
same assessment year, i.e., 2001-2002.
13. In the light of the above, we are of the clear view that the CIT(A) was fully justified in holding
that the amount received by the assessee was a capital receipt and was right in deleting the addition
made by the assessing officer. Further, we https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis TCA Nos.429 & 430 of
2009 note that the amount has been credited to the capital receipt account in the balance sheet for
the year ending 31.03.2001 and the amount does not come anywhere within the inclusive definition
of Income as envisaged in Section 2(24).
14. At this juncture, it will be beneficial to refer to the decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Guffic
Chem (P) Ltd., V. Commissioner of Income Tax & Another reported in (2011) 332 ITR 0602. The
Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that 'payment received as non-competition fee under a negative
covenant has to be treated as a capital receipt till the Assessment Year 2003-04'. The said decision
supports the case of the assessee.
15. The learned counsel appearing for the assessee referred to the decision of the assessee's own case
in TCA No.159 of 2009 dated 06.03.2019, which pertains to the capital subsidy received by the
assessee from the U.K.Company.
16. It is the submission of Mr.Ravikumar, learned Senior Standing Counsel for the respondent /
revenue that the substantial question of law No.1 pertains to capital subsidy and in fact, the decision
would enure in favour of the Revenue. We do not agree with the said submission as the Letter of
Intent provides “additional investment” at the instance of the assessee and the condition stated 'if at
the time of finalisation of shareholders agreement it is found that assessee is required to further
infuse equity during the initially agreed pay-back period, U.K.Company will make a compensatory
payment to assessee in an amount to be mutually agreed, before the finalisation of the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis TCA Nos.429 & 430 of 2009 shareholders agreement'.
17. Thus, we are of the clear view that the order passed by the Tribunal dated 31.07.2007 reversing
the order passed by CIT(A) calls for interference. In the light of the above, the appeal filed by the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/176584397/ 4
M/S. Sundaram Finance Limited vs The Deputy Commissioner Of Income Tax on 25 November, 2021
assessee is allowed and the order passed by the tribunal is set aside and the order passed by the
CIT(A) dated 13.01.2005 is restored and the substantial question of law framed is answered in
favour of the assessee. No costs.” Therefore, the learned counsel sought to allow these appeals in
respect of the first question of law raised herein.
3.2 On the other hand, the learned Senior Standing Counsel appearing for the respondent/Revenue
has opposed the submissions made on the side of the appellant / assessee, by referring to the
decision of the High Court of Delhi in the case of Sharp Business System vs. Commissioner of
Income - tax -
III, reported in 24/5 CTR 233, wherein similar issue was decided against the assessee and in favour
of the Revenue and in paragraph 10, it was held as under:
"10. In the present case, the appellant is a joint - venture between M/s.Sharp & L&T.
Apparently, the agreement entered into with the L&T in view of the changed
relationship ensures that the latter does not enter into the same business. Although it
is contended that the advantage is only by way of facilitation of the appellant's
business and ensuring greater efficiency as well as https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
TCA Nos.429 & 430 of 2009 profitability, on the other side, what can be seen is that
the arrangement is to endure for a substantial period, i.e.7 years. Coupled with the
fact that the L&T has its own presence in consumer goods sector and would be, if it
chooses - able to put up an effective competition for business engaged in by the
assessee, there is no doubt that the amount is to ensure a certain position in the
market by keeping - out L&T. Applying the test indicated in the Empire Jute Co. Ltd
(supra), Alembic Chemical Works Co. Ltd. (supra) and Coal Shipments (P) Ltd.
(Supra), this Court is the opinion that the deduction cannot be claimed as a revenue
expenditure; it clearly falls within the capital field. The first two questions are,
therefore, answered against the assessee and in favour of the Revenue.” Stating so,
the learned counsel prayed for dismissal of these tax case appeals, by confirming the
order passed by the Tribunal, insofar as this issue is concerned.
3.3 It is evident from the records that there was a shareholders agreement, as per
which, a non-compete restriction was imposed to the effect that “the assessee
received the amount as consideration with an undertaking to restrain themselves
from entering into insurance business either on their own or joining with others”.
Due to the said restriction, it has lost its right to transact with other companies and
hence, the same was compensated by the lump sum, which cannot be brought to tax
as revenue receipt, but is a capital receipt. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis TCA
Nos.429 & 430 of 2009 Further, it is to be noted that the introduction of sub clause
(va) to section 28 to tax this kind of receipt is applicable only from the assessment
year 2003-04.
That apart, there is no material to show that the said compensation amount received
by the assessee during the years in question, was diverted for any other purpose,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/176584397/ 5
M/S. Sundaram Finance Limited vs The Deputy Commissioner Of Income Tax on 25 November, 2021
except for being invested in the share capital of the joint venture company. Therefore,
following the earlier orders of this court in TCA No.159/2009 dated 06.03.2019 and
TCA No.1938/2008 dated 19.06.2009, we answer this issue in favour of the assessee
and against the Revenue.
4.1 Regarding the second question of law, it is submitted by the learned counsel on
both sides that the same is covered in favour of the assessee, as per the decision of the
Delhi High Court in the case of Commissioner of Income Tax v. Vasisth Chay Vyapar
Limited reported in (2011) 330 ITR 044, which was subsequently confirmed by the
Honourable Supreme court in the order dated 13.12.2017 passed in Civil Appeal No.
5811 of 2012 etc., batch. The relevant paragraphs of the said decision of the Delhi
High Court can profitably be extracted hereunder:-
"17. In this scenario, we have to examine the strength in the submission of learned
counsel for the Revenue that whether it can still be held that income in the form of
interest though not received had still accrued to the assessee under the provisions of
Income Tax Act and was, therefore, eligible to tax. Our answer is in the negative and
we give the following reasons in support:- https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis TCA
Nos.429 & 430 of 2009 (1) First of all we would discuss the matter in the light of the
provisions of Income Tax Act and to examine as to whether in the given
circumstances, interest income has accrued to the assessee. It is stated at the cost of
repetition that admitted position is that the assessee had not received any interest on
the said ICD placed with Shaw Wallce since the assessment year 1996-97 as it had
become NPAs in accordance with the Prudential norms which was entered in the
books of accounts as well. The assessee has further successfully demonstrated that
even in the succeeding assessment years, no interest was received and the position
remained the same until the assessment years 2006-07. Reason was adverse financial
circumstances and the financial crunch faced by Shaw Wallace.
So much so, it was facing winding up petitions which were filed by many creditors. These
circumstances, led to an uncertainty in so far as recovery of interest was concerned, as a result of the
aforesaid precarious financial position of Shaw Wallace. What to talk of interest, even the principal
amount itself had become doubtful to recover. In this scenario it was legitimate move to infer that
interest income thereupon has not "accrued". We are in agreement with the submission of Mr.
Vohra on this count, supported by various decisions of different High Courts including this court
which has already been referred to above.
(2) In the instant case, the assessee company being NBFC is governed by the provisions of RBI Act.
In such a case, interest income cannot be said to have accrued to the assessee having regard to the
provisions of section 45Q of the RBI and Prudential Norms issued by the RBI in exercise of its
statutory powers. As per these norms, the ICD had become NPA and on such NPA where the interest
was not received and possibility of recovery was almost nil, it could not be treated to have been
accrued in favour of the assessee.

M/S. Sundaram Finance Limited vs The Deputy Commissioner Of Income Tax on 25 November, 2021
18. As noted above, Mr. Sabharwal, argued that the case of the assessee was to be dealt with for the
purpose of taxability as per the provisions of the Act and not the RBI Act which was the accounting
method that the assessee was supposed to follow. We have already held that even under the Income
Tax Act, interest income had not accrued. Moreover, this submission of
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis TCA Nos.429 & 430 of 2009 Mr. Sabharwal is based entirely on
the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Southern Technology (supra). No doubt, in first
blush, reading of the judgment gives an indication that the Court has held that RBI Act does not
override the provisions of the Income Tax Act. However, when we examine the issue involved
therein minutely and deeply in the context in which that had arisen and certain observations of the
Apex Court contained in that very judgment, we find that the proposition advanced by Mr.
Sabharwal may not be entirely correct. In the case before the Supreme Court, the assessee a NBFC
debited Rs.81,68,516 as provision against NPA in the profit and loss account, which was claimed as
deduction in terms of Section 36 (1) (vii) of the Act. The assessing officer did not allow the deduction
claimed as aforesaid on the ground that the provision of NPA was not in the nature of expenditure
or loss but more in the nature of a reserve, and thus not deductible under Sectrion 36 (i) (vii) of the
Act. The assessing officer, however, did not bring to tax Rs.20,34,605 as income (being income
accrued under the mercantile system of accounting). The dispute before the Apex court centered
around deductibility of provision for NPA. After analyzing the provisions of the RBI Act, their
Lordships of the Apex Court observed that in so far as the permissible deductions or exclusions
under the Act are concerned, the same are admissible only if such deductions/exclusions satisfy the
relevant conditions stipulated therefor under the Act. To that extent, it was observed that the
Prudential Norms do not override the provisions of the Act. However, the Apex Court made a
distinction with regard to "Income Recognition" and held that income had to be recognized in terms
of the Prudential Norms, even though the same deviated from mercantile system of accounting
and/or Section 45 of the Income Tax Act. It can be said, therefore, that the Apex Court approved the
'real income"
theory which is engrained in the Prudential Norms for recognition of revenue by
NBFC. The following passage from the judgment of the Apex Court would bring out
the distinction noticed by the Apex Court between permissible
deductions/exclusions, on the one hand, and income recognition on the other:-
........
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis TCA Nos.429 & 430 of 2009
40. At the outset, we may state that in essence RBI Directions 1998 are
Prudential/Provisioning Norms issued by RBI under Chapter IIIB of the RBI Act,
1934. These Norms deal essentially with Income Recognition. They force the NBFCs
to disclose the amount of NPA in their financial accounts. They force the NBFCs to
reflect "true and correct" profits. By virtue of Section 45Q, an overriding effect is
given to the Directions 1998 vis-a-vis "income recognition" principles in the
Companies Act, 1956. These Directions constitute a code by itself. However, these
Directions 1998 and the IT Act operate in different areas.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/176584397/ 7
M/S. Sundaram Finance Limited vs The Deputy Commissioner Of Income Tax on 25 November, 2021
These Directions 1998 have nothing to do with computation of taxable income. These Directions
cannot overrule the "permissible deductions" or "their exclusion" under the IT Act. The
inconsistency between these Directions and Companies Act is only in the matter of Income
Recognition and presentation of Financial Statements. The Accounting Policies adopted by an NBFC
cannot determine the taxable income. It is well settled that the Accounting Policies followed by a
company can be changed unless the AO comes to the conclusion that such change would result in
understatement of profits. However, here is the case where the AO has to follow the RBI Directions
1998 in view of Section 45Q of the RBI Act. Hence, as far as Income Recognition is concerned,
Section 145 of the IT Act has no role to play in the present dispute."
19. We have also noticed the other line of cases wherein the Supreme Court itself has held that when
there is a provision in other enactment which contains a non-obstante clause, that would override
the provisions of Income Tax Act. TRO Vs. Custodian, Special Court Act (supra) is one such case
apart from other cases of different High Courts. When the judgment of the Supreme Court in
Southern Technology (supra) is read in manner we have read, it becomes easy to reconcile the ratio
of Southern Technology with TRO Vs. Custodian, Special Court Act.
20. Thus viewed from any angle, the decision of the Tribunal appears to be correct in law. The
question of law is thus https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis TCA Nos.429 & 430 of 2009 decided
against the Revenue and in favour of the assessee. As a result, all these appeals are dismissed."
4.2 In the light of the above decision, the second question of law framed for consideration in these
appeals is also answered in favour of the assessee and against the revenue.
5.In the result, both the appeals filed by the assessee stand allowed. No costs.
