Crl.A. No. 18 of 2022
Md. Safiqur Rahaman
....Appellant
- Versus -
State of Manipur
...Respondent
BEFORE HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE A. GUNESHWAR SHARMA 31.07.2023 [1] Present Mr. L.
Seityandra, learned counsel for the appellant; and Mr. Y. Ashang, learned PP for the State.
[2] The present appeal has been filed under Section 374(2) Cr.P.C against the order dated 11.11.2022
passed by learned Special Judge (ND&PS), Manipur in Special Trial Case No. 71 of 2016. By the
impugned order, the appellant was convicted under Section 21(c) ND&PS Act for unauthorized
possession of 16,200 numbers of S.P. Capsules. Since the appellant was not present before the Court
on the day of pronouncement of the order of conviction, the Court directed the accused to surrender
on or before 23.11.2023 for pronouncement of sentence. Before the order of sentence is passed, the
appellant approached this Court by way of the present appeal on 29.11.2022. Vide order dated
14.12.2022, this Court issued notice and fixed the matter for objection of the State on the
maintainability of the present appeal.
[3] Mr. Y. Ashang, learned PP, submits at the outset that the present appeal is not maintainable
under Section 374(2) Cr.P.C as the order of sentence is yet to be passed by the Trial Court and as
such the appeal is not maintainable in the present form and may be rejected at the threshold. [4]
Mr. L. Seityandra, learned counsel for the appellant, submits that the Trial Court be directed to
conduct the sentence proceedings without the presence of the appellant and may be represented by
his counsel. [5] This Court considered the rival submissions of the party at the Bar and the relevant
provisions of law. It is settled proposition of law that in a case of conviction, the trial concludes upon

pronouncement of sentence by the Trial Court after conviction. In the present case, the sentence is
yet to be pronounced as the appellant/convict has not appeared before the Court for the sentence
proceedings. Hence, the present appeal is premature and is not maintainable in the present form.
With regard to the submission of the learned counsel for the appellant for hearing of the sentence
without the presence of the accused, the same cannot be sustained as hearing of the sentence is to be
conducted in presence of the accused/convict in person. [6] Accordingly, the present appeal is
dismissed as not maintainable in the present form.
[7] The appellant may approached this Court after pronouncement of the sentence, if any, and in
accordance with law. [8] With these observations, the appeal is disposed of. [9] Send a copy of this
order to the learned Special Judge (ND&PS), Manipur, for information.
