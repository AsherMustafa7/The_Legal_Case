Mr. M. Devananda, Sr.Advocate & Ms. N. Jotsana, Advocate For the respondents :: Mr. B.R.
Sharma, CGSC Dates of hearing :: 18.01.2024/29.1.2024/ 08.02.2024 Date of judgment/order ::
30.04.2024 JUDGMENT AND ORDER (C A V) [1] Heard Mr.M.Devananda, learned senior counsel
assisted by Ms. N. Jotsana, learned counsel for the petitioners and Mr.B.R.Sharma, learned CGSC
for the respondents. [2] The brief facts of the present writ petition are that the petitioners have been
working in the Assam Rifles, Ministry of Home Affairs since November, 1999 in the rank of
Riflemen/Operator Radio & Lines ('ORL' for short). Their present scale has been fixed at Rs.3050/-
which is not in consonance with the pay structure of other paramilitary forces of the Government of
India. Hence, the writ petitioners are seeking the relief for pay rationalisation to the scale of
Rs.4000-6000 w.e.f. their initial entry level in terms of the Ministry of Home Notification dated
22.1.1998. [3] The grievance of the petitioners relating to pay structures relate back to the 4th Pay
Commission. Vide Gazette of India Notification dated 29.08.1986 notified implementation of 4 th
Pay Commission. The personnel of Assam Rifles were given the pay scale as applicable to other
CPOs. But such pay structure was not implemented in the Assam Rifles because the technical staffs
were not given the post as per the 4th Pay Commission. Thereafter, the 5th Pay Commission came
into existence where all technical ranks were re-designated and the pay scale were revised. In all the
paramilitary forces, the technical combatant staff were given the rank and pay scale of SI, ASI and
Havildar. While the same was not implemented in the case of Assam Rifles, it remained stagnant.
Therefore, the petitioners claimed pay parity along with designation of all Central Paramilitary
forces, irrespective of the fact that they belong to Assam Rifles or not.
[4] After the declaration of 5th Central Pay Commission, the Ranks structure and Pay Scale from the
rank of constable upto the rank of Subedar Major have been rationalized vide Government of India
Order dated 10.10.1997 for all the COPs, the rank and the Pay Scale for the technical staff such as
Operator Radio & Lines/Radio Mechanics/Cipher were re-designated to the rank of Havildar and till
date, the pay scale given is Rs.3200/- and the Class- I & II employees were given the rank of ASI and
the Pay Scale of Rs.4000/- per month. An Office Memorandum from the Ministry of Home Affairs
in this regards was also issued vide Memo No.27011/103/97-PF, I/56 dated 22nd January, 1998 and
the copies were sent to all the Central Police Organisations/Central Para Military Force, but the

Assam Rifles failed to implement the said Office Memorandum, which would cover the case of the
petitioners herein without any dispute.
[5] The Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs, by the communication dated 4th July, 2022
issued vide Memo No.II. 27013/18/99-PF.V, directed the Directorate General, Assam Rifles to
upgrade the existing post of Riflemen Clerk to Havildar Clerk. It was contended that the Riflemen
Clerk also falls within the communication wing/signal category of Assam Rifles and is a post below
the Rfn/OLR, to which category, the petitioners belong. [6] It has been contended by the petitioners
that there are three types of technical combatant staff in Assam Rufles, viz. (i) Operator Radio and
Line/Radio Operator (ii) Radio Technician/Radio Mechanic and (iii) Cipher. In a similar case,
another personnel, namely, Mr.Dinesh KK, who is a Radio Mechanic of Assam Rifles filed a writ
petition which was allowed by this Court and upon challenge before Apex Court, the same was
affirmed.
[7] One of the petitioners, who was initially appointed as Riflemen (Radio Mechanic) in the Assam
Rifles and subsequently promoted to the post of Warrant Officer (Radio Mechanic) in Assam Rifles
submitted a representation to the Director General Assam Rifles, Shillong requesting to upgrade all
the Riflemen (Radio Mechanic) appointed in the Assam Rifles to the post of Warrant Officer (Radio
Mechanic) from the date of their initial appointment as Riflemen (Radio Mechanic) in Assam Rifles
with the pay scale of Rs.4000-6000 (Annexure A/6 to the writ petition). [8] Affidavit-in-opposition
has been filed on behalf of the Union of India and Ors wherein it has been stated that before the
introduction of Recruitment Rules, 2000 issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs vide letter dated
31.08.2000, where no separate pay scale of class I and Class II Operators of Assam Rifles is specified
and the pay scale in Assam Rifles has been implemented in accordance with the letter dated
10.10.1997 issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs and, therefore, it is submitted that the contention
raised in the writ petition is incorrect.
[9] Mr. M. Devananda, learned senior counsel for the petitioners has drawn the attention of this
Court to the decision in the case of Union of India v. Dineshan K.K.: (2008) 1 SCC 586, where
Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the Radio Mechanics of Assam Rifles are entitled to parity in pay
scale and rank with similar personnel of other central military and police forces. Relying the
decision of Dineshan KK (supra), a Division Bench of Gauhati High Court, in the judgment/order
dated 22.09.2011 in WA No. 50(SH) of 2010 titled No.3589164Y Rfn/ORL Savendra Singh Chauhan
v. Union of India & Ors., upgraded the rank of Rifleman/ Operator Radio & Lines (ORL) in Assam
Rifles as warrant officer. SLP(C) being No. 6241 of 2012 against the Division Bench judgment was
dismissed by Hon'ble Supreme Court on 02.07.2012 and thereafter the direction of the Division
Bench was complied vide order dated 26.12.2012. Mr. M. Devananda, learned senior counsel for the
petitioners urges that the matter has attained finality. Reliance is placed on another judgment/order
dated 08.05.2014 passed by High Court of Meghalaya in WP(C) No.56 of 2013 titled 357918
Rfn/ORL Madhuvendra Singh & Ors. v. Union of India, Riflemen/ORLs in Assam Rifles were
conferred rank and pay scale of warrant officer relying on the judgment of the Division Bench of
Gauhati High Court (supra). It is also pointed out that vide order dated 05.01.2024 issued by the
Directorate General Assam Rifles, Shillong, even the Pharmacist in Assam Rifles has also been
conferred the same benefit. Learned senior counsel cites the decision in the case of State of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/49615820/ 9

Karnataka v. C. Lalitha: (2006) 2 SCC 747, where Hon'ble Supreme Court discussed the concept of
equality of treating persons similarly situated in service matter. It is prayed that similar relief be
granted to the petitioners in terms of the above cited judgments.
[10] MR. BR Sharma, learned CGS for the respondents submits that the petitioners seventy six in
numbers, have filed WP(C) No.675 of 2022 praying for a direction to the respondents to grant the
rank of Warrant Officer with effect from their initial enrolment to the post of Rifleman (Radio
Mechanic) in Assam Rifles. [11] The petitioners were enrolled as Rifleman (Radio Mechanic)
through various appointment orders from 2008 to 2014 as per the then prevailing recruitment
rules. In the said recruitment rules the minimum qualification prescribed for the post of Rifleman
(RM) was matriculation with English, mathematics and science. [12] After the publication of revise
recruitment rule 2012 which provides minimum qualification for recruiting rifleman (RRM) as 10+2
with 3 years diploma in radio and television tech for electronics or telecommunications or computer
or electrical or mechanical engineering or domestic appliances from a recognised university or
institute. The respondents as per the revised recruitment rule 2012 for the first time advertised for
the post of Warrant Officer Radio Mechanic in the year 2015. Thereafter, the revised recruitment
rule 2012 was again revised in the year 2018 with modification in the minimum qualification
required for recruitment of Warrant Officer Radio Mechanic. As per the existing policy, the
petitioners are eligible for the post of Warrant Officer Radio Mechanic on fulfilling all the qualitative
requirement including passing of Radio Mechanic Class 1 test and as such the petitioners were
upgraded to the post of Warrant Officer RM with effect from 1st Jan 2020 as they pass the said test
in Feb 2019. [13] The petitioners have interpreted the office memorandum dated 22nd Jan 1998 and
created the impression that the petitioners are to be given promotion to the post of Warrant Officer
RM. It is stated that the Office Memoranda dated 22.1.1998 and 3.3.1998 nowhere mentioned that
the post of Rifleman RM should be re-designated as Warrant Officer Radio Mechanic instead the
office memorandum specifically provides for re-designation of Head Constable (equivalent to
Havildar in Assam Rifles). The said OM also provides that if the pre revised pay scale of Havildar in
Assam Rifles and revised pay scale of Head Constable in other CPF's are identical then Havildar in
Assam Rifles can be re-designated as ASI or Warrant Officer which is equivalent to ASI in other
CAPFs. Learned CGS submits that both the OMs dated 22.1.1998 and 3.3.1998 provide that Havildar
in Assam Rifles, equivalent to Head Constable shall only be re-designated as Warrant Officer
(equivalent to ASI) if and only if the pay scale of Havildar in Assam Rifles is identical to Head
Constable in BSF, CRPF etc [14] Vide letter dated 3rd Dec 2008 the Government of India wrote a
letter to the Director General Assam Rifles regarding up-gradation of the posts of Havildar RM to
Warrant Officer RM. In the said letter approval of the competent authority was conveyed for up
gradation and re-designation of the posts of Havildar RM in Assam Rifles in the light of the Hon'ble
Guwahati High Court decision dated 11.2.2005. As regards to up gradation of posts of Riflemen to
the posts of Warrant Officers in Assam Rifles the competent authority does not agree as the
recruitment qualification of Rifleman RM so prescribed being lower. Hence the promotion criteria
prescribed in the RR, 2000 in respect to Havildar RM still stands good. For the Rifleman RM to
qualify consideration for promotion to the post of Havildar RM must attend the following criteria:
(a) Must have passed Radio Mechanic course from the Army/Central Police
Organisation Institute
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/49615820/ 10
Unknown vs Union Of India Through Its Home ... on 30 April, 2024
(b) Must have min of eight year service in the grade of Rifleman (RM)
(c) Must be in medical category AYE (one)/SHAPE-I except for low medical category
attributable to actual hostilities/insurgency operations and aggravated due to service.
(d) Must have passed promotion cadre, MR standard-II and Tech Trade Test One.
[15] It is submitted that only when a Rifleman RM is promoted to the post of Havildar RM, he shall
be automatically upgraded and re-designated to the post of Warrant Officer RM by virtue of the
OMs dated 22.1.1998 and 3.3.1998. It is further stated that all Riflemen RM in Assam Rifles who
have passed TER Class 1 shall be upgraded/promoted to the rank of Warrant Officer RM by virtue of
being qualified for the post of Havildar RM subject to availability of vacancy. The petitioners passed
TER Class 1 on different dates starting from 17.1.2014 to 26.3.2022. Therefore, the claim of the
petitioners that they should be upgraded/ promoted to the post of Warrant Officer RM in the Assam
Rifles from the date of their initial appointment is untenable in the eye of law.
[16] Mr. BR Sharma has pointed out that the petitioners were recruited as per the recruitment rules
prevailing prior to 2012 as Rifleman Radio Mechanic in Assam Rifles by accepting the terms and
conditions of the service as well as the recruitment rules prevailing at the point of time. It is not a
case of the petitioners that they qualify the criteria to be appointed/promoted to the post of Warrant
Officer from the day they were appointed to the post of Rifleman Radio mechanic. It is an admitted
fact that the qualification required for the post of Rifleman RM is only matriculation without any
additional specialized degree/ diploma. Further, it is also not the case of the petitioner that though
the nomenclature of the post of Rifleman RM is not Havildar RM (equivalent to Head Constable
RM), the pay scale of Rifleman RM in Assam Rifles is equal to Head Constable RM in other CPFs. It
is also stated that the petitioners firstly need to qualify for promotion to Havildar Radio mechanic
and then only the OMs dated 22.1.1998 and 3.3.1998 will come into play as upgradation in the said
OMs are made only in respect of Head Constable RM (equivalent to Havildar in Assam Rifles) to the
post of ASI (equivalent to Warrant Officer RM in Assam Rifles). Assuming but not admitting that
the OMs dated 22.1.1998 and 3.3.1998 issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs by the Government of
India are applicable to the petitioners, as claimed in the writ petition, the OMs are documents of
Government policies and decisions and the same cannot overwrite the recruitment rules framed
under Article 309 of the Constitution of India. In service jurisprudence, it is well settled position of
law that service rules framed under statutes shall always prevail over conflicting government
decisions/policy/resolution. Relying on 2023 SCC online SC 311:Ashok Ram Prahad v. State of
Maharashtra, it is submitted that the claim of the petitioners that they should be
upgraded/promoted to the post of Warrant Officer RM in Assam Rifles from the date of their initial
appointment is untenable in the eye of law and as such, the writ petition has no merit, as the
petitioners are not aggrieved persons inasmuch as there is violation of fundamental rights or legal
rights of the petitioners.
[17] This Court has minutely examined the materials on record, the submissions made at bar and
the relevant case law. [18] It will be relevant to reproduce the relevant portion of decision of Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Union of India v. Dineshan K.K.: (2008) 1 SCC 586, which held that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/49615820/ 11
Unknown vs Union Of India Through Its Home ... on 30 April, 2024
the Radio Mechanics of Assam Rifles are entitled to parity in pay and rank with similar personnel of
other military and Central Police organisations. Relevant para are reproduced below:
18. Vide Order dated 10-10-1997 passed by the Ministry of Home Affairs in pursuance
of Para 7 of the Ministry of Finance, Department of Expenditure Resolution dated
30-
9-1997, it was notified that the President was pleased to rationalise the rank structure and pay scales
of non- gazetted cadre of the Central Police Organisations and as a result of this exercise certain
ranks were to be merged and the rank structure was communicated in the order along with the
revised pay scales and replacement pay scales. Copy of this order was sent to all the paramilitary
forces, including Assam Rifles.
19. On 22-1-1998, an office memorandum was issued by the Government of India, Ministry of Home
Affairs, by way of a clarification. In the said letter, it was clarified that Order dated 10-10-1997 was
equally applicable to all advertised categories. In the said letter, directions with regard to the
redesignation of the three posts including Head Constable (RM) as ASI in Central paramilitary
forces along with their replacement pay scales were also ordered.
20. It appears that the disparity in rank and pay in various Central paramilitary forces could not be
resolved and on 24-4-2001, the Director General, Assam Rifles submitted a report to the
Government with regard to the progress on pay anomaly cases. Para 4 of the said letter is of some
relevance to the issue at hand and it reads as follows:
"Rank and pay of technical cadre person, RM, Ptmn., Pharma, and compounder of
AR with the same intake QR for remounts are given the rank of Havildar wherein
they are (sic whereas their) counterparts in CPOs are given ASI. MHA had ordered to
submit proposal in directing cadre to cadre comparison with BSF where the rank of
ASI is available in other technical and also along with financial implication. The
proposal along with financial implication has been submitted to MHA and the case is
lying with MOF for approval."
21. Having failed to receive any positive response from the Government, one of the Radio Mechanics
issued a notice of demand to the Ministry of Home Affairs and Director General of Assam Rifles,
inter alia, praying for giving effect to Office Order dated 10-10-1997 and Office Memorandum dated
22-1-1998. Vide Order dated 26-12- 2001, the Ministry of Home Affairs informed the Director
General of Assam Rifles that his proposal had been examined in consultation with Ministry of
Finance and it was found that there was no point for comparison of grades and scales of pay for such
posts across various Central paramilitary forces.
22. It was stated that the proposed upgradation may disturb relativities of various trades and grades
within Assam Rifles and there was no functional justification for upgrading these posts. It is evident
that on rejection of the recommendation made by the Director General of the Force, the respondent
herein was left with no option but to approach the High Court for redressal of his grievance.

Unknown vs Union Of India Through Its Home ... on 30 April, 2024
...............................................................................
24. From the afore-extracted paragraphs of the counter- affidavit and the résumé of correspondence
referred to above, it clearly stands admitted by the petitioners herein that: (i) all the paramilitary
forces, including Assam Rifles are on a par with each other and (ii) there was apparent "disparity" in
the pay scales of the personnel of Assam Rifles with their counterparts in other Central paramilitary
forces. In order to rectify this disparity, Director General, Assam Rifles, Petitioner 2 herein, vide his
letter dated 18- 2-1998 had, in fact, taken up the grievance of the respondent with the Ministry of
Home Affairs, inter alia, recommending redesignation of Havildar (RM) Grades I and II of Assam
Rifles as warrant officer and for replacement of pay scale of Rs 4000-100-6000 to bring them on a
par with their counterparts in other Central Police Organisations.
25. However, the Ministry of Home Affairs vide Letter dated 3-3-1998 while accepting the said
proposal had recommended redesignation of Havildar/RM as warrant officer but subject to the
condition that the prerevised and revised pay scales of Havildar/RM in other paramilitary forces
were identical to the pay scales of Head Constable (RM) in CRPF and BSF. Manifestly, in the instant
case, the differentiation in the pay scales of the two paramilitary forces is sought to be achieved not
on the ground of dissimilarity of academic qualification or the nature of duties and responsibilities
but only on the ground that there was "initial anomaly" in the Fourth Central Pay Commission
Report. The counter-affidavit does not even attempt to explain how the case of Havildar/RM in
Assam Rifles is different from that of Radio Mechanics in other Central paramilitary forces.
........................................................................................
27. Thus, the short question requiring our consideration is whether having admitted in their
affidavit referred to hereinabove, the "apparent disparity" and "anomaly" in the pay scales of Radio
Mechanics, the administrative authorities, the petitioners herein, could be permitted to perpetuate
apparent discriminatory differentiation in the pay scales because of the disparity in prerevised and
revised scales of the personnel of Assam Rifles prior to the recommendations of the Fourth Pay
Commission, irrespective of the identity of their powers, duties and responsibilities with other
paramilitary forces. In our considered opinion, in view of the total absence of any plea on the part of
the Union of India that Radio Mechanics in other paramilitary forces were performing different or
more onerous duties as compared to the Radio Mechanics in Assam Rifles, the impugned decision of
the Government was clearly irrational and arbitrary and thus, violative of Article 14 of the
Constitution.
[19] The decision in Dineshan K.K. (supra) has been relied by various High Courts including this
Court and the erstwhile common Gauhati High Court and the matter has attained finality. The facts
of the present case is also similar with the case of Dineshan K.K..
[20] From perusal and detail analysis of the judgements passed by Hon'ble Supreme Court, Gauhati
High Court and Meghalaya High Court in the above cited cases of Dineshan K.K., order dated
22.09.2011 in WA No. 50 (SH) 2010 and order dated 08.05.2014 in WP(C) No. 56 of 2013
respectively, this Court is of the firmed view that the petitioners herein are also entitled to the
similar reliefs. Accordingly, the respondents are directed to grant/ upgrade the ranks of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/49615820/ 13
Unknown vs Union Of India Through Its Home ... on 30 April, 2024
petitioners to the post of Warrant Officers (Radio Mechanic) in Assam Rifles equivalent to ASI
(Radio Mechanic) in BSF/ITBP/CRPF with pay scale of Rs.4000-6000 with effect from their initial
entry level in terms of Ministry of Home Affairs Notification dated 22.01.1998 with all consequential
reliefs. The direction shall be complied within a period of three months from the date of receipt of a
copy of this order.
[21] Writ petition is allowed and disposed of in terms of the above directions. No cost.
[22] Send a copy of this order to the Director General, Assam Rifles at Shillong for information and
necessary compliance.
