MC(Crl.Rev.P.) No. 5 of 2022
Kangabam Boby Singh
Applicant
Vs.
State of Manipur & anr.
Respondents
BEFORE HON'BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. SIDDHARTH MRIDUL 08.12.2023 Mr. A. Viscount,
learned counsel, appears on behalf of the applicant; and Mr. R.K. Umakanta, learned PP, appears on
behalf of the respondents.
The present application has been instituted on behalf of Shri Kangabam Boby Singh, praying as
follows:-
"To consider the explanation given in the foregoing paras and circumstances stated
therein as the sufficient cause for condoning the unintentional delay of 984 days in
total and 278 days in actual in preferring the Revision petition under reference and
the same be heard on merit after condoning the delay as the ends of justice may call
for."
It is an admitted position that Shri Kangabam Boby Singh (petitioner), subsequent upon the order
on conviction dated 11.03.2019 convicting him for commission of offence under Sections 376/506
IPC and order of sentence dated 14.03.2019 sentencing him to 12 years R.I., is currently undergoing
incarceration.
Although, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the State, would urge that the application deserves
to be rejected in so far as it does not correctly mention the number of days of delay in filing the
accompanying criminal revision petition; in my opinion, in view of the facts & circumstance of the
case, as well as the circumstance that the petitioner is currently undergoing the sentence awarded to
him, the delay in filing the accompanying criminal revision petition deserves to be condoned, in the
interest of justice.
The application is accordingly allowed.
Delay is condoned.
