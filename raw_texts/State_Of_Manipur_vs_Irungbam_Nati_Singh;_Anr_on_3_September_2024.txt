BEFORE
HON'BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. SIDDHARTH MRIDUL

ORDER
03.09.2024 Siddharth Mridul, C.J.:
Mr. Athouba Khaidem, learned Government Advocate, appears on behalf of the
applicant; and Mr. S. Jhalajit, learned counsel, appears on behalf of the respondents.
The present application has been instituted on behalf of the State of Manipur, the
applicant, praying as follows:
"In the premises stated above, your Lordship may graciously be pleased to consider
the reasons and circumstances stated above as sufficient grounds for condoning the
unintentional and bona-fide delay of 726 days in filing the accompanying Govt.
Criminal Appeal."
At the outset, it is observed that the present appeal assails the judgment and order dated
10.01.2022, whereby the respondents were acquitted of charges framed against them for the
commission of offence under Sections 447/326/302/34 IPC.
Mr. S. Jhalajit, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents, fairly does not oppose the
present application.
MC (GCA) No. 6 of 2024 Page 1 Having heard the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the parties
and in terms of the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in State (NCT OF DELHI) Vrs. Ahmed
Jaan, reported as (2008) 14 SCC 582 and in particular paragraph 13 thereof; as well as the decision

State Of Manipur vs Irungbam Nati Singh; & Anr on 3 September, 2024
of the 3(three) Judge Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in State of Manipur & ors. Vrs. Koting
Lamkang, reported as (2019) 10 SCC 408 and in particular paragraph 8 thereof; since the
proceedings instituted on behalf of the State are not personal to its officers and the paramount
consideration is that institutional interest ought not to suffer by resorting to technicalities of delay
to defeat hearing on merits; the delay of 726 days in filing the accompanying Govt. Criminal Appeal
is condoned.
The present application filed for condonation of delay is allowed and accordingly disposed of.
Registry is directed to number the appeal, if it is otherwise found to be in order, and list the same for
admission.
