JUDGMENT
1. This appeal under Section 52 of the Jammu and Kashmir Land Acquisition Act, 1990 arises out of
the judgment/award dated 31.12.2013 passed by the court of learned District Judge, Rajouri
(hereinafter to be referred to as the Reference Court) in file No. 123/Reference titled "Makhan Singh
and others vs. Collector, Land Acquisition Northern Railway, Udhampur and another".
2. The award has been impugned by the appellant on the following grounds:
(a) That the Reference Court has relied upon the sale instances, which cannot be
accepted as a measure to determine the market price of the acquired land as it is
settled law that the value fetched for the small portion of land cannot be made basis
for determining the price of large chunk of land. The Reference Court while passing
the impugned award, 2 MA N0. 570/2014.
has not considered and applied the settled principle of „Reduction and Deduction(cid:129) in fixing the just
and fair amount of compensation, when big chunk of land is being acquired.
(b) That the Reference Court while passing the impugned award has failed to consider the fact that
the land under acquisition is an agricultural land and it is settled law that when agricultural land is

Dy. Chief Engineer Construction N vs Makhna Singh And Ors on 14 July, 2023
to be acquired, in view of the permanent restriction regarding user, it has to be valued only as an
agricultural land and cannot be valued with reference to sale statistics of other nearby lands which
have the potential of being used for urban development.
3. Mr. Vishal Sharma, learned DSGI, submitted that the Reference Court has wrongly enhanced the
amount of compensation by taking into consideration the sale instances in respect of small piece of
land for the purpose of determining compensation for the big chunk of the land acquired by the
appellants and as such, the award is required to be set aside.
4. Mr. G. S Thakur, learned counsel for the respondents argued that the learned Reference Court has
determined the compensation by placing reliance upon the judgments passed by the Hon(cid:129)ble Apex
Court, after the respondents led evidence in respect of the unfair compensation paid to the
respondents for the land acquired by the appellant.
5. Heard and perused the record.
6. The land measuring 273 Kanals and 12 marlas comprising various survey numbers situated at
village, Bakkal, District Reasi was acquired by the respondents under the provisions of Jammu and
Kashmir Land Acquisition Act, 3 MA N0. 570/2014.
for the purpose of construction of Katra to Qazigund Rail Link Line Project and the final award was
announced on 20.09.2005. The Collector fixed the following rate of compensation depending upon
the nature of the land:
A. Abi.Bagicha/Hail-Barani Rs. 40,000/ per kanal B. Warhal Awal/Doem & Rs.
35,000/ per kanal Land under structures C. Banjar Qadeem/Jadeed/Arak Rs.
20,000/ per kanal D. Gair Mumkin land Rs. 10,000/ per kanal
7. The respondents were not satisfied with the rates fixed in the final award, so they
filed an application under Section 18 of the Act (supra) before the Collector for
referring the case to the Civil Court on the ground that the compensation for the land
has not been properly assessed, as the prevailing market value of the land was (cid:130) 1.25
lakhs per kanal. It was also stated in the application for making reference that the
compensation of the land has been assessed in a discriminatory manner, as the land
of the applicants was converted into standard Kanal and then the rates of
compensation were fixed, whereas in the adjoining villages, Kuri, Batli, Judda and
Surukot, the compensation of the land has been assessed on the basis of local kanal,
which is equal to 13 marlas. It was also stated that in Panchayat Seer Sundwan and
Lam Sura, the compensation of the land was assessed and awarded as per local kanal.
After the reference was made in terms of Section 18 of the Act (supra), the appellant
was put to notice. The appellant filed their response and without submitting their
para-wise reply stated that the Collector Railways has fixed the rate of compensation
on the basis of assessment made by the competent authority, so

Dy. Chief Engineer Construction N vs Makhna Singh And Ors on 14 July, 2023
4 MA N0. 570/2014.
there is no question of enhancement of amount of compensation at this stage. The Reference Court
framed the following issues for its determination:
A. What was the prevailing market value of the land at the time of acquisition of the
same?
B. Whether petitioners have not been paid compensation of fruit trees, watermill
including Kotha and are entitled to the compensation of the same?
C. Are petitioners entitled to claim compensation in reference to the standard of
kanal (20) marlas instead of local kanals, which is equal to 13 marlas?
D. Relief
8. The respondents examined Ram Chand, Thakur Das, Devinder Singh, Uttam Singh, Kapoor Singh
and Patwari Sham Lal in support of their case. The appellant did not produce any witness in its
defence. After hearing the learned counsels appearing for the respective parties, the learned
Reference Court vide impugned judgment, fixed the market value of the culturable land at (cid:130) 45,500
per local kanal and that of non-culturable land at (cid:130) 25,000 per local kanal.
9. Both the issues raised by the appellant are conflated for the purpose of determining the present
controversy. The learned Reference Court while determining the compensation for the culturable
and non-culturable land has placed reliance upon the sale exemplars for the year 2003. Respondent
Ram Chand in his deposition has stated that he sold the land measuring 4 marlas to Thakur Das for
(cid:130) 25,000 by virtue of sale deed dated 07.06.2003. RW Thakur Das has also admitted the same.
Likewise, respondent Kapoor Singh stated that 5 MA N0. 570/2014.
he sold 12 marlas of land at village Bakkalto Devinder Singh at the rate of (cid:130) 80,000 per kanal. RW
Devinder Singh stated that he purchased 12 marlas of land from Kapoor Singh for a consideration of
(cid:130) 48,000, which comes to (cid:130) 80,000 per kanal and in the year 2005, the rate of the said land was
about (cid:130) 1,50,000/ per kanal. Both the sale deeds dated 03.06.2003 and 07.06.2003 pertain to same
village Bakkal, where the land has been acquired by the appellant. It needs to be mentioned here
that the appellant has nowhere disputed that the sale exemplars relied upon by the respondents are
not the genuine transactions. RW Sham Lal-Patwari has stated that that the compensation has been
assessed as per the standard kanal, whereas in the village Bakkal there are local kanals. Local kanal
is of 13 marlas. He further stated that in the year 2003 rate of one kanal of land was (cid:130) 1 lakh. In the
year 2006, rate of one local kanal of land at village Bakkal was (cid:130) 1.25 lakhs. From the award, it is
evident that the Tehsildar Reasi communicated (cid:130) 40,000 per local kanals market rate for culturable
land and (cid:130) 25,000/ per local kanal for non-culturable land i.e. (cid:130) 61,000/- per standard kanal for
culturable land and (cid:130) 38,000 per standard kanal for un-culturable land. The collector without any
justification and reason opined that the rates communicated by the Tehsildar, Reasi are on the
higher side and cannot be made the basis for determining the rate. It is evident from the record that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/24606658/ 3
Dy. Chief Engineer Construction N vs Makhna Singh And Ors on 14 July, 2023
there are no exemplars in respect of the sale of big chunk of land proximate to the date of issuance of
notification under Section 4 of the Act (supra) and in such circumstances, placing reliance upon the
instances of sale of small chunk of land while determining the compensation for big chunk of the
land is permissible.
6 MA N0. 570/2014.
10. In "Trishla Jain v. State of Uttaranchal"1 , the Supreme Court held that the value of small pieces
of land can be taken into consideration for determining even the value of the large tract of land but
with the condition that while doing so, some deduction is required to be made.
11. In "Nirmal Singh v. State of Haryana"2, it was held by the Hon(cid:129)ble Supreme Court as under:
"19. Sale instances in relation to small pieces of land situated near the acquired land
can be considered, subject to (i) reasonable deductions for developmental costs that
will be incurred in the future as per the cases referred to supra, and (ii) the evidence
that these lands can be compared to the acquired land in terms of its vicinity and the
comparable benefits and advantages."
12. The learned Reference Court by placing reliance upon the two exemplars of the sale of small
stretch of land after taking into consideration the 10% increase in view of the difference of 8 months
between the dates of the execution of the sale deeds viz-a-viz notification under Section 4 of the Act
(supra) dated 24.10.2003 and corrigendum dated 07.02.2004, has determined the market value of
the land as per the two sale deeds to be (cid:130) 57,200 and (cid:130) 89,400 respectively per local kanal. This is in
accordance of the law laid down by Hon(cid:129)ble Supreme Court in "ONGC Ltd versus Rameshbhai
Jivanbhai Patel"3. By „Guesstimation(cid:129), which is permissible as held in judgment (supra), the
learned Reference Court has determined the market value of the acquired land at (cid:130) 70,000 per local
kanal on the date of notification under section 4 (1) of the Act. It needs to be noted that when the
land is acquired compulsorily, the owner is entitled to highest value of the land. In the present case,
the learned (2011) 6 SCC 47 (2015) 2 SCC 160 (2008) 14 SCC 745 7 MA N0. 570/2014.
Reference Court has not chosen the highest value of the land as the sale deeds were in respect of
small pieces of land. Besides the learned Reference Court has also adopted the „principle of
reduction and deduction(cid:129) while determining the market value of the land. The guesstimate of the
learned Reference Court in the fixation of market value of the culturable land as (cid:130) 70,000 per kanal
cannot be termed as arbitrary, in the present facts and circumstance of the case.
13. In "Viluben Jhalejar vs State of Gujarat"4, the Supreme Court has been held as under:
"19. Market value is ordinarily the price the property may fetch in the open market if
sold by a willing seller unaffected by the special needs of a particular purchase.
Where definite material is not forthcoming either in the shape of sales of similar
lands in the neighbourhood at or about the date of notification under Section 4(1) or
otherwise, other sale instances as well as other evidences have to be considered.

20. The amount of compensation cannot be ascertained with mathematical accuracy.
A comparable instance has to be identified having regard to the proximity from time
angle as well as proximity from situation angle. For determining the market value of
the land under acquisition, suitable adjustment has to be made having regard to
various positive and negative factors vis-à-vis the land under acquisition by placing
the two in juxtaposition. The positive and negative factors are as under:
Positive factors Negative factors
(i) smallness of size (i) largeness of area
(ii) proximity to a (ii) situation in the
road interior at a distance
from the road
(iii) frontage on a (iii) narrow strip of
road land with very small
frontage compared to
depth
(iv) nearness to (iv) lower level
developed area requiring the
depressed portion to
be filled up
(v) regular shape (v) remoteness from
developed locality
(vi) level vis-à-vis (vi) some special
land under disadvantageous
acquisition factors which would

deter a purchaser
(vii) special value for
an owner of an
adjoining property to
whom it may have
some very special
advantage"
14. In "Manoj Kumar v. State of Haryana"5, it has been held as under:
9. The High Court has also erred in law in not deducting the amount towards the
development of exemplar sale of 1997. When the large area had been acquired, the
two kinds of deductions have to be made, one for development and in case of
exemplar transaction is a small area, the reduction is required to be made to arrive at

the value of large tract.
(Emphasis Added)
15. In "Sabhia Mohammed Yusuf Abdul Hamid Mulla v. Land Acquisition Officer"6, the Hon(cid:129)ble
Apex Court has held as under:
"19. In fixing the market value of the acquired land, which is undeveloped or
underdeveloped, the courts have generally approved deduction of 1/3rd of the market
value towards development cost except when no development is required to be made
for implementation of the public purpose for which land is acquired. In Kasturi v.
State of Haryana [(2003) 1 SCC 354] the Court held:
"7. ... It is well settled that in respect of agricultural land or undeveloped land which
has potential value for housing or commercial purposes, normally 1/3rd amount of
compensation has to be deducted out of the amount of compensation payable on the
acquired land subject to certain variations depending on its nature, location, extent of
expenditure involved for development and the area required for roads and other civic
amenities to develop the land so as to make the plots for residential or commercial
purposes. A land may be plain or uneven, the soil of the land may be soft or hard
bearing on the foundation for the purpose of making construction; maybe the land is
situated in the midst of a developed area all around but that land may have a hillock
or may be low-lying or may be having deep ditches. So the amount of expenses that
may be incurred in developing the area also varies. A claimant who claims that his
land is fully developed and nothing more is required to be done for developmental
purposes, must show on the basis of evidence that it is such a land and it is so located.
In the absence of such evidence, merely saying that the area adjoining his land is a
developed area, is not enough particularly when the extent of the acquired land is
large and even if a small portion of the land is abutting the main road in the
developed area, does not give the land the character of a developed area. In 84 acres
of land acquired even if one portion on one side abuts the main road, the remaining
large area where planned development is required, needs (2018) 13 SCC 96 (2012) 7
SCC 595 9 MA N0. 570/2014.
laying of internal roads, drainage, sewer, water, electricity lines, providing civic amenities, etc.
However, in cases of some land where there are certain advantages by virtue of the developed area
around, it may help in reducing the percentage of cut to be applied, as the developmental charges
required may be less on that account. There may be various factual factors which may have to be
taken into consideration while applying the cut in payment of compensation towards developmental
charges, maybe in some cases it is more than 1/3rd and in some cases less than 1/3rd. It must be
remembered that there is difference between a developed area and an area having potential value,
which is yet to be developed. The fact that an area is developed or adjacent to a developed area will
not ipso facto make every land situated in the area also developed to be valued as a building site or
plot, particularly when vast tracts are acquired, as in this case, for development purpose."

16. The rule of 1/3rd deduction was reiterated by the Supreme Court in "Tejumal Bhojwani v. State
of U.P." 7 , "V. Hanumantha Reddy v. Land Acquisition Officer"8, "H.P. Housing Board vs. Bharat S.
Negi"9 and "Kiran Tandon vs. Allahabad Development Authority"10 .
17. The learned Reference Court by applying the „principle of deduction(cid:129) has determined the market
value of the culturable land acquired as (cid:130) 45,500 per local kanal by deducting 35% of the total value
on account of development charges, notwithstanding the fact that the land has not been acquired for
the residential project. It is evident that the learned Reference Court has applied both the
deductions as are required to be made in terms of Manoj Kumar(cid:129)s case (supra), despite the fact that
the land was not acquired for any housing or commercial project but for the purpose of Rail Link.
The learned Reference Court has determined the market value of non-culturable land as (cid:130) 25,000
per local kanal as compared to market value determined for the culturable land and it cannot be
termed as excessive or exorbitant.

18. Viewed thus, this Court is of the considered view that the learned Reference Court has enhanced
the compensation in accordance with settled principles of law laid down by the Hon(cid:129)ble Apex court.
The judgment/award dated 31.12.2013 of the learned Reference Court does not call for any
interference. Accordingly, the appeal is found to be without any merit and is, accordingly, dismissed.
19. Record of the Reference Court be sent back forthwith.
