Court Rule, 2019 against the impugned Judgment and Order dated 02.08.2023 passed in WP(C)

(ii) to set aside the impugned judgment and order dated 02.08.2023 passed in WP(C)
No. 729 of 2019 as the same was passed without appreciating the materials of the
case.
(iii) to pass any appropriate order(s) or direction which the Hon'ble Court deems fit and proper.
Writ Appeal no. 116 of 2023 Page 2
[3] The above referred to W.P.(C) No. 729 of 2019 was
filed by the respondent No.1/petitioner to quash a portion of the impugned statement dated
13.10.2017 issued by the office of the Accountant General, Manipur, on the basis of which a sum of
Rs. 5,82,002/- was recovered as excess payment/over payment from the gratuity amount and
dearness relief after his retirement and to refund the official respondents to refund the said amount
with admissible interest.
[4] The learned counsel for the respondent No. 1/petitioner was initially appointed as Road
Mohorrir in Minor Irrigation Department, Government of Manipur in the Scale of pay of Rs.
215-340 on 14.05.1980 and was retired from his service on 28.02.2017 on attaining the age of
superannuation. After his retirement, the pension paper was submitted to the authorities for
processing his entitled retiral benefits. In due course of time, the office of the respondent no.2/third
respondent issued pension payment order along with the impugned statement showing the details
of calculation of his retirement benefits and deduction of overpayment from his gratuity and
dearness relief. He further submitted that the impugned portion of the statement dated 13.10.2017
shows the calculated amount of total dearness relief as Rs. 1,37,033/-;
Writ Appeal no. 116 of 2023 Page 3
gratuity payment order amount to Rs. 5,46,000/- and
commutation payment order amount to Rs. 2,97,148/-. While so, to the utter shock, an amount of
Rs. 5,82,002/- was deducted from the total amount of gratuity payment order of Rs. 5,46,000/- and
the remaining balance amount of Rs. 36,000/- from the amount of dearness relief of Rs. 1,37,033/-.
[5] According to the learned counsel for the respondent No. 1/petitioner there was an illegal
deduction/recovery for overpayment of a huge amount of Rs. 5,82,002/- and the same has been
completely curtailed and arbitrarily forfeited by the respondent authorities from the retirement
benefit of the respondent no.1/petitioner which would be impermissible in law. In fact, the aforesaid
deduction made the respondent no. 1/petitioner to suffer from untold miseries and hardships. Being
aggrieved by the action of appellants/respondents, the respondent No. 1/petitioner submitted a
representation on 19.08.2019 requesting refund of the said amount. Though the said representation
was duly received by the office of the appellants, no action has been taken till date.
Writ Appeal no. 116 of 2023 Page 4
[6] According to the respondent No. 1/petitioner that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7078280/ 2
The State Of Manipur Represented By The vs Shri Leishangthem Chandrakeshore ... on 19 July, 2024
the alleged overpayment by the official appellants/respondents was not on account of any
misrepresentation or fraud on the part of the respondent no.1/petitioner. Therefore, the respondent
no.1/petitioner cannot be held liable and made to suffer for the wrong committed by the officials.
The respondent no.1/petitioner is presently facing lot of hardship for survival with the meager
retirement benefits he is receiving after the deduction/recovery made by the appellants/respondents
authorities. Thus, a prayer has been made to dismiss the appeal as devoid of merit and to pass an
appropriate order for the ends of justice.
In support of his case, he has relied upon the following judgment;

learned counsel for the respondent No.2/third respondent submitted that on scrutiny of pension
papers and service records of the respondent No.1/petitioner, it was found that the respondent
No.1/petitioner was appointed as Road Mohorrir in the Scale of pay of Rs. 215-340/- w.e.f
14.05.1980. Under ROP 1999, the pay of the respondent no.1/petitioner was fixed in the scale of pay
of Rs. 3050-4590/- w.e.f. 01.01.1996. He was granted ACP-I in the scale of pay of Rs.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7078280/ 3
The State Of Manipur Represented By The vs Shri Leishangthem Chandrakeshore ... on 19 July, 2024
4000-100-6000/- and his pay was fixed at Rs. 4500/- on 01.07.2005 and ACP-II in the scale of pay
of Rs. 5000-150-8000 and his pay was fixed at Writ Appeal no. 116 of 2023 Page 6 Rs. 5,000/- on
01.07.2005. However, as per condition 8 of the conditions for grant of benefits under the ACP
Scheme as contained in Annexure-I to the office memorandum dated 20.07.2005 issued by the
Government of Manipur, Finance Department, the financial up gradation under the scheme shall be
given to the next higher grade in accordance with the existing hierarchy in the grade/category of
posts without creating new posts for the purpose. .
[8] The learned counsel for the respondent No. 2/third respondent further submitted that when the
respondent No.1/petitioner was entitled to financial up gradation under ACP- I and ACP-II w.e.f.
01.07.2005, his pay should have been fixed at Rs. 4,475/- in the scale of pay at Rs. 3200-4900/- i.e.
the next higher pay scale from his existing scale of Rs. 3050-4590/- but it was wrongly fixed at Rs.
4000-6000/- by jumping one additional stage under ROP Rules, 1999 and in ACP-II his pay should
have been fixed at Rs. 4,600/- in the scale of pay of Rs. 4000-6000/- i.e. next higher pay scale of Rs.
3200-4900/- but it was wrongly fixed at Rs. 5,000/- in the scale of pay of Rs. 5000-8000/-. He
further submitted that consequent on revision of pay under ROP 2010, the pay of the respondent
No.1/petitioner was fixed at Rs. 9,300/- in the pay band of Rs. 9300-34800/- with grade pay of Writ
Appeal no. 116 of 2023 Page 7 Rs. 4,200/- w.e.f. 01.01.2006 which should have been fixed at Rs.
8,560/- in pay band of Rs. 5200-20200/- with grade pay of Rs. 2,400/- w.e.f. 01.01.2006. Due to
non-fixation of pay to the corresponding higher scale of pay while granting financial up gradation
under ACP-I and ACP-II respectively and the non- fixation of pay in the corresponding pay band of
Rs. 5200- 20020/- with grade pay Rs. 2400/- w.e.f. 01.01.2006 under ROP Rules, 2010, there was
overpayment of pay and allowances amounting to Rs. 5,82,002/-.
[9] The learned counsel for the respondent No. 2/third respondent further submitted that the said
irregularities was intimated to the Chief Engineer, Minor Irrigation Department, Government of
Manipur on 28.06.2017. Pursuant to the said letter, the Chief Engineer submitted the service book
of the individual and the order dated 28.08.2017 for recovery of excess payment of pay and
allowances amounting to Rs 5,82,002/- vide letter dated 30.08.2017.
[10] The learned counsel for the respondent No.2/ third respondent further submitted that on the
basis of the consent certificate given by the respondent No.1/petitioner consenting that he has no
objection to the recovery of the Government dues/outstanding dues, if any found/detected from the
Writ Appeal no. 116 of 2023 Page 8 receivable retirement gratuity coupled with the order/decision
from the Executive Engineer, MID. The respondent no.2/third respondent settled the retiral
benefits of the respondent no.1/petitioner after adjusting the amount of Rs. 5,82,002/- being
overpayment of pay and allowances from the retirement gratuity of the respondent No.1/petitioner.
[11] The learned counsel for the respondent No.2/third respondent further submitted that the
officer of Accountant General/Principal Accountant General performs his/her duties within the
parameters laid down by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India in accordance with the
provision of the Constitution of India read with Comptroller and Auditor General's (Duties, Powers
and Conditions of Services) Act, 1971 (DPC Act, 1971 for short). The action of the respondent
no.2/third respondent is in accordance with the provisions of Rule 70(A), 71(2) and 73(3) of
Manipur Civil Services (Pension) Rule, 1977. He further submitted that the Principal Accountant

General/Accountant General is not responsible for the administrative function/decision of the State
authority except for compliance of the State authority in relation to GPF, Pension and gazette
entitlement. It is the say of the respondent No.2/third respondent that in accordance with Rule
70(A), 71(2) and 73(3) Writ Appeal no. 116 of 2023 Page 9 of Manipur Civil Services (Pension) Rule,
1977 read with the GI decision no. 6 below Rule 73 of the MCS (Pension) Rules, 1977, the respondent
No.2/third respondent settled the pension by deducting overpaid pay and allowances amounting to
Rs. 5,82,002/-.
In support of his case, the respondent No.2/third respondent relied upon the following Judgment;

729 of 2019, the Hon'ble Single Judge passed the impugned order dated 02.08.2023, the relevant
portion of the order reads as follows;
"34. For the reasons stated supra, this Court is of the view that the prayer made in the
writ petition is acceptable and accordingly, this Court is inclined to pass the following
order:
(i) The writ petition is allowed.
(ii) The portion of the impugned statement
dated 13.10.2017 issued by the office of the Accountant General, Manipur, whereby
Writ Appeal no. 116 of 2023 Page 11 deduction of a sum of Rs. 5,82,002/- is made
from the gratuity amount and dearness relief of the petitioner is set aside.
(iii) The official respondents are directed to refund the amount of Rs. 5,82,002/- to
the petitioner within a period of three months from the date of receipt of a copy of
this order.
(iv) There will be no order as to costs."
[13] Being aggrieved by the order dated 02.08.2023, the State appellants has preferred the present
appeal. The appellants contended that the impugned judgment suffers from serious error of facts
and law as the impugned judgment has been passed without considering the point raised by the
respondent. No. 2/third respondent. As per the appellants, the Hon'ble Single Judge has failed to
appreciate the undisputed factual position that the respondent No.1/petitioner was wrongly given
higher pay scales under ACP-I and ACP-II which was not entitled to him at the relevant point of
time and as such he was given higher pay scale in violation of the Rules. He further contended that it
will cause irreparable loss to the State Exchequer if the amount of Rs. 5,82,002/- is refunded to the
respondent No.1/petitioner.

The State Of Manipur Represented By The vs Shri Leishangthem Chandrakeshore ... on 19 July, 2024
In support of his case, the appellant relied upon the following judgment:
1. (2012) 8 SCC 417 - [Chandi Prasad Uniyal and others v. State of Uttarkhand and
others] Writ Appeal no. 116 of 2023 Page 12 "14. We are concerned with the excess
payment of public money which is often described as "taxpayers' money" which
belongs neither to the officers who have effected overpayment nor to the recipients.
We fail to see why the concept of fraud or misrepresentation is being brought in such
situations. The question to be asked is whether excess money has been paid or not,
may be due to a bona fide mistake. Possibly, effecting excess payment of public
money by the government officers may be due to various reasons like negligence,
carelessness, collusion, favouritism, etc. because money in such situation does not
belong to the payer or the payee. Situations may also arise where both the payer and
the payee are at fault, then the mistake is mutual. Payments are being effected in
many situations without any authority of law and payments have been received by the
recipients also without the authority of law can always be recovered barring few
exceptions of extreme hardships but not as a matter of right, in such situations law
implies an obligation on the payee to repay the money, otherwise it would amount to
unjust enrichment.
15. We are, therefore, of the considered view that except few instances pointed out in
Syed Abul Qadir case and in Col. B.J. Akkara case, the excess payment made due to
wrong/irregular pay fixation can always be recovered.
16. The appellants in the appeal will not fall in any of these exceptional categories,
over and above, there was a stipulation in the fixation order that in the condition of
irregular/wrong pay fixation, the institution in which the appellants were working
would be responsible for recovery of the amount received in excess from the
salary/pension. In such circumstances, we find no reason to interfere with the
judgment of the High Court. However, we order that the excess payment made be
recovered from the appellants salary in twelve equal monthly installments starting
from October, 2012."
2. (2016) 14 SCC 267 - [High Court of Punjab & Haryana vs. Jagdev Singh] "7. The
respondent challenged the action for recovery in writ proceedings under Article 226.
The petition was allowed by the impugned judgment of Writ Appeal no. 116 of 2023
Page 13 the High Court. The High Court found substance in the grievance of the
respondent that the excess payment made to him towards salary and allowance prior
to his retirement could not be recovered at that stage, there being no fraud or
misrepresentation on his part.
8. The order of the High Court has been challenged in these proceedings. From the
record of the proceedings, it is evident that when the respondent opted for the revised
pay scale, he furnished an undertaking to the effect that he would be liable to refund
any excess payment made to him. In the counter-affidavit which has been filed by the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7078280/ 7
The State Of Manipur Represented By The vs Shri Leishangthem Chandrakeshore ... on 19 July, 2024
respondent in these proceedings, this position has been specifically admitted.
Subsequently, when the Rules were revised and notified on 07-05-2003 it was found
that a payment in excess had been made to the respondent. On 18-02-2004, the
excess payment was sought to be recovered in terms of the undertaking.
12. For these reasons, the judgment of the High court which set aside the action for
recovery is unsustainable. However, we are of the view that the recovery should be
made in reasonable installments.
We direct that the recovery be made in equated monthly installments spread over a period of two
years."
3. (2008) 12 SCC 481 - [K.D. Sharma vs. Steel Authority of India Ltd. & Ors] "52. ........the appellant
has not come forward with all the facts. He has chosen to state the facts in the manner suited to him
by giving an impression to the writ court that an instrumentality of State (SAIL) has not followed
doctrine of natural justices and fundamental principles of fair procedure. This is not proper. Hence,
on that ground alone, the appellant cannot claim equitable relief....." [14] The learned counsel for
the respondent No. 1/petitioner submits that due to erroneous fixation of the pay scale of the
respondent No. 1/petitioner which had occurred during the year 2005-2006 was not on the fault,
Writ Appeal no. 116 of 2023 Page 14 misrepresentation or fraud of the petitioner but because of the
fault of the appellants/respondents. The arbitrary action of the respondents of making recovery,
after retirement of the petitioner from a Class-III service, the excess payment which had occurred
more than 10 years before the actual recovery was made in 2017 is highly iniquitous, unjustifiable
and arbitrary and causing untold hardships and miseries to the retired petitioner and his family.
[15] The learned for the respondent No. 1/petitioner further submits that it has become a general
norm in the State of Manipur where retired employees are compelled to a
letter/consent/undertaking of no-objection to recovery of any excess payment, against their
conscience, for speedy sanction of their pension proposals. In such a situation, if the retiring or
retired staff refused to give the kind of letter/consent/undertaking as aforesaid, the pension
proposal could not be processed. He further submits that the said consent letter was signed by the
respondent no.1/petitioner against his will for speedy sanction of his pension proposal.
In support of his case, he relied upon section 16 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, which reads as
follows:
Writ Appeal no. 116 of 2023 Page 15
"16.
(1) A contract is said to be induced by "undue influence" where the relations subsisting between the
parties are such that one of the parties is in a position to dominate the will of the other and uses that
position to obtain an unfair advantage over the other.
(2) In particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing principle, a person is
deemed to be in a position to dominate the will of the another-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7078280/ 8
The State Of Manipur Represented By The vs Shri Leishangthem Chandrakeshore ... on 19 July, 2024
(a) where he holds a real or apparent authority over the other, or where he stands in a fiduciary
relation to the other;"
He, further, submits that it is well settled that any consideration or object of an agreement which is
forbidden by law or which may cause injury to person or property of another or opposed to public
policy is unlawful. [16] We have heard the submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties
and also examined the materials placed before us in details. In the instant case, it is admitted
position of fact that the respondent No.1 (Principal respondent) was appointed as Road Mohorrir in
Minor Irrigation Department on 14.05.1980 and retired from service at the same post on 28.02.2017

But, the appellant authority deducted/recovered a sum of Rs. 5,82,002/- from the
total amount entitled to the respondent No. 1/petitioner as excess
payment/overpayment.
[17] From the material placed before us, it is evident that the respondent no.1 was
appointed in the year 1980 on regular basis as Road Mohorrir and retired in the same
post in the year 2017 i.e. for 37 years rendered his service for the Govt.
of Manipur. Even after almost 20 years, the appellant/respondent failed to take
initiative to modify or revoked the said impugned statement dated 13.10.2017 issued
by the Accountant General on which basis a sum Rs. 5, 82,002/- was recovered as
excess overpayment from the gratuity amount and dearness relief after his
retirement. In such situation, we are of considered view that at this point of time no
recovery can be made by the authorities from the retiral benefits and other service
benefits of the Writ Appeal no. 116 of 2023 Page 19 petitioner in view of the settled
principal of law laid down by the Apex Court as well as by this Court. In this regard,
we are relying on the Judgment rendered by the Apex Court in the case of "State of
Punjab & Ors vs. Rafique Masih (White Washer) & Ors." [(2015) 4 SCC 334] wherein
after referring to a number of its earlier judgments, it has been held by the Hon'ble
Apex Court as under:
"18. It is not possible to postulate all situations of hardship which would govern
employees on the issue of recovery, where payments have mistakenly been made by
the employer, in excess of their entitlement. Be that as it may, based on the decisions
referred to hereinabove, we may, as a ready reference, summarise the following few
situations, wherein recoveries by the employers, would be impermissible in law:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7078280/ 11
The State Of Manipur Represented By The vs Shri Leishangthem Chandrakeshore ... on 19 July, 2024
(i) Recovery from the employees belonging to Class III and Class IV service (or Group
C and Group D service)
(ii) Recovery from the retired employees, or the employees who are due to retire
within one year, of the order of recovery.
(iii) Recovery from the employees, when the excess payment has been made for a
period in excess of five years, before the order of recovery is issued.
(iv) Recovery in cases where an employee has wrongfully been required to discharge
duties of a higher post, and has been paid accordingly, even though he should have
rightfully been required to work against an inferior post.
(v) In any other case, where the court arrives at the conclusion, that recovery if made
from the employee, would be iniquitous or harsh or arbitrary to such an extent, as
would far outweigh the equitable balance of the employer's right to recover."
Writ Appeal no. 116 of 2023 Page 20 The learned Apex Court laid down few
guidelines wherein recoveries of the employees would be impermissible in law, such
situations are:- (i) recovery from the employees belonging to Class-III and Class-IV
service (or Group-C and Group-D service); (ii) recovery from the retired employees,
or the employees who are due to retire within one year, of the order of recovery; and
(iii) recovery from the employees, when excess payment has been made for a period
in excess of five years, before the order of recovery is issued.
[18] In the instant case, it is undeniable fact that the respondent No.1/petitioner holds Class - IV
(Group-D) post from the date of joining of his service till his retirement and since, any alleged
excess payment has been made decades back, we are of the considered view that it is not permissible
to make any recovery from the retirement benefit of the petitioner on ground of excess payment of
pay and allowances in view of the principle of law laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court reproduced
herein above.
[19] The jurisprudence relied upon by the appellants as reproduced above are not applicable in the
facts and circumstances of the instant case.
Writ Appeal no. 116 of 2023 Page 21
[20] For the reasons mentioned above, in our view, the
learned Single Judge rightly passed the impugned order wherein the learned Single Judge set aside
the portion of the impugned statement dated 13.10.2017 issued by the office of the Accountant
General Manipur, whereby deduction of a sum of Rs. 5,82,002/- made from the gratuity amount
and dearness relief of the respondent No. 1/petitioner with the direction to the appellants and the
respondent No. 2 to refund the deducted amount of Rs. 5,82,002/- to the respondent No.
1/petitioner. [21] Accordingly, the present writ appeal is dismissed with direction that the appellants

The State Of Manipur Represented By The vs Shri Leishangthem Chandrakeshore ... on 19 July, 2024
and respondent No. 2 are to refund the deducted amount of Rs. 5,82,002/-(Rupees five lakh eighty
two thousand and two) to the respondent No. 1/petitioner within a period of 2 months from the date
receipt of a copy of this order.
No order as to costs.
