ORDER
10.02.2023 For the purpose of protection of possession viz the State land measuring 16 kanals
falling under khasra no. 264(new) (356 old) of village Channi Rama, tehsil Bahu Jammu, the name
of the school is being used as a petitioner by one Abdul Gani Kohli to lay this writ petition for
seeking writ of certiorari for quashment of Circular no. 02- JK(Rev) 2023 dated 09.01.2023 issued
by the Govt. of UT of Jammu & Kashmir together with notice no. TB/PS/2022-23/02 dated
27.01.2023 issued by the respondent no. 5 whereby the said Mr. Abdul Gani Kohli has been asked to
vacate state land measuring 16 kanals falling under khasra no. 264(new) (356 old) of village Channi
Rama, tehsil Bahu Jammu.
For the purpose of showing the fact that at the site there is a school, annexure-2 to the writ petition
which is a Govt. Order no. 730- Edu of 2002 dated 24.04.2002 in terms whereof sanction came to
be accorded in favour of the B N Public School Nawabad Bathindi upto Class-8th, is being put to
expoit. It seems that the educational institution already existed at the state land and by virtue of this
sanction the recognition for the higher classes came to be ordered.
Be that as it may be, in the aforesaid Govt. order there is no reference to the fact that the site of the
school is on the state land but it seems that perhaps by using this Govt. order it is the State land

which came to be grabbed and building erected. The petitioner is also seeking mandamus unto the
respondents not to interfere or take over the possession of the land of the petitioner or demolish the

free land falling within the premises of the school except the school building and there shall be no
demolition of any part of the school building in retrieving the possession of the rest of the land.
