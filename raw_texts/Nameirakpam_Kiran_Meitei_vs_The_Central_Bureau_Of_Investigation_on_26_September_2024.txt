[3] The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner is a peace loving person who is
earning his livelihood by driving earth excavator (JCB) thereby feeding the hungry mouth of his
elderly parents, wife and 3 (three) children including a minor daughter.
P a g e 2 | 16 He further submits that the petitioner is residing at a village which is near a kuki village
and is at great peril in consideration with the present scenario. In the second week of May, 2023 one
Suranjoy, a friend of the petitioner had shared a video to the petitioner of an incident which has
become viral recently of crime committed against 2 (two) kuki women. On 24th July, 2023, the
petitioner was called by the Superintendent of Police, Thoubal for some consultation and discussion,
however upon reaching the office of the Superintendent of Police, Thoubal, the petitioner was
arrested in connection with FIR No. 110(06)2023 NSK PS U/s 153A/ 398/ 427/ 436/ 448/ 302/
354/ 364/ 326/ 376/ 34 IPC. Since then, the petitioner is in judicial custody. He further submits
that the petitioner has no connection nor committed any of the crimes/offences as mentioned in the
above referred FIR but the only fault of the petitioner is that he had received the video from one
Suranjoy however he has neither shown nor shared the said video to any other individual(s).
[4] The learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that the Commissioner (Home),
Government of Manipur issued Notification No. 12/1(4)/2023-H(CBI) dated 26th July, 2023
whereby in pursuant of the provisions of Section 6 of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act,

out of the same facts. [5] The learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that the police have
falsely implicated the petitioner in the above referred FIR and is not involved in any criminal
activities till date. He further P a g e 4 | 16 submits that the petitioner had filed Cril. Misc. (B) Case
No. 271 of 2023 before the Court of Sessions Judge, Thoubal for granting bail in connection with the
above referred FIR however, the same was transferred to the Court of Special Judge (SC&ST) PoA,
Thoubal and the bail application of the petitioner was heard along with the other individuals who
were arrested in connection with the said incident of parading naked of 2(two) ladies being FIR No.
ZERO (91)(5)2023 SKL- PS U/s 153A/ 398/ 427/ 436/ 448/ 302/ 354/ 364/ 326/ 376/ 34 IPC &
25(1-C) A. Act. He further submits that even though the petitioner has not been booked/ charged
under any of the provision of Schedule Cast and Schedule Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989,
the Court of Special Judge (SC&ST) PoA, Thoubal heard the bail application of the petitioner's along
with other bail application which were booked/ charged under the SC & ST (PoA) Act, 1989.
[6] Accordingly to the learned counsel for the petitioner, the I/O for the CBI had concealed the
whole fact that the petitioner was not booked/ charge under the SC&ST (PoA), Act, 1989 and
submitted their "Petition for further extension of Judicial Custody of the accused persons for 15
days" on 31.08.2023 for all the persons arrested under FIR No. 110(06)2023 NSK-PS who were
booked/ charged under the SC&ST Act, even though the petitioner has been arrested under the
provisions of the Indian Penal Code only and not under the SC&ST Act, Arms Act and IT Act. He
further submits that during the relevant period P a g e 5 | 16 of time, internet including mobile as
well as broadband was suspended in the state of Manipur and thus, the alleged allegation of the I/O
of CBI that the petitioner had shared the said video in social media is totally baseless, concocted and
has no legs to stand. [7] The learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that on 04.09.2023
after hearing both the parties, the Court of Special Judge (SC&ST) PoA, Thoubal passed the
impugned Common order thereby dismissing the bail application of the petitioner on the ground
that all the accused including the petitioner has a possibility of absconding from the jurisdiction of
the court. He further contended that while passing the impugned order, the Special Judge (SC&ST)
PoA, Thoubal treated the petitioner as if he was involved in the said crime and dismissed/rejected
the bail application and he further submits that in the bail objection report dated 31.08.2023 of the
I/O of the CBI nowhere is there any allegation that the petitioner was involved in the said crime nor
was he even present at the scene of crime. [8] The learned counsel for the petitioner further submits
that the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in a catena of judgments have held that although bail is an
exception of serious offences, but it is also true that a person cannot be detained where there is no
evidence connecting him with the crime or if the circumstances are such which raise a doubt of his
involvement in the crime. Nowhere in the report dated 31.08.2023 of the I.O. of CBI is there any
statement that the P a g e 6 | 16 petitioner was involved in the said offence and that the only
allegation against the petitioner is that he had received the video of the said crime over his mobile
phone.
[9] The learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that the alleged allegation of presence of
accused in the above referred FIR at the spot during the relevant period of time as mentioned in the
Report of I/O of CBI dated 31-08-2023 is quite vague and cannot be treated as a ground for denying
bail to the humble petitioner as the alleged allegation is based on the analysis of the CDRs and
Tower Dump. He further submits that the crime scene is at a distance of about 5-6 kms from the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187936546/ 3
Nameirakpam Kiran Meitei vs The Central Bureau Of Investigation ... on 26 September, 2024
residence of the humble petitioner and thus it is quite likely that both the locations are covered by
the same Mobile Tower and thus the analysis of CDRs and Tower Dump only indicates that the
humble petitioner was at a location covered by the mobile network tower of the crime scene and
thus not necessarily mean that the petitioner was present at the spot of the crime. He further
submits that the grant or refusal to grant bail lies within the discretion of the Court, however right to
bail is not to be denied merely because of the sentiments of the community against the accused. The
primary purpose of bail in a criminal case are to relieve the accused of imprisonment, to relieve the
state of the burden of keeping him, pending the trial, and at the same time, to keep the accused
constructively in the custody of the court, whether before or after conviction, to assure that he will
submit P a g e 7 | 16 to the jurisdiction of the court and be in attendance thereon whenever his
presence is required.
[10] The learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that time and again the Hon'ble Supreme
Court is of the foremost view that where the court is of the considered view that the accused has
joined investigation and he is fully cooperating with the investigating agency and is not likely to
abscond, in that event, custodial interrogation should be avoided. A great ignominy, humiliation and
disgrace is attached to the arrest. Arrest leads to many serious consequences not only for the
accused but for the entire family and at times for the entire community. Also submitted that the
name of the petitioner does not appear in the FIR No. 110(06)2023 NSK-PS u/s 153A/ 398/ 427/
436/ 448/ 302/ 354/ 364/ 326/ 376/ 34 IPC & 25(1-C)A. Act, added u/s 376- D IPC & Section
3(1)(d), 3(1)(e), 3(1)(g), 3(1)(w(i)), 3(1)(z), 3(2)(iii), 3(2)(iv), 3(2)(v) of SC&ST (POA), Act, 1989.
[11] The learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that the petitioner had already
approached the Court of Special Judge, CBI, Kamrup for granting bail in connection with CBI Case
No. RC 0562023500012/ CBI/SCB/Kolkata U/s 120B, 147, 148, 149, 153A, 302, 354, 354-B, 34,
376(2)(g) and 376-D IPC, Section 3(1)d, 3(1)e, 3(1)g, 3(1)w(i) & 3(2)v of SC & ST (PoA) Act, 1989
however the same was rejected vide order dated 04-01-2024. The relevant portion of the order
dated 04-01-2024 reads as under:
P a g e 8 | 16 "A perusal of the charge sheet shows that the investigation has revealed
that the accused applicant along with A-3, A-4 and A-5 were identified by the victims
as they were in the mob and involved in the naked parading and sexual and physical
assault of the victims and the murder of S. Vaiphei and N. Vaiphei.
I have perused the CD and the having regards to the incriminating materials and the
heinous nature of the alleged offences, as well as the current volatile situation
obtaining in the state of Manipur and the public impact, the prayer for bail stands
rejected at this stage. Instant Misc. Case stands disposed of. Return back the CD."
He further submits that the Learned CBI Court, Kamrup has failed to appreciate the
fact that the petitioner had filed a bail application and the trial of the case is yet to
commence however, the Learned CBI Court, Kamrup have a premeditated mind that
the petitioner is guilty of the offence even before commencement of trial. Also
submitted that the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in a catena of judgments have
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187936546/ 4
Nameirakpam Kiran Meitei vs The Central Bureau Of Investigation ... on 26 September, 2024
held that an accused is to be treated as innocent until proven guilty.
[12] The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the CBI in their reply
affidavit filed before the Learned CBI Court, Kamrup have stated at sub-para 6 of
para 21 that further investigation of the case is in progress to ascertain the role of the
other accused persons in the commission of the heinous crime of rape of 02 victims...
He further submits that when the Charge-sheet has already been filed, the question of
further investigation does not arise at all. However, the CBI has stated that further
investigation is required even after filing of charge sheet in the present case. The only
reason for rejecting the bail P a g e 9 | 16 application filed by the petitioner before the
Learned Court of CBI, Kamrup as provided by the CBI is that there is every possibility
of tampering with evidence and influencing the witness, if the accused is enlarged on
bail. Here, he further mentioned that the only piece of evidence against the petitioner
is his mobile phone which has already been seized by the police since day one.
Further, the victims are located at a secured location which is known only to the CBI
and thus the question of tampering the evidence and influencing the witness does not
arise at all. Furthermore, the Learned CBI Court, Kamrup is fixed on the question as
to how the petitioner had received the video from one Suranjoy. He further
mentioned that receiving the video was not the issue in the present case but the
further forwarding of the videos in the internet and other social media websites. [13]
Learned Sr. PCCG submitted affidavit in opposition on behalf of the respondent
narrating the prosecution story that the case was registered on the basis of a written
complaint of Mr. Thangboi Vaiphei, Chief of Village-B Phainom against unknown
miscreants alleging physical assault & gang-rape of women victims, murder of father
and brother of one of the women victim and other offences took place on 04.05.2023.
On the basis of the aforesaid complaint, on 18.05.2023, FIR bearing No. ZERO
(91)(5)2023 was registered at Saikul-PS U/s 153A/ 398/ 427/ 436/ 448/ 302/ 354/
364/ 326/ 376/ 34 IPC & 25(1-C) Arms Act, thereafter, the case was transferred to P a
g e 10 | 16 Nongpok Sekmai PS, Thoubal District, Manipur and re-registered as FIR
No. 110(06)2023 NSK-PS dated 21.06.2023. The investigation of local police surfaced
active roles of accused persons namely (i) Huirem Herodash Meitei, (ii) Arun
Khundongbam, (iii) Ningombam Tomba Singh and they were taken into police
remand till 31.07.2023.
[14] Learned Sr. PCCG further submitted that the investigation of the case revealed that
Yumlembam Jiban Singh was directly involved in the incident and he has recorded the alleged video
clip that depicts the assault and parading of the victims. Subsequently, he shared the video clip with
CCL Yumlembam Nungshithoi Meitei & others, which ultimately led to its widespread
dissemination on social media. Yumlembam Jiban Singh was arrested by the Local Police on July
20, 2023 and taken into police remand till 31.07.2023. It also surfaced that CCL Yumlembam
Nungshithoi Meitei, who received the aforementioned video clip from Yumlembam Jiban Singh.
Following this, CCL shared the video clip with Pukhrihongbam Suranjoy Meitei. As a result of these
actions, CCL was apprehended by the Thoubal Police on July 21, 2023. Subsequently, CCL was
presented before the Principal Magistrate of the Juvenile Justice Board in Thoubal and was

Nameirakpam Kiran Meitei vs The Central Bureau Of Investigation ... on 26 September, 2024
subsequently transferred to Nirmal Foundation in Kairong. Imphal East for safe custody. It is also
surfaced that Pukhrihongbam Suranjoy Meitei received the alleged video clip from CCL
Yumlembam Nungshithoi Meitei, proceeded to share it with Nameirakpam Kiran Meitei and four
other individuals.
P a g e 11 | 16 Consequently, this sharing of the video led to its widespread dissemination on social
media platforms. Pukhrihongbam Suranjoy Meitei was arrested by the Thoubal Police on July 22,
2023 and taken into police remand till 01.08.2023. The accused Nameirakpam Kiran Meitei,
received the video clip from Pukhrihongbam Suranjoy Meitei. Subsequently, Nameirakpam Kiran
Meitei shared the video clip with others, resulting in the video's eventual viral spread on social
media platforms. Based on these findings, Nameirakpam Kiran Meitei was arrested by the Manipur
police on July 24, 2023 and he was taken into police remand till 01.08.2023 and produced before
the Ld. Court on 01.08.2023, and the Court extended the judicial custody of accused persons
including Nameirakpam Kiran Meitei from time to time. Since then the accused/petitioner is in
Judicial custody. [15] Learned Sr. PCCG further submitted that on 04.09.2023 the Ld. Court of
Special Judge (SC & ST, PoA), Thoubal rejected the bail petition of the accused including
Nameirakpam Kiran Meitei. Thereafter, on 13.09.2023 in the light of order dated 25.08.2023 of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Special Leave Petition (Civil) Diary no. 19206/2023 and to

& ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 and substantive offences thereof keeping further
investigation open u/s 173 (8) Cr.P.C. He further submits that, the Bail application filed by the
petitioner before the Hon'ble High Court of Manipur is lacking in jurisdiction and not maintainable
in the light of the order dated 25.08.2023 of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Special Leave P
a g e 13 | 16 Petition (Civil) Diary No. 19206/2023 and subsequent notification dated 31.08.2023 of

following judgment;

(ii) Misc Case (CBI) No. 8/2024 (arising out of FIR No. RC0562023S0012, CBI, SCB, Kolkata) -
[Special Judge, CBI, Assam, Guwahati] [18] After the Hon'ble Supreme Court's order dated
25.08.2023 passed in Special Leave Petition (Civil) Diary No. 19206/2023 and subsequent
notification dated 31.08.2023 of the Hon'ble High Court, Guwahati and al the connected case
records from the file of the Ld. Spl. Judge, SC/ST, (PoA), Thoubal to the Ld. CBI and NIA, Assam,
(District & Sessions Judge, Kamrup) (Metro, Guwahati, Assam. Thereafter, the arrested accused
persons were produced before the Ld. Court and the custody of the present petition with other
accused were extended from time to time. Further, it is admitted position of the fact that the
petitioner filed/approached the Court of P a g e 14 | 16 Spl. Judge, CBI, Kamrup for granting bail
with CBI Case No. RC 0562023500012/ CBI/SCB/Kolkata U/s 120B, 147, 148, 149, 153A, 302, 354,
354-B, 34, 376(2)(g) and 376-D IPC, Section 3(1)d, 3(1)e, 3(1)g, 3(1)w(i) & 3(2)v of SC & ST (PoA)
Act, 1989. However, the same was rejected vide order dated 04-01-2024.
Further, it is also admitted position of fact that charge sheet was already filed in connection with the
case against the present accused/petitioner with other co-accused and the same is pending before
the Court of Spl. Judge, CBI, Kamrup for trial. The coordinate Bench of this High Court vide order
dated 22.12.2023 passed Bail Appln. No. 27 of 2023 wherein, the present accused/petitioner is one
of the petitioner, in para No. 10 and 11 of the order observed the following:
"[10] This Court has considered the submissions made with regard to the
maintainability of the bail application and has perused the materials on record. It is
clear from the order dated 25.08.2023 passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that
further proceedings of 27 cases (including the present case) would be conducted at
Guwahati due to the prevailing situations in Manipur. Courts have been identified in
Guwahati for the said purpose. The limited jurisdiction of recording statements
under Section 164 CrPC and conducting TIPs in Manipur is aimed at facilitating the
investigation and the same cannot be stretched conferring parallel jurisdiction in
Manipur even after transfer. Now, the chargesheet has been filed by the CBI before
the Special Court at Guwahati.
P a g e 15 | 16 [11] In the circumstances, this Court is of the considered view that it
may no longer be proper to entertain these bail applications, even though the
impugned common order dated 04.09.2023 was passed by a Court within the
territorial jurisdiction of this Court. Without expressing any opinion on the merit of
the case the bail applications are disposed of with a liberty to the accused persons to
approach competent courts at Guwahati, if so advised. No cost."
[19] In view of the admitted position of the facts and circumstances as discussed above and taking
into consideration the observation made herein above by the coordinate Single Bench of this High
Court, I am of the considered view that this Court lacks jurisdiction to deal with the case. Without
going into the merit of the case, the present application is dismissed as lack of jurisdiction.
