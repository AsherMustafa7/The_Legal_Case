3. As per the prosecution case, the F.I.R. of the complainant, who is wife of the applicant was
registered on 16.11.2023 through her application dated 06.11.2023, wherein she has made allegation
against her husband (applicant), mother-in-law and father-in-law alleging inter alia that she was
married about six years ago with the applicant and from the wedlock of the applicant, she gave birth
to a daughter, therefore her husband remained angry and unhappy, due to which after drinking
alcohol he used to harass and beat her every day on the pretext of bringing less dowery, whereas
sufficient dowry was given by her father, even then she was harassed and tortured in her
matrimonial home. After giving birth to a girl child, she was continuously harassed, tortured and
threatened to death. She did not tell anyone out of fear of shame and her mother-in-law and
father-in-law were saying that they will get the applicant married again. On account of harassment
she was living in her parental home. On 27.02.2023 applicant came to her parental home, and
enticed away her minor sister aged about 16 years, regarding which, a first information report was
lodged and applicant was sent to jail. After releasing on bail, the applicant again on 23.08.2023
lured her younger minor sister from Indian Bank, Mau and on the pretext of taking her home, he
was taking her towards Prayagraj, which was seen on the way by her nephew. His mobile was
switched off. Regarding the said incident application was given to police on 25.08.2023 but no
action was taken.
4. It is contended by learned counsel for the applicant that the F.I.R. was lodged after delay of three
months. The victim was recovered on 10.01.2024 and thereafter her statement under Section 161
and 164 Cr.P.C. was recorded, in which she has stated that she went with the applicant with her own
will. As per medical-examination report dated 11.01.2024 of the victim, she is aged about 17 years
and no injury was found on her body. It is also submitted that there is a dispute of a sum of Rs.
2,00,000/-, which has been borrowed by the father of the complainant from the applicant, due to
which he has been falsely implicated in this case. Victim also gave an affidavit before the trial court
on 22.08.2024 in favour of the applicant. Lastly, it is submitted by the learned counsel for the
applicant that the applicant is languishing in jail since 28.07.2024. Apart from this case applicant
has criminal history of one case being Case Crime No. 37 of 2023, under Sections 363, 366A I.P.C.,
Police Station Mau, District Chitrakoot, in which he is on bail, which has been explained in
paragraph No. 19 of the affidavit. In case, the applicant is released on bail, he will not misuse the
liberty of bail.
5. Per contra, learned Additional Government Advocate for the State as well as learned counsel for
the informant opposed the prayer for bail of the applicant by contending that the victim is minor girl
aged about 17 years. The applicant was continuously harassing and torturing his wife for additional
dowry. As per the prosecution case, the applicant was having an ill eye on the victim. Prior to the
incident dated 23.08.2023, the applicant enticed away the victim on 27.02.2023 also for which a
F.I.R. was already lodged, which was registered at Case Crime No. 37 of 2023 for the offence under
Sections 363 and 366A I.P.C. He threatened his wife and her family members. Considering the
gravity of offence, the bail application of the applicant is liable to be rejected.
6. Having heard learned counsel for the parties and examined the matter in its entirety, I find that
victim is minor child aged about 17 years and also sister-in-law of the applicant. The consent of
minor child is immaterial under the law. It is a second incident of enticing the minor victim.

Devideen vs State Of Up And 3 Others on 2 January, 2025
Marriage of the applicant with the elder sister of the victim was solemnized six years back and from
said marriage, he has a girl child. Wife of the applicant is living separately with her daughter in her
parental house. In view of Section 29 of the Protection of Children From Sexual Offences Act,
presumption shall also be drawn against the accused-applicant unless contrary is proved by the
accused.
7. This Court cannot overlook the gravity of the conduct of the applicant, where he is engaged in an
illicit relationship with his minor sister-in-law. Such behaviour not only constitutes a breach of the
sacred bond of marriage but also represents an egregious violation of familial trust and moral
integrity. The sanctity of marriage is a cornerstone of societal and familial harmony, and any act
undermining it causes profound emotional and psychological harm. The applicant's actions have
inflicted severe traumas upon the wife, shattering her trust and dignity, and have irreparably
strained the relationship between two sisters. This Court notes that such behaviour disrupts not just
the marital relationship but the broader family unit, leading to discord and instability. The act of the
applicant reflects a disregard for these foundational principles and for his responsibilities both as a
husband and as a member of the family. Such conduct is unequivocally condemned by both the
societal norms and the law.
8. Considering the overall facts and circumstances of the case as well as keeping in view the
submissions advanced on behalf of parties, gravity of offence, role assigned to applicant, criminal
history of the applicant, nature of injury and severity of punishment, I do not find any good ground
to release the applicant on bail.
9. Accordingly, the bail application is rejected.
10. It is made clear that the observations contained in the instant order is confined to the issue of
bail and shall not affect the merit of the trial.
