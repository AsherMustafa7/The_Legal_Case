Additional District Judge, Khachrod, District Ujjain in MJC No.44/96 by which reference petition
filed by the appellant for enhancement of compensation under Section 18 of the Land Acquisition
Act, 1894(in short ...

5. Final publication of Section 4(1) Notification was made on 27/12/1991. The declaration under
Section (6) was made on 7/02/1992. On 5/02/1994, the Land Acquisition Officer awarded

6. In the present bunch of appeals, all the land owners are of village Bagla. Being aggrieved by the
award passed by the Land Acquisition Officer, on 5/02/1994, reference under Section 18 of the Act

On 25/06/1997 Reference Court dismissed the reference petition and upheld the award passed by
Land Acquisition Officer on 5/02/1994. The appellant/landowner challenged the said order by filing
F.A. No. 465/1997. The Division Bench of this Court considering the law laid down by the Apex

6/03/2000 and remitted the matter back to the Reference Court for permitting the parties to lead
the evidence by examining the vendor and vendees, of the instances cited before the authorities
before which the documents are produced. Order dated 6.3.2000 reads as under :-
6.3.2000 In view of the latest judgment of the Supreme Court in AIR 1997 SC 2600
by agreement of the parties, allowed the appeal and remitted the matter back to the
Reference Court for permitting the parties to lead the evidence by examining the
vendor and vendees, of the instances cited before the authorities before which the
documents are produced.
Since the order is passed on agreement without hearing the matter on merits, court fee of 75%,
therefore, will be refunded to the petitioner by crossed cheque in their account. Record of court
below be sent back immediately. Parties to appear before the trial Court on 17.4.2000 and the same
shall be disposed off as far as possible preferrably by or before 31.8.2000. C.c

Ex-P/1, P/2, P/3, P/4 and P/5 of 0.11 hectares, 0.46 hectares, 0.21 hectares, 0.41 hectares and 0.35
hectares respectively. All the aforesaid sale- deeds were executed between 29/07/1991 to

employer of Sub- Registrar Office of Tehsil Khachrod of District Dhar.
9. Hari Singh(NA1) in para - 26 of the his statement has very categorically admitted that at the time
of acquisition, the market value of Unirrigated land was Rs.50,000/- per hectare.
10. Ramesh Sisodiya(NA2) on the basis of Collector's guidelines has deposed that in the year
1998-89, 89-90 and 90- 91, as per guidelines, the value of the land per hectare was Rs.11,000/-,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/188822804/ 2
Resham Bai vs The State Of M.P. on 12 January, 2017
Rs.15,000/- and Rs.17,000/- respectively. The value of irrigated land was one and a half times
higher than non- irrigated land. In respect of mango Tree, he has deposed that the value was
Rs.500/- per tree and Rs. 250/- per trees in respect of custard apple.
11. BharatsinghPW1) in his statement has deposed that Ex- P/1 was executed on 29/07/1991 in
respect of an area of 0.11 Hectare for a consideration of Rs.10,000/-. Balusingh (PW4) and
Omkarsingh(PW7) have proved the execution of sale- deeds(Ex-P/2 & P/3). All the witnesses in
their statement has deposed that at the time of acquisition, the market value of land in question was
Rs.60,000/- per hectare for unirrigated land and Rs.90,000/- per hectare for irrigated land.
12. The learned Tribunal considering the fact that big chunk of land i.e. 60.833 hectares was
acquired for construction of pond and acquired land is not adjoining to the city, assessed at the rate
of Rs.20,000/- per hectare for unirrigated land and Rs.30,000/- per hectare for irrigated land. In
respect of Mango trees, he awarded Rs.500 per tree and Rs.250 per tree in respect of fifty custard
apple along with interest @ 12% and solatium @ 30%.
13. Learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that Hari Sigh(NA1), Patwari, witness of
respondent, in para - 26 of his statement very categorically stated that at the time of acquisition,
market value of land was Rs.50,000/- per hectare for unirrigated land, and, thus, the learned
Tribunal has committed an error in awarding at the rate of Rs.30,000/- per hectare. He submitted
that an admission is the best evidence that an opposing party can rely upon, and, although it is not
conclusive, is often decisive of the matter unless it can be successfully withdrawn or proved to be
erroneous. He also submitted that the land was acquired in December, 1991. and no guidelines for
the relevant period from 1991-1992 was filed by the respondents to prove the rate fixed by the
Collector and submitted that the compensation be enhanced from Rs.20,000/- per hectare to
Rs.50,000/- per hectare in respect of unirrigated land, on the basis of admissions made by Hari
Singh(NA1)and appeal be allowed accordingly.
14. Shri Piyush Jain, learned Govt. Advocate for the respondent/State has drawn our attention to the
finding recorded by the learned Reference Court and submitted that the admissions made by
Patwari was considered in para - 26 of the impugned award. The Patwari, without any basis made
the aforesaid statement and, therefore, the same was not relied by the learned Reference Court. He
submitted that the learned reference Court considered each and every point raised by the land
owners and after considering the oral and documentary evidence of the parties, awarded
compensation. No case to interfere with the impugned order, as prayed is made out and prays for
dismissal of the first appeal.
15. Against the similar award dated 1/08/2000, F.A. No.23/2001 was filed by the land owner. The
learned Single Judge, by order dated 4th November, 2004, awarded compensation @ Rs. 45,000/-
per hectare for irrigated land and Rs.30,000/- for unirrigated land. In the aforesaid appeal also
same sale deeds were relied by the learned Single Judge. Para 7 to 11 of order dated 4/11/2004
passed in F.A. No.23/2001 reads as under :-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/188822804/ 3
Resham Bai vs The State Of M.P. on 12 January, 2017
7. The main argument of the learned counsel for the appellant is that the learned
Judge has committed an error of law only relying evidence of Non-applicant No.2
Ramesh Sisodiya, who was Clerk in the Registration Office in fixing the compensation
of the land. There was other evidence with regard to registration of sale deeds and the
oral evidence has also been overlooked by the learned Judge. Hence, the award is
perverse.
8. it is well settled law that market value of the land which has to be determined on
the date of Notification under Section 4(1) must reflect the true value of the property.
Hon'ble Supreme Court in (2003) 4 SCC 481, Ravinder Narain and Another Vs.
Union of India has discussed the concept of market value. Following the decision of
AIR 1939 PC 98, Vyricheria Narayana Gajapatiraju Vs. Revenue Divisional Officer is
as under :-
"While determining the market value of the land acquired, it has to be correctly
unjust enrichment on the part of the acquirer Owner. The price which a willing
vendor might reasonably expect to receive from the willing purchaser must be taken
into consideration while at the same t6ime disinclination of the vendor to part with
his land and the urgent necessity of the purchaser to buy it must be disregarded.
Potentiality of land is also to be considered based on material as are available."
Learned court further considered with regard to requisites for a sale to merit consideration a
comparable sale is in Para-9 of the Judgment, which is as under :-
(1) When sale is within a reasonable time of the date of notification under Section 4
(1);
(2) it should be a bonafide transaction, (3) it should be of the land acquired or of the
land adjacent to the land acquired; and (4) it should possess similar advantages.
Following the judgment of Hobn'ble S.C. reported in AIR 1959 SC 429.
9. Hon'ble Supreme Court in 2003 Vo. X SCC 86 Virender Singh Vs. Union of India has held that :-
" The High Court placed strong reliance on sale deeds executed just before the award
was passed. They were neither relied upon by the claimants nor by the Government,
but were brought on record by the vendees who were respondents before the civil
court. Those sale transactions do iot furnish real indicia of the market value of the
land as the sales were effected at an advanced stage of land acquisition proceedings.
such sales rushed through, for whatever reason it be, just before the award came to be
passed- cannot be taken to reflect the true value of the land. Even if they are genuine,
the bargaining power of the vendors who are statutorily compelled to part with the
ownership and possession within close proximity of time would be limited. No
reasonable and prudent purchaser would buy the land with full market value at that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/188822804/ 4
Resham Bai vs The State Of M.P. on 12 January, 2017
juncture, knowing fully well that the land is under immediate peril of acquisition.
Therefore, it is not safe to placed reliance on those sale deeds for arriving at the
market value of the land in question."
Hon'ble S.C. Further in 2003 Vol. 10 SCC 529 Bhim Singh and others Vs. State of Haryana and
Another has held that the sale value of smaller portions cannot be relied on for the basis of
determining the compensation of larger area acquired. Some deductions to be made whether on
area has been acquired.
10. On the above principles laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court it has to be seen that would be the
real price of the land. Plaintiff has filed five sale deeds with regard to adjacent areas for fixing the
compensation which are as under :-
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sr. Village of Sale of Sale of Sale Average Date of No.

1. Piploda 0-11 irrigated 10,000 90,910 29-7-91
2. Piploda 0-46 non-irrigated 35,000 76,081 9-2-92
3. Nagfiri 0-21 irrigated 15,000 71,428 4-2-93
4. Bhagla 0-41 non-irrigated 16,000 38,277 24-2-92
5. Navda 0-35 non-irrigated 52,500 50,000 19-4-94
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11. It is clear from the sale deed that only one sale deed of period Piploda which is for an area of 0.11
hectare is dated 29-7-1991 and as per that sale ded the costs of the land comes to 90.910 hectare. All
other sale deed are after the notification and those sale deeds cannot be relied upon and this sale
deed is also for a smaller area. Hence, as per decisions of Hon'ble Supreme Court, some deductions
has to be made. Looking to the value as per the sale deed, the evidence of Patwari and evidence of all
other witnesses. The value of the land as per my opinion could be Rs.45,000/- per hectare for
irrigated land and Rs.20,000/- for non-irrigated land. On the basis of the above findings the award
is modified to the extent as follows :-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/188822804/ 5
Resham Bai vs The State Of M.P. on 12 January, 2017
a) Defendants is to pay the appellant the compensation of land situated at village Bhagla of Survey
No.5/2 and 105/2 area 1.568 hectare and 0.348 hectare, total area 1.916 hectare at the rate of
Rs.30,000/- for non-
irrigated and Rs.45,000/- for irrigated land. Respondents have already paid at the rate of
Rs.20,000/- for non-irrigated and Rs.30,000/- for irrigated land.
Hence, they have to pay only difference amount as compensation of the land held above.
b) Defendants would also pay, as per Section 23(2) of the Act 30% solatium on difference amount.
c) Respondents would further directed to pay the interest on difference amount with effect from 13-
12-1991 at the rate of 9% per annum.
Appeal is disposed of accordingly.
16. We have considered rival submissions of the counsel appearing for the parties. Perused the
record, the impugned award as also the evidence available in the case.
17. The procedure adopted by the Reference Court in assessing the market price of the irrigated
lands of village Bagla is not proper. The reference Court should have assessed first the market price
of the unirrigated lands on the basis of the evidence available on record and thereafter should have
assessed market price of the irrigated lands. So far as the finding of the reference Court for the
assessment of the market price of the unirrigated lands, on the basis of the evidence available, is well
founded and based on proper appreciation of the evidence on record. The law is well settled on the
point that market price of the big plot is lesser in comparison to the market price of the smaller
plots. Taking into consideration, the aforesaid facts the market price of the unirrigated lands having
larger area may be assessed after deducting 20% in the market price of the lands assessed for the
smaller plots.
18. The Award of the Reference Court with regard to compensation for the well situated in the
acquired lands and rise in the amount of compensation under Section 23 of the Act and interest
under Section 28 of the Act, require no interference in this appeal and this part of the award is
accordingly upheld.
19. Looking to the value as per my opinion could be Rs.45,000/- per hectare for irrigated land and
Rs.30,000/- for non-irrigated land.
20. Consequently, this appeal is partly allowed and the impugned award dated 1/08/2000 is hereby
set aside. The compensation is enhanced only to the extent indicated above. The appellant are in
addition entitled to the compensation in terms of Section 23 of the Act and interest in view of the
Section 28 of the Act, on enhanced amount of compensation. The LAO / Reference Court is directed
to calculate and reassess the compensation payable to the appellant in the terms indicated above.
