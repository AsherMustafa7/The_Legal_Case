CORAM: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE
and
HONOURABLE JUSTICE SMT. ANJANA MISHRA
ORAL JUDGMENT
(Per: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE)
Date : 05-02-2019
These appeals have been filed by the State of Bihar
raising a common question while assailing the impugned
judgement of the learned Single Judge dated 28th of November,
2017 whereby the benefit of Assured Career Progression
(A.C.P.) to the respondent-petitioners has been extended
keeping in view the earlier decision in C.W.J.C. Nos. 18015 of
2011 (Pramod Kumar Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors.) and 16346
of 2011 (Ashok Kumar & Ors. Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors.).
Patna High Court LPA No.408 of 2018 dt.05-02-2019

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/14038397/ 11
The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Amresh Kumar Sinha And Ors on 5 February, 2019
The relief prayed for and the minimum bare facts
for appreciating the controversy have been set out in extensive
detail by the learned Single Judge in the impugned judgement.
The stand of the Government has also been noted including the
counter affidavits filed by the State.
The contention on behalf of the appellant State is
that the respondent petitioners cannot be extended the benefit of
the A.C.P. as they do not possess the minimum eligibility
qualification of graduation, which is the qualification prescribed
for promotion to the next higher post of Accounts Officer, and
which is required to be compulsorily possessed keeping in view
Rule 4 (5) of the Bihar State Employees Conditions of Service
(Assured Career Progression Scheme) Rules, 2003 (hereinafter
referred to as the A.C.P. Scheme Rules).
To appreciate the controversy raised, Rule 4(5) of
the Rule is extracted hereinbelow:-
"(5) The prescribed requirements and
mode of sanction of financial progression under the
scheme shall be the same which are prescribed
under the Recruitment/Service Rules for regular
promotion against vacancies. If the
Rules/Resolutions prescribe passing of the
departmental examination or any qualification for
promotion that shall also be an essential
condition for sanction of benefit under the
scheme, provided that after completion of 12/24
Patna High Court LPA No.408 of 2018 dt.05-02-2019
12/29
years of service, the financial progression shall
become due and for this, there shall be no bar of
period prescribed for regular promotion."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/14038397/ 12
The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Amresh Kumar Sinha And Ors on 5 February, 2019
The respondent-petitioners pleaded that these
issues have been thrashed out in the judgements of this Court
referred to above where the State took a similar stand and it was
held that such benefits of A.C.P. would be admissible that was
not interfered with even by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the
Special Leave Petition filed at the instance of the State
respondents.
The appellant State has questioned the findings of
the learned Single Judge contending that the benefits which
were extended by this Court in the case of Pramod Kumar
(supra) and Ashok Kumar (supra) would not be attracted on the
facts of the present case inasmuch as the said decisions were in
relation to the Revenue Service Cadre Rules where the
applicability of the Rules as involved herein was neither debated
nor considered. It may be mentioned that the State of Bihar had
filed Special Leave to Appeal No. 21329 of 2015 in the case of
Pramod Kumar (supra) and the same was dismissed on
07.12.2015
. The order in the case of Pramod Kumar (supra) was complied with as recorded in the order passed
by the learned Single Judge on 22.06.2016 in M.J.C. No. 2783 of 2012 and M.J.C. No. 3243 of 2012.
Patna High Court LPA No.408 of 2018 dt.05-02-2019 There is one more decision (in L.P.A. No. 1871
of 2016 Uday Shankar Prasad vs. The State of Bihar & ors.) on 3 rd of July, 2017 which deserves
notice being closer to the issue raised herein that has been relied upon by the respondent petitioners
where the State of Bihar in a matter arising out of the Road Construction Department relating to
Compilation Clerks, took the plea that since there is no Rule for promotion or recruitment to a
higher post from the post of Compilation Clerk, there were no further avenues and as such the Court
proceeded to allow the appeal on the aforesaid premise.
In the instant case, learned counsel for the appellant State of Bihar has advanced submissions
mainly on the ground that if the respondent petitioners do not possess the qualification of
graduation which is a sine qua non for grant of A.C.P. as per the rules quoted hereinabove, then in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/14038397/ 13
The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Amresh Kumar Sinha And Ors on 5 February, 2019
that event, the judgement of the learned Single Judge proceeds on an erroneous assumption and the
judgements relied on by the learned Single Judge are collectively distinguishable on that count. The
aforesaid argument, therefore, is dependent on the fact as to whether the qualification prescribed
for promotion to the next higher post i.e. to the post of Accounts Officer from Accounts Clerk is also
a necessity for acquiring the benefit of A.C.P. Patna High Court LPA No.408 of 2018 dt.05-02-2019
The argument of the State appellant is to the effect that as per Rule 4(5) of the 2003 Rules quoted
above, the same qualification which is required for being promoted is to be necessarily possessed by
an Accounts Clerk in order to claim A.C.P. For this, the contention is that the Bihar Accounts Service
Rules, 2000 as notified on 28 th of March, 2000 provides for recruitment by way of promotion
under Rule 17 and Rule 20 and Schedule-I thereof.
Rule 17, Rule 20 and Schedule-I are extracted hereinunder:
"17. Recruitment by Promotion. -
(i) All posts other than those in the basic grade of the Service (except the post of
Commissioner and, by specific decision, of the posts of Internal Financial Advisors)
shall be filled by promotion to the members of basic grade of the Service.
(ii) Promotion to the basic grade of the Service shall be made from amongst the
cadres listed in Schedule I.
(iii) Promotion from the ministerial staff of the cadres listed in Schedule-I to the
basic grade shall be made on the basis of the Limited Competitive Examination
conducted by the Commission and related vacancies shall be filled on this basis.
(iv) For promotion to the basis grade of the Service, candidates must possess
qualifications mentioned in Schedule-I.
20. Recruitment by Promotion:- Recruitment by Promotion to the basic grade of this
Service will be made by selection through the limited competitive examination.
1. The State Government shall determine by 31st January of every calendar year the no. of posts to
be filled, separately by direct recruitment and by promotion, from the Patna High Court LPA
No.408 of 2018 dt.05-02-2019 ministerial officers of Treasury, G.P.F. and employees of accounts
cadres.
Provided that the vacancies to be filled up by recruitment through limited competitive examination
shall not exceed 25 (twenty five) per cent of the total number of vacancies in the year.
2. Reservation policy of the Govt, shall be applicable in the recruitment against the vacancies
decided in Sub-Rule (1).
Schedule-I Posts from which appointment to Bihar Accounts Service may be made by promotion :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/14038397/ 14
The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Amresh Kumar Sinha And Ors on 5 February, 2019
Following are the qualifications for promotion to the basic grade of Bihar Accounts
Service on the basis of Limited Competitive Examination :-
(1) Ministerial staff working in Treasuries and Provident Fund cells and employees of
accounts cadre in other departments having at least 10 years of experience in
Government Service. (2) Their minimum educational qualification shall be
graduation.
(3) The applicant must have cleared the final departmental examination in accounts."
The contention of the State is that the promotional avenue in the present case is available through a
limited competitive departmental examination provided the candidate possesses the minimum
qualification of a graduate. Thus, the respondent-petitioners are not being denied any avenue of
promotion as compared to the other cases which have been decided by this Court where there were
no avenues of future promotion.
Shri Rastogi, learned A.A.G., has invited the attention of the Court to paragraph 11 and 12 of the
counter Patna High Court LPA No.408 of 2018 dt.05-02-2019 affidavit filed on behalf of respondent
nos. 2 and 3 in C.W.J.C. No. 14203 of 2016. The same are extracted hereinunder:-
"11. That, it is stated that vide circular no. 769 dated 28.01.2008 the ACP Rules, 2003
were modified so, to also grant ACP upgradation into the basic posts of higher level
cadres if there were a provision of recruitment through limited examination from the
lower cadre.
12. That, it is pertinent to mention here that the Cadre Rule of Bihar Account Officer
was introduced in the year 2000 and known 'Bihar Account Service Rules, 2000' in
which chapter - 5 Rule 17, 20, 22 and Schedule-I deals recruitment by promotion on
basic grade post of Accounts Officer from Ex-cadre employee through the limited
competitive examination, who have minimum education qualification of graduation
apart from the other conditions mentioned therein. In Schedule-I (2) deals
specifically, minimum educational qualification shall be graduate for appearing in the
limited competitive examination of the Ex-cadre employee. However, the word
promotion or through the promotion was deleted vide Bihar Accounts Service
(Amendment) Rule, 2012 issued vide notification dated 23.08.2012. It is evident
from Rule - 8 of said Rule, 2012 that the amendment rule was effective from the date
of commencement of Rule, 2000."
On the strength of the aforesaid averments, Shri Rastogi has urged that in the present case the 2000
Rules are applicable that has an avenue for promotion as an Accounts Officer which provides for the
possession of the qualification of Patna High Court LPA No.408 of 2018 dt.05-02-2019 graduation
for promotion and, therefore, the very same qualification is required for A.C.P. in terms of Rule 4(5)
of the 2003 Rules extracted hereinabove. This aspect according to him has been omitted from
consideration by the learned Single Judge.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/14038397/ 15
The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Amresh Kumar Sinha And Ors on 5 February, 2019
The said argument has been resisted by the respondent-petitioners that this is clearly discriminatory
inasmuch as, firstly the 2000 Rules, namely the Bihar Accounts Service Rules, 2000 are not
applicable to the controversy. Shri Mangalam and Shri Thakur, learned counsel for the respondents
have urged that the Bihar Accounts Rules, 2000 do not relate to the respondent-petitioners for
whom there are no separate rules making a provision for any promotional avenue in their cadres.
The Bihar Accounts Rules, 2000 by inference, therefore, cannot be implanted so as to govern the
promotional avenues of the respondent-petitioners. In fact, the respondent-petitioners had been
appointed as Clerks where the minimum qualification was Intermediate and the cadre of Jr.
Accounts Clerk and Sr. Accounts Clerk which was existing prior to 1980 merged with effect from 1st
May, 1980 into the cadre of Accounts Clerk. The demerger again took place in 1999 and such Clerks
came to be retained in their respective categories without any promotional Patna High Court LPA
No.408 of 2018 dt.05-02-2019 avenues. The career of such Clerks, therefore, came to an end
without any promotion or any benefit which was a discriminatory treatment and in this background
the A.C.P. was clearly admissible to them.
It is also argued that even otherwise, assuming for the sake of arguments that there was a
promotional avenue, yet it was a mirage inasmuch as no posts for promotion were at all created or
were available in the cadre of the respondent- petitioners nor any rules were framed in respect of the
cadre of the respondent-petitioners providing for a promotional avenue. Secondly, it is in order to
avoid this stagnation that the benefits of A.C.P. deserved to be extended to the
respondent-petitioners for whom there was no requirement of possession of the qualification of
graduation. Thus, the two pronged argument on behalf of the respondent-petitioners is that, firstly,
the 2000 Rules were not applicable to the controversy as urged on behalf of the State of Bihar and,
secondly, in the absence of any such promotional posts available, the qualification of graduation
required for promotion to avail A.C.P. is meaningless and not applicable to the case of the
respondent-petitioners.
We are proceeding to analyze the applicability of the judgments in the cases of Pramod Kumar
(supra) and Ashok Patna High Court LPA No.408 of 2018 dt.05-02-2019 Kumar (supra) that have
been relied on by the learned Single Judge to extend the benefit of A.C.P. to the respondent-
petitioners to quash the resolutions of the State Government dated 8.1.2016, 30.6.2016 and the
office Memo. of the Finance Department dated 7.10.2016. It may be mentioned that in the previous
round of litigation in respect of other departments relating to the said issue and after the dismissal
of the S.L.P. on 7.12.2015, the State Government took decisions which were impugned in the writ
petitions giving rise to the present appeals. The learned Single Judge after having discussed the facts
proceeded to frame the bone of contention indicated at page Nos.41 to 43 of the impugned judgment
as follows:-
"It is after dismissal of the Special Leave Petition on 7.12.2015 that the State
Government in its Finance Department has again issued a resolution bearing No.163
dated 8.1.2016 whereby after taking note of the fact that the basic qualification
required to hold the post of Accounts Officer is uncontestingly a Graduate, that in the
process of implementation of the judgment and order of this Court as affirmed by the
Supreme Court, it has declared that only Graduates would be entitled to the benefit of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/14038397/ 16
The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Amresh Kumar Sinha And Ors on 5 February, 2019
financial progression since that is the basic qualification to hold the post of Accounts
Clerk. A copy of the resolution is impugned at Annexure P/9 and which is followed by
the second resolution bearing No.5276 dated 30.6.2016 at Annexure P/10 whereby
the benefit has been restricted to the writ petitioners exclusively in Patna High Court
LPA No.408 of 2018 dt.05-02-2019 C.W.J.C. No.18015/2011 and C.W.J.C.
No.16346/2011.
The Secretary (Expenditure), Finance Department by a third decision bearing Memo
No.8083 dated 7.10.2016, a copy of which has been placed on record vide Annexure
P-11, has in reference to its earlier resolution dated 8.1.2016 placed at Annexure P-9
and 30.6.2016 placed at Annexure P-10 issued clarification to the Accountant
General that the benefit of progression under the Assured Career Progression Rules
would only be extended to the direct appointees and not to those who had ben
appointed on the post of Accounts Clerk by way of compassionate appointment,
absorption or upgradation, which would be guided by the Finance Department
Circular No.867 dated 1.1.2015.
Since the order of the Writ Court and the Division Bench, present at Annexures P-7
and P-8, was not being complied that the writ petitioners in the said cases, moved in
contempt and while the matter was pending that the order was complied and the
contempt application was accordingly disposed of as manifest from Annexure P-10/1
vide order passed on 4.7.2016.
When this batch of writ petition was filed the only issue which required a deliberation
was whether the respondent State Government in its Finance Department while
issuing the resolution bearing No.163 dated 8.1.2016 at Annexure P-9, Memo
No.5276 dated 30.6.2016 at Annexure P/10 and Memo No.8083 dated 7.10.2016 at
Annexure P/11 in purported compliance of the judgment and order passed in
C.W.J.C. No.18015/2016 and C.W.J.C. No.16346/2011 could deny the relief to these
petitioners simply because they were not party to the proceedings.
Patna High Court LPA No.408 of 2018 dt.05-02-2019 The resolutions put to
challenge at Annexure P/9 to P/11 proceeds to exclude the non- petitioners on
grounds that:
(a) only graduates are entitled to the benefit of Assured Career Progression because
that is the minimum qualification for holding the post of Accounts Officer which is
the next promotional post from the post of Senior Accounts Clerk held by the
petitioners;
(b) it is only the petitioners who are covered by the judgment and order passed in
C.W.J.C. No.18015/2016 and C.W.J.C. No.16346/2011, as taken note of in the order,
who would be entitled to the benefit of Assured Career Progression even if they are
non-graduates and compassionate appointees but this benefit would neither set a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/14038397/ 17
The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Amresh Kumar Sinha And Ors on 5 February, 2019
precedence for others nor would be extended to similarly situated employees; and
(c) the resolution dated 8.1.2016 and 7.10.2016 at Annexure P/9 and P/11 operate
independently and are only applicable to direct employees but those appointed on
compassionate ground, absorption or by up-
gradation of post in the Accounts Clerical Cadre, would not be entitled to the benefit." The learned
Single Judge found that the issue of grant of pay-scales and other issues which had been raised
stood resolved by the resolution dated 25th of March, 2015, but while considering extension of
benefit of A.C.P., the rigid stand taken by the Government through fresh resolutions thereafter,
Patna High Court LPA No.408 of 2018 dt.05-02-2019 particularly by the Finance Department, was
wholly unjustified and the State continued to commit an illegality in order to overreach the earlier
judicial verdicts which, according to the learned Single Judge, also amounted to a contempt of the
earlier judgments. The learned Single Judge also observed that the State remains blind-folded on
the legal position and its action was discriminatory being clearly in teeth of the earlier judgments,
particularly the judgment in the case of Pramod Kumar (supra) that stood affirmed by the Apex
Court and that in the case of Ashok Kumar (supra).
Thus, in order to analyze the arguments, we may first refer to the aforesaid judgments that formed
the basis of the impugned judgment. In the case of Pramod Kumar (supra), a learned Single Judge
of this Court, in turn, relied on the observations made in an earlier judgment by the same learned
Single Judge in the case of Shashi Shekhar Ambasta Vs. The State of Bihar, reported in 2011 (3)
P.L.J.R. 474. The judgment in the said case was in relation to an Accounts Clerk in the Road
Construction Department claiming A.C.P. The learned Single Judge observed that there was
difference between a substantive promotion and grant of A.C.P. and relying on the said observations
made in paragraph 8 of the said reported judgment, Patna High Court LPA No.408 of 2018
dt.05-02-2019 came to the conclusion that the A.C.P. Scheme did not contain any rider for clearing
any examination, much less any other process for promotion to the next higher post in the next
cadre. It was held in the said decision that A.C.P. was an anti- stagnation measure that was devised
to extend benefits due to non-availability of posts or due to failure of a candidate to qualify in the
examinations. On this premise, the Court came to the conclusion that merely because a candidate is
unable to clear the examination which is meant for promotion, the same would not apply for the
purpose of availing an A.C.P. On the other hand, it nowhere held that an A.C.P. would be available
even if the minimum eligibility qualification required for a promotional post is not possessed by a
candidate. The issue of minimum eligibility qualification as involved presently was nowhere a bone
of contention or decision by the Court in that case.
It is the said decision which was followed by the same learned Single Judge in the case of Pramod
Kumar (supra), decided on 16.2.2012 where again it was a matter relating to Junior Revenue Service
Cadre Rules, 2004 where it was held that the passing of limited competitive examination both for
the purpose of promotion and A.C.P. was counter- productive to the scheme of A.C.P. However, at
the same time, Patna High Court LPA No.408 of 2018 dt.05-02-2019 the eligibility requirement for
10 years as Accounts Clerk was required to be possessed and the learned Single Judge clarified that
an Accounts Clerk cannot lay out a claim for A.C.P. in the basic scale of Accounts Officer till he fulfils
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/14038397/ 18
The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Amresh Kumar Sinha And Ors on 5 February, 2019
the qualification of 10 years of service as an Accounts Clerk. The channel for promotion to the post
of Accounts Officer opens only thereafter. Thus, the basic eligibility criteria of 10 years of service was
acknowledged in the said decision.
The argument on behalf of the State in the present case rests on the premise that the decision taken
by the State Government on 8.1.2016, followed on 30.6.2016 as well as the Finance Department
Office Memo. dated 7.10.2016, is in respect of the possession of basic minimum qualification of
Graduation. This matter was never thrashed out either in the case of Pramod Kumar (supra) or
Ashok Kumar (supra).
On an analysis of the judgments, we find force in the submission of the learned Counsel for the State
of Bihar that the decisions relied on by the learned Counsel for the respondent-petitioners have not
done away with the provision of the possession of basic eligibility requirements for availing of A.C.P.
It is for this reason that the respondent-petitioners Patna High Court LPA No.408 of 2018
dt.05-02-2019 have taken a stand that there are no Cadre Promotion Rules or posts in the cadre of
Accounts Clerk in the controlling departments involved herein and in the absence of any such posts
or promotional avenue defined in their Service Rules, the qualifications prescribed as per Bihar
Accounts Service Rules, 2000 (hereinafter referred to as '2000 Rules') would not be applicable as
the said Rules do not apply in relation to the present dispute at all.
We are unable to accept this submission on behalf of the respondent-petitioners for the reason that
the applicability of this Rule, namely Bihar Accounts Service Rules, 2000, have nowhere been
discussed either in the judgment in the case of Pramod Kumar (supra) or Ashok Kumar (supra). The
2000 Rules along with Schedule-1 extracted hereinabove clearly provides for a promotional avenue
to the ministerial staff of all other departments which has nowhere been noticed in either of the
judgments cited on behalf of the respondent-petitioners. Promotion to the basic grade of Accounts
Officer under the Bihar Accounts Service Rules, 2000 is open for the ministerial staff working in
Treasuries, P.F. Cells and employees of Accounts Cadre in other departments having at least 10
years of experience in government service. Thus, a promotional avenue Patna High Court LPA
No.408 of 2018 dt.05-02-2019 under Rule, 17 read with Rule 20 and Schedule-I of the 2000 Rules is
clearly available to the respondent-petitioners. The judgments which have been relied upon by the
learned Counsel for the respondent-petitioners at best come to their aid to the extent that they may
not have to undergo a limited competitive examination or having failed in the limited competitive
examination may be entitled for grant of A.C.P. Failure to clear the limited competitive examination,
therefore, may not be an impediment for grant of A.C.P. as held in the decisions relied on by the
respondent-petitioners as also in the impugned judgment, but the possession of the basic eligibility
criteria of Graduation has nowhere been waived in any of the said judgments. We find that the
promotional avenue, even though not provided for separately with regard to the cadre of the
respondent-petitioners, the same is clearly available under the 2000 Rules which is a Rule framed
under Article 309 of the Constitution of India. As observed above, a careful reading of the said Rule
would indicate that the promotional avenue to the basic grade post of the Accounts Officer is
available to the ministerial staff of all departments.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/14038397/ 19
The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Amresh Kumar Sinha And Ors on 5 February, 2019
It is here that the judgment in the case of Uday Shankar Prasad (supra), decided on 3rd July, 2017
deserves Patna High Court LPA No.408 of 2018 dt.05-02-2019 notice. The said Division Bench
judgment was in relation to Compilation Clerks in the Road Construction Department and not in
relation to Accounts Clerks. In that case, the State had conceded that there was no promotional
avenue for Compilation Clerks. This, therefore, clearly distinguishes the said case on facts wherein a
concession was made by the State with regard to non-availability of promotional posts and the same
would not apply on the facts of the present case. The said Division Bench judgment also nowhere
addresses itself to the issue of promotional avenues available in relation to the Accounts Cadre
under the 2000 Rules as explained above. Consequently, the ratio of the said decision or the
observations made therein would not be attracted on the facts of the present case. Reliance,
therefore, placed on the said judgment by the respondent- petitioners is wholly inapplicable for the
reasons stated hereinabove.
In view of what has been stated above, the discussion in relation to Bihar Miscellaneous Rules, 1958
is irrelevant.
Thus, in view of what has been discussed hereinabove, the aforesaid judgments nowhere relate to
the controversy relating to the possession of the minimum eligibility Patna High Court LPA No.408
of 2018 dt.05-02-2019 qualification of Graduation, which has been made the basis for denying the
A.C.P. to the respondent petitioners under the orders that were impugned before the learned Single
Judge. The learned Single Judge does not appear to have examined the aforesaid aspects and
assumed the applicability of the judgments on the ground that the denial appears to be
discriminatory. On the other hand, the State has made a valid classification of allowing the A.C.P. to
all those who possess the minimum eligibility qualification. It is not in dispute by the State that they
have extended the benefit of A.C.P. to those who possessed the minimum eligibility qualification of
graduation. The aforesaid distinction on the basis of basic qualification of Graduation in order to
avail A.C.P., therefore, was neither an issue raised nor decided in any of the decisions referred to
hereinabove. The reliance, therefore, placed by the learned Single Judge to draw an analogy that the
State Government had deliberately committed contempt does not appear to be correct. With due
respect, we are unable to agree with the conclusions drawn by the learned Single Judge for all the
reasons recorded hereinabove.
The respondent-petitioners could have claimed the benefit at par with others had they possessed the
minimum Patna High Court LPA No.408 of 2018 dt.05-02-2019 qualification of a Graduate. It is not
the case of the respondent- petitioners that the State has discriminated by allowing such A.C.P. to
non-Graduates as well who stand at par in the Accounts Services in any other department of the
Government. We are, therefore, unable to sustain this part of the conclusion drawn by the learned
Single Judge.
The appeals, therefore, to the aforesaid extent, are allowed and the impugned judgment is set aside.
The other observations and findings of the learned Single Judge with regard to the previous round
of litigation also stand disposed of accordingly.
