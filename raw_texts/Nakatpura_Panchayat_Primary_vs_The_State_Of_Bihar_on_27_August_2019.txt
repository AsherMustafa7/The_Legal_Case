CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE RAJEEV RANJAN PRASAD
ORAL JUDGMENT
Date : 27-08-2019
This batch of writ applications have been heard
together with consent of learned Senior Counsel for the
petitioners as also learned Advocate General and learned Senior
Patna High Court CWJC No.14396 of 2019 dt.27-08-2019

Counsel representing the respondents. All these matters are
being disposed off by this common judgement.
Petitioners in all these writ applications are primarily
aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the second part of the order
as contained in Memo No. 6349 dated 05.07.2019 issued under
the signature of the Deputy Registrar (Cane), Co-operative
Societies, Bihar Patna. Memo No. 6349 dated 05.07.2019
(Annexure '2' to C.W.J.C. No. 14396 of 2019) which has been
taken as a lead case. On the last date when these matters were
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37396651/ 20
Nakatpura Panchayat Primary ... vs The State Of Bihar on 27 August, 2019
taken for consideration, after noticing the submissions of
learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners as also learned
counsel representing the respondents this Court took note of
their respective submissions and taking a prima-facie view
passed an interim order directing the respondents to maintain
status quo as on the date (30.07.2019) on which the order was
passed. In order to appreciate the controversies it would be
appropriate to reproduce the order dated 30.07.2019 as under:-
"These cases have been tagged on
the request of learned senior counsel
representing the parties as they seek
to challenge a common order as
contained in Memo No. 6349 dated
05.07.2019
(Annexure '2') issued by the Deputy Registrar (Cane) Co-
operative Societies, Bihar, Patna. It is the common contention of learned senior counsel
representing the parties that the second part of the Patna High Court CWJC No.14396 of 2019
dt.27-08-2019 order by which in exercise of his self-claimed power under Section 44AQ(6) of the
Bihar Co-operative Societies Act, 1935 (hereinafter referred to as the "Act of 1935"), the Deputy
Registrar has notified under order of the Registrar, Co-operative Societies that all those applicants
who could not get declared the membership in terms of Rule 7(1) of the Bihar Co-operative Societies
Rules, 1959 (hereinafter referred to as the "Rules of 1959") are declared members of the PACS is
wholly illegal and without jurisdiction. It is submitted that the mode and manner in which a
member is to be inducted in the PACS is laid down under Rule 7 of the Rules of 1959.
The Rule of 1959 specifically provides that an application for membership has to be applied in Form
'V' and then such applications are to be considered by the Managing Committee of the Society and
the decision of the Committee thereon is required to be communicated to the applicant within 15
days from of receipt of the application and where the application is rejected the reasons therefor are
to be communicated. In terms of Rule 7
(e), if no decision is communicated to the applicant within the period specified in Clause (d) of
Sub-Rule (1) of Rule 7 within 15 days, it shall be deemed that the application has been accepted and
the applicant has been admitted to the membership of the Society. A person aggrieved by the
rejection of his application has a right to prefer an appeal to the Registrar in terms of Sub-Rule (2)
of Rule 7.

Nakatpura Panchayat Primary ... vs The State Of Bihar on 27 August, 2019
So far as Section 44AQ of the Act of 1935 is concerned, it is submitted that it relates to power of the
Patna High Court CWJC No.14396 of 2019 dt.27-08-2019 Registrar to order liquidation of the
societies and amalgamation of serving societies. Sub-section (6) of Section 44AQ provides that every
family residing within the local limits of new society determined under sub-section (2) shall be
represented by at least one adult member of the family who shall be a normal or associate member
of the society and shall be entitled to a right of voting if he pays a membership fee and may become a
full fledged member of the society if he purchases at least one share of the society and further he
shall be entitled to receive loan therefrom and shall also be eligible to hold any elected post of the
society.
Learned senior counsel submits that by no stretch of imagination sub- section (6) of Section 44AQ
of the Act of 1935 confers any power upon the Registrar, Co-operative Societies to suo motu declare
an applicant member of a society. It is submitted that in absence of there being a statutory power
vested in the Registrar to that effect, the declaration made in the impugned order that all such
applicants who have not received declared membership shall become a member of the society is
wholly without jurisdiction.
Referring to the propositions of law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that a criteria to a
statute must act within the four corners of a statute. In this case since the Registrar, Co-operative
Societies has not been conferred with any power to declare an applicant member of the society
automatically, it is submitted that the second part of the impugned order is liable to be held bad in
law and be accordingly quashed.
Patna High Court CWJC No.14396 of 2019 dt.27-08-2019 Although in this case no counter affidavit
has been filed but in CWJC No. 14399/2019 a counter affidavit has been filed on behalf of
respondent no. 1, 2 & 3 sworn by the Assistant Registrar, Co-operative Societies. All that has been
said with regard to the powers of the Registrar to issue such orders as have been issued in the
present case, this court finds that in paragraph '19' of the counter affidavit following statements have
been made:
"19. That so far as the question of authority and jurisdiction of the present
respondent in issuance of the impugned order is concerned, it is submitted that the
Block Development Officer, District Cooperative Officer and Assistant Registrar,
Cooperative Societies are empowered under Rule 7 (1) (a) (b)
(c) and Rule 7(4) of the Bihar Cooperative Societies Rules, 1959 to pass order
pertaining to membership to such PACS which are binding on it. But when it was
observed that required outcome in membership is not coming on account of apathy,
the present respondent passed the order impugned."
Yesterday when these matters were mentioned being on the list, this Court wanted to know as to
whether any election has been notified, the Court was informed that no election has been notified as
the voter list itself is under preparation. The petitioners had raised a grievance that any voter list
prepared on the basis of the direction of the Registrar as contained in Annexure '2' (second part)
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37396651/ 22
Nakatpura Panchayat Primary ... vs The State Of Bihar on 27 August, 2019
would not be in accordance with law.
Today, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners have informed this Court that perhaps prompted
by the Patna High Court CWJC No.14396 of 2019 dt.27-08-2019 query made by this Court
yesterday, in the mid night a notification bearing no. 118 dated 29th May, 2019 has been uploaded
by the Bihar State Election Authority notifying the election of the societies. The schedule, however,
provided, therein shows that the last date for publication of voter list is 03.08.2019.
Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners have informed that earlier a direction was there to
prepare the voter list as on the voter list taking the cut off date of membership as on 30th June, 2019
but now taking note of the impugned order (Annexure '2') the last date for publication of voter list
has been fixed on 03.08.2019 with a sole intention to take into account all those applicants who
stand inducted as a member by virtue of the direction of the last part of the impugned order as
contained in Annexure '2' to the writ application.
Mr. Mukesh Kumar, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Bihar State Election Authority
submits that earlier a cut off date was extended from 30.06.2019 to 15.07.2019 on the request of the
Registrar, Co- operative Societies vide memo dated 10.07.2019.
Having heard learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners and learned counsel representing the State
as well as the State Election Authority, this Court is prima-facie of the considered opinion that the
second part of the order as contained in Memo No. 33649 dated 05.07.2019 (Annexure '2') cannot
be said to be in accordance with law. Section 44AQ (6) under which the Registrar, Co-operative
Societies has exercised his power reads as under:
Patna High Court CWJC No.14396 of 2019 dt.27-08-2019
44.AQ (6) Every family residing within the local limits of the new society determined
under 2[sub-
section (2) shall be represented by at least one adult member of the family who shall be a normal or
associate member of the society and shall be entitled to a right of voting if he pays a 3[membership
fee] and may become a full-fledged member of the society if he purchases at least one share of the
society and he shall be entitled to receive loan therefrom and shall also be eligible to hold any
elective post of the society."
The provisions relating to admission of a member in the society, consideration of the application for
membership, rejection thereof and the circumstances under which a Block Development Officer or
Assistant Registrar, Co-operative Societies or District Co-operative Societies may exercise their
power to induct a member of society are all provided under Rule 7 and its various sub-Rules which
are quoted hereunder for a ready reference:
"7. Admission to Membership. - 1[ (1) (a) Every person desiring admission to
membership of a registered society shall apply in form V.

(b) The Secretary of the Society or any person duly authorised by him in this behalf
shall immediately grant a receipt for the application in the form at the foot of form V.
(c) In case the Secretary of the Society or any such person as aforesaid does not
receive the application or grant a receipt for it, the applicant may submit his
application to the Block

Cooperative Societies or the District Cooperative Officer, who shall immediately grant
him a receipt for the application in the prescribed form, and shall at once send the
same to the society concerned.
(d) The application shall be considered by a Managing Committee of the Society and
the decision of the Committee thereon shall be communicated to the applicant within
15 days of receipt of the application and, where the application is rejected, with
reasons therefor.
(e) If no decision is communicated to the applicant within the period specified above.
It shall be deemed that the application has been accepted and the applicant has been
admitted to the membership of the Society.] (2) A person whose application for
admission to membership has been rejected by the managing committee may, within
sixty days of the communication of the decision to him appeal to the Registrar whose
decision shall be final.
(3) On payment of the admission fee and share money as prescribed in the bye-laws,
a member shall be entitled to all the rights and shall be subject to all the liabilities of
a member.
[(4) "Notwithstanding anything contrary contained in this rule or by-lays of a Primary Agriculture
Credit Society, if any person applied for membership of such a society with a declaration to the
Block Development Officer or Assistant Registrar, Cooperative societies or District Cooperative
Officer that-
(a) he fulfills the criteria for attaining membership of such a society,

(c) he has applied for membership to the managing committee of such society and has not been
admitted as a member, the concerned Block Development Officer of Assistant Registrar
Co-operative Societies or District Co-operative Officer, as the case may be, shall order such person
to be made a member of the said society." A bare perusal of the aforesaid provisions would show
that the Rule duly provides the mode and manner in which a member is to be inducted.
Rule nowhere confers powers on the Registrar to make a declaration in the nature it has been done
ini the second part of the impugned order dated 05.07.2019.
Mr. P.K. Sahi, learned Senior Counsel representing one of the petitioners in the batch of cases has
relied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Commissioner of Police,
Bombay v. Gordhandas Bhanji reported in A.I.R. (39) 1952 Supreme Court 16 to contend that a
public authority must act in accordance with the powers vested in them and they cannot play fast
and loose with the powers. This Court finds substance in the submission of learned Senior Counsel
given on the proposition of law that a public authority such as Registrar, Co-operative Societies
cannot assume upon himself a power which is not vested in him by the statute.
These are the observations of the Court prima-facie on the basis of the Patna High Court CWJC
No.14396 of 2019 dt.27-08-2019 materials which have been placed today in course of hearing.
Although on the basis of the stand taken by the respondents in the counter affidavit as indicated
above, these writ applications should have been disposed off, however, Mr. Sanjay Kumar, learned
AC to GA 13 who appears in C.W.J.C. No. 14402 of 2019 submits that some further time may be
granted to the State respondents to file counter affidavit in the other cases as well. Taking note of
this, the cases are being fixed under the same heading on 8th of August, 2019.
In the meantime, the operation of the impugned order insofar as it directs that all such applicants
eligible for membership who have not obtained the membership on their own are declared members
of the society is hereby stayed.
This Court is of the considered opinion that even though, normally the Court does not interfere with
the election, in a given case like the present one where the issue of finalization of voter list is still
open and the voter list is yet to be finalized, the hurried notification sensing the observation of this
Court would come in the way of the Court exercising its power under Article 226 of the Constitution
of India to direct the respondents to maintain the status quo as on today.
List accordingly."
During pendency of the writ applications a counter affidavit has been filed on behalf of the
respondent no. 7 in Patna High Court CWJC No.14396 of 2019 dt.27-08-2019 C.W.J.C. No. 14396 of
2019. The main contesting respondents i.e. Respondent Nos. 1, 2 and 3 have filed a counter affidavit
and supplementary counter affidavit in C.W.J.C. No. 14399 of 2019 (Piraunta Primary Agriculture
Credit Cooperative Society Ltd. (PACS) Vs. The State of Bihar), therefore, the stand of Respondent
Nos. 1, 2 and 3 are reflected in their counter affidavit available in C.W.J.C. No. 14399 of 2019.

Nakatpura Panchayat Primary ... vs The State Of Bihar on 27 August, 2019
In some of the writ applications, Intervention Applications have also been filed. The proposed
Intervenors are the persons who are interested in contesting the writ applications. This Court had
occasion to record a prima-facie view on the request of the proposed Intervenors, yesterday and
what have been found by this Court are recorded in the order dated 26.08.2019. Today once again
learned Senior Counsel Chitranjan Sinha and Mr. P.N. Sahi together with the learned Advocates on
record representing the proposed Intervenors have made submissions in their respective cases
seeking to allow the proposed Intervention. In course of submissions, however, learned Senior
Counsel for the proposed Intervenors could not demonstrate as to how their interest is involved in
the present batch of cases. Further as the argument progressed and the stand of learned Advocate
General were put-forth before this Court, it Patna High Court CWJC No.14396 of 2019
dt.27-08-2019 became all the more clear that the proposed Intervention Application is not required
to be allowed. Finding that what have been noticed by this Court in its order dated 26.08.2019 have
not been contested and no other independent reason has been shown to allow the Intervention
Applications, those are hereby rejected.
Now coming to the contentions of learned Senior Counsel representing the petitioners as also
learned counsel who have argued in other writ applications, this Court finds that apart from
reiterating their submissions as recorded in the order dated 30.07.2019 they have further extended
their arguments on the strength of some judicial pronouncements making a submission that in the
present case the impugned order has been passed at the instance of Registrar though issued under
the signature of the Deputy Registrar (Cane) without there being any authority vested in the
Registrar to pass such order.
Their contention is that the Registrar, Co-operative Societies being creature of the Statute must act
within the four-
corners of the Statute. It is submitted that so far as the issue of membership of the PACS is
concerned, Rule 7 extensively provides the procedures required to be followed for admitting a
person to the membership of the PACS and if the Statute and the Patna High Court CWJC No.14396
of 2019 dt.27-08-2019 Rule framed thereunder provide a thing to be done in a particular manner,
there is no reason as to why the Registrar, Co-operative Societies would take upon himself/herself a
power not vested in him/her. It is submitted that in this case what has been done is that the
Registrar, Co-operative Societies has usurped a power not vested in him/her by the Statute and in
the process has taken away the powers conferred upon the Managing Committee of the PACS to
consider an application for admission of a member to the PACS. It is submitted that the impugned
action if allowed to exist would result in rendering the entire Rule 7 of the Rules of 1959 redundant
in the eye of law. Learned Senior Counsel has relied upon a judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in the
case of Dipak Babaria & Anr. Vs. State of Gujarat & Ors. reported in (2014)3 SCC 502 with special
emphasis on Paragraph 61 and 64 of the judgment.
Paragraph 61 and 64 are, thus, quoted hereunder for a ready reference :-
"61. It is well settled that where the statute provides for a thing to be done in a
particular manner, then it has to be done in that manner and in no other manner.

This proposition of law laid down in Taylor Vs. Taylor (1875) 1 Ch D 426,431 was first
adopted by the Judicial Committee in Nazir Ahmed Vs. King Emperor reported in
AIR 1936 PC 253 and then followed by a bench of three Judges of this Court in Rao
Shiv Bahadur Singh Vs. State of Vindhya Pradesh reported Patna High Court CWJC
No.14396 of 2019 dt.27-08-2019 in AIR 1954 SC 322. This proposition was further
explained in paragraph 8 of State of U.P. Vs. Singhara Singh by a bench of three
Judges reported in AIR 1964 SC 358 in the following words:-
"8. The rule adopted in Taylor v. Taylor is well recognised and is founded on sound
principle. Its result is that if a statute has conferred a power to do an act and has laid
down the method in which that power has to be exercised, it necessarily prohibits the
doing of the act in any other manner than that which has been prescribed. The
principle behind the rule is that if this were not so, the statutory provision might as
well not have been enacted...." This proposition has been later on reiterated in
Chandra Kishore Jha Vs. Mahavir Prasad reported in 1999 (8) SCC 266, Dhananjaya
Reddy Vs. State of Karnataka reported in 2001 (4) SCC 9 and Gujarat Urja Vikas
Nigam Limited vs. Essar Power Limited reported in 2008 (4) SCC 755.
* * * *
64.That apart it has to be examined whether the Government had given sufficient
reasons for the order it passed, at the time of passing such order. The Government
must defend its action on the basis of the order that it has passed, and it cannot
improve its stand by filing subsequent affidavits as laid down by this Court long back
in Commissioner of Police, Bombay vs. Gordhandas Bhanji reported in AIR 1952 SC
16 in the following words:-
"Public orders, publicly made, in exercise of a statutory authority cannot be
construed in the light of explanations subsequently given by the officer making the
order of what he meant, or of what was in his mind, or what he intended to do.
Public orders made by public authorities are meant to have public effect and are
intended to affect the actings and conduct of those to whom they are Patna High
Court CWJC No.14396 of 2019 dt.27-08-2019 addressed and must be construed
objectively with reference to the language used in the order itself." This proposition
has been quoted with approval in paragraph 8 by a Constitution Bench in Mohinder
Singh Gill vs. Chief Election Commissioner reported in 1978 (1) SCC 405 wherein
Krishna Iyer, J. has stated as follows:- "8. The second equally relevant matter is that
when a statutory functionary makes an order based on certain grounds, its validity
must be judged by the reasons so mentioned and cannot be supplemented by fresh
reasons in the shape of affidavit or otherwise. Otherwise, an order bad in the
beginning may, by the time it comes to court on account of a challenge, get validated
by additional grounds later brought out."

Further learned senior counsel has relied upon another judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
the case of Thalappal Service Cooperative Bank Limited & Ors. Vs. State of Kerala & Ors. reported in
(2013) 16 SCC 82. Paragraph 20, 21, 22 and 23 on which reliance has been placed are as under:-
"20. Societies are, of course, subject to the control of the statutory authorities like
Registrar, Joint Registrar, the Government, etc. but cannot be said that the State
exercises any direct or indirect control over the affairs of the society which is deep
and all pervasive. Supervisory or general regulation under the statute over the
co-operative societies, which are body corporate does not render activities of the body
so regulated as subject to such control of the State so as to bring it within the
meaning of the "State" or instrumentality of the State. Above principle has been
approved by this Court in S.S. Rana Patna High Court CWJC No.14396 of 2019
dt.27-08-2019 v. Registrar, Coop. Societies (2006) 11 SCC
634. In that case this Court was dealing with the maintainability of the writ petition
against the Kangra Central Co- operative Society Bank Limited, a society registered
under the provisions of the Himachal Pradesh Co-operative Societies Act, 1968. After
examining various provisions of the H.P. Co- operative Societies Act this Court held
as follows:
"9. It is not in dispute that the Society has not been constituted under an Act. Its
functions like any other cooperative society are mainly regulated in terms of the
provisions of the Act, except as provided in the bye-laws of the Society. The State has
no say in the functions of the Society. Membership, acquisition of shares and all other
matters are governed by the bye-laws framed under the Act. The terms and
conditions of an officer of the cooperative society, indisputably, are governed by the
Rules. Rule 56, to which reference has been made by Mr Vijay Kumar, does not
contain any provision in terms whereof any legal right as such is conferred upon an
officer of the Society.
10. It has not been shown before us that the State exercises any direct or indirect
control over the affairs of the Society for deep and pervasive control. The State
furthermore is not the majority shareholder. The State has the power only to
nominate one Director. It cannot, thus, be said that the State exercises any functional
control over the affairs of the Society in the sense that the majority Directors are
nominated by the State. For arriving at the conclusion that the State has a deep and
pervasive control over the Society, several other relevant questions are required to be
considered, namely, (1) How was the Society created? (2) Whether it enjoys any
monopoly character? (3) Do the functions of the Society partake to statutory
functions or public functions? and (4) Can it be characterised as public authority?
11. Respondent 2, the Society does not answer any of the aforementioned tests. In
Patna High Court CWJC No.14396 of 2019 dt.27-08-2019 the case of a non-statutory
society, the control thereover would mean that the same satisfies the tests laid down
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37396651/ 28
Nakatpura Panchayat Primary ... vs The State Of Bihar on 27 August, 2019
by this Court in Ajay Hasia v. Khalid Mujib Sehravardi. [See Zoroastrian Coop.
Housing Society Ltd. v. Distt. Registrar, Coop. Societies (Urban).]
12. It is well settled that general regulations under an Act, like the Companies Act or
the Cooperative Societies Act, would not render the activities of a company or a
society as subject to control of the State. Such control in terms of the provisions of the
Act are meant to ensure proper functioning of the society and the State or statutory
authorities would have nothing to do with its day-to-day functions."
21. We have, on facts, found that the Co-operative Societies, with which we are concerned in these
appeals, will not fall within the expression "State" or "instrumentalities of the State" within the
meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution and hence not subject to all constitutional limitations as
enshrined in Part III of the Constitution. We may, however, come across situations where a body or
organization though not a State or instrumentality of the State, may still satisfy the definition of
public authority within the meaning of Section 2(h) of the Act, an aspect which we may discuss in
the later part of this Judgment.
Constitutional provisions and Co- operative autonomy:
22. The rights of the citizens to form co-operative societies voluntarily, is now raised to the level of a
fundamental right and State shall endeavour to promote their autonomous functioning. The
Parliament, with a view to enhance public faith in the co-operative institutions and to insulate them
to avoidable political or bureaucratic Patna High Court CWJC No.14396 of 2019 dt.27-08-2019
interference brought in Constitutional (97th Amendment) Act, 2011, which received the assent of
the President on 12.01.2012, notified in the Gazette of India on 13.01.2012 and came into force on
15.02.2012. The Constitutional amendment has been effected to encourage economic activities of
co-operatives which in turn help progress of rural India. Societies are expected not only to ensure
autonomous and democratic functioning of co-operatives, but also accountability of the
management to the members and other share stake- holders.
23. Article 19 protects certain rights regarding freedom of speech. By virtue of above amendment
under Article 19(1)(c) the words "co-
operative societies" are added. Article 19(1)(c) reads as under:
"19(1)(c) - All citizens shall have the right to form associations or unions or
co-operative societies".
"19. Protection of certain rights regarding freedom of speech, etc.-
(1) All citizens shall have the right-

Nakatpura Panchayat Primary ... vs The State Of Bihar on 27 August, 2019
(c) to form associations or unions or cooperative societies."
Article 19(1)(c), therefore, guarantees the freedom to form an association, unions and
co- operative societies. Right to form a co-operative society is, therefore, raised to the
level of a fundamental right, guaranteed under the Constitution of India."
Learned senior counsel has then submitted with reference to Article 243ZI of the Constitution of
India that the Patna High Court CWJC No.14396 of 2019 dt.27-08-2019 said Article was introduced
by the 97th Constitutional Amendment in order to provide for making a law with respect to the
incorporation, regulation and winding up of the cooperative societies based on the principles of
voluntary formation, democratic member control, member-economic participation and autonomous
functioning. This was simultaneously brought in the Constitution of India with Article 43-B which
provides for promotion of the cooperative societies. It is submitted that what is being done is that
very democratic system provided under Rule 7 of the Rules of 1959 whereunder a society has been
conferred with the power to consider an application for membership is being taken away. In order to
support his argument, learned senior counsel has relied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of S.S. Rana Vs. Registrar, Coop. Societies & Anr. reported in (2006) 11 SCC 634
and Harender Narain Banker Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors.
reported in 1985 PLJR 1078 HC (paragraph 13 and 14).
Mr. Sandip Kumar, learned counsel who has argued the matter in CWJC No.14399 of 2019 has
taken this Court through some of the pleadings particularly the statements made in his rejoinder
wherein attention of this Court has been drawn towards various paragraphs particular paragraph VI
which reads Patna High Court CWJC No.14396 of 2019 dt.27-08-2019 as under:-
"Huge instances are available in the case of on- line application that one or few
persons became nominee for all applicants in PACS although the person shown as
nominee is not legal heir of applicant. The person recommending the form is himself
not the member of the said PACS. Applications are in the name of dead persons,
outsider and existing members. There is a case that even the forms have not been
forwarded to the society or forwarded but dead line of 15 days not lapsed. But, now in
terms of the impugned order all became member and their membership fee have
been deposited by the State Cooperative Bank at the direction of the Government. For
example, in the case of the deponent, the society itself enrolled 400 new members
who applied before the society. Under the on-line scheme, 172 forms were forwarded,
out of which 8 were admitted and remaining 164 were rejected on different grounds
and decision to this effect was communicated. The Block Co-operative Extension
Officer or the Assistant Registrar Co- operative Societies, as per knowledge of the
deponent not differed with the finding of the society. But now in terms of the
impugned order, all 164 persons whose case was rejected became members. Even, an
additional 35 names have been added whose application forms have never been
served to the society."

Nakatpura Panchayat Primary ... vs The State Of Bihar on 27 August, 2019
Learned counsel has thus submitted that he has provided some example to support his submissions
that if the impugned order is allowed to exist it will render the provisions of the Rules of 1959
redundant in the eye of law. He has placed before this Court the procedures prescribed by the
Registrar, Patna High Court CWJC No.14396 of 2019 dt.27-08-2019 Cooperative Societies in memo
no.8017 dated 21.09.2016 for purpose of admission of a person to the membership of the PACS. The

that now the department is not following even its own guidelines and the procedures.
On all these grounds, learned senior counsel for the petitioners and learned counsel
representing the petitioners in other writ applications have prayed for setting aside
the second part of the memo no.6349 dated 05.07.2019.
Mr. Lalit Kishore, learned Advocate General assisted by Mr. Mukesh Kumar learned
counsel on record appears on behalf of the State respondents as well as the Bihar
State Election Authority. Learned Advocate General has made a submission before
this Court that the impugned order has been passed by the Registrar, Cooperative
Societies in larger public interest. Referring to sub-rule (4) of Rule 7 of the Rules of
1959, learned Advocate General offered a submission that Sub-Rule (4) of Rule 7
makes the intention of the Legislatures clear Patna High Court CWJC No.14396 of
2019 dt.27-08-2019 inasmuch as apart from the mode provided under Sub-Rule (1)
of Rule 7, the Legislatures in their wisdom thought it just and proper to confer
powers upon the Block Development Officer/Assistant Registrar, Cooperative
Societies or District Cooperative Officer to consider an application for membership in
the given circumstance an order that the applicant shall be made a member of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37396651/ 32
Nakatpura Panchayat Primary ... vs The State Of Bihar on 27 August, 2019
society.
In course of argument, this Court called upon the learned Advocate General to make a submission as
to whether the impugned order may be saved only by saying that it has been passed in larger public
interest, if it is evident from the materials available on the record that the said order has been
passed without following the procedures prescribed under Rule 7 of the Rules of 1959 and by an
authority not vested with power to issue such order. Further the query was as to what is in the larger
public interest, to abide by the Rule of law is a larger public interest or to do something de hors to
the Rules of 1959 saying that the object sought to be achieved is pious so it is a larger public interest,
therefore, it should be saved. In all fairness, learned Advocate General immediately submitted that
to abide by the 'Rule of law' is in the larger public interest.
At this stage, when this Court called upon the learned Patna High Court CWJC No.14396 of 2019
dt.27-08-2019 Advocate General to demonstrate from the provisions of the Bihar Co-operative
Societies Act, 1935 read with Rules of 1959, the source of power to the Registrar, Co-operative
Societies whereunder the impugned order could have been passed by giving a complete go-bye to
the Rules, the learned Advocate General in a very unambiguous terms accepted the legal position
and submitted that so far as the statutory power is concerned, he would admit that under the
scheme of the Act and the Rules framed thereunder, the Registrar, Co-operative Societies is not
vested with any such power whereunder a declaration in the nature of the second part of the
impugned order could have been made.
The moment learned Advocate General accepted the legal position that no such power is vested with
the Registrar, this Court called for a suggestion as to how to resolve this issue now. In view of what
has transpired in further submissions, this Court comes to a conclusion that there is no dispute that
the Registrar, Co-operative Societies could not have issued a declaration in the nature it has been
done vide second part of the impugned order as contained in Annexure '2' to the lead writ
application. In order to take note of the second part of the impugned order the entire Annexure-
Patna High Court CWJC No.14396 of 2019 dt.27-08-2019 '2' is extracted hereunder for a ready
reference:-

the Registrar, Cooperative Societies in the guise of exercise of power under Section
44AQ (6) of the Act and the Rules framed thereunder is hereby set aside.

This Court would hasten to add that at this stage some grievance were also raised
with regard to the first part of the order contained in memo no. 6349 dated
05.07.2019, however, very soon learned counsel for the petitioners as well as learned
Advocate General gave up the discussions on the first part finding that the same is
only in accordance with the provisions of law and it applies to the applications which
were already pending with the PACS and in respect of which no decision was taken
within the statutory period of fifteen days. Patna High Court CWJC No.14396 of 2019
dt.27-08-2019 It has been agreed at the Bar both by learned counsel for the
petitioners as well as the learned Advocate General that in the given circumstance
now it would only be just and proper to give three weeks time for submission of fresh
applications by the eligible applicants for the membership of PACS of the Gram
Panchayat in which he is residing. urther within the same period of three weeks i.e.
upto 17.09.2019 all such applications which have already been submitted online and
the hard copies with the signature of the applicants and other informations have been
submitted in the office of the State respondents shall be transmitted to the concerned
PACS for consideration.
After three weeks from today i.e. from 18.09.2019, the Managing Committee of the
PACS shall consider and take a decision on all the fresh applications and the online
applications which are already submitted and will be transmitted to the PACS, within
the prescribed period. Fifteen days statutory time will be available to the PACS to
take a decision and issue communication of the same to the individual applicant by
post with a copy of the intimation letter to be submitted with the Block Co-operative
Extension Officer of the concerned Block simultaneously and in any case within two
Patna High Court CWJC No.14396 of 2019 dt.27-08-2019 days from the date of
taking of the decision by the Managing Committee of the PACS. The individual
applicant may thereafter, seek their remedy in accordance with law. If the PACS fails
to take a decision within the statutory period of 15 days, the consequences as
contained in Rule 7 (1) (e) shall follow.
After expiry of the statutory period of 15 days available to the PACS for taking a
decision on the applications as stated above, the State Election Authority shall
proceed to notify the programme for preparation of the voter list and finalization of
the same, whereupon the steps for publication of the schedule of Election shall be
taken and notified.
All the writ applications are thus disposed off with the aforesaid observations and
directions.
