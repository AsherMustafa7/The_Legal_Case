Sri Ananda Kumar G vs Karnataka State Open University on 3 August, 2022
Various petitioners in these batch of writ petitions are affected by the public notice dated 16.06.2015
issued by the University Grants Commission (for short 'UGC') in the purported exercise of its power
under University Grants Commission Act, 1956 (for short 'UGC Act, 1956'). They had pursued
various courses under the aegis of Karnataka State Open University (for short 'KSOU'), which is
created under the Karnataka State Open University Act, 1992 ('KSOU Act, 1992' for short) under
'In-House System' (admission of students directly by the KSOU to the courses offered by it). The
details of courses taken by the various petitioners under the 'In- House System' are as follows:

2. Petitioners are having 3 sets of grievances:
(a) On account of public notice dated 16.06.2015 issued by the UGC, petitioners are
virtually deprived of the fruits of the educational degree to which they are entitled to
as courses were offered by a regularly established University namely, KSOU under its
'In-House System'. As a consequence, they have not been issued marks cards for the
various courses undertaken by them even though they have passed the examination
held by the KSOU successfully and further they are not awarded the degree
certificates to which they are otherwise entitled.
(b) The petitioners are denied the opportunity of earning promotions in the
Departments where they are working and large number of them are deprived of the
opportunity of seeking employment under the State, various instrumentalities of the
State and also under the Union of India and its instrumentalities.
(c) They are deprived of the opportunity of
pursuing higher education for which the
courses they have successfully completed
under the aegis of KSOU, is the qualifying course.
They heavily place reliance on the Government Order dated 05.03.2018.
3. These petitioners are students enrolled for the various courses offered by KSOU under the
In-House System for the Academic Years 2013-14 and 2014-15. In view of their grievances as
indicated above, petitioners, in sum and substance are seeking writ of certiorari for quashing the
public notice issued by UGC on 16.06.2015 and further they are seeking a writ of mandamus to
KSOU directing it to issue marks cards and degree certificates for the concerned courses taken and
passed by them and also a writ of mandamus to the UGC to recognize the degrees earned by the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/90345882/ 69
Sri Ananda Kumar G vs Karnataka State Open University on 3 August, 2022
petitioners through the 'In-House System' of KSOU and also writ of mandamus to the Government
of Karnataka to consider the concerned candidates, who are the petitioners herein for the services
for which they are the aspirants.
4. The petitioners have stated in these writ petitions that they were qualified and eligible to pursue
the courses undertaken by them under 'In-House System' of KSOU and they were admitted in
accordance with the provisions of KSOU Act, 1992 and thereafter, they had pursued the courses as
per the syllabus and curriculum and they had taken examinations held by the KSOU and the KSOU
had declared them to have successfully completed the course by passing examinations held by it.
They have further stated in these writ petitions that in view of the subsequent public notice issued
by the UGC on 16.06.2015, by which time they had already taken admission and started the course
for the Academic Years 2013-14 and 2014-15 and therefore, if they are denied the benefits of the
courses passed by them regularly held by KSOU under the 'In-House System', they would be
deprived of the opportunity of earning livelihood in violation of their right to "life".
5. KSOU in the statement of objections filed by it has essentially taken a position that upto the
Academic Year 2012-13, it had recognition granted by Distance Education Council (for short 'DEC')
of the Indira Gandhi National Open University (for short 'IGNOU'), which is a creation of Indira
Gandhi National Open University Act, 1985. Subsequently, the DEC was taken over by the UGC. It
has further not disputed the fact that DEC, which was earlier an authority of the IGNOU after its
taking over by UGC, had the power to require recognition for all the Universities created by a statute
of the Central Government or the statute of the State Legislature, etc. properly obtained from UGC.
It has also stated that by the time the public notice was issued by the UGC on 16.06.2015 the
admissions for the Academic Years 2013-14 and 2014-15 had already been completed for the 'In-
House System' and courses had also commenced. KSOU has further taken the position that a
reading of impugned public notice issued by the UGC clearly shows that raison d'être for issuing
same was essentially for admission of students and offering courses through Academic Collaborative
Institutions System (for short 'ACIS'). Its further position is that these petitioners being students of
the 'In-House System' for non technical courses, UGC should not have any objections for
recognizing the courses and awarding degrees to the petitioners for the Academic Years 2013-14 and
2014-15.
6. UGC has filed its statement of objections contending that under UGC Act, 1956, it has the
mandate to ensure that all the Universities in the country maintain proper academic standards and
in order to further effectuate the same, it has the duty to take appropriate action. KSOU sometime
after 2008-09 started flouting the norms for Open and Distance Learning (ODL) set by the DEC,
which was earlier an authority of the IGNOU and ever since 2012 it has become a part of UGC.
KSOU started indiscriminately opening collaborative institutions like study centres, franchises, etc.
in various parts of the country and also started offering technical courses through such agencies.
UGC has further stated that after fixing certain fees for such technical courses in the study centres
and franchises of KSOU outside the State, it was sharing 80% of the fees with such franchisees
leading to lack of control over the standards of education imparted through such agencies in
particular and commercialization in general. It has also taken the position that most of the technical
courses required face to face instructions and they are not suited for imparting under ODL system
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/90345882/ 70
Sri Ananda Kumar G vs Karnataka State Open University on 3 August, 2022
and therefore, UGC had set a clear standard that no University in the country should run technical
courses through ODL. It has stated that UGC had issued several communications to the KSOU
calling upon it to obtain recognition/approval from UGC for the courses and cease imparting
technical courses in its study centres and franchises. It has stated that in view of KSOU not seeking
and securing recognition from UGC for its courses from the Academic Years 2013-14 and 2014-15
and also on account of it admitting students for technical courses through ACIS, it had to issue the
public notice dated 16.06.2015 to prevent gullible students from falling into a trap.
7. KPSC is a party respondent in some of the writ petitions and it has justified its action on the
ground that KSOU was derecognized under the public notice dated 16.06.2015 for the courses run
by it beyond Academic Year 2012-13.
8. The State has taken the position before this Court that insofar as the present petitioners are
concerned they are students under the 'In-House System' for non technical courses and therefore,
upon detailed consideration of the entire facts, it has issued Government Order dated 05.03.2018
permitting the students of the Academic Years 2013-14 and 2014-15 to apply for positions under the
State and its instrumentalities and also secure promotions on the strength of examinations passed
by them.
9. Learned counsel for the petitioners have respectively urged grounds taken by them in the writ
petitions and have submitted that writ petitions are required to be allowed and the reliefs sought for
by them granted to them.
10. Sri.Showri, learned counsel for the UGC strenuously contended that in view of the decision of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in ANNAMALAI UNIVERSITY, REP.
BY REGISTRAR v. SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT,
INFORMATION AND TOURISM DEPARTMENT AND
OTHERS1 the UGC has the power over all Universities including the University created under
statute of a State like KSOU in the matter of setting academic standards and maintaining the same.
He took the Court through the various provisions of IGNOU Act, 1985, KSOU Act, 1992 and also
UGC Act, 1956 and submitted that UGC is a premier academic regulatory institution of the country
whose mandate is not merely to release grants to the universities in the country but also it has the
over-arching responsibility to set academic standards and maintain the same in all the universities.
It had come to the notice of the UGC that KSOU in violation of its power was offering technical
courses through ODL and imparting the same through study centres and franchises leading to
commercialization of education. He also highlighted that KSOU had failed to secure the
recognition/approval from UGC for its courses/programmes for the Academic Years beyond
2012-13. Therefore, it was constrained to issue public notice dated 16.06.2015 in order (2009) 4 SCC
590 to safeguard the interest of students, who may fall victim to the malpractices facilitated by
KSOU. He submitted that KSOU had not even sent an application seeking recognition/approval for
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/90345882/ 71
Sri Ananda Kumar G vs Karnataka State Open University on 3 August, 2022
the Academic Years commencing from 2013-14. He pointed out that after KSOU submitted the
application UGC has taken steps as contemplated under UGC Act, 1956, issued recognition/approval
to the KSOU from the Academic Year 2017-18. He therefore contended that UGC having acted fully
within its power and under the mandate of UGC Act, 1956, public notice issued is in accordance with
law and further in any case same being only a notice, there is no case made out to find fault with any
of the steps taken by UGC and therefore writ petitions are required to be dismissed.
11. Sri.B.V.Krishna, learned AGA submitted that since these petitioners are 'In-House System'
students, the State having considered the hardships faced by them issued a Government Order
dated 05.03.2018 permitting them to take the benefit of examinations passed by them by way of
seeking appointments under the State and its instrumentalities and also for earning promotions in
the Departments where they are already serving.
12. Learned counsel for the KPSC submitted that it had taken steps fully in accordance with the
directions of the UGC and also on account of the fact that KSOU was de- recognized beyond
Academic Year 2012-13.
13. Essential facts namely, that the KSOU is a creature under the KSOU Act, 1992, enacted by the
Karnataka State Legislature and it had received the assent of the Governor of the State with due
gazette publication and that these petitioners are students duly admitted to non technical courses
through the 'In-House System' are not in dispute. So also the fact that petitioners have all fulfilled
the requirements under KSOU Act, 1992, the relevant statutes etc., in regard to their completion of
the course and further that they had duly passed the examinations are not in dispute. The
petitioners have approached the Court with these writ petitions on account of the fact that inspite of
their due admission to the 'In-House System' for non technical courses offered by the KSOU, which
is created under a statute enacted by State Legislature, they have not been issued the marks cards
and degree certificates in relation to respective courses duly completed by them. The only reason
adduced by the KSOU for not issuing marks cards and degree certificates in the statement of
objections filed is that UGC had issued a public notice dated 16.06.2015 and further that UGC has
not issued the recognition/approval for the courses beyond the Academic Year 2012-13.
14. Section 5 of the KSOU Act reads as follows:
"5. Powers of the University.-(1) The University shall have the following powers
namely :-
(i) ............
(ii) to plan and prescribe courses of study for degrees, diplomas, certificates and for
research or any other purpose;
(iii)to hold examinations and confer degrees, diplomas, certificates or other academic
distinctions or recognitions including Ph.D on persons who have pursued a course of
study or conducted research in the manner laid down by the statutes and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/90345882/ 72
Sri Ananda Kumar G vs Karnataka State Open University on 3 August, 2022
Ordinances"
15. It is not the position of KSOU as reflected from its statement of objections that it did not have the
power to offer non technical courses through ODL and In-House System nor that it did not have the
power to hold examinations and confer degrees. The KSOU Act, 1992 is a self contained enactment.
The only requirement for the KSOU in order to issue marks card and confer degrees for the courses
run and examinations held is that the students should have successfully completed the course in
accordance with its statutes and the ordinances and thereafter insofar as KSOU is concerned it
cannot withhold issue of marks cards and conferment of degree certificates on the ground that an
agency however superior it may be has some objections to the manner of running the University
namely, KSOU in this case. If the KSOU has flouted any norms fixed by a regulatory agency like
UGC, which has over all power and mandate to set academic standards in all the Universities in the
country and ensure that such standards are maintained and in this behalf if UGC issues directives or
advisory, that may affect the efficacy of the degree conferred by KSOU in terms of eligibility of
holders of such degrees to either prosecute further studies in educational institutions based on such
degrees or to seek employment and for such other purposes. In other words, KSOU Act, 1992, being
a self contained enactment, if the students have fulfilled all the requirements to earn the degree
from the courses undertaken by them, KSOU which has offered the courses, held the examinations
and awarded marks, cannot legally withhold issuing of marks cards and the degree certificates. In
that view of the matter, especially since KSOU and UGC have not pointed out any disabling factor
disentitling the petitioners from receiving the marks cards and their degree certificates, the KSOU is
under legal obligation to issue the marks cards and award degree certificates to the petitioners and
consequently, such a direction is required to be issued at the instance of the petitioners. This is also
the view taken by the Government as per its order dated 05.03.2018 which reads as follows:

16. Sri.Showri, learned counsel for the UGC has strenuously contended that KSOU has indulged in
serious malpractices, which have deleterious effect on maintenance of academic standards in the
country. He elaborated the said submission by pointing out that KSOU has indiscriminately
facilitated the opening of study centres and frachises all over the country offering technical courses
through ODL mode with the result there was mushrooming of ACIS all over the country with further
sharing of the fees liberally with them and the end result was two fold namely, commercialization of
the education and candidates earning technical degrees without proper and requisite training. On
the second aspect, learned counsel Sri.Showri particularly emphasized that most of the technical
courses required imparting of the instructions on face to face mode. He also submitted that UGC
had corresponded with the KSOU to stop such courses and inspite of the same technical courses
were continued with ACIS not being disbanded.
17. As already noticed by me, this contention does not detract from the fact that KSOU Act, 1992, is a
self contained enactment and it has the power and mandate to run permissible courses, specifically
non technical courses, in the 'In-House System'. The fact that UGC is the summit academic
regulatory body created under UGC Act, 1956, with the mandate of setting and maintaining
academic standards in the field of higher education is no longer open to question. It is not necessary
to refer to the various provisions of UGC Act, 1956, for the current purpose in view of catena of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/90345882/ 75
Sri Ananda Kumar G vs Karnataka State Open University on 3 August, 2022
decisions rendered by the Apex Court.
18. In ANNAMALAI UNIVERSITY, REP. BY REGISTRAR v. SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT,
INFORMATION AND TOURISM DEPARTMENT AND OTHERS2 the Hon'ble Supreme Court had
an occasion to consider the interplay of the IGNOU Act, 1985 and the provisions of UGC Act, 1956,
and thereafter has unequivocally declared that the Universities constituted under the State
Universities Act and also the Universities constituted by the parliament are all amenable to the
regulatory control of UGC, insofar as, setting academic standards and maintenance of same is
concerned.
(2009) 4 SCC 590 "40. The UGC Act was enacted by Parliament in exercise of its power under Entry
66 of List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India whereas the Open University Act
was enacted by Parliament in exercise of its power under Entry 25 of List III thereof. The question of
repugnancy of the provisions of the said two Acts, therefore, does not arise. It is true that the
Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Open University Act shows that the formal system of
education had not been able to provide an effective means to equalise educational opportunities.
The system is rigid inter alia in respect of attendance in classrooms. Combinations of subjects are
also inflexible.
41. Was the alternative system envisaged under the Open University Act in substitution of the
formal system, is the question. In our opinion, in the matter of ensuring the standard of education,
it is not. The distinction between a formal system and an informal system is in the mode and
manner in which education is imparted. The UGC Act was enacted for effectuating coordination and
determination of standards in universities. The purport and object for which it was enacted must be
given full effect.
42. The provisions of the UGC Act are binding on all universities whether conventional or open. Its
powers are very broad. The Regulations framed by it in terms of clauses (e), (f), (g) and (h) of
sub-section (1) of Section 26 are of wide amplitude. They apply equally to open universities as also
to formal conventional universities. In the matter of higher education, it is necessary to maintain
minimum standards of instructions. Such minimum standards of instructions are required to be
defined by UGC. The standards and the coordination of work or facilities in universities must be
maintained and for that purpose required to be regulated. The powers of UGC under Sections
26(1)(f) and 26(1)(g) are very broad in nature. Subordinate legislation as is well known when validly
made becomes part of the Act. We have noticed hereinbefore that the functions of UGC are all-
pervasive in respect of the matters specified in clause
(d) of sub-section (1) of Section 12-A and clauses (a) and (c) of sub-section (2) thereof.
43. Indisputably, as has been contended by the learned counsel for the appellant as also the learned
Solicitor General that the Open University Act was enacted to achieve a specific object. It opens new
vistas for imparting education in a novel manner. Students do not have to attend classes regularly.
They have wide options with regard to the choice of subjects but the same, in our opinion, would not
mean that despite a parliamentary Act having been enacted to give effect to the constitutional
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/90345882/ 76
Sri Ananda Kumar G vs Karnataka State Open University on 3 August, 2022
mandate contained in Entry 66 of List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India,
activities and functions of the private universities and open universities would be wholly
unregulated.
44. It has not been denied or disputed before us that in the matter of laying down qualification of
the teachers, running of the University and the matters provided for under the UGC Act (sic the
Regulations) are applicable and binding on all concerned. The Regulations framed, as noticed
hereinbefore, clearly aimed at the open universities. When the regulations are part of the statute, it
is difficult to comprehend as to how the same which operate in a different field would be ultra vires
the parliamentary Act. IGNOU has not made any regulation; it has not made any ordinance. It is
guided by the Regulations framed by UGC. The validity of the provisions of the Regulations has not
been questioned either by IGNOU or by the appellant University. From a letter dated 5-5-2004
issued by Mr H.P. Dikshit, who was not only the Vice-Chancellor but also the Chairman of DEC of
IGNOU it is evident that the appellant University has violated the mandatory provisions of the
Regulations.
45. The amplitude of the provisions of the UGC Act vis-à-vis the universities constituted under the
State Universities Acts which would include within its purview a university made by Parliament also
is now no longer res integra.
55. The submission of Mr K. Parasaran that as in compliance with the provisions contained in
Regulation 7, UGC had been provided with information in regard to instructions through
non-formal/distance education relating to the observance thereof by itself, in our opinion, would
not satisfy the legal requirement. It is one thing to say that informations have been furnished but
only because no action had been taken by UGC in that behalf, the same would not mean that an
illegality has been cured. The power of relaxation is a statutory power. It can be exercised in a case
of this nature.
56. Grant of relaxation cannot be presumed by necessary implication only because UGC did not
perform its duties. Regulation 2 of the 1985 Regulations being imperative in character,
non-compliance therewith would entail its consequences. The power of relaxation conferred on UGC
being in regard to the date of implementation or for admission to the first or second degree courses
or to give exemption for a specified period in regard to other clauses in the Regulations on the merit
of each case do not lead to a conclusion that such relaxation can be granted automatically. The fact
that exemption is required to be considered on the merit of each case is itself a pointer to show that
grant of relaxation by necessary implication cannot be inferred. If mandatory provisions of the
statute have not been complied with, the law will take its own course. The consequences will ensue.
57. Relaxation, in our opinion, furthermore cannot be granted in regard to the basic things
necessary for conferment of a degree. When a mandatory provision of a statute has not been
complied with by an administrative authority, it would be void. Such a void order cannot be
validated by inaction.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/90345882/ 77
Sri Ananda Kumar G vs Karnataka State Open University on 3 August, 2022
58. The only point which survives for our consideration is as to whether the purported post facto
approval granted to the appellant University of programmes offered through distance modes is
valid. DEC may be an authority under the Act, but its orders ordinarily would only have a
prospective effect. It having accepted in its letter dated 5-5- 2004 that the appellant University had
no jurisdiction to confer such degrees, in our opinion, could not have validated an invalid act. The
degrees become invalidated in terms of the provisions of the UGC Act. When mandatory
requirements have been violated in terms of the provisions of one Act, an authority under another
Act could not have validated the same and that too with a retrospective effect.
59. The provisions of the UGC Act are not in conflict with the provisions of the Open University Act.
It is beyond any cavil of doubt that the UGA Act shall prevail over the Open University Act. It has,
however, been argued that the Open University Act is a later Act. But we have noticed hereinbefore
that the nodal Ministry knew of the provision of both the Acts. The Regulations were framed almost
at the same time after passing of the Open University Act. The Regulations were framed at a later
point of time. Indisputably, the Regulations embrace within its fold the matters covered under the
Open University Act also."

19. The public notice dated 16.06.2015 issued by the UGC reads as follows:
"F.No.UGC/DEB/8/KSOU/1/2015 16th June,2015 Public Notice Karnataka State
Open University, Mysore-Discontinuation of recognition of programmes through
ODL mode
1. Karnataka State Open University, Mysore, in collaboration with private
institutions/entities/coaching centres spread all over the country and even abroad,
has been offering programmes through distance learning mode by blatantly flouting
the norms, guidelines and directives of University. Grants Commission and erstwhile
Distance Education Council of Indira Gandhi National Open Universtiy, New Delhi.
Taking cognizance of this fact, the programmes offered by KSOU, Mysore has not
been recognized by UGC beyond 2012-13. This has been done after issue of a Show
Cause notice to them on 10.06.2011 and after considering their response including
personal hearing of the official of the University.
2. It has, however, been noticed that despite this the university remained underterred
and is continuing to offer programmes through distance learning mode in violation of
the UGC policy on territorial jurisdiction vide UGC public notice dated 27th June,
2013. The university has also been offering professional/technical programmes in
violation of the norms of the concerned regulatory bodies and without their approval.
Moreover, the university has been offering engineering programmes, despite clear
directions of Ministry of Human Resource of Development vide their D.O. letter
No.6-7/2009-DL dated 29th July, 2009 and DEC letter dated 13th August, 2009 and
recent UGC public notice dated 11th March, 2015 (All the three letters available on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/90345882/ 78
Sri Ananda Kumar G vs Karnataka State Open University on 3 August, 2022
UGC DEB website). The university has also started offering online programmes,
which are not recognized by UGC, as an exclusive method of distance education.
3. The General Public, students and other stake holders are, therefore, cautioned
through this public notice against the wrong reporting/publicity in newspaper and
television by the university about its territorial jurisdiction and about validity of the
recognition of its programmes, including professional/technical programmes. Taking
admissions to such programmes may jeopardize the career of the students, in view of
the absence of recognition of the programmes of the university by UGC.
Sd/-
(Jaspal S. Sandhu) Secretary, UGC"
(Emphasis supplied)
20. A close reading of the above public notice shows that UGC has rightly taken umbrage at the
KSOU offering its courses through ACIS by facilitating opening of study centres/ fracnchises all over
the country and also through them offering technical courses to large number of students. UGC has
also taken exception to KSOU offering such courses beyond its territorial jurisdiction, understably,
because it is well-neigh impossible for the KSOU with its limited resources to oversee the standard
of instructions imparted in such far- flung centres. However, the present petitioners are all 'In-
House System' students, who have taken non technical courses and as per the norms fixed under
KSOU Act, 1992 and its statutes and ordinance and students have successfully completed the course
and have passed the examinations. It is also true that in view of the superior regulatory position
accorded to UGC and in view of the DEC forming a part of UGC itself and same requiring the KSOU
seeking formal recognition/approval for the programmes run by it, there was an obligation on the
KSOU to formally apply and secure recognition/approval from DEC of the UGC. Admittedly for the
courses for Academic Years 2013-14 and 2014-15 to which these petitions belong KSOU had not
taken such recognition.
21. At this stage, it is necessary to make reference to UGC Regulations, 1985 regarding the Minimum
Standards of Instructions for the Grant of the First Degree Through Non-Formal/Distance
Education ('UGC Regulations, 1985' for short) dated 25.11.1985. These Regulations were framed
under Clause (f) of Sub-Section (1) of Section 26 of UGC Act, 1956. They read as follows:
"UNIVERSITY GRANTS COMMISSION BAHADUR SHAH ZAFAR MARG NEW
DELHI UGC Regulations, 1985 regarding the Minimum Standards of Instructions for
the Grant of the First Degree through Non-formal/Distance Education 25th
November 1985 No.F1117/83(CP)? In exercise of the powers conferred by Clause (f)
of subsection (1) of Section 26 of the University Grants Commission Act, 1956 (No.3
of 1956), the University Grants Commission makes the following regulations,
namely:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/90345882/ 79
Sri Ananda Kumar G vs Karnataka State Open University on 3 August, 2022
1. Short title, application and commencement:-
(1)These regulations may be called the University Grants Commission (the minimum
standards of instructions for the grant of the first degree through non
formal/distance education in the faculties of Arts, Humanities, Fine Arts, Music,
Social Sciences, Commerce and Sciences) Regulations, 1985.
(2)They shall apply to every university established or incorporated by or under a
Central Act, Provincial Act or of a Section 2 of the University Grants Commission Act,
1956 and every institution deemed to be University under Section 3 of the said Act.
(3)They shall come into force on June 1, 1986.
2. Admission/Students:
(1) No student shall be eligible for admission to the 1st Degree Course through
non-formal/distance education unless he has successfully completed 12 years
schooling through an examination conducted by a Board/University. In case there is
no previous academic record, he shall be eligible for admission if he has passed an
entrance test conducted by the University provided that he is not below the age of21
yearson July 1 of the year of admission.
(2) No student shall be eligible for the award of the first degree unless he has
successfully completed a three year course; this degree may be called the
B.A./B.Sc./B.Com. (General Honours/Special) degree as the case may be.
Provided that no student shall be eligible to seek admission to the Master's Course in these faculties,
who has not successfully pursued the first Degree Course of three years duration.
Provided further that, as a transitory measure where the universities are unable to change over to a
three year degree course, they may award a B.A./B.Sc./B.Com. (Pass) degree on successful
completion of two year course, but that no student of this stream shall be eligible for admission to
the Master's course unless he has undergone a further one year bridge course and passed the same.
The three year degree course after 10+2 stage should in no case be termed as B.A./B.Sc./B.com.
(Pass) degree.
3. Programme of study:
1. Each lesson shall constitute approximately one week's reading and there shall be at
least 25 lessons in each main subject of study. The lessons shall be dispatched to the
student at regular intervals.
2. The University shall set up study centres (outside the headquarters) in areas where
there is a reasonable concentration of students. Each study centre shall have
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/90345882/ 80
Sri Ananda Kumar G vs Karnataka State Open University on 3 August, 2022
adequate library facilities (text books, reference materials and lessons and supporting
materials). They shall also have qualified parttime instruction/counselling staff to
advise and assist the students in the studies and remove individual difficulties.
3. A contract programmed of 810 days shall be organised in different places where
there is a reasonably good number of students, to include lectures and discussion in
support of the studies. Classes may be arranged on Sundays and other holidays at the
headquarters.
4. Adequate number of practicals shall be provided in all courses involving such work
and if necessary, these may be arranged in the evening, during holidays or vacations
in the existing institutions.
5. Every student at the undergraduate level shall be required to do at least five home
assignments in each subject which shall be made available to him at regular intervals,
received back, corrected, graded and returned to the student at regular intervals. The
University shall maintain a record of the progress of studies of each student.
6. The minimum number of assignments performed by a student for each subject
shall be 3 in order to be eligible for appearing in the examination in the concerned
subject.
4. Examination:
1. The University shall adopt the guidelines issued by the University Grants
Commission from time to time in regard to the conduct of examinations.
2. There shall be home assignments, students response sheets, contact programmes
and semester/year end examination. The marks or grades obtained in home
assignment and response sheets shall be shown separately in the grade card along
with percentile ranking. Further more, the University shall develop a dependable
system of checks and controls on marks or grades awarded in home assignment and
response sheets.
Explanations:
Percentile rank refers to the percentage of all the examinees in the course who had
the same or higher percentage of marks or grade in the examination.
3. The examination question papers shall be framed so as to ensure that no part of
the syllabus is left out of study by a student.
4. No Semester/Yearend examination shall be held in a subject unless the University
is satisfied that at least 75% of the programme of study indicated under
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/90345882/ 81
Sri Ananda Kumar G vs Karnataka State Open University on 3 August, 2022
subregulations 3, and 3(4) have been actually conducted".
22. In terms of the above Regulations, it is applicable to every University established
or incorporated by or under a Central Act, Provincial Act or those which come under
Section 2 of UGC Act, 1956. Section 2(f) of UGC Act, 1956, reads as follows:
"2.(a) ......
(f) "University" means a University established or incorporated by or under a Central
Act, a Provincial Act or a State Act and includes any such institution as may, in
consultation with the University concerned, be recognized by the Commission
accordance with the regulations made in this behalf under this Act."
23. Regulation 2 of UGC Regulations, 1985, deals with conditions for admission of students to the
degree courses. Regulation 3 of UGC Regulations, 1985, deals with the program of study and
Regulation 4 of UGC Regulations, 1985, deals with the examination in all the universities. There
cannot be any dispute that KSOU is an university within the meaning of Section 2(f) of UGC Act,
1956 and therefore, in regard to admission of students for programmes and examination for the
degree courses offered through 'In-House System' for non technical courses in KSOU to which
categories all these petitioners belong, in addition to requirement under KSOU Act, the statutes and
the ordinances framed thereunder they also have to fulfill the aforementioned regulations under
UGC Act. As already noticed, the infraction alleged against KSOU during Academic Years beyond
2012-13 till the recognition earlier granted was renewed with effect from Academic Year 2017-18
was that University was facilitating imparting of education under ACIS for technical courses through
study centres or frachises all over the country, which contributed to dilution of the academic
standards. UGC has not at all taken a position that KSOU in regard to these petitioners during their
pursuit of studies in non technical courses through 'In-House System' had fallen short of any of the
standards set by it under the provisions of UGC Act, 1956, UGC Regulations, 1985, or under the
provisions of KSOU Act, 1992, and statutes or ordinances framed thereunder. UGC has not placed
any inspection report or any other material to substantiate the same.
24. Sri.Showri, learned counsel for UGC however points out that while UGC has not pointed out any
infraction of provisions of UGC Act, 1956, of UGC Regulations, 1985, or the provisions of KSOU Act,
1992, itself insofar as 'In-House System' for non technical courses pursued by the petitioners during
Academic Years 2013-14 and 2014-15 is concerned, KSOU having not obtained recognition/approval
for those relevant Academic Years from DEC of UGC, ex post facto approval/recognition cannot be
issued by UGC. In support of the same, Sri.Showri, learned counsel places reliance on the decision
rendered in ORISSA LIFT IRRIGATION CORPORATION LIMITED v. RABI SANKAR PATRO AND
OTHERS3.
(2018) 1 SCC 468 "55. Para 3 of the Notification dated 22-11-1991 which constituted DEC shows that
there was no representation for any member or representative of AICTE. The provisions of the
IGNOU Act show that the study centres as defined in the IGNOU Act are that of IGNOU and not of
any other university or institution. The concept of distance education under clause (v) of Section 5 is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/90345882/ 82
Sri Ananda Kumar G vs Karnataka State Open University on 3 August, 2022
also in relation to the academic programmes of IGNOU. It undoubtedly has powers under clauses
(vii), (xiii) and (xxiii) to cooperate with other universities but the IGNOU Act nowhere entitles
IGNOU to be the controlling authority of the entire field of distance education of learning across the
country and in relation to programmes of other universities or institutions as well. The Order dated
29-12-2012 issued by MHRD, therefore, correctly appreciated that DEC created under Statute 28 of
the IGNOU Act could not act as a regulator for other universities. In any event of the matter, the
policy guidelines issued from time to time made it abundantly clear that DEC alone was not entitled
to grant permission for open and distance learning and appropriate permissions from the requisite
authorities were always required and insisted upon. Despite such policy statements, DEC went on
granting permissions without even consulting AICTE. Such exercise on the Part of DEC was
completely without jurisdiction.
56. It was laid down by this Court in Annamalai University v. Deptt. of Information and Tourism
that no relaxation could be granted in regard to the basic things necessary for conferment of a
degree and if a mandatory provision is not complied with by an administrative authority, the action
would be void. This leads us to conclude that the permissions granted by DEC in the first instance
allowing the deemed to be universities in question to introduce courses leading to the award of
degrees in Engineering were illegal and opposed to law. The illegality in the exercise of power was to
such an extent that it could not be cured by ex post facto approvals granted later. We have also seen
that the exercise of grant of ex post facto approvals, as a matter of fact, was only superficial and
perfunctory. Such exercise was done in the face of declared policy statements governing the field
and even when specific complaints were received about deemed to be universities concerned. Yet,
without causing any inspection such power was exercised which part is already dealt with and the
exercise of power has been found by us to be suffering from illegality and infirmity. The only thing in
favour of the deemed to be universities concerned is the fact that the Joint Committee of
UGC-AICTE-DEC had endorsed the decision though such exercise was also completely flawed. That
exercise was against Para 10 of the MoU dated 10-5-2007, which contemplated causing of
inspections and the decision dated 11-5-2007 of the Joint Committee itself that for an
institution/university to offer distance education programmes it was mandatory to offer the same in
face to face mode.
57. Having found the entire exercise of grant of ex post facto approval to be incorrect and illegal, the
logical course in normal circumstances would have been not only to set aside such ex post facto
approvals but also to pass consequential directions to recall all the degrees granted in pursuance
thereof in respect of courses leading to award of degrees in Engineering. However, since the 2004
UGC Guidelines themselves had given liberty to the deemed to be universities concerned to apply for
ex post facto approval, the matter is required to be considered with some sympathy so that interest
of those students who were enrolled during the academic sessions 2001-2005 is protected. Though
we cannot wish away the fact that the deemed to be universities concerned flagrantly violated and
entered into areas where they had no experience and started conducting courses through distance
education system illegally, the overbearing interest of the students concerned persuades us not to
resort to recall of all the degrees in Engineering granted in pursuance of the said ex post facto
approval. However, the fact remains that the facilities available at the study centres concerned were
never checked nor any inspections were conducted. It is not possible at this length of time to order
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/90345882/ 83
Sri Ananda Kumar G vs Karnataka State Open University on 3 August, 2022
any inspection. But there must be confidence and assurance about the worthiness of the students
concerned. We, therefore, deem it appropriate to grant some chance to the students concerned to
have their ability tested by authorities competent in that behalf. We, therefore, direct that all the
degrees in Engineering granted to students who were enrolled during the academic years 2001 to
2005 shall stand suspended till they pass such examination under the joint supervision of
AICTE-UGC in the manner indicated hereinafter. Further, every single advantage on the basis of
that degree shall also stand suspended.
58. AICTE is directed to devise within one month from the date of this judgment modalities to
conduct appropriate test(s) both in written examination as well as in practicals for the students
concerned admitted during the academic sessions 2001-2005 covering all the subjects concerned. It
is entirely left to the discretion of AICTE to come out with such modalities as it may think
appropriate and the tests in that behalf shall be conducted in the National Institutes of Technology
in the respective States wherever the students are located. The choice may be given to the students
to appear at the examination which ideally should be conducted during May-June 2018 or on such
dates as AICTE may determine. Not more than two chances be given to the students concerned and
if they do not pass the test(s) their degrees shall stand recalled and cancelled. If a particular student
does not wish to appear in the test(s), the entire money deposited by such student towards tuition
and other charges shall be refunded to that student by the deemed to be university concerned within
a month of the exercise of such option. The students be given time till 15-1-2018 to exercise such
option. The entire expenditure for conducting the test(s) in respect of students who wish to undergo
test(s) shall be recovered from the deemed to be universities concerned by 31-3-2018. If they clear
the test(s) within the stipulated time, all the advantages or benefits shall be restored to the
candidates concerned. We make it clear at the cost of repetition that if the candidates concerned do
not clear the test(s) within the time stipulated or choose not to appear at the test(s), their degrees in
Engineering through distance education shall stand recalled and cancelled. It goes without saying
that any promotion or advancement in career on the basis of such degree shall also stand
withdrawn, however, any monetary benefits or advantages in that behalf shall not be recovered from
them."

25. I have carefully perused the above decision which in turn places reliance on a previous decision
of the Apex Court in ANNAMALAI UNIVERSITY, REP. BY REGISTRAR v. SECRETARY TO
GOVERNMENT, INFORMATION AND TOURISM DEPARTMENT AND OTHERS4. In the said
cases it was brought out before the Hon'ble Apex Court that certain (2009) 4 SCC 590 mandatory
provisions were not complied with by the administrative authority and in such an event, the action
taken itself being void cannot be approved or regularized ex post facto. As an example, in ORISSA
LIFT IRRIGATION CORPORATION case, it was noticed that there was no representation for any
member or representative of AICTE and such other defects which go to the substratum of the
matter. As records now placed before the Court reflect, the only reason why the UGC had clamped
down on KSOU is that it was running ACIS with the technical courses through the franchisees and
study centres all over India. There is absolutely no material placed regarding 'In-House System'
students like the petitioners who have taken non technical courses, as to whether in regard to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/90345882/ 84
Sri Ananda Kumar G vs Karnataka State Open University on 3 August, 2022
course taken by them there was any infraction of the substantive provisions of UGC Act, 1956 or its
Regulations, 1985 having a bearing on the academic standards. Therefore, with the materials now
placed before the Court by the learned counsel for the UGC there is nothing to infer that any
substantial provisions or UGC Act, 1956 or Regulations thereunder was violated by KSOU in
running its 'In-House System' imparting instructions for non technical course during Academic
Years 2013-14 and 2014-15. The principal pre-condition for denying "ex post facto approval"
postulated by Hon'ble Supreme Court in the said decision is the violation of mandatory substantial
provisions of the UGC Act, 1956, which has a bearing on maintenance of academic standards by the
University, in this case KSOU vis-à-vis the courses taken by the petitioners. Therefore, these courses
being non technical in nature imparted through 'In-House System' UGC is required to redecide the
entire question within a reasonable time frame and take a decision as to whether any disability
should attach to the qualification earned by these petitioners under the provisions of KSOU Act,
1992 and statues and ordinances framed thereunder.
26. In view of the above, these writ petitions are entitled to succeed in terms as below and I proceed
to pass the following:
ORDER (1) Issue a writ of mandamus directing the KSOU to issue marks cards and
degree certificates to these petitioners, if the petitioners or such among them have
undergone the courses prescribed and passed the examinations in terms of KSOU
Act, 1992, statutes and ordinances framed thereunder within a period of 2 months.
(2) Issue a writ of mandamus to State of Karnataka or KPSC, as the case may be, or to
both, to consider the applications of such of the petitioners as have obtained marks
cards and degree certificates in terms of (1) above for the purpose of employment
under the State of Karnataka and its instrumentalities.
(3) Issue a writ of mandamus to UGC to consider the cases of the petitioners, who
have taken the courses as indicated in the writ petitions through instructions
imparted by ODL and In-House System of KSOU during the Academic Years 2013-14
and 2014-15 in accordance with law after holding enquiry regarding violations of any
substantial provisions of the UGC Act, 1956 and UGC Regulations, 1985, for the
specific purpose of ascertaining whether KSOU has committed any infraction in
imparting instructions, which has bearing on the maintenance of academic
standards.
(4) The enquiry shall be finalized within 6 weeks after giving full opportunity to
KSOU to place all the necessary material before the Enquiring Committee of UGC.
