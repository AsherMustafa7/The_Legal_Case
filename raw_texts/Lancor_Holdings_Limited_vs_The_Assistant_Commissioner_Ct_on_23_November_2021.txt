COMMON ORDER
The petitioner has challenged the impugned order dated 18.02.2020 passed by the respondent
pursuant to a show cause notice dated 28.04.2017 issued to the petitioner under Section 10A of the
Central Sales Tax Act, 1956. By the notice dated 28.04.2017 a proposal was made to show cause as to
why penalty equivalent to 150% of tax due should not be demanded by the petitioner under Section
10A of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.10401, 10406 & 10408 of 2020
2.The said show cause notice proceeds an inspection by the Enforcement Department of the
respondent on 18.11.2016 when it was noticed that the petitioner had purchased doors from a dealer
in Karnataka and issued C form against the purchase, even though the petitioner's Central Sales Tax
Registration in Form – B did not include purchase of door for resale. The petitioner appears to have
given a detailed reply to the Enforcement Department and placed the reliance on the decision of the
Hon'ble Full Bench of this Court in the case of State of Tamil Nadu Vs. Nu-Thread Tyres 2006 (148)
STC 256.
3.It is the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner, that the notice dated 28.04.2017, a
detailed reply was filed by the petitioner on 24.05.2017 which has not been considered in impugned
order and therefore the impugned passed by the respondent was liable to be quashed.
4.It is further submitted that the impugned order is a non speaking order in as much as the
mandatory requirement of Section 10A of the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.10401,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26990578/ 2
Lancor Holdings Limited vs The Assistant Commissioner (Ct) on 23 November, 2021
10406 & 10408 of 2020 Central Sales Tax, 1956 has not been followed. He further submits that
though the proposal was under Section 10A of the Central Sales Tax, Act, 1956, in the impugned
order a tax of Rs.8,13,314/- has been demanded contrary to Section 9 of the Central Sales Tax Act. It
is therefore submitted that even if tax was due, it is to be collected only from the selling dealer by the
jurisdictional Assessing Officer in Karnataka. It is therefore submitted that even on this ground the
impugned order has to go.
5.The learned counsel for the petitioner further submits the impugned order has simply proceeded
to impose penalty equivalent to 150% alleged tax due on the purchase made by the petitioner for
inter- state dealer in Karnataka based on the Government Order in G.O.Ms.No.61 Commercial Taxes
and Religious Endowments Department, dated 24.01.1984.
6.The learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted that post facto the petitioner has also got
Central Sales Tax registration amended in Form D with effect from 11.06.2016 and therefore the
question of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.10401, 10406 & 10408 of 2020 imposing
penalty on the petitioner cannot be countenanced. The learned counsel for the petitioner further
submits that the impugned order cannot be explained by way of counter in this proceeding by either
explaining the reasons for imposing penalty or to justify the levy of tax confirmed in the impugned
order.
7.Appearing on behalf of the respondent, the learned Special Government Pleader for the
respondent submits that the impugned orders are well-reasoned and requires no interference. The
learned counsel for the respondent has placed reliance on the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of State of Tamilnadu Vs. Kodaianal Motor Union (P) Ltd 1986 AIR 1973, 1986
SCR (2) 927 wherein it was held as follows:
''We must remember that the provision is a penal provision. It has further to be borne
in mind that the expression 'if' is not same as 'as if' nor does it contemplate a deeming
privision. It has also to be borne in mind that the provision was introduced for the
imposition of penalty in lieu of prosecution. The purpose of the Act and the object of
a particular section has to be borne in mind. Having regard to the same, we are in
agreement with the view expressed by the Orissa High Court in Bisra Limestone
Company Ltd Vs. Sales Tax Officer, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos.10401, 10406 & 10408 of 2020 Rourkela Circle, Uditnagar, and Others,
(supra), Jammu & Kashmir High Court in the Assessing Authority and another Vs.
Jammu Metal Rolling Mills, (supra), the High Court of Kerala in Kottayam Electricals
Private Limited Vs. The State of Kerala (supra). The High Court of Mysore in M.Paid
& Sons Vs. The State of Mysore (supra), the High Court of Gujarat in The Gaekwar
Mills Limited Vs. The State of Gujarat (supra) and with respect we are unable to
accept the views of Veeraswami, C.J. In State of Madras Vs. Prem Industrial
Corporation (supra), and the other decision of the Madras High Court in Deputy
Commissioner of Commercial Taxes (supra).''

Lancor Holdings Limited vs The Assistant Commissioner (Ct) on 23 November, 2021
8.The learned counsel for the respondent further submits that the petitioner having violated the
mandatory requirements of The Central Sales Tax (Registration and Turn Over) Rules, 1957
particularly Rule 12 cannot ask for any interference as the records speaks for themselves and no
further reasonings are required for imposing penalty under Section 10A of the Central Sales Tax Act,
1956. It is further submitted that the respondent had the option of prosecuting the petitioner for
violations of Section 10B of the Central Sales Tax Act under Section 11 of the Central Sales Tax Act.
Instead of the respondent has given an easy option to petitioner for imposing penalty in lieu of
prosecution and since the petitioner had violated Section 8(4) of the Central Sales Tax Act for
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.10401, 10406 & 10408 of 2020 violating Rule 10(4B) of
the Central Sales Tax Act and therefore it was liable to penalty under Section 10A of the Central
Sales Tax Act, 1956.
9.Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned Special Government Government for
the respondent.
10.The facts are not in dispute. The petitioner company was started in the year 2003 under the
name of Tvl.DBS Properties Ltd with effect from 16.01.2003. At the time of issue of Central Sales
Tax Registration in Form B, the items mentioned are re-sale of doors. However, it is include Timber.
11.Before the inspection was carried out by the Enforcement Wing, the petitioner had taken steps for
making suitable amendment to its Registration in Form B by including timber. The law on the
subject was considered by Hon'ble Full Bench of this Court in The State of Tamil Nadu Vs.
Tvl.Nu-Tread Tyres and Ors cited above. The Hon'ble Full Bench of this Court after examining all
the decided case laws at that point of time and concluded as follows:
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.10401, 10406 & 10408 of 2020
''12.Section 10(b) provides for an offence if any person being a registered dealer
falsely represents when purchasing any class of goods that goods of such class are
covered by his certificate of registration. Now the expression 'falsely represents'
clearly shows that the element of mens rea is a necessary component of the offence. If
the registered dealer honestly believed that any particular goods are embraced by the
certificate of registration and under this belief makes a representation, he cannot be
held guilty of the offence under Section 10(b) and no penalty can be imposed under
Section 10-A. In Cement Marketing Co. of India Vs. Assistant Commissioner of Sales
Tax MANU/SC/0436/1979:
[1980]124ITR15(SC) similar question fell for consideration under the Madhya
Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, 1958. The question was whether the Assistant
Commissioner of Sales Tax was right in imposing penalty on the assessee for not
showing the amount of freight in the taxable turnover or in the returns. The penalty
was imposed under Section 43 of the Madhya Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, 1958
and Section 9(2) of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 on the ground that the assessee
had furnished false returns by not including the amount of freight in the taxable
turnover disclosed in the returns.

Lancor Holdings Limited vs The Assistant Commissioner (Ct) on 23 November, 2021
21.Section 10(b) of the Act provides for an offence if any person being registered
dealer falsely represents when purchasing any class of goods that goods of such class
are covered by his certificate of registration. The expression 'falsely represents'
clearly shows that the element of mens rea is the necessary component of the offence.
In the absence of men rea, resort to penal provision would not be proper unless it is
established that the conduct of the dealer was contumacious or that there was
deliberate violation of the Statutory provision https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos.10401, 10406 & 10408 of 2020 or willful disregard thereof. If the registered
dealer honestly believes that any particular goods are embraced by the certificate of
registration and on that belief makes a representation, he cannot be held guilty of the
offence under Section 10(b) of the Act and no penalty can be imposed under Section
10A of the Act.
The question whether the assessee acted under the honest belief is a question of fact. Therefore, in
our view, ''mens rea'' is an essential ingredient for the levy of penalty under Section 10(b) of the
Central Sales Tax Act, 1956. The reference is answered accordingly.''
12.Thus, penalty under Section 10A of the Central Sales Tax Act is for making a false representation
while purchasing any class of goods. The State of Tamil Nadu Vs. Tvl.Chola Textiles Ltd and Ors 109
STC 392 it was held as under:-
''the bona fide use of the form by the dealer, who had used these items in the goods
manufactured by it had been accepted by the Assessing Officer. That plea could not
be said to have been lacking in bona fides as it had uniformly been accepted in all the
earlier assessment orders and the certificate was also subsequently amended to
include these other items. Having regard to these facts, the dealer cannot be said to
have committed an offence under Section 10(b) of the C.S.T. Act. Relying on the
above case law, we hold that the levy of penalty under Section 10-A of the CST Act is
not warranted. We set aside the levy of penalty and thereby allowed the appeals in
CTA 101/2000, 99/2000 and 102/2000.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.10401, 10406 & 10408 of 2020 The
Assessing Officer has levied penalty of Rs.33,30,563/- at 150% on the tax due
Rs.22,20,375/- in CST asst; Order No.323196/96-97 dated 08.11.1999. The first
appellate authority has arrived at the tax due for the year 1997-98 at Rs.6,78,448/-
which is disputed in CTA.101/2000 and the appeal stands allowed. For the deletion
of Rs.26,52,112/- by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner (CT) CTSA No.213/2000
is filed and since the appeal is allowed in full, the entire penalty of Rs.33,30,563 is set
aside and the CTA stands dismissed.
13.Similarly, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Commissioner of Sales Tax, U.P. Vs. Sanjiv
Fabrics and Ors 2010 (258) ELT 465 and 210(10)SC192 while dealing with Section 10B of the
Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 observed as under:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26990578/ 5
Lancor Holdings Limited vs The Assistant Commissioner (Ct) on 23 November, 2021
''10.Section 10 of the Act not only enumerates seven types of violations of the
provisions of the Act which constitute an ''offence'', it also makes them punishable by
prosecution and punishment, which ranges from simple imprisonment for a period,
which may extended to six months, or fine or both and in a case of continuous
offence, the Section provides for a daily fine. Section 10A of the Act provides for the
imposition of penalty in lieu of prosecution. It provides that if any person purchasing
goods in guilty of an offence under Clause (b) or Clause (c) or Clause (d) of Section 10
of the Act, a penalty of fine may be imposed. Thus, the violations enumerated in
Clause (b), Clause
(c) and Clause (d) of Section 10 may not necessarily result in prosecution with the
possible imposition of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.10401, 10406 &
10408 of 2020 sentence of imprisonment as an alternative is provided in respect of
these violations.
11.Therefore, what we are required to construe is whether the words ''falsely represents'' would cover
a mere incorrect representation or would embrace only such representations which have been made
knowingly, wilfully and intentionally.'' Ultimately the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the aforesaid case
held as under:-
''22.In view of the above, we are of the considered opinion that the use of the
expression ''falsely represents'' is indicative of the fact that the offence under Section
10(b) of the Act comes into existence only where a dealer acts deliberately in defiance
of law or is guilty of contumacious or dishonest conduct. Therefore, in proceedings
for levy of penalty under Section 10A of the Act, burden would be on the revenue to
prove the existence of circumstances constituting the said offence. Furthermore, it is
evident from the heading of Section 10A of the Act that for breach of any provision of
the Act, constituting an offence under Section 10 of the Act, ordinary remedy is
prosecution which may entail a sentence of imprisonment and the penalty under
Section 10A of the Act is only in lieu of prosecution. In light of the language employed
in the Section and the nature of penalty contemplated therein, we find it difficult to
hold that all types of omissions or https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.10401,
10406 & 10408 of 2020 commissions in the use of Form 'C' will be embraced in the
expression ''false representation''. In our opinion, therefore, a finding of mens rea is a
condition precedent for levying penalty under Section 10(b) read with Section 10A of
the Act.''
14.While passing the impugned order, the respondent had not considered these
decisions. The respondents ought to have been considered the bonafide of the
petitioner and whether by not obtaining/amending the Certificate of Registration in
Form B, the petitioner would have got any undue advantage while procuring goods
from a dealer the state of Karnataka. Merely because the petitioner had not amended
the C form during the period in dispute ipso facto does not justify a conclusion that
penalty under Section 10A of the Act can be imposed or the petitioner can prosecuted

Lancor Holdings Limited vs The Assistant Commissioner (Ct) on 23 November, 2021
under Section 11 of the Central Sales Tax Act.
15.Since the order is non speaking in nature, it is liable to be set aside and for fresh
consideration for passing appropriate orders as to whether the petitioner was indeed
liable to pay penalty under Section 10A of the Central Sales Tax Act. It is made clear
that the respondent https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.10401, 10406 &
10408 of 2020 can not venture to demand any tax from the petitioner contrary to the
provisions of the Central Sales Tax Act on the tax liability of the selling dealer from
Karnataka. Since the dispute pertains to the Assessment Years 2012-13 to 2014-15,
the respondent is directed to pass appropriate orders on merits and in accordance
with law keeping the above decisions of the Court in mind within a period of three
months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
16.According, these writ petitions stand allowed by way of remand with the above
observations. No costs. Consequently, connected miscellaneous petitions are closed.
