4. I have considered the submissions and perused the record.
5. It reveals from the perusal of the order sheets that the aforesaid case is pending at the stage of
appearance of opposite party nos. 2 to 7. They are not cooperating with the progress of the case. It
also appears that they are living at Maharashtra. It is reminded that the criminal Courts are never
toothless or powerless to ensure compliance of its own orders by the concerned police and
administrative authorities. They have got ample powers for the same under law itself. The trial court
is expected to invoke its power to ensure service of process upon the opposite party nos.2 to 7, which
is sent under its seal and order in order to procure his presence.
6. In the circumstances, the Court concerned is directed to invoke the powers given to it under law
to ensure the presence of the opposite party nos.2 to 7 by sending appropriate process to them
preferably within four months from the date of production of certified copy of this order before it
and thereafter all endeavours shall be made by it for expeditious disposal of the case, if there is no
legal impediment.
7. It is also made clear that the Court / Presiding Officer is not the only stake holder in the trial and
disposal of a case, hence, besides the P.O. concerned, all the stake holders i.e. police and executive
authorities, counsels, parties to the case, staff etc. are also made bound by this order and it will be
their responsibility also to assist the Court in every manner for the expeditious disposal of this case.
8. With the above observations, the application stands disposed of.
