. The prosecution case, is that the informant was married to respondent No. 3 approximately six
years before lodging of the FIR. When the informant came to her in-laws' house after wedding, her
husband and father-in-law started torturing and assaulting her for dowry for which the informant
filed a case, but on settlement, the accused took the informant back to their home. Their behavior
remained unchanged as they again demanded a motorcycle and fifty thousand rupees as dowry and
continued harassing her. On 21.09.2008, at approximately 10:00 AM, the informant's husband and
father-in-law brought poison in a bottle and told her to drink it. When the informant refused, the
accused started assaulting her. The informant's husband took a lorha and assaulted the informant's
cheeks and mouth with it and her father-in-law climbed on her chest and crushed her, on account of
which blood came out of the informant's mouth. The informant was screaming and at the same time
the accused persons put a towel around her neck and started Patna High Court CR. APP (DB)
No.1269 of 2019 dt.14-10-2025 pulling it. In the meanwhile, the informant's elder daughter started
crying at the door saying that people are killing her mother. The villagers came and dragged the
informant's husband and father-in-law out of the house. The husband also bit the informant's entire
body with his teeth. The villagers informed the informant's brother and he brought the informant to
Kudra police station where the informant submitted a written application on 22.09.2008.
4. On the basis of written statement of the informant, Kudra P.S. Case No. 101 of 2008 was
instituted under Sections 341, 323, 307, 498-A of the I.P.C. and Section 3 read with Section 4 of the
Dowry Prohibition Act and investigation was taken up by the police. The police after investigation
submitted charge-sheet against respondent Nos. 2 & 3 and, accordingly, cognizance was taken.
Thereafter the case was committed to the Court of Sessions. Charges were framed against the
accused persons to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.
5. During the trial, the prosecution examined altogether seven witnesses i.e. PW1- Punam Devi,
PW2- Subhadra Devi, PW3- Vikash Dubey, PW4- Tilakdhari Dubey, PW5- Ramashankar
Chaudhary, PW6- Dr. Sudarshan Singh and PW7- Dr. Ajay Pratap. The prosecution has also
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/2689069/ 2
Punam Devi @ Reena @ Reeta Devi vs The State Of Bihar on 14 October, 2025
produced certain Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.1269 of 2019 dt.14-10-2025 documents which
were marked as Exhibits, i.e. Ext. 1- Formal FIR, Ext. 2- Injury letter, Ext. 3- Injury report, Ext. 3/1-
Signature of doctor Ajay Pratap on the injury report, Ext. 4- Certified copy of charge-sheet of Mahila
P.S. Case No. 14 of 2012 and Ext. 5- Certified copy of charge-sheet of Kudra P.S. Case No. 54 of
2007. The defence has examined only one witness i.e. DW1- Wakil Pandey. After closure of
prosecution evidence, the statements of the accused persons were recorded under Section 313
Cr.P.C. and after conclusion of trial, learned trial court has acquitted the accused persons.
6. The learned trial court, on the basis of the materials available on record, and the evidence
produced before the court, acquitted the accused persons observing that the allegation of towel
being wrapped around the neck of the informant is not corroborated by the medical evidence. The
trial court has further observed that the prosecution witnesses have admitted in their
cross-examination that a settlement had been reached between the informant and the accused and
that there is no direct evidence of the accused demanding or accepting dowry and there is no
evidence on record that the accused had committed any act with intent to kill the informant.
7. Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.1269 of
2019 dt.14-10-2025 learned trial court has failed to consider the evidence of the prosecution
witnesses who have fully supported the prosecution case (for demand of dowry), but merely on the
ground of land dispute, the learned trial court has acquitted the accused persons. He further
submits that the learned trial court has not considered the actual facts and circumstances of the case
and due to minor contradiction in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses, acquitted the accused
persons.
8. The learned counsel for the respondent-State submits that there is no perversity in the judgment
of the learned trial court, and the prosecution had failed to prove the guilt of the accused before the
learned trial court. Therefore, the order of the learned trial court requires no interference in the
present case.
9. We have heard the counsel for the appellant and the respondent-State, and have also gone
through the records of the case.
10. The sole question that requires consideration by this Court is whether the impugned judgment of
acquittal requires any interference by this Court.
11. On an overall appraisal of the evidence on record, it is apparent that the prosecution has failed to
prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.

12. According to the prosecution, on 21.09.2008, the informant was allegedly assaulted by her
husband and father-in- law. The medical report prepared by Dr. Sudarshan Singh (PW-6) on
22.09.2008 revealed swelling near both eyes and the forehead, and a bruise on the cheek. There
was, however, no sign of the alleged pain in the body and chest, as stated by the informant. The
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/2689069/ 3
Punam Devi @ Reena @ Reeta Devi vs The State Of Bihar on 14 October, 2025
Doctor opined that all injuries were simple injuries caused by a hard and blunt object.
13. It further appears from the record that the informant subsequently underwent a second medical
examination at Sadar Hospital, where she was admitted from 22.09.2008 to 01.10.2008, though no
medical justification for this repeated check-up is recorded. Both medical reports indicate only
simple injuries without any internal damage. Additionally, the second medical report states that the
informant had sustained injuries on 20.09.2008, as per her own statement to the doctor. This
discrepancy raises reasonable doubt regarding the precise date and time of the alleged offence.
14. Court Witness-1, the daughter of the informant, stated that she saw her father and grandfather
forcibly attempting to put poison into her mother's mouth, which allegedly spilled. She further
claimed that her father beaten her mother with a Lorha, Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.1269 of
2019 dt.14-10-2025 her grandfather kicked her mother's chest, and both wrapped a towel around
her mother's neck and started pulling. However, several material inconsistencies arise. She did not
show the police the place where the poison allegedly spilled, and no seizure of any object or
substance relating to poison was made by the police. The alleged assault was claimed to have lasted
approximately ten minutes, yet medical evidence shows only simple external injuries near the eyes
and cheek, with no blood, no internal injuries, and nothing to indicate strangulation by a towel. The
testimony is vague regarding the sequence of events and the role of each accused and is not
corroborated by any independent witness.
15. Furthermore, PW-2, PW-3, and PW-4, namely, the mother, brother, and father of the informant,
deposed that they were not eye-witnesses to the alleged occurrence, and nothing material regarding
the alleged demand of dowry was stated by them. Therefore, offence under Section 3 read with
Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act cannot be sustained.
16. The conduct of the informant during the investigation and trial further weakens the prosecution
case. Despite alleging physical assault, she did not immediately seek medical aid, and her first
examination took place a day later. Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.1269 of 2019 dt.14-10-2025
Thereafter, she obtained another medical report from a different hospital without explanation. More
importantly, during her deposition before the Court, the informant herself stated that the matter
had been compromised between the parties and that she did not wish to proceed further against the
accused persons. Such statement, being voluntary and unequivocal, reflects that the dispute was
essentially matrimonial in nature, and that the complainant herself no longer supports the
prosecution case. In Narinder Singh and Others v. State of Punjab and Another reported in (2014) 6
SCC 466, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that in cases arising out of matrimonial discord where
parties have amicably settled, continuation of criminal proceedings would serve no useful purpose,
as observed in para 29 onwards of the judgment which reads as under:
"....29.2. When the parties have reached the settlement and on that basis petition for
quashing the criminal proceedings is filed, the guiding factor in such cases would be
to secure:
(i) ends of justice, or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/2689069/ 4
Punam Devi @ Reena @ Reeta Devi vs The State Of Bihar on 14 October, 2025
(ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any court.
While exercising the power the High Court is to form an opinion on either of the aforesaid two
objectives.
...
29.4. On the other hand, those criminal cases having overwhelmingly and predominantly civil Patna
High Court CR. APP (DB) No.1269 of 2019 dt.14-10-2025 character, particularly those arising out of
commercial transactions or arising out of matrimonial relationship or family disputes should be
quashed when the parties have resolved their entire disputes among themselves...."
17. Upon cumulative consideration, it emerges that the timing of compromise and resumption of
cohabitation is not proved; medical evidence is inconsistent and lacks credibility; testimony of the
daughter (Court Witness-1) is not corroborated by any independent witness; and the informant
herself has declared compromise and unwillingness to pursue prosecution.
18. In such circumstances, this Court finds that the prosecution has failed to establish the guilt of the
accused beyond reasonable doubt.
19. For the reasons discussed above, this Court holds that the prosecution has not been able to prove
the charge against the accused persons beyond reasonable doubt. The inconsistencies in medical
evidence, absence of independent corroboration, and the express statement of compromise by the
informant together create serious doubt regarding the prosecution version.
20. We find that the findings recorded by the learned Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.1269 of
2019 dt.14-10-2025 Trial Court do not suffer from any illegality and perversity. In a criminal case, it
is incumbent upon the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused beyond the shadow of all
reasonable doubts. Wherever, any doubt is cast upon the case of the prosecution, the accused is
entitled to the benefit of doubt.
21. In criminal appeal against acquittal what the Appellate Court has to examine is whether the
finding of the learned court below is perverse and prima facie illegal. Once the Appellate Court
comes to the finding that the grounds on which the judgment is based is not perverse, the scope of
appeal against acquittal is limited considering the fact that the legal presumption about the
innocence of the accused is further strengthened by the finding of the Court. At this point, it is
imperative to consider the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Mrinal Das vs. State
of Tripura (2011) 9 SCC 479, paragraphs 13 & 14 of which read as under:
"13. It is clear that in an appeal against acquittal in the absence of perversity in the
judgment and order, interference by this Court exercising its extraordinary
jurisdiction, is not warranted. However, if the appeal is heard by an appellate court, it
being the final court of fact, is fully competent to reappreciate, reconsider and review
the evidence and take its own decision. In other words, the law does not prescribe any
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/2689069/ 5
Punam Devi @ Reena @ Reeta Devi vs The State Of Bihar on 14 October, 2025
limitation, restriction or condition on exercise Patna High Court CR. APP (DB)
No.1269 of 2019 dt.14-10-2025 of such power and the appellate court is free to arrive
at its own conclusion keeping in mind that acquittal provides for presumption in
favour of the accused. The presumption of innocence is available to the person and in
criminal jurisprudence every person is presumed to be innocent unless he is proved
guilty by the competent court. If two reasonable views are possible on the basis of the
evidence on record, the appellate court should not disturb the findings of acquittal.
14. There is no limitation on the part of the appellate court to review the evidence
upon which the order of acquittal is found and to come to its own conclusion. The
appellate court can also review the conclusion arrived at by the trial court with
respect to both facts and law. While dealing with the appeal against acquittal
preferred by the State, it is the duty of the appellate court to marshal the entire
evidence on record and only by giving cogent and adequate reasons set aside the
judgment of acquittal. An order of acquittal is to be interfered with only when there
are "compelling and substantial reasons" for doing so. If the order is "clearly
unreasonable", it is a compelling reason for interference.........."
22. In the case of Ghurey Lal versus State of Uttar Pradesh reported in (2008) 10 SCC 450 in
paragraph 75, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed as under:
"75. The trial Court has the advantage of watching the demeanour of the witnesses
who have given evidence, therefore, the appellate court should be slow to interfere
with the decisions of the trial court. An acquittal by the Patna High Court CR. APP
(DB) No.1269 of 2019 dt.14-10-2025 trial court should not be interfered with unless it
is totally perverse or wholly unsustainable."
23. Thus, an order of acquittal is to be interfered with only for compelling and substantial reasons.
In case, if the order is clearly unreasonable, it is a compelling reason for interference. But where
there is no perversity in the finding of the impugned judgment of acquittal, the Appellate Court must
not take a different view only because another view is possible. It is because the trial Court has the
privilege of seeing the demeanour of witnesses and, therefore, its decision must not be upset in
absence of strong and compelling grounds.
24. In view of the above, we do not find any illegality and perversity in the findings recorded by the
Trial Court.
25. Accordingly, the present appeal is dismissed.
26. Pending application(s), if any, also stands disposed of.
