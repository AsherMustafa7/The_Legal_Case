Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
3. The case of the petitioner in E.P.No.1/2019 is that the Election Commission of India (hereinafter
referred to as 'Election Commission of India') issued a notification on 12.1.2019 appointing the
Deputy Commissioner, Hassan as Returning Officer to 16- Hassan Parliamentary Constituency and
the Returning Officer issued a notification on 19.3.2019 publishing the calendar of events by calling
upon the contestants to file nominations along with affidavit in Form No.26 as per the dates
prescribed as follows:-
(i) Election Notification dated 11.3.2019
(ii) Date of commencement of 19.3.2019 nomination
(iii) Last of date for filing 26.3.2019 nomination
(iv) Date of scrutiny nomination 27.3.2019
(v) Date of withdrawal of 29.3.2019 nomination
(vi) Date of polling 18.4.2019
(vii) Date of counting 23.5.2019
(viii) Date of declaration of result 23.5.2019
4. The election was conducted by the Returning Officer appointed by ECI namely, one Akram Pasha
and subsequently one Priyanka Mary Francis was replaced as Returning Officer and Deputy
Commissioner of Hassan. It is alleged that the petitioner is the voter of Hanayalu village,
Ramanathapura Hobli, Arakalagudu Taluk, Hassan District, within the parliamentary constituency
of Hassan and his name is found in part No.278 at Sl.No.405 and he has filed nomination to contest
the election. He has filed the nomination paper along with the affidavit Form No.26. The respondent
No.1 has filed his nomination paper along with affidavit in Form No.26 to contest the Hassan
parliamentary constituency sponsored by Janata Dal Secular Party (hereinafter referred to as 'JDS')
on 22.2.2019 at 12.35 p.m. Apart from the petitioner and respondent No.1, the respondent Nos.2 to
5 are the local/regional parties, who also contested, but not serious contestants in real terms. It is
further alleged that the counting was held on 23.5.2019. The petitioner secured 5,35,282 votes,
whereas respondent No.1 secured 6,76,606 votes. The votes secured by respondent No.1 were not
the valid votes. The Returning Officer has declared the respondent No.1 as duly elected, to fill the
seat for 16 Hassan parliamentary constituency on 23.5.2019. It is further contended that the
Election Commissioner called the information in prescribed affidavit Form No.26 by exercising
power under Article 324 of Constitution of India, to furnish the information relating to candidates,
their assets including movable, immovable, bank balance etc., of the candidates as well as the spouse
and the dependents.
5. The petitioner further alleged that calling information in the affidavit Form No.26 by the ECI is to
provide to the knowledge of every voter who has elementary right to know full particulars of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128202297/ 9
Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
candidates who intends to represent him in the parliament and such right to get information is
universally recognized and to know the candidate is a natural right flowing from the concept of
democracy. It is an integral part of Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India. Therefore, the
candidate is bound to provide the necessary and all information at the time of filing nomination
paper. The nomination paper is liable to be rejected, if it is incomplete information, tantamount to
mis-representation, suppressing the material information in the affidavit, which would be treated as
a defect of substantial character by Returning Officer. It is the duty of Returning Officer to check
whether the information required is fully furnished and non- furnishing of the required information,
would amount to falsehood or suppression/non-disclosure which amounts to suppression of
material information relating to the candidate and it also amounts to nullify the very foundation of
voters exercise of choice and vitiating the purity of the election process.
6. The petitioner further contended that the respondent No.1 is guilty of non-disclosure of
information pertaining to partnership firm M/s. Adhikarah Ventures LLP and M/s. Dhrone
Workforce LLP owned by him as partner for 20% and 25%.
7. It is further contended that, as on the date of filing this affidavit on 22.3.2019, the respondent
No.1 declared his assets and liabilities, bank balance, movable and immovable properties.
Immediately, the petitioner filed the objection before the Returning Officer against willful
suppression of assets, movable and immovable properties including, bank balances, but the
Returning Officer accepted the nomination paper of the respondent No.1, by rejecting the objection
of the petitioner on the ground of 6.10 (iv) of Returning Officer's directory. Upon considering the
objection filed against respondent No.1, the ECI, designated an officer to hold an enquiry, but the
designated officer failed to take any decision against the respondent No.1. The very purpose of
issuing guidelines issued by ECI to submit affidavit in form No. 26 would be defeated, if such
affidavits are accepted. Therefore, accepting of the nomination filed by respondent No.1 is bad in
law.
8. The petitioner further submitted that non furnishing of the required information would amount
to falsehood, suppression/non-disclosure, hence the respondent No.1 is guilty of:-
a) Non-disclosure of information regarding partnership of M/s. Adhikarah Ventures
LLP and M/s. Dhrone Workforce LLP,
b) The income tax returns to be filed for 5 last financial year but not filed any income
tax returns but he has filed income tax returns only for the assessment year 2018-19,
even though he is having huge amount of income and self acquired properties worth
crores from 2008 till 2018,
c) The respondent No.1 despite not owning any title but he has declared he is owner
of the land in Sy.No.16/3, 17/2 and 13/2 of Bhavinkere village kasaba hobli
Nelamangala, and in Sy.No.3/1 and 3/3 of Srirampura village Mysore Taluk,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128202297/ 10
Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
d) The respondent No.1 has wrongly shown the market value of the immovable
properties situated at Bhavinkere village in respect of item No.1 to 8 properties No.E.
The affidavit of the respondent No.1 was verified in column no.7(b) (2) non
agricultural land in respect of Chennambika Convention Hall is a partner which is a
commercial building but he has invested the money in the land but he has mentioned
as nil and he has misled the public at large,
e) The respondent misled the public by declaring that he had huge amount of loan
from his father Sri.H.D Revanna for Rs.1,26,36,000/- but the H.D. Revanna has
declared before the Registrar of Lokayuktha where in his affidavit stated he has given
loan to his son for Rs.47,36,000/-,
f) The respondent No.1 filed Income Tax return on the very same day of filing
affidavit on 26.2.2019 by showing his address at Padmanabhanagar, Bengaluru,
g) The respondent No.1 filed returns for the assessment year as belated return under
139 (4) of Income Tax Act which applies to individuals having income to be returned
under the head of profits and gains from the business but he has suppressed his
business interest in the firms,
h) The respondent No.1 shown the income from business of Rs.7,48,442/-and he has
conceded the true fact of his source of income in the affidavit,
i) The respondent No.1 mis-calculated the total income and he has avoided the tax to
the authorities for the previous years and he is guilty of dues to the Government,
j) The respondent No.1 declared before the Income tax authority by mentioning the
business and share in the firm in including the Chennambika Convention Hall but he
has shown the false affidavit,
k) The petitioner learnt the income of Rs.7,48,842/- was under the head of business
but he has not furnished the actual figures in respect of the business in Form No.26,
l) The respondent No.1 filed income tax return of the assessment year 2018-19
without disclosing income for previous year including the interest earned from
Chennambika Convention Hall therefore he is guilty of non disclosing the income
from the Chennambika Convention Hall,
m) The respondent No.1 is guilty of not maintaining the books of accounts as per
Section 44 AA (2),(i)(ii) of IT Act,
n) The respondent No.1 shown bank balance as on 22.3.2019 at Karnataka Bank
Minerva Circle Branch, Bengaluru in the affidavit as Rs.5,78,238/- but as per the
bank balance it was Rs.49,09,583/-,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128202297/ 11
Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
o) The respondent No.1 received Rs.50 lakhs from Kuppareddy as Rajya Sabha
Member through his bank account at Minerva circle branch but he has not disclosed.
9. It is further alleged by the petitioner that the information furnished by respondent No.1 were
suppressed and not disclosed various information in the nomination paper. Therefore the
nomination of the respondent No.1 was liable to be rejected and consequently, his election is liable
to be declared as null and void. It is further alleged that the nomination of respondent No.1 is only
lip service and there is no evidence at all, therefore, his nomination is liable to be held invalid. It is
further alleged that the details are furnished in respect of asset / business and possessed by each
candidate separately, but the respondent No.1 has mislead by suppressing the investments in bonds,
debentures and shares. There is corresponding duty on part of respondent No.1 to disclose truthful
and correct information regarding the assets, both movable and immovable including bank balance,
therefore, non disclosure of assets in his nomination, is held as invalid. It is further contended the
Returning Officer failed to exercise his statutory duties but wrongly accepted the nomination of the
respondent No.1. Therefore, prayed for allowing the petition as prayed for.
10. The respondent No.1 appeared through the counsel and filed written objections by denying all
the allegations made in the petition against the respondent No.1, as false except the respondent
specifically admitted some of the averments and other averments are not admitted and the
petitioner is put to strict proof of the same.
11. The respondent has contended that he secured 6,76,606 votes and declared as elected candidate
on 23.5.2019 and all the votes are the valid votes and he has duly filled all the instructions printed in
the Proforma Form No.26. The contention of the petitioner is that every voter has right to know the
full particulars of the candidate who represent them in the parliamentary election be true but other
contentions are false. The paragraph 9 of the petition is figment of imaginations and the Returning
Officer not expected and permitted to conduct a rowing enquiry on the affidavit filed in Form No.26.
The contention in paragraph 10 is denied as false. The averments in paragraph 11 regarding partners
in the firms-M/s. Adhikarah Ventures LLP, M/s. Dhrone Workforce LLP, is not correct. The
respondent was no more partner, he was already resigned from the firm on 19.3.2019 and the firm
has accepted his resignation by resolution which was forwarded to the Registrar of Companies,
therefore the contention of the petitioner that the respondent No.1 was partner of the firms, is not
correct. The averments in the petition in paragraph 12 is the matter of record. The contention in
paragraph 13 regarding filing of his objection, before the Returning Officer may be true, but the
other contentions are not true. The contentions in paragraphs 14 and 15 are not admitted. The
Returning Officer is justified in rejecting the objection of the petitioner and accepted the
nomination. The contention in paragraph 16 is not admitted. The respondent has not suppressed
any material facts and has not left any blank spaces in the affidavit.
12. It is further objected by respondent No.1 that paragraphs 17A, 17B, 17C of the petition are denied.
The respondent has furnished the information sought at Sl.No.4, part A of the Form No.26 that
candidate should have filed IT returns for previous 5 financial years. The respondent correctly
declared his IT returns and further contended that he has purchased the land in Sy.No.16/3, 17/2

Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
Srirampura village, it was typographical error that the land in Sy.No.3/2 but wrongly typed as
Sy.No.3/1 and the land in Sy.No.3/3 is inherited through 'Will' executed by his grand mother Smt.
Nagarathnamma on 04.12.2009. It is further contended that the land in Sy.Nos.13/1, 17/1 and 16/3
reflects the erstwhile owner of the land and they have sold those properties in favour of the
respondent, but the encumbrance were reflecting in the name of the erstwhile owner. Further
contended that he has furnished approximate current market value of those properties and the
guidance value fixed by the authorities for the purpose of stamp duty. It is further contended that
the Chennambika Convention Hall belongs to a firm and he has mentioned the same in the affidavit
Form No.26 and further denied that in the financial year 2017-18, he has availed loan from his
father Sri. H.D. Revanna and he has mentioned in the nomination paper. The IT returns filed by him
is not within the scope of the election petition, even otherwise, the respondent is earning income
and interest from the firm, the same was declared in IT returns and his affidavit. He further
contended that the allegations made in the paragraph 17 and sub-paragraphs are all false and
contended that the respondent has furnished Bank balance available as on the date of filing the
nomination by obtaining the account for the period from 31.12.2006 to 7.3.2019 and the receipt of
Rs.50 lakhs as loan from Kuppendra Reddy, which was transferred on 11.3.2019 and the same was
not intimated to the respondent. Subsequent to filing of the nomination paper, the respondent came
to know the amount received by him and further denied paragraph 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 32 as false and
further admitted that the interpretation given by the petitioner in respect of judgment of courts in
paragraph-33 is partially correct and further denied the paragraphs 34 to 37 as false and contended
that the respondent never suppressed any information in his affidavit and he has not violated any
provisions of the Act. Therefore, he has contended the petition is devoid of merits and liable to be
dismissed.
13. The respondent also further contended that the contention of the petitioner in accepting the
nomination of the respondent has materially affected the result of the Returning candidate under
Section 100(1)(d)(i) of R.P. Act is untenable and there is no violation of provision of Sections 33A,
33B and Section 100(1)(d)(iv) of R.P. Act and the contention of the petitioner in paragraph 38 to 45
are untenable and not admitted. It is further contended that prayer (a) of the petition cannot be
granted as the petitioner has not made out prima facie case, the prayer (b) also cannot be granted as
the affidavit filed by the respondent does not suffer from any infirmities. The Election Petition is not
required to be entertained by this court as the petition itself is not maintainable in the earlier
paragraphs of the objections.
14. It is further contended that the Election petition suffers from non-compliance of Section 81(3) of
R.P. Act which is as under:-
i. The election petition served to the respondent is not signed by the petitioner as well
as his Advocate as true copy.
ii. The advocate of the petitioner has put his signature at page no.34 to 37, 40, 42, 49
to 64, 66 to 77, 79 to 81, 83 to 86, 88 to 97, 100, 105 to 107, 110, 113, 116, 118 to 120,
122 to 127, 131, 133 to 136, 138, 140, 141, 142, 144, 145, 147 to 151, 155 to 158, 160 to

Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
iii. The advocate for the petitioner has not signed on the documents page Nos.128 and 129, iv. The
petitioner has alleged the respondent is guilty of corrupt practice but has not filed the affidavit in the
format prescribed in Form No.25 which is mandatory under the Act and Rules. The documents
produced by the petitioner in Annexure 'G' and 'H' are tampered one and contended that the
respondent not suppressed any material facts in Form No.26 which does not suffers any infirmities
and no false information filed by the respondent hence prayed for dismissing the petition as no case
made out by the petitioner.
15. The respondent No.1 in EP.No.1/2019 also filed Recrimination Petition under Section 97 of R.P.
Act alleging that the petitioner has sought for declaration before this court that the election of the
respondent to be declared as null and void. That this respondent has filed false affidavit and also
sought the petitioner be declared as duly elected for having secured the 2nd highest vote and he has
contended that assuming without admitting the same, the petitioner is not entitled for relief of
declaration that he should be declared as elected, because the petitioner also indulged in corrupt
practice. It is further contended that the petitioner has filed false affidavit in Form No.26, he also
suppressed the material fact regarding declaration of his income and his wife's income and pending
criminal cases against him. The petitioner also contested from Arakalagudu constituency of
Assembly election on 12.5.2018 by declaring his income as Rs.11,85,18,249/- and his wife's income
as Rs.10,49,88,112/- in part B of the affidavit, but in the Lok Sabha election, he has mentioned his
income and wife's income as Rs.12,04,322/- and Rs.22,06,488/- respectively for the assessment
year 2018-19. He further contended that a criminal case has been filed against him which was
pending before the Hassan Court for the offence punishable under Section 188 of IPC and an appeal
was pending before the High Court in W.P.No.16510/2018 which was not declared by him and he
has a filed false affidavit by showing two different annual income for the same financial year and
same is contradictory to the Section 33A of the R.P. Act. He has further submitted that Section 100
of R.P. Act enumerates the ground for declaring the election to be void, with a specific ground that if
by improper acceptance of any nomination, result of the election has been materially affected and as
per clause (d)(iv) non compliance with provisions of Constitution or Act and Rules, the petitioner is
guilty of furnishing wrong information and suppressing the material information. The jurisdictional
police registered FIR against him, which is pending before the JMFC, Arakalagudu in Crime
No.64/2019 and while canvassing for the petitioner with the knowledge and consent of the
petitioner an Ex. MLA H.M. Vishwanath issued the statement regarding the name of the caste and
religion and there is clear violation under Section 123(3) of the R.P. Act. Another case has been
registered in Crime No.65/2019, the election agent also filed before the District Election Office along
with the newspaper cutting, the petitioner also influenced the voters in a meeting on 5.4.2019. A
case has been registered in Crime No.62/2019, another case registered in Crime No.66/2019 for
seizing Rs.2 lakhs in a car along with the badges and pamphlets of BJP. Another case was registered
in Crime No.34/2019 for carrying the caps and T-shirts with symbol of BJP in a car. The petitioner
has willfully violated the code of conduct and the petitioner also indulged in making a false
allegation against the JDS leaders. The petitioner has misused the official machinery and indulged
in corrupt practice as enumerated under Section 100 of the R.P. Act. Hence, the petitioner is not
entitled for declaring himself as elected and hence, prayed for rejection of the prayer of the petition.

Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
16. The petitioner in E.P.No.1/2019 filed objections to the Recrimination petition, contending that
regarding the allegation of corrupt practice, the Recrimination petition itself is liable to be dismissed
in limine for non compliance of Rule 94-A of Conduct of Election Rules as the recrimination petition
does not contain the affidavit in Form No.25. As regards to the non disclosure of pendency of
criminal cases, the allegations are unfounded, except one case in Crime No.171/2018 and the said
case was stayed by the High Court in Writ petition and there is no other cases at the time of filing
the nomination and other cases were registered subsequent to the filing of the nomination.
Therefore, the said contention is not tenable. It is further contended that so far as discrepancies in
declaration of income of the assessment year 2017-18, the petitioner has shown different income
due to increase of the income to the extent of Rs.18,43,073/-. It is further contended that the
fairness in the conduct of the petitioner in promptly showing the higher income deserves to be
appreciated and likewise, the two affidavits in respect of income of his wife differs and both the
figures are correct. The two forms filed by the petitioner in the Recrimination petition confirms the
petitioner's explanation regarding the reason for changing in the figure. The amount has been
declared before the income tax authorities. Therefore, the petitioner is entitled for relief to be
declared as elected in the place of respondent No.1. Hence prayed for dismissing the Recrimination
petition as not maintainable.
17. The respondent No.2 also filed statement of objection stating that he has contested the Hassan
parliamentary election from Bahujan Samajwadi Party and he has lost the election. The respondent
No.1 was declared as returned candidate, as per Rule 4A of which mandates furnishing information
in Form No.26. The respondent No.1 has not disclosed the information pertaining to the partnership
firm, namely M/s. Adhikarah Ventures LLP and M/s. Dhrone Workforce LLP were the partner
holding 20% and 25% respectively, and he withheld the information and given false declaration and
misleading information. Therefore, the respondent No.1 is guilty of non disclosure, misleading and
furnishing the false information to ECI which amounts to corrupt practice, hence the election of
respondent No.1 as returned candidate should be declared as null and void. Hence, prayed for
allowing the petition.
18. The respondent No.3 also filed the written statement stating that he is a voter in
Honnashettihalli village Chennarayapatna Taluk, he was sponsored by Uttama Prajakiya Party and
contested the election and lost. He also contended the respondent No.1 suppressed the material fact,
given false declaration in respect of assets and liabilities including the bank balances. Therefore, it is
contended that respondent No.1 is guilty of dishonest, non-disclosure, misleading and furnishing
the false information to the ECI, hence he also prayed for declaring the election of the respondent
No.1 as null and void.
19. The respondent No.5 also filed written statement by adopting the statement filed by the
respondent No.1 and contended that the Election petition is not maintainable and liable to be
dismissed for non-compliance of mandatory provisions of Sections 81 and 83 of the R.P. Act. He
also denied the contentions in the election petition and he has almost supported the respondent
No.1 and prayed for dismissing the election petition.
20. Based upon the pleading, the following issues has been framed by this court on 27.5.2022:

submitting that his name finds place at Sl.No.301 in part No.001, in Booth No.240 at Kamasamudra
village and he is an Ex-Karnataka Development Inspection Committee member of Hassan District
and also Ex-General Secretary of KPCC. He is an advocate and social worker and working for cause
of justice. Even in the parliamentary election, he has actively participated in support of Congress
Candidate sponsored by the Congress party. But after a few days, election was announced for
Hassan parliamentary constituency. At that time the JD(S) and Indian National Congress have

Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
23. The petitioner herein calling in question the declaration of the result of the respondent No.1
under Section 100(1)(b), (d)(i), (d)(ii), (iii) and (iv) of R.P. Act. The petitioner has also challenged
the declaration of respondent No.1 as void but also challenged the commission of various corrupt
practices by respondent No.1 under Sections 123(A)(b), 123(B)(b), 123(2)(b), 123(3), 123(3A),
123(6), 123(7)(a), 123(7)(d)(h) and 123(8) of R.P. Act.
24. It is alleged by the petitioner that respondent No.1 has filed the nomination before the Returning
Officer under Section 33 of the R.P. Act and the Returning Officer was bound to satisfy himself after
verifying the electoral roles, but the Returning Officer ignored the requirement contemplated under
Section 33(a) of the R.P. Act that the candidate who is contesting the election has to submit Form
No.26 and the Form No. 26(A) has to be sworn in by an affidavit in accordance with law. But after
going through the affidavit of the respondent No.1, it was brought to the notice of officer that the
Form No.26 filed by the respondent no.1 was not in accordance with the law. But the Returning
Officer accepted the same, inspite of objections without considering the questions raised by
respondent No.2. It is also contended that Form No.26 suffers from non disclosure of material
requirements regarding assets, liabilities, bank balance, which is substantial in nature. Respondent
No.1 also invested in two partnership firms, which were not declared by him.
25. The petitioner further stated that in Form No.26, the liabilities and the loans required to be
mentioned, whereas the respondent has taken loan from 16 persons including his father, mother
and relatives but he has not properly declared. He has declared that he has borrowed loan from his
father for Rs.1,26,36,000/- as per his father's declaration before the Lokayuktha, but the respondent
No.1 declared only Rs.74,00,000/-. There is difference of Rs.52,36,000/-. Likewise, the loan
borrowed from his mother was Rs.43,75,000/- but payment is only Rs.30,00,000/-. There is a
difference of Rs.13,75,000/- and there is no declaration before the Income Tax Department.
26. The petitioner further contended that the balance in the account at Karnataka Bank, Minerva
Circle branch was Rs.49,09,583/- but, he has declared only Rs.5,78,238/- and there is difference of
Rs.43,31,344/-. Therefore, the declaration made by respondent No.1 is false. It is further contended
at column No.11 of Part B of affidavit Form No.26, that he has declared a sum of Rs.4,89,15,029/-
and that it has been paid through RTGS DD for purchase of agricultural land, by borrowing loan
from his father, but his father declared before the Lokayuktha that he has paid loan only for
Rs.47,36,000/-. Therefore, there is difference of Rs.79 lakhs and hence, the said declaration is also
false. It is further contended that the respondent No.1 declared some of the landed property at
Bhavinkere, Nelamangala Taluk are belonging to him but some of the properties were not standing
in his name, therefore, there are difference in the properties as per the sale deed. Therefore, the
declaration was false and some of the properties belonging to Government and declaring the said
properties as his property, amounts to land grabbing and punishable under the penal offences.
27. The petitioner further stated there were sale deeds in respect of two survey Nos. 16/2 and 17/1
and in respect of survey Nos.16/3, 17/2 and 13/2 of Bhavinkere village, said to be belonging to him,
but the record speaks some thing else, his name was not shown in those documents. Therefore, the
said declaration is false. Further it is contended that so far as Sy.No.17/2 belonging to one
Siddananjappa, a litigation was pending in O.S.No.482/2015 and O.S.No.326/2011 which are still
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128202297/ 18
Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
pending. Therefore, his name is not reflecting in the revenue records, therefore his declaration is
false. Further contended, in respect of Sy.No.3/1 of Srirampura village, the property belongs to one
Maramma, wife of Nanjaiah, but the respondent declared as owner and similarly in respect of
Sy.No.3/3 of Srirampura village he has declared, that it belongs to him, but it shows in the name of
Nagarathnamma. As per Form No.26, he has stated that he is the owner of 5 survey properties but it
does not belong to him. Therefore, it is a false declaration which attracts corrupt practice under
Section 123 (2) of R.P. Act.
28. The petitioner further contended that while filing the nomination, he filed Form No.26, the
same is not in accordance with Section 33A of R.P. Act and Rule 4A of Conduct of Election Rules
and if it is not in conformity within the prescribed form, the Returning Officer is bound to reject the
nomination paper. But the Returning Officer has failed to do so. Therefore, considering the
information, non-filing the correct information amounts to corrupt practice under Section 123(2) of
R.P. Act.
29. The petitioner filed a complaint to the Election Commission when the nomination of respondent
was accepted, the said complaint was forwarded to the ECI and the result is awaited. Further
submits, in part A and B, the PAN number of income tax required to be furnished but he has not
furnished. There is a difference in the amount disclosed by him, the same amounts to
non-disclosure, suppression and concealment of different items which are as under:-
i. The respondent No.1 lent loan to his brother Suraj in a sum of Rs.37,20,000/- but
that is not correct, but has lent loan of Rs.76,00,000/-
through Karnataka Bank, ii. He has declared he is the owner of land in Sy.No.16/3 of
Bhavinkere village and owner of Sy.No.17/2 but his name is not find place in the
revenue records, iii. The Assistant Commissioner, Doddaballapura have passed order
on 29.4.2011 in LRF SR(L) 19/2009-10 regarding Sy.No.16/3 which belongs to
Government, but the respondent declared the said land belongs to him and he has
declared the value of the property as Rs.5,77,50,000/- crores but the actual value is
11.55 crores hence his declaration is false.
iv. In respect of Chennambika
Convention Hall he has shown
Rs.14,66,666/- in the said site there was a construction of hall and as per the building
license and photograph the investment is not less than Rs.5 crore and his earning is
Rs.8 lakhs as rental income which was not disclosed. It is further alleged, the High
Court has passed an order on 16.10.2012 in W.P.No.38127/2012 (LB RES -PIL) to the
DC for demolition of the convention hall. The said land said to be gifted by his father
Revanna to the respondent No.1 and he himself and his brother had constructed and
the cost would be more than Rs.5 crore but it is not declared. Therefore, his
declaration is false, v. As per the Income Tax Act the amount derived which exceeds
the slab, then he has declared in his returns but he has not declared in the income tax
returns and he has filed IT returns only in Assessment year 2918-19 but not filed any
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128202297/ 19
Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
IT returns from 2014 to 2017. He bound to show the income for first five years but
which is not declared and as per the information gathered by the petitioner an
amount of Rs.1,88,68,368/- has come to his SB account at Minerva Circle Branch as
per the discounting of 41 bills from Government department which has not been
declared. The respondent No.2 also filed complaint to the IT department to hold an
enquiry regarding bills received and encashed by the respondent No.1, vi. The
respondent No.1 is guilty of non disclosure of investments in M/s.
Adhikarah Ventures LLP and M/s. Dhrone Workforce LLP to the extent of 20% and
25% respectively and as per the data in public domain uphold on 24.6.2019 that he is
retired from the said companies. Therefore, as on the date of filing nomination he is
partner of the said two companies which were not disclosed, vii. As per the affidavit
he has declared the balance in his account at Minerva circle branch Karnataka bank
was Rs.5,78,238/- but as on the day of filing nomination the amount was
Rs.49,09,583/- and there is difference of Rs.43,31,345/- hence his declaration is false
and further contended he has lent loan of Rs.37,00,000/- to his brother but he has
actually lent Rs.76,00,000/-
therefore his statement is incorrect and as per the Income Tax Act, he has transferred the said
amount through online, therefore it is an offence under Section 269 SS and 269(T) of IT Act.
30. The petitioner further contended that there is gross violation narrated above. It is clear in Form
No.26 that he has declared all false information, suppression of material facts which amounts to
defect of substantial character, hence nomination should have been rejected and the non disclosure
as per the Section 33A of R.P. Act and Rule 4A of conduct of Election Rules which declaration were
contrary to the said provisions and further contended that under Section 100(1)(b) read with Section
100(1)(d)(2) of R.P. Act, he has suppressed all the material facts which amounts to violation under
R.P. Act. The petitioner further contended that under Human and Civil Right contemplated under
International Covenants and Civil and Political Rights, 1966 read with Article 19 of Constitution of
India, disclosure of information in the affidavit and guidelines issued by the Election Commission in
2006 amounts to violation of Sections 33 to 36 and 100(1)(d)(i)(iv) of R.P. Act and election is liable
to be set aside. It is further submitted that, the material information regard to assets not only lacks
in correctness and particulars, but suffers from non disclosure of interest. The Returning Officer at
the time of scrutiny is not bound to go into details, but in the instant case, he ought to have gone
into the details as there were glaring and patent and supported by public documents. Further it is
contended that the facts narrated regarding non compliance of law under Section 33 of R.P. Act and
Rule 4A of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961 amounts to corrupt practice of undue influence
within the meaning of Section 123(2) of R.P. Act. Hence, the election of respondent No.1 is liable to
be set aside.
31. The petitioner further contended that the respondent committed corrupt practice of bribery as
contemplated under Section 123 (1) A and B of R.P. Act which reads as under:-

has acquired properties from 2009-10 when he was hardly 18 years and a student and having no

returning candidate is void. The respondent No.2 having been duly elected under Section 101 of the
R.P. Act and the respondent No.1 by giving false affidavit suffers from disqualification. Therefore,
the votes secured by him has to be declared as invalid votes and thrown away votes and to declare
the respondent No.2 as elected and secured 5,35,232 valid votes and hence the result and
declaration of election dated 23.5.2019 so far as the respondent No.1 is concerned, who is the

objections by denying all the allegations made against him as false and contentions in Paragraph
Nos. III, IV, V, VII and VIII and not admitted and paragraph No.9 is partly admitted in respect of

paragraph Nos. XI, XII, XIII as false and contended that he has not committed any corrupt practice
and he has complied all the provision and rules and further denied the contentions that the
Returning Officer ignored the requirement under Section 33 of R.P. Act as false. He has furnished
all the details including the investments, bank balances, and he was not partner in the firms as he
was already resigned from the firm. He further denied the averments in respect of loan borrowed

contended that he has obtained the bank statement till end of February 2019 and he has requested

come under PWD minister and therefore, question of diverting the fund by his father does not arise.

community belongs to Lingayath and therefore it does not fall under the corrupt practice under
Section 123 of the R.P. Act. The respondent already filed details in the election expenses which was

printing the pamphlets. The details of election expenses sent to appropriate authority were accepted.

42. The election petition suffers from non compliance of Sections 81(3) and 83 of the Act which
deserved to be rejected at the threshold in view of the provisions contained in Rule 94(A) of the

DISCUSSION ON ISSUES IN EP.NO.1/2019
50. ISSUE No.1 Whether the petitioner proves that the respondent No.1 was the partner of the firm
M/s. Adhikarah Ventures LLP and M/s. Dhrone Workforce LLP but not disclosed in the affidavit
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128202297/ 26
Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
Form No.26 filed along with nomination paper? In order to prove the said issue, the petitioner in
EP.NO.1/2019 - A.Manju, examined as PW1, and he has deposed that after filing of the nomination
paper by the petitioner himself and also respondent No.1, he has verified the website in respect of
the affidavit of the respondent No.1 and he has found a false affidavit filed by the respondent No.1
and contended that the respondent No.1 was the partner of the firms M/s. Adhikarah Ventures LLP
and M/s. Dhrone Workforce LLP but he has not disclosed the same in Form No.26 and also deposed
that he has raised various objections on the Form No.26 filed by the respondent No.1 and he has
brought to the notice of the Returning Officer by producing the master data of those companies
where the respondent no.1 was partner. In support of his contention, he has produced and marked
the EX.P1 the Form No.26 the affidavit filed by the respondent No.1 and he also produced and got
marked Ex.P2 - the objection raised by him and contended that inspite of the raising of objection,
Returning Officer accepted the nomination paper. In order to prove the respondent No.1 was the
partner of the firms, he has got marked Exs.P10 and P11. He further got marked the Exs. P10 (A) to
(E) and, 10(B) in respect of M/s. Adhikarah Ventures LLP and Ex.P11 (A) to (E) in respect of the
M/s. Dhrone Workforce LLP. In the cross examination, the learned Senior Counsel for the
respondent has posed the question, that the petitioner has deposed he is not aware that the
respondent No.1 has resigned from the post of partner in both the firms on 19.3.2019 and the same
was accepted by the firm and the petitioner admitted that the resignation letter issued by the
respondent were marked by him as per Ex.P10(E) where in the firm has accepted the resignation
from the firm as per Ex.P10(D) and the Form No.4 sent to the Registrar of Companies, which is
marked as Ex.P10(C). Likewise, the PW1 also admits the respondent has resigned the partner of the
firm M/s. Dhrone Workforce LLP as per P11(E), Ex.P11(D) is the acceptance of the resignation by
the firm and the Form No.4 sent to the Registrar of Companies is marked as Ex.P11(C). The learned
Senior Counsel for the respondent has argued that as on the date of filing the nomination paper by
the respondent No.1 on 22.3.2019, he is not the partner of both the firms as his resignation was
already accepted by the firm and sent the information to the Registrar of Companies and
subsequently the Registrar of Companies has web hosted the same. Therefore, it is contended by the
learned Senior Counsel for respondent No.1 that he has not suppressed any information and he was
not at all part of the firm, therefore, he has not suppressed any material fact in the affidavit.
51. Sri. Srivatsava, learned Senior Counsel appearing for petitioner contended that the respondent
No.1 resigned on 19.3.2019 which was said to be accepted on the same day and intimated to the
Registrar of Companies, but contended that as per Section 24 of the Limited Liability Partnership
Act, a notice in writing shall have to be issued not less than 30 days prior to the resignation.
Therefore, it is contended that there is no such notice of resignation issued by respondent No.1 prior
to 30 days of his resignation and acceptance and therefore he is continuing to be partner in both he
firm. It is further contended that as per Sub- section 5(a) of the Limited Liability Partnership Act, a
partner is seized to be a partner unless otherwise provided in the limited liability partnership
agreement that the former partner or a person entitled to his share, an amount equal to the capital
contribution of the former partner actually made to the liability partnership and contended that
there is no such settlement took place between the firm and the respondent No.1. Therefore, he is
continued to be a partner in both the firms as on the date of filing the nomination and it was not
mentioned in Form No.26, the affidavit filed by the respondent. However, the respondent No.1
himself examined as RW1 and deposed that he has resigned as the partner of both the firms as per
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128202297/ 27
Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
resignation letters Exs.P10(E) and P11(E), which were marked by the petitioner and the firm has
accepted the resignation and Form Nos.3 and 4 were submitted to the Registrar of Companies.
Therefore, it is contended as on the date of filing nomination he is not a partner in both the firm,
therefore, it need not be mentioned in the nomination paper and in the cross examination by the
learned counsel for petitioner in EP.No.1/2019, the RW1 deposed that on 19.3.2019, he has resigned
from both the firms but he does not remember as to when he received the certificate of approval of
registration from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and he also deposed that he is not aware as to
whether the approval certificate from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs has been received or not at
the time of filing the nomination paper on 22.3.2019, but denied that until the certificate issued by
the Ministry of Corporate Affairs he will continued to be partner of both the firm as on the date of
filing the nomination. The respondent counsel relied upon judgment of the Co-ordinate Bench of
this court reported in 2003 SCC Online KAR 651 in the case of M/S. MOTHER CARE (INDIA LTD.)
IN LIQUIDATION REPRESENTED BY OFFICIAL LIQUIDATOR BANGALORE Vs. PROF.
RAMASWAMY P. IYER, wherein in a similar circumstances, a Director resigned from the company
and the resignation was immediate effect and resigning would be seized to be a Director without
having to wait for its acceptance by the Board of Directors. Learned Senior Counsel for respondent
also contended that as per Section 24 of Limited Liability Partnership Act (hereinafter referred to as
'L.L.P. Act') when a persons seized to be a partner of the limited liability partnership in accordance
with agreement with the other partner or in the absence of agreement with other partners as to
cessation of being a partner by giving a notice in writing of not less than 30 days to other partners of
his intention to resign as a partner at Ex.P10(C) and as per Ex.P.10(D), the petitioner himself
produced the resolution extract of it passed by the firm on 19.3.2019 by accepting the resignation of
the respondent No.1 and web hosted subsequent to the filing of the nomination. In view of the
judgment of the Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in Mother care India's case (supra) as on the date
of resignation of respondent No.1 on 19.3.2019, the respondent No.1 ceases to be a partner of the
firm, therefore, the contention of the petitioner that he was continued to be partner of M/s.
Adhikarah Ventures LLP as on 22.3.2019, is not acceptable. Likewise, as per Ex.P.11 A to F, the
respondent No.1 resigned from M/s. Dhrone Workforce LLP on 19.3.2019 and therefore, once the
agreement was entered into between the parties by mutual consent and resignation was accepted as
on the date of filing nomination, the respondent No.1 is no more partner of both the firm. Therefore,
it need not be mentioned in the nomination form in Ex.P1. Therefore, I hold that the petitioner
failed to prove the issue No.1 that respondent No.1 though partner of both the firm, but not
mentioned in the Form No.26, hence answered the Issue No.1 in the NEGATIVE.
52. ISSUE No.2 Whether the petitioner proves that respondent No.1 has falsely claimed that he is
the owner of the lands mentioned in paragraph 17(c) of the petition and also shown wrong market
value of the suit property and also furnished wrong and incomplete information in his affidavit
Form No.26 filed along with the nomination paper?
In order to prove this issue that the respondent No.1 is having landed properties in various places,
he has not mentioned the Market value, purchase value and guidance value of the properties, but he
has mentioned wrong values of the properties. In support of his contention, the petitioner got
marked Exs.P8 and P8 (a) to (h) to show that the respondent No.1 is having property at
Nelamangala as per Ex.R8 the RTC, he owns property at Bhavinkere village as per RTC's 8(a) to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128202297/ 28
Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
8(a)(d) and encumbrance certificate are marked at Ex.P8(e) to P8(h). The petitioner has contended
the Sub-Registrar issued the market guidance value of the properties fixed by the Sub-Registrar as
per Ex.P8(j) to
(h). The learned counsel for the respondent in the cross examination of PW1 suggested that Ex.P8
(e) to (h) not depict the correct picture of the value of the properties purchased by the respondent
No.1 and the same was denied by him. P.W.1 further denied in the cross examination that
respondent declared the 3 values like guidance value, market value and purchase value of the
properties and further admits in the cross examination that he has not verified those sale deeds of
respondent No.1 in respect of landed properties at Bhavinkere village. On the other hand, the
respondent No.1 in his evidence has deposed and marked the Ex.R5 - the sale deed copy in respect
of Sy.No.13/2 of Bhavinkere Village, Ex.R6 another copy of the sale deed in respect of land in
Sy.No.16/3, Ex.R7 in respect of copy of the sale deed in Sy.No.17/2 and contended that he has
mentioned the value of the properties in the nomination affidavit. In the further
examination-in-chief, respondent No.1 has stated that he has produced the Exs.R21, 22, 23 and 24
in respect of the lands in Bhavinkere village and further contended he had purchased the properties
prior to the election and some of the properties in Sy.No.17/1 got exchanged with adjacent land
owner and obtained land in Sy.No.16/4. In the cross examination, respondent No.1 has stated that
he has declared the approximate market value of the property owned by him and he further admits
that he has declared the value of the properties which was less than the guidance value fixed by the
government but he further submits by volunteer to submit that guidance value is issued by the
government only for stamp duty purpose but he has purchased the properties at distressed value.
53. The respondent No.1 denied the value of the properties mentioned in Exs.P8(j) to (h) - the sale
deeds produced by the respondent. On perusal of Ex.P1 - the nomination and the affidavit, the
respondent has mentioned approximate current market value of the landed properties. Learned
counsel for respondent No.1 has contended that the petitioner has not produced any material to
show the value declared by the respondent was wrong, and the sale deeds and valuer's report were
not produced and it is contended that as per the information given by one Kiran Real Estate Agent,
the market value of the properties were mentioned by the respondent in his affidavit. Therefore, it is
submitted that the contention of the petitioner that value of the property is not mentioned, is not
tenable.
54. However, the petitioner examined PW2 - R.Girish, Deputy Commissioner. He has deposed that
during his tenure as Deputy Commissioner of Hassan, he received a letter from the Election
Commissioner of India to assess the value of the immovable property of respondent No.1 at the time
of purchase of the property and also at the time of nomination filed by the respondent No.1 and he
got the valuation from the Sub- Registrar as well as bank details from the banker, then he gave
report as per Ex.P5 and he has identified the details of the value of the properties mentioned in his

55. The counsel for the petitioner in E.P.No.2/2019 also got marked Ex.P9 - the report and the
Ex.P5 and P9 are one and the same. In the cross examination of P.W.2, the counsel for the
respondent No.1 suggested, what was the value of the property whether he is having any personal

Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
knowledge, for that, P.W.2 has stated that he does not have any personal knowledge about value of
the property, but he has mentioned in his report about the value of the property by obtaining
information from the Sub-Registrar of the concerned jurisdiction and he has denied that the he has
given false report to the Election Commission of India as per Exs.P5 and P9.
56. On perusal of the Ex.P5(c), the details of the immovable assets, P.W.2 has mentioned the details
of the agriculture land situated at Bhavinkere village as mentioned by the respondent No.1 in his
affidavit and the value of the property at the time of purchase and the value of the properties as per
the information received from the authorities, he has mentioned that Rs.4,47,130/- is excess
declared by the respondent in respect of Sy.No.9/1 (measuring 1.36 guntas). In respect of Sy.No.9/2,
respondent No.1 declared the value was Rs.6,75,000/- and purchase value was Rs.7,27,925/-
thereby, he has declared Rs.52,945/- which is excess. Likewise, in Sy.Nos.13/1, 16/3, 16/2, 17/1,
17/2, 13/2, the respondent No.1 declared less amount of Rs.43,23,010/-, Rs.5,16,585/- is less
amount declared and another Rs.19,91,243/- which is less declared and in respect of Sy.No.17/1,
respondent No.1 has declared excess of Rs.87,757/- and in Sy.No.17/2 declared less amount of
Rs.17,11,855/- and in respect of Sy.No.13/2, he has declared less amount of Rs.80,39,650/-.

58. On perusal of the reply, it reveals that the respondent has declared Rs.16,00,000/- less in
Sy.No.9/1, Rs.9,00,000/- in Sy.No.9/2, he has declared less amount of Rs.1,80,00,000/- in
Sy.No.13/1 and Rs.31,00,000/- less in respect of Sy.No.16/3, Rs.78,00,000/- less in Sy.No.16/2,
Rs.25,00,000/- less in Sy.No.17/1. Rs.72,00,000/- in Sy.No.17/2 and Rs.3,37,50,000/- less in
respect of Sy.No.13/2. These properties were situated at Bhavinkere village, Kasaba Hobli
Nelamangala.
59. The learned counsel for the respondent No.1 has not examined any witness on behalf of the
respondent No.1 to disprove the evidence of PW2 - the Deputy Commissioner, who gave the report
as per Ex.P5, 5(b) and 5(c) where it is clear that there is difference in purchase value, guidance value
and declared value in almost all the landed properties purchased by the respondent No.1 at
Nelamangala taluk, Kasaba Hobli, Bhavinkere village. As far as the property at Holenarasipura,
Maragowdanahalli village, the property at Gowripura, Somanalli Kavalu village and non agriculture
land at Holenarasipura received from his father were all declared less amount than the actual
market value as well as the guidance value to the tune of Rs.2,93,825/- in Sy.No.150/2 and
Rs.7,68,000/- in respect of Holenarasipura landed property. In respect of Sy.No.72 of Gowripura
Somanalli Kavalu village, he has declared less amount than the market value and also regarding non
agricultural land at holenarasipura he has declared less value of Rs.52,81,875/-, Rs.4,24,517/-, and
Rs.80,33,280/- in respect of non agriculture lands situated at Holenarasipura village, Hassan.
Though the petitioner not disputed in respect of the value mentioned by the respondent No.1 for the
property situated at Hassan Taluk but disputed only the value of the property at Holenarasipura as
well as Bhavinkere village and the Ex.P5 (b) and (c) were not contraverted by respondent's counsel.
60. On the other hand, the respondent's counsel relied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in respect of INDIAN COUNSEL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH Vs TN SANIKOP AND ANR
reported in (2014) 16 SCC 274 paragraph 20 of the judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held
that while determining the market value of the land, one can never come to any exact figure of price
of lands because in the very nature of things, prices are bound to vary from land to land and further
depending upon the individual buyer to buyer, seller to seller, reason behind the sale and purchase
etc. However, the courts, in such case, always exercise their discretion within the permissible
parameters after appreciating the evidence on record and applying relevant legal principles. The
learned counsel contended that, the value declared by the respondent is correct. But, in my
considered view, the said judgment will not come to the aid of the respondent as the observation
made by the Hon'ble Supreme Court for determination of the market value is for the purpose of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128202297/ 31
Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
awarding compensation in land acquisition matter and there were settled principles and guidelines
issued for the purpose of calculating fair market value while awarding compensation. But here, in
this case, the respondent No.1 has declared the value of his immovable properties in the affidavit in
Form No.26 in order to secure the votes from the general public while contesting the election.
Hence, he has to declare the actual value which was purchased by him and the market value of the
immovable property. As per the evidence of the PW1, PW2 and PW4 and PW3 and Exs.P5 and P9 in
both case, it is clear that the respondent No.1 declared the value of the immovable properties less
than the market value as well as the guidance value. Therefore, I am of the view the petitioner is
successful in proving issue No.2 that, the respondent No.1 given false information and false
declaration of the value of the immovable properties in his affidavit Form No.26. Hence answered
Issue No.2 in the AFFIRMATIVE in favour of the petitioner and as against the respondent No.1.
61. ISSUE No.3 Whether the petitioner proves that respondent No.1 has mislead the voters in
respect of the firm Chennambika Convention Hall for which respondent No.1 is a partner?
and
ISSUE No.5
Whether the petitioner
proves that respondent No.1
concealed his investment in the
firm Chennambika Convention Hall
and it was obligation on his part to
disclose the same ?
The petitioner has stated in the petition that respondent No.1 is the partner of Chennambika
Convention Hall and respondent No.1 has spent lot of investment in constructing the said Hall, but
he has not declared the same, and, thereby, he has mislead the voters. The petitioner has not lead
any evidence or produced any document in support of his contention. But respondent No.1 has
declared in Ex.P.1-affidavit No.26 at column No.7A(3) that he is having the investments in bonds,
debentures/shares, unit in companies, mutual funds and others, and the amount where the
respondent stated that Chennambika Convention Hall is Rs.14,66,666/-, but respondent No.1 has
not stated that whether he is the partner of the firm or he is having bond or debentures in the firm.
The petitioner though taken the contention in paragraph-K of the petition, but he has not lead any
evidence in this regard. However, it is the duty of the respondent No.1 to declare that he is the
partner of the Chennambika Convention Hall but he has not disclosed as to whether he is the
partner or he is having any shares in the Chennambika Convention Hall. Therefore, without
production of any document in this regard, the contention of the petitioner that respondent No.1 is
the partner of Chennambika Convention Hall, cannot be acceptable. (Though the petitioner in E.P.
No.2/2019 lead evidence in respect of Chennambika Convention Hall, but that will be discussed in
the later part of the judgment). The learned counsel for the respondent No.1 has rightly contended
that there is pleading, but there is no evidence. In this regard, learned counsel for respondent has
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128202297/ 32
Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
relied upon the judgment reported in 2000 (8) SCC 191 in the case of RAVINDER SINGH Vs.
JANMEJA SINGH, reported in 2011 (8) SCC 613 in the case of RAMESH KUMAR Vs. FURU RAM
and reported in 2012 (3) SCC 236 in the case of MARKIO TADO Vs. TAKAM SORANG. In view of
the principles laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, I hold that the petitioner has failed to prove
issue Nos.3 and 5. Hence, I answer Issue Nos.3 and 5 in the NEGATIVE.
62. ISSUE No.6:
Whether the petitioner proves that respondent No.1 has concealed the actual balance of the bank
account of Karnataka Bank, Minerva Circle branch, held by him and if so, it vitiates the election?
and ISSUE No.8:
Whether respondent No.1 proves that he was not aware of the remittance of Rs.50.00
lakhs into his savings bank account in Karnataka Bank by one Kuppendra Reddy,
Member of Parliament (Rajya Sabha)?
The petitioner has stated in the pleadings that respondent No.1 is having the savings bank account
No.0622500101373401 in Karnataka Bank, Minerva Circle Branch, Bengaluru and he had the
balance of Rs.49,09,583/- in the said account, but respondent No.1 has declared in his affidavit that
the balance in the said account was Rs.5,78,238/-. The petitioner further contended that respondent
No.1 received Rs.50.00 lakhs from Sri Kuppendra Reddy, who was the Rajya Sabha Member and the
said amount has been credited to account of respondent No.1, but he has not declared in his
affidavit. The petitioner, in his evidence, at paragraph No.5, has reiterated the same and he has
produced the certificate issued by the said Bank Manager as per Ex.P.57. Respondent No.1, in his
cross examination, has stated that he was not aware that Kuppendra Reddy transferred Rs.50.00
lakhs to his account on 11.03.2019, and further contended that the respondent No.1 obtained the
statement of accounts from 01.04.2018 till February 2019. Therefore, as per the statement, the
balance as on 27.02.2019 was Rs.5,78,238/-but not Rs.49,09,583/-.
63. In this regard, respondent No.1 also lead evidence and has stated in his deposition that he was
not aware regarding transfer of Rs.50.00 lakhs by Kuppendra Reddy, it was subsequent to
statement of accounts obtained by him. Therefore, he has stated that he has mentioned the bank
balance till 27.2.2019. In the cross examination of R.W.1, the learned Senior Counsel for petitioner
in E.P. No.1/2019 got an admission that account No.0622500101373401 mentioned in Ex.R.3 is not
reflected or mentioned in Ex.P.1 that the balance amount as per Ex.R.3 was Rs.54,59,973/-. But
respondent No.1 declared in his affidavit in Form No.26 (Ex.P.1) that he is having the balance of
Rs.5,78,238/-in Karnataka Bank.
64. The learned Senior Counsel for respondent No.1 has argued that the auditor of respondent No.1
advised respondent No.1 to take the balance in the account till the end of February 2019. In this
regard, the respondent has examined R.W.2 Nagin Chand Kincha, the auditor of respondent No.1,
who has stated that as per his advise, respondent No.1 took out the statement in the bank account
up to 28.02.2019. However, in the cross examination, R.W.2 has admitted that while filing the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128202297/ 33
Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
nomination by respondent No.1 on 23.02.2019, he has not checked the balance amount from
01.03.2019 to 22.03.2019. In view of the admission made by R.W.2 as well as respondent No.1 in his
evidence, it is clear that respondent No.1 had the balance of more than Rs.49,09,583/- as on
22.03.2019.
65. It is also revealed in the evidence of P.W.5, who is the Senior Manager of the Karnataka Bank,
that he has issued Exs.P.12 and P.13 and respondent No.1 was having the balance of Rs.55,95,910/-
as on 11.03.2019 and subsequently, there was no transaction till 21.03.2019 and the balance in the
account of the respondent No.1 as on 22.03.2019 was Rs.49,09,583/-. The learned Senior Counsel
for respondent No.1 has not controverted the evidence of P.W.5 that respondent No.1 was having the
balance of more than Rs.49.00 lakhs, but in the nomination affidavit Form No.26, respondent No.1
has mentioned the balance only for Rs.5,78,238/- and he has not mentioned that this balance was at
the end of February 2019. He was supposed to declare the bank balance as on the date of filing the
nomination or, at least one or two days prior to the filing of nomination and it required to be
mentioned atleast a day prior to 22.03.2019. Absolutely, there is no mention by respondent No.1 in
his affidavit, but he has transacted even after 1.3.2019 till 21.3.2019 (the said evidence came in
E.P.No.2/2019) as he has paid some taxes to the Mysore Urban Development Authority. Therefore,
the explanation of respondent No.1 that he was ignorant of the amount received from Kuppendra
Reddy, is not acceptable and he has not mentioned in the affidavit that he is liable to pay Rs.50.00
lakhs to Kuppendra Reddy. On the other hand, the petitioner is successful in proving that
respondent No.1 concealed (suppressed) the actual balance amount in the bank account
No.0622500101373401 of Karnataka Bank, Minerva Circle branch. Hence, I answer Issue No.6 in
the AFFIRMATIVE and Issue No.8 in the NEGATIVE as the respondent failed to prove this issue.
66. Issue No.5 in E.P.No.2/2019 Whether the petitioner proves that the non disclosure of material
information by respondent No.1 in Form No.26 as contemplated under Section 33A of RP Act and
he has committed corrupt practice of bribery as contemplated under Sections 123(1)(A), 123(1)(B),
123(7), 123(7)(b), 123(vii)(d), 123(7)(h) and Section 123(8), 123(3), 3A and 123(6) of R.P. Act ?
The petitioner in E.P. No.2/2019 has contended that respondent No.1 committed corrupt practice of
bribery as contemplated under Section 123 and various sub Sections of R.P. Act and Section
123(1)(A) of R.P. Act. The petitioner has stated in the petition that respondent No.1 filed his
nomination paper and an affidavit in Form No.26, but he has not disclosed all the information and
he has given false information and suppressed most of the information. In spite of the objections
raised by the petitioner, the Returning Officer accepted the nomination paper of respondent No.1.
The contentions of the petitioner are as under:
(a) The petitioner has contended that respondent No.1 was the partner in two firms
namely M/s. Adikarah Ventures LLP and as on the date of filing nomination, he was
continued to be a partner of the firm and he has not disclosed in the affidavit filed on
22.03.2019. In this regard, the petitioner lead the evidence and got marked Ex.P.15
which is the document pertaining to the M/s. Adikarah Ventures LLP and Ex.P.15(a)
is the document pertaining to M/s. Drone Work Force LLP. In the cross-examination,
it was suggested by the respondent counsel that the respondent No.1 already
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128202297/ 34
Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
tendered resignation to both the firms as on 19.03.2019. In the cross examination,
the P.W.1 has stated that he is not having any knowledge about tendering resignation
by respondent No.1 to those companies as a partner. He has also stated that he has
not approached the office of the Registrar of Companies or personally verified the
resignation of respondent No.1 to the above said firms.
The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner has contended that respondent No.1 was the partner
of both the firms and he had investment to the extent of 20% and 25% respectively, but he has not
disclosed the same. Ex.P.15 is the master data where it reveals that the respondent No.1 was the
partner of M/s. Adikarah Ventures LLP ., Ex.P.15(a) is the master data to show that he is one of the
partners of the Drone Work Force LLP. The respondent No.1 has contended that he has already
resigned from the said firms as on 19.03.2019, the same was accepted by the other partners of the
firm by resolution and they have sent the information to the Registrar of the Companies. In this
regard, the petitioner in E.P.No.1/2019 has got marked Exs.P.10 and P.11 and the same was
admitted by the respondent, the said documents were marked by the petitioner in E.P.No.1/2019
which were admitted documents and it clearly reveals, respondent No.1 already resigned from the
firm which was accepted by the other partners of the firm by way of resolution. The petitioner in
both the cases also got examined PW.9- B.Annapurna, the Deputy Registrar of Companies and this
witness has stated that Exs.P.10 and P.11 are the documents pertaining to respondent No.1 where he
was the partner in both the firms and he had a share of investment in both the firms. After the
resignation of the respondent No.1, the said share was appropriated by the remaining partners.
P.W.9 has also stated they received the information from the firm and also the amended agreement
dated 19.03.2019 and the same was accepted by their office. The learned counsel for the petitioner
has tried to bring in the evidence stating that 30 days notice required to be given prior to resignation
by a partner. P.W.9 has also stated that as per Section 24(1) of Limited Liability Partnership Act,
2008 (for short 'LL.P. Act'), there is no need to give 30 days notice when there is an agreement
between the parties and 30 days notice is required only when there is no agreement. Here, in this
case, there is an agreement between the partners of the firm and after the resignation of respondent
No.1, it was accepted by the firm and amended agreement was prepared as per Exs.P.10(f) and
P.11(f). P.W.9 also deposed that their office approved the resolution on 26.03.2019. Therefore, it is
suggested to P.W.9 by the petitioner's counsel that respondent No.1 was continued to be a partner
till 26.03.2019, but, PW.9 has stated that as soon as the respondent resigned from the firm, which
was accepted by the firm and the same was approved by the Registrar of Companies, the resignation
will come into effect from 19.03.2019 but not from 26.03.2019. In view of the evidence of PW.9 and
Exs.P.10 and P.11 marked by the petitioner counsel that, I hold, as on the date of nomination filed
i.e., on 22.03.2019, respondent No.1 was not the partner of both the firms. Therefore, he need not be
declare in the Form No.26. This Court has already given finding in respect of issue No.1 in
E.P.No.1/2019 in favour of the respondent. Therefore, I hold that the petitioner failed to prove the
contention that the respondent No.1 not given proper information and investment made in both the
firms and therefore, answered NEGATIVE against the petitioner.
(b) The petitioner also contended that the respondent No.1 is bound to disclose the liabilities and
loans, if any taken, and he has stated in column No.8 in Part-A of the Form No.26 and disclosed that
he has borrowed loan from 16 persons, which are as under:

67. The petitioner further contended that the respondent No.1 has declared that the
loan borrowed from his father H.D.Revanna was Rs.74,00,000/-, but as per the
declaration made by H.D.Revanna before the Lokayuktha in the year 2018, he has
declared that loan given to his son was Rs.1,26,36,000/-, thereby, respondent No.1
has shown a wrong information in the affidavit and there was difference of
Rs.52,36,000/-.
In this regard, the petitioner has not produced the declaration made by H.D. Revanna before the
Lokayuktha. On the other hand, it was suggested to R.W.1 in the cross examination where R.W.1
admitted that his father declared in his assets and liabilities before the Lokayuktha by showing the
loan given to him was Rs.46.00 lakhs as on 30.07.2018. Though R.W.1 has stated that there was
subsequent transaction between himself and his father. Likewise, the petitioner has also stated that
R.W.1 borrowed loan from his mother Bhavani Revanna to the tune of Rs.43,75,000/-, but as per
the evidence of P.W.11- Dr. Abhinav Pitta, Income Tax Deputy Commissioner and P.W.12- Praveen
Sinha, Asst. Commissioner of Income Tax that R.W.1- Prajwal Revanna in his income tax returns
has not declared that he has borrowed the loan of Rs.1,26,36,000/- from his father and
Rs.43,75,000/- from his mother. Neither Revanna nor Bhavani Revanna has declared in their
income tax returns that they have lent loan to their son. The petitioner has produced Exs.P.30 to
P.44, the income tax returns of R.W.1 and his parents, which clearly reveal that there is no such
disclosure of the loan amount by all these three persons. Therefore, I hold that respondent No.1
made wrong declaration about loans in his affidavit in column No.8 of the nomination paper.
Hence, I answer this point in favour of the petitioner and against the respondent.
(c) The another contention taken by the petitioner is that respondent No.1 is having S.B. account in
Karnataka Bank, Minerva Circle Branch and he has declared the balance amount as on the date of
nomination was Rs.5,78,238/- but, as per the Bank Statement, the balance amount was
Rs.49,09,583/-. There is difference of Rs.43,31,345/- which is a false declaration and also the
respondent No.1 borrowed loan of Rs.50,00,000/- which was not declared in the affidavit. To prove
this contention, the petitioner himself was examined as witness, deposed the same and got marked
the nomination filed by the respondent No.1 where the respondent has declared that the amount
balance available in his account as Rs.5,78,238/-. The petitioner examined P.W.5 - Sathish Kishore
K., Senior Branch Manager, Karnataka Bank has deposed that Ex.P.7 is the letter issued by his
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128202297/ 36
Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
predecessor which is the statement of account belongs to respondent No.1. The petitioner also
produced Exs.P.12 and P.13 and deposed that as on 11.03.2019, the balance amount in the account
of respondent No.1 was Rs.55,95,910/- and thereafter, there was no transaction and as on
22.03.2019, the balance was Rs.49,09,583/-. In the cross-examination, the learned counsel for the
respondent has contended that they are not sending the alert information to the customer for having
transferred any amount to the account holders. In order to controvert the evidence of PW.1, the
respondent No.1 stated in his evidence that he has obtained the statement of accounts only up to
February 2019 and therefore, he is not aware about the transfer of an amount of Rs.50,00,000/- by
Kuppendra Reddy to his account on 11.03.2019. He also stated that the said Kuppendra Reddy also
not informed him about the transfer of the said amount. To prove his contention, the respondent
also got examined his auditor one Nagin Chand Kincha as R.W.2, who has deposed that as per his
instruction, respondent No.1 obtained the statement of accounts and balance till 28.02.2019 and in
the cross-examination, he has admitted that he is not aware about the transaction made by the
respondent No.1 between 01.03.2019 and 22.03.2019. He also further deposed his ignorance that he
is not aware that assets and liability statement shall be filed as on the date of filing the nomination
paper. But he has admitted the filing of the nomination for the last day was 23.03.2019. Admittedly,
respondent No.1 filed nomination on 22.03.2019. On perusal of Ex.P.5, he has mentioned or
declared the balance in his account was only Rs.5,00,000/- and odd, but, in fact as per Ex.P.7 and
evidence of PW.5, the balance was Rs.49,09,583/- as on 22.03.2019 and therefore, I hold the
respondent No.1 not furnished the correct balance in his account at Karnataka Bank, Minerva Circle
Branch. Apart from that, he has also not declared the loan obtained from Kuppendra Reddy, a Rajya
Sabha M.P. for Rs.50,00,000/- in his affidavit, even though he has declared 16 names in column
No.8 of Part A. Therefore, I am of the view, that the petitioner has proved that the respondent made
a false declaration in respect of his balance in the account and suppressed the loan of
Rs.50,00,000/- obtained from Kuppendra Reddy. Hence, answered this point in the
AFFIRMATIVE.
(d) The petitioner has further contended that respondent No.1 declared in column No.11 of Part B in
affidavit Form No.26, that a sum of Rs.4,89,15,029/- paid through D.D. and RTGS for the purpose
of purchasing agriculture properties but the father of respondent No.1, the sitting MLA has declared
that he has paid Rs.47,36,000/- to the respondent No.1, thereby, there was a false declaration. But,
the petitioner has not lead any evidence and also not produced any document to show that this
amount was borrowed from his father in order to purchase the agricultural lands. Therefore, I hold
the respondent's counsel has rightly contended that though there was a pleading, but there was no
evidence. Therefore, I answered this point against the petitioner in the NEGATIVE.
(e) The petitioner further contended that respondent No.1 declared that he has purchased various
agricultural properties in different places totally 8 properties, but only 4 sale deeds are the
registered sale deeds and three more properties pending for registration, even though the said
properties belong to the Government and not available for registration which amounts to the land
grabbing and further contented that there was a false declaration.
(e)(i) In respect of sale deeds in survey Nos.16/2 and 17/1, the petitioner has deposed that one sale
deed containing two survey number of lands, therefore, it is contended by the petitioner that it is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128202297/ 37
Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
false declaration. In this regard, the respondent No.1 himself produced and marked the document as
per Ex.R.24 which is also marked by the petitioner as per Ex.P.11. On perusal of Ex.P.11, the
respondent has purchased land in survey No.16/3 on 15.09.2010 and on the same day, he has also
purchased one more land in Sy.No.17/2. Therefore, Ex.P.11 cannot be considered as document in
respect of the land in survey Nos.16/2 and 17/1 contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner.
However, the respondent got marked Ex.R.24, the sale deed dated 15.09.2010, the respondent
purchased lands in survey No.17/1 measuring 38 guntas and survey No.16/2 measuring 1 acre 38
guntas and the same was declared by the respondent in the affidavit. Though he has mentioned two
survey numbers in the declaration, in fact, it was purchased in one sale deed. The respondent No.1
has not given any explanation in respect of Ex.R.24 where he has stated Ex.R.24 contains only
survey No.17/1, but in fact he had purchased two properties i.e., Sy.Nos.17/1 and 16/2 under
Ex.R.24-the sale deed. However, the said sale deed containing the purchase of both the lands under
the sale deed No.3005/2010-11. Therefore, it may be the details mentioned by respondent but it
cannot be said that it is a false declaration. Hence, the contention of the petitioner is not acceptable.
(e)(ii) The learned counsel for the petitioner further contended that the survey Nos.16/3, 17/2 and
13/2 are at Bhavinkere Village. The petitioner has produced the RTCs which speak something else
and show the names of Ravishankar and Ramachandra, which were acquired for the purpose of
National Highway and name of the respondent No.1 did not find place in the RTCs. The petitioner
has deposed the same and marked RTCs as per Exs.P.13 and P.13(a) to (d). On the other hand, the
respondent No.1 has deposed in his evidence stating that the land in survey Nos.16/3 and 17/2 were
not forfeited by the Government when he purchased the property in the year 2009 and there was a
civil litigation pending between his vendor and vendor's vendor. He also stated that the registration
was kept pending for want of 11E sketch. The petitioner also got examined PW.4 - Ambika Patel, the
Sub-Registrar, and she has stated in her evidence that at the request of the Deputy Commissioner,
she sent the list of guidance value of the properties of Bhavinkere Village and encumbrance
certificate as per Exs.P.8(e), (f) and (g). In the further evidence, she has stated that the sale deed in
respect of survey No.17/2 (Ex.P.11), the sale deed was kept pending registration. This witness also
identified that Ex.P.10 is the sale deed in respect of survey No.16/3. In the cross examination, she
has stated that the sale deeds were not registered and it was kept pending for want of 11E Sketch.
Though the petitioner's counsel produced document and contended that the respondent was not the
owner of the land but respondent No.1 himself has declared as owner. However, names of the owner
in the said document were shown as Ravishankar and Ramachandra who were all the erstwhile
owners of the property and the registration was not completed. Therefore, the name of respondent
No.1 cannot be entered in the RTC. Therefore, the contention of the petitioner that respondent No.1
has given wrong information in the affidavit cannot be acceptable. As regards to the acquisition of
the land by the National Highway Authority, the respondent has stated that he was not aware about
the acquisition and he came to know subsequently. Therefore, when he has not received any notice
from the Highway Authority in survey No.13/2 and without his knowledge regarding acquisition, he
has declared that he has purchased property in survey No.16/2, the contention of the petitioner
cannot be acceptable that it is a false declaration. Likewise, when the litigation is pending in respect
of the land which he has purchased in survey No.17/2 in O.S.No.482/2015 and O.S.No.326/2011 on
the file of Senior Civil Judge, Nelamangala, and in view of the litigation pending, reflecting the name
of this respondent in the RTC does not arise. Therefore, once he has purchased the property under
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128202297/ 38
Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
the sale deed, he has to declare in the affidavit as to whether his name is mutated in the RTC or not.
(e)(iii) As regards to the land in Sy.No.3/1 of Srirampura Village Mysore Taluk, it is contended by
respondent No.1 that the said property belongs to him but in the document, the name of one
Maramma, Wife of Nanjaiah is mentioned. Apart from Maramma, it also mentions the name of
Brindavan House Building Co- operative Society. In respect of Sy.No.3/3 of Srirampura village,
learned counsel for petitioner contended that respondent No.1 has been declared as owner of the
property, but the RTC shows the name of one - Nagarathnamma, therefore, it is a false declaration.
The petitioner has also deposed in his evidence that even though the respondent No.1 was not the
owner of property, he has wrongly declared as his property. On the other hand, respondent No.1
(RW1) has stated in his evidence that Sy.Nos.3/1 and 3/2 of the said land were wrongly mentioned
as Sy.Nos.3/2 and 3/3 and these properties were bequeathed by his grand mother Nagarathnamma
under the 'Will' and the said Nagarathnamma died long back and has produced the death certificate
of Nagarathnamma as per Ex.R19. He has also got marked the certified copy of the 'Will' as per the
Ex.R8 wherein in the said 'Will', the property Sy.Nos.3/3 and 3/2 were mentioned and as per
Ex.R19, his grandmother died on 16.1.2010 but the name of the respondent not entered in the
documents. Therefore, it cannot be said that as on that date, he has not got the right over the
property, but he has declared in his affidavit. Therefore, the contention of the petitioner cannot be
acceptable that it was the wrong declaration. Therefore, the contention of the petitioner's counsel
that the declaration of the ownership of the properties in the Form No.26, even though respondent
No.1 is not the owner of the property, cannot be acceptable. However, though respondent No.1
declared that all these properties were purchased by him and he is said to be purchased the land,
there is no registration of sale deeds for want of sketch and he purchased some of the lands in
Bhavinkere village which is a disputed property and litigations were pending, but he had declared
the value of those properties in the nomination Form No.26. As per the evidence of P.W.2 in
E.P.No.1/2019, the Deputy Commissioner of Hassan, given a reply to the report called by the
Election Commission of India and he has given report on 29.04.2019 as per Ex.P.7, the respondent
not declared that he has borrowed Rs.23.00 lakhs from his grand father/grand mother and the
values shown in the report - Exs.P.9 and P.9(c). The respondent declared less amounts in his
affidavit in respect of value of those properties which has been discussed by this Court in issue No.2
and answered against the respondent. Therefore, declaring the wrong valuation of the property by
him is nothing but a wrong declaration, which is nothing but a corrupt practice under Section 123(2)
of R.P. Act.
(e)(iv) The petitioner also contended that in column No.7A of Form No.26 that the SB Account in
Karnataka Bank, Minerva Circle Branch had balance of Rs.49,09,593/- but he has declared only
Rs.5,78,238/- which is a false declaration. In this regard, this Court has already discussed in detail
in issue No.6 in E.P. No.1/2019 and answered against the respondent No.1 for wrongly declaring the
balance in the SB Account in Karnataka Bank, Minerva Circle Branch.
68. As regards to the another contention that a wrong information mentioned by respondent No.1 in
part 7A of Column 5 in item No.1 that he has lent loan to his brother for a sum of Rs.37,20,000/-,
the said fact is not correct, but the actual loan lent was Rs.76,00,000/- through SB account,
Karnataka Bank and therefore, it is incorrect declaration. But the respondent denied the same. The
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128202297/ 39
Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
suggestion was made that he has lent loan of Rs.66,70,000/-, but wrongly declared in his affidavit
as Rs.37,20,000/-. But on verifying Ex.R.28, on careful calculation, which reveals that the
respondent lent the amount of Rs.73,70,000/- to Suraj Revanna and as on 17.08.2012, he has
received back Rs.4.00 lakhs from Suraj Revanna, thereby the respondent lent loan of
Rs.69,70,000/- to his brother. Therefore, his declaration in the nomination form that he has lent
loan for Rs.37,20,000/- is not correct and it is wrong declaration.
69. As regards to the another allegation that as per financial bill 2007, Section 269 ST, the Income
Tax Act, provides that no person shall receive an amount of Rs.2,00,000/- or more aggregate from a
person in a day or a single transaction by cash it should be only online transfer. But the transactions
shown by the respondent No.2 in the Election Petition were all cash transactions and does not
contain any details. Therefore, it is contrary to the Section 269 ST of IT Act. In this regard, though
RW1 has stated that all the transactions are online transactions but no such document is produced
in order to show that he has borrowed the loan from various persons only through Bank but not
cash. Therefore, the petitioner is successful in proving that the respondent No.1 transacted by way of
cash and it is not properly declared the cash by borrowing loans and payments made, but no details
were mentioned in the declaration Form No.26.
70. As regards to the corrupt practice, the petitioner has contended that the respondent has
committed corrupt practice of bribery as contemplated under Section 123 of the R.P. Act.
71. In order to prove this issue, the learned counsel for the petitioner has contended that the father
of respondent No.1 was an In-charge Minister of Hassan District and sitting PWD Minister, by
misusing his power, diverted the fund pertaining to the Cauvery Neeravari Nigam Limited (CNNL)
as the uncle of respondent No.1 was the Chief Minister of the State who is the Chairman of the
CNNL. With his instruction, they diverted the fund allocated by the State for irrigation purpose, but
they diverted the same for constructing the Bhavan, Temple, formation of road etc. In order to prove
the said contention, PW.1-petitioner has deposed that the father of respondent No.1 diverted the
funds from the CNNL for other purposes by influencing the voters. The witness has stated that the
father of the respondent No.1 diverted Rs.576.00 crores released by the State Government for
irrigation project for entire Hassan District, but, by influencing the Managing Director, Executive
Engineer and Assistant Executive Engineer diverted the fund for some other purpose. A complaint
has been filed to the Lokayuktha and the said Lokayuktha has not taken any action against the
father of the respondent. He has produced Ex.P.17-the complaint filed by one Gavirangegowda of
Malali Village, Halekote Hobli, Holenarasipura, where the petitioner was the advocate for the
complainant that complaint was filed long back and an acknowledgment was issued by the
Lokayuktha which is marked as Ex.P.17(a). The complaint was lodged on 14.06.2019, but no action
was taken by the Lokayuktha. The petitioner also produced Ex.P.17(b) which are the documents for
having utilized the amount for construction of Temple and other purposes other than the irrigation
work. There were almost 149 work executed, most of them were construction of temples, temple
compounds, construction of roads, drainages etc. In order to prove the said fact, the petitioner also
summoned the witnesses and examined one Shankare Gowda as PW.18 who has deposed that he is
the MD of CNNL and also produced the document i.e., Ex.P.49 regarding fund allocation and
expenditures. He also produced Ex.P.50, the list of Chairman and members of CNNL for the year
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128202297/ 40
Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
2017-18 and Ex.P.51 for the year 2018-19. The grant released by the State was marked as Exs.P.52
and P.52(a) and he further deposes that the fund allocated to Gorur Circle in 2018-19 was Rs.943.62
crores and the said amount was released for tank filling schemes, improvement and modernization
of canals and also road formation at catchment areas and some amount for public purpose. He has
stated that the said fund cannot be diverted to any other purpose and he has also admitted that the
Chief Minister will be the Chairman, and the Irrigation Minister will be the Vice Chairman. But he
has stated that there is no role in respect of In-charge Minister of Hassan in the Board activities and
he is not a member of the Board. He also deposes that the public can request the development
programmes and the District Minister can also make such requests for such developmental
programmes. In the cross examination, the learned counsel for the respondent has contended that
the resolution is required to be passed by the Board members including the Chief Minister, then,
they can ascertain the projects and release the fund. But this witness has not denied that there is no
involvement of the District In-charge Minister in the projects taken by the Board in the resolution
and not denied the intervention and participation of the In-charge Minister in the Board Meetings.
Normally, the District In-charge Minister will always be notified in respect of every meeting
conducted by the Chairman of the CNNL and the facts should not be forgotten that the Chief
Minister at that time was H.D. Kumarswamy and the District In-charge Minister for Hassan H.D.
Revanna is none other than the elder brother of H.D. Kumarswamy and respondent No.1 is the son
of H.D. Revanna. Therefore, the contention of the respondent cannot be acceptable that the funds
were not diverted. On the other hand, Ex.P.17(b) reveals that the funds were diverted and spent
other than the irrigation projects, thereby, the petitioner is successful in proving that the respondent
influenced the voters by making development works by way of diverting the funds which amounts to
corrupt practice. Hence, answered the said point in the AFFIRMATIVE in favour of the petitioner.
72. As regards to another corrupt practice, the petitioner has stated that the respondent tried to
bribe by sending Rs.1,20,000/- for distributing to the voters through the brother of respondent No.1
-Dr.Suraj Revanna while proceeding in the official car used by his father in Car No.KA.01.MH.4477
which was seized by the flying squad and a case was registered in Crime No.59/2019 and it is
marked as Ex.P.16-FIR which was seized by the Police and PW.1-Devarajegowda has deposed in this
regard. In the cross examination, the respondent has denied the same and contended that the police
filed 'B' final report.
73. As per the evidence of the petitioner PW.1 and the documents, Ex.P.16 reveals that the police
registered the FIR against the brother of the respondent No.1 when the car belongs to his father has
been intercepted and verify the same, Rs.1,20,000/- cash was seized and admittedly, a case was
registered by the Holenarasipura Police station. Respondent No.1 denied the same and he has
contended that the amount was sent by his mother Bhavani Revanna for purchasing the grocery and
therefore, the police have filed 'B' Final report. But the said 'B' Final report not produced by the
respondent to show there is no substance in the complaint and on the other hand, it is a
Government Vehicle provided to the father of respondent No.1 who is the District In-charge
Minister and the vehicle was used by the son of the Minister and cash of Rs.1,20,000/- was seized by
the squad.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128202297/ 41
Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
74. The respondent examined as R.W.1, he has deposed that the police filed 'B' Final report and his
mother gave the said amount to buy cattle feed and groceries which falsely implicated him and in
the cross examination, the learned counsel for the petitioner has contended that at the time of
seizure, there was bill found along with the brother of respondent No.1 and subsequently, they
manipulated the facts in order to overcome the amount carried in the car. It is also suggested by the
Senior Counsel and there was an admission made by R.W.1 that the car belongs to his father and the
same was used by escort belongs to his father and admitted the amount was seized from the car, but
he says, it is an income tax department planted the case and also says that the cash belongs to his
mother and it was given for purchasing the groceries and cattle feed and in order to prove the said
contention the respondent not examined his mother Bhavani Revanna or his brother and not
produced the 'B' Final report. Even if 'B' final report filed by the police, as the respondent family was
ruling political party in Karnataka at that time, there is possibility of influencing the police for filing
the 'B' final report is not ruled out. Therefore, once registering the FIR and seizure of Rs.1,20,000/-
has been admitted, it should be presumed that the amount was sent by the respondent for
distributing to the voters and in spite of the model Code of Conduct of Election was in force, the
question of carrying Rs.1,20,000/- by the respondent family for the purpose of purchasing the
groceries cannot be acceptable. Thereby, the petitioner is successful in proving the corrupt practice
of the respondent in the said election. Hence, answered this point in the AFFIRMATIVE in favour of
the petitioner.
75. Regarding another corrupt practice alleged by the petitioner and regarding religious appeal by
the respondent as per Section 123(3) of the R.P. Act:
76. Section 123(3) of the R.P. Act defines that the appeal by a candidate or his agent or by any other
person with the consent of a candidate or his election agent to vote or refrain from voting for any
person on the ground of his religion, race, caste, community or language or the use of, or appeal to
religious symbols or the use of, or appeal to, national symbols, such as the National Flag or the
National Emblem, for the furtherance of the prospects of the election of that candidate or for
prejudicially affecting the election of any candidate.
77. The petitioner has stated that prior to the election on 12.04.2019, respondent No.1 campaigned
at Halli Mysuru village and assured that the Veerashaiva Lingayath Community people by promising
to build Samudaya Bhavana if they voted to him in the election. A complaint has been registered in
Crime No.41/2019 and FIR has been produced and marked as per Ex.P.20. The evidence of
P.W.1-Devarajegowda has been corroborated with Ex.P.20 - FIR was registered by the Halli Mysuru
police. During the cross examination, learned Senior Counsel for respondent No.1 denied the same.
Except denial, nothing elicited to disbelieve the evidence of P.W.1 that during the election campaign,
respondent No.1 assured the Veerashaiva Community people to construct a Samudaya Bhavana for
them, if they voted to him. Thereby, the petitioner proves that respondent No.1 himself made an
appeal to the community people assuring to build a Samudaya Bhavana for them, if they voted to
him, which definitely affects the opposite candidate and those people might have voted for the
respondent. Hence, the point in respect of Section 123(3) of the R.P. Act has been proved by the
petitioner and answered in the AFFIRMATIVE.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128202297/ 42
Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
78. Another corrupt practice alleged by the petitioner is that, there were two cases registered by
Hirisave police against respondent No.1 in Crime Nos.24/2019 and 26/2019 for having seized two
KSRTC buses and a car which were carrying the printed pamphlets of the respondent. The said
documents are marked at Exs.P.21 and P.22. For that, respondent No.1 has only denied in the cross
examination. However, registering the FIR against respondent No.1 for having carried the bundles
of pamphlets in the KSRTC buses and in a car are not in dispute. Respondent No.1 has stated in his
evidence that FIR was not registered against him and it was registered against some other person.
But, the fact remains that those two buses carried 15 bundles of 25,000 pamphlets without
permission of the Election Commission of India. R.W.1-respondent has admitted the registration of
the FIR for having carried the pamphlets, but he says that he is not the accused in that case. He has
stated that the police have filed B- final report in those two cases. Learned counsel for the petitioner
has contended that the father of respondent No.1 was the District In-charge Minister for Hassan,
and, with influence, those cases were closed by filing the B-final report and there is even chances of
influencing the police was not ruled out since at that time, JDS was ruling party and H.D.
Kumaraswamy, the uncle of the respondent No.1 was Chief Minister and his father was District
In-charge Minister. Thereby, the petitioner is successful in proving that the government vehicles
were used for transporting the election pamphlets without prior permission, which attracts the
corrupt practice under Section 123(5) of the R.P. Act.
79. Another corrupt practice alleged by the petitioner in respect of Section 123(8) of the R.P. Act,
which defines the booth capturing by a candidate or his agent or other person within the meaning of
Section 35A of the R.P. Act. In order to prove the said contention, the petitioner himself is examined
as P.W.1 and he has stated that on the day of polling, the father of respondent No.1 went inside the
polling booth No.244 at Paduvalahippe village along with the mother of respondent No.1. They took
some non-voters from various other parts of the district and made them to vote in favour of
respondent No.1. The agent of the petitioner objected the same, but the officers deputed for the said
booth have not taken any action. Hence, a complaint was lodged to the Deputy Commissioner.
Accordingly, three officers were suspended by the Deputy Commissioner. P.W.1 further deposed
that the father of respondent went inside the polling booth in the morning at 10.47 a.m. and was
stayed for long time till 11.22 a.m. The CCTV footage also revealed that the respondent's father with
his followers went inside the polling booth and got voted for respondent No.1 through many
persons. The petitioner has also deposed that one Sharath Gowda and his wife Lepakshi voted in the
said booth, but they are not the voters of the said booth and they are from Mysuru. One Mahesh,
Bhavani Revanna's car driver also voted, who was not the voter of the said booth. His name was
mentioned in booth No.212 at Kyathahalli village, but he has voted in booth No.244. In this regard,
P.W.1 produced and marked M.Os.1 to 3, the DVDs and hard disk. The learned counsel for
respondent No.1 denied that there was no such booth capturing took place and the respondent's
father went to the booth and voted and came out, which was denied by P.W.1. It is not in dispute
that the respondent and his family members including the parents and grand parents came and
casted their vote in the said booth. To prove the said contention, the petitioner also marked Exs.P.19
and 19A which is the suspension order passed by the Deputy commissioner by suspending the
electoral officials deputed to the said booth. Subsequently, they have been reinstated, but, the fact
remains that there was entry of the respondent's father and family members, and almost the father
of respondent No.1 stayed for one hour in the polling booth and more number of persons voted, at
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128202297/ 43
Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
their instructions. A person by name Purushotham, belongs to respondent No.1, who was wearing
blue shirt, was holding many voter I.D. cards and giving the same to some persons to caste their
votes. The DVD produced by P.W.1 has been played and verified the veracity of the contention of the
petitioner which reveals that the family of respondent No.1, especially, H.D. Revanna and his wife
gone into the polling booth and in spite of casting their votes, they have not came out. On the other
hand, at the instructions of H.D.Revanna, another person holding some voter I.D. cards was
handing over the same to some other persons and in turn, they were casting the votes. It appears
that those persons were not the actual voters of the said booth and I.D. cards in the custody of the
said Purushotham, the party man of respondent No.1 was giving the cards for casting the votes,
which reveals that those persons who casted votes were all proxy voters.
80. The petitioner has also produced the voters list of the Paduvalahippe booth and those persons
were not holding the list. The video clipping of polling booth No.244 was viewed through the
desktop computer which reveals that Smt. Bhavani Revanna, after casting her votes, gone out of the
polling booth and after some time, once again she came back to the polling booth along with a child
and the other people belong to respondent No.1 were stayed in the polling booth. At that time, there
was no public were allowed inside for casting the votes, which reveals that the father of respondent
No.1 H.D. Revanna captured booth No.244 for almost a hour and casted proxy votes through his
henchmen. The CCTV footage also clearly reveals the same. P.W.19-Deputy Commissioner, Hassan
District, produced M.Os.1 to 3 along with the certificate under Section 65-B of Indian Evidence Act
and the certificate is marked as Ex.P.53. Except denial, nothing has been elicited by the respondent's
counsel to disbelieve the evidence of P.W.19 in respect of producing and marking the M.Os.1 to 3
and Ex.P.53, which clearly corroborates the evidence of P.W.1 that the father of respondent No.1
captured the booth for more than a hour and casted the proxy votes and that was also proved by
suspending three electoral officials by the Deputy Commissioner.
81. The petitioner examined P.W.15-Yogisha, who is the Selection Grade Lecturer working in
Government Polytechnic, was deputed as the Presiding Officer to booth No.244 at Paduvalahippe in
Hassan constituency, on 18.04.2019. According to him, more than 1100 voters casted their votes and
there were surveillance camera installed in the polling booth. On 25.04.2019, he received a notice
from the Deputy Commissioner on the complaint made by one Mayanna and Raju against the
officials posted in booth No.244 and they gave reply on 26.04.2019. On 27.04.2019, the suspension
order was issued by the Deputy Commissioner and he identified the suspension order as per
Ex.P.19. In the cross examination, P.W.15 has admitted that the suspension order was revoked by
the Deputy Commissioner on 29.11.2021 as per Ex.R.4.
82. To corroborate the evidence of P.W.1- petitioner and P.W.15 Yogisha, the petitioner also
examined P.W.14- Mayanna, an election agent of BJP Candidate. P.W.14 also deposed that, on
18.04.2019, he worked as an election agent in booth No.244 at paduvalahippe village along with one
Rajugowda. P.W.14 has also deposed that at about 10.15 a.m., he received a phone call from one
Rajugowda, that, the then Minister H.D. Revanna along with his followers brought the outside
people and casted votes. Accordingly, he went there and found the said Minister was in the booth
and the gunman was stood outside, the police and the gunman did not allow him to enter into the
booth. After showing the agent pass and agitated about the proxy votes, there was altercation

Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
between them and thereafter, he telephoned to Tahsildar and obtained permission. Then, he went
inside the booth where he found that then Minister. The 25 followers were standing in the queue
and casting the proxy votes in favour of respondent No.1, even though, they did not have votes in the
said booth and then, he shouted at them. According to his evidence, more than 50 proxy votes
casted. Then, he went to the Assistant Returning Officer in order to file complaint and the said
officer did not take any action. Therefore, on the next day, he lodged a complaint to the Deputy
Commissioner and the Deputy Commissioner, after verifying the CCTV footage and the finding
prima facie material in the allegation, suspended those officials. He has produced and marked
Ex.P.19-the suspension order. During cross examination, it was suggested to P.W.14 that he has not
lodged the complaint on the same day, but he has lodged the complaint only on 24.04.2019 and the
suggestion was also made that there was no such incident took place, but the witness denied both
the suggestions.
83. The evidence of P.Ws.1, 14 and 15, the documents at Ex.P.19 and M.Os.1 to 3, the petitioner is
successful in proving respondent No.1 has committed the corrupt practice through his father and
family members, captured the booth and got casted the proxy votes in his favour by bringing
non-voters to the booth, thereby the petitioner proved the allegation made in the petition as per
Section 123(8) of the R.P. Act beyond doubt.
84. The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner has also argued that respondent No.1 engaged a 13
year young boy as their agent and used for the election purpose and to work as volunteer to bring
the aged persons. It is argued that the children must not have been used by the respondent and the
said child was one of the party members of the respondent.
85. The corrupt practice alleged in respect of Section 123(7) of the of the R.P. Act:
The petitioner has also taken another contention that the respondent No.1 used the
officials for aiding and abetting, by influencing for booth capture, which is also a
corrupt practice under Section 123(7) of the R.P. Act. It is also contended that the
respondent No.1 used the car belonging to the government and the government
officials, escorts and their cars were used for election purpose and thereby,
committed the corrupt practice.
86. The proviso of Sub-Section (7) to Section 123 of The R.P. Act referred below for convenience:
" The obtaining or procuring or abetting or attempting to obtain or procure by a
candidate or his agent or, by any other person 11[with the consent of a candidate or

Government and belonging to any of the following classes, namely:--

other person.] Explanation.--(1) In this Section the expression "agent" includes an
election agent, a polling agent and any person who is held to have acted as an agent
in connection with the election with the consent of the candidate."
87. The learned Senior Counsel for petitioner has also relied upon the Ex.P19 and the
evidence of PW14 and 15 that the respondent father by misusing official position as
District In-charge minister captured the polling booth No.244 and casted their votes
with assistance of the PW15 and two other Government officials by his influence. who
were deputed for election purpose in favour of his son, thereby he has utilized the
government officials that was proved by the petitioner in respect of 123(8) of RP Act,
in the above said issue.
88. It is also an admitted fact that the FIR was registered against the brother of
respondent No.1 Suraj Revanna at Holenarsipura police station and cash of
Rs.1,20,000/- was seized from the escort car belonging to his father which is official
vehicle and the police officials were used by the father of the respondent No.1 H.D.
Revanna in order to circulate the cash among the voters to vote in favour of
respondent No.1 apart from that the KSRTC bus also used for transporting the
pamphlets on behalf of the respondent which was seized by the Hirisave police and
registered two cases which also once again using the public servants/government
officials and government vehicle's in favour of the election campaign. There is
nothing to disbelieve the evidence of petitioner witnesses in respect of allegation
made against the respondent and his family has misused the official position as
district In-

Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
charge minister as the father of the respondent No.1 and his uncle chief minister of the State at the
relevant time and the grand father of the respondent was former Prime Minister of the nation were
all influenced persons and except H.D. Kumaraswamy the family of H.D.Revanna including his wife,
sister-in-law, the respondent, his friends, his grand parents and relatives polling agent were all
stayed together in the polling booth for hours together. It is unfortunate, the officials of the polling
booth were afraid of the In-charge Minister and the ruling party at the time for sending them out
from the polling booth and he has succumbed to the pressure and influence of the respondent
family. Thereby the petitioner is successful in proving the corrupt practice under Section 123(7) of
R.P. Act. In view of the above findings the petitioner is successful in proving the Issue No.5 that the
respondent No.1 involved in corrupt practice of bribery as contemplated under Sections 123 of R.P.
Act. Hence, answered the Issue No.5, Partly In AFFIRMATIVE, in favour of the petitioner and
against the respondent No.1.
89. Issue No.4 in E.P.No.1/2019:
Whether the petitioner proves that it is mandatory for the candidate contesting in an
election to the parliament to show his source of income ?
The petitioner has contended the candidate who contest the parliamentary election to
show his source of income, in this regard, the petitioner himself examined as PW.1
and contended that the respondent No.1 purchased huge landed properties nearby
Nelamanagala Taluk by paying crores of rupees but he has not shown any source of
income. On the other hand, the respondent has stated he has borrowed loan from his
parents and other third parties which were declared in the nomination form but the
respondent No.1 not declared the same in the Income Tax Returns for last 5 years.
Though he has purchased properties from 2008 onwards and received various bills
through the banks but he has not declared his income in the Income Tax Returns and
he has not at all filed any Income Tax Returns till 2017. He has filed ITR for only one
year prior to filing of the nomination and this Court has found various incomes but it
was not declared, there were discrepancies in the borrowing loan from third parties
and he has involved in corrupt practice. The very acceptance of nomination by the
Returning Officer is illegal and improper. It is the duty of the candidate who is
contesting the election shall declare his sources of income assets and liabilities in
order to choose the candidate by the voters. Therefore, it is mandatory on the part of
the candidate to show his source of income, but the respondent failed to show his any
source of income which mislead the voters, thereby I answered Issue No.4 in
E.P.No.1/2019 in the AFFIRMATIVE in favour of the petitioner as against
respondent No.1.
90. Issue No.9 in E.P. No.1/2019 Whether respondent No.1 proves that non disclosure or non filing
of IT returns for five years as required under clause 4(1) in Form No.26 does not violate Section 33A
of the RP Act read with Rule 4A of Conduct of Election Rules together with Form No.26 as appended
to the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961?
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128202297/ 47
Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
and Whether the petitioner proves that the nomination of respondent No.1 in form No.26 enclosed
along with the nomination is in contravention of Section 33 A of R.P. Act and Rule 4A of Conduct of
Election Rules ?
Both the above issues are common issues, hence, taken together for discussion in order to avoid the
repetitions.
91. The provision of Section 33 A of R.P. Act defines as under:
[33A. Right to information.--(1) A candidate shall, apart from any information which
he is required to furnish, under this Act or the rules made thereunder, in his
nomination paper delivered under sub-Section (1) of Section 33, also furnish the
information as to whether--
(i) he is accused of any offence punishable with imprisonment for two years or more
in a pending case in which a charge has been framed by the court of competent
jurisdiction;
(ii) he has been convicted of an offence [other than any offence referred to in
sub-Section (1) or sub-Section (2), or covered in sub-Section (3), of Section 8] and
sentenced to imprisonment for one year or more.
(2) The candidate or his proposer, as the case may be, shall, at the time of delivering
to the returning officer the nomination paper under sub-Section (1) of Section 33,
also deliver to him an affidavit sworn by the candidate in a prescribed form verifying
the information specified in sub-Section (1).
(3) The returning officer shall, as soon as may be after the furnishing of information
to him under sub-Section (1), display the aforesaid information by affixing a copy of
the affidavit, delivered under sub-Section (2), at a conspicuous place at his office for
the information of the electors relating to a constituency for which the nomination
paper is delivered.]
92. As per Rule 4A of the conduct of Election Rules defines as under:
"4A Form of affidavit to be filed at the time of delivering nomination paper - the
candidate or his proposal, as the case may be, shall, at the time of delivering to the
returning officer, the nomination paper under Sub-section (1) of 33 of the Act, also
delivered to him an affidavit sworn by the candidate before the Magistrate of the First
Class or Notary in Form No.26".
93. In this regard, the learned counsel for the petitioner has contended that it is the duty of the
candidate who contest for the election shall mention all the information to the Returning Officer in
the affidavit and in turn, it should be published to the public domain in order to the voters to excise
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128202297/ 48
Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
their voting right in favour of the candidate. But here in this case, the respondent No.1 not furnished
the entire details of his assets and liabilities, investments including the bank balances and most of
the information given by him were wrong information. Therefore, it is held, the information
submitted by respondent No.1 in Form No.26 is in contravention of Section 33A of R.P. Act and
Rule 4A of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961. Hence, answered Issue No.9 in E.P.No.1/2019 and
Issue No.2 in E.P.No.2/2019 in the AFFIRMATIVE in favour of the petitioners.
94. Issue No.10 in E.P.No.2/2019 Whether the petitioner proves the election expenses incurred by
respondent No.1 was beyond the limit fixed as stated in paragraph Nos.21 and 27 of the Election
Petition? In order to prove the said allegation, the petitioner in E.P.No.2/2019 has contended the
respondent has incurred more than Rs.1,40,000/- towards printing the pamphlets more than
25,000 in his favour when the said pamphlets were transported in two KSRTC buses and a car
which were seized by the Hirisave Police and registered two Crime cases Nos.24/2019 and 26/2019
and seized more than 15 bundles of pamphlets. In order to prove the said contention, the petitioner
has produced and marked Exs.P.21 and P.22. PW.1-the petitioner in the cross examination, except
denial, the learned counsel for the respondent nothing elicited to disbelieve the evidence. On the
other hand, the respondent himself examined as R.W.1 and he has deposed that he is not aware
about seizing of 15 bundles of pamphlets in K.S.R.T.C. buses and FIR was registered against some
other persons and he is not the accused in the said cases and the suggestion was made to R.W.1 that
after winning the election, they influenced the police and got filed the 'B' Final report.
95. On perusal of Exs.P.21 and P.22 reveals that the Hirisave Police registered two FIRs and seized
15 and 11 bundles containing 25,000 pamphlets for transporting the pamphlets pertaining to this
respondent and admittedly, this respondent name was not there in the FIR, but the President of JDS
Party, Hassan was the accused and the said pamphlet was printed for the purpose of election
campaigning of the respondent. Therefore, this amount of Rs.1,40,000/- should be considered as
his election expenditures. But the same was not properly declared by him in his election expenditure
account to the Election Commission of India in the Ex.P.23 produced by the petitioner and Ex.R.32
marked by the respondent.
96. The petitioners have also deposed that the respondent declared the expenditure of pamphlets,
posters, hand bills and banners that he has spent Rs.5,78,310/- whereas, the value of the pamphlets
seized by the Police in the Bus itself is Rs.6,50,000/- and Rs.3,00,000/-. The voters slip would cost
Rs.3,00,000/- but the same was not properly declared by the respondent. As already held above, the
expenditures for hand bills or the pamphlets seized from two KSRTC buses and the car, more than
25,000 pamphlets, the expenditure were not declared and the voters slips supplied by the
respondent near the polling booth also not properly calculated apart from the other amenities used
for polling day. Therefore, in this regard, there is no proper evidence adduced by the respondent for
spending the meager amount declared by him.
97. As regards to the expenditure incurred by the respondent towards the Helicopter charges for
doing election campaign through star campaigners where the respondent has spent huge amount for
the purpose of rent paid for visit of former Prime Minister Sri H.D. Devegowda and the then former
Chief Minister Sri Siddaramaiah who came to Arasikere, Arakalagud and Hallimysuru on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128202297/ 49
Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
11.04.2019. The respondent not included the rent and expenditures in the expenditure account in
Ex.R.32. In order to prove the said contention, the petitioner has examined himself as witness and
got marked at Ex.P.23 wherein the summary report regarding expenses accounted by the candidate.
Wherein, the respondent has shown the expenditures as Rs.63,14,197/-. The abstract of the
expenditures declared by respondent No.2 where the Helicopter expenditures were shown as NIL.
Whereas the petitioner has produced documents and deposed that the respondent has spent more
than Rs.14,00,000/- towards the Helicopter expenses and the respondent also got marked as
Exs.R.33 and 34 that the list of star campaigners in JDS party as well as Congress party.
98. PW.1 further deposed that the then Chief Minister Sri.H.D.Kumarswamy, his wife Smt.Anitha
Kumaraswamy and their son Sri.Nikhil Kumaraswamy have visited Holenarasipura by Helicopter
and the said amount was not declared by the respondent and also contended that the former Prime
Minister and Chief Minister's helicopter expenses is also not declared by him. In response to the
allegation, the respondent examined and he has stated in his evidence that he is not aware about
declaring the list of leaders as star campaigners in both the political alliance of the JDS and
Congress and denied that the former Chief Minister Sri H.D.Kumaraswamy was not at all came for
campaigning but it was their private visit and therefore, not necessary. But the respondent admitted
that he has obtained the permission of the Deputy Commissioner for landing of Helicopter to Kadur
Town where the Former Prime Minister Sri H.D. Devegowda and the then former Chief Minister Sri
Siddaramaiah campaigned at Kadur and he has stated, they are the star campaigners and therefore,
as per Schedule 1 in Sl.No.11, the expenditures of Star campaigners not required to be declared. But
in Ex.R.32(a), the respondent has stated the expenditures on star campaigners by Helicopter
mentioned as NIL. Though, RW.1 further stated the helicopter came to Kadur, but while going back
to Hassan, the helicopter was stopped at Gandsi due to bad weather and they went by car and he
also admitted that he has obtained the permission for landing of the helicopter at Holenarasipura
and Arasikere and denied that helicopter expenditures was Rs.17,40,000/-. But the fact remains, as
per Ex.R.32(a), the abstract of the expenditures, the respondent has shown, there is no amount
spent on the helicopter for star campaigners. The respondent also not stated what was the actual
amount spent for helicopter expenditures for star campaigning. Exs.R.35 and R.35(a) are the
permission accorded by the Deputy Commissioner for landing of helicopter. But not a single
document produced by the respondent that he has spent amount towards the helicopter rent and he
is entitled for exemption in respect of said helicopter expenditure. Thereby, the petitioner is
successful in proving that the respondent not declared the helicopter expenses of more than
Rs.17,00,000/- in his Ex.P.23 or Ex.R.32 (both the documents are one and the same).
99. The petitioner also stated that the respondent has shown the expenditure for food, refreshment,
tea, juices etc., as Rs.42,950/- but the respondent actually spent more than Rs.13,41,000/- towards
the expenditure as respondent No.1 conducted large scale election campaign. Two election
campaigns which comes under 8 Legislative constituency of Hassan Lok Sabha constituency and
spent Rs.15 to 16 lakhs per campaign for distribution of Milk, food and LED expenditures including
pendals, chairs etc., But the respondent declared meager amount. Though the respondent has stated
that Rs.42,950/- spent on refreshment, but there is no document produced before the Court as
breakup wise expenditures spent by him for the purpose of two star campaigning large scale
meetings, the expenditure cannot be Rs.42,000/-, it must be more than lakhs of rupees. Therefore, I
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128202297/ 50
Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
hold, the respondent has not properly declared the expenditures spent on food and refreshments.
100. The next contention of the petitioners are that the respondent declared expenditures on
vehicles as Rs.12,60,860/- for engaging the auto rickshaw, cars, Bolero jeeps for campaigning as per
Schedule 5 in Ex.R.32. Whereas the petitioner has contended that the respondent has spent more
than Rs.15,45,875/- towards the vehicle expenditures, but it was suppressed by the respondent and
stated that the Deputy Commissioner himself has declared the rate fixed for the different vehicles in
different rates, but the respondent has found very meager amount per day for a vehicle, thereby, he
has not properly declared the actual expenditures. Learned counsel for the petitioner has stated that
the Deputy Commissioner as per the Notification No.ELN(1)100/2018-19 has fixed Rs.5,000/- per
day for Innova vehicle and for different categories of vehicle, different rates were fixed as minimum
rental rates. But the respondent used 34 different types of cars along with 57 three wheeler auto
rickshaws. On calculation, it comes, the respondent has spent more than Rs.19,90,000/- but he has
declared only Rs.11,32,000/- thereby, more than Rs.8,57,000/- differs from actual expenditures.
Though, the respondent has produced the Notification issued by the Deputy Commissioner, but
there is no authenticated document produced by the respondent, however, the expenditure
mentioned by the petitioner in Schedule 5 of expenditure is not correct and no auto rickshaw or taxi
persons provided their vehicles less than the amount fixed by the Deputy Commissioner, therefore, I
am of the view, that the petitioner proves the vehicle expenditures declared by the respondent was
not correct.
101. The another contention of the petitioner is that the respondent has spent more than
Rs.22,00,000/- towards the polling booth, agent expenses and Rs.56,000/- towards the counting
day expenses. It is contended by the petitioner that the respondent declared the expenditures
towards the said expenditure as NIL, but in fact, the respondent has shown and declared
Rs.96,000/- towards the candidates booth set up for distribution of voters slip for voters for
Rs.90,000/-, food expenses Rs.6,000/-. Whereas the petitioner has calculated that the amount was
more than Rs.22,00,000/- as there were 2,235 booths and if 2 persons per booth, if they paid
Rs.500/- per head, it comes to Rs.22,35,000/- and even if the expenditure for food and other
expenditures considered for two booth agents and it would be Rs.56,000/-. Though the respondent
declared Rs.96,000/- but there is no proper accounts to that effect and no evidence adduced by the
respondent before this Court and even, if a person received Rs.200/- per head, it could be more than
Rs.4,47,000/- and counting agents for 8 round tables, there must be at least Rs.25,000/- but the
respondent declaring Rs.96,000/- is very meager and the said expenditures declared by him
appears to be not correct.
102. As regards to the other expenditures spent by the respondent regarding amount spent on
advertisement through newspapers and T.V. channels, the petitioner has contended that the
respondent not declared any amount spent by him towards the advertisement in the News channels
both print and electronic media. Whereas the petitioner has contended that the respondent given
advertisement in Praja Vani Newspaper and spent Rs.50,000/- as per Exs.P.54 and P.55, towards
the Vijaya Karnataka Newspaper he has spent Rs.89,250/- as per Exs.P.56 and P.58, towards Vijaya
Vani Newspaper, he has spent Rs.1,14,07,290/- as per Ex.P.62, a bill for Rs.51,08,784/- and another
bill as per Ex.P.62(a) for Rs.62,48,756/- and as per Ex.P.62(b) was Rs.10,49,750/-, towards the

Kannada Prabha Newspaper Rs.6,75,001/- as per Exs.P.63 and P.64(a) and P.64(c), but the

enlarging the hand bill of JDS and requisition might have received by his office and he has to verify

104. PW21- Logan a Dy.Manager of Vijay Karnataka also deposed that on 16.4.2019 an
advertisement was given by the respondent JDS which was published as per Ex.p56 and P56A, The
certificate issued by their office is P57 and P58 is advertisement release order and they have charged
Rs.44625/- towards the advertisement charges and in the cross examination it is suggested the

for the JDS candidates. Therefore, the petitioner successfully proving the allegation that the
respondent spent more than a crore rupees on paper advertisement but not declared in Ex.P23 or
R32.
108. As regards to the amount spent by the respondent by own fund for Rs.15,05,000/-, his party
had spent Rs.40,00,000/- and his father spent Rs.14,00,000/- these 3 amounts were reflected in
the bank account extract of the respondent which was open for election expenditures. He has
declared in Part 3 of the expenditures Ex.R.32 which was shown in the Schedule 9. Though the
respondent No.1 has contended he has spent Rs.15,05,000/- by his own fund and Rs.40,00,000/-
spent by his party and Rs.14,00,000/- by his father were all subsequent to the election and he has
declared in the election expenditure. It is not necessary to discuss much, it has to be looked into by
the Election Commission of India and the Income Tax Authorities whether he has declared in his
Income Tax Returns after the concerned years.
109. Accordingly, I hold the petitioner has proved that the expenditure limit was fixed by the
Election Commission of India was Rs.70,00,000/- whereas the respondent spent more than crores
of rupees than Rs.70,00,000/- but he has declared only Rs.63,00,000/-
hence answered the Issue No.10 in the AFFIRMATIVE in favour of the petitioner and against the
respondent.
110. Issue No.7 in E.P.No.1/2019 Whether the petitioner proves that the acceptance of the
nomination papers of the respondent No.1 by the Returning Officer is improper?
and Whether the petitioner proves that the acceptance of the nomination of respondent No.1 by the
Returning Officer is illegal? Both the above issues are common in both petitions, hence, taken
together for discussing in order to avoid repetitions.
111. The petitioner also contended that the amounts mentioned in the Form No.26 regarding
ownership of the property, Assets and Liabilities which are patently erroneous and amounts to
defect of substantial character and nomination should have been rejected. Learned Senior Counsel
for the petitioner submitted even though the petitioner E.P.No.1/2019 raised objection regarding
the false information submitted by respondent No.1 in form No.26 but the Returning Officer without
proper verification overruled the objections and accepted the nomination paper.
112. The Income Tax declaration made by the respondent No.1 is for only one year, even though the
law requires 5 years past Income Tax returns. The evidence of the respondent No.1 and properties
owned by him all reveals that he has huge property which has been purchased by him for last 10

Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
years but he has not paid any Income Tax even though he was having sufficient income and balance
amount in his Bank account. But he has evaded tax and paid tax only for one year prior to the filing
of the nomination for contesting election. But there were lakhs of rupees transacted by him but he
has not filed any income tax returns and paid any income tax to the State. Therefore, the declaration
made by the respondent in the form NO.26 is not correct information and all false statement
regarding assets and liabilities, income etc.,
113. On perusal of the acceptance of nomination by the Returning Officer the Ex.P3 was the
objection raised by the petitioner against the nomination of the respondent and Ex.P4 is the
acceptance of nomination by the Returning Officer. In the Ex.P3 the petitioner/ A.Manju raised the
objection in detail regarding investments in Chennambika convention hall, bonds, investment in the
firm and he has stated the material information has been not disclosed by the respondent No.1.
Therefore, request for rejecting the nomination paper but the Returning Officer failed to consider
the objection raised by the petitioners and wrongly accepted the nomination which is against the
law, hence, the Senior Counsels for the petitioners have contended that the acceptance of the
nomination of the respondent No.1 is liable to be set aside.
114. In this regard, the petitioner counsel produced the hand book manual prescribing the procedure
to be followed by the Returning Officer. The respondent counsel has contended that the Returning
Officer following the hand book even if the prescribed affidavit not been filed, the nomination paper
should not be rejected on that ground. On this background, it is worth to mention that the
guidelines issued by the Election Commission of India in Hand Book for Returning Officer
prescribes the grounds for rejection of nomination paper at 6.10.(IV) as under:
"6.10(IV): The prescribed affidavit has not been filed at all by the candidate, or (NB if
the prescribed affidavit has been filed but are alleged or found to be defective or
containing false information, the nomination should not be rejection on this ground."
115. On perusal of the said guidelines, of course, the Returning Officer may not have sufficient time
for verifying all those objections made by the petitioner against the affidavit filed by the respondent
at the time of scrutiny but as per the guidelines, he has formally accepted the nomination and now it
is under scrutiny by this Court.
116. In view of my findings against the respondent No.1 in respect of Issue No.2 in E.P.No.2/2019
that the respondent No.1 filed the nomination paper and its enclosures in contravention to Section
33 A of the R.P. Act and Rule 4A of the Conduct Rules and the respondent No.1 involved in corrupt
practices in misusing the official position diverting the CNNL Funds and other corrupt practices has
been proved by the petitioners and wrong declarations suppressing the material facts, non filing the
income taxes, not declaring the proper income, assets and liabilities and non disclosure of his
income from the Chennambika Convention Hall, amount spent on construction on Chennambika
Convention Hall, partner in the said Chennambika Convention Hall, profit from the Chennambika
Convention Hall, it was brought to the notice by the petitioner in E.P.No.1/2019 by way of objection,
but the Returning Officer / Deputy Commissioner accepted the nomination of the respondent No.1
is improper and illegal, thereby the nomination paper of the respondent No.1 ought to have rejected
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128202297/ 54
Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
by the Returning Officer, but it is not done by the Returning Officer and the petitioner were
successful in proving the fact and the affidavit Form No.26 of the respondent No.1 is not in
accordance with law. Therefore, the acceptance of the nomination is liable to be set aside.
Accordingly, I answered Issue No.7 in E.P.No.1/2019 and Issue No.1 in E.P.No.2/2019 in the
AFFIRMATIVE in favour of the petitioners and against respondent No.1.
117. Issue No.11 in E.P.No.2/2019 Whether the petitioner proves that the discrepancies in the
information given by the respondent No.1 is a corrupt practice and the same has affected the free
exercise of courts by the voters?
In view of my findings in respect of Issue Nos.1, 2 and 5 against the respondent that the nomination
of the respondent is in contravention of the Section 33 of the R.P. Act, non disclosure of material
facts required to be mentioned in Form No.26 which amounts to violation of Sections 33 to 36 and
100 of R.P. Act and the information given by the respondent regarding various defects like assets
and liabilities, bank accounts, details of sources of income etc. in the affidavit Form No.26 and not
giving proper information to the voters in order to know about their candidates for voting or for free
exercise of votes by the voters.
118. The learned counsel for the petitioner in E.P.No.1/2019 relied upon the judgment of Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of KRISHNAMURTHY Vs. SHIVAKUMAR AND OTHERS reported in
(2015) 3 SCC 467, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that concealment or suppression of fact
regarding criminal cases and non disclosure of material facts will create an impediment in the free
excise of electorate. Non disclosure of the fact amounts to undue influence and therefore, election is
to be declared as null and void.
119. The learned counsel also relied upon the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
LOKPRAHARI THROUGH GENERAL SECRETARY S.N.SUKLA Vs. UNION OF INDIA AND
OTHERS reported in (2018) 4 SCC 699, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held the contesting
candidate shall furnish the information regarding sources of income and their associates which
would help the voters to make informed choice and hence, is a part of fundamental right which
required to be informed under Form No.26. The non disclosure of assets and sources of income of
candidates and their associates which constitute corrupt practice amounting to undue influence
since it is attempt to suppress, misguide and keep people in the dark.
120. In another judgment in the case of KISAN SHANKAR KATHORI Vs. ARUN DATTATREY
SAWANTH AND OTHERS reported in (2014) 14 SCC 162, the Hon'ble Supreme Court also held
article 19(1a) of the Constitution of India, the voters right to know assets and liabilities of contesting
candidate and non disclosure in respect of share in the firm is serious and major lapse. The affidavit
given by the candidates in the Nomination form, material information about the assets was not
disclosed, the election of the candidate has to be set aside.
121. Learned counsel for the petitioner in E.P.No.2/2019 also relied upon the same judgments of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court. Here in this case, the petitioner not disclosed the all assets and liabilities
evading the income tax, borrowing loans, income from the Chennambika Convention Hall,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128202297/ 55
Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
expenditure on the construction, market values on the assets of landed properties were all not
properly discloses. Balance in the bank account also not disclosed were all a corrupt practice and not
informed the true facts to the voters to exercise their votes, thereby, the voters were kept in dark and
which was affected exercising of their votes in favour of the petitioner. Hence, answered Issue No.11
in AFFIRMATIVE in favour of the petitioner and against the respondent No.1.
122. Issue No.11 in E.P.No.1/2019 Whether the petitioner proves that respondent No.1 has
suppressed the true income, assets and liabilities in Form No.26 which violates Section 33 A of the
R.P. Act and Rule 4A of Conduct of Election Rules and furnished false information which amounts
to the corrupt practice in terms of Section 123 of the R.P. Act, thereby election of respondent No.1 of
Hassan (General Parliamentary Constituency) and result declared on 23.5.2019 is held to be void
under Section 98 and Section 100(1)(d)(i) of R.P. Act?
and Whether the petitioner proves that non disclosure of material required in Form No.26 as
contemplated in the guidelines issued by Election Commission in the year 2006 amounts to
violation of Sections 33 to 36 and 100(1)(d)(i)(iv) of R.P. Act?
The above said issues in both the cases are similar, hence, taken the same for discussion in order to
avoid the repetition. The learned senior counsels for the petitioners in both cases has contended that
the respondent No.1 has not disclosed the assets and liabilities, sources of income and in spite of
raising objection by the petitioner and before the Returning Officer, the Returning Officer without
considering the same, wrongly accepted the nomination of respondent No.1. It is further contended
that respondent No.1 also involved in corrupt practices including the proxy voting, suppressing the
material facts, furnishing the wrong and incorrect information and violated the Conduct of Election
Rules and Section 33A of the R.P. Act, thereby, the election of respondent No.1 shall be declared as
void under Section 100(1)(d)(i) and (iv) of R.P. Act.
123. For the convenience, the provisions of Section 100(1)(d)(i) of the R.P. Act are referred as under:
(i) by improper acceptance or any nomination or (4) by any non compliance with the
provisions of Constitution or of this Act or of any Rules or Orders made under this
Act.
The High Court shall declare the election of the returning candidate to be void.
124. The petitioners in both the cases are successful in proving the fact that respondent No.1 has not
disclosed the real assets and liabilities, the value of the properties, the income from the business of
Chennambika Convention Hall. Further, the father of respondent No.1 misused the official position
as District In-charge Minister diverting the CNNL fund to various other development projects by
taking advantage of the uncle of respondent No.1 - the then Chief Minister, who was the Chairman
of CNNL and involved in corrupt practices including booth capturing, proxy voting, inducing the
voters by using the religion and carrying the money for distributing to the voters which was seized
by the flying squad, non-declaring the expenditure of election and other various issues against
respondent No.1 and also not giving proper information to the voters in order to make the voters to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128202297/ 56
Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
know about the candidates in free exercise of their votes and answering issue Nos.1, 2, 5 and 11
against respondent No.1 in E.P. No.2/2019 and issues proved by the petitioner in E.P.No.1/2019
against the respondent No.1, are all proved by the petitioners by examining the petitioners
themselves as witnesses and also examining the income tax officials, bank managers, CNNL
Director, and various other witnesses almost 23 witnesses thereby, both the petitioners successfully
proved that respondent No.1 violated Section 33A of R.P. Act and involved in corrupt practices and
violated the provisions and Rules under this Act. Thereby, the election of respondent No.1 shall be
declared as void. Hence, answered the above Issue No.11 in E.P. No.1/2019 and Issue No.6 in E.P.
No.2/2019 in the AFFIRMATIVE in favour of the petitioner and as against respondent No.1.
125. The learned Senior Counsel appearing for respondent No.1 has relied upon the judgment of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of MARKIO TADO V. TAKAM SORANG reported in (2013)7 SCC
524 wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the booth capturing involves the use of force,
whereas impersonation or double voting is on the basis of deception and the said ground was not
pleaded in the petition nor was any issue framed thereon for trial. But, herein this case, the
petitioner in E.P. No.2/2019 has pleaded that the respondent No.1, his father, who was the
In-charge Minister of the district, his mother and grand parents were all inside the polling booth
and not allowed the public to cast their votes, but taking some proxy voters through a gunman and
another person carrying fake voter I.D. cards, got casted the proxy votes in booth No.244. The same
has been pleaded in the petition and in this regard, issue No.5 was framed in E.P.No.2/2019 and the
same was proved by the petitioner by examining the witnesses, the Returning Officers, Deputy
Commissioner and by producing photographs, C.Ds., hard disc (M.O. Nos.1 to
3) and thereby, this Court has already answered the said issue in favour of the petitioner and against
respondent No.1. Therefore, the said contention of the learned Senior Counsel for the respondent, is
not acceptable.
126. The learned Senior Counsel for the respondent No.1 also relied upon the judgment of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of LIFE INSURANCE CORPORATION OF INDIA AND
ANOTHER VS. RAMPAL SINGH BISEN reported in 2010 (4) SCC 491 wherein the Hon'ble
Supreme Court has held that mere filing or exhibiting a document in Court does not amount to
proof of its contents, and admission of a document in court may amounts to admission of its
contents but not their truth, and further held that the documents having been produced and marked
as required under the Evidence Act cannot be relied upon by this Court. The Hon'ble Supreme Court
has also held that failure to prove the defence does not amount to an admission and failure to prove
the defence does not reverse or discharge the plaintiff's burden of proof. There is no second opinion
in respect of the principles laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the said case. Here, in these
cases, the petitioners have pleaded in the petitions about the corrupt practices by respondent No.1,
and accepting the nomination of the respondent No.1 was improper and they the petitioners
themselves lead the evidence and also examined 22 witnesses and produced the documents and
material objects, thereby they are successful in proving the issues framed by this Court. Therefore,
the aforesaid judgment will not come to the aid of respondent No.1.
127. Issue No.3 in E.P. No.2/2019:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128202297/ 57
Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
"(3) Whether the petitioner proves that as on the date of the election, respondent
No.1 was not eligible and qualified to be chosen to fill the seat of No.16 Hassan
Parliamentary Constituency?"
The petitioner has contended that as on the date of election, respondent No.1 was not eligible and
qualified to be chosen to fill the seat No.16 of Hassan Parliamentary Constituency. This Court
already held in issue No.1 against the respondent No.1 that there objection was raised by the
petitioner regarding suppression of material fact, non declaration of income tax, not disclosing the
assets and liabilities, suppressing the value of the landed properties in the nomination paper. The
very acceptance of the nomination by the Returning Officer has held as illegal in issue No.1.
Respondent No.1 purchased the landed properties in the year 2009 by paying the crores of rupees
without source of income and evaded the taxes. Though an objection was raised by the contesting
candidate- petitioner in E.P.No.1/2019 in this regard, the Returning Officer accepted the
nomination paper. Even otherwise, the learned senior counsel for the petitioner has contended that
the very nomination paper was not attested and signed by the petitioner in the declaration form and
it was kept blank, and also issue No.11 is answered against respondent No.1 and in favour of the
petitioner. Even though respondent No.1 was not eligible and qualified to be chosen to fill the
Hassan parliamentary constituency. In spite of it, the Returning Officer accepted the nomination.
Thereby the petitioner is successful in proving the said issue. Hence, answered Issue No.3 in
E.P.No.2/2019 in the AFFIRMATIVE.
128. Issue No.4 in E.P. No.2/2019:
(4) Whether the petitioner proves that the result of the election so far as respondent
No.1 is concerned has been materially affected by improper acceptance of his
nomination?
The petitioner has contended that the result of the election of respondent No.1 has been materially
affected by improper acceptance of his nomination. In this regard, the petitioner lead the evidence
as P.W.1 and raised objections regarding the suppression of material facts, wrong disclosure of the
assets and liabilities, non payment of taxes, wrong market value declared in the nomination form,
not declaring the liabilities as well as income, expenditure and loans and in spite of raising the
objection by the contesting candidate petitioner in E.P. No.1/2019, the Returning Officer accepted
the nomination paper. This Court has already held issue No.1 in E.P.No.2/2019 and issue No.7 in
E.P.No.1/2019 against the respondent No.1. In view of the illegal acceptance of the nomination of
respondent No.1, the result of the election was materially affected. The nomination of respondent
No.1 if rejected by the Returning Officer, the petitioner in E.P.No.1/2019 would have been returned
candidate in parliamentary Hassan constituency and because of acceptance of the nomination of
respondent No.1, the result of the election has been affected. Hence, answered Issue No.4 in
E.P.No.2/2019 in the AFFIRMATIVE.
129. Issue Nos.8 in E.P. No.2/2019:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128202297/ 58
Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
"8. Whether the petitioner proves that the votes counted in favour of respondent No.1
should be treated as wasted votes (thrown away votes) and reception of the said votes
in favour of respondent No.1 and counting the same is his favour is void?"
The petitioner has contended that in view of accepting the improper nomination of respondent No.1
by the Returning Officer, respondent No.1 involved in corrupt practices like amount carried for
distribution of voters, spending huge election expenditures, suppressing material facts, booth
capturing, proxy votes. Therefore, these corrupt practices were the cause for getting less votes by the
petitioner i.e., A. Manju in E.P.No.1/2019 who is respondent No.2 in E.P. No.2/2019.
130. The petitioner is successful in proving all the issues against respondent No.1 regarding corrupt
practices under Section 123 of the R.P. Act and improper acceptance of the nomination of
respondent No.1 by the Returning Officer and spending excess expenditure than the limit fixed by
the Election Commission of India. Even though the respondent No.1 secured 6,76,606 votes more
than 1,40,000 as against the petitioner, who secured 5,35,282 votes, but the votes secured by the
respondent No.1 shall be treated as the wasted votes and thrown away votes and the said secured
votes and counting those votes in favour of respondent No.1, is void. Hence, answered issue No.8 in
the AFFIRMATIVE.
131. Issue Nos.7 and 9 in E.P. No.2/2019 and issue Nos. 10 and 12 in E.P. No.1/2019 and
Recrimination Petition:
Whether the petitioner proves that the declaration of respondent No.1 as returned
candidate is void and whether he further proves that respondent No.2 has to be duly
declared as having been duly elected under Section 101 of R.P. Act?
Whether the petitioner proves that respondent No.2 has secured 5,32,282 number of
valid votes and respondent No.2 has to be declared as having been duly elected?
Whether respondent No.1 proves that the petitioner has also indulged in corrupt
practice by transporting the election materials unauthorisedly without taking
permission of the Returning Officer and thereby, many cases were registered by the
police and pending before the various Courts in Hassan District?"
Consequently, whether the petitioner is entitled to be declared as elected in place of
respondent No.1 to No.16 Hassan (General Parliamentary Constituency) as
enumerated in Section 98(c) of the R.P. Act?
These issues are taken together in order to avoid the repetition.
132. The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners in both cases strenuously contended that the
votes were secured by the respondent No.1 by way of illegal and corrupt practices and it is proved by
way of oral and documentary evidence, thereby, the votes secured by the petitioner in E.P.
No.1/2019 is to be declared as returned candidate as he has been duly elected as per Sections 98C
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128202297/ 59
Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
and 101 of R.P. Act. Of course, this Court also held and answered the issues against respondent No.1
regarding proving the illegal and improper acceptance of nomination, non disclosure of assets and
liabilities, income, avoiding income taxes, spending expenses more than the limit of Rs.70 lakhs
prescribed by the Election Commission of India. Therefore, the election of the respondent No.1
should be declared as void and he should be disqualified. However, the question is whether the
petitioner shall be declared as a winning candidate of the Hassan Parliamentary Constituency or
not?
133. In this regard, respondent No.1 filed a Recrimination Petition in E.P. No.1/2019 under section
97 of R.P. Act contending that the prayer of the petitioner that he shall be declared as the winning
candidate by setting aside the result of the respondent No.1 as an elected candidate shall not be
allowed. Learned Senior Counsel contended if the election of respondent No.1 is vitiated, even then,
the petitioner is not entitled for the relief of declaration that he should be declared as winning
candidate for the reason that the petitioner has also indulged in corrupt practices as under:
(i) The petitioner also filed false affidavit in Form No.26 along with nomination
paper.
(ii) The petitioner also suppressed the material facts regarding his income and
income of his spouse and criminal case pending against him.
(iii) The petitioner has contested to the post of Karnataka Legislative Assembly in
Arakalgud Constituency on 12.5.2019. In the affidavit, he has declared his income as
Rs.11,85,18,249/- and the income his wife as Rs.10,49,88,112/- in his affidavit.
But in the present nomination paper, he has shown his income as Rs.12,04,59,322/- and his wife's
income as Rs.2,20,06,488/- for the same assessment year 2017-18.
(iv) The petitioner also not declared the Criminal Case in PCR No.171/2018-19, C.C. No.420/2018
and pendency of the appeal before the High Court.
(v) The petitioner has also filed false affidavit stating that there is no criminal case, but he has
challenged the criminal case by filing Writ Petition No.16510/2018 pending in the High Court.
(vi) The petitioner has filed false affidavits for the year 2017-18 regarding his income and pendency
of the cases which is contrary to Section 33A of the R.P. Act and his nomination attracts Section
100(1)(d)(i) of the R.P. Act. The petitioner was guilty of wrong information, suppression of material
facts. Therefore, the election of the petitioner would have been declared as null and void.
134. Respondent No.1 further contended that there was meeting held during the election, a case was
registered in Crime No.65/2019 and a case is pending in Hassan JMFC Court. The respondent No.1
also filed a complaint before the District Election Officer against the petitioner for providing free
food to the voters and the petitioner also indulged in distributing the money to the voters. The cash
of Rs.2.00 lakhs was seized in a car along with pamphlets which is registered in a case in Crime
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128202297/ 60
Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
No.66/2019 pending in Hassan court. Another case is registered in Crime No.34/2019 in Arsikere
court for distributing the pamphlets, BJP symbol T-shirts, BJP flags. Therefore, prayed for rejecting
the prayer of the petitioner to be declared as Returned Candidate.
135. In this regard, the respondent No.1 in both the cases, has given the oral evidence and also
produced the documents Exs.R.1 and R.2 i.e. nomination filed by petitioner- A. Manju in
E.P.No.1/2019 for the parliamentary election and the affidavit Form No.26 which is marked as
Ex.R.1 and Ex.R.2 is the nomination filed by the same petitioner in Arakalgud Karnataka Legislative
Assembly constituency election in the year 2019 and contended that the affidavits filed in respect of
assets and income of the petitioner and his wife, are the false affidavits. Ex.R.1 reveals the income of
the petitioner for the financial year 2017-18 and as per his declaration, the amount was
Rs.12,04,59,322/- and the said petitioner filed in the affidavit in the M.L.A. election declaring his
income as Rs.11,86,16,249/- for the same year 2017-18. There is difference in both the figures and
affidavits filed in the year 2018-19 for the same financial year 2017-18. Likewise, the income of the
wife Thara Manju Gowda, declared in the parliamentary constituency in Ex.R.1 was shown as
Rs.2,20,08,488/- whereas in the M.L.A. Constituency election in Ex.R.2 the income of his wife was
shown as Rs.10,49,66,112/-. There is more than Rs.8.00 crores difference in the income of his wife.
Though the petitioner has stated in his evidence that due to escalation of the price of the assets, he
has mentioned like that, but for the same financial year 2017-18, there cannot be two different
figures in the value of the property or in the income. Therefore, it clearly reveals that the petitioner
A. Manju also filed a false affidavit before the Election Commission for contesting the parliamentary
election which definitely falls under the category of Section 100(1)(d) of R.P. Act, thereby the
respondent proved against the petitioner that petitioner has suppressed the material facts and filed
false affidavit.
136. As regards to another contention that there are criminal cases pending against the petitioner,
the petitioner has stated that only one case was registered which was already quashed by the High
Court in the writ petition.
137. On perusal of the evidence of the respondent and Ex.R.10 which reveals that a criminal case was
registered in Crime No.64/2019 on 10.04.2019 for the offence punishable under Sections 171H and
188 of the R.P. Act, but the petitioner contested the election by filing nomination on 25.03.2019,
which is prior to the registering the FIR in Crime No.64/2019 and the said case came to be quashed
by the High Court subsequently.
138. However, in Ex.R.11, another FIR was registered against the petitioner in Crime No.62/2019 on
05.04.2019. Subsequent to the filing nomination paper, a case in Crime No.66/2019 was registered
on 17.04.2019 by Hassan Extension police. Another case in Crime No.34/2019 at Javagal police was
registered on 17.4.2019 and a case in Crime No.65/2019 dated 14.4.2019 by Hassan extension
police, a case in Crime No.171/2018 on 4.4.2018 registered against him by Hassan city police which
was quashed by the High Court in W.P.No.16510/2018 under Ex.R.9 on 9.8.2021. Though the other
cases were registered after filing of nomination, but Crime No.171/2018 was registered during the
M.L.A. election which was challenged before the High Court in the year 2018 and the same was
quashed on 9.8.2021 which means that the said Writ Petition was pending before the High Court
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128202297/ 61
Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
while filing the nomination paper under Ex.R.1 on 25.3.2019, but the same was not disclosed by the
petitioner which amounts to suppression of material facts by the petitioner also. Thereby,
respondent No.1 proves that the petitioner also indulged in corrupt practice and suppressed the case
pending against him. Hence, I hold that respondent No.1 proved issue No.10 as against the
petitioner in E.P. No.1/2019. Hence, the said issue in the AFFIRMATIVE in favour of the
respondent No.1 and as against the petitioner in E.P. No.1/2019.
139. In view of the registering of various cases against the petitioner during M.L.A. election held in
the year 2018 and subsequently, after filing of the nomination in the Hassan Parliamentary
Constituency election and he was also involved in corrupt practices by distributing the BJP symbol
caps, T-shirts, 'OM' symbols, dresses, and seizure of the cash by the flying squad, there are various
cases registered against him during the Hassan constituency election campaign. Therefore, even if
the respondent No.1 is disqualified in view of the proving the case by the petitioner, but the
petitioner - A. Manju is also involved in corrupt practices, suppression of material facts, regarding
income and pending cases, and he also cannot be declared as returned candidate and he is unfit to
be declared as Returned Candidate of Hassan constituency, as prayed by the petitioner in his
petition in E.P.No.1/2019 and the prayer cannot be allowed as prayed under Section 98 C of the R.P.
Act. Likewise, the prayer of the petitioner in E.P. No.2/2019 for declaring the petitioner
[E.P.No.1/2019 (who is the respondent No.2 in E.P.No.2/2019)] as duly elected under Section 101 of
R.P.Act cannot be granted.
140. Apart from that, it is unfortunate that the petitioner in E.P. No.1/2019 contested from BJP and
has filed this petition against the respondent No.1 who has contested from Janatha Dal Secular
political party. When the election petitions were pending and during the course of final arguments,
the election of Karnataka Legislative Assembly was declared in March 2023, and the JDS political
party offered an MLA ticket to the petitioner A. Manju, and it was published in the paper. Hence, the
petitioner A. Manju was summoned to the court along with the counsel and he appeared before the
Court and submitted that the ticket was offered by the JDS party but he is still in the BJP party, but
subsequently, the petitioner jumped to the JDS Party, took the ticket for Arakalgud constituency
and he was elected as MLA.
141. It is also seen from the evidence of the petitioner in E.P. No.2/2019 - Devaraje Gowda, who is a
party worker in BJP and a practicing Advocate who also contested in the subsequent MLA election
under BJP political party and who has deposed before the court that the petitioner - A. Manju and
himself were working for the congress political party in Karnataka and they were opposing the JDS
political party and both of them left the congress party, because the congress party made an alliance
with the JDS party in the year 2018. Therefore, both of them came to BJP and the petitioner
contested the MP election in the year 2019 at Hassan constituency as BJP candidate. But the
petitioner - A. Manju forgetting all his previous enmities between Congress and JDS and
intentionally by ignoring the pending of this election petition, he himself joined to the JDS party,
during the pendency of this petition with the intention to help respondent No.1 and the petitioner
has shown his hostility towards his party and ignored the pendency of his own case filed against the
respondent No.1 (belongs to JDS) and he in the lust for power for the post of M.L.A./M.P. he
jumped from one party to other party. Such a person has no legal right to declare himself to be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128202297/ 62
Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
elected candidate as Member of Parliament for Hassan constituency and in view of the petitioner A.
Manju involved in corrupt practice, he is not deserving candidate to be elected as winning candidate
either under Section 98(c) or 101 of the R.P. Act. Apart from that, as per the judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court, when there were only 2 candidates who contested, then only the Court can declare
the petitioner as elected as returned candidate and not when there were more than 2 candidates.
Herein, in this case, there are more than 2 candidates, this petitioner and respondent No.1 in
E.P.No.1/2019. In view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
MUNIRAJUGOWDA B.M. VS.
MUNIRATHNA AND OTHERS reported in 2020 (10) SCC 192. Hence, Issue Nos.7 and 9 in
E.P.No.2/2019 and Issue No.12 in E.P.No.1/2019 are answered in the NEGATIVE against
petitioners in both cases and the relief sought by them to declare the petitioner A. Manju as the
winning candidate is to be rejected and the Recrimination Petition filed by respondent No.1
deserved to be allowed.
142. Issue No.12 in E.P. No.2/2019:
Whether the respondent No.1 proves that the election petition is liable to be
dismissed for non compliance of Section 81(3) of R.P. Act?
The respondent has filed statement of objections and also an application for rejecting
the petition for non-compliance and filing the defective election petition.
143. Though this issue is framed by this Court in E.P.No.2/2019, but there are no such issues framed
in E.P.No.1/2019. However, respondent No.1 filed separate interlocutory application for dismissing
both the petitions for non compliance and both the petitioners had approached Hon'ble Supreme
Court and the Hon'ble Supreme Court set aside the order of dismissal and remanded the matter
back for trial, however, permitted the respondent to raise grounds in the trial. Subsequently, this
Court took up the case for trial and framed issues.
144. Respondent No.1 has contended that Section 81(1) of R.P. Act mandates that the election
petition should be filed within 45 days from the date of election of the returned candidate, Section
81(3) specifies every election petition shall be accompanied as many copies of election petitions and
every such copy shall be attested by the petitioner under his own signature to be true copies of the
petition. Respondent No.1 further contended that as per Section 83(2) of R.P. Act, any schedule or
annexures to the petition should also be signed by the petitioner and verified in the same manner as
in the petition. It is further contended that as per Section 86(1) of the R.P. Act, that the High Court
shall dismiss the election petition which does not comply the provisions of Sections 81, 82 or 117 of
the R.P. Act. It is further contended that respondent No.1 was declared as returned candidate on
23.5.2019 and the petitions have to be filed within 45 days from 23.5.2019 i.e. on or before 6.7.2019,
but the petitions came to be filed with full of fundamental defects to the root of the matter. It is also
contended that objection was raised by the office and later, it was complied. By that time, it was 66
days. Therefore, petitions are barred by limitation and it cannot be said that it was filed within 45
days.

Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
145. In support of his contention, the learned Senior Counsel for respondent No.1 relied upon the
judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court as well as the judgment of Bombay High Court and the
judgments of the Co-ordinate Bench of this Court.
146. Per contra, learned Senor Counsel for the petitioner in E.P.No.1/2019 contended that the office
objections are complied as per the time granted by the court and there is no delay in filing the
petition as the petition was filed within 45 days. and the Hon'ble Supreme Court has already set
aside the order of dismissal on technical grounds. Therefore, prayed for allowing the petition.
147. The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner in E.P.No.2/2019 has contended that there is no
delay in filing the petition, the petition was filed on 6.7.2019 and the matter was placed before the
Court and a week's time was granted for complying the office objections and the office objections
were complied as per the direction of this Court. It is contended that as per Rule 10 of the Karnataka
High Court Rules, the office can grant 3 days time for curing the defect or the time granted by the
Judge. Accordingly, this Court granted time and objection was complied by the petitioner. Therefore
absolutely, there is no non- compliance or defect in the petition. Therefore, on that ground, the
petition cannot be dismissed.
148. Having heard the rival arguments of learned counsel for the parties, perused the records.
149. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of SATYA NARAIN Vs. DHUJA RAM reported in
1974(4) SCC 237, has upheld the dismissal order passed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court
wherein the said High Court dismissed the petition on the ground that the requisite number of spare
copies of the petition were not filed and the defect was not cured within limitation. It is further held
that, in the absence of any provision of the Act or the Rules made there under, the High Court Rules
cannot confer upon Registrar or Deputy Registrar to permit correction or removal of defect in a
election petition and the petition presented beyond the limitation. The same view was taken by
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of SHARIF-UD-DIN Vs. ABDUL GANI LONE reported in
1980(1) SCC 403.
150. The Bombay High Court in the reported case in 2018 SCC online Bombay 175 in the case of
GILBERT JOHN MENDONCA Vs. NARENDRA LALCHANDJI MEHTA has held that if the defects
are not cured within 45 days, the election petition is liable to be dismissed. In the case of
LACHHMAN DAS ARORA Vs. GANESHI LAL reported in 1999(8) SCC 532 and in the case of AJAY
GUPTA vs. RAJU reported in 2016(14) SCC 314, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the law of
limitation has to be applied with all its vigor, and the Courts and Tribunals cannot extend the period
of limitation in respect of election petition. In the case of C. KANNAN Vs. RETURNING OFFICER
reported in ILR 1989 KAR 1081, it has been held that if the mandatory requirements of Section
83(1) and (2) of R.P. Act are not complied, the election petition is liable to be dismissed.
151. The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner in E.P. No.2/2019 contended that there is no
defect in the petition. The learned Senior Counsel for respondent No.1 has contended that :
(i) Annexures are signed and verified by the petitioner and there is original signature;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128202297/ 64
Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
(ii) Every copy of petition to be attested as true copy by the petitioner under his
original signature;
(iii) Annexures to be verified.
152. Though the learned Senior Counsel for respondent No.1 has contended that the prescribed
security deposit was not made etc., but on perusal of the petition, it was filed on 6.7.2019 at 12.45
p.m., and the petitioner produced the certificate of scrutiny and cost deposit of Rs.2,000/- along
with 1+3 copies and 6 copies of respondent.
153. On perusal of the check slip of the office, which reveals that in respect of presentation along
with the copies, payment of deposit, answered as 'yes' and the petition was presented as per the
Rules.
154. Sl.No.2 also stated as 'yes', petition filed within the period of limitation., Sl. Nos.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
are stated as 'yes'. Sl. No.9, if any schedule for annexure filed with petition, if so signed or verified,
for that it is stated 'no' and each page of the annexures to be signed by the petitioner in the main
petition along with 3 copies, for that it is mentioned by the office that on 19.7.2019, the petitioner
signed and verified all the annexures as per the date given by this Court.
155. As regards to Sl.No.10, 11, 12, 13, 14, there is no defect in the petition.
In respect of Sl.No.15 - the signing of the petition by the petitioner, the office has stated that the
petitioner has complied.
In respect of Sl.No.16, it is also complied. In respect of Sl.No.17, it is stated that the affidavit in form
No.25 should be filed. For that the office has endorsed that the affidavit filed along with the petition
itself, therefore, it is complied and thereby, there is no defect.
Sl.No.18 to 20 stated as 'Yes'.
In respect of Sl.No.21, translation required to be filed.
156. In respect of other objections, the office made endorsement that the petitioner has complied all
the office objections and the objections at Sl.Nos.22(3), 22(4), 22(5), 22(6), 22(8), 22(9), 22(10),
22(15) and 22(16) are complied on 15.7.2019 itself.
The office has also endorsed that all the English translation also filed in respect of Sl.No.14.
157. Rule 10 of The Karnataka High Court Election Rules, reads as under:
"10. Immediately after the time fixed for the removal of objections, the petition shall
be placed before the Judge for such orders as may be required to be passed under
section 86 of the Act. If the petition is not dismissed under sub- section(1) of section
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128202297/ 65
Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
86 of the Act, a summons on the direction of the Judge, shall be issued to the
respondents to appear before the High Court on a date specified in the summons and
answer the claim or claims made in the petition. Such date shall not be earlier than
three weeks from the date of the issue of the summons. The summons shall be for
written-statement and settlement of issues and shall be served by sending the
summons to the respondent to the address given by the petitioner by registered post
prepaid for acknowledgement."
On reading of Rule 10 of The Karnataka High Court Election Rules, it clearly provides that, if any
defect or error, the objection should be brought to the notice of the party or advocate, and it shall be
removed within 3 days, and thereafter, the office objection shall be cured within further time as
extended by the Judge.
158. In this case, the petitioners have complied the office objections and on perusal of the order
sheet of this Court, dated 26.07.2019 it is observed as under:
" The office objection relating to production of full edition of news paper at
Annexures Z1, Z2, Z3 and Z4 is kept open. All other objections are complied.
Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner.
Perused the petition requirements of Sections 81 and 82 are satisfied in terms of Rule
10 of the Election Petition Rules, dated 28.3.1967.
Issue summons to the respondent to appear before the court on 19.8.2019 in person
or through advocate to answer the claims made in the petition and also to submit the
written statement and for the settlement of issues.
List this matter on 19.8.2019."
159. On reading the aforesaid order sheet, the petitioners have categorically stated that all the
objections are complied, production of news paper is kept open and after the satisfaction, the
summons were issued. However, subsequently, the respondent filed an application for dismissal of
the petition for non compliance of office objection and hence, the petition came to be dismissed,
later, the same was set aside by the Hon'ble Supreme Court and remitted the matter back.
Therefore, in my considered view, there is no defect in the petition under Section 81(3) of the R.P.
Act and the petition cannot be dismissed on the ground that the petition was barred by limitation.
Therefore, the contention of the learned Senior Counsel for respondent No.1 cannot be acceptable.
160. Though there is no issue framed in respect of limitation, but the respondent's counsel argued
that the petition was filed within 45 days and it was filed with defects. However, the check slip of the
office reveals that there were some errors, but the same was rectified by the petitioner's counsel
within the prescribed time and subsequently, this Court held on 26.7.2019 that the petitioner
complied the office objection and the petition is in accordance with requirements of Sections 81 and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128202297/ 66
Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
82 of R.P. Act and in terms of Rule 10 of Election Petition Original Rules (28.3.1967). Therefore,
summons were issued to respondents. Subsequently, the petition came to be dismissed by this Court
and the same was set aside by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in SLP and remanded the matter back.
Therefore, the petition cannot be dismissed as barred by limitation.
161. The learned Senior counsel for the petitioner in E.P.No.2/2019 has relied upon the judgment of
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of CHANDRAKANT UTTAM CHODANKAR VS.
DAYANAND RAYU MANDRAKAR AND OTHERS reported in AIR 2005 SC 547, wherein, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that copies of alleged election petition have been supplied by the
Registry of High Court to the learned counsel for the respondent / Returned candidate were one
which were not submitted by the Election petitioners for service of copies supplied and rejection of
the Election petition is not correct, when the true copies of the same were duty supplied to the
respondent. It is also held that a defective verification is not fatal to the maintainability of the
petition. Therefore, the Election Petition cannot be dismissed on the ground that there was defect in
the petition.
162. Though the learned Senior Counsel for respondent No.1 relied upon various judgments in
respect of the merits of the case that without pleading, no amount of evidence can be looked into,
the booth capturing shall be proved beyond reasonable doubt, etc., but this Court found that there is
pleading and evidence, both oral as well as documentary in order to show that there was corrupt
practice, suppression of facts and non payment of taxes, and various allegation made in the petition
has been proved by the petitioner especially in E.P. No.2/2019. Therefore, the arguments of learned
Senior Counsel for respondent No.1 cannot be acceptable for dismissing the petition. Hence
answered the Issue No.12 in E.P.No.2/2019 in the NEGATIVE.
163. The learned Senior counsel for the respondent has relied upon the judgment of Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of R.P.MOIDUTTY VS. P.T.KUNJU MOHAMMAD AND ANOTHER
reported in (2000) 1 SCC 481, where the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the election of the
successful candidate is not to be set aside lightly until the case was proved by the petitioners in
accordance with law.
164. In another judgment in the case of M.J. JACOB VS. A.NARAYANAN AND OTHERS reported in
(2009) 14 SCC 318, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the mandate of the people has
expressed in the election results must be ordinarily respected by Courts and the election of
successful candidates should not be likely set aside.
165. In another judgment in the case of THE NEW INDIA ASSURANCE COMPANY LTD. VS. C.
PADMA AND ANOTHER reported in (2003) 7 SCC 713 that the burden of proof of corrupt practice
is heavy on the petitioner.
166. Another judgment in the case of GAJANAN KRISHNAJI BAPAT AND ANOTHER VS.
DATTAJI RAGHOBAJI MEGHE AND OTHERS reported in (1995) 5 SCC 347, wherein the Hon'ble
Supreme Court held that onus heavily on the petitioner to establish charge of corrupt practice and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128202297/ 67
Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
burden of proof is on the petitioner.
167. In another judgment in the case of PRADIP BURAGOHAIN VS. PRANATI PHUKAN reported
in (2010) 11 SCC 108, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the charge of corrupt practice like
criminal charge must be proved beyond reasonable doubt.
168. In another judgment in the case of JOSEPH M PUTHUSSERY VS. T.S.JOHN AND OTHERS
reported in (2011) SCC 503, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that an election trial
where corrupt practice is alleged to be conducted as a criminal trial and hence, standard of proof
beyond reasonable doubt needs to be adopted.
169. In another judgment in the case of RAHIM KHAN VS. KHURSHID AHMED AND OTHERS
reported in (1974) 2 SCC 660, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that danger of believing
oral evidence in an Election Petition and its face value without backing of sure circumstances and
indubitable document is required to be emphasized.
170. On perusal of the principle laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the above said cases and
here in this case, petitioners in both the cases have lead oral evidence as well as documentary
evidence along with the material objects by examining election officials, Deputy Commissioner,
Income Tax officials and others along with the certified copies of the public documents and proved
the issues framed by the Court in respect of corrupt practices as well as more expenditures, proxy
voting, non disclosure of material facts in the nomination form, giving wrong information, avoiding
taxes were all proved beyond reasonable doubt. Therefore, the above said judgments are helpful to
the petitioners' case rather than the respondent.
171. In view of my findings in issues in both the cases answered against the respondent No.1 and in
favour of the petitioners that the petitioners have proved the issues framed by the Court and the
corrupt practices of the respondent No.1 in the Hassan Parliamentary Election regarding non
disclosure of material facts, wrong disclosure of the value of the properties, evading taxes, proxy
voting, exorbitant expenditures than the limit prescribed by the Election Commission of India,
wrong acceptance of nomination paper by the Returning Officer. The election of the returned
candidate / respondent No.1 is liable to be set aside as prayed by the petitioners in both the cases.
172. However, in view of the respondent No.1 proving the fact that the petitioner in E.P.No.1/2019
also involved in corrupt practices in Recrimination Petition and he is also not deserving as declared
as returned candidate, therefore, even the respondent No.1 once election declared as void, but the
petitioner- A.Manju in E.P.No.1/2019 cannot be declared as returned candidate.
173. In respect of the prayer of the petitioner in E.P.No.2/2019 that due to the corrupt practice
committed by H.D.Revanna and Suraj who are the father and brother of respondent No.1 who were
also involved in the corrupt practices for helping the respondent No.1 in electing him as returned
candidate in which the petitioner successful in proving that H.D.Revanna, father of the respondent
No.1 involved in corrupt practice by diverting the funds allocated to Cauvery Neeravari Nigama
Limited by misusing his official position as District In-charge Minister of Hassan District and the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128202297/ 68
Sri A Manju vs Sri. Prajwal Revanna @ Prajwal R on 1 September, 2023
uncle of respondent No.1- H.D.Kumaraswamy, the then Chief Minister of the State and Chairman of
the Cauvery Neeravari Nigama Limited also diverted the fund towards the other developments in
the District were all helped the respondent No.1 for getting elected by the voters. Apart from that,
H.D. Revanna also actively participated in proxy voting at Booth No.244 of Padavalahippe Village
and casted the votes in favour of the respondent No.1. It is also corrupt practice which was proved
by the petitioner in E.P.No.2/2019. However, the petitioner not named H.D. Kumaraswamy or the
mother of the respondent Bhavani Revanna in the prayer, but there were averments in the petition
as well as in the evidence both oral as well as documents apart from the CCTV Footage and Hard
Disc were all shows the family members of the respondent No.1 involved in the corrupt practices.
Therefore, H.D.Revanna involved in throughout corrupt practices in helping respondent No.1, who
is his son and the others are all having little role to play. Therefore, it is necessary to issue notice to
H.D.Revanna and Suraj Revanna to show cause as to why they should not be so named as per
Section 99(a)(ii) of R.P. Act in E.P.No.2/2019.
174. In view of the above discussions and findings on the issues, I proceed to pass the following
order:
(i) Both the election petitions filed by the petitioners in E.P. No.1/2019 and 2/2019
are allowed in part.
(ii) The election of returned candidate respondent No.1 namely, Prajwal Revanna @
Prajwal R, Member of the Parliament Constituency-16 Hassan (General) having been
declared as returned candidate dated 23.05.2019 as per Form No.21(c), is hereby
declared as null and void.
(iii) The Recrimination Petition filed by respondent No.1 in E.P. No.1/2019 is
allowed.
(iv) The prayer of the petitioners in both cases to declare Sri A. Manju, the petitioner
in E.P. No.1/2019, as returned candidate, is rejected in view of the findings that, he
himself involved in corrupt practices.
(v) Sri H.D. Revanna and Sri Suraj Revanna are named in terms of Section
99(1)(a)(2) of R.P. Act for having committed corrupt practice at the time of election
and also Sri A. Manju, the petitioner in E.P. No.1/2019, who is also involved in
corrupt practice.
(vi) Issue notices to Sri H.D. Revanna and Sri Suraj Revanna in terms of Proviso (a)
to Section 99(a)(ii) of R.P. Act.
(vii) Registry to comply with the mandate under Rule 19 of Election Petitions
Procedure Rules, Karnataka, by sending copy of this order to the Election
Commission and the Hon'ble Speaker of the House of Parliament.
