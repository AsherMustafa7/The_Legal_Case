illegally disposing/selling of the crane of the petitioner bearing
registration No. BR2H 6948. According to the petitioner, the
action of the respondent authorities in illegally disposing /

2/20
provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances
Act, 1985 (for short "N.D.P.S. Act") as well as the settled
principle of law.
3. In this case, Interlocutory Application No. 2
of 2022 was filed by the petitioner for amending the prayer
portion of the main writ petition inter alia for quashing the
order dated 03.08.2019 passed in Special Case No.59 of 2019,

Nurul Hasan Khan vs Union Of India, Through The Director ... on 17 October, 2025
More, G.T. road en route to Patna and upon his request, the
petitioner provided his crane for towing of the said Bolero to
Patna High Court CR. WJC No.434 of 2022 dt.17-10-2025
3/20
Patna.
6. It is submitted by learned Senior Counsel for
the petitioner that based upon a secret information, the
Directorate of Revenue Intelligence intercepted the Bolero Pick-
up van bearing registration No. BR-6GD/5751 near D.R.M.
Office, Danapur Station, Saguna More Road, Patna, which was
being towed by the crane belonging to the petitioner. In the
crane, two persons were present namely, Md. Salamat Murtuza,
who was the driver of the said crane and Md. Faiz, who was the
khalasi (helper) of the said crane. Upon search of the Bolero
pickup Van which was being towed by the petitioner's crane, the
D.R.I. officials seized 47 crates of mangoes and 06 jute and 28
plastics sacks containing a total of 141 brown coloured packets
containing substance believed to be ganja from the said Bolero
Pick up van.
7. It is also submitted by learned Senior
Counsel that thereafter the statements of said two persons
namely, Salamat Murtuza and Md. Faiz were recorded under
section 67 of the N.D.P.S. Act, wherein they had stated that they
did not have any knowledge about the recovered ganja and the
same was not recovered from their conscious possession and
they were merely towing the Bolero pickup van on the direction

of the owner of the said crane. On being called by the D.R.I
officials, the petitioner appeared in the D.R.I office and his
statement was also recorded under section 67 of the N.D.P.S.
Act, in which he had stated that he did not have any knowledge
about the said ganja recovered from the Bolero pick-up van
which had met with an accident and he was told that mangoes
were loaded on it.
8. It is submitted by learned Senior Counsel for
the petitioner that the crane of the petitioner was seized on
07.06.2019
and the statement of the petitioner was recorded on the same day and thereafter the prosecution
report was submitted on 08.06.2019 (Annexure-2) wherein it has categorically been stated that
based on the evidence gathered during the proceedings and the statements of the petitioner, his
driver and khalasi(heloper), it was found that neither the petitioner nor his driver or khalasi were
involved in the illicit trade of ganja but on 01.08.2019, the same officer i.e. respondent no. 3, filed an
application for pre-trial disposal of the said crane besides the Bolero Pick up without any intimation
or notice to the petitioner and ultimately, by an order dated 03.08.2019 passed by the court of
learned Special Judge, Patna in Special Case No. 59 of 2019, the respondent no.3 was granted Patna
High Court CR. WJC No.434 of 2022 dt.17-10-2025 permission for disposing the crane of the
petitioner. Therefore, it is submitted that the crane of the petitioner was unlawfully auction sold by
the respondents.
9. It has further been submitted by learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner that since the
petitioner or his driver and Khalasi (helper) were not made accused in the instant case by the D.R.I.,
it was incumbent upon the DRI to release the crane of petitioner seized by them since it was not
liable to be confiscated. Thus, the respondents by seizing the crane, after coming to the conclusion
that the petitioner was not involved in the present case, have committed a gross illegality.
10. It is also submitted by learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner that the respondents while
disposing of the crane of the petitioner have grossly violated section 52A of the N.D.P.S. Act, which
deals with disposal of narcotic drugs and psychotic substance. Therefore, it is the submission of the
petitioner that the respondents in the garb of seized narcotics drugs and psychotic substance have
disposed of the crane of the petitioner by way of auction sold, which admittedly as per their own
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/137383890/ 4
Nurul Hasan Khan vs Union Of India, Through The Director ... on 17 October, 2025
version was not involved in illicit trade of ganja.
11. It is the further submission of learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner that prior to disposing
the crane of the Patna High Court CR. WJC No.434 of 2022 dt.17-10-2025 petitioner, neither the
respondents issued/served any notice to the petitioner nor gave any opportunity of being heard.
Moreover, the DRI also did not inform the trial court that neither the petitioner nor his driver and
khalasi were found to be involved in the present case and thus the DRI also mislead the trial court
and obtained the order dated 03.08.2019 by suppressing the material fact, by which the pre-trial
disposal of the crane of the petitioner was allowed. Further, the respondents in their counter
affidavit have categorically admitted that the involvement of the petitioner in the illicit trade of
ganja was not established but the respondents still went ahead and auction sold the crane of the
petitioner.
12. It is also the submission of learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner that section 52A of the
N.D.P.S. Act deals with disposal of seized narcotic drugs and psychotropic substance and in view of
the aforesaid section, the action of respondent in disposing of the crane of the petitioner is
absolutely illegal, unwarranted and against the provision of the Act.
13. It is further submitted that as per the inventory of the seized crane prepared, which is annexed as
Annexure-4, the crane was found in good condition, still the Patna High Court CR. WJC No.434 of
2022 dt.17-10-2025 respondents under-valued the crane for Rs. 3,00,000/- and sold it on a throw
away price. The respondents have disposed of the crane of the petitioner and this fact came to the
knowledge of the petitioner only after passing of the order dated 02.12.2021. Therefore, the action of
respondents in auction selling of the crane of the petitioner is blatantly illegal, arbitrary and has
caused great suffering to the petitioner as well as affected his livelihood as the operation of crane
was his source of income and same has caused physical, mental agony and financial loss to the
petitioner. Thus, it is submitted that the petitioner is liable to be fairly and adequately compensated
by the respondents for illegally and arbitrarily auction selling his crane.
14. In this case, a counter affidavit has been filed on behalf of the respondent - D.R.I. wherein the
facts relating to the N.D.P.S. has been mentioned and thereafter, it has been stated that based on the
evidences gathered such as, CDRs. of the petitioner, his driver and khalasi were scientifically
analyzed and on the basis of the analysis it was found that no connection could be established
between the petitioner, his driver and khalasi and the actual owner of the seized contraband i.e.
ganja.
15. It will be relevant to quote paragraph no.9 of the counter affidavit, which reads as under:-
"9. That under the circumstances explained Patna High Court CR. WJC No.434 of
2022 dt.17-10-2025 above, on the basis of evidences gathered during the whole
proceedings and as per statement of the above said persons drawn under Section 67
of the NDPS Act, 1985, conscious involvement of the above said persons namely
Salamat Murutza (driver of the disputed vehicle) and Md. Faiz ( khalasi of the
disputed vehicle) as well as Nurul Hasan Khan, owner of the said crane in the illicit
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/137383890/ 5
Nurul Hasan Khan vs Union Of India, Through The Director ... on 17 October, 2025
trade of the Ganja could not be established. Hence, the driver of the crane, his cousin
brother and the owner of the crane was not arrested. Hence, they were accordingly
released without causing any loss or injury to them with their consent that as and
when their presence will be required in course of the investigation of the case, they
will accordingly cooperate in the investigation. Intimation for recovery of ganja was
prepared and the same was duly intimated to the Court of Sessions
Judge-cum-Special (N.D.P.S. Act) Patna on 10.06.2019."
16. It has been submitted by learned counsel for the respondents that after passing of the order
dated 03.08.2019, the D.R.I. had forwarded the matter to the Customs Department to auction the
seized goods and thereafter as per the procedure, the reserved price of the crane was fixed on
13.08.2019 by the Joint Pricing Committee. Thereafter, in terms of the provisions Patna High Court
CR. WJC No.434 of 2022 dt.17-10-2025 of the Disposal Manual, 2019 the aforesaid crane was e-
auctioned in favour M/s. Kushwaha Enterprises being the highest bidder and accordingly, the sale
was confirmed. Therefore, it is pointed out that the Customs Department did nothing but carry out
the orders dated 03.08.2019 of the trial court as per the procedure of the Disposal Manual, 2019.
17. It is also the submission of the respondents that the petitioner had approached the trial court for
the release of his crane after passing of the order dated 03.08.2019 for pre- trial disposal of the
crane. Further, no procedural irregularity has been pointed out in the e-auction process which was
done as per by Disposal Manual, 2019. Moreover, the crane of the petitioner was towing the Bolero
pickup van, in which narcotic substance i.e. ganja was recovered and as such, the crane was the
conveyance, which was used to transport the narcotic substance which is liable to be confiscated
under section 60(3) of the N.D.P.S. Act and a similar provision is there under section 115(2) of the
Customs Act, 1962.
18. It has also been submitted that the petitioner has never denied that his crane was not
transporting/towing the Bolero pickup van from which contraband ganja was recovered and the trial
of the case is still gong on and the matter is sub- Patna High Court CR. WJC No.434 of 2022
dt.17-10-2025 judice. The crane of the petitioner was auction sold under the order of pre-trial
disposal and as such, after completion of the trial, the trial court may order for deposit of the sale
amount or its confiscation, on completion of trial and as such, payment of the amount to the
petitioner may not be made and if at all ordered, the same may be done after taking appropriate
security awaiting the final decision of the trial court.
19. Lastly, it has been submitted that order dated 03.08.2019 by which the pre-trial disposal of the
crane of the petitioner was allowed has been belatedly challenged by way of filing an interlocutory
application before this Court and the order dated 02.02.2021 by which the trial court has rejected
the petition of the petitioner for release of his crane remains unchallenged till date and as such, the
relief, as prayed for, is untenable.
20. The learned counsel for the respondents has relied on a decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court
in the case of Union of India vs. Mohanlal and Anr. reported as (2016) 3 SCC 379.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/137383890/ 6
Nurul Hasan Khan vs Union Of India, Through The Director ... on 17 October, 2025
21. Pursuant to the order dated 14.11.2022 passed by a coordinate Bench of this Court, an affidavit
has been sworn and filed by the Joint Commissioner, Customs Patna High Court CR. WJC No.434 of
2022 dt.17-10-2025 wherein the procedure adopted for auctioning the crane of the petitioner has
been brought on record.
22. A counter affidavit has been filed by the Assistant Commissioner (Legal, Customs (P), Patna.
Paragraph nos. 13 to 16 of the aforesaid counter affidavit reads as under:-
"13. That Notification No.75/2003-Customs (N.T.) dated 12.09.2003 has been issued
under Section 27A of the Customs Act, 1962 which stipulates the rate of interest
payable by the Department to the applicant on any delayed refund beyond 3 months
payable by the Department.
14. That it is further humbly stated that Notification No.33/2016-Customs (N.T.)
dated 01.03.2016, which prescribes the applicable rate of interest payable by a person
liable to pay any duty under the Customs Act, 1962, shall, in addition to such duty be
liable to pay interest, if any, at the rate fixed on delayed payment which has been
fixed vide the aforesaid Notification and is being respectfully submitted for the kind
perusal and consideration of this Hon'ble Court.
15. That it is further humbly stated that the Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the matter
of M/s Ajay Industrial Corporation Ltd. Vs. Deputy Commissioner of Customs (writ
petition No. 13314 of 2024) vide Judgment dated 15.10.2024 were please to grant 6%
Patna High Court CR. WJC No.434 of 2022 dt.17-10-2025 interest.
16. That the Department undertakes to ensure that such lapses do not reoccur in
future and necessary steps are being taken to streamline internal communication
processes. Necessary Department action has been initiated against the officers
concerned for grave lapses."
23. I have considered the submissions of the parties and perused the materials on record.
24. In the present case, the D.R.I. had intercepted a Bolero vehicle was being towed by the crane of
the petitioner and from the aforesaid Bolero vehicle ganja was recovered. Consequently, a criminal
case was initiated under the N.D.P.S. Act wherein along with seized articles, the crane of the
petitioner was also seized. After an investigation, the role of the petitioner and his driver / helper
was not found in the crime. Consequently, they were not arrayed as an accused.
25. The order passed by the learned Special Court in Special Case No.59 of 2019 dated 13.06.2019
and 27.06.2019 reveal that a typographical error had crept in the records relating to the registration
number of the vehicle and the same was duly corrected. On 01.08.2019, the Spl. P.P. had moved an
application before the trial court for disposal of the Patna High Court CR. WJC No.434 of 2022
dt.17-10-2025 vehicles including the crane of the petitioner. Thereafter, the trial court passed the
order dated 03.08.2019 in the aforesaid Special Case No.59 of 2019, which is reproduced herein
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/137383890/ 7
Nurul Hasan Khan vs Union Of India, Through The Director ... on 17 October, 2025
below:-
"A petition dated 01.08.2019 filed on behalf of the prosecution has been moved today
praying therein to pre-trial disposal of (1) Bolero Pick- up bearing Registration No.
BR 06GD-5157 along with the Crane bearing Registration No. BR 2H-6948 on which
crates of mangoes was found loaded. (2) 683.8500 Kg Ganja (3) 540 Kg Mangoes,
seized in this case, on the basis of authorization of Directorate of Revenue
Intelligence (DRI) to the Sp.LPP for obtaining pre-trial disposal order, in which
certification of seized goods (Narcotic drugs) had already been done, from the Court's
concerned.
Heard Sri Krishna Kant Tiwari, the
learned Spl.P.P.
From perusal of the recved, it
transpires that certification of the recovered Narcotic substance and other articles
including the vehicles has already been done by Sri Sukul Ram, ACJM-13, Patna
whose report, in this regard is already on record. Hence, is the light of submission as
prayed for, prayer is allowed.
It is therefore, ordered that the concerned authorities are permitted to dispose of the
(1) Bolero Pick-up bearing Registration No. BR 06GD-5157 as well as Crane bearing
Registration No. BR 2H-6948, (2) 683.8500 Kg Ganja (3) 541 Kg Mangoes, seized in
this Patna High Court CR. WJC No.434 of 2022 dt.17-10-2025 case, as per rule."
26. Pertinently, the petitioner was not arrayed as an accused in the N.D.P.S. case. Being unaware of
such an order for disposing of his crane, being passed, the petitioner moved before the trial court
seeking release of his vehicle and at that time he came to known about disposal of his crane. The
order dated 02.12.2021 passed in Special Case No.59 of 2019 is reproduced herein below:-
"Learned counsel for the petitioner Nurul Hasan submits that in this case a crane
bearing registration no. BR 2H 6948 has been seized by DRI Regional Unit Patna on
the ground that unclaimed ganja was recovered from accidental Bolero pickup
bearing registration no. BR 06GB 5197 which was towed by the crane. It has also
been submitted that the crane has no concerned with the alleged ganja and during
investigation the petitioner was not found liable to be arrested and was accordingly
released by the intelligence officer. In the light of these submissions, it has been
prayed that the crane be allowed to be released.
Learned Spl. P.P. opposes the prayer by submitting that the petition is not
maintainable because this court vide its order dated 03.08.2019 has ordered for
disposal of the said crane and Bolero Pickup and along with the seized ganja and all
of these have Patna High Court CR. WJC No.434 of 2022 dt.17-10-2025 already been
disposed of. The said crane has been auctioned sold. Therefore, its release is not
possible.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/137383890/ 8
Nurul Hasan Khan vs Union Of India, Through The Director ... on 17 October, 2025
On perusal of the second is clear that this court vide its order dated 03.08.2019 itself
has allowed for disposal of the said crane. Once the crane has been disposed of it can
not be a subject matter of release. As far as the question of realization of amount of
sale by its lawful owner is concerned then the petitioner is at liberty to file proper
petition at appropriate form. With this observation the petition is disposed off."
27. From the perusal of the afore-quoted orders, it is clear that the present petitioner, who is the
owner of the crane in this case, had not been heard before his vehicle i.e. the seized crane in
question, was disposed and was subsequently auction sold. The order dated 03.08.2019 wherein the
application dated 01.08.2019 was considered only records the appearance of the learned Spl. P.P.
therein and neither notice had been issued to the owner of the crane i.e. the present petitioner nor
any opportunity has been afforded to him.
28. It would be relevant to quote section 60 of the N.D.P.S. Act, which reads as under:-
"60. Liability of illicit drugs, substances, plants, articles and conveyances to
confiscation.- (1) Whenever any offence Patna High Court CR. WJC No.434 of 2022
dt.17-10-2025 punishable under this Act has been committed, the narcotic drug,
psychotropic substance, controlled substance, opium poppy, coca plant, cannabis
plant, materials, apparatus and utensils in respect of which or by means of which
such offence has been committed, shall be liable to confiscation.
(2) Any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance or controlled substances lawfully
produced, imported inter-State, exported inter-State, imported into India,
transported, manufactured, possessed, used, purchased or sold along with, or in
addition to, any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance or controlled substances
which is liable to confiscation under sub-section (1) and the receptacles, packages
and coverings in which any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance or controlled
substances, materials, apparatus or utensils liable to confiscation under sub-
section (1) is found, and the other contents, if any, of such receptacles or packages shall likewise be
liable to confiscation.
(3) Any animal or conveyance used in carrying any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance or
controlled substances, or any article liable to confiscation under sub-section (1) or Patna High Court
CR. WJC No.434 of 2022 dt.17-10-2025 sub-section (2) shall be liable to confiscation, unless the
owner of the animal or conveyance proves that it was so used without the knowledge or connivance
of the owner himself, his agent, if any, and the person-in-charge of the animal or conveyance and
that each of them had taken all reasonable precautions against such use."
29. Section 60(3) of the N.D.P.S provides for confiscation only when the vehicle in question was
knowingly being used for illicit purposes. Section 60 provides that any conveyance used in carrying
any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance or any article liable to confiscation under sub-section
(1) or sub-section (2) shall be liable to confiscation unless the owner of the conveyance proves that it
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/137383890/ 9
Nurul Hasan Khan vs Union Of India, Through The Director ... on 17 October, 2025
was so used without the knowledge or connivance of the owner himself, his agent or any person
in-charge of the conveyance and that all such persons had taken all reasonable precautions against
such use. In other words, if the owner of the vehicle/conveyance proves that his vehicle was used in
the commission of the offence without his knowledge or connivance and he has taken all reasonable
precautions against such use, the conveyance cannot be confiscated despite it being used in the
commission of the alleged offense under the NDPS Act.
Patna High Court CR. WJC No.434 of 2022 dt.17-10-2025
30. Moreover, the Article 300A of the Constitution of India also protects the property of the
petitioner and he cannot be deprived of his property save and except in accordance with law.
31. In the counter affidavit filed by the D.R.I. it has categorically been stated that upon investigation
it was found that the petitioner and his driver/khalasi (helper) were not involved in the illicit trade
of ganja and therefore, none of them were arrayed as an accused.
32. Since the petitioner was not an accused in the N.D.P.S. case, it was the duty of the prosecuting
agency to bring this fact to the notice of the trial court that the owner of the crane in question was
not before it while the court was considering the application for pre-trial disposal of the crane of the
petitioner and therefore, the order dated 03.08.2019 ought not to have been passed without hearing
the petitioner who is the bona fide owner of the crane in question.
33. Considering the aforesaid facts, I am of the considered view that the order dated 03.08.2019
passed in Special Case No.59 of 2019, by which the crane of the petitioner was auction sold, is bad in
law and therefore, it is unsustainable. However, since the crane of the petitioner has Patna High
Court CR. WJC No.434 of 2022 dt.17-10-2025 already been auction sold, which is irreversible at this
belated stage, this Court deems it appropriate to compensate the petitioner in view of unlawful
auction of his crane.
34. Considering the fact that the petitioner was deprived of his vehicle (crane) unlawfully which was
his source of income and livelihood and the crane of the petitioner was sold behind his back without
following the due process of law, this Court deems it appropriate and in the interest of justice that it
is a fit case to compensate the petitioner reasonably. Accordingly, this Court directs the respondent
authorities to pay an amount of Rs.3,00,000/- which has been valued by the respondent authorities
(Annexure-2) with interest at the rate of 8% per annum from the date on which the vehicle has been
seized. The payment must be made in favour of the petitioner within eight weeks from today.
35. This Court has noticed that the respondents on the one hand had found that the petitioner or his
driver/helper were not involved in the crime and on the other hand they have moved an application
for pre-trial disposal of the crane of the petitioner. Therefore, this Court finds that the action of the
respondents in disposing the crane of the petitioner without any notice to him as wholly arbitrary.
The respondents have further Patna High Court CR. WJC No.434 of 2022 dt.17-10-2025 failed to
inform the learned trial court that the actual owner of the crane, having not been arrayed as an
accused, was not before it and the order of the disposal of the crane was passed to the prejudice of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/137383890/ 10
Nurul Hasan Khan vs Union Of India, Through The Director ... on 17 October, 2025
the petitioner.
36. In view of the above, this Court directs the respondent authorities to pay a cost of Rs.1,00,000/-
(Rupees One Lakh) in addition to the aforementioned amount, as indicated in the proceeding
paragraph, to the petitioner within a period of eight weeks from today.
37. With the aforesaid observations and directions, this criminal writ petition is allowed.
38. Let the original records of Special Case No.59 of 2019 be transmitted to the concerned trial
court.
