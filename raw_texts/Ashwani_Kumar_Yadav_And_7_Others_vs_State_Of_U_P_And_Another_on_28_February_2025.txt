Ashwani Kumar Yadav And 7 Others vs State Of U.P. And Another on 28 February, 2025
No.138 of 2023, under Sections 494, 504, 506, 120B I.P.C., Police Station-Nasirpur,
District-Firozabad, pending in the Court of Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Shikohabad,
District-Firozabad.
4. Brief facts of the case are that the present FIR has been lodged on 04.08.2023 at about 16:35 hrs
by the opposite party no.2 against the applicants under Sections 494, 504, 506, 120B IPC with the
allegations that the marriage of opposite party no.2 was solemnized with Ashwani Kumar Yadav
(applicant no.1) on 04.02.2018 according to Hindu Rites and Rituals. In the marriage, the parents of
opposite party no.2 had spent nearly Rs.20 lakhs, however, the in-laws family members including
husband were not happy with the dowry and they tortured her for raising additional dowry demand
i.e. one car. The opposite party no.2 endured all the torture as done by the members of her in-laws
family as she wanted to maintain her family needs. In the meantime, she became pregnant. It has
further been alleged that on 27.07.2018, the applicants after assaulting her threw her out of the
house in that condition when she was pregnant without given anything to her. On 20.10.2018, the
applicant no.1 came to parents' house of opposite party no.2 and raised a demand of car. He also
stated that he would not take back her alongwith him unless his demand of car is fulfilled. The
opposite party no.2 was assaulted by applicant no.1 at her parents' place when she stated that her
parents were not in a position to fulfill the additional dowry demand. The opposite party no.2 was
left with no option but to lodged an FIR being Case Crime No.34 of 2019, under Sections 498A, 323,
504, 506 IPC and D.P. Act against Ashwani Kumar Yadav (husband) and Kamla Devi
(mother-in-law) in which charge sheet has been submitted and matter is pending. Another case for
maintenance under Section 125 Cr.P.C. being Case No.965 of 2020 was also filed, which is also
pending. In between Application U/s 482 No.12495/2023 was filed by the applicants, wherein by
order dated 11.04.2023 the Co-ordinate Bench of this Court referred the matter before the
Mediation and Cancellation Centre at Allahabad High Court. The parties were called before the
Mediation Centre. On 06.07.2023, the opposite party no.2 appear before the Mediation Centre,
however, her husband had performed second marriage on 06.07.2023 without obtaining divorce
from her. On 05.06.2023, the marriage was performed at about 12:00 O'clock with Kirti D/o Raman
Pati and Meena Devi with the help and assistance of applicants. When the opposite party no.2
received information about the second marriage being performed by her husband (applicant no.1),
she alongwith her father and few respectable persons of the village and Krishna Gopal reached the
place where she saw her husband performing marriage with Kirti. When the applicants saw the
opposite party no.2 and her father, there was hot talk between them and the persons, who were
present at the time of marriage being family members of husband (applicant no.1). Husband took
out country-made pistol, opposed and threatened for life and ran away alongwith Kitri. An
application in this regard was given by the opposite party no.2 on 06.06.2023 before Police
Station-Naseerpur requesting for action against the applicants. After investigation, charge sheet has
been submitted against the applicants, pursuant to which the applicants have been summoned,
hence the present petition has been filed.
5. Learned counsel for the applicants submits that the present FIR has been lodged with false and
frivolous allegations as no such marriage has been performed by applicant no.1 with Kirti. Relying
upon the statement of charge sheet witnesses; Suresh Chandra (father of opposite party no.2), Deep
Kumar (brother of opposite party no.2), Yatendra Singh and Krishna Gopal as well as Suman &

Ashwani Kumar Yadav And 7 Others vs State Of U.P. And Another on 28 February, 2025
Jyoti, who were interrogated by the Investigating Officer, learned counsel for the applicants submits
that no such marriage has been performed by the applicant no.1 with Kirti. Relying upon the
judgment of the Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in the case of Smriti Singh Alias Mausami Singh
and 3 Others vs. State of U.P. and another (Application U/s 482 No.23148 of 2022, decided on
19.09.2023), he submits that the offence under Section 494 IPC is not made out against the
applicant no.1 as the ceremonies of "Saptapadi" had not taken place in the alleged marriage. It is
well settled that to constitute an offence under Section 494 IPC, it is necessary that the Saptapadi
ceremony ((taking of seven steps by the bridegroom and the bride jointly before the sacred fire)) is
one of the essential ingredients of a valid marriage under Hindu law.
6. Specifying Section 7 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, he submits that ceremonies in the Hindu
Marriage is said to be performed when "Saptapadi", i.e. taking of seven steps by the bridegroom and
the bride jointly before the sacred fire. In the present case, no witness has spoken about such
"Saptapadi" ceremony being performed, therefore, when no marriage is proved, offence under
Section 494 is not made out against the applicants including the husband (applicant no.1).
7. Learned counsel for the applicants further submits that the real story is that Kirti is said to have
performed marriage with Jitendra Singh as is evident from the Arya Samaj Marriage Certificate
placed at Page 92 of the application. The marriage is said to have been performed on 10.11.2023.
The Aadhar Card of Kirti has also been annexed at Page 15 of the petition to prove the aforesaid fact.
He further submits that no offence against the applicants is disclosed and the present prosecution
has been instituted with a malafide intention for the purpose of causing harassment. He pointed out
certain documents and statements in support of his contention. He, therefore, submits that the
charge-sheet, summoning order as well as entire proceedings be quashed by this Court as the same
is an abuse process of Court.
8. Learned A.G.A. for the State as well as counsel for the opposite party no.2 have opposed the
submissions made by the learned counsel for the applicants by submitting that from the statements
of charge sheet witnesses, it is clear that the marriage was performed in the presence of applicants.
The other witnesses, Suman and Jyoti have also spoken about the marriage being performed in a
close house in the presence of few people, neither photographs have been clicked nor any
videography has been done. Also the charge sheet witnesses have specifically spoken about the
marriage between applicant no.1 and Kirti.
9. As regards the contention of learned counsel for the applicants that "Saptapadi" was not
performed, they submits that neither such specific question was put by the Investigating Officer nor
the marriage has been denied by any of the charge sheet witnesses. Hence it is factual dispute, which
cannot be looked at this stage by this Court in jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure. Hence the judgment as relied by the counsel for the applicants is not applicable in the
present facts of the case.
10. So far as the submission made by counsel for the applicants regarding marriage certificate issued
from Aarya Samaj is concerned, the same disclosed the name of some Babita, who has performed
marriage with Jitendra Singh on 10.11.2023. Such marriage certificate cannot be taken as authentic
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/69465781/ 3
Ashwani Kumar Yadav And 7 Others vs State Of U.P. And Another on 28 February, 2025
proof of marriage between the parties and also the fact that name of Babita is mentioned, there is
nothing on record to show that Babita and Kirti are the same person.
11. Learned AGA as well as counsel for the opposite party no.2 also submits that in the Aadhar Card,
which has been taken as proof of marriage of Kirti with Jitendra also mentioned about Babita, who
again cannot be said to be Kirti. Even if it is presumed that Babita and Kirti are the same person,
Aadhar Card shows that Jitendra Singh is taking care of Babita, the aforesaid also cannot be taken as
proof of Kirti being married to some other person. He further submits that all the contentions raised
by the applicants' counsel relate to disputed questions of fact. On the basis of material on record
after conducting of statutory investigation under Chapter XII Cr.P.C. by the investigating officer, a
strong prima facie case is made out against the applicant for the commission of the alleged incident.
In support of his case, learned AGA has placed reliance upon the judgments of the Apex Court in the
case of Dilbag Rai Vs. State of Haryana & Others reported in AIR 2019 (SC) 693 and Central Bureau
of Investigation Vs. Arvind Khanna reported in MANU/SC/1432/2019.
12. I have considered the submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties and have gone
through the records of the present application.
13. The Apex Court in the case of Dhanlakshmi v. R. Prasanna Kumar and others4, wherein offence
under Sections 494, 496, 498-A, 112, 120-B IPC was involved, has held that exercise of powers to
quash the proceedings is called for only in cases where the complaint does not disclose any offence
or is frivolous. The Court has further held that in the absence of circumstances to hold prima facie
that the complaint is frivolous when the complaint does disclose the commission of an offence there
is no justification for the High Court to interfere. Relevant paragraphs of the said judgement reads
thus:
"3. Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure empowers the High Court to
exercise its inherent powers to prevent abuse of the process of court. In proceedings
instituted on complaint exercise of the inherent power to quash the proceedings is
called for only in cases where the complaint does not disclose any offence or is
frivolous, vexatious or oppressive. If the allegations set out in the complaint do not
constitute the offence of which cognizance is taken by the Magistrate it is open to the
High Court to quash the same in exercise of the inherent powers under Section 482.
It is not, however, necessary that there should be a meticulous analysis of the case,
before the trial to find out whether the case would end in conviction or not. The
complaint has to be read as a whole. If it appears on a consideration of the
allegations, in the light of the statement on oath of the complainant that ingredients
of the offence/offences are disclosed, and there is no material to show that the
complaint is mala fide frivolous or vexatious, in that event there would be no
justification for interference by the High Court.
4. The High Court without proper application of the principles that have been laid
down by this Court in Sharda Prasad Sinha v. State of Bihar5, S. Trilok Singh v. Satya
Deo Tripathi6 and Municipal Corporationof Delhi v. Purshotam Dass Jhunjunwala7
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/69465781/ 4
Ashwani Kumar Yadav And 7 Others vs State Of U.P. And Another on 28 February, 2025
proceeded to analyse the case of the complainant in the light of all the probabilities in
order to determine whether a conviction would be sustainable and on such premises
arrived at a conclusion that the proceedings are to be quashed against all the
respondents. The High Court was clearly in error in assessing the material before it
and concluding that the complaint cannot be proceeded with. We find there are
specific allegations in the complaint disclosing the ingredients of the offence taken
cognizance of. It is for the complainant to substantiate the allegations by evidence at
a later stage. In the absence of circumstances to hold prima facie that the complaint is
frivolous when the complaint does disclose the commission of an offence there is no
justification for the High Court to interfere."
(emphasis supplied)
14. This Court finds that the submissions made by the applicants' learned counsel call for
adjudication on pure questions of fact which may adequately be adjudicated upon only by the trial
court and while doing so even the submissions made on points of law can also be more appropriately
gone into by the trial court in this case. The issue whether it is appropriate for this Court being the
Highest Court to exercise its jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to quash the charge-sheet and
the proceedings at the stage when the Magistrate has merely issued process against the applicants
and trial is to yet to come only on the submission made by the learned counsel for the applicants
that present criminal case initiated by opposite party no.2 are not only malicious but also abuse of
process of law has elaborately been discussed by the Apex Court in the following judgments:-
(i) R.P. Kapur Versus State of Punjab; AIR 1960 SC 866,
(ii) State of Haryana & Ors. Versus Ch. Bhajan Lal & Ors.;1992 Supp.(1) SCC 335,
(iii) State of Bihar & Anr. Versus P.P. Sharma & Anr.; 1992 Supp (1) SCC 222,

15. In view of the aforesaid, this Court does not deem it proper, and therefore cannot be persuaded
to have a pre-trial before the actual trial begins. A threadbare discussion of various facts and
circumstances, as they emerge from the allegations made against the accused, is being purposely
avoided by the Court for the reason, lest the same might cause any prejudice to either side during
trial. But it shall suffice to observe that the perusal of the F.I.R. and the material collected by the
Investigating Officer on the basis of which the charge sheet has been submitted makes out a prima
facie case against the accused at this stage and there appear to be sufficient ground for proceeding
against the accused. I do not find any justification to quash the charge sheet or the proceedings
against the applicants arising out of them as the case does not fall in any of the categories recognized
by the Apex Court which may justify their quashing.
16. The prayer for quashing the impugned charge-sheet dated 31.12.2023 and summoning order
dated 15.06.2024 as well as the entire proceedings of the aforesaid case are refused, as I do not see
any abuse of the court's process at this pre-trial stage.
17. The present application has no merit and is, accordingly, rejected.
