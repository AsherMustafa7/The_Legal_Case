ORAL JUDGMENT
(Per: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE)
Date : 18-07-2019
C.W.J.C. No. 5129 of 2009 and the connected
writ petition C.W.J.C. No. 18039 of 2008 raise the same issue
simultaneously in view of the order of remand by the Apex
Court dated 6th January, 2016 in Civil Appeal No. 4273 of 2014
and Civil Appeal No. 4274 of 2014. The other connected
matters being linked with the same legal issue have also been
tagged along with these two writ petitions and have been heard
simultaneously. We have heard the learned counsel for the
petitioners and the appellants in the respective cases for the
Patna High Court CWJC No.5129 of 2009 dt.18-07-2019
9/33
private individuals contesting their claims and the learned
Advocate General for the State of Bihar on behalf of the
respondents in the two writ petitions and on behalf of the
appellant in L.P.A. No. 307 of 2016 and L.P.A. No. 1210 of
2010.
2. A dispute arose with regard to the equivalence
of Graduate qualification which was claimed to be possessed by
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131319947/ 7
The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Vidya Shankar Mishra And Ors on 18 July, 2019
the two sets of writ-petitioners in the above noted writ petitions
contending that they possess the degree of Sahityalankar from
the Hindi Vidya Peeth, Deoghar which is equivalent to a
Graduate degree and, therefore, they were entitled for the
employment being claimed by them. In both the cases the
selection and appointment is for the post of Librarian in an
Institution governed by the provisions of the Bihar Zila Parishad
Madhyamik Evam Uchchtar Madhyamik Shikshak Niyojan
Evam Seva Sharten Niyamavali, 2006.
3. These two writ petitions were allowed by a
Division Bench of this Court in the decision reported in 2009
(4) PLJR 1038 [Sanjay Kumar Vs. State of Bihar]. The
direction issued by the High Court was to re-do the selection
process and consider the candidature of the petitioners
preferably within a period of three months.
Patna High Court CWJC No.5129 of 2009 dt.18-07-2019

4. Questioning the correctness of the said
judgment, two Civil Appeals were preferred by the State of
Bihar before the Apex Court being Civil Appeal Nos. 4273 of
2014 and 4274 of 2014 that were ultimately allowed and the
matter was remitted back to the High Court vide judgment dated
6th January, 2016. The judgment being short and brief is
extracted hereinunder:-
"These appeals have been filed
challenging the common impugned order dated
17.11.2009
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131319947/ 8
The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Vidya Shankar Mishra And Ors on 18 July, 2019
passed by the Patna High Court allowing the writ petitions in CWJC Nos.
5129/2009 and 18039/2009 filed by the respondents herein and directing the appellant- State of
Bihar to redo the entire selection process for the post of Librarian considering the case of the
respondents also and further restraining the State from issuing appointment letters to other selected
candidates.
2. Brief facts giving rise to these appeals are as under:-
State of Bihar framed Bihar District Council, Secondary & Higher Secondary Teacher
(Employment & Service Conditions) Manual 2006 under Article 243G and Section 73
read with Section 146 of Bihar State Panchayat Raj Act, 2006. Rule 4(k) (vii) (a) of
the said Rules was amended in 2008. The said Patna High Court CWJC No.5129 of
2009 dt.18-07-2019 amendment prescribes an essential qualification for
appointments of teachers and librarians in the schools and also regulating
appointments. As per amended Rule 4 for appointment as teachers/librarians, the
candidates must possess the graduation degree from any recognized university with
minimum 45% marks. An advertisement bearing No.11/employment1-
13/91(Part-II)-1337 dated 25.08.2008 was issued by Government of Bihar, Human
Resources and Development Department for appointment to the post of Librarian
and Teacher in different schools under Zila Parishad and Nagar Nikaya in the State of
Bihar. The said advertisement specifically referred to Recruitment Rules 2006
although the qualification or eligibility criteria was not specifically mentioned.
3. Respondents herein applied for the posts of Librarian. After the advertisement was issued, the
Department issued order No. 11/Ma.1-01/2008 on 27.08.2008 containing exhaustive list of twenty
eight colleges/universities/degrees that were not then recognized by the Government of Bihar for
the purpose of the Recruitment Rules 2006 and the advertisement dated 25.08.2008 and those
degrees were not valid for employment of teachers. The Department issued another Order
No.11/M-44/2008-1968 (Annexure P/5) on 25.11.2008 declaring that the degree of Patna High
Court CWJC No.5129 of 2009 dt.18-07-2019 Sahityaalankar awarded by Deoghar Vidyapeeth is not
valid for employment. The State Government issued a letter dated 27.07.2007 clarifying the stand of
the State regarding the degree of Sahityaalankar awarded by Vidyapeeth Deoghar is not equivalent
to degree of graduation for the purpose of appointment under Bihar Education District Council,
Secondary and Higher Secondary Teachers (Employment/ Services) Rules 2006. The letter dated
27.07.2007 was subject matter of challenge in Writ Petition No. 15237/07 titled Pramod Paswan vs.
State of Bihar and in the said Writ Petition, the State was directed to take a fresh decision on the
same. The State Government examined the matter and vide Memo No. 11/M- 44/2008-1968 dated
25.11.2008, it was declared that the degree of Sahityaalankar awarded by Deoghar Vidyapeeth is not
valid for employment. On 13.12.2008, the Government of Bihar, Human Resources Development
Department, issued letter No.11/Na.1-9/2008- 2053 wherein inter-alia it was specifically mentioned
that the degree of Sahityaalankar awarded by Deoghar Vidyapeeth cannot be attached to merit list of
candidates.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131319947/ 9
The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Vidya Shankar Mishra And Ors on 18 July, 2019
4. Pursuant to the said advertisement, respondents applied for the post of Librarian. The
respondents possessed the degree of Sahityaalankar awarded by Deoghar Patna High Court CWJC
No.5129 of 2009 dt.18-07-2019 Vidyapeeth. Challenging the validity, legality and correctness of the
amendment of Rule 4(k)
(vii) (a) of the Recruitment Rules 2006 as amended in 2008, respondents filed two writ petitions
bearing Nos.5129/2009 and 18039/2009. The Patna High Court vide impugned order dated
17.11.2009 allowed the writ petitions filed by the respondents directing the State of Bihar to redo the
entire selection process as above mentioned. Aggrieved by the same, State of Bihar has filed these
appeals assailing the impugned order.
5. Mr. Gopal Singh, learned counsel for the appellants submitted that State of Bihar has issued order
dated 27.08.2008 containing list of twenty eight institutions which were not recognized under the
recruitment rules. It was submitted that the State has considered the matter at several occasions and
has decided not to grant benefits to un-recognized degrees and accordingly the degree of
Sahityaalankar awarded by Deoghar Vidyapeeth is not equivalent to graduation degree and the High
Court has not considered the matter in the light of order dated 25.11.2008 (Annexure P/5).
6. Per contra, Mr. N. Rai and Mr. S.B. Sanyal, learned Senior Counsel for the respondents contended
that the degree of Sahityaalankar makes the person eligible for appearing in the competitive
examinations Patna High Court CWJC No.5129 of 2009 dt.18-07-2019 conducted by the Bihar
Public Service Commission and it would be arbitrary to say that degree of Sahityalankar does not
make a person eligible as per Bihar District Council, Secondary & Higher Secondary Teacher
(Employment & Service Conditions) Manual 2006 as amended in 2008 and the same is violative of
Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India.
7. We have considered the rival contentions of both the parties and perused the material on record.
8. The issue involved in these appeals is concerned with the interpretation of provisions in Rule 4
(k) (vii) (a) of Bihar District Council, Secondary & Higher Secondary Teacher (Employment &
Service Conditions) Manual 2006 as amended in 2008. As noticed earlier, Rule 4(k)(vii)(a)
prescribes that the candidate must have passed graduation examination with minimum 45% marks
from any recognized university. It is the contention of the State that the respondents do not fulfill
the eligibility criteria as they possessed graduation degree from Hindi Vidyapeeth Deoghar which is
not a recognized university. As noticed above, as per the direction of the Patna High Court in CWJC
No.15237/2007, the State of Bihar examined the matter and by an order dated 25.11.2008 held that
degree of Sahityaalankar cannot be a valid degree for appointment as teacher. Para 6 of the Patna
High Court CWJC No.5129 of 2009 dt.18-07-2019 said order reads as under:-
"In Bihar District Council/Urban Body Secondary/Higher Secondary (Employment and Service
Conditions) Manual, 2006, there is no provision to employing on any equivalent degree. Besides it,
for employment, after deciding the all phases, the degree of "Sahityaalankar" given by Deoghar
Vidyapeeth and other many degrees have not been decided recognized." Mainly, the holder of
Sahityaalankar Degree appear only at exam of some Sahitya papers while general B.A. pass the exam
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131319947/ 10
The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Vidya Shankar Mishra And Ors on 18 July, 2019
of graduation in many papers, which is more useful for education, due to this reason the degree of
Sahityaalankar from Deoghar Vidyapeeth is not valid for employment."
Contention of the appellants is that pursuant to the above, the State sent instructions to all the
districts vide Order dated 13.12.2008 directing them to have appointment of teachers and librarians
in accordance with Recruitment Rules 2006 as amended in 2008 and notification governing the
validity of degrees.
9. On behalf of the State, it is further submitted that the validity of Patna High Court CWJC No.5129
of 2009 dt.18-07-2019 Sahityaalankar degree from the Hindi Vidyapeeth Deoghar and its
equivalence with the graduation degree has been considered in detail by the Patna High Court in
subsequent decisions filed by the State of Bihar in CWJC No.13343/2011 and several other
connected matters. It is submitted that in the above batch matters, High Court has rejected the
claim of the petitioners thereon that the Degree of Sahityaalankar is equivalent to graduation degree
and the State of Bihar heavily relies upon the said judgment in CWJC No.13343/2011 and batch
matters. It was also submitted that the letter dated 11.01.1991 should be read in consonance with
earlier circular with respect to Hindi Vidyapeeth Deoghar wherein it has been mentioned that any
recognition given to such degrees including Sahityaalankar is only for the purpose of Hindi
examination and not at par with graduation or equivalence and in this regard reliance is placed
upon Press Note dated 05.05.1988 issued by the Central Government.
10. Having regard to the stand of the appellants and reliance placed upon order dated 25.11.2008
and the Press Note dated 05.05.1988 and the subsequent decision in CWJC 13343/2011 etc. and in
the interest of justice without commenting on the merit of the case, we deem it necessary to remit
the matter back to the High Court for consideration afresh. Patna High Court CWJC No.5129 of
2009 dt.18-07-2019
11. In the light of the aforesaid discussion, the impugned order is set aside and the same is remitted
back to the High Court for consideration of the matter afresh after affording sufficient opportunity
to both the parties. Liberty granted to the parties to file additional documents/pleadings. We
request the High Court to dispose of the matter as expeditiously as possible. The appeals are
disposed of accordingly. Consequently, intervention application stands disposed of granting liberty
to the interveners to approach the High Court in accordance with law. In the facts and
circumstances of the case, we make no order as to costs."
5. It appears that before the Apex Court the argument advanced on behalf of the State was, that in
view of the notification by the Human Resources Department that the degree of Sahityalankar
awarded by Deoghar Vidyapeeth is not valid for employment which was further sought to be
substantiated with the aid of the Press Note dated 05.05.1988 issued by the Central Government
and a subsequent judgment of this Court by a learned Single Judge in the case of Reeta Srivastava &
Ors. State of Bihar & Ors., reported in 2012 (3) PLJR 353, it was contended that the claim of the
petitioners Patna High Court CWJC No.5129 of 2009 dt.18-07-2019 cannot be accepted, inasmuch
as, the Human Resources Department vide its notification dated 27.08.2008 had not treated the
said degree obtained by the petitioners as equivalent to Graduation. Consequently, the argument
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131319947/ 11
The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Vidya Shankar Mishra And Ors on 18 July, 2019
was that they were not possessed of the minimum eligibility educational qualifications and,
therefore, they could not claim employment.
6. The Apex Court, as is evident from the judgment extracted hereinabove, proceeded to set aside
the judgment of the High Court without commenting on the merits of the case for a consideration
afresh in the light of the judgment of the learned Single Judge referred to hereinabove, the press
note of the Central Government as also the notification issued by the Government of Bihar through
the Human Resources Department referred to hereinabove.
7. This is how on remittance, the matter has been heard by us where during the pendency of these
writ petitions and appeals the State Government has come up with two notifications dated
08.04.2016 and 24.08.2017. The said notifications have a direct bearing on the issue involved and,
therefore, we reproduce the said notifications hereinunder:

8. The contention raised on behalf of the petitioners is that even assuming for the sake of arguments
that the challenge raised to the rules as being ultra vires may be kept aside for the time being, then
in that event this subsequent Patna High Court CWJC No.5129 of 2009 dt.18-07-2019 development
fortifies the stand of the petitioners and they are entitled to the benefits under the said notifications.
It may be pointed out that one of the petitioners Sanjay Kumar who is possessed of a degree of
Sahityalankar obtained prior to the year 2008 was an applicant and he was offered appointment on
26.12.2015 which is prior to the aforesaid two notifications. The other writ-petitioner Azad Kumar
Singh has been appointed on 11.10.2014 which is also prior to the date of the said notifications. The
petitioner Sanjay Kumar's services were terminated on 13.02.2016 after the matter was remitted
back by the Supreme Court whereas Azad Kumar Singh is still working.
9. It is in this background that we passed the following order on 11th July, 2019 calling upon the
learned Advocate General to answer this issue:
"Heard Shri Bindhyachal Singh, learned counsel for the petitioner, and the learned Advocate
General for the State of Bihar.
This writ petition was allowed on 17th of November, 2009. The issue raised in the petition is very
simple, namely that the petitioner herein, who had applied for the post of Librarian, was possessed
of the degree of Sahitya Alankar from Hindi Vidya Peeth, Deoghar which degree was not being
accepted Patna High Court CWJC No.5129 of 2009 dt.18-07-2019 as a valid degree equivalent to
Graduation for the purpose of appointment on the said post.
The Division Bench held in favour of the petitioner against which the State of Bihar preferred a
Special Leave Petition before the Apex Court that was converted into Civil Appeal No.4274 of 2014.
The said appeals were allowed by the Apex Court on 6th January, 2016, but the matter was
remanded to be considered again by the High Court. The petitioner had by that time joined his
services, but the same came to be terminated on 13th February, 2016 after the Supreme Court
judgement. The order has been assailed in I.A. No.219 of 2017.
Subsequent thereto, the Government issued a notification on 8th April, 2016 which has been filed as
Annexure 7 to the aforesaid I.A. The said notification categorically states that the earlier notification
giving equivalence on 11th January 1991 stands annulled with effect from 7th May, 2012 in the light
of the decision of this Court in the case of Reeta Srivastava & Ors. vs. State of Bihar & Ors., reported
in 2012 (3) P.L.J.R. 353. It may be noted that the date of delivery of the said judgement is 7.5.2012
and, therefore, the State Government appears to have made the notification effective from the date
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131319947/ 14
The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Vidya Shankar Mishra And Ors on 18 July, 2019
of the judgement of the learned Patna High Court CWJC No.5129 of 2009 dt.18-07-2019 Single
Judge. It may not be out of place to mention here that two L.P.A's. were filed against the aforesaid
judgement of the learned Single Judge being L.P.A. No.953 of 2012 and L.P.A. No.1303 of 2012 as
well as other connected L.P.A's that came to be dismissed on 26.11.2012. Consequently, the
judgement dated 7.5.2012 of the learned Single Judge has been upheld by the Division Bench.
However, the notification dated 08.04.2016 categorically in the last sentence states that any
appointment or promotion made on the basis of the degree awarded prior to 7.5.2012 shall not be
affected.
A clarification was sought by different Departments in respect of the aforesaid notification and the
State Government sought the opinion of the learned Advocate General whereafter it issued another
notification on 24.8.2017 that has been brought on record along with I.A. No.7827 of 2017. The said
notification specifically clarifies that any appointments made on the basis of a degree obtained prior
to 7.5.2012 and between 7.5.2012 and 8.4.2016 shall remain unaffected.
The contention of the petitioner, therefore, is that in the present case, even though the
advertisement was Patna High Court CWJC No.5129 of 2009 dt.18-07-2019 made in the year 2006
and selections held thereafter, the petitioner had to fight his litigative battle and, ultimately, he was
granted appointment on 26.12.2015. The petitioner, therefore, contends that this appointment
having been made prior to 8.4.2016 stands saved under the notification dated 24.8.2017 read with
the notification dated 8.4.2016.
It is, therefore, submitted that such appointment could not have been invalidated, yet the services of
the petitioner have been terminated on 13th February, 2016 that has been challenged as noted
above.
The learned Advocate General prays that the matter be taken up on Wednesday.
Put up on Wednesday i.e. 17th July, 2019."
10. The main plank of the argument of the learned Advocate General is to the effect that in view of
the notification dated 27.08.2008 issued by the Human Resources Department, which has not been
rescinded or modified till date, no employment could be given to a teacher who has to possess a
Graduate qualification as prescribed under the rules and not an equivalent qualification as claimed
by them which does not Patna High Court CWJC No.5129 of 2009 dt.18-07-2019 stand recognized.
He therefore laid emphasis on the fact that firstly the qualification of the writ-petitioner is from an
Institution which is not recognized and secondly the said qualification is not equivalent as per the
notifications of the State Government issued by the Human Resources Department.
11. Replying to the contention in relation to the notifications dated 08.04.2016 and 24.08.2017 he
submits that these are notifications issued by the State Government through the General
Administrative Department and the same would not apply in relation to appointment of teachers
who are under the control of the Human Resources Department, Government of Bihar. His further
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131319947/ 15
The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Vidya Shankar Mishra And Ors on 18 July, 2019
contention is that they are to hold a specialized post where a qualification of Graduation is required
as prescribed and any equivalent qualification is not permissible. He, therefore, submits that there is
no question of any discrimination or arbitrariness or even unreasonableness so as to treat the
petitioners to be ineligible. Commenting upon the two notifications referred to above he submits
that these are notifications issued by the General Administrative Department of the Government of
Bihar but they do not relate to the Human Resources Department and would not apply at all in
respect of these two writ-petitioners or any other similarly situated Patna High Court CWJC
No.5129 of 2009 dt.18-07-2019 claimant. He has invited the attention of the Court to every line of
the said notification to contend that even though the said notifications take notice of the
developments in the present matter and relate to the Education Department, yet the notification
dated 27.08.2008 cannot be said to have been affected in any manner so as to render any relief to
the writ-
petitioners.
12. On behalf of the writ-petitioners a Division Bench judgment in L.P.A. No. 562 of 2015 Shilpi
Singh Vs. State of Bihar and others has been pressed into service to urge that these issues were taken
notice of and it has been held that those who were possessed of degrees prior to 27.08.2008, any
subsequent disqualification arising out of the said notification would not affect the validity of the
said degrees. We have considered the reasoning given in the said judgment and we entirely agree
with the same.
13. Coming to the argument of the learned Advocate General on the two notifications referred to
above, what we find is that it was only on account of this litigation in the Education Department that
the entire matter travelled up to the Apex Court and it is the same issue which became the concern
of the General Administrative Department, Government Patna High Court CWJC No.5129 of 2009
dt.18-07-2019 of Bihar which is a wing of the same Government. We may clarify that the State
Government in the name of His Excellency the Governor is empowered to issue notifications in
respect of all subjects on which the Government can legislate under List-II as well as under List-III
and, therefore, any executive instruction is clearly traceable to Article 162 of the Constitution of
India. The notifications, therefore, issued by one Department or the other in the name of the
Governor is a notification by the Government.
14. To clarify it further the notification dated 08.04.2016 has been communicated to all departments
with a direction to take appropriate action. This is evident from the last note to the notification
dated 08.04.2016 extracted hereinabove.
It is therefore more than evident, and with the utmost clarity, that the entire issue pertaining to the
equivalence of qualification was not confined only to the General Administrative Department but
was clearly made applicable to all departments of the Government irrespective of the nature of
employment. The argument of the learned Advocate General so as to treat the employments in
question in the present case being distinguishable from the other departments cannot be accepted,
inasmuch as, it is in this very litigation that the matter has Patna High Court CWJC No.5129 of 2009
dt.18-07-2019 travelled up to the Apex Court which has been noticed by the State Government for
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131319947/ 16
The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Vidya Shankar Mishra And Ors on 18 July, 2019
certifying the issue relating to all Government Departments.
15. Thus, the argument to split up the applicability of the said notifications and to apply only to the
General Administrative Department is a futile argument, more so keeping in view the fact, that the
said notification was further substantiated through the clarification in the notification dated 24th
August, 2017 extracted hereinabove. We, therefore, find that the State itself has fortified the stand of
the petitioners by issuing a clarification and which, therefore, clearly contradicts the arguments
which have been advanced on behalf of the State.
We find no reason to accept any of the submissions on behalf of the State to the effect that the
notifications dated 08.04.2016 and 24.08.2017 do not apply to the Education/Human Resources
Department. The clarificatory notification also in its last note again mentions the fact that the same
is being sent to all departments for information and appropriate action.
16. In the light of what has been concluded by us hereinabove, these writ petitions have to succeed
on account of this subsequent development and we accordingly hold that the petitioners in both the
writ petitions are entitled to the benefit of Patna High Court CWJC No.5129 of 2009 dt.18-07-2019
the notifications dated 08.04.2016 and 24.08.2017 and consequently their appointments being prior
to the issuance of the said notifications are saved thereunder. The petitioner Sanjay Kumar shall,
therefore, be reinstated in service forthwith and his termination order dated 13.02.2016 that has
been brought on record through I.A. No. 219 of 2017 is hereby quashed. Both the writ petitioners
shall be treated to have been validly appointed of being possessed of the qualification referred to
above and shall be entitled to all consequential benefits.
17. We may now proceed to consider the claim set forth in C.W.J.C. No. 16183 of 2012 that was
referred to the Division Bench by a learned Single Judge as it raised the same issue and L.P.A. No.
894 of 2016. In these two matters the claim of the writ-petitioners and the appellant respectively are
with regard to promotional benefits in the higher scale of pay after having served for 8 years as an
Assistant Teacher. They were denied promotional pay-scale only on the ground that they did not
possess the minimum eligibility qualification as prescribed and were claiming benefits on the
strength of the degree of Sahityalankar from Deoghar Hindi Vidyapeeth. In view of what has been
concluded by us hereinabove, the petitioner of C.W.J.C. No. 16183 of 2012 and the appellant of
L.P.A. No. 894 Patna High Court CWJC No.5129 of 2009 dt.18-07-2019 of 2016 are both entitled to
the benefits of promotion and the same cannot be denied merely on the ground that they were
possessed of an equivalent degree as referred to hereinabove. It is undisputed that these two are also
in possession of the degree of Sahityalankar having been obtained prior to the year 2008.
Accordingly, C.W.J.C. No. 16183 of 2012 and L.P.A. No. 894 of 2016 are allowed. The impugned
judgment of the learned Single Judge dated 28.03.2016 is set aside. Since both the candidates have
prayed for a mandamus, we accordingly direct the competent authority to pass an appropriate order
in the light of above within three weeks from the date of presentation of the certified copy of the
order served on them with effect from the date they were entitled for such benefit together with all
consequential benefits.

L.P.A. No. 1210 of 2010 and L.P.A. No. 307 of
18. These two appeals have been filed by the State questioning the correctness of the judgment of the
learned Single Judge whereby the respondent writ-petitioners have been extended the benefit of
equivalent qualification having been obtained by them from Deoghar Hindi Vidyapeeth. In the light
of what has been stated by us hereinabove, we do not find any Patna High Court CWJC No.5129 of
2009 dt.18-07-2019 merit in these two appeals which are hereby dismissed.
I.A. No. 6128 of 2016 in C.W.J.C. No. 5129 of 2009, I.A. No. 3543 of 2016 and 230 of 2017 in

19. All these Interlocutory Applications have been filed by candidates contending that they are
entitled to similar benefits. We are of the opinion that they will have to prefer their individual writ
petitions and, therefore, all the Interlocutory Applications are disposed of with liberty to all the
applicants to approach the appropriate forum for the redressal of their grievances.
