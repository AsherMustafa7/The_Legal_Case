-Versus-
O/C Khongjom & Anr ... Respondents
BEFORE HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE A.GUNESHWAR SHARMA 17.10.2023 Present Mr.K.Achouba,
learned counsel for the petitioner Mr.R.K.Umakanta, learned PP for the State and Mr.S.Jhaljit,
learned counsel for the respondent No.2.
On 4.10.2023 Mr.K.Achouba, learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that charge-sheet has not
been submitted before the Trial Court and as such, the petitioner would be entitled to default bail.
This Court directed the learned P.P. to verify whether charge-sheet has been submitted or not.
Today, the learned PP submitted a letter dated 6.10.2023 sent by the learned Special PP to the
Special Judge, POCSO Thoubal stating that the charge-sheet was submitted before the Special Court
on 12.09.2023 and on 27.09.2023 cognizance was taken. Letter dated 6.10.2023 and order dated
27.09.2023 are taken on record.
On 4.10.2023, learned counsel for the accused orally made a submission for default bail before this
Court on the ground that charge sheet has not been submitted till date. However, as per order dated
27.09.2023 charge sheet was submitted before the Trial Court on 12.09.2023 and hence, the prayer
for default bail is no longer available to the accused person.
Mr.Achouba, learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner has been in custody for
10 (ten) months without any trial and relevant papers have not been furnished to him and next date
is fixed on 23.10.2023 for appearance of the accused and it is submitted that it may take a
considerable time for completion of the trial and the accused may be released.
