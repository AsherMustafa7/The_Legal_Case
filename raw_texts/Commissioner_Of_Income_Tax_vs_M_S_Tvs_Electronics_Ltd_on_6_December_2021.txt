COMMON JUDGMENT
(Judgment of the Court was delivered by R.MAHADEVAN, J.) These tax case appeals have been
filed by the appellant/Revenue, challenging the order dated 30.10.2009 passed by the Income Tax
Appellate Tribunal, Chennai 'C' Bench, in I.TA.No.2303/Mds/2008, I.TA.No.2304/ Mds/2008,
I.TA.No.224/Mds/2009 and I.TA.No.225/Mds/2009 respectively, relating to the assessment years
2000-01 and 2001-02.
2. On 20.08.2010, T.C.A Nos. 656 and 657 of 2010 have been admitted by this Court on the
following substantial question of law:
“Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case the Tribunal was right in holding
that the reopening of assessment was not valid in law and thereby setting aside the
reassessment proceeding?
3. On the same day namely 20.08.2010, T.C.A Nos. 658 and 659 of 2010 have been admitted by this
Court on the following substantial questions of law:
“(1) Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was right in
holding that the revenue's appeal is infructuous?
(2) Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case assessee is entitled for
deduction under section 35(2A)?
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis TCA.Nos.656, 657, 658 & 659 of 2010 (3) Whether on the facts
and circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was right in holding that the direction to the Assessing
Officer by the commissioner of income Tax (Appeals) with respect to 244A interest on refund was
justified?
(4) Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was right in holding that the
interest under section 234D is not leviable on the assessee?
4.1 Today, when the matters were taken up for consideration, the learned counsel for the
appellant/Revenue as well as the respondent/assessee jointly submitted that the substantial
question of law raised in TCA Nos.656 and 657 of 2010 and the substantial question of law Nos. 1
and 2 in TCA.Nos. 658 and 659 of 2010 are covered in favour of the assessee; and the fourth
substantial question of law in TCA Nos.658 and 659 of 2010 is covered in favour of the Revenue, by
judgment dated 19.03.2019, passed in TCA.Nos.1457 and 1458 of 2008, the relevant passage of
which, is usefully extracted hereunder:

Commissioner Of Income Tax vs M/S. Tvs Electronics Ltd on 6 December, 2021
"4.Mr.M.Swaminathan, learned senior standing counsel for the appellant – Revenue,
has submitted that since the assessee did not produce the requisite approval of the
Scientific Research undertaken by him for the period in question though such
approval was available for the period prior to Assessment Year 2003-2004 and for
the period subsequent to it, the mandatory condition of producing the approval for
the Assessment Year in question was not complied with by the Assessee and
therefore, the learned Tribunal erred in allowing such weighted deduction of
expenditure incorporated under Section 35(2AB) of the Act.
5.On the Second Question of Levy of Interest under section 234D of the Act on the
excess refund made to the Assessee along with the Assessment intimation sent to him
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis TCA.Nos.656, 657, 658 & 659 of 2010 under
section 143(1) of the Act, the learned senior standing counsel for the Revenue drew
our attention to a judgment of this court in the case of Commissioner of Income Tax
v. Fisher Sanmar Ltd, (2014) 361 ITR 296 (Mad), wherein, a Division Bench of this
Court held that if the regular assessment of the Assessee is made after the
amendment of provisions of Section 234D of the Act w.e.f. 01.06.2003, then, the
provisions of Section 234D for levy of interest on the excess refund amount would
become applicable, even though the assessment period may be prior to the said date
of amendment.” “7. We do not concur with the submission made by the learned
Senior Standing Counsel for the Revenue Mr.M.Swaminathan on the First Question
of allowability of weighted deduction to the Assessee under Section 35 (2AB) of the
Act since the requisite approval for the project on which expenditure was incurred by
the Assessee on Scientific Research was approved for the period prior and even
subsequent to Assessment Year 2003-2004. In the case before us, we are of the
opinion that the said condition of approval stood substantially complied with. The
Assessee had contended before the authorities below that approval from the Ministry
concerned of the Central Government for the year in question was also under active
consideration and awaited.
8. The Assessee cannot be punished for the bureaucratic delay in giving such
approval for the year in question, which was in the hands of the Department
concerned of the Central Government itself. On the very fact that for the period
anterior and posterior to the year in question such approval was very well on the
record of the Revenue, the weighted deduction for the expenditure incurred on the
Scientific Research could not have been disallowed by the authorities below and,
therefore, the learned Tribunal, in our view, rightly held such Scientific Research
expenditure to be allowable under Section 35 (2AB) of the Act. Therefore, first two
Questions of Law are answered in favour of the Assessee and against the Revenue.
9. As for the Question of Levy of Interest under Section 234D of the Act, though
computation of interest will depend upon the appeal effect order to be passed, the
quantum of net payment is to be determined accordingly, after allowing
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis TCA.Nos.656, 657, 658 & 659 of 2010 weighted
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/31472061/ 3
Commissioner Of Income Tax vs M/S. Tvs Electronics Ltd on 6 December, 2021
deduction under Section 35 (2AB) of the Act, as indicated above. The provisions of
Section 234D of the Act have been held applicable for Assessment Year 2003-2004 in
question in terms of the decision of the Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in the case of
Fisher Sanmar Ltd., cited supra. Accordingly, Questions of Law Nos.3 and 4 are
answered in favour of the Revenue and against the Assessee.
10. Appeals of the Revenue are allowed in part, as above. No costs."
4.2 In the light of the above judgment, which squarely applies to the facts of the present case, the
substantial question of law in TCA Nos.656 and 657 of 2010 relating to reassessment proceedings
for deduction under section 35(2A) and the substantial question of law Nos.1 and 2 in TCA Nos.658
and 659 of 2010, are answered in favour of the assessee and against the Revenue and the fourth
substantial question of law in TCA Nos.658 and 659 of 2010 is answered in favour of the Revenue
and against the assessee.
5.1 In addition, the learned counsel for the appellant / Revenue fairly submitted that the third
substantial question of law raised in TCA.Nos. 658 and 659 of 2010 is covered by the decision of this
court in Commissioner of Income Tax v. Upasana Finance Ltd (2021) 129 taxmann.com 253
(Madras), wherein, this court placed reliance on the judgments of the supreme court in
Commissioner of Income Tax, Gujarat vs. Gujarat Fluoro Chemicals (2014) 42 taxmann.com 1 (SC)
and the Division Bench of the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis TCA.Nos.656, 657, 658 & 659 of
2010 Delhi High Court in CIT v. Indian Farmer Fertilizer Co-operative (2016) 71 taxmann.com 37,
to the legal proposition that “the only amount which an assessee aggrieved by delayed payment can
legitimately claim under the statute, is interest and that, no other interest on such statutory interest
is payable”; and “to the extent it directs payment of any sum over and above interest payable under
section 244A(1) to the assessee cannot be upheld” and accordingly, decided the issue in favour of the
Revenue.
5.2 For better appreciation, the relevant passage of the judgments referred to above, are extracted
hereunder:
Supreme Court in Gujarat Fluoro Chemicals (supra)
"6. In our considered view, the aforesaid judgment has been misquoted and misinterpreted by the
assessees and also by the Revenue. They are of the view that in Sandvik Asia Ltd's case (supra), this
Court had directed the Revenue to pay interest on the statutory in case of delay in the payment. In
other words, the interpretation placed is that the Revenue is obliged to pay an interest on interest in
the event of its failure to refund the interest payable within the statutory period.
7. As we have already noticed, in Sandvik Asia Ltd.'s case (supra) this Court was considering the
issue whether an assessee who is made to wait for refund of interest for decades be compensated for
the great prejudice caused to it due to the delay in its payment after the lapse of statutory period. In
the facts of that case, this Court, had come to the conclusion that there was an inordinate delay on
the part of the revenue in refunding certain amount which included the statutory interest and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/31472061/ 4
Commissioner Of Income Tax vs M/S. Tvs Electronics Ltd on 6 December, 2021
therefore, directed the Revenue to pay compensation for the same not an interest on interest.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis TCA.Nos.656, 657, 658 & 659 of 2010
8. Further, it is brought to our notice that the Legislature by the Act No.4 of 1988 (w.e.f.01.04.1989)
has inserted Section 244A to the Act which provides for interest on refunds under various
contingencies. We clarify that it is only that interest provided for under the statute which may be
claimed by an assessee from the Revenue and no other interest on such statutory interest."
Delhi High Court in Indian Farmer Fertilizer Co-operative case (supra):
“8. In Sandvik Asia Ltd (supra), the Court admittedly was dealing with facts prior to
the insertion of Section 244A. Therefore, it would be inappropriate for this court to
consider that judgment now as binding authority. More importantly, Sandvik Asia
Ltd (supra) was explained by the larger Bench i.e., three Judge Bench decision in
Gujarat Fluoro Chemicals (supra) where the supreme court categorically held that the
only amount which an assessee aggrieved by delayed payment can legitimately claim
under the statute is interest and that “no other interest on such statutory interest” is
payable. This ruling, in the opinion of this court, rendered by a larger Bench, would
have to be followed as opposed to the ratio in H.E.G Ltd (supra) where the Supreme
Court had expressed a contrary opinion by indicating that the interest component
towards the delayed payment of the tax refund would partake of the character of the
'amount of due' under section 244A. In other words, H.E.G Ltd. (supra) seems to
suggest that there would be dues on bar, refund and delayed interest. Clearly, that
view has not been approved in Gujarat Fluoro Chemicals (supra). It was urged during
the hearing that India Trade Promotion Organisation (supra) has become final since
the revenue's appeal was withdrawn. This court is of the opinion that such detail
notwithstanding, the law declared in Gujarat Fluoro Chemicals (supra) is binding and
permits no deviation”.
5.3 Following the aforesaid judgments, the third substantial question of law involved in T.C.A. Nos.
658 and 659 of 2010 is answered in favour of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis TCA.Nos.656, 657,
658 & 659 of 2010 the Revenue. Accordingly, the orders passed by the Income Tax Appellate
Tribunal are set aside and the matter is remitted back to the Assessing Officer for fresh
consideration, in the light of the ratio laid down by the supreme court in Gujarat Fluoro Chemicals
(supra) and pass orders, after giving notice to the assessee.
6. All the Tax Case Appeals are disposed of in the above terms. No costs. Consequently, connected
miscellaneous petitions are closed.
