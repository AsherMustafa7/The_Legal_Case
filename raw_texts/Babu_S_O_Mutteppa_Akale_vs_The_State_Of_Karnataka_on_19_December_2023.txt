CRL.A No. 100365 of 2022
C/W CRL.RC No. 100001 of 2022
JUDGMENT
Reference under Section 366 of Code of Criminal Procedure is made to this court consequent to
imposition of death sentence on accused nos.1 to 3 for the offence punishable under Section 302 of
Indian Penal Code. Accused nos.1 to 3 (for short 'the accused') have also filed an appeal challenging
their conviction.
2. The prosecution case relates to an incident dated 22.10.2013 of killing two persons, a male by
name Basavaraj and a female by name Sangeeta as they were found to be having illicit relationship.
Accused no.1 is the husband of Sangeeta. Accused no.2 is the brother and accused nos.3 and 4 are
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132349268/ 3
Babu S/O Mutteppa Akale vs The State Of Karnataka on 19 December, 2023
the cousins of the first accused. The 4th accused was a juvenile and he was tried separately. The
incident, as projected by the prosecution, occurred like this:
3. All the four accused gathered in front of the house of Basavaraj around 10.30 p.m. on 22.10.2013,
and shouted at Basavaraj loudly asking him to come out of his NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB house.
As he came out, they dragged him and tied to a Jali tree situated in a nearby agricultural land.
Thereafter Sangeeta was dragged to the same place from her house and tied to the same tree by
accused nos.1 and 2. As loud voice of calling out Basavaraj attracted the attention of neighbours,
many people gathered. When PW2 and some others interfered to question the accused about what
they were doing, second accused showed a mobile phone and asked them to listen to a conversation
recorded therein and said that they should watch as to how Basavaraj and Sangeeta would be slain.
By that time accused no.1 brought three sickles from his house, gave one sickle to accused no.2, the
other to accused no.3 and held one with him. They hacked Basavaraj and Sangeeta with the sickles
inflicting injuries all over their bodies. When PW2 somehow showed courage and rushed to their
rescue, all the accused brandished the sickles at them and threatened to kill all those who would
interfere. PW2 sustained an injury to his left hand while avoiding a blow on him. Basavaraj and
Sangeeta met instantaneous death.
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB
4. This incident was reported to police by PW2 at 8'o clock on 23.10.2013. Ex.P.2 is the report of
incident given by PW2 to the police. He narrated the incident and also stated that the accused had
used a charging battery as a source of light at the time when they were committing crime.
5. PWs.2, 10, 11, 12, 17, 18, 19 and 22 were the eyewitnesses. PW17, 18 and 19 did not support the
prosecution during trial, only PWs. 2, 10, 11, 12 and 22 supported the prosecution establishing the
incident of killing Basavaraj and Sangeeta. Placing reliance on the testimonies of these witnesses,
the trial court recorded a finding that the prosecution was able to prove its case beyond reasonable
doubt and finding the incident as the rarest of rare, imposed death sentence on accused nos.1 to 3
besides imposing sentence for the offences under sections 307 and 506 read with 34 IPC as the
charge sheet was also filed for those offences.
6. We heard the arguments of Sri Vishwanath S. NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB Bichagatti, learned
counsel for accused nos.1 to 3 and Sri M.B. Gundwade, learned Additional State Public Prosecutor.
Arguments were over on 14.09.2023 and the cases were reserved for judgment. But on 09.10.2023
we passed an order calling for reports from the jail authority, the probation officer and the
psychiatrist in view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Manoj and Others vs State of
M.P1. We also directed the jail authority to produce the prisoners i.e., accused 1 to 3 before the court
on 12.10.2023. When they were produced on 12.10.2023, they submitted an application with a
request to permit them to engage a senior counsel for further arguments. To meet the ends of
justice, we permitted them and fixed the date of hearing on 04.11.2023. On that day, learned
counsel, Sri Yug Mohith Chaudhry appeared on behalf of accused 1 to 3, and prayed for time to
argue. We fixed the next date of hearing on 25.11.2023. We heard the argument of Sri Yug Mohith
Chaudhry, who has also filed his synopsis of (2023) 2 SCC 353 NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132349268/ 4
Babu S/O Mutteppa Akale vs The State Of Karnataka on 19 December, 2023
argument. We also heard the reply of Sri M.B.Gundwade, learned Additional State Public
Prosecutor.
7. Sri. Yug Mohith Chaudhry argued about delay in registration of FIR. His argument was this: PW2
claims to be an eye witness to the incident that occurred in between 10.30 p.m. and 11.30 p.m. on
22.10.2013; he and other eye witnesses went home immediately after the incident; PW2 did not
think it necessary to make a report of the incident to the police immediately after the incident and
he would go to police station at 8 O'clock on the next day. No witness has given any explanation for
the delay. PW2 has admitted that he had a mobile phone and the family of deceased had four to five
phones. They had motorcycles also. PW10, an eye witness claims to have made a call to his uncle,
Ashok and contacted several persons in the village. It is inexplicable as to why none of them did not
call the police or a doctor when they were calling other persons. Referring to evidence given by
PW12, he argued that according to PW2, PW12 wrote the report, but PW12 NC:
2023:KHC-D:14868-DB has given entirely a different version by stating that they informed the
police about the incident only after they came to spot the next morning. He also argued that PW13,
the father of Sangeeta, was informed of the incident in the midnight around 1 O'clock. When PW13
came to spot and enquired how the offence had taken place, he was told that they did not know of it,
and therefore the evidence of PW13 would undermine the version proffered by PW2 in FIR. He then
argued that in Ex.P2, the report made by PW2, it is clearly written that they had discussion in the
house during that night, and it shows that FIR was as a result of deliberation, and therefore what is
written in Ex.P2 is not the truth. In this regard he has referred to some decided cases.
8. Sri Vishwanath Bichagatti argued that conviction recorded by the trial court for the offences
under section 307 and 506 IPC is wrong in as much as the accused did not have any intention to kill
PW2, what the evidence discloses is that when he interfered, he sustained an
- 10 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB injury; it does not disclose that the accused had an intention to make
an attempt on the life of PW2. The accused might have threatened those who tried to interfere, but it
would not amount to causing intimidation within the meaning of Section 506 of IPC and hence the
conviction of the accused for these two offences should be set aside.
8.1. In regard to the offence under section 302 of IPC, his argument was in this way: Though the
testimonies of the eye witnesses namely PWs.2, 10, 11, 12 and 22 is believable in spite of hostile
evidence given by PWs.17, 18 and 19, the prosecution case cannot be brought within the purview of
offence punishable under section 302 IPC. His argument was that if the trial court had listened to
the conversation between the two deceased which was recorded in a memory card marked as
M.O.29, it was possible for taking a different view in the sense that punishment under part II of
section 304 could have been imposed. Elaborating, Sri Bichagatti submitted that it was
- 11 -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132349268/ 5
Babu S/O Mutteppa Akale vs The State Of Karnataka on 19 December, 2023
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB a known fact that both the deceased had illicit relationship and they
continued their relationship in spite of advice by the elders of both the families. As the relationship
continued, it was quite natural for accused no.1 being the husband of Sangeeta to get enraged
especially after listening to the conversation recorded in M.O.29. Though it is true that accused no.1
did not react immediately after coming to know of the illicit relationship of his wife with Basavaraj,
the materials brought on record indicate that all the accused found the illicit relation to be an
infringement of the reputation of their family and that frustration persisted in them for a long time.
The line of argument of Sri Vishwanath Bichagatti was that though it was within the knowledge of
accused no.1 that his wife had relationship with Basavaraj, he did not react immediately and he
expected reformation in his wife. The knowledge of illicit relationship which he tolerated for many
days ultimately led to provocation. The evidence discloses all these aspects and if the resultant act
was killing, it was on account of sustained provocation which could be brought
- 12 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB within the scope of Exception no.1 to Section 300 of IPC. In this view,
he argued that the accused could only be punished under part II of Section 304 of IPC and since
they have been in jail since 30.10.2013, the date of their arrest, this period could be set off and they
be released. In support of his argument he placed reliance on many decided cases to which we refer
later on.
9. But Sri. Yug Mohith Chaudhry put forward his argument some what differently. The unnatural
conduct of PW2, 10, 11, 12 and 22 at the time of occurrence and their parroting the prosecution
version are sufficient enough to disbelieve their testimonies as eye witnesses. One of the eye
witnesses was mother of Basavaraj, the deceased, and the others were his first cousins. When
Basavaraj was being dragged they did not protest and question the accused why they were doing so.
They also did not untie Basavaraj from the tree when the accused went to bring Sangeeta. When
both the deceased were being assaulted, they did not rush to their rescue. After the incident was
- 13 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB over, none of them went near the tree to untie the deceased and check
whether they were still alive or not. No efforts were made by them to take Basavaraj to hospital
immediately. The eye witnesses have not given any explanation for not calling the police or going to
police station. The explanation given by the eye witnesses that they did not attempt to rescue since
they were threatened does not stand up to scrutiny. All these notable features in their evidence
demonstrate their unnatural conduct not expected of close relatives. All the witnesses have given
evidence in orchestrated chorus; their evidence appears like parroted versions of events.
9.1. Referring to evidence of PW2 in particular, Sri. Yug Mohith Chaudhry argued that the evidence
of PW2 is unbelievable for yet another reason that he has stated about an attempt made by accused
no.1 to kill him. The medical evidence shows that PW2 suffered a simple miniscule abrasion caused
by a hard and blunt object. The medical evidence completely improbabilises the evidence
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132349268/ 6
Babu S/O Mutteppa Akale vs The State Of Karnataka on 19 December, 2023
- 14 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB of eye witnesses and therefore explanation sought to be offered by the
eye witnesses about threat posed to them by the accused is another falsehood. This unnatural
conduct of the witnesses makes it explicit that they are interested witnesses, for only such witnesses
have the tendency to give false evidence. When independent eye witnesses turn hostile, the evidence
of related witnesses requires corroboration. In the absence of corroboration, their evidence cannot
be believed. Thus argued Sri. Yug Mohith Chaudhry.
9.2. Continuing the argument Sri. Yug Mohith Chaudhry also focused on provocation sustained by
the accused on account of illicit relationship between the two deceased to emphasize that this case is
not fit for recording conviction under section 302 IPC. His argument was that spousal infidelity is
the gravest kind of provocation that law has recognized; it cuts to quick and inflicts deep wounds.
There is no recorded judgment that has held that spousal infidelity is not a grave form of
- 15 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB provocation. In this case, the accused and the family of the deceased
had been advising the deceased not to continue their relationship. The deeply intimate and familiar
conversation between the two lovers would certainly provoke the accused who are young men from a
rural and patriarchal society. The test of suddenness is not merely a mechanical question of
proximity of time or the quantum of time intervening between provocation and assault; the real and
substantial question is whether there was time and opportunity for the accused to cool down and
break free from provocation. Premeditated acts of murder are normally accompanied either by an
attempt to kill secretly, or an attempt by the accused to shield themselves and to conceal the offence.
These elements are missing in the present case, instead the evidence discloses that, the accused did
not go to the house of Basavaraj with weapons, that they did not bring Sangeeta with them to the
house of Basavaraj. Each of the deceased suffered over ten chopped wounds on different parts of
their bodies. The wounds were not inflicted to kill
- 16 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB the deceased, but to vent anger. The large number of injuries reflects
the state of mind of the accused. It was not a mind that had calculatedly decided to kill someone but
an enraged state of mind driven wild with pain and anger, and completely deprived of self control.
In the charge sheet it is clearly mentioned that the accused resorted to killing Basavaraj and
Sangeeta enraged by their illicit relationship. Since it is mentioned in the charge itself that the act
was consequent to enragement, the accused cannot be punished for the offence under section 302
IPC, and if at all they have to be held guilty, they can be convicted for the offence under section 304
IPC.
9.3. His another line of argument was that if for any reason an offence under section 302 IPC can be
said to have been proved, there is no case for imposing capital punishment. The trial court, he
argued, has missed to notice mitigating circumstances overwhelmed by the brutality of the offence.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132349268/ 7
Babu S/O Mutteppa Akale vs The State Of Karnataka on 19 December, 2023
There are critical mitigating circumstances; the accused were in prime youth; they had
- 17 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB no criminal antecedents; the crime was as a result of extreme
emotional disturbance; and provocation and brutal manner of commission of crime by itself is not
enough to give death sentence. The accused have shown inclination to reform themselves. Therefore
there is also a case of commutation of sentence to life imprisonment.
9.4. In regard to role attributed to accused no.2, he argued that the FIR does not indicate his overt
act, and none of the witnesses states that he assaulted both the deceased with a chopper. The
statement of accused no.2 under section 313 Cr.P.C. is that he was not residing with his parents, but
he was living in his wife's house in a different village and this is admitted by PW22. It is well
established in law that explanation given by the accused need not be proved beyond reasonable
doubt. As long as the explanation given by the accused is probable, it should be accepted as true. It is
evident that accused no.2 might have been roped in because of family feuds.
- 18 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB 9.5. The last point Sri. Yug Mohith Chaudhry argued was that, totally
three weapons were used by accused for committing crime. But only two weapons were marked
during trial and they are MO8 and MO9. The prosecution has no explanation for not producing the
third one. That apart, accused no.1 himself surrendered in the police station the very next day, but
the police did not seek his custody with them and instead made an application for transferring him
to judicial custody. This was unheard of in a murder case. Another aspect is that FIR indicated the
names of A2 to A4, but till 29.10.2013, the investigating officer did not give instructions for their
arrest. This only shows that the investigating officer himself did not believe the narrative given by
PW2 in regard to role played by accused nos.2 to 4. With these points Sri. Yug Mohith Chaudhry
concluded his argument.
10. Sri Gundwade, refuting the theory of sustained provocation as projected by Sri Vishwanath
Bichagatti and Sri Yug Mohith Chaudhry, argued that in order to apply the
- 19 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB first Exception to Section 300 IPC, the provocation must be sudden
and grave which renders a person lose his self control and drives him to doing an act resulting in the
death of another. In the present case this kind of a situation is not forthcoming. The relationship
between both the deceased was known to the accused for quite a long time. The tenor of cross
examination indicates that both the deceased had been advised to discontinue their relationship.
They defied the advice of all. The conversation which had been recorded in the memory card
inserted to the mobile phone did not trigger the accused pounce on the deceased immediately after
listening it for the first time. The very fact that they asked the eyewitnesses who rushed to the rescue
of the deceased to hear the recorded conversation indicated that the accused had heard that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132349268/ 8
Babu S/O Mutteppa Akale vs The State Of Karnataka on 19 December, 2023
conversation long back. There was left with them sufficient time gap to think about next course of
action which they implemented on the night of 22.10.2013. Therefore the accused premeditated and
then put their plan into action. For this reason Exception 1 to
- 20 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB Section 300 of IPC cannot be applied. In support of his argument he
referred to a paragraph from judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Dauvaram Nirmalkar Vs.
State of Chattisgarh2 which judgment was referred by Sri Vishwanath Bichagatti and Sri Yug Mohith
Chaudhry. His argument was that the way both the accused were killed shows the brutal and cruel
attitude of the accused. The act of killing demonstrated cruelty of the highest degree and therefore
any punishment less than death is no punishment at all to a situation like this. He submitted that
the principles laid down by the Supreme Court in the cases of Bachan Singh Vs State of Punjab 3 and
Machhi Singh and Others4 are very much applicable. Hence death sentence is to be confirmed.
10.1. Adverting to the argument of Sri. Yug Mohith Chaudhry, Sri.M.B.Gundawade replied that the
eye witnesses were not chance witnesses. Considering the (2022 SCC Online 955) AIR 1980 SC 898
(1983) 3 SCC 470
- 21 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB time when the incident occurred, it was highly impossible to expect a
chance witness to be present at that time. The witnesses were from the same village and neighbours
of the deceased and the accused. They might be related, but their evidence does not disclose any
exaggeration of events; they have not made any attempt to falsely implicate the accused. Their
evidence is consistent which cannot be characterized as parroting. The evidence in fact discloses
attempt made by all the witnesses to rescue the deceased. Though the accused were four in number,
anybody would not dare beyond a limit to risk one's own life. In fact injury sustained by PW2 shows
his attempt to interfere for the protection of the deceased. It is not as though a sharp edged weapon
does not cause an abrasion, it depends on intensity and angle of blow. Therefore looked from any
angle the evidence of PW2, PW10, PW11, PW12 and PW22 cannot be ignored.
11. From the above arguments, we need to answer the following questions :
- 22 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB
(i) Was there delay in registration of FIR?
(ii) Has the trial court erred in relying on the evidence of PWs2, 10, 11, 12 and 22?
(iii) Is the theory of sustained provocation applicable to the facts of the present case
to scale down the offence from Section 302 to Section 304 IPC?
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132349268/ 9
Babu S/O Mutteppa Akale vs The State Of Karnataka on 19 December, 2023
(iv) Whether the finding of the trial court that this is the rarest of the rare case correct
and consequently death punishment is to be confirmed?
(v) Are accused rightly convicted for the offences under sections 307 and 506 IPC?
12. Before answering point no. (i), we may briefly refer to the contents of Ex.P2 lodged by PW2 with
the police on 23.10.2013. The accused suspected illicit relationship between Basavaraj and Sangeeta
and this had given rise to enmity against Basavaraj and his family. At about 10.30 p.m. on
22.10.2013, PW2 went to bed and at that time he heard shouting voice in front of the house of
- 23 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB Basavaraj which was situated near his house. The shouting voices were
that of accused nos.1 to 4 who asked Basavaraj to come out of his house. Hearing the shouts, PW2
and others from the neighbourhood came out and heard all the accused scolding Basavaraj and
dragging him to some other place. PW2 and others followed the accused and requested them to
release Basavaraj. The accused took Basavaraj to their agricultural field and tied Basavaraj to a jali
tree with a rope. Then accused nos.1 and 2 forcibly brought Sangeeta to the same place from the
house and tied her also to that tree. When PW2 and others questioned them as to what they were
doing, accused no.2 showed a mobile phone and asked them to listen to a conversation between
Basavaraj and Sangeeta, and by that time the first accused brought from his house three sickles used
for cutting sugarcane. He gave one sickle to accused no.2, another to accused no.3 and held one in
his hand. Showing the sickles to PW2 and others and saying that since Basavaraj and Sangeeta were
having illicit relationship they should see how both of them would be
- 24 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB hacked, the accused nos.1 to 3 started assaulting both Basavaraj and
Sangeeta with sickles indiscriminately and when PW2 went forward to protect both of them, all the
accused brandished the sickles at them giving a threat that if anybody would come forward, he
would be killed. Accused no.1 rushed to assault PW2 at that time and when the latter tried to escape,
he sustained injury on his left hand. Therefore PW2 and others ran away from that place in fright. It
is stated in Ex.P.2 that the accused had brought a charging battery for the purpose of obtaining light
during the time of attack on Basavaraj and Sangeeta. Point No.(i)
13. On this point of argument, it may be stated thus: It's true that PW2 was the first informant and
Ex.P2 is the report in writing given by him to police for registration of FIR. The scribe of Ex.P2 is
Ravi M. Burj, who adduced oral evidence as PW12. FIR was registered at 8.00 a.m. on 23.10.2013.

14. Registration of FIR at the earliest point of time enhances credibility in it. Unexplained delay may
lead to suspicion in the contents of FIR. But delay always does not matter and assume significance
especially when a ghastly crime takes place. If the first informant is an injured or an eye witness and
if his oral testimony is trustworthy, even if there is delay by a few hours, it cannot be given
prominence. In this case, we may state firstly that the aspect of delay appears to have not been
raised in the trial court; this point has been raised for the first time before us. Be that as it may. It is
true that PW2 has stated that there were mobile phones and motor cycles. But his one answer in the
cross examination indicates a meaning that he was not using the motorcycle at that relevant time.
His clear answer is, "Now only I am using motor cycle" (FUÀ ªÀiÁvÀæ ªÉÆÃmÁgï ¸ÉÊPÀ¯ï
G¥ÀAiÉÆÃV¸ÀÄwÛzÉÝÃ£É). Although nothing prevented him from lodging FIR that night itself
or informing the police at least over the phone, his not doing so cannot be considered to
- 26 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB hold that Ex.P2 was outcome of deliberation and bereft of truth. There
is ample evidence which we are going to discuss to show that he was an eye witness, and what is
written in Ex.P2 is what he had seen. If in Ex.P2, it is written that they all returned home and
consulted each other before lodging the report of incident, it cannot be understood in such a way as
they held discussions to foist a false case against the accused. The meaning of the entire sentence is,
being scared they all returned home, consulted each other about the next course of action to be
taken and since it was late night, they went to the police station in the morning. In Ex.P24, the FIR,
the distance between Mamadapur, the village where the incident occurred and the police station is
mentioned as 35 kms. PW2 and PW12 might have reached the police station before 8 O' clock, which
indicates that they should have left home at least at 7 O'clock in the morning to cover the distance
on the motor cycle. If they thought to stay back home during dark, there is nothing unnatural in it.
There is explanation for this delay, if it is considered as delay.

15. Then about PW10 contacting his uncle by name Ashok and several others, it has to be stated that
he was not the first informant to the police, but he too accompanied PW2 to the police station. He
has clearly stated in cross examination that totally four persons went to police station in the
morning on two motor cycles. Certainly he too could have telephoned the police to inform about the
incident; if he did not, contents of Ex.P2 cannot be disbelieved. He too was an eye witness.
16. It's true that PW12 has stated in examination-in- chief that he told before the Circle Inspector of
Police about the incident when the latter visited his house. This answer was pointed out by Sri. Yug
Mohith Chaudhry to argue that PW12 had not been to the police station and therefore he was not the
scribe which in turn leads to disbelieving Ex.P2. Here we find a mistake committed by the Public
Prosecutor. It was the duty of the Public Prosecutor to elicit from him whether he scribed Ex.P2 or
not, and draw his attention to his signature found on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132349268/ 11
Babu S/O Mutteppa Akale vs The State Of Karnataka on 19 December, 2023
- 28 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB Ex.P2. Anyway this does not matter, in as much as what PW12 has
stated is that he revealed about the incident to CPI, who was not the police officer before whom the
FIR was laid. PW24 was the sub-inspector of police who received Ex.P2 from PW2. PW24 has stated
that he went to spot after registering FIR and untied the dead bodies from the tree, and then
conducted inquest. By that time CPI came to spot, and then PW24 handed over investigation to CPI
who, as PW25 has also stated to have taken over investigation from PW24. That means, PW12 might
have once again revealed the entire incident to PW25. It is there in the evidence of PW25 that he
recorded the statement of PW12(CW15). For this reason, Ex.P2 cannot be said to be a manipulated
version.
17. No inference as to falsity in Ex.P2 can be drawn because PW13 has stated that nobody gave any
information to him when he came to spot. The actual evidence of PW13 who is the father of Sangeeta
in examination-in-chief is that CW1, i.e., PW2 told him that
- 29 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB the accused caused the death of his daughter suspecting her illicit
relationship. And in the cross examination he stated that nobody told him as to how the incident
occurred when he came to the spot. This answer does not mean that PW2 did not tell him about the
incident; the meaning of his answer in the cross examination is that no villager, other than PW2,
who might have come to the spot at 9.30 a.m. when PW13 also went there, might have told him like
that. Those people probably, might not be eye witnesses to the incident. Therefore all the
circumstances figured out by learned counsel to disbelieve FIR based on Ex.P2 do not stand to
reason. Now two decisions cited by Sri. Yug Mohith Choudhry may be referred. In Ganesh Bhavan
Patel and Another Vs. State of Maharashtra,5 it was found that S.I. was found to be highly
interested. One circumstance indicated that FIR did not appear to have been recorded before 3.00
a.m. on 30th November. PSI tried to give an impression that FIR was registered at 8.30 p.m. on
29th November. But one Ravji testified that (1978) 4 SCC 371
- 30 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB his statement was recorded in the police station at 12 midnight or 1.00
a.m. after completion of panchanama of the scene occurrence. Ravji also stated that he might have
signed his statement around 3.00 a.m. If the trial court held that statement of Ravji might have been
recorded between 12 midnight and 1 a.m., the High Court held that PSI might have recorded the
statement around 8.30 p.m. on 29th November. Moreover the investigating officer preferred
recording statements of other witnesses to the eye witnesses, which was found to be unnatural.
Ravji, probably was not an eye witness. In this backdrop delay in registration of FIR was noticed to
be prominent.
18. Rajeevan and Another Vs. State of Kerala6 involves the facts that the incident occurred around
7.00 p.m. on 28.12.1987. SI reached the place of occurrence within half an hour and then returning
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132349268/ 12
Babu S/O Mutteppa Akale vs The State Of Karnataka on 19 December, 2023
to police station, he made a brief note about the incident in the general diary of the police station.
PW1 lodged FIR on 29.12.1987 at 7.40 (2003) 3 SCC 355
- 31 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB a.m., but FIR was sent to the court at 5.40 p.m. on 30.12.1987. Firstly,
a doubt arose as to why the PSI did not register FIR on the basis of information collected by him,
and more than that, in the counterfoil of the FIR, between the entries relating to Crime nos.5 and 7,
certain blank sheets were found. The court found this circumstance for false implication of
appellants due to political bitterness. Therefore FIR was not believed. Delay in dispatch of FIR to the
Magistrate was given prominence.
19. The case on hand does not indicate the existence of the circumstances found in cited decisions.
In our opinion, there was no delay; even if there was delay, it has been explained. Point no.(i) is
answered in negative. Point No. (ii)
20. We have perused the evidence of PW2, PW10, PW11, PW12 and PW22. In the examination in
chief PW2 has given a full account of the incident almost on lines with his first report to the police
i.e., Ex.P2. Since we have already culled out the contents of Ex.P2, we do not think it
- 32 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB necessary to narrate here what he has stated in examination in chief.
PW10, PW11, PW12 and PW22 have spoken in tandem with PW2. None of these witnesses appears
to have been discredited in the cross examination. The suggestions given to them in the cross
examination indicate that the illicit relationship between the two deceased was a known fact to
everybody in the village, that they used to meet in the jawar fields, that they had been advised to
refrain from continuing the relationship, but they did not stop meeting. In regard to the incident,
none of them has been discredited in the cross examination. The testimonies of these witnesses is
sought to be impeached for two reasons that they are interested being related to Basavaraj and their
unnatural conduct in not attempting to protect the deceased.
21. There is no rule that evidence of a related witness must be discarded, the established principle is
that the oral testimony of a related witness must be subjected to scrutiny with a greater
circumspection. If the testimony
- 33 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB appears to be untainted without any attempt to falsely implicate a
person, such kind of evidence can be definitely acted upon. Sri. Yug Mohith Chaudhry has relied on
two judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in State of Orissa Vs. Brahmananda Nanda7 and Amar
Singh Vs. State (NCT of Delhi).8 In Brahmananda, the conduct noticed was that PW6 who claimed
to be an eye witness did not disclose the name of assailant till morning of June 15, 1969 though the
incident had taken place on June 13, 1969. The explanation given was PW6 was afraid of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132349268/ 13
Babu S/O Mutteppa Akale vs The State Of Karnataka on 19 December, 2023
assailant. This explanation was disbelieved because the assailant was not a gangster or a confirmed
criminal to be afraid of him and more than that the police arrived at the scene very soon, and the
ASI, who came to the village on June 14 in connection with the case, was the nephew of PW6.
22. In Amar Singh also, the facts are that the prosecution projected PW1 and PW11 as eye witnesses.
(1976) 4 SCC 288 (2020) 19 SCC 165
- 34 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB PW1 gave an explanation that all the three accused threatened to kill
him and PW11 when they attempted to rescue the deceased. But PW11, who was treated hostile,
never stated about the efforts made by them to save the deceased. The evidence of PW11 was that he
could not run because of an injury to his spine. He also denied in the cross examination that he had
given statement before the police about identification of the culprits and their overt acts. PW1 and
PW11 were the brothers of the deceased. After the incident also, PW1 and PW11 did not take the
injured to a doctor whose clinic was just near by the place of incident. This was the unnatural
conduct noticed to doubt the presence of PW1 and PW11.
23. But in the case on hand, there is no scope for disbelieving PW2, PW10, PW11, PW12 and PW22
to be eye witnesses. The reasons are many. PW11 is the mother and others are the cousins of
Basavaraj. PW11 was inside the house when Basavaraj was asked by the accused to come out of the
house. The houses of other witnesses are
- 35 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB situate near by. All of them have stated that they heard the shouting
voices of the accused which made them come near the house of Basavaraj. They all followed the
accused when they were dragging Basavaraj. It is not the case of prosecution that the witnesses were
not in their respective houses, the suggestion given to PW13 is that the accused did not drag
Basavaraj, which she denied. One answer elicited from PW12 in the cross examination shows that
four houses were there in the neighbourhood and about 10 to 15 people were living in those houses.
(C°è 4 ªÀÄ£ÉUÀ¼ÀÄ EªÉ, CªÀÅUÀ¼À°è 10 jAzÀ 15 d£À ªÁ¸À EgÀÄvÉÛÃªÉ C£ÀÄßªÀÅzÀÄ ¤d).
This being the situation, the presence of the eye witnesses cannot be doubted not only at the time
when the accused first went near the house of Basavaraj but also at the tree where the actual
incident of killing took place.
24. Three unnatural circumstances pointed out are that the witnesses did not make any attempt to
rescue the deceased, that they did not untie the deceased and see whether they were alive or not, and
that they did not call
- 36 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB the police. The evidence actually shows that an attempt was made by
all the witnesses to question the accused and their rushing for the rescue of the deceased. PW2 has
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132349268/ 14
Babu S/O Mutteppa Akale vs The State Of Karnataka on 19 December, 2023
stated that the accused threatened them by brandishing the weapons they had with them. Although
it may be stated that the witnesses could have been more sentient than what the evidence discloses
how they conducted themselves for rescuing the deceased, one thing should not be forgotten. It is
quite natural that one does not run the risk to one's life, and thus seen, the attempt made by the
people who were present there could not be expected to extend beyond the risk to their lives. The
evidence discloses that PW2 suffered an injury to his left hand when he went forward to stop the
accused. The other witnesses have also spoken about injury sustained by PW2 at that time. PW14
was the doctor who examined PW2 at 9 a.m on 23.10.2013 and noticed the presence of an abrasion
type wound measuring 3x0.1cm on the left fore arm. Ex.P15 is the wound certificate and the opinion
of PW14 is that the injury that he noticed was possible to occur due to
- 37 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB assault by blunt and hard object. The weapons produced are not hard
and blunt objects. It is for this reason Sri. Yug Mohith Chaudhry argued that the weapon said to
have been used for infliction of injury should have been shown to the doctor to obtain his opinion.
In the absence of opinion of the doctor, prosecution case cannot be said to have been established. He
has placed reliance on the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Amar Singh Vs. State of
Punjab 9.
25. The public prosecutor could have drawn the attention of PW14 to any of the weapons produced
and marked during trial for his opinion. This was again a folly of the public prosecutor; but by that
itself no inference can be drawn to state that the injury PW2 sustained was not on account of
infliction caused by one of the accused persons. Though PW14 has stated that hard or blunt object
would cause such an injury, it can also be stated that, if the tip of the weapon comes in contact with
skin 1987 1 SCC 679
- 38 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB without much force or intensity in the assault, there is likelihood that
injury like abrasion occurs. PW14 could have been cross examined if the defence was so sure that
PW2 was not present at the time of incident and he sustained an injury elsewhere. No such attempt
was made. In fact what PW2 has stated is that he sustained injury on his left fore arm while escaping
the blow which situation would clearly establish occurrence of abrasion on the forearm.
26. In Amar Singh and Others vs State of Punjab medical evidence was found to be inconsistent with
versions of eyewitnesses about the injuries sustained by the deceased. PW5-Smt. Veero, the mother
was the eyewitness. In the court, she gave a full account of how her son was assaulted by the
accused. She stated that after her son fell down, all the accused assaulted with weapons that each of
them was holding. She stated specifically that many blows fell on the ribs and abdomen of the
deceased, but the medical report did not indicate
- 39 -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132349268/ 15
Babu S/O Mutteppa Akale vs The State Of Karnataka on 19 December, 2023
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB any injury on the ribs and abdomen. Another eyewitness i.e., PW6
admitted in the cross-examination that he did not see the deceased Piara Singh receiving any injury
at the hands of accused. But in this case, PW2 stated about injury sustained by him while making an
attempt to protect the deceased. The doctor might have given a different opinion about the type of
weapon, but the presence of PW2 at the time of incident cannot be doubted in the wake of minor
inconsistency that Sri Yug Mohith Chaudhry pointed out.
27. About the deceased being not untied from the tree and Basavaraj not taken to hospital, the
witnesses have stated that the deceased met death due to assault with weapons by the accused. It is a
common place that nobody would go forward to touch the dead body especially when the incident
would be going to be a police case. There is nothing unusual in it. An inference is possible to be
drawn this way.
- 40 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB
28. About not calling police immediately is already discussed, there is no need to delve on it again.
So what we find is there was nothing unnatural in the conduct of eye witnesses. In a criminal case, a
conduct which appears to be unnatural in one case may appear to be natural in the other case,
evidence cannot be appreciated applying Eclyiod formula. Attending circumstances play a vital role.
29. About the argument regarding parroting versions of the eye witnesses, what we find is cogency
and consistency in their evidence. They have not given orchestrated evidence; there are natural
deviations, but there is no distraction while narrating the incident. Consistency in evidence cannot
be termed as parroting. In the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Rambilas and
Others Vs. State of MP10, the witnesses admitted in the cross examination that they did not see the
actual assault as they were prevented from going to (1997) SCC (Criminal) 1222
- 41 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB the place of occurrence by the appellants, but in the examination in
chief, they narrated the entire incident, and even the omissions, contradictions and improvements
were found to be identical. Therefore the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the testimonies of those
witnesses to be like parrot telling and unbelievable. Such kind of evidence is not found in this case.
30. Dharam Singh and Others Vs State of Punjab11 is cited in the context that the verbatim accounts
given by eyewitnesses is not safe to be relied upon. In this case, the facts show that there was enmity
between the deceased, namely Kaka Singh and the accused. There was also enmity between PW22
and the family of the accused because of civil disputes. In the incident that occurred on December 2,
1978 Kaka Singh was killed. PWs 18, 19 and 20 were projected as eyewitnesses. Considering the
nature of evidence given by the witnesses, it was found that their testimonies were 1993 Supp (3)
SCC 532
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132349268/ 16
Babu S/O Mutteppa Akale vs The State Of Karnataka on 19 December, 2023
- 42 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB unbelievable. What mattered most was a fracture sustained by the
deceased to his left leg. The doctor who treated the deceased and the doctor who conducted post
mortem examination did not indicate in their respective reports as to how the fracture occurred and
all that they indicated was that injuries 1 to 4 were caused by sharp edged weapons. Very strangely
in the FIR it was mentioned that the leg of the deceased was twisted in such a way as to cause
fracture. In this circumstance it was noticed that if the doctors did not speak about possibility of
occurrence of fracture, there was a mention of it in the FIR. It was noticed that the FIR was the
outcome of due deliberation. Therefore the Hon'ble Supreme Court set aside the judgment of the
High Court which had reversed the acquittal judgment of the trial court. In the case on hand the
circumstances similar to the circumstances in Dharam Singh are not forthcoming. Moreover what
the Supreme Court has held in this case is when there is enmity between the accused and the
witnesses, evidence has to be scrutinized with great care
- 43 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB and caution. It is not the principle that if enmity exists, the witnesses
always give false evidence; there may be tendency to give false evidence in order to falsely inculpate
the persons whom they hate and therefore the evidence requires scrutiny with great care and
caution. In the case on hand, it is not found that the witnesses have given false evidence.
31. Mohd. Hanif and Others Vs. State of Maharashtra12 is the judgment of the High Court of
Bombay in which the oral evidence of the witnesses was found to be not believable because of many
reasons. The High Court doubted that they were eye witnesses, especially in the background of all of
them giving puppet like version about having seen the incident standing at different places.
32. Sri. Yug Mohith Chaudhry has placed reliance on a judgment of the Supreme Court in Golbar
Hussain and (2017) SCC Online BOM 412
- 44 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB Others Vs. State of Assam and Another13, to garner support for his
argument that when independent eye witnesses turn hostile, the evidence of other eye witnesses
who have supported cannot be believed without corroboration. The observations found in paras 10
and 11 are :
"10. The second issue for consideration is the testimonies of PWs4 and 5 in absence
of any corroboration from any independent witness. PWs4 and 5 are related
witnesses as they are the brothers of the deceased Hasen Ali. There is no bar on the
admissibility of a statement by related witnesses supporting the prosecution case, but
it should stand the test of being credible, reliable, trustworthy, admissible in
accordance with law and corroborated by other witnesses or documentary evidence of
the prosecution. This Court has held in Manga alias Man Singh v. State of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132349268/ 17
Babu S/O Mutteppa Akale vs The State Of Karnataka on 19 December, 2023
Uttarakhand, (2013) 7 SCC 629, that it is the quality of the witness that matters and
not the quantity, when the related witness was examined and found (2015) 11 SCC
242
- 45 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB credible. In such a case non- examination of an independent witness
would not be fatal to the prosecution case.
11. In the present case, however, the prosecution witnesses PWs4 and 5, contradict each other, and
their statements are not corroborated by any independent witness in spite of the incident happening
in the market place, with shops on both sides of the road. Therefore, in our view, as the testimonies
of PWs4 and 5 are not completely reliable, this is a fit case where corroboration by an independent
witness was required. The case of the prosecution also weakens on the ground that the only
independent witness PW-8 turned hostile. A similar situation arose in Shyamal Saha and Anr. v.
State of West Bengal, (2014) 12 SCC 321, where the only independent witness turned hostile. This
Court decided to affirm the acquittal and granted benefit of doubt to the accused considering the
factual background and circumstances involved in the case."
- 46 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB
33. In the above referred case, the Hon'ble Supreme Court, having noticed material contradictions
in the testimonies of PW4 and PW5, opined that corroboration was required. Same is not the
situation in the case on hand. It is true that PW17, PW18 and PW19, the independent eye witnesses
did not support. Either they wanted to be neutral or they might be interested in accused for
deposing against prosecution. The way they have answered in examination in chief itself is sufficient
to draw an inference that their evidence is far from truth. They all belong to village Mamadapur
where the incident occurred. PW17 has stated that he knew the accused and both the deceased. But
he has stated he does not know how they died. The evidence of PW18 is that he does not know the
accused and also the deceased, and does not know how they died. PW19 has stated that he knows
the accused, but had not seen the deceased and does not know anything about death. Mamadapur is
a village, not a big town. PW22 has stated that about 300 persons witnessed the incident. When two
persons were killed in
- 47 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB their village, if PW17, PW18 and PW19 state that they do not know
anything about incident, it is hard to believe truth in their version. Therefore looked from any angle,
PW2, PW10, PW12 and PW22 do not appear to be untrustworthy witnesses, there was no
unnaturality in their conduct. Their evidence, being free of interestedness, is fully reliable.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132349268/ 18
Babu S/O Mutteppa Akale vs The State Of Karnataka on 19 December, 2023
34. Then in regard to argument that accused no.2 was not present in the village at the time of
incident, accused no.2 stated like that when he was examined under section 313 Cr.P.C. What PW22
has answered is that accused no.2 was living in the parental home of his wife. The witnesses saw the
participation of accused no.2. As their evidence is believable, if accused no.2 stated at a later a stage
that he was not in the village, it cannot be believed. Even if accused no.2 was living in his wife's
house at another village, it does not mean that he was not present at the time of incident. He might
have come to Mamadapur, this inference is possible to be drawn. If it
- 48 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB was his specific defence, the burden was on him to prove it. It is
enough if defence is found to be probable, but mere making a statement under section 313 Cr.P.C.
does not stand to the test of probability. Any explanation that accused gives when questioned under
section 313 Cr.P.C must appear to be reflection of questions about specific defence put to
prosecution witnesses during cross examination; an accused may lead evidence from his side if
necessary. If a specific defence is introduced for the first time during section 313 Cr.P.C., stage, it is
of no use. Therefore explanation of accused no.2 cannot be believed.
35. As the evidence discloses, and as Sri. Yug Mohith Chaudhry also argued, accused no.1
surrendered before police on 23.10.2013 and handed over the weapon. When the police produced
him before the Magistrate, they did not seek him to police custody, rather submitted an application
for committing him to judicial custody. We do not find any infirmity or abnormality in committing
accused no.1 to judicial custody. The evidence of PW25, the
- 49 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB investigating officer shows that he went to spot on 23.10.2013,
conducted spot panchanama, seized certain material objects, recorded the statements of witnesses
and then returned to police station. After his return to police station accused no.1 surrendered
before him and handed over one koita(sickle) and his blood stained clothes, a mobile phone and a
memory card. The moment he surrendered before the police officer, it means he was under police
custody. But by that time PW25 had already completed other part of investigation including
recording the statements of eye witnesses. When accused no.1 handed over the koita and other
items, PW25 seized them. For these reasons PW25 might have thought it unnecessary to apply for
police custody of accused no.1, whose presence probably was not required for further investigation.
In this context it may be stated that it is not always necessary that police custody must be sought,
the investigating officer may decide in his wise discretion to apply for police custody or not.
- 50 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB
36. It is true that till 29.10.2013, as becomes evident from the evidence of PW22, PW25 did not
order for arrest of accused 2 to 4. PW25 has not stated anything about it. This appears to be a lapse
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132349268/ 19
Babu S/O Mutteppa Akale vs The State Of Karnataka on 19 December, 2023
in investigation, but not so serious a lapse as to vitiate the investigation. Conversely the evidence of
PW25 discloses that by the time accused nos.2 to 4 were arrested, major part of investigation was
over, what remained was to obtain some reports, for which reason police custody of accused nos.2 to
4 was not necessary.
37. It has been argued by Sri. Yug Mohith Chaudhry that the prosecution produced only two
weapons marked MO8 and MO15. The witnesses speak that three weapons were used. PW2 has
stated that two koitas were seized in his presence. He has identified one iron koita at MO8 and
another iron elige patti (F½UÉ ¥ÀnÖ ) at MO13. From the evidence of PW25, it becomes clear that
accused no.1 produced one weapon which PW25 has identified as MO15. It was PW2 who first
identified MO15. It is to be stated
- 51 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB that Elige Patti is also a weapon. If witnesses stated that there were
three koitas, probably they might have referred to Elige Patti to koita. The discrepancy in this regard
is not prominent. Totally three weapons were produced during trial. Therefore for all the above
reasons, we find it difficult to accept the argument of Sri. Yug Mohith Chaudhry, and therefore hold
that the evidence of PW2, PW10, PW12 and PW22 is trustworthy and the trial court has not erred in
acting upon their testimonies. Point No. (iii)
38. Certainly if a husband finds his wife to be having illicit relationship transgressing the
matrimonial discipline, it evokes anger in him, and how a husband reacts to a situation like this
depends on his personality. Different persons react differently. This is connected with human
behaviour influenced by sociological background. In the case of K.M. Nanavati Vs. State of
Maharashtra 14, cited by Sri Vishwanath Bichagatti and Sri Yug Mohith AIR 1962 SC 605
- 52 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB Chaudhry, the following is the observation :
"84. Is there any standard of a reasonable man for the application of the doctrine of
"grave and sudden" provocation ? No abstract standard of reasonableness can be laid
down. What a reasonable man will do in certain circumstances depends upon the
customs, manners, way of life, traditional values etc.; in short, the cultural, social and
emotional background of the society to which an accused belongs. In our vast country
there are social groups ranging from the lowest to the highest state of civilization. It is
neither possible nor desirable to lay down any standard with precision : it is for the
court to decide in each case, having regard to the relevant circumstances. It is not
necessary in this case to ascertain whether a reasonable man placed in the position of
the accused would have lost his self- control momentarily or even temporarily when
his wife confessed to him of her illicit intimacy with another, for we are satisfied on
the evidence that the accused regained his self-control and killed Ahuja deliberately."

39. In Dauvaram Nirmalkar, the Hon'ble Supreme Court reiterated the same position by placing
reliance on Nanavati. The facts in the case discloses that the accused-appellant killed his own
brother Dashrath Nirmalkar who was not only addicted to alcohol but also ill tempered. On the
night of occurrence, Dashrath Nirmalkar consumed alcohol and asked the appellant to leave the
house, else he would kill him. This made the appellant lose his self control on account of a 'slow
burn' reaction followed by the final and immediate provocation. In these circumstances, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court found that Exception 1 to section 300 of IPC could be applied to convict the
appellant under part I of section 304 of IPC.
40. Three other decisions relied upon by Sri Yug Mohith Chaudhry depict the facts which do not
constitute an offence punishable under section 302 of IPC. Saroj @ Suraj Panchal and Another vs
State of West Bengal15 discloses the facts that the daughter of accused no.1 (2014) 4 SCC 802

NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB namely Kumari Bandana Panchal and the deceased namely Sukumar
Ray were in love with each other to the disliking of the family of accused no.1. On 10.07.1990 around
8.00 p.m all the accused severely beat the deceased seeing his presence in their house. The
appearance of the deceased during night hours in their house caused very much annoyance to them
and being unable to tolerate the presence of the deceased was held by the Supreme Court to be the
reason for the accused getting provocated suddenly and therefore it was held that Exception 1 to
section 300 could be applied.
41. In Sudhir Prakashnarayan Shrivastav vs State of Maharashtra16, the facts indicate that the
deceased namely Pramod was a vendor of tender coconuts and the accused was a cycle tyre repairer.
Both were addicted to liquor. On the date of incident the deceased demanded money from the
accused to buy liquor, but the latter refused. Thereafter the deceased went to the shop of
- 55 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB the accused and urinated in the water being used by the accused for
repairing the cycle tyres and then abused him. Offended by this conduct of the deceased, the accused
took the scythe from the cart of the deceased and gave blows to him on the neck, shoulder, face,
abdomen etc., in all causing 13 injuries. In these circumstances the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that
passing of urine in the water caused sudden provocation to the accused and he lost his temper
beyond his control which was reflected from multiple injuries that he implicated. In this
background, First Exception to section 300 IPC was made applicable.
42. Gurubasavaiah and Another vs. State of Karnataka17 is a judgment of the Division Bench of this
court where the facts show that the deceased gained entry stealthily into the house of the accused.

Emperor18 is the judgment of Calcutta High Court where punishment of life imprisonment for the
offence under section 302 IPC was reduced to rigorous imprisonment for ten years by applying
Exception 1 to section 300 of IPC. Therein the facts were that the deceased namely Hur Singh had
developed intimacy with Lakya, the wife of Abaludas. On the night of 21.05.1900, Hur Singh went to
the house of Lakya on her invitation. At that time, Abaludas and other accused seized Hur Singh,
carried him to a distant place and broke his arms and one leg. They left him in open. Hur Singh died

NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB hospital. Assessing this situation it was held:
"Learned counsel for the Crown has suggested that the accused laid an ambush for the deceased,
and that the woman was made use of to decoy him into the house. We feel very doubtful, however,
whether the woman could have been a party to such a design. It may be that the accused were
watching the woman and lying in wait for the deceased, whom they know to be the lover of Lakya;
and that may account for their springing on him, as they did. But however this may be, in our
opinion the provocation afforded by the deceased did amount to grave and sudden provocation
within the meaning of exception (1) to s.300 of the Penal Code, 1860. The learned Judge does not
accept this plea, because the accused took the deceased to some little distance, before they murdered
him. But we think that the provocation was of a nature that would continue to influence the feeling
of the accused for a considerable period after the deceased was caught in the bari in the company of
Lakya; and for these reasons we are inclined to take a merciful view of the case and to alter the
conviction from one under

NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB s.302 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 to one under s. 304 of the Indian

Das and Sakalu Das to rigorous imprisonment for ten years in each case, while we reduce the
sentence passed upon Abalu Das to one of rigorous imprisonment for seven years."

44. Emperor Vs. Balku19 is the judgment of the Allahabad High Court. Here the facts were that
Budhu, the person killed and the accused were sleeping on the same charpai in the varanda of the
house of the accused. In the midnight Budhu got up and went into the room where the wife of the
accused was sleeping. After bolting the door behind him Budhu started having intercourse with the
wife of the accused. Accused got up and peeped through a chink of the door and saw Budhu and his
wife having sexual intercourse. The accused returned and slept on the charpai. After sometime,
Budhu came out of the room and lay down on the same charpai by the side of accused.
1938 SCC Online Allahabad 364
- 59 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB When Budhu started dozing accused got up and stabbed Budhu several
times and killed him. The question that arose was whether Exception 1 to Section 300 of IPC could
be applied. The answer was:
"A point that gave us some doubt is whether the fact that the accused, after having
seen the adultery being committed, waited until Budhu had come out and had lain
down and begun to doze on the charpai, before he made an attack on him, would
have an effect on this case. The question before us is whether the case comes within
exception 1 to section 300 of the Penal Code, 1860 which states as follows:- "Culpable
homicide is not murder if the offender, whilst deprived of the power of self control by
grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the
provocation." Now for this exception the accused must be deprived of the power of
self control by provocation which is not only grave but also sudden. No doubt the
accused had to wait some interval before Budhu came out, before he could do
anything at all, and after Budhu came out the accused who was lying on the charpai
naturally waited a
- 60 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB short time before he made a move. He might have
sprung up at once and attacked Budhu. But in practice persons of this class are
somewhat slow movers. When Budhu came into intimate contact with the accused by
lying beside him on the charpai this must have worked further on the mind of the
accused and he must have reflected that "this man now lying beside me had been
dishonouring me a few minutes ago." Under these circumstances we think that the
provocation would be both grave and sudden. We have been referred to Abalu Das v.
King Emperor, where there was a case in which it was held that when certain accused
persons had the provocation of seeing adultery being committed by the deceased with
the wife of one of them, the provocation would be considered to be grave and sudden
after an interval during which the deceased man was taken to a certain distance
before being assaulted. We think that in the present case the exception No.1 will
apply, and accordingly we reduce the conviction from one under section 302 of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132349268/ 23
Babu S/O Mutteppa Akale vs The State Of Karnataka on 19 December, 2023
Penal Code, 1860 to one under section 304 of the Penal Code, 1860. We sentence the
accused to five years' rigorous
- 61 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB imprisonment and we acquit him of the offence under
section 302 of the Penal Code, 1860 and we allow the appeal to this extent."
(emphasis supplied)
45. Next judgment is Boya Munigadu Vs. Queen20. In this case the accused found that the deceased
was having connection with his wife and was moved intensely by what he saw. At that moment he
did not react, but on the next day morning he saw his wife eating with the deceased without serving
food to him. As he was a witness to what had occurred on the previous evening, that provoked him
to kill the deceased, namely, Narasimhudu. When this circumstance was brought to fore, the Madras
High Court held as below:
"In the morning he saw his wife eating with the deceased and giving him food while
she left her husband without it. If he had not been a witness to what had occurred on
the previous evening, this conduct would have a special significance, indicative of
improper relations between the deceased and the wife;
1881 SCC Online Madras 1
- 62 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB and, if having witnessed the act of adultery, he
connected this subsequent conduct, as he could not fail to connect it, with that act, it
would be conduct of a character highly exasperating to him, implying, as it must, that
all concealment of their criminal relations and all regard for his feelings were
abandoned and that they purposed continuing their course of misconduct in his
house. This, we think, amounted to provocation, grave enough and sudden enough to
deprive him of his self -control, and reduced the offence from murder to culpable
homicide not amounting to murder."
46. The judgment of the High Court of Madras (Madurai Bench) in Poovamal Vs. State21, also deals
with applicability of Exception 1 to section 300 in the background of circumstances that the mother
herself killed her son when the latter disagreed to live with her. The accused became helpless after
the death of her husband. She requested her son, i.e., the deceased, to live with her and all her
requests to convince him went in vain. This 2012 SCC Online Madras 489

Babu S/O Mutteppa Akale vs The State Of Karnataka on 19 December, 2023
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB resulted in her axing the son to death. The findings of the Madras High
Court are found in paragraph no. 43 which is extracted below.
"43. There was no premeditation. She suddenly picked up the axe. The situation was
not created by her. It was created by her son. Her immediate post conduct was her
attempt to kill herself. What she did was killing of her son. In the facts and
circumstances, it is an intentional act, why and under what circumstances she did it,
we have already seen. So Poovammal's case will not fall under Section 300, I.P.C.
read with Section 302, I.P.C. but will fall under Exception I to Section 300, I.P.C. so
she become punishable under Section 304, I.P.C., Part I."
47. In order to assess the argument of both the counsel, we now refer to Exception 1 to section 300
of IPC which reads as below:
"300. Murder ....
Exception 1.-When culpable homicide is not murder.-Culpable homicide is not
murder if
- 64 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB the offender, whilst deprived of the power of
self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who
gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident.
The above exception is subject to the following provisos:-
First.-That the provocation is not sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as
an excuse for killing or doing harm to any person.
Secondly.-That the provocation is not given by anything done in obedience to the law,
or by a public servant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant.
Thirdly.-That the provocation is not given by anything done in the lawful exercise of
the right of private defence.
Explanation Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the
offence from amounting to murder is a question of fact."

NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132349268/ 25
Babu S/O Mutteppa Akale vs The State Of Karnataka on 19 December, 2023
48. The language of the provision of law is very clear that the provocation must be grave and
sudden, and it must result in depravation of the power of self control of the offender and in that
state of mind he must have caused the death of a person. If these ingredients are forthcoming in the
evidence brought on record, the offender can be said to have committed culpable homicide not
amounting to murder which is punishable according to section 304 of IPC. Explanation part makes
it further clear that based on facts, the court has to decide whether provocation was grave and
sudden. It means the evidence brought on record must disclose that the circumstances were as such
that the accused had in all probability lost control over himself because of sudden provocation,
however assessment of evidence to this effect must be made in the light of three provisos to
Exception-I.
49. The provocation may be short lived; the accused may endure the provocation for a considerable
time, however it should not be too long. Endured or
- 66 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB sustained provocation requires elucidation that the provocation
emanated from the victim must have tormented the accused; it should be persisting in him and any
further act at the instance of victim must appear to be sufficient to evoke the feelings of the
tormenter or sufferer to lose control over himself and do an act resulting in death of the victim
(provoker). The ultimate act of causing death must also appear to be the outburst of sustained
provocation and it must be free from preparation and premeditation. The whole circumstance must
not disclose malice which engenders intention to kill.
50. In the case of K.M. Nanavati, it is held as below:
"139. The question that the Court has to consider is whether a reasonable person
placed in the same position as the accused was, would have reacted to the confession
of adultery by his wife in the manner in which the accused did. In Mancini v. Director
of Public Prosecutions L.R. (1942) A.C. 1, Viscount Simon, L.C., states the scope of
the
- 67 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB doctrine of provocation thus:
It is not at all provocation that will reduce the crime of murder to manslaughter.
Provocation, to have that result, must be such as temporarily deprives the person
provoked of the power of self control, as the result of which he commits the unlawful
act which causes death. ... The test to be applied is that of the effect of the
provocation on a reasonable man, as was laid down by the Court of Criminal Appeal
in Rex v. Lesbini (1914) 3 K.B. 1116, so that an unusually excitable or pugnacious
individual is not entitled to rely on provocation which would not have led an ordinary
person to act as he did. In applying the test, it is of particular importance to (a)
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132349268/ 26
Babu S/O Mutteppa Akale vs The State Of Karnataka on 19 December, 2023
consider whether a sufficient interval has elapsed since the provocation to allow a
reasonable man time to cool, and (b) to take into account the instrument with which
the homicide was effected, for to retort, in the heat of passion induced by
provocation, by a simple blow, is a very different thing from making use of a
- 68 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB deadly instrument like a concealed dagger. In short, the
mode of resentment must bear a reasonable relationship to the provocation if the
offence is to be reduced to manslaughter."
(emphasis supplied)
51. The present case has to be examined in the light of above principles. We state that none of the
rulings cited by Sri Vishwanath Bichagatti and Sri Yug Mohith Chaudhry helps the accused for, the
facts in them show that the acts were done in the state of provocation which did not last long;
moreover no case discloses any kind of preparation made by the accused. The finding in Abalu Das
is that visit of the deceased to the house of the accused to meet the wife of the latter ignited
provocation in him. The case of Balku also demonstrates eruption of provocation in him when he
peeped through the chink of the door and saw his wife and the deceased having sexual intercourse.
The time interval between his seeing the intercourse and till the deceased came out of the room to
- 69 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB sleep beside him was not too long. Boya Munigadu indicates the hurt
feelings of the accused being inflamed when he was ignored by his wife without serving food to him
on the next day morning. Here also the provocation was for a shorter duration of not more than a
day. In the case of Poovamal what figures out is that actually she lost control over herself when her
last request was turned down by her son, it was a momentary reaction and not a premeditated one.
52. In the decisions cited by Sri Yug Mohith Chaudhry, which are referred to already the facts
disclose altogether a different situation to take a view that the crimes referred there might have been
taken place in a circumstance falling under Exception 1 to section 300. To repeat, in Dauvaram
Nirmalkar, the accused got enraged when the deceased, an alcoholic and quarrelsome by nature,
asked him to leave the house or else he would be killed. No doubt, the accused had tolerated the
deceased, but the last incident of quarrel might have
- 70 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB triggered his feelings, and the fact of his losing self control became
evident when he tried to kill himself by holding live electric wire. Saroj @ Suraj Panchal is not a case
of sustained provocation; the appearance of deceased in the house of accused for the purpose of
meeting his girlfriend suddenly aroused provocation in them as they disliked the love affair between
the daughter of accused no.1 and the deceased. Sudhir Prakashnarayan Srivastav is also a case of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132349268/ 27
Babu S/O Mutteppa Akale vs The State Of Karnataka on 19 December, 2023
sudden provocation. Urination in the water being used by the accused for his tyre repair work was
the main reason. Multiple injuries inflicted by accused demonstrated loss of self control in such a
situation.
53. In the present case, we do not find such kind of a situation as appears in the above referred
rulings, rather what is disclosed is a well planned action. From the suggestions given to the
eyewitnesses in the cross examination, a clear inference can be drawn that illicit relationship
between the two deceased was known to the accused and many people in the village. Suggestion
given
- 71 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB to PW2 in the cross examination is that Sangeeta was going to the
house of Basavaraj and that the latter's mother had given Sangeeta leniency and in fact, Basavaraj's
mother had brought Sangeeta to her house. PW10 was suggested that Sangeeta was living in the
house of Basavaraj and that the father of Basavaraj caught them red handed when both of them were
found together amid standing jawar crop. PW-11, the mother of Basavaraj is given a suggestion in
such a way as she was supporting the illicit relationship between her son and Sangeeta and therefore
for that reason there used to take place quarrels between her and her husband. Suggestion given to
PW-12 in the cross examination is that Sangeeta was present in the house of Basavaraj on the date of
incident. PW-22 is suggested that both the deceased used to meet in the jowar fields for quite a long
time. Another answer was elicited from him that Basavaraj used to be found with Sangeeta and that
PW-22 and his family members had advised him that he should not take leniency with Sangeeta as
she was the wife of another. Therefore from
- 72 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB all these suggestions a clear inference can be drawn that the
relationship between both the deceased was not anew. Matter would have been totally different if
the relationship between them had developed one or two days before the incident took place, if that
were to be the case, an inference could have been drawn about sustaining the provocation when
accused no.1 came to know of his wife having developed relationship with Basavaraj. The
circumstances are as such that accused no.1 was aware of the relationship; he had sufficient time to
ponder over the same; he did not retort within a short duration of time. But what the evidence
discloses is a premeditated planned action. Accused 1 to 4 joined together; first they all went near
the house of Basavaraj, called him out of his house and then tied him to a tree. Then Sangeeta was
brought from her house i.e, from the house of accused no.1. She was also tied to the same tree.
Accused no.1 brought sickles from his house. All these do not indicate a decision taken in a haste
under the state of provocation.

Babu S/O Mutteppa Akale vs The State Of Karnataka on 19 December, 2023
54. It is true that second accused asked the eye witnesses to listen to a conversation between the two
deceased which was recorded in a mobile phone. Vishwanath Bichagatti's argument was that if the
trial court had heard the conversation it would have been possible for the trial court to take a proper
decision. In fact, the judgment of the trial court shows that the public prosecutor made an effort to
play the mobile phone, but the trial court found that no other supporting material or record was
available to accept that the voices recorded in M.O. 29 were that of both the deceased. This
conclusion is incorrect because even according to defence M.O. 29 contained the conversation
between both the deceased. There was no dispute about it and the trial court could have heard the
conversation to draw inferences. Anyway while hearing the arguments, we heard the conversation
by inserting M.O. 29 to the computer system in the presence of learned counsel for the accused Sri
Vishwanath Bichagatti and we found that there was a kind of intimate conversation between the
two. But now the
- 74 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB question is whether this conversation triggered the provocation. The
onus was on the accused to establish that because of this conversation the accused, especially the
first accused lost control over himself and this led to the incident of killing the two. It appears that
the accused might have recorded the conversation without the knowledge of both the deceased.
Recording also indicates that the accused wanted to justify their action if anybody would question
them, and it can also be said it was a part of their preparation. Looked in this view, it is not possible
to hold that the accused had endured the provocation in them. The matter would have been
altogether different if only accused no.1 was involved in the incident, but there were four. If there
were to be provocation, accused no.1 being the husband of Sangeeta must have carried it, and it is
inappropriate to say that the conduct of his wife did not hurt his feelings; he was hurt and there is no
doubt in it. But being hurt, what he did thereafter assumes importance. The matter would have been
different had he alone caused the death of his wife and her paramour. But
- 75 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB accused 2 to 4 would join him. It is the specific plea of accused no.2
that he was not present at the scene of occurrence as he was residing in another village. He has
stated so when he was questioned under section 313 of Cr.P.C. This is just a statement without any
probability in his stand, for eye witnesses have testified the participation of accused no.2 in
commission of offence. If it is assumed for arguments sake, that he was residing in another village, if
his presence and participation is proved by the eye witnesses, the obvious inference is that he might
have been asked by accused no.1 to come over to Mamadapur. Moreover involvement of accused
nos. 3 and 4, who are cousins of accused nos. 1 and 2 assumes significance. Sri Yug Mohith
Chaudhry argued that all the four accused belonged to same family, and the affair between the
deceased was a dishonour to the reputation of the family, and this is how the situation must be
gauged. This is only a plausible argument, but not acceptable because the whole situation depicts a
premeditated action. So we do not find any circumstance favourable to the accused in

NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB order to apply Exception-I to Section 300 IPC for punishing them
under Section 304 IPC.
Point No.(iv)
55. We have examined the case on hand in the background of the principles laid down by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Bachan Singh and Machhi Singh (supra). In the background of
the guidelines spelt out in Bachan Singh, the Hon'ble Supreme Court laid down the following
propositions while deciding Machhi Singh. The propositions are:
"38. .....
(i) the extreme penalty of death need not be inflicted except in gravest cases of
extreme culpability;
(ii) Before opting for the death penalty the circumstances of the 'offender' also
require to be taken into consideration along with the circumstances of the 'crime'.
(iii)Life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence is an exception. In other words
death sentence must be imposed only when life
- 77 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB imprisonment appears to be an altogether inadequate punishment
having regard to the relevant circumstances of the crime, and provided, and only provided the
option to impose sentence of imprisonment for life cannot be conscientiously exercised having
regard to the nature and circumstances of the crime and all the relevant circumstances.
(iv) A balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances has to be drawn up and in doing so
the mitigating circumstances has to be accorded full weightage and a just balance has to be struck
between the aggravating and the mitigating circumstances before the option is exercised."
56. Having laid down the above principles, the Supreme Court further directed the following
questions to be asked and answered.
"39. In order to apply these guidelines inter-alia the following questions may be
asked and answered:
(a) Is there something uncommon about the crime which renders sentence of
- 78 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB imprisonment for life inadequate and calls for a death sentence?
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/132349268/ 30
Babu S/O Mutteppa Akale vs The State Of Karnataka on 19 December, 2023
(b) Are the circumstances of the crime such that there is no alternative but to impose death sentence
even after according maximum weightage to the mitigating circumstances which speak in favour of
the offender ?"
57. Now the case on hand is to be examined in the background of the above principles. No doubt the
incident was very cruel. It was committed in the presence of many villagers by rendering the
deceased helpless. As they were tied to a tree, they could not make any attempt to protect
themselves. In spite of the fact that the incident shocks the conscience, it may be stated that the case
does not answer the test of 'rarest of rare case'. All the accused were in their prime youth when the
incident occurred, and in fact one of the accused was a juvenile who was tried separately. In the light
of the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Manoj (supra), we called for reports from the
Chief Superintendent, Hindalaga Jail, Belagavi,

Crime No. 173/2010 registered by Chikkodi Police Station for the offences under sections 323 and

and he also maintains discipline inside the jail. His present age is 31

NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB years. He is illiterate, but being an inmate of the jail, he underwent job
related training, i.e., Self employed tailor of apparel, made-ups and home furnishing. He too was
shown as accused in Crime no. 173/2010, but no charge sheet appears to have been filed.
60. Age of accused no.3 now is 30 years. The report about him is that his conduct is good and
satisfactory inside the jail and he too maintains jail discipline. Before admission to jail, he had
completed VIII standard and being an inmate of the jail he did not acquire any training. Except the
present one, he was not involved in any other case. Jail authority has enclosed certificates relating to
trainings undergone by accused nos. 1 and 2.

Babu S/O Mutteppa Akale vs The State Of Karnataka on 19 December, 2023
Probation Officer has stated that before the incident took place, the conduct and behaviour of
accused 1 and 2 was good and they had good

NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB relation with the other villagers; they were mixing freely with the
villagers and were also involving themselves in the social activities. Same is the report of the
Probation Officer about accused no.3.
62. The mental status examination report issued by Dr.Chandrashekar T.R, Department of
Psychiatry, Belagavi Institute of Medical Sciences, is not adverse to accused 1 to 3 and he has
indicated that they have tendency for reformation. It is also mentioned that according to the
information given to him by the staff of the jail, there is possibility of reformation.
63. All the three accused are still young. Accused 1 and 3 expressed remorse for their wrongness
when we too examined them in the court. Though accused no.2 stated that he had no remorse, we
think that in view of the reports, he is a person who can be reformed. If an opportunity is provided
to them to reform themselves, they can turn out to be better citizens. Therefore drawing balance
sheet between aggravating and mitigating
- 82 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB circumstances as has been observed by the Supreme Court in Machhi
Singh, we find that death penalty cannot be imposed on accused 1 to 3. It is enough if they are
sentenced to life imprisonment and fine. Point No.(iv) is thus answered.
Point No.(v)
64. We do not think that accused could be convicted for the offence under Section 307 IPC. What the
evidence discloses is that when PW2 went forward for the rescue of the deceased persons, the
accused threatened to kill them. No doubt this amounts to intimidation but it does not disclose the
intention of the accused to make an attempt on the life of PW2. The reaction of accused at that
moment was to alarm those who wanted to come to the rescue of the deceased. If in that course PW2
sustained injuries due to impact of sickle held by accused no.1, it would amount to an offence under
section 324 IPC. Therefore we are of the opinion that holding the accused guilty of the offence under
section 307 IPC is improper.
- 83 -
NC: 2023:KHC-D:14868-DB However conviction for offence under section 506 IPC has to be
maintained, in as much as the evidence discloses intimidation caused by the accused when the eye
witnesses attempted for rescue of the deceased.
65. In the result, we pass the following:
