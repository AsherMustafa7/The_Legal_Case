CORAM: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE
And
HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE ASHWANI KUMAR SINGH
CAV JUDGMENT
(Per: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE ASHWANI KUMAR SINGH) Date: 27-10-2016 These petitions
have been filed by different persons, who are accused in different cases, for grant of pre-arrest bail
in terms of Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short „Code(cid:129)). First
Information Reports were instituted against them at different police stations of the State of Bihar for
having allegedly committed offences punishable under various provisions of The Scheduled Castes
and The Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (for short „the Act(cid:129)) and the Indian
Penal Code, 1860 (for short „IPC(cid:129)). The applications of accused persons, in these cases filed under
Section 438 of the Code, have already been rejected by different Courts of Sessions of the different
Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016 districts of the State of Bihar.
2. In course of argument, in Cr. Misc. No. 25276 of 2016 (Bisheshwar Mishra and Anr. vs. State of
Bihar), two conflicting orders passed by a learned single Judge, in two different cases, came to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/33558496/ 7
Rama Shankar Singh & Ors vs The State Of Bihar on 27 October, 2016
notice of the learned single Judge.
3. In Cr. Misc. No. 24733 of 2016 (Dinesh Kumar and Ors. vs. The State of Bihar), the learned single
Judge, taking note of insertion of new Section 14-A in the Act, vide The Scheduled Castes and The
Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act, 2015 (for short „the Amendment Act,
2015(cid:129)) dismissed the application of the petitioner filed, under Section 438 of the Code, for grant of
pre-arrest bail holding the same to be not maintainable and granted liberty to the petitioner to file
an appropriate appeal in terms of Section 14-A of the Amendment Act, 2015.
4. In Cr. Misc. No.24836 of 2016 (Munna Shaw @ Munna Saw vs. The State of Bihar) and analogous
cases filed under Section 438 of the Code, after rejection of the pre-arrest bail application of the
accused persons from the Court of Sessions Judge, the learned Single held that there would be no
question of maintaining an appeal under the provisions of Section 14-A of the Amendment Act,
2015, against an order passed by the Court of Session granting or refusing pre-arrest bail under
Section 438 of Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016 the Code in a case arising out of any of
the offences under the Act. The learned single Judge further held that an application, under Section
438 of the Code, would not be ousted by virtue of the bar, under Section 18 of the Act, with respect
to a person, who is an accused in a case registered for offence(s) punishable under various
provisions of the Act if such a person is in a position to satisfy the court that even on the basis of
allegations made in the First Information Report or the Complaint petition, no case of commission
of offence, under the provisions of Section 3(1) of the Act, is made out against him.
5. In view of the conflicting views of the learned single Judge in Cr. Misc. No. 24733 of 2016 (supra)
and Cr. Misc. No.24836 of 2016 (supra), the learned single Judge, vide order, dated 09.08.2016,
passed in Cr. Misc. No. 25276 of 2016, referred the matter to be decided by a Division Bench, while
hearing an application under Section 438 of the Code, in respect of two accused persons against
whom Bhabhua P. S. Case No. 312 of 2016, was registered for certain offences of the IPC as also
under the provisions of the Act and directed the Registry to place the case before Hon(cid:129)ble the Chief
Justice for the needful.
6. The other 13 petitions have been referred to the Division Bench by different orders passed by
different learned single Judges inasmuch as it was pointed out, in the course of Patna High Court
Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016 argument, by the learned Advocates, appearing on behalf of the
petitioners, that the question, whether an appeal would lie before this Court after rejection of the
application filed under Section 438 of the Code for grant of pre-arrest bail by the Court of Sessions
Judge, has been referred to the Division Bench for consideration, vide order, dated 09.08.2016,
passed in Cr. Misc. No. 25276 of 2016.
7. Consequently, this Bench has been constituted to hear and decide the references made by the
learned single Judges.
8. On a careful scrutiny of these applications, we find that orders rejecting the applications for grant
of pre-arrest bail, in Cr. Misc. Nos. 25276 of 2016, 33782 of 2016, 33861 of 2016, 34707 of 2016,
34785 of 2016, 34760 of 2016, 37390 of 2016 and 37457 of 2016, have been passed either by the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/33558496/ 8
Rama Shankar Singh & Ors vs The State Of Bihar on 27 October, 2016
Special Court or by the Exclusive Special Court constituted under the Act; whereas in Cr. Misc. Nos.
31747 of 2016, 33811 of 2016, 33958 of 2016, 34026 of 2016, 34027 of 2016 and 34767 of 2016, the
orders, rejecting the prayer for pre-arrest bail, have been passed by the Session Courts, which have
neither been specified nor declared as Special Court or Exclusive Special Court to deal with any
matter arising out of the Act.
9. In the background of the facts stated above, Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016 though
the learned single Judges have framed no issue, while referring the matter to the Division Bench,
following questions would be required to be determined in these cases :-
(i) Whether a person, accused of committing an offence under the Act, is specifically
barred from the benefit of statutory provisions of pre-
arrest bail provided in Section 438 of the Code?
(ii) Whether a Court of Session or the High Court, while dealing with an application for grant of
pre-arrest bail, is allowed to scrutinize the relevant materials with a view to find out whether any
offence, under the Act, has been made out or not?
(iii) Whether an application, under Section 438 of the Code, for grant of pre-arrest bail can be
maintained with respect to a person, who is an accused in a case registered for the offence
punishable, under the various provisions of the Act, if such a person is in a position to satisfy the
court that even on the basis of allegations contained in the First Information Report or Complaint
petition, no ingredient of commission of any offence, under the provisions of the Act, Patna High
Court Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016 is made out against him ?
(iv) Whether an application, under Section 438 of the Code, in a criminal case instituted under the
provisions of the Act, can be entertained by a Court of Session not specified or declared either as
Special Court or Exclusive Special Court under the Act ?
(v) Whether consequent upon introduction of Section 14-A by way of the Amendment Act, 2015, in
the Act, an appeal would be maintainable against an order passed on an application filed in the
court below, under Section 438 of the Code, in a case instituted under the provisions of the Act ?
(vi) Whether an accused, apprehending his arrest in a case instituted under the provisions of the
Act, can directly file an application under Section 438 of the Code before the High Court ?
10. In order to find out the answers to the questions to be determined in these cases, it would be
necessary to set out Section 438 (1) of the Code and Section 18 of the Act.
11. Section 438 (1) of the Code provides, inter alia, that where any person has reason to believe that
he may be arrested Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016 on an accusation of having
committed a non-bailable offence, he may apply to the High Court or to a Court of Session for a
direction that in the event of such arrest, he shall be released on bail. Section 438 of the Code reads
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/33558496/ 9
Rama Shankar Singh & Ors vs The State Of Bihar on 27 October, 2016
as under :
"438. Direction for grant of bail to person apprehending arrest.
(1) When any person has reason to believe that he may be arrested on an accusation
of having committed a non-bailable offence, he may apply to the High Court or the
Court of Session for direction under this section; and that Court may, if it thinks fit,
direct that in the event of such arrest, he shall be released on bail."
12. However, Section 18 of the Act disentitles a person, accused of committing an offence under the
Act, from the benefit of pre-arrest bail.
13. Section 18 of the Code reads as under :
"18. Section 438 of the Code not to apply committing an offence under the Act.-
Nothing in section 438 of the Code shall apply in relation to any case involving the
arrest of any person on an accusation of having committed an offence under this Act."
(emphasis mine)
14. A plain reading of Section 18 of the Act would make it evident that it takes away the statutory
right conferred upon Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016 persons to be released on bail in
the event of their arrest, who are alleged to have committed an offence under the Act. To say it
differently, it would also mean from the perusal of text of Section 18 of the Act that a Court of
Session or the High Court, as the case may be, would have no power to direct release of an accused
on bail in the event of his arrest if he is facing accusation of having committed an offence under the
Act.
15. While considering these applications, it needs to be noted that the Constitutional validity of
Section 18 of the Act, denying the right to pre-arrest bail to an accused of committing offence against
the members of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, was challenged before the
Rajasthan High Court in Jai Singh and Anr. vs. Union of India and Ors. (AIR 1993 Rajasthan 177). It
was contended that the provisions prescribed, under Section 18 of the Act hits Article 21 of the
Constitution of India, which guarantees the procedure to be followed in a trial of a criminal case to
be fair, just and equal. However, the contention of the petitioner failed to convince the Bench of the
Rajasthan High Court. The Bench held that the enactment was within the legislative spirit of Article
17 of the Constitution of India. It not only abolishes untouchability, but also guarantees social justice
and dignity to the members of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, who were, for
centuries, deprived of social equality and forced to lead Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016
undignified life.
16. We may, now, refer to the decision in the matter of Dr. Ram Krishna Balothia vs. Union of India
and Ors. (AIR 1994 Madhya Pradesh 143), wherein the following contentions were raised by the
petitioners challenging the constitutional validity of the whole Act : (i) that the entire Act is based on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/33558496/ 10
Rama Shankar Singh & Ors vs The State Of Bihar on 27 October, 2016
caste discrimination and, therefore, infringes Article 15(1) of the Constitution of India and it is not
saved under Article 15(4) of the Constitution; (ii) that Section 3 of the Act provides for punishment
for offences of atrocities against persons belonging to the members of Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes by any person other than a member of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes,
which cannot be said to be a provision for advancement of the Scheduled Castes and Tribes; (iii) that
Section 8(a) of the Act is vague, unclear and preposterous inasmuch as it tries to create a premature
criminal liability in an ambiguous manner; and, (iv) that Section 18 of the Act is violative of Articles
14 and 21 of the Constitution of India.
17. After hearing the parties and having considered the decision of the Full-Bench of the Rajasthan
High Court, in the matter of Jai Singh and Anr. (supra), the Division-Bench of the Madhya Pradesh
High Court upheld the other provisions of the Act, as constitutionally valid, except Section 18 of the
Act. The Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016 Bench held that Section 18 of the Act does not
conform to the norms of justice and fair play and prescribed a procedure, which is impermissible
under the Constitution and is liable to be struck down. Accordingly, the Bench struck down Section
18 of the Act as violative of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India.
18. However, on an appeal, preferred by the State of M. P. against the decision of Madhya Pradesh
High Court, vide State of M. P. and Anr. vs. Ram Kishna Balothia and Anr. (AIR 1995 SC 1198), the
judgment of the Madhya Pradesh High Court was reversed by the Supreme Court. The Supreme
Court held that exclusion of Section 438 of the Code in connection with offences under the Act needs
to be reviewed in the backdrop of historical background relating to the practice of "Untouchability"
and the social attitudes, which lead to the commission of such offences against members of
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. There is justification for an apprehension that if the benefit
of anticipatory bail is made available to such persons, who are alleged to have committed such
offences, there is every likelihood of their misusing their liberty, while on anticipatory bail to
terrorise their victims and prevent a proper investigation. The Court held that Section 18 cannot be
considered, in any manner, violative of Article 21 of the Constitution of India.
Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016
19. After the verdict of the Supreme Court, in State of M. P. and Anr. vs. Ram Kishna Balothia and
Anr. (supra), upholding constitutional validity of Section 18 of the Act, a Full- Bench of the
Rajasthan High Court was called upon, once again, to examine, in Virendra Singh vs. State of
Rajasthan, reported in 2000 Crl. L. J. 2899, whether a High Court, while dealing with an application
for pre-arrest bail, can scrutinize and examine the materials to see if a prima facie case is made out
constituting the offence under the Act or whether it would be justified in rejecting the application
merely because the case has been registered under the said Act or it is registered along with some
other penal provisions of the IPC. The Bench, being conscious of the fact that Section 18 of the Act,
explicitly bars the grant of pre-arrest bail to a person if he is an accused of committing an offence
under the Act, sought through general notice circulated to the members of the Bar to address the
Court on the question in order to determine whether an application for pre-arrest bail could be
rejected merely because a case has been registered under Section 3 of the Act or the Court would be
justified in examining as to whether a person is at all fit to be treated as an accused of an offence
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/33558496/ 11
Rama Shankar Singh & Ors vs The State Of Bihar on 27 October, 2016
under the Act, or the extent of judicial competence, if any, to examine the relevant materials in order
to determine whether an accused can prima facie be treated as an accused under the Act.
Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016
20. In response to the said notice, two sets of arguments and opinions were advanced before the
Court. One set of arguments was that although the Courts would not be justified in entering into
roving inquiry of the allegations levelled against a person accused of an offence, under Section 3 of
the Act, by looking into the police case-diary, charge-sheet or other materials, yet the Court ought to
peruse, at least, the First Information Report or the Complaint in order to determine whether the
accused persons can at all be said to have committed an offence under the Act before rejecting his
application for pre-arrest bail merely on the ground of its maintainability. The submission was that
the provisions should not be considered in the manner as to create a complete bar even to entertain
an application, under Section 438 of the Code, without application of mind on the facts as to
whether accusations made against any person constitute any offence under the Act or not. Another
sets of arguments was that Section 18 of the Act creates a complete bar and the Court cannot even
entertain an application for grant of pre-arrest bail under Section 438 of the Code, once the case is
registered by the police under the Act. It was argued that the Court should have no occasion to
peruse even the First Information Report or Complaint to find out whether any offence and, if so,
what offence(s), under the Act, has been constituted or not.
Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016
21. After evaluating the arguments and counter arguments, the Full-Bench of the Rajasthan High
Court held that the Courts, while dealing with an application filed, under Section 438 of the Code,
would be justified in merely examining as to whether there is at all an accusation against a person
for registering a case under Section 3 of the Act and once the ingredients of the offence are available
in the First Information Report or the Complaint, the Courts would not be justified in entering into a
further inquiry by summoning case-diary or any other material so as to determine whether
allegations are true or false or whether there is any preponderance of probability of commission of
such offence; but if the allegations, in the First Information Report or the Complaint, even if they
are taken at their face value and are accepted in their entirety, do not constitute the offence alleged,
under the Act, it is only in those miniscule number of cases that the Courts would be justified in
entertaining the application, not because it is maintainable, but because the Act would be
inapplicable to the facts and circumstances of that particular case. The Bench held that the
application for pre-arrest bail can be entertained only on the inapplicability of the Act due to the
facts of the case, which will have to be gathered only from the First Information Report and not
beyond that because once it is gathered from the First Information Report that the applicant is an
accused Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016 of committing an offence under Section 3 of
the Act, the bar of Section 18 would instantly operate against the person, who had been made
accused of the offence under the Act. It further held that if, in the First Information Report itself, the
ingredients of the offence, as laid down under Section 3 of the Act, are found to be missing, the bar,
created by Section 18, would not be allowed to operate against a person and only in that event, his
application for pre-arrest bail would be dealt with by the concerned Court to determine whether the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/33558496/ 12
Rama Shankar Singh & Ors vs The State Of Bihar on 27 October, 2016
Act can be said to be rightly applicable against the accused and not to enter into the matter so as to
determine whether the allegation levelled against the accused, in the First Information Report, are
true or false and there would be no justification to enter into the matter further in order to examine
the allegation levelled against the accused even prima facie correct or incorrect.
22. In Ramesh Prasad Bhanja and Ors. vs. State of Orissa, reported in 1996 Crl.L.J. 2743, the
learned single Judge of Orissa High Court, while considering the provisions of Section 18 of the Act,
was of the view that the expression "accusation of having committed an offence under the Act" does
not mean that mere registration of the case under the Act would ipso facto attract the prohibition
contained in Section 18. The learned single Judge observed that the opinion of the police, regarding
the nature of the Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016 alleged offence, is neither final nor
conclusive. The Court further observed :
"Merely because a case is mechanically registered under the Act, the provision of
Section 438 of the Code cannot be said to be inapplicable in each and every case. If
the allegations make out a prima facie case under Section 3 or for that matter
Sections 4 and 5 of the Act, the jurisdiction to entertain an application under Section
438 is definitely ousted. Where however, the allegations do not make out any prima
facie case punishable under any provision of the Act, the bar under Section 18 is
inapplicable and the provision of Section 438 of the Code can be availed of."
23. Considering the provisions of the Act and, after noticing the decision of the Supreme Court in
State of M. P. and Anr. vs. Ram Kishna Balothia and Anr. (supra), a learned single Judge of the
Delhi High Court, in the case of Mukesh Kumar Saini and Ors. vs. State (Delhi Administration),
reported in 2001 Crl.L.J. 4587, observed as under :
"6. There cannot be any dispute about the proposition of law that anticipatory bail
cannot be availed by the persons, who have committed the offences under the SC/ST
Act. However, merely because of Section of the SC/ST Act mentioned in the FIR, by
itself cannot be a ground to decline the pre-arrest bail. Judicial Patna High Court
Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016 scrutiny of the documents, is permissible, to evaluate
whether the material relied upon by the prosecution reveals existence of basic
ingredients of the offence or not. The Court can shift the material for this limited
purpose...."
24. Recently, in Vilas Pandurang Pawar and Anr. vs. State of Maharashtra and Ors. (AIR 2012 SC
3316), the Supreme Court had an occasion to deal with an application for grant of pre-arrest bail
under Section 438 of the Code in a case, wherein the accused was charged with various offences
under the IPC along with the provisions of the Act. The Supreme Court, after hearing the parties,
held, in paragraph Nos. 8 and 9, as under :-
"8. Section 18 of the SC/ST Act creates a bar for invoking Section 438 of the Code.
However, a duty is cast on the court to verify the averments in the complaint and to
find out whether an offence under Section 3(1) of the SC/ST Act has been prima facie
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/33558496/ 13
Rama Shankar Singh & Ors vs The State Of Bihar on 27 October, 2016
made out. In other words, there is a specific averment in the complaint, namely,
insult or intimidation with intent to humiliate by calling with caste name, the accused
persons are not entitled to anticipatory bail.
(9) The scope of Section 18 of the SC/ST Act read with Section 438 of the Code is
such that it creates a specific bar in the grant of anticipatory bail. When an offence is
registered against a person under the provisions of the SC/ST Act, no Patna High
Court Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016 court shall entertain application for anticipatory
bail, unless it prima facie finds that such an offence is not made out. Moreover, while
considering the application for bail, scope for appreciation of evidence and other
material on record is limited. Court is not expected to indulge in critical analysis of
the evidence on record. When a provision has been enacted in the Specific Act to
protect the persons who belong to the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes
and a bar has been imposed in granting bail under Section 438 of the Code, the
provisions in the Special Act cannot be brushed aside by elaborate discussion on the
evidence."
(emphasis mine)
25. It is clear from a close reading of the decision of the Supreme Court, in Vilas Pandurang Pawar
(supra), that though Section 18 of the Act creates a bar in invoking Section 438 of the Code, a duty is
cast on the Court to verify the averments in the Complaint/First Information Report to find out
whether an offence, under Section 3 of the Act has been prima facie made out against the accused
seeking pre-arrest bail or not. In case, a prima facie case, under the Act, is made out against the
accused, the bar, under Section 18 of the Act, would, immediately, come into play.
26. On a careful consideration of the provisions prescribed under Section 18 of the Act, the law laid
down by the Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016 Supreme Court, in State of M. P. vs. Ram
Kishna Balothia (supra) and Vilas Pandurang Pawar (supra) and by the Full-Bench of the Rajasthan
High Court, in Virendra Singh (supra), and the other decisions of the different High Courts noticed
hereinabove the answer to the first three questions framed by us becomes abundantly clear.
27. In view of specific embargo of Section 18 of the Act and the binding precedents of the Supreme
Court noticed above, we hold that pre-arrest bail, under Section 438 of the Code, is not available to
persons committing offences under the Act. We further hold that Section 18 of the Act totally bars a
court from either making a judicial scrutiny of the case or granting pre-arrest bail to the accused of
committing offence under the provisions of the Act. However, from the law laid down by the
Supreme Court in Vilas Pandurang Pawar (supra), it becomes clear that notwithstanding the
embargo created by Section 18 of the Act against grant of pre-arrest bail, a duty is cast upon the
court, hearing an application under Section 438 of the Code, to determine, on the basis of the
statements, made in the Complaint/First Information Report, if the ingredients of any offence,
under the Act, are made out or not. If the ingredients of the offence are attracted against a person
seeking pre-arrest bail, the embargo of Section 18 of the Act would, Patna High Court Cr.Misc.
No.25276 of 2016 immediately, come into play against such person; but merely because a criminal
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/33558496/ 14
Rama Shankar Singh & Ors vs The State Of Bihar on 27 October, 2016
case is instituted against a person under the Act without there being any allegation against him of
having committed an offence under the Act, the Court can very well entertain an application under
Section 438 of the Code and under such circumstance, the embargo, created under Section 18 of the
Act, would not come into play inasmuch as the legislative intent is to exclude the power of the Court
to grant pre-arrest bail to a person apprehending arrest, who is alleged to have committed an
offence under the Act and not a person, whose name finds place in the column of accused either in
Complaint or in the First Information Report without there being any accusation against him of
having committed an offence under the Act.
28. We reiterate that while considering the application under Section 438 of the Code, it is not open
to the Court to enter into roving inquiry of the veracity of allegations levelled under the Act. It can
only look to the First Information Report or the Complaint just in order to prima facie determine
whether the ingredients of any offence under the Act at all can be said to have been attracted against
the person seeking pre- arrest bail.
29. Having answered the first three questions, in Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016 order
to find out an effective answer to the remaining questions, one will have to look to the object behind
the Act. The Legislature had enacted the Act with a view to prevent commission of offence of
atrocities against the members of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. Being concerned
with the continuing allegations of atrocities despite the deterrent provision made in the Act against
the members of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, the Parliament made certain
amendments in the Act, vide Amendment Act, 2015, which came into force, with effect from
26.01.2016, vide Gazette Notification, dated 18th January, 2016.
30. The amendments, brought under the existing Act, broadly covered five issues, namely, (1)
Amendments to the existing Sections and expanding the scope of presumption;
(2) Institutional strengthening;
(3) Appeals (a new Section);
(4) Establishing rights of victims and witnesses (a new chapter); and, (5) Strengthening the
preventive measures.
31. The objective of the amendments, so introduced in the existing Act, is to deliver the members of
the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes greater justice as well as to provide for enhanced
deterrent to the offenders. The Amendment Act, 2015, allowed establishment of Exclusive Special
Courts and Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016 appointment of Special Public Prosecutor
for trial of offences, under the Act, to enable speedy and expeditious disposal of cases.
32. The term "Special Court", defined under Section 2(d), and the "Exclusive Special Court", defined
under Section 2(bd) of the Act, are as under : ― "2(d) ― "Special Court" means a Court of Session
specified as a Special Court in section 14.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/33558496/ 15
Rama Shankar Singh & Ors vs The State Of Bihar on 27 October, 2016
2(bd) ― "Exclusive Special Court"
means the Exclusive Special Court established under sub-section (1) of Section 14 exclusively to try
the offences under this Act"
33. Having considered the object behind the Amendment Act, 2015, it would be
relevant to take note of Section 14 of the Act prior to its amendment, which read as
under : ― "14. For the purpose of providing for speedy trial, the State Government
shall, with the concurrence of the Chief Justice of the High Court, by notification in
the Official Gazette, specify for each district a Court of Session to be a Special Court
to try the offences under this Act."
(emphasis mine)
34. Section 14 of the Act has been substituted by the Amendment Act, 2015. The substituted
provisions of Section Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016 14 read as under : ― "14. Special
Court and Exclusive Special Court.-
(1) For the purpose of providing for speedy trial, the State Government shall, with the concurrence
of the Chief Justice of the High Court, by notification in the Official Gazette, establish an Exclusive
Special Court for one or more Districts:
Provided that in Districts where less number of cases under this Act is recorded, the
State Government shall, with the concurrence of the Chief Justice of the High Court,
by notification in the Official Gazette, specify for such Districts, the Court of Session
to be a Special Court to try the offences under this Act:
Provided further that the Courts so established or specified shall have power to
directly take cognizance of offences under this Act.
(2) It shall be the duty of the State Government to establish adequate number of
Courts to ensure that cases under this Act are disposed of within a period of two
months, as far as possible. (3) In every trial in the Special Court or the Exclusive
Special Court, the proceedings shall be continued from day-to-day until all the
witnesses in attendance have been examined, unless the Special Court or the
Exclusive Special Court finds the adjournment of the same beyond the Patna High
Court Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016 following day to be necessary for reasons to be
recorded in writing:
Provided that when the trial relates to an offence under this Act, the trial shall, as far
as possible, be completed within a period of two months from the date of filing of the
charge sheet"
(emphasis mine)
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/33558496/ 16
Rama Shankar Singh & Ors vs The State Of Bihar on 27 October, 2016
35. From a reading of the proviso (2) of the substituted Section 14(1) of the Act, it
would be apparent that the Special Courts and the Exclusive Special Courts,
established under the Act, have been vested with the power to directly take
cognizance of the offences punishable under the Act.
36. At this juncture, I think it appropriate to refer to Section 193 of the Code, which
reads as under :
"193. Cognizance of offences by Courts of Session:- Except as otherwise expressly
provided by this Code or by any other law for the time being in force, no Court of
Session shall take cognizance of any offence as a Court of original jurisdiction unless
the case has been committed to it by a Magistrate under this Code."
(emphasis mine)
37. It would be evident from a reading of Section 193 of the Code that the Investigating Officer is
required to file his report on completion of investigation under Section 173 of the Patna High Court
Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016 Code in the Court of Magistrate only. Similarly, even a Complaint, under
Section 200 of the Code, is required to be filed in the Court of Magistrate. Under ordinary
circumstances, a Court of Session would be denuded of the power to directly take cognizance of the
offence unless the case is committed to it under Section 209 of the Code by a Court of Magistrate. In
other words, no Court of Session can take cognizance of any offence, as a Court of original
jurisdiction, unless the case has been committed to it by a Magistrate under the Code. However,
there is an exception to the general rule under Section 193 of the Code, which permits the Court of
Session to take cognizance of an offence, as a court of original jurisdiction, if it is expressly provided
either by the Code or by any other law for the time being in force.
38. Prior to coming into force of the Amendment Act, 2015, different High Courts expressed
conflicting views in respect of the issue, whether Special Court, constituted, under Section 14 of the
Act, can take cognizance of the offences under the Act directly as a Court of original jurisdiction
without the case being committed to it by the Court of Magistrate or can it take cognizance of the
offences under the Act only on committal by a Court of Magistrate following the procedure
stipulated under Section 209 of the Code.
39. A Division-Bench of the Kerala High Court, in Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016 Re :
Director General of Prosecution, reported in 1993 Crl.L.J. 760, a Full-Bench of the same High Court
in Hareendran vs. Sarada, reported in 1995(1) KLT 23, a Full-Bench of the Rajasthan High Court, in
Bhura Lal and Ors. vs. State and Ors., reported in 1999 Crl.L.J. 3552, and a Full-Bench of the
Madhya Pradesh High Court, in Anand Swaroop Tiwari vs. Ram Ratan Jatav, reported in 1996 MP
LJ 141, took a view that a Court of Magistrate, designated as Special Court under the Act, is a Court
of original jurisdiction and it has all the powers provided under Section 190 of the Code. On other
hand, a Division-Bench of Andhra Pradesh High Court, in Referring Officer vs. Police Station,
Khammam, reported in 1999 Crl.L.J. 4173, took a view that the Special Court, constituted under the
Act, cannot take cognizance of the offence under the Act directly. The Bench held that the Court of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/33558496/ 17
Rama Shankar Singh & Ors vs The State Of Bihar on 27 October, 2016
Session, being armed with powers of Special Court by virtue of notification issued by the State
Government under Section 14 of the Act, does not loose its character as a Court of Session. Several
other High Courts also took the same view as that of Andhra Pradesh High Court in Referring
Officer vs. Police Station, Khammam (supra).
40. However, the Supreme Court, in Gangula Ashok vs. State of Andhra Pradesh (AIR 2000 SC
740), after taking note of Section 6 of the Code and Section 14 of the Act, Patna High Court Cr.Misc.
No.25276 of 2016 resolved the conflicting views expressed by different High Courts in different
decisions. The Supreme Court, referring to Section 14 of the Act and Section 193 of the Code, held
that the intendment of the legislature is to treat the Special Court, under the Act, to be a Court of
Session even after specifying it as a Special Court and it would continue to be essentially a Court of
Session and designation of it as a Special Court would not denude it of its character or even powers
as a Court of Session. The Court further held that the trial, in such a Court, can be conducted only in
the manner provided under Chapter XXXIII of the Code, which contains fascicle of provisions for
„trial before a Court of Session(cid:129). It further held that Section 14 of the Act prohibits Special Court
from taking cognizance of offences under the Act as Court of original jurisdiction unless the case has
been committed to it by the Court of Magistrate, who, by virtue of Section 190 of the Code, is
obligated to take cognizance of the offence. Referring to the Constitution Bench decisions in A. R.
Antulay vs. Ramdas Sriniwas Nayak, reported in (1984) 2 SCC 500, and in Directorate of
Enforcement vs. Deepak Mahajan, reported in (1994) 3 SCC 440, the Supreme Court held, in
paragraph 16, as under :-
"16. Hence we have no doubt that a Special Court under this Act is essentially a Court
of Session and it can take cognizance of the offence when the case is committed to it
by the Magistrate Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016 in accordance with
the provisions of the Code. In other words, a complaint or a charge-sheet cannot
straightway be laid before the Special Court under the Act."
41. In view of the decision of the Supreme Court, in Gangula Ashok vs. State of Andhra Pradesh
(supra), there remains no doubt that prior to coming into force of the Amendment Act, 2015, a
Court, designated as Special Court, under Section 14 of the Act, was essentially a Court of Session.
42. In the backdrop of the second proviso to the substituted Section 14(1) of the Act, which
specifically confers power upon the Special Court and the Exclusive Special Court to take cognizance
of the offences under the Act directly, it would be evident that an exception to the general rule under
Section 193 of the Code has been created.
43. There is no dispute with regard to fact that the Act is a Special Act and the second proviso to
Section 14(1) of the Act, positively and unequivocally, provides that the Special Court, which is
essentially a Court of Session, shall have power to directly take cognizance of the offence. Hence, the
interdict of Section 193 of the Code has been removed by making specific provision in the Special
Act.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/33558496/ 18
Rama Shankar Singh & Ors vs The State Of Bihar on 27 October, 2016
44. This issue can be examined from a different angle also. Part-II of the first schedule of the Code
prescribes that Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016 only a Court of Session is authorized to
try the offence under laws other than IPC that are punishable with either death, imprisonment for
life or imprisonment for a term more than 7 years; whereas a Magistrate of 1st class is empowered to
try an offence if it is punishable with imprisonment for a term more than three years, but less than 7
years and an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term of less than three years or with fine
only may be tried by any Magistrate. The offences, under Section 3(1) of the Act, are punishable with
a maximum sentence of 5 years with fine; but, certain offences under sub-section (2) of Section 3
prescribe punishment for death and certain offences prescribe punishment of imprisonment for life.
In view of Part-II of the first schedule of the Code, such offences can be tried only by a Court of
Session. We have already seen that the offences, under the Act, are to be tried either by a Special
Court or by the Exclusive Special Court constituted under the Act. If the offences alleged against the
accused attract ingredients of the offences under Section 3 of the Act and also ingredients of
offence(s) under the IPC, a Special Court or the Exclusive Special Court, as the case may be, would
be competent to take cognizance and hold trial for the offences under the two different provisions in
the same proceeding by virtue of the provisions prescribed under Section 220 of the Code.
45. In view of the legislative changes, as noticed Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016
hereinabove, it is of salience to note that in view of substituted Section 14 of the Act, the police is
required to transmit the FIR, after institution of the case to Special Court or Exclusive Special Court,
as a Court of original jurisdiction, and for the same reason, the charge-sheet or a complaint is also
required to be filed before Special Court or Exclusive Special Court for the offences under the Act. It
would be further evident that from the date of coming into force of the Amendment Act, 2015, the
Court of Magistrate, being not a Special Court or Exclusive Special Court within the meaning of
Section 14 of the Act, shall not have any jurisdiction to entertain any application and take
cognizance of the offence under the Act. The requirement of the committal proceeding, under
Section 209 of the Code, has also been done away with. The object behind doing so is to enable
speedy and expeditious disposal of the cases.
46. For the reasons aforestated, in so far as an application for bail under the provisions of Chapter
XXXIII of the Code can, now, be filed only in the Special Court or Exclusive Special Court, as the
case may be, constituted under the Act. This is also, because a person aggrieved by such order may
file an appeal before the High Court under Section 14-A(2) of the Act both on law and facts, which
provision, we will discuss in detail later on. If the order granting or refusing bail is not passed by a
designated Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016 Special Court or Exclusive Special Court,
no appeal would be maintainable and the party aggrieved by the order would remain remediless.
47. For the reasons aforestated, we determine the fourth issue by holding that an application, under
Section 438 of the Code for the limited purpose of satisfying the Court that even on the basis of
allegation contained in First Information Report or Complaint petition, no ingredients of
commission of any offence under the provisions of the Act, are attracted, has to be filed only before
an appropriate Court.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/33558496/ 19
Rama Shankar Singh & Ors vs The State Of Bihar on 27 October, 2016
48. At this stage, in order to determine the remaining two issues, one has to keep in mind Section
14-A of the Act, which has been inserted after Section 14 of the Act by Amendment Act, 2015. It
reads as under :
"14-A. Appeals.- (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure,1973 (2
of 1974), an appeal shall lie, from any judgment, sentence or order, not being an interlocutory order,
of a Special Court or an Exclusive Special Court, to the High Court both on facts and on law.
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (3) of section 378 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), an appeal shall lie to the High Court against an order of the Special
Court or the Exclusive Special Court Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016 granting or
refusing bail.
(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, every appeal
under this section shall be preferred within a period of ninety days from the date of the judgment,
sentence or order appealed from:
Provided that the High Court may entertain an appeal after the expiry of the said
period of ninety days if it is satisfied that the appellant had sufficient cause for not
preferring the appeal within the period of ninety days:
Provided further that no appeal shall be entertained after the expiry of the period of
one hundred and eighty days.
(4) Every appeal preferred under sub-
section (1) shall, as far as possible, be disposed of within a period of three months from the date of
admission of the appeal."
(emphasis mine)
49. The legal proposition that a Special Act (the Act in the present case) shall override the provisions
of the General Act (Code in the present case) could also be of some relevance for determination of
the issues left to be answered.
50. In that view of the matter, it would be profitable to refer to Sections 4 and 5 of the Code, which
read as under :
"Section 4. Trial of offences under the Indian Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25276 of
2016 Penal Code and other laws.-
(1) All offences under the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) shall be investigated,
inquired into, tried, and otherwise dealt with according to the provisions hereinafter
contained. (2) All offences under any other law shall be investigated, inquired into,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/33558496/ 20
Rama Shankar Singh & Ors vs The State Of Bihar on 27 October, 2016
tried, and otherwise dealt with according to the same provisions, but subject to any
enactment for the time being in force regulating the manner or place of investigating,
inquiring into, trying or otherwise dealing with such offences.
Section 5. Saving.- Nothing contained in this Code shall, in the absence of a specific provision to the
contrary, affect any special or local law for the time being in force, or any special jurisdiction or
power conferred, or any special form of procedure prescribed, by any other law for the time being in
force."
(emphasis mine)
51. A conjoint effect of Section 4(2) read with Section 5 of the Code is that all offences, whether
under the IPC or under any other law, have to be investigated, inquired into, tried and otherwise
dealt with according to the provisions of the Code, unless there be an enactment regulating the
manner or place of investigating, inquiring into, trying or otherwise dealing with such offences, in
which case an enactment will prevail over Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016 those of
Code. The jurisdiction, under Section 4 of the Code, is comprehensive and to the extent that till no
valid machinery is set up under any Act for investigation or trial, the jurisdiction of the machinery,
provided under the Code, cannot be said to have been excluded.
52. From a close reading of the newly inserted Section 14-A of the Act, it would be evident that
sub-section (1) of Section 14-A of the Act provides that no appeal would lie against any interlocutory
order passed by Special Court or Exclusive Special Court. It is well settled that an order granting or
refusing bail is an interlocutory order inasmuch as it is not a judgment or final order, which
terminates a criminal proceeding pending before the Court. However, an exception has been carved
in clause (2) of Section 14-A, which provides an appeal against an interlocutory order passed by the
Special Court or the Exclusive Special Court either granting or refusing bail under the Act. Thus, it
can be said that sub-section (2) of Section 14-A is based on the doctrine of reasonable classification
and it is to be read as an exception to the general principle.
53. Though other interlocutory orders passed by the Special Court or the Exclusive Special Court, as
the case may be, are not appealable at all in view of the provisions prescribed under Section 14-A(1)
of the Amendment Act, 2015, the order granting or Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016
refusing bail is an order against which an appeal is permitted under newly inserted Section 14-A(2)
of the Act. This is so, because as provided under sub-section (3) of Section 14, every trial, under the
Act, is to proceed on day-to-day basis and has to be conducted expeditiously. Therefore, no appeal is
provided against any other interlocutory orders passed by the Special Court or the Exclusive Special
Court.
54. The reasoning behind the exception carved out is because those orders are concerning the liberty
of the accused, as would appear from the interpretation given to in pari materia provisions of
Section 21(1) and (4) of the National Investigation Agency Act, 2008 (for short „the NIA Act(cid:129)) by the
Supreme Court in State of A.P. Vs. Mohd. Hussain alias Saleem, reported in (2014) 1 SCC 258.

55. Let us, now, take a glance at Section 21 of the NIA Act, which reads as under :
"21. Appeals. -
1. Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code, an appeal shall lie from any
judgment, sentence or order, not being an interlocutory order, of a Special Court to
the High Court both on facts and on law.
2. Every appeal under sub-section (1) shall be heard by a bench of two Judges of the
High Court and shall, as far as possible, be disposed of within Patna High Court
Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016 a period of three months from the date of admission of the
appeal.
3. Except as aforesaid, no appeal or revision shall lie to any court from any judgment,
sentence or order including an interlocutory order of a Special Court.
4. Notwithstanding anything contained in sub- section (3) of section 378 of the Code,
an appeal shall lie to the High Court against an order of the Special Court granting or
refusing bail.
5. Every appeal under this section shall be preferred within a period of thirty days
from the date of the judgment, sentence or order appealed from:
Provided that the High Court may entertain an appeal after the expiry of the said
period of thirty days if it is satisfied that the appellant had sufficient cause for not
preferring the appeal within the period of thirty days:
Provided further that no appeal shall be entertained after the expiry of period of
ninety days."
(emphasis mine)
56. From a bare reading of Section 21 of the NIA Act vis-à-vis Section 14-A of the Act, it becomes
transparent that clause (1) and (4) of the NIA Act are in pari materia newly inserted Section 14-A(1)
and (2) of the Act.
57. The Supreme Court has interpreted clause (1) Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016 and
(4) of NIA Act in State of A.P. Vs. Mohd. Hussain alias Saleem (supra), wherein the principal
submission of the accused respondents was based on the premise that the order, granting or
refusing bail, is an interlocutory order and that the order on a bail application is excluded from the
coverage of Section 21(1) of the NIA Act, which provides for appeals to the High Court from any
judgment, sentence or order of Special Court both on facts and on law. It was argued, on behalf of
the respondents, accused that it is only those appeals, which are covered under Section 21(1) that are
to be heard by two Judges of the High Court, as laid down under Section 21(1) of the NIA Act. The
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/33558496/ 22
Rama Shankar Singh & Ors vs The State Of Bihar on 27 October, 2016
appeal against refusal of bail lies to the High Court under Section 21(4) and not under Section 21(1)
and, therefore, it need not be heard by a Bench of two Judges. It was also argued, on behalf of the
respondents accused, that the bail application, which the accused had filed before the Bombay High
Court, was one under Section 124 of the Maharashtra Control of Crimes Act read with Section 439 of
the Code and was fully maintainable before a Single Judge.
58. After hearing the submission of the parties, the Supreme Court discussed and interpreted the
provisions prescribed under Section 21 of the NIA Act in paragraph Nos. 17, 18 and 19 as under : ―
"17. There is no difficulty in accepting the Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016 submission
on behalf of the appellant that an order granting or refusing bail is an interlocutory order. The point
however to be noted is that as provided under Section 21(4), the appeal against such an order lies to
the High Court only, and to no other court as laid down in Section 21(3). Thus it is only the
interlocutory orders granting or refusing bail which are made appealable, and no other interlocutory
orders, which is made clear in Section 21(1), which lays down that an appeal shall lie to the High
Court from any judgment, sentence or order, not being an interlocutory order of a Special Court.
Thus other interlocutory orders are not appealable at all. This is because as provided under Section
19 of the Act, the trial is to proceed on day to day basis. It is to be conducted expeditiously.
Therefore, no appeal is provided against any of the interlocutory orders passed by the Special Court.
The only exception to this provision is that orders either granting or refusing bail are made
appealable under Section 21(4). This is because those orders are concerning the liberty of the
accused, and therefore although other interlocutory orders are not appealable, an appeal is provided
against the order granting or refusing the bail. Section 21(4), thus carves out an exception to the
exclusion of interlocutory orders, which are not appealable under Section 21(1). The order granting
or refusing the bail is therefore very much an order against which an Patna High Court Cr.Misc.
No.25276 of 2016 appeal is permitted under Section 21(1) of the Act.
18. Section 21(2) provides that every such appeal under sub-Section (1) shall be heard by a bench of
two Judges of the High Court. This is because of the importance that is given by the Parliament to
the prosecution concerning the Scheduled Offences. They are serious offences affecting the
sovereignty and security of the State amongst other offences, for the investigation of which this
Special Act has been passed. If the Parliament in its wisdom has desired that such appeals shall be
heard only by a bench of two Judges of the High Court, this Court cannot detract from the intention
of the Parliament. Therefore, the interpretation placed by Mr. Ram Jethmalani on Section 21(1) that
all interlocutory orders are excluded from Section 21(1) cannot be accepted. If such an interpretation
is accepted it will mean that there will be no appeal against an order granting or refusing bail. On
the other hand, sub-Section (4) has made that specific provision, though sub-Section (1) otherwise
excludes appeals from interlocutory orders. These appeals under sub-Section (1) are to be heard by a
bench of two Judges as provided under sub-Section (2). This being the position, there is no merit in
the submission canvassed on behalf of the appellant that appeals against the orders granting or
refusing bail need not be heard by a bench of two Judges.
Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/33558496/ 23
Rama Shankar Singh & Ors vs The State Of Bihar on 27 October, 2016
19. We cannot ignore that it is a well settled canon of interpretation that when it comes to
construction of a section, it is to be read in its entirety, and its sub-sections are to be read in relation
to each other, and not disjunctively. Besides, the text of a section has to be read in the context of the
statute. A few sub-sections of a section cannot be separated from other sub- sections, and read to
convey something altogether different from the theme underlying the entire section. That is how a
section is required to be read purposively and meaningfully."
(emphasis mine)
59. After analyzing the provisions of Section 21 of the NIA Act, the Supreme Court held in paragraph
Nos. 27.1, 27.2 and 27.3, as under:― "27.1. Firstly, an appeal from an order of the Special Court
under NIA Act, refusing or granting bail shall lie only to a bench of two Judges of the High Court.
27.2. And, secondly as far as prayer (b) of the petition for clarification is concerned, it is made clear
that inasmuch as the applicant is being prosecuted for the offences under the MCOC Act, 1999, as
well as The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, such offences are triable only by Special
Court, and therefore application for bail in such matters will have to be made before the Special
Court under the NIA Act, Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016 2008, and shall not lie before
the High Court either under Section 439 or under Section 482 of the Code. The application for bail
filed by the applicant in the present case is not maintainable before the High Court.
27.3 Thus, where the NIA Act applies, the original application for bail shall lie only before the
Special Court, and appeal against the orders therein shall lie only to a bench of two Judges of the
High Court."
(emphasis mine)
60. In the backdrop of the position of law as delineated above, in the matter of State of A.P. Vs.
Mohd. Hussain alias Saleem (supra), there can be no escape from the conclusion that if an
application for bail or pre-arrest bail, in the cases instituted under the Act, is made under the
provisions prescribed in Chapter XXXIII of the Code in a Special Court or an Exclusive Special
Court and it is granted or refused, an appeal, under newly inserted Section 14-A(2) of the Act, would
lie before the High Court.
61. Accordingly, we hold that against an order granting or refusing bail passed by the Special Court
or Exclusive Special Court, either under Section 438 or under Section 439 of the Code, in respect of
the offences under the Act, no application for pre-arrest bail or bail, under the Code, shall lie before
the High Court and only an appeal, under Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016 Section
14-A(2) of the Act, would be maintainable before the High Court.
62. The fifth question for determination is answered accordingly.
63. Now, the last issue for consideration is whether an accused, apprehending his arrest in a case
instituted under the provision of the Act, can directly file an application under Section 438 of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/33558496/ 24
Rama Shankar Singh & Ors vs The State Of Bihar on 27 October, 2016
Code before the High Court?
64. While considering the above issue, it needs to be noted that the specific question involved in
these cases, is no longer res integra. We may refer to the case of State of Gujarat vs. Salimbhai
Abdulgaffar Shaikh, reported in (2003) 8 SCC 50, wherein the Supreme Court, in a pari materia
provision under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002 (for short „POTA(cid:129)), has lucidly interpreted
the law.
65. But before that ; it is necessary to take note of Section 34 of the POTA, which read as under :-
"34. Appeal.-
(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code, an appeal shall lie from any
judgment, sentence or order, not being an interlocutory order, of a Special Court to
the High Court both on facts and on law.
(2) Every appeal under Sub-section (1) shall be heard by a bench of two Judges of the
High Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016 Court.
(3) Except as aforesaid, no appeal or revision shall lie to any court from any
judgment, sentence or order including an interlocutory order of a Special Court.
(4) Notwithstanding anything contained in Sub-
section (3) of section 378 of the Code, an appeal shall lie to the High Court against an order of the
Special Court granting or refusing bail. (5) Every appeal under this section shall be preferred within
a period of thirty days from the date of the judgment, sentence or order appealed from:
Provided that the High Court may entertain an appeal after the expiry of the said
period of thirty days if it is satisfied that the Appellant had sufficient cause for not
preferring the appeal within the period of thirty days."
(emphasis mine)
66. From a reading of Section 34 of the POTA, it becomes transparent that clause (1) and clause (4)
of Section 34 is in pari materia Section 14-A(1) and (2) of the newly inserted Act.
67. In the matter of State of Gujarat Vs. Salimbhai Abdulgaffar Shaikh (supra), the State of Gujarat
had appealed against an order of the Gujarat High Court, wherein, by invoking Section 439 of the
Code, it had granted bail to persons accused of an offence punishable under the POTA and directed
the State to Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016 release them on bail. Before the Supreme
Court, it was argued, on behalf of the State, that the accused having not applied for bail in relation to
offences under Sections 3 and 4 of the POTA, it was not open to the learned Judge of the High Court
to entertain bail applications and grant bail and having regard to the provisions of Section 34(2) of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/33558496/ 25
Rama Shankar Singh & Ors vs The State Of Bihar on 27 October, 2016
the POTA, only a Bench of two Judges can grant bail in an offence under the POTA and since the
learned single Judge has granted bail in exercise of power under Section 439 of the Code read with
Section 482 of the Code, the order, granting bail, is illegal and without jurisdiction. In the said case,
the Supreme Court pointed out that Section 34(1) of the POTA lays down that an appeal shall lie
from any judgment, sentence or order, not being an interlocutory order, of a Special Court to High
Court, both on facts and on law.
68. Further interpreting the scope of sub-section (4) of Section 34 of the POTA, the Supreme Court
observed, in State of Gujrat Vs. Salimbhai Abdulgaffar Shaikh (supra), at paragraph Nos. 10 and 11,
as under : ― "10. Sub-section (4) of Section 34 of POTA provides for an appeal to the High Court
against an order of the Special Court granting or refusing bail. Though the word 'appeal' is used both
in Code of Criminal Procedure and Code of Civil Procedure and in many other Statutes but it has not
been defined anywhere. Over a period of time, it Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016 has
acquired a definite connotation and meaning which is as under :-
"A proceeding undertaken to have a decision reconsidered by bringing it to a higher
authority, specially the submission of a lower Court's decision to higher Court for
review and possible reversal.
An appeal strictly so called is one in which the question is, whether the order of the
Court from which the appeal is brought was right on the material which the Court
had before it.
An appeal is removal of the cause from an inferior to one of superior jurisdiction for
the purposes of obtaining a review or retrial.
An appeal generally speaking is a rehearing by a superior Court on both law and fact."
11. Broadly speaking, therefore, an appeal is a proceeding taken to rectify an erroneous decision of a
Court by submitting the question to a higher Court, and in view of express language used in
sub-section (1) of Section 34 of POTA the appeal would lie both on facts and on law. Therefore even
an order granting bail can be examined on merits by the High Court without any kind of fetters on
its powers and it can come to an independent conclusion whether the accused deserves to be
released on bail on the merits of the case. The considerations which are generally relevant in the
matter of cancellation of bail under sub-section (2) of Section 439 of the Code will not come in the
way of the High Court in setting aside an order of the Special Court Patna High Court Cr.Misc.
No.25276 of 2016 granting bail. It is therefore evident that the provisions of POTA are in clear
contradistinction with that of Code of Criminal Procedure where no appeal is provided against an
order granting bail. The appeal can lie only against an order of the Special Court and unless there is
an order of the Special Court refusing bail, the accused will have no right to file an appeal before the
High Court praying for grant of bail to them. Existence of an order of the Special Court is, therefore,
sine qua non for approaching the High Court."
(emphasis mine)
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/33558496/ 26
Rama Shankar Singh & Ors vs The State Of Bihar on 27 October, 2016
69. While rejecting the contention of the respondents that the power of the High Court to grant bail,
under Section 439 of the Code, has not been taken away by the POTA and, as such, the learned
single Judge had the jurisdiction to grant bail to the respondents accused in exercise of power
conferred by the said provisions, the Supreme Court, at paragraph Nos. 14 and 15, observed as
under :
"14. That apart if the argument of learned counsel for the respondents is accepted, it
would mean that a person whose bail under POTA has been rejected by the Special
Court will have two remedies and he can avail any one of them at his sweet will. He
may move a bail application before the High Court under Section 439 Cr.P.C. in the
original or concurrent jurisdiction which may be heard by a Single Judge or may
prefer an appeal Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016 under Sub-section (4)
of Section 34 of POTA which would be heard by a bench of two judges. To interpret a
statutory provision in such a manner that a Court can exercise both appellate and
original jurisdiction in respect of the same matter will lead to an incongruous
situation. The contention is therefore fallacious.
15. In the present case, the respondents did not chose to apply for bail before the
Special Court for offences under POTA and consequently there was no order of
refusal of bail for offences under the said Act. The learned single Judge exercising
powers under Section 439 read with Section 482 Cr.P.C. granted them bail. The order
of the High Court is clearly without jurisdiction as under the scheme of the Act the
accused can only file an appeal against an order of refusal of bail passed by the
Special Court before a Division Bench of the High Court and, therefore, the order
under challenge cannot be sustained and has to be set aside. Even on merits the order
of the High Court is far from satisfactory. Though it is a very long order running into
87 paragraphs but the factual aspects of the case have been considered only in one
paragraph and that too in a very general way."
(emphasis mine)
70. Further rejecting the contention of the respondents accused that the High Court has enough
power under Section 482 of the Code while granting bail to the respondents, the Patna High Court
Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016 Supreme Court, in State of Gujarat Vs. Salimbhai Abdulgaffar Shaikh
(supra), observed as under : ― "Section 482 Cr.P.C. saves the inherent power of the High Court. The
High Court possesses the inherent powers to be exercised ex debito justitiae to do the real and
substantial justice for the administration of which alone Courts exist. The power has to be exercised
to prevent abuse of the process of the Court or to otherwise secure the ends of justice. But this power
cannot be resorted to if there is a specific provision in the Code for the redress of the grievance of
the aggrieved party. There being a specific provision for grant of bail, the High Court clearly erred in
taking recourse to Section 482 Cr.P.C. while enlarging the respondents on bail."
(emphasis mine)
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/33558496/ 27
Rama Shankar Singh & Ors vs The State Of Bihar on 27 October, 2016
71. Thus, in the light of the observations made in State of Gujarat Vs. Salimbhai Abdulgaffar Shaikh
(supra), it becomes clear that an appeal is a proceeding to rectify the erroneous decision both on
facts and on law. The order granting or refusing bail, in the light of the provisions of Section 34(4) of
the POTA, could have been examined on merit by the High Court without any other fetter.
72. While laying down the Scheme for bail under the POTA, the Supreme Court held that it is in
contradistinction to Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016 that of the Code. It pointed out
that an appeal would lie only against an order of the Special Court and unless there is an order of a
Special Court refusing or granting bail, the accused cannot prefer an appeal before the High Court
seeking bail. What follows further from the above discussion is that even the High Court could not
have invoked its power under Section 439 of the Code to grant bail to a person accused of an offence
under the POTA.
73. It would also mean that in order to obtain release on bail, the accused person, arrested under the
POTA, was required to, first, apply to the Special Court, where the Special Court was constituted and
if his application for bail was rejected, then, only he could have preferred appeal against the order
refusing bail. Similarly, even the State could have preferred an appeal if the Special Court happened
to grant bail to such an accused person.
74. We have already seen that the provisions, prescribed under Section 14-A, are in clear
contradistinction to that of the Code. Section 14-A of the Act provides for an appeal against an order
of the Special Court and, in view of the ratio laid down by the Supreme Court, in State of Gujarat Vs.
Salimbhai Abdulgaffar Shaikh (supra), it becomes clear that unless there is an order of Special Court
refusing or granting pre-arrest bail, under Section 438 of the Code, the accused cannot invoke the
power of the High Court, under Section 438 of the Code, to grant pre-arrest Patna High Court
Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016 bail.
75. In other words, in order to obtain an order under Section 438 of the Code, an accused is required
to, first, apply to the Special Court or the Exclusive Special Court, as the case may be, and he can,
thereafter, prefer an appeal against an order refusing bail if his application for is rejected by such
Court. Similarly, even the State can prefer an appeal if the Special Court or the Exclusive Special
Court, as the case may be, allows an application for pre- arrest bail made under Section 438 of the
Code, to such an accused person. Further, unless there is an order of the Special Court or the
Exclusive Special Court granting or refusing bail, the accused will have no right to file an appeal
before the High Court for grant of pre-arrest bail.
76. Thus, existence of an order of the Special Court or the Exclusive Special Court is a sine qua non
for approaching the High Court in appeal. This is because the provisions, prescribed under Section
14-A of the Act, have an overriding effect over the provisions of the Code in view of the provisions
prescribed under Section 4(2) of the Code.
77. Thus, we have no hesitation in holding that in a case instituted under the provisions of the Act,
an accused, apprehending his arrest, cannot directly file an application, under Section 438 of the
Code, seeking pre-arrest bail before Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.25276 of 2016 this Court as the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/33558496/ 28
Rama Shankar Singh & Ors vs The State Of Bihar on 27 October, 2016
provisions, prescribed under Section 14-A(1) and (2) of the Act, like Section 34(1) and (4) of the
POTA, are in clear contradistinction to that of the Code, where no appeal is provided against an
order granting or refusing bail. Hence, an appeal can lie only against an order of the Special Court or
the Exclusive Special Court, as the case may be. The accused will have no right to directly file an
application under Section 438 of the Code before this Court for grant of pre-arrest bail.
78. Having answered the issues involved in these applications, we remit these applications to the
respective learned Single Judges to pass appropriate order(s) in accordance with law.
