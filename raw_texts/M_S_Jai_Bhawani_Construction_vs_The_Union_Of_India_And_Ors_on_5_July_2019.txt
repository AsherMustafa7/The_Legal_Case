CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE RAJEEV RANJAN PRASAD
ORAL JUDGMENT
Date : 05-07-2019
Patna High Court CWJC No.1452 of 2019 dt.05-07-2019
8/29
Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, learned
counsel representing the State as well as learned Assistant
Solicitor General representing the Union of India.
All these writ applications are raising a common
question as to the effect of coming into force of the Goods
and Services Tax Act (hereinafter referred to as the "GST
Act, 2017") in respect of the tenders which were floated
prior to coming into force of the Act of 2017 and in respect
thereof the agreement i.e. the Standard Bidding Document
(in short the "SBD") applicable in the Works Departments
of the Government of Bihar contains Clause 35 which deals
with the condition of reimbursement of levy/taxes if levied
after receipt of the tenders. Similar provision is there in the
Model Bidding Document (in short 'MBD').
The petitioners moved this court stating that they
had participated in the tender process prior to coming into
force of the GST Act, 2017, when Bihar VAT Act, 2005 was
in force and applicable in relation to the contracts in
question. According to the petitioners, after coming into
force of the GST Act, 2017 it was incumbent upon the
Works Department of the Government of Bihar to suitably
Patna High Court CWJC No.1452 of 2019 dt.05-07-2019
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198039280/ 8
M/S. Jai Bhawani Construction vs The Union Of India And Ors on 5 July, 2019

amend Clause '35' of the conditions for reimbursement of
levy/taxes if levied after receipt of tenders, as in absence of
suitable amendments thereof the petitioners were being
made liable to pay GST without there being any provision
for reimbursement of the liabilities falling upon them by
virtue of the implementation of the GST Act, 2017.
Their contention in all these writ applications is
that there are such contracts in which the estimates were
prepared and agreement were executed prior to 01.07.2017
i.e. the date of commencement of GST Act, but the work
continued even after that, there are contracts in which the
estimates were prepared prior to 01.07.2017 but the
agreements were executed after 01.07.2017 and yet there
are contracts in which both the estimates prepared and
agreements have been executed after 01.07.2017 and in
order to meet the requirement of the GST Act, 2017 in its
terms and spirit Clause 35 was required to be amended
suitably.
Before further dealing with the contentions, it
would be just and proper to quote relevant Clause 35 of the
Standard Bidding Document (in short 'SBD') prevailing on

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198039280/ 9
M/S. Jai Bhawani Construction vs The Union Of India And Ors on 5 July, 2019
which reads as under : -
"35. Conditions for reimbursement of Levy/taxes if levied after receipt of tenders.
(i) All tendered rates shall be inclusive of all taxes and levies payable under respective
statutes.
However, pursuant to the Constitution (46 th Amendment) Act, 1982, if any further tax or levy is
imposed by Statute, after the last stipulated date for the receipt of tender including extensions if any
and the contractor thereupon necessarily and properly pays such taxes/levies the contractor shall be
reimbursed the amount so paid, provided such payments, if any, is not, in the opinion of the Chief
Engineer (whose decision shall be final and binding on the contractor) attributable to delay in
execution of work within the control of the contractor.
(ii) The contractor shall keep necessary books of account and other documents for the purpose of
this condition as may be necessary and shall allow inspection of the same by a duly authorized
representative of the government and/or the Engineer in Charge and further shall furnish such
other information/document as the Engineer in Charge may require from time to time.
(iii) The Contractor shall, within a period of 30 days of the imposition of any such further tax or
levy, pursuant to the Constitution (forty Sixth Amendment) Act, 1982, give a written notice thereof
to the Engineer in Charge that the same is given pursuant to this condition, together with all
necessary information relating thereto." Patna High Court CWJC No.1452 of 2019 dt.05-07-2019 In
course of argument, Mr. Prabhat Ranjan, learned counsel representing the petitioner(s) submitted
that till the date of filing of the writ application, the State Government had not provided for any
mechanism to find out the amount payable as 'GST' on those works contract of the nature stated
above, there was no mechanism as to who would be competent to deduct the amount payable under
'GST' and how the same shall be deposited in the government exchequer and would be refunded to
the contractor and because of the inaction on the part of the government, the petitioners were
required to deposit on recurring basis an amount of 12% on each and every bills without there being
any stipulation as to how such amount so deposited shall be reimbursed.
It is also contended that the inaction of the State Government has a material bearing on the profit of
the contractor inasmuch as an amount of 10% of the net value of the estimate is approved as
contractor's profit but on account of 'GST' the contractors were being compelled to deposit an
amount of 12% at GST which was never Patna High Court CWJC No.1452 of 2019 dt.05-07-2019
contemplated under the Bihar VAT Act, 2005.
Attention of this court has also been drawn to the fact that the Water Resources Department in the
Government of Bihar has formulated a modus operandi making provision of GST in the works
contract and the Commercial Taxes Department has been requested to accord concurrence to the
same but the Department has not accorded the concurrence as yet. It is, thus, his submission that
this court should issue a direction to the respondents to delete Clause 35 and a consequential
direction be issued to incorporate the provision for the reimbursement of the amount being
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198039280/ 10
M/S. Jai Bhawani Construction vs The Union Of India And Ors on 5 July, 2019
collected in the form of GST after 01.07.2017. The petitioners have also prayed for a direction to the
respondents to provide for the refund of the amount being paid/deposited under the GST from the
various running accounts bills of the contractors. A consequential prayer has been made to issue a
writ of mandamus to the respondents to revise the schedule of rates (in short 'SOR') of the 'SBD' so
as to make it GST compliant.
For purpose of narrating the case of the petitioners, this court has taken the facts from the writ
application being Patna High Court CWJC No.1452 of 2019 dt.05-07-2019 CWJC No. 3288/2019. A
counter affidavit has been filed in this writ application but it is only on behalf of the Executive
Engineer, Flood Control Division, Karhagola, Katihar, Bihar (respondent no.8). In his counter
affidavit he has stated hat so far as the work in the present writ application is concerned, it was
completed on 25.03.2018 for value of Rs. 5174.09147 Lakhs and no GST has been deducted from the
bill because the work was completed before implementation of the GST deduction at source. He has
further taken a plea that in terms of Clause 35(ii) & (iii) of the 'SBD' the petitioner has not given any
information regarding any extra tax being paid by him within a period of 30 days of the imposition
of any such further tax or levy and no record or evidence has been provided by the petitioner.
As stated above, in this case since only the Executive Engineer has filed the affidavit, therefore, in
order to take note of the stand of the Department of the Government, learned counsel for the State,
Mr. Vikash Kumar, Ms. Archana Meenakshee and Mr. Kumar Alok have taken this court through the
counter affidavit filed in Patna High Court CWJC No.1452 of 2019 dt.05-07-2019 CWJC No.
1452/2019 on behalf of respondent Nos. 6 to 9. In this case, the issues raised by the petitioner are
identical to the first writ application, however, it relates to an agreement which was executed after
01.07.2017 being 20/SBD-PMGSY of 2017-18 dated 28.08.2017 for a cost of Rs. 1,02,01,006.00
(rupees One Crore Two Lac One Thousand Six Only). Since the Module Bidding Document (in short
'MBD') in this case contains the same Clause 35 as appearing in the 'SBD', a similar contention has
been raised on behalf of the petitioners.
While answering the contentions raised on behalf of the petitioners, learned counsel for the State
has relied upon the counter affidavit filed on behalf of respondent nos. 6 to 9 in CWJC No.
1452/2019. It is stated that all the provisions of the 'SBD' are part and parcel of the agreement.
Clause 13.3 of the 'SBD' states that "All duties, taxes, royalties and other levies payable by the
Contractor under the Contract, or for any other cause, shall be included in the rates, prices and total
Bid price submitted by the Bidder." According to the respondents, the petitioner if had any objection
with regard to any of the provisions of Patna High Court CWJC No.1452 of 2019 dt.05-07-2019 the
agreement then he should have raised objection to the same at the time of execution of the
agreement itself but having signed the agreement and executed the same, the prayer of the
petitioner to direct the respondents to delete or add any Clause in the 'SBD'/ 'MBD' cannot be
entertained. It is, thus, submitted that the writ applications, as framed, are not maintainable and are
fit to be rejected.
As regards the implementation of the GST Act, the respondents have taken a stand that a Committee
of the Rural Works Department, Government of Bihar has examined it's implication in the light of
the guidelines issues by the National Rural Infrastructure Development Agency, Ministry of Rural

Development, Government of India vide Circular No. GO21(117)-3201/FA dated 06.06.2018
(Annexure 'C' to the counter affidavit). It is further stated that in accordance with the said Circular

of Bihar (in short 'BRRDA') has vide letter No. 1059 dated 05.12.2018 issued under the signature of

High Court CWJC No.1452 of 2019 dt.05-07-2019 specifically provides for additional payment
provision/clause. Since Annexure 'C' to the counter affidavit has been relied upon, this court thinks
it just and proper to reproduce Annexure 'C' as under: -

Value Added Tax (VAT), Additional Custom Duty (CVD) and special Additional Duty (SAD) apart
from Entry Tax and Octroi Charges etc.
2. The Standard Bidding Document (SBD) makes provisions about the taxes which directly relating
to Contract Value. It incorporates that whenever the tax structure is changed during the ongoing
contract and new law comes into force then the contractor has to be refunded the increased amount
of taxes, if any and similarly, recovery is to be made from the contractor if the taxes have decreased.
3. On request of various States, seeking clarifications of GST and issuance of guidelines for future
references, this office in consultation with Integrated Finance Division (IFD) of Ministry of Rural
Development (MoRD) has worked out comprehensive guidelines and categorized all the projects
under PMGSY into four different categories of A, B, C and D to enable the States to calculate
additional tax burden.
4. The adoption and the consequent implication of GST under PMGSY will be on the following
categories of works -
i. Works sanctioned, prior to 01.07.2017, under different phases of PMGSY and which are ongoing
i.e. subsisting contracts (including the delayed projects, beyond the original intended completion
date) under various stages of physical and financial progress (Category A) ii. Works sanctioned, after
01.07.2017, under different phases of PMGSY wherein GST has not been accounted for in the

original Patna High Court CWJC No.1452 of 2019 dt.05-07-2019 proposal/sanction and wherein
Tenders have been completed. (Category B).
iii. Works sanctioned, after 01.07.2017, under different phases of PMGSY wherein GST has not been
accounted for in the original proposal/sanction and for which tender process has not been initiated.
(Category C).
iv. All new works proposed and yet to be proposed i.e. works which are in the pipeline under
PMGSY. (Category D).
5. Following are the Guidelines suggested to be followed by all SRRDAs -
A. Category A i. The new Goods and Service Tax (GST) laws require that all invoices should show the
value of supply and GST separately, and the value of supply will therefore, include non-GST taxes,
which remain embedded in the input prices, such as taxes on petroleum products.
ii. The Project components under different major heads (like Earth, Sand, Aggregates, Steel,
Bitumen etc.) are to be intimated by the Contractor, checked and confirmed by the competent
authority.
iii. The major issue under GST regime is to identify the portion of the existing contract that will
come under GST. Therefore, there is a need to cull out GST component of the existing contracts (i.e.
the value of taxes subsumed under GST). iv. The benchmark date for this purpose will be 01.07.2017
i.e. GST will be applicable on the portion of the contracts that are being paid from 01.07.2017.
v. The value of the portion of the work not completed or not paid for as on 01.07.2017 shall be
divided into two components. a. Value of work including taxes and duties such as Customs Duty,
taxes on petroleum products and other non-VAT taxes that have not been subsumed into GST
should be worked out. b. the balance will be the value of taxes subsumed into GST such as Central
Excise Duty and VAT i.e. GST component. vi. Therefore, the value of subsumed taxes under GST
needs to be separated out from the contracted amount to arrive at the value of work.
vii. The key issue is to estimate the value of subsumed tax carefully and as accurately as possible. For
this purpose, an indicative Excel format is annexed for guidance. Model calculations are also
attached herewith and states may workout similarly for all the ongoing works. Excel sheet indicates
various project components which attract various types of taxes including ED, CST, VAT/WCT and
other taxes which were already in the contract price as per the original contract. The same format
can be used to compile the information for each ongoing project, taking into consideration the GST
input tax credit available for the project. The assessment of subsumed shall be submitted by the
contractor along with copies of invoices and statement of input taxes duly certified by a Chartered
Accountant. It is responsibility of the contractor to furnish correct details of the subsumed taxes.
viii. Once the value of work sanction and GST taxes are arrived, the employer may enter into
supplemental agreement with revised agreement value that will be original contracted value minus
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198039280/ 13
M/S. Jai Bhawani Construction vs The Union Of India And Ors on 5 July, 2019
the value of subsumed tax arrived as above plus GST of 12%, i.e., the cost of the subsumed taxes
factored in toe original Patna High Court CWJC No.1452 of 2019 dt.05-07-2019 contract value is
required to be deducted from the original contract price to arrive at the actual amount of "cost of the
project". ix. The GST law allows the ITC (Input Tax Credit) under the existing Acts (VAT etc) to be
carried forward under their Transitional Provisions. Therefore, Section 140 of the GST law in effect
allow credit of all subsumed taxes paid by a taxable person on his inputs, including the Central
Excise Duty embedded in the price of inputs.
x. Thus, the supplier gets ITC into the GST credit ledger through Transitional Provisions (including
both the VAT and Central Excise Duty paid on the inputs).
xi. The contractor while raising their bill and tax invoice post- GST, will now collect GST as indicated
above from the employer and will remit the same to the respective Government. The entire GST of
the supply will have to be finally borne by the employer. xii. The contractor will have to pay GST on
the value of work, which he will pay to the respective Government, partly using the ITC that
represents the taxes that he has already paid through the inputs, and partly using cash collected
from the procuring entity concerned.
xiii. Through this arrangement, the supplier also cannot claim to have incurred loss on account of
embedded taxes that has been paid on the inputs.
B. Category B i. The works sanctioned after 01.07.2017, may be treated upon status of their work, as
here under:
a. For works, which have been awarded and commenced on the field, action may be
initiated as detailed in the Category A above.
b. For works, which have been awarded but not commenced may also be treated as
above before commencement of the work.
ii. In cases, where tenders are initiated as per the existing SBD (Standard Bidding
Document) norms, there should be no change in the evaluation criteria for selection
of the bidders and bids shall be evaluated based on the criteria mentioned in the
tender documents. However, after identification of the lowest bidder, it must be
ensured that, all taxes subsumed under GST are carefully deducted to arrive at the
value of works under the GST law, and the agreements should provide for payment of
value of works plus applicable GST.
C. Category C i. In cases, where the sanctions have been obtained after 01.07.2017
and tenders are yet to be initiated, the rates to be quoted shall be exclusive of GST
and GST of 12% will be added to the value offered by the bidders separately.
ii. The SBD may be modified to the above extent. iii. The Bill of Quantities (BoQ) shall also reflect
prices offered by the bidder without GST and applicable GST separately.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198039280/ 14
M/S. Jai Bhawani Construction vs The Union Of India And Ors on 5 July, 2019
iv. The States shall work out the departmental cost of the work without GST for the purpose of
evaluation and comparison with rates offered by the bidders.
Patna High Court CWJC No.1452 of 2019 dt.05-07-2019 D. Category D i. In cases of all new works to
be proposed under PMGSY, the states shall prepare Schedule of Rate (SoR) after deducting the taxes
subsumed under GST.
ii. The Detailed Project Reports shall be prepared based on this revised SoR and the state may add
12% GST to cost of the work to arrive at the overall cost of the work.
iii. In all such cases approval of SoR may be obtained from NRRDA as per existing practice.
6. Revision of Cost The States shall work out the impact of GST for all the works individually for all
category of works indicated above and shall submit detailed proposals based on the same. Any cost
excess that may be required shall be borne by MoRD and the state in the existing Fund sharing
pattern of PMGSY as may be applicable to the State.
7. These instructions will not apply to cases were the proposals have been made with necessary GST
component for which no revision of cost is required or permitted.
8. This has concurrence of IFD, MoRD vide diary dated 28.05.2018.

course of argument, Ms. Archana Meenakshee has submitted that once Clause-vii of
the enclosure to Annexure 'D' is gone through it would be evident that the grievance
of the petitioner has been taken care of and now the only thing is required to be done
by the petitioner is to Patna High Court CWJC No.1452 of 2019 dt.05-07-2019 claim
the differential amount on account of 'GST' after filing of the GST return.
At this stage, Mr. Prabhat Ranjan, learned counsel for the petitioner has hasten to point out that on
perusal of Annexure 'D', it would appear that the Engineer-in-Chief, Rural Works Department,
Government of Bihar has forwarded the 'SOR' for approval to the State Level Committee of Schedule
of Rates in Road Construction Department, Government of Bihar, which is yet to be approved, but,
then learned counsel for the State, Ms. Archana Meenakshee submits that pursuant to Annexure 'D',
the 'SOR' has already been formulated. A copy of which has been placed before this court.
Learned counsel for the State has drawn attention of this court towards the statements made in
paragraph 11 & 12 of the counter affidavit, wherein it is stated that the 'GST' deduction by the
Executive Engineer are deposited with the 'GST' authorities on behalf of the petitioners and due
credit is given to the Contractors for the amount so deducted, therefore the petitioner can set off his
liabilities from tax credit and if refund is due on the basis of the return Patna High Court CWJC
No.1452 of 2019 dt.05-07-2019 filed it will be granted by the 'GST' authorities. It is submitted that
the grievance of the petitioner has, thus, already been redressed and in fact it is the petitioner who
has not taken an appropriate steps as per the provisions made in the preceeding paragraphs. It is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198039280/ 17
M/S. Jai Bhawani Construction vs The Union Of India And Ors on 5 July, 2019
also stated that the petitioners may contact the concerned Executive Engineer/ departmental
Authorities with his claim in accordance with the provisions made in this regard as any action or
proceeding for payment of differential amount cannot be initiated without presentation of the claim
by the petitioners.
On the last date when the matter was taken up for consideration this court recorded the submissions
of the parties in the following terms: -
A counter affidavit on behalf of the Building Construction Department has been filed
today. Let it be kept on the record.
Re.: CWJC No. 3288 of 2019 with analogous cases The matter has been heard again
for some time. Mr. Prabhat Ranjan, learned counsel for the petitioner as well as
learned counsel for the State namely, Vikash Kumar, Ms. Archana Meenakshee and
Mr. Kumar Alok all have participated in course of argument. Mr. Rajesh Kumar
Verma, learned Assistant Solicitor General on behalf of the Union of India is also
present.
Mr. Prabhat Ranjan, learned counsel for the Patna High Court CWJC No.1452 of
2019 dt.05-07-2019 petitioner has drawn attention of this court towards Annexure 'C'
to the counter affidavit filed on behalf of respondent nos. 6 to 9 to submit that in fact
the Government of India under Ministry of Rural Development has come out with a
guideline for implementation of Goods and Service Tax (in short the 'GST') in the
works contract matters. Annexure 'C' dated 06.06.2018 is the said guideline and
according to the same the States are obliged to work out the impact of GST for all the
works individually for all category of works which have been indicated in the said
guideline.
It is his submission that in fact what has been suggested in Clause 'viii' saying that
"once the value of work sanction and GST taxes are arrived, the employer may enter
into supplemental agreement with revised agreement value that will be original
contracted value minus the value of the subsumed tax arrived as above plus GST of
12%, i.e., the cost of the subsumed taxes factored in the contract value is required to
be deducted from the original contract price to arrive at the actual amount of "cost of
the project", is not being done by the State Government and in absence of the
supplemental agreement with revised contract value the present confusion is still
going on. He has also invited attention of this court towards paragraph '6' of the
guideline which talks of 'revision of cost'.
He has further submitted that instead of taking the exercise as suggested in Annexure
'C' the Commercial Taxes Department has come out with letter no. 2594 dated
25.07.2017 (Annexure 'E' series) which does not clarify the issue.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198039280/ 18
M/S. Jai Bhawani Construction vs The Union Of India And Ors on 5 July, 2019
Mr. Vikash Kumar, Ms. Archana Meenakshee and Mr. Kumar Alok, learned counsel
for the State has taken a stand based on the statements made in the counter affidavit
filed in CWJC No. 1452/2019. Paragraph 9, 10 & 11 of the counter affidavit have been
referred to and it is submitted that in fact there is no difficulty in redressal of the
grievance of the petitioner. It is submitted that in the cases where the contract work
has been executed after 01.07.2017 and the value to be paid comes to Rupees Two
Lakhs and Fifty Thousand and odd, in that case, the payment is to be made after
deduction of 1% CGST Patna High Court CWJC No.1452 of 2019 dt.05-07-2019 and
1% SGST with the supplier with effect from the date to be notified subsequently and
for that reason the Commercial Taxes Department, Government of Bihar has come
out with Notification dated
13.09.2018 published on 1st day of October, 2018. The said Notification is in terms of Section 51 of
the GST Act. As regards the reimbursement of tax liabilities arising due to enactment of GST Act, it
is stated that the said Act has elaborately dealt with the issue and directions have been issued to the
Executive Engineers to entertain the claim of the petitioner and other contractors in the light of the
aforesaid circulars and guidelines.
In course of argument, certain submissions have been made based on the Schedule of Rate (SOR).
Copy of the SOR is, however, not on the record, and, therefore, it has been agreed at the bar that
copy of the SOR showing the contract value arrived at in a work tendered prior to 01.07.2017
(pre-GST) and one SOR of the work tendered after 01.07.2017 (post-GST) be brought on record.
As prayed, let this matter be listed again on 5 th of July, 2019.
Learned counsel for the State Ms. Archana Meenakshee is requested to place on record a copy of the
SOR (pre-GST and post-GST) after obtaining the same from the department when the matter will be
further heard."
Today when the matters were called learned counsel for the State, Ms. Archana Meenakshee has
produced before this court the two bound volumes of the 'SOR', one is showing the rate analysis
prior to implementation of the 'GST' whereas another one contains the rate analysis after taking into
consideration the 'GST' after 1st of July, 2017. It is evident from the 'SOR', copy of Patna High Court
CWJC No.1452 of 2019 dt.05-07-2019 which has been brought before this court, that now the
implication of the 'GST' has been considered and after treating the effect of the 'GST' the total basic
rate applicable after coming into force of the 'GST' has been fixed. Learned counsel for the
petitioner(s) as well as State agree with formulation of the 'SOR' taking note of the effect of the 'GST'
now no issue remains with regard to the implications of the 'GST' on the contract works executed
subsequently i.e. after coming into force of the 'GST'.
Having heard learned counsel for the petitioner(s) in all these writ applications, learned respective
counsel for the State as also learned Assistant Solicitor General for the Union of India, this court
finds that initially when the writ application was filed the petitioner(s) had been complaining that
they were being burdened to pay the 'GST' in respect of the works allotted to them on the basis of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198039280/ 19
M/S. Jai Bhawani Construction vs The Union Of India And Ors on 5 July, 2019
the 'SOR' which did not take care of the implication of the 'GST'. The rate of 'GST' or any other issue
were not in question and learned counsel for the petitioners has reiterated before this court that his
grievance is limited to payability of the differential amount, if any, arising out of and by virtue of
Patna High Court CWJC No.1452 of 2019 dt.05-07-2019 implementation of the 'GST'. At this stage,
when Clause-vii of the minutes of the meeting held on 12.12.2018 which is part of Annexure 'D' to
the counter affidavit of the State respondents in CWJC No. 1452/2019 has been brought to the
notice of this court, and it has been shown that the grievance of the petitioners had in fact been
redressed, learned counsel for the petitioners has agreed at the bar that if Clause (vii) of the minutes
of the meeting of the Rural Works Department is followed by all other works department of the
Government of Bihar, the grievance of the petitioners shall be taken to have been redressed.
Learned counsel for the State are unanimous in their submission that the petitioners should not
have any doubt with regard to the decision as contained in Clause (vii) of the minutes of the meeting
of the Rural Works Department which has been enclosed with the letter as contained as contained in
Annexure 'D' to the counter affidavit of the State respondents based on which the 'SOR' has already
been revised.
In view of the above, this court is of the considered opinion that now nothing remains for Patna
High Court CWJC No.1452 of 2019 dt.05-07-2019 adjudication by this court as the grievance of the
petitioners as framed in these writ applications are to be taken to have been redressed.
These Writ Applications are, thus, disposed of in terms recorded hereinabove.
Let the bound copies of the 'SOR' (before GST and after GST) be kept on the record.
