[1] The petitioners in WP(C) No. 366 of 2023 and WP(C) No. 370 of 2023 have filed the present writ
petitions inter-alia challenging the notification or advertisement No. 01 of 2022 issued by the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/58679381/ 2
Mr. Nungleppamcha Lanleiba vs The State Of Manipur on 28 April, 2023
Manipur Public Service Commission (MPSC) vide No. 7/10/2022-MPSC(DR) dated 07.12.2022. By
the impugned notification No. 01 of 2022 dated 07.12.2022, MPSC invited application for the
Manipur Public Services Combined Competitive Preliminary Examination, 2022 under the Manipur
Public Services Combined Competitive Examination, 2022 for selecting to the main examination for
recruitment to 100 nos. of vacancies for appointment to Manipur Civil Service Grade II, Manipur
Police Service Grade II, Manipur Finance Service Grade III, Sub-Deputy Collector and Manipur
Secretariat Service Category VI.
[2] The petitioners are eligible candidates waiting to appear in the upcoming Manipur Civil Service
Combined Competitive Examination (in Page 3 short MCSCCE), 2022 and they came to know that
the MPSC is going to conduct the aforesaid examination with the same MPSC Examination Rules
2011 which has not been modified in accordance with the direction passed by this Hon'ble Court in
the order dated 18.10.2019 in WA No. 19 of 2017 and the other connected matters which attained
finality. In the aforesaid order, the Division Bench of this Court while setting aside the Manipur
Public Service Examination, 2016, the notification dated 07.04.2016 was quashed and the
appointment orders of the successful candidates were also quashed and directed to conduct MPSC
Examination afresh after due notice to the candidates.
[3] In the aforesaid order, the Division Bench of this Court suggested to make amendments in the
MPSC Examination Rules with respect to the discrepancies pointed out. The petitioners herein
apprehend that the ensuing examination to be held in pursuance to the notification dated
07.12.2022 will suffer from the same defects and irregularities as occurred in the quashed MPSC
Examination of 2016. In the writ petitions, the petitioners have pointed out lacuna in Rule 26 (A) of
the Manipur Public Service Commission (Procedure & Conduct of Business) Rules, 2011 as amended
on 22.06.2017, 04.06.2020, 14.06.2020 and 07.09.2020. Rule 26 (A) prescribes procedures to be
followed for conducting examination, evaluation of answer scripts and interview. It is stated that
recently concluded re-examination of MCSCCE Main Examination, 2016 (held in 2022) was
conducted by MPSC under the Examination Rules, 2011 and Page 4 several lapses, irregularities and
illegalities have arose. If examination under advertisement No. 1 of 2022 is to be conducted under
the same Rules, 2011 such illegalities, irregularities and manipulation would likely to occur.
[4] The prayer in the writ petitions being WP(C) No. 366 and 370 of 2023 are reproduced herein
below:

appropriately and suitably." [5] Mr. K. Kishan, learned counsel for the petitioners in WP(C) No. 370
of 2023, submits that MPSC has not made necessary Page 7 amendments in its Rule as directed by
the Division Bench of this Court in the order dated 18.10.2019 in a batch of petitions being WA No.
19 of 2017, etc. If the examination is conducted under the same defective Rule, it would likely to
repeat the illegalities and irregularities as happened in the quashed MPSC Main Examination, 2016.
He further points out that in the OMR Sheet used by the Manipur Public Service Commission, there
is no space for signature of the Supervisor of the examination and as such, there is scope for
manipulation. He prays that at least examination be postponed for one month so that all necessary
correction in the Rules as suggested by the Division Bench of this Court Court in WA No. 19 of 2017
and the connected matters can be made.
[6] Mrs. G. Pushpa, learned counsel for the petitioners in WP(C) No. 366 of 2023, adopts the
submission of Mr. K. Kishan, learned counsel for the petitioner in WP(C) No. 370 of 2023 and she
relies on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported as (2010) 13 SCC 586 at para 6 and 7
which held that adverse impact of lack of probity in discharge of functions of the Public Service
Commission would result in defect not only in the process of selection but also of the appointment
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/58679381/ 5
Mr. Nungleppamcha Lanleiba vs The State Of Manipur on 28 April, 2023
to the Public Offices which would affect the effectiveness of the administration. It is also submitted
that principle of public accountability and transparency in the functioning of an institution is
essential for its proper governance. It is prayed that the notification be set aside and the MPSC be
directed to Page 8 amend its Rules in terms of the direction passed by the Division Bench of this
Court in WA No. 19 of 2017 and the connected matters. [7] Mr. M. Rarry, learned counsel for the
MPSC, submits that the writ petitions are based on mere assumptions and conjectures that there
would be irregularities and illegalities in conduct of the examination and without any concrete
pleading in this regard, the petitioners are praying for quashing of the Manipur Public Service
Commission (Procedure and Conduct of Business) Rules, 2011 as amended on 22.05.2017,
04.05.2020, 14.08.2020 and 07.09.2020. The petitioners are not able to show any instances of
violation of any fundamental and legal rights of the candidates by the said Rules and he submits that
the writ petition is not maintainable. It is also pointed out that the common judgment and order
dated 18.10.2019 passed in WA No. 19 of 2017 and connected matters was challenged by the State
Government and the successful terminated candidates. The SLP No. 39519 of 2019 and connected
matters before the Hon'ble Supreme Court against the judgment and order dated 18.10.2019 passed
by the Division Bench of this Court in WA No. 19 of 2017 and other connected matters were
dismissed on 22.11.2019 by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. The Hon'ble Supreme Court did not find
any error in the report of the Commission appointed by this Court and directed the MPSC to hold
Main Examination afresh as early as possible. After this, the State Government and terminated
successful candidates filed 10 review petitions and by common judgement and order dated
17.12.2022 in Review Petition Nos. 3 Page 9 to 12 of 2020, the review petitions were dismissed by
the Division Bench of this Court. Against the order of Division Bench in review petitions, the State
Government and other preferred SLP (Civil) Diary No. 5680 of 2021, etc. before the Hon'ble
Supreme Court. Vide order dated 11.02.2022, the petition was disposed of directing the MPSC to
conduct the quashed Main Examination, 2016 afresh within 4 (four) months keeping the questions
of law open.
[7.1] Mr. M. Rarry, learned counsel for the MPSC, draws the attention of this Court that the
petitioners herein have not disclosed the common judgment and order dated 02.05.2022 passed by
a Single Judge of this Court in WP(C) No. 373, 375 and 378 of 2019 wherein the advertisement No. 1
of 2019 issued by the MPSC for recruitment of 72 posts of MCS, MPS, MFS, SDC and MSS was
challenged with a prayer to conduct the examination afresh after amending Manipur Public Service
Commission (Procedure and Conduct of Business) Rules, 2011 by complying directives of Single
Judge of this Court in the order dated 28.02.2017 passed in WP(C) No. 803 and 817 of 2016 and 60
of 2017. The grounds raised in the aforesaid writ petitions are similar to those raised in the present
writ petitions. Vide order dated 02.05.2022, Single Judge dismissed the writ petitions. It is stated
that the judgment and order dated 02.05.2022 has not been challenged and hence attained finality.
It is submitted that the present writ petitions are not maintainable as the question raised in the
present writ petitions are already settled by judgment Page 10 and order dated 02.05.2022 passed in
WP(C) 373 of 2019 and other connected matters. He prays that the writ petitions be rejected. [7.2]
Mr. M. Rarry, learned counsel for the MPSC, relies upon the judgment passed by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of State of Himachal Pradesh & Ors. vs. Satpal Saini reported as (2017) 11
SCC 42 which held that direction to enact/amend legislation cannot be issued since such power lies
on the exclusive domain of the legislation. He further submits that recently re-conducted Main
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/58679381/ 6
Mr. Nungleppamcha Lanleiba vs The State Of Manipur on 28 April, 2023
Examination, 2016 (2022) was conducted under the same Rules of 2011 as directed by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court. Hence, the matter cannot be agitated again. [8] Mr. H. Debendra, learned Dy. A.G.
for the State respondent, adopts the submission of Mr. M. Rarry, learned counsel for the MPSC and
prays that the writ petitions be rejected.
[9] We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the materials available on record.
[10] In the order dated 02.05.2022 in WP(C) No. 373 of 2019 and connected matters, the Single
Judge has discussed Rule 26 (A) of the MPSC (Procedure and Conduct of Business) Rules, 2011 and
held that the Rule has been amended and the grievances of the petitioners stand redressed. The
relevant portions are at para 59, 60, 61, 62, 63 & 64, which are reproduced herein below:
"59. As could be seen from the records and submissions of the learned Additional
Advocate General now the Rules of 2011 has been suitably amended and the amended
Rules will Page 11 take care of the competitive examination in question. The learned
Additional Advocate General has placed on record the amended rule regarding
procedure to be followed for conducting examination, evaluation and interview as
also the evaluation of answer scripts.
60. On a reading of the amended provisions, specifically, Rule 26(A) of the Rules of
2011, it is clear that the said provision deals with the procedure to be followed for
conducting the examination, evaluation and interview. In view of the above, this
Court is of the view that the respondents are to follow the procedure as laid down in
the Rules of 2011 while conducting the competitive examination. Further, this Court
is also of the view that now the Controller of Examinations has been appointed and
the grievance of the petitioners stands redressed.
61. In view of the final order of the Hon'ble Supreme Court dated 11.2.2022 passed in
SLP (Civil) Diary No.5680 of 2021 etc. batch, supra, this Court is of the view that now
the petitioners cannot raise the aforesaid arguments as narrated infra since the
Hon'ble Supreme Court directed the MPSC to conduct the main examination of
MCSCC (Main) Examination, 2016 afresh within a period of four months.
62. There is no dispute that now a responsible officer is holding the charge of
Controller of Examinations, MPSC. That apart, in view of the amendments made in
the Rules of 2011, the petitioners have no right to challenge the impugned
advertisement. Since the petitioners are aggrieved persons of the MCSCC (Main)
Examination 2016 and the petitioners and similarly situated persons have been
permitted to appear in Page 12 the main examination for MCSCCE 2016 to be
conducted pursuant to the order of the Hon'ble Supreme Court dated 11.2.2022, now
they have no right to challenge the impugned advertisement dated 8.1.2019.
63. In the light of the aforesaid discussions, this Court is of the view that the
petitioners are not entitled to get the relief sought for in the writ petitions, as their
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/58679381/ 7
Mr. Nungleppamcha Lanleiba vs The State Of Manipur on 28 April, 2023
grievances have been considered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court while passing the
order dated 11.2.2022."
[11] MPSC issued an Advertisement No. 1 of 2019 dated 08.01.2019 for recruitment of civil servants
and the said notification was challenged by some of the aspirants by way of writ petitions being
WP(C) Nos. 373 of 2019, 375 of 2019 and 378 of 2019 inter-alia on the grounds that the notification
was issued without fully complying the directions of the Single Judge in order dated 28.02.2017
passed in WP(C) Nos. 803 of 2016, 817 of 2016 and 60 of 2017. Vide order dated 10.05.2019, this
Court stayed the process of the conduct of the examination as notified by Advt. No. 1 of 2019.
[12] Vide common judgment and order dated 02.05.2022 in WP(C) Nos. 373 of 2019, 375 of 2019
and 378 of 2019, Single Judge dismissed the writ petitions by holding that amended Rule 26 (A) of
the Rules of 2011 would take care of grievance of the petitioners and the Controller of Examination
was also appointed. It was also observed that the matter attained finality as Hon'ble Supreme Court
disposed of all the matters in this regard. Accordingly, MPSC was directed to conduct the
examination as Page 13 per Advt. No. 1 of 2019 in terms of the amended Rules of 2011. The order
dated 02.05.2022 has not been challenged and has attained finality. GENESIS OF THE EVENTS IN
GIST:
[13] In the first batch of petitions challenging the manner in which the conduct of the
MCSCCE Main Examination 2016 in WP(C) Nos. 803 of 2016 and 817 of 2016 filed
by some of the unsuccessful candidates and WP(C) No. 60 of 2017 questioning the
finding of the Court Appointed Enquiry Commission, Single Judge, vide common
judgment and order dated 28.02.2017, rejected the prayer for cancellation of the
MCCS Main Examination 2016. While dismissing the writ petitions, Single Judge
pointed out certain lacunae in the Manipur Public Service Commission (Procedure &
Conduct of Business) Rules, 2011 specially with respect to Rule 26A and Rule 26B
and in para 68 directed MPSC "...to do the needful in terms of the observations and
directions made, more particularly in the preceding paragraphs no. 55 to 62 as
regards codification, evaluation and other matters by laying down the
guidelines/instruction so that such allegations and irregularities which form the
cause of actions for filing these writ petitions are avoided in future and to ensure
credibility of the examination system conducted by the Manipur Public Service
Commission, which exercise has to be carried out by the MPSC before holding the
next Manipur Civil Services Combined Competitive Examination and by making
amendments in the Manipur Public Service Commission (Procedure and Conduct of
Business) Rules, 2011, wherever necessary". It may be noted Page 14 that in these
batch of writ petitions, Single Judge constituted an Enquiry Commission which
conducted a partial enquiry on the answer sheets and did not find any patent
irregularity and accordingly, the writ petitions were dismissed.
[14] The common judgment and order dated 28.02.2017 passed by the learned Single
Judge in WP(C) No. 803 of 2016 and connected matters was challenged before the
Division Bench by way of writ appeals being WA Nos. 19 of 2017 and 29 of 2017.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/58679381/ 8
Mr. Nungleppamcha Lanleiba vs The State Of Manipur on 28 April, 2023
These writ appeals were tagged together with a batch of writ petitions being WP(C)
Nos. 606 of 2017, 727 of 2017 & 313 of 2018 inter-alia praying for quashing the
MCSCCE Main Examination 2016 due to malpractices and irregularities committed
in the conduct of the examination. The Division Bench constituted a 2 Member
Commission and directed to examine all the answer scripts and after thorough
investigation, the Commission found certain irregularities in the conduct of Main
Examination 2016. On the basis of the report submitted by the Commission, vide
common judgment and order dated 18.10.2019, Division Bench set aside the
judgment and order dated 28.02.2017 passed by the learned Single Judge in WP(C)
Nos. 803 of 2016, 817 of 2016 and 60 of 2017 and allowed WP(C) Nos. 606 of 2017,
725 of 2017 and 313 of 2018. Consequently, the MCCS Main Examination 2016 was
quashed and the appointment orders of the successful candidates were also quashed
and set aside. In para 22, the Division Bench pointed out certain Page 15 drawbacks
in the rules and conduct of the examination. However, no definite direction was
issued in this regard.
[15] The terminated successful candidates of Main Examination 2016 and State Government
challenged the judgment and order dated 18.10.2019 passed by the Division Bench quashing the
examination and appointment orders issued in pursuant to the result before the Hon'ble Supreme
Court by way of SLP(C) Diary No. 39519 of 2019 and connected matters. Vide order dated
22.11.2019, Hon'ble Supreme Court, while dismissing the Special Leave Petitions, did not find any
infirmities in the order of the Division Bench as the same was based on a finding of the Commission
after 'thorough investigation in transparent manner'. It was directed to hold main examination
afresh as early as possible. [16] After dismissal of the SLPs and on discovery of certain new facts,
some of the terminated successful candidates and State Government preferred 10 review petitions
being RP Nos. 3 to 12 of 2020 against judgement order dated 18.10.2019 passed by the Division
Bench quashing the Main Examination 2016 and appointment orders. Vide order dated 17.12.2020,
the Division Bench dismissed the review petitions and the common order in review petitions was
challenged before the Hon'ble Supreme Court by way of SLP (C) Diary No. 5680 of 2021 and
connected matters. Vide order dated 11.02.2022, Hon'ble Supreme Court disposed of the batch of
Special Leave Petitions with a direction to MPSC to conduct Page 16 MCCS Main Examination 2016
afresh within 4 months leaving the questions raised left open.
[17] Thereafter the MCSCCE Main Examination 2016 was re- conducted in 2022 and appointment
orders were issued to the successful candidates on the basis of the result declared in the
re-conducted examination.
[18] MPSC issued an Advertisement No. 1 of 2019 dated 08.01.2019 for recruitment of civil servants
and the said notification was challenged by some of the aspirants by way of writ petitions being
WP(C) Nos. 373 of 2019, 375 of 2019 and 378 of 2019 inter-alia on the grounds that the notification

Mr. Nungleppamcha Lanleiba vs The State Of Manipur on 28 April, 2023
[19] Vide common judgment and order dated 02.05.2022 in WP(C) Nos. 373 of 2019, 375 of 2019
and 378 of 2019, Single Judge dismissed the writ petitions by holding that amended Rule 26A of the
Rules of 2011 would take care of grievance of the petitioners and the Controller of Examination was
also appointed. It was also observed that the matter attained finality as Hon'ble Supreme Court
disposed of all the matters in this regard. Accordingly, MPSC was directed to conduct the
examination as Page 17 per Advt. No. 1 of 2019 in terms of the amended Rules of 2011. The order
dated 02.05.2022 has not been challenged and has attained finality. [20] Some of the aspirants filed
another writ petition being WP(C) No. 312 of 2022 on 02.05.2022 [on the day when WP(C) Nos. 373
of 2019, 375 of 2019 and 378 of 2019 were dismissed by common judgment and order dated
02.05.2022 by Single Judge rejecting prayer for amendment in Rules of 2011] before this Court
inter-alia praying for quashing/amending the Rules of 2011 and for conducting the proposed Main
Examination 2016(2022) by UPSC or any other State Public Service Commission so as to avoid
irregularities, illegalities and manipulation cropped up in the conduct of the examination. Vide
order dated 11.05.2022, a Division Bench of this Court observed that after the Division Bench
judgment dated 18.10.2019 in WA No. 19 of 2017 & batch and judgment dated 17.12.2020 in Review
Petition No. 3 of 2020 & batch, the matters attained finality and advised the MPSC to be mindful of
the observations and findings arrived earlier.
[21] After the completion of re-conducted Main Examination 2016(2022), an application being
MC(WP(C)) No. 33 of 2023 was filed in WP(C) No. 312 of 2022, inter-alia, to amend prayer for
quashing the re- conducted Main Examination 2016(2022) as the same was held without complying
the directions of this Courts as mentioned above. Vide order dated 13.03.2023, a Division Bench of
this Court rejected the application for amendment as it would create a new cause of action and
would change Page 18 the nature of the case. It was observed that the matter regarding Rules of 2011
attained finality after final judgment and order dated 22.05.2022 passed by Single Judge in WP(C)
Nos. 373 of 2019, 375 of 2019 & 378 of 2019.
[22] Only after the dismissal of application being MC(WP(C)) No. 33 of 2023 on 13.03.2023, the
present writ petitions, ie, WP(C) Nos. 366 of 2023 and 370 of 2023 were filed on 19.04.2023 and
20.04.2023 by new set of petitioners through the same counsel who have conducted the case on
behalf of some of the unsuccessful candidates in the Main Examination 2016, raising the same
issues which have attained finality. It may be noted that Mr. K. Kishan, learned counsel for the
petitioners in WP(C) No. 370 of 2023, was one of the petitioners/appellants in the earlier round of
litigations, i.e., in WP(C) Nos. 803 of 2016; 60 of 2017; 312 of 2019 and in WA No. 19 of 2017.
Similarly, Smt. G. Puspa, learned counsel for the petitioners in WP(C) No. 366 of 2023 appeared in
all these matters on behalf of some of the aspirants/unsuccessful candidates in Main Examination
2016 and in subsequent petitions seeking relief for quashing/amending the Rules of 2011.
FINDINGS AND REASONS THEREOF:
[23] In the present writ petitions, it is quite evident that the same have been filed on
mere presumptions, assumptions and conjectures that irregularities, illegalities,
fabrication, etc. would likely to happen in the proposed MCSCCE, 2022, as occurred
in the Main Examination 2016.

Mr. Nungleppamcha Lanleiba vs The State Of Manipur on 28 April, 2023
Page 19 Another writ petition being WP(C) No. 312 of 2019 was also pending inter-
alia praying for quashing the Rules of 2011 and for handing over conduct of
examination to UPSC or some other authority. The reliefs prayed for in all these
petitions are substantially same.
[24] The question of the validity of the Rules of 2011 has already been settled by the
judgment and order dated 02.05.2022 passed by Single Judge of this Court in WP(C)
Nos. 373 of 2019, 375 of 2019 & 378 of 2019. As this order is not challenged, the
finding attains finality. By the present writ petitions filed by another set of new
petitioners, the issues which have attained finality are being re-agitated before this
Court. The plea of the petitioners that they are not parties in the earlier round of
litigations does not hold good when one of the petitioners in the earlier litigations
and one of the counsel are the counsel in the present cases. [25] It will be apt to refer
to the settled proposition of law that an advocate is an officer of the court and has to
assist in finding the truth. In the case of D.P. Chadha v. Triyugi Narain Mishra,
(2001) 2 SCC 221, Hon'ble Supreme Court held in para 26 as follow:
"26. A lawyer must not hesitate in telling the court the correct position of law when it
is undisputed and admits of no exception. A view of the law settled by the ruling of a
superior court or a binding precedent even if it does not serve the cause of his client,
must be brought to the notice of court unhesitatingly. This obligation of a counsel
flows from the confidence reposed by the court in the counsel appearing for any of
the two sides. A counsel, being an officer of court, shall apprise the Judge with the
correct position of law whether for or against either party."
Page 20 [26] It is the settled principle of law that there should be an end to litigation. In the case of
State of Haryana v. State of Punjab, (2004) 12 SCC 673 at Para 68, Hon'ble Supreme Court held that
the doctrine of resjudicata is fundamental to the administration of justice in all courts that there
must be an to litigation and it is applicable to writ proceedings also. Relevant para is reproduced
below as:
"68. The doctrine of res judicata and Order 32 Rule 2 are not technical rules of
procedure and are fundamental to the administration of justice in all courts that
there must be an end to litigation. Thus, when this Court was called upon in Daryao
v. State of U.P.19 to hold that res judicata could not apply in connection with
proceedings before this Court under Article 32 because of the extraordinary nature of
the jurisdiction, it was said:
(AIR pp. 1461-62, para 9) "9. But, is the rule of res judicata merely a technical rule or
is it based on high public policy? If the rule of res judicata itself embodies a principle
of public policy which in turn is an essential part of the rule of law then the objection
that the rule cannot be invoked where fundamental rights are in question may lose
much of its validity. Now, the rule of res judicata as indicated in Section 11 of the
Code of Civil Procedure has no doubt some technical aspects, for instance the rule of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/58679381/ 11
Mr. Nungleppamcha Lanleiba vs The State Of Manipur on 28 April, 2023
constructive res judicata may be said to be technical; but the basis on which the said
rule rests is founded on considerations of public policy. It is in the interest of the
public at large that a finality should attach to the binding decisions pronounced by
courts of competent jurisdiction, and it is also in the public interest that individuals
should not be vexed twice over with the same kind of litigation. If these two
principles form the foundation of the general rule of res judicata they cannot be
treated as irrelevant or inadmissible even in dealing with fundamental rights in
petitions filed under Article 32."
"The binding character of judgments pronounced by courts of competent jurisdiction
is itself an essential part of the rule of Page 21 law, and the rule of law obviously is the
basis of the administration of justice on which the Constitution lays so much
emphasis."20

20. Ibid., at SCR p. 584 : AIR p. 1462, para 11.
[27] In the circumstances, the writ petitions are devoid of merits: (i) as the same are
based on presumptions; (ii) the issues raised herein have already been settled in the
judgment and order dated 02.05.2022 passed by a Single Judge Bench of this Court
in WP(C) Nos. 373 of 2019, 375 of 2019 & 378 of 2019; (iii) the same have been filed
after rejecting the application for amendment of WP(C) No. 312 of 2019 vide order
dated 13.03.2022 passed by a Division Bench of this Court in MC(WP(C)) No. 33 of
2023; and (iv) non-disclosure by the learned counsel for the petitioners of the issues
already settled by this Court in the writ petitions. Accordingly, the writ petitions are
dismissed. No cost.
[28] However, to allay the fear and suspicion of the petitioners, this Court directs the
Manipur Public Service Commission to make the supervisors to sign on the left
margin on the OMR sheet, irrespective of the fact that space is provided or not for
such signature.
