Mary 2.1 The said lands were acquired for the purpose of providing High Level
Channel Scheme for irrigation linking 26 tanks in Madurantakkam and Cheyyur
Taluk of Kancheepuram District. In pursuant to the same,
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis notification was issued under Section 4(1) of the
Land Acquisition Act, 1894 in GO.Ms.No.1413 Public Works Department dated
05.09.1988 proposing to acquire the lands admeasuring 7.03.0 hectres. Enquiry
under Section 5A of the said Act was conducted on 22.11.1988 and award was passed
in Award no.9 of 1991 dated 20.09.1991 thereby determining the compensation at the
rate of Rs.45/- per cent. On objection, it was referred under Section 18 of the said Act
in LAOP and enhanced the compensation to Rs.700/- per cent. The judgment and
decree was also challenged by the second respondent before this Court by way of
appeal suits and the appeal suits were dismissed and even then, the petitioners were
not paid compensation and no amount has been deposited even till today. Insofar as
possession is concerned, already taken over and the entire scheme has been
completed. Now it is functioning as High Level Channel Scheme for irrigation linking
26 tanks in Madurantakkam and Cheyyur Taluk of Kancheepuram District. That
apart, this writ petition has been filed after period of twenty five years from the date
of award. However, the learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that so far the
respondents have not deposited any compensation.

3. In this regard, it is relevant to rely upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India
reported in (2020) 8 SCC 129 in the case of Indore Development Authority Vs. Manoharlal and ors
etc., wherein it is held as follows :-
“366. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we answer the questions as under:
1. Under the provisions of Section 24(1)(a) in case the award is not made as on
1.1.2014 the date of commencement of Act of 2013, there is no lapse of proceedings.
Compensation has to be determined under the provisions of Act of 2013.
2. In case the award has been passed within the window period of five years excluding
the period covered by an interim order of the court, then proceedings shall continue
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/114237380/ 3
C.Ranganathan vs The Collector on 29 November, 2021
as provided under Section 24(1)(b) of the Act of 2013 under the Act of 1894 as if it
has not been repealed.
3. The word or used in Section 24(2) between possession and compensation has to be
read as nor or as and. The deemed lapse of land acquisition proceedings under
Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis takes place where
due to inaction of authorities for five years or more prior to commencement of the
said Act, the possession of land has not been taken nor compensation has been paid.
In other words, in case possession has been taken, compensation has not been paid
then there is no lapse. Similarly, if compensation has been paid, possession has not
been taken then there is no lapse.
4. The expression 'paid' in the main part of Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 does not
include a deposit of compensation in court. The consequence of non-deposit is
provided in proviso to Section 24(2) in case it has not been deposited with respect to
majority of land holdings then all beneficiaries (landowners) as on the date of
notification for land acquisition under Section 4 of the Act of 1894 shall be entitled to
compensation in accordance with the provisions of the Act of 2013. In case the
obligation under Section 31 of the Land Acquisition Act of 1894 has not been fulfilled,
interest under Section 34 of the said Act can be granted. Non-deposit of
compensation (in court) does not result in the lapse of land acquisition proceedings.
In case of non-
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis deposit with respect to the majority of holdings for five years or
more, compensation under the Act of 2013 has to be paid to the "landowners" as on the date of
notification for land acquisition under Section 4 of the Act of 1894.
5. In case a person has been tendered the compensation as provided under Section 31(1) of the Act
of 1894, it is not open to him to claim that acquisition has lapsed under Section 24(2) due to
non-payment or non-deposit of compensation in court. The obligation to pay is complete by
tendering the amount under Section 31(1). Land owners who had refused to accept compensation or
who sought reference for higher compensation, cannot claim that the acquisition proceedings had
lapsed under Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013.
6. The proviso to Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 is to be treated as part of Section 24(2) not part of
Section 24(1)(b).
7. The mode of taking possession under the Act of 1894 and as contemplated under Section 24(2) is
by drawing of inquest report/ memorandum. Once award has been passed on taking possession
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis under Section 16 of the Act of 1894, the land vests in State there is
no divesting provided under Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013, as once possession has been taken
there is no lapse under Section 24(2).

C.Ranganathan vs The Collector on 29 November, 2021
8. The provisions of Section 24(2) providing for a deemed lapse of proceedings are applicable in case
authorities have failed due to their inaction to take possession and pay compensation for five years
or more before the Act of 2013 came into force, in a proceeding for land acquisition pending with
concerned authority as on 1.1.2014. The period of subsistence of interim orders passed by court has
to be excluded in the computation of five years.
9. Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 does not give rise to new cause of action to question the legality of
concluded proceedings of land acquisition. Section 24 applies to a proceeding pending on the date of
enforcement of the Act of 2013, i.e., 1.1.2014. It does not revive stale and time-barred claims and
does not reopen concluded proceedings nor allow landowners to question the legality of mode of
taking possession to reopen https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis proceedings or mode of deposit of
compensation in the treasury instead of court to invalidate acquisition.”
4. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India settled all proposition of law in the above judgment
including the grounds raised by the petitioners. Insofar as possession is concerned, already taken
over and the entire scheme has been completed. Now it is functioning as High Level Channel
Scheme for irrigation linking 26 tanks in Madurantakkam and Cheyyur Taluk of Kancheepuram
District. In view of the dictum laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, the issues raised by
the petitioners were settled and therefore, the acquisition proceedings have not been lapsed by
operation of law under Section 24 (2) of the new Act i.e., Right to Fair Compensation and
Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013. In view of the settled
position of law, the writ petition is devoid of merits and liable to be dismissed.
5. Accordingly, this writ petition is dismissed. However, the petitioners are at liberty to execute the
judgment and decree passed by this https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Court in the manner known
to law. Further, the learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that so far the respondents have
not deposited any compensation. Therefore, if the respondents have not deposited the
compensation amount even till today, the petitioners are entitled for compensation under the new
Act, i.e. Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and
Resettlement Act, 2013. Consequently, connected miscellaneous petition is closed. No order as to
costs.
