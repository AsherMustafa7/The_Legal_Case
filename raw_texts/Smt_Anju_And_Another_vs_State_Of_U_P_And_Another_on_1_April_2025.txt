Learned counsel for the applicant states that a case under Section 13 B of the Hindu
Marriage Act is pending before the Principal Judge, Family Court, Meerut as
Matrimonial Case No. 1353 of 2022. Learned counsel assures that the applicant shall
abide by all the terms and conditions of settlement agreement arrived at between the
parties before the mediation centre of this Court and shall fully co-operate with

given.
The law with regards to quashing of a case on the basis of settlement arrived between

another: (2017) 9 SCC 641 has held that the cases in which the parties have settled
their grievances can be quashed.
From perusal of the records and the law laid down by the Apex Court on the subject
matter, the present case is a good case for exercising powers by this Court to quash
the proceedings as prayed for by the applicant(s).
The present application is allowed.
The entire proceedings of the aforesaid case as well as charge sheet dated 20.9.2020
and cognizance order dated 13.10.2020 in the aforesaid case are hereby quashed.

production of certified copy of this order.

6. In view of the afore-quoted order passed by in Criminal Misc. Application U/s 482 No. 18374 of
