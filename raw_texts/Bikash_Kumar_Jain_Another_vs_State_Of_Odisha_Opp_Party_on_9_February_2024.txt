S.S. Mishra, J.
1. An FIR No. 212 dated 19.05.2018 in UPD, Bhubaneswar Capital Police Station was registered
against many accused persons under Sections 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act,
1956. The present petitioners were also named in the FIR. The allegations against the petitioners in
the FIR in precise were that being the customers, they were availing services from a Spa Centre.
Under the guise of running a Spa Centre, a brothel is being run from the same place. One Surendra
Kumar Mohapatra under the managership of Sanjay Kumar Rana was running the Spa in the name
and style of "H2O Spa And Hamam". It is alleged that they procure the girls and using them for
prostitution. On 19.05.2018 a raid was conducted by the Police, eight young girls were found inside
the Spa, out of them seven girls were found to have been doing sexual activities with seven persons.
They were found in a compromising position. It is alleged that the present petitioners were also
engaged in sexual activities with two girls. All the girls were confronted. They stated that Rs. 2,000
each has been charged for giving sexual favour to the clients by the Manager of the Spa. The girls
disclosed their identities. On verification of the passports and visa, it was ascertained that all these

Bikash Kumar Jain & Another vs State Of Odisha ....... Opp. Party on 9 February, 2024
girls were from Thailand. The FIR indicates that the girls were of the age range from 27 to
35. The passports of the girls were confiscated, and they were subjected to investigation and were let
off.
2. After the investigation, the Police have filed the charge sheet on 17.06.2021. In the charge sheet
apart from the offences under Sections 3,4,5,6 and 7 of Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act,1956, two
more higher offences are added i.e. the offences under Sections 370(3) and 370A (2) IPC. Relevant
would be reproduced the provisions: -
"Section-370. Trafficking of person-
(1)xxxxxx (2)xxxxxx (3) Where offence involves the trafficking of more than one
person, it shall be punishable with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not
be less than ten years but which may extend to imprisonment for life, and shall also
be liable to fine.
(4)xxxxxx (5)xxxxxx (6)xxxxxx (7)xxxxxx Section-370(A).Exploitation of a trafficked
person.-
(1)xxxxxx (2) Whoever, knowingly by or having reason to believe that a person has
been trafficked, engages such person for sexual exploitation in any manner, shall be
punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than three
years, but which may extend to five years, and shall also be liable to fine."
3. Perusal of Section 370A (2) of the Act indicates that whoever knowingly by or having reason to
believe that a person having trafficked, engaged such person for sexual exploitation in any manner
shall be punished with the imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than three years but
which may extend to five years and shall also be liable for fine. However, the issue as to whether the
customer has the knowledge that the person/women is trafficked or engaged for sexual exploitation
needs to be adduced from the material on record. In the light of the aforementioned provisions the
allegation against the petitioners in the charge sheet is analyzed in the succeeding paragraphs.
4. The petitioners are primarily aggrieved by the addition of aggravated/higher offences under
Sections 370(3) and 370A (2) of IPC.
5. Mr. Amit Bose learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the addition of aforementioned
two offences and taking cognizance for the said offences by the trial Court is misplaced under law.
The petitioners are neither the owner of the Spa nor the Managers, rather they were the customers.
They had no clue regarding the identity of the victim girls. Equally they are not aware and there was
no occasion for them to inquire or know the age of the girls providing services in the Spa. From the
allegations made in the FIR and the charge sheet, even if the allegations are taken at its face value,
no offences under the aforementioned aggravated provisions of law are attracted qua them.

Bikash Kumar Jain & Another vs State Of Odisha ....... Opp. Party on 9 February, 2024
6. Perusal of the statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C. of various witnesses placed on record also
indicates that the petitioners are indeed the customers. They had no role to play insofar as running
the Spa is concerned or for that matter, they are not the owner of the Spa.
7. Mr. Ragada, learned counsel appears for the State submits that the Court below has rightly taken
cognizance of the offences under Sections 370(3) and 370A(2) of IPC apart from the other offences.
When similarly situated accused person approach this Court for quashing of the cognizance order
against him, the coordinate Bench vide its order dated 01.09.2023 in CRLMC No. 3384 of 2023 has
been pleased to record as under.
"3. The petitioner was on bail. Subsequently, on charge sheet being submitted the
offence under Section 370(A)(2) of IPC was added. He therefore, apprehends that he
may be taken to custody on his appearance.
4. In this context, the ratio decided in Pradeep Ram v. State of Jharkhand, reported
in (2019) 17 SCC 326 is relevant since higher offence has been added. It is necessary
for the petitioner to appear before the Court below and to move for continuance of
the bail. It is further submitted that the offence under Section 370(A)(2) of IPC is not
made out as against the petitioner because he is not the owner of the building in
which the prostitution was allegedly carried out.
5. In such view of the matter, the CRLMC is disposed of granting liberty to the
petitioner to appear before the Court below within a week and to make a motion for
bail, which shall be considered on its own merit as also having due regard to the fact
that he was on bail earlier and that he claims not to be the owner of the building in
question, for which the 370(A)(2) of IPC would not be prima facie attracted."
8. The State counsel contended that the coordinate Bench has already taken a prima facie view that
against the similarly situated accused offence under Section 370A(2) of IPC is made out. Therefore,
no interference in the present case is called for. He further opposes the prayer of the petitioners
relying upon a judgment of Telangana High Court passed in Mohammad Riyaz vrs State of
Telangana in Criminal Petition No. 5803 of 2018. He submits that in the similar circumstances
when a customer challenged the order of taking cognizance of offence under Section 370A(2) of IPC,
the High Court has declined to grant relief and formed the view that every customer in such
situation would be treated to have employed the trafficked girls exploited sexually, therefore, the
offence under Section 370A(2) is attracted. He supplies emphasis to certain paragraph of the
judgment, which reads as under: -
****************** Learned Public Prosecutor for the State of Telangana supported
the case while contending that in view of the judgment of this Court rendered in
"S.Naveen Kumar @ Naveen v. State of Telangana1" the customer is also liable to be
prosecuted for the offences punishable under Sections 370, 370 (A) (2) of I.P.C. and
under Sections 3 to 5 of Prevention of Immoral Traffic Act. ****************** In
view of Section 370 A (2) of I.P.C., the petitioner, who was found along with a sex
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/89360095/ 3
Bikash Kumar Jain & Another vs State Of Odisha ....... Opp. Party on 9 February, 2024
worker in a room, is liable to be prosecuted for the offence punishable under Section
370 (A) (2) of I.P.C.
This Court in "S.Naveen Kumar @ Naveen v. State of Telangana" and "Sahil Patel v.
The State of A.P." (referred supra), consistently held that the customer is also liable
to be prosecuted for the offence punishable under Section 370-A of I.P.C.
The same view is also expressed by the High Court of Gujarat at Ahmedabad in "Vinod v. State of
Gujarat" (referred supra), which is as follows:
"b) However, that is not end of the matter. A perusal of the charge sheet would show
that the police while charge sheeting A1 and A2 for the offences under Sections 3, 4, 5
and 6 of PIT Act and under Section 370A IPC, HC-NIC 01:34:48 IST 2017
surprisingly charge sheeted petitioner/A3 only under Section 4 of PIT Act, but not
under Section 370A IPC. Section 370A IPC reads thus: Section 370A - Exploitation of
a trafficked person (1) Whoever, knowingly or having reason to believe that a minor
has been trafficked, engages such minor for sexual exploitation in any manner, shall
be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than five
years, but which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine. (2)
Whoever, knowingly by or having reason to believe that a person has been trafficked,
engages such person for sexual exploitation in any manner, shall be punished with
rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than three years, but which
may extend to five years, and shall also be liable to fine. c) The phraseology engages
such minor/such person for sexual exploitation in any manner employed in sub-
sections (1) and (2) of Section 370A IPC in clear terms indicates that the flesh
customer who hires the victim woman for sexual exploitation also falls within the fold
of Section 370A as an offender.
d) It shall be noted that in the wake of gang rape of Nirbhaya in Delhi which arose an
unprecedent public furore, Government MSM,J Crl.P_5803_2018 8 considered it fit
to drastically amend several provisions of IPC and in that direction appointed a
Committee under the Chairmanship of late Justice J.S.Verma, the former Chief
Justice of India.
The Committee after interacting cross sections of stake holders submitted its detailed report
suggesting amendments and introduction of various provisions in penal laws like IPC, Cr.P.C.,
Evidence Act etc. Consequent upon the said report sub-clause (2) of Section 370 IPC was amended
and Section 370A IPC was introduced. Having regard to the avowed object with which report was
submitted and amendments and new provisions were introduced in several acts, it cannot be
presumed for the moment that Legislators considered customer as an innocent victim in the flesh
trade. Therefore, Section 370A takes in its fold the customer also. So, despite the police charge
sheeting petitioner/A3 only for the offence HC-NIC Page 23 of 24 Created On Sat May 06 01:34:48
IST 2017under Section 4 of PIT Act and the Committal Court accepting the same, it is evident from
the charge sheet that the petitioner/A3 is prima facie liable for charge under Section 370A though
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/89360095/ 4
Bikash Kumar Jain & Another vs State Of Odisha ....... Opp. Party on 9 February, 2024
not under Section 4 of PIT Act with which he was charge sheeted."
***************** In view of the law declared by the Single Judge of this Court and reiterated by the
other Courts and the judgments referred supra, the customer is liable to be prosecuted for the
offence punishable under Section 370 A (2) of I.P.C.
9. Per contra, the learned Counsel for the petitioners relies upon the judgment in the case of
Pradeeban vrs State By Ashoknagar P.S. in CRL.P No. 10222/2017, the Karnataka High Court
confronted with the similar case has held as under.
"4. It is also evident from reading of the above said provisions, which are invoked in
this particular case. Section 370A(2) of IPC provides-Whoever, knowingly by or
having reason to believe that a person has been trafficked, engages such person for
sexual exploitation in any manner, shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for
a term which shall not be less than three years, but which may extend to five years,
and shall also be liable to fine. Section 370(3) of IPC provides where the offence
involves the trafficking of more than one person, it shall be punishable with rigorous
imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than ten years, but which may
extend to imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to fine. Further, Section 294
of IPC provides Obscene acts and songs - Whoever, to the annoyance of others (a)
does any obscene act in any public place, or (b) sings, recites or utters may obscene
song, balled or words, in or near any public place, shall be punished with
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three months, or
with fine, or with both.
Therefore, the above said provisions are in no way attract for punishment so far as
the customers are concerned. Though it is felt by this Court though customers
virtually encourage prostitution and exploit the victim for money, but in the absence
of any specific penal provision, it cannot be said that is liable for any prosecution for
the above said offences."
10. I have perused the entire record including the statements of the witnesses under Section 161
Cr.P.C. It is found from the record that all the alleged victim girls those who are apprehended from
the spot are foreigners namely from Thailand. All of them were adults. They were deported from the
country. Surprisingly, statements of none of the victim girls are recorded by the police U/s 161 of
Cr.P.C. They are also not cited as witnesses to the prosecution case. Therefore, the allegation that
the girls were trafficked and thereafter sexually exploited is a matter found mentioning in the
narration of the charge sheet but there is no evidence collected and placed before the Court. In the
absence of such evidence likely to come on record, securing conviction against the petitioners is
impossible.
11. Taking the allegations at its face value no case is made out against the present petitioners insofar
as the allegations of 370(3) or 370A (2) of IPC. Because this court while dealing with the present
matter have kept in mind the admitted position on facts that the petitioners are customers of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/89360095/ 5
Bikash Kumar Jain & Another vs State Of Odisha ....... Opp. Party on 9 February, 2024
Spa where allegedly other accused persons were running a brothel. Therefore, on the allegation no
case or evidence is illuminating from record that they were indulging in trafficking the women who
were allegedly sexually exploited. All the alleged victim girls were from Thailand, and they were
adults. Nothing has come on record to suggest that they were sexually exploited; rather they were
into prostitution out of their own volition. That's what is borne out from record.
12. If the evidences collected by the investigation are analyzed at this stage, it could be safely
inferred that neither the petitioners have trafficking the women nor they have exploited the
"trafficked" women. Benefit would be to rely on the two judgments of Karnataka High Court
matching the facts situation of the present case. The relevant part of the judgment of Karnataka
High Court in the matter of Chandru S vs The State by Malleshwaram P.S are quoted below :
1.*******
2. On careful perusal of the entire charge sheet papers, it is seen that these petitioners
are the customers in brothel house found by the police at the time of raid. This Court
had an occasion to deal with similar matters in the following cases:
i) 2015(3) Crimes 281 (AP) ( Goenka Sajan Kumar Vs. State of A.P. Rep by P.P. high
Court of A.P.]
ii) Crl.P. No.7056/2014 [ Mohammed Rafi Vs. State of Karnataka]
iii) Crl. P. No. 7110/2011 [ Suraj Vs. State of Karnataka]
iv) Crl. P. 5808/2016 [ Pravesh Chatri Vs. State of Karnataka]
v) W.P. No.56504/2015 [Mahesh Hebbar @ Mahesh Vs. The Station House Officer,
Banaswadi Police Station]
vi) Crl.P. No.9682/2016 [ Aswath @ Naveen Vs. State of Karnataka]
vii) Crl.P. 8055/2016 [ Raghavendra @ Raghu Vs. State of Karnataka]
viii) Crl. P. No.200782/2016 [ Shivaraj Vs. State of Karnataka]
3. In all the above said decisions, this Court has considered that the offences under
Sections 3,4,5 and 7 of the ITP Act and Section 370 IPC are not attracted, so far as the
customers of a brothel house is concerned. In fact, this Court has consistently come
to the conclusion after analyzing the above said provisions in the above said cases,
that the constitution of the offences are not made-out so far as the customers are
concerned.
4.*********

5. Therefore, none of the above said provisions are attracted so far as the customers
are concerned. Though it is felt by this Court on various occasions that the customer
virtually encourages prostitution, but in the absence of any specific penal provision, it
cannot be said that he is liable for any prosecution for the above said offences.
6. In the above said circumstances, I do not find any strong reason to differ from the
above said consistent view taken by this Court. There is no legal impediment to quash
the proceeding.
7.*******
8.*******
9.******* In the second judgment Sri Roopendra Singh vs State of Karnataka
reported in 2021 SCC online Karnataka 306, the Karnataka High Court paragraph
No.1,7,9 has held as under:
"1. This petition is filed under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. seeking to quash the entire
proceedings in C.C. No. 10669/2015 renumbered as S.C. No. 19/2017 of Koramangala
Police Station, Bengaluru pending on the file of the LXXI Additional City Civil and
Sessions Judge, Bengaluru for the offences punishable under Section 188, 370(3),
370(A), 294 read with Section 109 of IPC and Section 35 of the Karnataka Excise Act,
1965 in so far as the same relates to the petitioners.
2.*******
3.******
4.*******
5.*******
6.*******
7. I have perused the FIR and the orders relied on by the learned counsel for the
petitioners. The sole ground on which the petitioners herein are arrayed as accused
Nos. 42, 43, 44 and 49 in the above crime is that they were present at the spot during
the raid, indicating that they were the customers who had gone to the spot.
8.********
9. Accordingly, the criminal petition is allowed. The proceedings insofar as the
petitioners are concerned in C.C. No. 10669/2015 renumbered as S.C. No. 19/2017
pending on the file of the LXXI Additional City Civil and Sessions Judge, Bengaluru
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/89360095/ 7
Bikash Kumar Jain & Another vs State Of Odisha ....... Opp. Party on 9 February, 2024
stands quashed."
13. The Law relating to sex work in our country is guided by Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956,
the said Act originally designed as "Suppression of Immoral Traffic Act". It was subsequently
amended in the year 1986. The act of sexual intercourse for consideration is not illegal per se under
the Immoral Trafficking (Prevention) Act,1956. But the intent of legislation is only to ensure that
women/girls are not illegally trafficked for the purpose of prostitution, and they are exploited.
Soliciting or inducing or seducing for the purpose of prostitution is illegal but prostitution per se is
not illegal. Though exception to the judicial trend of exonerating the customers under the Act, 1956
are limited, but on the strength of weak evidence the customer cannot be tried for under the
provisions under Sections of Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956. It is only when the customer
performs his role of procuring the women for another, the offence under Section 370A IPC could be
employed into action against the customer. In the instant case none of the sex workers have stated
that they have been exploited sexually or abused sexually or they are trafficked. In the absence of
material that women are trafficked for the purpose of engaging for sexual exploitation, the offence
under Section 370A (2) of IPC will not be attract against the customer. Further, it is for the
prosecution to bring on record the evidence that the customers are also having reason inter alia to
believe that the victims are trafficked by engaged persons for sexual exploitation. No such material
is illuminating.
14. Moreover, none of the girls apprehended from the spot have been examined by the Police under
Section 161 Cr.P.C. Therefore, it may not be possible for the prosecution to prove the factum of
trafficking of women and their sexual exploitation beyond reasonable doubt in the absence of the
women being examined. In the absence of any material on record the trial Court was absolutely
wrong in taking cognizance of offences under Sections 370(3) and 370A (2) of the IPC, qua the
present petitioners.
15. Therefore, I am of the considered view that this is a fit case where this Court in exercising the
inherent jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C. quash the cognizance order insofar as offences
under Sections 370(3) and 370A (2) of IPC against the present petitioners are concerned. However,
the present petitioners have to face the trial insofar as the other offences as alleged in the charge
sheet and cognizance is taken by the court below are concerned.
16. The CRLMC is partly allowed and disposed of.
