ORDER (ORAL)

[1] The petitioner assails the order dated 13.09.2022 of the Special Secretary (Home),
Government of Manipur, whereby the petitioner's son, Thangjamang Touthang, was

Mr. Jamkholun Touthang vs Union Of India on 25 January, 2023
subjected to preventive detention in exercise of power under Section 3 (1) of the
Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1988.
He seeks a consequential writ of habeas corpus to set his son at liberty forthwith.
Page 1 [2] Heard Mr. Serto T. Kom, learned counsel for the petitioner; Mr. S.
Nepolean, learned Government Advocate, appearing for respondent Nos. 3 & 4; and
Mr. Paikhomba, learned counsel, representing Mr. Kh. Samarjit, learned DSGI,
appearing for respondent Nos. 1 & 2.
[3] The primary ground of attack urged by Mr. Serto T. Kom, learned counsel, is the
unexplained delay in the disposal of the detenu's representation against his
detention. The representation of the detenu is dated 10.10.2022. It was rejected on
14.12.2022. The affidavit-in-opposition filed by the Deputy Secretary (Home),
Government of Manipur, reflects that the detenu's representation dated 10.10.2022
was forwarded by the jail authority on the same day and but received by the Home
Department on 12.10.2022. Para-wise comments were sought from the police
authorities under letter dated 20.10.2022. However, comments were furnished by the
Officer-in-Charge, Kakching Police Station, only on 08.12.2022.
Upon receiving the same, the matter was considered and the representation was rejected on
14.12.2022. It was further stated that an explanation has been sought from the Director General of
Police, Manipur, for the delay in the submission of the para-wise comments but no explanation had
been received. [4] The file of the detaining authority produced by Mr. S. Nepolean, learned
Government Advocate, reflects that the detenu's representation was forwarded by the
Superintendent, Manipur Central Jail, Sajiwa, to the Inspector General of Prisons, Manipur, on
10.10.2022 itself and was received in the Directorate of Prisons, Manipur, on 11.10.2022. It was then
forwarded to the Home Department by the Inspector General of Prisons, Manipur, on 12.10.2022,
and received on the same day. By letter dated 20.10.2022, the Deputy Secretary Page 2 (Home),
Government of Manipur, sought para-wise comments from the Director General of Police, Manipur.
No explanation is forthcoming as to why the police authorities were not addressed immediately. In
any event, comments were furnished by the Officer-in-Charge, Kakching Police Station, only under
letter dated 08.12.2022. Perusal thereof reflects that reference was made therein only to past events
and there were no subsequent developments which were awaited leading to delay in the furnishing
of such comments. Further, having received the para- wise comments from the Police Department,
it appears that no action was taken thereon till 14.12.2022, as it is evident from the Note file. The
delay at several stages therefore remains unaccounted for.
[5] Be it noted that in Rajammal vs. State of T.N. and another [(1999) 1 SCC 417], the Supreme
Court observed that if delay is caused in consideration of the detenu's representation owing to
indifference or any other lapse, such delay would adversely affect further detention of the prisoner.
According to the Supreme Court, it is for the authority concerned to explain the delay, if any, in
disposing of the representation and it is not enough to say that the delay is very short, as even longer
delay can as well be explained and so, the test is not the duration or range of delay, but how it is
explained by the authority concerned. The unexplained delay in that case was a mere 5 days. [6]

Mr. Jamkholun Touthang vs Union Of India on 25 January, 2023
Earlier, in Professor Khaidem Ibocha Singh vs. The State of Manipur [AIR 1972 Supreme Court
438], the Supreme Court set aside an order of detention on the ground that there was unexplained
delay of 17 days in the passing of an order on the representation made by the detenu.
Page 3 [7] More recently, in Sarabjeet Singh Mokha vs. The District Magistrate, Jabalpur, and others
[(Criminal Appeal No. 1301 of 2021, decided on 29.10.2021 = 2021 SCC OnLine SC 1019], the
Supreme Court held that by delaying a decision on such representation, the State Government
denied the detenu a valuable statutory right. The Supreme Court observed that the delay by the State
Government in disposing of such representation strikes at the heart of the procedural rights and
guarantees granted to a detenu. [8] Though it is laudable that the Government of Manipur is waging
a 'war on drugs' and initiating stringent measures to arrest the menace of illicit drug manufacture,
trafficking and marketing in and through the State of Manipur, it is equally its responsibility to
ensure that procedural safeguards are taken note of strictly so as to protect the Constitutional and
statutory rights of persons detained under preventive detention laws. Despite this Court stating to
this effect time and again, scant regard is shown by the authorities concerned to compliance with the
prescribed norms.
[9] The unexplained somnolence on the part of the State and the Police authorities in dealing with
the detenu's representation clearly indicates a lackadaisical and casual approach on their part,
which is inimical to the mandatory legal requirements in a matter of this nature. The same would
also be fatal to the very validity and continuance of the impugned detention order. [10] The order of
detention dated 13.09.2022 issued by the Special Secretary (Home), Government of Manipur, is
accordingly set aside. All consequential proceedings based thereon shall also stand set aside. The
detenu, Thangjamang Touthang, presently incarcerated in Manipur Central Jail, Sajiwa, Page 4 shall
be set at liberty forthwith unless his continued incarceration is validly required in connection with
any other case.
WP (Cril.) No. 34 of 2022 is accordingly allowed.
In the circumstances, there shall be no order as to costs. A copy of this order shall be sent to the
Chief Secretary, Government of Manipur, for information and necessary further action in the
context of educating the detaining authorities and the police authorities in the State of Manipur as
to what are the procedural and temporal norms that they need to adhere to while exercising power
and jurisdiction under preventive detention laws.
