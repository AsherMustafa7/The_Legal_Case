S. No. 03 vs State Through Vigilance Organization ... on 30 January, 2023
2. Aggrieved of and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order dated 06- 05-2009,
appellant/convict has questioned its legality, propriety and correctness on the following grounds:-
(i) that the sanction for launching prosecution against appellant was not proper
sanction, it was a photostat copy, the sanction does not disclose as to who is the
competent authority granting sanction, as such the prosecution against appellant
vitiates;
(ii) that the Ld. Trial Court has not appreciated the evidence in its real perspective, so
far the offence of forgery u/s 468 RPC against appellant is concerned the trial court
has observed that said offence of forgery is not proved, even no witness of
prosecution has stated as to who forged the document, there is nothing on record to
suggest as to whether the bills were actually forged and if forged who forged the
same, the Trial Court has lost sight of the fact and taken his view on presumptions
and not appreciated the evidence on record, moreso, PW-7 Mohd Shafi (Accountant
in Treasury Office Thathri from September 1993 to November 1996) who is alleged
witness to identify the signatures of appellant and preparation of the bills has
categorically stated that when the vouchers were produced before him, as a prudent
man, he could not have any doubt about the genuineness of the bills;
(iii) that the trial court has also lost sight of the fact that neither the bills were
received by the Accountant from appellant/convict directly or the appellant/convict
received money from him directly, prosecution could not prove guilt of
appellant/convict beyond reasonable doubt and therefore, appellant cannot be
convicted on assumptions and suspicion.
3. Sh. Nirmal Kotwal Ld. Counsel for appellant/convict while seeking the setting aside of impugned
judgment of conviction rendered against the appellant by the Trial Court has vehemently argued,
that the sanction was granted against the appellant only for prosecution of offences u/s 5(2) of P.C.
Act 2006 r/w Sec. 409/468 RPC whereas the Trial Court has tried the appellant/convict for one
more offence u/s 471 RPC for which there was no sanction for prosecution, the alleged sanction
order which is photocopy though not admissible in evidence was placed on record but no permission
of the court was sought to prove the same by way of secondary evidence, the alleged sanction order
does not depict that what material collected by Vigilance Organization was placed before the
authority for grant of sanction, when all these aspects have not been proved by the prosecution in
the trial court, the trial gets vitiated. It is argued, that the trial court has completely gone wrong in
wrapping the appellant u/s 471 RPC, the invalid sanction has vitiated the trial, that as per the
prosecution story appellant was working as Addl. Treasury Officer Thathri while one Mohd Shafi
was the Accountant in the said office at relevant time who has deposed, that he had worked under
the control and supervision of appellant from September 1993 to March 1994 accountant namely
Man Singh prepared the medical reimbursement bills for the Month of April & May 1993 whose
signatures and the signatures of appellant he identifies, said Man Singh (the then Accountant) is
neither cited as witness in the challan nor examined by the prosecution in the case, the said Mohd
Shafi has been shown signatures and preparing of the bills who has categorically stated the he has
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/149741191/ 2
S. No. 03 vs State Through Vigilance Organization ... on 30 January, 2023
no doubt regarding genuineness of the said bills. It is argued, that no handwriting expert has been
cited as witness nor the bills/voucher/cash memo/acquaintance rolls/cash book/drawl registers
have been sent to FSL to find out whether there is a forgery in regard to the preparation of the bills,
no cogent evidence has been adduced by the prosecution in regard to the inflation of bills, offence of
using forged document for the purpose of cheating u/s 468 RPC has not been proved, therefore,
unless and until ingredient u/s 463 RPC defining the offence of forgery in regard to preparation of a
false document is proved, a person cannot be convicted for commission of offence u/s 468 intending
to use the forged document for the purpose of cheating and if no forgery is proved, then the other
offences indicted against the accused cannot be said to have been proved and even section 471 RPC
is not attracted. It is moreso argued, that the investigating officer (I/O) PW-11 Mohd Aslam Malik in
his cross-examination has admitted that he had not seized the original bills lying in AG office but
carbon copies of the bills were placed on record without providing the original, once the forgery u/s
463 RPC is not proved then offences u/ss 468/471 RPC & offences under section 409 RPC r/w 5(2)
P.C. Act could not have been proved against appellant by the trial court. To support his arguments,
Ld. Counsel for appellant has relied upon the judgments reported in, (i) 1998 Supreme(J&K) 41
[Jangi Ram--Appellant Versus State of J&K--Respondent & (ii) (1992) CriLJ 750 [SANTOSH
KUMAR PADHY AND ANOTHER--Appellant Vs. THE STATE--Respondent].
4. Sh. Raman Sharma Ld. AAG for respondent/state has supported the impugned judgment and
order of conviction dated 06-05-2009 and has strenuously argued, that the original sanction for
prosecution order/copy has been placed on record which has not been disputed by the other side
therefore it does not lie in the mouth of counsel for petitioner that there is no valid sanction for
prosecution of accused, even if the photocopy of the sanction is exhibited, it cannot be lateron said
that photocopy of sanction is invalid in the eyes of law. It is argued, that appellant/convict while
posted as Addl. Treasury Officer Thathri in the year 1993-94 on account of some ailment of his
daughter, on the prescription and consultation of Dr. M.S. Sudan Physician Specialist who had
prescribed Ciprobid Tablets for the treatment of appellant(cid:128)s daughter, in a fraudulent manner
appellant had drawn an amount of Rs. 63,614/- in his favour by misuse of his official position on
account of medical reimbursement claim by insertions in two cash memos whereby amount of Rs.
499/- was inflated to Rs. 10,499/-, appellant/convict as per the prosecution evidence had actually
incurred expenses of Rs. 6,214.32 but on account of forgery committed by him in the cash memo
issued by PW-3 Vipin Kumar and attested by PWs Dr, Balbir Singh and Dr. Mandeep Singh the
amount has been inflated to Rs. 62,614.32/-and in this way by abuse of his official position
appellant/convict had withdrawn excess amount of Rs. 56,400/- from Addl. Treasury Thathri where
he is posted as Addl. Treasury Officer during the period w.e.f. 10.04.1993 to 12.04.1994 causing
pecuniary advantage to him and corresponding loss to the state exchequer. It is argued, that the trial
court has found complicity of accused for commission of offence u/s 409 RPC r/w 5(2) of P.C. Act
on the basis of cogent evidence on record and therefore, offences u/ss 471/409 RPC r/w 5(2) are
proved against the accused who has been rightly convicted and sentenced. To support his
arguments, Ld. AAG for respondent has relied upon the decisions reported in, (i) 2010 (2) JKJ [HC]
573 (Nazir Ahmad Lone Versus State of J&K & Ors.), (ii) 2003 (4) [HC] 291 (Gh. Rasool Shah
Versus State & Ors.), (iii) 2009 Legal Eagle 1140 (State of Madhya Pradesh Versus Jialal), (iv) AIR

5. I have heard Sh. Nirmal Kotwal Ld. Counsel for appellant and Sh. Raman Sharma Ld. AAG for
respondent. I have also perused the record of the trial court. The prosecution to prove it(cid:128)s case has
examined as many as 11 witnesses out of listed 13. Before coming to the conclusion whether
prosecution has successfully substantiated charges against appellant/convict beyond hilt, it is
pertinent to give a brief resume of the evidence led by the prosecution. Relevant portions of the
testimonies of the prosecution witnesses can be summarized as under:-

marked as ExPw-MS/12. The cash memo No. 9715 dated 01.12.93 amounting to Rs. 150.05 was
verified by him, it was inflated to Rs. 4150.05. The verification bears his signature and seal and
marked as ExPw- MS/13. The cash memo no. 9761 dated 04-12-1993 amounting to Rs. 131.70 np
was inflated to Rs. 1131.70, the verification over the said memo bears his signature and seal it is
marked as ExPw-Ms/14. In cross-examination the witness has stated, that he used to do private
practice at Kapoor Medicates Bakashi Nagar Jammu where he examine the patients. He cannot say
about the identity as well as the address of the person whose name was mentioned over the bills and
prescriptions. The bills ExPw-Ms to ExPw-MS/14 were in the same handwriting and in the same ink
and he cannot say about the exact date when the same were verified by him because they did not
bear any date over them. The cash memos were prepared by the concerned shopkeeper. That he
does not know the identity of the person who had brought the aforesaid bills before him for
verification. There is some difference in the cutting and verification pertaining to words "3" and "5"
whereas the words "2" and "6" which were written on two places shows no difference. That cash

S. No. 03 vs State Through Vigilance Organization ... on 30 January, 2023
memos were verified by him after personally examining them from the counterfoils. That the space
between the words and figures over cash memos ExPw-MS to ExPw-MS/14 is natural and the same
was not kept by him deliberately. That he had mentioned the price of medicines over the
prescriptions and only the quantity of the medicines has been stated over them.
PW-9 Ram Parkash Bakshi on 13.03.2000 has deposed that letter ExPw-RPB in the file bears his
initials and the same were put by him after verification of the cash book (Madwar) of the Treasury.
The witness has identified by the signature of the then Treasury officer Sh. Nagar Mal over the letter
which was in the hand writing of Khirati Lal Superintendent. This letter was written in response to a
letter issued by Vigilance office on 28.01.97 when he was posted as Additional Treasury Officer
Jammu. The Exhibit over the aforesaid letter was put subject to the objection by the learned counsel
for the accused about its admissibility. PW-10 A.S. Sharma Sr. Deputy Accountant General, Ag
Office Allahabad has deposed, that in the year 1994 he was posted as Dy. Accountant General in the
A.G. Office Jammu. That during his posting in the aforesaid office the vouchers received from the
Treasury Office Thathri were audited and some irregularities were found over them which were
conveyed and pointed out to the Director Accounts and Treasury alongwith photocopies of the
vouchers vide letter No. CAP ©/94-95/Try/19 dated 07-10-1994. The said letter on the file bears his
signature, its contents are correct and the said letter was addressed to Sh. P.N. Tickoo, Director A
and Treasury J&K Srinagar. The letter on the file is marked as ExPw-AS. In cross-examination the
witness deposed that he had examined all the papers and cash memos annexed with the medical
bills before writing the aforesaid letter. That a customer is required to pay as per cash memos and so
far as this case is concerned, he can say that amount mentioned in the cash memos was inflated but
he cannot say who had done the same.
PW-11 Mohd Aslam Malik (I/O) investigating officer of the case has proved the preliminary enquiry
in the matter which is marked as ExPw-MA and on the basis of the said preliminary enquiry report
the case FIR No. 75/95 was registered against the accused. The allegations against the accused made
in the preliminary enquiry report conducted by Dy. Director Accounts and Treasuries were found to
be correct. During the course of investigation, statement of the complainant in the case was
recorded besides concerned record was seized vide seizure memos ExPW-RK and ExPw-RK/1. He
had also recorded the statement of witnesses in the case and the documents ExPW-VK and
ExPW-VK/1 in the file were obtained by him from Kapoor Medicates. The counterfoils of cash memo
and bills book were also seized by him vide seizure memo which is marked as ExPw-RK/4 and
before handing over investigation to Inspector Mitla, it was established from his preliminary
enquiry and investigation that accused had drawn Rs. 44995.96 np excess amount from Treasury.
The witness had identified the signatures of Inspector Mitla over seizure memos ExPw-MS and
ExPW-MS/1 in the file. The statement by virtue of which accused had deposited some amount in the
file is in the handwriting of Inspector Mitla it is marked as ExPW-MA. Similarly the statement
pertaining to the difference of amount has been mentioned in the challan. In cross-examination the
witness has stated, that during the course of investigation he had seized acquaintance roll of Thathri
Treasury office, four bill books of Kapoor Medicate Store besides a statement of Kapoor Medicate
Bakshi Nagar. He had not seized the original bills lying in the AG Office but the same were seized by
investigating officer who had taken over the investigation from him and the investigation was yet to
be completed at the point of time. In the course of his investigation it was established that accused
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/149741191/ 9
S. No. 03 vs State Through Vigilance Organization ... on 30 January, 2023
had committed embezzlement but the extent of exact embezzlement could not be ascertained by
him. From the letter of Dy. Accountant General and his statement, in the course of investigation it
was found that accused had committed offence of embezzlement. He had tried his utmost to collect
the original bills which were lying in the AG office through Letter No. SSP/96-1574/VOJ written by
SSP Jammu. That besides carbon copies of bills he had placed on record a letter from Kapoor
Medicates and the said letter contained the detail mentioned in the bill books. The seizure memo
ExPw-MS was prepared by him during the course of investigation. That Mr. Mitla can explain about
the amount shown to be deposited vide memo Mark "A" and he cannot say anything in this regard.
7. The 1st argument canvassed by Ld. Counsel for appellant/convict is, "that the alleged sanction
order which is photocopy though not admissible in evidence was placed on record, but no
permission of the court was sought to prove the same by way of secondary evidence, the alleged
sanction order does not depict that what material collected by Vigilance Organization was placed
before the authority for grant of sanction, the sanction is therefore invalid and the trial gets
vitiated".
Per-contra Ld. AAG for state has vehemently urged, that the evidence on record shows that sanction
for prosecution of the accused has been issued by competent authority u/s 6 of P.C. Act 2006 after
recording its satisfaction on the basis of material placed before the sanctioning authority and the
sanction order placed on record is copy of original sanction which was forwarded to Commissioner
Vigilance for J&K Jammu by General Administration Department (Vigilance) vide order no.
mentioned in the said sanction dated 19-01-1998, as such, no prejudice has been caused to the
accused, impugned sanction order has been made part of the record vide order dated 20-12-2006
rendered by the court of Sessions Judge Anticorruption Jammu in pursuance of application filed by
the prosecution u/s 540 Cr.pc.
In Mohd Iqbal Ahmed Vs. State of Andhra Pradesh [AIR 1979 SC 677] Hon(cid:128)ble Apex Court has held
that an order of valid sanction can be proved by the sanctioning authority in two ways: either (1) by
producing the original sanction which itself contains the facts constituting the offence and the
grounds of satisfaction and (2) by adducing evidence aliunde to show that the facts placed before the
Sanctioning Authority and the satisfaction arrived at by it. It is reiterated, that the file containing
original order of sanction dated 19-01-1998 placed on record reveals that sanction for prosecution of
the accused was granted by the Government of Jammu & Kashmir after consideration of the
relevant material placed before the competent authority and approval for launching prosecution
against the accused was given by the then Chief Minister when the file reached him after clearance
by nine different officials in the Government hierarchy, and out of some cyclostyle copies prepared
from the original sanction order, one cyclostyle copy of sanction order has been annexed with the
file. So in these circumstances, the argument of learned counsel for the appellant/convict in regard
to validity of sanction order and causing prejudice to appellant/convict pales into insignificance. It
is apt to mention here, that whether sanction had been given or not is to be seen before taking
cognizance of the offence and not after that. If there was no sanction no cognizance against
appellant/convict could have been taken by the trial court. Sanction is required only for the purpose
of taking of cognizance of the offence and thereafter the prosecution is required to prove the
commission of offence/offences by the accused on the basis of evidence available on record. From

S. No. 03 vs State Through Vigilance Organization ... on 30 January, 2023
the perusal of impugned judgment, it is established/proved beyond reasonable doubt that the
prosecution has proved valid sanction for prosecution of appellant/convict. The case law relied by
Ld. Counsel for appellant/convict reported in 1998 Supreme (J&K) 41 [Jangi Ram-- Appellant
Versus State of J&K--Respondent] coupled with the case laws relied by Ld. AAG for respondent

Venkatachala Gounder--Appellant V. Arulmigu Viswesaraswami and V.P. Temple and
another--Respondents) support the case projected by the prosecution that valid sanction has been
granted for prosecution of appellant/convict in the case in hand. Arguments urged by Ld. Counsel
for appellant/convict that there is no valid sanction for prosecution of appellant/convict are legally
misplaced, repelled, discarded and rejected.
8. The next argument urged by Ld. Counsel for appellant/convict is, "that no cogent evidence has
been adduced by the prosecution in regard to inflation of bills, no handwriting expert has been cited
as witness nor the bills/vouchers/cash memo/acquaintance roll/cash book/drawl register have been
sent to FSL to find out whether forgery has been committed in preparation of the bills, the trial court
has even not proved the offence of forgery u/s 468 RPC, if no forgery is proved then all the other
offences including offence u/s 471 RPC cannot be said to have been proved/established against
appellant/convict, therefore, the impugned judgment requires to be out rightly set aside/quashed".
Dealing with the aforesaid arguments urged by Ld. Counsel for appellant/convict, it is apt to
reiterate here, that the trial court in para 24 of the impugned judgment in concluding lines of the
para has rendered opinion as under:-
"No expert evidence with regard to the hand writing is also forth coming in as much
as the bills/vouchers in question were not send to the expert alongwith specimen
writing of the accused. so in view of the evidence on record it cannot be pin pointed
whether it was accused who had forged the bills in question as such charge under
section 468 RPC cannot be sustained against him."
Hon(cid:128)ble Supreme Court of India in a case law titled SHEILA SEBASTIAN--Appellant(s) Versus R.
JAWAHARAJ & ANR. ETC.-- Respondent(s) (in CRIMINAL APPEAL NOS. 359-360 of 2010,
decided on 11 May 2018) while acquitting the accused and observing that unless and until
ingredients u/s 463 IPC are satisfied a person cannot be convicted u/s 465 and offence of forgery
cannot lie against a person who has not created or signed the fictitious document, in paragraphs
17,18,19,20,21,22,25 & 26 held as under:-
(17) At this juncture, it is pertinent to have a look at the definition of „forgery(cid:128) and
the precedents on this aspect.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/149741191/ 11
S. No. 03 vs State Through Vigilance Organization ... on 30 January, 2023
463. Forgery--Whoever makes any false documents [for false electronic record] or part of a
document support any claim or title, or to cause any person to part with property, or to enter into
any express or implied contract, or with intent to commit fraud of that fraud may be committed,
commits forgery.
(18) It would also be necessary to understand the scope of Section 464, IPC in this context--
464. Making a false document.--A person is said to make a false document or false electronic record
First.--Who dishonestly or fraudulently--
(a) makes, signs, seals or executes a document or part of a document;
(b) makes or transmits any electronic record or part of any electronic record;
(c) affixes any electronic signature on any electronic record;
(d) makes any mark denoting the execution of a document or the authenticity of the electronic
signature, with the intention of causing it to be believed that such document or part of document,
electronic record or electronic signature was made, signed, sealed, executed, transmitted or affixed
by or by the authority of a person by whom or by whose authority he knows that it was not made,
signed, sealed executed or affixed; or Secondly--Who without lawful authority, dishonestly or
fraudulently, by cancellation or otherwise, alters a document or any electronic record in any
material part thereof, after it has been made, executed or affixed with electronic signature either by
himself or by any other person, whether such person be living or dead at the time of such alteration,
or Thirdly.--Who dishonestly or fraudulently causes any person to sign, seal, execute or alter a
document or an electronic record or to affix his electronic signature on any electronic record
knowing that such person by reason of unsoundness of mind or intoxication cannot, or that by
reason of deception practiced upon him, he does not know the contents of the document or
electronic record of the nature of alteration. Explanation 1.--A man(cid:128)s signature of his own name
may amount to forgery.
Explanation 2.--The making of a false document in the name of a fictitious person, intending it to be
believed that the document was made by a real person, or in the name of a deceased person,
intending it to be believed that the document was made by the person in his lifetime, may amount to
forgery.
Explanation 3.--For the purposes of this section, the expression "affixing electronic signature" shall
have the meaning assigned to it in clause (d) of Sub-Section (1) of section 2 of the Information
Technology Act, 2000.
(19) A close scrutiny of the aforesaid provisions makes it clear that, section 463 defines the offence
of forgery, while section 464 substantiates the same by providing an answer as to when a false
document could be said to have been made for the purpose of committing an offence of forgery
under section 463, IPC. Therefore, we can safely deduce that section 464 defines one of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/149741191/ 12
S. No. 03 vs State Through Vigilance Organization ... on 30 January, 2023
ingredients of forgery i.e., making of a false document. Further, Section 465 provides punishment
for the commission of the offence of forgery. In order to sustain a conviction under section 465, first
it has to be proved that forgery was committed under section 463, implying that ingredients under
section 464 should also be satisfied. Therefore, unless and until ingredients under section 463 are
satisfied a person cannot be convicted under section 465 by solely relying on the ingredients of
section 464, as the offence of forgery would remain incomplete.
(20) The key to unfold the present dispute lies in understanding Explanation 2 as given in section
464 of IPC. As Collin J., puts it precisely in Dickins V. Gill, (1896) 2 QB 310, a case dealing with the
possession and making of fictitious stamp wherein he stated that "to make", in itself involves
conscious act on the part of the maker. Therefore, an offence of forgery cannot lie against a person
who has not created it or signed it.
(21) It is observed in the case Md. Ibrahim and Ors. Vs. State of Bihar and Anr., (2009) 8 SCC 751
that-- "a person is said to have made a „false document(cid:128), if
(i) he made or executed a document claiming to be someone else or authorised by someone else; or
(ii) he altered or tampered a document; or
(iii) he obtained a document by practicing deception, or from a person not in control of his senses."
(22) In Md. Ibrahim (Supra), this court had the occasion to examine forgery of a document
purporting to be a valuable security (Section 467, IPC) and using of forged document as genuine
(Section 471,IPC). While considering the basic ingredients of both the offences, this court observed
that to attract the offence of forgery as defined under Section 463, IPC depends upon creation of a
document as defined under Section 464, IPC. It is further observed that mere execution of a sale
deed by claiming that property being sold was executant(cid:128)s property, did not amount to commission
of offences punishable under Sections 467 and 471, IPC even if title of property did not vest in the
executant.
(25) Keeping in view the strict interpretation of penal statute i.e., referring to rule of interpretation
wherein natural inferences are preferred, we observe that a charge of forgery cannot be imposed on
a person who is not the maker of the same. As held in plethora of cases, making of a document is
different than causing it to be made. As Explanation 2 to Section 464 further clarifies that, for
constituting an offence under Section 464 it is imperative that a false document is made and the
accused person is the maker of the same, otherwise the accused person is not liable for the offence of
forgery.
(26) The definition of "false document" is a part of the definition of "forgery". Both must be read
together. „Forgery(cid:128) and „Fraud(cid:128) are essentially matters of evidence which could be proved as a fact
by direct evidence or by inferences drawn from proved facts. In the case in hand, there is no finding
recorded by the trial court that the respondents have made any false document or part of the
document/record to execute mortgage deed under the guise of that „false document(cid:128). Hence,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/149741191/ 13
S. No. 03 vs State Through Vigilance Organization ... on 30 January, 2023
neither respondent No.1 can be held as makers of the forged documents. It is the imposter who can
be said to have made the false document by committing forgery. In such an event the trial court as
well as appellate court misguided themselves by convicting the accused, therefore, the High Court
has rightly acquitted the accused based on the settled legal position and we find no reason to
interfere with the same.
Facts of the case law (Supra) are, that Ld. Judicial Magistrate framed charges against accused 1&2
for commission of offences punishable u/ss 420, 423, 465, 424 r/w 109 IPC. Both the accused were
tried by Ld. Judicial Magistrate at Madras, found guilty and convicted accordingly. Aggrieved by the
same, respondents/accused appeared before Ld. Sessions Judge Tirunelveli which ended up in
dismissal by upholding the order of conviction. Respondents appeared before High Court which
acquitted the accused in revision petition by setting aside concurrent findings of the courts below by
observing that if offence of forgery in regard to making false document is not proved, then other
offences u/s 464/420 IPC being consequential equally cannot be sustained. Hon(cid:128)ble Supreme Court
concurring with the opinion of the High Court set aside the conviction of the accused and
maintained the order of acquittal by the High Court and dismissed the appeals by observing, that
unless ingredient of forgery under Section 363 IPC i.e. a person making a false document is not
proved, the consequential offences cannot lie against said person/accused who neither created the
forged document nor signed it. In the case in hand, as the trial court vide impugned judgment has
already held/opined that the prosecution has failed to prove that appellant/convict has forged the
bills, therefore, charges against appellant/convict u/s 468 r/w 471 RPC cannot be sustained. This
being the position of law, the prosecution has miserably failed to prove that appellant/convict has
committed any forgery or prepared forged documents in regard to the allegations of inflated bills to
draw the reimbursement claim in his favour. Moreso, no handwriting expert has been cited as
witness, nor the bills/vouchers/cash memo/acquaintance rolls/cash book/drawl registers have been
sent to FSL to find out whether there is a forgery in regard to preparation of bills, therefore, no
cogent and reliable evidence has been tendered by the prosecution to prove the inflation of bills.
Offences u/s 409 RPC r/w section 5(2) of P.C. Act being consequential offences, therefore, also
cannot be said to have been proved, by the prosecution as none of the prosecution witnesses have
tendered cogent and trustworthy evidence that appellant/convict has forged and inflated bills and
withdrawn excess amount by using his official position as public servant causing pecuniary
advantage to him and correspondence loss to state exchequer. Even PW-7 Mohd Shafi on the
relevant date of alleged embezzlement during the year September 1993 to November 1996 while
posted as Accountant in Treasury Office Thathri under the supervision of accused, has categorically
deposed in his cross-examination that the alleged vouchers of the medical reimbursement sent to
him by the accused were examined by him and they were found beyond any pale of doubt.
9. I, on the basis of the aforesaid evidence, hold that there is no legal evidence on record to prove
that appellant/convict has committed the forgery. The direct evidence/the circumstances as relied
upon by the prosecution are not strong enough indicating the involvement of appellant/convict in
the commission of crime and all the circumstances are not compatible with the possibility of guilt of
the accused. The witnesses examined by the prosecution, have not been able to putforth in their
evidence a ring of truth, so as to inspire confidence in this court. Evidence of prosecution witnesses,
is therefore, qualitatively and quantitatively, insufficient to bring nexus between appellant/convict
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/149741191/ 14
S. No. 03 vs State Through Vigilance Organization ... on 30 January, 2023
and commission of the offences indicted against him. This renders the entire story of prosecution as
incredible and unbelievable in the manner projected by the prosecution. On proper assessment,
evaluation and estimation of the evidence adduced by the prosecution, the evidence appears to be
weak, fragile, lacking in credibility, does not prove connecting link between the accused and
commission of offences. It would be highly dangerous and hazardous to hold the appellant/convict
guilty of offences alleged against him on the basis of weak, shaky and unacceptable evidence. The
whole case of the prosecution, therefore, becomes doubtful. For the foregoing reasons and
discussion, I am of the considered view, that prosecution has miserably failed to prove the guilt of
the appellant/convict beyond reasonable doubt for commission of offences u/ss 468/471/409 RPC
r/w 5(2) P.C. Act. Criminal conviction appeal, therefore, deserves to be allowed and the same is
allowed. Resultantly, the impugned judgment and order of conviction dated 06-05-2009 rendered
by the court of Ld. Addl. Sessions Judge Anti Corruption Jammu in file No. 06/challan titled State
Versus Roshan Lal Bhagat based on surmises, assumptions and presumptions is unsustainable in
the eyes of law and the same is set aside/quashed. Appellant/convict Roshan Lal Bhagat S/O Duni
Chand R/O Thoba Tehsil Bhaderwah (the then Addl. Treasury Officer Thathri), therefore, is, cleanly
acquitted of the charges leveled against him for commission of offences u/ss 468/471/409 RPC r/w
5(2) Prevention of Corruption Act 2006. He shall stand discharged from his bail and personal
bonds. Criminal conviction appeal is disposed off and after due compilation under rules, shall be
consigned to record. Record of the trial court be sent back forthwith alongwith copy of the judgment
for information of the trial court.
