Learned counsel for the applicants submits that applicants were not arrested during the course of
investigation and the charge-sheet have been submitted against them. It is further submitted that
the offence is punishable up to 7 years imprisonment.
Upon considering the facts and circumstances of the case, the prayer made by learned counsel for
the applicants is, hereby, refused.
After some arguments, learned counsel for the applicants wants to withdraw the application with
liberty to file a regular bail application before the court of competent jurisdiction.
In case bail application is filed by the learned counsel for the applicants, the same shall be decided
in the light of the observations made in the judgment rendered by the Supreme Court in Satender
Kumar Antil Vs. Central Bureau of Investigation & Another, (2022) 10 SCC 51, wherein the Supreme
Court considering the category(A) as mentioned in the paragraph no. 2, bail applications of such
accused against which charge-sheet has been submitted on appearance may be decided without the
accused being taken in physical custody or by granting interim bail till the bail application is
decided. It has been observed that at the cost of repetition, we wish to state that, in category A, one
would expect a better exercise of discretion on the part of the court in favour of the accused.
The application stands disposed of with the aforesaid liberty.
