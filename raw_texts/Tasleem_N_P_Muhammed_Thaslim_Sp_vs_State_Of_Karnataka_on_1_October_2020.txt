This Criminal Petition is filed under Section 439
Cr.P.C praying to enlarge the petitioner on bail in
Cr.No.110/2020 of Hulimavu Police Station, Bengaluru City
for the offence punishable under Sections 20(b), 8(c), 22(b),

These Criminal Petitions having been heard and
reserved on 23.09.2020, coming on for pronouncement this
4
day, through video conferencing the court pronounced the
following:
ORDER
These three criminal petitions are disposed of by a common order as they arise from same crime
number. The petitioner in Crl.P.No. 3073/2020 is accused No.1. Accused No.4 is the petitioner in
Crl.P.No. 3213/2020. The petitioner in Crl.P.No. 3383/2020 is accused No.5. All these petitioners
have been implicated in Cr.No. 110/2020 in relation to offences punishable under sections 8(c),
22(b) and 22(c) of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985.
2. Heard Smt. Sofia and Smt. Vishruti Vijay, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners and Smt.
K.P.Yashodha, learned HCGP for all the respondents.
3. The prosecution case is that the Police Inspector received credible information on 11.6.2020 that
about six persons living in a house bearing No. 65, Kapila Cross Road, Behind Maruthi Dental
College, Vinayaka Layout, Hulimavu, were possessing narcotic substances such as ganja, MDMA,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6411202/ 3
Tasleem N P @ Muhammed Thaslim Sp vs State Of Karnataka on 1 October, 2020
ecstasy tablets and LSD strips and they were about to sell those substances. Immediately the Police
Inspector conducted a raid on that house, seized the substances and arrested those persons.
4. Learned counsel for the petitioners in all the cases have argued that the police did not seize any
contraband substance from the conscious possession of the petitioners. The prosecution has not yet
obtained the qualitative and quantitative report from the FSL, it is mandatory that according to
Standing Instruction 1/1988, the report must be obtained within 15 days from the date of sending
the narcotic drug to the FSL. There is no compliance of Standing Instructions. For this reason,
section 37 of the NDPS Act cannot be invoked. They also argued that the police officer did not
register FIR soon after receiving the credible information. They proceeded to the spot to conduct
search without registering FIR. Therefore, the whole seizure is bad in law and for this reason, the
seizure panchanama cannot be looked into for any purpose. Relying upon number of authorities in
support of their case, they submitted that all the petitions must be allowed and the petitioners
enlarged on bail.
5. Learned High Court Government Pleader argued that there is no infraction of procedure. The
petitioners and other accused were also staying in the house where the raid was conducted. The
contraband substances were found inside the house and therefore the burden is on the accused to
prove that they were not aware of the contents of the bag. She referred to section 35 of the NDPS
Act. She also submitted that the police officer has followed every procedure and the same is
disclosed in the seizure mahazar. The seizure was according to law. She further submitted that the
seized substance was sent to FSL within time and the reason for delay in receiving the report is due
to restriction imposed for controlling infectious pandemic Covid-19. Moreover at the stage of
deciding the bail application, this aspect cannot be given so much of importance because in the
seizure mahazar, it is clearly stated about the quantity and the nature of the substances seized from
the possession of the accused. She referred to the order passed by the co-ordinate bench of this court
in Crl. P. 1298/2020 to argue that non-compliance of the Standing Instructions is not a ground for
granting bail. She submitted that the coordinate bench refused bail by referring to the judgment of
the Supreme Court in the case of Superintendent, Narcotics Control Bureau, Chennai, vs R.
Paulsamy [(2000) 9 SCC 549]. She argued for dismissing the petitions.
6. Since the counsel for the petitioners highlighted the point that the contraband substances were
not seized from the conscious possession of the accused, it is necessary to state that the word
'conscious' is related with the mental state of a person and his knowledge about something. It does
not take the attributes of physical possession. If a bag containing contraband is found in the house
of the accused, it goes without saying that the first impression of an ordinary prudent man is that
the bag belongs to the accused and he must be aware of its contents. If he takes a stand that he was
not aware of the contents, the burden is on him to establish it. Thus seen, the learned counsel for the
petitioners have made a futile argument that there was no seizure from the conscious possession of
the petitioners.
7. The seizure panchanama discloses recording of reasons by the police officer for not being able to
apply for search warrant and also compliance of proviso to section 42(1) of the NDPS Act.
Panchanama also shows search being made in the presence of a gazetted officer. Therefore there is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6411202/ 4
Tasleem N P @ Muhammed Thaslim Sp vs State Of Karnataka on 1 October, 2020
due compliance of all the requirements envisaged under NDPS Act.
8. Reference may be made to the judgments cited by learned counsel for the petitioners. In Ben
Okoro vs State of Karnataka [Crl. P. No. 8644/2017] bail was granted to the accused taking note of
the fact that the qualitative and quantitative report was not obtained within 15 days as per Standing
Instruction No. 1/1988. In the case of Kelsi Katte Mahammed Shakir vs The Superintendent of
Customs, Air Intelligence Unit [Criminal Petition No. 5402/2018] also, this court was inclined to
grant bail noticing the fact that the FSL report was not obtained within fifteen days. But, in
Crl.P.No.1298/2020 (Nonso Joachin Udedike vs State of Karnataka decided on 9.6.2020), the
judgment of the Supreme Court in Paulsamy (supra) has been referred to hold that it is too early to
take into account all the formalities to be complied with for the purpose of deciding a bail
application. Therefore, if the investigation officer could not obtain the FSL report within 15 days, it
is not so significant that too when there are other materials indicating existence of prima facie
materials about the involvement of the petitioners in commission of offences.
9. Learned counsel for the petitioners have placed reliance on the judgment in the case of Lalita
Kumari vs Government of Uttar Pradesh and Others [(2014) 2 SCC 1] in support of their argument
that the seizure panchanama conducted by the appellants without registration of FIR was illegal.
10. Examined whether the ratio in Lalita Kumari (supra) is applicable in a situation where a police
officer only receives a credible or secret information about an offence which is about to be
committed, I may with great respect observe that the primary duty of police is to prevent an offence
from happening; immediately after receiving the information, a police officer has to proceed to spot
for averting the crime, and taking such other measures as the situation demands. In Lalita Kumari
(supra), the focus is on the duty of Station House Officer once he receives information about
commission of offence, that means the information should disclose a crime being already
committed. And in such a situation, if the crime is cognizable, the Station House Officer is bound to
register FIR without wasting time. But the secret information does not disclose a crime being
committed, it only alerts the police about a crime which is about to occur. The police officer who
receives such information has to proceed to spot for preventing the crime or to take such other
measures that the situation demands. Thereafter if he prepares a report, it may be treated as FIR for
further course of action. Sometimes, offences do take place in the presence of the police officer. In
such a situation, his first duty is to arrest the accused and collect the evidence, and not registration
of FIR.
11. In the case on hand what the police officer received was a report about likelihood of offences
under NDPS Act being committed, the informant only suspected possession of contraband
substances, regarding which no FIR could be registered without ascertaining the truth in the
information. The seizure panchanama discloses that the petitioners and other accused possessed
contraband substance for the purpose of selling them. He seized the substances and made a report
of the same. No error can be found in it.
12. The learned counsel for the petitioners have placed reliance on some decisions of the Supreme
Court namely Gangadhar @ Gangaram vs State of Madhya Pradesh (Criminal Appeal No.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6411202/ 5
Tasleem N P @ Muhammed Thaslim Sp vs State Of Karnataka on 1 October, 2020
504/2020); Narcotics Control Bureau, Jodhpur vs Murlidhar Soni and Others [(2004) 5 SCC 151];
and Gian Chand and Others vs State of Haryana [(2013) 14 SCC 420]. All these decisions cannot be
made applicable for, they are all post conviction appeals; the yardstick to be applied for deciding a
bail application is not same as assessing the whole case after conclusion of trial.
13. The High Court of Delhi may have granted bail to the accused as may be seen in its decisions in
the case of Harpreet Singh Bahad vs DRI, and Kamaljeet Singh vs H.K.Pandey, Intelligence Officer,
NCB, that the counsel for petitioner in Crl. P. No. 3383/2020 has cited. In these cases, the decision
to grant bail was based on given circumstances. Here in these petitions, there are prima materials
against the petitioner, section 37 of the NDPS Act is very much attracted. Therefore, the petitions
are dismissed.
