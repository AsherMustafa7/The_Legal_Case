ORAL JUDGMENT
Date : 11-03-2019 Heard learned counsel for the petitioners; learned A.P.P. for the State and learned
counsel for the opposite party no. 2.
2. The Court finds that the present application is not maintainable as the complainant has not been
made a party.
3. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that he has made the Company, of which the
complainant was the owner, a party. The Court finds such stand to be thoroughly misconceived. It is
an absurd preposition that a party will choose whom to make Patna High Court CR. MISC.

Nikhil Malhotra And Anr vs State Of Bihar And Anr on 11 March, 2019
No.49108 of 2014 dt.11-03-2019 party, especially in a case which has been filed being aggrieved by a
complaint case filed by any other party. It is not the discretion of the person who assails such filing
of the complaint case as to whom he will make a party, for the law requires that the person who has
filed the complaint, to which there is challenge, has to be mandatorily made a party.
4. Faced with the situation, learned counsel for the petitioners sought permission to make necessary
correction in the description of the opposite party no. 2. Let the same be done during the course of
the day.
5. The petitioners have moved the Court under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973
for the following relief.
"That this is an application on behalf of the petitioner under section 482 of the Code
of Criminal Procedure, 1973 for quashing of the order of cognizance dated 02.07.2014
by which cognizance has been taken u/s 420, 406/34 of the Indian Penal Code
against the petitioner and one M.B. Pandey, Senior Marketing Manager by Sri Shashi
Bhushan Kumar, Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Bhagalpur in complaint case no. 1561
of 2013."
6. The opposite party no. 2, has filed complaint case against the petitioners alleging that
fraudulently the cheque given by him to them had been presented in the Bank. It was further alleged
that one of the cheques which was presented was with Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.49108 of
2014 dt.11-03-2019 dishonest intention and further the petitioners sending legal notice with regard
to non payment of the cheque amount, the same was also with dishonest intention as the opposite
party no. 2 claimed not issuing any cheque.
7. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the mala fide intention of the opposite party
no. 2 would be clear from the fact that purely civil business dispute has been given criminal colour
only for the purposes of taking undue advantage and, thus, clearly it is an abuse of the process of the
Court. It was submitted that the opposite party no. 2 does not dispute that at the time of getting into
an agreement with the petitioners, he had given two cheques, which were to be used, if required. It
was submitted that as per the account maintained by the petitioners, when the amount exceed Rs.
1,00,000/- one of the cheques was utilized to recover the amount and, thus, if the opposite party no.
2 has any dispute with regard to whether the amount was due to him, it is a matter of accounting
after verifying from the records and cannot be made the subject matter of a criminal proceeding.
Learned counsel submitted that the said cheque for Rs. 1,05,020/- was in fact not encashed and,
thus, the petitioners had sent legal notice through learned counsel to the opposite party no.2 and
this had prompted him to file the present case. Learned counsel submitted that the Patna High
Court CR. MISC. No.49108 of 2014 dt.11-03-2019 irony is that the opposite party no. 2 never
disputed that the said cheque was given to the petitioners by way of security. It was submitted that
once this fact is not disputed, the obvious intention on part of both the parties was that, if the need
arises, the said cheques would be encashed. Thus, learned counsel contended that the opposite party
no. 2 could not have expected or cannot take the stand in law that though he had given cheques to
the petitioners for use if required, but the same should not be utilized. It was submitted that if such
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130208438/ 2
Nikhil Malhotra And Anr vs State Of Bihar And Anr on 11 March, 2019
contention is accepted, it would clearly prove that in fact, the intention to commit cheating and
fraud was on the part of the opposite party no. 2, when he gives the cheques voluntarily to the
petitioners but with the intention that they should not use it.
8. Learned A.P.P. and learned counsel for the opposite party no. 2 submitted that the Court below
has found material and taken cognizance.
9. Learned counsel for the opposite party no. 2 further submitted that the petitioners had raised
demand which was not tenable and, thus, they could not have utilized the cheque for recovery of
such amount. It was further submitted that the business between the parties was going on smoothly
and whatever amount the opposite party no. 2 owed to the petitioners was being Patna High Court
CR. MISC. No.49108 of 2014 dt.11-03-2019 regularly paid. However, on a query of the Court as to
with what intention had he given the cheque to the petitioners, if they were not to be utilized,
learned counsel could not give any answer. Further, on a query of the Court as to why the matter was
not taken before a Civil Court as it was a pure question of settlement of accounts under a business
deal and agreement between the parties, once again, learned counsel did not have any answer.
10. Having considered the facts and circumstances of the case and submissions of learned counsel
for the parties, in the opinion of the Court, a case for interference has been made out.
11. As has rightly been submitted by learned counsel for the petitioners, there cannot be any
grievance, much less any criminal motive attributable to the petitioners for having used the cheque
which is not claimed to have been forcibly taken or stolen from the opposite party no. 2. Thus, once
the cheques have admittedly been given to the petitioners, by the opposite party no. 2 himself,
without any coercion or duress, the obvious implication in law is that the person who receives the
cheque, would be entitled to its encashment. Thus, if the petitioners had got the cheque and sent the
cheque for encashment, no wrong can be attributed to them. If the petitioners did not want the
cheques given to him to be presented to the Bank by the petitioners, he Patna High Court CR. MISC.
No.49108 of 2014 dt.11-03-2019 should not have given the cheque in the first place, but once he had
given the cheques, he cannot take a plea that wrongly it has been sent for encashment. Moreover,
when clearly the stand of the opposite party no. 2 is that he did not owe any money to the
petitioners, but still the cheques had been given to the petitioners, it is proved that the dispute/issue
is purely civil relating to money. Thus, for the same, criminal proceeding is clearly not maintainable
and an abuse of the process of the Court.
12. In this connection, it would be relevant to refer the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
the case of Indian Oil Corpn. v. NEPC India Ltd. reported as (2006) 6 SCC 736, where at paragraph
no. 13 it has been observed as under:
"13. ........ Any effort to settle civil disputes and claims, which do not involve any criminal offence, by
applying pressure through criminal prosecution should be deprecated and discouraged......"
13. Moreover, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of State of Haryana vs. Bhajan Lal reported as
1992 Supp (1) SCC 335, at paragraph no. 102 has laid down various categories under which the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130208438/ 3
Nikhil Malhotra And Anr vs State Of Bihar And Anr on 11 March, 2019
Court ought to exercise its inherent power under Section 482 of the Code. The same reads as under:
"102. In the backdrop of the interpretation of the various relevant provisions of the
Code under Chapter XIV and of the principles of law enunciated by this Court Patna
High Court CR. MISC. No.49108 of 2014 dt.11-03-2019 in a serious of decisions
relating to the exercise of the extraordinary power under Article 226 or the inherent
powers under Section 482 of the Code which we have extracted and reproduced
above, we give the following categories of cases by way of illustration wherein such
power could be exercised either to prevent abuse of the process of any court or
otherwise to secure the ends of justice, though it may not be possible to lay down any
precise, clearly defined and sufficiently channelised and inflexible guidelines or rigid
formulae and to give an exhaustive list of myriad kinds of cases wherein such power
should be exercised.
(1) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the complaint, even
if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie
constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused.
(2) Where the allegations in the first information report and other materials, if any,
accompanying the FIR do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an
investigation by police officers under Section 156 (1) of the Code except under an
order of a Magistrate within the purview of Section 155(2) of the Code.
(3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or complaint and the
evidence collected in support of the same do not disclose the commission of any
offence and make out a case against the accused.
(4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable offence but
constitute only a non-cognizable offence, no investigation is permitted by a police
officer without an order of a Magistrate as contemplated under Section 155(2) of the
Code.
(5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently
improbable on the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion
that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused.
(6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of the Code
or Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.49108 of 2014 dt.11-03-2019 the concerned Act
(under which a criminal proceeding is instituted) to the institution and continuance
of the proceedings and/or where there is a specific provision in the Code or the
concerned Act, providing efficacious redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party.
(7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and/or where
the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130208438/ 4
Nikhil Malhotra And Anr vs State Of Bihar And Anr on 11 March, 2019
vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and personal
grudge."
14. In the opinion of the Court, the present case is covered under category 7 of the aforesaid
judgment in Bhajan Lal (supra) at paragraph no. 102.
15. Similarly, in the case of State of Karnataka v. L. Muniswamy reported as (1977) 2 SCC 699, at
paragraph no. 7, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed as under:
"7. .........In the exercise of this wholesome power, the High Court is entitled to quash
a proceeding if it comes to the conclusion that allowing the proceeding to continue
would be an abuse of the process of the Court or that the ends of justice require that
the proceeding ought to be quashed. The saving of the High Court's inherent powers,
both in civil and criminal matters, is designed to achieve a salutary public purpose
which is that a Court proceeding ought not to be permitted to degenerate into a
weapon of harassment or persecution. In a criminal case, the veiled object behind a
lame prosecution, the very nature of the material on which the structure of the
prosecution rests and the like would justify the High Court in quashing the
proceeding in the interest of justice......"
Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.49108 of 2014 dt.11-03-2019
16. In the aforesaid background, the Court finds that the complaint case has been filed with mala
fide intention, for wreaking vengeance against the petitioners and to harass them.
17. Accordingly, the application is allowed. The entire criminal proceeding arising out of Complaint
Case no. 1561 of 2013, including the order taking cognizance dated 02.07.2014 passed by the
Judicial Magistrate 1st Class, Bhagalpur, stand quashed.
