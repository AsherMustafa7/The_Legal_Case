ORDER
This Criminal Revision Petition has been preferred by the accused to set aside the judgement dated

Judge, Coimbatore, confirming the judgement dated 13.01.2015 made in S.C.No.192/2010 on the

2. For the sake of convenience of discussion the appellant is referred as per his rank (as A-3).
3. The facts of the case in brief are as follows:
On 24.01.2010, there was a dispute with regard to sharing of wages among A-1 and
three others with one Ramesh, who is the son of de facto complainant. In view of that
a police complaint has been given and an FIR was registered in Cr.Nos.98/2010 and
100/2010 of the Kothanur Police Station. On the same day itself, some of the accused
have been arrested in the said case but A-1 was absconding; and he had an intention
to do away https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis with the complainant’s family in view of
his previous enmity with the son of de facto complainant.
3.1. On 28.01.2010 at about 11.30 pm, A-1 to A-3 with a common intention trespassed
into the house of the de facto complainant. They had the intention to murder the de
facto complainant and her daughter; while both were sleeping inside the room, the
accused poured petrol on them by telling that they would kill their entire family by
setting fire on them. The de facto complainant and her daughter rushed outside and
escaped.
Enraged over that, the accused set fire on the house of the de facto complainant and damaged their
properties worth around of Rs.5,000/-.
3.2. On the complaint (Ex.P.1) given by PW.1-Raja Lakshmi, an FIR (Ex.P.6) was registered in Crime
No.109/2010 for the offence under sec. 147, 452 and 307 IPC by PW.8- Parveen Banu, the Sub

occurrence and prepared Observation https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Mahazaar (Ex.P.2) and

their confession statements (Ex.P.4) in the presence of witnesses PW.6 and one Pandian and

under secs. 450, 436 and 307 IPC.
3.4. After completing the investigation, charge sheet has been laid down under Secs.447, 307 and
436 IPC. The case was taken on file by the learned Judicial Magistrate-VII, Coimbatore in
PRC.No.27/2010 and after observing the due legal formalities, the case was committed to the
learned Principal Sessions Judge, Coimbatore. After the case was taken on file, the case was
assigned to the file of the learned Second Additional Assistant https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
Sessions Judge for conducting trial. The learned sessions judge framed the charges against A-1 for
the offences under Secs.447, 307, 436 IPC and under Sec. 449, 309 r/w 34 IPC against A2 and A3
and questioned the accused. The accused pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.

Objects seized from the place of occurrence. PW.3- Vasanthi is the neighbour of PW.1
and 2 and she stayed along with her child in the place of occurrence on 25.10.2010
and was sleeping with PW.1 and 2. So, she also witnessed the occurrence and gave
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis evidence on this aspect.
5.1. P.W.4-Jayaraj, is the relative of PW.1 and 2 and he knew about the earlier dispute
between A-1 and the son of PW.1. In the said dispute the husband of PW.1 was
arrested along with other accused and the son of PW.1 was attacked. Since the son of
PW.1-Ramesh was admitted in the hospital, PW.4 visited him in the hospital and
then came to the house of PW.1. After having dinner he went outside and was
conversing with his neighbour. At about 11.30 pm, he heard the noise made by PW.1,
2 and 3 and rushed to the place of occurrence and found A-1 and others were
running. He came to know from PW.1 that A-1 had set the house on fire.
5.2. P.W.5-Ananth is the husband of PW.3. He also had knowledge about the earlier
enmity between the accused and PW.1’s husband. In the earlier case, the husband of

7. Heard, Mr.C.Prabhakaran learned counsel for the petitioner and Mr.A.Gopinath, learned
Government Advocate (Crl.Side) appearing for the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
respondent/State.
8. The learned counsel for the petitioners/accused 1 to 3 submitted that the trial Court has passed
the judgement without considering the material contradiction found in the evidences of PW.1 to 9;
as per the evidence of PW.7- scientific expert, petrol was not detected on the material objects seized
from the place of occurrence and that would earn the benefit of doubt in favour of the accused; the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/192251779/ 4
Babu vs State Rep. By on 23 December, 2021
accused were not properly identified; and the Courts below have convicted the accused basing on the
evidences of the interested witnesses and hence he prayed to set-aside the judgement of the learned
First Appellate Court.
9. The learned Government Advocate (Crl. Side) appearing for the State, submitted that PW.1, 2 & 5
are the eyewitnesses and they have spoken about the occurrence in a consistent manner and there is
no reason to reject their evidences. He further submitted that there is no material inconsistencies in
the evidences of the eyewitnesses hence the Criminal Revision should be dismissed.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
10. Point for consideration:
Whether the conviction and sentence of A-1 for the of- fences under Sec.307, 436 and
448 IPC; A2 and A3 for the offences under Sec.307 r/w 34, 436 r/w 34 and 448 IPC
imposed by the Trial Court as confirmed by the First Appellate Court basing on the
materials available on record is fair and prop- er?
11. The complainant, PW.1- Rajalakshmi and her daughter PW.2 were present in the house on the
night of the occurrence. There was previous enmity between the complainant’s family and A-1 in
connection with sharing of wages among A-1 and others along with the son of PW.1 and it had
resulted in a criminal case. In the said case the husband of PW.1 was also arrested along with some
of the accused. Hence PW.1 and 2 were alone at their house. In order to feel safe PW.1 requested the
husband of PW.3 namely Ananth (PW.5) to send his wife and child to her house and to sleep there.
So PW.5 sent his wife and child to the house of PW.1. At about https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
11.30 pm, PW.1 and 2 heard someone talking outside their door. PW.1 opened the door and saw that
A-1 coming with A-2 and A-3 and A-1 was holding a petrol Can. After coming there, A-1 poured the
kerosene on PW.1 and 2. PW.1 and 2 escaped through the other door. So the accused got angry and
burnt household articles of PW.1. These events have been coherently stated by PW.1 and her
evidence was corroborated with the evidence of PW.2. PW.3 who was sleeping along with PW.1 and
2 have also stated about the violence caused by the accused during that night.
12. PW.4 is the relative of PW.1 and he had been into the house of PW.1 on the night of occurrence
incidentally, after visiting the husband of PW.1 at hospital. He had also stated about the noise he
heard from the house of PW.1. The evidence PW.1 to 4 who were present at the time of occurrence
are consistent and reliable. There is no reason for PW.3, 4 and 5 to implicate the accused falsely in
this case. Though there was previous enmity between PW.1’s husband and A-1, PW.1 and 2 did not
have any enmity with him. A.1 to A.3 gained access into the house of PW.1 by committing trespass
when the ladies were alone at night. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
13. The learned counsel for the revision petitioner submitted that A2-and A3 were merely present in
the scene of crime and they did not participate in any offence as stated above. A.1 was found to be
having petrol cane while coming to the house of PW1 and so it is obvious that A2 and A3 who
accompanied him knew about the intention of A1. They neither prevented A1 from causing violence
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/192251779/ 5
Babu vs State Rep. By on 23 December, 2021
nor went away from him. They participated in the occurrence along with A1 and that would show
about their common intention. Despite there are some minor contradiction in the evidence of the
eyewitnesses that did not create any strong suspicion, so as to demolish the case of the prosecution.
14. Since the prosecution had proved the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubts the courts
below did not find any reason to reject the same and thus convicted the accused.
15. It is submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that some of the material witnesses have
been omitted to be cross examined https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis despite the petition was filed
under Sec.311 Cr.P.C for recalling the witnesses and got it allowed. The tabulation shown in the
judgement of the First Appellate Court mentions that A1 to A2 did not make use of the opportunity
and cross examine PW.1 to P.W.5.
16. The learned First Appellate Judge relied on the judgement rendered by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in Vinoth Kumar Vs. State of Pubjab [Crl.A.No.554/2012 dated 21.01.2015] in order to
support his finding that the cross examination of the witnesses cannot be deferred for a long time. In
this case, the opportunity to recall PW.1 to 4 was granted by way of allowing the petition filed for
that reason. Despite that, the revision petitioner omitted to pay batta and cross examine the
witnesses PW.1 to P.W.3. There is no exceptional circumstance or extraneous reason seem to be
present for justifying the conduct of the accused in not cross examining PW.1 to 4. It is well within
the knowledge of the accused that PW.1 to 4 are material witnesses and they have to be cross
examined. In fact the petitioners have chosen to file a recall petition after they were questioned
under Sec.313 Cr.P.C. Despite the petition was allowed on 08.04.2015, the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis petitioner and the other accused did not choose to pay batta to
summon PW.1 to P.W.4. Thereafter A-1 remained absent and NBW was issued. When NBW was
pending against A-1, A-2 and A-3 remained absent and Non Bailable warrants were issued once
again against them. After a considerable length of time, A-2 and A-3 have chosen to surrender and
NBW was recalled at their request. A-1 remained absconding and thereafter he was secured. Once
again a petition was filed under Sec.311 Cr.P.C, on 03.12.2014 and the same was returned. The
petitioners neither represented the said 311 petition nor challenged the order of return or any other
order passed in 311 petition, filed by them on 02.12.2014. The accused had purposefully evaded to
cross examine the witnesses and thereafter jumped out of the bail.
17. The learned counsel for the revision petitioner/A-3 submitted that the failure to cross examine
PW.1 to 4 would prejudice the interest of A-1 to A-3 and that would amount to denial of opportunity
to trial. He further submitted that the case may be remanded back to the trial Court for the purpose
of giving opportunity to the petitioner to cross examine PWs.1 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis to
4. A fair trial does not mean giving unlimited time for cross examining the witnesses. Sec.311
Cr.P.C., filed by the accused for recalling the witnesses was allowed. But the accused failed to pay
batta to summon the witnesses and also jumped out bail.
18. The conduct of the accused would show that they waived their right to cross examine the above
witnesses. So it is right for the Courts below to rely on the evidence of the prosecution and found
that the accused is guilty. Hence I don’t find any reason for interference.
