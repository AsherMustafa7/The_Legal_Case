(ii) For further direction to
respondent authorities to select the petitioner who having Ist position in merit list.
(iii) For any other appropriate relief/ reliefs."
2. At this juncture, the Learned counsel for the respondents contended that Section 32(iii) of the
Bihar Targeted Public Distribution System (Control) Order, 2016 provides for the provision of
appeal and Section 32(vi) of the Bihar Targeted Public Distribution System (Control) Order, 2016
provides for the provision of revision.
Section 32(iii) 32(v) and 32(vi) read as follows:
32 (iii). Any person aggrieved by an order of the licensing authority denying the issue
or renewal of the license to the fair price shop owner or cancellation of the license
may appeal to the District Officer within Patna High Court CWJC No.11514 of 2019
dt.07-10-2025 thirty days of the date of receipt of the order and the District
Magistrate shall, as far as practicable, dispose the appeal within a period of sixty
days.
32. (v) Till the disposal of appeal pending, the Appellate Authority may direct that the
order under appeal shall not take effect for such period as the authority may consider
necessary for giving a reasonable opportunity to the other party under sub-clause (4)
or until the appeal is disposed of, whichever is earlier.
(vi) Due to non disposal of the appeal within sixty days by the District Officer or against the order
passed in the appeal, a revision may be filed before the Divisional Commissioner. The revision shall
be disposed of within two months.
3. Admittedly, from the reliefs prayed for in the writ petition, it is evident that the petitioner has an
alternative remedy under the provisions of Bihar Targeted Public Distribution System (Control)
Order, 2016.
Patna High Court CWJC No.11514 of 2019 dt.07-10-2025
4. The remedy available under the Act is to prefer an appeal before the District Magistrate. As the
District Magistrate is the head of the Selection Committee he cannot review his orders in an appeal.
Therefore, the petitioner is directed to file a complaint/application before the Divisional
Commissioner.

5. The Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that he intends to file a complaint/application
before the concerned authority, but the limitation period for filing the same has lapsed. He prayed
for a direction to the concerned authority to entertain the same in accordance with Section 5 of the
Limitation Act.
6. Taking into consideration that the petitioner has an alternative remedy for filing
complaint/application, the writ petition is disposed of with a direction to the petitioner to file
complaint/application within one month from the date of receipt of this order before the concerned
authority. The delay in filing the complaint/application shall be condoned by the Patna High Court
CWJC No.11514 of 2019 dt.07-10-2025 authority concerned, and the authority shall dispose of the
same within three months from the date of filing of the same.
