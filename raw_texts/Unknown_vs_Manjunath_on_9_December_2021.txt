The State has preferred this criminal appeal against the order of acquittal passed by the learned
Principal District and Sessions Judge, Krishnagiri, in S.C.No.160 of 2016, dated 01.08.2017.

2.Initially, a case was registered by the Deputy Superintendent of Police, All Women Police Station,
Hosur, in Crime No.15 of 2011 for the alleged commission of the offences under Sections 417, 376
and 506(ii) of IPC read with Section 3(2)(r) of SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities), Amendment Act,
1989 and after investigation, based on the statements of the witnesses and documents, the
Investigation Officer has laid a charge sheet for the offences under Sections 417, 376 and 506(i) IPC
r/w. Section 3(1) (x) and 3(1)(xii) of SC/ST (POA) Act. The consequences quoted by the learned
Sessions Judge in her Judgment is found to be incorrect. However, the learned Sessions Judge,
taking into consideration the date of occurrence being 17.05.2010, has framed the charges under
Sections 376 and 506(i) IPC r/w. Section 3(1) (x) and 3(1)(xii) of SC/ST (POA) Act. [It appears that
the learned Sessions has passed the order based under amendment Act and not based upon the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/2351901/ 1
Unknown vs Manjunath on 9 December, 2021
charges framed during trial on 06.10.2016].
3.The sum and substance of the final report is that the accused belonged to Boyer Community
(MBC) and PW1 belongs to Adidravida Community aged about 16 years. On 17.05.2010, at about
12.00 noon against the will of PW1/victim girl, on false promise to marry her, the
respondent/accused had https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis physical relationship with her and made
PW1 pregnant and when the parents of PW1 viz., PW2, PW3 and PW4/brother of PW3 asked the
accused to marry PW1, he uttered caste words and thereby, committed the offence as stated supra.
4(a).The case of the prosecution is that the accused viz., Manjunath belongs to Boyer Community, a
Section of community enlisted under MBC community and the victim girl viz., Roopa, aged about 16
years belongs to Adidravida Community. The accused had love affair with the victim girl. While so,
on 17.05.2010 at about 12.00 p.m., the accused came to the house of PW1 and on promising to
marry her, had sexual intercourse with the victim girl, without her consent and threatened her that
if she discloses the matter to others, he will kill her and her mother. Thereafter, several times, the
accused had sexual intercourse with the victim girl without her consent, due to that, the victim girl
got pregnancy. When the parents of P.W.1 asked the accused to marry her, the accused refused to
marry and abused that "gu eha;';fsh! gu $hjpapy bghwe;Jl;L cdf;F Boyer Community igad; nfl;Fjh"
and also threatened with dire consequences.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 4(b).Hence, the victim girl has given a complaint and based on the
said complaint, a case was registered in Crime No.15 of 2011, in All Women Police Station, Hosur,
for the offences under sections 417, 376, 506(i) of IPC read with Section 3(2)(r) of SC/ST Act 1989
on 17.08.2011.
4(c).After completion of thorough and detailed investigation, based on the statements of the
witnesses and documents, the investigation officer has laid charge sheet for the offences under
Sections 417, 376 and 506(i) of IPC read with Section 3(1)(x) & 3(1) (xii) of SC/ST (POA) Act against
the accused and the same was submitted before the Judicial Magistrate Court No.II, Hosur and the
number was assigned as PRC.No.15 of 2011. Subsequently, the case was committed to Court of
Sessions and learned Principal District and Sessions Judge, Krishnagiri, has taken the case on file in
S.C.No.160 of 2016.
4(d).During the course of trial, on behalf prosecution, PW1 to PW11 were examined and Exs.P1 to
P21 were marked. On behalf of the defence, no witness has been examined and no document has
been marked.
4(e).The learned Principal District and Sessions Court, Krishnagiri after full-fledged trial, by an
order dated 01.08.2017, has acquitted the accused from https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis the
charges under Sections 376 and 506(i) of IPC and Sections 3(1)(r) & 3(1)(s) of SC/ST (POA) Act.
Aggrieved against the said order of acquittal, the State has preferred this Criminal Appeal before this
Court.

5.Heard Mr.R.Vinoth Raja, learned Government Advocate (Crl.Side) appearing for the State and
Mr.A.Balamurugan, learned counsel appearing for the respondent/accused and also perused the
materials placed on record.
6.The learned Government Advocate appearing for the State/appellant would contend that the Trial
Court has not appreciated the version of the prosecuterix in proper prospective and committed an
error in acquitting the accused on flimsy grounds.
7.The learned counsel for the respondent/accused would contend that the age of the accused was
not proved in the manner known to law and the School Certificate cannot be taken as a proof for the
age and further, he would rely upon the Judgments in Crl.A.No.747 of 2007, dated 19.01.2010 and
Criminal Appeal No. 2308 of 2009, dated 04.12.2009.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
8.In reply, the learned Government Advocate would contend that a snap answer given by
PW1/victim girl is outcome of factum that she is an illiterate woman belongs to Gandhi Nagari,
Hanlet of Pommandapalli Village in Hosur Taluk in Krishnagiri District and she is a Telugu
speaking girl and working in the agricultural field.
9(a).After hearing both the parties and also taking note of the oral and documentary evidence viz.,
Exs.P1 & Ex.P6, this Court finds that a case was registered in Crime No.15 of 2011 for the offences
under Sections 417, 376 and 506(i) of IPC read with Section 3(2)(V) of SC/ST Act, 1989. The alleged
occurrence took place on 17.05.2010 in the house of PW1 and the complaint was made only on
17.08.2011. The learned Sessions Judge has taken the delay to disbelieve the version of PW1.
9(b). As per Ex.P20/ School Certificate issued by Head Master of P.U.M.School, Bommandapally,
Kothagondapally Post, Hosur Taluk, the date of birth of PW1 is 26.12.1996. The attendance sheet
and admission card were also marked. As per Ex.P21/birth certificate, PW1 gave birth to a female
child on 17.10.2011 at Government Hospital, Denkanikottai Road, Hosur. In other
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis words, two months after filing Ex.P1/complaint, PW1 gave birth to
a female baby and at the time of giving Ex.P1/complaint, she was eight months pregnant.
10.The question is as to whether the delay in preferring the complaint is fatal to the prosecution case
as observed by the learned Sessions Judge. Mere delay is not fatal but however, the point is whether
the delay has been properly explained by the prosecuterix or not is to be considered.
11.The delay in filing the complaint has been properly explained by the prosecution witnesses. PW1
was aged 15 years at the time of the occurrence and her evidence before the Court is clear and
cogent. The delay in filing the case is also spoken to by her convincingly. PW1 has given birth to a
female baby viz., Anushree. As per Ex.P7 to Ex.P9, the accused is the biological father of the child
and that was proved through the prosecution witnesses and documents.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/2351901/ 3
Unknown vs Manjunath on 9 December, 2021
12.Hence, taking note of the fact that PW1 hails from Denkanikottai, which is situated at the border
of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka State, she belongs to linguistic minority and also belongs to Schedule
Caste Community, working as a hard labour in the agricultural field. The delay has also been
properly https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis explained as, since there was a panchayat conducted
between the parties, wherein, family of PW1 had asked the accused to marry PW1 and since the
accused had refused their request and hence the delay. Hence, this Court finds that considering the
age of the victim girl and the action of PW2 in begging the accused to get PW1 marry and on the
refusal by the accused, the complaint has been lodged, when PW1 was eight months pregnant at the
age of 15 plus.
13.Age of the victim girl:
(a).The learned Sessions Judge has taken the snap answer given by P.W.1 in the
cross-examination regarding her age.
(b).Admittedly, PW1 is a poor literate girl and rustic girl living Hamlet of a village
near Thenkanikoota in Hosur Taluk. The age of the victim girl was 15 years at the
time of the occurrence. As per the School Record Sheet/Ex.P20 produced before the
trial Court, date of birth of PW1/victim girl is 26.12.1996 and the first day of rape was
on 17.05.2010. Hence, as per Ex.P20, on the date of occurrence, PW1 was aged 15
years. The prosecution has proved the age of the victim through the witnesses and
documents. Hence, the finding rendered by the trial Court that there is no school
records was filed for determining the age of the victim girl is erroneous and the same
is against the established principles of law, as held by the Hon'ble Apex Court in
several judgments.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
(c).It remains to be stated that as per Ex.P20, at the time of the occurrence, PW1 was aged 15 years
and hence, in view of the definition under Section 375 of I.P.C, her consent is immaterial.
14.On a perusal of the records, it is seen that the victim girl was examined as PW1; father of the
victim girl was examined as PW2; mother of the victim girl was examined as PW3; PW4 is the
brother of PW3; while PW15, PW5 & PW6 are the revenue witnesses, who had issued community
certificate for the accused and PW1 under Exs.P3 & P4.
15.On perusal of Ex.P1/complaint and the evidence of PW1, I find that PW1 is a member of the
Scheduled Caste community and his father was engaged in agricultural coolie for driving the tractor.
Further, the accused has approached PW1 to have a sexual intercourse and the same was resisted by
her and then, the accused has made two attempts. Subsequently, on 17.05.2010 at about 12.00 p.m.,
the accused came to the house of PW1 and on promising to marry her, had sexual intercourse with
her, despite her resistance. The accused also threatened her not to disclose the same to others. Few
months after, PW2/father of P.W.1/victim girl has found bulging of the stomach of PW1 and
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis when PW2 and PW3 had repeatedly enquired, she had disclosed
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/2351901/ 4
Unknown vs Manjunath on 9 December, 2021
the factum of the physical relationship had with the accused and thereafter, they went to meet a
Doctor and the Doctor has confirmed the pregnancy.
16(a).Thereafter, the parents of PW1 approached the accused and requested him to marry PW1, but
the accused has refused to marry P.W.1, since the accused belonged to Boyer Community, which is a
lower community included in M.B.C category list and the victim belongs to Schedule Caste
Community. Hence, the victim girl/PW1 has given a complaint/Ex.P1 on 17.08.2011, before the All
Women Police Station, Hosur and on the basis of the said complaint, a case was registered in Crime
No.15 of 2011 and it was taken on file as S.C.No.160 of 2016 before the learned Principal District and
Sessions Judge, Krishnagiri and the learned Judge has referred the victim girl to medical
examination.
16(b).PW7/Dr.Nandhini had examined PW1/victim girl and issued Ex.P5/Medical Examination
Report by stating that PW1/victim girl is 7 months pregnant and after three months, she gave birth
to a female baby by name Anusri on 07.10.2011, and the same has been reflected in Ex.P21/Birth
Certificate. Subsequently, at the request of the Investigation Officer, the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis learned Judicial Magistrate has sent both P.W.1 and the accused
to D.N.A test under Exs.P11 & P12 and the Doctor has opined that the accused viz., Manjunath is the
biological father of the female child Anusree born to P.W.1 and the Doctor's confirmation report was
marked as Ex.P10.
17(a). The learned Sessions Judge appears to have been swayed by the answer and the act of
P.W.3/mother of the accused that after the birth of the female child, they have solemnized the
marriage of PW1 with one Raghu and accordingly, the learned Judge has held that the subsequent
marriage of the victim girl with one Raghu is a ground for acquittal.
17(b). This Court is unable to affix the seal of approval for such a finding. The strata of the society to
which P.W.1 belongs and the area in which the family of PW1 are residing itself has to be considered.
P.W.3 being mother of P.W.1, to save her face in the society and to save the name and fame of the
family, they have found a man by name Raghu in the village and solemnized the marriage so as to
give a social protection for the poor innocent victim girl/P.W.1, since P.W.1 was below 16 years at
the relevant point of time. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
18.It is stated by PW1 that on a false promise to marry her, the accused raped her and made her
pregnant. The subsequent conduct of P.W3/mother of PW1, in conducting the marriage of the
victim girl with one Raghu cannot be a ground for acquittal of the accused in a rape of a minor girl.
The consent of the minor is not a consent in the eye of law and hence, I find that the same was not
taken note of by the learned Session Judge and accordingly, the said finding of the learned Sessions
Judge hereby stands vacated.
19.A good hearted man magnanimously married the victim girl/PW1 is not a ground to exonerate
the accused from the charges framed against him under Sections 376, 506(i) of IPC read with
Section 3(1)(x) & 3(1)(xii) of SC/ST Act. The accused has refused to marry PW1/victim girl on the
ground that she belongs to Schedule Caste Community. When the accused refused to marry
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/2351901/ 5
Unknown vs Manjunath on 9 December, 2021
PW1/victim girl, the parents of P.W.1 arranged the marriage of P.W.1 with one Raghu, who is a
relative of her. In this case, not only the victim girl but also her female child Anushree are suffering
in the society.
20.At the risk of repetition, however for the sake of clarity, in view of the documentary evidence of
Ex.P20/School Record Sheet, the date of birth of P.W.1 is 26.12.1996 and at the time of occurrence,
PW1 was aged 15 years. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis The first day of the rape was on
17.05.2010 and at the time of giving Ex.P1/complaint, she was found to be 7 months pregnant and
subsequently, she gave birth to a female child by name Anushree.
21.As per Exs.P7 to P9, the accused is the biological father of the child and as per Ex.P8, the accused
is found to be man of potent and hence, the learned Sessions Judge has committed an error in brush
aside the medical evidence produced by the prosecution viz., Ex.P14/Certificate issued by PW10/Dr.
Gokularaman, wherein, the doctor has opined as follows:
"Opinion: There is nothing to suggest that he is impotent"
22.Hence, on a combined reading of the oral evidence of P.W.1 which is found to be materially
corroborated by the medical evidence of P.W.7/Dr.Nandhini coupled with the medical evidence of
P.W.10/Dr.Gokularaman along with Ex.P5/medical report, Ex.P10/D.N.A report issued to the
accused and Ex.P14/Certificate issued by the doctor, this Court finds that the version of P.W.1
stands duly corroborated with the aforementioned documentary evidences and P.W.1 was below 16
years at the time of the occurrence and she was found to be 7 months pregnancy at the date of the
filing of the complaint and the accused is man of potent as per medical
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis records and PW1 gave birth to a female child by name Anushree
and the accused is found to be the biological father of the baby Anushree born to P.W.1.
23.The learned Sessions Judge has rendered a finding that coming to the existence of
Ex.P1/complaint, it is doubtful at the instance of PW1. After perusing the evidence of PW1 and also
taking note of the fact that PW1 had signed on Ex.P1/complaint in Telugu and so is also the
signature of the student found in Ex.P21/School Register. This Court has given its anxious
consideration and found that the learned Sessions Judge has failed to appreciate the evidence of
PW1 and the evidence of PW8 in proper prospective.
24.It is a specific evidence of PW1/Ruba that she went to give a complaint to the writer, head
constable, in Telugu and the same was translated into Tamil and so is the evidence of PW10/Chitra,
who had registered Ex.P1/Complaint as Ex.P6/FIR.
25.It is a specific evidence of PW8/Devi that since PW1 was studied in Telugu medium in
Thenkannikottai Village, she has given the complaint orally in Telugu and the same was translated
into Tamil. This Court has judicial notice https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis of the fact that
Thenkanikottai Village at Hosur Taluk is a triple point junction for State of Tamil Nadu, Andhra
Pradesh and Karnataka and people are of all the three languages used to reside and in the schools in
the said locality, both Telugu and Kannada were tough as per the Government of Tamil Nadu

Unknown vs Manjunath on 9 December, 2021
Education Policy. Hence, the version of PW1 regarding her complaint to the police and the said
complaint was translated into Tamil by PW8/Inspector of Police cannot be found fault with and
hence, the learned Sessions Judge has failed to appreciate the evidence of these two witnesses in
proper prospective. Hence, the finding rendered by the learned Sessions Judge as to coming into
existence of Ex.P6 is hereby stands vacated and based upon the above said analysis, it is held that
Ex.P1 and Ex.P6 were taken into existence as delivered by P.W.1 and the prosecution has
successfully proved the registration of the complaint at the instance of P.W.1.
26(a) .With regard to charge under Section 376 of IPC, this Court finds that the evidence of PW1
inspires the confidence of this Court. Furthermore, it remains to be stated that there is nothing in
the cross-examination to discredit her evidence. Except the fact that subsequent to the complaint
and subsequent to the birth of the child, she got married a person in their relatives circle and hence,
the snap answer given by PW1 in the cross-examination as to her age
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis cannot be put against her. Accordingly, the finding rendered by
the learned Sessions Judge as to the age of PW1/victim girl is erroneous and the same is hereby
stands vacated. The learned Sessions Judge has erred in brush asiding the medical records.
26(b). This Court finds that the delay in filing the complaint has been properly explained and the
same is not fatal to the prosecution case. The age of the victim girl on the date of the occurrence is
held to be 15 years and consequently, the consent said to have been given by the victim girl is
immaterial and on promising to marry P.W.1, the accused had physical relationship with her and
made her pregnant. Subsequently, P.W.1 gave birth to a female baby viz., Anushree and hence, I find
that the charge under Section 376 of IPC has been proved by the prosecution beyond reasonable
doubt and accordingly, the finding of the learned Sessions Judge in respect of the acquittal of the
accused from the charge under Section 376 I.P.C, stands vacated and the respondent/accused shall
stands convicted for the said charge viz., under Section 376 of IPC.
27.As per the evidence of PW1, when the parents of PW1 went to meet the accused and asked to get
her marry, the accused said to have uttered the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis caste words by
saying that he was not responsible for pregnancy. The evidence of PW1 was not supported by the
evidence of PW2 and PW3 and hence, the charge under Section 3(i)(x) of SC&ST is not made out.
28.On perusal of the evidence of PW1, PW2 & PW3, the essential ingredients of Section 506(i) I.P.C
and the utterance of caste words as stated under Section 3(1)(x) & 3(1)(xii) of SC & ST Act are not
made out. Accordingly, the order of acquittal passed by the learned Principal District and Session
Judge, Krishnagiri, under Sections 3(1)(r) & 3(1)(s) of SC/ST Act (POA Act 1989), (as typed in the
judgment) is hereby confirmed. Further, the order of acquittal passed by the learned Sessions under
Section 506(i) IPC is also hereby confirmed.
29.In view of the fact that the accused has been acquitted by the learned Sessions Judge under
Section 376 IPC and the said order of acquittal has been set aside and now the accused stands
convicted in this appeal under the said Section, as to the point of sentence, the accused has to be
heard. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
