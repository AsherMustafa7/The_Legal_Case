2/17
Re : L.P.A. No. 1597 of 2018
The present appeal has been filed against an order
dated 18.05.2018 passed in C.W.J.C. No. 7494 of 2017 by the
learned Single Judge dismissing the writ application filed by the
appellant for setting aside an order dated 04.04.2016 issued by
the Deputy Director (Nomination) (respondent No. 3), whereby
and whereunder the candidature of the petitioner has been
cancelled and he has been debarred from appearing in any
examination held by the Staff Selection Commission
(hereinafter referred to as the 'SSC') for three years. In the said
writ petition a further prayer had been made to direct the
respondent to accept his joining after quashing the letter dated
11.04.2017
, whereby the offer of appointment issued to the petitioner has been cancelled. Aggrieved by the
impugned judgment of the learned Single Judge, the appellant has preferred the present intra court
appeal.
(i) The factual matix of the case dates back to the year 2013 when his application for Central Armed
Police Force (CAPF) selection, 2013 in which he qualified in all the physical, written and medical
test held at different places at Bihar and he was finally selected for the CISF, but on the pretext of
general enquiry the appointment letter was not issued to the petitioner Patna High Court L.P.A
No.1597 of 2018 dt.22-08-2019 and certain signatures and fingerprints were taken by the
authorities for verification.
(ii) In the year 2015, the petitioner again submitted an application for appointment on Constable
(GD) in CRPF Selection 2015 and was declared successful on provisional basis subject to fulfillment
of all eligibility criteria of the selection and, accordingly, his dossier was forwarded to the user
department for advice to issue offer of appointment only after thorough verification.
It is important to indicate here that the writ petitioner had been issued Registration I.D. No.

Manish Kumar Paswan vs The Union Of India And Ors on 22 August, 2019
51154620412 on-line and accordingly he appeared for physical eligibility test vide admit card
provided to him containing Roll No. 3201053958 fixing 03.07.2015 for the test at Centre CISF Unit
Kahalgaon, District Bhagalpur. Accordingly, the petitioner appeared for the physical test and
qualified in all the items of the physical eligibility test. He was then issued an admit-card for
appearing at the written test on 04.10.2015 with centre at Bhagalpur. The petitioner also qualified in
the written test. Thereafter, the petitioner appeared for a medical test on 15.05.2016 at 56th Bn.
SSB, Araria, Koshi Project Colony, Bathnaha, District-Araria in the State of Bihar. Having been
Patna High Court L.P.A No.1597 of 2018 dt.22-08-2019 found medically fit, his name was uploaded
on the website against the Statewise vacancies and ultimately in the declaration of force allocation of
provisional selected male candidate, he was shown to be selected in CRPF on 06.02.2017.
(iii) The petitioner was offered appointment for the post of Constable (General Duty) in the CRPF
vide No. 02/2017 dated 27.02.2017 from the office of the Deputy Inspector General of Police,
Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh and was directed to report for duty on 21.03.2017, with original documents
and testimonals (Annexure-6), but when he reported on 21.03.2017 in the office of the Deputy
Inspector General of Police, CRPF, Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh, his joining was not accepted and instead
he was handed over an order dated 04.04.2016 issued by the respondent SSC (Central Region,
Allahabad) under which he was informed with regard to the CAPF Selection, 2013 that it had been
found in an enquiry regarding the selections of 2013 that his signatures and left thumb impressions
differed at different stages and as such his candidature as well as selection in the CISF had been
cancelled as he stood debarred from participating in the SSC examinations for three years since
12.05.2013 i.e., till 12.05.2016 and therefore could not appear in the subsequent fresh selections the
exams whereof were held in Patna High Court L.P.A No.1597 of 2018 dt.22-08-2019 2016.
2. It was on the basis of the said letter dated 04.04.2016 (Annexure-7) that the joining of the
petitioner was refused vide memorandum of cancellation of offer of appointment dated 11.04.2017
issued from the office of the D.I.G.P., Group Centre, CRPF even though an offer of appointment had
been issued to him pursuant to a subsequent selection. Aggrieved by these two orders dated
04.04.2016 and 11.04.2017, the petitioner preferred the writ application giving rise to this appeal.
After hearing the parties, the learned Single Judge dismissed the writ application but while
considering the same he has not referred to the subsequent selection pursuant to the advertisement
of 2015 which came to form the basis of the present claim of the appellant.
3. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the office order dated 04.04.2016 as contained
in Annexure-7 is wholly illegal and arbitrary and was never received by the petitioner at any stage
nor was any enquiry report which forms the basis of the said order ever communicated to the
petitioner nor had he any knowledge about the same. It was rather at the time of joining pursuant to
a subsequent letter of offer of appointment, that the respondents have sprung up this wholly Patna
High Court L.P.A No.1597 of 2018 dt.22-08-2019 arbitrary order, by which he is said to have been
debarred from appearing in any examination for a period of three years. It was submitted that in
case, there was any incriminating enquiry report against the petitioner, he ought to have been issued
a show-cause notice calling him to explain as to why his candidature should not be cancelled, but the
respondents never followed any such procedure and have prevented him from joining on the basis of
the order dated 04.04.2016 though he was debarred from participating in the SSC examination
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127311444/ 3
Manish Kumar Paswan vs The Union Of India And Ors on 22 August, 2019
since 12.05.2013 for three years. The order dated 04.04.2016 has been issued after almost three
years of the first examination and even after the petitioner had participated in the subsequent
examination. Learned counsel for the petitioner thus contended that such an action on the part of
the respondents smacks of arbitrariness, discrimination and is a fit case that warrants interference
by this Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. He, thus, prayed for a writ in the nature
of Certiorari for quashing the orders dated 04.04.2016 and also order dated 11.04.2017
(Annexure-8) and as a consequence thereof, a mandamus to permit the petitioner to join on the post
of Constable (GD) in the CRPF as per the earlier offer of appointment.
Patna High Court L.P.A No.1597 of 2018 dt.22-08-2019
4. The case of the writ petitioner was squarely opposed by the respondents No. 2 and 3 in their
counter affidavits filed in the writ application who have brought on record the entire documents
including the report of the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (hereinafter referred to as the
'CFSL') in which the petitioner's handwriting and signatures were found to be at variance with the
signatures available at the time of conduct of the examination. It was submitted by the SSC that for
any selection by the Staff Selection Commission there is a three tier examination consisting of
Physical Standard Test/Physical Efficiency Test and written examination followed by medical
examination. It was thus submitted that the candidates were clearly instructed and cautioned
through para 2 of Important Instruction To Candidates of notice of the examination which is
extracted hereunder:-
"In view of the anticipated large number of applicants, scrutiny or the eligibility and
other aspects will not be undertaken before the PST/PET and written examination
and, therefore, the candidature will be accepted only provisionally.
Candidates are advised to go through the
requirements of educational qualification, age,
physical standard etc. and satisfy themselves that they are eligible for the posts,
before applying. Copies of supporting documents will be sought only from those
candidates who qualify for Medical Patna High Court L.P.A No.1597 of 2018
dt.22-08-2019 Examination. When scrutiny is undertaken after the examination, if
any claim made in the application is not found substantiated, the candidature will be
cancelled and the Commission's decision in this regard shall be final".
5. It was also further submitted by the respondents that the petitioner applied for the said
examination in the year 2013 and on the basis of performance in the examination, he was declared
qualified to the post of Constable (GD) purely on provisional basis subject to fulfillment of the
eligibility criteria as prescribed in the Notice of Examination. It was very clearly stated in para-10 of
the write up of the final result declared on 30.05.2014 which is as follows:-
"The list of candidates is subject to their fulfilling all the eligibility conditions
prescribed in the Notice of the said Examination and also subject to among other
things, thorough verification of their identity with reference to their photographs,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127311444/ 4
Manish Kumar Paswan vs The Union Of India And Ors on 22 August, 2019
signatures, handwriting etc. on the application forms, admission certificates etc. It
was next submitted that the petitioner was recommended to the post of Constable
(GD) in SSB on provisional basis. However, during the verification of available record
before forwarding his name to the user department i.e. Central Industrial Patna High
Court L.P.A No.1597 of 2018 dt.22-08-2019 Security Force (CISF) for issue of offer of
appointment as it noticed difference in signature, handwriting and thumb impression
were noticed in the case of some candidates including the petitioner. Accordingly, the
dossier of the petitioner and others was forwarded to the office of CISF vide the office
letter dated 20.10.2014 on provisional basis and they were advised to issue offer of
appointment only after through verification of their identity etc."
6. Learned counsel for the SSC clearly submitted that the detailed opinion as given by the CFSL
clearly indicated that the person who wrote the writing in signatures stamped and marked, as S1 to
S8 and other specimen signatures as indicated in the report were not the writings and signatures
stamps and marked, as those writings and signatures available on the admission certificates of the
Commission's copies filed in the examination hall at the time of written examination. The extract of
the opinion received from the expert in respect of the petitioner (Manish Kumar Paswan) and
marked Annexure R/1 which has been brought on record by the respondents. It was further
submitted that in a similar case the Hon'ble High Court at Allahabad had taken a definite view while
dismissing the writ petition No. 32867 of 2016 wherein the Court declined to Patna High Court
L.P.A No.1597 of 2018 dt.22-08-2019 interfere on the basis of reports of expert agencies and yet in
another case, a similar view was adopted by the same Hon'ble Court wherein they opined that when
a clear finding had come from the government examiner against whom no bias could be attributed,
the Court could not carve out any exception to the conclusion so arrived.
7. Learned counsel for the SSC submitted that the expert opinion of the CFSL clearly establishes that
the petitioner had procured impersonation in the written part of the examination and he had tried
to secure a government job by fraudulent means and, therefore, the writ application was not fit to be
entertained, but should be dismissed with costs as on the basis of the available record, the
candidature of the petitioner was cancelled on 04.04.2016 and he was debarred from appearing in
the examination conducted by the Commission for three years from the date of the written part of
the said examination which was held on 12.05.2103.
8. Learned counsel for the SSC further contended that it appears that, during the pendency of the
enquiry of the petitioner's case with regard to the examination held for appointment in Assam Rifles
Examination, 2013, the petitioner had applied for the post of Constable (GD) in CAPFs, N.I.A. Patna
High Court L.P.A No.1597 of 2018 dt.22-08-2019 and S.S.F. and Rifleman (GD) in 2015 and was
declared successful on provisional basis subject of fulfillment of eligibility criteria of the
examination. Accordingly, his dossier was forwarded to the user department with advice to issue
offer of appointment only after thorough verification.
9. However, it appears that on subsequent verification, the candidature of Shri Manish Kumar
Paswan was cancelled for having secured the earlier selection on impersonation in the written part
of the examination. He was also debarred from appearing in the examination to be conducted by the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127311444/ 5
Manish Kumar Paswan vs The Union Of India And Ors on 22 August, 2019
SSC for three years from the date of examination i.e., 12.05.2013 to 11.05.2016 as per standard
practice followed by the Commissioner whereafter malpractice/impersonation is detected. Thus,
Manish Kumar Paswan stood debarred with effect from 12.05.2013 to 11.05.2016 whereas the
subsequent examinations for recruitment in Assam Rifles, 2015 was held on 03.07.2015 and
04.10.2015 which was held within the period of three years for which the Commission had debarred
him from appearing in the examination.
10. In view of such circumstances, it was submitted that it is well established fact that success in
examination Patna High Court L.P.A No.1597 of 2018 dt.22-08-2019 confers no right of
appointment unless the concerned authorities are satisfied after such enquiry as may be considered
necessary that the candidate is eligible in all respects of appointments to the service posts.
11. Learned counsel for the respondents further submitted that the contention of the petitioner that
the office Memo date 04.04.2016 was served on him only at the time of his joining is wholly
misconceived and false as the same was sent to his residential address by speed post on the address
available in his application form. Thus, such a contention as raised by the petitioner cannot be
entertained. Furthermore, he was guilty of having given a wrong declaration in his form that he had
not been debarred in the examination as on the date of his application, the petitioner was fully
aware that he was suffering from such a debarment.
12. The respondents CRPF have also filed counter affidavit in the writ application in which, more or
less, they have reiterated the stand taken by the respondent SSC stating that the petitioner, having
been debarred vide letter dated 04.04.2016 which was addressed to the petitioner and had been sent
through speed post, could not have participated in the subsequent selection of 2015 as his
debarment by virtue of the order dated Patna High Court L.P.A No.1597 of 2018 dt.22-08-2019
04.04.2016 was operational on the date of his application. It was submitted that on-line admit-cards
appearing in the PST/PET/written/Medical examination and GCB CRPF, Bhagalpur were issued
and appeared in all tests of the recruitment process without disclosing the above fact that he stood
debarred and willfully participated at his own risk. As a result whereof he qualified and was given
the offer of appointment on 27.02.217 with a direction to join for duty on 21.03.2017 at G.C., CRPF,
Bilaspur, as per the terms and conditions of appointment, without knowing the fact that the
petitioner is a debarred candidate by SSC.
13. However, on the basis of a signal received on 11.03.2017, the said fact regarding debarment came
to be known. Thus, vide order dated 16.03.2017, the Director General, Recruitment , CRPF, New
Delhi, forwarded a list of total nine candidates including that of the petitioner that included the
name of the petitioner who stood debarred and thus, the petitioner was prevented from joining.
Thereafter, vide letter dated 23.07.2017 issued from the D.I.G. (Recruitment), Director General,
CRPF, New Delhi, contained in A-VI-1/2015 RECTT (SSB)-CT/GD-2015 dated 27.03.2017 cancelled
the candidature of the debarred candidate as also that of the Patna High Court L.P.A No.1597 of
2018 dt.22-08-2019 petitioner. It was thus submitted that the petitioner has no case as it has been
well settled by the Apex Court that the Court should not interfere in the field of the experts unless
the Court's violation of rules and regulations have been established, it is not open to the petitioner to
challenge the order which was passed pursuant to the report of the CFSL. It is further submitted
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127311444/ 6
Manish Kumar Paswan vs The Union Of India And Ors on 22 August, 2019
that the rejection of the petitioner's candidature is wholly legal and justified as he has given a false
declaration that he is not debarred when on the date of his application, the petitioner's candidature
stood debarred.
14. We have heard learned Senior Counsel Shri Yugal Kishore for the petitioner and learned Senior
Counsel Shri S.D. Sanjay, A.S.G., appearing for the respondents at length and have perused the
materials on record. The report of the CFSL has also been carefully perused by us insofar as it
relates to the examination of the year 2013, wherein there is a clear allegation of impersonation and
verification were made with regard to the signature of the petitioner by the expert body. So far as the
said issue is concerned, we do not propose to enter into any issue as the law stands well settled in
this matter. We fully agree with the order of the learned Single Judge as the order which was passed
on the basis of the said report i.e., Patna High Court L.P.A No.1597 of 2018 dt.22-08-2019
04.04.2016 cannot be interferred as the same was passed relying on the aforementioned CFSL
report. Thus, so far as the report dated 04.04.2016 is concerned (Annexure-7), we are of the firm
view that the same is wholly legal and valid and calls for no interference and, therefore, we decline
to interfere with the prayer of the petitioner in this regard.
15. The second issue which has been agitated before this Court in the writ application and it is also
one of the grounds raised in the present Appeal is with regard to the order having been served on
the petitioner. We cannot go into the issues of facts of the service of the said notice on the petitioner
as the respondents have not produced any document to prove that, in fact, the said notices were
effectively served on the petitioner. However, what is patent from the submission, is that the said
order was passed on 04.04.2016 after the petitioner had made an application for the posts pursuant
to the advertisement of 2015. Therefore, in our opinion, it cannot be said that the petitioner had on
the date of application given a wrong undertaking that he had been debarred from appearing in any
examination as the order itself has been passed on 04.04.2016.
16. It appears from a perusal of the order of the learned Single Judge that only the 2013 examination
has been Patna High Court L.P.A No.1597 of 2018 dt.22-08-2019 taken into consideration and the
report which was submitted by the CFSL on 01.02.2016 forms the basis of the order dated
04.04.2016 which was with regard to the examination of 2013.
17. We, however, observe an absurdity in one of the documents which have been produced before us
and has been marked as R/1 to the affidavit filed by the office of the D.I.G., CRPF on 13.09.2017 in
the writ application. The date of Declaration indicated therein is 17.05.2016 wherein the petitioner
has stated at clause -4 as follows:-
"I also declare that I do not stand debarred by SSC/UPSC as on date and have never
been convicted by any court of law. I also declare that no criminal case is pending
against me. Further, declare that I have never been dismissed or removed from Govt.
Service or my service been terminated during probation."
The said date is also the same date as the date of Medical Examination which is marked as
Annexure-3 to the writ application.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127311444/ 7
Manish Kumar Paswan vs The Union Of India And Ors on 22 August, 2019
18. We have noted all the facts and circumstances of the case as also the order dated 04.04.2016
which was passed during the period when the petitioner was taking up the examination and period
within which the results of examination of 2015 were finally published. It appears that during the
entire period, the petitioner's candidature stands debarred and, Patna High Court L.P.A No.1597 of
2018 dt.22-08-2019 therefore, his application could not have been considered and for that reason,
we do not find that the offer of appointment given to the petitioner was legal and valid.
19. In view of the aforementioned facts and circumstances and the reasons which have been
indicated hereinabove, we are not inclined to interfere in the order passed by the authorities
rejecting the candidature of the petitioner.
20. The Appeal thus stands dismissed.
