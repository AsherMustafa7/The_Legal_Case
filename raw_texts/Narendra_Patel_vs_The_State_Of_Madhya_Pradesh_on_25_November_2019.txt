M.Cr.C. No.48659/2019x
Indore dated :23/11/2019
Ms. Rekha Shrivastava, learned counsel for the applicant.
Shri Ankit Khare, learned Public Prosecutor for the
respondent/State.
Heard. Case diary perused.
This is first application under Section 439, Cr.P.C for grant
of bail in connection with Crime No.86/2019, registered at police-
station-Karnwas, District-Rajgarh (Bioara) concerning offence
under Sections 363, 366(A), 376(2)(g) and 450 of the IPC
alongwith Section 5(J)(II)/6 of Protection of Children from Sexual
Offences Act, 2012.
As per prosecution case, on 15/06/219, Complainant-Suresh
Kumar Prajapati lodged a missing report of her daughter alleging
that the applicant took her minor daughter by alluring her. During
investigation, the prosecutrix was recovered from the possession
of the applicant and at that time she was having pregnancy of 20
weeks and 5 days.
Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that the
applicant is a youth of aged about 25 years and he has not
committed any offence. It is also submitted that the prosecutrix
was having love affairs with the applicant and she had gone with
the applicant at her own accord. When the prosecutrix was
recovered at that time she was having 20 weeks and 5 days
pregnancy, which clearly shows that the prosecutrix was the
consenting party. The prosecutrix and her parents have already
been examined before the trial Court and from their testimony,it
appears that there was a dispute between the applicant and parents
10
of the prosecutrix regarding money transaction. In their cross-
examination, they accepted that they have given Rs.20,000/- to
the concern SHO to make out a strong case against the applicant,
which clearly indicates that the applicant has falsely been
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/142018932/ 4
Narendra Patel vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 November, 2019
implicated in the present case. The applicant is in custody since
15/06/2019 and conclusion of trial will take sufficient long time.
Under these circumstances, learned counsel for the applicant
prays for grant of bail to the applicant.
On the other hand, learned Public Prosecutor opposed the
application by contending that from the court statement of the
prosecutrix, it appears that applicant took the prosecutrix
forcefully and committed rape upon her, therefore, she got
pregnant. It is further submitted that at the time of deciding bail
application, the appreciation of evidence of the prosecution
witnesses is not permissible, otherwise, it will prejudice the trial
Court. Under these circumstances, he prayed for rejection of the
bail application.
After considering the arguments advanced by the learned
counsel for the parties and looking to the fact that at the time of
alleged incident, the prosecutrix was minor, therefore, her consent
is immaterial, this Court is of the view that no case for grant of
bail to the applicant is made out. Accordingly, the present
application filed under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. is dismissed
summarily.

respondent/State.
Appellant-Vinod is present in person. He is duly identified by
his counsel and his presence is marked.
Heard learned counsel for the parties on IA No.9616/2019, an
application for condonation of previous non-appearance of appellant
on 22/07/2019 before the registry of this Court.
Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the appellant
has lost the date slip of attendance, therefore, he could not mark his
presence before the Registry of this Court on 22/07/2019.
Looking to the reasons assigned in the application, which is also
supported with the affidavit of appellant-Vinod sufficient ground is
made out to condone the previous non-appearance of the appellant
before the Registry of this Court on 22/07/2019.
Accordingly IA No.9616/2019 is allowed and previous non-
appearance of appellant before the Registry this Court on 22/07/2019

for grant of bail in connection with Crime No.12/2017, registered
at Police Station-Balwada, District-Khargone concerning offence
under Section 392/34 of the IPC.
Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that the
applicant is a youth of aged about 22 years and he is not having
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/142018932/ 23
Narendra Patel vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 November, 2019
any criminal antecedents. The applicant is in custody since
25/02/2017. Investigation is over and charge-sheet has been filed.
Till today the prosecution has examined only three prosecution
witnesses and after that there is no progress in the trial, therefore,
there is no possibility of early conclusion of the trial. It is also
submitted that the complainant has already been examined before
the trial Court and there are material discrepancies in his
statement, hence, his testimony is not reliable. Under these
circumstances, learned counsel for the applicant prays for grant of
bail to the applicant.
On the other hand, learned Public Prosecutor for the
respondent/State opposed the application and prayed for its
rejection.
Having heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the
documents filed alongwith the bail application.
From the perusal of the documents, it appears that
70
complainant-Subhal Singh Thakur (PW 2) has already been
examined before the trial Court and he has identified the applicant
as culprit, who committed robbery with him. The trial is still
going on and at the time of deciding bail application, testimony of
the complainant or other prosecution witnesses cannot be
appreciated, otherwise, it will prejudice the trial. Accordingly, this
Court is of the view that no case for grant of bail to the applicant
is made out, hence, the present application is hereby dismissed.
However, from the perusal of the proceedings of the trial Court, it
appears that the case is pending since 2017 and from the last 7
dates, neither any prosecution witness appeared before the trial
court for recording his evidence nor their summons have been
returned either served or unserved. The trial Court has not made
any effort to compel the concerning SHO to serve the aforesaid
summons on the prosecution witnesses. Hence, the trial court is
directed to make all endeavor to conclude the trial as early as
possible preferably within a period of six months from the date of
receipt of certified copy of this order.
Let a copy of this order be sent to the concerned court for
information and necessary compliance.

Name Conviction Sentence Fine In lieu
of appellant amount
Ramprasad Under Section 376 of the Ten years RI Rs.2,000/- 1 months SI
IPC
Learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that after
considering the evidence produced by the prosecution, the trial Court
has come to the conclusion that at the time of alleged incident, the
prosecutrix is not below than 18 years. From the court statement of
the prosecutrix, it appears that she was regularly talked to the
appellant on mobile phone and she had gone with the appellant at her
own accord. As per the said statement, the prosecutrix remained in the
company of the appellant for considerable period and she visited to
various places by public transport, during this period she neither
complaint to anybody that the appellant forcefully took her and
committed rape upon her, which clearly shows that she was the
consenting party, however, the trial Court has not properly appreciated
the evidence on record and wrongly convicted the appellant for the
72
aforesaid offence. There are fair chances of success of this appeal
and there is no likelihood of hearing of the appeal in near future. If
the remaining custodial sentence of the appellant is not suspended
then appeal filed by the appellant may turn infructuous. The appellant
is ready to deposit the fine amount. Under these circumstances, he
prays for suspension of jail sentence and for grant of bail to the
appellant.
On the other hand, learned Public Prosecutor for the respondent
opposed the prayer and prayed for rejection of the application.
Considering the submissions made on behalf of the parties and
facts and circumstances of the case, it would be appropriate to suspend
the jail sentence of the appellant.
Accordingly, I.A. No. 8436/2019 is allowed and it is directed that
subject to depositing fine amount and on furnishing personal bond by
appellant-Ramprasad in the sum of Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty

satisfaction of the learned trial Court, for his regular appearance before

Indore, Dated:19/11/2019
Shri A.S. Sisodia, learned counsel for the appellant.
Shri Yogesh Kumar Gupta, learned Public Prosecutor for the
respondent/State.
Heard learned counsel for the parties on IA No.8955/2019,
first application under Section 389(1) of the Code of Procedure for
suspension of jail sentence and grant of bail moved on behalf of the
appellant-Arun.
The appellant has been convicted and sentenced by Special
Judge (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012),
Mandleshwar, West Nimar, vide judgment dated 30/08/2019 passed in
Special Case No. 95/2018 as under:
Name Conviction Sentence Fine In lieu
of appellant amount
Arun Under Section 376(2)(n) Seven years RI Rs.5,000/- One years
of the IPC RI
Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the appellant was
on bail during trial and he did not misuse the liberty granted to him.
It is also submitted that according to the findings given by the trial
Court, the prosecutrix was major at the time of alleged incident. From
the statement of the prosecutrix, her father and uncle, it appears that
the prosecutrix remained in the company of the appellant for a
considerable period in the knowledge of her father and the appellant
was ready to marry with the prosecutrix after completion of his
training, however, the prosecutrix and her parents pressurized the
appellant to marry with the prosecutrix before completion of his
training. On account of that a dispute arose between the parties, due
to which the prosecutrix has lodged the false report against the
100
appellant. The trial Court has not properly appreciated the evidence
available on record and wrongly convicted the appellant for the
alleged offence. There are fair chances of success of this appeal and
there is no likelihood of hearing of the appeal in near future. If the
remaining custodial sentence of the appellant is not suspended then
appeal filed by the appellant may turn infructuous. The appellant is
ready to deposit the fine amount. Under these circumstances, he prays
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/142018932/ 34
Narendra Patel vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 November, 2019
for suspension of jail sentence and for grant of bail to the appellant.
On the other hand, learned Public Prosecutor for the respondent
opposed the prayer and prayed for rejection of the application.
Considering the submissions made on behalf of the parties and
facts and circumstances of the case, it would be appropriate to suspend
the jail sentence of the appellant.
Accordingly, I.A. No.8955/2019 is allowed and it is directed that
subject to depositing fine amount and on furnishing personal bond by
appellant-Arun in the sum of Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand
only) with one solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of
the learned trial Court, for his regular appearance before this Court, the
execution of custodial part of the remaining sentence imposed against
the appellant shall remain suspended, till the final disposal of this
appeal.
The appellant, after being enlarged on bail, shall mark his presence
before the Registry of this Court on 29/01/2020 and on all such
subsequent dates, which are fixed in this regard by the registry.

Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the appellant was

The trial Court has not properly appreciated the evidence available on

There are fair chances of success of this appeal and there is no

Heard.
The applicant has preferred this petition under Section
397/401 of the Cr.P.C. against order dated 23/10/2019 passed by
Special Judge( Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act,
2012), Ratlam in Special Case No. 151/2016, whereby the
application filed by the respondent/State under Section 311 of the
Cr.P.C. for taking the blood sample of the applicant for sending
the DNA test has been allowed.
2. Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that on the basis
of complaint made by prosecutrix (PW 3), FIR bearing Crime
No.438/2016 for commission of an offence punishable under
Sections 363, 366 and 376(2)(n) of the IPC alongwith Section
5(L)/6 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012
has been registered at Police-Station-Industrial Area, Ratlam.
After completion of the investigation, the charge-sheet was filed.
During trial the prosecutrix, her parents and other prosecution
witnesses have been examined before the trial Court on
23/10/2019 and the prosecution evidence was closed on
11/11/2019. The applicant was examined under Section 313 of the
Cr.P.C., thereafter, the respondent/State moved an application for
taking blood sample of the applicant for sending it to DNA
examination and the same was allowed by the trial court, vide
impugned order without considering the fact that the prosecutrix
154
and other prosecution witnesses have not supported the
prosecution case and turned hostile. Thereafter, the prosecution
must not be allowed to fill up a lacuna in his case at such a belated
stage with intend to linger on the case. Under these circumstances,
learned counsel for the applicant prays for setting aside of the
impugned order.
3. . On the other hand, learned Public Prosecutor opposed the
prayer by supporting the impugned order.
4. Having heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the
documents filed alongwith the revision petition.
5. From the perusal of the documents, it appears that the case
was registered against the applicant in the year 2016 and the FSL
report was also received by the prosecution in the month of
September, 2016, however, at that time the prosecution has not
taken any steps with regard to taking blood sample of the
applicant for sending it to DNA examination. The prosecutrix and
her parents were examined before the trial Court in the month of
December, 2018 and they have not supported the prosecution case
and turned hostile. Thereafter, the statement of the applicant was
recorded under Section 313 of the Cr.P.C. and the case was fixed
for recording his evidence. After that the respondent/State have
moved an application under Section 311 of the Cr.P.C. seeking
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/142018932/ 53
Narendra Patel vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 November, 2019
permission for taking blood sample of the applicant for sending it
to DNA examination without assigning any reason as to why
initially the prosecution has not taken any step for taking blood
sample of the applicant for DNA examination. It is well settled
preposition of law, that no party can be allowed to fill up lacuna in
their case, therefore, the trial Court has committed error in
155
allowing the application filed by the prosecution under Section
311 of the Cr.P.C. at a belated stage and granting permission for
taking blood sample of the applicant for sending the same for
DNA examination.
6. Looking to the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case,
in the considered opinion of this Court, the present revision
petition deserves to be and is hereby allowed. Consequently, the
order dated 23/10/2019, passed by Special Judge( Protection of
Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012), Ratlam in Special
Case No. 151/2016 is hereby set aside meaning thereby the
application filed by the prosecution under Section 311 of the
Cr.P.C. before the trial Court is hereby dismissed.
7. Let a copy of this order be sent to the trial Court for
information and necessary compliance.

M.Cr.C. No.37018/2019x

None for the applicant.
The applicant has preferred this petition under Section
378(4) of the Cr.P.C. for grant of leave to appeal against judgment
of acquittal passed by 10th Additional Sessions Judge, Ujjain, vide
judgment dated 2/06/2019 in S.T. No. 78/2018, whereby the
respondent No.1 has been acquitted for commission of offence
punishable under Sections 354(A)(i-iv) and 352 of the IPC
alongwith Section 11(1)/12 of Protection of Children from Sexual
Offences Act, 2012.
According to the averments made in the petition, the trial
Court has not properly appreciated the evidence and come to the
conclusion that at the time of alleged incident, the victim was
below 18 years. It is also averred in the petition that the trial
court wrongly disbelieved the statement of the victim and
acquitted the respondent No.1 from the alleged offence.
Therefore, applicant prays for grant of leave to appeal against the
judgment of acquittal.
From the perusal of the impugned judgment, it appears that
there was previous enmity between the parties, therefore,
possibility of false implication of the respondent No.1 cannot be
ruled out. Material discrepancies were also come in the statement
of the prosecution witnesses, hence, their statement has not been
found trustworthy by the trial Court.
Considering the findings recorded by the trial Court in para
Nos. 24 and 25 of the impugned judgment, this court is of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/142018932/ 54

view that the findings recorded by the trial court for acquittal of
157
the respondent No.1 is just and proper and no interference in the
impugned judgment is called for by this Court.
Looking to the aforesaid facts and circumstances, no case for
grant of leave to appeal against judgment of acquittal is made out.
Accordingly, the present application filed under Section 378(4) of
the Cr.P.C. for grant of leave to file an appeal is hereby dismissed
summarily.

The applicant/State has preferred this petition under Section
378(3) of the Cr.P.C. for grant of leave to appeal against the
judgment dated 14/06/2019 passed by 10th Additional Sessions
Judge, Ujjain in S.T. No. 498/20018, whereby the respondent has
been acquitted by the trial Court for commission of offence
punishable under Sections 451, 354 and 506(II) of the IPC
alongwith Section 7/8 of Protection of Children from Sexual
Offences Act, 2012.
Learned Public Prosecutor has submitted that the trial Court
has not properly appreciated the evidence and wrongly acquitted
the respondent for the aforesaid offence. Under these
circumstances, he prayed for setting aside of the impugned
judgment and grant of leave to appeal against judgment of
acquittal.
Heard learned Public Prosecutor for the applicant/State and
perused the record.
From the perusal of the statement of prosecution witnesses,
it appears that there was previous enmity between the parties and
on the morning of the date of alleged incident, a quarrel took
place between the family members of the prosecutrix and the
respondent, therefore, due to the previous enmity, possibility of
false implication of the respondent cannot be ruled out. Material
discrepancies were also noticed in the statement of the
159
prosecution witnesses, hence, their statement cannot be found
trustworthy by the trial Court.
Considering the findings recorded by the trial Court in para
Nos. 18 to 22 of the impugned judgment, this court is of the view
that the trial Court has not committed any error in disbelieving the
testimony of the prosecution witnesses. Public Prosecutor has
failed to point out that how and in what manner view taken by the
trial Court is not possible or plausible. No perversity could be
pointed out in the impugned judgment, which can be interfered by
this Court.

Shri L.C. Patne, learned counsel for the petitioner.

responents/State.
The petitioner before this Court has filed the present petition
being aggrieved by order dated 20/09/2019 passed by Dean, MGM,
Medical College, Indore.
The facts of the case reveals that the petitioner has obtained the
MBBS degree from the MGM Medical College in the year 2012and
was selected for diploma course in the subject of Obstetrics and
Gynecology. She has submitted a bond on 21/04/2018 and as per the
terms of the bond, she was required to serve State of Madhya Pradesh
( Rural Area) for one year. In the case of not fulfilling the aforesaid
condition, she was required to pay Rs.8.0 Lacs. Undisputedly, the
matter relating to submission of bond was subjected to judicial
scrutiny and the Division Bench of this Court in the case of Dr. Varun
Chauhan Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh, vide order dated 03/05/2016
passed in WP No. 7929/2016 has dismissed the writ petition and has
upheld the action of the State Government and directed the candidates
to submit a bond.
Undisputedly, the petitioner has submitted a bond, while the
matter was pending before the Divisional Bench and the petitioner
sought permission for admission to another super specialty course in
Gynecology and she has been granted admission based upon National
Eligibility Test conducted by National Board of Examination. The
another important aspect of the case is that the respondents
themselves have issued a letter dated 06/04/2017, which is in fact a
No Objection Certificate issued by Dean, MGM Medical College,
Indore and the aforesaid letter makes it clear that the petitioner was
182
granted permission to take admission in the aforesaid Super Specialty
Course and it was made clear that she will serve the State of Madhya
Pradesh after completion of the said course and if she does not serve
the State of Madhya Pradesh in rural areas, then in that case she will
deposit Rs. 8.0 Lacs. Shri Patne has argued before this Court that the
petitioner will definitely serve the State of Madhya Pradesh in rural
areas for one year after completing the super specialization .
This Court in the light of NOC, which was granted by
respondent No.3 on 06/04/2017 as well as the affidavit submitted by
the petitioner today, is of the opinion that the petitioner is entitled for
grant of interim relief. Accordingly, the petitioner is permitted to join
the FNB course at Kerla Institute of Medical Science, Trivendrum. It
is made clear that the petitioner after completion of the said course,
will serve the State of Madhya Pradesh in rural areas for one year and
in case of breach of the condition, she will pay Rs.8.0 Lacs to the
State.
Meanwhile, learned counsel for the respondents is directed to

Indore dated :13/11/2019
Shri Bharat Dembla, learned counsel for the applicant.
Shri Prasanna Prasad, learned counsel for the
respondent/State-Directorate of Revenue Intelligence.
Heard. Case diary perused.
This is first application under Section 439, Cr.P.C for grant
of bail in connection with Crime No.88/2019, registered by
Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Indore concerning offence
under Sections 132, 132 and 135 of the Customs Act, 1962.
According to the prosecution case, on the basis of specific
intelligence applicant alongwith six other passengers were
intercepted at Devi Ahilya Bai Holkar International Airport,
Indore arrived by flight No. 904 at 12:35 a.m. On search of the
aforesaid persons, gold bullets and wrappers were recovered from
the rectum weighted 5073.80 gms valued at Rs. 1,97,17,059/-.
Thereafter, statement of applicant was recorded under Section 108
of the Customs Act, 1962, wherein, he accepted that he knew all
the co-accused persons and they were coming together and
smuggling gold collectively in small quantities, therefore, offence
under Section 135 of the Customs Act, 1962 was registered
against the applicant and other co-accused persons and they were
arrested.
Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that the
applicant was a solo traveler vides flight No. SG-5 from Mumbai
to Dubai dated 26/09/2019 and by flight No.AI-904 from Dubai to
Indore dated 27/09/2019. About 425 gms. Gold worth of
Rs.15,72,000/- was found from his back pocket, which is in the
184
normally permitted limit, therefore, the offence registered against
the applicant is bailable in nature. However, the prosecution
agency has falsely implicated him for the commission of offence
under Section 135 of the Customs Act, 1962 alleging that he was
smuggling gold collectively in small quantities alongwith six
other co-accused persons. There is no evidence to substantiate the
aforesaid fact. The applicant is in custody since 28/09/2019 and
there is no possibility of his absconsion or tempering with the
evidence. Under these circumstances, learned counsel for the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/142018932/ 64
Narendra Patel vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 November, 2019
applicant prays for grant of bail to the applicant. In support of his
contention, learned counsel for the applicant has placed reliance
on the judgment of Hon'ble apex court in the case of Adani
Enterprised Ltd. & Ors. Vs. Union of India and Ors., passed on
18/10/2019 in WP No. 3818/2018, Omprakash & Anrs. Vs.
Union of India and Anrs., passed on 30/09/2011 in W.P.
(Criminal) No. 66/2011 and Avinash Bhosale Vs. Union of India
& ors. passed in Criminal Appeal No. 138/2007 on 23/08/2007.
On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent
opposed the application by contending that the applicant is arrived
at Devi Ahilya Bai Holkar International Airport, Indore alongwith
other 6 co-accused persons and when they were asked to show
their passport and boarding passes, then passport of all the
accused were handed over by Smt. Sapna Bhatia to the Custom
Officers and during search of the said passengers the gold(bullets)
and gold (wrappers) were recovered from the body cavity
(rectum), undergarments and clothing's. The weight of the gold
was found to 5073.870 gms. Valued at Rs. 1,97,17,059/-.
Thereafter, the statement of the applicant was recorded under
185
Section 108 of the Customs Act, 1962, wherein he accepted that
he knew all the accused persons and they came together. He also
submitted that prior to the alleged incident, one case also booked
by customs against the applicant in relation to smuggling of gold,
therefore, it is clear that the applicant is a habitual offender and
the investigation agency is gathering the relevant information in
relation to smuggling of foreign gold from other countries by the
applicant and other co-accused persons. Hence, he prayed for
rejection of the application.
After considering the arguments advanced by the learned
counsel for the parties and looking to the material available in the
case-diary against the applicant, this Court is of the view that no
case for grant of bail to the applicant is made out. So far as the
judgments relied by the learned counsel for the applicant are
concerned, they cannot be taken into consideration while deciding
the bail application. Thus, present bail application filed by the
applicant is hereby dismissed.

same escort under the appropriate warrant.
Heard on IA No. 9265/2019, an application filed under Section
390 of the Cr.P.C. moved on behalf of respondent for grant of bail.
From the perusal of the record, it appears that the respondent
was acquitted by Judicial Magistrate First Class, Sanwer, District-
Indore, vide judgment dated 06/01/2018 passed in Criminal Case No.
660/2013. Being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment, the applicant
has preferred an application under Section 378(4) of the Cr.P.C. for
grant of leave to appeal against impugned judgment of acquittal,
which was allowed by this Court, vide order dated 21/06/2019 and
bailable warrant of Rs.30,000/-was directed to be issued against the
respondent for securing his presence before the Registry of this Court
on 17/09/2019. Even after service of bailable warrant, respondent did
not mark his presence before the Registry of this court on 17/09/2019,
therefore, non-bailable of arrest has been issued against him.
Looking to the fact that the respondent has already acquitted by
the trial Court and the present appeal is pending before this Court
against judgment of acquittal for adjudication, therefore, it would be
appropriate to release the respondent on bail. Accordingly, IA No.
202
9265/2019 is allowed and the respondent is directed to be released on
bail on his furnishing personal bond and surety bond of Rs.30,000/-
each with one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the

13(2) of the Prevention
of Corruption Act,

Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the appellant
was on bail during the trial and he did not misuse the liberty so
granted to him. The appellant is in custody since 31/01/2019. It is also
submitted that earlier application of appellant filed under Section
389(1) of the Cr.P.C. for suspension of custodial sentence has been
dismissed by this court, vide order dated 03/04/2019 observing that if
after sometime, if it is found that the appeal cannot be decided in near
future, then appellant is free to file fresh suspension application. After
227
rejection of that application, the present appeal is admitted for final
hearing by this court, vide order dated 12/04/2019. The appellant has
already suffered more than 9 months of the custodial sentence
awarded to him by the trial Court. Short sentence of four years is
involved in the present matter and there is no likelihood of hearing of
the appeal in near future. If the remaining custodial sentence of the
appellant is not suspended then appeal filed by him may turn
infructuous. The appellant is ready to deposit the fine amount. Under
these circumstances, he prays for suspension of jail sentence and for
grant of bail to the appellant.
On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent/SPE for
the respondent opposed the prayer and prayed for rejection of the
application.
Considering the submissions made on behalf of the parties and
facts and circumstances of the case, it would be appropriate to suspend
the jail sentence of the appellant.
Accordingly, I.A. No.8491/2019 is allowed and it is directed that
subject to depositing fine amount and on furnishing personal bond by
appellant-Sureshchandra Sharma in the sum of Rs.75,000/- (Rupees

Shri Vikas Jaiswal, learned counsel for the

Heard. Case diary perused.
This is repeat (fifth) application under Section 439, Cr.P.C
for grant of bail in connection with Crime No.1050/2017,
registered at Police Station-Chimanganj Mandi, District-Ujjain
concerning offence under Sections 302, 147, 148, 149, 294 and
307 of the IPC.
As per the prosecution story, on 22/10/2017 at about 9:00
p.m., Rahul @ Nikki and Rahul Dayma were returning to their
house on a motorcycle after having dinner at house of Rahul
Dyma's sister Bhoori. When they reached near the house of co-
accused-Prakash Goud, Prakash alongwith his father Vikram
Singh, brothers Dilip and Jitendra, his friends Bali @ Balkishan
and the present applicant armed with sticks and fire arms, stopped
them and started assaulting them, due to which Rahul @ Nikki
sustained serious injuries and Rahul Dyama succumbed on the
spot.
Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that the
applicant is innocent and he has not committed any offence.. The
applicant is in custody since 31/10/2017. The prosecution
evidence started on 31/05/2018 and as on date 16 prosecution
witness have been examined before the trial court. The trial is
241
progressing very slowly and is likely to a lot of time in its
conclusion. After rejection of earlier bail applications of the
applicant on merits, applicant received the information under the
RTI Act from RMO CH, Ujjain clarifies that no MLC record of
Rahul Dayma exists in the CH Ujjain on 22/10/2017, which
means that he was not brought to CH Ujjain dead or alive on
22/10/2017 i.e. upto intervening midnight of 22/10/2017 and
23/10/2017, therefore, inspection of the dead body conducted by
SI-Kamlesh Gaud on 22/10/2017 at about 22:30 hrs at Ujjain
appears to be suspicious. According to the news paper report
appearing the day next to the incident the statement of Thana
Incharge of Police-Station-Chimanganjmandi, Ujjain made on
previous night that co-accused-Praksh Gaund was in police
custody with pistol, however, as per Investigation Officer, Prakash
Gaud was caught on 23/10/2017 near the railway station Ujjain
and brought to Police-Station-Chimanganjmandi, Ujjain at 17:09
hrs and arrested at 17:15 hrs., which again obviously a false story
because as per Investigation Officer himself the hand swab of
Prakash Gaud was taken at 16:40 hrs on 23/10/2017 at the Police-
Station in the presence of Dr. Priti Gaikwad of FSL, which clearly
indicates that the applicant has falsely been implicated in the
present crime. Under these change of circumstances, learned
counsel for the applicant prays for grant of bail to the applicant.
On the other hand, learned Public Prosecutor as well as
learned counsel for the complainant/objector opposed the
application by contending that earlier two applications of the
applicant has already been rejected by this Court on merits and
after rejection of these applications, there appears to be no change
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/142018932/ 87
Narendra Patel vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 November, 2019
242
of circumstances, in which this repeat application can be
considered. Under these circumstances, they prayed for rejection
of the application.
After considering the arguments advanced by the learned
counsel for the parties and looking to the fact that at the time of
deciding bail application, detail appreciation of evidence is not
permissible, in the considered opinion of this Court no case is
made out for grant of bail to the applicant. Accordingly, this bail
application is dismissed.

Heard. Case diary perused.
This is repeat (third) application under Section 439, Cr.P.C
for grant of bail in connection with Crime No.120/2017,
registered at Police Station-Simrol, District-Indore concerning
offence under Sections 376 and 376(2)(n) of the IPC.
As per the prosecution case, the applicant took the
prosecutrix on the pretext of providing employment and
thereafter, committed rape upon her.
Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that the
applicant is innocent and he has falsely been implicated in the
present crime. The prosecutrix is a major lady aged about 21 years
and from her court statement, it appears that she was the
consenting party. The applicant is in custody since 08/04/2017 and
the conclusion of trial will take sufficient long time. Under these
circumstances, learned counsel for the applicant prays for grant of
bail to the applicant.
On the other hand, learned Public Prosecutor opposed the
application by contending that the applicant took the prosecutrix
on the pretext of providing employment, therefore, she had gone
with the applicant and thereafter, he committed rape upon her,
hence, it cannot be said that the prosecutrix was the consenting
party. It is also submitted that at the time of deciding bail
application, detail appreciation of the statement of the prosecution
244
witnesses is not permissible. Under these circumstances, he prays
for rejection of the application.
After considering the arguments advanced by the learned
counsel for the parties coupled with allegation made by the
prosecutrix against the applicant in her court statement and
looking to the facts and circumstances of the case, in the
considered opinion of this Court no case is made out for grant of
bail to the applicant. Accordingly, this bail application is
dismissed.

Election Petition No. 11/2019
Shri Vinay Saraf, learned Senior counsel alongwith Shri
Vikas Kumar Soni, learned counsel for the petitioner.
Shri Anand Mohan Mathur, learned Senior counsel with
Shri Vaibhav Asawa, learned counsel for the respondent No.1.
Shri K.P. Pande, learned counsel for the respondent No.4.
None appears for other respondents.
ORDER
(Passed on 13 /11/2019) This order shall govern the disposal of IA No. 4358/2019, an application
filed under Order 7 Rule 11 of Civil Procedure Code, 1908 (in short 'CPC') filed on behalf of
respondent No.1.
2. The application in summary narrates that the election petition filed by the petitioner suffers from
multiple deficiencies, which are sufficient for rejection of the same. Learned Senior counsel for the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/142018932/ 97
Narendra Patel vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 November, 2019
respondent No.1 submits that the foundation of election petition is alleged on the basis of
incomplete information, which is necessary to be furnished in the form No.26 of Section 4A of the
Conduct of Election Rules, 1961. However, the petitioner did not furnish the same. In this regard, he
further submits that the controversy has been put to rest in an enquiry conducted by the Returning
Officer and since this issue stands concluded. It shall be traversity of justice and wastage of quality
judicial time, if the respondent No.1 is made to stand trial on this issue.
3. The next contention of the learned Senior counsel for the respondent No. 1 is that, the petitioner
in his election petition has incorrectly alleged that, the respondent No.1 did not furnish accurate
details of his criminal antecedents as mandated by the Election Rules. However, while raising such
plea, the petitioner admitted to the fact that the pending criminal case against the respondent No.1
has been quashed by this Court in exercise of power under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C., vide order
dated 19/07/2018 passed in M.Cr.C. No. 5318/2018. Thus, he submits that in view of quashing of
criminal case, there was no misrepresentation about the pendency of the criminal case.
4. Lastly, it has been contended by the learned Senior counsel for the respondent No.1 that the
remaining pleadings of the election petition, so far as they relate to commission of corrupt practice
by the respondent No.1 during the course of election campaign, when the moral code of conduct was
in effect, the same are not in conformity to Section 83 of the Representation of Peoples Act, 1951 (in
short 'RP Act'), as the same lack material particulars about the date, the time and the place, where
such corrupt practice happened. Consequently, he submits that the application filed under Order 7
Rule 11 of the CPC deserves to be allowed and the election petition be dismissed.
5. On the contrary, learned Senior counsel for the petitioner sought rejection of the said application
filed under Order 7 Rule 11 of the CPC and raised preliminary objection that IA No. 4358/2019 is
shown to be notarised on 17/06/2019; whereas the same appears to be drawn/dated on
24/06/2019, which reflects that, the contents of the application were not perused. This anomaly,
tantamount to contempt of Court as respondent No.1 made false statement on oath so far as the
contents of the affidavit is concocted.
6. Further learned Senior counsel for the petitioner submits that plea of deficient form No. 26 is
required to be adjudicated upon and the same has not attained finality as attempted to be presented
by the learned Senior counsel for the respondent No.1. He also submits that the decision of the
Returning Officer, which is sought to be relied upon by the respondent No.1 was subject matter of
challenge before this Court in WP No. 26998/2018. However, the said writ petition resulted into
dismissal with liberty to the petitioner to raise all the contentions in the election petition, if the need
so arises. Thus, the contention of the learned Senior counsel for the respondent No.1 is deserves to
be repelled.
7. With respect to the objection about the deficient pleadings, learned Senior counsel for the
petitioner submits that such objection has been raised without appreciating the election petition as a
whole. While addressing the Court, learned Senior counsel for the petitioner drew attention of this
Court to the narrations made in the election petition to specify that all complete particulars are
mentioned therein. On the basis of above, learned Senior counsel for the petitioner prayed for
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/142018932/ 98
Narendra Patel vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 November, 2019
rejection of IA No. 4358/2019 filed by the respondent No.1 under Order 7 Rule 11 of the CPC.
8. No other point has been pressed during the course of hearing by the respective Senior counsels
for the parties.
9. Having perused the record and respective contentions canvassed by learned Senior counsels for
the parties, this Court is of the considered opinion that IA No. 4358/2019 filed under Order 7 Rule
11 of the CPC deserves to be dismissed.
10. The primary submission of the respondent No.1 that no further enquiry into the allegation of
non disclosure of material information in the form No. 26 is necessary due to the exhaustive
enqurity report of the Returning Officer, has no merit because the findings of the enquiry report can
be subjected to challenge in the instant election petition and the veracity of the said enquiry report
can be looked into for believing or disbelieving the findings recorded therein. The exercise can only
be carried out after recording of evidence in the instant case, further, the consequences of such
exercise will also be determined at the stage of final hearing. It is worthy of observation that this
Court while deciding an interlocutory application at the preliminary stage cannot venture into
presumption about correctness of the enquriry report. In this context, reference to the decision of
this Court vide order dated 22/11/2018 passed in WP No. 26998/2018 (Indore Bench) will fortified
the observations made herein, as a liberty to raise all contentions in the election petition was
extended by this Court to the petitioner.
11. The second contention of the respondent No.1, that the petitioner has made wrong allegation
regarding the existence of criminal antecedents of the respondent No.1 in the election petition
because the criminal proceedings pending against the respondent No.1 were quashed by this Court
in exercise of power under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C., vide order dated 19/07/2018 passed in
M.Cr.C. No. 5318/2018. Therefore, he submits that the election petition deserves to be rejected. In
this regard, suffice it to be observed that the correctness of the pleading or the purport of a decision
passed by this Court can never be subject matter of consideration while deciding an application filed
under Order 7 Rule 11 of the CPC. Therefore, at this juncture, this contention being beyond the
scope of consideration is deferred for consideration at the time of final hearing of the instant
petition.
12. Learned Senior counsel for the respondent No.1 placed reliance in the judgments of Hon'ble apex
Court in the case of Azhar Hussain Vs. Raji Gandhi, AIR 1986 SC 1253, Ram Sukh Vs. Dinesh
Aggrawaal, (2009) 2010 SCC 541, F.A. Sapna Vs. Singora, AIR 1991 SCC 1557, L.S. Shivramagowda

Damodar Tatyaba Alias Dadasaheb and others, (1994) 2 SCC 392, where in the Hon'ble apex court
has held that An election petition can be summarily dismissed if it does not furnish cause of action
in exercise of the powers under the Civil Procedure Code and it is settled law that the omission of a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/142018932/ 99
Narendra Patel vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 November, 2019
single material fact would lead to an incomplete cause of action and that an election petition without
the material facts relating to corrupt practice is not an election petition at all. It is also held by the
apex court that it is now well settled that in election petitions pleadings have to be precise, specific
and unambiguous and if the election petition does not disclose a cause of action it is liable to be
rejected in limine. It is further held by the Hon'ble supreme court that our election law being
statutory in character must be strictly complied with since an election petition is not guided by ever
changing common law principles of justice and notions of equity. Being statutory in character it is
essential that it must conform to the requirements of our election law. But at the same time purity of
election process must be maintained at all costs and those who violate the statutory norms must
suffer for such violation. If the returned candidate is shown to have secured his success at the
election by corrupt means, he must suffer for his misdeeds.
13. In the context of the aforesaid legal position, I have carefully examined the pleadings in the
Election Petition with respect to the inadequacy of pleading regarding corrupt practices by the
respondent No.1 during the course of election campaign and non-compliance of Sections 83 and 86
of the RP Act. I have no hesitation in observing that the petitioner has carefully pleaded the
particulars instances of commission of corrupt practices by respondent No.1 with date, time and
place and at whose instance such corrupt practices have been committed, which in my opinion is
substantial compliance of the Section 83 of the RP Act. This Court cannot set the parameters of
standard of pleading so high to mandate that every pleading be so it partakes that it provides that
character of proof/evidence, even before the stage of evidence arrives. Such interpretation of Section
83 of the RP Act shall be inaccurate. Consequently, I find that pleading regarding corrupt practices
are in consonance of Section 83 of the RP Act.
14. Before parting, the preliminary objection raised by the petitioner is to be dealt with, according to
the petitioner, IA No. 4358/2019 is shown to be notarised on 17/06/2019; whereas the same
appears to be drawn or draft on 24/06/2019, which reflects that contents of the application were not
perused. He submits that this amounts to wrong statement of facts. In this regard, I am of the view
that at firstly the application filed under Order 7 Rule 11 of CPC is not narrating any new facts and is
actually drawing an inferences from the factual narrations in the election petition. Therefore, the
anomaly pointed out by the petitioner cannot be treated as wrong statement of facts and I hold that
the preliminary objection has no merits.
15. Upon commutative consideration IA No. 4358/2019 sans merit and is hereby dismissed with
cost of Rs.25,000/-.The respondent No.1 is directed to pay the same in head of Indian Army Relief
Fund within a period of seven working days from today.
16. Learned counsel for the respondent No.1 is directed to file the reply of election petition within
two weeks, failing which application filed by the petitioner Under Order 8 Rule 10 of the CPC will be
considered and suitable order will be passed.
17. List the petition after two weeks.

(S.K. Awasthi) Judge skt THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRDESH Indore, Dated:06/11/2019
Shri Gaffar Mohammad, learned counsel for the appellants. Shri Ankit Khare, learned Public
Prosecutor for the respondent/State.
Heard learned counsel for the parties on IA No.7921/2019, repeat (second) application under
Section 389(1) of the Code of Procedure for suspension of jail sentence moved on behalf of the
appellant No.1-Rajendra Singh @ Raju @ Raja.
Appellant No.1-Rajendra Singh @ Raju @ Raja has been convicted and sentenced by Additional
Sessions Judge, Ujjain vide judgment dated 11/01/2018 passed in S.T. No.132/2012 as under:
Name Conviction Sentence Fine In lieu of appellant amount Rajendra Singh Under
Section Seven Years Rs.10,000/ 6 months RI 392/34 of the IPC RI -
@ Raju @ Raja.
Under Section 368 Seven Years RI Rs.10,000/ 3 months RI of the IPC -
Under Section Three years RI Rs.4,000/- 3 months RI
120(B) of the IPC
Under Section 25(1- One year RI Rs.1,000/- One month
B)(A) of the Arms RI
Act
Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the appellant No.1 was on bail
during the trial and he did not misuse the liberty so granted to him. It is also
submitted that neither the appellant No.1 is named in the FIR nor any robbed
property has been recovered from his possession. The trial Court has not properly
appreciated the evidence available on record and wrongly convicted the appellant
No.1 for the alleged offence. The appellant No.1 has already suffered more than two
years and four months of custodial sentence and there is no possibility of early
hearing of the appeal in near future. If the custodial sentence of the appellant No1 has
not been suspended by this Court, then the appeal filed by him may turn infructuous.
The appellant No.1 is ready to deposit the fine amount. Under these circumstances,
he prays for suspension of jail sentence and for grant of bail to the appellant No.-1.
On the other hand, learned Public Prosecutor for the respondent opposed the prayer
and prayed for rejection of the application.
Considering the submissions made on behalf of the parties and facts and
circumstances of the case, it would be appropriate to suspend the jail sentence of the
appellant No.1-Rajendra Singh @ Raju @ Raja .

contradictions in the statement of the prosecutrix regarding commission of offence,
which creates doubt about the occurrence of alleged incident, however, the trial court
has not properly appreciated the evidence available on record and wrongly convicted
the appellant for the alleged incident. There are fair chances of success of this appeal.
The appellant has already served more than 7 years and four months of custodial

released on temporary bail for a period of 15 days from 10/11/2015 to 24/11/2019 on his furnishing

Looking to the facts and circumstances of the case and considering the fact that the after granting
bail by this Court, the applicant absconded for long time and he has been arrested by the police in
compliance of perpetual warrant of arrest issued against him, which clearly shows that the applicant
has already misused the liberty so granted to him, therefore, in the considered opinion of this Court,
no case for grant of bail to the applicant is made out. Accordingly, this bail application is hereby
dismissed.

Narendra Patel vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 November, 2019
Judgment (Delivered on 03 /10/2019) The appellants have preferred this appeal under Section 374
of the Cr.P.C. against judgment dated 10/04/2019 passed by 8 th Additional Sessions Judge, Indore
in S.T. No. 676/2017, whereby the appellants have been convicted for the offence punishable under
Sections 341, 324 and 324/34 of the IPC and sentenced to undergo RI of one months, one years and
one years and to pay fine of Rs. 500/- and Rs.1,000/- each respectively with default stipulation.
From the perusal of record, it appears that after pronouncement of judgment of conviction by the
trial Court, the appellants have moved an application under Section 389(3) of the Cr.P.C. for
suspension of their custodial sentence and the same was allowed by the trial Court and their
custodial sentence has already been suspended till 09/05/2019. Thereafter, the present appeal
alongwith application filed by the appellants under Section 389(1) of the Cr.P.C. for suspension of
their custodial sentence came up for hearing before this Court on 19/06/2019, however, till then the
period of suspension of sentence granted by the trial Court was over, therefore, this Court directed
the appellants to make surrender before the trial Court and submit the certified copy of the
concerned order-sheet, thereafter, IA No. 3785/2019 will be considered. But after giving sufficient
opportunities, they have not surrendered themselves before the trial Court, hence, present appeal
filed by the appellants without surrendering before the trial Court is not maintainable in the light of
judgment of passed by this Court in the case of Javahar Rawat v. Sahayak Prabandhak (2012) 2
MPLJ 534. Thus, present appeal stands dismissed as not maintainable.

Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that the applicant was on bail during the trial as well as
in the appeal and he never misused the liberty so granted to him. It is also submitted that being a
para medical volunteer, the applicant has right to provide primary treatment to the patients,
however, he did not administer any injection to deceased-Reena, due to which she scummed.

Narendra Patel vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 November, 2019
According to the postmortem report, the cause of death of deceased-Reena is gangrene, which is not
possible by giving any injection or providing glucose saline. The trial Court as well as the appellate
Court have not properly appreciated the evidence available on record and wrongly convicted the
applicant for the alleged offence. The applicant is in custody since 06/09/2019 and there is no
likelihood of early hearing of the revision petition. There are fair chances of success of this revision
and if the custodial sentence of the applicant is not suspended, then the revision filed by the
applicant may turn infructuous. The applicant has already deposited the fine amount before the trial
Court. Under these circumstances, learned counsel for the applicant prays for suspension of
custodial sentence and grant of bail to the applicant.
On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent/State has opposed the prayer by contending
that at the relevant point of time, the applicant was working as para medical volunteer, however, he
was not having any degree of medical science or qualification necessary to became a doctor, he has
not only treated her by giving alopathy medicines and also gave her wrong injection, due to which
she suffered from gangrene. When her condition was deteriorated, then she was shifted to hospital
for treatment, during which she has died. Therefore, it is clear that the cause of death of the
deceased was wrong treatment given by the applicant. It is further submitted that the courts below
have given concurrent findings regarding the conviction for the commission of alleged offence,
therefore, there is no ground is available for suspending the the custodial sentence of the applicant.
Under these circumstances, learned Public Prosecutor prays for rejection of the application.
After considering the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the parties and looking to the
fact that the applicant without having any degree of medical science has given treatment to
deceased-Reena, due to which she died, this Court is of the considered view that no case for
suspension of custodial sentence and grant of bail to the applicant is made out. Accordingly, IA No.
7528/2019 is hereby dismissed.
