1. Petitioner has invoked the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India
questioning the legality, propriety and correctness of impugned detention order No. PIT NDPS-4 of
2022 dated 25.04.2022 passed by respondent No.2-Divisional Commissioner Jammu alongwith the
proceedings conducted under Section 3 of the Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and
Psychotropic Substance Act 1988 r/w SRO 247 of 1998 dated 27.07.1988 and has sought the
quashment of the impugned detention order on the following grounds:-
(i) that the detention order is bad, illegal and without application of mind as the
petitioner has been detained by the respondent No. 3 without providing any
sufficient material i.e. copies of the FIRs, allegations in dossier of respondent No. 4,
statement of witnesses recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C and grounds of detention
which is mandatory requirement as per the provisions of Public Safety Act, non
providing of sufficient material has prevented the petitioner from making effective
representation against the impugned detention order before the Government or
detaining authority, which is clear violation of mandate of Article 22 (5) of
Constitution of India r/w Section 13 of Public Safety Act, 1978 and therefore vitiates
the detention order;
(ii) that the detection order is based on non-application of mind as respondent No. 2
while passing the detention order has not reflected in it that the petitioner was bailed
out by the Court and just to detain the petitioner, respondent no. 3 has submitted the
dossier, even in none of the FIRs which have been mentioned by the respondents in
the detention order petitioner has been convicted by the competent Court who is on
bail, but in order to defeat the objective of the bail, impugned detention order has
been passed;
(iii) that the impugned detention order does not mention the period of detention,
order of detention has been approved by the advisory board and it is for three months
as provided under Section 18 of the J&K Public Safety Act 1978, the grounds of
detention do not contain any brief history of the petitioner and the dates thus the
petitioner has been detained on the basis of vague grounds which have been drafted
in a routine manner, dossier submitted by respondent No. 3 is without any date and
it is not reflected on which date he forwarded the dossier to respondent No. 2 as the
forwarding letter grounds of detention and dossier have been supplied in English
language which has caused great prejudice to the petitioner in making an effective
representation to the competent authority, the non-supply of such documents in a
language which the petitioner understands has infringed the rights of the petitioner
under Article 22(5) of the Constitution of India, whereby the detention order gets
vitiated;
(iv) that in the five (05) FIRs which have been mentioned in the dossier are of the
year 2016, 2017, 2018 & 2019 and after 2019 till the date of passing of the detention
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119659082/ 2
Reserved On : 17.10.2022 vs Union Territory Of Jammu & Kashmir ... on 31 January, 2023
order no such incident or FIR has been lodged against the petitioner, but the
respondents have illegally and arbitrarily detained the petitioner in the aforesaid
FIRs in which he is facing trial, the person who has drained the petitioner has not
filed any affidavit or undertaking which could disclose that the person executing the
detention order had explained the grounds of detention to the petitioner in the
language he understands, non-filing of affidavit or undertaking is fatal for passing of
the detention order.
2. Respondent No. 2- Divisional Commissioner Jammu, has filed counter, wherein passing of the
impugned detention order has been defended, and it has been specifically pleaded that the
petitioner/detenue is involved in Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances which
poses serious threat to the health and welfare of the people and has deleterious effect on the national
economy, the detention order was passed by him only after careful examination of the dossier and
the relevant record made available by SSP Kathua vide his endorsement No. PA/2022/PSA/3925-30
dated 19.04.2022 and after following due procedure of law under the relevant provisions of The
Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act 1988. It is
contended, that the detention warrant was duly executed upon the petitioner/detenue and the copy
of the detention warrant, grounds of detention and other relevant record was read over and
explained to the petitioner/detenue in the language he understands, and the above documents were
handed over to the petitioner in presence of Jail Authorities of Central Jail Kot- Bhalwal Jammu,
moreover, petitioner/detenue was informed about his right to make representation to the
Government as well as to the detaining authority against the order of detention.
3. Mr. M. K. Bhardwaj, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner, has sought the setting
aside of the impugned detention order by vehemently articulating arguments, that
petitioner/detenue has not been supplied the detention record/material viz; copies of dossier, copies
of FIRs, site plan, recovery memo, statements of witnesses recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C to
enable him to make a effective representation against the impugned detention order, by not
supplying the essential material petitioner/detenue's right to make a effective representation to the
Government or detaining authority has been violated/infringed under Article 22 (5) of the
Constitution of India r/w Section 13 of the J & K Public Safety Act 1978 and such failure on part of
the detaining authority vitiates whole of the detention order. It is argued, that there is unexplained
delay in passing the order of detention from the date the proposal was sent to the detaining
authority by respondent No. 4, the detention order has been based on non application of mind by
the detaining authority, the dossier submitted by respondent No. 3 is without any date as it is not
reflected on which date the same has been submitted to the detaining authority i.e. respondent No.
2, the grounds of detention and dossier have been supplied to the petitioner in English language
which he does not understand and the same has caused great prejudice to the petitioner who has
been debarred from making effective representation to the competent authority and on these counts
even the detention order requires to be quashed. To support his arguments, Mr. Bhardwaj, learned
senior counsel has relied upon the judgments viz; (i) Cr. Appeal No. 1708 of 2022 ( Arising out of
SLP (Crl) No. 6683 of 2022 titled Sushant Kumar Banik vs. State of Tripura & others, decided by
Hon'ble Supreme Court on 30.09.2022 and (ii) WP(Crl) No. 55/2021, decided on 23.03.2022 by
Jammu and Kashmir High Court (Jammu Bench) [Hamraz Singh vs. Union Territory of Jammu and

Kashmir].
4. Mr. Dewakar Sharma, learned Dy. AG has vehemently supported the impugned detention order
against the petitioner and has sought its affirmation by projecting arguments, that the
petitioner/detenue is involved in as many as five FIRs viz;
(i) FIR No.93/2016 under Section 8-B/21/22 NDPS Act of Police Station Kathua, (ii) FIR No.
12/2017 under Sections 8/21/22 NDPS Act Police Station Lakhanpur, (iii) FIR No. 142/2017 under
Sections 8/21/22 NDPS Act Police Station Kathua, (iv) FIR No. 214/2018 under Sections 8/21/22
NDPS Act Police Station Rajbagh and (v) FIR No. 157/2019 under Sections 8/21/22 NDPS Act
Police Station Kathua, wherein, from his possession contraband heroine has been recovered on
different dates of occurrences; petitioner/detenue is habitual criminal involved in illicit trafficking
leading to spread of drug addiction among the general public especially the youth of the area; the
criminal activities of the petitioner/detenue are prejudicial to the society at large besides
detrimental to the peace and tranquility and menace to the public order; petitioner/detenue is
engaged in sale and purchase of illicit traffic in narcotics drugs and psychotropic substances which
poses a serious threat to the health and lives of the young generation; petitioner/detenue has close
nexus with the gang of criminals involved in illicit trafficking of drugs in clandestine manner to earn
huge and easy bucks and has spread the network of drug peddling in the entire UT of J & K;
petitioner/detenue has no respect for law and order and public tranquility causing serious threats
prejudicial to the security of UT of J & K. It is argued, that keeping in view the continuous and
repeated involvement of the petitioner/detenue in the narcotic trade, respondent No. 4 vide his
endorsement vide No. PA/2022/PSA/3925-30 dated 19.04.2022 recommended the detention of the
petitioner/ detenue to prevent him from indulging in illicit traffic in Narcotic Drugs and
Psychotropic Substances, and in a view to prevent the petitioner/detenue from further committing
any illicit trafficking in Narcotic Drugs and to secure the health and welfare of public at large
petitioner/detenue has been rightly and correctly detained under Section 3 of The Prevention of
Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act 1988. It is moreso argued, that as
per the detention record the petitioner has been supplied all the essential detention record including
the copies of detention order, notice of detention, grounds of detention, dossier of detention, copies
of FIRs, statements of witnesses and other related relevant documents (total 23 leaves) through
Executing officer Sh. O.P.Chib Police Inspector No. ESJ- 955634 of Police Station Kathua, moreso,
the impugned detention order has been read over and explained to the petitioner/detenue in Hindi
and Dogri language understood by him fully and he has also been informed of his right to make
representation to the Government as well to the Detaining Authority if he so desires, the order of
detention has been passed by respondent No. 2 on 25.04.2022 and the same has been executed
upon the petitioner on 26.04.2022 without any delay. In support of his arguments, learned Dy. AG
has relied upon a judgment titled Yudhvir Singh vs. Union Territory of J&K and others {WP (Crl)
No. 28/2021 decided on 03.12.2021 by Coordinate Bench of this Court}.
5. I have heard learned counsel for the parties, perused the averments of the petition, counter
affidavit filed by the respondent No. 2, record made available by the respondents and the relevant
law on the subject matter coupled with the judgments relied upon by learned counsel for the parties.

6. Dealing with the first argument canvassed by learned senior counsel for the petitioner, that he has
not been supplied with essential material of detention record which has debarred him from making
effective representation to the Government or to the detaining authority which has vitiated the
detention order, it is apt to reiterate here, that bare perusal of the detention record clearly
demonstrates that the impugned detention order No. PIT NDPS-4 of 2022 has been passed by
respondent No.2- Divisional Commissioner Jammu on 25.04.2022 on the strength of material like
dossier submitted by respondent No.4- SSP Kathua vide his endorsement No.
PA/2022/PSA/3925-30 dated 19.04.2022. The grounds of detention have been clearly delineated by
respondent No. 2 which reads as under:-
"You Daljeet Singh S/o Tariochan Singh R/o Legate Morh Tehsil and Distt. Kathua

specially youth of the area. You are acting in a manner which is prejudicial to the
society at large besides detrimental to the peace and tranquility and menace to the

the UT of J & K and Country as well, also to the health of general public at large. You
have very close nexus with the gang of criminals who have started illicit trafficking of
drugs in a clandestine manner to earn huge and easy bucks and also have spread the
network of drug peddling in the entire UT of J & K. It is also not out of the place to
mention that you have no respect for the laws of the land and you have been
committing breach of peace and law and order and public tranquility. You are
surreptitiously being indulging in criminal activity like drug mafia inside and outside

Keeping in view your continuous and repeated involvement in narcotic substance
cases, Sr. Superintendent of Police, Kathua vide letter No. PA-
2022/PSA/3925-30dated 19.04.2022 has recommended that you may be detained
under the provisions of The Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and
Psychotropic Substances Act, 1988.
From above facts and circumstances, it is evident that you are drug peddler involved
in possession and transportation of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances,
which as per Section 2 of The Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and
Psychotropic Substances Act, 1988 means "illicit traffic". Such "illicit traffic" poses
serious threat to the health and welfare of the people of Union Territory of J&K at
large. Now, therefore, with a view to prevent you from further committing any
offence of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances and to secure
the health and welfare of public at large, I have reached to the conclusion that it has
become imperative to detain you U/S 3 of The Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic
Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1988".
Detention record further demonstrates that the order of detention dated 25.04.2022
has been served upon the petitioner/detenue on 26.04.2022 without any delay,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119659082/ 7
Reserved On : 17.10.2022 vs Union Territory Of Jammu & Kashmir ... on 31 January, 2023
whereby, copies of detention order (02 leaves), Notice of detention (01 leaf), grounds
of detention (04 leaves), dossier of detention (06 leaves), copies of FIRs, statements
of witnesses and other related relevant documents (10 leaves), total 23 leaves have
been handed over/furnished to the petitioner/detenue through Executing officer, Sh.
O.P.Chib Police Inspector No.ESJ-
955634 of Police Station Kathua and receipt thereof has been given by the petitioner/detenue by
writing his name in English which clearly indicates that the petitioner understands English language
also. Moreso, the execution report depicts that the contents of detention warrant and grounds of
detention have been read over to the petitioner/detenue in English and also explained to him in
Hindi/Dogri language which he fully understands and in lieu thereof petitioner has appended
signature on the execution report. In view of the detailed record submitted by the respondents, it is
discernable, that the petitioner/detenue has been supplied whole of the detention record/essential
material so as to enable him to make a effective representation against the said detention order
before the Government or Detaining Authority and therefore, no right much less any right of the
petitioner guarantee to him under Article 22 (5) of the Constitution of India r/w Section 13 of Public
Safety Act has been violated. Case law relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioner titled
Hamraz Singh vs. UT of Jammu & Kashmir [WP (Crl.) 55/2021] is clearly distinguishable and
inapplicable to the facts of the case in hand. Arguments of learned counsel for the petitioner that
non- supply of record/documents/ essential material to him in regard to his detention
violating/infringing his fundamental right and debarring him from making an effective
representation are far from reality, legally unsustainable, repelled, rejected and discarded.
7. The next argument urged by learned senior counsel for the petitioner is, that there is unexplained
delay in passing the order of detention from the date the proposal was sent to detaining authority by
respondent No. 4-SSP Kathua and on that count even the detention order requires to be quashed.
From the perusal of the record, it is clearly gatherable that respondent No. 4-SSP Kathua has
supplied the dossier to respondent No. 2 on 19.04.2022 and after perusal of the dossier and all
connected record, respondent No. 2 vide impugned detention order No. PIT NDPS-4 of 2022 dated
25.04.2022 has issued the detention order within 06 days without any unnecessary delay in exercise
of powers vested in him under Section 3 of The Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and
Psychotropic Substances Act 1988 r/w SRO 247 of 1998 dated 27.07.1988 whereby the petitioner
has been detained and ordered to be lodged in Central Jail Kot- Bhalwal Jammu for a period to be
specified by the Government. On passing of the impugned detention order dated 25.04.2022,
without any delay on 26.04.2022, the detention order has been served upon the petitioner/detenue
in Central Jail Kot Bhalwal Jammu by the Executing officer, Sh. O.P.Chib Police Inspector
No.ESJ-955634 of Police Station Kathua. The detention record (Annexure R-3) further
demonstrates that the Government of Jammu and Kashmir Home Department Civil Secretariat
Jammu/Kashmir vide its order issued by Sh. R.K.Goyal, Financial Commissioner (ACS) Home dated
27.05.2022 clearly depicts that as per the information of Advisory Board dated 23.05.2022 under
sub- clause (b) of Section 9 of the Public Safety Act sufficient ground has been found for detention of
the petitioner/detenue, therefore Sh. R.K.Goyal, Financial Commissioner (ACS) Home in exercise of
powers conferred under clause (f) of Section 9 read with Section 11 of The Prevention of Illicit Traffic
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119659082/ 8
Reserved On : 17.10.2022 vs Union Territory Of Jammu & Kashmir ... on 31 January, 2023
in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, has confirmed the impugned detention order
No. PIT NDPS-4 of 2022 dated 25.04.2022 passed by respondent No. 2 whereby petitioner/detenue
has been detained for a period of one (01) year. There has been no delay in execution of the
detention order upon the petitioner. In Sushanta Kumar's case (supra) relied upon by learned senior
counsel for the petitioner, Hon'ble Supreme Court quashed the detention order on the ground that
there was unexplained delay and it took five (05) months for the detaining authority to pass the
order of preventive detention. Ratio of the judgment (supra) relied upon by the learned senior
counsel for the petitioner is distinguishable and inapplicable to the facts of the case in hand. In the
case in hand, without any delay the impugned detention order has been passed by respondent No. 2
on 25.04.2022 and served upon the petitioner/detenue on 26.04.2022, whereas, there is even no
unnecessary delay in passing the detention order by respondent No. 2 from the date of receipt of
dossier and other documents on 19.04.2022 from respondent No. 4. Respondent No. 2 after careful
perusal of the detention record and by application of mind came to the conclusion that the
petitioner/detenue is engaged in repeated illicit traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic
Substances cases, posing serious threat to the health and welfare of the people and in order to
prevent him from committing any further criminal act of narcotic traffic it is necessary to detain him
on the basis of the grounds mentioned in the dossier. As many as six days time has been taken by
the respondent No. 2 in passing the order of detention on 25.04.2022 from the date of receipt of the
dossier from respondent No. 4 on 19.04.2022, as such, there is no unnecessary delay in passing the
order of detention. The arguments put forth by the learned senior counsel for the petitioner that
huge delay has been caused in passing the impugned detention order and executing the same upon
the petitioner, are legally unsustainable and accordingly rejected.
8. Although right of personal liberty is most precious right, guaranteed under the Constitution,
which has been held to be transcendental, inalienable and available to a person independent of the
Constitution, yet the personal liberty may be curtailed, where a person faces a criminal charge or is
convicted of an offence and sentenced to imprisonment. A person is not to be deprived of his
personal liberty except in accordance with procedure established under law and the procedure as
laid down in Maneka Gandhi vs. Union of India, (1978 AIR SC 597), is to be just and fair. Where a
person is facing trial on a criminal charge and is temporarily deprived of his personal liberty owing
to criminal charge framed against him, he has an opportunity to defend himself and to be acquitted
of the charge in case prosecution fails to bring home his guilt. Where such person is convicted of
offence, he still has satisfaction of having been given adequate opportunity to contest the charge and
also adduce evidence in his defence. However, framers of the Constitution have, by incorporating
Article 22(5) in the Constitution, left room for detention of a person without a formal charge and
trial and without such person held guilty of an offence and sentenced to imprisonment by a
competent court. Its aim and object is to save the society from activities that are likely to deprive a
large number of people of their right to life and personal liberty. In such a case it would be
dangerous for the people at large to wait and watch as by the time ordinary law is set into motion,
the person having dangerous designs, would execute his plans, exposing general public to risk and
causing colossal damage to life and property. It is for that reason, necessary to take preventive
measures and prevent the person bent upon to perpetrate mischief from translating his ideas into
action. Article 22 (5) of the Constitution of India, therefore, leaves scope for enactment of preventive
detention law.

9. The essential concept of preventive detention is that the detention of a person is not to punish
him for something he has done, but to prevent him from doing it. The basis of detention is the
satisfaction of the executive of a reasonable probability of likelihood of detenue acting in a manner
similar to his past acts and preventing him by detention from doing the same. The Supreme Court in
Haradhan Saha vs. State of W.B. (1975) 3 SCC 198, points out that a criminal conviction, on the
other hand, is for an act already done, which can only be possible by a trial and legal evidence. There
is no parallel between prosecution in a Court of law and a detention order under the Act. One is a
punitive action and the other is a preventive act. In one case, a person is punished to prove his guilt
and the standard is proof, beyond reasonable doubt, whereas in preventive detention a man is
prevented from doing something, which is necessary for reasons mentioned in the Act, to prevent.
10. Article 22 (5) of the Constitution of India and Section 13 of the J&K Public Safety Act 1978,
guarantee safeguard to detenue to be informed, as soon as may be, of grounds on which order of
detention is made, which led to the subjective satisfaction of detaining authority and also to be
afforded earliest opportunity of making representation against order of detention. Detenue is to be
furnished with sufficient particulars to enable him to make a representation, which on being
considered, may obtain relief to him. Detention record, made available by learned counsel for
respondents, reveals that detention order was made on proper application of mind, to the facts of
the case and detenue was delivered at the time of execution of detention order, the material and
grounds of detention and also informed that he had a right to represent against his preventive
detention. Perusal of detention order depicts its execution. It further reveals that the copy of
detention warrant, grounds of detention, notice of detention, copy of dossier etc. were received by
the petitioner-detenue which were read over and explained to detenue in English/Hindi languages,
which detenue understood fully in token of which the signatures of detenue had been obtained. It
also divulges that detenue was informed that he can make representation to the government and
detaining authority. The grounds of detention are definite, proximate and free from any ambiguity.
The detenue has been informed with sufficient clarity what actually weighed with Detaining
Authority while passing detention order. Detaining Authority has narrated facts and figures that
made the authority to exercise its powers under Section 8 J&K Public Safety Act 1978 and record
subjective satisfaction that detenue was required to be placed under preventive detention in order to
prevent him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of the State.
11. Further, although grounds of detention are by and large is replica of dossier, yet one cannot lose
sight of the fact that five (05) FIRs have been lodged against the petitioner-detenue under various
sections of the NDPS Act which made basis to book him under the Public Safety Act so as to prevent
him from acting in a manner similar to his past acts or engaging in activities prejudicial to security
of the State or maintenance of public order. Further, the sponsoring authority has not only supplied
the material, viz; dossier, containing gist of the activities of the detenue, but has also supplied the
material in the shape of FIRs. All this material was before the detaining authority when it arrived at
subjective satisfaction that activities of the detenue were prejudicial to maintenance of public order
and requires preventive detention of detenue. Further, if in any given case a single act is found to be
not sufficient to sustain the order of detention that may well be quashed, but it cannot be stated as a
principle that one single act cannot constitute the basis for detention. On the contrary, it does. In
other words, it is not necessary that there should be multiplicity of grounds for making or sustaining

an order of detention. The same views and principles were reiterated by the Apex Court in Goutam
Jain vs. Union of India, AIR 2017 SC 230. In the present case, the petitioner-detenue seems to be a
hard core criminal and has become a terror figure among the people of the area as against him five
FIRs came to be registered in different police stations under various sections of the NDPS Act
between the period 2016 to the year 2019. Since the actions taken against the petitioner-detenue
under the ordinary law from time to time have not been proved to be deterrent, as such the
respondents had no other option but to keep him in preventive detention.
12. Personal liberty is one of the most cherished freedoms, perhaps more important than the other
freedoms guaranteed under the Constitution. It was for this reason that the Founding Fathers
enacted the safeguards in Article 22 in the Constitution so as to limit the power of the State to detain
a person without trial, which may otherwise pass the test of Article 21, by humanizing the harsh
authority over individual liberty. In a democracy governed by the rule of law, the drastic power to
detain a person without trial for security of the State and/or maintenance of public order must be
strictly construed. However, where individual liberty comes into conflict with an interest of the
security of the State or public order, then the liberty of the individual must give way to the larger
interest of the nation. These observations have been made by the Supreme Court in The Secretary to
Government, Public (Law and Order-F) and another vs. Nabila and another (2015) 12 SCC 127.
13. In the present case the petitioner has been involved in many criminal activities and against him
five (05) FIRs viz; (i) FIR No. 93/2016, (ii) FIR No. 12/2017, (iii) FIR No. 142/2017, (iv) FIR No.
214/2018 and (v) FIR No. 157/2019 under various Sections of the NDPS Act have been registered in
different police stations in District Kathua. FIR No. 93/2016 U/S 8- B/21/22 NDPS Act is registered
with Police Station Kathua and recovery of 10gms of Heroin has been affected from the petitioner, in
FIR No. 12/2017 U/S 8/21/22 NDPS Act registered with Police Station Lakhanpur recovery of 4.50
gms of Heroin has been affected from the petitioner, in FIR No. 142/2017 U/S 8/21/22 NDPS Act
registered with Police Statio, Kathua recovery of 06 gms of Heroin has been affected from the
petitioner, in FIR No. 214/2018 U/S 8/21/22 NDPS Act registered with Police Station Rajbagh
(Kathua) recovery of which 05 gms of heroin has been affected from the petitioner whereas in FIR
No. 157/2019 U/S 8/21/22 NDPS Act of P/S Kathua recovery of 9.35 gms of Heroin like substance
has been affected from the petitioner. From the bare perusal of the FIRs and the allegations therein
against the petitioner, it is discernable, that the petitioner is a hardcore criminal, has become a
terror figure among the people of the area, the actions taken against him under ordinary law from
time to time have not been proved to be deterrent. It seems that petitioner/detenue instead of
mending his ways has continuously been indulging in criminal activities and has not shown any
respect for the law of the land, as such, the petitioner/detenue has created a sense of alarm, scare
and a feeling of insecurity in the minds of the public of the area, has become a chronic fear amongst
the people of the area. Thus, the activities of the petitioner are of hardcore criminal and habitual of
indulging in acts of illicit traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances cases. The record so
produced reveals that the petitioner/detenue has been indulging in illegal trade in an organized
manner, which is a great threat for sustaining the conservative values of the society and the drug
trafficking also possess great threat to the society for the reason that the proceeds of the drug sale
can be utilized for financing of other criminal activities, hence, petitioner has been rightly detained
by Respondent No. 2.
