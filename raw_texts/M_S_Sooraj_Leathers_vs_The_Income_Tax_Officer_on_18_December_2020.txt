M/S Sooraj Leathers vs The Income Tax Officer on 18 December, 2020
JUDGMENT
[Judgment of the Court was made by T.S.SIVAGNANAM, J.] This appeal has been filed by the
assessee under Section 260 A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 ('the Act' for brevity), challenging the
order dated 22.04.2016 passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Chennai, 'C' Bench ('the
Tribunal' for brevity) in I.T.A.No.305/Mds/2016 for the Assessment Year 2009-2010.
2. The following Substantial Questions of Law were raised for consideration:
"1. In the facts and circumstances of the case, whether the Appellate Tribunal was
right in holding that the appellant has not produced any evidence before the
Commissioner of Income tax (Appeals)?
2. In the facts and circumstances of the case, whether the Appellate Tribunal was
right in upholding the addition u/s. 68 made by the assessing officer in respect of
other credits solely based on non-verfiability of sundry creditors and without
disputing the purchases and trading results of the appellant?
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/
2. We have heard Mr.K.Ravi, learned counsel for the appellant/assessee and
Ms.V.Pushpa, learned counsel for Mr.M.Swaminathan, learned Senior Standing
counsel for the respondent/Revenue.
3. The learned counsel for the appellant / assessee, on instructions, submitted that
the appellant / assessee intends to avail the benefit of Vivad Se Vishwas Scheme
('VVS Scheme' for brevity) and in this regard, the assessee is taking steps to file the
application / declaration in Form No.I.
4. It may not be necessary for this Court to decide the Substantial Questions of Law
framed for consideration on account of certain subsequent developments. The
Government of India enacted the Direct Tax Vivad Se Vishwas Act, 2020 (Act 3 of
2020) to provide for resolution of disputed tax and for matters connected therewith
or incidental thereto. The Act of the Parliament received the assent of the President
on 17th March 2020 and published in the Gazette of India on 17th March 2020.
5. In terms of the said Act, the assessee has been given an option to put an end to the
tax disputes, which may be pending at different levels either before the First
Appellate Authority or before the Tribunal or https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/
before the High Court or before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. Under Section
2(j) “disputed tax” has been defined. In terms of Section 3, where a declarant means a
person, who files a declaration under Section 4 on or before the last date files a
declaration to the designated authority in accordance with the provisions of Section 4

M/S Sooraj Leathers vs The Income Tax Officer on 18 December, 2020
in respect of tax arrears, then, notwithstanding anything contained in the Income Tax
Act or any other law for the time being in force, the amount payable by the declarant
shall be determined in terms of Section 3(a-c) thereunder.
6. The First Proviso to Section 3 states that in case, where an Appeal or Writ Petition
or Special Leave Petition is filed by the Income Tax authority on any issue before the
Appellate Forum, the amount payable shall be one-half of the amount in the table
stipulated in Section 3 calculated on such issue, in such a manner as may be
prescribed. The second proviso deals with the cases, where the matter is before the
Commissioner (Appeals) or before the Dispute Resolution Panel. The third proviso
deals with cases, where the issue is pending before the Income Tax Appellate
Tribunal. The filing of the declaration is as per Section 4 of the Act and the
particulars to be furnished are also mentioned in the Sub Sections of Section 4.
Section 5 of the Act deals with the time and manner of the payment and Section 6
deals with Immunity from initiation of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/
proceedings in respect of offence and imposition of penalty in certain cases. Section 9
of the Act deals with cases, where the Act 3 of 2020 will not be applicable.
7. As observed, the assessee is given liberty to restore this appeal in the event the
ultimate decision to be taken on the declaration to be filed by the assessee under
Section 4 of the said Act is not in favour of the assessee. If such a prayer is made, the
Registry shall entertain the prayer without insisting upon any application to be filed
for condonation of delay in restoration of the appeal and on such request made by the
assessee by filing a Miscellaneous Petition for Restoration, the Registry shall place
such petition before the Division Bench for orders.
8. In the light of the above, We direct the appellant / assessee to file the Form No.I
and the competent authority shall process the application / declaration in accordance
with the Act and pass appropriate orders as expeditiously as possible preferably
within a period of six (6) weeks from the date on which the declaration is filed in the
proper form.
9. With this direction, the Tax Case Appeal stands disposed of with the
aforementioned liberty and Consequently, the Substantial
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ Questions of Law are left open and connected
miscellaneous petition is closed. No costs.
