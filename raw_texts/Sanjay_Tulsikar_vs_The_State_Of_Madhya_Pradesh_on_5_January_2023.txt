Sanjay Tulsikar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 5 January, 2023
ORDER
Petitioner is aggrieved of actions of the respondents in terminating his service vide order dated
7.3.2020 passed by respondent No. 3 without following the procedure as laid down in Chapter 6 of
Prathmik Krishi Saakh Sahkari Sanstha Ke Karmachari Seva Niyam wherein Rule 28 provides that
after issuance of show cause notice to the delinquent employee, if reply is not found to be
satisfactory then, what steps are to be taken in terms of the provisions contained in Clause (v) of
Rule 28 onwards. It is submitted that none of this procedure was followed and at the dictates of the
Dy. Registrar, Cooperative Societies, impugned order is passed, which is arbitrary and illegal.
Shri Pravesh Naveriya submits that this ground was not taken in the writ petition and, therefore, it
is not open to the petitioner to raise this ground.
Shri Manas Mani Verma, learned Government Advocate submits that this petition is not
maintainable and the petitioner should have availed remedy under Section 55(2) of the M.P.
Cooperative Societies Act, 1960.
After hearing learned counsel for the parties and going through the record, firstly remedy under
Section 55(2) of the Cooperative Societies Act, 1960 would not have been efficacious and effective
remedy and as much as petitioner is able to demonstrate from the records filed by respondent Nos.
3 and 4 that petitioner's services were terminated at the instance of Dy. Commissioner, Cooperative
Societies, Balaghat, who had asked the Administrator/Manger to do so vide D.O. dated 6.3.2020
passed (Annexure R- 3/12). Thus, this plea of Shri Manas Mani Verma deserves to be rejected and is
rejected.
As far as submission made by Shri Pravesh Naveriya is concerned, whether any issue is raised or not
but the authorities while acting in consonance with the provisions of the Rules are supposed to know
and follow the Rules. It is admitted that Rule 28 (v) and onwards were not followed while passing
impugned order (Annexure P-5).
In view of such facts, the impugned order is quashed. The matter is relegated to the competent
authority to bestow its consideration and if it still decides to conduct an enquiry then conduct the
same in terms of the provisions contained in the Rules and Regulations, which have been enclosed
by the petitioner as (Annexure P-9) along with its rejoinder or any other Rules and Regulations
which are applicable to the facts and circumstances of the case without getting influenced by any
outsider including the Dy. Registrar, Cooperative Societies.
In above terms, petition is disposed of.
