Arvind Kumar vs State Of U.P. on 3 March, 2025
8. On the above premise, the learned counsel for applicant contends that case of
present applicant stands on better footing than that of aforementioned named and
charge sheeted accused, who have been granted the benefit of anticipatory bail by this
Court. He also contends that there is no such distinguishing feature on the basis of
which case of present applicant can be so distinguished from aforementioned named
and charge sheeted co-accused in whose favour, the benefit of anticipatory bail has
been extended by this court, so as to deny the present applicant the benefit of
anticipatory bail. He therefore submits that in view of above and for the facts and
reasons recorded in the bail orders of aforementioned named and charge sheeted
co-accused, liberty of present applicant is also liable to be protected by granting the
benefit of anticipatory bail. It is then contended that the F.I.R. giving rise to present
criminal proceedings was lodged on 27.09.2022. Applicant duly co-operated with
investigation. At no point of time any application was filed by Investigating Officer
before court below for issuance of non-bailable warrant or coercive process under
Section 82 Cr.P.C. against applicant to secure his presence in the investigation. Police
report in terms of Section 173 (2) Cr.P.C. has been submitted on 04.01.2024 upon
which applicant was summoned vide Summoning/Cognizance Taking order dated
15.01.2024 in the consequential criminal case as mentioned above. However, no
coercive process has been adopted by the court below to secure the presence of
applicant. Categorical averments regarding above has been made in paragraph 5 of
the affidavit filed in support of present application for anticipatory bail, which is not
disputed by the learned A.G.A. with reference to the instructions received by him. On
the above premise, he thus submits that liberty of applicant is also liable to be
protected by extending the benefit of anticipatory bail in his favour.
9. Even otherwise, applicant is a man of clean antecedents having no criminal history
to his credit except the present one. The police report (charge-sheet) in terms of
Section 173 (2) Cr.P.C. has already been submitted against applicant. Therefore the
entire evidence sought to be relied upon by the prosecution against applicant stands
crystallised. However, upto this stage, no such incriminating circumstance has
emerged on the record necessitating the custodial arrest of applicant during the
pendency of trial. It is thus urged by the learned counsel for applicant that custodial
arrest of applicant is not absolutely necessary to continue the trial. To lend support to
his submission, he has relied upon the judgement of Apex Court in Sumit
Subhashchandra Gangwal Vs. State of Maharashtra, 2023 LiveLaw (SC) 373
(Paragraph 5). On the above premise, it is thus urged by the learned counsel for
applicant, the benefit of anticipatory bail is liable to be extended in favour of present
applicant also. In case the applicant is granted the benefit of anticipatory bail, he
shall not misuse the same and shall co-operate with the trial.
10. Per contra, the learned A.G.A. has opposed the prayer for bail. He submits that
since applicant is a charge sheeted accused, therefore, he does not deserve any
indulgence by this Court. Placing reliance upon the judgement of Apex Court in P.
Chidambaram Vs. Directorate of Enforcement, AIR 2019 SC 4198, it is urged by the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/49535599/ 6
Arvind Kumar vs State Of U.P. on 3 March, 2025
learned A.G.A. that since no exceptional circumstance has emerged in the present
case, therefore, remedy lies to applicant to approach court concerned and apply for
regular bail. On the basis of above, the learned A.G.A. contends that no interference
is warranted by this Court in this application for anticipatory bail. However, the
learned A.G.A. could not dislodge the factual and legal submissions urged by the
learned counsel for applicant with reference to the record at this stage.
11. Having heard the learned counsel for applicant, the learned A.G.A. for State, upon
consideration of material on record, and considering the submissions urged by the
learned counsel for applicant in support of this application for anticipatory bail,
matter requires consideration.
12. Notice on behalf of opposite party-1 has been accepted by the learned A.G.A. He
prays for and is granted four weeks time to file counter affidavit. Applicant will have
two weeks thereafter to file rejoinder affidavit.
13. List after expiry of the aforesaid period.
14. Connect Criminal Misc. Anticipatory Bail Application U/S 438 Cr.P.C. No. 6299
of 2024 (Suresh Chand Vs. State of U.P. and another) and Criminal Misc.
Anticipatory Bail Application U/S 438 Cr.P.C. No. 5149 of 2024 (Suresh Chand
Sharma Vs. State of U.P.) alongwith this application for anticipatory bail.
15. In view of above, in the event of arrest, applicant- Arvind Kumar shall be released
on anticipatory bail in Case Crime No. 348 of 2022 under Section 120B I.P.C. and
Sections 7/8 of Prevention of Corruption Act 1988, Police Station- Dankaur,
District-Gautam Buddh Nagar on his furnishing a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- with
two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of concerned Court with the
following conditions:-
(i) The applicant shall not directly or indirectly, make any inducement, threat or
promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade her from
disclosing such facts to the Court;
(ii) The applicant shall not leave India without the previous permission of the Court

concerned.
(iii). In default of any of the conditions, the Investigating Officer/Govt. Advocate is at

5. Learned counsel for the applicant submits that subsequently vide the orders dated 25.9.2024,
27.11.2024 and 24.12025 interim anticipatory bail granted to the applicant was extended. It is

submitted that there is nothing on record to show that even after grant of anticipatory bail to the
applicant vide order dated 31.07.2024 he has misused the said liberty or has evaded the process of
