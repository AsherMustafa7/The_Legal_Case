Smt. Mamta Pathak vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 29 July, 2025
Pramod Rohit (PW.3) and in pursuance of merg investigation, he had prepared Lash Panchnama
and Safina Form and had taken the statements of complainant Smt.Mamta Pathak. He had prepared
the crime details and had collected postmortem report (Exhibit P/1) from the doctors and found
that in the opinion of post-mortem mortem doctors, Dr. Neeraj Pathak S/o.Chintamani Pathak,
aged about 65 years, R/o.Loknathpuram, District District Chhatarpur died due to electrocution. The
first information report pertaining to Crime No.288/2021 was registered against Smt.Mamta Pathak
for the offence under Section 302 of I.P.C.
3. The investigation commenced. The memorandum under Section 27 of o the Indian Evidence Act,
1872 of the accused was obtained and as per her memorandum, the objects like sleeping pills,
electric wire, DVR from the C.C.T.V camera installed in the house of the deceased, footage from the
NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 C.C.T.V. camera, which contains
views views of the house of the accused, the video recording etc, were seized. After investigation, a
charge sheet was filed against the appellant in the Court of Magistrate for the offence under Section
302 of the I.P.C. On 6.8.2021, the learned Chief Judicial Magi Magistrate, Chhatarpur committed
the case to Court of Sessions from where it was transferred to the Court of learned III Additional
Sessions Judge, Chhatarpur for trial. The learned III Additional Sessions Judge, Chhatarpur found
the charge proved against the appellant and convicted & sentenced her as mentioned in Paragraph
No.1 of this judgment.
4. The appellant submits that she is innocent. She has been falsely implicated in this case. She was
having very cordial and loving relationship with her husband Late Dr.Neeraj Pathak and, therefore,
she cannot even think of causing any harm to her husband to whom she was committed for life,
therefore, it is a case of false implication. The appellant also submits that she was working as
Lecturer in Government College at Chhatarpur while her husband was the Chief Medical Officer in
Government District Hospital at Chhatarpur. At the time of the incident, both of them were residing
in the house at Lokhnathpurarm. The prosecution case is ill ill-founded founded because it is based
on presumption esumption that there were frequent quarrels between the appellant NEUTRAL
CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 Smt.Mamta Pathak and the deceased Dr.Neeraj
Pathak on the basis of suspected fidelity of her husband. The evidence, which has been collected by
the prosecution is neither relevant nor scientific scientific so to substantiate the involvement of the
appellant and connect her with the alleged offence.
5. The allegation of frequent quarrels between the husband and wife is not substantiated from the
testimony of Dhaniram Ahirwar (PW.2), a Chowkidar for the house ouse where the incident took
place, who states in his examination-in-
examination chief that he has no knowledge about the incident. He only knew that Dr.Neeraj Pathak
was residing at Loknathpuram whereas his wife was residing in the house at Peptech Colony but at
the time of the incident, Smt.Mamta Pathak was residing with Dr Neeraj Pathak at Loknathpuram
as Dr Neeraj Pathak had brought her back ten months' prior to the date of incident. Dhaniram
Ahirwar (PW.2) states that the couple have two children, namely, Nitish aged ged about 35 years
and younger son Manas, aged about 30 years, who is residing abroad. The elder son Nitish Pathak
was earlier residing with his mother and was visiting his father. Dhaniram Ahirwar (PW.2) was

declared hostile and when leading questions were were put to him, he states that he has no
knowledge as to the dispute between husband and wife and the reason for their separation.
Dhaniram Ahirwar (PW.2) in his cross-examination cross NEUTRAL CITATION NO.
2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 admits that at the time of the incident, the corona virus was in
spread at Chhatarpur, atarpur, as a result of which, ten to fifteen persons died. The appellant
submits that Dhaniram Ahirwar (PW.2) has not supported the theory of frequent quarrels between
the couple.
6. Similarly, reading from the testimony of Chhandilal Bajpai (PW.4), it is submitted by the
appellant that the prosecution allegation that Dr.Neeraj Pathak had called this witness on 29.4.2021
at about 11:51 AM complaining about the harassment being meted out by the appellant and locking
him inside the bathroom is also not made out. Reading extensively from the testimony of Chhandilal
Bajpai (PW.4), it is pointed out that his testimony alone is not sufficient to implicate the appellant
by attaching any motive and, therefore, the prosecution has a very weak case.
7. It is pointed out by the appellant that the testimony of driver Ratan Singh Yadav (PW.12) proves
that she had gone to Jhansi alongwith him & her elder son and when she returned back from Jhansi,
her husband was alive. She had attended him and thereafter in the morning, he was found dead.
Hence, that theory of the appellant causing electrocution to Dr.Neeraj Pathak is not made out.
NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674
8. Ratan Singh Yadav (PW.12) states that Smt.Mamta Pathak is known to him as in the year 2015, he
had given driving license to her. She was po posted at Maharajpur College and sometimes he used to
drop her at Maharajpur College. On 30.4.2021 at about 6:00 AM, when Smt.Mamta Pathak had
called him to take her to Jhansi, he informed her that he is busy in the work of driving and shall
reach after two hours. At 8:00 AM, when he had reached her Loknathpuram house, Smt.Mamta
Pathak asked him to take her to Jhansi for dialysis. At 9:00 AM, he had taken Smt.Mamta Pathak
and her son Nitish in Ecosport Car to Jhansi. On way, they had stopped at Harpalpur wher where
Smt.Mamta Pathak had given a bag to her mother. When they had reached Jhansi at about 1:00
noon, Dr.Mamta Pathak told him that she has to show herself to Dr.P.K Jain for dialysis. They kept
on searching the dialysis centre of Dr.P.K.Jain but when it was not traceable, they reached
Chiranjeev Hospital. Smt.Mamta Pathak had gone inside the Chiranjeev Hospital but the hospital
people did not entertain her as she was not carrying her Covid report. Ratan Singh Yadav (PW.12)
clearly states that the dialysis of Smt.Mamta Pathak was not performed. They had roamed at Sadar
Bazaar upto 4:00 PM and when he asked Smt.Mamta Patahk that her Covid report must have been
available by now but the Covid report was not available, thus, at 7:00 PM, NEUTRAL CITATION

pur. They returned to Chhatarpur and Ratan Singh Yadav (PW.12) parked the vehicle in the porch
and left for his home.
9. It is submitted that Ratan Singh Yadav (PW.12) in his examination examination-in-

chief though states that when he had parked the car in the porch, he had seen Smt.Mamta Pathak to
be upset. When he had asked her as to why she is upset and why she did not consume any food for
the whole day then she had confessed that she committed a blunder mistake but did not narrate as
to what mistake was committed. He came out of the gate of the house of Smt.Mamta Pathak and met
Dhaniram Ahirwar (PW.2), who had asked him as to who all had gone to Jhansi and whether the
doctor had accompanied them or not. But it is submitted that in cross-examination, cross
examination, Ratan Singh Yadav Yada (PW.12) has denied that Smt.Mamta Pathak on return from
Chhatarpur had said that she committed a mistake and if she would have called the doctor then that
mistake would not have taken place. Hence, the testimony of Ratan Singh Yadav (PW.12) is of no
assistance.
istance.
10. The appellant points out that the postmortem report (Exhibit P/1) shows the cause of death as
shock due to cardio respiratory failure, as a result of electric current at multiple sites and duration of
death to be within 36 to 72 hours since postmortem. The circumstantial evidence and the crime
scene NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 evidence should be
considered. The autopsy was conducted on 1.5.2021 at 3:30 PM. The death occurred during
summer. Article A3 shows presence of a cooler in the room from which the dead body of Dr.Neeraj
Pathak w was recovered. As per jurisprudence of Modi, the rate of putrefaction enhances with
humid conditions as moisture and humidity are enhancers. No such putrefaction was found on the
dead body and, therefore, the death of Dr.Neeraj Pathak being shown to have ta taken ken place
within 36 to 72 hours prior to the time of postmortem is not corroborated from the condition of the
dead body.
11. The appellant submits that the prosecution's story is based on the circumstantial evidence and
the medical evidence. Dr.Neeraj Pathak Path had taken voluntary retirement due to his illness on
1.2.2019 after serving for about 39 years as Government doctor. She too had served with distinction
in the Education Department for 36 years. It is alleged that on 29.4.2021, she had given electric
shock ock to Dr.Neeraj Pathak so to cause his homicidal death but the chain of circumstances is not
complete to implicate the appellant.
12. The Merg Intimation No.26/21 was recorded under Section 174 of the Cr.P.C by the Sub
Inspector Pramod Rohit (PW.3) on 1.5.2019.
1.5 He had prepared Shav Panchinama. There was white colour bandage on his forehead. NEUTRAL
CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 There were red colour patches on the side of
left hand. The deceased had an old injury mark on his wrist. The palm was black & blue. On the right
arm, there were reddish sh bluish patches. On the left knee, there was old abrasion wound so also
below right knee. Both the soles of feet had reddish bluish patches on his body.
13. The prosecution examined fourteen witnesses, marked twenty twenty-three exhibits and
nineteen material objects whereas the defence examined five witnesses and adduced fifty-two fifty
exhibits in the evidence.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130564935/ 4
Smt. Mamta Pathak vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 29 July, 2025
14. The appellant submits that a case of circumstantial evidence is to be seen in the light of the law
laid down by the Apex Court in Sharad Birdhichand Sarda da versus State of Maharashtra (1984) 4
SCC 116. Another leading judgment on the subject is from Assam High Court whereby a Division
Bench of the Apex Court in Sujit Biswas versus State of Assam (2013) 12 SCC 406 has discussed the
aspect of circumstantial evidence. (Para 14)
15. The appellant submits that from the First Information Report (Exhibit P/18), the Postmortem
Report (Exhibit P/1), the Memorandum and recovery of Articles under Section 27 of the Indian
Evidence Act, 1872, the Weapon of Offence, the FSL report, the motive and theory of last seen
together do not fulfil the requirement of burden of proof under Section 106 of the Indian NEUTRAL
CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 Evidence Act, 1872. Since the chain of
circumstances is not fully established and being unreliable, it does not complet completee chain to
prove the guilt of the appellant with the alleged crime.
16. The appellant submits that there is delay of five days in lodging of the First Information Report
and that will vitiate the case of the prosecution. The intimation of death of Dr.Neera Dr.Neerajj
Pathak was received at Police Station on 1.5.2021 at 10:26 AM but the First Information Report was
lodged on 6.5.2021 at 12:54 PM for the offencee under section 302 of I.P.C against an unknown
person. No reason is assigned for delay in lodging of the Firs First Information Report. The First
Information Report does not contain signatures of the Officer-In-Charge Charge of the Police
Station.
17. In support of her contention, the appellant places reliance on the judgment of the Apex Court in
Lalita Kumari versus Governm Government of Uttar Pradesh & Others (2014) 2 SCC 1 wherein it is
held that it is a mandatory duty cast upon the Police Officials to register an FIR once the report or
complaint discloses a cognizable offence. The appellant also places reliance on the judgment of the
Apex Court in Harilal etc versus State of Madhya Pradesh (Now Chhattisgarh) 2023 SCC Online
1124. NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674
18. The appellant submits that the copy of First Information Report was not sent to the concerned
Court at all and, therefore, no date and time of dispatch dispat of the First Information Report to the
concerned Court is mentioned. The receipt of copy of the First Information Report by the Local
magistrate was not included in the Charge Sheet, which is violation of Section 157(1) of the Cr.P.C.
With regard to del delay ay in transmitting the First Information Report to the concerned Court, the
appellant places reliance on the judgment of the Apex Court in Chotkau versus State of Uttar
Pradesh (2023) 6 SCC 742.
19. The appellant submits that in the postmortem requisition, the investigating officer has given
information that the death appears to be due to unknown cause. There is major negligence in
postmortem examination. Firstly, the dead body was not identified by any relative before starting
the postmortem and secondly, Dr.Mukul Sahu (PW.1) deposes in his examination examination-
in-chief chief that the mouth of the dead body was closed, which is absolutely impossible and
unreliable finding and indicative of negligence in the postmortem examination because after death

Smt. Mamta Pathak vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 29 July, 2025
within 2-3 2 3 hours, due to primary muscular relaxation, the lower jaw falls and the mouth opens,
which is an irreversible change. In support of the aforesaid contention, reference is made NEUTRAL
CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 to Modi's Textbook of Medical Jurisprudence
and Toxicology, 25th Edition, Page 341, Para 393.
20. The appellant submits that the finding of Dr.Mukul Sahu (PW.1) is contrary to the deposition of
Pramod Rohit (PW.3), who states in his examination-in-chief chief that the mouth was semi open.
As per Lash Panchama (Exhibit P/6), the teeth were visible, which which are supported by the
photographs (Exhibits A4 to A18) and, therefore, the finding of Dr.Mukul Sahu (PW.1) is perverse.
21. The appellant submits that the postmortem report is not reliable inasmuch as the facts
documented in the postmortem report are not consistent with the opinion drawn regarding the
cause and duration of death. Though a team of three doctors conducted the postmortem but only
one doctor was examined as a prosecution witness.
22. The appellant submits that she had filed an application unde under Section 311 of the Cr.P.C for
calling remaining doctors to prove some facts of postmortem report but opportunity was not given
to her and that has vitiated the case. However, it is admitted that when the appellant had filed an
application under Section 4482 82 of the Cr.P.C before the Hon'ble High Court then that application
was dismissed vide order dated 23.4.2022. NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674
JBP:34674
23. The appellant points out that duration of death is mentioned as 36 to 72 hours since
postmortem. However, certain changes like rigor mortis, lividity (hypostatise) and decomposition
are not supported with the Standard Textbook of Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology. In the
postmortem report, the rigor mortis passed of but in absence of concomitant decomposition
changes, the aforesaid finding cannot cannot be relied upon to estimate the duration of death.
During summer in Northern India, decomposition commences before rigor mortis has completely
passed off.
24. The appellant points out that there are two characteristic features of decomposition, namely,
change of colour of the body and formation of foul smelling gases but they have not been reported in
the postmortem report. There was no Air Conditioner in the be bedroom droom in which the
deceased Dr.Neeraj Pathak was lying, a room on the first floor. An indoor Cooler is visible in the
photograph. Thus, humidity due to indoor Cooler will accelerate decomposition. The autopsy
surgeon Dr.Mukul Sahu (PW.1) and Pramod Rohit (PW.3) PW.3) reported lividity or red/red blue
spots on different parts of the body, which are indicative of the death within 6 to 12 hours and that is
not a case of the prosecution. Reference is made to the Modi's Textbook of NEUTRAL CITATION
NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicolog Toxicology, y, 25th
Edition, Page 339, Para 4, Line 17 to 26.
25. The appellant submits that the finding of internal organ as healthy and congested does not
support the duration of death. Reliance is placed on the Essentials of Forensic Medical and
Toxicology, 35th Edition by K.S.Narayan Reddy and O.P.Murty, Page Nos.124 Nos.124-125.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130564935/ 6
Smt. Mamta Pathak vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 29 July, 2025
125. She also draws attention of this Court towards the testimony of Dr.D.S.Badkur (DW.2) to
support her contention that it is not possible to differentiate between antemortem and postmortem
electrical burns referring to the Essentials of Forensic Medical and Toxicology, 35th Edition by
K.S.Narayan Reddy and O.P.Murty Page No.256. The distinction between electric burn mark and
thermal burn mark is not possible. It can only be made by acro reaction and scanning canning
electron microscopy from the deposition of metal particles into the skin/tissue but no such attempt
was made.
26. The appellant points out that Dr.Mukul Sahu (PW.1) states that there was exit wound of electric
current over scrotum, which is impossi impossible because exit mark will appear when the body was
earthed or grounded. Since the deceased was lying on a wooden bed with mattresses and bed sheet
and his feet were kept on a plastic chair, all the material i.e.wood, plastic and clothes being non non-
NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 conductors rs of electric current,
there was no earthing and no possibility of any harm from the electric shock. Reliance is placed on
the Textbook of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology by Krishna Vij, 6th Edition, Page 165.
27. The appellant points out that Dr.Mukul Sahu Sahu (PW.1) states that there was cotton bandage
on the forehead under which there were two stitches, which were at least 7 to 8 days' old but no
investigation was carried out as to who stitched the wound and how & under what circumstances,
they were contacted.
ted. The forensic expert did not seal the room from where the dead body was recovered. There was
no blood or any skin found around the bed. There was no reason for her husband succumbing to
electric shock as the house was equipped with MCBs and RCCB's, whi which ch would have tripped
on leakage of current within 1/50 second. To support the aforesaid contention, the appellant draws
attention of this Court to the cross cross-examination examination of herself and that of Munnilal
Kushwaha (DW.4), who had carried out the electric maintenance tenance in the house.
28. The appellant points out that there is glaring error inasmuch as the scene of crime was not
examined by the Scientific Officer of the Forensic Science Laboratory or by some qualified or
competent Electrical Expert for evaluation off circumstances of the alleged fatal electrocution.
Hence, in the light of the NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 judgment
rendered in Nagendra Sah versus State of Bihar (2021) 10 SCC 725, the postmortem report alone
cannot be the sole basis of conviction for the offence under Section 302 of o the I.P.C.
29. The appellant points out that even the electric switchboard has not been shown in the Spot Map
though the cause of death is shown as electrocution. The Spot Map was faulty as it failed to show two
staircases in open gallery and the patient waiting hall leading to the Private Clinic of Dr.Neeraj
Pathak. Thus, placing reliance on Paragraph No.3 of the judgment of the Apex Court in Shingara
Singh versus State of Haryana & Another (2003) 12 SCC 758, the appellant submits that the Spot
Map witho without ut essential feature cannot be relied upon to arrive at any conclusion.

Smt. Mamta Pathak vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 29 July, 2025
30. The appellant points out that Malkhan Singh (PW.7) carried out photography and videography
of the dead body of the deceased and the postmortem but no certificate was produced under Section
65B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. Malkhan Singh (PW.7) did not produce the memory card as
primary electronic evidence and later a certificate under section 65B was produced but since it was
not countersigned by the Scientific Officer of the Forensic rensic Science Laboratory Unit, it has no
relevance in the eyes of law. The DVD (Exhibit A-19)
19) containing video recording of the postmortem when was NEUTRAL CITATION NO.
2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 played in the Trial Court was found to be empty as is mentioned
in the order sheet dated 20.5.2022. The wit witnesses nesses of seizure Exhibits P/12 and P/13 were
not examined, therefore, whole trial was vitiated.
31. On merg inquest report, her signatures were obtained under duress and they are not admissible
in evidence. There are certain other discrepancies like Lash Panchyatnama. There is overwriting in
the date. The police had not seized the bed sheet on which deceased Dr.Neeraj Pathak was lying but
had only seized some medicine and a typed letter under a seizure memo Exhibit P/4. Her son Nitish,
who was available in the Police Station on 7.5.2021 was not examined. There is doubt as to the
seizure and, therefore, the seizure of letter (Exhibit A1) is indicative of deep conspiracy against the
appellant.
32. At the time of recording of the memorandum (Exhibit P/14) unde under Section 27 of the Indian
Evidence Act,1872 at 11:00 AM dated 8,5.2021, she was not in custody as she was arrested at 13.10
hours on 8.5.2021 vide Exhibit P/17, therefore, she being not in police custody, that memorandum is
not admissible in evidence.
33. As per Seizure Memo (Exhibit P/15), the recovered articles were not hidden but were kept on the
makeup box near the bed inside the same house where Dr.Neeraj Pathak passed away, therefore,
even that discovery is not NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674
admissible under Section 27 of the Indian Indian Evidence Act, 1872. Bilal Khan (PW.9) and
Mohammad Shamim (PW.10), witnesses of seizure, could not even answer about the directions of
entrance gate of the house and that vitiates their testimony.
34. Mohammad Shamim (PW.10) is a relative of policeman and, a therefore his testimony is not
admissible so also the testimony of Bilal Khan (PW.9) is not admissible being in violation of section
100(4) of the Cr.P.C. There is no link of allegedly discovered articles with the death of Dr.Neeraj
Pathak so to connectt the appellant with the alleged crime.
35. The Olanzapine is not a sleeping tablet. The Forensic Science Laboratory Officer did not report
as to how much quantity of Olanzapine Olanzapine-10 Tablet was found in the visceral organ of the
deceased. Exhibit P/23 is the Forensic Science Laboratory Report of the alleged electric wires but
since no part of the electric wires was without insulation, therefore, no fatal current could have been
transmitted through a fully insulated wire. There is no finding of metallization, which is a specific
feature of electric injury. Hence, Reliance is placed on the judgments rendered in Rajesh and
Another versus State of Madhya Pradesh AIR 2023 SC 4759 Para 24, 25, 26, 28 and 29 and

36. The appellant submits that there are contradictions regarding the colour and length of the
electric wire, which is alleged to be used as weapon of offence. Bilal Khan (PW.9) states that the
length of the electric wire wa was about 10 to 11 feet and its colour was black whereas another
seizure witness Mohammad Shamim (PW.10) states that the length of the electric wire was 9 to 10
feet and its colour was white. The Investigating Officer Jagatpal Singh (PW.14) states that the length
ength of the electric wire was 11 meter and the wire was criss-crossed crossed and was in two colours
red and black. The Investigating Officer Jagatpal Singh (PW.14) did not obtain the finger prints on
the cut wire and the DVR to find out the person as to who had cut the wires.
37. Reliance is placed by the appellant on the judgments of the Apex Court in Laxman Prasad Alias
Laxman versus State of Madhya Pradesh (2023) 6 SCC 399 and Krishan versus State of Haryana
2024 SCC Online (SC)
38. Another discrepancy, wh which ich is pointed out by the appellant is that the recording of
C.C.T.V cameras were viewed on computer screen in the Court but no evidence was found regarding
the death of Dr.Neeraj Pathak against NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674
JBP:34674 the appellant. The C.C.T.V cameras are installed on the upper floor of the house and
allow the views of the empty area around the house and the C.C.T.V display screen can be turned on
and off through switches and, therefore, the aforesaid recording is not reliable.
39. The appellant submits that there is no motive and the false allegations have been made against
her that she was residing separately from her husband for sometime. There was no dispute between
the appellant and her husband. In support of the aforesaid, she places reliance on certain
photographs (Exhibits (Exhibi D4, D18 & D48).
40. The appellant submits that the prosecution has falsely implicated her overlooking the fact that
her elder son Nitish Pathak was also at home and he did not observe anything obnoxious or foul
about the conduct of the appellant. She had ad no motive and the only interest she has is to serve
her elder son Nitish Pathak, who was unwell but admits that with medicines and some extra care,
his health and behaviour was 95% normal. In this regard, the appellant places reliance on the
judgment of the Apex Court in Shivaji Chintappa Patil versus State of Maharashtra (2021) 5 SCC
626. Para 29, 30, 32.
41. The appellant submits that the theory of last seen as propagated by the prosecution is also of no
relevance as the appellant was married to Dr.Neeraj NEUTRAL CITATION NO.

clinic was opened and operated by 7 to 8 persons including the laboratory personnel and the
medical store personnel etc. The appellant had a conversation at about 9:30 PM on 30.4.2021 and
Dr.Neeraj Pathak was not responding at about 7:00 AM on 1.5.2021 while in his bed.
ed. There was a gap of about 10 hours of night in between and, therefore, the theory of last seen will
not be applicable because of the time gap of 10 hours. Section 106 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872
will not relieve the prosecution from establishing th thee guilt of the appellant beyond all reasonable
doubts. In n this regard, the appellant places reliance on the judgment of the Apex Court in Gargi
versus State of Haryana (2019) 9 SCC 738. Para 28.1 & 28.3 as well as the judgment of the Apex
Court in State of Madhya Pradesh versus Phoolchand Rathore 2023 SCC Online SC 537. Para 24.
42. The appellant submits that the actual cause of death of Dr.Neeraj Pathak was his old age, which
was 65 years. His death occurred in the intervening NEUTRAL CITATION NO.
2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 night of 30th April and 1st May ay when there was second wave
of Covid Covid-19 at its highest peak. Dr.Mukul Sahu (PW.1) had sent the sample of RTPCR corona
test as admitted by him in Paragraph No.3 of his examination-in-chief examination but that report
was not submitted before the Trial Court whereas D Dr.Neeraj r.Neeraj Pathak was suffering from
symptoms like corona and was in home isolation. The actual cause of death was due to narrowing
and calcification of coronary arteries due to old age but the autopsy surgeon did not open the
coronary arteries and did not report eport the conditions of the blood vessels of Dr.Neeraj Pathak.
43. The appellant submits that Dr.Neeraj Pathak was a patient of High Blood Pressure and his TMT
was positive in the year 2007. The fatal subdural haematoma may occur in older people even after a
minor head injury because it is pointed out that Dr.Neeraj Pathak due to slipping could have
sustained such haematoma as pointed out by Dr.Mukul Sahu (PW.1) but no CT scan was carried out
to verify the cause of such subdural haematoma.
44. The appellant submits that Chhandilal Bajpai (PW.4) gave false and fabricated deposition.
Chhandilal Bajpai (PW.4) states that he had two telephonic conversations with Dr.Neeraj Patak on
29.4.2021. He had recorded those conversations and compiled them in a pen drive, w which hich
was handed over to the Police but none of the witnesses of seizure have testified the same.
NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 Ashish Bajpai was not examined
whereas Mohammad Shamim (PW.10) denied twice for being the witness of the alleged pen drive.
45. The appellant submits that Chh Chhandilal andilal Bajpai (PW.4) had neither given his mobile
from which recording was made nor the mobile of her husband was seized and there being no
certificate under Section 65B(4) of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 with the alleged pen drive, which
was the seconda secondary electronic evidence, the aforesaid evidence is not admissible in the eyes
of law and, therefore, the authenticity of the pen drive is doubtful. In this regard, reliance is placed
on the judgment of the Apex Court in Arjun Pandit Rao Khotkar versus Kailash sh Kushanrao
Gorantyal & Others (2020) 7 SCC
1.Para 14 and 59.

Smt. Mamta Pathak vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 29 July, 2025
46. The appellant submits that there were several lapses in investigation like the Investigating
Officer Jagatpal Singh (PW.14) prepared unscaled spot map, which did not even show the electric
switchboard, two staircases connecting the first floor to an open gallery gallery and a hall of
Dr.Neeraj Pathak's private clinic. No seizure was made from the room where Dr.Neeraj Pathak
passed away. No investigation was carried out by the Forensic Science Laboratory Officer or the
Electrical Engineer/Expert. The pillow cover an and bed-sheet were not sealed. Copy of the First
Information Report was not transmitted to NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674
JBP:34674 the concerned Court. The mobile of Chhandilal Bajpai (PW.4) was not seized. The date of
arrest of the appellant was not recorded besides not checking the C.C.T.V footage.
ge. There is no explanation as to why Malkhan Singh (PW.7) had given photographs and
videography after thirteen days. There was no evidence that the appellant purchased Olanzapine
tablets and electric wire. The finger prints were not examined. The Covid RT RTPCR PCR report was
not taken.
The residents of the house were not examined and this all will vitiate the proceedings in the light of
the judgment of the Apex Court in Maghavendra Pratap Singh @ Pankaj Singh versus State of
Chhattisgarh 2023 SCC Online (SC) 486.. Para 19 and 39. Thus, pointing out so many lacunas in the
investigation and pleading her innocence, the appellant submits that she has been falsely implicated
in this case. Hence, prayer is made to set aside the impugned judgment of conviction and acquit her
from the charge of Section 302 of the I.P.C.
47. Shri Surendra Singh, learned Senior Counsel for the appellant places reliance on the judgment of
Ramesh Chandra Agrawal versus Regency Hospital Limited & Others AIR 2010 SC 806. Para 14 & 17
to support the submission that Dr.Mukul Sahu (PW.1), who had conducted the postmortem on the
body of deceased Dr.Neeraj Pathak had not given any opinion on the NEUTRAL CITATION NO.
2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 duration of death. Mere presence in the house is not sufficient
to hold somebody guilty and in support of tthe he aforesaid contention, the judgment of the Apex
Court in Mulak Raj & Others versus State of Haryana (1996) 7 SCC 308 is relied upon.
48. Learned Senior Counsel for the appellant submits that the absence of the certificate under
Section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 is dealt with in Arjun Pandit Rao Khotkar versus
Kailash Kushanrao Gorantyal & Others (supra).
49. Learned Senior Counsel for the appellant submits that the appellant was in joint possession of
the house. The appellant's elder son Nitis Nitish Pathak was living with her and, therefore, it cannot
be said that the recovery is on exclusive identification of the appellant. He places reliance on the
judgment of the Apex Court in Prem Singh versus State (NCT of Delhi) (2023) 3 SCC 372. Para 43 to
contend ntend that even her son could have done it. There was no motive and since the testimony of
Chhandilal Bajpai (PW.4) is not corroborated, therefore, the appellant is liable to be acquitted from
the charge of Section 302 of the I.P.C.
50. Shri Manas Mani Verma, Verma, learned Government Advocate for the State submits that in the
FSL report (Exhibit P/21), the results for presence of NEUTRAL CITATION NO.

wrapper of 10 tablets on which Oleanz Oleanz-10 10 is printed. Six tablets were found intact and
four tablets were absent. No chemical poison was found in the preservative Article-C. Article C. The
presence of Cooler shown in the photograph Articles-11 to 18 will slow down the state of
decomposition.
51. Reading from the testimony of Munnilal Kushwaha (DW.4), learned Government Advocate for
the State submits that Munnilal Kushwaha (DW.4) admitted preparing the Certificate Exhibit D/2 at
the instance of the appellant. Munnilal Kushwaha (DW.4) admits in his cross cross-examination
examination that after current is given, RCCBs will fall and it can be restarted. Thus, reading from
the testimony of Munnilal Kushwaha (DW.4), learned Government Advocate submits its that minor
discrepancies will not adversely affect the case of prosecution, which has been proved very
meticulously. There is evidence of last seen. There is a motive and also the fact that the appellant
tried to camouflage her presence by going to Jha Jhansi nsi without any purpose as is admitted by
her driver Ratan Singh Yadav (PW.12), who admits that on way to Jhansi, when they reached
Alipura, Smt.Mamta Pathak asked him to take her to Harpalpur where she had given a bag to her
mother. Thereafter, they NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 had
reached eached Jhansi at about 1:00 PM but though she had stated that she has to undergo dialysis
at Jhansi but as the clinic of Dr.P.K.Jain could not be traced, she did not collect her corona test
report and no dialysis was performed on Smt.Mamta Pathak. He had brought brought her back to
Chhatarpur alongwith her son Nitish Pathak and left them at Chhatarpur.
52. Learned Government Advocate for the State submits that Chhandilal Bajpai (PW.4) has proved
that on 29.4.2021, Dr.Neeraj Pathak had called him at about 11:51 AM informing him that
Smt.Mamta Pathak was torturing him and had closed him in the bathroom. She ha had d not given
any food to him for 2 to 3 days. She had pushed him in the bathroom, as a result of which, he had
sustained injuries. She had broken his almirah and taken out cash, ATM, keys of the vehicle and
other material like FD etc and had kept them with herself. Dr.Neeraj Pathak had requested to free
him after contacting the Police. His son Ashish had contacted his another friend Arvind Pateriya,
who had asked the T.I. of Police Station Civil Line to help Dr.Neeraj Pathak. The police personnel
had freed Dr.Neeraj r.Neeraj Pathak from the custody of Smt.Mamta Pathak and had put a
photograph of Dr.Neeraj Pathak on the mobile phone of Arvind Pateriya and that photograph in
turn was sent on the mobile phone of Ashish S/o.Chhandilal Bajpai (PW.4). He had seen a bandage
on the forehead of NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 Dr.Neeraj
Pathak. At 12:54 PM, Chhandilal Bajpai (PW.4) had called Dr.Neeraj Patak and asked him as to
whether he had come out or not then Dr.Neeraj Pathak confirmed that he was freed.
53. Learned Government Advocate for the State points out that when the seizure of pen drive is
proved; played in the open Court and after it being played, the Laptop was closed and Article-A2 pen
drive was sealed in an envelope and this was done at the time of the cross-examination cross
examination then the appellant's counsel sel having right to question the validity of the conversation
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130564935/ 12
Smt. Mamta Pathak vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 29 July, 2025
and having failed to do so, the appellant is not entitled to raise objection on technical grounds now.
54. Learned Government Advocate for the State submits that the Trial Court in Paragraph No.4 .4
has clearly recorded a finding that in the Government Laptop of the Court, seized pen drive was
opened and played. There were two audio-feeds feeds in the pen drive, which were played in front of
the parties present in the Court wherein Chhandilal Bajpai (PW.
(PW.4)
4) admitted that it was the conversation, which was recorded between him and Dr.Neeraj Pathak at
11:51 and 11:54 or 11:59.
55. Learned Government Advocate for the State places reliance on the judgment of the Apex court in
Bodhraj Alias Bodha & Others vers versus State NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674
JBP:34674 of Jammu & Kashmir (2002) 8 SCC 45 to contend that the evidence of last seen comes
into play where the time gap between the point of time when the deceased and the accused were
seen last alive and when the deceased is found dead, is so small then possibility of any person other
than the accused being the author of the crime becomes impossible. Some delay in sending the FIR
to the Magistrate, if properly explained, did not have substance. The conviction can be held solely on
the circumstantial evide evidence, nce, however, it should be tested on the touchstone of law relating
to circumstantial evidence as has been laid down by the Apex Court in Hanumant versus State of
Madhya Pradesh (1952) 2 SCC 71. Since the chain of circumstances is complete, the conviction of
appellant does not call for any interference.
56. Learned Government Advocate for the State places reliance on the judgment of the Apex Court
in Sushil Kumar versus State of Punjab (2009) 10 SCC 434 wherein it is held that some minor
discrepancies, whic which are bound to appear in natural course of conduct of a normal human
being and there being no serious material discrepancies in the testimony of the prosecution witness,
there arises no reason to doubt the credibility of the prosecution witnesses. No reason reason has
been assigned as to why they would falsely try to implicate the accused. Thus, it is pointed out that
the testimony NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 of prosecution
witnesses cannot be doubted especially Chhandilal Bajpai (PW.4) is a close relative to Smt.Mamta
Pathak and she being nniece of Chhandilal Bajpai (PW.4).
57. After hearing learned counsel for the parties and going through the record, if we summarise the
arguments put forth by learned counsel for the appellant and the appellant Smt.Mamta Pathak in
person, it is evident that arguments can be summarized in the following points, namely:-
namely:
(i) There was not only delay in recording the First Information Report, but the copy
of the FIR was not transmitted to the concerned Magistrate in time.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130564935/ 13
Smt. Mamta Pathak vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 29 July, 2025
(ii) The memorandum was not obtained in ccustody ustody and her signatures on the
inquest report were obtained on 7th May.
(iii) There are several lapses in the postmortem report including recording of finding
of mouth of the dead body being closed and also with regard to the cause of death and
the duration durat of death besides the aspect of non non-conduct conduct of
chemical examination and electron microscopy to find out the deposition of metal
particles into the skin and tissue. The house was wholly insulated and that there was
no possibility of completion of the NEUTRAL CITATION NO.
2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 circuit cuit so to say that the death was caused
due to the electric shock.
(iv) Dr. Neeraj Pathak was suffering from cardio vascular disease and, therefore, his
death is on account of such cardio vascular rather than anything else.
(v) The evidence, both oral and electronic, is not corroborated so to point out that the
guilt is that of the appellant alone and nobody else. It is a case of circumstantial
evidence and chain of circumstances is not complete, therefore, guilt of the appellant
cannot be said to be estab established.
(vi) Once these aspects are taken into consideration, then appellant's reliance on the
material submitted by her is to be tested against each of the points.
58. The first issue, which is raised by the appellant with regard to delay in lodging of the FIR and not
transmitting the copy of the FIR to the Court in time. As far as the delay in lodging of the FIR is
concerned, as per the prosecution story supported with the postmortem report, the death occurred
on 29.4.2021, a fact which is corroborated corroborated by Chhandilal Bajpai (PW.4) that on
29.4.2021, he had received a call from Dr.Neeraj Pathak at 11:51 AM NEUTRAL CITATION NO.
2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 complaining about torture being made by Smt.Mamta Pathak
by closing him in the bathroom and not providing him food for last 2 to 3 days. It is also alleged that
she had given a push to him after putting him in the bathroom, as a result of which, he had
sustained injuries. Thereafter, Chhandilal Bajpai (PW.4), had called the concerned police personnel
of Civil Lines Chhatarpur through his son Ashish aand nd in turn his friend Arvind Pateriya had
freed Dr. Neeraj Pathak. There is evidence to the effect that at 12:54 hours, he had called Dr.Neeraj
Pathak, who informed him that he was freed from the confinement. Chhandilal Bajpai (PW.4),
states that on 29.4.2021 29.4.2 at 7:05 PM, he had called Dr.Neeraj Pathak but th that was not
answered.
59. It is an admitted fact as deposed by Ratan Singh Yadav (PW.12) that on 30.4.2021, at about 6:00
AM, Smt.Mamta Pathak had called him and asked him to take her to Jhansi where she wanted to
meet a doctor in relation to her dialysis. Ratan Singh Yadav (PW.12) admits that neither any dialysis
was performed nor she could even trace Dr.P.K.Jain, with whom she wanted to carry out dialysis
and in the morning on way to Jhansi had given a bag to her mother at Harpalpur and then they had
returned to Chhatarpur in the night and after parking her car, he had gone back to his house.

Smt. Mamta Pathak vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 29 July, 2025
Choukidar Dhaniram Ahirwar (PW.2) had asked him about the return of Smt.Mamta Pathak and
had NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 informed Dhaniram Ahirwar
irwar (PW.2) that the madam alongwith her son Nitish had returned back. It has also come on
record that Smt.Mamta Pathak had taken her son Nitish Pathak and had visited Jhansi on
30.4.2021.
60. Dhaniram Ahirwar (PW.2) admits that he was working as a Chou Choukidar for last 10 to 12
years in the house of Dr.Neeraj Pathak. The elder son of Dr.Neeraj Pathak had informed him that
his father is no more. This intimation was received by him at about 8:00 AM on 1.5.2021. The Merg
(Exhibit P/8) was recorded on 1.5.2021 at 10:26 AM by Promod Rohit (PW.3) wherein it is
mentioned that the dead body of Dr.Neeraj Pathak was found in his house. Since the word
'Complainant' is written in Hindi/Urdu with gender connotation of it being recorded by a female, it
indicates that it was recorded at the instance of the appellant.
61. In the Merg Intimation (Exhibit P/8) itself, it is mentioned that probable weapon used is
unknown and it is not a case of suicide. In Column 12 of Merg Intimation, it is mentioned that
Complainant Smt.Mamta Smt.Mam Pathak, W/o.
Dr.Neeraj Pathak, aged about 63 years, Mobile No.7974831947, visited the police station and
informed that her husband Dr.Neeraj Pathak S/o Late Shri Chintamani Pathak, was lying in his
room on 29.4.2021 when she had gone to his room to ask for food. It is mentioned that Dr.Neeraj
Pathak was lying on NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 his bed, but did
not reply to the request for food and thereafter the complainant/appellant herself informed that
when she had checked his pulse, it was not available and he had died. She got afraid as Dr.Neeraj
Pathak was suffering from fever for last 7 of 8 days. On 30.4.2021 at 8:00 AM, she had taken her
elder son Nitish Pathak in a private vehicle alongwith the driver Ratan Singh Yadav (PW.12) for
investigation and treatment at Jhansi and returned at 9:30 PM. The appellant states that she had
come to the police station on 1.5.2021 for reporting the matter. She does not know as to how her
husband died.
62. The Merg Intimation (Exhibit P/8) is duly signed by the appellant Smt.Mamta Pathak and her
signatures are from B to B part and thereafter the Merg Investigation commenced. The postmortem
was conducted. The FIR (Exhibit P/18) was lodged by one Jagatpal Singh (PW.14) against an
unknown person narrating the fact, which includes that on 29.4.2021 29.4.2021 when Dr.Neeraj
Pathak was lying in his room on the first floor then at about 09:00 PM, the appellant had gone to his
room to ask for the food but Dr.Neeraj Pathak was lying on his bed and did not reply and when she
had checked his pulse then she found d it to be stopped. She became upset as he was suffering from
fever for last 7 to 8 days and also the appellant and thereafter without giving NEUTRAL CITATION
NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 intimation to anybody, she had gone to Jhansi on
30.4.2021, returned from Jhansi to Chhatarpur at 9:30 PM and then on 1.5.2021, she had given
intimation as contained in Exhibit P/8. On one hand, the appellant contends that the delay of 5 days
in lodging of the report is fatal and on the other hand, she states that intimation with regard to
lodging of the FIR was not sent s to the Court promptly.

Smt. Mamta Pathak vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 29 July, 2025
63. Jagatpal Singh (PW.14), who was working as Incharge Station House Officer at Police Station
Civil Lines, District Chhatarpur on 6.5.2021 states that he had received Merg Case Diary No.26/21
on the basis of which, he had lodged d an FIR pertaining to Crime No.288/21 for the offence under
Section 302 of I.P.C against an unknown accused as contained in Exhibit P/18. During investigation,
he had prepared the Spot Map (Exhibit P/2) as per the identification of Dhaniram Ahirwar (PW.2)
and thereafter the statement of Dhaniram Ahirwar (PW.2) was recorded. On 7.5.2021, Chhandilal
Bajpai (PW.4) had produced 16 16-GB GB Pen Drive of Sandisk Company, which was seized vide
Exhibit P/9 and thereafter the statements of Chhandilal Bajpai and Ratan Singh ngh Yadav were
recorded.
64. On 8.5.2021 at about 11:00 AM, the appellant Smt.Mamta Pathak had given her memorandum
admitting that she had given an electric current to her NEUTRAL CITATION NO.
2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 husband after making him consume Olanzapine Tablets on the
basis of which, the memorandum andum Exhibit P/14, one strip of Olanzapine Tablet was seized.
The strip contained only 6 tablets and 4 were empty. Similarly, Smt.Mamta Pathak had given an
electric wire of red and blue colour, which had a two pin plug on the one end and another end was
naked measuring about 11 meters. So, two issues are explained through this material, one that since
the merg was recorded against an unknown person, its investigation was carried out and the file was
received by Jagatpal Singh (PW.14) on 6.5.2021, when he had recorded the FIR. Hence, it cannot be
said that there was any inordinate delay in lodging of the FIR because the FIR was lodged only after
completion of the merg investigation.
65. As far as the law laid down by the Apex Court in Lalita Kumari versus Government of Uttar
Pradesh & Others (supra) is concerned, it says that, it is mandatory for the police officer to record
FIR, in case a cognizable offence is reported. However, it further says that, wherever, information
received does not disclose a cognizable cognizable offence, a preliminary enquiry may be conducted
to ascertain the cognizable offence is disclosed or not. It further says that the scope of preliminary
enquiry even when permissible in limited classes of cases is not to verify the veracity or otherwis
otherwisee of the information NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674
received but only to ascertain whether the information reveals any cognizable offence. It further says
that a preliminary enquiry should be time bound and in any case it should not exceed seven days.
When these facts are taken into consideration sideration then looking to the ratio of law laid down
by the Apex Court in Paragraph No.120.6 of Lalita Kumari versus Government of Uttar Pradesh &
Others (supra) (supra),, which clearly provides that in cases of matrimonial disputes/family
disputes, a preliminary enquiry is to be conducted depending on the facts and circumstances of the
case and then in Paragraph No.120.7, seven days time is granted to carry out such preliminary
enquiry then it cannot be said that there was any delay in lodging of the FIR.
66. As far ar as sending of copy of the FIR to the Magistrate is concerned, it is evident from the
record of the Trial Court especially one of committal of the case to the Court of Sessions made by the
Chief Judicial Magistrate, Chhatarpur that he had received a copy of the FIR on 6.5.2021 through
Constable No.1070 Shri Vinod Prajapati and the aforesaid endorsement bears seal and signatures of
the JMFC, Chhatarpur. The judgments of the Apex Court in Chotkau versus State of Uttar Pradesh
(supra) and Harilal etc versus State of Madhya Pradesh (Now Chhattisgarh) (supra) on this aspect
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130564935/ 16
Smt. Mamta Pathak vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 29 July, 2025
will have no application.
NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674
67. The appellant places reliance on the judgment of the Apex Court in Lalita Kumari versus
Government of Uttar Pradesh & Others (supra) so also the judgment of the he Apex Court in Harilal
etc versus State of Madhya Pradesh (Now Chhattisgarh) (supra). The ratio of law laid down in Lalita
Kumari versus Government of Uttar Pradesh & Others (supra) is that if a cognizable offence is
reported then the FIR should be immediately immed recorded.
In Harilal etc versus State of Madhya Pradesh (Now Chhattisgarh) (supra), the Apex Court has held
that "the delay in FIR cannot be ignored. When an FIR is delayed in absence of proper explanation,
the Court must be on guard and test the eevidence vidence meticulously to rule out possibility of
embellishments in the prosecution story, inasmuch as the delay gives opportunity for deliberation
and guess work. More so, in a case where probability of no one witnessing the incident is high, such
as in a case c of night occurrence in an open place or a public street." It is thus clear that the ratio of
law is that if an incident takes place in night in an open place, then delay in lodging of the FIR may
leave a scope for manipulation especially the place is an open place or a public street.
68. As far as the delay in lodging of the FIR is concerned, firstly, the Merg Intimation was registered
vide Exhibit P/8 and it contains the signature of the NEUTRAL CITATION NO.
2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 appellant Smt.Mamta Pathak. The object of inquest proceeding
is to ascertain whether a person has died under unnatural circumstances or an unnatural death and
if so, what is the cause of death?
69. Admittedly, the postmortem was conducted on 1.5.2021 and its report is Exhibit P/1 wherein it is
mentioned that the cause of death is shock due to cardio respiratory failure as a result of electric
current at multiple sites. Duration of death is within 36 to 72 hours since postmortem. It is also
mentioned that circumstantial evidence and crime scene evidence should be considered.
70. It has come on record that the Merg Intimation was carried out and Iinquest Merg Investigation
Report was furnished to the Investigating Officer Jagatpal Singh (PW/14) on 6.5.2021 and
thereafter the FIR was lodged. The law in this regard is welll settled that every delay in lodging of
the FIR is not fatal.
71. In Tara Singh & Others versus State of Punjab AIR 1991 SC 63, it is held by the Apex Court that
"the delay in giving the FIR by itself cannot be a ground to doubt the prosecution case. Unless there
are indications of fabrication. The Court cannot reject the prosecution version as given in the FIR
and later substantiated ated by the evidence merely on the ground of delay." NEUTRAL CITATION
NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674
72. In Amar Singh versus Balwinder Singh & Others AIR 2003 SC 1164, it is held by the Apex Court
that "there is no hard and fast rule that any delay in lodging the FIR would automatically render the
prosecution prosecution case doubtful.

Smt. Mamta Pathak vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 29 July, 2025
It necessarily depends upon facts and circumstances of each case whether there has been any such
delay in lodging the FIR, which may cast doubt about the veracity of the prosecution case and for
this host of circumstances like the condition ndition of the first informant, the nature of injuries
sustained, the number of victims, the efforts made to provide medical aid to them, the distance of
the hospital and the police station etc, have to be taken into consideration. There is no mathematical
formula by which an inference may be drawn either merely on account of delay in lodging of the
FIR."
73. In the present case, the FIR (Exhibit P/18) is recorded on the written information received from
the complainant Smt.Mamta Pathak given on 1.5.2021. The Inquest (Exhibit P/8) is duly signed by
Smt.Mamta Pathak and, therefore, there being only corelation of the circumstances and there being
no other fact except what is mentioned in the Merg Report (Exhibit P/8) is mentioned in the FIR
then it cannot be said that there was any manipulation in the FIR so to render it as an inadmissible
starting point for conduct of investigation.

74. In any case, the ratio of law of Harilal etc versus State of Madhya Pradesh (Now Chhattisgarh)
(supra) will not be applicable applicabl because the incident took place within the house of the
appellant and it being neither an open place nor a public street and there was already an admitted
delay on the part of the appellant in informing the police authorities regarding the death, which ass
per her own admission, had taken place on 29.4.2021 itself, when she had seen her husband at 9:00
PM is a circumstance, which is sufficient to hold that lodging of the FIR on 6.5.2021 did not cause
any hindrance or interference in the investigation as ha has been held in Tara Singh versus State of
Punjab (supra) and Amar Singh versus Balwinder Singh & Others (supra) wherein it is observed that
the delay in lodging of the FIR is not a mitigating circumstance to discard the prosecution case
especially when the Merg Intimation under Section 174 of the Cr.P.C. was recorded on 1.5.2021 by
the Complainant-Appellant Appellant herself.
75. As far as the appellant's reliance on the judgment of Chotkau versus State of Uttar Pradesh
(supra) with regard to non-transmission transmission of the FIR to the concerned Court is
concerned, in terms of the endorsement that the FIR was forwarded to the J.M.F.C on 6.5.2021 as is
available in the original file, no violation of Section 157(1) of the Cr.P.C is made out. The ratio of law
in NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 Chotkau versus State tate of Uttar
Pradesh (supra) is discussed by the Apex Court in Paragraph No.60 in the following terms ::-
"60. On the importance of promptitude, both in the registration of the FIR and in the
transmission of the same to the court, reliance is placed by Sh Shri ri Nagamuthu,
learned Senior counsel on the following passage in Meharaj Singh (L/Nk.) Vs. State
of U.P.(1994) 5 SCC 188) :-
"12. FIR in a criminal case and particularly in a murder case is a vital and valuable
piece of evidence for the purpose of appreciating the evidence led at the trial. The
object of insisting upon prompt lodging of the FIR is to obtain the earliest
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130564935/ 18
Smt. Mamta Pathak vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 29 July, 2025
information ion regarding the circumstance in which the crime was committed,
including the names of the actual culprits and the parts played by them, the weapons,
if any, used, as also the names of the eyewitnesses, if any. Delay in lodging the FIR
often results in embellishment, bellishment, which is a creature of an afterthought.
On account of delay, the FIR not only gets bereft of the advantage of spontaneity,
danger also creeps in of the introduction of a coloured version or exaggerated story.
With a view to determine whether tthe he FIR was lodged at the time it is alleged to
have been recorded, the courts generally look for certain external checks. One of the
checks is the receipt of the copy of the FIR, called a NEUTRAL CITATION NO.
2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 special report in a murder case, by the local
Magistrate. If this report port is received by the Magistrate late it can give rise to an
inference that the FIR was not lodged at the time it is alleged to have been recorded,
unless, of course the prosecution can offer a satisfactory explanation for the delay in
dispatching or receipt receipt of the copy of the FIR by the local Magistrate.
Prosecution has led no evidence at all in this behalf. The second external check
equally important is the sending of the copy of the FIR along with the dead body and
its reference in the inquest report. Even though the inquest report, prepared under
Section 174 of the Cr.P.C, is aimed at serving a statutory function, to lend credence to
the prosecution case, the details of the FIR and the gist of statements recorded during
inquest proceedings get reflecte reflected d in the report. The absence of those details
is indicative of the fact that the prosecution story was still in embryo state and had
not been given any shape and that the FIR came to be recorded later on after due
deliberations and consultations and was th then ante timed to give it the colour of a
promptly lodged FIR. In our opinion, on account of the infirmities as noticed above,
the FIR has lost its value and authenticity and it appears to us that the same has been
ante ante-timed timed and had not been NEUTRAL CITATION NO.
2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 recorded till the inquest proceedings were over
at the spot by PW.8."
76. The Apex Court has held that Criminal Procedure Code provides for internal and external
checks; one of them being a receipt of the copy of the FIR by the Magistrate concerned, it serves the
purpos purposee that the FIR be not ante-timed or ante-dated.
dated. The Magistrate must be immediately informed of every serious offence so that he may be in a
position to act under Section 159 of the Cr.P.C, if so required.
77. Thus, it is evident that when the FIR is neith neither er ante-dated ante nor ante-
timed, it is based on Merg Intimation (Exhibit P/8) and there is no allegation of it being ante-timed
timed or ante-dated ante dated or manipulated inasmuch as even the name of the appellant is not
mentioned in the FIR, much noise without any substance ce cannot be made so to frustrate the
investigation and the consequential proceedings. Hence the aforesaid ground deserves to and is
hereby rejected.

78. The second contention of the appellant is that the memorandum was involuntary and hence it
would be hit hit by Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India rendering such a confession
inadmissible, is also not made out, inasmuch as Article 20(3) says that no person accused of any
offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself.
NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674
79. The protection ava available is discussed in Raja Narayanlal Bansilal versus Maneek Phiroz
Mistry & Another AIR 1961 SC 29 that the protection of Clause (3) of Article 20 is confined to
criminal proceedings or proceedings of that nature before a Court of law or other Tribunal bbefore
whom a person may be accused of an offence as defined in Section 3(38) of the General Clauses Act,
that is an act punishable under the Penal Act or any special or local law.
80. In Collector of Customs versus Calcutta Motor and Cycle Company & Others rs AIR 1958
Calcutta 682 and Ram Swarup versus State AIR 1958 Allahabad 119, it is held that all statements
made during the stage of investigation or out of Court shall be excluded from the protection of
Article 20(3) unless a complaint or FIR has already been made at the time when the statement is
obtained from the person by comp compulsion.
81. The appellant Smt.Mamta Pathak strenuously argues that since her Memorandum (Exhibit
P/14) under Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 was recorded at 11:00 AM on 8.5.2021 and
she was arrested at 13:10 hours on 8.5.2021, therefore, it is not admissible under Section 27 of the
Indian Evidence Act. In this regard, it is held by the Patna High Court in State of Bihar versus
Madanlal Agarwalla & Others AIR 1967 Patna 63 that the NEUTRAL CITATION NO.
2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 word 'custody' in this Section does not mean physical custody
by arrest. In Mussammat Aishan Bibi versus The Crown AIR 1934 Lahore 150(2), it is held that as
soon as an accused or suspected person comes into the hands of a police officer, he is, in the absence
of clear evidence to the contrary, no longer at liberty, and is, therefore, in custody within the
meaning of Section 26 & 27 of the Indian Evidence Act.
82. In Paragraph Nos.92 & 93 of State of Assam Vs. Upendra Nath Rajkhowa decided by Gauhati
High Court on 06th August, 1974 reported in 1975 Cr.L.J 354 (Gauhati), the Gauhati High Court
held as under:-
under:
"92. In this connection, the following observations of the Supreme Court in AIR 1960
SC 1124 are apposite:
There is nothing in the Evidence Act,
Act which
precludes proof of information given by a person not in custody which relates to the
facts thereby discovered; it is by virtue of the ban imposed by Section 162 of the
Cr.P.C, that a statement made to a police offi officer cer in the course of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130564935/ 20
Smt. Mamta Pathak vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 29 July, 2025
investigation of an offence under Ch. 14 by a person not in police custody at the time
it was made even if it leads to the discovery of a fact is not provable against him at the
trial for that NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 offence.
But the distinction which it may be remembered does not proceed on the same line as
under the Evidence Act, Act, arising in the matter of admissibility of such statements
made to the police officer in the course of an investigation between betwee persons in
custody and persons not in custody, has little practical significance. When a person
not in custody approaches a police officer investigating an offence and offers to give
information leading to the discovery of a fact, having a bearing on the charge which
may be made against him he may appropriately be deemed to have surrendered
himself to the police. Section 46 of the Code of Criminal Procedure does not
contemplate any formality before a pers person on can be said to be taken in custody;
submission to the custody by word or action by a person is sufficient. A person
directly giving to a police officer by word of mouth information which may be used as
evidence against him, may be deemed to have submitted submitt himself to the
"custody" of the police officer within the meaning of Section 27 of the Indian
Evidence Act; Legal Remembrancer v Lalit Mohan Singh, ILR 49 Cal 167 : (AIR 1922
Cal 342 : 22 Cri. L.J 562), NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674
JBP:34674 Santokhi Beldar v. Emperor, ILR 12 Pat 241 : (AIR 1933 Pat 149) : (34 Cri.
L.J 349) (SB) (SB).
"Counsel for the defence contended that in any event Deoman was not at the time
when he made the statement attrib attributed uted to him, accused of any offence and
on that account also apart from the constitutional plea, the statement was not
provable. This contention is unsound. As we have already observed, the expression
"accused of any offence" is descriptive of the person against against whom evidence
relating to information alleged to be given by him is made provable by Section 27 of
the Evidence Act. It does not predicate a formal accusation against him at the time of
making the statement sought to be proved, as a condition of its applicability.
93. The second requirement of Section 27 of the Evidence Act is that the person
giving the information must be accused of any offence. In the instant case when the
information was obtained from Rajkhowa, he was an accused in the case against him
under Section 309,, Indian Penal Code. That apart, in view of the observation of the
NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 Supreme Court ourt
in AIR 1960 SC 1125, we respectfully agree with the following observation of the
Bombay High Court in State v. Memon Mohamad Hussain Ismai AIR 1959 Bom 534
534;
"We are therefore of opinion that the words word information received from "a
person accused of any offence" in Section 27 cannot be read to mean that he must be
an accused when he gives the information but would include a person if he became
subseque subsequently ntly an accused person, at the time when that statement is
sought to be received in evidence against him.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130564935/ 21
Smt. Mamta Pathak vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 29 July, 2025
That being so, the person giving the information in the instant case is found to be an
accused of an offence as contemplated under Section 27 of the Evidence Act. In
consequence of the aforesaid information received from accused Rajkhowa, the dead
bodies of his wife and three daughters were recovered from the compound of the
District Judge's udge's residence at Dhubri and the relevant evidence on the point has
already been discussed above. The evidence of P.W.46, P.W.49 and P.W.29
NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 goes to show that the
dead bodies were discovered in consequence of the information received from
accused Rajkhowa Rajkhowa,, P.W. Kahali has stated in his deposition that on 09
09-08-1970, 1970, he again interrogated Rajkhowa at 7 P.M. and Rajkhowa stated
that he had burried the dead bodies of his wife and three daughters on the night of
10-02-1970 and 25-02-1970 1970 with the help of accus accused ed Umesh Baishya in
the compound of the residence of the District and Sessions Judge, Dhubri and in
pursuance of this information, the four dead bodies were recovered as stated
hereinabove. The fact of discovery of the dead bodies is relevant to the issues,,
namely, whether the wife and three daughters of accused Rajkhowa were dead and
whether the four dead bodies discovered were the dead bodies of the wife and three
daughters of accused Rajkhowa."
83. Even otherwise, Section 46(1) of the Cr.P.C provides that tha in making an arrest, the police
officer or other person making the same shall actually touch or confine the body of the person to be
arrested, unless there be a submission to the custody by word or action; Provided that where a
woman is to be arrested, unless nless the circumstances indicate to the contrary, her submission to
NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 custody on an oral intimation of
arrest shall be presumed and, unless the circumstances otherwise require or unless the police officer
is a female, the police officer shall not touch the pperson erson of the woman for making her arrest.
84. When all these aspects are taken into consideration then it is evident that in terms of the law laid
down by Patna High Court in State of Bihar versus Madanlal Agarwalla & Others (supra) and the
Lahore High Court Cou in Mussammat Aishan Bibi versus The Crown (supra), so also the Gauhati
High Court in State of Assam versus Upendra Nath Rajkhowa 1975 Cr.L.J 354 (Gauhati), the
meaning of words 'Custody' and 'Arrest' are to be seen in different connotations and in terms of
46(1) of the Cr.P.C, the appellant was already in custody when she gave her memorandum under
Section 27 of the Evidence Act and, therefore, it cannot be said that the memorandum or the
consequential proceedings are defective because the arrest was made at 13:10 hours while the
memorandum was obtained at 11:00 AM. The second issue is answered accordingly that there is no
infirmity in recording of the memorandum and the proceedings followed thereafter.
85. In State of Bombay versus Kathi Kalu Oghad AIR 11961 SC 1808, R.K.Dalmia & Others versus
The Delhi Administration AIR 1962 SC 1821 and Preshadi versus State of Uttar Pradesh AIR 1957 SC
211, it is NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 held by the Apex Court that
if no 'compulsion' was used, a statement leading to a discovery under Section 27 of the Indian
Evidence Act would be admissible.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130564935/ 22
Smt. Mamta Pathak vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 29 July, 2025
86. In the present case, since there is no allegation of any compulsion being used and the appellant
is actually using two contradictory arguments, namely, that her memorandum is not admissible
being hit by Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India and on the other hand, saying that since the
appellant was arrested subsequent to obtaining her memorandum, it being not admissible in the
light of the law laid down in State of Bombay versus Kathi Kalu Oghad (supra),, R.K.Dalmia &
Others versus The Delhi Administration (supra) and Preshadi versus State of Uttar Pradesh (supra),
the memorandum given under Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act, being admissible argument
that her memorandum is hit by Article 20(3) of the Constitution, is not made out and is liable to and
is hereby rejected.
87. The appellant submits that her signatures were forcefully obtained on the Merg Inquest Report
at the night of 7th and in support of the aforesaid contention, she places reliance on the testimony of
Smt.Mamta Pathak (DW.1) to contend that the signatures were obtained on 7.5.2021. Reliance is
also placed on the testimony of Ramdayal Gond (PW.13). Ramdayal Gond NEUTRAL CITATION
NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 (PW.13) is the person, who had recorded the Merg
Intimation No.26/21 (Exhibit P/8) under Section 174 of the Cr.P.C.
88. On a careful perusal of the testimony of Ramdayal Gond (PW.13), it is not made out that he had
obtained the signatures of Smt.Mamta Pathak on 7.5.2021.
.5.2021. Infact, there is no suggestion given to Ramdayal Gond (PW.13) that he had obtained the
signatures of Smt.Mamta Pathak after seven days of recording of the Merg Intimation (Exhibit P/8).
89. As far as appellant's own testimony is concerned, she adm admits that the police had obtained
her signatures under pressure, but she also admits that she is literate and is working as Assistant
Professor of Chemistry. Merely saying that her signatures were obtained under pressure and
explaining that her signatures were obtained after seven days of recording of the inquest, are two
different things and she has very cleverly tried to cover up by saying that the admission which has
already come on record in the form of signatures on inquest were obtained under duress aafter fter
seven days. There is no material to support the aforesaid contention and, therefore, it needs to and
is hereby rejected.
90. Infact, a text-book book of Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology by Modi published by Laxis

2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 Postmortem Changes and Time Since Death while dealing with
the aspect of duration mentions as under:
under:-
"Duration: In temperate regions, rigor mortis usually lasts for two to three days. In
northern India, the usual duration of rigor mortis is 24 to 48 hours in winter and 18
to 36 hours in summer. According to the investigations of Mackenzie, in Calcutta, the
average duration is 19 hours and 12 minutes, the shortest period being three hours,
and the longest forty hours. In general, rigor mortis se sets ts in one to two hours
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130564935/ 23
Smt. Mamta Pathak vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 29 July, 2025
after death, is well developed from head to foot in about twelve hours. Whether rigor
is in the developing phase, established phase, or maintained phase is decided by
associated findings like marbling, right lower abdominal discoloration, tion, tense or
taut state of the abdomen, disappearance of rigor on face and eye muscles. If on
examination, the body is stiff, the head cannot be fixed towards the chest, then in all
probability, the death might have occurred six to twelve hours or so more e before the
time of examination."
It is further noted that "in adolescent and healthy adult bodies, the occurrence rigor mortis is slow,
but NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 well marked, while it is feeble
and rapid in the bodies of children and old people". It is also mentioned that, "The onset is slower,
and the duration longer in those cases where the muscles have been healthy and at rest before death
than in those cases where the muscles have been feeble and exhausted due to prolonged activity and
have less amount of glycogen in the muscles. After insulin injections, it develops quickly as the
muscle glycogen is depleted". It also depends on several factors "like heat stiffening; cold stiffening;
and cadaveric spasm or instantaneous rigor". As far as Heat Stiffening is concerned, "it occurs when
the dead body is exposed to intense heat, above 500C. It is mentioned that heat Stiffening is due to
the coagulation of muscle proteins. It persists until putrefaction sets in". It is also mentioned that,
"Heat Stiffening is commonly observed in the body of a person who has met his death from burning
or from sudden immersion in a boiling fluid, or in a body which has been burnt soon after death or
due to high voltage electric shocks from touching a high tension cable".
NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 As far as Putrefaction or
Decomposition and Autolysis are concerned, it is mentioned that "India being a vast country, the
climatic conditions vary so much in different parts that it is impossible to give the exact time when
the putrefactive processes develop in a dead body. The blood acts as a good medium for their growth
and spread. The tow characteristic features of putrefaction are the colour changes and the
development of foul-
foul smelling gases." For this also different durations have been provided by Modi and when these
durations ons are taken into consideration, then it cannot be said that the duration of death is
wrongly mentioned.
91. The third issue, which has been raised by the appellant, is that there are several lapses in the
postmortem report including recording of finding of mouth of dead body being closed and also with
regard to cause of death, duration of death, besides aspect of non non-conduct conduct of chemical
examination and electron microscopy to find out the deposition of metals onto the skin and tissue
and also her submissio submissionn that the house was wholly insulated and there was no

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130564935/ 24
Smt. Mamta Pathak vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 29 July, 2025
92. As far as the identification is concerned, in the application for postmortem dated 1.5.2021, it is
mentioned that Smt.Mamta Smt.Mamta Pathak W/o.
Dr.Neeraj Pathak had received the dead body after postmortem as admitted by the appellant
Smt.Mamta Pathak (DW.1) in Paragraph No.4 of her examination. The crime detail form (Exhibit
P/2) contains the signatures of Dhaniram Ahirwar (PW.2) and on the identification of Dhaniram
Ahirwar (PW.2), the dead body of Dr.Neeraj Pathak was recovered and at place 'A', it is mentioned
that the body of Dr.Neeraj Pathak was lying. Dhaniram Ahirwar (PW.2), admits his signatures on

art. He states that he was residing as a Choukidar outside the house of Dr.Neeraj Pathak by erecting
a hutment and was looking after the house of Dr.Neeraj Pathak. No suggestion has been given to
Dhaniram Ahirwar (PW.2) in cross-examination cross that the dead body, which was recovered vide
Exhibit P/2 from the house of the appellant and the deceased was not that of Dr.Neeraj Pathak.
93. On the contrary, when the appellant examined herself as Defence Witness No.1 before the Trial
Court, she admits that on 1.5.2 1.5.2021, she had NEUTRAL CITATION NO.
2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 called Dr.K.K.Chaturvedi, when Dr.Neeraj Pathak was not
responding but Dr.K.K.Chaturvedi had refused to visit them as corona virus was widely spread then
upon his suggestion, she had asked her elder son Nitish Pathak to call the Police and the Police had
come at 8:30 AM. In Paragraph No.3 of her examination-in-chief, chief, she admits that the police
personnel had gone upstairs for investigation and she was sitting on a Sofa on the ground floor. The
police personnel had asked her to come upstairs but she said that she is not keeping good health,
therefore, she had not gone to the first floor and thereafter, the police personnel had taken the dead
body of Dr.Neeraj Pathak to the District Hospital at Chhatarpur for postmortem. She states that
neither she sh herself nor her elder son had gone to the hospital for postmortem but once
postmortem was conducted, the police had called her to the hospital where she had gone along with
her son Nitish Pathak and she had taken custody of dead body of Dr.Neeraj Pathak.
94. Thus, it is evident that there is an admission of first fact that the appellant had gone upstairs on
1.5.2021 and had seen the body of Dr.Neeraj Pathak. Secondly, she had called Dr.K.K.Chaturvedi,
who had refused to come to see Dr.Neeraj Pathak. Third Thirdly, ly, on advice of Dr.K.K.Chaturvedi,
she asked her son Nitish Pathak to call the police. Fourthly, the police had come NEUTRAL
CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 but she had not gone to the first floor alongwith
the police personnel. Fifthly, Exhibit P/2 reveals that Dhaniram Ahirwar (PW.2), who was wa
Choukidar had gone with the police to the first floor as Crime Form was filled in his presence and
his signatures are available, therefore, she had knowledge that the dead body of Dr.Neeraj Pathak
was taken for postmortem. Sixthly, after the postmortem, she and her son admittedly received the
dead body. Hence, when all these facts are taken into consideration then the appellant's contention
that the dead body of Dr.Neeraj Pathak was not identified properly, is not made out.
95. The contention that the mo mouth uth of dead body being closed as mentioned in the
postmortem report (Exhibit P/1) is concerned, though it is vehemently submitted that it is
impossible to have the mouth of a dead body closed in terms of the Textbook of Medical

postmortem team, which conducted the postmortem alongwith the panel of two doctors, namely,
Dr.Arvind Singh and Dr. Surendra Sharma, was not subjected to cross-
cross examination on this aspect as to why the mouth was shown as closed contrary to the
submission made by the appellant that Pramod Rohit (PW.3) deposes in his examination-in-chief
chief that the mouth was half open and in Exhibit P/6, it is NEUTRAL CITATION NO.
2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 mentioned that the teeth are visible. However, that being an
issue, which should have been categorically put forth to the concerned doctor of postmortem and
having been not made loses its importance.
96. The appellant submits that a panel of three doctors was required to conduct postmortem but it
was not conduct conducted ed by a panel of three doctors as they were not examined in the Trial
Court and, therefore, there is violation of the norms, is also not made out inasmuch as Dr. Mukul
Sahu (PW.1) himself admits that he was member of panel of three doctors, who had conducted the
postmortem and secondly, no such issue was raised as being sought to be raised by the appellant
now before the concerned Dr.Mukul Sahu (PW.1). Infact, if the appellant is serious about this aspect
of contradiction then she should have specifically ically asked Dr.Mukul Sahu (PW.1) with regard to
such omissions. Infact, there is no contradiction to the effect that Dr. Mukul Sahu (PW.1) had not
conducted the postmortem as a part of three members' team.
97. Yet another issue raised is with regard to dduration uration of death as shown in the postmortem
report. It is mentioned that as per the Textbook of Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology by Modi,
contradicts the postmortem report inasmuch as Dr.Mukul Sahu (PW.1) states that the rigor mortis
passed off and thereafter reafter on the aforesaid basis decided the duration of death to be 36 to 72

98. Reliance is placed on the testimony of Dr.D.S.Badkur (DW.2), who states that he was working as
Director, Medico Legal Institute at Bhopal. He states that generally in the summer or excessive
temperature, the dead body starts decomposing between 12 to 18 hours. He states that between 18 to
36 hours, the dead body starts decomposing and its colour also starts changing. He states that if the
duration of death is more than 36 hours then the body changes are such that it is difficult to
correctly say about the injuries and the electric burn marks ks etc but he qualifies that unless the
burn marks are deep.
99. Dr.D.S.Badkur (DW.2) was examined without mentioning his name in the list of defence
witnesses and, therefore, his cross cross-examination examination was postponed for a day as is
evident from the note sheet dated 18.5.2022. In cross-examination, examination, he admits that if a
dead body is kept in a cold place then the rigor mortis will not pass off hurriedly. He further admits
that if the dead body is examined after passing off the rigor mortis then the injuries can be seen. He
admits that the rigor mortis ends with the process of decomposition. He admits that all the parts of
the body do not start decomposing simultaneously but the parts decompose at different points of

Smt. Mamta Pathak vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 29 July, 2025
time. The NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 decomposition starts
firstly from the stomach. He admits that even after 36 hours, though it is difficult to identify electric
current injury but it is not impossible.
100. When the aforesaid aspect is taken into consideration alongwith the testimony of Dr.Mukul
Sahu (PW.1) then it is eviden evidentt that Dr.Mukul Sahu (PW.1), who had conducted the
postmortem, there is no suggestion to him with regard to the decomposition of the body, duration of
postmortem and there is no challenge to his finding that the death had occurred between 36 to 72
hours since nce postmortem. Hence, the submission of Smt.Mamta Pathak relying on the Textbook
of Jurisprudence by Modi, is of no assistance.
101. Since there are no suggestions to Dr.Mukul Sahu (PW.1) with regard to change of colour of the
body, formation of foul smel smelling ling gases, availability of cooler in the room where Dr.Neeraj
Pathak died that humidity will help in accelerating the rate of decomposition and this aspect too
being not expounded by Dr.D.S.Badkur (DW.2) has no relevance on the finding of Dr.Mukul Sahu
(PW.1) W.1) and his team that the death had occurred within 36 to 72 hours of the time of
postmortem.
102. Infact, the aforesaid timing of 36 hours is corroborated from Merg Intimation (Exhibit P/8)
where Smt.Mamta Pathak herself admits that she had NEUTRAL CITATION NO.
2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 gone to Dr.Neeraj eraj Pathak's room to ask for food on
29.4.2021 at about 9:00 PM but Dr. Neeraj Pathak did not respond and when she examined his
pulse, it was not functional. When the aforesaid time of 9:00 PM is correlated with postmortem
report (Exhibit P/1), which was conducted on 1.5.2021 at about 3:30 PM then that time corroborates
the time of death of the deceased Dr.Neeraj Pathak and, therefore, the submission that lividity or
red/red blue spot on the body of the deceased indicates that the death had occurred within 6 to 12
hours, is not made out. Again there is no cross cross-examination examination of Dr. Mukul Sahu
(PW.1) on the aforesaid aspect.
103. Infact in Lyon's Medical Jurisprudence for India by S.D.S.Greval, 10th Edition, 1953, Calcutta
Thacker, Spink & Company, it is mentioned that the colour mentioned on Page No.149, the
putrefactive changes occurred in the following order :-
"Colour changes - In about 24 hours, often earlier, a green patch appears on the
abdominal wall in the right iliac region; this enlarges rapidly, wit within a few hours,
the whole abdominal wall and the intercostal spaces are affected. The coloration now
spreads to the face and considerably later to the limbs. At the same time,
decomposition of the blood causes staining of the walls of the NEUTRAL CITATION
NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 vessels and the more superficial of these
now show through the skin as dark brown streaks, thus producing a marbled
appearance on the surface. This marbling is not very evident on the dark
complexioned until, at a later stage of decomposition, the epidermis was peeled off."
o

Smt. Mamta Pathak vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 29 July, 2025
104. Thus, to substantiate what the appellant wants to submit, it is necessary for her to point out
that the epidermis had peeled off and her husband was a fair complexion person. Both these aspects
have not been said by the appellant or any of her witnesses nor any suggestion has been given to any
of the doctors, who conducted the postmortem, therefore, the aforesaid submission that the
postmortem report lacks credibility with regard to duration of the death etc, is not made out.
105. Interestingly, lot of emphasis is placed on the testimony of Dr.D.S. Badkur (DW.2) but
Dr.D.S.Badkur (DW.2) did not exhibit any medico legal document or expert opinion of any author
before the Trial Court. Therefore, in absence of any expert opinion to substantiate wha whatt
Dr.D.S.Badkur (DW.2) had said and then his own admission that it is not impossible to notice
marks of injuries caused due to electric current even after passing off rigor mortis, leaves no iota of
doubt that the appellant is bro bro-beating beating around the bush NEUTRAL CITATION NO.
2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 without ithout putting any of the suggestions to the doctor, who
conducted the postmortem.
106. Similarly, the appellant's submission that no electron microscopy was carried out from the
deposition of metal particles into the skin/tissue too is not made out. Her another submission that
the exit mark appears only when the body was earthed or grounded but her husband was lying on a
wooden bed with mattress and bed sheet with his feet kept on a plastic chair as there was no
earthing substance especially when the doct doctor or of postmortem found an exit wound through
scrotum of the deceased, which means that the circuit was complete and he was subjected to
earthling.
107. Chhandilal Bajpai (PW.4) clearly states that on 29.4.2021, he had received a phone call from
Dr.Neeraj Pathak Pathak of being tortured by Smt.Mamta Pathak and not giving him food besides
locking him in the bathroom after pushing him inside causing injuries to his hip and the appellant
was freed by the police personnel. The aforesaid fact could not be disputed by th the appellant.
Infact Dr.Neeraj Pathak had given a written complaint to the police personnel with regard to he
being subjected to harassment.
108. Thus, when totality of facts are taken into consideration then the appellant's submission that
the electron mic microscopy roscopy was not done for NEUTRAL CITATION NO.
2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 deposition of metal particles, has no relevance in view of two
facts, namely, (1) no suggestion was given to Dr.Mukul Sahu (PW.1) that in absence of scanning of
skin through electron microscopy, it is not possible to say that the burns, urns, which were found on
the body of Dr.Neeraj Pathak, were caused due to electric current and (2) even Dr.D.S.Badkur
(DW.2), Former Director of Medico Legal Institute did not say that without electron microscopy
finding of electric burns cannot be given.
109. The next submission, which is made by the appellant, is that since the circuit was not complete,
there could not have been an exit wound and she also submits that her house was so well insulated
and because of the installation of RCCB, there could no nott have been any leakage of current and
hence, no death could have occurred on account of the electric shock.

certificate of 'Taar Mistri' vide Exhibits D/50 & D/51 by the Electricity Department. He carries out
the work of electric maintenance in the house of the appellant. He admits that he had not carried out
the work of electric fitting in the house of the appellant but carries out the work of electric
maintenan maintenance.

certificate showing that he had carried out the electrical maintenance in the house of the appellant.
He also admits that after the current flows through then only RCCB falls and thereafter it can again
restart.
restar
111. Similar statements have been given by Kamlesh Tiwari (DW.5). However, Kamlesh Tiwari
(DW.5) admits in his cross cross-examination examination that in a house having earthing and
having electrical safety equipments, if a wire is inserted through a plug and current iiss passed then
after the current, RCCB will trip. He admits that he had not visited the house of Dr.Neeraj Pathak
for last 4 to 5 years. There is no evidence that the MCBs & RCCBs were properly installed and
functioned. Investigating Officer of the case Jagatpal Ja Singh (PW.14) in Paragraph No.8 of his
cross cross-examination examination denied the said installation.
112. When the aforesaid evidence is taken into consideration then in the light of the testimony of the
Investigating Officer Jagatpal Singh (PW.14), who admits that at he had seized two pin plug wire
with another end naked vide Exhibit P/15, it is evident that firstly, earthing is possible only through
a three pin plug wire where three internal cords of the electric wire are connected to NEUTRAL
CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 positive, negative and earthin earthing.
g. In two pin point plug, there is no aspect of earthing. Secondly, as admitted by Munnilal (DW.4)
and Kamlesh Tiwari (DW.5), after passing of the current, the RCCB will fall. Munnilal (DW.4)
clearly admits that after current is passed, RCCB will fall and then it can again be started.
113. Thus, the aforesaid part of the evidence clearly reveals that firstly, the theory of functioning of
RCCB and the house being completely insulated, is not made out because in absence of earthing
wire connected to the devi device seized vide Exhibit P/15, earthing will not function. Secondly, the
RCCB can be manipulated and thirdly, there is medico legal evidence of exit wound of electric
current through scrotum, which shows that earthing had taken place and the theory of dead body
being found on the bed with legs on a plastic chair is not sufficient to hold that after earthing had
taken place, the dead body could not have been placed in the position it was lying. Even otherwise,
there is evidence of seizure of strip of Olanzapine Olanzapine Tablet, which is proved through
viscera report Exhibit P/21 where the doctor opined that viscera material contains Olanzapine

114. All the issues with regard to closed mouth, non non-conduct conduct of chemical examination,
absence of electron mi microscopy croscopy to find out deposition of metals NEUTRAL CITATION
NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 onto the skin/tissue, the house being wholly insulated and
there being no possibility of completion of the circuit etc. are not made out to support the case of the
appellant and, therefore, the aforesaid contention contentions made by the appellant deserve to and
are hereby rejected.
115. The next issue is that according to the appellant as Dr.Neeraj Pathak was suffering from cardio
vascular disease, therefore, his death occurred on account of such cardio vascular failure rath rather
er than anything else. Since he was suffering from cardio vascular disease from 2007, therefore, he
died because of cardio vascular disease rather than electric shock.
116. Dr.D.S.Badkur (DW.2) states that he had seen the postmortem report of Dr.Neeraj Pathak.
hak. He admits that the death, which occurs due to suffocation leads blood to be fluid for long time
and, therefore, the changes in body are slow and the clotting is not instantaneous. He admits in
Paragraph No.5 that on current being given, heartbeat or breath can stop and that will depend on
the quantum of voltage. His further admission that even after 36 hours, though it is difficult to
identify the injury marks due to electric current but it is not impossible, leaves no iota of doubt that
the cardio vascular vascular disease was not the cause of death but the cardio vascular failure
resulting from electric shock was the cause of death of Dr.Neeraj Pathak and, therefore, the fourth
NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 issue is also answered in negative
that Dr.Neeraj Pathak did not die of cardio vascular scular disease but because of cardio vascular
failure or suffocation due to shock.
117. Now the last issue, which is required to be dealt with the aspect of this case being that of the
circumstantial evidence and according to the appellant, the chain of circumstances rcumstances is
not complete, therefore, the guilt of appellant cannot be established.
118. As far as last submission put forth by the appellant is that it being a case of circumstantial
evidence and there being no eye eye-witness witness account, therefore, in the light ht of the
judgments of Apex Court in Sujit Biswas versus State of Assam (supra) and Sharad Birdhichand
Sarda versus State of Maharashtra (supra), since the chain of circumstances is not complete,
therefore, her conviction cannot be upheld.
119. Shri Surendra Singh, learned Senior Counsel for the appellant tried to introduce an element of
doubt by saying that since elder son of appellant Nitish Pahak was also available in the house, the
finger of suspicion cannot be pointed out only towards the appellant appellant and, therefore, his
contention is that since the investigating authority has not investigated the role of Nitish Pathak,
NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 (elder son of the appellant),
therefore, benefit of doubt needs to accrue in favour of the appellant.

Smt. Mamta Pathak vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 29 July, 2025
120. In Sujit Biswas vers versus State of Assam (supra),, the Apex Court has held that a distinction is
to be drawn between proof beyond reasonable doubt and suspicion. Need for proof beyond
reasonable doubt requires that a Court is duty bound to ensure that mere conjectures or suspicion
suspicion do not take place of legal proof. Clear, cogent and unimpeachable evidence produced by
prosecution, reiterated is a must, before accused is condemned as convict. In Paragraph No.14, the
Apex Court has referred its judgment in Kali Ram versus State of Himachal machal Pradesh (1973) 2
SCC 808 in the following terms:-
"25. Another golden thread, which runs through the web of the administration of
justice in criminal cases is that if two views are possible on the evidence adduced in
the case, one pointing to the gu guilt of the accused and the other to his innocence,
the view which is favourable to the accused, should be adopted. This principle has a
special relevance in cases wherein the guilt of the accused is sought to be established
by circumstantial evidence. It is also held that suspicion, however, grave cannot take
NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 place a proof and
there is a large difference between something that "may be" proof and something that
"will be proved".
121. The Apex Court in Sharad Birdhichand Sarda versus State of Maharashtra (supra) has held that
the fact so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis with the guilt of the accused.
They should not be explainable on any other hypothesis except that the accused is guilty. The
circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency. There must be a chain of evidence so
complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence
with the accused and must show that in all human probability, the act must have been done by the
accu accused.
122. When the aforesaid aspect is taken into consideration then the appellant's contention that she
has been falsely implicated by the relatives of her husband in the greed of her husband's property,
before we deal with the aspect of chain of circumst circumstances, ances, needs to be discarded in
view of the admission of the appellant herself that she has two sons, who are Class-I Class heirs of
the deceased Dr.Neeraj Pathak. Her younger son Manas Pathak is in USA and her elder son Nitish
Pathak is with her and, therefore therefore,, when Class Class-I legal heirs are available then saying
that out of the greed for property of Dr.Neeraj Pathak, she has been falsely implicated, is not made
out. NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674

and her husband by erecting a hutment as a Chowkidar. He categorically states that Smt.Mamta
Pathak was residing in Peptech Colony. At the time of the iincident, ncident, she was residing
alongwith Dr.Neeraj Pathak in his house at Loknathpuram. Ten months' prior to the date of

He states that Nitish Pathak is elder son whereas Manas Pathak is a younger son of Dr.Neeraj
Pathak and Smt.Mamta Pathak. Younger son Manas Pathak resides abroad and he keeps on visiting
Dr.Neeraj Pathak.
125. Chhandilal Bajpai (PW.4) states that Smt.Mamta Pathak was torturing Dr.Neeraj Pathak and d
had closed him in the bathroom and had not given food to him for the last 2-3 3 days. Dr.Neeraj
Pathak had sustained injuries on his head and thereafter she had broken opened the Almirah and
taken cash, ATM, keys of the vehicle, FD. etc. Chhandilal Bajpai (PW.4) also admits that at his
instance, his son Ashish had contacted his friend Arvind Pateriya, who had in turn contacted T.I.
Civil Lines and the T.I. Civil Lines had helped Dr.Neeraj Pathak to come out of the illegal
confinement. Thereafter, at 12:54 Noon, he NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674
JBP:34674 had enquired from Dr.Neeraj Pathak and Dr.Neeraj Pathak stated that he had come out
of the bathroom. In the evening, he tried to contact him at about 7:05 PM, but he had no talk with
Dr.Neeraj Pathak. His call details were seized through a pen drive ive and Panchnama was prepared
vide Exhibit P/9. The pen drive was marked as Article A2. A lot has been said about the validity of
the certificate given under Section 65 65B Indian Evidence Act but fact of the matter is that the
aforesaid pen drive was played on the Court computer and in the presence of the prosecution as well
as defence witnesses and no doubt was created as to the authenticity of the pen drive or its contents.
126. Chhandilal Bajpai (PW.4) admits that the police personnel after freeing Dr.Neeraj raj Pathak
from his illegal confinement, had put a photograph on the mobile of Arvind Pateriya, who had
transmitted it to Ashish and that was placed in the pen drive Exhibit A/2. The suggestion given to
him that the police had not helped in recovering Dr. Dr.Neeraj Neeraj Pathak is denied by
Chhandilal Bajpai (PW.4). Chhandilal Bajpai (PW.4) admits that he could not visit Dr.Neeraj Pathak
because of 'Corona Lockdown' but he had given intimation to the police. Chhandilal Bajpai (PW.4)
clearly states that how Dr.Neeraj Dr.Neer Pathak was tortured by Smt.Mamta Pathak and there is no
denial to this aspect.
NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674
127. Infact Ratan Singh Yadav (PW.12) corroborates the motive. He clearly states that a bag was
delivered by Smt.Mamta Pathak to her mother at Harpalpur on way to Jhanshi. Section 8 of the
Indian Evidence Act, 1872 deals with the motive, preparation and previouss or subsequent conduct.
Section 8 provides that "a "any ny fact is relevant which shows or constitutes a motive or
preparation for any fact in issue or relevant fact. The conduct of any party, or of any agent to any
party, to any suit or proceeding, in referenc reference to such suit or proceeding, or in reference to
any fact in issue therein or relevant thereto, and the conduct of any person an offence against whom
is the subject of any proceeding, is relevant, if such conduct influences or is influenced by any fact in
issue or relevant fact, and whether it was previous or subsequent thereto".
128. In the present case, certain facts are required to be reiterated, namely, the conduct of
Smt.Mamta Pathak as pointed out by Chhandilal Bajpai (PW.4) that he had received a pho phone ne
call on 29.4.2021 that Dr.Neeraj Pathak was locked inside his bathroom by Smt.Mamta Pathak. His

attempt to contact Civil Lines Police Station and then communication of message that Dr.Neeraj
Pathak was freed from said the illegal confinement supported w with a photograph sent through the
messenger of his mobile phone. The second NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674
JBP:34674 aspect is that four Tablets of Oleanz Oleanz-10 10 were found to be absent from the
concerned wrapper. There is evidence Ratan Singh Yadav (PW.12) that Smt.Mamta Pathak had
taken a detour to Harpalpur to deliver a bag to her mother.
129. In Merg Intimation (Exhibit P/8), Smt.Mamta Pathak admits that on 29.4.2021, she has visited
the room of Dr.Neeraj Pathak to ask him for food but when he did not respond, she had checked his
pulse, which was found to be absent but she did not report this matter to anybody and instead chose
to take her son Nitish Pathak to Jhanshi without there being any work, which is again substantiated
from the evidence of Ratan Singh Yadav (PW.12). Her motive is also proved through the fact that it
is though not authentically stated but it is available on record that she was residing separately at
Peptech Colony and had joined Dr.Neeraj Pathak few months back. Thus, as per Section 106 of the
Indian Evidence Act, 1872, the burden of proving that wh when on 29.4.2021 itself, she had
discovered that Dr.Neeraj Pathak was no more then what was the motive in not disclosing the
aforesaid fact to anybody till 1.5.2021. The appellant's contention that she had visited Dr.Neeraj
Pathak on 30.4.2021 after returning ng from Jhanshi is not made out from record in terms of the
Postmortem Report (Exhibit P/1) inasmuch as had Dr.Neeraj Pathak NEUTRAL CITATION NO.
2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 would have died on 1.5.2021 or in the night of 30.4.2021 then in
the postmortem, which was conducted on 1.5.2021 at 3:30 PM, it would wou not have been
mentioned that the duration of death was between 36 to 72 hours. Thus, on both counts of Section 8
and Section 106 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, it cannot be said that Smt.Mamta Pathak was not
having any motive to eradicate Dr.Neeraj Pathak athak as that would have allowed her full access to
his property and assets.
130. In State of U.P. versus Baburam AIR 2000 (SC) 1735, it is held by the Apex Court that motive is
that which moves a person to do a particular act. There can be no action without without a motive,
which must exist for every voluntary act. Generally speaking the voluntary acts of same persons have
an impelling emotion or motive. Motive in the correct sense is the emotions suppose to have let to
the act. It is often proved by the conduct of a person the ordinary feelings, passions and propensities
under which parties act, are facts known by observation and experience; and they are so uniform in
their operation that a conclusion may be safely drawn that if a party acts in a particular mann
manner, he does so under the influence of a particular motive. The false explanation by accused
persons is also relevant to deal with the aspect of motive. NEUTRAL CITATION NO.
2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674
131. In Varun Chaudhary versus State of Rajasthan AIR 2011 SC 72, it is held by the Apex Court that
the motive for commission of an offence is of particular importance only in cases of purely
circumstantial evidence for, in such cases, the motive itself would be a circumstance which the Court
would have to consider.
132. When the aforesaid aspect is taken in into to consideration then there being a motive
substantiated with past and conduct of the appellant and further proved through attempt to falsify
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130564935/ 33
Smt. Mamta Pathak vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 29 July, 2025
the evidence, leads no iota of doubt that the appellant was possessed of strong motive to eliminate
Dr.Neeraj Path Pathak as she was suspecting infidelity and had subjected Dr.Neeraj Pathak to
cruelty on 29.4.2021 itself as proved by Chhandilal Bajpai (PW.4).
133. Appellant's contention that she was a best mother for her children as sought to be
demonstrated through a Greeting Card sent by her children on her birthday is not a sufficient
circumstance to take away the motive because a person may be a 'doting mother' but may also be a
'suspecting wife' at the same time and unless any evidence is brought on record to show that there
was not only an element of cordiality but relationship between husband and wife was of great faith
and understanding and merely on suggestion of the appellant, the motive cannot be removed from
the acts of the appellant. NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674
134. The photograph showing showing that the appellant is feeding Dr.Neeraj Pathak or showing her
in the company of Dr.Neeraj Pathak and in the company of her children clearly reveals that none of
them are of the recent past. Secondly, immediate past and conduct are required to be examined
examined rather than remote incidence to deduce the motive. When tested in the light of recent
events then the motive is writ large from the evidence of Dhaniram Ahirwar (PW.2), who has though
admitted that 10 months prior, they were living separately but why they ey were living separately is
not explained. Ratan Singh Yadav (PW.12), who had taken her to Jhanshi and also in view of the
testimony of Maya Gupta (PW.5), who categorically states in Paragraph No.2 of her
cross-examination cross that when she was preparing meal mealss for Dr.Neeraj Pathak, at that
time Smt.Mamta Pathak was not residing with him, reflects lack of cordiality between Smt.Mamta
Pathak and Dr.Neeraj Pathak, which further corroborates by the testimony of Chhandilal Bajpai
(PW.4).
135. The another aspect emphasized emphasized beyond a point by Shri Surendra Singh, learned
Senior counsel for the appellant that the role of Nitish Pathak cannot be excluded and, therefore, the
benefit of doubt should be given to the appellant is concerned, firstly Smt.Mamta Pathak categoric
categorically ally denied in the open Court that the statement of Shri Surendra Singh to be true that
even her NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 son could have been a
sinner. Secondly, there is no element of motive attached to Nitish Pathak. Thirdly, Smt.Mamta
Pathak has admitted in the Merg Intimation that she had visited Dr.Neeraj Pathak on 29.4.2021 and
his pulse was absent. Thereafter, her conduct in saying that on return from Jhashi, she had met
Dr.Neeraj Pathak on 30.4.2021 and he was alive but on 1.5.2021, she had found him to be dead,
clearly ind indicates icates towards the role of Smt.Mamta Pathak and not that of Nitish Pathak.
There is no iota of suggestion that Nitish Pathak visited Dr.Neeraj Pathak on the first floor either on
29th April, 2021 or on return from Jhanshi on 30.04.2021 until he was called by his mother
Smt.Mamta Pathak in the morning on 1.5.2021. When the aforesaid aspects are taken into
consideration then in the light of the judgment of Varun Chaudhary versus State of Rajasthan
(supra) wherein it is held that evidence of motive becomes one of the circumstances where there is
no direct evidence.

NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 State of Himachal Pradesh (supra)
and Sharad Birdhichand Sarda versus State of Maharashtra (supra) will be of no assistance to the
appellant.
137. Similarly, the appellant's reliance on the decision of the Apex Court in Sujit Biswas versus State
of Assam (supra) saying that there is distinction between proof beyond reasonable doubt and
suspicion is concerned, in the light of the motive and the judgment judgme of the Apex Court in
Varun Choudhary versus State of Rajasthan (supra), which in compasses the aspect of conduct of
the appellant, the motive being an important ingredient of circumstantial evidence is in itself
sufficient to complete the chain of circumstances.
circumstances.
138. In Nagendra Sah versus State of Bihar (supra), the judgment of conviction was reversed as was
upheld by the High Court also by the Apex Court on the ground that there was nothing to show that
relationship between the appellant and the deceas deceased was restrained in any manner. But in
the present case, testimony of Ratan Singh Yadav (PW.12) itself besides that of Dhaniram Ahirwar
(PW.2) and Maya Gupta (PW.5) is available on record to show that the relationship was restrained
and there was an element of mistrust their relationship. The judgment of the Apex Court in Shingara
Singh versus State of Haryana & Another (supra) is of no relevance to the appellant inasmuch as the
aforesaid verdict deals with omissions in site plan and in NEUTRAL CITATION NO.
2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 Paragraph Nos.27 to 29, iitt is held by the Apex Court that the
site plan can be fettled only when it can be shown that it will prejudice the case of the defence. But in
the present case, not showing the switch board from which the current was allegedly flown in the
body of Dr.Neeraj Dr.Neeraj Neeraj Pathak using a seized electric wire with a two--pin pin socket
appears to be no fettle to the case of prosecution and, therefore, the judgment of the Apex Court in
Shingara Singh versus State of Haryana & Another (supra) has any relevance to the facts and
circumstances of the case.
139. The fact that the recovery of dead body from the house of Dr.Neeraj Pathak where she was
living with the deceased but she did not explain about the incident; recovery of articles; the
testimony of last seen by Dhaniram Ahirwar hirwar (PW.2) and Chhandilal Bajpai (PW.4) in the
present case; coupled with the fact that they were having strained relationship and taking a false
plea of alibi by the appellant, cannot be glossed over on account of minor discrepancies in view of
the dec decision ision of the Apex Court in Sushil Kumar versus State of Punjab (supra), which
clearly makes a mention that minor discrepancies are bound to appear in natural course of conduct
of a normal human being and disposed of the appeal by modifying the judgment of death NEUTRAL
CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 sentence to that of life imprisonment and
similar circumstances appear in the present case.
140. So far as the aspect of the appellant being not in custody while recording her memorandum is
concerned in the light of the judgment of the Calcutta High Court in Collector of Customs versus
Calcutta Motor and Cycle Company & Others (supra) is concerned, which h draws a distinction
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130564935/ 35
Smt. Mamta Pathak vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 29 July, 2025
saying that Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India will be available only to a person, who has been
formally accused or charged. The Calcutta High Court has held that Article 20(3) of the Constitution
of India is a protection against self-incrimination incrimination and not protection against anything
else. So long as they are not compelled to answer a question by answering, which they may
incriminate themselves, or compelled to produce an incriminating document, they cannot complain
that they have ave been asked to appear before the Customs Authorities or to produce documents.
When ratio of the judgment in Collector of Customs versus Calcutta Motor and Cycle Company &
Others (supra) is taken into consideration then it is evident that while giving memorandum, me
there was no compulsion available against the appellant to record her memorandum and, therefore,
the provisions of Article 20(3) of Constitution of India shall not be applicable.
NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674
141. In Ramswaroop versus State AIR 1958 All. 119, Jems J, it is held that since Article 20(3) of the
Constitution of India gives only a privilege to an accused, he can always waive it.
142. The judgment of the Apex Court in Amar Singh versus Balwinder Singh & Others (supra) will
not have any application to the facts and an circumstances of the present case because the FIR was
promptly transmitted to the Magistrate as noted above.
143. In State of Madhya Pradesh versus Sanjay Rai AIR 2004 SC 2174, it is held by the Apex Court
that the opinions of Authors in Textbooks may have persuasive value but cannot always be
considered to be attentively binding. Such opinions cannot be elevated to or placed on higher
pedestal than the opinion of expert examine examinedd in Court. In the present case, Dr.D.S.Badkur
(DW.2) did not produce any medical text and the appellant did not confront Dr.Mukul Sahu (PW.1)
with any medical text and, therefore, the reliance placed by the appellant on various textbooks of
Medical Jurisprudence Jurisp like Essentials of Forensic Medical and Toxicology, 35th Edition by
K.S.Narayan Reddy and O.P.Murty and Forensic Medicine and Toxicology by Krishna Vij will not
help the appellant in absence of the postmortem doctor Dr.Mukul Sahu (PW.1) or the Inv
Investigating estigating Officer of the NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674
JBP:34674 case Jagatpal Singh (PW.14) being confronted with the text in the light of the judgment
of the Apex Court in State of Madhya Pradesh versus Sanjay Rai (supra).
144. Reliance placed by the appellant on the judgment of the Apex Court in Arvind Singh versus
State of Maharashtra AIR 2020 SC 2451 is not of much consequence inasmuch as in that case, the
prosecution had failed to prove the aspect of motive whereas in the pre present sent case, the
prosecution has been able to demonstrate the aspect of motive.
145. The law laid down by the Apex Court in Laxman Prasad Alias Laxman versus State of Madhya
Pradesh (supra) deals with the aspect of one link in chain of circumstances to be missing and not
proved and hence, it is held that the conviction cannot be sustained in the eyes of law. Similarly, in
Chotkau versus State of Uttar Pradesh (supra), it is held by the Apex Court that there is necessity of
nearly establishing that the deceased was last seen in the company of the accused. In the present
case, there is an admission of the appellant that she was lastly in the company of the deceased and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130564935/ 36
Smt. Mamta Pathak vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 29 July, 2025
then burden could not be discharged to prove that there was any intrusion or any other member of
the family walking up to first floor where Dr.Neeraj Pathak was allegedly in isolation on account of
suspected corona patient and, therefore, NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674
JBP:34674 the facts of Chotkau versus State of Uttar Pradesh (supra) being different will not be
applicable to the present case.
146. In Shivaji Chintappa Patil versus State of Maharashtra (supra), it is held by the Apex Court that
false explanation or non non-explanation explanation of the difference can be used as additi
additional onal circumstance when the prosecution has proved the chain of circumstances leading to
no other conclusion than the guilt of accused and similar facts are available in the present case.
147. Reliance placed by the appellant on the judgment of the Apex Cou Court in Gargi versus State of
Haryana (supra) has no application to the facts of the present case because in that case, the Apex
Court has held that the foundational motive for the alleged murder that of strained relations
between them and reasons for those strained relations not established by cogent evidence, therefore,
the circumstances do not form a complete chain but in the present case, both the motive and aspect
of strained relationship is proved. The appellant has though tried to shift the burden but has not
discharged her own burden under Section 106 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 that she was not
residing in Peptech Colony separately from the appellant as is alleged by Dhaniram Ahirwar (PW.2).
The onus was on the appellant to have proved that for what hat reason, she was residing separately
in Peptech colony and for what NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674
reasons, she decided to cohabitate with Dr.Neeraj Pathak about 10 months prior to the date of the
incident.
148. Reliance placed by the appellant on the judgment of the Apex Court in Kalyani Baskar (Mrs.)
versus M.S. Sampornam (Mrs.) (2007) 2 SCC 258 is to the effect that fair and proper opportunities
should be allowed to the defence also to prove innocence of accused. Adducing dducing evidence in
support of the defence is a valuable right an and d denial of that right means denial of fair trial.
However, when thee aforesaid aspect is examined then the appellant was granted an ample
opportunity to lead defence evidence and that evidence has been considered both by the T Trial rial
Court as well as by this Court and, therefore, the judgment of the Apex Court in Kalyani Baskar
(Mrs.) versus M.S. Sampornam (Mrs.) (supra) will have little or no application to the facts of the
present case.
149. Similarly, reliance is placed by the appellant on the judgment of the Apex Court in Ashish
Batham versus State of Madhya Pradesh (2002) 7 SCC 317 wherein it is held that the accused is
presumed to be innocent till charges against him are proved beyond reasonable doubt. Mere
heinous or gruesome nature of the crime is not enough to punish the accused. Mere suspicion,
however, strong it may be, cannot take the place of legal proof. NEUTRAL CITATION NO.
2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 The alibi taken by the accused that on the date of the incident,
incident he was not present at the place of the occurrence and had ins instead tead gone to another
city alongwith with his sister, in absence of any clinching evidence to the contrary, held, the Courts
ourts below were not justified in merely disbelieving the evidence adduced by the accused in support
of his plea.

Smt. Mamta Pathak vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 29 July, 2025
plea
150. However, when the aforesaid aspect is taken into consideration then it is evident that in the
present case, the appellant herself being aut author of Merg Intimation (Exhibit P/8), admitted that
Dr.Neeraj Pathak was found to be no more on 29.4.2021. Thereafter, she had travelled to Jhansi on
30.
30.4.2021 and as per her own version, she had met Dr. Neeraj Pathak on return from Jhansi at
night. She found nd him to be dead on 1.5.2021. The The aspect of alibi is to show that Dr. Neeraj
Pathak died behind her back and she was away to Jhansi, is not available to her and, therefore, on
this touchstone, the judgment of the Apex Court in Ashish Batham versus State of Madhya Pradesh
(supra) will have no application to the facts of the present case.
151. As far as law laid down by the Apex Court in R.K.Dalmia & Others versus The Delhi
Administration (supra) is concerned, it is in support of the contention that under Section 342 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, no question can be put regarding a matter when there is no
evidence about it. NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 However, this has
no application to the fact factss and circumstances of the case inasmuch as all the material material,
which was found during the investigation, investigation has been placed before the accused while
examining her under Section 313 of the Cr.P.C and, therefore, that cannot be said to be the case
applicable to the facts of the present case. Reliance placed by the appellant on the judgment of the
Apex Court in Rajkumar Singh versus State of Rajasthan (2013) 15 SCC has no application to the
facts of the present case case.
152. Reliance placed by the appellant on the judgment of the Apex Court in State of Madhya Pradesh
versus Nishar AIR 2007 SC 2316 is not applicable to the facts and circumstances of the present case
inasmuch as the ratio in that case is that extra judicial confession made much before the FIR was
lodged, should find a mention in the FIR. In the present case, case extra judicial confession given to
the so-called so called driver Ram Ratan Yadav (PW.12 (PW.12) is not a reliable piece of evidence ev
but the conduct of the appellant throughout has been taken into consideration and that has been
viewed to complete the chain of circumstances as per the decision of the Apex Court in Varun
Choudhary versus State of Rajasthan (supra), therefore, even the aforesaid judgment will not have
any application to the facts and circumstances of the present case.
NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674
153. In Nankaunoo versus State of Uttar Pradesh (2016) 3 SCC 317 317, the ratio of law is that there
is difference between 'Intention' and 'knowledge'. Framers of the IPC designedly used the words
"intention" and "knowledge" and it is accepted that the knowledge of the consequences,
consequences which may result in doing an act, is not the same thing as the intention that such
consequences should ensue. Thus, placing reliance on the judgment of the Apex Court in
Nankaunoo versus State of Uttar Pradesh (supra) (supra),, it is though submitted by the appellant
that there was no intention, therefore, the case is li liable to be converted into one under Section 304
of the IPC but fact of the matter is that the manner in which things were planned and executed,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130564935/ 38
Smt. Mamta Pathak vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 29 July, 2025
blurs the difference 'intention' and 'knowledge'. It appears to be a well planned cold blooded murder
where benefit of aforesaid judgment cannot be extended in favour of the appellant.
154. Reliance placed by the appellant on the judgment of the Apex Court in Ramesh Chandra
Agrawal versus Regency Hospital Limited & Others (supra) is to the effect that the evidence of an
expert is of an advisory character and credibility of such witness depends on reasons stated in
support of his conclusions and data and material furnished which form basis of his conclusions.
NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674
155. When the ratio of the Apex Court in Ramesh Chandra Agrawal Ag versus Regency Hospital
Limited & Others (supra) is applied to the facts and circumstances of the present case then it cuts
both ways ways. If the postmortem doctor had given opinion that it is a case of electric shock
resulting in electric electri burn then in absence bsence of any question being put to him with regard
to electron microscopy etc and also challenging his ability to decipher such electric burn on account
of passage of time though Dr.D.S.Badkur (DW.2) admitted that though it is difficult with passage of
ti time me to discern such occurrences but it is not impossible then the appellant too has not
discharged its burden that RCCBs were functional and connected. The installation is one aspect and
the functionality is another aspect. Since Munnilal Kushwaha (DW.4) and Kamlesh Tiwari (DW.5)
could not explain the functionality of RCCBs RCCB etc, therefore, the judgment of the Apex Court in
Ramesh Chandra Agrawal versus Regency Hospital Limited & Others (supra) will not help and aid
the appellant in the present case case.
156. The appellant places reliance on the judgment of the Apex Court in Prem Singh versus State
(NCT of Delhi) (supra) to submit that the defence of insanity or mental incapacity is available for
which principles have been reiterated but in the present case, the appellant herself admitted that
with NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 medication, her son was 95%
functional. She has enclosed photographs of her son Nitish Pathak performing rituals relating to
death of her husband. Thus, the clever attempt on the part of learned Senior Advocate to shift the
burden and create a space for benefit of doubt fo forr the appellant is not made out especially when
no medical condition of Nitish Pathak has been brought to notice of this Court to show that he had a
bout of insanity resulting in such a planned crime.
ime. Secondly, no material is brought on record to show that there was any element of discord or
could there be any motive to eliminate his father especially when evidence is on record that he had
cordial relations with his father and even during the time when he was residing separately with his
mother at Peptech Colony olony, he used to visit his father.
157. Thus, both on the aspect of motive and medical condition, the suggestion given to create a
doubt is not made out and, therefore, the th judgment of the Apex Court ourt in Prem Singh versus
State (NCT of Delhi) (supra) will have no application to the facts and circumstances of the present
case.

Smt. Mamta Pathak vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 29 July, 2025
158. Mulak Raj & Others versus State of Haryana (supra) is a case of circumstantial evidence
wherein it is held by the Apex Court that merely because the deceased died a homicidal death and
her body was found in the NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 kitchen
with postmortem burns, it cannot be inferred that the said the circumstance by itself would connect
all the accused or anyone of them with the crime. In view of unsatisfactory state of evidence led by
the prosecution, the question as to who killed the deceased remained unanswered but as discussed
hereinabove, above, the th judgment of the Apex Court in Mulak Raj & Others versus State of
Haryana (supra) too will not have any application to the facts and circumstances of the case.
159. Another circumstance is with regard to the C.C.T.V footage recovered from the house of the
appellant. The CD was prepared by Amit Shivhare (PW.6) as contained in Article A3 an and d he had
given certificate under Section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act as contained in Exhibit P/10.
Smt.Mamta Pathak herself admits that in the CDR, nobody is seen though the video cameras are
capable of capturing photographs from all surroundings of th the house.
160. This is second circumstance that there was no movement of any outsider to the house of
Dr.Neeraj Pathak though it is submitted by Smt.Mamta Pathak that there was a common gallery
leading to his practice chamber, there was a shop of pharmacist,, there was a laboratory in the clinic
etc and the police did not investigate movement of anybody from those two staircases connecting
NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 the first floor to an open gallery but
it is an admitted fact that when no movement was seen in the CDR then it is eviden evidentt that
Dr.Neeraj Pathak was not subjected to cruelty by any outsider.
161. Firstly, it is an admitted fact that the house in which the incident took place is of Dr.Neeraj
Pathak. Admittedly, the aforesaid house was jointly shared by Smt.Mamta Pathak and he herr son
Nitish Pathak at the time of the incident. Thus, when there was no external movement to the house
and admittedly, the appellant had seen her husband on 29.4.2021 at about 9:00 PM as admitted by
her in the Merg Intimation and had found that his pulse was not functional, her conduct of not
reporting the matter to the police and travelling to Jhansi on the pretext of undergoing dialysis and
not contacting any doctor at Jhansi as is admitted by Driver Ratan Singh Yadav (PW.12), who had
taken her to Jhansi, Jhansi, and thereafter giving a memorandum by Smt.Mamta Patak vide Exhibit
P/14 and thereafter recovery of electric wire at her instance by Jagatpal Singh (PW.14) so also
recovery of the strip of Olanzapine Tables out of which four tables were found to be empty empty,
the presence of Olanzapine in the viscera material (Exhibit P/21) of Dr.Neeraj Pathak and coupled
with the testimony of Dr.Mukul Sahu (PW.1) that NEUTRAL CITATION NO.
2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 Dr.Neeraj Pathak was electrocuted, leaves no iota of doubt that
firstly, there was no trespassing to the house hou of Dr.Neeraj Pathak.
162. Secondly, the minor discrepancies in the investigation are not sufficient to defeat the present
case.
163. Thirdly, the clever move made by learned Senior Advocate Shri Surendra Singh to introduce an
element of doubt that elder son Nitish Pathak, was also sharing the same house and even a finger
can be raised towards Nitish Pathak, therefore, the benefit of doubt should accrue in favour of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130564935/ 40
Smt. Mamta Pathak vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 29 July, 2025
Smt.Mamta Pathak, gets nullified from very statement of Smt.Mamta Pathak that on 29.4.2021,, she
had gone to the room of Dr.Neeraj Pathak and when he did not respond, she had checked his pulse,
his pulse was non-functional non and her submission that she had gone to Jhansi on the next day
but not revealing the fact that her son had gone to the first floor where Dr.Neeraj Pathak was kept in
isolation on the basis of suspected Covid patient, the report of Dr.Mukul Sahu (PW.1) showing that
Covid antigen report of Dr.Neeraj Pathak was negative, leaves no iota of doubt that Dr. Neeraj
Pathak was apparentl apparently not suffering from Covid while infact Dr.Neeraj Pathak was under
a forceful isolation, he was visited by Smt.Mamta Pathak and not her son Nitish Pathak on
29.4.2021, the elder son Nitish Pathak for the first time visited his father NEUTRAL CITATION NO.
2025:MPHC-JBP:34674 JBP:34674 Dr.Neeraj Pathak on the he first floor on 1.5.2021 alongwith the
police personnel as Smt.Mamta Pathak had shown her inability to visit first floor of the house as she
was not keeping good health and decided to be seated on a Sofa lying on the ground floor, her
conduct of going to Jhansi without there being any reason, handing over a bag to her mother as
stated by the Driver Ratan Singh Yadav (PW.12), who had taken her to Jhansi and thereafter
roaming around Jhansi and then coming back to Chhatarpur at 9:30 PM where Driver Ratan Singh
ngh Yadav (PW.12) admitted that he had left Smt.Mamta Pathak and Nitish Pathak showing that
Nitish Pathak was not left alone in the house when Smt.Mamta Pathak was away, completes the
chain of circumstances to arrive at a conclusion that it was Smt.Mamta P Pathak athak alone, who
for the reasons best known to her, was not keeping good terms with her husband as proved by
Chhandilal Bajpai (PW.4), tortured him to death firstly by serving seductive drug and thereafter
passing electric current and since all the circumstances circums in the chain are complete, the guilt
of Smt.Mamta Pathak is proved beyond all reasonable doubt.
164. Accordingly, the impugned judgment dated 29.6.2022 passed by learned III Additional
Sessions Judge, Chhatarpur in Sessions Trial No.84/2021 convicting ng the appellant Smt.Mamta
Pathak, W/o.Late Dr.Neeraj Pathak for NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:34674
JBP:34674 the offence under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 cannot be faulted with.
165. Resultantly, this appeal fails and is dismissed.
166. The temporary suspension granted by a Coordinate Bench of this Court vide order dated
13.3.2024 shall stand cancelled. The appellant Smt.Mamta Pathak shall immediately surrender
before the Trial Court for undergoing the remaining part of the jail sentence.
167. Record of the Trial Court be sen sent back.
168. Let a copy of this judgment be sent to the Trial Court for necessary information.
