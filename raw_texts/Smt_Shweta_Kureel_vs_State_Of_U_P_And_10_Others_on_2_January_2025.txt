Smt. Shweta Kureel vs State Of U.P. And 10 Others on 2 January, 2025
3. It is the case of the petitioner that Complaint Case No. 473 of 2019 (Smt. Shweta Kureel Vs. Sunil
Kumar & others) has been preferred at the behest of the petitioner, after recording statement under
Sections 200 and 202 Cr.P.C., order dated 05.10.2019 has been passed through which only the
husband of the petitioner has been summoned in pursuance to Sections 498A, 323, 504 IPC,
whereas the specific allegations were put-forward against other persons in shape of respondent nos.
3 to 11 but none of them were summoned and being aggrieved with the non-summoning of the rest
of the other persons except respondent no. 2, order dated 05.10.2019 has been put under challenge
before learned revisional court by way of filing criminal revision along with delay condonation
application and the same has been registered as Misc. Case No. 672 of 2023 (Shweta Vs. Sunil).
4. Application under Section 5 of the Limitation Act filed on behalf of the petitioner was allowed at
the cost of Rs. 1,000/- which was to be deposited on or before 13.10.2021 but due to
non-communication of specific dates to the petitioner from her counsel, the cost of Rs. 1,000/-
could not be deposited and the same was dismissed on 21.10.2021. The order dated 21.10.2021 was
sought to be recalled by way of filing recall application but due to non-providing of the certified copy
of the order dated 21.10.2021, the recall application was also dismissed vide order dated
28.04.2022.
5. Another application has been preferred at the behest of the petitioner for seeking setting aside the
order dated 28.04.2022 but due to abstainment from judicial work as resolved by learned counsel of
the concerned District Judgeship, the same could not be attended by any one and the same
application was also dismissed on 19.04.2023.
6. The petitioner again preferred restoration application for seeking restoration of her criminal
revision at original number but the same was also dismissed vide order dated 30.09.2024, which
impugned the present petition.
7. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that at no point of time criminal revision preferred
at the behest of the petitioner has ever been heard and decided on its own merits, rather, the same
was decided on some technical issues on one pretext to another.
8. Learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted that as a matter of last opportunity, one
specific opportunity may be extended for defending her criminal revision wherein the delay was
already condoned at the cost of Rs. 1,000/- but due to non-depositing the same, which was
dismissed vide order dated 21.10.2021. It is further submitted that there was contents available in
the application for seeking condonation of delay for consideration of criminal revision but at the
latest stage, although there was default of the petitioner which is apparent from different
ordersheets but as per the propriety of law demands that once the cause of action available for
seeking redressal of grievance has already been considered within time at the cost of certain
amount, meaning thereby the matter requires proper adjudication by competent court.
9. Over the instruction so received by learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that his client is
ready to deposit the cost as directed way back in the year 2021 so that the criminal revision
preferred at the behest of the petitioner may be decided on its own merits.

Smt. Shweta Kureel vs State Of U.P. And 10 Others on 2 January, 2025
10. Per contra, learned A.G.A. vehemently opposed the prayer as made in the petition and rebutted
the stand taken up by the learned counsel for the petitioner. While supporting the orders which
impugned the present petition, learned AGA submitted that in spite of giving several opportunities,
all were failed to receive by petitioner which culminated into dismissal of all the applications
preferred on behalf of the petitioner in shape of delay condonation application, recall application,
review application as well as restoration application. Learned AGA also submitted that the instant
petition cannot be entertained by this Court since the law is not meant for the persons who are
continuously avoiding the opportunity of putting their grievances for appropriate forum but the law
is strictly available for the redressal of the grievances of the persons who are awaking and complying
the orders and directions of the court concerned. Learned AGA also submitted that once the delay
condonation application filed by the petitioner under Section 5 of the Limitation Act has been
allowed at the cost of Rs. 1,000/-, there was no ground available to the petitioner for not depositing
the same.
11. After hearing the rival submissions extended by learned counsel for the parties, considering the
confined prayer i.e. only for re-consideration of criminal revision preferred at the behest of the
petitioner, process of issuing notices to respondents is hereby dispensed with.
12. As a matter of last opportunity, the petitioner is hereby directed to put her criminal revision
which has already been dismissed at the stage of considering delay condonation application under
Section 5 of the Limitation Act since cost imposed by learned court concerned has been failed to
deposit at the behest of the petitioner within stipulated time as granted by learned concerned court,
the implied meaning of direction for deposition of Rs. 1,000/- as cost that there are some substance
available in the delay condonation application preferred at the behest of the petitioner and as such
criminal revision failed by the petitioner may be treated as within time but with cost of Rs. 5,000/-
which shall be deposited within a month, if the cost be deposited, learned Court of Session Judge,
Kanpur Nagar is hereby directed to entertain criminal revision preferred at the behest of the
petitioner and dispose of the same within six months thereafter by way of giving proper opportunity
to all concerned.
13. In view of the aforementioned facts and circumstances, the order dated 30.09.2024 as well as
order dated 05.10.2019 are hereby set-aside. The matter is remitted back to learned Court of Session
Judge, Kanpur Nagar for compliance of the directions as made above.
14. The instant petition stands allowed accordingly.
