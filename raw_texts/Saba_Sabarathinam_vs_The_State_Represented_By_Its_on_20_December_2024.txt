2. Mr.V.Kathirvelu, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner would submit that the
trial Court failed to consider the fact that the petitioner has charged for commercial quantity offence
in NDPS Act case wherein the presumption stands against the accused and who has to prove his
innocence. Hence, the accused is an obligation to prove his case and this can be done only by
effective cross-examination to prove the fact that the prosecution evidence is unbelievable. In the
case of statutory presumption is against the accused, the trial Court will be liberal in considering the
petition under Section 311 Cr.P.C., otherwise, it would be violation of Article 22 of the Constitution
of India wherein, guarantee is provided for Free and Fair trial.
3. The learned Senior Counsel further submitted that there are several variations in the copies
furnished to the petitioner and what is available in the Court. The 161 Cr.P.C., there are two different
161 statements of Eswaran recorded by the Investigation Officer and there are material variations
between the two statements. In one statement, only two of the accused name found and in another
statement it contains 11 named accused. In this case, both https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
Crl.O.P.(MD)No.15821 of 2024 statements not furnished and only one statement furnished. The
petitioner engaged the new counsel in the trial Court and the new counsel, after getting permission
from the trial Court, perused the Court records. On perusal of the Courts records, the availability of
two statements found. Likewise, there are two reports under Sections 42 and 57 and both reports are
contradictory with each other, there have been material alteration. To bring forth these facts, the
petitioner has to necessarily recall the witnesses. For the mistake committed by the erstwhile
counsel, the petitioner life could not be put in peril and to putforth these vital facts, recall of the
witnesses is very much necessary to arrive at a just decision. Further, the petition was filed as early
as on 28.06.2024 before the trial Court, but it was not numbered immediately. The trial Court took
its own time. In the meanwhile, the trial proceeded and finally the petition was dismissed and since
its affected the petitioner's right for cross-examination, filed the present petition. Earlier, this Court
finding that there have been some serious allegations made against the Presiding officer, called for a
report from the trial Judge by order dated 23.08.2024 and that report also to be considered
4. Mr.A.Thiruvadi Kumar, the leaned Additional Public Prosecutor submitted that C2
Subramaniapuram Police Station filed a charge sheet against 11 accused for the offence under
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.(MD)No.15821 of 2024 Sections 8(c) r/w 20(b)(ii)(C), 25
and 29(1) of NDPS Act. The Petitioner/A4 conspired with the other accused, involved in
concealment and smuggling of Ganja to the tune of 332 Kgs in a Eicher Container Lorry, bearing
Reg.No.TN-38-BC-2506. Further, from the investigation it was found that it was not on one
occasion and several occasions the accused joined together and committed the offence. After
thorough investigation, the role played by each of the accused unearthed, the accused arrested,
thereafter, on the arrest of other accused, the role played by each of the accused come to light and
finally, the charge sheet filed against 11 accused.
5. He further submitted that when the accused absconding and the trial was kept on hold. In the
meanwhile, one of the accused filed the bail application in Crl.O.P.(MD)No.1639 of 2022. A8 filed

Saba @ Sabarathinam vs The State Represented By Its on 20 December, 2024
07.05.2023. Since some of the accused absconded, it took time for producing all the accused at one
time. After serving of the copies, the accused filed discharge petition and it was added up to the
delay. Latter, the case against A1 and A2 was split up in C.C.No.713 of 2023 and subsequently, A1
secured and the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.(MD)No.15821 of 2024 case against him
split up in C.C.No.715 of 2023, clubbed with C.C.No.244 of 2021. A10 remind absconded and finally
secured on 20.10.2024 and the case against him is pending separately in C.C.No.715 of 2023.
6. It is further submitted that In this case, the prosecution completed examination of witnesses on
03.02.2024; accused questioned under Section 313 of Cr.P.C., on 14.02.2024, thereafter, the
accused in alternatively filed Crl.M.P.No.328 of 2024, 329 of 2024, 330 of 2024, 331 of 2024, 328 to
332 of 2024 and 440 of 2024 to recall the witnesses. This petitioner filed to recall of the witness and
the same was allowed on 02.03.2024. In this case, a team of Advocates defending each of the
accused. In fact, a designated Senior Counsel is also appearing for one of the accused.
7. It is further submitted that A1 in this case filed 315 Cr.P.C., petition, examined himself as a
defence witness and he also deposed. A3 in this case earlier filed a petition to summon the prison
authorities to produce the Goondas Act order and also filed an application to summon the Financier
for the the vehicle. Thus, the accused alternatively filed one petition or other and successfully
dragging on the case, not allowing the trial court to complete the process of trial and render
judgment.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.(MD)No.15821 of 2024
8. It is further contended that presently, in this case, prosecution completed its argument.
Thereafter, A1, A5 to A9 and A11 already argued in detail. The petitioner, by adopting dilatory
tactics, yet to advance his argument, on the other hand, belatedly filed the petition to recall on
28.06.2024 without given any valid reason and for what purpose these witnesses to be
cross-examined. The only ground raised by the petitioner is that the present counsel examined the
documents on 11.06.2024 and thereafter, found that recall of P.Ws.1 to 3 and 5 is must.
9. It is further submitted that the trial Court finding that already the petitioner cross-examination
has been done in detail and further there is battery of advocates for each of the accused and all the
witnesses put to cross-fire drill, elaborately in the name of cross- examination and finding that they
could not dent the evidence of prosecution witness to further delay the process of trial, filed petition
under Section 311 Cr.P.C., on the ground that the petitioner engaged the new counsel and the
present counsel needs to further cross-examination. The High Courts as well as the Apex Court in
innumerable cases held that the change of counsel will not be a ground to allow and permit the
recall of witness. Further, in this case, what reason the witnesses to be recalled and what fact left out
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.(MD)No.15821 of 2024 and how this fact would cause
prejudice, nothing mentioned in the petition. Hence, the trial Court rightly dismissed the petition.
In this case, the trial process almost completed, prosecution completed its argument, on the side of
the accused except for the petitioner and one more accused, all other accused completed their
arguments. Hence, this petition is to be dismissed with heavy costs.

10. The Court heard the submissions made by the learned counsels appearing on either side and
perused the materials available on record, including the report of the trial Judge.
11. It is seen that there have been battery of advocates, who representing each of the accused,
including Senior Counsel for one of the accused. The Advocates have put sufficient decades of
experience in the Bar and they are seasoned trial Court lawyers. Hence, the petitioner's contention
that the petitioner engaged new counsel and the present counsel informed that the erstwhile
counsel's cross-examination is not complete and filing the above petition would not be proper. The
case is at the penultimate stage. Except pending for the arguments of the petitioner and yet another
accused, all the other accused completed their arguments. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
Crl.O.P.(MD)No.15821 of 2024
12. Further, from the trial Court Report it is seen that there are two statements in the name of
Eswaran and Sivaprakasam and two statements are identical and both the statements have with the
seal of the Court and Magistrate initial dated 11.11.2020. Likewise, the records pertaining to Section
42 and 57 reports, the documents bear the sign and signature of the Magistrate on 11.11.2020. These
documents are already available in the bundle with the Magistrate seal and sign, giving authenticity
to the statements and records. The facts with regard to addition of the name and the report with the
endorsement of the superior officer have been cross-examined in detail by the accused in this case.
The report also states that the trial is conducted in tandem with each other accused and it is the case
of conspiracy, hence, the cross- examination and the evidence which has been brought on record by
one of the accused counsel will automatically endure to the benefit of the other accused. In such
circumstances, the petitioner's contention that earlier counsel failed to cross-examine certain of the
aspects with the witnesses P.Ws.1 to 3 and 5 may not be proper, since the other accused counsel
cross-examined each facts and no prejudice would be caused to the petitioner.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.(MD)No.15821 of 2024
13. Further, from the report it is seen that the petitioner given all opportunities as per the
established procedures and law. It is also to be seen that in this case, the petitioner filed an
application on 28.06.2024 and thereafter, the case adjourned for reply by the prosecution on
02.07.2024. There have been no representation for the petitioner for 311 petition on 02.07.2024,
15.07.2024, 23.07.2024 and 31.07.2024. Only on 06.08.2024, arguments advanced. While the trial
Court questioned the maintainability of the petition, again the petitioner got adjournment to
22.08.2024 and 27.08.2024. On 27.08.2024, the case was reserved for orders on 30.08.2024 and
finally, the petition has been filed on 05.09.2024. Thus, the petitioner's contention that the trial
Court not even numbered and considered the petition is not proper. Further, it is also seen that
except for A2 to A4 all other accused advanced their arguments and prosecution arguments is also
completed. The order of the trial Court and the reason given by the trial Magistrate is satisfactory,
needs no interference.
14. At this stage, the learned Senior Counsel submitted that he is restricting his prayer only
examination of P.W.3, one of the Investigation Officer in this case and he also gave an undertaking
that on the forthcoming hearing date ie., on 31.12.2024, the cross- https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis

Saba @ Sabarathinam vs The State Represented By Its on 20 December, 2024
Crl.O.P.(MD)No.15821 of 2024 examination would be completed without any further delay and he
also submitted that with the available documents in the case bundle and with the materials are
already available with the petitioner, the cross examination would be conducted, concluded without
any further delay and one more chance for recall and further cross- examination of P.W.3 alone may
be permitted.
15. The learned Additional Government Pleader, fairly submitted that the prosecution not shying
away in producing the witness. His only objection is that in the name of further cross- examination
the trial is being unnecessarily delayed and protracted endlessly. P.W.3, being the Investigation
Officer, would be available on 31.12.2024 and can be examined on that day without any further
adjournment.
16. On the submission of the learned Senior Counsel and the learned Additional Public Prosecutor,
this Court, in the interest of justice, to give one more last and final opportunity to the petitioner,
permits P.W.3 to be recalled for further cross-examination. It is made clear that the
cross-examination would be confined only to the counsel for the Petitioner / A4 alone and on that
day, A4 counsel to cross-examine the witness without any reasons. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
Crl.O.P.(MD)No.15821 of 2024
17. This Court is satisfied with the report submitted by the trial Court in D.No.718/2024 ,dated
24.09.2024, which is a comprehensive and a detailed one. It is also to be seen that this Court already
given direction to the trial Court to complete the trial within a stipulated time. This Court
understand the difficulties of the trial Court, since in Crl.O.P.(MD)No.16395 of 2022, this Court
directed the trial Court to complete the trial expeditiously with such curtailment, the trial Court
given more than sufficient opportunity and time to the accused in this case and thereby ensured fair
and sufficient opportunity in the trial.
18. In the result, this Criminal Original Petition is disposed of with the above direction.
