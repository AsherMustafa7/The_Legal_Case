in question. Thereafter, though several witnesses were examined but trial could not be concluded.
This Court vide order dated 27.02.2025 directed the court below to submit report regarding the
status of the trial as well as the number of witnesses to be examined and the number of witnesses
who have been examined. In pursuance of order dated 27.02.2025, a report dated 07.03.2025 was
submitted by Additional Sessions Judge/ Special Judge (Anti-Corruption Act), Court No.4,
Varanasi. In that report, it is specifically mentioned that prosecution has nominated 21 witnesses
and 9 witnesses have already been examined and notice has been issued to the witness, Kunwar
Bahadur Singh as expert witness but he could not appear for examination before the court for want
of required permission from his department and next date fixed is 11.03.2025. From the perusal of
the above report, it appears though more than 4 years has passed after framing of charges but trial
could not be concluded for the reason that sometimes accused did not cooperate and sometimes
prosecution witnesses did not appear before the court despite issuance of several processes against
them.
6. Though the Apex Court in the case of High Court Bar Association, Allahabad Vs. State of Uttar
Pradesh (Criminal Appeal No. 3589 of 2023) has observed that High Court should not normally
direct the trial court to decide the case in time bound manner which was further reiterated by the
Apex Court in the case of Sangram Sadashiv Suryavanshi Vs. State of Maharashtra, 2024 SCC
Online SC 3526. In the subsequent judgement, the Apex Court observed that constitutional courts
should follow the guidelines of the case of High Court Bar Association, Allahabad (supra) but in
exceptional circumstances, High Courts can direct trial court to decide the trial in time bound
manner.
7. The present case falls in the category of exceptional case as charges were framed in the year 2021
and the trial in question is related to the offence against women u/s 498-A, 304-B I.P.C. and and
Section 3/4 of Dowry Prohibition Act. Therefore, court below is directed to conclude the trial of S.T.
No. 322 of 2021 (State Vs. Rahul and others), arising out of Case Crime No. 474 of 2020, u/s 498-A,
304-B I.P.C. and Section 3/4 of Dowry Prohibition Act, Police Station- Phoolpur, District- Varanasi,
pending in the court of Session Judge, District- Varanasi, and decide the same expeditiously
preferably within a period of one year from the date of receiving the copy of this order.
8. With the aforesaid observations, this application is disposed of.
