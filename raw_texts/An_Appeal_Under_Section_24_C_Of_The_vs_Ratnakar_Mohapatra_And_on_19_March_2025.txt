THE HONBLE JUSTICE BIRAJA PRASANNA SATAPATHY

Date of Hearing:14.11.2024 & Date of Judgment:19.03.2025

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Biraja Prasanna Satapathy, J.
1. Heard learned counsel appearing for the parties.
2. Since the issue in the present batch of appeals is with regard to entitlement of the employees
working in different aided Educational Institutions to receive Grant-in-aid as admissible under GIA
Order, 1994, all the appeals were heard analogously and disposed of by the present common order.
3. While the claim of the employees of different aided Educational Institutions was allowed by the
State // 3 // Education Tribunal (In short "Tribunal") in different GIA applications, in some of the
cases the self-same Tribunal has rejected the claim. As and where such claim has been allowed by
the Tribunal, State is the appellant and as and where such claim has been rejected, the employees
concerned are before this Court in different appeals. 3.1. Since the core issue is with regard to
entitlement of the employees to receive Grant-in-Aid under GIA Order, 1994, on the face of the
judgment rendered by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Anup Kumar Senapati reported in
(2019) 19 SCC 626, this Court considering the respective stand taken in the appeals filed by the State
and appeals filed by the aggrieved employees, frame the issue as to: "whether on the face of the
judgment passed in the case of Anup Kumar Senapati, the employees concerned are entitled to get
the benefit of Grant-in-Aid under GIA Order, 1994."
3.2. In the appeals filed by the State challenging the order passed by the Tribunal in allowing the
claim of the concerned employees to get the benefit of Grant-in-aid under GIA Order, 1994, the
main thrust of argument of // 4 // the learned Addl. Govt. Advocate is the decision rendered by the
Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of State of Odisha and Another Vrs. Anup Kumar Senapati and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/139232817/ 2
An Appeal Under Section-24-C Of The ... vs Ratnakar Mohapatra And on 19 March, 2025
another, reported in 2019 (19) SCC 626.
4. It is the main contention of the learned Addl. Govt. Advocate that in view of the decision rendered
in the case of Anup Kumar Senapati as cited (supra), claim allowed by the Tribunal to extend the
benefit of Grant-in-Aid under GIA Order, 1994 is not tenable in the eye of law. It is contended that
since in all those cases where the Tribunal has allowed the claim, such a claim was raised after
repealing of the GIA Order, 1994, in view of the decision in the case of Anup Kumar Senapati, the
Tribunal should not have allowed the claim.
4.1. It is also contended that though decision in the case of Anup Kumar Senapati was rendered by
the Hon'ble Apex Court on 16th Sept., 2019, but since the decisions of the Hon'ble Apex Court are
applicable retrospectively, the said decision is also applicable in all those appeals where the claim
has been allowed by the Tribunal prior to the decision in the case of Anup Kumar Senapati.
// 5 // 4.2. Placing reliance on the decision in the case of Anup Kumar Senapati, learned Addl. Govt.
Advocate contended that since Grant-in-Aid Order, 1994 was repealed w.e.f. 01.01.2004, all such
claims allowed by the Tribunal is bad in the eye of law. Learned Addl. Govt. Advocate in support of
the aforesaid submission, relied on Para-27, 28, 32, 34 & 35, 37 to 39 and 49 of the Judgment has
held in the case of Anup Kumar Senapati:-
"28. The next question which we take up for consideration is concerning the effect of
the repeal of the Order of 1994, by the Order of 2004. The provisions contained in
Paragraph 4 of the Order of 2004 has repealed the Order of 1994 save for the
purposes in Paragraph 3(1). Paragraph 3(1) provides every private educational
institution being a Non- Government College, Junior College or Higher Secondary
School which has become eligible by 1.6.1994 to be notified as aided educational
institution under the Order of 1994, shall be notified by the Government as required
under Section 3(b) of the Act and shall be entitled to receive grant-in-aid by way of
block grant in the manner provided in Paragraph 3(2). The proviso to Paragraph 3
makes it clear that a college to be eligible as an aided educational institution must not
have more than two ministerial staff and two peons. There is no other saving of the
Order of 1994. However, Paragraph 4(2) of the Order of 2004 provides
notwithstanding the repeal of the Order of 1994, the private educational institutions
which are in receipt of any grant-in-aid from the Government under the Order so
repealed shall continue to receive the grant-in-aid as if the Grant-in-aid Order, 1994
had not been repealed. Thus, it is clear that in case a college is receiving grant-in-aid,
with respect to a post, shall continue to receive it under the Order of 1994, however,
in case it was not receiving the grant-in-aid as saving of the Order of 1994 is only
entitled for block grant under Paragraph 3(1), not eligible for receiving the grant-in-
// 6 // aid under the Order of 1994. The saving of Order of 1994 is for a limited
purpose that the institution shall continue to receive grant-in-aid concerning the
posts which had been sanctioned before the repeal of the order of 1994.

32. It is apparent from the aforesaid discussion that what is unaffected by the repeal
of a statute is a right acquired or accrued and not mere hope or expectation of or
liberty to apply for acquiring a right. There is a distinction in making an application
for acquiring a 19 Karam Singh v. Pratap Chand, AIR 1964 SC 1305, p. 1309 (para 10)

under section 52 of the Incometax Act, 1922 continued even after its repeal. In

after its repeal by the 1961 Act.
[Note: For convenience, the cases/citations in the extracts has been renumbered.] right. If under
some repealed enactment, a right has been given, but on investigation in respect of a right is
necessary whether such right should be or should not be given, no such right is saved. Right to take
advantage of a provision is not saved. After repeal, an advantage available under the repealed Act to
apply and obtain relief is not a right which is saved when the application was necessary and it was
discretionary to grant the relief and investigation was required whether relief should be granted or
not. The repeal would not save the right to obtain such a relief. The right of pre-emption is not an
accrued right. It is a remedial right to take advantage of an enactment. The right of a Government
servant to be considered for promotion under repealed rules is not a vested right unless repeal
provision contains some saving and right has been violated earlier.
Xxxx xxxxxx xxxxx xxxxx
34. In the present case, it is apparent that there is no absolute right conferred under the Order of
1994. The investigation was necessary for whether grant-in-aid to be released or not. It was merely
hope and expectation to obtain the release of grant in aid which does not survive after the repeal of
the provisions of the Order of 1994. Given the clear provisions contained in Paragraph 4 of the
Order of 2004, repealing and saving of Order of 1994, it is apparent that no such right is saved in
case grant-in- aid was not being received at the time of repeal. The provisions of the Order of 1994 of
applying and/or // 8 // pending applications are not saved nor it is provided that by applying under
the repeal of the order of 1994, its benefits can be claimed. Grant was annual based on budgetary
provisions. Application to be filed timely. As several factors prevailing at the relevant time were to
be seen in no case provisions can be invoked after the repeal of the order of 1994. Only the block
grant can be claimed.
35. The High Court in Loknath Behera has rightly opined that due to repeal, the provisions of the
Order of 1994 cannot be invoked to obtain grantinaid. The High Court has rightly referred to the
observations of this Court in State of Uttar Pradesh and others v. Hirendra Pal Singh, and others,
(2011) 5 SCC 305, wherein it was observed:
"22. It is a settled legal proposition that whenever an Act is repealed, it must be
considered as if it had never existed. The object of repeal is to obliterate the Act from
the statutory books, except for certain purposes as provided under Section 6 of the
General Clauses Act, 1897. Repeal is not a matter of mere form but is of substance.
Therefore, on repeal, the earlier provisions stand obliterated/abrogated/wiped out
wholly i.e. pro tanto repeal (vide Dagi Ram Pindi Lall v. Trilok Chand Jain, (1992) 2
SCC 13; Gajraj Singh v. STAT, (1997) 1 SCC 650; Property Owners(cid:129) Assn. v. State of
Maharashtra, (2001) 4 SCC 455 and Mohan Raj v. Dimbeswari Saikia, (2007) 15 SCC
115).
24. Thus, there is a clear distinction between repeal and suspension of the statutory
provisions and the material difference between both is that repeal removes the law
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/139232817/ 5
An Appeal Under Section-24-C Of The ... vs Ratnakar Mohapatra And on 19 March, 2025
entirely; when suspended, it still exists and has operation in other respects except
wherein it has been suspended. Thus, a repeal puts an end to the law. A suspension
holds it in abeyance.
Xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx
37. Considering the various provisions of Section 7C of the Act and the Order of 1994,
it is apparent that institutions which received grant-in-aid and post with respect of
which grant-in-aid was being released, have been saved. The reference of the
institution means and includes the posts. They cannot be read in isolation. It cannot
be said that right to claim grant- in-aid has been fixed, accrued, settled, absolute or //
9 // complete at the time of the repeal of the order of 2004. As per the meaning in
Black(cid:129)s Law Dictionary, vesting has been defined thus:
"vest, vb. (15c) 1. To confer ownership (of property) upon a person.
2. To invest (a person) with the full title to property. 3. To give (a person) an
immediate, fixed right of present or future enjoyment. 4. Hist. To put (a person) into
possession of land by the ceremony of investiture. - vesting, n."
38. Thus, there was no vested, accrued or absolute right to claim grant-in-aid under the Act or the
Order of 1994. Merely fulfilment of the educational criteria and due appointment were not sufficient
to claim grant- in-aid. There are various other relevant aspects fulfilment thereof and investigation
into that was necessary. Merely by fulfilment of the one or two conditions, no right can be said to
have accrued to obtain the grant-in-aid by the institution concerning the post or individual. No right
has been created in favour of colleges/individual to claim the grant-in-aid under the Order of 1994,
after its repeal. No claim for investigation of right could have been resorted to after repeal of Order
of 1994.
39. It was lastly submitted that concerning other persons, the orders have been passed by the
Tribunal, which was affirmed by the High Court and grants-in-aid has been released under the
Order of 1994 as such on the ground of parity this Court should not interfere. No doubt, there had
been a divergence of opinion on the aforesaid issue. Be that as it may. In our opinion, there is no
concept of negative equality under Article 14 of the Constitution. In case the person has a right, he
has to be treated equally, but where right is not available a person cannot claim rights to be treated
equally as the right does not exist, negative equality when the right does not exist, cannot be
claimed.
Xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxx
49. It is apparent on consideration of Paragraph 4 of order of 2004 that only saving of the right is to
receive the block grant and only in case grant in aid had been received on or before the repeal of the
Order of 2004, it shall not be affected and the Order of 1994 shall continue only for that purpose
and no // 10 // other rights are saved. Thus, we approve the decision of the High Court in Lok Nath
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/139232817/ 6
An Appeal Under Section-24-C Of The ... vs Ratnakar Mohapatra And on 19 March, 2025
Behera (supra) on the aforesaid aspect for the aforesaid reasons mentioned by us."
4.3. It is accordingly contended that as and where claim of the employees has been allowed by the
Tribunal directing the State-Appellant to extend the benefit of Grant-in-Aid under GIA Order, 1994
is therefore liable to be interfered with by this Court in view of the decision in the case of Anup
Kumar Senapati and where such claim has been dis-allowed by the Tribunal and the employees
concerned are before this Court in different appeals, the same be upheld by dismissing the appeals.
5. Mr. B. Routray and Mr. J.K. Rath, learned Senior Counsels along with other learned counsels
appearing for the Respondents in those cases where the claim has been allowed and for the
appellants in those cases where the claim has been dis-allowed by the Tribunal, on the other hand
contended that since by the time GIA Order, 1994 was repealed with Introduction of the (Odisha
Non-Govt. Colleges, Junior Colleges and Higher Secondary Schools) under GIA Order, 2004, the
employees and/or institution were otherwise eligible to get the benefit of Grant-in-aid // 11 // under
GIA Order, 1994, the Tribunal in some of the cases while allowed such claim, but in some of the
cases, the tribunal dis-allowed the claim without proper appreciation of the relevant provisions
governing the field. 5.1. It is also contended that basing on the decision in the case of Anup Kumar
Senapati as cited (supra), the Tribunal also rejected some claims, against which the aggrieved
employees and/or institution are before this Court in different appeals.
5.2. It is contended that in the case of Anup Kumar Senapati as cited (supra), the claim to receive
Grant-in- Aid under GIA Order, 1994 was made at a belated stage i.e. after repealing of the GIA
Order, 1994. Accordingly, taking a view that after repealing of the 1994 GIA Order, no claim is
entertainable under the said order, Hon'ble Apex Court decided the issue in the case of Anup Kumar
Senapati. But in Para-26 of the said judgment Hon'ble Apex Court clearly observed as follows:-
"There is no material on record that the institutions have duly applied in the
particular academic year and within the time fixed for making application as per the
1994 Order and there is nothing // 12 // on the record indicating that the requisite
information was furnished."
5.3. Placing reliance on the aforesaid observation of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Para-26 of the
decision in the case of Anup Kumar Senapati, learned Senior Counsels for the appellants and/or
Respondents, contended that most of the institutions though were eligible to receive grant-in- aid
under GIA Order, 1994 and their cases were also recommended, but the claim to get the benefit of
Grant-in- Aid under GIA Order, 1994 was never considered and thereby compelling the employees
and/or institutions to move the Tribunal seeking extension of the Grant-in-Aid under GIA Order,
1994.
5.4. Placing reliance on the information provided by the Directorate of Secondary Education,
Odisha, Bhubaneswar vide letter dated 21.01.2013, copy of which was produced before this Court, it
is contended that Directorate of Secondary Education prior to repealing of the 1994 Grant-in-Aid
Order, had already submitted the proposal to extend the benefit of Grant-in-Aid under GIA Order,
1994 in favour of different recognized unaided Schools of the State. But on the face of such // 13 //
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/139232817/ 7
An Appeal Under Section-24-C Of The ... vs Ratnakar Mohapatra And on 19 March, 2025
recommendation made by the Directorate of Secondary Education, no action was taken by the State
to extend the benefit. Therefore, in view of the observation made by the Hon'ble Apex Court in
Para-26 of the judgment in the case of Anup Kumar Senapati, the decision in the said case cannot be
made applicable to each of the cases in the present batch of appeals, where the employees are
employees of different unaided schools. Directorate, Secondary Education vide letter dated
21.01.2013 furnished the following information under the RTI:-
"Sub:- Transfer of RTI application No.800/2012 under 6(3) of RTI Act, 2005.
Sir, With reference to your RTI application dated 10.12.2012 addressed to PIO &
under Secretary to Govt. Deptt. School and Mass Education receive on being
transferred vide Govt. letter No.32144/SME Dt.20.12.2012 to Directorate Secondary
Education, Odisha, on 27.12.2012. I am to furnish the required information as sought
for in your RTI application.
1) List of eligible High School (xerox copy) to receive GIA submitted to Govt. vide this
Directorate letter No.5014/dt.31.01.2004.
2) The recommended schools have been notified by Govt. vide Govt. their notification
No.3325/SME Dt.20.02.2004 to receive Block grant w.e.f. 1.1.2004 as per GIA Order,
2004.
3) GIA have not been extended to the above school under GIA Rule, 1994."
// 14 // 5.5. It is also contended that without proper appreciation of the recommendation made by
the Directorate vide his letter No.5014 dated 31.01.2004, when the claim of the institutions and/or
employees working in un-aided schools was not considered by extending the benefit of Grant-in-Aid
under GIA Order, 1994 or grant-in-aid was extended relying on subsequent GIA Order, concerned
Institutions and/or employees moved different GIA applications in terms of the provisions
contained under Section 24(b) of the Act, claiming extension of the benefit of Grant-in-Aid under
GIA Order, 1994. While such claim in different GIA applications was allowed by the Tribunal against
which the State is before this Court in different appeals, in some cases placing reliance on the
decision in the case of Anup Kumar Senapati as cited (supra), such claim was rejected, against which
the employees and/or institutions are before this Court in different appeals. 5.6. However, since the
claim in the present batch of appeals were there prior to repealing of the 1994 Grant-in- aid order,
decision in the case of Anup Kumar Senapati cannot be taken as a complete bar and such claim
allowed // 15 // by the Tribunal is required to be upheld by dismissing the appeals so filed by the
State. Similarly, where the Tribunal has negated such claim, appeals filed by the employees and/or
Managing Committee or Governing Body as the case may be, are required to be allowed by directing
the State to extend the benefit of grant-in-aid under GIA Order, 1994.
5.7. In addition to the aforesaid submissions made by the learned counsels appearing for the
Employees and/or Institutions, it is contended that though challenging the order passed by the
Tribunal in allowing such claim, State is before this Court in different appeals, but similar claim
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/139232817/ 8
An Appeal Under Section-24-C Of The ... vs Ratnakar Mohapatra And on 19 March, 2025
allowed by the Tribunal has been complied with by the State with passing of different orders, after
the order was upheld by this Court as well as by the Hon'ble Apex Court. It is also contended that on
the face of the order passed by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Anup Kumar Senapati, Hon'ble
Apex Court upheld the order passed by the Tribunal wherein similar claim was allowed by the
tribunal.
// 16 // 5.8. To be specific, learned Sr. Counsels appearing for the employees and/or institutions,
contended that similar claim allowed by the Tribunal when was upheld by this Court vide judgment
dated 28.10.2016 in FAO No.377 of 2016 and order dated 01.02.2019 passed in Review Petition
No.75 of 2018, State approached the Hon'ble Apex Court by filing SLP (Civil) Diary No.41150 of
2019 (State of Odisha and Another Vrs. Balaram Mohanta and Others). Hon'ble Apex Court vide
order dated 10.05.2024 dismissed the said Special Leave Petition and with an observation that order
passed by the Tribunal be implemented, within a period of 3 (three) months from today. Order
dated 10.05.2024 is reproduced hereunder:-
"Delay condoned.
After hearing learned counsel for the parties, we find that similarly situated persons
have been extended the benefit which can be extended to the respondents in this
case, therefore, we are not inclined to entertain these special lave petitions.
Accordingly, the special leave petitions are dismissed.
On account of dismissal of the special leave petitions, we observe that the order
passed by the Education Tribunal be now implemented within a period of three
months from today."
5.9. It is also contended that similar claim allowed by the Tribunal in GIA Case No.172/2011
(Arnada Prasad // 17 // Tripathy Vrs. State of Odisha and Others) was not only assailed by the State
before this Court but also before the Hon'ble Apex Court in SLP(Civil) Nos.19387-19388 of 2019.

5.11. Similarly with regard to the implementation of the order passed by the Tribunal on 12.08.2013

appeal in Curative Petition (Civil) No.255 of 2021 relying on the // 19 // decision in the case of Anup
Kumar Senapati was also dismissed vide order dated 08.09.2022. After such dismissal of the matter
by the Apex Court, order passed in GIA Case No.218 of 2012 was implemented by the State vide
office Order No.47403 dated 14.11.2022. 5.12. It is contended that all such orders passed by the
Apex Court were passed in Review as well as Curative Petitions on the face of the order passed in the
case of Anup Kumar Senapati. It is also contended that similar claim allowed by the Tribunal was
assailed before this Court in FAO No.427 of 2015. Against dismissal of the FAO, State approached
the Hon'ble Apex Court by filing SLP(Civil) No.27713 of 2018. On the face of the order passed in the
case of Anup Kumar Senapati, Hon'ble Apex Court vide order dated 12.02.2025 dismissed the
appeal. Order dated 12.02.2025 so passed by the Hon'ble Apex Court is re-produced hereunder:-
"1. This petition arises from the judgment and order passed by the High Court of
Orissa at Cuttack dated 17- 05-2018 in FAO No. 427/2015 by which the High Court
dismissed the FAO filed by the State of Orissa and thereby affirmed the order passed
by the State Education Tribunal (for short "the SET"). The High Court while
dismissing the appeal filed by the State has observed in its impugned order as under:-
// 20 // "In the above premises, I do not find any illegality or infirmity in the order of
the learned Tribunal in allowing the claim of the respondent no. 1 holding that she is
entitled to receive the Grant-in-Aid as per Grant-in-Aid Order, 1994 and for that the
earlier approval order dated 17.04.2010 calls for modification.
10. In course of hearing, the respondent no. 1 has cited that recently in view of the
concession of the State in cases before the Apex Court, the institutions notified under
the Grant-in-Aid Order, 2008 have been extended with the benefits admissible under
the GIA Order, 1994.
In this connection he has placed the copy of the order of the Apex Court in Civil Appeal No. 2403 of
2017 and 62 others in batch as well as the order of clarification in I.A. No. 2 of 2017 and a large
number of Govt. orders in carrying out those orders in so far as those similarly situated institutions
and the employees are concerned. This is countered by saying that those cannot be taken as
precedent for being followed in the present case in ruling in favour of the respondent no.1 in so far
as her claims are concerned.
When, the State Govt. has already extended the benefit to several similarly situated institutions and
the employees of said institutions have already been allowed with the benefits in consonance with
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/139232817/ 10
An Appeal Under Section-24-C Of The ... vs Ratnakar Mohapatra And on 19 March, 2025
the GIA Order 1994, it does not stand to reason that in so far as the present respondent no.1 is
concerned, she would be not treated as like them, being not granted with the benefits as have been
extended to them, which is clearly discriminatory, arbitrary and unreasonable.
11. In the result, the appeal being devoid of merit, stands dismissed. No order as to cost."
2. Thus, the High Court took notice of the fact that the Government had already extended the benefit
to several similarly situated institutions and the employees of said institutions had already been
allowed to derive the benefits in consonance with the GIA Order, 1994 and therefore, it would not
stand to reason for the State to say that the respondent herein would not be treated at par with
similarly situated employees.
3. We find no error not to speak of any error of law in the impugned order passed by the High Court.
4. The petition stands disposed of.
5. Pending application(s), if any, stand disposed of."
// 21 // 5.13. It is also contended that placing reliance on the decision in the case of Anup Kumar
Senapati when the State filed a Review Petition seeking review of order dated 02.04.2018 so passed
in SLP(Civil) Diary No.3441 of 2018 (State of Odisha and Others Vs. Managing Committee of
Durgacharan High School, Aswasthapada), the same was also dismissed by the Hon'ble Apex Court
vide order dated 05.05.2020. Stand taken in Para-3-A, B and C of the Review Petition reads as
follows:-
"3. That the present review petition is being filed on the following grounds:-
(A) The petitioner state is envoking the jurisdiction of this Hon(cid:129)ble Court
contemplated under article 137 of the Constitution of India seeking review of the
impugned order because the impugned order has fall in error in view of the
subsequent pronouncement of this Hon(cid:129)ble Court in Civil Appeal No.7295/2019.
This Hon(cid:129)ble Court has now conclusively held that after the repealment of GIA Order
1994 by GIA Order 2004 it is beyond the jurisdiction of Tribunal or Hon(cid:129)ble High
Court to direct grant of benefit of GIA Order to any incumbent.
On the basis of the facts narrated in paragraph 2 of this petition it would be a case of review of the
impugned order as it squarely covered under order 47 Rule 1 of CPC. This is a case whereby on the
basis of subsequent pronouncement of this Hon(cid:129)ble Court the impugned order is liable to be
recalled.
(B) Because the issue as to whether benefit under GIA Order, 1994 could be extended by the
Tribunal/High Court after repealment of GIA Order, 1994 by GIA Order, 2004 is no more res
integra and has been conclusively decided by this Hon(cid:129)ble Court vide its order dated 16.09.2019 in
SLP Civil No.8343 of 2019, whereby it has been held by this Hon(cid:129)ble Court that after repealing of //

An Appeal Under Section-24-C Of The ... vs Ratnakar Mohapatra And on 19 March, 2025
22 // GIA Order 1994 by GIA Order 2004 no benefit can be granted under GIA Order 1994 in
following observation:-
"Given the clear provisions contained in Paragraph-4 of the Order of 2004, repealing
and saving of Order of 1994, it is apparent that no such right is saved in case grant in
aid was not being received at the time of repeal. The provisions of the Order of 1994
of applying and/or pending applications are not saved nor it is provided that by
applying under the repeal of the order of 1994, its benefits can be claimed. Grant was
annual based on budgetary provisions.
Application to be filed timely. As several factors prevailing at the relevant time were
to be seen in no case provisions can be invoked after the repeal of the order of 1994.
Only the block grant can be claimed."
C) Because it is again settled by this Hon(cid:129)ble Court in the matter of State of Orissa vs. Prabhabati
Padhiari in Civil Appeal No.796 of 2008 that the cutoff date i.e. 01.06.1994 fixed in the GIA Order
1994 is sacrosanct and any institution or incumbent qualify to get grant under GIA Order 1994 has
to fulfill the eligibility criteria by that cutoff date and not beyond. In any case, after the repealment
of the GIA Order, 1994, the benefit of the grant cannot be extended."
5.14. It is also contended that similar claim to get the benefit of grant-in-aid under GIA Order, 1994
when was allowed by this Court in FAO No.949 of 2019 vide order dated 12.04.2023 (Sucharita Jena
and Others Vrs. State of Odisha and Others), State challenging the said order, approached the
Hon'ble Apex Court by filing SLP(Civil) Diary No.32258 of 2023. But the said Special Leave Petition
was dismissed vide order dated 19.03.2024. Order dated 19.03.2024 reads as follows:-
// 23 // "Delay condoned.
We find no ground to interfere with the impugned order passed by the High Court.
The Special Leave Petition is, accordingly dismissed.
Pending interlocutory application(s), if any, is/are disposed of."
5.15. It is accordingly contended that since Hon'ble Apex Court on the face of the
order passed in the case of Anup Kumar Senapati, declined to review the order
passed in upholding the order passed by the Tribunal as well as by this Court, the
stand taken by the State in different appeals that in view of the decision in the case of
Anup Kumar Senapati, no claim can be made to get the benefit of Grant-in-Aid under
GIA Order, 1994, cannot be taken as a Bar for such extension of the benefit.
5.16. It is also contended that since similar claim to get the benefit of grant-in-aid
under GIA Order, 1994 after being allowed by the Tribunal so upheld by this Court as
well as by the Hon'ble Apex Court as cited in the above mentioned paragraphs,
benefit of grant-in-aid under GIA Order, 1994 was extended. Employees in the

An Appeal Under Section-24-C Of The ... vs Ratnakar Mohapatra And on 19 March, 2025
present batch of appeal being similarly situated, they cannot be discriminated by the
State in view of the decision of the // 24 // Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of State of
U.P. Vrs.
Arvind Kumar Sribastab as well as in the case of State of Karnataka and Others Vrs. C. Lalitha.
Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Arvind Kumar Sribastab In Para-22 has held as follows:-
"22 . Holding that the respondents had also acquiesced in accepting the retirements,
the appeal of U.P. Jal Nigam was allowed with the following reasons:
"13. In view of the statement of law as summarised above, the respondents are guilty
since the respondents have acquiesced in accepting the retirement and did not
challenge the same in time. If they would have been vigilant enough, they could have
filed writ petitions as others did in the matter. Therefore, whenever it appears that
the claimants lost time or whiled it away and did not rise to the occasion in time for
filing the writ petitions, then in such cases, the court should be very slow in granting
the relief to the incumbent. Secondly, it has also to be taken into consideration the
question of acquiescence or waiver on the part of the incumbent whether other
parties are going to be prejudiced if the relief is granted. In the present case, if the
respondents would have challenged their retirement being violative of the provisions
of the Act, perhaps the Nigam could have taken appropriate steps to raise funds so as
to meet the liability but by not asserting their rights the respondents have allowed
time to pass and after a lapse of couple of years, they have filed writ petitions
claiming the benefit for two years. That will definitely require the Nigam to raise
funds which is going to have serious financial repercussions on the financial
management of the Nigam. Why should the court come to the rescue of such persons
when they themselves are guilty of waiver and acquiescence?"
Similarly, Hon'ble Apex Court in Para-29 of the decision in the case of C. Lalitha has held as
follows:-
// 25 // "29. Justice demands that a person should not be allowed to derive any
undue advantage over other employees. The concept of justice is that one should get
what is due to him or her in law. The concept of justice cannot be stretched so as to
cause heart-burning to more meritorious candidates. Moreover, at the end of the day,
the Respondent has got what could be given to her in law. As of now, she had already
been enjoying a higher scale of pay than what she would have got if she was to join
the post of Assistant Controller.
We, therefore, are of the opinion that interest of justice would be sub-served if she is allowed to
continue in her post and direct the Appellant to consider her seniority in the Administrative Service
in terms of the order of this Court dated 15th March, 1994 that she would be the last in the seniority
list of the appointees in the post of Category I Assistant Commissioner (Karnataka Administrative
Service)."

An Appeal Under Section-24-C Of The ... vs Ratnakar Mohapatra And on 19 March, 2025
5.17. Learned Senior Counsels appearing for the employees and/or institutions in the present batch
of appeals relying on a recent judgment passed by the Hon'ble Apex Court reported in 2025 SCC
OnLine SC 447 in the case of A.P. Electrical Equipment Corporation Vrs. Tahsildar and Others (in
Civil Appeal Nos.4526- 4527 of 2024) contended that judgment delivered in a particular case must
be read as applicable to the particular facts proved or assumed to be proved in that case. Hon'ble
Apex Court in Para-35 has held as follows:-
"35. If two decisions of this Court appear inconsistent with each other, the High
Courts are not to follow one and overlook the other, but should try to reconcile and
respect them both and the only way to do so is to adopt the wise suggestion of Lord
Halsbury given in Quinn v. Leathern, // 26 // [1901] A.C. 495 and reiterated by the
Privy Council in Punjab Cooperative Bank Ltd. v. Commr. of Income Tax, Lahore AIR
1940 PC 230:
"..... every judgment must be read as applicable to the particular facts proved or
assumed to be proved, since the generality of the expressions, which may be found
there, are not intended to be expositions of the whole law, but governed or qualified
by the particular facts of the case in which such expressions are to be found" and
follow that decision whose facts appear more in accord with those of the case at hand.
5.18. It is accordingly contended by the learned counsel appearing for the concerned
employees and/or Institutions that since on the face of the order passed in the case of
Anup Kumar Senapati, similar claim allowed by the Tribunal further confirmed by
this Court has been upheld by the Apex Court with dismissal of the Special Leave
Petition, Review Petition as well as Curative Petition, the stand taken by the State
that in view of the decision in the case of Anup Kumar Senapati, no further claim
under the GIA Order, 1994 is entertainable is not legally tenable.
5.19. It is accordingly contended that in view of the nature of order passed by the
Hon'ble Apex court on the face of the order passed in the case of Anup Kumar
Senapati, extension of the benefit of Grant-in-Aid in // 27 // favour of the concerned
employees/institution in the present batch of appeals under GIA Order, 1994 is
required to be upheld by rejecting the appeals filed by the State. Similarly in such
appeals where the rejection of the claims is under challenge, the same is required to
be allowed. It is also contended that in view of the decision in the case of Arvind
Kumar Sribastab and Shree Lalitha, the employees in the present batch of appeals
cannot be discriminated.
5.20. It is also contended that since such claim of the employees and/or Institutions
were there prior to repealing of the GIA Order, 1994 as admitted by the Directorate of
Secondary Education while furnishing the information under RTI on 21.01.2013 in
respect of employees of Secondary Schools, appeals filed by the State against the
orders of the Tribunal, is required to be rejected and appeals where similar claim has
not been allowed, are required to be allowed by this Court.

An Appeal Under Section-24-C Of The ... vs Ratnakar Mohapatra And on 19 March, 2025
6. Having heard learned counsel for the parties and after going through the materials
available on record, it is found that all the present batch of appeals have been filed
either // 28 // by the State-Appellants where the Tribunal has allowed the claim of
the concerned employees and/or Institutions to get the benefit of Grant-in-Aid under
GIA Order, 1994 and by the employees and/or institutions where such claim has been
rejected by the Tribunal placing reliance on the decision in the case of Anup Kumar
Senapati as cited (supra).
6.1. This Court after going through the decision in the case of Anup Kumar Senapati, though is of the
view that no such claim after repealing of the Grant-in-Aid Order, 1994 is entertainable, but placing
reliance on the RTI information provided by the Directorate of Secondary Education vide his letter
dated 21.01.2013, it is view of this Court that in those cases where the recommendation has been
made in favour of Secondary schools prior to repealing of the GIA Order, decision in the case of
Anup Kumar Senapati cannot be treated as a complete bar absolutely.
6.2. Not only that similar claim allowed by the Tribunal and upheld by this Court, on the face of the
decision in the case of Anup Kumar Senapati, was not interfered with by // 29 // the Hon'ble Apex
Court while dismissing appeals preferred against those orders by the State. It is also found that
Review Petitions and/or Curative Petitions filed seeking review of the earlier order passed by the
Apex Court relying on the decision in the case of Anup Kumar Senapati, was also not entertained by
the Apex Court. It is also found that similar claim allowed by this Court in FAO No.949 of 2019 and
FAO No.602 of 2019 was not interfered with by the Apex Court while dismissing the Special Leave
Petitions vide order dated 11.01.2024 and 19.03.2024.
6.3. Therefore, it is the view of this Court that decision in the case of Anup Kumar Senapati cannot
be taken as a complete Bar in those cases where the employees and/or institutions were otherwise
eligible to get the benefit of grant-in-aid under GIA Order, 1994 and recommendation has been
made by the respective Directorate prior to such repealing of GIA Order, 1994 in respect of unaided
Schools, Girls Schools or Higher Secondary Schools and Colleges.
// 30 // 6.4. In view of the aforesaid analysis, this Court while is not inclined to interfere with the
judgments of the tribunal wherein claim of the employees and/or institutions has been allowed and
dismiss the appeals accordingly, but is inclined to quash the impugned judgments wherein such
claim of the concerned employees and/or institutions has been rejected by the Tribunal by allowing
the appeals. However, such dismissal & allowing of the appeals is with the condition that, claim of
the concerned employees and/or institutions in the present batch of appeals will be subject to
verification to be made by the concerned Directorate dealing with the issue. The State Authorities
are directed to verify as to whether prior to repealing of the Grant-in-Aid Order, 1994, which was
notified in the Gazette on 05.02.2004, claim of the employees and/or institutions in the present
batch of appeals was recommended by the concerned Directorate. This Court also directs the State
authorities to take into consideration the benefit of Grant-in-aid under GIA Order, 1994 extended
after dismissal of the appeal filed by the State in FAO No.949 of 2019 and FAO No.602 of 2019 and
so also the orders passed by the Apex Court in various Review // 31 // Petitions as well as Curative
Petitions on the face of the order passed in the case of Anup Kumar Senapati and extension of the

benefit under GIA Order, 1994. On such verification and appreciation of the orders passed by the
Hon'ble Apex Court, appropriate order be passed to extend the benefit of Grant-in-Aid under GIA
Order, 1994 in favour of the employees and/or institutions in the present batch of appeals. This
Court directs the State authorities to complete the entire exercise, within a period of 6 (six) months
from the date of receipt of this order. The issue framed is accordingly decided.
7. The present batch of appeals are accordingly disposed of with the aforesaid observation and
direction.
