petitioner.
For Petitioner : Ms.N.Kavitha Rameshwar
For Respondents : Mr.P.Baladhandayutham
Special Government Pleader
ORDER
This Writ Petition has been filed to direct the respondents to treat the land acquisition proceedings
as abated and to restore the property in R.S.No.196/3, thereafter re-numbered as 196/3A2 to an
extent of 65 cents in Sundakkamuthur Village, Coimbatore (South), Coimbatore, to the petitioner in
accordance with the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Repeal Act,
1999 (herein after referred to as “the Repeal Act”) and to issue patta in respect of the same to the
petitioner.
2. The case of the petitioner is that his father had purchased 14 acres of land comprised in
R.S.No.196/3, Sundakkamuthur Village, Coimbatore, in the year 1963. After his demise, the legal
heirs were partitioned the property, after sold out some portion of the land. In pursuant to the
partition between the legal heirs, the petitioner was allotted with 1.74 acres of land, in which the
petitioner had sold out 54 cents and settled another 5 cents in favour of his
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis elder brother. The remaining land to an extent of 70 cents is in
possession and enjoyment of the petitioner.
3. While being so, in the year 1989, the proceedings under the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Urban
Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1978 (herein after referred to as “the Act”) were initiated in
respect of the property comprised in R.S.No.196/3, to an extent of 9141 sq.mts., owned by the
petitioner and his mother. In the said 9141 sq.mts., the petitioner's property is only 2630.55 sq.mt.,
(65 cents). The petitioner and other land owners were participated in the enquiry and raised
primarily objection that the subject land in question is agricultural land and it would not attract the
provisions of the Act. However, their objections were not considered and the land was notified for
acquisition under the provisions of the Act.
4. Thereafter, the notification dated 25.01.1991 was issued under Section 11(3) of the Act, thereby
notified that the lands were absolutely vested with the Stated Government with effect from
12.07.1990. After publication of the declaration under Section 11(3) of the Act, no steps were taken
to take physical possession of the land. The petitioner was never served with notice under Section
11(5) of the Act and the physical possession have not been taken https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
even till today and the petitioner is in possession and enjoyment of the property and he is doing
cultivation. Therefore, the petitioner filed the present petition with the above said prayer.
5. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner would submit that the entire proceedings have
been lapsed, since the physical possession have not been taken over from the petitioner in respect of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122399089/ 2
K.Senthamarai Kannan vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 16 December, 2021
the subject property. As per Section 3(2) of the Repeal Act, the entire proceedings have been lapsed.
In support of her contention, she relied upon the following reported judgments :-
(i) 2012 (6) MLJ 522 – M/s.Sree Jayalakshmi Brick Industries Vs. The Special
Commissioner & ors.
(ii) AIR 2013 SC 1793 – State of UP Vs. Hari Ram
(iii) 2014 (12) SCC 523 – Gajanan Kamlya Patil Vs. Addl. Collector and Comp.
Authority & ors.
(iv) W.A(MD).Nos.511 to 521 of 2019 dated 12.06.2019 – The Assistant
Commissioner Vs. G.D.Vaithiyalingam.
6. Per contra, the second respondent filed counter and stated that the petitioner and his mother
were the owners of the land comprised in S.F.No.196/3 ad measuring 12141 sq.mts., situated at
Sundakamuthur Village. Since the urban land owners had failed to file return under Section 7(1) of
the Act, notice under Section 7(2) of the Act was issued by the second respondent
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis and the same was served on them on 21.10.1989. On receipt of the
same, the urban land owners failed to file return and did not raise any objections. Therefore, the
notice under Section 9(4) of the Act, with statement under Section 9(1) of the Act was issued to the
urban land owners on 29.11.1989, for the proposed acquisition of 9150 sq.mts. Thereafter, the notice
under Section 9(5) of the Act and the final statement under Section 10(1) of the Act were issued on
31.01.1990. On receipt of the same, the petitioner filed an appeal under Section 33 of the Act, and
the same was rejected by the Appellate Authority by an order dated 11.12.1990.
7. Further, the notification under Section 11(1) of the Act was issued on 09.05.1990 and the same
was published in the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette on 13.06.1990. Thereafter, the notification
under Section 11(3) of the Act, was issued on 25.01.1991 and the same was published in Tamil Nadu
Government Gazette on 13.03.1991, thereby vesting the land with the Government. The notice under
Section 11(5) of the Act was issued on 29.10.1998 to the urban land owners requesting to surrender
the vacant possession of the subject property within a period of 30 days. Since the urban land
owners failed to surrender their possession, the second respondent initiated action under Section
11(6) of the Act and the possession has been https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis taken over and the
same was handed over to the Revenue Authorities on 19.03.1999. Thereafter, necessary changes
were carried out in the revenue records as “Government urban land ceiling lands” on 04.03.1999.
Therefore, after the period of 19 years from the date of take over the land, now the petitioner filed
this Writ Petition.
8. The learned Special Government Pleader appearing for the respondents submitted that after
completion of the acquisition proceedings under the Act, the possession of the excess vacant lands
were taken over and handed over to the Revenue Authorities, well before the commencement of the
Repeal Act. Therefore, the acquisition proceeding has been saved under Section 3(1)(a) of the Repeal
Act. The petitioner raised disputable question of fact, whether the physical possession of the land
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122399089/ 3
K.Senthamarai Kannan vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 16 December, 2021
was taken or not. Such a question of fact could not have been gone into and adjudicated before this
Court. To support of his contention, he also relied upon the judgment reported in 2015 (5) SCC 321
in the case of State of Assam Vs. Bhasker Jyothi Sarama & ors., in which the Hon'ble Supreme Court
of India held as follows :-
15...... the question whether actual physical possession was taken over remains a
seriously disputed question of fact which is not amenable to a satisfactory
determination by the High Court in proceedings under
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Article 226 of the Constitution no matter the High
Court may in its discretion in certain situations upon such determination. Remand to
the High Court to have a finding on the question of dispossession, therefore, does not
appear to us to be a viable solution.” Therefore, he prayed for dismissal of the present
Writ Petition.
9. Heard Ms.N.Kavitha Rameshwar, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner and
Mr.P.Baladhandayutham, learned Special Government Pleader appearing for the respondents.
10. The only point for consideration in this Writ Petition is that whether the physical possession of
the subject land has been taken from the petitioner, so as to suspend the urban land ceiling
proceeding as against the petitioner.
11. On perusal of the original records produced by the second respondent revealed that the urban
land owners were issued notice under Section 11(5) of the Act on 29.10.1998. The said notice was
received by the petitioner's mother in respect of her share alone. There is no record to show that the
petitioner was served with notice under Section 11(5) of the Act. That apart, the physical possession
of the subject land is still with the petitioner and https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis the same had not
taken over even till today. Even according to the second respondent after issuance of notice under
Section 11(5) of the Act, the urban land owners failed to surrender the possession of the land.
Therefore, they initiated proceedings under Section 11(6) of the Act and taken physical possession of
the property and handed over to the Revenue authorities on 19.03.1999. There is absolutely no
record to show that the respondents had initiated action under Section 11(6) of the Act and took
physical possession of the subject land. It shows that they had done desk work and no physical
possession of the subject land was taken over.
12. It is also to be noted that there are two types of possession of the property viz., symbolic and
physical. While the former is a paper possession, the latter is actual one. It is not in dispute that
urban land ceiling proceedings were initiated against the subject land. However, the main
contention of the petitioner is that he is continuously in possession and enjoyment of the subject
land and he has not dispossessed at any point of time from the property. If the petitioner has not
dispossessed physically and continuously enjoying the subject property, the Repeal Act comes to
rescue him to declare that the entire urban land ceiling proceedings as abated. If actual possession
was not taken, the petition is entitled to get benefit under the Repeal Act.

K.Senthamarai Kannan vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 16 December, 2021
13. In this regard, it is relevant to rely upon the judgment reported in 2015 (1) CWC 388 in the case
of The Government of Tamil Nadu Vs. Aalim Muhammed Salegh Trust, as follows:-
“10. In our considered view, all the above issues need not be gone into at this stage, as
the only relevant issue for consideration is as to whether the land owner was
dispossessed by the appellants in pursuant to the impugned proceedings or not. For
such purpose, we have perused the files. The files disclose that a notice under Section
11(5) of the Act was issued on the said Baskara Pillai on 28.12.1992, calling upon him
to surrender or deliver possession of the subject matter lands. Further, the competent
authority addressed the District Collector of the then Chengalpet-MGR District at
Kancheepuram, through proceedings dated 28.12.1992, requesting that the Tahsildar,
Saidapet may be instructed to take possession of the lands from the urban land
owner. Similar proceedings were also addressed to the Tahsildar of Saidapet on the
very same day. Thereafter, there is nothing in the files to show that the land owner
has either voluntarily surrendered the possession or the authorities have taken steps
to take physical possession of the lands forcibly as per the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis procedures contemplated under the Act. On the
other hand, only a Land Delivery Receipt, dated 24.2.1994 is available in the files,
which shows that the subject matter lands have been handed over by the Revenue
Inspector, Poonamallee and taken over by Firka Revenue Inspector, Mori Firka. The
said Land Delivery Receipt does not show anywhere that the said Baskara Pillai
delivered the possession of the lands on his own or he was dispossessed forcibly,
except showing him as the owner. Therefore, it is evident from the perusal of the files
that only a symbolic or paper possession was taken by the Revenue officials of the
appellants and factual and physical possession was never taken from the hands of the
original owner or from the writ petitioner at any point of time.
11. Whether symbolic or paper possession is a valid possession to sustain the
proceedings initiated under the Act, has already come up for consideration before
this Bench in Writ Appeal No.949 of 2013 and by judgment dated 3.9.2014, we have
observed in paragraphs 8 to 10 as follows:
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis "8. The issue as to whether taking over of the land
by symbolic possession can be construed as possession taken and based on such act,
whether the authorities can claim right over the land after the Repeal Act, has already
been considered and decided by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of State of
U.P. vs., Hari Ram reported in 2013-3-MLJ-408(SC) at para 38 and 39, which reads
as follows:-
"38. Let us now examine the effect of Section 3 of the Repeal Act 15 of 1999 on sub-
section (3) to Section 10 of the Act. The Repeal Act 1999 has expressly repealed the Act 33 of 1976.
The Object and Reasons of the Repeal Act has already been referred to in the earlier part of this
Judgment. Repeal Act has, however, retained a saving clause. The question whether a right has been
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122399089/ 5
K.Senthamarai Kannan vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 16 December, 2021
acquired or liability incurred under a statute before it is repealed will in each case depend on the
construction of the statute and the facts of the particular case.
39. The mere vesting of the land under sub-
section (3) of Section 10 would not confer any right on the State Government to have de facto
possession of the vacant land unless there has been a voluntary surrender of vacant land before
18.3.1999. State has to establish that there has https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis been a voluntary
surrender of vacant land or surrender and delivery of peaceful possession under sub-section (5) of
Section 10 or forceful dispossession under sub-section (6) of Section 10. On failure to establish any
of those situations, the land owner or holder can claim the benefit of Section 3 of the Repeal Act. The
State Government in this appeal could not establish any of those situations and hence the High
Court is right in holding that the respondent is entitled to get the benefit of Section 3 of the Repeal
Act."
9. Likewise in a decision rendered by the Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court in the case of
Government of Tamil Nadu vs., Mecca Prime Tannery reported in 2012-6-MLJ-273, it has been held
at para 33 to 35 as follows:-
"33. The phrases shall be deemed to have been acquired and shall be deemed to have
been vested absolutely in the State Government occurring in Section 11(3) of the Act,
in our considered opinion, mean that the right, title and interest in respect of the land
shall be deemed to have been vested in the State Government and not possession of
the land. After the right, title and invested is vested in the State Government by
notification under Section 11(3), the State Government has to take further action for
taking https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis possession of the land, if the land owner or
any person in possession refuses or fails to surrender or deliver possession of the
land so vested in the Government.
34. There are cases where after notice under Section 11(5) of the Act, the land owner
delivers possession of the land and acknowledges the same in writing, and the State,
after taking possession of the land so delivered voluntarily by the land owner, either
comes into possession of the same or allots those lands to other persons, then in such
cases, even thereafter, if the land owner or any person claims to be in possession of
those lands, then we have no hesitation in holding that continuance of such
possession even after surrendering or delivering the land to the State is illegal
possession and they shall be treated as encroachers.
35. However, there are cases where although the competent authority issued the
notice under Section 11(5) of the Act to the land owners or persons in possession to
surrender or deliver possession of the land, but the land owner or the person in
possession fails to deliver the land and continues to be in possession of such land and
the authority of the State did not take action under Section 11(6) of the Act for taking
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis delivery of possession, then in such cases, the State
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122399089/ 6
K.Senthamarai Kannan vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 16 December, 2021
Government shall not be deemed to be in possession of those lands. "
10. From the perusal of the above said decisions, it is very clear that the mere vesting of land under
sub-section (3) of Section 10 of the said Act would not confer any right on the State Government, in
the absence of any proof that there was voluntary surrender of vacant land or there was a forceful
dispossession under sub- section (6) of Section 10 of the said Act. Symbolic possession is totally
different and distinct from physical possession. It is only a paper possession, which cannot be
treated or construed as that of possession as required under the Act."
12. Further, the Honourable Supreme Court in the case reported in 2014 (2) CTC 665 (SC) (Gajanan
Kamlya Patil Vs. Addl. Collector & Competent Authority), held in paragraphs 12 and 13 as follows:
"12. We may indicate, apart from the affidavits filed by the officials in this case, no
other document has been made available either before the High Court or before this
Court, either showing that the Appellant had voluntarily
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis surrendered or the Respondents had taken
peaceful or forcible possession of the lands............
13. We have, therefore, clearly indicated that it was always open to the authorities to
take forcible possession and, in fact, in the notice issued under Section 10(5) of the
ULC Act, it was stated that if the possession had not been surrendered, possession
would be taken by application of necessary force. For taking forcible possession,
certain procedures had to be followed. Respondents have no case that such
procedures were followed and forcible possession was taken. Further, there is
nothing to show that the Respondents had taken peaceful possession, nor there is
anything to show that the Appellants had given voluntary possession. Facts would
clearly indicate that only de jure possession had been taken by the Respondents and
not de facto possession before coming into force of the repeal of the Act. Since there
is nothing to show that de facto possession had been taken from the Appellants prior
to the execution of the possession receipt in favour of MRDA, it cannot hold on to the
lands in question, which are legally owned and possessed by the Appellants.
Consequently, we are inclined to allow this https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis appeal
and quash the notice dated 17.2.2005 and subsequent action taken therein in view of
the repeal of the ULC Act. The above reasoning would apply in respect of other
appeals as well and all proceedings initiated against the Appellants, therefore, would
stand quashed."
Therefore, mere symbolic possession is not sufficient. The petitioner is in possession and enjoyment
of the subject property in question.
14. That apart, the subject property is an agricultural in nature and hence it cannot attract the
provisions of the Act. Though necessary changes were carried out in the revenue records in respect
of the subject property comprised in S.F.No.196/3A2 to an extent of 9150 sq.mts., situated at
Sudakamuthur Village as Government Urban Land Ceiling Lands, by the proceedings dated
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122399089/ 7
K.Senthamarai Kannan vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 16 December, 2021
04.03.1999, the entire proceedings have been done as desk work and no physical possession has
been taken in respect of the subject property. Therefore, the entire acquisition proceedings were
lapsed in view of the provisions under Section 3(2) of the Repeal Act.
15. Accordingly, the entire land acquisition proceedings in respect of the land comprised in
R.S.No.196/3, re-numbered as 196/3A2 to an extent of 65 cents in Sundakkamuthur Village,
Coimbatore (South), Coimbatore, is https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis lapsed. The third respondent
is directed to mutate the revenue records in favour of the petitioner and issue patta in respect of the
property within a period of six weeks from the date of the receipt of a copy of this Order.
16. With the above directions, the Writ Petition stands allowed. Consequently, connected
miscellaneous petition is closed. There shall be no order as to costs.
