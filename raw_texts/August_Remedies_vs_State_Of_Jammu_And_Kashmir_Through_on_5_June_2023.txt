dated 10.10.2009 declared the drug in question â€žnot of standard quality(cid:128) as prescribed under the
Drug and Cosmetic Act, respondent no.1 asked proforma respondent No.2 to disclose source of
purchase who disclosed the source of purchase from proforma respondent no.3, when proforma
respondent No.3 was asked to disclose source of purchase from proforma respondent No.4 who in
the end disclosed the name of petitioner as source of purchase. It is stated, that vide letter dated
22.01.2010 dispatched on 19.02.2010 and received by the petitioner on 27.02.2010, respondent No.1
informed petitioner that the drug in question manufactured by the petitioner is found to be not of
standard quality, Govt. Analyst CFDC Jammu copy of report was also communicated to the
petitioner who was not made aware of his valuable right as envisaged u/s 25(4) of the Act for getting
the sample re-tested from sample laboratory and never sent the sample portion of drug in question
to the petitioner, petitioner replied the aforementioned notice vide registered letter No. 26.03.2010
wherein petitioner detailed replied to their allegations and also demanded the re-testing of the drug
in question from central laboratory, however, respondent No.1 instead of sending the drug in
question to the central laboratory for re-analysis deliberately filed the present complaint against
petitioner and proforma respondents, suppressed the reply submitted by the petitioner, wherein,
petitioner disputed the test report of local Govt. Analyst and demanded the re- testing, however,
respondent No.1 filed the complaint on 16.04.2010 just one month before expiry of shelf life period
of drug in question. It is averred, that perusal of complaint reveals that there is no reference to the
actual role played by petitioner and his partners therefore no criminal proceedings can be initiated
against the petitioner, court below without application of mind took cognizance against the
petitioner when the substantial right of petitioner getting the drug re-tested was denied to the
petitioner by deliberate conduct of respondent no.1 and failure on his part to supply one sealed
sample portion of drug in question to the petitioner as mandated in Section 23(4)(iii) is abuse of
process of law, present complaint is filed just one month before expiry of shelf life period of drug in
question and by the time the petitioner was summoned and appeared in court on 04.11.2011 the
drug in question had already expired, petitioner has lost his valuable right of getting the drug in
question re-tested from central laboratory which has caused serious prejudice and denial of
opportunity to the petitioner to avail his vital right provided u/s 25(4) of Drugs and Cosmetics Act
1940, the complaint filed is without jurisdiction and is abuse of process of law the same is liable to
be quashed.
2. Respondent No.1 by filing objections has sought the dismissal of the petition on the grounds, that
the allegations alleged in the complaint prima-facie constitute an offence against the petitioner and
proforma respondents under the Drugs and Cosmetic Act 1940, the offences are serious in nature
and against public health as the drug manufactured by the petitioner was declared to be not of
standard quality by the report of Govt. Analyst, none of the legal fundamental or statutory rights of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/54871966/ 2
August Remedies vs State Of Jammu And Kashmir Through on 5 June, 2023
petitioner under Constitution of India have been infringed, petitioner has raised disputed question
of facts which are required to be appreciated only at the stage of trial. It is contended, that
answering respondent No.1 in exercise of powers vested u/ss 22 & 23 of the Act visited the premises
of proforma respondent No.2 under the name and style of M/S Ravi Medical Agency Udhampur and
lifted sample of drug in question i.e. Tablets BINSPAS (Batch No. 07-305, July 2008 Exp. June,
2010) manufactured by petitioner(cid:128)s company, the said drug was sent to Govt. Analysis CFDL
Jammu for test and analysis and was declared not a standard quality as defined in the Drugs and
Cosmetic Act 1940. It is moreso contended, that during investigation, it was found that the drug in
question was supplied and sold to proforma respondent No.2 by proforma respondent No.3 and in
turn proforma respondent No.4 sold and supplied drug to proforma respondent No.3 which was
manufactured by petitioner(cid:128)s company, a notice dated 22.02.2010 was also sent to petitioners
company through registered post informing them of the report of Govt. Analyst, and finally after
completing the investigation as required under the Act and receipt of sanction from office of
Controller Drugs and Food Control, complaint was filed by respondent No.1 against the petitioner in
the court of Ld. CJM Udhampur u/s 18(a)(1) r/w Section 27(d) of Drugs and Cosmetic Act 1940. It is
contended, that the trial court has rightly taken cognizance against petitioner and other proforma
respondents, the question of denial of substantial right of the petitioner by supplying one sealed
sample portion of drug in question does not arise, there are specific allegations in the complaint
against petitioner(cid:128)s company, the Managing Director and Directors of the petitioner(cid:128)s company
that the drug declared is not of standard quality which has been manufactured by them, all the
mandatory provisions in regard to sampling and sealing of drug in question have been followed, as
such, petitioner and proforma respondents have been arrayed as accused for violating section
18(a)(1) r/w Section 27(d) of the Act who are liable to be punished accordingly.
3. Ld. Counsel for petitioner has sought the quashment of criminal proceedings in complaint filed by
respondent No.1 before the Court of CJM Udhampur bearing case No. 179/75 complaint with all
orders arising there from vide which cognizance has been taken against the petitioner by canvassing
arguments, that the court below without application of mind has taken cognizance against petitioner
when the substantial right of petitioner getting the drug re-tested was denied to him by deliberate
conduct of respondent no.1 and failure on his part to supply one sealed sample portion of drug in
question to the petitioner as mandated in Section 23(4)(iii) is abuse of process of law. It is argued,
that present complaint was filed before the court of Ld. Munsiff (District Judicial Mobile
Magistrate) Udhampur on 16.04.2010 just one month before the expiry of shelf life period of drug in
question dated June 2010, which was submitted to the trial court of Ld. CJM Udhampur on
05.08.2010 and by the time the petitioner was summoned and appeared in trial court of Ld. CJM
Udhampur on 04.11.2011, the drug in question had already expired, whereby, petitioner has lost his
valuable right of getting the drug in question re-tested from central laboratory which has caused
serious prejudice and denial of opportunity to the petitioner to avail his vital right provided u/s
25(4) of Drugs and Cosmetics Act 1940, thereby, the complaint filed is without jurisdiction and is
abuse of process of law, the same alongwith all the orders arising there from require its setting
aside/ quashment. To support his arguments, Ld. Counsel has relied upon (i) the Judgment of
Coordinate Bench of this Court rendered in CRMC No. 614 of 2006 D/d 30.09.2022 titled Cipla
Limited--Petitioner Versus State of Jammu & Kashmir and Another--Respondents & (ii) Criminal
Appeal No. 483 of 2008 arising out of SLP (Crl) No. 13 of 2007 D/d 13.03.2008 decided by Supreme

August Remedies vs State Of Jammu And Kashmir Through on 5 June, 2023
Court of India titled M/S Medicamen Biotech Ltd. & Anr.--Appellants Versus Rubina Bose, Drug
Inspector--Respondent.
4. Ld. Sr. AAG for respondents has sought the dismissal of petition by projecting arguments, that
respondent No.1 after completing the investigation and all the legal formalities as envisaged under
the Drugs and Cosmetics Act 1940 filed complaint against the petitioner and other respondents u/ss
18(a)(1) r/w Section 27 (d) of the aforesaid Act, the trial court has rightly taken cognizance against
the petitioner, the drug sample has been declared not of standard quality, all the mandatory
provisions in regard to sampling and sealing of drug in question have been followed, therefore the
petitioner alongwith other proforma respondents need to be punished accordingly.
5. Heard Ld. Counsel for the parties and perused the record of the trial court.
6. A Coordinate Bench of this Court in CRMC No. 614 of 2006 D/d 30.09.2022 titled Cipla
Limited--Petitioner Versus State of Jammu & Kashmir and Another--Respondents relied by Ld.
Counsel for petitioner, while dismissing the complaint and order of taking cognizance by the court
of CJM Jammu dated 29.01.2010 by issuing process against petitioner/accused and observing that
valuable right of the petitioner/accused envisaged under Section 25(3)(4) of Drugs and Cosmetics
Act 1940 has been violated, in paras 13, 14, 15, 17, 19 & 20 held as under:-
(13) On account of inaction of the respondents, the valuable right of the petitioner to
adduce evidence in controversion to the report of the Government Analyst has been
lost. The matter does not rest here, the respondents have lodged the impugned
complaint against the petitioner on 29th January, 2010 whereas the date of expiry of
the Drug in question was January, 2010. Thus, no time was left with the petitioner to
even seek an order of re-testing of the sample after filing of the complaint, as by that
time the drug in question had already outlived its life. This clearly points to the fact
that the respondents have by their inaction defeated the right of the petitioner to
adduce evidence in controversion of the report of the Government Analyst. This
negligence and inaction on part of the complainant is fatal to the prosecution case.
(14) High Court of Bombay in M/S Zim Laboratories, Bombay and others v. State of
Maharashtra, 1999 Cri.L.J 2903, in somewhat similar circumstances quashed the
order of taking cognizance and set aside the complaint.
While doing so, the Court relied upon following observations of the Supreme Court in Municipal
Corporation of Delhi v. Ghisa Ram, AIR 1967 SC 970:
"It appears to us that when a valuable right is conferred by Section 13(2) of the Act on
the vendor to have the sample given to him analysed by the Director of Central Food
Laboratory, it is to be expected that the prosecution will proceed in such a manner
that right will not be denied to him. The right is a valuable one, because the certificate
of the Director supersedes the report of the Public Analyst and is treated as
conclusive evidence of its contents. Obviously, the right has been given to the vendor
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/54871966/ 4
August Remedies vs State Of Jammu And Kashmir Through on 5 June, 2023
in order that, for his satisfaction and proper defence, he should be able to have the
sample kept in his charge analysed by a greater expert whose certificate is to be
accepted by Court as a conclusive evidence. In a case where there is denial of this
right on account of the deliberate conduct of the prosecution, we think that the
vendor, in his trial, is so seriously prejudiced that it would not be proper to uphold
his conviction on the basis of the report of the Public Analyst, even though that report
continues to be evidence in the case of the facts contained therein."
(15) Similarly, in Nikson Pharmaceuticals and Ors. V. State of Rajasthan and Ors, 2008(3 Crimes
573 (Raj.), the High Court of Rajasthan has observed that expiry date of sample is relevant and in
order to safeguard the rights of accused to have sample tested from Central Insecticide Laboratory,
it is incumbent upon the prosecution to file complaint expeditiously so that right of accused is not
lost. (17) In State of Haryana v. Unique Farmaid (P) Ltd., (1999) 8 SCC 190, the Supreme Court
while dealing with a case under the provisions of Insecticides Act, which are analogous to the
provisions contained in Section 25(4) of the Act, has observed as under:-
"12. It cannot be gainsaid, therefore, that the respondents in these appeals have been
deprived of their valuable right to have the sample tested from the Central
Insecticides Laboratory under sub- section (4) of Section 24 of the Act. Under
sub-section (3) of Section 24 report signed by the Insecticide analyst shall be
evidence of the facts stated therein and shall be conclusive evidence against the
accused only if the accused do not, within 28 days of the receipt of the report, notify
in writing to the Insecticides Inspector or the Court before which proceedings are
pending that they intend to adduce evidence to controvert the report. In the present
cases Insecticide Inspector was notified that the accused intended to adduce evidence
to controvert the report. By the time the matter reached the court, shelf life of the
sample had already expired and no purpose would have been served informing the
court of such an intention. The report of the Insecticide Analyst was, therefore, not
conclusive. A valuable right had been conferred on the accused to have the sample
tested from the Central Insecticides Laboratory and in the circumstances of the case
accused have been deprived of that right, thus, prejudicing them in their defence.
13. In these circumstances, High Court was right in concluding that it will be an
abuse of the process of court if the prosecution is continued against the respondents -
the accused persons. High Court rightly quashed the criminal complaint. We uphold
the order of the High Court and would dismiss the appeals."
(19) From the foregoing analysis of the legal position, it is clear that once it is established that
valuable right of the accused to adduce evidence in controversion of the Government Analyst(cid:128)s
report is defeated due to acts and omissions of the Drugs Inspector, prosecution against the accused
deserves to be quashed.
(20) In the instant case, the sequence of events, as narrated in the preceding paras, shows that the
respondent-Drugs Inspector has failed to adhere to the mandatory requirements, inasmuch as he
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/54871966/ 5
August Remedies vs State Of Jammu And Kashmir Through on 5 June, 2023
has not taken steps with reasonable dispatch so that the petitioner could have availed its right to get
the sample re-tested in accordance with the its right under Section 25(3) of the Act. There has been
inaction on part of the Drugs Inspector in responding to the communications of the petitioner
seeking clarification regarding sample of the drugs and the record further shows that though the
sample of the drug was collected on 24 th July, 2007, report of Government Analyst was obtained
only on 25th April, 2008 i.e. after about nine months. This clearly depicts inaction and negligence
on part of the respondents, which has resulted in loss of valuable right to the petitioner.
Similarly, in Criminal Appeal No. 483 of 2008 arising out of SLP (Crl) No. 13 of 2007 D/d
13.03.2008 decided by Supreme Court of India titled M/S Medicamen Biotech Ltd. &
Anr.--Appellants Versus Rubina Bose, Drug Inspector--Respondent further relied by Ld. Counsel for
petitioner, Hon(cid:128)ble Supreme Court of India quashed the proceedings on the ground that the
accused in the said case has been deprived of valuable right under Section 25(3) & 25(4) of Drugs
and Cosmetics Act 1940.
7. Ratios of the judgments (Supra) relied by Ld. Counsel for petitioner, squarely apply to the facts of
the case in hand. In the case in hand, complaint against petitioner and proforma respondents 2 to 4
has been filed in the court of Ld. Munsiff (District Judicial Mobile Magistrate) Udhampur on
16.04.2010 before the expiry date of June 2010 of the drug BINSPAS Tablets in question, however,
the complaint in hand was submitted to the trial court of Ld. CJM Udhampur on 05.08.2010. The
scanned record of trial court of Ld. CJM Udhampur depicts that the petitioner was summoned and
appeared in the trial court on 04.11.2011 and by that time the date of drug in question had expired
on June 2010. Respondent No.1 Drug Inspector failed to adhere to the mandatory requirements, in
as much as, he did not take steps with reasonable dispatch so that petitioner could have availed it(cid:128)s
right to get the sample of drug of BINSPAS Tablets re-tested in accordance with it(cid:128)s right mandated
u/s 25(3) of the Act. There has been inaction on part of respondent no.1 Drug Inspector which
clearly depict negligence on his part, which has resulted in loss of valuable right of the petitioner to
get the drug sample re-tested. By the time the petitioner appeared in the court on 04.11.2011, the
shelf life of sample drug of BINSPAS Tablets had already expired on June 2010 (i.e. almost 1 year
and 5 months elapsed) and no purpose would have been served informing the court of such an
intention of the petitioner to get the drug re-tested which stood already expired. Therefore, in light
of ratios of the judgments (Supra) a valuable statutory right guaranteed to the petitioner (accused)
as envisaged u/s 25(3) & 25(4) of Drugs and Cosmetics Act 1940 has been violated causing serious
prejudice to his defense, whereby, the prosecution against petitioner (accused) deserved to be
quashed.
8. For all what has been discussed above, the petition in hand is allowed, and the impugned
complaint pending trial before the court of Ld. CJM Udhampur alongwith all the
proceedings/orders emanating there from stand quashed.
9. Disposed off accordingly alongwith connected CMPs if any. Copy of this order be forthwith
transmitted to the trial court for information and compliance.
