Patna High Court CR. WJC No.65 of 2022 dt.09-10-2025
3/14
3. However, despite repeated opportunities, none
appeared on behalf of private respondent no.10.
4. Both the petitions have been filed by the petitioners
for quashing the First Information Report in connection with
Ara Nawada P.S. Case No. 530/2019 (G.R.No. 3222/2019)
registered on 15.07.2019 under Sections 406 and 420/34 of the
Indian Penal Code.
5. Brief facts of the case are that on 15.07.2019, the
informant Binod Kumar Pandey made his written complaint
before the Officer-in-charge of Ara Nawada Police Station
alleging therein that the authorities of Methodist Church in India
have announced that they wanted to sell 30 Katha (94 decimals
approx) of land situated in Chandwa Kothi. Thereafter, on
02.09.2013
, an agreement was prepared with regard to sale of the aforesaid land @ Rs.55,000/-per decimal for
which total consideration amount was fixed as Rs.51,70,000/-. The informant paid total
consideration amount of Rs.51,70,000/- for purchase of 30 Katha of land. Subsequently, total 26
Katha of land by way of 16 sale deeds was executed in favour of the informant. For transfer of
remaining 4 Katha, the accused persons did not take any step. Although with the intervention of
others, co-accused Alfred Andrews and Shri Manjar Masih got Patna High Court CR. WJC No.65 of
2022 dt.09-10-2025 prepared two sale deeds for sale of four Katha of land, however, they did not
present themselves before the Registrar for registration of the said two deeds. Thus, 4 Katha of lands
could not be registered in favour of the informant, though the accused persons received the total
consideration amount.
6. It is further alleged that on 08th July 2019, when the informant had been standing near
Amirchand Kothi on a road, a Scorpio vehicle stopped in front of him and the driver of the said
vehicle came to the informant and asked his name. When the informant told the driver his name,
the driver told him that the persons sitting in the vehicle were calling him. The informant then went
to meet them and found that petitioner, namely Alfred Andrews along with two unknown persons
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/120953004/ 3
Rev. Alfred Andrews @ Alfred Andrews vs The State Of Bihar Through Chief ... on 9 October, 2025
siting in the vehicle, upon seeing the informant they told him to return the original documents
otherwise he would be blown to pieces. Furthermore, it is alleged by the informant that they made
him to talk to one Nirmal Michael Paul over mobile who again threatened the informant saying that
if he wanted to keep his family safe then he should return the two unregistered deeds.
7. On the basis of written report of the informant, Ara Nawada P.S. Case No.530/2019 under
Sections 406 and 420/34 of the Indian Penal Code was instituted and immediately Patna High
Court CR. WJC No.65 of 2022 dt.09-10-2025 thereafter investigation of the case was taken by the
police.
8. Mr. Rajendra Narain, learned senior counsel, appearing on behalf of the petitioners submits that
as far as the petitioner of Cr.W.J.C. No. 65 of 2022 is concerned, no allegations have been made
against him in the entire FIR and the allegations against the petitioners of Cr.W.J.C. No. 127 of 2020
are completely false, frivolous, vexatious and made with sole purpose of pressurizing the petitioners
and his organization. The learned senior counsel further submits that the petitioners of Cr.W.J.C.
No. 127 of 2020 are members of the sale/development of Lease Committee of Lucknow Regional
Conference of Methodist Church in India. The learned senior counsel further submits that in a
meeting of the said Committee, a decision was taken to sell 30 Katha/94 decimals @ Rs.55,000/-per
decimal in favour of the informant and pursuant thereto a power of attorney was issued by the
petitioner of Cr.W.J.C. No. 65 of 2022, who was the then General Secretary of said Committee in
favour of the petitioners of Cr.W.J.C. No. 127 of 2020 namely Rev. Alfred Andrews @ Alfred
Andrews and Manzar Masih to sell the said land.
9. The learned senior counsel further submits that after payment of the consideration amount, the
informant Patna High Court CR. WJC No.65 of 2022 dt.09-10-2025 himself deviated from the
minutes of the meeting as a total of 26 kathas of land was executed in favour of informant by way of
sale deeds and soon thereafter the informant illegally took physical possession of 32 kathas of land
instead of the 26 kathas and, therefore, the petitioners on their part have not deviated from 30
kathas and it is the informant himself who took possession of 32 kathas of land, i.e., two kathas of
land in excess of the agreement.
10. The learned senior counsel further submits that the instant case relates to part performance and
is purely a civil dispute and the informant is trying to give the same dispute a criminal color. He
further submits that there is nothing in the entire FIR to make out a case under Sections 420, 406 of
the IPC. The learned senior counsel further submits that till date charge sheet has not been
submitted.
11. The learned senior counsel next submits that the informant is a habitual litigant and it is his
modus operandi to file false and frivolous cases in the matters relating to land deals/transactions for
the sole purpose to grab more land of the vendee and to harass his opponents. To corroborate this
averment, he draws this Courts' attention to an order passed by a Coordinate Bench of this Court in
Cr. Misc. No. 61855 of 2018. Patna High Court CR. WJC No.65 of 2022 dt.09-10-2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/120953004/ 4
Rev. Alfred Andrews @ Alfred Andrews vs The State Of Bihar Through Chief ... on 9 October, 2025
12. Thus, learned senior counsel submits that allowing the prosecution to continue would amount to
an abuse of the process of the Court and, hence, the FIR may be quashed.
13. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner in Cr.W.J.C. No. 65 of 2022 adopted
the arguments of learned senior counsel and reiterated that there is no allegation against the
petitioner of Cr.W.J.C. No. 65 of 2022 in the entire FIR.
14. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the State respondent submits that after the
institution of the instant FIR, the police investigated the matter and the case has been found true
against all the named accused persons. The learned counsel further submits that during the
supervision of the then Superintendent of Police, Bhojpur, the case has been found true against
petitioners namely Rev. Alfred Andrews @ Alfred Andrews and Manzar Masih and under Sections
420, 406, 506, and 34 of the IPC and for the rest named accused persons, a detailed further
investigation is needed. Thus, learned counsel submits that no interference in the matter is required
by this Court.
15. I have given my thoughtful consideration to the rival submission of the parties and perused the
materials Patna High Court CR. WJC No.65 of 2022 dt.09-10-2025 available on record.
16. From bare perusal of the FIR, it appears that the grievance of the informant is towards
non-compliance of contractual obligation by the petitioners. Hence, the dispute appears to be civil in
nature and so far as the allegation of extending threatens is concerned, the offence for the same has
not been incorporated in the instant FIR. Moreover, the allegation with regard to threatening
appears to be ornamental and afterthought, as no report in this regard was given to the police
immediately after the occurrence as the occurrence took place lastly on 08.07.2019, but the written
report on which FIR was registered was submitted by the informant on 15.07.2019, i.e., after
inordinate delay of seven days, for which there is no explanation.
17. So far as main offences under Sections 420 and 406 IPC are concerned, learned senior counsel
appearing on behalf of the petitioners appears to be right in his submission that even if the entire
allegations made in the FIR are accepted at their face value, none of the ingredients of the offences
would be attracted.
18. Section 406 of the IPC prescribes punishment for the criminal breach of trust. The offence of
criminal breach of Patna High Court CR. WJC No.65 of 2022 dt.09-10-2025 trust is defined under
Section 405 of the IPC. Section 405 of the IPC provides that whoever, being in any manner
entrusted with property, or with any dominion over property, dishonestly misappropriates or
converts to his own use that property, or dishonestly uses or disposes of that property in violation of
any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged, or of any legal
contract, express or implied, which he has made touching the discharge of such trust, or willfully
suffers any other person so to do, commits "criminal breach of trust".
19. As seen above, the essential ingredients in order to constitute an offence of criminal breach of
trust is entrusting a person with property or with any dominion over the property and that the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/120953004/ 5
Rev. Alfred Andrews @ Alfred Andrews vs The State Of Bihar Through Chief ... on 9 October, 2025
person entrusted dishonestly misappropriated or converted that property to his own use.
20. Similarly, Section 420 of the IPC provides punishment for the offence of cheating and
dishonestly inducing delivery of property. The offence of cheating is defined under Section 415 of the
IPC. It provides that whoever, by deceiving any person, fraudulently or dishonestly induces the
person so deceived to deliver any property to any person, or to consent that any person shall retain
any property, or intentionally Patna High Court CR. WJC No.65 of 2022 dt.09-10-2025 induces the
person so deceived to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit if he were not so
deceived, and which act or omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person in
body, mind, reputation or property, is said to "cheat".
21. Therefore, to hold a person guilty of cheating as defined under Section 415 of the IPC, it is
necessary to show that he had fraudulent or dishonest intention at the time of making the promise
with an intention to retain the property. It further requires deception of any person inducing that
person to deliver any property to any person or that any person shall retain any property by
intentionally inducing that person to do or omit to do anything.
22. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the celebrated judgment of State of Haryana and Others Vs.
Bhajan Lal and Others, 1992 Supp (1) Supreme Court Cases 335 in para 102 has held as:
"102. In the backdrop of the interpretation of the various relevant provisions of the
Code under Chapter XIV and of the principles of law enunciated by this Court in a
series of decisions relating to the exercise of the extraordinary power under Article
226 or the inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code which we have extracted
and reproduced above, we give the following Patna High Court CR. WJC No.65 of
2022 dt.09-10-2025 categories of cases by way of illustration wherein such power
could be exercised either to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to
secure the ends of justice, though it may not be possible to lay down any precise,
clearly defined and sufficiently channelised and inflexible guidelines or rigid
formulae and to give an exhaustive list of myriad kinds of cases wherein such power
should be exercised.
(1) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the complaint, even
if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie
constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused.
(2) Where the allegations in the first informant report and other materials, if any,
accompanying the FIR do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an
investigation by police officers under Section156(1) of the Code except under an order
of a Magistrate within the purview of Section155(2) of the Code.
(3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or complaint and the
evidence collected in support of the same do not disclose the commission of nay
offence and make out a case against the accused.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/120953004/ 6
Rev. Alfred Andrews @ Alfred Andrews vs The State Of Bihar Through Chief ... on 9 October, 2025
(4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable offence but
constitute only a non-cognizable offence, no investigation is permitted by a police
officer without an order of a Magistrate as contemplated under Section 155(2) of the
Code.
Patna High Court CR. WJC No.65 of 2022 dt.09-10-2025 (5) Where the allegations made in the FIR
or complaint are so absurd and inherently improbable on the basis of which no prudent persons can
ever reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused.
(6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of the Code or the
concerned Act (under which a criminal proceeding is instituted) to the institution and continuance
of the proceedings and/or where there is a specific provision in the Code or the concerned Act,
providing efficacious redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party.
(7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and/or where the proceeding
is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a
view to spite him due to private and personal grudge."
23. In the present case, allowing the criminal proceedings to take place and the petitioners to appear
for trial would be sheer abuse of process of law and the case of the petitioners would be squarely
covered under the guidelines enumerated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Bhajan Lal
(supra).
24. Further, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Ganga Dhar Kalita v. State of Assam, (2015) 9
SCC 647 in Patna High Court CR. WJC No.65 of 2022 dt.09-10-2025 paragraph 10 held as under:-
"10.No doubt, where the criminal complaints are filed in respect of property disputes
civil in nature only to harass the accused, and to pressurise him in the civil litigation
pending, and there is prima facie abuse of process of law, it is well within the
jurisdiction of the High Court to exercise its powers under Section 482 of the Code to
quash the criminal proceedings. However, the powers under the section are required
to be exercised sparingly. In Kamaladevi Agarwal v. State of W.B. [(2002) 1 SCC 555 :
2002 SCC (Cri) 200] this Court has observed as under: (SCC pp. 559- 60, para 7) "7.
This Court has consistently held that the revisional or inherent powers of quashing
the proceedings at the initial stage should be exercised sparingly and only where the
allegations made in the complaint or the FIR, even if taken at their face value and
accepted in entirety, do not prima facie disclose the commission of an offence.
Disputed and controversial facts cannot be made the basis for the exercise of the
jurisdiction."
25. Further, Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Ankul Singh Vs. State of U.P. & Anr. in Cr. Appeal
No. 4250 of 2025 held in paragraph 21 as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/120953004/ 7
Rev. Alfred Andrews @ Alfred Andrews vs The State Of Bihar Through Chief ... on 9 October, 2025
"21. The High Court, in refusing to quash the proceedings, misdirected itself in law by
failing to apply the ratio laid down in Bhajan Lal, and the subsequent authorities
referred to above, which uniformly hold that the machinery of criminal law cannot
Patna High Court CR. WJC No.65 of 2022 dt.09-10-2025 be permitted to be misused
for settling civil disputes or to wreak vengeance."
26. In the light of aforesaid discussion as well as law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, I am
of the considered opinion that the present criminal proceeding appears to be manifestly attended
with mala fide and the same is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for settling civil
disputes giving criminal colour to a purely civil dispute. Hence, allowing the prosecution to continue
would amount to an abuse of the process of the Court. Therefore, the FIR with consequent
proceeding in connection with Ara Nawada P.S. Case No. 530/2019 is hereby quashed qua the
petitioners.
27. Accordingly, both the writ petitions are allowed.
