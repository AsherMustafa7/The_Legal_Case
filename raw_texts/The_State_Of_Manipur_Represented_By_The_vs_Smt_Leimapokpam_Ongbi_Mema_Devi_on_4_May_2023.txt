A. Bimol Singh, J [1] Heard Mr S. Nepolean learned GA appearing for the appellants, Mr B. Prem
Sharma, learned counsel appearing for respondents No 1, 4 and 5 and Mr. S. Suresh, learned
counsel appearing for respondent No. 2.
The present appeal had been filed challenging the order dated 20-12-2018 passed by the learned
Single Judge in WP(C) No. 211 of 2017. [2] The brief facts of the present case is that late Shri L. Amu
Singh, who was serving as Section Officer in the Electrical Division No. III of the erstwhile
Department of Electricity, Government of Manipur, took voluntary retirement from service w.e.f.
29-02-2004 and after his retirement, he was enjoying his pension till he died on 15-11-2016. Shri L
Amu Singh had two wives namely, Smt. Leimapokpam (O) Mema Devi, the respondent No. 1 in the
present writ appeal (hereinafter referred to as the "first wife") and Smt. Mutum Subadani Devi, the
respondent No. 3 in the present writ appeal (hereinafter referred to as the "second wife"). After the
death of her husband, the first wife filed a writ petition being WP(C) No. 211 of 2017 before this

court claiming that the second wife was trying to draw the family pension by neglecting her case and
praying for directing the official respondents to initiate and complete the process for payment of
family pension of the deceased husband in favour of the first wife. [3] On being submitted that the
first wife and second wife have come to an amicable settlement, the learned Single Judge disposed
of the aforesaid writ petition by recording the terms and conditions of the amicable settlement
arrived at between the first wife and second wife, which are as under:-
"(i) As regards the Family pension of late L. Amu Singh under PPO No. SM/22030, it
is agreed that the Application No. 1 (Writ Petitioner) shall get 1/3 (one third) of the
said pension amount from the month of June, 2018 and the remaining 2/3 (two
third) shall be enjoyed by the Applicant No. 2 (Respondent No. 6 in the writ petition)
(ii) Both the Applicants shall given their corporation to the concerned officials to
share the pension amount in the manner state above.
(iii) As regards the homestead of late L. Amu Singh under patta No. 171 (Part
Old)/182 (New) covered by Dag No. 210 having an area of 0.25871 acres (0.1047
hectares) of Village No. 20, Houkha Manning, it has been agreed that the Applicant
No. 1 (Writ Petitioner) shall get a portion measuring 42 feets from North to South on
the western side and 49 feets from North to South on the Eastern side and 32 feets
from East to West on the Northern side and 32 feets from East to West on the
Southern side on the North Western corner of the said homestead and the remaining
portion out of the whole homestead land is the share of the Applicant No. 2
(Respondent No. 6).
(iv) The Applicant No. 1 (Writ Petitioner) out of her said share of the said homestead
shall keep a portion measuring 6 feet from North to South covering the entire length
of her said share potion from East to West on the Northern side of her said portion
touching the share portion of the Applicant No. 2 (Respondent No. 6 of the Writ
Petition) which shall be used as the approach road of the Applicants.
In terms of the settlement reached between the parties, this writ petition is disposed of."
[4] The State respondents preferred the present writ appeal assailing the order passed by the
learned Single Judge only on the ground that family pension is not admissible to more than one
widow of a "Hindu" Government servant as per Government of India's Decision No. (15) below Rule
54 of the CCS (Pension) Rules, 1977 as amended from time to time and that as per the clarification
issued by the State Government in its Office Memorandum dated 21-06-1994, sharing the family
pension by widows was not to be allowed where the death of the Government employee occured on
or after 28-01-1991, i.e. the date of adoption of Government of India's Clarification and as such
sharing the family pension by widows of a deceased Government employee is not permissible and
accordingly, the agreement between the two wives is void as per Section 24 of the Indian Contract
Act, 1872.

[5] During the pendency of the present writ appeal, the second wife expired on 19-05-2021 leaving
behind a daughter and two sons. The daughter had already married and the two sons, who are the
legal representatives of the deceased second wife have been brought on record as respondents No. 4
and 5 in the present writ appeal. The said two sons of the second wife filed two separate affidavits
both dated 18-04-2023 stating inter alia that they are living together with the first wife and the first
wife is looking after them and that they have no objection in recording the name of the first wife in
the Pension Book and giving the family pension of their father to the first wife.
[6] Taking into consideration the fact that the second wife had expired during the pendency of the
present writ appeal and also taking into consideration the affidavits filed by the two sons of the
deceased second wife, we are of the considered view that the ground on which the present appeal
had been filed no longer exist and due to the subsequent events which occurred after filing of the
present writ appeal, there is no longer any impediment in giving the family pension of the deceased
Government employee, namely Shri L. Amu Singh, in favour of the first wife. [7] In view of the
above, we disposed of the present appeal by directing the concerned authorities of the State
Government to initiate and complete the process for payment of the family pension of the deceased
Government employee, namely Late L. Amu Singh in favour of his first wife namely, Smt.
Leimapokpam (O) Mema Devi. The whole process should be completed within a period of three
months from today. The impugned order passed by the learned Single Judge is modified to the
extent indicated above. Writ appeal is disposed of without any order as to cost.
