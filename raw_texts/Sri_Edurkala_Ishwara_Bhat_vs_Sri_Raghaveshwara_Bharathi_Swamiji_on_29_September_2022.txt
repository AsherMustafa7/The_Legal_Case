ORDER
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/176896112/ 3
Sri. Edurkala Ishwara Bhat vs Sri. Raghaveshwara Bharathi Swamiji on 29 September, 2022
The petitioners claim to be devotees of Sri.Ramachandrapura Math (hereinafter referred to as 'the
Math' for short). The petitioners have filed this petition pro bono publico seeking the following
reliefs:
"a. An appropriate writ/direction to the 3rd respondent to exercise its executive
power to regulate the 2nd respondent and all other Maths in the state pending the
passing/ enactment of a regulatory statute by the State Legislature. Alternatively, to
frame a scheme to regulate Maths in general and in the present context to regulate
the 2nd Respondent having regard to the misuse and abuse of powers by the 1st
respondent.
b. An appropriate writ/direction removing the 1st respondent from the office of
Mathadipathi/Mahant or head of the Peetha of the 2nd Respondent Math/Institution
and direct prosecution for misuse and abuse of the office;
c. To appoint a committee comprising of eminent devotees, representatives /officials
of the government, retired Judge/s of the Hon'ble Supreme Court or this Court who
would suggest the successor/Peethadipathi to the 2nd Respondent and to manage/
dminister the affairs of the 2nd Respondent till the successor takes charge;
d. To direct the 6th respondent to order investigation into affairs of the 1st and 2nd
Respondents regarding evasion of tax and other offences under the Tax legislations
and initiate action against concerned persons;
e. To monitor all investigations regarding complaints/offences lodged and reported
till now and that may be lodged in future against the 1st Respondent and in relation
to the affairs of the 2nd Respondent and anything incidental or connected thereto;
f. Pass such other order/s as may be necessary in the peculiar facts and circumstances
of the case and in the interest of justice and equity."
2. Facts giving rise to filing of these petitions in nutshell are that the Math was established in 8th
Century and was known as Raghottama Math and is involved in propagation of tenets of Sanathan
Dharma and Indian Philosophy and is an institution propagating social, religious philosophical and
charitable issues. The Math is headed by a Mathadhipathi viz., respondent No.2 who is the head of
spiritual fraternity and has to perform religious of a religious teacher. It is his duty to practice and
propagate the religious tenets. The affairs of Math / Religious institutions were being regulated by
Mysore Religious and Charitable Institutions Act, 1927. The said Act was repealed by Karnataka
Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments Act, 1997 (hereinafter referred to as 'the
1997 Act' for short). The 1997 Act was enacted in view of long standing public demand to bring
about a uniform law to provide for regulation of charitable endowments and Hindu religious
institutions in the State. Section 1(4) of the 1997 Act which is relevant for the purpose of the
controversy involved in this petition is extracted below for the facility of reference:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/176896112/ 4
Sri. Edurkala Ishwara Bhat vs Sri. Raghaveshwara Bharathi Swamiji on 29 September, 2022
"1(4) It shall apply to, all religious institutions or charitable endowments notified
under Section 23. Section 53 and Chapter VII shall apply to all religious institutions
endowments other than those notified under Section 23.
Provided that it shall not apply to a math or temple attached to or managed by math.
Explanation: For the purpose of this Act a mutt means a religious institution presided
over by a person whose principal duty is to engage himself in the teaching and
propagation of religion, teachings and philosophy of the denomination, sect or
sampradaya to which the mutt belongs and in imparting religious instruction and
training and rendering spiritual service or who exercises or claims to exercise
spiritual headship over a body of disciples and includes any place or places of
religious worship, instruction or training which are pertinent to the institution."
3. Thus, the 1997 Act does not apply to a Math or Temple attached to or managed by Math. The
respondent No.1 took over as Matadhipathi of the Math from 18.04.1999. A division bench of this
court vide judgment in SRI.SAHASRA LINGESHWARA TEMPLE v. STATE OF KARNATAKA AND
ANOTHER1, struck down the Act as unconstitutional. Against the said judgment of Division Bench
of this court, a Special Leave Petition has been filed before Hon'ble Supreme Court in which
judgment rendered by a division bench of this court has been stayed. The Act therefore, has revived.
4. The Act was amended by Act No.27 of 2011 with effect from 04.05.2011. Section 2(19-A) was
inserted by which, expression "Math" was defined. Section 2(19-A) reads as under:
"(19-A) "Math" means a religious institution presided over by a person whose principal duty is to
engage himself, in teaching and (2007) 1 KLJ 1 propagation of religion, teachings and philosophy of
the denomination, sect or sampradaya to which the Math belongs and in imparting religious
instruction and training and rendering spiritual service who exercises or claims to exercise spiritual
headship over a body of disciples and includes any place or places of religious worship, instruction
or training which are pertinent to the institution including religious institutions attached either
religiously or administratively to the Maths."
5. On 26.08.2014, one Smt. Premalatha filed a complaint against respondent No.1, in pursuance of
which First Information Report on 28.08.2014 was lodged against respondent No.1 vide Crime
No.164/2014. Thereafter, her brother-in-law namely, Shyam Prasad Shastry committed suicide on
31.08.2014. The respondent No.1 filed a writ petition namely, W.P.No.43825/2014 seeking
quashment of the complaint as well as First Information Report registered in Crime No.164/2014.
The said writ petition was dismissed by an order dated 09.10.2014.
6. One T.T.Hegde, on or about 18.03.2016, claiming to be a devotee of the Math filed a petition
under Section 92 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Code' for
short). Thereafter, one Prashanth Kumar M.B and Lokesh M. also filed a petition under Section 92
of the Code for grant of leave to file a suit seeking removal of respondent No.1 from the seat of
Peetadhipathi / Mahant of the Math and to appoint a new Peetadhipathi / Mahant. The aforesaid
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/176896112/ 5
Sri. Edurkala Ishwara Bhat vs Sri. Raghaveshwara Bharathi Swamiji on 29 September, 2022
persons also sought the relief of rendition of accounts of the Math as well as a decree for permanent
injunction restraining respondent No.1 from representing as Peetadhipathi / Mahant of the Math.
7. By an order dated 31.03.2016, the respondent No.1 was discharged in respect of an offence lodged
against him in pursuance of the complaint made by Smt. Premalatha.
8. The petition under Section 92 of the Code filed by Prashanth Kumar M.B and Lokesh M. was
rejected by an order dated 17.10.2017. The petition under Section 92 of the Code filed by
Mr.T.T.Hegde was dismissed for non-prosecution on 30.11.2017.
9. The petitioners thereafter claiming to be the devotees of the Math have filed this petition on
25.04.2016, inter alia on the ground that respondent No.1 has committed malpractices and has
rendered himself ineligible to continue as Peetadhipathi / Mahant. A Division Bench of this Court,
while issuing notice, passed the following order on 28.04.2016:
"Liberty is granted to the writ petitioner(s) to make a representation to the Chief
Secretary, Government of Karnataka, ventilating their grievances. The Chief
Secretary is requested to consider and dispose of such representation after giving
opportunity of hearing to all the concerned in the Mather and uninfluenced by the
pendency of these writ petitions.
Post these writ petitions one week after the reopening of the court after annual
vacation 2016."
10. Thereafter, petitioner No.1 and petitioner No.2 submitted a representation on 30.04.2016 to the
Chief Secretary, Government of Karnataka, in which inter alia a prayer was made to restrain
respondent No.1 from discharging duties as Peetadhipathi of the Math. The aforesaid petitioners
also requested the Chief Secretary to formulate a scheme for superintendence of functioning of all
Maths in the State of Karnataka including the procedure for appointment, suspension and removal
of the pontiffs and his successors in exercise of the powers under Article 162 of the Constitution. The
aforesaid petitioners also sought a special audit and investigation into the affairs of the Math. The
Chief Secretary, by an order dated 23.05.2017, directed to conduct an enquiry into the allegations
made by petitioner Nos.1 and 2.
11. The respondent Nos.1 and 2 challenged the order in W.P.No.28337/2017 in a writ petition. The
learned Single Judge, by an order dated 25.07.2017, stayed the operation of the order dated
23.05.2017 passed by the Chief Secretary. The aforesaid interim order was challenged in
W.A.No.4699/2017 before a Division Bench of this Court. The respondent Nos.1 and 2 filed an
interlocutory application namely, I.A.No.2/2016 seeking, recall of the order dated 28.04.2016.
12. A Division Bench of this Court, by an order dated 27.06.2019, without deciding the issue of
maintainability of the appeal, dismissed I.A.No.2/2016 seeking recall of the order dated 28.04.2016
inter alia on the ground that no ground is made out to allow the same. Thereafter, by another order
dated 25.11.2019, it was inter alia held that the order passed by the Chief Secretary dated 23.05.2017
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/176896112/ 6
Sri. Edurkala Ishwara Bhat vs Sri. Raghaveshwara Bharathi Swamiji on 29 September, 2022
is challenged in W.P.No.28337/2017. Therefore, a Division Bench of this Court directed to list
W.P.No.28337/2017 along with this writ petition.
13. Learned Single Judge by an order dated 29.12.2021 passed in Criminal Revision Petition
No.638/2016 and Criminal Revision Petition No.550/2016 upheld the order of discharge passed by
the Trial Court dated 31.03.2016. The orders dated 27.06.2019 and 25.11.2019 passed by Division
Bench of this Court were assailed by the respondent Nos.1 and 2 before Hon'ble Supreme Court in
Civil Appeal Nos.5531-5538/2022. The aforesaid Special Leave Petition was disposed of by Hon'ble
Supreme Court by an order dated 22.08.2022. The relevant extract of the order reads as under:
"Since the matters (*sic) concerning maintainability of the writ petition would go to the root of the
Mather and consequential directions issued by the Chief Secretary would depend squarely on such
issue of maintainability, we direct as under:
"(a) The order dated 27.06.2019 I set aside, and I.A. No.2 of 2016 is restored to the file of the High
Court to be disposed of afresh on merits.
(b) Till the disposal of I.A.No.2 of 2016, the effect and operation of the order dated 28.04.2016 shall
remain stayed.
(c) Consequently, the consideration bestowed by the Chief Secretary and the resultant orders by him
shall also not be given any effect till the Mather regarding maintainability of the writ petition is
decided by the High Court.
(d) All other rights and contentions of the parties are left open.
(e) In order to facilitate early disposal of the Mathers, the parties shall appear before the High Court
on 05.09.2022.
9. The instant Civil Appeals are thus allowed without any order as to costs.
10. Any observation made by this Court shall not be taken to be reflection on merits of the rival
contentions and submissions."
14. In the aforesaid factual background, this writ petition arises for consideration. We have heard
the submissions of learned Senior Counsels for the parties and learned Additional Advocate General
on the maintainability of the appeal and with consent of learned Senior Counsels and as well as
learned counsel for the parties on merits as well.
15. The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners, at the outset, clarified that the petitioners are not
seeking any mandamus to the Legislature to enact a law. It is further submitted that there is a
vacuum with regard to an effective Legislation in relation to curbing and taking remedial action in
respect of Mathers pertaining to Maths and Mathadipathis. It is submitted that inaction on the part
of the Government cannot be sustained. It is contended that executive powers under Article 162 of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/176896112/ 7
Sri. Edurkala Ishwara Bhat vs Sri. Raghaveshwara Bharathi Swamiji on 29 September, 2022
the Constitution of India can be exercised to frame a scheme in respect of Maths. It is also urged
that decision on a petition under Section 92 of the Code does not affect the jurisdiction of this court
under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. It is also urged that there is a need to evolve a
mechanism to deal with the issue of administration of Maths in the State of Karnataka. Learned
Senior counsel has also taken us through the averments made in the writ petition as well as several
documents and has relied on decisions in the cases of SRI SAHASRA LINGESHWARA TEMPLE,
UPPINANGADY, PUTTUR TALUK, DAKSHINA KANNADA AND OTHERS v. STATE OF
KARNATAKA & ANOTHER2, RAI SAHIB RAM JAWAYA KAPUR AND OTHERS v. STATE OF
PUNJAB3, VIDYA MANOHARA THEERTHA (2007) 1 Kant LJ 1 AIR 1955 SC 549 SWAMIGALU,

GOVERNMENT OF TAMIL NADU AND ANOTHER6 and MEGHWAL SAMAJ SHIKSHA SAMITI
v. LAKH SINGH AND OTHERS7.
16. On the other hand, learned Senior Counsel for respondent Nos.1 and 2 submitted that Section
1(4) of the Act specifically excludes Maths from the purview of the Act and therefore, the petitioners
cannot seek a direction to the State of Karnataka to exercise its executive power to regulate the
Maths in question. It is also urged that the fact of filing of the (2013) 2 Kant LJ 466
MANU/TN/1546/2012 (2016) 2 SCC 725 (2011) 11 SCC 800 petition under Section 92 of the CPC
has been suppressed by the petitioners. It is also pointed out that another petition filed under
Section 92 of the CPC by two devotees has been dismissed on 17.10.2017. It is also pointed out that
in respect of an offence under Section 376, respondent No.1 has already been discharged whereas, in
respect of another complaint pertaining to suicide, a Bench of this Court granted stay. It is also
urged that there is no element of public interest involved in the petition and the petition has been
filed out of vengeance against respondent Nos.1 and 2.
17. In support of aforesaid submissions, reliance has been placed on the decisions in the cases of
B.N.NAGARAJAN AND OTHERS v. STATE OF MYSORE AND OTHERS8, ACCOUNTANT
GENERAL, STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH v. S.K.DUBEY AND AIR 1966 SC 1942 ANOTHER9,
HOPE TEXTILES LTD AND ANOTHER v. UNION OF INDIA AND OTHERS10 and VIVEK
KRISHNA vs UNION OF INDIA AND OTHERS11.
18. Learned Additional Advocate General submitted that no representation has been submitted to
the State Government and the State Legislature has consciously omitted the Maths from the purview
of the Act. It is also urged that in order to seek a writ of mandamus, a legal right in corresponding
legal duty has to be demonstrated. The petitioners have failed to point out any such legal right. It is
also urged that court cannot compel an authority to act contrary to the statutory provisions and
cannot direct the State to enact a law. The writ petition is liable to be dismissed. In support of
aforesaid submissions, reliance has been placed on decisions in B.N.NAGARAJAN AND OTHERS
VS. STATE OF (2012) 4 SCC 578 1995 SUPP (3) SCC 199 MYSORE AND OTHERS12,
ACCOUNTANT GENERAL, STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH v. S.K.DUBEY AND ANOTHER13,

19. We have considered the submissions made by learned counsel for the parties and have perused
the records. The 1997 Act was struck down by a division bench of this Court in W.A. No.3440/2005.
In Civil Appeal No.5924/2008, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has stayed the operation of the
judgment of the Division Bench of this Court and has permitted to enforce the provisions of the Act,
except provision of Section 25 of 1997. The State Government thereafter constituted a High Level
2022 SCC ONLINE SC 1040 AIR 1966 SC 1942 (2012) 4 SCC 578 (1995) SUPP (3) SCC 199 2022
SCC ONLINE SC 1040 Committee to examine the implementation of the judgment and the issue in
detail. The said High Level Committee submitted its report and on consideration of the report, the
State Government amended the 1997 Act by an Act No.27 of 2011. The 1997 Act does not apply to the
provisions of the Maths. There is a conscious omission on the part of the Legislature in keeping the
Maths out of the purview of the Act, which is also evident from statement of objects and reasons of
Karnataka Act No.27 of 2011 namely the Amendment Act. The relevant extract of the statement of
objects and reasons reads as under:
"The Government had constituted a high level committee to examine the implication of the
judgment and the issue in detail.
The High Level Committee had
submitted its report. Having
considered the report of the High Level Committee and the directions of the Supreme Court, it is
considered necessary to amend the Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable
Endowments Act, 1997 for the following, namely:-
(1) The maths and temples attached to the maths are kept out of the purview of the Act, as the maths
are headed and managed by mathadipathis."
Thus, the legislative intention to exclude the Maths is manifest from the statement of objects and
reasons of the Amendment Act.
20. The hall mark of our Constitution is to build a society to attain justice and erase inequities
flowing from religion, gender, caste and privileges. In this background, Articles 25 to 30 are
incorporated in the Constitution. Article 25(1) of the Constitution guarantees the freedom of
conscience, the right to freely profess, practice and propagate religion subject to public order,
morality and health. Article 26 confers the right to establish institution for religious or charitable
purpose and to maintain its own affairs in the matter of religion, on every religious denomination,
subject to public order, morality and health. Article 26 of the Constitution reads as under:
"26. Freedom to manage religious affairs subject to public order, morality and health,
every religious denomination or any section thereof shall have the right:
(a) to establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes;
(b) to manage its own affairs in matters of religion;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/176896112/ 9
Sri. Edurkala Ishwara Bhat vs Sri. Raghaveshwara Bharathi Swamiji on 29 September, 2022
(c) to own and acquire movable and immovable property; and
(d) to administer such property in accordance with law."
The scope and ambit of Article 26 was considered by a seven Judge Bench of Supreme Court in THE
COMMISSIONER, HINDU RELIGIOUS ENDOWMENTS MADRAS v. SRI LAKSHMINDRA
THIRTHA SWAMIAR OF SRI SHIRUR MUTT16 and it has been held that Article 26 contemplates
not merely a religious denomination but also a section thereof, the Math or the spiritual fraternity
represented by it can legitimate the come within the purview of Article
26. Therefore, a Math is entitled to protection of Article 26 of the Constitution of India.
21. It is trite law that power under Article 162 of the Constitution of India is co-terminus with
legislative power and in the absence of any statutory provision, power under Article 162 of the
Constitution of India can be exercised. It is equally well settled legal proposition that if there is an
alternative remedy, AIR 1954 SC 282 jurisdiction of this Court under Article 226 of the Constitution
of India shall not ordinarily be exercised specially in a case where right is created by the statute
which itself provides for a remedy. In such a case, an aggrieved person should resort to the remedy
provided to him under the statute. [See: RADHA KRISHNA INDUSTRIES VS. STATE OF HP17].
22. The scope of a public interest litigation in relation to religious institutions in respect of which a
particular legislation provides for a mechanism for adjudication of the disputes has been dealt with
by Hon'ble Supreme Court in JAIPUR SHAHAR HINDU VIKAS SAMITHI v. STATE OF
RAJASTHAN & OTHERS18. Para 47 and relevant extract of para 48 of the aforesaid judgment,
which is relevant for the purpose of controversy involved in this appeal, reads as under:
(2021) 6 SCC 771 (2014) 5 SCC 530 "47. The scope of Public Interest Litigation is very
limited, particularly, in the matter of religious institutions.
It is always better not to entertain this type of Public Interest Litigations simply on the basis of
affidavits of the parties. The public trusts and religious institutions are governed by particular
legislation which provide for a proper mechanism for adjudication of disputes relating to the
properties of the trust and their management thereof. It is not proper for the Court to entertain such
litigation and pass orders. It is also needless to mention that the forums cannot be misused by the
rival groups in the guise of public interest litigation.
48. We feel that it is apt to quote the views expressed by this Court in Guruvayoor Devaswom
Managing Committee (supra) wherein this Court observed :
"It is possible to contend that the Hindus in general and the devotees visiting the
temple in particular are interested in proper management of the temple at the hands
of the statutory functionaries. That may be so but the Act is a self- contained Code.
Duties and functions are prescribed in the Act and the rules framed thereunder.
Forums have been created thereunder for ventilation of the grievances of the affected
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/176896112/ 10
Sri. Edurkala Ishwara Bhat vs Sri. Raghaveshwara Bharathi Swamiji on 29 September, 2022
persons. Ordinarily, therefore, such forums should be moved at the first instance.
The State should be asked to look into the grievances of the aggrieved devotees, both
as parens patriae as also in discharge of its statutory duties.
... ... ... The Court should be
circumspect in entertaining such
public interest litigation for another reason. There may be dispute amongst the
devotees as to what practices should be followed by the temple authorities. There
may be dispute as regard the rites and rituals to be performed in the temple or
omission thereof. Any decision in favour of one sector of the people may heart the
sentiments of the other. The Courts normally, thus, at the first instance would not
enter into such disputed arena, particularly, when by reason thereof the fundamental
right of a group of devotees under Articles 25 and 26 may be infringed. Like any other
wing of the State, the Courts also while passing an order should ensure that the
fundamental rights of a group of citizens under Articles 25 and 26 are not infringed.
Such care and caution on the part of the High Court would be a welcome step."
23. Now, we proceed to examine whether in the obtaining factual matrix, a case has been made out
in exercise of extraordinary discretionary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India,
to issue a writ of mandamus to direct the State Government to frame a scheme to regulate the affairs
of respondent No.2 Math.
24. The respondent No.1 has been appointed as mathadipathi of respondent No.2 trust on
18.04.1999. Thereafter, since the year 2014, there has been successive attempts to remove
respondent No.1 from the office of mathadipathi / mahant. On 26.08.2014, a complaint was lodged
by one Smt. Premalatha, which resulted in lodging of first information report against respondent
No.1. By an order dated 31.03.2016, the respondent No.1 was discharged in respect of aforesaid
offence. The said order has been affirmed by a learned Single Judge of this Court by an order dated
29.12.2021 in Criminal Petition No.638/2016 and Criminal Petition No.550/2016.
25. One T.T. Hegde on or about 18.03.2016 filed a petition under Section 92 of the Code of Civil
Procedure which was dismissed on 30.11.2017. Another petition was filed by two of the devotees,
namely Prashanth Kumar L.B. and Lokesh .N under Section 92 of the Code of Civil Procedure which
was dismissed by an order dated 17.10.2017. Similarly, in respect of offence of suicide, proceeding
has been stayed by a bench of this Court and the matter is subjudice.
26. In the peculiar fact situation of the case, this Court is not inclined to exercise the extraordinary
jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India and to issue a writ of mandamus to direct
the State Government to exercise its power under Article 162 of the Constitution of India, to frame a
scheme for administration of the Maths. The Legislature has expressly excluded the Maths and
Temples attached to the Maths, as they are headed and managed by mathadipathis. In any case, the
petitioners have an alternative efficacious remedy under Section 92 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
Therefore, we are not inclined to exercise the extraordinary discretionary jurisdiction under Article
226 of the Constitution of India, and therefore, writ petition is held to be not maintainable.

Sri. Edurkala Ishwara Bhat vs Sri. Raghaveshwara Bharathi Swamiji on 29 September, 2022
27. In view of aforesaid conclusion recorded by us, no orders are necessary to be passed on
I.A.No.2/2016, an application seeking recall of the order dated 24.04.2003, by which the petitioner
was permitted to submit a representation to Chief Secretary, Government of Karnataka.
In view of preceding analysis, we do not find any merit in the writ petition. However, liberty is
reserved to the petitioners to take recourse to the remedy provided under Section 92 of the Code.
In view of disposal of the main petition itself, pending I.As do not survive for consideration, the
same stand disposed of. The interim order stands vacated.
With the aforesaid liberty, the petition is disposed of.
