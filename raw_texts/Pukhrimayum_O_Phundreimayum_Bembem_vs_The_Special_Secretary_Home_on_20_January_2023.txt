W.P. (C) No. 48 of 2022 Page 1
ORDER (ORAL)
Sanjay Kumar (C.J.):
[1] The petitioner assails the order dated 04.10.2022 of the Special Secretary (Home),
Government of Manipur, whereby she was subjected to preventive detention in
exercise of power under Section 3(1) of the Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic
Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1988. She seeks a consequential writ of
habeas corpus to set her at liberty forthwith. [2] Heard Mr. S. Jibon, learned counsel
for the petitioner; Mr. Th. Vashum, learned Government Advocate, appearing for
respondents No. 1, 2 & 4; and Mr. S. Vijayanand Sharma, learned Sr. PCCG,
appearing for respondent No. 3. [3] The primary ground of challenge urged by Mr. S.
Jibon, learned counsel, is that there is unexplained delay in dealing with the
petitioner's representation dated 19.10.2022 made against her detention. The said
representation was admittedly rejected by the State Government only on 11.11.2022.
The affidavit-in-opposition filed by the Deputy Secretary (Home), Government of
Manipur, reflects that the said representation was forwarded by the Inspector
General of Prisons, Manipur, on 20.10.2022 and was rejected on 11.11.2022 after
considering the comments received from the Police Department.
According to the Deputy Secretary (Home), Government of Manipur, the delay in disposal of the
representation was due to the high volume of proposals received and other routine works of the
Department.
[4] Perusal of the file of the detaining authority produced by Mr. Th. Vashum, learned Government
Advocate, reflects as follows:
The Special Secretary (Home), Government of Manipur, received the petitioner's
representation on 20.10.2022, the very same day that the Inspector W.P. (C) No. 48
of 2022 Page 2 General of Prisons, Manipur, forwarded it. Para-wise comments were
called for from the Director General of Police, Manipur, on the said representation by
the Deputy Secretary (Home), Government of Manipur, on the very next day, viz.,
21.10.2022. Though the response received from the Police Department is not found
in the file, the Note-file reflects that the Superintendent of Police, Thoubal District,
furnished his para-wise comments on the petitioner's representation under his letter
dated 24.10.2022. Despite the same, the matter was kept pending till 11.11.2022
when the State Government rejected the representation and the same was
communicated to the petitioner by the Deputy Secretary (Home), Government of
Manipur, under letter dated 11.11.2022.
[5] Trite to state the liberty of an individual is at stake when he or she is subjected to preventive
detention and the Constitutional scheme guarantees such person the right to have his/her
representation considered without delay, as such person is deprived of personal freedom without

Pukhrimayum (O) Phundreimayum Bembem @ ... vs The Special Secretary (Home) on 20 January, 2023
following the ordinary procedures laid down by law. When a concerted and dedicated effort is
launched by the State Government to arrest the menace of illicit drug-trafficking in the State of
Manipur, leading to a plethora of preventive detention orders being issued, it is not open to the
Home Department to put forth the volume of work generated in that regard as an excuse to explain
the delay on its part in dealing with the detenu's representation. Having created the volume of work
by its own actions, the State Government must necessarily equip itself with sufficient personnel and
infrastructure to ensure that there are no delays or shortcomings in the processing of the files in
relation to such detention orders.
[6] Be it noted that in Rajammal vs. State of T.N. and another [(1999) 1 SCC 417], the Supreme
Court observed that if delay is caused in consideration of the detenu's representation owing to
indifference or any other W.P. (C) No. 48 of 2022 Page 3 lapse, such delay would adversely affect
further detention of the prisoner. According to the Supreme Court, it is for the authority concerned
to explain the delay, if any, in disposing of the representation and it is not enough to say that the
delay is very short, as even longer delay can as well be explained and so, the test is not the duration
or range of delay, but how it is explained by the authority concerned. The unexplained delay in that
case was a mere 5 days. [7] Earlier, in Professor Khaidem Ibocha Singh vs. The State of Manipur
[AIR 1972 Supreme Court 438], the Supreme Court set aside an order of detention on the ground
that there was unexplained delay of 17 days in the passing of an order on the representation made by
the detenu. [8] More recently, in Sarabjeet Singh Mokha vs. The District Magistrate, Jabalpur, and
others [(Criminal Appeal No. 1301 of 2021, decided on 29.10.2021 = 2021 SCC OnLine SC 1019], the
Supreme Court held that by delaying a decision on such representation, the State Government
denied the detenu a valuable statutory right. The Supreme Court observed that the delay by the State
Government in disposing of such representation strikes at the heart of the procedural rights and
guarantees granted to a detenu. [9] Though it is laudable that the Government of Manipur is waging
a 'war on drugs' and initiating stringent measures to arrest the menace of illicit drug manufacture,
trafficking and marketing in and through the State of Manipur, it is equally its responsibility to
ensure that procedural safeguards are taken note of strictly so as to protect the Constitutional and
statutory rights of persons detained under preventive detention laws. Despite this Court stating to
this effect time and again, scant regard is shown by the authorities concerned to compliance with the
prescribed norms.
W.P. (C) No. 48 of 2022 Page 4
[10] The unexplained lethargy on the part of the State authorities in
dealing with the detenu's representation clearly indicates a lackadaisical and casual approach on
their part, which is inimical to the mandatory legal requirements in a matter of this nature. The
same would also be fatal to the very validity and continuance of the impugned detention order.
[11] The order of detention dated 04.10.2022 issued by the Special Secretary (Home), Government
of Manipur, is accordingly set aside. All consequential proceedings based thereon shall also stand
set aside. The petitioner, Pukhrimayum (O) Phundreimayum Bembem @ Sahara, presently
incarcerated in Manipur Central Jail, Imphal, shall be set at liberty forthwith unless her continued
incarceration is validly required in connection with any other case.

Pukhrimayum (O) Phundreimayum Bembem @ ... vs The Special Secretary (Home) on 20 January, 2023
WP (Cril.) No. 48 of 2022 is accordingly allowed.
In the circumstances, there shall be no order as to costs. A copy of this order shall be sent to the
Chief Secretary, Government of Manipur, for information and necessary further action in the
context of educating the detaining authorities in the State of Manipur as to what are the procedural
norms that they need to adhere to while exercising power and jurisdiction under preventive
detention laws.
