Counsel for Respondent :- C.S.C.
Hon'ble Piyush Agrawal,J.
1. Heard SriVinay Kumar Mishra, learned counsel for the petitioner and Sri A.C. Mishra, learned
Additional Chief Standing Counsel for the State-respondents.

(respondent no.2) as well as the order dated 31.08.2017 passed by Assistant Commissioner

the same, proceedings under the provisions of Indian Stamp Act were initiated and a notice was
issued to the petitioner to which a detailed reply/objection was filed by the petitioner, specifically
stating therein that the land in question has not been declared as an abadi land under the provision
of Section 143 of UPZA & LR Act. In the meantime, an undated subsequent report was prepared by
the Sub-Registrar, Manth, District- Mathura, treating the land to be an abadi land and on the basis
of said allegations so made in the subsequent report, an impugned order dated 31.08.2017 was
passed, holding the deficiency of stamp duty along with interest and penalty. Against the said order,
revision was preferred, which has been dismissed vide order dated 18.09.2017. Hence, this writ
petition.
4. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that after four years from the date of execution of the
sale deed, subsequent survey was conducted, on the basis of which, the impugned order has been
passed. He further submits that however, the specific ground was taken in the reply/objection that
the land in question has not been declared as an abadi land under the provision of Section 143 UPZA
& LR Act, no weigthage has been given to the same and the impugned order has been passed.
5. He next submits that after four years for the date of execution of the sale deed, the proceedings
initiated under the provision of Indian Stamp Act are bad.
6. Per contra, learned ACSC supports the impugned orders.
7. After hearing learned counsel for the parties, the Court has perused the record.
8. It is not in dispute that the petitioner purchased the land in question as an agricultural land after
paying the requisite stamp duty, but on the basis of subsequent survey report, the proceedings were
initiated against the petitioner. The first show cause notice issued to the petitioner was specifically
replied by stating therein that the land in question has not been declared as an abadi land under the
provision of Section 143 of UPZA & LR Act. Once the land in question has not been declared as an
abadi land under the provision of Section 143 of UPZA & LR Act, the proceedings initiated against
the petitioner cannot be said to be legal.
9. The issue in hand is no longer res-integra as this Court in Writ- C No. 19644 of 2016 (Raj Kumar
Vs. State of U.P. and 2 others) in no. 16 & 20 has held as under:-
"16. In view of the definition of land contained in the law relating to land tenures, i.e.
U.P. Zamindari Abolition & Land Reforms Act, 1950, the fact that the land was not
declared as Abadi under section 143 of U.P. Zamindari Abolition & Land Reforms
Act, 1950 as explained under section 3(14) of the said Act, in itself becomes a relevant
factor for determining the nature of land that was subject matter of instrument. This
Court in various authorities has held that when the land is purchased for agricultural
purposes and declaration under section 143 of the U.P. Z.A. & L.R.Act, 1950 has not
been made and merely because the land is situated in close vicinity of the
non-agricultural land, the same would not loose its character as the agricultural land
for the purposes of levy of stamp duty. Reference can be made to few authorities of

this Court in the case of Aniruddha Kumar and Ashwini Kumar vs Chief Controlling
Revenue Authority, U.P. Allahabad and another, reported in 2000 (3) AWC 2587;
Smt. Sushila Verma vs State of U.P. and others reported in 2006 (2) AWC 1492 and

20. Insofar as the imposing four times penalty is concerned, it is well settled that
unless "mens rea" is established on the part of the purchaser, no penalty can be
imposed, even if the provision of penalty is a creation of statute. Regarding
imposition of penalty, reference can be made to a judgment of this Court in the case
of Smt. Asha Kapoor vs Additional Collector (Finance & Revenue), Ghaziabad and
others, reported in 2008 (72) ALR 125, where this Court has held that penalty can be
imposed if there is an attempt to evade the stamp duty and penalty presupposes
culpability and an intention to conceal or to play fraud with the authorities. I do not
find any finding on record, whereunder any opinion has been formed by the
respondent-Authorities that the petitioner defrauded the Government having mens
rea at the time of getting the sale deed executed. Even the annexures to the writ
petition disclosing the nature of land have not been disputed by the State in the
counter affidavit. I also find that the sale deed in question conforms to the statutory
requirements of disclosure of necessary particulars as per rule 3(1)(a) of the Rules of
1997. Therefore, imposition of penalty is also contrary to law of the land."
10. In view of the aforesaid facts & circumstances of the case as well as the law laid down by this
Court, the impugned orders cannot be sustained in the eyes of law. The same are hereby quashed.
11. The writ petition succeeds and is allowed.
12. The authority concerned is directed to refund any amount deposited by the petitioner pursuant
to the impugned orders, within a period of one month from the date of production of a certified copy
of this order.
