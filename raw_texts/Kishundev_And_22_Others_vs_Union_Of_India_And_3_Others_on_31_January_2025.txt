Kishundev And 22 Others vs Union Of India And 3 Others on 31 January, 2025
"i. To issue a writ, order or direction in the nature of mandamus commanding the
respondents to maintain the status quo in respect of the petitioners' part of land in
plot no. 170 area 0.120 Hect. and 172 area 0.082 situated at Revenue
Village-Jamunipur Bad Faros, Pargana, Tehsil and District Bahadohi.
ii. To issue a writ, order or direction in the nature of certiorari quashing the
impugned award dated 28.11.2023 also for the mandamus commanding the
respondents not to interefere over petitioners' part of land in plot no. 170 area 0.120
Hect. and 172 area 0.082 situated at Revenue Village-Jamunipur Bad Faros,
Paragana, Tehsil and District Bhadohi."
3. It is not disputed that the subject land was acquired under the provisions of the National
Highways Act, 1956 for widening of a National Highway by PWD, Varanasi. The notification was
issued by the Central Government as per the provisions of the Act.
4. Sri Pankaj Dubey, learned counsel for the petitioners submits that when any land is acquired for
PWD, it should be under the Right to Fair Compensation And Transparency in Land Acquisition,
Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 and notification for the said purpose has to be issued by
the State Government.
5. The argument is thoroughly misconceived. It is not disputed before us that the highway of which
widening is to be done, is a 'National Highway'. Section 3A of the Act, 1956 provides that where any
land is required for the building, maintenance, management or operation of a national highway or
part thereof, the same may be acquired by the Central Government by issuing notification declaring
its intent under Section 3A followed by declaration under Section 3D. There is no interdiction that
in case the widening or construction of public highway is by PWD, it cannot take recourse to the
provisions of the National Highways Act, 1956 and has to apply for acquisition under the Right to
Fair Compensation And Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act,
2013.
6. The petition lacks merit and is accordingly, dismissed.
