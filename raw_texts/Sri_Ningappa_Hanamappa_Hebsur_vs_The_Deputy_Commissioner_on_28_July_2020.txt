THIS WRIT PETITION IS FILED UNDER ARTICLES 226
AND 227 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA PRAYING TO
QUASH THE ORDER PRODUCED AT ANNEXURE-G PASSED BY
RESPONDENT NO.1/DISTRICT COMMISSIONER, GADAG
DATED 12.12.2008 BEARING NO.RTS/RA/SR-25/2016-18
AND THE ORDER PRODUCED AT ANNEXURE-F PASSED BY
RESPONDENT NO.2/ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER GADAG
DATED 24.01.2017 BEARING NO.RTS/A.P./59/2014-15.
THIS PETITION COMING ON FOR PRELIMINARY
HEARING THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:
:4:
ORDER
1. The petitioners are before this Court seeking for a certiorari to quash the order dated 12.12.2018
passed by the respondent No.1 - Deputy Commissioner as also the order dated 24.01.2017. passed by
the respondent No.2 - Assistant Commissioner.
2. The case of the petitioners is that;
2.1 The father of the petitioners was cultivating Revenue Survey No.479 measuring 17 acres 18
guntas. However, his brothers got the said survey number bifurcated as if there was a partition in
the family. This having been done behind the back of their father Hanamappa, after coming into
force of the Land Reforms Act, the said Hanamappa filed Form No.7 for the entire land. The
brothers of Hanamappa also filed similar Form No.7 for the entire land. The Land Tribunal by its
order dated 18.11.1987 partly granted occupancy certificate in favour of the said Hanamappa and
partly in favour of his brothers. 2.2 The said order came to be challenged before this Court in
W.P.No.36993/2000, which came to be settled between the parties out of the Court and this Court
recorded the same in its order dated 10.01.2006 and at the instance of the said Hanamappa, the said
writ petition came to be dismissed as settled out of the Court.

Sri.Ningappa Hanamappa Hebsur vs The Deputy Commissioner on 28 July, 2020
2.3 The claim of settlement out of the Court is on the basis of 'Duristi Watni Patra' executed between
Hanamappa and his brothers. 2.4 On the basis of the said order of this Court, the petitioners, who
are the legal heirs of Hanamappa, filed an application before respondent No.3 to enter their names
in respect of the land bearing Revenue Survey No.479. After issuance of notice, the names so were
entered vide order dated 30.06.2014. 2.5 This order came to be challenged by respondents No.4 to
16, who are the children of the brothers of Hanamappa.
2.6 On the said challenge being made under Section 136(2) of the Karnataka Land Revenue Act, the
mutation entry made in favour of the petitioners was cancelled, which order was challenged by the
petitioners in an appeal under Section 136(3) of the Karnataka Land Revenue Act before respondent
No.1 - Deputy Commissioner, who has also dismissed the said appeal by his order dated 12.12.2018.
2.7 It is these two orders that the petitioners have assailed in the present writ petition.
3. Sri. Neelendra Gunde, learned counsel for the petitioners would submit that initially respondent
No.2 and subsequently respondent No.1 ought to have taken into consideration the settlement
arrived at between Hanamappa and his brothers vide 'Duristi Watni Patra' and make necessary
entries in the revenue records in favour of the petitioners.
4. Heard Sri. Neelendra Gunde and perused the papers.
5. A perusal of the papers indicates that the order in Writ Petition No.36993/2000, which forms the
very basis of so called settlement between Hanamappa and his brothers, is an unilateral settlement
in the sense that such proceedings had already been abated against respondents No.1 and 2 i.e.,
brothers of Hanamappa and in fact the said petition was dismissed as against those respondents on
account of the petitioners not taking steps insofar as deceased respondents No.1 and 2 are
concerned in those proceedings.
6. On a recall application being filed, it is the petitioners, who made an unilateral submission that
the matter has been settled out of Court and recording the same this Court recalled the order of
dismissal and thereafter dismissed the writ petition as settled out of the Court.
7. The said order cannot give rise to a claim on the part of the petitioners to contend that the matter
has been settled out of Court on the basis of 'Duristi Watni Patra' which is neither stamped nor
registered nor accepted by any authority or Court and thereby seek for mutation entries to be made
in their favour.
8. In view of the same, I find that the orders passed by respondents No.1 and 2 are proper and
correct.
9. The petition is dismissed at the stage of admission itself reserving liberty to the petitioners to
approach the competent Civil Court to agitate their case.
