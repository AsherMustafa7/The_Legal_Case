3. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the present writ petition has been filed
seeking quashing of the impugned FIR and stay on further investigation based on a compromise
reached between the parties. The learned counsel for the petitioner contends that on 04.04.2025,
with the intervention of respected members of society, all disputes between the contesting parties
have been amicably settled and a compromise deed has been executed. It is submitted that both
parties have buried their differences and no dispute now remains between them, rendering the
continuation of criminal proceedings futile. The learned counsel for the petitioner further
emphasizes that no useful purpose would be served by allowing the case to proceed as the chances of
conviction have become remote in light of the compromise. It is also submitted that the
investigation is still pending, and no charge sheet has been filed till date. The learned counsel for the
petitioner relies on the ratio of the various Supreme Court's decisions, which support the quashing
of criminal proceedings based on compromise between parties. The learned counsel for the
petitioner therefore prays that considering the compromise between parties and the settled legal
position, this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to quash the impugned FIR.
4. Sri G.P. Singh, learned AGA-1 for the State-respondents on the strength of counter affidavit states
that the matter has been settled amicably on the basis of compromise dated 04.04.2025 and he has
no objection in case the impugned FIR is quashed. A counter affidavit has now been filed on behalf
of the State, wherein it has been clearly affirmed that no useful purpose would be served in
permitting the case to continue as the chances of conviction are anyway bleak in the light of the
compromise.
5. Learned counsel for the parties, in one voice, have submitted that the dispute arose from a
personal misunderstanding and has since been resolved amicably through the aforementioned
settlement agreement. It is their collective submission that the continuation of criminal proceedings
in such a scenario would serve no meaningful purpose and would, in fact, amount to misuse of the
legal process. In support of this contention, reliance has been placed on the judgments of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in B.S. Joshi v. State of Haryana (2003) 4 SCC 675, Gian Singh v. State of
Punjab (2012) 10 SCC 303, and the decision of this Court in Anuj Pandey v. State of U.P. (Criminal
Misc. Writ Petition No. 8510 of 2022, decided on 16.09.2022).
6. This Court has carefully considered the submissions of the learned counsels, perused the
pleadings, and examined the legal principles enunciated by the Hon'ble Apex Court. In Gian Singh
(supra), the Supreme Court categorically held that the High Court, while exercising its inherent
powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C., is not bound by the provisions of Section 320 Cr.P.C. and may
quash criminal proceedings in appropriate cases, especially where the offence is private in nature
and does not involve any element of public harm or societal concern.
7. The Hon'ble Supreme Court further observed that in cases arising out of matrimonial disputes,
civil transactions, financial dealings, and other matters where the dispute is essentially personal and
does not affect public interest, the Court should adopt a pragmatic and restorative approach,
prioritizing reconciliation and restoration of peace over punitive proceedings. However, the Court
also drew a clear line that such power should not be exercised in cases involving heinous offences or
crimes with grave impact on society.

8. In the present case, it is evident from the record that the parties have expressed genuine
willingness to put an end to their discord and have entered into a written compromise duly verified
before the appropriate forum. There is no allegation of coercion, deceit, or fraud in the execution of
the compromise.
9. Moreover, the renowned Latin maxim Interest Reipublicae Ut Sit Finis Litium ? meaning "it is in
the interest of the State that there should be an end to litigation" ? aptly underscores the necessity of
finality in legal proceedings. This principle was emphatically upheld by this Court in Anuj Pandey v.
State of U.P., reaffirming that precious judicial time and investigative resources must not be wasted
on cases that have lost their adversarial essence and where the likelihood of conviction is minimal. It
has been rightly emphasized that the justice delivery system should prioritize matters of substantive
public importance rather than being mired in private disputes that no longer present any genuine
grievance.
10. In view of the aforementioned facts, legal position, and the spirit of reconciliation demonstrated
by the parties, this Court is of the firm view that the ends of justice would be met by quashing the
proceedings, thereby preserving judicial resources and preventing unnecessary hardship to the
parties.
11. Accordingly, the writ petition stands allowed. The FIR dated03.03.2025 registered as Case Crime
No.23 of 2025, under Sections 406, 268, 269, 506 I.P.C., Police Station Galsahid, District
Moradabad, along with all proceedings emanating therefrom, is hereby quashed.
12. The interim protection granted to the petitioners, vide earlier orders of this Court, stands
confirmed.
13. There shall be no order as to costs.
Order Date :- 30.4.2025 NLY
