of 2023/ 2349 of 2024 arising out of Jandaha P.S. Case No. 277
of 2018 (GR 6261 of 2018), whereby charges have been framed
under Sections 498A, 341, 323, 34 of the Indian Penal Code
against the petitioners, as well as, the order dated 07.05.2024
passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Vaishali at Hajipur in Cr.
Rev. No. 272 of 2023 by which the revision filed against the
order dated 23.01.2023 passed by the learned S.D.J.M., Civil
Court Vaishali at Hajipur was rejected on the ground that the
charges have already framed on 08.05.2023.
3. The allegation is of subjecting the informant -
opposite party no.2 to various sorts of torture due to non-
fulfillment of the demand of the dowry.
4. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
petitioners submitted that petitioners no. 1 and 3 are sister-in-
law and petitioners no. 2 and 4 are brother-in-law of the
opposite party no. 2, who is the wife of accused Kumar Gourav
@ Vickki Singh, and petitioner no. 5 is the mother-in-law of the
opposite party no. 2. Learned counsel submitted that petitioners
no. 1 to 4 reside separately and they have no concern with the
the affairs of the opposite party no.2 and her husband and just
because petitioners no. 1 and 3 are own sister of the husband of
the opposite party no. 2, they have been roped in a false case on

Rintu Devi vs The State Of Bihar on 13 October, 2025
the basis of false allegation along with their husband (petitioners
no. 3 and 4). So far as petitioner no. 5 is concerned, learned
counsel submitted that she is posted as Police Inspector at
Hazaribagh and she also has no concern with the strained
matrimonial relationship between her son and daughter-in-law
(opposite party no.2). He further submitted that a specific
statement has been made in paragraph no. 11 of the application
that petitioner no. 5 is providing money and maintaining the two
sons of the informant (opposite party no. 2) and her son (Kumar
Gourav @ Vickki Singh). The opposite party no. 2 is residing
along with her husband at Deoghar and in this regard, he has
made a specific statement in paragraph no. 9 of the present
quashing application but the petitioners are facing criminal
prosecution, which amounts to vexatious and continuing with
the same will lead to abuse of process of law.
5. Per contra, learned counsel appearing on behalf of
the opposite party no. 2 submitted that the petitioners have
given wrong information in paragraphs no. 9 and 11 of the
application that opposite party no. 2 is residing along with her
husband ( Kumar Gourav @ Vickki Singh) at Deoghar and
petitioner no. 5 is providing money and maintaining the two
sons of the informant (opposite party no. 2) and her son (Kumar

criminal prosecution.
6. Learned A.P.P. appearing on behalf of the State
submitted that no interference can be made by this Court,
considering the allegations made in the FIR. The complicity of
the petitioners in subjecting the opposite party no. 2 of various
sorts of torture cannot be denied.
7. Heard the parties.
8. Having considered the rival submissions made on
behalf of the parties, as well as, having considered the nature of
allegation made against petitioners no. 1 to 4, I find that from
the very perusal of the FIR, it appears that the petitioners no. 1
and 3 are sister-in-law of opposite party no. 2 and petitioners no.
2 and 4 are brother-in-law of the opposite party no. 2 and they
reside at another place and it appears that without mentioning
the above facts, only allegation has been made in the FIR that
they have subjected the opposite party no. 2 to cruelty for non
fulfillment of demand of dowry. It is commonly seen in the
society that the entire family members, as well as, relatives are
made accused along with the husband to face criminal
prosecution.
9. The law in respect of matrimonial dispute between
Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.68154 of 2024 dt.13-10-2025
5/14
husband and wife is well settled at the same time, the Apex
Court has held that the family members of husband should not
be roped unnecessarily.

Rintu Devi vs The State Of Bihar on 13 October, 2025
10. It is commonly seen in the society that the entire
family members, as well as, relatives are made accused along
with the husband to face criminal prosecution. The Apex Court
has demarcated the manner in which the complaints are
entertained by the learned District Court. The Apex Court in
case of Naushey Ali & Ors. Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh & Anr.
reported in (2025) 4 SCC 78, considering the entirety of
matters, particularly dealing with the misuse of Section 498 of
IPC, referring to its earlier judgment, finally concluded that
offences arising out of matrimonial dispute particularly relating
to dowry etc. or a family dispute where wrong is committed to
the victim by the offenders and his family, can be settled
amicably and also in light of the recent judgment of Apex Court
in the case of Navneesh Aggarwal & Ors. v. State of Haryana
& Anr. reported in 2025 INSC 963, I find that no case under
Section 498A of IPC is made out against petitioner nos. 1 to 4.
Accordingly, the entire proceeding including the order dated
08.05.2023
passed by SDJM, Vaishali at Hajipur and the order dated 07.05.2024 passed by the learned Sessions
Judge, Vaishali Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.68154 of 2024 dt.13-10-2025 at Hajipur are hereby
set aside and quashed to the extent it relates to petitioners no. 1 to 4.
11. So far as the petitioner no. 5 is concerned, the Marriage of opposite party no. 2 had taken place in
the year 2007 with the son of the petitioner no. 5 and out of the said wedlock, they have been
blessed with two sons. The petitioner no. 5 being grand mother of the two sons has given
information in paragraph no. 11 of the application that she is taking care of the two children and she
is also providing monetary help for their proper growth. However, the said information has been
objected by learned counsel appearing on behalf of the opposite party no. 2. This Court finds that
petitioner no. 5, who is a government officer, must discharge her responsibility to settle the strained
matrimonial relationship between her son and daughter-in-law and it is expected from petitioner
no. 5 and opposite party no. 2 that they will arrive at a mutual agreement taking into consideration
the interest of the minor children to put an end to the litigation.

12. In peculiar facts of the case and considering the background circumstances of the welfare of the
child on the touchstone of principle of parens patriae jurisdiction as the minor is within the
jurisdiction of the Court, the Apex Court Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.68154 of 2024
dt.13-10-2025 found it in the case of Howarth v. Northcott, 152 Conn 460 that the welfare of the
child is of paramount consideration of the Court. I find it apt to reproduce the observations made by
the Apex Court in the aforesaid case, which is as under:
"In habeas corpus proceedings to determine child custody, the jurisdiction exercise
by the Court rests in such cases on its inherent equitable powers and exerts theforce
of the State, as parens patrie, for the protection of its infant ward, and the very nature
and scope of the inquiry and the result sought to be accomplished call for the exercise
of the jurisdiction of a court of equity." (emphasis supplied) It was further observed;
"The employment of the forms of habeas corpus in a child custody case is not for the
purpose of testing the legality of a confinement or restraint as contemplated by the
ancient common law writ, or by statute, but the primary purpose is to furnish a
means by which the court, in the exercise of its judicial discretion, may determine
what is best for the welfare of the child, and the decision is reached by a
consideration of the equities involved in the welfare of the child, against which the
legal rights of no one, including the parents, are allowed to militate. It was also
indicated that ordinarily, the basis for issuance of a writ of habeas corpus is an illegal
detention; but in the case of such a writ sued out for the detention of a child, the law
is concerned not so much with the illegality of the detention as with the welfare of the
child."
13. In this regard, it would be also gainful to reproduce the observation made by the Apex Court in
Mausami Moita Ganguli V. Jayant Ganguli reported in (2008)7 SCC 673 in paragraph nos. 19 to 21
and 23 to 26:
"19. The principle of law in relation to the custody of a minor child are well settled. It
is trite that while determining the question as to which parent the care and control of
a child should be committed, the first and the paramount consideration is the welfare
and interest of the child and not the rights of the parents under a statute.
Indubitably, the provisions of the law pertaining to the Patna High Court CR. MISC.
No.68154 of 2024 dt.13-10-2025 custody of a child contained in either the Guardians
and Wards Act, 1890(Section 17) or the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956
(Section 13) also hold out the welfare of the child as a predominant consideration. In
fact, no statute, on the subject, can ignore, eschew or obliterate the vital factor of the
welfare of the minor."
"20. The question of welfare of the minor child has again to be considered in the
background of the relevant facts and circumstances. Each case has to be decided on
its own facts and other decided cases can hardly serve as binding precedents in so far
as the factual aspects of the case are concerned. It is, no doubt, true that father is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/85628229/ 6
Rintu Devi vs The State Of Bihar on 13 October, 2025
presumed by the statues to be better suited to look after the welfare of the child,
being normally the working member and head of the family, yet in each case the
court has to see primarily to the welfare of the child in determining the question of
his or her custody. Better financial resources of either of the parents or their love for
the child may be one relevant considerations but cannot be the sole determining
factor for the custody of the child. It is here that a heavy duty is cast on the court to
exercise its judicial discretion judiciously in the background of all the relevant facts
and circumstance, bearing in mind the welfare of the child as the paramount
consideration."
21. In Rosy Jacob v. Jacob A. Chakramakkal reported in (1973) 1 SCC 840, a three-Judge Bench of
the Apex Court in a rather curt language had observed that the controlling factor governing the
custody of the child would be its welfare and not the rights of the parent:
"15. ... The children are not mere chattels: nor are they mere playthings for their
parents. Absolute right of the parents over the destinies and the lives of their children
has, in the modern changed social conditions, yielded to the considerations of their
welfare as human being so that they may grow up in a normal balanced manner to be
useful members of the society and the guardian court in case of a dispute between the
mother and the father, is expected to strike a just and proper balance between the
requirements of welfare of the minor children and the rights of their respective
parents over them."
"23. Having bestowed our anxious consideration to the material on record and the
observation made by the courts below, we are of the view that in the present case
there is no ground to upset the judgment and order of the High Court. There is
nothing on record to suggest that the welfare of the child is in any way in peril in the
hands of the father. In our opinion, the stability and security of the child is also
essential ingredient for a full development of child's talent and personality. As noted
above, the appellant is a teacher, now employed in a school at Panipat, where she had
shifted from Chandigarh some time back. Earlier, she was teaching in some school at
Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.68154 of 2024 dt.13-10-2025 Calcutta.
Admittedly, she is living alone. Except for a very short duration when he was with the
appellant, Master Satyajeet has been living and studying in Allahabad in a good
school and is stated to have his small group of friends there. At Panipat, it would be
an entirely new environment for him as compared to Allahabad."
"25. It is also significant to note that during the course of hearing on one of the dates,
when we had not yet interviewed Satyajeet, we had suggested that it would be better
if the child could stay with his mother for some more time. However, upon hearing
us, he started crying and whining and, showed reluctance to go with the mother."
Watching his reaction, we dropped the proposal.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/85628229/ 7
Rintu Devi vs The State Of Bihar on 13 October, 2025
"26. Under these circumstances and bearing in mind the paramount consideration of
the welfare of the child, we are convinced that the child's interest and welfare will be
best served if he continues to be in the custody of the father, In our opinion, for the
present, it is not desirable to disturb the custody of master Satyajeet and, therefore,
the order of the High Court giving his exclusive custody to the father with visitation
rights to the mother deserves to be maintained. We feel that the visitation rights to
the appellant by the High Court, as noted above, also do not require any
modification."
We, therefore, affirm the order and the afore- extracted direction given by the High Court. It will,
however, be open to the parties to move this Court for modification of this order or for seeking any
direction regarding the custody and well- being of the child, if there is any change in the
circumstances."
14. In the case of Gaurav Nagpal v. Sumedha Nagpal reported in (2009) 1 SCC 42, the Apex Court in
paragraph 50 has held as follows:-
"50. When the Court is confronted with conflicting demands made by the parents,
each time it has to justify the demands. The Court has not only to look at the issue on
legalistic basis, in such matters human angles are relevant for deciding those issues.
The Court then does not give emphasis on what the parties say, it has to exercise a
jurisdiction which is aimed at the welfare of the minor."
15. The interest of children becomes paramount. The Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.68154 of 2024
dt.13-10-2025 court has to play role of parens patriae. The petitioner no. 5 is police inspector on
whose behalf a vague statement has been made in paragraph no. 11 that she is spending certain
amount for care of the children and earning of her son (accused) is not enough. This Court finds that
petitioner no. 5 must ensure to make payment of at least Rs. 25,000/- per month in lumpsum for
the proper care and nutrition of the two children.
16. The matrimonial dispute is not an offense against the society rather a matrimonial dispute is a
private conflict between spouses and does not inherently constitute an offence against society. The
Apex Court in the case of B.S. Joshi v. State of Haryana, reported in, (2003) 4 SCC 675, in paragraph
nos. 12 and 13 has held as under:-
" 12. The special features in such matrimonial matters are evident. It becomes the
duty of the court to encourage genuine settlements of matrimonial disputes.
13. The observations made by this Court, though in a slightly different context, in
G.V. Rao v. L.H.V. Prasad [(2000) 3 SCC 693 :
2000 SCC (Cri) 733] are very apt for determining the approach required to be kept in
view in a matrimonial dispute by the courts. It was said that there has been an
outburst of matrimonial disputes in recent times. Marriage is a sacred ceremony, the

Rintu Devi vs The State Of Bihar on 13 October, 2025
main purpose of which is to enable the young couple to settle down in life and live
peacefully. But little matrimonial skirmishes suddenly erupt which often assume
serious proportions resulting in commission of heinous crimes in which elders of the
family are also involved with the result that those who could have counselled and
brought about rapprochement are rendered helpless on their being arrayed as
accused in the criminal case. There are many other reasons which need not be
mentioned here for not encouraging matrimonial Patna High Court CR. MISC.
No.68154 of 2024 dt.13-10-2025 litigation so that the parties may ponder over their
defaults and terminate their disputes amicably by mutual agreement instead of
fighting it out in a court of law where it takes years and years to conclude and in that
process the parties lose their "young" days in chasing their "cases" in different courts.
17. Recently also, the Apex Court in the case of Mange Ram Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh & Another
(Special Leave Petition (Criminal) No.10817 of 2024), in paragraph nos. 25, 31 and 32 has reiterated
that in cases, particularly, related to dowry, opportunity be given to the parties first to reconcile,
which inter alia are as follows:-
"25. This Court, in Dara Lakshmi Narayana vs. State of Telangana, (2025) 3 SCC 735,
has made it clear that family members of the husband ought not to be unnecessarily
roped into criminal proceedings arising out of matrimonial discord. The Court
observed that it has become a recurring tendency to implicate every member of the
husband's family, irrespective of their role or actual involvement, merely because a
dispute has arisen between the spouses. It was further held that where the allegations
are bereft of specific particulars, and particularly where the relatives sought to be
prosecuted are residing separately or have had no connection with the matrimonial
home, allowing the prosecution to proceed would amount to an abuse of the process
of law. The Court noted that criminal law is not to be deployed as an instrument of
harassment, and that judicial scrutiny must be exercised to guard against such
misuse.
31. We also refer to Gian Singh vs. State of Punjab, (2012) 10 SCC 303 wherein this
Court observed that where the High Court quashes a criminal proceeding having
regard to the fact that the dispute between the offender and the victim has been
settled, although the offences are not compoundable, it does so as in its opinion,
continuation of criminal proceedings will be an exercise in futility and justice Patna
High Court CR. MISC. No.68154 of 2024 dt.13-10-2025 in the case demands that the
dispute between the parties is put to an end and peace is restored, securing the ends
of justice being the ultimate guiding factor. In this regard, a specific reference was
made to offences arising out of matrimony, particularly relating to dowry, etc. or a
family dispute, where the wrong is basically to the victim but the offender and the
victim have settled all disputes between them amicably, irrespective of the fact that
such offences have not been made compoundable. The High Court may, within the
framework of its inherent power, quash the criminal proceeding or criminal
complaint or FIR if it is satisfied that on the face of such settlement, there is hardly
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/85628229/ 9
Rintu Devi vs The State Of Bihar on 13 October, 2025
any likelihood of the offender being convicted and by not quashing the criminal
proceedings, justice shall be casualty and ends of justice shall be defeated.
32. In Naushey Ali vs. State of U.P., (2025) 4 SCC 78, one of us (Viswanathan, J.)
observed in paragraph 32 that proceeding with the trial, when the parties have
amicably resolved the dispute, would be futile and the ends of justice require that the
settlement be given effect to by quashing the proceedings. It would be a grave abuse
of process particularly when the dispute is settled and resolved."
18. The petitioner no. 5, who is the mother-in-law of the the O.P. No. 2 may proceed to settle the
strained matrimonial relationship of her son and daughter-in-law (O.P. No.2) amicably, the learned
District Court shall also strive till last to settle the dispute outside the Court
19. Petitioner no. 5 along with her son and opposite party no. 2 have agreed to appear before the
learned District Court on 27.11.2025 at 10:30 AM.
20. Learned District Court is directed to take Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.68154 of 2024
dt.13-10-2025 necessary steps to issue notices to the respective parties and upon their appearance
refer the matter before the learned Mediator of the District Mediation Center.
21. Learned Mediator of the District Mediation Center concerned shall make his/her best efforts to
settle the dispute between the parties amicably and thereafter submit his/her report before the
concerned learned District Court, well within a period of four months, till then, no coercive action
shall be taken against the petitioner no. 5 in connection with the aforesaid case.
22. In case, the parties resolve their dispute amicably, then the proceeding is required to be dropped
in light of the law laid down by the Apex Court as referred hereinabove.
23. In case of failure on the part of the petitioner no. 5 to appear on 27.11.2025 before the learned
District Court or any date fixed by the learned Mediator, the interim protection granted to the
petitioner no. 5 shall automatically lose its force.
24. In case, it is deliberate on the part of the Petitioner no. 5 and she fails to reconcile, then in that
case, the learned District Court shall proceed with the trial. In case, it is deliberate on the part of the
opposite party no.2 to reconcile, then in that case, continuing with the criminal proceeding will
Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.68154 of 2024 dt.13-10-2025 amount to abuse of process of court
and the interim protection granted to petitioner no. 5 shall continue and the proceeding against her
is required to be dropped in accordance with law.
25. Accordingly, the present quashing application stands disposed of.
