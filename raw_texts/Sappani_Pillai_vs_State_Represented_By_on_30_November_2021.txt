3. For the sake of convenience and clarity, the petitioners are referred as per rank in the C.C.No.25
of 2021 before the trial Court.
4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the first petitioner/A3 viz., Vasantha/A3 is
the wife of A2/Late.Kannaiyya, who passed away on 10.06.2011, A4 is the daughter and A5 is the son
of A2/Late.Kannaiyya. A1/Sappani Pillai is the partner of Subbayya Pillai, father of the second
respondent/defacto complainant, and the said Subbayya Pillai died on 04.02.2018. The accused 2 to
4 were allotted https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.Nos.6894 & 6076 of 2021 plots by the
Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board and Plot No.114 was in the name of A2/Kannaiyya, Plot No.115
was in the name of A3/Vasantha and Plot No.116 was in the name of A4/Lakshmi Priya. For the
urgent requirements of their family, viz., expenses of the marriage of A4, A2 got introduced to
Sappani Pillai/A1, who was in construction business in the name of Ashwini constructions and he

Sappani Pillai vs State:Represented By on 30 November, 2021
agreed to help them, informed them that the properties in plots allotted to A2 to A4 can be sold for a
consideration of Rs.28 lakhs and both of them agreed and entered into a sale agreement on
02.09.2004. A1/Sappani Pillai was introduced to Subbayya Pillai, father of the second respondent,
as business associate and as per the sale agreement, the final price was fixed for a sum of
Rs.18,92,000/- and Rs.8,00,000/- was paid at that time of agreement and Rs.6,00,000/- was to be
paid within a period of one month and balance of Rs.4,92,000/- at the time of execution of the sale
deed. Further there was a written clause that after obtaining sale deed in favour of A2 to A4 from the
Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board, sale deeds to be executed, within one year thereon, further to
complete the process preferably within a period of one year. It was specifically mentioned that time
is https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.Nos.6894 & 6076 of 2021 not an essence. He further
submitted that following the same, Power of Attorney was executed by A2, A3 and A4 in favour of A1
to deal with the property. Thereafter, the Joint Power of Attorney was cancelled through
Doc.No.1611 of 2004 on 18.10.2004 which was informed to A1 by telegram. Thereafter, the marriage
between A4/Lakshmipriya with one Saminathan was conducted on 31.10.2004. Thereafter, A1
approached A2 and paid a sum of Rs.1,25,000/- for electricity connection, removal of obstructions
to the property. As per this understanding, A2 to A4 agreed to execute Power of Attorney separately
for each plots, since earlier Power of Attorney given in composite was cancelled. Thereafter, A2
executed the Power of Attorney in Doc.No.1922 of 2004 on 15.10.2004, A3 in Doc.No.1924 of 2004
and A4 in Doc.No.1923 of 2004 on 15.12.2004. Later on the demise of A2 on 10.06.2011, a fresh
Power of Attorney in Doc.No.782 of 2015 in favour of A1 was executed by A3, A4 and A5 for Plot
No.114.
5. This being the case, the defacto complainant had projected as though on 04.02.2018 after the
demise of his father https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.Nos.6894 & 6076 of 2021 Subbayya
Pillai, the defacto complainant had come to house of the petitioners and asked for the share of his
father's property in Plot Nos.114, 115 and 116. A3 to A5 said to have informed that A1 was given
Power of Attorney for the properties. The second respondent/defacto complainant had no right over
the property and he was threatened not to raise any claim and issues in this regard in future.
Thereafter, the second respondent confirmed the same by verifying the Encumbrance Certificate,
found registration of sale agreement for the plots in Doc.No.5902 of 2004 was in force. Suppressing
this agreement with his father, subsequently, Power of Attorney documents was in conspiracy with
A1 and all the accused attempted to misappropriate and cheat second respondent. It is further
submitted that A1 and Subbayya Pillai were jointly doing real estate business. Since Subbayya Pillai
was not showing interest in making the investments as promised, A1 continued in the project.
Further there was some difference of opinion with Subbayya Pillai with regard to the other
properties, for which a civil suit is pending before the Sub-Court, Kanchipuram, in O.S.No.349 of
2009 between A1 and Subbayya Pillai, both fell apart and no business
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.Nos.6894 & 6076 of 2021 thereafter. As regards the
property of A2 to A4, though an agreement was entered by Sappani Pillai along with Subbayya Pillai,
Late Subbayya Pillai failed to show interest to make investment and hence, the agreement became
unenforcible. The only fault is that the said sale agreement was not cancelled by any registered deed.
The sale agreement dated 02.09.2004 was never acted upon. The said Subbayya Pillai was not
involved in this business venture with A1 and he was not informed about the transactions in respect
of Plot Nos.114, 115 and 116 to A2 to A4, thereafter A1 not with A2 to A4. Further, he submitted that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/111809271/ 3
Sappani Pillai vs State:Represented By on 30 November, 2021
if the sale agreement Doc.No.5902 of 2004 dated 02.09.2004 is construed to be in force, then also,
no offence is made out, since as per the condition No.6 of the sale agreement, condition is that
within two months from the receipt of sale deed from the Tamil Nadu Slum clearance Board, the
properties to be conveyed to A1/Sappani Pillai and late Subbayya Pillai. The Slum Clearance Board
is yet to execute the sale deed.
6. In this case, admittedly the sale deed is yet to be conveyed by the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance
Board to A2 to A4. The accused A2 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.Nos.6894 & 6076 of
2021 to A4, not received any money from the defacto complainant's father and whatever the money
paid by A1 as major payments were through bank and cheques. The defacto complainant is unable to
produce even a single piece of evidence to show payment were made by his late father, pursuant to
the sale agreement dated 02.09.2004. The defacto complainant is making a claim that his father is
entitled to his share in the property without any proof. Till the life time of Subbayya Pillai, from the
year 2004 to 2018, the said Subbayya Pillai had objected to the execution of the Power of Attorney
Doc.No.1609 of 2004 in favour of A1 and subsequent Power of Attorney Doc.Nos.1922, 1923, 1924
of 2004 & 782 of 2015. The said Subbayya Pillai has withdrawn from the sale agreement, he had not
made any objection and he left his business venture, A1 alone is the Power Agent who made
payments with regard to sale of plots. Since the valuation of the property in Plot Nos.114, 115 & 116
have increased, out of greed, with false allegations, the defacto complainant lodged the above case.
Prior to his complaint, the defacto complainant and LRs of Late Subbayya Pillai filed a civil suit in
O.S.No.383 of 2018 on 17.07.2018, for execution of sale deed by A2 to
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.Nos.6894 & 6076 of 2021 A4 as per Doc. No.5902 of 2009
the sale agreement dated 02.09.2004.
7. In the plaint, their admission is that the sale deed is yet to be executed by the Tamil Nadu Slum
Clearance Board to A2 to A4. Further nowhere in the plaint, any averment is made or any document
or materials produced to show when and what manner the payments were made by late Subbayya
Pillai pursuant to the sale agreement.
8. Suppressing the Civil Suit, the defacto complainant lodged a complaint as though he was cheated
and misappropriation taken place. There is no tangible material to show that investment is made by
the said Late Subbayya Pillai. In view of the same, there cannot be any misappropriation and
cheating. Further with regard to use of abusive words and criminal intimidation, it had remained
only as threat and nothing more.
9. For the same cause of action, the defacto complainant and LRs of Late Subbayya Pillai have filed a
Civil Suit which is pending. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.Nos.6894 & 6076 of 2021 The
civil suit will have a bearing and thereafter it is to be seen whether at all Subbayya Pillai had made
any payment and he has got share, pursuant to the sale agreement dated 02.09.2004.
10. The respondent police failed to consider all these facts which are predominately civil in nature.
For the reason best known to them, they had filed a final report which cannot be sustained in any
manner. He further submitted that a civil dispute has been given a criminal cloak.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/111809271/ 4
Sappani Pillai vs State:Represented By on 30 November, 2021
11. It is to be seen that, in this case, a sale agreement was executed on 02.09.2004 and in that sale
agreement, it was agreed that Rs.8 lakhs to be paid on that day and balance of Rs.6 lakhs to be paid
within one month and thereafter, balance amount of Rs.4,92,000/- to be paid at the time of
execution of sale deed. Since the said Sappani Pillai/A1 and late Subbayya Pillai failed to make
payments as per the sale agreement immediately on 18.10.2004, the Power of Attorney documents
were cancelled. Thereafter A1/Sappani Pillai alone https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
Crl.O.P.Nos.6894 & 6076 of 2021 approached A2 to A4 pursued the sale of plots, made payments
and executed the required documents. Late Subbayya Pillai was not involved in any transaction
thereof.
12. The accused Nos.2 to 4 had received a sum of Rs.17 lakhs from Sappani Pillai in several
instalments through cheques. Not even a single rupee was received from late Subbayya Pillai.
13. Further in support of his contention, the learned counsel for the petitioners /accused relied upon
the judgments as follows:-
1) R.K.Vijayasarathy Vs. Sudha Seetharaman reported in (2019) 16 SCC 739.
2) Narandas Karsondas Vs. S.A.Kamtam and Another reported in (1977) 3 SCC 247.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.Nos.6894 & 6076 of 2021
3) Suraj Lamp and Industries Pvt.Ltd. Vs. State of Haryana reported in (2012) 1 SCC 655.
4) Pawan Kumar Vs. State of Haryana and another reported in 1996 SCC (4) 17.
5) Vikram Johar Vs. The State of Uttar Pradesh & another reported in (2019) 14 SCC 207.
6) Central Bureau of Investigation, Hyderabad Vs. K.Narayana Rao reported in 2012 (9) SCC 512.
7) Indian Oil Corporation Vs. NEPC India Limited and others reported in 2006 (5) SCC Page 736.
14. Even if the charge sheet is taken as a whole, then to, offence is not made out. Further the sale
agreement is of the year 2004. Till the demise of the defacto complainant's father late Subbayya
Pillai https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.Nos.6894 & 6076 of 2021 in the year 2018, neither
late Subbayya Pillai nor his LRs including the defacto complainant raised any objection, made any
claim on the transactions between A1 and the other accused. Further, in a case of contract of sale,
that itself does not create any interest or right over the plot Nos.114, 115 & 116. The Power of
Attorney is only a deed of convenience under stamp as required by law, authorizing the Power of
Attorney to act on behalf of the principal. Further an agreement of sale, whether with possession or
without possession, is not a deed of convenience, as per Section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act.
Sale of immovable property cannot be made only by sale agreement and it does not create any
interest or right over the property. Further, the abuse and threat is not followed with action and that
would not attract any offence. Further, in the case of conspiracy, it is to be seen that from the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/111809271/ 5
Sappani Pillai vs State:Represented By on 30 November, 2021
uncontroversial statements and materials, no inference can be drawn against the accused and, the
circumstances are incapable of any reason and explanation leading to the guilt of the accused. In
this case, the circumstances projected by the prosecution nowhere leads to any reasonable
explanation.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.Nos.6894 & 6076 of 2021
15. The Hon'ble Apex Court had clearly held that in a commercial transaction or dispute which may
also involve criminal offence, if the remedy lies only in civil law, the complaint can be quashed. Thus
the case under Section 482 of Cr.P.C., can be quashed. Relying upon another judgment, the learned
counsel for the accused has submitted that the case against them if taken at their face value and seen
at its entirety, prima facie no offence is made out as against the accused. Hence, prayed for quashing
the C.C.No.25 of 2021.
16. The second respondent/defacto complainant submitted that the defacto complainant's father
died intestate on 04.02.2018. During his life time, the second respondent's father along with
A1/Sappani Pillai was carrying real estate business. In the course of the business, they had entered
into a sale agreement with A2 to A4 for the plots allotted to them by the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance
Board in Plot Nos.114, 115 and 116 in Gandhi Nagar, Ambattur, Tiruvallur District. At the time of
entering the agreement, Rs.8 lakhs was paid by both the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
Crl.O.P.Nos.6894 & 6076 of 2021 respondent's father and Sappani Pillai (A1) which is recorded in
the sale agreement which is a registered document. Subsequently, within one month Rs.6 lakhs was
to be paid, late Subbayya Pillai and Sappani Pillai (A1) paid 3 lakhs each. Thereafter, the Power of
Attorney was in favour of Sappani Pillai alone without knowledge of late Subbayya Pillai. Using the
same, now, the accused have conspired to alienate the property to some other person, thereby a part
of sale consideration received from late Subbayya Pillai has been misappropriated and cheated.
After the death of late Subbayya Pillai during month of February 2018, the second respondent
approached the accused and asked for the share of late Subbayya Pillai. The second respondent was
abused, threatened and further warned not to make any claim. Second respondent applied for
Encumbrance certificate and found that the earlier Power of Attorney dated 15.10.2004 was
cancelled on 18.10.2004 without the knowledge of Late Subbayya Pillai, and later another Power of
Attorney was extended by A2 to A4 individually on 15.12.2004. Further after demise of Kannaiyya
(A2), who died on 10.06.2011, allottee for Plot No.114, another Power of Attorney
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.Nos.6894 & 6076 of 2021 Doc.No.782 of 2015 was
executed by A3 to A5 in favour of A1. The accused 2 to 4 executed Power of Attorney in favour of A1
alone and late Subbayya Pillai father of the second respondent was not informed about the same.
This Power of Attorney was executed clearly with intention to misappropriate the amounts paid by
the late Subbaya Pillai, the second respondent's father. During April 2018, the defacto complainant
approached the accused to cancel the Power of Attorney dated 02.09.2004 created for the purpose
of cheating, in conspiracy by all the accused. Since the second respondent's father is a joint
agreement holder, the defacto complainant expressed his willingness to pay the balance sale
consideration Rs.2,46,000/- his father late Subbaya Pillai's share to complete the agreement for
sale. The accused not only refused, they threatened and abused the defacto complainant. Hence, he
lodged a complaint during April, 2018, which was initially assigned CSR.No.375 of 2018, no action
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/111809271/ 6
Sappani Pillai vs State:Represented By on 30 November, 2021
taken. Thereafter, the 2nd respondent approached the Judicial Magistrate No.I, Poonamallee, filed a
Petition u/s.156(3) Cr.P.C, in CMP.No.4425 of 2008. Thereafter only a case came to be registered.
On completion of investigation, charge sheet filed along with https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
Crl.O.P.Nos.6894 & 6076 of 2021 listed witnesses LW1 to LW6 and annexing documents, the Lower
Court has taken the case on file in C.C.No.25 of 2021. Immediately, the petitioners rushed to this
Court without following the procedure established by law. Hence, prayed for dismissal of this
petition.
17. The learned Additional Public Prosecutor submitted that in this case, on the orders of the
Judicial Magistrate No.I, Poonamallee, u/s.156(3) CrPC in CMP.No.4425 of 2018, dated 24.08.2018,
case in Crime No.666 of 2018 got registered on 24.10.2018. Immediately on receipt of the First
Information Report, the complainant was examined and statements recorded. Thereafter, his
brother and wife were examined as LW1 to LW3. All these witnesses categorically spoken about
A1/Sappani Pillai and late Subbayya Pillai were partners doing real estate business and on
02.09.2004 a sale agreement was entered by them with between A2 to A4 for the Plots No.114, 115
and 116 allotted to them by the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board. As per the sale agreement, the
said late Subbayya Pillai made equal payments along with Sappani Pillai (A1) and he is entitled for
50% of the share in the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.Nos.6894 & 6076 of 2021
property.
18. This being the case, suppressing the registered sale agreement, A1 conspired with the other
accused, got a Power of Attorney executed in his name alone, and was dealing with the property and
now taking advantage of demise of late Subbayya Pillai, they are denying the LRs of late Subbayya
Pillai of their rights and share in the property. Thus, all the accused conspired together, had
committed the above offence. LW4 is the SRO who produced the certified copies of
Doc.Nos.1992/2004, 1923/2004 1924/2004 the Power of Attorney documents executed by A2 to A4
in favour of A1. After demise of Kannaiya(A2), A3, A4 and A5 executed another Power of Attorney
for Plot.No.114 in Doc.No.782 of 2015 in favour of A1. He also produced the sale agreement
Doc.No.5092 of 2004. Thus from the certified copies of the document, it is proved that when earlier
sale agreement was in force for the Plots allotted to A2 to A4, subsequently agreement and power of
attorney with A1 alone created. LW5 is the Sub-Inspector of Police who registered the First
Information Report, recorded the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.Nos.6894 & 6076 of
2021 statements of witnesses. LW6 is the Inspector of Police Investigating Officer who conducted
further investigation, filed charge sheet in this case. Pendency of civil suit would not absolve the
accused of their criminality, in misappropriating and cheating the funds of late Subbayya Pillai.
Further, all the accused conspired together denied the LRs of Subbayya Pillai of their share. The sale
agreement dated 02.09.2004, the document speaks for itself and the statement of witnesses would
confirm that all accused, conspired together, committed the offence of misappropriation and
cheating, abused 2nd Respondent using filthy language and also criminally intimidated him. On
completion of investigation, charge sheet filed before the Lower Court, and the Lower Court, on
perusal of the materials, finding prima facie case made out, against the accused taken the case on
file in C.C.No.25 of 2021 issued summons. Immediately, the petitioners approached this Court. The
learned Additional Public Prosecutor submitted that the points raised by the petitioners are factual
in nature which are to be decided during trial and hence, opposed the quash application.

Sappani Pillai vs State:Represented By on 30 November, 2021
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.Nos.6894 & 6076 of 2021
19. Considering the submission and on perusal of the materials, it is seen that A1/Sappani Pillai and
late Subbayya Pillai father of defacto complainant were jointly doing real estate business initially. In
this case, A2, A3, A4 were allotted plots by the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board under
Lease-cum-Sale Agreement Scheme for Plots No.114, 115 and 116. These plots were agreed to be sold
to Sappani Pillai and Subbayya Pillai, sale agreement dated 02.09.2004 was entered. As per the sale
agreement, initially, an amount of Rs.8 lakhs was paid on that day, followed by Rs.6 lakhs to be paid
within one month thereafter, balance sum of Rs.4,92,000/- to be paid on the day of execution of sale
deed. In the sale agreement, though the Power of Attorney clause was initially typed in Para Nos.9 &
11, later it was struck down. For what reason it was created and struck down is not known. It is clear
that late Subbayya Pillai was aware of these facts. Further, there is no specific prohibitory clause
whether Power of Attorney to be executed in favour of both the agreement holders namely,
Sappanipillai and Subbayya Pillai. Thereafter, on 15.10.2004, Power of Attorney was executed
jointly in Doc.No.1609 of 2004 by A2 to A4 in https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.Nos.6894 &
6076 of 2021 favour of A1. Thereafter, on 18.10.2004, the Power of Attorney Doc.No.1609/2004 was
cancelled by cancellation deed Doc.No.1611 on 18.10.2004. Prior to the cancellation, telegrams were
sent to A1, intimating the same. Thereafter, payments made by Sappani Pillai A1 alone, which is
recorded on 30.11.2004, followed by the Power of Attorney executed by A2 in Doc.No.1922 of 2004,
A3 in Doc.No.1924/2004 and A4 in Doc.No.1923/2004. Since A2 passed away on 10.06.2011, the
Power of Attorney in Doc.No.1922 of 2004 cannot be acted upon and thereafter, the LRs of A2, viz.,
A3, A4 and A5 executed the Power of Attorney Doc.No.782 of 2015 for Plot No.114. Till the life time
of late Subbayya Pillai, father of the defacto complainant, the defacto complainant or any of the LRs
of late Subbayya Pillai has not made any claim or raised any objection with regard to execution of
the Power of Attorney Doc.Nos.1609/2004, 1922/2004, 1923/2004 & 782 of 2015. It is seen that, in
the year 2009, there was some dispute between Sappani Pillai/A1 and late Subbayya Pillai, who filed
a Civil Suit in O.S.No.349 of 2009 with regard to the property at Mugalivakkam. It is also seen that,
after the demise of late Subbayya https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.Nos.6894 & 6076 of
2021 Pillai, the LRs of late Sappani Pillai, filed a Civil Suit in O.S.No.383 of 2018 before the
Sub-Court, Poonamallee on 18.07.2018, seeking relief for the same plots based on the sale
agreement doc. No.5902 of 2004 dated 02.09.2004, which is the genesis and subject matter of the
above case.
20. The crux in the Civil Suit is that the accused in this case have conspired together and are not
performing the obligations as per the sale agreement Doc. No.5902 of 2004 dated 02.09.2004,
hence, sought for execution of sale deed in respect of ½ share of late Subbayya Pillai, as per the sale
agreement and to declare the Power of Attorney granted to A1 by the other accused as null and void.
Nowhere in the suit, there is specific averment as regards the mode and manner in which the said
late Subbayya Pillai, made payments pursuant to the sale agreement dated 02.09.2004.
21. On the contrary, the payments by A1 was made in cash, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
Crl.O.P.Nos.6894 & 6076 of 2021 cheque details are given which is not questioned. On the other
hand, the defacto complainant's only grievance appears that he is willing to pay his share of
Rs.2,46,000/- and to get his 50% share in the sale agreement dated 02.09.2004. On a perusal of the

Sappani Pillai vs State:Represented By on 30 November, 2021
sale agreement dated 02.09.2004, it is categorically stated in para Nos.5, 6 and 11 that the accused 2
to 4's endeavour is to obtain sale deed in their favour from the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board as
early as possible but not later then one year and thereafter, complete the execution of sale deed in
favour of Subbayya Pillai and Sappani Pillai, within a period of two months. Thereafter, from
verification of the document it is seen that, time is not the essence of the contract. The primary
reason for sale agreement is for the marriage expenses of the third accused the sale agreement was
entered. The marriage was conducted on 31.10.2004. It is nowhere stated that the sale deed has
been executed by the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board to the allottees namely, A2, A3 and A4,
which is one of the primary condition of the sale agreement.
22. In view of the same, it cannot be stated that the sale https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
Crl.O.P.Nos.6894 & 6076 of 2021 agreement dated 02.09.2004 is violated. It is alleged that the
defacto complainant and LRs of late Subbayya Pillai were cheated and their funds have been
misappropriated. However, for the same cause of action, the LRs of late Subbayya Pillai filed Civil
Suit which is pending in O.S.No.383 of 2018. The issue involved in the above case is predominantly
civil in nature. From the sale agreement dated 02.09.2004, it is seen that there is no prohibitory
clause for executing Power of Attorney.
23. In view of the same, the Act of executing Power of Attorney by the accused 2 to 4 in favour of A1
is with ulterior motive and with criminal intention is not acceptable. As regards A5, he is the LR of
A2. Since his father A2/Kannaiya died on 10.06.2011, a fresh allottment order No.5188 of 2015 was
issued by the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board in respect of Plot No.114 of 2004 to the LRs of A2,
viz., A3 to A5. Hence, the Power of Attorney Doc.No.782 of 2015 had been executed in favour of A1.
A5 had signed the Power of Attorney and nothing more. From the statement of witnesses, it is seen
that LW1 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.Nos.6894 & 6076 of 2021 is the defacto
complainant, LW2 is the brother of LW1, LW3 is the wife of LW2. These three witnesses have never
stated that they had any personal knowledge about the relationship between Sappani Pillai/A1 and
Subbayya Pillai (deceased) and what were the terms and conditions and what was the business
agreement and understanding between them, and with regard to A2 to A4, there are no shred of
materials.
24. On the contrary, the only violation is that when the sale agreement dated 02.09.2004 is in
existence, the execution of Power of Attorney in favour of A1 is not proper. LW4 is the SRO in the
year 2020 and he is not the SRO in the year 2004 or 2015 when the documents were registered and
he had no personal knowledge except producing the certified copies of the documents, nothing
more. LW5 & LW6 are the Investigating Officers. On going through the statement of all the
witnesses in this case, neither the defacto complainant nor any of the LRs of late Subbayya Pillai
could produce any shred of paper or materials to show the payments made by late Subbayya Pillai
before or after execution of the sale agreement doc. No.5902 of 2004 dated
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.Nos.6894 & 6076 of 2021 02.09.2004. These facts are to
be decided in the civil suit and not in a criminal case.
25. In view of the same, this Court is of the view that if the criminal proceedings are continued
against the petitioners/accused in C.C.No.25 of 2021, it would amount to abuse of process of law.
