P.J.Saroja Ammal vs The Commissioner on 24 November, 2021
13. I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and the learned Standing Counsel for the
respondents. I have perused the impugned Final Assessment Orders dated 17.06.2021 passed by
second respondent and the two Council Resolutions dated 08.12.2010 and 20.09.2018. I have also
perused the orders passed by this Court in W.P.No.19859 of 2020 and in W.P.No.35304 of 2019 etc.
batch and the provisions of the Chennai City Municipal Corporation Act, 1919.

land shall be determined by the commissioner:
Provided that the annual value of any building or land the tax for which is payable by

https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.19880 & 19886 of 2021 Council by resolution may
determine the properties, for which, the property tax can be levied. It states that the property tax

P.J.Saroja Ammal vs The Commissioner on 24 November, 2021
can be levied on all buildings and lands within the city save those which are exempted under the Act

i. a tax for general purposes;
ii. a drainage tax for the purpose of defraying the expenses connected with the

purpose of assessing then property tax thereon shall be ascertained as if such land,
building or portion is not used for the display of such advertisement or
advertisements.
(3) The State Government shall have power to make rules regarding the manner in
which the person or persons by whom and the intervals at which, the value of the
land, the present cost of erecting the building and the amount to be deducted for

clause (a) of the first proviso to sub-section (2) applies, and they may, by such rules,
restrict or modify the application of the provisions contained in Schedule IV to such
case or class of cases.
18. A reading of proviso (a)(ii) to Section 100(2) of the Act indicates that any building of a class not

be estimated, the annual value of the premises shall be deemed to be 6% of the total of the estimated
market value of the land at the time of assessment and the _______________

less than 10% of such cost.
19. A cogent reading of Section 99(2) of the Act and the proviso to Section 100(2) of the Act
indicates that the Council has empower to identify the buildings, class of building which can be
subject to the property tax under the provisions of the aforesaid Act. Section 99(1) of the Act also
states that what are the element which may be including for determination of property tax payable
under the said Act.
20. The power of the Council under Section 99(2) of the Act also extends to prescribing the rate of

(2) Save as otherwise provided in this Act, these taxes shall be levied at such
percentages of the annual value of buildings and lands as may be fixed by the council
:
_______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.19880 & 19886 of
2021 Provided that the aggregate of the percentage so fixed shall not, in the case of
any land or building, be less that 15½ per cent, or greater than 25 per cent of its
annual value.
21. Thus, the Resolution passed by the Council on 08.12.2010 and 20.09.2018 fixing the different
rate of tax for theaters and other buildings in deviation of the method prescribed in proviso to
Section 100(2) of the Act would be contrary to law and any demand made by the Commissioner or
officers to such power delegate to power and collected tax would be contrary to Article 265 of the
Constitution of India.
22. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Nagpur Corporation Vs. Nagpur Handloom Cloth Market, Co.,
AIR 1963 SC 1192 has considered the scope of definition of 'building' and held as under:-
12. “Building” is defined in the Act by Section 5(7) as including “a house, outhouse,
stable, hut, shed or other enclosure, whether used as a human dwelling or otherwise
and shall include verandahs, fixed platforms, plinths, doorsteps, walls and the like”.
The definition is an inclusive definition, and contains inherent indication that a part
of a building would be a building for the purposes of imposition of liability to pay
rates, and assessment of such liability. It is _______________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.19880 & 19886 of 2021 manifest that
under the scheme of the Act read with the rules, conservancy tax and water rate are to
be levied as rates on the gross annual letting value and a rate can only be levied from
a person in respect of the tenement or premises occupied as an independent unit. The
assessment rules provide for levy of rate on the gross annual letting value of the
building, and inasmuch as the expression “building” according to the definition given
in Section 5(7) of the Act would include a part of a building, the Corporation is
competent to frame a list in respect of several tenements occupied by different
persons treating each tenement as a separate building for levy of tax. That is implicit
in Rule 10(b) and also in Rule 10(c) of the assessment rules.
23. In Devon Rai Kapur Vs. New Delhi Municipality, AIR 1980 SC 541 also, the Hon'ble Supreme
Court held that the assessment / revision of property tax shall be only in accordance with provisions
of Section 100 of the Act on the annual value to be ascertained and determined on the principles.
