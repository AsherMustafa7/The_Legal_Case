Smt. Shougaijam (Ongbi) Nirupama Devi vs The State Of Manipur on 18 January, 2023
[1] By way of this writ petition, the petitioner challenges the order dated 04.10.2022
of the District Magistrate, Thoubal District, whereby her husband was subjected to
preventive detention in exercise of power under Section 3 (3) of the W.P. (Crl.) No. 7
of 2023 Page 1 National Security Act, 1980. She seeks a writ of habeas corpus to set
her husband at liberty forthwith.
[2] Heard Mr. K. Pradeep, learned counsel, appearing for the petitioner.
Mr. Th. Vashum, learned Government Advocate, offers to take notice for the State authorities,
respondent Nos. 1 & 2. Mr. Y. Paikhomba, learned counsel representing Mr. Kh. Samarjit, learned
DSGI, offers to take notice for the Union of India, respondent No. 3.
[3] However, we find that the matter is amenable to final disposal at the threshold and does not
require any replies form the respondents on merits. [4] Perusal of the grounds of detention reflects
that the detaining authority was conscious of the fact that the detenu had been arrested in
connection with FIR No. 39(8)2022 Khongjom PS and was thereafter formally arrested in
connection with FIR No. 77(6)2022 Kakching PS, whereupon he was remanded to police custody till
09.09.2022. On 09.09.2022, he was remanded to judicial custody and lodged in Manipur Central
Jail, Sajiwa. Despite his knowledge of the fact that the detenu was incarcerated at the time of
passing of the detention order, the detaining authority, viz., the District Magistrate, Thoubal
District, did not mention either in the detention order or in the grounds of detention as to whether
any bail petition had been filed by the detenu in connection with the 2(two) FIRs under which he
had been arrested, whereby he could have formed an opinion as to the likelihood of his release on
bail.
[5] In Rekha vs. State of Tamil Nadu, through Secretary to Government and another [(2011) 5 SCC
244], the Supreme Court observed that there would be a real possibility of release of a person who is
already in custody W.P. (Crl.) No. 7 of 2023 Page 2 provided he has moved a bail application, which
is pending, as in such a case, the detaining authority can reasonably conclude that there is likelihood
of the detenu being released on bail.
[6] Therefore, it is incumbent upon a detaining authority to verify whether or not the person in
custody has moved a bail petition so as to determine the possibility of his being released on bail and
only thereafter, proceed to exercise power under the special law of preventive detention. In the case
on hand, the District Magistrate, Thoubal, did not even undertake this exercise as is evident from
the order of detention and the grounds of detention. On this short ground, the writ petition has to
succeed.
[7] W.P. (Crl.) No. 7 of 2023 is accordingly allowed, setting aside the order of detention dated
04.10.2022 passed by the District Magistrate, Thoubal District, in exercise of power under Section 3
(3) of the National Security Act, 1980. All consequential proceedings based thereon shall also stand
set aside.

The detenu, Shri Sougaijam Ronan Singh, presently incarcerated in Manipur Central Jail, Sajiwa,
shall be set at liberty forthwith unless his continued incarceration is validly required in connection
with any other case.
In the circumstances, there shall be no order as to costs.
