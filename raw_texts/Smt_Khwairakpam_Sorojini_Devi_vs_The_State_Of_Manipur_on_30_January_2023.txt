HON'BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. SANJAY KUMAR
For the petitioners/ : Mr. L. Shashibhushan, Advocate
applicants
For the respondents : Mr. R.K. Umakanta, GA
Date of order : 30-01-2023
ORDER
[1] Late Thokchom Praphulla Singh, a Special Class Contractor, was awarded the work of
'Improvement of the Road from Saikul to Hangoipat' by the State of Manipur, under Agreement
dated 04-10-2013. After completing the work, the Contractor died on 04-09-2021, before settlement
of his dues. His widow and daughters filed this petition under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996, seeking appointment of an Arbitrator to settle their claims arising under the
Agreement dated 04-10-2013. According to their petition averments, the principal amount of (cid:128).
21,39,832/- still remains due and payable along with interest thereon. [2] An affidavit-in-opposition

Smt. Khwairakpam Sorojini Devi vs The State Of Manipur on 30 January, 2023
was filed by the State authorities, viz., respondent Nos. 2 & 3, stating that the balance amount
payable for the subject work was not (cid:128). 21,39,832/- but only (cid:128). 12,61,052/-. [3] As the amount in
dispute was in the range of just a few lakhs, this Court requested the parties to resolve their
differences, if possible, through amicable negotiations. On 15-12-2021, Mr. L. Shashibhushan,
learned counsel for the petitioners, fairly stated that his clients would be willing to forego the
interest amount along with the claimed differences in the rates of bitumen and settle for the
principal amount of (cid:128). 12,03,823/- without interest, if it is paid within a specified time frame.
[4] Mr. R.K. Umakanta, learned Government Advocate, appearing for the State, sought time to
verify whether this offer would be acceptable to the authorities. On 08-06-2022, Mr. R.K.
Umakanta, learned Government Advocate, informed the Court that unless the petitioners produced
a Succession Certificate from a competent Court of law, they would not be entitled to receive the
payment due. However, he thereafter informed the Court that there is no rule which requires
production of a Succession Certificate from a Court of law and it would suffice if the petitioners
demonstrate that they are the legal heirs of the deceased Contractor. [5] Thereupon, the petitioners
filed MC (Arb.P.(J2) No. 1 of 2023 placing on record Annexure - X/1 to X/12. The miscellaneous
case is allowed and the documents are taken on record. Annexure - X/1 is the Legal Heir Certificate
issued by the Sub-Divisional Officer, Lamphel, Imphal West, noting that the petitioners are the legal
heirs of late Thokchom Praphulla Singh, who expired on 04-09-2021. The Pension Payment Order
in favour of his widow, petitioner No. 1, is Annexure - X/2. Annexure - X/3 to X/10 are the
AADHAAR Cards and Pan Cards of the petitioners, showing their relationship with late Thokchom
Praphulla Singh. Annexure - X/11 (Colly) are the affidavits dated 17-01-2023 executed by petitioners
Nos. 1, 2 & 4, authorizing petitioner No. 3 to receive the payment of (cid:128). 12,03,823/-, on their behalf,
from the Public Works Department, Government of Manipur. Mr. R.K. Umakanta, learned
Government Advocate, would concede that these documents would suffice to prove the claim of the
petitioners that they are the legal heirs of late Thokchom Praphulla Singh. He further states that the
payment of the principal sum of (cid:128). 12,03,823/- would be made to petitioner No. 3, the authorized
representative of the petitioners, within three months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
[6] In the light of the amicable settlement arrived at by and between the parties, this Court finds no
reason to exercise power under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, and
appoint an Arbitrator.
Arb.P.(J2) No. 1 of 2020 is accordingly disposed of, leaving it open to the petitioners to approach
this Court once again, if warranted.
MC (Arb.P.(J2) No. 1 of 2023 is ordered.
