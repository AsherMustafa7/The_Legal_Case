The State Of Manipur vs Shri K.S. Standhope on 1 February, 2023
Sanjay Kumar (C.J.):
[1] The State of Manipur and its Director of School Education are in appeal against
the judgment and order dated 03.05.2016 passed by a learned Judge of this Court
allowing W.P. (C) No. 626 of 2014. The said writ petition was W.A. No. 64 of 2017
Page 1 filed by respondent No. 1 herein assailing the decision of the State
Government not to extend his services from 01.09.2010 to 28.07.2011. This decision
was reflected in the letter dated 31.10.2013, impugned in the writ petition. He also
sought a consequential direction to the authorities to refund the sum of (cid:128).3,14,186/-
deducted from his pensionary benefits.
[2] Heard Mr. S. Nepolean, learned Government Advocate, appearing for the
appellants; and Mr. N. Umakanta, learned counsel, appearing for respondent No. 1,
viz., the writ petitioner.
[3] Respondent No. 1 was appointed as a Matriculate Teacher in the year 1971. The
school that he was working in was taken over by the Government of Manipur and he
was absorbed and appointed as a regular Assistant Teacher in the service of the
Government. He was thereafter promoted as a Head Master in February, 2003. As
per his date of birth in the service records, he was to retire on 31.08.2010 upon
attaining the age of superannuation, viz., 59 years. However, termination of his
services on that ground was never effected and he was continued in service in
anticipation of the Government's proposal to enhance the age of superannuation
from 59 to 60 years. He was accordingly permitted to render service till 28.07.2011. It
is an admitted fact that the order of the Government extending the age of
superannuation to 60 years was issued on 29.11.2010 and it is also admitted that
respondent No. 1 was rendering service as a Headmaster on that date. It was only on
28.07.2011 that an order was issued by the Director of School Education,
Government of Manipur, terminating his services w.e.f. 31.08.2010. By letter dated
31.10.2013, the Director of School Education, Government of Manipur, informed the
Accounts Officer/Pension, office of the W.A. No. 64 of 2017 Page 2 Accountant
General, Manipur, that the overdrawal amount by respondent No.1, as reported by
the Zonal Education Officer, was (cid:128).3,14,186/- and that the same required to be
deducted from his pensionary benefits. Thereafter, while processing his pensionary
benefits, the salary drawn by respondent No. 1 after 31.08.2010 was deducted, viz.,
(cid:128).3,14,186/-.
[4] Aggrieved by this action on the part of the authorities, respondent No. 1 approached this Court
and was granted relief by the learned Judge by the judgment and order under appeal. Hence, this
appeal.
[5] It is an admitted fact that respondent No. 1 was permitted to continue in service even after
31.08.2010 though superannuation was to be effected at the age of 59 years. In this regard, it may be
noted that he applied to the State Public Information Officer, Directorate of Education (School),

The State Of Manipur vs Shri K.S. Standhope on 1 February, 2023
Government of Manipur, under the Right to Information Act, 2005, seeking the file-notings in
connection with his service and he was provided the Extract of File No. 1/7/2007-
ED(AD/Hills)Pt-1(UKL) with Note No. 43. The file-notings reflect the following entry:
'With the extension of service superannuation age, this particular pension case need
not be processed.' As it is the admitted factual position that respondent No. 1 was
never served with any order effecting termination of his service upon his attaining the
age of superannuation on 31.08.2010 and as the above file-noting clearly indicated
that the authorities themselves were of the opinion that his services needed to be
extended in terms of the Government's proposal to enhance the age of
superannuation, this Court passed an order on 11.08.2022 in this appeal directing
that that Original File in relation to the aforestated file-noting should be produced.
W.A. No. 64 of 2017 Page 3
[6] Mr. S. Nepolean, learned Government Advocate, thereafter took
several adjournments but now informs this Court that the Original File is not
traceable. When an extract therefrom was furnished to respondent No. 1 upon his
query under the Right to Information Act, 2005, this Court is at a loss to understand
as to how the said file could be misplaced. An adverse inference would therefore have
to be drawn against the authorities for non-production of the file. Obviously, the
contents of the file speak against them and that is the reason why the authorities are
reluctant to place the same before this Court. [7] That apart, the ineluctable fact
remains that respondent No.1 was never served with an order terminating his
services upon retirement. In this regard reference may be made to Rule 56 of the
Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972, which provides that every Head of
Department shall have a list prepared every 3 months, that is, on 1st January, 1st
April, 1st July and 1st October, each year, of all Government servants who are due to
retire within the next 12-15 months of that date. A copy of the said list is to be
supplied to the Accounts Officer concerned. Mr. S. Nepolean, learned Government
Advocate, fairly concedes that there is no such list available reflecting the name of
respondent No.1. It is therefore clear that no steps were taken by the authorities at
any point of time to effect termination of respondent No. 1's services on the ground
that he was to attain the age of superannuation on 31.08.2010. To compound matters
further, the authorities utilized his services till 28.07.2011 without any protest and
paid him his salary. This fact is sufficient in itself to set at naught the claim of the
appellants that respondent No. 1 is deemed to have retired from service on
31.08.2010. Having utilized his services all through, it is not open to them to now
seek to deny him the just benefits therefor.
W.A. No. 64 of 2017 Page 4
[8] Reference in this regard may be made to the judgment of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130292157/ 3
The State Of Manipur vs Shri K.S. Standhope on 1 February, 2023
Supreme Court in State of Punjab and others Vs. Rafiq Masih (White Washer) and
others {(2015) 4 SCC 334}. Therein, the Supreme Court held that recoveries cannot
be effected from retired employees in the situations enumerated, one of which is that
recoveries cannot be effected from employees belonging to class-III and class-IV
service or group-C and group D service. Admittedly, respondent No. 1 falls within this
category. Further, this Court is informed that the deducted amount of (cid:128).3,14,186/-
has already been refunded to respondent No. 1. That being so, this Court finds no
reason to reverse the same at this stage.
On the above analysis, no grounds are made out to interfere with the judgment and
order dated 03.05.2016 passed in W.P. (C) No. 626 of 2014.
The writ appeal is accordingly dismissed.
In the circumstances, there shall be no order as to costs.
