RESPONDENTS TO RESTORE THE LANDS TO THE PETITIONER
AND ETC.,
THIS W.P. IS BEING HEARD AND RESERVED ON
24.11.2022 COMING ON FOR PRONOUNCEMENT OF ORDERS
THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:-
ORDER
In this petition, petitioner seeks quashing of the impugned acquisition proceedings pursuant to the
preliminary notification dated 16.07.1988 and final declaration dated 19.01.1989 issued by the
respondents and for other reliefs.
2. The material on record discloses that on 16.07.1988, the respondents issued a preliminary
notification under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1984 (for short 'the L.A.Act') proposing
to acquire 125 acres of land including the subject lands of the petitioners for the purpose of
establishing a High Technological Park by the Defence Department. Subsequently, an additional 2
acres 36 guntas was added to the acquisition and a final notification dated 19.01.1989 was issued
under Section 6(1) of the L.A.Act by invoking the urgency clause under Section 17 of the L.A.Act and
by dispensing with the enquiry required under Section 5-A of the L.A.Act. Subsequently, the award
was passed on 10.05.1990 and possession was taken on 24.07.1989. As per the award, compensation
was fixed at Rs.1,30,000/- per acre payable in favour of the petitioners and other land losers.
Subsequently, being dissatisfied with the award, petitioners filed reference applications under
Section 18 of the L.A.Act seeking enhancement of compensation and the same was allowed by the
reference Court vide order dated 13.08.1998, which increased the compensation to Rs.2,48,000/-
per acre. The respondent - beneficiary challenged the said awards of the reference Court in MFA
No.5403/1999 & connected matters which were referred to the High Court Lok Adalat. On
27.08.2001, the appeals were settled between the petitioners and respondents reducing the
compensation payable from Rs.2,48,000/- as determined by the reference court to Rs.2,22,000/-
together with all statutory benefits in full and final settlement of the claim of the petitioners.
3. It was relevant to state that the said settlement before the Lok Adalat was arrived at pursuant to
the joint memo filed by the petitioners and the respondents. Subsequently, the petitioners and other
land losers raised certain objections with regard to calculation of statutory benefit which were
disputed by the respondents and the matter came up before the Lok Adalat once again on
06.05.2002, whereby the Lok Adalat noted that since the matters had already been disposed of by
settlement, if the claimants - petitioners were not satisfied with the calculation or deposit, it was
open for them to levy execution so that the Executing Court can pass appropriate orders.
4. Subsequently, the Execution petitions were taken up for consideration by the Executing court and
since there was a dispute regarding the memos of calculations filed by the petitioners and the
respondents, orders were passed by the Executing Court in favour of the petitioners which were
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/181548418/ 5
K.Nanjunda Reddy vs The State Of Karnataka on 16 February, 2023
challenged by the respondents in W.P.No.4612/2004 c/w W.P.No.4613/2004 which was disposed of
by this Court on 01.08.2005 and the matter was remitted back to the Executing court.
5. The aforesaid execution proceedings are still pending, in which the petitioners contend that the
entire amounts payable by the respondents in terms of the Lok Adalat awards together with benefits
have not been paid by them to the petitioners.
6. Meanwhile, petitioners challenged the aforesaid Lok Adalat awards passed by this Court in MFA
No.5403/1999 & connected matters by preferring W.P.No.11372/2017 and connected petitions
before this Court seeking setting aside of the Lok Adalat awards. Simultaneously, petitioners have
also filed the present petition challenging the acquisition notifications and proceedings. In this
context, it is necessary to state that the aforesaid W.P.No.11372/2017 filed by the petitioners against
the Lok Adalat awards, has been dismissed by the Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court vide order
dated 24.03.2022 and consequently, the Lok Adalat awards dated 27.08.2001 have attained finality
and become conclusive and binding upon the petitioners.
7. Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, learned HCGP for respondents - State and learned
DSGI for respondents 4 and 5.
8. In addition to reiterating the various contentions urged in the petition and referring to the
material on record, learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the impugned notifications
and acquisition proceedings pursuant thereto, deserve to be quashed for the following reasons:-
(i) The respondents invoked the urgency clause as provided under Section 17 of the
L.A.Act, thereby dispensing with the enquiry required under Section 5-A of the
L.A.Act, despite there being no compelling reasons to do so, thereby depriving the
petitioners of their right over the subject lands and in the absence of sufficient or
valid reasons or circumstances to invoke the urgency clause under Section 17, the
impugned acquisition proceedings are vitiated and deserve to be quashed.
(ii) Despite having entered into a settlement before the Lok Adalat, the respondents
have not fully satisfied with the Lok Adalat award and not paid the entire amount due
to
- 10 -
the petitioners, which is one more circumstance that would vitiate the acquisition proceedings.
(iii) Though the respondents sought to acquire the subject lands for the purpose of its Defence
project, the acquired land was not utilized for the said purpose, which is yet another reason for
quashing of the acquisition proceedings.
(iv) In support of his contentions, learned counsel places reliance upon the following judgments:-

9. Per contra, learned Deputy Solicitor General of India appearing for the respondents, in addition
to reiterating the various contentions urged in the statement of objections and referring to the
material on record submits that there is no merit in the petition and the same is liable to be
dismissed on the ground of delay and latches alone. It is contended that merely because the
respondents may not have utilized the entire acquired lands for the purpose of the project, the same
was no ground to seek quashing of the acquisition proceedings. It is pointed out that having
compromised the matter before the Lok Adalat of this Court and having failed in their challenge to
the same, the petitioners are estopped from questioning the acquisition proceedings and as such, the
petition is liable to be dismissed.
10. I have given my anxious consideration to the rival submissions and perused the material on
record.
- 12 -
11. In my considered opinion, the petition is devoid of merit and the same is liable to be dismissed
for the following reasons:-
(a) The undisputed material on record clearly establishes that there is almost delay of
30 years in filing the present petition. Except for stating that the acquisition was a
result of fraud and the delay in challenging the acquisition notifications, is of no
consequence, no other facts or grounds are urged as to why there is such a long and
inordinate delay in preferring the petition. Under these circumstances, I am of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/181548418/ 7
K.Nanjunda Reddy vs The State Of Karnataka on 16 February, 2023
considered opinion that the long, inordinate and unexplained delay on the part of the
petitioners in challenging the acquisition after a lapse of 30 years is sufficient to come
to the conclusion that the petition is liable to be dismissed on the ground of delay and
latches alone.
(b) The undisputed material on record also establishes that the possession of the
subject lands having been taken on 24.07.1989, the award was passed on 10.05.1990
and enhanced compensation was awarded by the reference court at the instance of
the petitioners on
- 13 -
13.08.1998 in LAC No.60/1992. The compensation having been enhanced to Rs.2,48,000/- per acre
by the reference court, the appeals preferred by the respondents herein in MFA No.5403/1999 and
connected matters was referred to the High Court Lok Adalat, wherein a Joint memo was filed and
the matter was settled and awards were passed by the Lok Adalat. The Lok Adalat awards were also
challenged by the petitioners herein in W.P.No.11372/2017 and connected matters which were
dismissed by the Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court on 24.03.2022, by holding as under:-
In these batch of writ petitions the petitioners have sought for setting aside the order
and award passed by the High Court Lok Adalath Committee, Bengaluru dated
27.08.2001/03.09.2001/21.09.2001.
2. The facts leading to the filing of the present writ petitions are, that second
respondent has acquired the lands of the petitioners and other properties for public
purpose and published the Gazette Notification under Section 4(1) of the Land
Acquisition Act, 1894 (for short LA Act, 1894) invoking emergency clause under
Section 17 of the LA Act, 1894 vide notification bearing No. LAQ(2) SR-7/88-89
dated 16.07.1988 and final notification bearing No. RD/71/AQB/89 dated 19.01.1989
vide Karnataka Gazette dated
- 14 -
11.05.1989. Respondent No. 2 has awarded compensation at the rate of Rs.1,30,000/-
per acre.
Petitioners, dissatisfied with the award, have filed the reference application under Section 18 of the
LA Act, 1894, claiming higher compensation of Rs.10,00,000/- per acre. Respondent No. 2 referred
the matter under Section 18 of the LA Act, 1894 to City Civil Court, Bengaluru for adjudication of the
reference applications. The Additional City Civil Court (CCH-17) after detailed enquiry and
considering the documents and evidence on record fixed the compensation at Rs.2,48,000/- per
acre. Respondent No. 1 - Defence Estate Officer preferred appeals before this Court in M.F.A. Nos.
5397/1999, 5403/1999, 5409/19999, 5405/1999, 5412/1999, 5418/1999, 5343/1999, 5413/1999,
5402/1999, 5408/1999 and 5386/1999. The said appeals have been referred to High Court Lok
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/181548418/ 8
K.Nanjunda Reddy vs The State Of Karnataka on 16 February, 2023
Adalat. The Lok Adalat on the basis of the joint memo filed by the appellants and the respondents,
fixed the compensation at Rs.2,22,000/- per acre as against Rs.2,48,000/- per acre with a direction
to deposit the award amount within two months before the reference Court. It is the contention of
the petitioners that inspite of such direction, the respondents have not deposited the award amount
as per the award passed in the Lok Adalat within two months. The petitioners have filed execution
cases which are pending consideration before the reference Court. It is the contention of the
petitioners that compromise was done forcibly and though the
- 15 -
petitioners were not ready for compromise, it was done only on the assurance that the amount will
be deposited within two months from the date of the order. But, the respondents have not fully
deposited the award amount. That respondent No.1 was depositing the award amount in
installments and has not deposited the award amount in time as per the award passed by the Lok
Adalat and therefore they have filed the present writ petitions seeking to recall the compromise
recorded by the Lok Adalat on 27.08.2001. It is the contention of the petitioners that High Court
Lok Adalat has no jurisdiction to compromise the matters where value of the property in dispute
exceeds Rs.10,00,000/-.
3. Heard Sri. Jayakumar S. Patil, learned Senior Counsel along with Sri. Lokesh Malavalli for
petitioners, Sri. M.N. Kumar and Smt. Anupama Hegde, learned Central Government Standing
Counsel for respondent No. 1.
4. It is the submission of the learned Senior Counsel that the respondents have not deposited the
award amount along with statutory benefits and calculations made by the respondents is not proper.
The respondents have made payments to persons who filed applications under Section 28-A of the
LA Act, 1894 on the basis of the award passed by the High Court Lok Adalat with all statutory
benefits and they are not making payment to petitioners on the basis of
- 16 -
the same calculations paid to the persons who have approached under Section 28-A of the LA Act,
1894.
5. Learned counsel for respondent No. 1 contended that they have made proper calculations and
deposited amount as per their calculations. It is his further submission that the petitioners,
consequently upon deposit of decretal amount before the reference Court had again approached the
Lok Adalat stating that the calculations done by respondent No. 1 was not agreed to by them and
requested the Lok Adalat for clarification. The Lok Adalat by its order dated 06.05.2002 has passed
the order as under:
"As the matters are already disposed of by settlement, if claimants are not satisfied
with the calculations or deposit it is open to levy execution so that the executing
Court can pass appropriate orders."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/181548418/ 9
K.Nanjunda Reddy vs The State Of Karnataka on 16 February, 2023
6. It is their further submission that petitioners thereafter have filed execution petitions. It is their
further submission that respondent No. 1 challenged the order passed by the executing Court in
W.P. No. 4612/2004 and 4613/2004 before this Court and they were allowed with a direction to the
executing Court for fresh disposal in accordance with law within a period of two months. It is their
further submission that in similar acquisition cases respondent No. 1 had filed W.P. Nos.
50679/2012, 10615/2013, 10617/2013 and 10619/2013 before this Court against the orders passed
by the executing Court and this Court while allowing the writ petitions has held that the respondents
are not entitled for any interest on
- 17 -
solatium prior to 19.09.2001 relying upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of
Sunder Vs. Union of India reported in 2001 AIR SCW 3691 and in the case of Gurpreet Singh Vs.
Union of India reported in (2006) 8 SCC 457. It is their further submission that petitioners did not
make out any grounds for challenging the consent award passed by the Lok Adalat and the same was
passed without any force, coercion or undue influence. The petitioners after accepting the consent
award passed way back in the year 2001 had prosecuted the execution petition before the executing
Court and now after lapse of nearly 15 years have challenged the award passed by the Lok Adalat
and therefore the petitions are not maintainable on the ground of delay and laches and the action of
the petitioners is nothing but abuse of process of law.
7. Even though the petitions have been filed seeking setting aside of the award passed by the Lok
Adalat dated 27.08.2001, learned counsel for the petitioners has not chosen to argue and make out
any grounds for setting aside the award. Instead he chose to argue only regarding the manner of
calculations of the amount as per the award. What is the amount the petitioners are entitled as per
the award is to be calculated by the executing Court. The petitioners have not challenged any order
passed by the executing Court in the present writ petitions. The execution cases filed by the
petitioners are pending before the reference Court. The petitioners are at
- 18 -
liberty to agitate regarding the mode and method of proper calculation of the amount as per the
award passed by the Lok Adalat, as per the decisions of the Apex Court and the order passed by this
Court in W.P. No. 10617/2013 (LA-RES) dated 04.09.2013.
8. The award passed by the Lok Adalat is sought to be quashed on the ground that the petitioners
have been forced to enter into compromise. The compromise came to be recorded before the Lok
Adalat during August/September, 2001. The present petitions came to be filed in the year 2017. Till
the filing of the present writ petitions the petitioners have not made the said allegation of forcing
them to enter into compromise in any of the proceedings either before this Court or before the
reference Court/executing Court. It is only when a dispute arose regarding the mode and method of
calculations the petitioners have approached this Court challenging the award passed by the Lok
Adalat on the ground that there is force to enter into compromise. The said attitude of the
petitioners is not bonafide and it is an after thought. When the petitioners have filed execution cases
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/181548418/ 10
K.Nanjunda Reddy vs The State Of Karnataka on 16 February, 2023
seeking execution of the award passed by the Lok Adalat they are estopped from challenging the
award passed by the Lok Adalat on the ground that they were forced to enter into compromise.
9. The award under challenge in the present petitions has been passed in the year 2001 and the
- 19 -
present petitions are filed in the year 2017, i.e., after passage of 16 long years. There is no
explanation by the petitioners for the delay in approaching this Court. The claim of the petitioners is
defeated by delay and laches. It is trite law that if there is delay and laches on the part of the
petitioners, on the same ground the writ Court can refuse to grant relief. The Apex Court in the case
of Eastern Coalfields Limited Vs. Dugal Kumar, reported in 2008 (14) SCC 295 has observed thus:
"24. ... ... It is well settled that under Article 226 of the Constitution, the power of a
High Court to issue an appropriate writ, order or direction is discretionary. One of
the grounds to refuse the relief by a writ court is that the petitioner is guilty of delay
and laches. It is imperative, where the petitioner invokes extraordinary remedy under
Article 226 of the Constitution, that he should come to the court at the earliest
reasonably possible opportunity. Inordinate delay in making the motion for a writ is
indeed an adequate ground for refusing to exercise discretion in favour of the
applicant."
8. The petitioners have not made out any grounds to set aside the award passed by the High Court
Lok Adalat Committee and hence, the following;
ORDER Writ petitions are dismissed.
(c) As can be seen from the aforesaid order passed by this Court, which has attained finality and
become conclusive and binding upon the petitioners, both the
- 20 -
contentions urged by the petitioners viz., that the Lok Adalat compromise was entered into forcibly
by the petitioners and that the respondents have not paid the amounts due to the petitioners in
terms of the compromise have been rejected by this Court. It is also significant to note that having
accepted the Lok Adalat award and having challenged the same and having failed, the only claim
available to the petitioners is with regard to non-payment of the amounts due to them in terms of
the Lok Adalat award and the said question is still pending adjudication before the Executing court.
Under these circumstances, merely because certain amounts are alleged to be due from the
respondents, who have allegedly not complied with the terms and conditions of the Lok Adalat
award, the said circumstance cannot be made the basis to enable the petitioners to challenge the
acquisition proceedings.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/181548418/ 11
K.Nanjunda Reddy vs The State Of Karnataka on 16 February, 2023
(d) The contentions urged by the petitioners as regards illegal invocation of the urgency clause in
Section 17 in order to contend that the acquisition proceedings are vitiated is clearly misconceived
and untenable in the facts and circumstances of the instant case; undisputedly, the
- 21 -
petitioners accepted the acquisition notifications, proceedings and the possession having been taken
by them and the sole grievance of the petitioners as long back as in 1992, was to seek reference to
the reference court under Section 18 of the L.A.Act and the matter having been settled before the
Lok Adalat and the challenge to the same having been rejected by this Court as stated supra, the
conduct of the petitioners in not challenging the acquisition proceedings from 1990 onwards till
2017, when the present petitions were filed and having chosen, elected and opted only to seek higher
compensation without challenging the acquisition itself is sufficient to establish that the claim of the
petitioners in the present petitions are barred by the principles of estoppel, acquiescence,
abandonment and waiver.
(e) The contention of the petitioners that the acquisition is vitiated on account of non-utilisation of
the subject lands for the purpose for which they were acquired is also devoid of merit in the light of
the well settled principle of law as held by the Apex Court and this Court in several judgments to the
effect that once land is acquired
- 22 -
and stands vested in the authorities, the land losers become persona non grata and it is not open for
the person to seek restoration of the land either on the ground that the original public purpose has
seized or that the land cannot be used for any other purposes, as held by the Apex Court in the case
of Sulochana Chandrakant Galande vs. Pune Municipal Transport - (2010) 8 SCC 467; under these
circumstances, even this contention of the petitioners cannot be accepted.
12. As stated supra, though several judgments have been relied upon by the petitioners, in view of
the findings recorded above in the facts and circumstances of the instant case, the said judgments
would not be applicable and consequently, the same are not discussed in detail.
13. For the foregoing reasons, the writ petition is hereby dismissed.
