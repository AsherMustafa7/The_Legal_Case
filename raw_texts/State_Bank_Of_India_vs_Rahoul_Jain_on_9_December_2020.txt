ORDER
This application has been filed for rejection of the plaint on the ground of territorial jurisdiction as
well as in terms of Section 34 of SARFAESI Act and Section 18 of Recovery of Debts and Insolvency
Act.
2. This application has been taken mainly on the ground that the suit has been filed in collusion
between the father and son to non-suit the action taken by the State Bank of India in consort with
the Bank which has already issued a possession notice on 16.11.2019.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ A.No.2224 of 2020 in
3. Before dealing with the application, this Court is inclined to record the brief facts of the plaint and
prayer sought in the suit.
4. It is the contention of the learned counsel for the plaintiff that the first defendant being the father,
engaged in the business of manufacturing of M/s. Kiran Global Chem Limited, the plaintiff was
looking after the premises for his family and business. The first defendant offered to rent the
plaintiff a commercial space that is the suit property and entered into a lease agreement dated
30.03.2013 with the first defendant and using the subject property as residential property premises
for running the corporate office of M/S.Capricorn Food Products India Limited. The lease was
originally entered for a period of 11 months in subsequent to be entered at the end of incident.
Hence, it is the contention of the learned counsel for the plaintiff that the plaintiff is in possession of
the above property as a lessee of the first defendant. The first defendant in order to expand his
business, raised more than Rs.100 crores from the second defendant to fifth defendant bank and to
secure the loans, the first defendant has executed mortgage and pledged all his
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ A.No.2224 of 2020 in shares, accounts receivable etc., of the
M/S.Kiran Global Chem ltd., in favor of the second defendant to fifth defendant. In the year 2017,
there was a family arrangement between the first defendant on one side and family members on the
other side. The settlement agreement dated 25.10.2017 was entered between the first defendant,
family members and plaintiff and the first defendant agreed to release the properties from the
clutches of the defendants 2 to 5 and also agreed to execute a settlement deed in favour of the
plaintiff. However, the first defendant has defaulted in payments and not recovered or redeemed the
mortgages. Hence, the suit, seeking direction to direct the first defendant to redeem the subject
properties from the second defendant to the fifth defendant and consequently, to direct the first

State Bank Of India vs Rahoul Jain on 9 December, 2020
defendant to come forward and register the Settlement Deed dated 03.11.2017 and other reliefs.
5. At this stage, the application has been taken out by the Bank mainly on the ground that the suit
has been filed in collusion to defeat the rights of the consortium banks, the State Bank and the other
bank and the property has been mortgaged in the year 2009 for more than
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ A.No.2224 of 2020 in Rs.128,45,69,581.34/-, the loan has also
become NPA and the possession notice is also issued and possession also taken. At this stage, the
suit has been filed to defeat the rights of the bank from further proceedings for bringing the property
for sale.
6. It is contended by the learned counsel for the respondents that the present suit is filed for specific
relief against the first defendant herein and it is not against the consortium of banks. The suit has
been filed to enforce the agreement entered between the first defendant and family members and no
way connected with the enforcement of security interest or mortgage etc. Therefore, the suit cannot
be non-suited either under Section 34 of the SARFAESI Act and Section 18 of the Debt Recovery Act
and it is also contended that the plaintiff is in the possession of the property as lessee and continued
his possession. Hence, it is contention that the suit is not barred by any other law. It is also stated in
the counter that the plaintiff cannot have any remedy either under Section 17 and 18 of the RDDBFI
Act nor SARFAESI Act. The relief provided under Section 17 is not exhausted and the same cannot
be https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ A.No.2224 of 2020 in expanded. Hence, prayed for dismissal.
7. Mr.M.L.Ganesan, learned counsel appearing for the applicant submitted that the entire suit has
been filed only to prevent the bank from bringing the property for sale. Admittedly, the loan amount
is more than Rs.128 crores. The loan has been borrowed not only from the State Bank of India but
also other four banks and declared as NPA and it is the contention that Rule nos.8 and 7 of Security
Interest Rules 2012, make it clear that whenever the property is brought for sale, the encumbrance
has to be disclosed by the bank. The encumbrance includes pendency of the suit. When the property
has been subject matter of any suit and the same is disclosed, it is very difficult for the bank to bring
the property for sale. Only to take advantage of such rule, the present suit has been filed as if, its no
way connected with the mortgaged property or enforcing a securities by the bank. A clear drafting
made in the pleadings to maintain the suit, to defeat the very object of the SARFAESI Act and
recover the huge due from the first defendant. Hence, it is the contention that the suit has to be
rejected in entirety. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ A.No.2224 of 2020 in
8. Whereas, the learned counsel Mr.Vinay Mehta, submitted that the suit has nothing to do with the
enforcement of security rights and admittedly, it is his contention that from the year 2013 onwards,
the plaintiff is running a Company in the name of M/S.Capricon Food Products India Limited, and
its corporate office is situated in the suit property and the above property was taken on lease in the
year 2013 and when the settlement has reached between the first defendant and family members
wherein, the first defendant agreed to settle the entire property of the first defendant to the plaintiff.
It is the duty of the first defendant to redeem the mortgages and make the properties free of
encumbrance. As the first defendant has failed to clear the mortgages and failed to execute the
settlement deed as agreed between them, the suit has been filed only to enforce the agreement, for
direction to register the settlement deed and not to prevent the bank from enforcing the mortgage

etc. Hence, it is the contention that since the plaintiff is in possession of the property, the rights
cannot be defeated without giving an opportunity. Therefore, he prays for dismissal of the
application. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ A.No.2224 of 2020 in
9. I have perused the entire materials. It is not in dispute that the plaintiff is the son of the first
defendant. It is also not in dispute that the father of the plaintiff namely first defendant has availed
loans from various Banks namely State Bank of India, IDBI Bank, Axis Bank and Karur Vysa Bank.
The amount due as on date is more than Rs.128 crores. The above allegation is not even disputed by
the plaintiff. It is also not disputed that not only the suit property but the other properties have been
mortgaged. The State Bank being the consortium of the other bank have issued possession notice on
16.11.2019 and possession also taken and sale notice also issued on 08.07.2020. It is the contention
of the plaintiff that the suit property was leased to him in the year 30.03.2013. It is an admitted fact
that the properties have been mortgaged and the title deeds have been deposited on 12.10.2013.
Now, it is the contention of the plaintiff that there was an earlier lease dated 31.03.2013. It is to be
noted that the very plaint itself indicate that from the year 2009, the father has availed a huge loan
from the various banks. Therefore, the contention that he was inducted as a tenant in respect of
subject property, there was no reason as to why the registered deed of
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ A.No.2224 of 2020 in lease was not registered at the relevant
point of time. It is also to be noted that it is the main contention of the plaintiff that as per the
memorandum of understanding between the family members, entire property was settled and the
father namely first defendant had agreed to clear all the loans borrowed by him.
10. Much reliance has been placed on the family agreement between the father and son dated
21.05.2017. It is to be noted that the agreement came into existence much after the property had
been mortgaged with the bank and mere perusal of the agreement dated 25.10.2017 makes it clear
that it created rights in praesenti not only in respect of movable properties but also immovable
properties and shares etc. There were persons claiming right on the basis of the agreement. This
Court is of the view that such right cannot be claimed by a mere unregistered document, which is
inadmissible in the eye of law. It is to be noted that the subject property is admittedly an immovable
property. The main contention of the plaintiff is that the property has been settled and he has been a
tenant of the same property for many years. When a https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ A.No.2224
of 2020 in person contends that the property has been settled by way of an agreement, the
agreement will not come to the aid of the plaintiff since it has not been registered. Even the
contention of the plaintiff that the agreement of lease was in existence much prior to the mortgage,
it is to be noted that as per Section 17 of the SARFAESI Act, such dispute also can be decided only by
the DRT not by the Civil Court. Section 17(4) (A) has been inserted by the Act 44 of 2016. Wherein
the same clearly indicates that where any person claims any lease hold right upon the secured asset
the debt recovery tribunal has jurisdiction to examine the lease or existence of tenancy.
11. In such view of the matter, this Court is of the view that when the agreement itself appears to be a
created one particularly between the father and son, where the father have a huge outstanding
amount payable to the consortium of banks, the question of settling the property by unregistered
deed in favour of the son is also highly improbable. Moreover, merely because no relief claimed
against bank, it cannot be stated that the suit is maintainable. Mere clever and astute

State Bank Of India vs Rahoul Jain on 9 December, 2020
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ A.No.2224 of 2020 in pleadings, cannot be permitted to defeat
the very object of the Act, which was enacted to protect interest of the secured credit. If such suit is
allowed to continue merely on the ground that no reliefs whatsoever sought against the bank, the
pendency of the suit will have a serious impact on the banks while bringing the property for sale.
Since the Security Interest Rules also mandate that all the encumbrance should be disclosed at the
time of sale, the encumbrance includes pendency of the suit also. In such view of the matter, if the
pendency is allowed, prospective buyers will always be reluctant to purchase the property.
Ultimately, the sufferers are only secured creditors in realising the amount. As such, the suit has
been filed to defeat, the very purpose of the Act namely SARFAESI Act in realising the debts by
taking action against the secured assets, I am of the view that the suit is certainly barred by law.
12. Accordingly, the application is allowed and the suit is rejected.
