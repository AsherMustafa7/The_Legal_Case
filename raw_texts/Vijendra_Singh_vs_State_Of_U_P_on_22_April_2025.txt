Vijendra Singh vs State Of U.P. on 22 April, 2025
4. The facts of the case are that initially after lodging of the FIR the applicant had challenged the
same in Criminal Misc. Writ Petition No.2023 of 2021 (Vijendra Singh Vs. State of U.P. and 3
others) in which vide order dated 16.3.2021, the arrest of the applicant who was the petitioner
therein was stayed by a Division Bench of this Court till the next date of listing or till submission of
police report under Section 173(2) Cr.P.C. whichever is earlier. The said order reads as under:-
"Issue notice to respondent No.4 making it returnable within three weeks.
Notice be sent through registered post.
Steps be taken within a week.
Let this petition be listed on 19.04.2021.
It is alleged that based on some audio, an F.I.R. against the petitioner has been
registered without even verifying as to whether the voice in the audio is of the
petitioner. The F.I.R. is otherwise registered by the clerk of the District Magistrate
and not by the District Magistrate himself.
The audio may have been created at the instance of those against whom the
petitioner contested the prosecution case and the accused therein were convicted as
the petitioner is working as Special Public Prosecutor.
It is also alleged that no reference of any case or party has been given in which the
petitioner had demanded the money.
Keeping in mind the arguments, we find a prima-facie case in favour of the
petitioner.
Till the next date of listing or submission of police report under Section 173(2)
Cr.P.C., whichever is earlier, the petitioner shall not be arrested pursuant to F.I.R.
dated 12.02.2021 in Case Crime No. 82 of 2021 under Section 13(1) of Prevention of
Corruption Act, 1988, Police Station- Cantt., District Gorakhpur provided petitioner
shall cooperate with the investigation."
5. Thereafter the applicant had filed a Criminal Misc. Anticipatory Bail Application U/s 438 Cr.P.C.
No.5710 of 2024 (Vijendra Singh Vs. State of U.P.) in which interim protection was granted to him
vide order dated 15.7.2024 whereby he was granted anticipatory bail by a coordinate Bench of this
Court. The said order reads as under:-
"1. Heard Mr. Rajeev Kumar Singh, the learned counsel for applicant and the learned
A.G.A. for State.
2. Perused the record.

Vijendra Singh vs State Of U.P. on 22 April, 2025
3. This application for anticipatory bail has been filed by applicant-Vijendra Singh
seeking his enlargement on anticipatory bail in Case Crime No. 82 of 2021 under
Section 13 (1) of Prevention of Corruption Act 1988, Police Station- Cantt.,
District-Gorakhpur, during the pendency of trial i.e. Special Trial No. 1299 of 2021
(State Vs. Vijendra Singh) under Section 13 (1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act,
Police Station- Cantt., District-Gorakhpur,
4. Record shows that an F.I.R. dated 12.02.2021 was lodged by first
informant-Rakesh Pandey, Litigation Clerk and was registered as Case Crime No.
0082 of 2021 under Section 13 (1) of Prevention of Corruption Act 1988, Police
Station- Cantt., District-Gorakhpur. In the aforesaid F.I.R. applicant Vijendra Singh,
who at that time was working as ADGC/Special Public Prosecutor, has nominated as
solitary named accused.
5. Gravamen of the allegations made in the F.I.R. is to the effect that applicant is
alleged to have demanded a sum of Rs.25,000/- to 50,000/- for securing the
acquittal of the accused in Special Trial No. 79 of 2014 under Section 376, 323, 504,
506 I.P.C., Sections 5/6 POCSO Act and Section 3 (2) 5 SC/ST Act, Police Station,
Belghat, District, Gorakhpur.
6. After aforementioned F.I.R. was lodged, Investigating Officer proceeded with
statutory investigation of aforementioned case crime number in terms of Chapter XII
Cr.P.C. Upon completion of investigation, he ultimately submitted the police report
in terms of Section 173 (2) Cr.P.C i.e. charge sheet dated 09.08.2021 against
applicant whereby applicant has been charge-sheeted under Section 13 (1) of
Prevention of Corruption Act. After submission of police report, cognizance was
taken upon same by the concerned Special Judge in exercise of jurisdiction under
Section 190 (1) (b) Cr.P.C. Resultantly, Special Case No. 1299 of 2021 (State Vs.
Vijendra Singh) under Section 13 (1) of Prevention of Corruption Act, Police Station
Cantt. District-Gorakhpur came to be registered in the Court of Special Judge (Anti
Corruption Act) Court No.1/Additional District and Sessions Judge, Gorakhpur.
7. Attention of the Court was then invited to the order sheet of aforementioned
Special Sessions Trial, copy of which has been brought on record as Annexure 10 to
the affidavit filed in support of this application for anticipatory bail and on basis
thereof, it is urged by the learned counsel for applicant that neither non-bailable
warrant has been issued against applicant nor coercive process has been adopted by
court below to secure the custody of applicant.
8. It is then contended by the learned counsel for applicant that Special Sessions Trial
No. 79 of 2014 was ultimately decided on 08.02.2021 resulting in the acquittal of the
accused whereas the F.I.R. giving rise to present criminal proceedings has been
lodged on 12.02.2021. On the above premise, he therefore submits that cause of
action for initiating present criminal proceedings stood vanished on the date of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/147434682/ 3
Vijendra Singh vs State Of U.P. on 22 April, 2025
lodging of the F.I.R.
9. Even otherwise, applicant is a man of clean antecedents inasmuch as he has no
criminal history to his credit except the present one. The police report (charge-sheet)
in terms of Section 173 (2) Cr.P.C. has already been submitted, therefore, the entire
evidence sought to be relied upon by the prosecution against applicant stands
crystallised. However, upto this stage, no such incriminating circumstance has
emerged on record necessitating the custodial arrest of applicant during the
pendency of trial. The custodial arrest of applicant is, therefore, not absolutely
necessary for conducting trial. Referring to internal page 2 of the Bail Rejection
Order passed by court below, the learned counsel for applicant submits that except
for hearsay evidence no such clinching and reliable evidence has emerged against
applicant, on the basis of which it can even be prima facie said that offence under
Section 13 (1) of Prevention of Corruption Act is made out against applicant. On the
above premise, the learned counsel for applicant submits that liberty of applicant be
protected by extending the benefit of anticipatory bail in his favour. In case the
applicant is granted the benefit of anticipatory bail, he shall not misuse the same and
shall co-operate with the trial.
11. Per contra, the learned A.G.A. has vehemently opposed the present application for
anticipatory bail. He submits that applicant is a named and charge-sheeted accused
therefore no indulgence be granted by this Court in his favour. Referring to the
judgement of Apex Court in P. Chidambaram Vs. Directorate of Enforcement, AIR
2019 SC 4198, he submits that exercise of jurisdiction under Section 438 Cr.P.C.
should be done in rare cases. No exceptional circumstance has emerged so as to grant
anticipatory bail to applicant. As such, this application for anticipatory bail is liable to
be rejected. However, the learned A.G.A. could not dislodge the factual and legal
submissions urged by the learned counsel for applicant with reference to the record
at this stage.
12. Having heard the learned counsel for applicant, the learned A.G.A. for State and
upon consideration of material on record, evidence, gravity and nature of offence,
accusations made as well as complicity of applicant, matter requires consideration.
13. Notice on behalf of opposite party-1 has been accepted by the learned A.G.A. He
prays for and is granted four weeks time to file counter affidavit. Applicant will have
one week thereafter to file rejoinder affidavit.
14. List for orders after expiry of aforesaid period.
15. In view of above, in the event of arrest, applicant- Vijendra Singh shall be released
on anticipatory bail in Case Crime No. 82 of 2021 under Section 13 (1) of Prevention
of Corruption Act 1988, Police Station- Cantt., District-Gorakhpur on his furnishing a
personal bond of Rs.50,000/- with two sureties each in the like amount to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/147434682/ 4
Vijendra Singh vs State Of U.P. on 22 April, 2025
satisfaction of concerned Court with the following conditions:-
(i) The applicant shall not directly or indirectly, make any inducement, threat or
promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade her from
disclosing such facts to the Court;
(ii) The applicant shall not leave India without the previous permission of the Court
and if she has passport, the same shall be deposited by her before the S.S.P./S.P.
concerned.
(iii). In default of any of the conditions, the Investigating Officer/Govt. Advocate is at
liberty to file appropriate application for cancellation of anticipatory bail granted to
the applicant. "
6. The said anticipatory bail application was subsequently dismissed in non-prosecution by this
Court vide order dated 27.11.2024. The said order reads as under:-
"1. List revised. No one appears on behalf of the applicant to press this anticipatory
bail application despite. Sri Vaibhav Dutt Ojha, learned counsel for the State is
present.
2. This anticipatory bail application under Section 438 Cr.P.C. has been filed by the
applicant seeking anticipatory bail, in the event of arrest, in Case Crime No. 82 of
2021, under Section 13 (1) Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, Police Station- Cantt.,
District Gorakhpur.
3. Since there is no representation on behalf of the applicant even when the matter
has been taken up in the revised list, the present anticipatory bail application is
dismissed in non prosecution.
4. Interim order, if any, stands vacated.
5. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of."
7. After conclusion of investigation a charge sheet was submitted against the applicant on which the
court concerned took cognizance and summoned him. The proceedings of the said case including
charge sheet, cognizance order and summoning order were challenged before this Court in
Application U/S 482 No.26329 of 2021 (Vijendra Singh Vs. State of U.P.) which was dismissed vide
order dated 20.9.2022 by this Court. The said order reads as under:-
"Heard Sri R.P.S. Chauhan, learned counsel for the applicant, Sri B.B. Upadhyay,

Vijendra Singh vs State Of U.P. on 22 April, 2025
This application u/s 482 Cr.P.C. has been filed by the applicant Vijendra Singh with
the prayer to quash the entire proceedings of Special Trial No. 1299 of 2021 (State vs.
Vijendra Singh) arising out of Case Crime No. 82 of 2021, under Section 13(1) of
Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, Police Station Cantt., District Gorakhpur,
including the charge sheet no. A-10/2021, dated 29.4.2021 as well as cognizance and
summoning order dated 11.8.2021 passed by the Special Judge, Prevention of
Corruption Act, Court No. 1/Additional District and Sessions Judge, Gorakhpur with
further prayer to stay the further proceedings of Special Trial No. 1299 of 2021 (State
vs. Vijendra Singh) arising out of Case Crime No. 82 of 2021, under Section 13(1) of
Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, Police Station Cantt., District Gorakhpur,
including the charge sheet no. A-10/2021, dated 29.4.2021 as well as cognizance and
summoning order dated 11.8.2021 passed by the Special Judge, Prevention of
Corruption Act, Court No. 1/Additional District and Sessions Judge, Gorakhpur.
The prosecution case as per the First Information Report lodged on 12.2.2021 by
Rakesh Pandey, suit clerk (??? ?????) in the office of District Magistrate, Gorakhpur
naming the applicant only as an accused, is that he has been informed by the
Information Department, Gorakhpur that on the social media an audio is viral in
which accused Hamid and the A.D.G.C. Vijendra Singh (the applicant) are talking in
which there is a discussion going on for exonerating the accused in Special Trial No.
79 of 2014, Case Crime No. 62 of 2014, under Sections 376, 323, 504, 506 I.P.C.,
Section 5/6 POCSO Act and 3(2) S.C./S.T. Act and a demand of Rs. 25,000/- to Rs.
50,000/- is being done and it is said that the same may not be disclosed to anyone. It
is further stated that in the judicial system instead of getting justice to the victim the
accused is being favoured which comes within the parameters of corruption. Vijendra
Singh has been appointed by the Department of Justice, Govt. of U.P. as Special
Public Prosecutor for doing pairvi for the victims for which State Government gives
money to him. The said conversation is in pen drive which is being enclosed with the
said application and a direction has been issued to him to get a First Information
Report lodged against Special Public Prosecutor Vijendra Singh under the provisions
of Prevention of Corruption Act. Along with the said application a pen drive is also
enclosed.
The matter was investigated and a charge sheet dated 29.4.2021 has been submitted
against the applicant under Section 13(1) of Prevention of Corruption Act. Copy of the
said charge sheet is annexure no. 9 to the affidavit. The trial court vide order dated
11.8.2021 took cognizance upon the same and summoned the accused. Copy of the
order sheet of the trial court is annexure no. 10 to the affidavit.
Learned counsel for the applicant argued that the District Magistrate concerned has
not passed any order for lodging of the said F.I.R. It is argued that the audio as is
alleged to have been collected, has not been tested till date and report of Forensic
Science Lab is still awaited. It is argued that voice sample of the applicant has not
been taken till date. It is further argued that the said pen drive has been sent to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/147434682/ 6
Vijendra Singh vs State Of U.P. on 22 April, 2025
F.S.L., Lucknow on 28.4.2021, reference of the same finds place in the case diary. The
said page of the case diary has been placed before the Court which is at page-71 of the
paper book. It is argued that during investigation the applicant was granted
protection by a Division Bench of this Court vide order dated 16.3.2021 passed in
Criminal Misc. Writ Petition No. 2023 of 2021 (Vijendra Singh vs. State of U.P. and 3
others) wherein an order was passed that till next date of listing or submission of
police report under Section 173 (2) Cr.P.C., whichever is earlier, he shall not be
arrested, copy of the said order has been annexed as annexure no. 8 to the affidavit. It
is argued that as such the order taking cognizance and the proceedings are bad in
law. There is no evidence whatsoever to indict the applicant in the present case. It is
further argued while placing para 4 -5 of the supplementary affidavit dated 22.2.2022
that the applicant is a public servant and as such sanction under Section 19 of
Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 is needed for his prosecution. It is argued that the
present application u/s 482 Cr.P.C. be allowed and the prayer as prayed therein be
granted.
Per contra, learned State counsel opposed the prayer of the present application and
the arguments of learned counsel for the applicant. It is argued that from perusal of
the F.I.R. offence is disclosed. It is further argued that although charge sheet in the
matter has been submitted but in the said charge sheet itself it is stated that the
proceedings for taking voice sample of the accused and its comparison with the audio
clip is pending. It is further mentioned therein that pen drive has been sent to the
F.S.L., Luknow and later on after fixing of date appropriate action will be taken and
proceedings will be concluded and other relevant proceedings will be done soon. It is
further stated that investigation is continuing.
Learned State counsel has argued that since investigation is still continuing the
present application u/s 482 Cr.P.C. is not maintainable. Report of the F.S.L. is still
awaited, after which the Investigating Officer will take a call on the question of taking
voice sample of the accused and sending it for comparison. It is argued that from
perusal of the material collected during investigation it cannot be said that no offence
is made out. It is further argued that in so far as the question of sanction is
concerned, since the investigation is under progress proper care shall be taken for it
as and when needed. It is argued that the present application is devoid of any merit
and deserves to be dismissed.
After having heard learned counsel for the parties and perusing the records, it is
evident that the applicant is named in the F.I.R. The audio clip has been sent to the
F.S.L., Lucknow for its testing. The investigating Officer states in the charge sheet
that proper steps for collecting voice sample of the applicant and sending it for
comparison with the audio collected, shall be done later on. The investigation is
stated to be still pending. Since the investigation is still pending, the applicant cannot
say that there is no evidence whatsoever against him. There may be chances of
collection of further evidence in the matter. It cannot be said that at this stage no
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/147434682/ 7
Vijendra Singh vs State Of U.P. on 22 April, 2025
offence is made out. As per the settled principles of law criminal proceedings cannot
be quashed at the very inception.
The present application u/s 482 Cr.P.C. is thus devoid of any merits at this stage and
is hereby dismissed."
8. Against the said order dated 20.9.2022, the applicant preferred a Special Leave to Appeal before
the Apex Court being Special Leave to Appeal (Crl.) No.11035 of 2022 (Vijendra Singh Vs. State of
U.P. and another) in which vide order dated 1.12.2022 notice was issued on the special leave petition
as well as on interim relief. The said order reads as under:-
"Issue notice on the special leave petition as well as on interim relief."
9. The said Special Leave Petition was finally disposed of vide order dated 22.1.2025 by the Apex
Court. The said order reads as under:-
"1. Ms. Tulika Mukherjee, learned counsel submits that the trial is in progress. In
fact, it is at an advance stage and is likely to be concluded in immediate future.
2. Having heard learned counsel for the parties at length, we are of the considered
view that no case for interference is warranted under Article 136 of the Constitution
of India.
3. The Special Leave Petition is disposed of.
4. Pending application(s) shall stand disposed of."
10. In the meantime the trial court proceeded with the trial and prosecution witnesses being eight in
number have been examined and only one prosecution witness remains to be examined and now the
applicant has been summoned. The applicant has now come up with this second anticipatory bail
application.
11. Learned counsel for the applicant submits that the applicant had been attending the trial court
regularly and in his presence and in the presence of his lawyer, the evidence of eight prosecution
witnesses has been examined. The applicant is cooperating in the trial and there is nothing to show
that he is evading the process of law and delaying the trial or avoiding it. It is submitted that now the
applicant has an apprehension of his arrest. The present anticipatory bail application be allowed.
12. Learned counsel for the State has been heard who does not dispute the factual matrix of the
present matter but opposes the prayer for anticipatory bail.
13 After having heard learned counsel for the parties and perusing the records, it is evident that the
applicant was protected initially by an order of Division Bench of this Court during the pendency of
investigation. Subsequently charge sheet was submitted and court concerned took cognizance and

been reported by learned counsel for the State from the order sheet of the trial court which is
