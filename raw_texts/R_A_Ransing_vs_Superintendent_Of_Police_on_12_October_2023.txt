Issue notice, returnable by 31-10-2023.
I have heard at length the rival submissions advanced by the learned counsel appearing for the
parties with regard to the prayer for passing interim order.
Mr. M. Rarry, learned counsel appearing for the respondents fairly submitted that this court had
already considered the submission advanced on behalf of the petitioner as well as the respondents
and passed a detailed order on 09-10-2023 in AB No. 29 of 2023 and other analogous cases. The
learned counsel, accordingly, seeks two weeks' time for filing a short objection to satisfy this court
with regard to the need for custodial interrogation of the accused person.
As prayed for by the learned counsel appearing for the respondents, list these cases again on
31-10-2023 for consideration of the interim prayer.
Mr. N. Ibotombi, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner submitted that the issued
raised in the present Bail Application is the same as those which has been already considered by this
court in AB No.29 of 2023 and that similar interim order may be passed for protecting the rights
and interests of the petitioner.
After hearing the submissions advanced by the learned counsel appearing for the parties, it is hereby
ordered that if the petitioner is arrested by the police in connection with FIR No. 4(09)2023 CB-PS
