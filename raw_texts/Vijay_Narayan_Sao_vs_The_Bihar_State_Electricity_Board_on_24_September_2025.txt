Board now Bihar State Power Holding Company Limited.
Patna High Court L.P.A No.544 of 2022 dt.24-09-2025
2/5
2. The present appeal is directed against the
order dated 28.07.2022 passed in CWJC No. 1433 of 2008
whereby the Hon'ble Single Judge has been pleased to reject the
claim of the appellant holding that the appellant is not entitled to
alter his date of promotion to the post of Section Officer from
01.04.1998
to 22.11.1997.
3. The question of consideration in the present appeal is that the status of warning amounts to the
punishment or not? The limited issue involved in the present case is that in the year 1998 a
departmental proceeding was initiated against the appellant. The appellant was held guilty but the
order of punishment was reduced to warning by the appellate authority and the appointing
authority had affirmed the order of the enquiry officer. The appointing authority after enquiry had
exonerated the appellant from all the charges. The disciplinary authority differed with the
recommendation of the enquiry officer and had held that the appellant is guilty and awarded him
punishment of withholding of three increments.
4. Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the appellant had preferred an appeal before the
appellate authority and the appellate authority after due consideration of all the facts had been
pleased to set aside the order of the Patna High Court L.P.A No.544 of 2022 dt.24-09-2025
disciplinary authority and had modified the order of the punishment only with a remark of warning.
He further submits that the appellant was eligible for promotion to the post of Section Officer on
22.11.1997 but he has given promotion w.e.f. 01.04.1998.
5. Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the learned Single Judge while considering the
case of the appellant had relied upon the amended provision i.e., Regulation 29 (B) of the Bihar
State Electricity Board Regulation, Patna which came into force on 21.11.1998 and the departmental
proceeding was initiated against the appellant on 04.09.1998 which suggest that on the date on
which the departmental proceeding was initiated against the appellant the said amended provision
i.e., Regulation 29 (B) of the Bihar State Electricity Board Regulation was not in existence. Apart
from that, on the date of eligibility no proceeding was pending against the appellant and the

Vijay Narayan Sao vs The Bihar State Electricity Board on 24 September, 2025
appellant was entitled to the promotion to the post of Section Officer w.e.f. 22.11.1997 instead of
01.04.1998. The appellant has been superannuated from the post in question in the year 2012 itself.
6. Learned counsel for the appellant further submits that the learned Single Judge had wrongly
came to the Patna High Court L.P.A No.544 of 2022 dt.24-09-2025 conclusion that the appellant is
not entitled to alter his date of promotion to the post of Section Officer from 01.04.1998 to
22.11.1997 on the basis of the Bihar State Electricity Board Regulation under Rule 29 (B), as the
same was not in existence on the date of commencement of the departmental proceeding.
7. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of Bihar State Electricity Board on the other hand has
supported the order of the learned Single Judge and submits that the writ Court has passed the
correct order but fairly submits that the regulation on which the learned Single Judge has passed the
order has came into existence from 21.11.1998 and the departmental proceeding was initiated
against the appellant on 04.09.1998.
8. We have heard the counsel for the parties at length and also perused the material available on
record. After a careful examination of all the aspects, we have come to the conclusion that the
appellant is entitled for the promotion w.e.f. 22.11.1997 instead of 01.04.1998, as the Regulation 29
(B) of the Bihar State Electricity Board, Standing Order, was inserted on 21.11.1998 i.e., after the
initiation of departmental proceeding on 04.09.1998.
9. In view of the aforesaid, letter no. 547 dated Patna High Court L.P.A No.544 of 2022
dt.24-09-2025 03.07.2007 and letter no. 1101 dated 19.11.2007 (Annexure 19 & 20 of the present
appeal) by which the Respondent No. 3 has been pleased to reject the application of the appellant
dated 04.06.2007 and 03.10.2007 (refusal for change of date of promotion) is set aside and the
order of learned Single Judge dated 28.07.2022 passed in CWJC No. 1433 of 2008 is also set aside.
10. Accordingly, the present Letter Patent Appeal stands allowed.
