Jodha Singh vs The State Of Bihar on 24 September, 2025
No. 61 of 2025 arising out of Dighwara P.S. Case No. 200 of
Patna High Court CR. REV. No.864 of 2025 dt.24-09-2025
2/8
2024 whereby and whereunder the learned Sessions Judge
cancelled the bail granted to the petitioners by the court of
learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate-II, Saran at Chapra
on different dates.
03. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that
the learned Sessions Judge cancelled the bail of the petitioners
and other co-accused persons mainly on two grounds. The first
ground considered by the learned Sessions Judge was that some
of the co-accused persons concealed their criminal antecedents.
Further consideration by the learned Sessions Judge was that on
05.10.2024
, a prayer was made before the learned ACJM for adding relevant provisions of the Scheduled Castes
and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (hereinafter referred to as 'the SC/ST
Act') but he did not transfer the record to the Special Judge, SC/ST Act, rather he granted privilege
of bail to the accused persons vide orders dated 18.10.2024, 25.10.2024, 26.10.2024 and
30.10.2024, respectively. Learned counsel further submits that when the FIR did not disclose
commission of any offence under the provisions of the SC/ST Act and during the relevant time no
provisions of the SC/ST Act was mentioned or added in the FIR, the learned ACJM passed the
orders considering the facts before it. It is Patna High Court CR. REV. No.864 of 2025
dt.24-09-2025 immaterial that a prayer was pending before the ACJM about incorporation of
provisions of the SC/ST Act in the said case. When no case was registered under any of the
provisions of the SC/ST Act, there was no question of transferring the matter to the learned Special
Judge and as the learned ACJM was having jurisdiction to pass the order, which cannot be said to be
illegal. Learned counsel next submits that further no offence under Section 307 of IPC is made out
against the petitioner since there is no direct, specific, valid or cogent material on record to suggest
the petitioners were involved in the offence in question. Rather there is no material to show that the
petitioners have committed any offence or participated in the alleged occurrence. Therefore, the
order dated 26.06.2025 passed by learned Sessions Judge, Saran at Chapra in Cr. Misc. (Bai
Cancellation) No. 61 of 2025 is erroneous and not sustainable in the eye of law and the same needs
to be set aside against the petitioners.

04. Learned counsel for the State as well as learned counsel appearing on behalf of opposite party
no. 2 vehemently oppose the submission made on behalf of the petitioner. Learned counsel for the
opposite party no. 2 submits that there is no infirmity in the impugned order and the same does not
need any interference by this court. Learned counsel further submits that Patna High Court CR.
REV. No.864 of 2025 dt.24-09-2025 the learned ACJM sat over the matter when prayer was made
for incorporation of the provisions of the SC/ST Act after adding relevant sections. This prayer was
made on 05.10.2024. But thereafter in undue haste on 18.10.2024, 25.10.2024, 26.10.2024 and
30.10.2024, the petitioners were granted bail by the learned ACJM. The learned Sessions Judge
took note of this fact and set aside the aforesaid orders granting bail to the petitioners and others.
Learned counsel further submits that moreover while granting bail to the petitioners, the learned
ACJM did not consider the injuries and commission of offence under Section 307 of IPC. Therefore,
the orders of the learned Sessions Court could not be said to be erroneous. Learned counsel further
submits that the learned Sessions Court also granted liberty to the petitioners to surrender before
the learned Special Judge, SC/ST and to make prayer for regular bail. Considering all the facts and
circumstances, the impugned order could not be said to be erroneous or illegal.
05. I have given my thoughtful consideration to the rival submission of the parties and perused the
record.
06. It is apparent that the present case before this Court is one such case where new offences have
been added in the FIR and bail granted to the petitioners was cancelled. The Patna High Court CR.
REV. No.864 of 2025 dt.24-09-2025 Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Pradeep Ram v. State of
Jharkhand, (2019) 17 SCC 326, has taken a view that if some serious offence comes to be added
subsequently and prayer is made on behalf of prosecution for cancellation of bail granted to such
person for some charges/offences, which were of less serious nature, such person can be taken into
custody after cancellation of his bail. But the same would depend on the facts and circumstances and
nature of subsequent offences. The learned ACJM granted bail to the petitioners when there was no
mentioning of any offence committed under provisions of the SC/ST Act. Subsequently, the offences
under Sections 3(1)
(r)/3(2)(va) of the SC/ST Act were added. Already the FIR was registered under Sections 147, 341,
323, 324, 325, 307, 504, 506/34 of IPC. Further incorporation of the offences under the provisions
of 3(1)(r)/3(2)(va) of the SC/ST Act would not said to be addition of an offence serious/heinous than
Section 307 of IPC.
07. Sections 3(1)(r) and 3(2)(va) of the SC/ST Act read as under:
"3. Punishments for offences atrocities.--3 (1) Whoever, not being a member of a
Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe,--............................
...............................................
(r) intentionally insults or intimidates Patna High Court CR. REV. No.864 of 2025
dt.24-09-2025 with intent to humiliate a member of a Scheduled Caste or a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/66513004/ 3
Jodha Singh vs The State Of Bihar on 24 September, 2025
Scheduled Tribe in any place within public view;
............................................... shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be
less than six months but which may extend to five years and with fine.
(2) Whoever, not being a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe,--
(va) commits any offence specified in the Schedule, against a person or property, knowing that such
person is a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe or such property belongs to such
member, shall be punishable with such punishment as specified under the Indian Penal Code (45 of
1860) for such offences and shall also be liable to fine;"
Evidently the subsequent addition of offences under provisions of SC/ST Act cannot
be said to be graver than the offence under Section 307 of IPC.
08. It is evident that while considering the prayer for bail, the learned ACJM was empowered to
grant bail to such persons in a situation which was in existence before him. Therefore, subsequent
incorporation of offences under Sections 3(1)(r)/3(2)(va) of the SC/ST Act notwithstanding, the
previous Patna High Court CR. REV. No.864 of 2025 dt.24-09-2025 grant of bail could not be
faulted.
09. Another aspect which has been stressed by the learned Sessions Judge in the impugned order is
that the application for addition of offences under the provisions of the SC/ST Act has been pending
before the learned ACJM. But the learned ACJM not proceeding in the matter for disposal of the
said application, could not take away the substantive rights which have accrued to the petitioners.
Even the perusal of the relevant portion of the FIR does not show that any inference could have been
drawn about commission of offence under the provisions of the SC/ST Act. Apparently, the
informant is not a person belonging to the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (SC/ST)
category. There are no details about the persons who are the victims that they belong to the SC/ST
category. In these circumstances, the learned ACJM proceeded on the basis of material before it and
hence, granting bail to the petitioners was just and proper. Therefore, I am of the opinion that the
learned Sessions Judge while interfering with the bail granted to the present petitioners and
ordering for cancellation of the bail granted to the petitioners, committed an illegality. Hence, the
order dated 26.06.2025 could not be sustained and the same is set aside so far as the petitioners are
concerned.
Patna High Court CR. REV. No.864 of 2025 dt.24-09-2025
10.Accordingly, the present criminal revision petition stands allowed.
