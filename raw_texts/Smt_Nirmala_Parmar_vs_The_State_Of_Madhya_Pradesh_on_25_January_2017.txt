Smt.Nirmala Parmar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25
January, 2017
In Deepak V. State of M.P., 1994 Cri. LJ 767, the deceased girl was
threatened with defamation, if she refused to have sexual intercourse with two
accused. Soon thereafter she committed suicide leaving a suicidal note. It was
observed that the act of the accused can be a cause for commission of suicide
but this is not sufficient for prosecution; the prosecution has to show the
accused intended such a result. Accepting the plea that the act of the accused
might have been a reason for committing suicide but the same did not constitute
abatement within the meaning of Section 306 read with Section 107 of the IPC.
It was held "neither there was any intention nor any positive act on the part of
the accused to instigate her or aid her in committing suicide. The two accused
persons, therefore, cannot be held guilty of the offence under Section 306 of the
I.P.C. and their conviction on that count by the trial Court, is liable to be set
aside."
In the case of Sanju @ Sanjay Singh Sengar Vs. State of Madhya
Pradesh, 2002*, the deceased had returned from her in laws house and told her
brothers and acquaintances that the appellant(brother in law) had threatened and
abused her by using filty language. The deceased had visited the house of his in
law on 25.07.1998 and committed suicide on 27.07.1998. In these facts it was
held that the fact that deceased had committed suicide on 27.07.1998 would
itself clearly point out that it is not the direct result of the quarrel that took place
on 25.07.1998 when it is alleged that the appellant had used abusive language
and had also told the deceased to go and die.

Allegedly, 19 calves were recovered from Basiram and Sanjay and
two other persons on 29/12/2016 while they were being taken towards

The complicity of the petitioner is based on the disclousre statement

procured the calves from the present petitioner. Apart the disclosure
statement there is no connecting evidence against petitioner.
Though prayer for bail is opposed by the learned Panel Lawyer,
however, considering the nature of allegation against petitioner and the fact
that apart the disclosure statement there is no connecting evidence against
him, without further commenting on the merits of the case, it would be
appropriate to enlarge the petitioner on bail.
Accordingly, the petition is hereby allowed and it is directed that on

M.Cr.C. Nos.11509/2016 and 11512/2016 25/01/2017 Shri S.K. Meena, learned counsel for the
petitioners. Shri Pankaj Wadhwani, learned Govt. Advocate for respondent/State. As the common
questions of law and facts are involved in these two petitions (M.Cr.C. Nos. 11509/2016 and
11512/2016). Therefore, they have been heard analogously and are being disposed of by this
common order. The main order is being passed in M.Cr.C. No. 11509/2016.
The petitioner by way of this petition preferred under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 (for short 'The code') prays for quashment of FIR dated 21/06/2009 in Crime No.
185/2009, registered at police station Jawad District Neemuch, concerning offences under Sections
420, 467,468,471,109/120-B of the IPC at the instance of Chief Executive Officer, Jawad 'Janpad
Panchayat Jawad' District Neemuch, complaining that as many as 42 persons procured
appointment to the post of 'Samvida Shala Shikshak' Grade-II and Grade-III by submitting false,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99656824/ 8
Smt.Nirmala Parmar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 January, 2017
forged and fabricated documents regarding their qualification in computer.
Earlier, the prayer for quashment of FIR was made by a number of persons arrayed as co-accused
and a coordinate bench of this Court vide a common order dated 18/10/2016 passed in M.Cr.C. No.
136/2016, was pleased to allow the petitions of as many as 10 persons, particularly, on the ground
that in identical facts and circumstances, another coordinate Bench of this Court, vide order dated
09/09/2015 passed in M.Cr.C. No. 6151/2015 (Anil S/o Rajmal Jain Vs. State of M.P.) has allowed
identical prayer for quashment of FIR.
The order passed in M.Cr.C. No. 6151/2015 runs as under:
"By this M.Cr.C. the applicant has prayed for quashment of the F.I.R. dated
21/06/2009, registered atCrime No.185/09 for offence under Sections 420, 467, 468,
471, 109, 120-B of the I.P.C. by Police Station Jawad, District Neemuch.
Counsel for the applicant has vehemently urged the fact that the petition is
completely covered by the order passed by this Court in M.Cr.C. No.8086/14,
whereby the Court has also considered the fact that the prosecution was unfair and
the applicant was alleged to have filed forged documents to the post of Samvida Shala
Shikshak Grade II and III, but there is no incriminating evidence available on record
against the applicant and final order has not been passed and according to the report
of Thana Prabhari dated 04/03/2015. The investigation is still pending and the
challan has not been put up even today after a period of six years and also perusing
the Annexure A/5 by Chief Executive Officer, Jawad it would be clear that the
terminations have been stayed. In view of the decision passed by this Court in Writ
Petiton No.4091/09 and others, whereby the scrutiny report is not found to be in
accordance with the provisions of law and the petitioner is still continuing in service.
02 Counsel for the applicant fully relied on order passed by this Court in M.Cr.C. No.8086/14,
where this Court has held thus:
"3.Counsel for the applicants have vehemently submitted that the prosecution was unfair. In the
complaint the complainant had submitted that the applicants had filed forged documents for the
appointment, but no incriminating evidence is available on record against the applicants and no
final order has been passed and in fact according to the report of the Thana Prabhari dated
04/03/2015 that the investigation is still continuing and therefore, no challan has been put up. It is
also mentioned that 42 applicants were being proceeded and Counsel at this juncture urged that the
other applicants were selected for the post and they are working in the post and the present
applicants are deprived of the same; on the ground of parity, the applicants are also entitled to be
continued in the post.
3 There are no other mala-fides impugned against the applicants and the offence under Sections
420, 467, 468, 471, 109 and 120-B of the IPC, are not made out against them. Hence, Counsel
prayed that the impugned FIR be quashed.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99656824/ 9
Smt.Nirmala Parmar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 January, 2017
4 Per Contra Counsel for the respondent/State has vehemently submitted that it was the CEO, who
was made the complaint and 42 applicants were proceeded against and the documents were seized
according to Janpad Panchayat, but the Investigation Officer did not have any sufficient material
evidence and has prayed for time. Counsel candidly admitted that the investigation is not completed
even today. However, Counsel prayed for dismissal of the petitions. 5 On considering the entire
controversy, it is found that the future of the present applicants cannot be allowed to be placed in
jeopardy in such a fashion and hence I find that the FIR is liable to be quashed. If at all the
Investigating Authority come to a different conclusion, then, they are at liberty to take appropriate
action against the present applicants. However, the present FIR dated 21/06/2009 registered at the
Police Station Jawad, District Neemuch against both the petitioners is hereby quashed."
03 Counsel for the applicant prayed that the FIR in the present case also be quashed.
04 Counsel for the respondent/State in the present case has again failed to give any information
regarding the enquiry report and whether the investigation has been completed and whether the
experience certificate of the present applicant has still been held to be fraudulent.\ 05 On
considering the pendency that criminal proceeding is seriously affecting the future prospects of the
applicant, on grounds of parity alone, the petition is allowed. The ratio laid-down in such a case
M.Cr.C. No.8086/14 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the present case also and it is therefore
directed that FIR dated 21/06/2009 registered at Crime No.185/2009 under Sections 420, 467,
468, 471, 109, 120-B of the IPC by Police Station Jawad, District Neemuch is hereby quashed. The
petition is, therefore, allowed.
06. However, it is made clear that in case, the Investigating Authority comes to different conclusion,
which shall be free to take appropriate action against the present applicant also.
CC as per rules."
It is not disputed by the learned Govt. Advocate that allegations against the petitioners in these two
petitions and against those, who had earlier preferred petitions for quashment of FIR, which came
to be allowed, by this Court, are identical, therefore, the petitioners are having parity with them.
In view of the aforesaid and for the reasons assigned in order dated 09/09/2015 rendered in
M.Cr.C. No. 6151/2015 (Anil S/o Rajmal Jain Vs. State of M.P.) this petition deserves to be and is
hereby allowed.
Consequently, FIR dated 21/06/2009 in Crime No. 185/2009, registered at Police Station Jawad,
District Neemuch, concerning offences under Sections 420, 467,468,471,109/120-B of the IPC is
hereby quashed qua petitioner Abdul Raees Khan (M.Cr.C. No. 11509/2016) and petitioner Smt.
Nirmala Parmar (M.Cr.C. No. 11512/2016) are discharged for the offences under Sections 42,467,

of the IPC and Section 5/6 of the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 .
Heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the case-diary. Allegedly, the prosecutrix,
aged about 16 years, was enticed away by the petitioner and taken to Gujrat. It is further alleged that
she was kept in confinement for around 6-7 months and was also subjected to rape .
Learned counsel for the petitioner has drawn the attention of this Court to the Statement of the
prosecutrix recorded under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, wherein she has stated
that she voluntarily left her parental home because her father wanted to marry her to some person
against her choice for money, therefore, she asked the petitioner, with whom she had acquintance,
to accompany her to Gujrat and thereafter, both of them went to Gujrat and stayed there as husband
and wife. She has also submitted that she is still residing with he petitioner as his wife.
Though prayer for bail is opposed by the learned Govt. Advocate on the ground that as per the
school record she was below 16 years at the time of commission of alleged offence, however, it is
found that in his statement recorded under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the father
of the prosecutrix has not stated anything about the age or date of birth of the prosecutrix, and in
the 'Supurdagi' receipt dated 31/12/2016 her age is stated to be 16 years and 4 ½ months.
Considering the totality of the facts and circumstances of the case, without further commenting on
the merits of the case, it would be appropriate to enlarge the petitioner on bail.
Accordingly, the petition is hereby allowed and it is directed that on furnishing personal bond by
petitioner in the sum of Rs.40,000/- (Rupees Forty Thousand Only), with one solvent surety in the
like amount to the satisfaction of the concerned Chief Judicial Magistrate/Judicial Magistrate First
Class, he shall be released on bail, subject to the condition that he shall make himself available to

dismissed as withdrawn vide order dated 04/11/2016 rendered in M.Cr.C. NO. 10440/2016.
The repeat prayer for bail has been made solely on the ground of delay in trial. It is submitted by the

still trial has not been completed and that there is no likelihood that the trial will be completed in
near future. It is further submitted that minimum imprisonment of 1 year is stipulated under the

Though the prayer for grant of bail is opposed by the learned Govt. Advocate, however, considering
the fact that the petitioner is in custody for more than 8 months and the prosecution has not been
able to examine all its witnesses before the trial Court, it would be appropriate to admit the
petitioner on bail.

Shri G.L. Paliwal, learned counsel for the petitioner. Shri Ajit Kumar Jain, learned counsel for the
respondent. The petitioner feels aggrieved with order dated 02/03/2016 passed by learned Judicial
Magistrate First Class, Indore (Shri Ashutosh Agrawal) in Criminal Case No. 20233/2014, whereby
application submitted by the petitioner/complainant under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 (for short 'The Code') has been rejected.
Criminal Case No. 20233/2014 has been registered on the basis of complaint filed by petitioner-
Dinesh against respondent-Manoj with regard to offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable
Instruments Act, 1881 (for short 'The NI Act').
By way of application under Section 91 of 'The Code', the petitioner sought leave of the trial Court to
take on record an electricity bill issued in the name of Kiran Lalit Raikwar, averring therein that the
same could not be filed earlier because of oversight.
The learned trial Court rejected the application holding that electricity bill has been issued in the
name of Kiran Lalit Raikwar and not in the name of respondent/accused, hence, the same is not
relevant.
The reasons assigned by the learned Magistrate for refusal to take the electricity bill in question on
record cannot be said to be unreasonable. If the petitioner wants to prove that he is residing in the
house of respondent as tenant, necessary evidence in that regard could have been produced,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99656824/ 26

however, the aforesaid bill issued in the name of some other persons may not be considered as
relevant to prove the same.
In view of the aforesaid, no fault is found in the impugned order, therefore, it is not a fit case for
invoking jurisdiction under Section 482 of 'The Code'. Accordingly, this petition is dismissed in

Shri Kshitij Vyas, learned counsel for the respondent/State. Heard finally with the consent of the
learned counsel for the parties.
This is a revision petition under Section 397 of Code of Criminal Procedure (for short "The Code")
challenging the legality, propriety and correctness of order dated 07/10/2016 passed by Special
Judge (Atrocities) Ratlam, whereby charges under Section 341, 147, 363, 364, 506 and 302/149 of
the IPC and under Section 3(2)(V) of the SC/ST(PA) Act,1989 were framed against the petitioners
and co-accused Jitendra Singh @ Lal Singh @ Lala in special Case No. 173/2016.
As per the prosecution case, on 24/03/2016 petitioners and co- accused Jitendra Singh @ Lal Singh
@ Lala had assaulted Sanjay Chouhan(deceased) by kicks and fists due to which he sustained
bruices and swelling all over the body. He was admitted in Rathore Nursing Home, Jawra and was
discharged on the next day i.e. 25/03/2016. Thereafter, he was again taken to Rathore Nursing
Home, Jawra and on being advised, to be taken to Ratlam, he was admitted on 03/04/2016 in a
hospital at Ratlam. Same day he was shifted to CHL Appolo Hospital, Indore, where he breathed his
last on 04/04/2016 around 7:00 A.M. It is submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioners that
vide order dated 07/11/2016 passed in Criminal Revision No. 1410/2016, co- accused Jitendra Singh
@ Lal Singh @ Lala has been discharged with regard to offence under Section 302/149 of the IPC. It
is further submitted that the allegation against petitioners and co-accused Jitendra Singh @ Lal
Singh @ Lala are of identical nature, therefore, they also deserves to be discharged.
Relevant part of order dated 07/11/2016 passed in Cr.R. No. 1410/2016 runs as under:-
"As per prosecution, on 24/03/2016 around 11:00 A.M., Sanjay Chouhan(deceased),
who was coming back to his home on a motorcycle with a crate of beer, was
intercepted by the petitioner and 6 other persons namely- Pintu Banna, Rakesh,
Virendra Singh, Jeevan Singh, Kishore and Karulal. Allegedly, they asked him as to
from where he has procured the beer. It is further alleged, that the petitioner and
other co-accused persons assaulted Sanjay Chouhan(deceased) by kicks and fists; he
was also given stick blow on abdomen by Pintu Banna. Allegedly, thereafter, he was
taken in a jeep to village Nagri, where he was further assaulted. After about two
hours, Virendra Singh and Manish brought him back to his house in a Tavera vehicle.
It is further the case of the prosecution, that as Sanjay Chouhan sustained bruises
and swelling over his body and was complaining of pain, therefore, he was taken to
'Patidar Clinic' at Dhodhar, where he was administered some pain relieving injection
and was further advised to be taken to Rathore Nursing Home, Jawra. Allegedly,
thereafter, Sanjay Chouhan (deceased) was admitted in Rathore Nursing Home,
Jawra and was discharged on the next day i.e. 25/03/2016. On 02/04/2016, Sanjay

Smt.Nirmala Parmar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 January, 2017
Chouhan (deceased) complained of hemoptysis, therefore, he was again taken to
Rathore Nursing Home, Jawra and on being advised, to be taken to Ratlam, he was
admitted on 03/04/2016 in a hospital at Ratlam. Same day he was shifted to CHL
Appolo Hospital, Indore, where he breathed his last on 04/04/2016 around 7:00
A.M. On the basis of report lodged by Ritik Chouhan- the son of the deceased, on
05/04/2016 at Police Station Ringnod, District Ratlam, a case for offence under
Section 302,341,506, 363, 364, 147, 148/149 of the IPC and Section 3(2)(V) of the
SC/ST(PA) Act, 1989 was registered against the petitioners and co-accused Jitendra
Singh @ Lal Singh @ Lala. After usual investigation charge-sheet was filed against
them with regard to offence under Section 147,341,363,364, 302 and 506/149 of the
IPC and Section 3(2)(V) of the SC/ST(PA) Act, 1989.
The learned Trial Court, vide the impugned order, has framed charges for offences
under Sections 302,341,147,148,149,506, 363 and 364 of the IPC and under Section
3(2)(v) of the SC/ST(PA) Act,1989 against the present petitioners and co-accused
Jitendra Singh @ Lal Singh @ Lala.
The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that even if all the allegations made in
the FIR are accepted on its face value, the charge for offence under Section 302 of the
IPC is not made out against the present petitioners. Attention in this regard is drawn
to postmortem report, a copy of which is available from page No. 40 to 45 as well
copy of the report issued by the CHL Apollo Hospital, Indore on 04/04/16, in which,
death summary has been recorded.
Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record. The Doctor who
conducted the postmortem has not found any external or internal injury on the body
of the deceased. He further expressed inability to express any definite opinion
regarding cause of death of Sanjay Chouhan(deceased). Though, the visra was
preserved, however, no poisonous substance has been found in the visra as per report
dated 26/08/2016 issued by Assistant Chemical, Examiner of Regional Forensic
Science, Laboratory, Indore.
Death summary report dated 04/04/2016 issued by CHL Appolo Hospital, Indore
reads as under :-
"Mr. Sanjay Chouhan 40 Yrs. Male, admitted with complaints of cough ad mixed with
blood since 3-00 a.m. on 03/04/16 associated with chest pain. Initially managed at
Rathore Nursing Home, then Ratlam Hospital, where work-up chest X-ray S/o -
Haemothorax with Pneumothorax. Then shifted here for futher management. Patient
had past history of recurrent fever relieved on medication and had history of blunt

with decreased SPO2-80% with O2, Tachycardia with Hypotension. On work-up
CT-chest S/o- Bilateral lung consoidation. Patient was managed with NIPPV, I/V

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99656824/ 31
Smt.Nirmala Parmar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 January, 2017
Inspire of all these measures, patient's condition further deteriorated with persistent
Hypoxemia and Hemoptysis. On 04/04/2016, 6:30 am patient became unresponsive
with bradycardia, CPR done as per ACIS protocal. Inspite of all best possible
measures patient could not be reviewed and declared dead at 7:45 a.m. On
04/04/2016."
Aforesaid report reveals that Sanjay Chouhan(deceased) was suffering from Haemothorax with
Pneumothorax and had a past history of recurrent fever. He was also suffering from persistent
hemoptysis.
Culpable Homicide has been defined under Section 299 of the IPC while Section 302 of the IPC
deals with offence of murder. Causing death by doing an act with intention of causing death or with
the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death or doing an act with a
knowledge that death is likely result of such act amounts to culpable homicide. Culpable homicide
covered within any of the four categories specified in Section 302 of the IPC amounts to murder.
In the instant case on consideration of the p.m. report as well as the death summary report issued by
the CHL Appolo, Hospital, Indore, prima-facie it cannot be said that the deceased has sustained any
external or internal injury which was likely to cause death. Further, it cannot be said that the
petitioner had an intention to cause death of Sanjay Chouhan(deceased) or that he did any act with a
knowledge that by such act he is likely to cause death of Sanjay Chouhan (deceased).
Clearly, necessary ingredients to constitute culpable homicide within the meaning of Section 299 of
the IPC or for that matter to constitute an offence under Section 302/149 of the IPC are totally
missing in the present case. Therefore, prima-facie, charge for offence under Section 302/149 of the
IPC is not made out against the petitioners. The learned trial Court, without adverting to the
aforesaid factual and legal aspects of the case has framed the charge for offence under Section
302/149 of the IPC against present petitioner, which cannot be sustained."
From the aforesaid it is clear that the allegation against the petitioners and co-accused Jitendra
Singh @ Lal Singh @ Lala are of identical in nature. As co-accused Jitendra Singh @ Lal Singh @
Lala has already been discharged for offence under Section 302/149 of the IPC vide detailed
reasoned order, therefore, the petitioners also deserves the same treatment.
Accordingly, this petition is hereby allowed and the impugned order to the extent it relates to the
charge for offence under Section 302/149 of the IPC against the present petitioners is hereby
quashed and the petitioners are discharged for the offence under Section 302/149 of the IPC.
Accordingly, the petition stands disposed of. Certified copy as per rules.

The petitioner has straightaway knocked the doors of this Court by way of petition under Section

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99656824/ 32
Smt.Nirmala Parmar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 January, 2017
under Sections 12,18, 20 and 22 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Voilence Act, 2005 (for
short 'The Act').
Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner has invited the attention of this court to copy
of order dated 06/08/2004, said to have been rendered by Principal Judge, Family Court, Indore in
HMA No. 421/2013, whereby ex-parte decree for divorce was granted in favour of the petitioner. It
is further submitted that in the aforesaid background respondent has no legal right to persue the
remedy provided under Protection of Women from Domestic Voilence Act, 2005.
It is revealed that the petitioner has not yet agitated this issue before the learned Judicial Magistrate
First Class, before whom the petition under Section 12 of 'The Act' has been filed by the respondent.
Had it been so learned Magistrate would have considerd the pleas raised by the petitioner to reach a
conclusion about maintainability of the petition. However, instead of approaching the learned trial
Court with an appropriate prayer, the petitioner has rushed directly to this Court.
Therefore, the petition deserves to be and is accordingly hereby dismissed in limine, however, with a

Ms. Archana Kher, learned counsel for the petitioner. Shri Kshitij Vyas, learned Panel lawyer for
respondent/State. This is a petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for
short 'The Code') praying for quashment of criminal proceedings pending before the Court of Chief
Judicial Magistrate, Rajgarh in criminal case No. 1249/2014, which has arisen from Crime No.
22/2014 registered at Police Station Rajgarh District Rajgarh(Biaora), concerning offences under
Sections 420 and 406 of the IPC, Section 3/7 of the Essential Commodities Act read with Rule 9 of
'M.P. Kerosine Vyapari Anugyapan Aadesh, 1979'.
Relevant facts, briefly stated are, that pursuant to a news item published in daily news paper
'Patrika' dated 27/12/2013, Bhopal, Crime No. 22/2014 was registered against the petitioner, in
Kotwali Rajgarh for offences under Sections 420,468,406 and 471/120-B of the IPC and Section 3/7
of the Essesntial Commodities Act. The matter was investigated. The allegation against the
petitioner is that during April- December, 2013 he as a licensee for distribution of kerosene oil, did
not distribute 1,20,647 liters of kerosene oil to various societies for whom it was procured by him.
The matter was investigated by the Police. In the wake of the complaint the distributorship license of
the petitioner was cancelled by the Collector, against which an appeal was preferred by the
petitioner before the Commissioner, which was allowed on the ground that the petitioner was not
afforded an opportunity of hearing.
After investigation Police submitted a closure report before the competent Magistrate stating that no
offence is made out against the petitioner. The Assistant Supply Officer submitted objections against
the closure report contending that the police has not properly investigated the case and that the
documents filed by the petitioner were taken into consideration.
The learned Magistrate, vide impugned order, was pleased to reject the closure report and to take
cognizance against the petitioner for offence under Sections 420 and 406 of the IPC and Section 3/7
of the Essential Commodities Act read with Rule 9 of 'M.P. Kerosine Vyapari Anugyapan Aadesh,
1979'.
The sole grievance raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner is that learned Magistrate has
taken the cognizance against the petitioner, though, there was no material on record to constitute
the offences alleged against him. It is further submitted that cognizance has been taken against the
petitioner only on the ground that during investigation police has taken into consideration certain
documents submitted by the petitioner with regard to his claim that kerosene oil was properly
distributed by him to the societies. It is submitted that the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate was not
correct in holding that such documents ought not to have been taken into consideration by
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99656824/ 36
Smt.Nirmala Parmar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 January, 2017
Investigating Agency because the same related to the defence of the petitioner. Accordingly prayer
has been made for quashment of criminal proceedings pending before the Court of Chief Judicial
Magistrate, Rajgarh in criminal case No. 1249/2014.
On the contrary learned counsel for the State has opposed the prayer and has submitted that learned
trial Court, on due consideration of relevant material, has taken cognizance against petitioner.
Therefore, the petition deserves to be dismissed.
Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record. Relevant parts of the impugned order
runs as under:-
" iqfyl us bl vk/kkj ij [kkRek izLrqr fd;k gS fd vfHk;qDr dk tks dysDVj }kjk ykbZlasl

The learned Magistrate has rejected the closure report solely on the ground that documents
submitted by the petitioner were taken into consideration by the Investigation Agency, however,
there is nothing in the impugned order to indicate that prima-facie necessary ingredients to
constitute offences under Sections 420 and 406 of the IPC, Section 3/7 of the Essential
Commodities Act and Rule 9 of 'M.P. Kerosine Vyapari Anugyapan Aadesh, 1979' were available.
Therefore, the impugned order cannot be sustained.
Resultantly this petition is allowed and impugned order is hereby set aside with a direction that the
learned Chief Judicial Magistrate will pass a reasoned order on the basis of material available in the
report filed by the police.
The petition stands disposed of, accordingly. Certified copy as per rules.

Shri Mohammad Iqbal Ahmed, learned counsel for the petitioner. Shri Rais Khan, learned counsel
for the respondent. This petition preferred under Section 397 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1973 ( for short 'The Code') read with Section 19(4) of the Family Court Act, 1984 (for short 'The
Act') calls in question the legality, propriety and correctness of order dated 30/07/2016 passed by
Principal Judge, Family Court, Indore in Criminal Case No. 390/2014, whereby the petitioner has
been directed to pay Rs.5,000/- p.m. towards maintenance to respondent-wife under Section 125 of
'The Code'.
It is not a matter of dispute that parties were married to each other on 23/05/2012, however, soon
thereafter matrimonial discord was there, and therefore, respondent-wife started residing away
from the petitioner. She by way of petition under Section 125 of 'The Code' prayed for grant of
maintenance on the ground that she was driven out of the matrimonial home, after being subjected
to cruetly and harassment by petitioner and his parents who used to quarrel with her. It was further
averred that petitioner is gainfully employed and is earning Rs.20,000/- p.m. while respondent has
no source of income.
Learned trial Court on the basis of evidence adduced before it, vide the impugned order, has
directed the petitioner to pay maintenance as stated herein above in para 1.
Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that at the time of marriage the respondent was
employed in a Coaching Center and was earning Rs.6,000/- p.m. Attention of this Court in this
regard is invited to Ex.P/6 hindi transcript of 'Nikahnama' placed by the respondent before the
learned trial Court, in which employment of respondent has been mentioned as 'Coaching'. Further
attention is drawn to exhibit D/1(c), which is a certificate said to have been issued by MABF
Academy, Khazrana, Indore, wherein it is stated that respondent is working as teacher in the school
since last one year and is being paid Rs.6,000/-p.m. Learned counsel for the respondent has fairly
conceaded that respondent is employeed in a Academy as a teacher and is being paid Rs.6,000/-
p.m. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record. Evidence available on record
clearly shows that the respondent is gainfully employed as private teacher and is earning Rs.6,000/-
p.m. On the contrary there is no plausible evidence on record to the effect that petitioner is earning
Rs. 20,000/- p.m., though, from document Ex. D/5 it transpires that monthly income of the
petitioner per the certificate was around Rs. 3563/-. The sum paid towards leave encashment,
shown in this certificate, cannot said to be monthly income of the petitioner. It is further not in
dispute that the petitioner is having an aged mother.
Considering the fact that the respondent is earning Rs.6,000/- p.m. as a private teacher, it cannot be
said that she is unable to maintain herself.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99656824/ 39
Smt.Nirmala Parmar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 January, 2017
The provisions of Section 125 of 'The Code' aim at preventing vagrancy . In the instant case despite
the fact that respondent is in a position to maintain herself and is gainfully employed in the private
school, learned trial Court has awarded maintenance in her favour. Thus, the impugned order, being
against the evidence on record, suffers from pervarsity and therefore, cannot be sustained.
Accordingly, this petition is allowed and impugned order is hereby set aside.

Shri V.P. Bhagwat, learned counsel for the petitioner. This is a petition under Section 482 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 ( for short 'The Code') against order dated 15/11/2016 passed by
XIIth Additional Sessions Judge, Indore in Criminal Revision Nos. 786/2016, 787/2016 and
788/2016, which have been disposed of by a common order.
Vide the impugned order learned revisional Court has declined to interefere in order dated
29/09/2016 passed by learned Magistrate in three different matters bearing Criminal Case Nos.
42718/2014, 42717/2014 and 42719/2014.
Learned Magistrate, vide the three different orders, had rejected the application(s) submitted on
behalf of the petitioner under Section 219 of 'The Code' praying for joint trial of three complaint
cases, registered for offence under Section 138 of the Negotiabele Instruments Act, 1881 (for short
'The NI Act') on the basis of three private complaint preferred against the petitioner by three
different complainants.
Though, the learned Magistrate was of the view that Section 219 of 'The Code' is not applicable in
cases under Section 138 of 'The NI Act', however, the learned revisional Court took the view that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99656824/ 43
Smt.Nirmala Parmar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 January, 2017
Section 219 of 'The Code' is applicable in respect of cases under Section 138 of 'The NI Act' but
concurred with the dismissal of application(s) on the ground that the complainants are different
persons in all the three cases and that Section 219 of 'The Code' conferes a discretion on the Court to
hold joint trial with regard to three offences committed within a period of 12 months together and
that the provisions are not of mandatory nature. Impugned order as well as the order passed by the
learned Magistrate have been challenged before this Court on the ground that in each case the
petitioner shall be required to disclose his defence and if the three cases are tried separately then
disclosure of defence in one case may prejudice him in other cases.
Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and perused the record. Section 219 of 'The Code', which is
relevant for the present purpose, runs as under:
"219. Three offences of same kind within year may be charged together.
(1) When a person is accused of more offences than one of the same kind committed
within the space of twelve months from the first to the last of such offences, whether
in respect of the same person or not, he may be charged with, and tried at one trial
for, any number of them not exceeding three. (2) Offences are of the same kind when
they are punishable with the same amount of punishment under the same section of
the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860 ) or of any special or local law: Provided that, for
the purposes of this section, an offence punishable under section 379 of the Indian
Penal Code (45 of 1860 ) shall be deemed to be an offence of the same kind as an
offence punishable under section 380 of the said Code, and that an offence
punishable under any section of the said Code, or of any special or local law, shall be
deemed to be an offence of the same kind as an attempt to commit such offence,
when such an attempt is an offence."
A bare persual of Section 219 of 'The Code' will reveal that it confers a discretion on the Court to
jointly try three offences of the same kind if the same have been committed by the same accused
within a period of one year. Section 219 of 'The Code' does not confer any right on the accused to be
tried jointly, even if the offences are alleged to have been committed within a span of 1 year.
Provisions of Section 219 of 'The Code' are to facilitate the Court in expeditious trial and to avoid
duplicity, however, if the allegations are different, cause of action is different, the complainant is
different, then joint trial of such offences though, committed within a period of one year, may not
fulfil the desired objective.
The plea that the petitioners shall be prejudiced if the trials are conducted separately, because his
defence will be disclosed, does not hold water because in each of the cases necessary requirements
with regard to offence under Section 138 of 'The NI Act' shall have to seen on the basis of the
evidence adduced in such case and the averments made in the complaint. Obviously, Section 219 of
'The Code' does not confer any right on the accused to be tried in a joint trial.
In view of the aforesaid, no fault can be found with the impugned order. Resultantly, this petition is
dismissed in limine.

Heard learned counsel for the parties on I.A. No.203/2017, an application under Section 389(1)
Cr.P.C. on behalf of the applicant No.1 Mithun @ Ravi for suspension of custodial sentence.
The applicant No.1 has been found guilty for offence under Section 304-B/34 of the IPC, for causing
dowry death of her wife-Poonam, and has been sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life.
Learned Senior counsel appearing on behalf of the applicant has submitted that applications for
suspension of custodial sentence of applicant No.2 Leela Bai and applicant No.3 Mukesh have
already been allowed by this Court. Inviting attention of this Court to para No. 17 of the impugned
judgement, it is submitted that Kusum Bai, who is the mother of the deceased Poonam, has not
stated that petitioner was subjecting the deceased to cruelty or harassment, therefore, the conviction
recorded by the trial Court is not based on proper appreciation of the evidence. It is further
submitted that hearing of the appeal is likely to take time and if the sentence is not suspended then,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99656824/ 55

it shall be rendered infructuous.
On the other hand, learned counsel for the State has opposed the prayer for grant of suspension of
custodial sentence.
After considering the rival submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties and on perusal
of the record including the impugned judgement, this Court is of the view that it is a fit case for
suspension of custodial sentence.
Accordingly, I.A. No. 203/2017 is allowed and it is directed that on furnishing personal bond by the
applicant No.1 Mithun @ Ravi in the sum of Rs.50,000/- (Rs. Fifty Thousand Only) with a solvent

liable to be dismissed without further reference to the Court.
It is submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that due to oversight case could not be

Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that investigation has been completed and charge- sheet
has been filed. It is further submitted there is no apprehension that petitioner will flee away from
the course of justice, if released on bail.
Though the prayer for bail is opposed by the learned Public Prosecutor, however, considering the
allegation against petitioner and other surrounding facts and circumstances of the case, it would be
appropriate to enlarge the petitioner on bail.

amount to the satisfaction of the concerned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Judicial Magistrate, First

Smt.Nirmala Parmar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 January, 2017
that during the incident, Hari Singh and Santosh Bai pelted stones on the deceased while
petitioner-Amar Singh assaulted him by kicks and fists. As per MLC report no external injury was
found. On 12/12/2016 Baje Singh complained of pain and vomiting, therefore, he was taken to

Shock'.
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the only allegation against the petitioner is that he
had assaulted deceased- Baje Singh by kicks and fists. As per postmortem report deceased- Baje
Singh died due to 'Septicemic Shock'.
Though the prayer for bail is opposed by the learned Public Prosecutor, however, considering the
role attributed to the petitioner and other surrounding facts and circumstances of the case, it would
be appropriate to enlarge the petitioner on bail.
Accordingly, the petition is hereby allowed and it is directed that on furnishing personal bond by the
petitioner in the sum of Rs.40,000/- (Rs. Forty Thousand only) with one solvent surety in the like

No. 21/2016 registered at police Station Lalghati, District Shajapur, for offence under Section 420 of
the IPC.
After arguing the matter at length, learned senior counsel for the petitioner seeks leave of this Court

Prayer is granted.
Accordingly, the petition is dismissed as withdrawn with the aforesaid liberty.
(Ved Prakash Sharma) Judge skt 11/01/2017 Shri Piyush Shrivastava, learned counsel for the
petitioner. Shri R.S. Parmar, learned counsel for the respondent/State. This is an application under
Section 438, Cr.P.C for grant of anticipatory bail by petitioner-Laad Singh S/o Hindu Singh, who
apprehends his arrest in Crime No.354/2016 Police Station Maksi, District Shajapur concerning

24 years, wherein it is alleged that she was raped by Goverdhan, Nirbhay Singh, Gyan Singh, Antar
Singh, Laad Singh S/o Maan Singh and two other persons.
It is submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that co- accused Laad Singh S/o Maan Singh
in his disclosure statement made under Section 27 of the Evidence Act has implicated the petitioner,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99656824/ 65
Smt.Nirmala Parmar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 January, 2017
though, the prosecutrix herself has not alleged anything in the FIR in that regard.
Though, the prayer for grant of anticipatory bail is opposed by the learned counsel for the
respondent/State, however, considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case, it would
be appropriate to admit the petitioner to anticipatory bail under Section 438, Cr.P.C.
Therefore, the petitioner has reasonable apprehension for arrest in the matter without considering
the plausible ground.
Accordingly, it is directed that in the event of arrest by Police in the aforesaid case, the petitioner-
Laad Singh S/o Hindu Singh shall be released on bail on his furnishing personal bond in the sum of
Rs.40,000/-(Rupees forty thousand Only) with a solvent surety in the like amount to the
satisfaction of the arresting Officer for his regular appearance before the Police during the

(Ved Prakash Sharma) Judge skt 11/01/2017 Shri K.P. Gangore, learned counsel for the petitioner.
Shri Pankaj Wadhwani, learned Govt. Advocate for the respondent/State. This is a first application
under Section 439, Cr.P.C by petitioner- Santosh, who has been arrested by Police on 27/06/2016 in
Crime No. 142/2014, Police Station Badgonda District-Indore, in connection with offence under
Sections 409, 420, 467,468 and 471/120-B of the IPC .
Heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the case-diary. The allegation against the
petitioner is that he, on his transfer from Gram Panchayat Godar Teh. Depalpur to Gram Panchayat
Avlay as Panchayat Secretary, had withdrawn a sum of Rs. 4.50 Lacs on various dates, which was
misutilised by him in the sense that the amount sanctioned for construction of school building on
Govt. land under 'Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan' was used by him for construction of school on private
land.
Learned counsel for the petitioner has drawn the attention of this Court to the various annexures
filed alongwith the petition and submitted that petitioner had joined at Gram Panchayat Avlay as
Panchayat Secretary and was having authority alongwith the Sarpanch to sign over the cheque and
withdraw money from the account of Gram Panchayat, Avlay, pursuant to which aforesaid amount
was withdrawn from the account of Gram Panchayat, Avlay for construction of school building. Of
course, there may be some fault on his part as regards allegation that he had used this amount for
construction of school building on private land instead of Govt. land. However, there is no allegation
against petitioner about appropriating govt. funds for personal purpose.
Learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that investigation has been completed and
charge-sheet has been filed and that t here is no apprehension that, on being released on bail, the
petitioner shall escape away from the course of justice .

would be appropriate to enlarge the petitioner on bail.

(Ved Prakash Sharma) Judge skt 09/01/2017 Shri Jitendra Sharma, learned counsel for the
petitioner. Shri R.S. Parmar, learned Panel lawyer for respondent/State This is a petition under
Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. praying for quashment of FIR concerning Crime No. 61/2014 registered at
police Station Dewas Gate, District Ujjain, for offence under Sections 34(2) of the M.P. Excise Act,
1915 and under Sections 420, 465, 467,468, 471 & 120-B of the IPC.
The quashment is sought on the ground that the charge-sheet was filed against the co-accused
Baljinder Singh & Shravan Singh, who have been acquitted in the matter by learned Sessions Judge,
Ujjain vide judgement dated 08/04/2015 passed in ST No. 61/2014 .
The learned counsel for the petitioner has drawn the attention of this Court to the disclosure
statement said to have been made by co-accused Baljinder Singh and has submitted that accusation
against the petitioner is based solely on the disclosure statement made by Baljinder Singh to the
effect that vehicle in question in which contraband liquor was being carried, was to be handed over
to the petitioner. It is contended that in view of the aforesaid there is no legaly admissible evidence
against the petitioner.
Per contra, it is submitted by the learned counsel for the State that, so far, charge-sheet has not been
filed against the petitioner. It is furher submitted that considering the nature of material available
with regard to complicity of the petitioner, the Investigating Agency may itself is required to
consider as to whether sufficient grounds are not made out to file charge-sheet, however, that stage
is not yet arrived, therefore, it will be premature to quash the FIR at this stage. Lastly it is submitted
that if, ultimately, charge-sheet is filed, the petitioner can knock the doors of this Court by way of
appropriate petition.
Taking into consideration that a decision with regard to filing of the charge-sheet against the
petitioner is yet to be taken by the Investigating Agency, at this stage, it would not be proper to
quash the FIR of crime No. 61/2014. Resultantly, this petition is dismissed in limine.

passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge, Dewas in Criminal Appeal No. 3800274/2016.
Vide order dated 24/08/2016, the learned Magistrate has directed the petitioner to pay interim
maintenance @ Rs.3,000/- per month for 8 years old daughter and Rs. 4,000/- per month for
respondent-wife, after adjusting Rs. 3,000/- per month already ordered to be paid as maintenance
by Family Court. Learned Magistrate further directed the petitioner to handover the custody of their
daughter Anmai to the respondent. In appeal the learned Appellate Court declined to interfere in the
order passed by the learned Magistrate.

Smt.Nirmala Parmar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 January, 2017
Learned counsel for the petitioner has drawn the attention of this Court to Annexure A/3, which is a
copy of order dated 01/03/2016 passed by learned Magistrate recording wishes of minor girl (Aged
about 8 years) who had expressed to stay with the petitioner-father, who is already having her
custody.
Considering the aforesaid, without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, it would be
appropriate to allow the petitioner to continue with the custody of his minor daughter till the matter
is decided on merits and to that extent, operation of the impugned order is hereby stayed.
As regards maintenance, because the minor daughter will remain in the custody of petitioner,
therefore, he will not be liable to pay interim maintenance @ Rs. 3,000/- per month to respondent
as regards minor daughter. However, as regards respondent, he will pay maintenance as per the
impugned order @ Rs. 4,000/- per month after adjusting the amount of Rs.3,000/- per month,
already ordered by the family Court to be paid, towards maintenance to the respondent.
IA No. 8031/2016 stands disposed of accordingly. IA No. 10280/2016, an application for vacating
stay also stands disposed of in the aforesaid terms.
Matter be listed for consideration of IA No. 9722/2016 after three weeks.
(Ved Prakash Sharma) Judge skt 09/01/2017 Shri R.S. Parmar, learned Panel Laweyr for petitioner
/State. Shri Pankaj Jain, learned counsel for the respondent. State has preferred this petition under
Section 378(3) of Cr.P.C. seeking leave to appeal against judgment dated 11/05/2016 rendered by
Judicial Magistrate First Class, Mahidpur, District Ujjain, in Criminal Case No. 363/2011, whereby
acquittal has been recorded in respect of respondent-Nitin Sharma with regard to offence under
Section 292 of the IPC, primarily on the ground that electronic record/electronic evidence which
was required to be proved by submitting a certificate in terms of Section 65-B of Indian Evidence
Act, was not adduced in evidence before the Court.
The law is well settled that the secondary evidence with regard to electronic record or for that matter
the electronic documents can be admitted, as provided in Section 65-A of the Indian Evidence Act,
only on furnishing of a certificate as required under Section 65-B of the Evidence Act. However, in
the instant case the same was not adduced before the learned trial Court.
Learned counsel for the State has also not disputed that no certificate was adduced by the
prosecution before the learned trial Court.
In the aforesaid premises no fault can be found with the impugned order recording acquittal in
favour of the respondent. Therefore, it is not a fit case for grant of leave to appeal. Accordingly, this
petition is hereby dismissed.

opposed by the learned Public Prosecutor, however, considering aforesaid facts and circumstances,
it would be appropriate to enlarge the petitioner on bail.

Shri M.M. Mishra, learned counsel for the petitioner. This is a petition under Section 407 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973(for short 'The Code') praying for transfer of MJC No. 06/2007
pending before the Court of Judicial Magistrate First Class Khachrod, District Ujjain, (Shri Suresh
Singh Jamra) to any other Court outside Khachrod.
MJC No. 06/2007, has been registered on the basis of petition preferred by respondent-Smt. Rami
Bai, wife of the petitioner, under Section 125(3) of 'The Code' for recovery of interim maintenance
granted in her favour.
The petitioner preferred an application under Section 410 of 'The Code' before the Court of Chief
Judicial Magistrate Ujjain, praying for transfer of MJC No. 31/2013 and MJC No. 06/2007 pending
in the Court of Judicial Magistrate First Class Khachrod, District Ujjain, (Shri Suresh Singh Jamra)
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99656824/ 87
Smt.Nirmala Parmar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 January, 2017
to any other Court outside Khachrod on the ground that all the Judges posted at Khachrod are
prejudiced against him, hence, he reasonably apprehends that justice will not be done to him.
The learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ujjain vide order dated 16/12/2014 (Annexure P/2)
dismissed the application holding that earlier on a request made by the petitioner MJC No. 06/2007
was transferred from the Court of JMFC Khachrod (Shri S.R. Sinam ) to the Court of JMFC
Khachrod (Shri Suresh Singh Jamra) . The learned Chief Judicial Magistrate further found that
allegation made by the petitioner that all the Judges posted at Khachrod are prejudiced against him
is baseless.
Order passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate was challenged by the petitioner by way of revision.
Learned Second Additional Sessions Judge, Ujjain vide order dated 26/10/2015 passed in Criminal
Revision No. 32/2015 declined to interfere in the order passed by the learned Chief Judicial
Magistrate, Ujjain. Therefore, the petitioner has approached this Court under Section 407 of 'The
Code'.
From the record it clearly transpires that pursuant to prayer made by the petitioner, MJC No.
06/2007 was transferred from the Court of JMFC Khachrod (Shri S.R. Sinam) to the Court of JMFC
Khachrod (Shri Suresh Singh Jamra). The prayer for transferring MJC No. 06/2007 outside the
Khachrod was made on the ground that all the Judges posted at Khachrod are prejudiced against
him. The apprehension expressed by the petitioner in this regard appears to be totally baseless.
Simply because certain orders have been passed by the learned Magistrate in recovery proceedings
against the petitioner, it cannot be inferred that the concerning learned Magistrate is prejudiced
against the petitioner or that all the Judicial Officers posted at Khachrod are prejudiced against him.
The grounds putforth by the petitioner for transfer of MJC No. 06/2007 outside the Khachrod are
based on general and omnibus allegations. From the record it transpires that petition for
maintenance preferred under Section 125 of 'The Code' is yet to be decided finally and that even the
recovery proceedings for interim maintenance are going at a slow pace.
In view of the aforesaid no plausable ground is made out to transfer MJC No. 06/2007 outside
Khacrod, therefore, this petition, sans merits, deserves to be and is accordingly, hereby dismissed.

Heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the case diary. Matter relates to alleged
murder of Mukesh and Jitu, who were put to death sometime between 20/07/2016 to 21/07/2016.
As per prosecution, deceased Jitu was working as driver of the truck bearing registration No. MH-
18-AA-9415 belonging to complainant Shreyansh Jain. Co-accused Lokesh and Mukesh were also
employed as co-driver & cleaner of the truck respectively. All the three left with the vehicle on
20/07/2016 and thereafter, Mukesh and Jitu both were found dead.
It is alleged that Lokesh has hatched a conspiracy alongwith Chhotu, Bablu, Deepak, Pappu and
petitioner Salkiya @ Saligram to commit robbery of the goods loaded in the truck and in that
process Mukesh and Jitu were put to death.
Accusation against the petitioner is based on the disclosure statement said to have been made by the
co-accused Lokesh.
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that there is no material available on record to connect
the petitioner with the alleged murder of Mukesh and Jitu, apart from the disclosure statement of
co-accused Lokesh; prima-facie, this evidence is not legally admissible, as on the basis of his
statement no recovery has been made from the possession of the petitioner.
Though the prayer for bail is opposed by the learned Public Prosecutor, however, considering
aforesaid facts and circumstances, it would be appropriate to enlarge the petitioner on bail.
Accordingly, the petition is hereby allowed and it is directed that on furnishing personal bond by the
petitioner in the sum of Rs.40,000/- (Rs. Forty Thousand only) with one solvent surety in the like
amount to the satisfaction of the concerned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Judicial Magistrate, First

Shri Bhaskar Agrawal, learned counsel for the appellant. Shri R.S. Parmar, learned Panel Lawyer for
the respondent/State. Heard learned counsel for the parties on I.A. No.1662/2016, first application
under Section 389(1) Cr.P.C. for suspension of custodial sentence of appellant - Barka.
The appellant- Barka has been convicted under Section 326 of the IPC and has been sentenced to
under go 5 years RI with fine & usual default stipulation.
Learned counsel for the appellant submits that appellant is in jail since 18/12/2014. It is further
submitted that medical evidence suffers from serious anomalies and learned trial Court has not
properly appreciated the evidence while recording the conviction against appellant. It is also

Smt.Nirmala Parmar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 January, 2017
submitted that the appeal is likely to take time and if the sentence is not suspended then, it shall be
rendered infructuous.
Learned counsel for the State has opposed the prayer for suspension of custodial sentence and has
invited the attention of this Court to testimony of Khanda(P.W.1) as well as of Dr. Vijay Bhaisare
(P.W.11) who had examined the injured on 13/11/2014.
On perusal of the record it is found that though there is anomaly regarding the weapon used for
inflicting the injury on the right eye of Khanda (P.W.1), however, as per Dr. Vijay Bhaisare (P.W.11)
he found internal injury on his right eye and lead to total lost eye sight . Therefore, patient was
advised to go for treatment to Delhi.
Considering the nature of injury said to have been sustained by Khanda(P.W.1) in the opinion of this
Court the anomaly with regard to the nature of weapon used to inflict the injury cannot by itself a
ground to suspend the custodial sentence of appellant.
Accordingly, this application deserves to be and is hereby dismissed.

Shri Bhaskar Agrawal, learned counsel for the petitioner. Heard learned counsel for the parties on
the question of admission. This revision petition under Section 397 read with Section 401 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short 'The Code') is directed against order dated 20/06/2016
passed by the Court of learned Principal Judge, Family Court, Neemuch in Case No. 66/2015,
whereby he has been directed to pay interim maintenance under Section 125 of The Code @ Rs.
2,000/- p.m. to respondent-wife.
Impugned order is challenged on the ground that same is not according to the evidence on record. It
is submitted that quantum of the maintenance is on higher side and the petitioner is not in a
position to pay the same. It is also submitted that the respondent has left her matrimonial home on
her own accord without any reason, therefore, petitioner is not liable to pay the maintenance.
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
The object behind grant of maintenance to wife and the yard- stick to be applied to decide the
quantum of maintenance as well as the sustainability of the plea raised by the husband that he does
not have means to pay, have been considered at length by the apex Court in Shamima Farooqui vs.
Shahid Khan, (2015) 5 Supreme Court Cases,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99656824/ 111
Smt.Nirmala Parmar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 January, 2017
705. Considering in the light of the aforesaid dictum of law, it is clear that the petitioner being an
able bodied person cannot be allowed to wriggle out of his legal, social and moral responsibilities to
pay reasonable amount for maintenance to respondent-wife. In the prevailing inflationary situation,
an amount of Rs.2000/- p.m., as interim maintenance allowance for respondent-wife cannot be said
to be excessive or unreasonable nor the petitioner can escape away from his liability to pay
reasonable amount of maintenance simply on the ground that he has a low income. Therefore, it
cannot be said that impugned order suffers from any illegality, incorrectness and impropriety.
In view of the aforesaid, this petition, sans merits, deserves to be and is accordingly, hereby
dismissed.
