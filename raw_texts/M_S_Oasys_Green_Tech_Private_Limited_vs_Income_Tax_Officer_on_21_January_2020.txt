COMMON ORDER
Heard Mr.Suhrith Parthasarathy, learned counsel for the petitioner and Mrs.Hema Muralikrishnan,
learned Senior Standing Counsel for the respondent.
2. An order of re-assessment dated 28.06.2018 for Assessment Year (AY) 2010-11 passed in terms of
the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (in short ‘Act’) has been challenged. The main ground on
which the impugned order is assailed is that the entity known as M/s.OAS Digital Infrastructures
Private Limited to whom notice under Section 148 of the Act was issued and based upon which the
impugned order has been passed, did not exist at the time of issuance of notice and passing of the
impugned order.
3. The sequence of relevant dates and events are as follows:
i) OAS Digital Infrastructures Private Limited (in short ‘OAS’/transferor) did not file
a return of income for AY 2010-11.
ii) OAS stood amalgamated with the petitioner, Oasys Green Tech Private Limited (in
short ‘OGT’/transferee), with effect from 01.02.2015 per order of the Madras High
Court dated 20.08.2015 in Company Petition Nos.203 and 204 of 2015.
iii) Notice under Section 148 of the Act dated 31.03.2017 addressed to OAS was
issued, since, admittedly, the Department was unaware of the factum of
amalgamation.
iv) On 14.09.2017 OGT wrote to the Department bringing to its notice the merger and
also requesting that the notice be handed over to the bearer of the letter.

M/S.Oasys Green Tech Private Limited vs Income Tax Officer on 21 January, 2020
v) On 09.10.2017, OGT took the view that the proceedings for re- asessment were non est, since
notice under Section 148 had been issued upon a non-existing entity.
vi) The Assessing Authority however, on the basis of the notices already issued proceeded to
complete the re-assessment exparte passing the present impugned order under Section 144 of the
Act, to the best of his judgment.
vii) On merits, cash deposits in the bank account of the assessee have been treated as unexplained
cash credits under Section 68 of the Act along with equal penalty.
viii) It is as against the aforesaid order that the petitioner has filed Writ Petition in W.P.No.1759 of
2018.
ix) An order of stay of impugned proceedings granted by this Court on 29.01.2018 was duly brought
to the notice of the respondent Officer, despite which, the Officer, being of the view that proceedings
for re-assessment were different and distinguishable from proceedings for the levy of penalty, has
proceeded to finalise and levy penalty in terms of Section 271(1)(c) of the Act by order dated
28.06.2018.
xi) As against the above order, the petitioner has filed W.P.No.21858 of 2018. Both the impugned
orders of assessment and penalty have been framed on ‘OGT (formally known as OAS)’.
4. The crux of the submissions of the petitioner are to the effect that the impugned order is based on
a notice dated 31.03.2017 issued to OAS, that was non-existent on that date and hence the aforesaid
notice and all subsequent proceedings including the impugned order of assessment and penalty are
liable to be http://www.judis.nic.in set aside.
W.P.Nos.21858 and 1759 of 2018
5. The petitioner places reliance on the following decisions:
i) Principal Commissioner of Income Tax, New Delhi V. Maruti Suzuki India Limited
(Civil Appeal No.5409 of 2019 dated 25.07.2019)
ii) Spice Entertainment Ltd. V. Commissioner of Service Tax ((2012) 280 ElT 43)
iii) M/s.Rustagi Engineering Udyog Pvt. Ltd. V. Assistant Commissioner of Income
Tax, (W.P.(C) No.1289 of 1999 dated 24.02.2016)
iv) BDR Builders & Developers Pvt. Ltd. V. Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax
(W.P.(C) No.2712 of 2016 dated 26.07.2017)
v) Alamelu Veerappan V. The Income Tax Officer, Non Corporate Ward 2(2) (304
CTR 512)

M/S.Oasys Green Tech Private Limited vs Income Tax Officer on 21 January, 2020
6. Learned Senior Standing Counsel for the revenue submits that the Department was wholly
unaware of the proceedings for amalgamation of OAS with OGT. Moreover, the return of income for
AY 2014-15 had been filed by 07.03.2016 in the name of OAS by OGT, further confirming the
position that OAS was a functioning entity. Income tax refunds issued by the Department in favour
of OAS had been duly received and encashed by OGT. Thus it did not lie in the mouth of OGT to
canvass the view now that OAS was non-existent and that proceedings initiated in its name would be
bad in law.
7. She distinguishes all the decisions cited by the petitioner pointing out that the transferee entities
in those cases had duly brought to the notice of the revenue the factum of amalgamation, inspite of
which the revenue had initiated proceedings only as against the transferor/amalgamating entity.
This was the reason why the Courts (in those cases) had interfered in the proceedings, holding
http://www.judis.nic.in that once the Department had been put to notice about the W.P.Nos.21858
and 1759 of 2018 amalgamation, proceedings ought to have been initiated only in the hands of the
transferee entities.
8. The case of Alamelu Veerappan (supra) is distinguished stating that it relates to individuals and
not a corporate merger. The provisions of Section 159 that are applicable to the case of individuals
are not applicable in the case of companies. The decision has not been accepted by the Department
and is pending in Writ Appeal.
9. Heard learned counsel. A relevant factor to determine the assessable entity in cases such as the
present, is the conduct of the transferee entity. OGT has not only omitted to bring to the notice of
the revenue the factum of amalgamation, but, has by its conduct of filing a return of income post
amalgamation in the name of OAS furthered the illusion that OAS continues to exist even after
amalgamation. The fact that it has benefitted from the refunds issued in favour of OAS is also not
denied. Thus, by its very conduct, OGT has led the Department to believe that OAS, as an entity,
existed.
10. In the case of Maruti Suzuki (supra), the relevant facts are:
i) The transferor entity was Suzuki Powertrain India Limited (SPIL) and the
transferee entity was Maruti Suzuki India Limited (MSIL).
ii) Return of income had been filed by SPIL, no amalgamation having taken place on
that date, i.e., 28.11.2012. On 29.01.2013, the Scheme of amalgamation of SPIL and
MSIL was approved with effect from 01.04.2012. On 02.04.2013, MSIL intimated the
Assessing Officer of the factum of amalgamation.
http://www.judis.nic.in W.P.Nos.21858 and 1759 of 2018
iii) Notice under Section 143(2) and a questionnaire under Section 142(1) were issued to SPIL,
despite the Department having been aware that SPIL had ceased to exist upon an amalgamation.

M/S.Oasys Green Tech Private Limited vs Income Tax Officer on 21 January, 2020
iv) The transfer pricing order and draft assessment order were also passed in the name of SPIL.
v) MSIL participated in the assessment proceedings of SPIL and various communications issued by
the Department revealed the fact that the Assessing Officer was aware of the amalgamation of SPIL
and MSIL.
vi) The assessment order was challenged by MSIL before the Dispute Resolution Panel (DRP) as a
successor-in-interest of SPIL. No objection had been taken by MSIL to the fact that the draft
assessment order and transfer pricing order had been passed in the name of SPIL to contend that
such a defect would vitiate the proceedings for assessment.
vii) The order of the DRP was issued in the name of MSIL as successor of SPIL.
viii) The final assessment order was passed however in the name of SPIL (amalgamated with MSIL)
and while challenging the same before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (Tribunal) an objection
was raised to the effect that the assessment proceedings had been continued in the name of a
non-existing entity which vitiated the order.
ix) The Tribunal as well as the High Court accepted the stand of the assessee giving rise to the appeal
before the Supreme Court.
x) After noticing the sequence of facts as above and several decisions on http://www.judis.nic.in the
point, the Bench distinguished reliance placed by the revenue on W.P.Nos.21858 and 1759 of 2018
the decision of the Delhi High Court in the case of Skylight Hospitality LLP V. Assistant
Commissioner of Income Tax, Circle -28(1), New Delhi ((2018) 405 ITR 296), wherein the Delhi
High Court had taken the view that reference to the wrong assessee in the notice was only a clerical
error which could be corrected under Section 292B of the Act.
xi) The case of Skylight (supra) was by the Supreme Court that held that it was only in the peculiar
facts of that case that the Court had condoned the error in naming the assessee and the escapement
of income in that case had been established conclusively otherwise.
xii) The Supreme Court also took note of the position that that the decision in Skylight (supra) had
been distinguished by the Delhi, Gujarat and Madras High Courts in the cases of Rajender Kumar
Sehgal V. ITO ((2019) 260 Taxman 412), Chandreshbhai Jayantibhai Patel V. ITO ((2019) 261
Taxman 137) and Alamelu Veerappan (supra).
xiii) Noting specifically that the Assessing Officer (in the case of Maruti Suzuki) had been informed
of the fact that the amalgamating company had ceased to exist as a result of the Scheme of
Amalgamation, despite which the jurisdictional notice had been issued only in its name, the appeal
of the revenue was dismissed.
xiv) At paragraph Nos.33 and 34, the Bench states as follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/48142690/ 5
M/S.Oasys Green Tech Private Limited vs Income Tax Officer on 21 January, 2020
33 In the present case, despite the fact that the assessing officer was informed of the
amalgamating company having ceased to exist as a result of the approved scheme of
amalgamation, the jurisdictional notice was issued only in its name. The basis on
which jurisdiction was invoked was fundamentally at odds with the legal principle
that the amalgamating entity ceases to exist upon the approved scheme of
amalgamation. Participation in the proceedings by the appellant in the circumstances
cannot operate as an estoppel against law. This position now holds the field in view of
the judgment of a co-ordinate Bench of two http://www.judis.nic.in learned judges
which dismissed the appeal of the Revenue in Spice W.P.Nos.21858 and 1759 of 2018
Enfotainment on 2 November 2017. The decision in Spice Enfotainment has been
followed in the case of the respondent while dismissing the Special Leave Petition for
AY 2011-2012. In doing so, this Court has relied on the decision in Spice
Enfotainment.
34 We find no reason to take a different view. There is a value which the court must
abide by in promoting the interest of certainty in tax litigation. The view which has
been taken by this Court in relation to the respondent for AY 2011-12 must, in our
view be adopted in respect of the present appeal which relates to AY 2012-13. Not
doing so will only result in uncertainty and displacement of settled expectations.
There is a significant value which must attach to observing the requirement of
consistency and certainty. Individual affairs are conducted and business decisions are
made in the expectation of consistency, uniformity and certainty. To detract from
those principles is neither expedient nor desirable.
11. In the case of Spice Entertainment Ltd. (supra), the relevant facts are:
i) Spice Entertainment Ltd. (SCL/transferor) had filed a return of income for
A.Y.2002-03.
ii) On 11.02.2004 SCL stood amalgamated with M/s.MCorp Private Limited (MPL).
Upon receipt of notice of scrutiny, MPL duly brought to the notice of the Assessing
Officer the fact that SCL had been dissolved as a result of amalgamation.
iii) Despite being informed of the fact of amalgamation, the Assessing Officer passed
an order of assessment on SCL on 28.03.2005. In second appeal, the Tribunal held
that mere failure of the Assessing Officer to mention the correct name of the assessee
did not vitiate the assessment, since, in substance and fact, the assessment related
only to MCL.
iv) The reasoning of the Tribunal to the effect that the error in the order of
assessment was only procedural was held to be ‘blemished with legal loopholes and
contrary to law’ by the Supreme Court.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/48142690/ 6
M/S.Oasys Green Tech Private Limited vs Income Tax Officer on 21 January, 2020
v) The Court noted that from 01.07.2003, SCL ceased to exist, plain and simple.
vi) Taking note of the position that an Indian Company was a juristic person taking birth with
incorporation and dying with dissolution, the Court reiterated that on amalgamation, the
amalgamating company that stands subsumed with amalgamated entity and ceased to exist in the
eyes of law as a separate company.
vii) Thus, the framing of an order of assessment in the name of the erstwhile entity, where (a)
returns had been filed earlier by the dead entity, (b) the Department was put to notice of such
amalgamation, and (c) the amalgamated entity had participated in the assessment, was held to be
bad in law as it did not constitute a mere procedural irregularity that could be cured by recourse to
Section 292 of the Act.
12. As far as the case of Alamelu Veerappan (supra) is concerned, the decision is wholly
distinguishable, since it relates to the provisions of Section 159(2) dealing with a deceased assessee
and his legal representatives, whereas the present assessment is made in terms of Section 170
dealing with succession to business or profession otherwise than on death.
13. In the light of the decisions discussed, let us see the facts in the present case.
i) No return of income has been filed by OAS for the relevant assessment year. However, there are
credits in the bank account that are liable to be explained by the entity for the purposes of
determination of taxability. http://www.judis.nic.in W.P.Nos.21858 and 1759 of 2018
ii) The factum of amalgamation was not known to the Income Tax Department. The jurisdictional
notice, i.e., notice under Section 148 thus came to be issued to OAS.
iii) Receipt of notices by OGT is not denied, since it has appeared before the Assessing Officer
bringing to its notice the factum of amalgamation only then.
iv) On 14.09.2017, OGT brings to the notice of the Department the merger of OAS with OGT and
specifically requests the Department to handover the notice to its office staff, one Mr.Suresh.
v) Subsequent notices have been issued to ‘OGT (formally known as OAS)’ and the order of
assessment has also been passed in the name of Oasys Greentech Pvt. Limited, i.e., the petitioner.
vi) OGT has admittedly filed a return of income in the name of OAS for A.Y.2013-14 even
subsequent to amalgamation and also received refunds issued to OAS.
14. The stand of the petitioner to the effect that proceedings for re- assessment ought to have been
issued only in the name of OGT is clearly misconceived insofar as the Department has not been put
to notice of the factum of amalgamation by OGT till 14.09.2017 and the petitioner has also, by filing
a return in the name of OAS and receiving refunds addressed to OAS, furthered the impression that
OAS is an existing entity. This argument is rejected. I thus find no infirmity in law insofar as the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/48142690/ 7
M/S.Oasys Green Tech Private Limited vs Income Tax Officer on 21 January, 2020
impugned proceedings for re-assessment are concerned and the same are held to be valid.
15. By letter dated 20.12.2017, the petitioner has sought confirmation as to whether
http://www.judis.nic.in a return of income can be filed manually by it, since it was unable to
W.P.Nos.21858 and 1759 of 2018 upload a return electronically, the successor company not having
been incorporated for that assessment year. No reply has been given to this letter and instead the
impugned order of assessment has come to be passed on 30.12.2017, exparte.
16. For this reason, order dated 30.12.2017 is set aside. The petitioner is permitted to file a return
within a period of two (2) weeks from today. It is made clear that the assumption of jurisdiction by
the respondent/Assessing Officer is perfectly in order. After hearing the petitioner, the Officer shall
complete the proceedings for re-assessment on merits within a period of four (4) weeks from date of
filing of return.
17. These Writ Petitions are dismissed, however, granting liberty as set out above. No costs.
Connected Miscellaneous Petitions are also dismissed.
