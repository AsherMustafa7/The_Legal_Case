COMMON ORDER
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos. 13174, 13304 & 13366 of 2014 and 2168 of 2015 All the
petitioners have purchased their respective land by a registered sale deed dated 09.08.2010. From
the date of purchase, they are in possession and enjoyment of the lands, absolutely till today without
any interference from anybody. After verification, they found that some part of the land, which were
purchased by them have been acquired under Land Acquisition Act for the purpose of providing
Truck Terminal Yard. The said acquisition was without reference to the petitioners ownership and
without reference to incorporation of all the owners in all the revenue records and without reference
to the possession and enjoyment of the same. There was no notice before the lands were acquired or
after it was declared under Section 6(1) of the Act. Further, they learnt that the respondents were
published a declaration under Section 6(1) in G.O.Ms.No.68 of 2014 dated 28.04.2014.
2. In fact, it was challenged by these writ petitioners and there is an interim order of dispossession
from the subject land. The respondents issued preliminary notification under Section 4(1) of the Act.
After notification under Section 4(1), a notice in Form 3B dated 20.05.2013 was issued to several
land owners. However, the petitioner in https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos. 13174, 13304 &
13366 of 2014 and 2168 of 2015 W.P.No.2168 of 2015 was not served in Form 3B. The other
petitioners in other writ petitions were served in Form 3B, suitably replied by the respective
counsels on 03.06.2013. They specifically raised their objections that the truck terminal yard located
in Government poromboke instead of acquiring fertile agricultural lands with irrigation facilities.
The subject lands sought to be acquired are being cultivated two to three times in a year. These
lands are the source of supply of vegetable and other food products to the city of Madras. The
objections were received by the third respondent and referred to in the order passed under Section
5A of the Act dated 27.08.2013. However, the third respondent has merely referred to the objections
without any discussion and rejected the objections, on the ground that the requisitioning body i.e.,
the first respondent has rejected the objections and the enquiry officer also rejected the objections
and decided to proceed under Section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act.
3. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that after rejection of their objections under
Section 5A of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation
and https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos. 13174, 13304 & 13366 of 2014 and 2168 of 2015
Resettlement Act, 2013 was introduced with effect from 01.01.2014. It prescribes certain safe guards
and procedures in acquiring the lands after introducing of the Right to Fair Compensation and
Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013. The respondents
have published a declaration under Section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 in the local daily
dated 29.04.2014 preceeded by G.O.Ms.No.71 of 2014 dated 28.04.2014 and published the contents
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/40680271/ 4
L.R.Raviprasad vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 8 December, 2021
of the declaration in the local daily dated 28.04.2014. The said GO passed by the first respondent
refers to Act 1 of 1894 and also the Act 30 of 2013. The declaration specifically refers to Section
24(1)(a) of the Act 30 of 2013 and Section 6 of the Act 1 of 1984.
4. He further submitted that the fertile agricultural lands cannot be acquired under the Act 1 of 1894
and Act 30 of 2013 and the Government has consciously excluded fertile agricultural land being
acquired. The object of acquisition is for establishing a truck terminal yard. Whereas, the
declaration under Section 6(1) speaks about the purpose as to formation of Outer Ring Road. The
Outer Ring Road was already formed and as such, the present purpose referred to in the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos. 13174, 13304 & 13366 of 2014 and 2168 of 2015
declaration under Section 6(1) varies with the purpose referred to in the notification issued under
Section 4(1) and the declaration under Section 6 of the Act.
5. He further submitted that the lands acquired for specific purpose or providing truck terminal yard
abutting the Outer Ring Road. The Outer Ring Road runs from Vandaloor to Nemilichery about 30
KM distance. Between these two points there are many poromboke lands, forest poromboke and
social forest land, which can be utilised without affecting the agricultural operations of farmers.
Though, some of the land owners raised objections, those objections were simply brushed aside by
the third respondent, which is evident from the order passed under Section 5A dated 27.08.2013.
Therefore, the procedure adopted by the third respondent vitiates the order passed under Section
5A and the consequent declaration under Section 6 of the Act. The petitioners were not severed with
a copy of rejection of their objections and it is fatal to the order passed by the third respondent
culminating in Section 6 declaration. There is a violation of Rule 4 of the Land Acquisition Rules
and as such, the entire acquisition proceedings is vitiated. All the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos. 13174, 13304 & 13366 of 2014 and 2168 of 2015 petitioners are in possession and
enjoyment of the subject land.
6. He also submitted that Section 4(1) notification was issued on 16.04.2013. Thereafter, the New
Act came into force with effect from 01.01.2014. Whereas, Section 6(1) notification issued under the
Old Act. After the New Act came into force, the entire acquisition proceedings initiated under the
Old Act had been repealed and the respondents ought to have initiated the proceedings under the
New Act. In support of his contention, he relied upon the following Judgments ;
(i) 1994 Writ LR 326 in the case of Ramanujam N.D Vs. Collector of Madras and others.
(ii) 2012 (1) SCC 792 in the case of Raghbir Singh Sehrawat Vs. State of Haryana and others.
(iii) 2013 (11) SCC 228 in the case of Gurbinder Kaur Brar Vs. Union of India.
7. Per contra, the learned Government Advocate appearing for the first respondent contended that
the Government of Tamil Nadu, in their noble objective to decentralize the urban development and
re-congestion of transportation, have accorded sanction to connect Vandalur Village of
Kanchipuram District and Minjur of Tiruvallur https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos. 13174,
13304 & 13366 of 2014 and 2168 of 2015 District by way of Outer Ring Road Project with a total
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/40680271/ 5
L.R.Raviprasad vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 8 December, 2021
stretch of 62.3 KM vide G.O.Ms.No.381, Housing and Urban Development Department, dated
25.05.1993. The first phase of the project of land acquisition between Vandalur to Nemilichery
Village got completed and the road laying process is in progress. The second phase of the land
acquisition between Tirunindrayur to Minjur is also under process.
8. While being so, the Government of Tamil Nadu issued G.O.Ms.No.14, Housing and Urban
Development Department, dated 13.01.2011, thereby accorded to sanction for acquisition of 117
acres of land in Karunakarachery and Annambedu Village, for the development of “Truck Terminal
project by CMDA”. Out of the total extent of 117 acres, to an extent of 65.58 acres of land was
earmarked in Annambedu Village. Subsequently, notification under Section 4(1) of the Act was
published on 16.04.2013 in furtherance to the enquiry under Section 5A was conducted, in which
the petitioners have filed their objections against the acquisition proceedings.
9. The preliminary objections raised by the petitioners were https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos. 13174, 13304 & 13366 of 2014 and 2168 of 2015 rejected by the first respondent and
decided to process further. Accordingly, a declaration under Section 6 of the Act was published in
G.O.Ms.Nos.76 & 77 of 2014, Housing and Urban Development Department, dated 28.04.2014. In
the mean while, the Government of India have enacted the New Act, which came into force on
01.01.2014 by repealing the Old Act. The New Act prescribes certain guidelines for the categories of
land acquisition process, particularly for the cases, in which the 4(1) notification have been ordered
before the enactment of the New Act.
10. He further submitted that the objections raised by the petitioners were duly considered and
overruled by the respondents. In fact, some of the petitioners land in question have already been
converted in the name and style of “Brick Industry”. Whereas, they came forward with a perjury of
the proposed lands are cultivated two to three times in a year and stand prime supplier of
agricultural products to the city of Chennai. The publication under Section 4(1) of the Act and
Section 5A enquiry under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 were carried out well
before the enactment of the New Act. The petitioners https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.
13174, 13304 & 13366 of 2014 and 2168 of 2015 have no locus to offer opinion to consider the
poromboke lands in the place of patta lands. The schemes formulated by the Government for the
benefit of the public are decided only after carrying out critical analysis and consideration. The
Government has envisaged in their circulars that the water course poromboke lands should not be
recommended for any purpose otherwise only for the cause that they are classified as 'foresaken' or
'abandoned'.
11. The lands acquired for the Truck Terminal Yard Project and it is formulated only to facilitate the
easement of congesting transportation and to provide facilities to the truck travelers of long
distances. In fact, the objections raised by the petitioners were forwarded to the first respondent i.e.,
the requisition body. Thereafter, the requisition body i.e., the first respondent herein after
verification and consideration of the objections raised by the petitioners had rejected and the same
was conveyed to the petitioners on 27.08.2013. Therefore, the entire process under the Act were
strictly followed and there is no question of impunity and negligence on the part of the respondents.

L.R.Raviprasad vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 8 December, 2021
12. Heard, Mr.V.Ramesh, learned counsel appearing for the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos. 13174, 13304 & 13366 of 2014 and 2168 of 2015 petitioners, Mr.Richardson Wilson,
learned Government Advocate appearing for the first and third respondents and Ms.Veena Suresh,
learned Standing Counsel appearing for the second respondent.
13. The points for consideration in these writ petitions,
(i) whether the acquisition proceedings initiated under the Land Acquisition Act 1894 , when the
repealed Act 30 of 2013 i.e., the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition,
Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 came into force with effect from 01.01.2014 can be
sustainable ?
(ii) whether the respondents conducted enquiry under Section 5A of the Act as prescribed under
Rule 4 of the Land Acquisition Rules. In continuation of the Land Acquisition Proceedings for the
Outer Ring Road Project, the Government of Tamil Nadu issued G.O.Ms.No.14, Housing and Urban
Development Department, dated 13.01.2011, thereby accorded administrative sanction for
acquisition of 117 acres of land in Karunakarachery and Annambedu Village of Tiruvallur District,
for development of Truck Terminal Project by CMDA i.e., the first respondent. Accordingly,
notification under Section 4(1) of the Act was https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos. 13174,
13304 & 13366 of 2014 and 2168 of 2015 published on 16.04.2013.
14. In pursuant to the notification under Section 4(1) notice in Form 3B dated 20.05.2013 was
issued and the notice in Form 3B suitably replied by the petitioners on 03.06.2013, except
W.P.No.2168 of 2015. The case of the petitioner in W.P.No.2168 of 2015 is concerned, the petitioner
was not served with any notice in Form 3B. Therefore, he denied the opportunity to object to the
acquisition of lands. On receipt of the objections along with the enclosed documents, the third
respondent passed an order on 27.08.2013.
15. A perusal of the order dated 27.08.2013 reveals that the objections raised by the petitioners were
considered and rejected by the first respondent, by an order dated 27.08.2013 and as such, the
objections raised by the petitioners, thereby overruled and recommended for declaration under
Section 6 of the Act. The said conclusion accepted by the third respondent and recorded the same
and again recommended for declaration under Section 6 of the Act by the third respondent.
Therefore, there was no enquiry conducted by either first respondent or
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos. 13174, 13304 & 13366 of 2014 and 2168 of 2015 by the
third respondent as contemplated under Section 5A of the Act.
16. A perusal of the objections raised by the petitioners dated 03.06.2013, they specifically raised
objections that the lands in Karunakarachery village are fertile agricultural lands with irrigation
facilities and the lands are capable of being cultivated three times in a year. Therefore, an abundant
lake in Nadukuthagai Village admeasuring 100 acres, which is just 1 ½ KM from Karunakaracheri
Village, which abuts the Outer Ring Road completely encroached by the third parties, is available for
constructing a truck terminal and it is the best suited land for the said purpose. It is further stated
that the encroachers can be evicted and the land can be utilized without spending for compensation
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/40680271/ 7
L.R.Raviprasad vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 8 December, 2021
as the value of the land. Further the outer ring road between two points i.e., Vandalur and
Nemilicheri is about 35 KM and the location of Karunakaracheri is almost near Nemilichery where
the outer ring road proceeds towards GNT Road between Vandalur and Nemilicheri, there are large
parcels of poromboke, forest poromboke and social forest lands, which can be utilised for the
formation of truck bay.
17. Further, any one of the objections raised by the petitioners https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos. 13174, 13304 & 13366 of 2014 and 2168 of 2015 was not discussed and not considered by
the respondent, while overruling the objections raised by the petitioners. Without even stating any
of the reasons to reject the objections raised by the petitioner and also without stating any of the
reasons to dissatisfy with the objections raised by the petitioners, mechanically overruled the
objections for the only reason that the first respondent also overruled the objections raised by the
petitioners. It is also pertinent to mention here that the first respondent and the third respondent
are not the competent person to conduct enquiry under Section 5A of the Act. It shows that the
non-application of mind of the respondents, in pursuant to the order passed by the third
respondent, Section 6 declaration was published on 28.04.2014 in G.O.Ms.No.78. On perusal of the
said declaration revealed that the subject land acquired for the public purpose and the Government
satisfied for acquisition and issued declaration. Nothing referred about the orders passed by the first
respondent or the third respondent herein about the overruled the objections raised by the
petitioners.
18. In this regard, it is also relevant to extract the provisions under Section 5A of the sub-section 1
and 2 of the Act :-
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos. 13174, 13304 & 13366 of 2014 and 2168
of 2015 5-A. Hearing of objections – (1) Any person interested in any land which has
been notified under Section 4, sub-section (1), as being needed or likely to be needed
for a public purpose or for a company may, [within thirty days from the date of the
publication of the notification], object to the acquisition of the land or of any land in
the locality, as the case may be.
(2) Every objection under sub-section (1) shall be made to the Collector in writing,
and the Collector shall give the objector an opportunity of being hearing [in person or
by any person authorised by him in this behalf] or by pleader and shall, after hearing
all such objections and after making such further inquiry, if any, as he thinks
necessary, [either make a report in respect of the land which has been notified under
Section 4, sub-
section (1), or make different reports in respect of different parcels of such land, to the appropriate
Government, containing his recommendations on the objections, together with the record of the
proceedings held by him, for the decision of the Government]. The decision of the [appropriate
Government] on the objections shall be final.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/40680271/ 8
L.R.Raviprasad vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 8 December, 2021
19. Accordingly, the Collector, i.e., the third respondent gave the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos. 13174, 13304 & 13366 of 2014 and 2168 of 2015 objector an opportunity of being hearing
and after hearing all such objections and after making such further inquiry, if any, as he thinks
necessary, either make a report in respect of the land which has been notified under Section 4,
sub-section (1), or make different reports in respect of different parcels of the land, to the
appropriate Government, containing his recommendations on the objections, together with the
record of the proceedings held by him, for the decision of the Government.
20. In the case on hand, there is no records to show that the third respondent considered the
objections raised by the petitioners as prescribed under Section 5A(2) of the Act. In this regard, the
learned counsel for the petitioners relied upon the Judgment reported in 2012 (1) SCC 792 in the
case of Raghbir Singh Sehrawat Vs. State of Haryana and others. The relevant portion of the
Judgment is extracted hereunder:
39. In this context, it is necessary to remember that the rules of natural justice have
been ingrained in the scheme of Section 5A with a view to ensure that before any
person is deprived of his land by way of compulsory acquisition, he must get an
opportunity to https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos. 13174, 13304 & 13366 of
2014 and 2168 of 2015 oppose the decision of the State Government and/or its
agencies/instrumentalities to acquire the particular parcel of land. At the hearing, the
objector can make an effort to convince the Land Acquisition Collector to make
recommendation against the acquisition of his land. He can also point out that the
land proposed to be acquired is not suitable for the purpose specified in the
notification issued under Section 4(1). Not only this, he can produce evidence to show
that another piece of land is available and the same can be utilised for execution of
the particular project or scheme.
40. Though it is neither possible nor desirable to make a list of the grounds on which
the landowner can persuade the Collector to make recommendations against the
proposed acquisition of land, but what is important is that the Collector should give a
fair opportunity of hearing to the objector and objectively consider his plea against
the acquisition of land. Only thereafter, he should make recommendations supported
by brief reasons as to why the particular piece of land should or should not be
acquired and whether or not the plea put forward by the objector merits acceptance.
In other words, the recommendations made by the Collector must reflect objective
applications of mind to the objections filed by the landowners and other
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos. 13174, 13304 & 13366 of 2014 and 2168
of 2015 interested persons.”
21. Thus, it is clear that the recommendations made by the Collector must reflect objective
application of mind to the objections raised by the land owners and other interested persons. The
Collector should make recommendations supported by brief reasons as to why the particular piece
of land should or should not be acquired and whether or not the plea put forward by the objector
merits acceptance.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/40680271/ 9
L.R.Raviprasad vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 8 December, 2021
22. A perusal of the order dated 27.08.2013 reveals that though the objectors appeared and raised
objections and there is no records to show that they were enquired and their objections were duly
considered or not. Therefore, the above Judgment is squarely applicable to the case on hand. It is
clear that the third respondent failed to follow the provisions under Section 5A of the Land
Acquisition Act and Rule 4 of the Land Acquisition Rules. In fact, under Section 6 declaration also
there is no mention about the recommendations of the third respondent and no mention about the
reasons for satisfaction to acquire the land.
23. The learned Government Advocate for the respondents https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos. 13174, 13304 & 13366 of 2014 and 2168 of 2015 produced the order dated 19.12.2013
passed by the Principal Secretary and Commissioner of Land Administration, Chepauk, Chennai
issued to the Government, thereby approved draft declaration under Section 6 of the Land
Acquisition Act. It revealed that the District Revenue Officer (LA), Outer Ring Road Project has now
sent the proposal of Draft Declaration for approval in respect of Block No.3, S.No.117/1A, etc.,
admeasuring to an extent of 3.44.5 hectare of wet lands to be proposed for acquisition. The report
submitted by the District Revenue Officer (LA) revealed that the objections were forwarded to the
requisitioning body, i.e., the first respondent herein and the requisitioning body recommended the
development of a new Truck Terminal of Karunakaracheri and Annambedu Villages at the
intersection of the Outer Ring Road and 200 proposed arterial road. As the lands are essential for
the development of Truck Terminal and the objections of land owners may be overruled and the
request may be negatived. Thus, it is clear that the objections raised by the petitioners were not at all
considered either by the third respondent or by the District Revenue Officer (LA), Outer Ring Road
and mechanically recorded that the reasons stated by the respondents overruled the objections
raised by the petitioners. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos. 13174, 13304 & 13366 of 2014

24. In this regard, the learned counsel for the petitioners relied upon the Judgment reported in 2013
(11) SCC 228 in the case of Gurbinder Kaur Brar and another Vs. Union of India and others. The
relevant portion of the Judgment is extracted hereunder :
“9. We also agree with the learned counsel for the appellants that the report of the
Land Acquisition Officer was vitiated due to total non-application of mind by the
officer concerned to a large number of substantive objections raised by the appellants
under Section 5A(1). He mechanically rejected the objections and senior officers of
the Chandigarh Administration accepted the report of the Land Acquisition Officer
despite the fact that the same had been prepared in violation of Section 5A(2).”
25. The above Judgment is squarely applicable to the case on hand, the third respondent or the
District Revenue Officer (LA), Outer Ring Road rejected the objections raised by the petitioners
mechanically, without application of mind. Therefore, the entire acquisition proceedings is vitiated
and the G.O.Ms.Nos. 69, 71, 72, 73, 76, 77 & 78, dated 28.04.2014 (Housing and Urban
Development) published in the local https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos. 13174, 13304 &
13366 of 2014 and 2168 of 2015 daily Dinamani dated 29.04.2014 as per the provisions of the Land
Acquisition Act, 1894, is quashed.
