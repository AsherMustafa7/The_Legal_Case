JUDGMENT
1. The petitioners have impugned the FIR bearing No. 110/2018 dated 22.04.2018 for commission of
offences under sections 447-A RPC and 6/39 Forest Act, registered with Police Station, Bahu Fort,
Jammu at the instance of respondent No. 2.
2. It is stated that the land measuring 74 kanals 15 marlas comprising Survey Nos. 1567 min, 1576,
1572 and 1569 situated at village Sunjwan, Tehsil Bahu, is the proprietary land of petitioner No. 1
and the respondent No. 2 under some misconception and wrong notion is claiming the said land to
be a Forest land comprising survey No. 1468, wherein forest compartment No. 6/Chowadi is also
located. The petitioners claim to have already sold the land measuring 31kanals and 19 marlas to
one Mukhtyar Ahmed Waza by way of an agreement to sell and Mukhtyar Ahmed Waza has also
purchased the land from one Baldev Singh and few other persons, total measuring 74 kanals and 15
marlas. When one Mukhtyar Ahmed Waza started raising construction on the land mentioned
above, Estate Officer (Divisional Forest Officer, Jammu), Forest Division Jammu, on the basis of
encroachment report received from the respondent No. 2, initiated the proceedings under section
48-A of the Forest Act against the petitioners, thereby issuing a show cause notice dated 21.05.2018
on the premise that the petitioners are in unauthorised occupation of the Forest land in
compartment No. 6/Chowadi of village Sunjwan of Bahu Range (survey No. 1468). It was mentioned
in the show cause notice that the illegal construction of 4 pacca houses, five compound walls over 15
kanals and 15 marlas of Forest land, one water tank, one pacca structure, one concrete plinth 300

Mohd Rashid Malik And Anr vs State Of J&K And Anr on 27 April, 2023
feet have been made over 20 kanals and 3 marlas of the Forest land by breaking, cleaning and
altering the legal status of the Forest land. The petitioners further claim to have replied to the said
show cause notice, stating therein that the petitioners on behalf of Mushtaq Ahmed Waza are not in
illegal possession of land measuring 74 kanals and 15 marlas comprising survey Nos. 1567 min, 1572
and 1569 and the construction that has been raised as mentioned in the show cause notice, has not
been raised on the Forest land bearing survey No. 1468 (compartment 6/Chowadi). It is further
stated that the petitioner, thereafter filed the writ petition challenging the show cause notice and
this Court vide order dated 06.07.2018 directed the respondents in the writ petition to follow
section 48A (I) of the Jammu and Kashmir Forest Act 1997 and the petitioner was left free to work
out his remedy under section 48-A(2) of the Forest Act. It is also stated that a civil suit, titled,
Mukhtyar Ahmed Waza vs Mohd. Yousuf and others is pending before the court of learned City
Judge, Jammu in which the Commissioner Secretary, Forest Department is also one of the
defendants and in the said suit, the learned City Judge, Jammu has made interim order dated
06.06.2016 absolute subject to the condition that the plaintiff therein will only enjoy the usufruct of
his property and will not change the dimensions thereof and non applicants therein will not cause
any interference in the smooth enjoyment of the suit land. Thereafter on 22.12.2016, the learned
City Judge, Jammu with the consent of the Forest Department directed the Deputy Commissioner,
Jammu to constitute a team of revenue officials for demarcation of the land and the Deputy
Commissioner, Jammu constituted a committee for demarcation of the land comprising survey
Nos.1468, 1567, 1569, 1572 and 1576 situated at village, Sunjwan. The Committee submitted the
demarcation report and in the said report, it has been specifically mentioned that the land in
question is the proprietary land of the petitioners and the same falls outside the limits of survey No.
1468 min where the land of the Forest Department is situated. The Forest Department assailed the
order dated 17.09.2016 whereby the interim directions issued earlier were made absolute and the
court of 1st Additional District Judge, Jammu vide order dated 13.10.2016 ordered the stay of
construction till the same is demarcated so that the Forest land is not encroached by any citizen
including the petitioners. The appeal so filed by the Forest Department was initially dismissed on
30.01.2017, but was subsequently readmitted.
3. It is further stated in para 11 of the petition that during the pendency of the writ petition as well as
civil suit, just to harass the petitioners, false and vexatious complaint dated 19.04.2018 was filed,
alleging therein that on 18.04.2018 the petitioners forcibly entered into the Forest land
compartment No. 6/Chowadi comprising survey No. 1468 by engaging men and machinery and
altered the legal status of Forest land in survey No. 1468 by way of digging/laying of concrete plinth
of 300 ft approximately straight from Bermene road and plinth of one room to grab more Forest
land in violation of section 6/39 of the J&K Forest Act and section 447-A RPC and also the court
order dated 15.12.2017. It was further alleged in the complaint that the building material i.e. bricks
60,000, Bajri 500 C. ft and sand 500 C ft have been dumped on spot for encroachment during odd
hours to encroach the Forest Land, which has been seized on site by BO Chowadi. It was also stated
that the demarcation of the land was conducted on 31.08.2017 by the Commissioner in the presence
of Forest Department's staff and the petitioners herein and the said demarcation report clearly
indicated that the said person had encroached Forest land measuring 36 kanals and 01 marals
falling under survey No. 1468 in two parts. In one part, he has encroached 15 kanals and 18 marlas
of land by way of plot-bandi and selling to different persons and in second part by way of levelling

Mohd Rashid Malik And Anr vs State Of J&K And Anr on 27 April, 2023
and constructing 2 rooms i.e. 20 kanals and 3 marlas whereas his actual land comprising of survey
Nos. are 1572, 1569, 1568 and 1567, is found to be two and half kms away from the survey No. 1468.
4. After the registration of said FIR, SHO Police Station, Bahu Fort approached SDPO, Police
Station, Jammu who accordingly, vide communication dated 28.04.2018 requested the Tehsildar,
Bahu, Jammu to depute a team of revenue officials for conducting the demarcation of the disputed
land so that the investigation of the case is brought to its logical conclusion. The Tehsildar Jammu
in-turn vide his communication dated 02.05.2018 directed the DFO Jammu to depute a team of
forest officials on spot for joint demarcation of the land comprising survey No. 1468 of village
Sunjwan or otherwise situated at Bermini road on 03.05.2018 at 9 AM. Despite communications,
the officials of the Forest Department did not reach on spot and Tehsildar Bahu vide communication
dated 05.05.2018 informed the SDPO East Jammu that the demarcation of survey number in
question has already been carried out through Commission on 17.10.2016 under the orders of City
Judge, Jammu and in the said report it has been established that the said land is situated outside the
limits of the Forest area.
5. The petitioners have impugned the FIR on the ground that the FIR is in contrast to the
documentary evidence placed on record and particularly when a civil suit is going on between the
parties, the same has been given a criminal colour by the forest department notwithstanding with
the fact that the allegations levelled in the FIR are far-far away from the truth.
6. Reply stands filed by the respondents in which it has been stated that the present petition is not
maintainable as the disputed facts are involved. It is further stated that on 22.04.2018 a
communication was received from complainant, Range Forest Officer, Bahu Range, Jammu wherein
it was stated as reported by BO Chowadi that it is brought to your kind notice that one person,
namely, Rashid Malik S/o Aman Din R/o Jalalabad and his son Zulfi and his agent code name
Foreman, resident of UP at present Sunjwan on 18.04.2018 forcibly entered into forest
compartment No. 6/Chowadi comprising survey No. 1468 by engaging man and machinery and
altered the legal status of the forest land in the said survey number by way of digging/laying of
concrete plinth 300 feet approximately straight along Bermini road and plinth of one room to grab
more forest land in violation of the Forest Act. It was also stated that the land of Rashid Malik
comprising survey Nos. 1572, 1569, 1568 and 1567 is in fact 2 and half kms away from survey No.
1468.
7. After the receipt of the communication, FIR was registered and during the course of investigation,
the revenue record was obtained and it was found that the accused Mohd Rashid Malik and his son
Zulfi with criminal intention trespassed into the Forest Land in survey No. 1468 by digging/laying of
concrete plinth and forcibly altering the Forest land. As per revenue report of jamabandhi for the
year, 1998 -1999, the survey No. 1468 is a Forest land.
8. Mr. Navyug Sethi, learned counsel for the petitioner vehemently argued that as per demarcation
report, the petitioners are in possession of their own land and not of any Forest land falling under
survey No. 1468. He laid much stress on the demarcation report placed on record by the petitioners.

9. Per contra, Mr. Pawan Dev Singh, learned Dy.AG vehemently argued that the petitioners have
raised disputed questions of facts and they cannot be considered in the present petition.
10. Heard and perused the record.
11. The dispute in the present case is with regard to the encroachment of Forest land comprising
survey No. 1468, Forest Compartment No.6. The petitioner claims to be the owner in possession of
the land comprising survey Nos. 1567 min, 1576, 1572 and 1569 situated at village Sunjwan
regarding which it is alleged that a civil suit for permanent prohibitory injunction is also pending
and further that the petitioners have also filed the writ petition challenging the notice dated
21.05.2018 issued by the Forest Department. On the contrary, the respondent No. 2 has levelled
allegations against the petitioners in respect of forcible encroachment of the Forest land comprising
survey No. 1468 on 18.04.2018. It needs to be noted that the petitioners filed the writ petition after
registration of the FIR against them.
12. A perusal of the petition reveals that the petitioners are themselves confused about their status
qua the land measuring 74 kanals 15 maralas. In para 3 of the petition, the petitioner No. 1 claims to
be the owner of land measuring 74 kanals and 15 marals situated at Sunjwan and further claims to
have already sold the land measuring 31 kanals and 19 marals to one Mukhtyar Ahmed Waza and
simultaneously, in para-5 of the petition, the petitioners have pleaded that when the show cause
notice dated 21.05.2018 was issued to the petitioners, they replied the said notice stating therein
that the petitioners on behalf of Mukhtyar Ahmed Waza are not in illegal possession of the land
compromising Survey Nos. 1567, 1572 and 1569 total 74 kanals and 15 marlas situated at Sunjwan.
13. Further a perusal of the civil suit reveals that the petitioners are not party to the said suit and in
fact, it appears that they through the medium of the present petition are trying to raise the dispute
with regard to the location of the land under the shelter of the said Mukhtyar Ahmed Waza.
14. The petitioners have also claimed that there is demarcation report which demonstrates that the
proprietary land of the petitioners falls outside the limits of the khasra No. 1468 min. A perusal of
the Case Diary reveals that there is a demarcation report dated 08.02.2019 wherein it has been
categorically stated that one Mohd. Rashid S/o Imam Din has encroached the land comprising
survey No. 1468 which as per the jamabandi 1998-1999 Bikrami, is in possession of Forest
Department. Merely because the civil suit is pending before the civil court and the petitioners have
filed the writ petition challenging the notice dated 21.05.2018 would not mean that the petitioners
can forcibly occupy the Forest land comprising survey No. 1468, more particularly when the suit has
not been filed by them. The petitioners in the present petition have raised the disputed questions of
facts and this Court cannot conduct a mini trial so as to determine the veracity of the claim of the
petitioners. It would be advantageous to take note of the observations of the Hon'ble Apex Court in
Priti Saraf v. State (NCT of Delhi), 2021 SCC OnLine SC 206 and the relevant paras are reproduced
as under:
"23. It being a settled principle of law that to exercise powers under Section 482
CrPC, the complaint in its entirety shall have to be examined on the basis of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74661468/ 4
Mohd Rashid Malik And Anr vs State Of J&K And Anr on 27 April, 2023
allegation made in the complaint/FIR/charge-sheet and the High Court at that stage
was not under an obligation to go into the matter or examine its correctness.
Whatever appears on the face of the complaint/FIR/charge-sheet shall be taken into
consideration without any critical examination of the same. The offence ought to
appear ex facie on the complaint/FIR/charge-sheet and other documentary evidence,
if any, on record.
30. In the instant case, the complaint/FIR/charge-sheet as noticed above, does,
however, lend credence to the questions posed. It is settled that one is not supposed
to dilate on this score, or intend to present that the allegations in the complaint will
have to be accepted on the face of it and the truth or falsity of which would not be
gone into by the Court at this stage, as noticed above, whether the allegations in the
complaint were true is to be decided on the basis of the evidence led at the stage of
trial and the observations on this score in the case of Nagpur Steel & Alloys Pvt. Ltd.
v. P. Radhakrishna ought to be noticed. In para 3, this Court observed:--
"3. We have perused the complaint carefully. In our opinion it cannot be said that the
complaint did not disclose the commission of an offence. Merely because the offence
was committed during the course of a commercial transaction, would not be
sufficient to hold that the complaint did not warrant a trial. Whether or not the
allegations in the complaint were true was to be decided on the basis of evidence to
be led at the trial in the complaint case. It certainly was not a case in which the
criminal trial should have been cut short. The quashing of the complaint has resulted
in grave miscarriage of justice. We, therefore, without expressing any opinion on the
merits of the case, allow this appeal and set aside the impugned order of the High
Court and restore the complaint. The learned trial Magistrate shall proceed with the
complaint and dispose of it in accordance with law expeditiously."
31. Be it noted that in the matter of exercise of inherent power by the High Court, the only
requirement is to see whether continuance of the proceedings would be a total abuse of the process
of the Court. The Criminal Procedure Code contains a detailed procedure for investigation, framing
of charge and trial, and in the event when the High Court is desirous of putting a halt to the known
procedure of law, it must use proper circumspection with great care and caution to interfere in the
complaint/FIR/charge-sheet in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction.
32. In the instant case, on a careful reading of the complaint/FIR/charge-sheet, in our view, it
cannot be said that the complaint does not disclose the commission of an offence. The ingredients of
the offences under Sections 406 and 420 IPC cannot be said to be absent on the basis of the
allegations in the complaint/FIR/charge-sheet. We would like to add that whether the allegations in
the complaint are otherwise correct or not, has to be decided on the basis of the evidence to be led
during the course of trial. Simply because there is a remedy provided for breach of contract or
arbitral proceedings initiated at the instance of the appellants, that does not by itself clothe the court
to come to a conclusion that civil remedy is the only remedy, and the initiation of criminal
proceedings, in any manner, will be an abuse of the process of the court for exercising inherent

Mohd Rashid Malik And Anr vs State Of J&K And Anr on 27 April, 2023
powers of the High Court under Section 482 CrPC for quashing such proceedings."
(Emphasis Supplied)
15. In Central Bureau of Investigation V. Aryan Singh, 2023 LiveLaw (SC) 292, it has been held as
under:
"From the impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court, it
appears that the High Court has dealt with the proceedings before it, as if, the High
Court was conducting a mini trial and/or the High Court was considering the
applications against the judgment and order passed by the learned Trial Court on
conclusion of trial. As per the cardinal principle of law, at the stage of Criminal
discharge and/or quashing of the criminal proceedings, while exercising the powers
under Section 482 Cr.P.C., the Court is not required to conduct the mini trial. The
High Court in the common impugned judgment and order has observed that the
charges against the accused are not proved. This is not the stage where the
prosecution / investigating agency is/are required to prove the charges. The charges
are required to be proved during the trial on the basis of the evidence led by the
prosecution / investigating agency. Therefore, the High Court has materially erred in
going in detail in the allegations and the material collected during the course of the
investigation against the accused, at this stage. At the stage of discharge and/or while
exercising the powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C., the Court has a very limited
jurisdiction and is required to consider "whether any sufficient material is available
to proceed further against the accused for which the accused is required to be tried or
not".
(Emphasis Supplied)
16. In view of above, this petition is found to be without any merit and the same is dismissed.
17. Case Diary be returned to the learned Dy. AG appearing for the respondents.
