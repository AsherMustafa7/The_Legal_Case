with law.
(h) The Presiding Officer of the COI is directed to complete the inquiry within a
period of four months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order on day-to-day
basis, for which the petitioner as well as the petitioner's husband are directed to

(i) No costs."
[3] Having been aggrieved, the appellant approached this Court again by filing the present appeal
assailing the judgment and order passed by the learned single Judge and also praying for allowing
the writ petition filed by her. During the pendency of the present writ appeal and despite the
directions given by the learned Single Judge, WA No. 80 of 2023 Page 2 Item No. 4-6 the authorities
could not commence the COI due to the health condition of the husband of the appellant.
[4] On the request made by the authorities, this Court passed an interim order in the present appeal
allowing the authorities to evaluate the health and mental condition of the husband of the appellant.
Pursuant to the order passed by this Court, the husband of the appellant was subjected to medical
examination by a Classified specialist (Psychiatrist) namely, Lt. Col.RK Bharat and that the
Classified specialist extensively examined the appellant's husband on a day-to-day basis over a
continuous period from 13-02-2023 until 23-02- 2023 and thereafter gave a medical report that it
has been convincingly established that the appellant's husband is suffering from depression with
psychotic symptoms and paranoid schizophrenia and has shown no response to the treatment so far.
On the basis of the said medical report, the authorities filed an additional affidavit and in the
additional affidavit, it has been, inter alia, stated that since it is established that the husband of the
appellant is suffering from a mental illness, he is not in a position to undergo an investigation in the
nature of COI wherein he can appropriately defended himself against the allegations. Situated thus,
the authorities cannot commence the COI against the husband of the appellant till today.
[5] Mr. N. Ibotombi, learned senior counsel, by referring to the provisions of Section 123 of the
Army Act, 1950 submitted that as the authorities could not commence the COI against the husband

Smt. L. Nirmala Singh vs Union Of India & 4 Ors on 6 June, 2023
of the WA No. 80 of 2023 Page 3 Item No. 4-6 appellant even after the lapse of a period of 3(three)
years after his retirement, by operation of law as provided under Sec. 123 of the Army Act, 1950, the
authorities are debarred from proceeding with the COI against the husband of the appellant. The
learned senior counsel accordingly, submitted that the present writ appeal may be allowed by
issuing a direction not to proceed with the COI against the husband of the Appellant.
[6] Mr. S. Vijayanand Sharma, learned senior panel counsel appearing for the respondents fairly
submitted that in view of the medical condition of the husband of the appellant and the medical
report submitted by the concerned medical expert of the Army, it was not possible to commence the
COI against the husband of the appellant till today. The learned counsel appearing for the
respondents also fairly submitted that the period of 3(three) years as contemplated under the
provision of section 123 of Army Act, 1950 have already lapsed, even after excluding the period
during which stay order passed by this Court was in operation. The learned counsel also fairly
submitted that because of the provisions of law as provided under section 123 of the Army Act, there
is now no possibility of commencing the COI against the husband of the appellant.
[7] Taking into consideration the submissions advanced by the learned counsel appearing for the
parties and after careful examination of the undisputed facts and circumstances of the present case
and the provision of section 123 of the Army Act, 1950, wherein it WA No. 80 of 2023 Page 4 Item
No. 4-6 is provided, inter alia, that no person shall be tried for an offence committed under the
Army Act, unless his trial commences within a period of three years after he had ceased to be subject
to the said Act, we are of the considered view that the present writ appeal can be disposed of by
directing the authorities not to proceed any further with the COI against the husband of the
appellant. Ordered accordingly. The impugned judgment of the learned Single Judge is modified to
the extent indicated above.
[8] with the aforesaid direction, the present writ appeal is disposed of. There will be no order as to
cost.
