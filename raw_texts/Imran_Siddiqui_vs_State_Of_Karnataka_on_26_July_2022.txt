referred as such in this order.
2. The petitioner in W.P.No.10023 of 2022 calls in question registration of crime in Crime No.68 of
2022 registered for offences punishable under Sections 384, 504, 506 and 34 of the IPC and the

3. Heard Sri A.S.Ponnanna, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners in both the
petitions, Sri V.S.Hegde, Special Public Prosecutor-II for respondent No.1 and Sri P.Rudrappa,
learned counsel for respondent No.2/complainant in Writ Petition No.10029 of 2022. The
complainant/respondent No.2 in W.P.No.10023 of 2022 though served is unrepresented.
4. Brief facts that lead to the filing of the present petitions, as borne out from the pleadings, are as
follows:-
A complaint is registered by the 2nd respondent against the petitioners on
01-05-2022 alleging that the petitioners in Writ Petition No.10029 of 2022 have
threatened the complainant and have extracted money and are demanding Rs.2/-
lakhs again. Based upon this, the petitioners were arrested and taken to custody.
After the petitioners obtained bail another complaint is registered on 05-05-2022
with the same allegation by a different complainant. In the said complaint the
allegation was only against the petitioner. This forms part of Writ Petition No.10023
of 2022. Registration of these FIRs is called in question by the petitioners in these
petitions.
5. The learned senior counsel representing the petitioners would vehemently contend that a bare
perusal at the complaints would clearly indicate that they are planted ones against the petitioners as
the allegations in the complaints are that the petitioners had threatened and sought to extract
money about 8 months back before registration of complaints. If it were to be extraction of money, it
ought to have been reported immediately and delay in filing the complaints is fatal to the
investigation even.
6. On the other hand, the Special Public Prosecutor-II representing the State would vehemently
refute the submissions to contend that once a cognizable offence is reported with whatever delay, it
would be a matter of investigation and the petitioners cannot call registration of FIRs in question on
their very registration, as investigation has not progressed any further. The police may investigate
and even file a 'B' report if there is no truth in the allegation and, therefore, would seek dismissal of
the petitions. He would submit that his submissions be taken as objections to the petitions
themselves.
7. The learned counsel Sri P.Rudrappa representing the 2nd respondent in Writ Petition No.10029
of 2022 would again refute the submissions of the learned senior counsel to contend that there is
explanation in the complaints for delay of 9 months in registering the complaints, which was due to
fear generated by the petitioners. He would also submit that the complainant is not available for
filing of statement of objections and has only given instructions. Therefore, his arguments be taken
as objections to the petition.
8. I have given my anxious consideration to the submissions made by the respective learned counsel
and perused the material on record.

9. First of the complaint that comes about against the petitioners is impugned in Writ Petition
No.10029 of 2022 which becomes crime in Crime No.143 of 2022 for offences punishable under
Sections 384, 420 and 34 of the IPC. Since the entire issue springs from the complaint, the same is
quoted hereunder for the purpose of quick reference:

(Emphasis added) The allegation in the complaint is that the complainant one Mubarak who claims
to be the owner/driver of a lorry and is in the business of transportation of sand alleges that about 7
to 8 months before 01-05-2022 the petitioners had stopped his vehicle and had demanded money
for further movement of the vehicle. The petitioners are described as underworld dons. Vague dates
are given in this regard. On the basis of the said complaint, the aforesaid crime is registered for the
offences noted supra. Based upon this, the police conduct a search in the house of the petitioner and
drew up a panchanama. No amount is recovered. After conduct of panchanama on 02-05- 2022 and
arrest of the petitioner, a second complaint is registered by a different complainant which is
impugned in the companion writ petition. The 2nd complaint is verbatim similar to the first
complaint supra. The 2nd complaint is registered on 05-05-2022 and reads as follows:

(Emphasis added) The complainant in the 2nd complaint also narrates that on 13.09.2021 the
petitioner had blocked the way and demanded Rs.10,00,000/-. This becomes a crime in Crime
No.68 of 2022. The complainant in the said case though is served through the jurisdictional police
remains unrepresented and the recovery that happens in the entire case is about 128 notes of
Rs.500/- denomination and 3 notes of Rs.2,000/- denomination but not from the petitioner. This is
recovered from accused No.3 in Crime No.143 of 2022. There is no recovery of any amount from the
petitioner.
10. What merits consideration is the contention of the learned senior counsel that the complainants
are ghost complainants as the allegation in the complaints is that extortion has taken place about 9
months before registration of the complaints. There is no explanation except saying that due to fear
there is delay in registration of complaints. If extraction had taken place on 13-09-2021, complaint
could not have been registered on 05-05-5022. Similar goes with the earlier complaint and if
complaints are read in juxtaposition they are verbatim similar. In fact, a few paragraphs are copied
and pasted between the complaints registered on 01-05-2022 and 05-05-2022. Therefore, the very
registration of crime or the happening of the incident becomes doubtful, as delay in registering the
complaints gives rise to embellishment to a particular complaint as is held by the Apex Court in the
case of MANOJ KUMAR SHARMA AND OTHERS v. STATE OF CHHATTISGARH AND
ANOTHER1 , wherein the Apex Court considering the delay in registration of FIR has held as
follows:
"30. Delay in lodging the FIR often results in embellishment, which is a creature of
an afterthought. On account of delay, the FIR not only gets bereft of the advantage of
spontaneity, danger also creeps in of the introduction of a coloured version or
exaggerated story. In our opinion, such extraordinary delay in lodging the FIR raises
grave doubt about the truthfulness of allegations made by Respondent 2 herein
against the appellants, which are, in any case, general in nature. We have no doubt
that by making such reckless and vague allegations, Respondent 2 herein has tried to
rope the appellants in criminal proceedings. We are of the confirmed opinion that
continuation of the criminal proceedings against the appellants pursuant to this FIR
is an abuse of the process of law. Therefore, in the interest of justice, the FIR deserves
to be quashed. In this context, it is apt to quote the following decision of this Court in
Jai Prakash Singh v. State of Bihar [Jai Prakash Singh v. State of Bihar, (2012) 4 SCC
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/85608282/ 8
Imran Siddiqui vs State Of Karnataka on 26 July, 2022
379 :
(2012) 2 SCC (Cri) 468] wherein it was held as under : (SCC p. 383, para 12) "12. The
FIR in a criminal case is a vital and valuable piece of evidence though may not be
substantive piece of evidence. The object of insisting upon prompt lodging of the FIR
in respect of the commission of an offence is to obtain early information regarding
the circumstances in which the crime was committed, the names of the actual culprits
and the part played by them as well as the names of the eyewitnesses present at the
scene of occurrence. If there is a delay in lodging the FIR, it loses the advantage of
spontaneity, danger creeps in of the introduction of coloured version, exaggerated
account or concocted story as a result of large (2016) 9 SCC 1 number of
consultations/deliberations. Undoubtedly, the promptness in lodging the FIR is an
assurance regarding truth of the informant's version. A promptly lodged FIR reflects
the first-hand account of what has actually happened, and who was responsible for
the offence in question."
31. Whether an offence has been disclosed or not, must necessarily depend on the facts and
circumstances of each case. If on consideration of the relevant materials, the court is satisfied that
an offence is disclosed, it will normally not interfere with the investigation into the offence and will
generally allow the investigation into the offence to be completed in order to collect materials for
proving the offence.
32. In the above backdrop, it is also imperative to discuss the scope of inherent power of the High
Court under Section 482 of the Code. The appellants before us filed a petition under Section 482 of
the Code for quashing of the FIR on the ground that the FIR was filed after a delay of 5 (five) years
and is barred by territorial jurisdiction. The High Court, on the other hand, after taking note of the
fact that the investigation is in the final stage in the matter and a charge-sheet is ready to be filed
before the Judicial Magistrate First Class, ordered for its continuance without taking into
consideration that it is barred by law. The court at Durg did not take notice of the fact that there is a
legal bar engrafted in the matter for its continuance and the proceedings have been maliciously
instituted after a delay of five years with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the
appellants."
The other judgments relied on by the learned SPP-II and the learned counsel representing the 2nd
respondent, were all considering delay and explanation thereto. In the case of SHANTABEN
BHURABHAI BHURIYA v. ANAND ATHABHAI CHAUDHARI AND OTHERS - Criminal Appeal
No.967 of 2021 decided on 26th October, 2021, the Apex Court has held that it was the specific case
of the victim that an attempt was made in getting the FIR registered on the very next day of the
incident. That was not registered and a private complaint was filed four days thereafter. In those
circumstances, the Apex Court held that delay was not fatal as the complainant had demonstrated
that a sincere effort was made to register a complaint on 7-09-2013 which was refused to be
registered and as such a private complaint was registered on 13-09-2013. Therefore, the delay
therein was explained and it was only 4 days delay from the date of the incident.

Imran Siddiqui vs State Of Karnataka on 26 July, 2022
11. Insofar as the judgment relied on by the learned counsel representing the 2nd
respondent/complainant in the case of RAVINDER KUMAR AND ANOTHER v. STATE OF
PUNJAB - 2001 Crl.L.J. 4242 the same would become distinguishable on the facts in the case before
the Apex Court. In the said case the Apex Court was considering whether the FIR was registered
after a delay of two days and whether those two days would be fatal to the case of the victim or the
prosecution later. The Apex Court in the said judgment also holds that complaint should be
registered without any loss of time and was declared that it was not to be fatal on the ground that it
was only two days and the delay of two days in lodging the FIR cannot become a ground to quash
the proceedings at the stage of investigation.
12. As observed hereinabove, in the case at hand, the delay is not two days or four days. The delay is
9 months. In the complaint registered on 1-05-2022 the period indicated is about 7 to 8 months ago
and in the verbatim similar complaint registered which is second in line, the date of the incident is
13-09-2021 and the complaints admittedly are registered after about 9 months i.e., on 01-05-2022
and 05-05-2022. It is here the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of MANOJ KUMAR SHARMA
(supra) would be applicable, as the complaints so registered after 9 months are full of
embellishments that too vague embellishment. In the teeth of the aforesaid complaints if further
investigation or proceedings are permitted to continue, it would degenerate into harassment and
result in abuse of the process of law.
13. The Apex Court in the case of STATE OF HARYANA v. BHAJAN LAL2 has laid down postulates
of interference and the same is followed to this day by the Apex Court in plethora of judgments. The
Apex Court at paragraph 102 holds as follows:
"102. In the backdrop of the interpretation of the various relevant provisions of the
Code under Chapter XIV and of the principles of law enunciated by this Court in a
series of decisions relating to the exercise of the extraordinary power under Article
226 or the inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code which we have extracted
and reproduced above, we give the following categories of cases by way of illustration
wherein such power could be exercised either to prevent abuse of the process of any
court or 1992 Supp (1) SCC 335 otherwise to secure the ends of justice, though it may
not be possible to lay down any precise, clearly defined and sufficiently channelised
and inflexible guidelines or rigid formulae and to give an exhaustive list of myriad
kinds of cases wherein such power should be exercised.
(1) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the complaint, even
if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie
constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused.
(2) Where the allegations in the first information report and other materials, if any,
accompanying the FIR do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an
investigation by police officers under Section 156(1) of the Code except under an
order of a Magistrate within the purview of Section 155(2) of the Code.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/85608282/ 10
Imran Siddiqui vs State Of Karnataka on 26 July, 2022
(3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or complaint and the
evidence collected in support of the same do not disclose the commission of any
offence and make out a case against the accused.
(4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable offence but
constitute only a non-cognizable offence, no investigation is permitted by a police
officer without an order of a Magistrate as contemplated under Section 155(2) of the
Code.
(5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently
improbable on the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion
that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused.
(6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of the Code
or the concerned Act (under which a criminal proceeding is instituted) to the
institution and continuance of the proceedings and/or where there is a specific
provision in the Code or the concerned Act, providing efficacious redress for the
grievance of the aggrieved party.
(7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and/or where
the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking
vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and personal
grudge."
(Emphasis supplied) Postulates 1 and 5 would become applicable to the case at hand, as at the
perusal of the complaints it would demonstrate two factors i.e., improbability and mala fide
intention. Therefore, as observed by the Apex Court, in such cases, further proceedings should not
be permitted to continue.
14. For the aforesaid reasons, I pass the following:
ORDER
(i) Writ Petitions are allowed.
(ii) Registration of crimes in Crime No.68 of 2022 before the Harihara Rural Police
and in Crime No.143 of 2022 before Davanagere Rural Police Station are quashed.
In the light of the aforesaid order and for the reasons indicated therein, as a consequence of
quashment of the registration of crime against the petitioners, I.A.No.2/2022 wherein the direction
that was sought to withdraw the lookout notice against the petitioners would stand allowed and the
respondents shall withdraw the lookout notice issued against the petitioners within a period of three
weeks from the date of receipt of the copy of this order.

Imran Siddiqui vs State Of Karnataka on 26 July, 2022
In view of disposal of the main petitions, I.A.No.1/2022 does not survive for consideration.
Accordingly, stands disposed.
