be mentioned that all the 55 different posts were created vide different orders, all dated 16.9.2016.
In para 3 of the absorption order dated 16.9.2016, it is mentioned that Tentative Seniority List of the
officials would be notified at a later stage. On 23.12.2016 by inserting Regulation 71-A in the

[13] Vide order dated 21.8.2023 passed in WP(C) No.513 of 2023, this Court directed the State
respondents to consider the representation submitted by private respondent No.4 herein. In
pursuance of the direction of this Court, the Addl. Chief Secretary, RD & PR, Government of
Manipur passed order dated 25.10.2023 stating that the order of absorption in the post of Assistant
Engineer dated 16.09.2016, promotion order dated 24.12.2016 and promotion order dated 7.1.2022
to the post of Superintending Engineers, are not in order of merit and final seniority list will be
notified later on. Accordingly, representation of the private respondent was disposed of. It is stated
that the petitioner has not challenged this order dated 25.10.2023 of RD&PR Department. [14] The
Joint Secretary, DP, Government of Manipur issued Addendum dated 15.1.2024 inserting the words
"and Empowered Officer" after the words "Chief Engineer, RED/MSSRDA"
in the 4th line of the impugned order dated 6.1.2024. [15] Vide letter dated
22.12.2023 to the Additional Chief Secretary (RD & PR), Government of Manipur, the
outgoing Chief Engineer, RED/MSRRDA also recommended the name of private
respondent No.4 to be appointed as Chief Engineer on in-charge basis as stop gap
arrangement.
[16] Mr. H. S. Paonam, learned senior counsel for the petitioner submits that the
petitioner is at present the senior most in the RD & PR. It is stated that the petitioner
was utilised in the Directorate of RD & PR, Government of Manipur vide order dated
16.10.1999 as Section Officer Grade-I and his service was further utilized in the
MSRRDA as Assistant Engineer in addition to his normal duties. It is also stated that
in the order dated 24.12.2016, wherein 13 Assistant Engineers in the RD & PR, were
promoted as Executive Engineers on regular basis and name of the petitioner appears
at Sl.No.6 and that of private respondent No.4 is at Sl.No.12. In the promotion order
dated 7.1.2022 to the post of Superintending Engineers in RED/MSRRDA, the name
of the petitioner is at Sl.No.2 and that of private respondent No.4 is at Sl.No.3.
Likewise, petitioner was given in-charge of Additional Chief Engineer for
RED/MSRRDA vide order 3.1.2022 while private respondent No.4 was given
OSD/Equivalent to Additional Chief Engineer on 8.1.2022.
[17] It is submitted that in absence of final seniority list of officers in the feeder cadre,
the serial in the promotion order, on the recommendation of a duly constituted DPC,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119341381/ 4
Shri Thokchom Ingoba Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The on 18 March, 2024
would be considered as seniority list for the promotees. In this aspect, learned senior
counsel for the petitioner relies on the Office Memorandum dated 13.11.1987 issued
by the Department of Personnel and Administrative Reforms, Government of
Manipur adopting Office Memorandum dated 7.2.1986 issued by the Department of
Public Grievance and Pension, Government of India with regard to the General
Principles for determining the seniority of various categories of persons employed in
Central Services. [18] Learned senior counsel for the petitioner relies upon a
judgment/order dated 15.12.2023 passed by this Court in WP(C) Nos. 634 of 2023
and 613 of 2023 wherein it was held that in terms of OMs dated 03.10.2020 and
09.03.2021, the seniormost in the feeder cadre has to be considered for appointment
on in charge basis when none is available for direct recruitment or promotion in the
feeder cadre. In absence of a final seniority list in the feeder cadre, it has been held
that the tentative seniority list can be considered for the purpose of the appointment
on in charge basis. In that case, the petitioner was seniormost in the cadre of Deputy
Director and his name was at serial number 1 in the promotion order of Joint
Director on regular basis on the recommendation of duly constituted DPC. None
challenged the appointment orders to Deputy Director and Joint Director. However,
the seniority list of Deputy Director was under challenged and there was no stay
order. The appointment of junior officer was set aside by this Court.
[19] Mr. H. S. Paonam, learned senior counsel cites the judgment of Union of India v.
Tulsiram Patel: (1985) 3 SCC 398 @ Para 24 to the point that the executive
instructions stand on a lower footing than a statutory rule. Reference is made to the
decision of Naga People's Movement of Human Rights v. Union of India: (1988) 2
SCC 109 where it was held that in absence of any rule, the executive instructions will
be treated as binding. Relying on the decision of Union of India v. Raj Grow Implex
LLP: (2021) 18 SCC 601, it is submitted that issuing of Addendum dated 15.01.2024
inserting word 'Empowered Officer' in the impugned order dated 06.01.2024 during
the pendency of the writ petition without leave of this Court is not tenable. It is also
submitted that pendency of a criminal complaint before Vigilance or Lok Ayukta
cannot be considered as pendency of a criminal case against the petitioner.
[20] It is also stated that even if assuming that there is no final seniority list, the
petitioner being senior in age, i.e. his date of birth 1.3.1965 than that of respondent
No.4, i.e. 31.12.1966, he would be senior to the respondent No.4. Mr.Paonam, learned
senior counsel also highlighted that the name of the petitioner was recommended by
the Administrative Committee for appointment as in-charge Chief Engineer, RED.
However, the Deptt of Personnel has ignored the opinion of the Administrative
Department and the same cannot be done in violation of Rules of Business of the
Government of Manipur. It is stated that the Minister (MAHUD/RD&PR) also
expressed his displeasure for appointing respondent No.4 without his approval.
[21] Learned senior counsel for the petitioner draws attention of this Court to the
Office Memorandum dated 3.10.2020 issued by the Department of Personnel &
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119341381/ 5
Shri Thokchom Ingoba Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The on 18 March, 2024
Administrative Reforms, Government of Manipur, laying guidelines for making
in-charge appointment where eligible persons are not available for promotion. It is
stated in para 4 that "4. Thus, with a view to bring uniformly, clarity and enforceable
norms in making such in-charge appointment, the following norms are nearby issued
for compliance by all concerned:
i. Appointment on in-charged basis shall be made against a post only when there is
no official eligible as per RR to fulfil the said post either by direct recruitment or
promotion through duly constituted DPC.
ii. In absence of any official eligible as per RR to fill up a particular post, the senior
most person amongst cadre/officials belonging to the feeder post of the said
particular post shall be appointed to hold the said post on in-charged basis, at no
extra remuneration and in addition to the substantial post held by the appointee in
lower post. Needless to say, the appointee shall draw pay against the lower post
substantially held by him.
iii. Where no arrangement can be made as in para (ii) above, an in-charge
appointment shall be made to a vacant post from a person holding a similar post (at
same rank and/or designation), at no extra remuneration.
iv. An official appointed on in-charge basis against any post shall have the same
financial power as a person appointed on substantial basis against the said post
would enjoy.
5. These instructions shall be applicable while making appointments on in-charge
basis to all posts under the State Government existing in all Government
departments, agencies, societies, bodies, offices, companies, PSUs, autonomous
bodies, etc."
[22] Further the Department of Personnel also issued another Memorandum dated 9.3.2021
inserting para (v) to the OM dated 3.10.2020, which is reproduced hereunder:
"GOVERNMENT OF MANIPUR DEPARTMENT OF PERSONNEL &
ADMINISTRATIVE REFORMS (PERSONNEL DIVISION) OFFICE
MEMORANDUM Imphal, the 9th March, 2021 No.23/20/2019 Misc (PHED)/DP: In
continuation of this Department's office Memorandum rd No.23/20/2019-Misc
(PHED) dated 3 October, 2020 regarding appointment on in-charge basis to various
posts and conditions for making such appointment etc. The following norms are
hereby issued for compliance by all concerned in addition to para 4
(i)(ii)(iii)(iv) of Department of Personnel Office Memorandum of even number dated
3rd October, 2020:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119341381/ 6
Shri Thokchom Ingoba Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The on 18 March, 2024
(v) "Integrity certificate based on Vigilance Clearance, non-pendency of
Departmental Enquiry, non-pendency of FIR cases which has been taken cognizance
by Magistrate etc is mandatory or in-
charge appointments, especially the Head of Departments".
[23] Another OM dated 4.9.2023 was inserted in case of HOD, which is also reproduced hereunder.
"GOVERNMENT OF MANIPUR DEPARTMENT OF PERSONNEL &
ADMINISTRATIVE REFORMS (PERSONNEL DIVISION) OFFICE
MEMORANDUM Imphal, the 4th Sept, 2023 No.23/20/2019-Misc (PHED)/DP: In
continuation of this Department's O.M of even no. dated 03.10.2020 and 9.3.2021
regarding appointments on n-charge basis to various posts and conditions for making
such appointments etc, the following shall be added at Para 4(ii) after the existing
provision:
However, in the case of HoDs, if more than one person is holding the senior most
feeder post, then the selection of the person to hold the post shall be done from
amongst these officers taking into regard proven leadership qualities and
administrative efficiency, apart from the conditions at sub-para (v)."
[24] Referring to the above three OMs, learned senior counsel summits that when none is available,
the seniormost in the feeder cadre has to be considered for making in-charge in the higher post and
in case of HOD, Vigilance clearance, non-pendency of departmental enquiry and non-pendency of
FIR are to be examined. [25] On conjoint reading of the three OMs it is submitted that if eligible
persons as per Rule are not available for promotion, the senior most amongst the feeder cadre shall
be appointed to hold the post on in-charge basis, provided such persons are not facing any
Departmental Enquiry or criminal case against him. In case of multiple candidates having same
seniority, the most competent persons with proven leadership quality and administrative exigency
have to be considered.
[26] It is submitted that in the present case, the respondent No.4 does not satisfy any of the criteria
as laid down in the three Office Memoranda, as the respondent No.4 is neither senior most nor a
person with proven leadership quality and his name has not been cleared by the Vigilance and as
such, the impugned order dated 6.1.2024 conferring in-charge Chief Engineer, RED/MSRRDA to
respondent No.4 is violation of the above OMs. Even the concerned Minister expressed his
displeasure in the appointment of respondent No.4.
[27] Mr. H. S. Paonam, learned senior counsel submits that the impugned order issued in violation
of the OMs which are binding to the State Government in absence of any statutory rules, ought to be
set aside. The impugned order also has not taken into consideration the views of the Administrative
Department. [28] Per contra, Mr. M. Rarry, learned Special State Counsel draws the attention of this
Court to order dated 16.09.2016 where 55 employees who were working in the RD&PR on
deputation from various departments were absorbed in the newly established/created Rural
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119341381/ 7
Shri Thokchom Ingoba Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The on 18 March, 2024
Engineering Department. All the posts were created on 16.09.2016 and the name of the respondent
No.4 was shown at serial No. 18 as AE(Civil) while that of the petitioner was shown at serial No. 21
as AE(Civil). The outgoing Chief Engineer was shown at serial No. 5 as EE(Civil). It was mentioned
in the absorption order dated 16.09.2016 that Tentative Seniority List would be notified later on. It
is submitted that the petitioner has concealed this vital order in his writ petition. It is pointed out
that no tentative or final seniority list has been issued in the newly created RED till date and in
absence of any seniority list, the serial mentioned in absorption order dated 16.09.2016 can be
considered for making appointment on in charge basis in terms of the OMs cited by the petitioner.
Mr. M. Rarry has pointed out that this is permissible in terms of order dated 15.12.2023 passed by
this Court in WP(C) No. 634 of 2023 (as relied by the petitioner herein above). [29] Mr. M. Rarry
has pointed out that criminal complaints are pending against the petitioner and as such he was
overlooked in terms of OM dated 09.03.2021. It is stated that order dated 31.08.2023 passed by this
Court in WP(C) No. 527 of 2023, the appointment of a junior was upheld due to pendency of
criminal case against the senior. It is pointed out that Mr. H.S. Paonam, learned senior counsel
successfully argued in favour of the junior officer.
[30] Referring to the Rules of Business, Mr. M. Rarry, learned counsel for the State has submitted
that Chief Minister (also in charge of DP) is the competent authority for the appointment of the head
of department. Reference is made to the order dated 25.10.2023 issued by RD&PR that the final
seniority list of AE, EE and SE in RED is not settled and the petitioner has not challenged this order.
Accordingly, the petitioner cannot be treated as a senior in terms of the promotion orders to AE, EE
and SE. It is pointed out that petitioner was appointed as SO in the year 1999 while respondent No.4
was appointed in the year 1991. In absence of any tentative or final seniority list in the cadres of AE,
EE and SE, the appointment dates for SO can be considered for the purpose of in charge
appointments in terms of the above three OMs.
[31] It is also submitted that for obtaining an interim order of stay of the impugned order, the
relevant materials should be shown by the petitioner from his petition. The three cardinal principles
of prima facie case, balance of convenience and irreparable loss, should be apparent on plain
reading of the petition. Mr. Rarry has vehemently submitted that the petitioner has miserably failed
to do so and on the very first day of hearing for motion, learned senior counsel for the petitioner
prayed for calling the relevant government file to establish the prima facie case. It is also stated that
the balance of convenience is also in favour of the respondents as the respondent No.4 is running
the RED and no irreparable loss will occur to the petitioner. If stay is granted, the department and
the general public will suffer. It is also stated that the petitioner has not produced all the documents
and has concealed those which are averse to him. It is submitted that the writ petition be dismissed
at this stage being devoid of merit and for concealment of material facts and documents.
[32] Mr. M. Hemchandra, learned senior counsel for the respondent No.4 has raised two
preliminary objections of material facts and incomplete impugned order (ie, addendum dated
15.01.2024 to impugned order dated 06.01.2024 issued after filing of writ petition and not
challenged by the petitioner). It is stated that the petitioner has concealed absorption order dated
16.09.2016 of 55 employees of RED including the petitioner and respondent No.4. In the absorption
order the name of the respondent No.4 was placed at serial number 18 while that of the petitioner at
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119341381/ 8
Shri Thokchom Ingoba Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The on 18 March, 2024
21. Similarly, in Notification dated 23.12.2016 for adding Regulation 71A for exemption from
consulting MPSC, the name of respondent No.4 appeared at serial number 18 while that of the
petitioner at 21. In the order dated 25.10.2023, it has been clarified that all the absorption and
promotion orders in RED are not in order of merit and final seniority list will be notified later on.
This order is not challenged by the petitioner. It is pointed out that the petitioner has concealed all
these vital documents and he has wrongly claimed as senior on the basis of promotion orders to the
post of EE and SE. It is stated that as per the recommendation of outgoing Chief Engineer, the
private respondent is senior to the petitioner by eight years as considered from the date of initial
appointment in the cadre of SO. It is submitted that there is no material to show that the petitioner
is senior to the respondent No.4 and as such he cannot invoke the OMs dated 03.12.2020,
09.03.2021 and 04.09.2023 to claim his right for appointment as in charge Chief Engineer of RED.
Reference is made to the decisions cited as (2005) 10 SCC 274, (2008) 12 SCC 481, (2013) 2 SCC
398, 2009 (2) GLT 252, 197 (1) GLT 669, (1991) 2 SCC 733 and AIR 2022 SC 1361. It is prayed that
the writ petition be dismissed being devoid of any merit and for concealing the material facts.
[33] This Court considered the materials on record including original file. At first, this Court
proposes to dispose of this case at motion stage on the basis of available records without calling for
reply from the respondents, as the parties have argued extensively for three days. However, in views
of the serious disputed facts with regard to the question of seniority, the only the limited question of
granting interim order is taken up. On perusal of original file, it is seen that both the names of the
petitioner and respondent No.4 were considered by the DP on the basis of materials submitted by
the Administrative Department and finally, the respondent No.4 was appointed as CE/RED on in
charge basis.
[34] In order dated 15.12.2023 in WP(C) No. 634 of 2023 and 613 of 2023, this Court held that in
terms of OMs dated 03.10.2020 and 09.03.2021, the seniormost in the feeder cadre should be
considered for appointment on in-charge basis, if eligible candidates are not available as per rules. It
was further held that tentative seniority list can be considered for appointment on in-
charge basis. Accordingly, this Court set aside the appointment of private respondent and directed
to appoint the petitioner who was seniormost in the feeder cadre. However, vide order dated
09.02.2024 in WA No. 112 of 2023, a Division Bench of this Court directed the State respondent to
decide the matter afresh in terms of the OMs dated 03.10.2020 and 09.03.2021. The findings of the
Single Judge with regard to the appointment on in-charge basis as per the OMs have not been
disturbed by the Division Bench. [35] In the present case, the question of seniority in Rural
Engineering Department is not finalised till date. The same is evident from the orders dated
16.09.2016 and 25.10.2023 issued by RD&PR Department, Govt. of Manipur. On the basis of
available materials, this Court is not able to arrive at a tentative opinion with regard to inter se
seniority between the petitioner qua the respondent No.4 for applicability of the OMs dated
03.10.2020, 09.03.2021 and 04.09.2023. There are rival documents in this regard and the same
cannot be decided at this stage without going through in details the replies of the party.
[36] Accordingly, this Court is not inclined to pass any interim order against the impugned order
dated 06.01.2024 appointing the respondent No.4 as in charge Chief Engineer, RED/MSRRDA at
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119341381/ 9
Shri Thokchom Ingoba Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The on 18 March, 2024
this stage. The matter needs detailed consideration upon filing of replies from parties.
[37] List this case on 24.04.2024 for further consideration. The respondents may file counter
affidavits and rejoinder affidavits by petitioner, if necessary, on or before next date with advance
copies to other side.
[38] Return original files to learned counsel for State respondents.
