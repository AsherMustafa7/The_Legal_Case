W.P.No.2229/2017.
For the sake of clarity and convenience, facts as narrated in W.P. W.P.No.1930/2017 are being taken
note of.
2. The petitioners have filed this petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India while
praying for following reliefs:-
" (i) That, the Hon'ble Court may kindly be pleased to issue the writ of mandamus
concern respondent authority to quash the impugned order dated 15/12/2015
passeed by the Collector in R.C.No.67B-121 year 15-16, in the interest of justice.
(ii) That, the Hon'ble Court may kindly be issue writ of mandamus concern
respondent authority to provide rehablitation to petitioner as per the scheme of the
rehabilitation of the respondent authority, in the interest of justice.
(iii) Any other relief/order, which this Hon'ble Court deemed fit looking to the facts
and circumstances of the case in the end of justice."
3. The facts narrated in the petition reveal that the petitioner is a resident of Village Rorighat, Tehsil
Pipariya, District-Hoshangabad. As the Village Rorighat was to be acquired for the purposes of the
Satpura Tiger Reserve Pachmarhi, the claims of the residents as regards compensation and other
benefits were to be decided in terms of Rehabilitation Policy. The petitioner being a resident of
Village Rorighat/Roritola, submitted all documents seeking benefit of the Rehabilitation Policy. As
the representation submitted by the petitioner was not being decided yet by the respondents, the
petitioner approached this Court by filing W.P.No.16418/2015.
4. This Court vide order dated 05.10.2015 directed the Collector Hoshangabad to take a decision on
the petitioner's grievance. Thereafter, the Collector Hoshangabad by passing the impugned order
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21859719/ 33
Raju vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 24 April, 2023
dated 15.12.2015 has rejected the claim of the petitioner. Thus, assailing the order dated 15.12.2015,
this petition has been filed by the petitioner. In few connected petitions, similar impugned orders
have been passed on a different date i.e. 30.01.2016.
5. Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that the Collector Hoshangabad has grossly erred in
passing the impugned order dated 15.12.2015 (Annexure P/5) inasmuch as, the Collector was
required to appreciate the definition of "displaced family" (foLFkkfir ifjokj). As the father of the
petitioner owned land in Village Rorighat, the petitioner being a major son at the time of issuance of
notification under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 [hereinafter referred to as "Act of
1894"] was a separate unit and therefore, the case of the petitioner was to be considered while
including the petitioner to be a separate unit in terms of the Rehabilitation Policy. But,
unfortunately, the Collector Hoshangabad in complete ignorance of the provisions of the said Policy,
has proceeded to reject the claim of the petitioner vide impugned order dated 15.12.2015 (Annexure
P/5).
6. Learned counsel further contends that the Rehabilitation Policy further contains Appendix-2 and
which provides that an adult son or daughter of the displaced family shall be treated as a separate
unit. Therefore, counsel submits that if the impugned order is subjected to Argus-eyed scrutiny in
view of the Rehabilitation Policy, the same would reveal that the same is patently unsustainable.
Thus, counsel prays that the impugned order dated 15.12.2015 deserves to be quashed.
7. Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent/State contends that in this bunch of writ petitions,
the order of Collector Hoshangabad dated 15.12.2015 is being assailed who has passed the order in
terms of Sections 24 and 25 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972 [hereinafter referred to as "Act of
1972"]. Counsel for the respondent/State further contends that the Collector Hoshangabad deemed
to be a Collector proceeding under the provisions of the Act of 1894 by virtue of Section 25 (1)(a) of
Act of 1972. Accordingly, any decision taken by the Collector is treated as an award and if a party or
person is aggrieved by the said decision, the remedy is to seek reference in terms of Section 18 of Act
of 1894.
8. Learned counsel for the respondent/State also contends that the writ petition involves disputed
question of facts inasmuch as, the petitioner's eligibility for compensation has been doubted by the
Collector Hoshangabad. Such facts need to be adjudicated upon sifting and appreciation of evidence,
which is not permissible under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. Therefore, counsel for the
respondent/State submits that the petitioner can take recourse to the remedy available under
Section 18 of the Act of 1894. Accordingly, the present petition is not maintainable as apparently the
impugned order of the Collector Hoshangabad having been passed in consonance with the material
placed before him, requires no interference.
9. Heard the submissions advanced on behalf of the parties and perused the record.
10. A perusal of the impugned order dated 15.12.2015 (Annexure P/5) passed in W.P.No.1927/2017,
W.P.No.1926/2017, W.P.No.1928/2017, W.P.No.1930/2017 (present petition), W.P.No.1931/2017,
W.P.No.1935/2017, W.P.No.1940/2017, W.P.No.1944/2017, W.P.No.1945/2017, W.P.No.1947/2017,

dated 30.01.2016 (Annexure P/5) passed in W.P.No.1934/2017, W.P.No.2135/2017,
W.P.No.2136/2017, W.P.No.2138/2017, W.P.No.2140/2017, W.P.No.2141/2017, W.P.No.2142/2017
by the Collector Hoshangabad, reflects that the Collector proceeded to decide the application
submitted by the petitioners in terms of the provisions of Chapter-IV of Act of 1972.
11. In terms of the Section 19 of Act of 1972, the Collector Hoshangabad is empowered to determine
the rights and in terms of Section 21 of the Act of 1972 and Collector Hoshangabad is also authorized
to carry out the proclamation. In terms of Section 24 of the Act of 1972, the question as regards
acquisition of right of compensation is decided by the Collector. Section 25 of the Act of 1972 which
is being germane for the purposes of the instant matter is extracted hereinunder:-
"Section 25. Acquisition proceedings.
(1) For the purpose of acquiring such land, or rights in or over such land,
(a) the Collector shall be deemed to be a Collector, proceeding under the Land
Acquisition Act, 1894 (1 of 1894);
(b) the claimant shall be deemed to be a person interested and appearing before him
in pursuance of a notice given under section 9 of that Act;
(c) the provisions of the sections, preceding section 9 of that Act, shall be deemed to
have been complied with;
(d) where the claimant does not accept the award made in his favour in the matter of
compensation, he shall be deemed, within the meaning of section 18 of the Act, to be
a person interested who has not accepted the award, and shall be entitled to proceed
to claim relief against the award under the provisions of Part III of that Act;
(e) the Collector, with the consent of the claimant, or the court, with the consent of
both the parties, may award compensation in land or money or partly in land and
partly in money; and
(f) in the case of the stoppage of a public way or a common pasture, the Collector
may, with the previous sanction of the State Government, provide for an alternative
public way or common pasture, as far as may be practicable or convenient.

Raju vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 24 April, 2023
(2) The acquisition under this Act of any land or interest therein shall be deemed to
be acquisition for a public purpose."
12. A perusal of the provisions of Section 25 of the Act of 1972 reflects that the Collector is treated to
be a Collector in terms of Act of 1894 and therefore, when a decision is taken by the Collector the
same is treated to be an award. Thus, a claimant who does not accept the award passed by the
Collector, has the remedy to seek reference under Section 18 of the Act of 1894.
13. Therefore, as there exists an alternative and efficacious remedy, interference at this stage is not
warranted. Moreover, disputed question of facts are involved which require sifting of the evidence
and material, which are to be adduced and produced by the both the parties before the Court.
14. In view of the aforesaid, the present petition stands disposed of while extending liberty to the
petitioner to move proper application seeking reference of the order passed by the Collector
Hoshangabad dated 15.12.2015 (Annexure P/5) as well as order dated 30.01.2016 (Annexure P/5),
as per Section 18 of the Act of 1894. If the petitioner approaches the Collector Hoshangabad within a
period of 30 days from today, the Collector Hoshangabad shall take steps in accordance with Section
19 of the Act of 1972 within a further period of 90 days and refer the matter to the concerned Court
for proper adjudication.
15. It is hereby made clear that this Court has not expressed any opinion on merits of the case.
16. With the aforesaid observation and direction, the present petition as well as connected writ
petitions stand disposed of.
