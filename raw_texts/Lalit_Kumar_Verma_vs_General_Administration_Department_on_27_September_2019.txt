ORDER
(Passed on 27/09/2019) The petitioner has filed the present petition challenging the order dated
04/05/2017 (Annexure-P/1) passed by respondent No.5 whereby terminating the services of the
petitioner on the ground of false caste certificate.
2. Facts in brief are that on 07/07/1989 the petitioner applied for appointment on the post of
Tehsildar on the basis that he belongs to Scheduled Caste i.e. Manjhi. The Tehsildar has granted this
certificate to the petitioner on 07/07/1989. Thereafter, the petitioner has lost the original caste
certificate, he therefore, again applied for the same and obtained the same from Tehsildar on
28/09/1993. The petitioner was initially appointed on the post of Assistant Teacher on 28/02/1994
and he confirmed on the said post on 05/03/2001. The petitioner was appointed on the basis of
caste certificate of Scheduled Caste issued in his favour by the Tehsildar. Thereafter, show-
(Lalit Kumar Verma S/o Late Shri Bholuram Verma vs. State of M.P. and others) cause notice was
issued to the petitioner on 22/11/2016. The petitioner has filed the reply to the said show-cause
notice on 16/01/2017. In the meanwhile, some complaint was made regarding the caste certificate
issued to the petitioner and the High Power Committee has rejected petitioner's caste certificate,
therefore, he has filed W.P. No.3090/2017 before this Court and this Court has stayed the order of
the said Committee vide order dated 16/05/2017. The petitioner has informed this fact to the
respondents, however, without considering, the respondent No.5 had passed the order dated
04/05/2017 whereby terminating the services of the petitioner on the ground of producing a false
caste certificate. Being aggrieved by that order, petitioner has filed the present writ petition.

3. Learned senior counsel for the petitioner submits that the impugned order is illegal and contrary
to law. It is submitted that the State Government had taken a decision in the memorandum dated
17/02/2014 for those persons who belongs to Kewat, Mallah, Shimar, Nishad, Bhoi, Kahar etc. are
sub-castes of Tribe Manjhi and the persons who had appointed in Government Services before the
issuance of memorandum should be protected. In the present case, caste certificate of the petitioner
was issued on 07/07/1989 and 28/09/1993, therefore, in light of the said direction of the State
Government, impugned order deserves to be quashed. He submitted that the Government is seized
off whether Kewat, Mallah, Dhimar, Bhoi, Nishad, Kahar etc. are the sub-castes of Manjhi and to be
included in Scheduled Tribe. Consequently, (Lalit Kumar Verma S/o Late Shri Bholuram Verma vs.
State of M.P. and others) Government of M.P. Tribal Welfare Department sent recommendations of
the Committee constituted by the respondent No.1 on the matter about inclusion of Dheemar,
Kewat, Kahar, Bhoi, Mallah, Nishad in the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes), vide Office
Memorandum dated 15/01/2003. On 22/01/2004 the Government of M.P. Department of Primitive
Caste and Schedule Caste Welfare Department, Bhopal issued the office memorandum and it was
specifically directed to the respondent No.5 that the case of the persons having certificate of Manjhi
caste should not be investigated as the concerned Committee has recommended that Kewat, Mallah,
Dhimar, Dhiwar, Nishad, Bhoi, Kahar etc. are equivalent to Manjhi and Majhwar caste. State of
made recommendations to the Government of India to notify Kewat, Mallah, Dhiwar, Nishad, Bhoi,
Kahar etc. as Scheduled Tribe like Manjhi and Majhwar.
4. It is argued that in spite of said memorandum, the services of the petitioner have been
terminated. He further submits that vide order dated 16/05/2017 this Court granted stay in favour
of the petitioner. He argued that in the present case, the allegations against the petitioner is not that
he procured and produced a forged caste certificate, rather the case of the respondent No.5 is that
the caste certificate issued to the petitioner is wrong. Thus, it is not the mistake on the part of the
petitioner, therefore, the petition deserves to be allowed.
5. Learned Government Advocate for the respondents/State have filed their and in the reply they
have stated that a (Lalit Kumar Verma S/o Late Shri Bholuram Verma vs. State of M.P. and others)
complaint has been made by one Kamal S/o Tulsiram Loghade to the Assistant Commissioner,
Tribal Welfare Department, Khargone against the petitioner that he obtained the appointment by
producing false certificate. It is further stated that Manjhi is not the Schedule Caste in the
District-Khargone and investigation was conducted by Assistant Commissioner, Bhikangaon and in
the enquiry SDO has found that the petitioner belongs to Manjhi caste. On the basis of said
allegation, D.E. was also initiated against the petitioner. The SDO in his report has found that in
Khasra entries as well as revenue entries, the caste of the petitioner has been shown as Kahar, which
comes in Schedule Tribe and recommended for termination of the petitioner from the service. In the
D.E. It was found that petitioner belongs to Kahar caste, which includes Schedule Tribe. In the D.E.
Petitioner was given full opportunity of hearing and thereafter on the basis of evidence Enquiry
Officer came to the conclusion that petitioner has obtained the appointment by producing a false
caste certificate. Thus, the impugned order has rightly been passed, therefore, petition deserves to
be dismissed.

6. Petitioner has filed the rejoinder to the reply and in the rejoinder, it is stated that State
Government has taken a decision to give protection to those persons who have caste certificate of
Manjhi, Dhiwar, Kahar, Bhoi, Kewat, Mallah, Nishad etc. Thus, as the said fact has not been
controverted by the respondents in their reply. The State Government has found that Dhiwar,
Kahar, Bhoi, Kewat, Mallah, Nishad are the sub-castes of Manjhi and as the petitioner belongs to
Kahar, (Lalit Kumar Verma S/o Late Shri Bholuram Verma vs. State of M.P. and others) therefore,
certificate which is produced by the petitioner cannot be said to be forged certificate. It is further
stated that as per the decision of Kumari Madhuri Patel vs. Addl. Commissioner (1994) 6 SCC 241
the High Power Committee is empowered to decide the issue regarding false caste certificate.
7. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.
8. In the present case, the petitioner was initially appointed on the post of Assistant Teacher on the
basis of caste certificate issued by SDO that the petitioner belongs to Manjhi (Kahar) caste. A
complaint has been made against the petitioner stating that the petitioner has obtained the
appointment by producing a false caste certificate, therefore, the Additional Commissioner has
directed SDO to make an enquiry. Accordingly, the investigation was conducted and SDO has found
that petitioner does not belongs to Manjhi caste, therefore, he recommended for terminating the
services of the petitioner, thereafter Departmental Enquiry has initiated and that D.E. in the
investigation it was found that certificate which is produced by the petitioner belongs to Kahar caste,
which comes in Schedule Tribe, therefore, his services were terminated. Being aggrieved by the said,
petitioner filed the present petition.
9. In the present case, State Government has constituted a High Power Committee about inclusion
of Dhimar, Kewat, Kahar, Bhoi, Mallah, Nishad in the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Orders, 1950.
Thereafter the State Government has (Lalit Kumar Verma S/o Late Shri Bholuram Verma vs. State
of M.P. and others) taken a decision in the year 2014 and on 01/01/2018 the persons who belongs to
Dhimar, Kahar, Bhoi, Kewat, Mallah, Nishard etc. caste and have caste certificate of Manjhi,
Schedule Tribe and in pursuance to it have got appointment in government service in educational
institutes before 11/11/2005 shall have the protection with respect to the said certificate.
10. In the present case, caste certificate of the petitioner is issued on 07/07/1989 and 28/09/1993
and he was appointed in the government service on 28/09/1994 i.e. prior to 11/11/2005 and
therefore, in light of the decision taken by the State Government his services should not have been
terminated. This Court is, therefore, of the considered opinion that the present petition deserves to
be and is hereby allowed. The impugned order/proceedings dated 04/05/2017 (Annexure-P/1)
passed by respondent No.5 whereby terminating the services of the petitioner on the ground of false
caste certificate is hereby quashed. The respondents are directed to re-instate the petitioner in
service alongwith all consequential benefits.
11. With the aforesaid, petition stands disposed finally.
C.C. as per rules.
