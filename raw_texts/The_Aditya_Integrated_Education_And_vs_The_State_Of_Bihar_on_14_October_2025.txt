General Notice vide P.R. No.001398 (BQC) 2024-25 issued by
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187693211/ 2
The Aditya Integrated Education And ... vs The State Of Bihar on 14 October, 2025
the respondent-Bihar University of Health Sciences, Patna (for
short 'the University') under the signature of its Registrar
Patna High Court CWJC No.11464 of 2024 dt.14-10-2025
3/24
informing that the institution imparting nursing courses of
undergraduate degree as of Auxilliary Nurse and Midwife
Course (A.N.M.) and Diploma courses in Pharmacy have to
obtain recognition from the University concerned. The
petitioner also sought a direction upon the concerned respondent
to refund the affiliation fee deposited/paid by the institute to the
respondent-University.
4. The institution duly established through a trust,
actively involved in imparting training to nursing students
through its private nursing and pharmacy schools got its
affiliation from Indian Nursing Council, New Delhi and
Pharmacy Council of India, New Delhi. The school of Nursing
is named as the Mother Terasa School of Nursing, Biharsharif,
Nalanda. The school of Pharmacy is named as Aditya Talhagat
Institute of Pharmacy, Biharsharif, Nalanda. Both the schools
are conducting diploma courses in the respective discipline.
5. After coming into force of University Act, 2021 (for
short 'the Act, 2021') under Notification dated 9th of August,
2021 and Act No.19/2021, a general notice was published in the
daily newspaper(s) that a private institution/college/school
conducting nursing and pharmacy courses have to take
recognition/no objection certificate for continuing its courses in
Patna High Court CWJC No.11464 of 2024 dt.14-10-2025

coming academic session.
6. In pursuant thereto, the petitioner deposited the
prescribed affiliation fee of both the institutes along with all the
relevant documents. In the list of institutions/schools to which
the provisional affiliation has been granted, the name of the
petitioner-institution/school did not find place. The petitioner
having been realized upon the scrutiny of the law enumerated in
the Act, 2021, the University is only authorized to grant
affiliation to the institute which is conducting courses of
Bachelor and Higher Degrees, not to the institute conducting
course of Diploma and other certificate courses, have preferred
the present writ petition by putting under challenge the general
notice bearing no. PR001398 (BQC) 2024-2 (Annexure-9),
whereby the institutes/schools were directed to get its affiliation
from the respondent-University.
C.W.J.C. No.4610 of 2025
7. The petitioners-institutes, represented through their
Executive Secretary have sought a direction by invoking the
jurisdiction of this Court commanding upon the respondents,
especially the Controller of Examination, D. Pharm
Examination Committee to take steps towards registration and
examination of the students of the petitioners-institution for
Patna High Court CWJC No.11464 of 2024 dt.14-10-2025
5/24
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187693211/ 4
The Aditya Integrated Education And ... vs The State Of Bihar on 14 October, 2025
D. Pharm Courses for the Academic Session 2023-2024 in view
of the approval granted by the Pharmacy Council of India, since
the said course has been continuously running from the Session
2018 after getting approval of affiliation by the Controller of
Examination, Diploma in Pharmacy and No Objection was also
given by the Department of Health and Family Welfare,
Government of Bihar.
8. The petitioners-institutions have been imparting D.
Pharm Course since 2018 and the examinations were duly
conducted till Session 2022-2023 without there being any
hindrances. Further vide decision letter dated 31.05.2023 issued
under the signature of the In-charge Registrar-cum-Secretary,
the Pharmacy Council of India, approval was also accorded to
the petitioners-institutions for running D.Pharm course for
Academic Session 2023-2024 for an intake of 60 students. The
name of the Examining Body has been mentioned as the
Controller of Examination, Diploma in Pharmacy. Similar
approval is accorded for the Academic Session 2024-2025 by
the Pharmacy Council of India to the petitioners-institution.
However, noticing the fact that D.Pharm course of Sessions
2023-2024 is running late and the registration and examination
form filling dates has not been published, the petitioners
Patna High Court CWJC No.11464 of 2024 dt.14-10-2025
6/24
approached before the concerned authorities to do the needful. It
has been informed through letter no.15/25 dated 07.01.2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187693211/ 5
The Aditya Integrated Education And ... vs The State Of Bihar on 14 October, 2025
issued under the signature of Controller of Examination,
Diploma in Pharmacy that in view of letter dated 28.03.2024 of
the State Government, the consent of affiliation is not possible
to be given for subsequent academic session. Besides, it has
been informed that after coming into force of the Act, 2021, the
Bihar University of Health Sciences, Mithapur has been duly
established and all the self financed professional institution
engaged/established for medical education in different sectors of
Health Sciences within the State of Bihar will be deemed to be
affiliated with the Bihar University of Health Sciences. In the
aforesaid premise, this writ petition has been filed.
9. The seminal issues raised in both the writ petitions
are one and identical; hence, the same are being considered and
disposed off by a common order.
10. Mr. Binit Kumar, learned Advocate for the
petitioner in C.W.J.C. No.11464 of 2024 has submitted that the
University under the Act, 2021 has been only authorized to
grant affiliation to the institutes, which are conducting course of
Bachelor and Higher Degrees and not to the institute conducting
course of Diploma and other smaller degrees. Taking this Court
Patna High Court CWJC No.11464 of 2024 dt.14-10-2025
7/24
through the Act, 2021, especially definitions clauses, it is
submitted that there is no iota of confusion that the Act, 2021
clarifies that 'College' means a college teaching courses leading
to a Bachelor or Higher degree in Modern System of Medicine,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187693211/ 6
The Aditya Integrated Education And ... vs The State Of Bihar on 14 October, 2025
AYUSH systems of Education, Education on Laboratory
Technology, Physiotherapy & Occupational Therapy, Speech
Therapy and Education on the other Paramedical Courses and
inter disciplinary areas such as Health Economics, health
administration etc. Simultaneously, Section 2(xi) says that
'Courses' means courses leading to a Bachelor or Higher degree
in relevant streams of Health Sciences and such other courses as
notified by the Government in future. The Act, 2021 does not
talk about diploma and other certificate courses. Moreover, the
institute in question is already recognized by the Nursing
Council of India and the Pharmacy Council of India for running
the nursing courses and D.Pharm. The respondent-University
cannot direct the institute(s) to get it affiliated with the Bihar
University of Health Sciences, Mithapur after depositing
prescribed fees.
11. Referring to Section 4(3), it is further submitted
that the afore-noted prescription starts from non obstante clause
having overriding effect to certain provisions over some
Patna High Court CWJC No.11464 of 2024 dt.14-10-2025
8/24
contrary provisions that may be found either in the same
enactment or other enactment. The Act, 2021 clearly excludes
diploma and certificate course, as it has not been included in the
definition of "Course". Reliance has also been placed on a
decision rendered in Union of India v. G.M. Kokil & Others,
1984 (Supp) SCC 196.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187693211/ 7
The Aditya Integrated Education And ... vs The State Of Bihar on 14 October, 2025
12. Mr. Amit Shrivastava, learned Senior Advocate
duly assisted by Mr. Ritesh Kumar, learned Advocate for the
petitioners in C.W.J.C. No.4610 of 2025 have submitted that
bare perusal of Section 2(viii) and (xi) of the Act, 2021, it is
evident that the University does not have jurisdiction to take
examination or grant certificate for Diploma courses. The
University has got jurisdiction over the colleges imparting
higher degrees in different streams of Modern System of
Medicine. Similarly the University can take examination and
award degrees/certificates to the institutions imparting Modern
System of Medicine from Bachelor of Higher Degrees.
13. Presently, the petitioners-institutions have filed the
writ petition to conduct examination of the students of D. Pharm
courses, which is lower than the Bachelor Degree and only
certificate is awarded. It is further contended that as per the
guidelines issued by the Pharmacy Council of India, for change
Patna High Court CWJC No.11464 of 2024 dt.14-10-2025
9/24
of Examining Authority, the letter of disaffiliation and no
objection certificate from previous Examining Authority and
affiliation/consent letter of the new Examining Authority are
required. In the present case, the petitioners will have to get
disaffiliation letter from the department of health and family
welfare and will then have to apply before the Bihar University
of Health Sciences, Patna for grant of affiliation/consent of
affiliation and No Objection for the Academic Session 2023-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187693211/ 8
The Aditya Integrated Education And ... vs The State Of Bihar on 14 October, 2025
2024 and 2024-2025. Since there is no provision for grant of
retrospective affiliation to any institution, the contention of the
respondents to the effect that the petitioners will have to
approach before the Bihar University of Health Sciences, Patna
for grant of affiliation for taking examination is wholly without
jurisdiction. The action of the respondents will ruin the careers
of the students, who have already taken admission in the
petitioners-institutions for the Academic Session 2023-2024 and
2024-2025 based on the approval granted by the Pharmacy
Council of India for running D. Pharm courses.
14. Mr. Amit Shrivastava, learned Senior Advocate for
the petitioners further contended that the petitioners-institutions
have already made an application for grant of affiliation from
the University for the Academic Session 2025-2026 but with
Patna High Court CWJC No.11464 of 2024 dt.14-10-2025
10/24
respect to the Academic Session 2023-2024 and 2024-2025,
since the institutions have already got its approval from the
Pharmacy Council of India for running D. Pharm course and the
no objection and affiliation had already been granted by the
State, the institutes in question cannot be subjected to affiliation
again from the University for the previous Academic Sessions.
It is further submitted that the letters issued by the State
Government and the University directing the institutions and
clarifying the position that the affiliation and examination
related work for Para Medical/Para Dental/Pharmacy Diploma
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187693211/ 9
The Aditya Integrated Education And ... vs The State Of Bihar on 14 October, 2025
and Certificate Course and GNM/ANM will be done by the
University is wholly illegal and, in fact, in conflict with the
statute. No notification, much less letter dated 17.02.2023
whereby such clarification is made will prevail over the statute.
In the Act and the Statute, it has been provided that the
college/institution imparting self finance courses will have to
apply in the prescribed proforma before the University and then
only their application will be considered, subject to the
institute/college fulfilling the requisite criteria for being
affiliated. There is no provision in the Act or the Statute with
regard to deemed affiliation with the University w.e.f.
01.04.2023
. Reliance has also been placed on a decision Patna High Court CWJC No.11464 of 2024
dt.14-10-2025 rendered by the Division Bench of this Court in the case of Sri Ganesh Dutt Memorial
College v. The State of Bihar & Ors. [L.P.A. No.1404 of 2018 & another analogous case] that there
cannot be retrospective affiliation. A decision of the co-ordinate Bench has also been placed to
buttress the aforesaid submission rendered in the case of Vijay Shankar Rai v. The State of Bihar &
Ors. [C.W.J.C. No.9940 of 2019].
15. Mr. P.K. Shahi, learned Advocate General along with Mr. Ajay, Senior Advocate for the
University submitted that the Act, 2021 has been duly enacted by the State Legislature of Bihar and
published in the Extraordinary Gazette vide Notification dated 09.08.2021. In pursuant to the Act,
2021 afore-noted, the University has been duly established in consequent to the notification issued
by the Health Department, Government of Bihar vide Memo No.562(1) dated 28.07.2022.
Subsequent thereto, the Health Department, Government of Bihar has issued a Notification vide
Memo No.107(1) dated 17.02.2023, whereby it has been decided that all colleges and institutions
established and operated by the State Government imparting professional education in different
sectors of Health Sciences shall be deemed to be affiliated with effect from the date of enforcement
of the Notification i.e. 01.04.2023 under the Patna High Court CWJC No.11464 of 2024
dt.14-10-2025 provisions of Section 4 of the Act, 2021. A list of such institutions has also been issued
accordingly; however, the petitioner in C.W.J.C. No.11464 of 2024 have failed to submit
NOC/recognition letter and the deficient document(s) despite intimation, the affiliation has not
been granted to the said petitioner-institution. The institutions have also been informed through
letter no.196(1) dated 28.03.2024 issued with the consent of the Law Department, Bihar, that
affiliation and examination related work of Paramedical/Para Dental/Pharmacy Diploma and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187693211/ 10
The Aditya Integrated Education And ... vs The State Of Bihar on 14 October, 2025
Certificate Course and ANM/GNM Course would be done by the University.
16. Mr. Shahi, learned Advocate General taking this Court through the relevant provisions of the Act,
2021 has submitted that Section 4 of the Act, 2021 talks about the jurisdiction of the University and
all the colleges and institutions established by the Government and affiliated to the existing
Universities of the State or to be established in future for imparting Professional Education in
different streams of Health Sciences shall be eligible for affiliation with the University from such
date as the Government may, by notification in the official Gazette appoint, in the manner
prescribed by the Statutes or Ordinances or Regulations made in this regard. Patna High Court
CWJC No.11464 of 2024 dt.14-10-2025
17. Referring to Section 4(3) of the Act, 2021, it is further submitted that after coming into force of
the Act and the notification published in the official Gazette, the colleges or the institutions affiliated
by any other University shall cease to be affiliated from the University to which such Colleges or
Institutions have been affiliated and such Colleges or Institutions shall be deemed to be affiliated to
the University from such date as specified in the said notification. However, this provision shall not
be applicable to deemed University. It is further contended that the powers and functions of the
University has been duly stipulated in Section 6 of the Act, 2021. Section 6(3) clearly says that it is
the University which shall hold examinations and grant, subject to such conditions as the University
may determine, diplomas or certificates and confer degrees or other academic distinctions on the
basis of examinations, evaluations or any other method of testing. In the light of the afore-noted
prescriptions, vide Health Department Notification No.107(1) dated 17.02.2023, it has been decided
that all the self financed professional institutions engaged/established for medical education in
different sectors of health science within the State of Bihar will be deemed to be affiliated with the
University w.e.f. 01.04.2023. Patna High Court CWJC No.11464 of 2024 dt.14-10-2025
18. Mr. Shahi, learned Advocate General further clarified that in the light of the Pharmacy
Regulation, 2020, the Bihar University of Health Sciences, Patna constituted a Pharmacy
Examination Committee vide Notification No.1358 dated 14.10.2024 and has been declared
empowered for conducting examination of pharmacy courses in view of resolution taken by the
Pharmacy Council of India in the meeting of the Executive Committee held on 07.11.2024, the copy
of which is placed on record as Annexure-R/I to the counter affidavit filed on behalf of respondents
no.5 and 6 in C.W.J.C. No.4610 of 2025. In the said meeting, it was decided to approve the Bihar
University of Health Sciences Patna Bihar as Examining Authority in respect of affiliating
institutions applied to Pharmacy Council of India.
19. Having heard the learned Advocate for the respective parties and considering the materials
available on record, the question for consideration as culled out is only to the extent as to whether
the University has the jurisdiction and empowered to grant affiliation to the institutes/colleges
imparting D. Pharm courses and further to conduct examination of Diploma courses and certificate.
20. A statute is an edict of the legislature and the Patna High Court CWJC No.11464 of 2024
dt.14-10-2025 conventional way of interpreting or construing a statute is to seek the "intention" of
its maker. A statute is to be construed according "to the intent of those that make it" and "the duty of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187693211/ 11
The Aditya Integrated Education And ... vs The State Of Bihar on 14 October, 2025
judicature is to act upon the true intention of the Legislature-- the mens or sententia legis [vide The
Vishnu Pratap Sugar Works (P) Limited v. Chief Inspector of Stamps, U.P., AIR, 1968 SC 102,
R.M.D. Chamarbaugwalla v. Union of India, AIR 1957 SC 628, Salmond Jurisprudence 11th
Edition].
21. The correct interpretation is one that based harmonize the words with the object of the statute. It
is a rule now firmly established by the Apex Court since long that intention of the legislature must be
found by reading the statute as a whole. The Courts strongly lean against a construction which
reduces the statute to a futility.
22. Time without number, it has been ruled that statute or any enacting provision therein must be so
construed as to make effective or operative on the principle expressed in the maxim 'uterus images
verdict quam pereat'.
23. In the case of Union of India v. B.S. Aggrawal, [AIR 1998 SC 1537], the Apex Court observed that
the Court leans in favor of an interpretation which conforms to justice and fair play and prevent
potentiality to injustice. When there is a Patna High Court CWJC No.11464 of 2024 dt.14-10-2025
choice of meanings there is a presumption that one which produces an unjust or inconvenient result
was not intended [vide Paradise Printers and Others v. The Union Territory Chandigah and Others,
AIR 1988 SC 352/(1988) 1 SCC 440].
24. A statute must be read as a whole and one provision of the Act should be construed with
reference to other provisions in the same Act so as to make a consistent enactment of the whole
statute. Such a construction has the merit of avoiding any inconsistency or repugnancy either within
a section or between a section and other parts of the statute. It is the duty of the Courts to avoid a
head on clash between two sections of the same Act and, whenever it is possible to do so, to construe
provisions which appear to conflict so that they harmonise. It should not be lightly assumed that
parliament had given with one hand what it took away with the other. The provisions of one section
of a statute cannot be used to defeat those of another unless it is impossible to effect reconciliation
between them (sic) [vide University of Allahabad & Ors. v. Amrit Chand Tripathi & Ors. [AIR 1987
SC 57]; Tahsildar Singh v. State of U.P. [AIR 1959 SC 1012]; Mohammad Sher Khan v. Raja Seth
Swami Dayal [AIR 1922 PC 17].
25. The Pharmacy Council of India established under Patna High Court CWJC No.11464 of 2024
dt.14-10-2025 the Pharmacy Act, 1948 is a statutory body responsible for setting standards of
pharmacy, education, registering pharmacist, prompting professional standards and advising the
Government on matters related to pharmacy profession. The primary purpose of the Act is to make
better provision for regulating the profession and practice pharmacy in India. Thus, it is not in
dispute that to run an institution conducting course of B. Pharm/D. Pharm or any other Higher
Degrees, the approval of the Pharmacy Council of India is necessary along with the consent of
affiliation of Examining Authority and the NOC by the State Government.
26. Now coming to the Act, 2021, the very establishment of the University is to conduct and
facilitate affiliation of institutions set up by the Government and/or trust or the society in the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187693211/ 12
The Aditya Integrated Education And ... vs The State Of Bihar on 14 October, 2025
conventional as well as new frontiers of professional education in Health Sciences for the purposes
of affiliating, teaching and ensuring proper and systematic instruction, training and research in
Modern System of Medicine, AYUSH systems of Medicine, Nursing Education, Pharmacy
Education, Dental Education, Education on Laboratory Technology, Physiotherapy & Occupational
Therapy, Speech Therapy and Education on other Paramedical Courses Patna High Court CWJC
No.11464 of 2024 dt.14-10-2025 and inter disciplinary areas such as Health Economics, Health
administration etc. The object of the Act, 2021 is to promote academic freedom and scholarship for
the teachers as well as for the students and to foster and develop an intellectual climate conducive to
the pursuit of scholarship and excellence, either independently or jointly with other centers of
higher learning.
27. The 'College' as defined under Section 2(x) of the Act, 2021 says that it means an institution
maintained or controlled by the University or maintained by the State Government; and 2(xi) of the
said Section says that 'Courses' means courses leading to a Bachelor or Higher degree in relevant
streams of Health Sciences and such other courses as notified by the Government in future. Further,
the 'Institutions' is defined under Section 2(xix), which means an academic institution or college
admitted to the privileges of the University. Section 4 of the Act deals with the 'Jurisdiction', leaves
no confusion that University shall have the jurisdiction over all the colleges and institutions
established by the Government and affiliated to the existing Universities of the State or to be
established in future imparting Professional Education in different streams of Health Sciences. This
Section further made it clear that after coming into force of the Act, Patna High Court CWJC
No.11464 of 2024 dt.14-10-2025 2021, any other University established by law of the State
Legislature shall cease to be affiliated from the University to which such Colleges or Institutions
have been affiliated and such Colleges or Institutions shall be deemed to be affiliated to the
University from such date as specified in the said notification.
28. Section 4(4) of the Act, 2021 further clarifies that the University may impose such terms and
conditions upon the colleges or institutions as it may consider necessary, conducive or incidental to
the attainment of all or any of the objects of the University and then grant affiliation. Similarly, the
existing college or institution set up by a Trust or a Society as a self- financing institution imparting
Professional Education in different streams of Health Sciences may get affiliated with the University
subject to fulfillment of conditions laid down under Statutes and Regulations made in this regard.
29. Bare perusal of Section 4 of the Act, 2021, it is evident that the Act shall have the control over all
the Colleges/Institutions which are involved in imparting professional education in the different
streams of health sciences.
30. In absence of any affiliation from the University, Patna High Court CWJC No.11464 of 2024
dt.14-10-2025 any privilege, enjoyed from any other University before the appointed day by any
Medical College or institution of Health Sciences situated in this State, shall be deemed to be
withdrawn with effect from such date as may be notified by the Government.
31. The prime objective of the University, inter alia, to create centers and institutes of excellence in
different streams of Health Sciences. The powers and functions of the University has stipulated
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187693211/ 13
The Aditya Integrated Education And ... vs The State Of Bihar on 14 October, 2025
under Section 6 of the Act, 2021, inter alia, empowered to hold examinations and grant, subject to
such conditions as the University may determine, diplomas or certificates and confer degrees or
other academic distinctions on the basis of examinations, evaluations or any other method of testing
and to withdraw any such diplomas, certificates, degrees or other academic distinctions for good
and sufficient cause.
32. Bare reading of the notable prescriptions of the Act, 2021, so far the contention of the learned
Advocate for the petitioners that the definition clauses, especially the term 'Colleges' and the
'Courses' exclude the Diploma courses do not find merit consideration in view of the fact that
Colleges and the Institutions have been defined separately. Section 2(xix) defines 'Institution' which
means an academic institution or a Patna High Court CWJC No.11464 of 2024 dt.14-10-2025 college
admitted to the privileges of the University. Thus the "Institution" embraces within its fold the
institution or a college which may impart teaching courses leading to a Bachelor or Higher Degrees
in Modern System of Medicine in different disciplinary but in no circumstances it ousts the courses
of Diploma once Section 2(xi) which defines 'Courses', inter alia, says that not only courses leading
to a Bachelor or High Degree in relevant stream of Health Sciences but all such other courses as
notified by the Government in future. If the provision of Sections 4 and 6 of the Act, 2021 be read
together, there is no impediment to come to the conclusion that the University shall have the
jurisdiction over all the institutions or colleges imparting professional education in different streams
of Health Sciences and powers to hold and facilitate examination and grant, subject to such
conditions as the University may determine, diplomas or certificates and confer degrees or other
academic distinctions on the basis of examinations, evaluations.
33. It is also notable that the Health Department, Government of Bihar, in the light of the decision
rendered by the Apex Court in the case of The Karnataka State Association of the Management of
Nursing and Allied Health Science Institutions and Ors. v. Indian Nursing Patna High Court CWJC
No.11464 of 2024 dt.14-10-2025 Council and Ors. [Civil Appeal Nos.12759-12671 of 2017] has
affirmed the observation made by the learned Single Judge and held that Indian Nursing Council
has no authority to grant recognition to the institutions imparting nursing courses. The Government
of Bihar has come out with a letter bearing no.196(1) dated 28.03.2024 with the consent of the Law
Department, Bihar, extending intimation to all the concerned that affiliation and examination
related work of Paramedical/Para Dental/Pharmacy Diploma and Certificate Course and
ANM/GNM Course would be done by the University.
34. It is also to be noted that the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Nutan Kumari and Another v.
State of Bihar and Others [SLP (C) No. 9 of 2014], has observed that it is the accepted position that
it is the State Government that has power to grant recognition and that Indian Nursing Council has
no authority to grant such recognition in so far as Auxiliary Nurses-Mid-wife course (ANM)
concerned. The Apex Court has noticed the established position by referring to the judgment of this
Court in Raj A.N.M. School, Muzaffarpur v. The State of Bihar and Others [1993 (2) PLJR 479].
35. The Pharmacy Council of India also in its meeting Patna High Court CWJC No.11464 of 2024
dt.14-10-2025 dated 07.11.2024 accepted the position that the University after coming into its force
through the Act, 2021 is empowered to award degrees as recognized by UGC Notification on

36. In view of the afore-noted discussions and the specific prescriptions under the Act, 2021 and the
statute as also the letters issued by the State and the University, this Court has no hesitation to hold
that Bihar University of Health Sciences, established under the University Act, 2021 is declared to be
an authority to conduct the examination from Session 2023-2024 onward, of all the colleges and
institutions imparting professional education, duly affiliated with the University, including D.

37. Before parting with this case, it must be clarified that on account of pendency of the writ
petition, in no circumstances, any students of the institution shall be subjected to disqualification
for appearing in due course and/or examination, after proper affiliation of their institution with the
University. The authorities are also directed to adhere and maintain the time schedule of the
examination of the courses and its result in terms with the Act and Statute.
38. Accordingly, both the writ petitions having no merit stand dismissed with the afore-noted
observation.
