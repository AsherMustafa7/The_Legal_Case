8. Learned counsel for the applicants submits that, in the above eventuality of the compromise took
place between the parties and the aforementioned compromise verification order, the instant
application may be allowed and the criminal proceeding initiated against the present applicants may
be quashed. It is further submitted that both the parties have buried the hatchet and there is no
grudges between them against each other. To quash the cognizance order as well as criminal
proceeding, learned counsel for the applicant has relied upon the following judgments of the
Hon'ble Apex Court :-
(i) B.S.Joshi & Others Vs. State of Haryana & Others; (2003) 4 SCC 675.
(ii) Nikhil Merchant Vs. Central Bureau of Investigation; (2008) 9 SCC 667.
(iii) Manoj Sharma Vs. State & Others; (2008) 16 SCC 1.
(iv) Gyan Singh Vs. State of Punjab (2012) 10 SCC 303.
(v) Narindra Singh & Others Vs. State of Punjab (2014) 6 SCC 466.
9. In a recent judgment passed by a Three Judges' Bench of the Apex Court in the Case of Parbatbhai
Aahir alias Parbatbhai Bhimsinhbhai Karmur and others Vs. State of Gujarat and another, reported
in AIR 2017 SC 4843, Hon'ble Supreme Court has summarized the ratio of all the cases decided
earlier with respect to quashing of F.I.R./charge-sheet/criminal proceeding on the ground of
settlement between the parties and expounded the ten categories in which application under Section
482 could be entertained for quashing the F.I.R./charge-sheet/criminal proceeding on the basis of
compromise. Para no. 15 of the said judgement summarizing the proposition in this respect is
reproduced below:-
"15. (i) Section 482 preserves the inherent power of the High Court to prevent an
abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. The provision does
not confer new powers. It only recognises and preserves powers which inhere in the
High Court;
(ii) The invocation of the jurisdiction of the High Court to quash a First Information
Report or a criminal proceeding on the ground that a settlement has been arrived at
between the offender and the victim is not the same as the invocation of jurisdiction
for the purpose of compounding an offence. While compounding an offence, the
power of the court is governed by the provisions of Section 320 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973. The power to quash under Section 482 is attracted even if
the offence is non-compoundable.

Smt.Kamlesh Sharma And Another vs State Of U.P. And Another on 2 January, 2025
(iii) In forming an opinion whether a criminal proceeding or compliant should be
quashed in exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 482, the High Court must
evaluate whether the ends of justice would justify the exercise of the inherent power;
(iv) While the inherent power of the High Court has a wide ambit and plenitude it has
to be exercised;(i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent an abuse of the
process of any court;
(v) The decision as to whether a complaint or First Information Report should be
quashed on the ground that the offender and victim have settled the dispute, revolves
ultimately on the facts and circumstances of each case and no exhaustive elaboration
of principles can be formulated;
(vi) In exercise of the power under Section 482 and while dealing with a plea that the
dispute has been settled, the High Court must have due regard to the nature and
gravity of the offence. Heinous and serious offences involving mental depravity or
offences such as murder, rape and dacoity cannot approximately be quashed though
the victim or the family of the victim have settled the dispute. Such offences are, truly
speaking, not private in nature but have a serious impact upon society. The decision
to continue with the trial in such cases is founded on the overriding element of public
interest in punishing persons for serious offences;
(vii) As distinguished from serious offences, there may be criminal cases which have
an overwhelming or predominant element of a civil dispute. They stand on a distinct
footing insofar as the exercise of the inherent power to quash is concerned;
(viii) Criminal cases involving offences which arise from commercial, financial,
mercantile, partnership or similar transactions with an essentially civil flavour may
in appropriate situations fall for quashing where parties have settled the dispute;
(ix) In such a case, the High Court may quash the criminal proceeding if in view of
the compromise between the disputants, the possibility of a conviction is remote and
the continuation of a criminal proceeding would cause oppression and prejudice; and
(x) There is yet an exception to the principle set out in propositions (viii) and (ix)
above. Economic offences involving the financial and economic well-being of the
state have implications which lie beyond the domain of a mere dispute between
private disputants. The High Court would be justified in declining to quash where the
offender is involved in an activity akin to a financial or economic fraud or
misdemeanour. The consequences of the act complained of upon the financial or
economic system will weigh in the balance."
10. Certified copies of order dated 3.7.2024 and order dated 7.8.2024 are filed as Annexure no.6 and
Annexure no.7 respectively.

11. Learned AGA has no objection, in case, the instant application is decided by this Court on the
basis of compromise took place between the parties, which is duly verified by the court concerned.
12. Having considered the aforementioned compromise verification report as well as the
compromise verification order and with the assistance of the aforesaid guidelines, keeping in view
the nature of gravity and severity of the offence, which are more particular in private dispute, it is
deemed proper that in order to meet the ends of justice, the present proceeding should be quashed.
In result, dispute between the parties will put to an end, peace will be resorted and relationship
between them will be smooth. No useful purpose would be served to keep the present matter
pending inasmuch as both the parties have buried the hatchet and as the time passes, it will be
difficult to prove the guilt of the accused. The continuation of criminal proceeding would cause
oppression and prejudice.
13. In view of the aforesaid pronouncements of the Hon'ble Apex Court and in the light of the
compromise arrived at between the parties, which has been duly verified by the concerned court
below, the present application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. is hereby allowed. The entire criminal
proceeding of the aforementioned case is hereby quashed.
14. Let a copy of the order be transmitted to the concerned lower Court for necessary action.
