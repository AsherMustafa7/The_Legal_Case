JUDGMENT
1. The appellant is before this Court challenging the judgment of IX Additional Small Causes and
Additional MACT, Bangalore (SCCH-7) in MVC No.2835/2012 dated 27.01.2015.

Smt Catherine Louis A vs Sri Kengaiah on 11 March, 2020
2. On 09.12.2011, at about 8.15 p.m., the deceased Louis Joseph was riding a Luna slowly and
cautiously on the left side of the road on Ayyappa Swamy Cross Road junction of the Nala Road,
observing all the traffic rules and regulations, at that time, a Canter Lorry bearing Registration
No.CAW-1688 driven by its driver came in a high speed, in a rash and negligent manner without
observing traffic rules and dashed against the Luna from behind, due to which, he fell down and
sustained severe head injuries as also injuries to the whole body. He was immediately shifted to
St.Philomena Hospital, Bangalore, wherein the MFA No.3338 OF 2015 doctor declared him as dead
at 8.50 p.m. The deceased was working at Williams Bakery Private Limited, Bangalore as Kitchen
Helper and claimed to be receiving salary at a sum of Rs.10,000/- p.m., as also he was operating
novelty store in the afternoon and was earning a sum of Rs.6,000/- p.m. there from. The wife of the
deceased who is the appellant herein had approached the Tribunal seeking for compensation on
account of the above accident and the death of her husband resulting there from.
3. The Tribunal having come to the conclusion that though the vehicle and RTC stands in the name
of respondent No.1, taking into consideration the evidence led by respondent Nos.1 and 2 wherein
respondent No.1 had produced documents to establish the transfer/sale of the offending vehicle to
respondent No.2 and having come to the MFA No.3338 OF 2015 conclusion that there are multiple
violation of insurance policy, the offending vehicle not having a permit and not having a fitness
certificate, had imposed the penalty on respondent No.2 - purchaser even though the formal transfer
of registration had not occurred in favour of the respondent No.2. It is on this basis the Tribunal
discharged the liability of the Insurance Company and imposed the same on the de facto owner of
the vehicle viz., respondent No.2 even though de jure owner continued to be respondent No.1. The
Tribunal considering the matter has awarded the compensation of Rs.7,75,100/- along with interest
@ 6% p.a. from the date of petition till the date of payment on the following heads:
Sl. Heads of accounts Rupees (Rs.) No. 1 Loss of dependency 6,25,100 2 Loss of
consortium 1,00,000 3 Funeral expenses 25,000 4 Expenses of transportation of
5,000 MFA No.3338 OF 2015 dead body 5 Loss of love and affection 10,000 6 Loss of
estate 10,000 Total 7,75,100
4. The appellant is before this Court contending that the quantum of compensation which has been
awarded is incorrect. The proper income of the deceased has not been taken into account and as also
contending that the liability ought to have been imposed upon the Insurance Company inasmuch as
the violation by respondent Nos.1 and 2 would not absolve the Insurance Company from its liability
to the appellant, who is a third party.
5. Per contra, learned counsel appearing for the Insurance Company would contend that it is not
known as to who has paid the insurance premium insofar as insurance policy is concerned. He
further submits that the Insurance Company is not MFA No.3338 OF 2015 liable to indemnify the
insured on the following grounds:
i. The insurance policy which has been issued in the name of respondent No.1 - RC
holder is stated to commence from 14.55 hours on 10.12.2011 and being in operation
till 09.12.2012. The accident having occurred at 8.15 p.m., on 09.12.2011, policy had

Smt Catherine Louis A vs Sri Kengaiah on 11 March, 2020
not come into effect and therefore, the Insurance Company is not liable to pay the
compensation under the said policy.
ii. There is a violation of applicable statutory enactment in terms of there being no permit to ply a
goods vehicle. The said permit having expired on 26.11.2008 in terms of Ex.R14/R18, the Insurance
Company cannot be made liable to make payment of compensation.
MFA No.3338 OF 2015 iii. There was no fitness certificate as on the date of the accident. Therefore,
there being violation of statutory provision, the Insurance Company is not liable to make payment of
compensation. iv. Respondent No.1 being RC holder had claimed that he had transferred the vehicle
to respondent No.2. However, the statutory requirement of such transfer not having been followed,
the offending vehicle continued to stand in the name of respondent No.1 and therefore, he submits
that the respondent No.1 ought to have been made liable for the said payment.
v. Respondent No.2 has been served and placed ex-parte before the Tribunal and counsel for
respondent No.1 submits that there is no appeal MFA No.3338 OF 2015 either filed by respondent
No.2 or by Insurance Company.
vi. The Tribunal having held that respondent No.1 is not liable to make payment of any
compensation in the absence of any appeal by the Insurance Company as regards the said finding,
respondent No.1 cannot be held liable.
6. Heard the learned counsel for the appellant and the learned counsel for respondent - Insurance
Company and perused the records.
7. The contention of learned counsel for Insurance Company that the insurance policy came into
effect on 14.55 hours on 10.12.2011 and since the accident having occurred on 09.12.2011 at 08.15
p.m., the policy has not come into operation would have to be considered in the perspective of date
of receipt of premium. It is not in dispute that the MFA No.3338 OF 2015 premium is received in
cash on 09.12.2011 during the working hours of the Insurance Company. The accident having
occurred at 8.15 p.m., on 09.12.2011, it is clear that insurance premium was received prior to the
accident. It is rather unfortunate that the accident occurred immediately thereafter but once a
person pays the premium and avails of a insurance policy, the said person would be under the
impression that the policy comes into effect immediately since the payment has been accepted by
the Insurance Company. There is no evidence on record to indicate that the person collecting the
premium on behalf of the insurance company had informed the person availing of the insurance
policy, that the policy would not come into operation until particular date nor was there any request
or instructions issued by the person collecting the premium that the vehicle MFA No.3338 OF 2015
should not be plied until that date. In the absence thereof, I am of the considered opinion that the
Insurance Company cannot evade its liability by contending that though the premium was received
prior to the accident, the policy prescribes a different date from which the coverage comes into
operation. This aspect is no longer res integra. The Division Bench of this Court in the case of
National Insurance Company Limited vs. Smt.Bhadramma and others reported in ILR 2009 KAR
3332 has held that in terms of Section 64-VB that the risk of the Insurance Company would
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/176457917/ 4
Smt Catherine Louis A vs Sri Kengaiah on 11 March, 2020
commence from the time of receipt of premium. Hence, the first contention of the Insurance
Company cannot be accepted since the premium having been collected prior to the occurrence of the
accident.
MFA No.3338 OF 2015
8. The second contention of learned counsel for Insurance Company that there was no permit to ply
a goods vehicle and the permit had lapsed in the year 2008 in terms of Ex.R14/18 and in view of the
said violations, the liability has to be imposed on the RC holder cannot also be accepted for the
reason that the premium was collected on 09.12.2011 and the policy was issued stating that it would
come into operation from 10.12.2011. The said policy is not a renewal policy but a fresh policy or a
break policy. At the time of issuance of policy, it is to be verified by the Insurance Company about
the existence of a permit or not. The Insurance Company cannot merely collect premium and later
contend that even at the time of issuance of policy, there was no permit in existence. There being no
enquiry made by the Insurance Company as regards the vehicle and MFA No.3338 OF 2015
documents relating thereto, the Insurance Company cannot at a later point of time take advantage
of its own wrongs and contend that even before issuance of the policy, there was a violation
committed by the insurer prior to issuance of the policy.
9. The third contention that there was no fitness certificate even as on the date of insurance would
also suffer from the same lacuna as detailed above relating to lack of valid permit as on the date of
issuance of the policy.
10. The fourth contention that respondent No.1 continues to be the RC holder as also the policy
stood in the name of respondent No.1. The Tribunal ought to have imposed liability on respondent
No.1 rather than on respondent No.2 is also of no avail. Once the insurance policy has MFA No.3338
OF 2015 been issued, though the indemnity may be on account of the insured; the person being
indemnified is a third party, victim of the accident. What is of relevance is whether the insurance
premium has been received by the Insurance Company or not. It would not a matter as to whether
the payment has been made by respondent No.1 or respondent No.2. That is an interse dispute
between respondent No.1 and respondent No.2. Be that as it may, there is no appeal filed by the
Insurance Company challenging this finding. Hence, this Court is not required to give finding on
this aspect.
11. The concern of learned counsel for respondent that if principle of pay and recover is applied and
the Insurance Company is directed to make payment of compensation and recover from the owner,
the Insurance Company would be put to difficulty as to MFA No.3338 OF 2015 from whom the same
has to be recovered whether from respondent No.1 or respondent No.2 would necessarily have to be
answered by this Court and the same is answered as under:
a. Respondent No.1 has produced documents to establish the transfer of vehicle in
favour of respondent No.2. The Tribunal has come to the conclusion that respondent
No.2 is the owner of the vehicle and on that basis, has imposed the liability on
respondent No.2. Respondent No.2 has not challenged the said finding by filing an
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/176457917/ 5
Smt Catherine Louis A vs Sri Kengaiah on 11 March, 2020
appeal.
b. When the vehicle was seized by jurisdictional police, it is the respondent No.2 who
had approached the jurisdictional Magistrate by filing an application under Section
454 for release of vehicle claiming to be the owner of the vehicle which was accepted
by the MFA No.3338 OF 2015 Magistrate and the vehicle was released and handed
over to the custody of respondent No.2. Hence, respondent No.2 now cannot seek to
evade his liability. Thus, the Insurance Company can proceed against respondent
No.2 to recover the amounts awarded both in terms of order of the Tribunal as also
the order of this Court.
12. The appellant has also sought for enhancement of compensation contending that the Tribunal
has taken into account a sum of Rs.4,293/- by referring to net salary in terms of Ex.P13. A perusal of
the said Ex.P13 indicates gross salary of the deceased was Rs.5,117/- per month. Net salary is taken
into consideration after certain deduction towards old loan and new loan. Therefore, calculation
made by the Tribunal in this regard is not correct. The Tribunal ought to have MFA No.3338 OF
2015 taken a salary at Rs.5,117/- p.m. Though the appellant has contended that he was working for
half a day in Bakery and in the afternoon, he was running a novelty store, Ex.P13 indicates that
deceased was working full day in the bakery and it indicates the salary for entire day. Hence, there is
no further amount which could be taken into consideration except for holding that gross salary
ought to have been taken into consideration.
13. The deceased being 45 years at the time of his death, future prospects would have to be taken at
30%. Hence, 30% of Rs.5117/- comes to Rs.1,535/- and as such, an amount of Rs.6,652/- would have
to be taken as his income.
14. Considering number of dependents 1/3rd of income of the deceased has to be deducted towards
his personal expenses which comes to Rs.2,195/-.
MFA No.3338 OF 2015 Thus, leaving a balance of Rs.4,434/-. The applicable multiplier being '14', as
per Sarala Verma vs. Delhi Transport Corporation reported in AIR 2009 SC 3104, loss of
dependency would be Rs.4,434 x 12 x 14 = Rs.7,44,912/-
15. The Tribunal having awarded compensation of Rs.6,25,100/-, the same is enhanced by a sum of
Rs.1,19,812/-.
16. The compensation awarded on other heads being just and proper, the same are unaltered.
Accordingly, I pass the following:
