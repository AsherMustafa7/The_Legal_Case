Mrs. Moichingmayum Ongbi Epham Yasmine vs The State Of Manipur on 1 February, 2023
[1] By way of this writ petition, the petitioner assails the order dated 13.09.2022 of
the Special Secretary (Home), Government of Manipur, whereby she W.P. (Crl) No.
55 of 2022 Page 1 was subjected to preventive detention in exercise of power under
Section 3(1) of the Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic
Substances Act, 1988. She seeks a consequential writ of habeas corpus to set her at
liberty forthwith.
[2] Heard Mr. K. Modhusudon, learned counsel for the petitioner; Mr. Athouba Khaidem, learned
Government Advocate, for respondents No. 1 & 3; and Mr. S. Samarjeet, learned Sr. PCCG,
appearing for respondent No. 2. [3] The primary ground of attack urged by Mr. K. Modhusudon,
learned counsel, is the unexplained delay in the disposal of the petitioner's representation against
her detention. Her representation was dated 13.10.2022. It was rejected by the State Government on
03.11.2022 and by the Central Government on 20.01.2023.
[4] The affidavit-in-opposition filed by the Deputy Secretary (Home), Government of Manipur,
reflects that the said representation was forwarded to the Home department by the Inspector
General of Prisons, Manipur, on 14.10.2022 and it was then forwarded to the Central Government
on 19.10.2022. The delay in such forwarding was sought to be explained by stating that there was a
high volume of PIT-ND&PS cases and other time-bound cases that were being dealt with by the
Home Department. It was pointed out that 15.10.2022 and 16.10.2022 were holidays, being the
weekend. The Deputy Secretary further stated that the Home Department called for para-wise
comments from the Police Department under letter dated 19.10.2022 and, thereafter, upon
consideration of the material on record, the representation was rejected on 03.11.2022. The delay in
disposal of the representation and forwarding the report was stated to be due to the high volume of
proposals received and other routine works of the Department.
W.P. (Crl) No. 55 of 2022 Page 2
[5] Mr. Athouba Khaidem, learned Government Advocate, produced the
file of the detaining authority. Perusal thereof reflects that the Superintendent, Manipur Central
Jail, Imphal, forwarded the petitioner's representation to the Inspector General of Prisons, Manipur,
on 13.10.2022 itself and it was also received on the very same day. In turn, the Inspector General of
Prisons, Manipur, forwarded the representation to the Special Secretary (Home), Government of
Manipur, under letter dated 14.10.2022 and it was received on the very same day. However, the
Deputy Secretary (Home), Government of Manipur, addressed a letter to the Director General of
Police, Manipur, seeking para-wise comments on the said representation only on 19.10.2022. The
representation was also forwarded to the Central Government on the said day. The Superintendent
of Police, Thoubal, submitted para-wise comments to the Home Department under letter dated
21.10.2022. The Note-file reflects that an entry was made therein only on 31.10.2022, referring to
the para-wise comments received under letter dated 21.10.2022. In effect, there was no application
of mind to the matter and the para- wise comments furnished by the police for a full ten days. It was
only on 02.11.2022 that an endorsement was made in the Note-fie that the representation may be
rejected, basing on the recommendation by the Police Department. This led to the actual rejection
order being passed on 03.11.2022.

Mrs. Moichingmayum Ongbi Epham Yasmine vs The State Of Manipur on 1 February, 2023
[6] Though the Central Government did not file a separate reply, Mr. S. Samarjeet, learned Sr.
PCCG, placed before this Court a copy of the e-mail instructions received by him from the PITNDPS
Division, Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue, Government of India. Perusal thereof
reflects that the representation of the petitioner was kept in abeyance in terms of the judgment of
the Supreme Court in Ankit Ashok Jalan Vs. Union of India and others {(2020) 16 SCC 127},
awaiting the report of the Advisory Board. Thereafter, W.P. (Crl) No. 55 of 2022 Page 3 upon receipt
of the comments from the State Government on 02.11.2022 and the confirmation order on
10.01.2023, the petitioner's representation was stated to have been examined by the
competent/appropriate authority, viz., the Secretary (Revenue), Government of India, and it was
rejected on 20.01.2023. In this regard, it may be noted that the aforestated judgment of the
Supreme Court did not arise under the provisions of the Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic
Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1988, and had no application to consideration of a
representation made by a detenu under this enactment. In any event, the aforestated facts disclose
that there was delay at every stage, be it at the level of the State Government or at the level of the
Central Government. [7] Trite to state, the liberty of an individual is at stake when he is subjected to
preventive detention and the Constitutional scheme guarantees him the right to have his
representation considered without delay, as he is deprived of his personal freedom without
following the ordinary procedures laid down by law. When a concerted and dedicated effort is
launched by the State Government to arrest the menace of illicit drug-trafficking in the State of
Manipur, leading to a plethora of preventive detention orders being issued, it is not open to the
Home Department to put forth the volume of work generated in that regard as an excuse to explain
the delay on its part in dealing with a detenu's representation. Having created the volume of work by
its own actions, the State Government must necessarily equip itself with sufficient personnel and
infrastructure to ensure that there are no delays or shortcomings in the processing of the files in
relation to such detention orders.
[8] Be it noted that in Rajammal vs. State of T.N. and another [(1999) 1 SCC 417], the Supreme
Court observed that if delay is caused in consideration of the detenu's representation owing to
indifference or any other W.P. (Crl) No. 55 of 2022 Page 4 lapse, such delay would adversely affect
further detention of the prisoner. According to the Supreme Court, it is for the authority concerned
to explain the delay, if any, in disposing of the representation and it is not enough to say that the
delay is very short, as even longer delay can as well be explained and so, the test is not the duration
or range of delay, but how it is explained by the authority concerned. The unexplained delay in that
case was a mere 5 days. [9] Earlier, in Professor Khaidem Ibocha Singh vs. The State of Manipur
[AIR 1972 Supreme Court 438], the Supreme Court set aside an order of detention on the ground
that there was unexplained delay of 17 days in the passing of an order on the representation made by
the detenu. [10] More recently, in Sarabjeet Singh Mokha vs. The District Magistrate, Jabalpur, and
others [(Criminal Appeal No. 1301 of 2021, decided on 29.10.2021 = 2021 SCC OnLine SC 1019], the
Supreme Court held that by delaying a decision on such representation, the State Government
denied the detenu a valuable statutory right. The Supreme Court observed that the delay by the State
Government in disposing of such representation strikes at the heart of the procedural rights and
guarantees granted to a detenu. [11] Though it is laudable that the Government of Manipur is
waging a 'war on drugs' and initiating stringent measures to arrest the menace of illicit drug
manufacture, trafficking and marketing in and through the State of Manipur, it is equally its

Mrs. Moichingmayum Ongbi Epham Yasmine vs The State Of Manipur on 1 February, 2023
responsibility to ensure that procedural safeguards are taken note of strictly so as to protect the
Constitutional and statutory rights of persons detained under preventive detention laws. Despite
this Court stating to this effect time and again, scant regard is shown by the authorities concerned to
compliance with the prescribed norms.
W.P. (Crl) No. 55 of 2022 Page 5
[12] The unexplained inaction on the part of the State authorities in
dealing with the detenu's representation dated 13.10.2022 clearly indicates a lackadaisical and
casual approach on their part, which is inimical to the mandatory legal requirements in a matter of
this nature. The same would also be fatal to the very validity and continuance of the impugned
detention order. [13] The order of detention dated 13.09.2022 issued by the Special Secretary
(Home), Government of Manipur, is accordingly set aside. All consequential proceedings based
thereon shall also stand set aside. The petitioner, Moichingmayum Ongbi Epham Yasmine @
Kebisana, presently incarcerated in Manipur Central Jail, Imphal, shall be set at liberty forthwith
unless her continued incarceration is validly required in connection with any other case.
WP (Cril.) No. 55 of 2022 is accordingly allowed.
In the circumstances, there shall be no order as to costs.
A copy of this order shall be sent to the Chief Secretary, Government of Manipur, for information
and necessary further action in the context of educating the detaining authorities in the State of
Manipur as to what are the procedural norms that they need to adhere to while exercising power
and jurisdiction under preventive detention laws.
