2 WP-813-2019 respondent No.1 to 3 be directed to lodge FIR against the respondent No.4 to 7 for
taking possession of the vehicle by force or without following due procedure of law.
Issue any other suitable writ, order or direction as this Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper
under the fact and circumstances existing the present case.
Award the cost of this writ petition in favour of the petitioner throughout. So far as relief sought by
the petitioner of registration of offence against the private respondents is concerned, the same
stands rejected with the observation that the petitioner is free to avail the remedy available
u/S.154(3), 156(3), 190 or 200 of Cr.P.C.
This Court on various occasions has declined prayer for registration of cognizable offences in view of
availability of alternative statutory remedy u/S.156(3), 154(3), 190 or 200 Cr.P.C.This view finds
support in the decision of Apex Court in Aleque Padamsee and Others Vs. Union of India and Ors.
reported in (2007) 6 SCC 171. The relevant portion of said decision is reproduced below for ready
reference and convenience :
"7. Whenever any information is received by the police about the alleged commission
of offence which is cognizable one there is a duty to register the FIR. There can be no
dispute on that score. The only question is whether a writ can be issued to the police
authorities to register the same. The basic question is as to what course is to be
adopted if the police does not do it. As was held in All India Institute of Medical
Sciences Employees' Union (Regd.) Vs. Union of India, (1996) 11 SCC 582 and
reiterated in Gangadhar's case (supra) the remedy available is as set out above by
filing a complaint before the Magistrate. Though it was faintly suggested that there
was conflict in the views in All India Institute of Medical Sciences's case (supra),
Gangadhar Janardan Mhatre Vs. State of Maharashtra, (2004) 7 SCC 768, Hari Singh
Vs. State of U.P. (2006) 5 SCC 733, Minu Kumari Vs. State of Bihar, (2006) 5 SCC
733, and Ramesh Kumar Vs. ( NCT of Delhi) (2006) 2 SCC 677, we find that the view
expressed in
3 WP-813-2019 Ramesh Kumari's case (supra) related to the action required to be taken by the
police when any cognizable offence is brought to its notice. In Ramesh Kumari's case (supra) the
basic issue did not relate to the methodology to be adopted which was expressly dealt with in All
India Institute of Medical Sciences's case (supra), Gangadhar's case (supra), Minu Kumari's case
(supra) and Hari Singh's case (supra). The view expressed in Ramesh Kumari's case (supra) was re-
iterated in Lallan Chaudhary and Ors. V. State of Bihar (AIR 2006 SC 3376). The course available,
when the police does not carry out the statutory requirements under Section 154 was directly in
issue in All India Institute of Medical Sciences's case (supra), Gangadhar's case (supra), Hari Singh's
case (supra) and Minu Kumari's case (supra). The correct position in law, therefore, is that the
police officials ought to register the FIR whenever facts brought to its notice show that cognizable
offence has been made out. In case the police officials fail to do so, the modalities to be adopted are
as set out in Sections 190 read with Section 200 of the Code. It appears that in the present case
initially the case was tagged by order dated 24.2.2003 with WP(C) 530/2002 and WP(C) 221/2002.

Subsequently, these writ petitions were delinked from the aforesaid writ petitions.
8. The writ petitions are finally disposed of with the following directions:
(1) If any person is aggrieved by the inaction of the police officials in registering the
FIR, the modalities contained in Section 190 read with Section 200 of the Code are to
be adopted and observed.
(2) It is open to any person aggrieved by the inaction of the police officials to adopt
the remedy in terms of the aforesaid provisions.
(3) So far as non-grant of sanction aspect is concerned, it is for the concerned
government to deal with the prayer. The concerned government would do well to deal
with the matter within three months from the date of receipt of this order.
(4) We make it clear that we have not expressed any opinion on the merits of the
case."
4 WP-813-2019 However, as regards the other grievance of the petitioner that the vehicle Tata Truck
bearing Registration No.MP09-HH-6668 having been forcefully taken away by the functionaries of
the company which financed the purchase of the said vehicle, this Court deems it appropriate to
entertain this petition.
on payment of PF within three working days, failing which the present petition shall stands
dismissed without further reference to this Court.
Since it is submitted that the vehicle has been seized by respondent No.6 and is kept idle since the
last five months, this Court deems it appropriate to list the matter in the week commencing 11th of
Feb, 2019 for hearing on admission and IR."
Thus, it is clear that the relief sought against the respondents No. 4 to 7 for registration of FIR has
already been rejected. So far as the relief seeking direction to the respondents No. 4 to 7 to release
the vehicle after taking two installments from the petitioner is concerned, admittedly the
respondents No. 4 to 7 are private persons and they are not the State within the meaning of Article
12 of the Constitution of India.
The Supreme Court in the cases of Federal Bank Limited Vs. Sagar Thomas and others reported in
(2003) 10 SCC 733 and R.K. Timber and another Vs. ICICI Bank Ltd. and another reported in 2011
(4) MPLJ 73, has held that the petition is not maintainable against private persons.
Accordingly, this Court is of the considered opinion that after the dismissal of the relief for
registration of offence against the respondents No. 4 to 7, this petition cannot be said to be
maintainable 5 WP-813-2019 against the respondents No. 4 to 7 as they are not the State within the
meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India.
