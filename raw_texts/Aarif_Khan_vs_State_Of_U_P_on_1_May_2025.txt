Cr.P.C. against the applicant and 6 other persons. The allegations in the matter are that on
28.5.2023 Mohammad Kaif the only son of the informant took a train with her from Gondia,
Maharashtra and reached Rewa on 29.5.2023 and then took a train from Rewa for Prayagraj and
reached her village in the evening. The people had come to see her son for marriage which was fixed
with a girl of the village which was to be solemnized on 29.6.2023 on the day of Bakrid. On
29.5.2023 when she reached her house at about 01.00 p.m. with her son then after sometime Aarif
came to her house and took her son with him by stating that his mother and relatives are calling, on
which her son went with him. After sometimes a lady of neighbourhood came to the informant and
told her that her son has become unwell and then the informant ran to see him and found him to be
ill, on which she asked him as to what has happened and her son told her that Aarif and his family
members forcibly gave him cold drink mixed with poison and made him to drink and he is feeling
hot and then he became unconscious and while taking him to the hospital he died on the way. The
accused persons with an intention to murder him, have given him poison mixed in cold drink. She
gave an application at the police station but the village Pradhan told her that he would look into the
matter and tore the said application. On objection by the informant he told her that the same is not
properly written. The village Pradhan in conspiracy of the accused changed the application on which
she affixed her thumb impression and her case was not registered. She then on 31.7.2023 gave an
application to the Commissioner of Police, Prayagraj through registered post but no action was
taken. She then moved the said application under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C.
6. Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that the applicant has been falsely implicated in the
present case. It is submitted that initially on 30.5.2023 the first informant gave an application at
Police Station Sarai Inayat, District Prayagraj stating therein that her son Mohammad Kaif has died
due to excessive consumption of intoxicant. The said information was registered in G.D. No. 17,
10:03 hours on 30.5.2023 at Police Station- Sarai Inayat, District Prayagraj. It is submitted that the
post mortem examination report of the deceased was conducted in which the doctor did not find any
external injury all over his body and cause of death could not be ascertained and viscera was
preserved which after analysis was found to contain "Organochloro Insecticide". It is submitted that
subsequently after 02 months and 16 days an application dated 16.8.2023 was moved by the first
informant before the court concerned on the basis of which the present F.I.R. has been lodged. It is
submitted that moving of the application by the applicant under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. is an
afterthought just in order to falsely implicate and harass the applicant. It is submitted that in the
first application dated 30.5.2023 given by the first informant, the applicant is not named and the
death of the deceased is stated to be due to consumption of excessive intoxicant. It is submitted that
charge sheet in the matter has been submitted by the police against the applicant only under
Sections 328, 302 I.P.C. on 27.1.2025 whereas the other accused persons namely Shera@Shamsher,
Talim, Pottar, Momina and Vijay Kumar Singh have been exonerated, para-28 of the affidavit has
been placed before the Court for the same. It is submitted that the applicant has criminal history of
two cases which have been disclosed and explained in para-4 to the supplementary affidavit dated
16.3.2025. The applicant is in jail since 13.11.2024.
7. Per contra, learned State counsel opposed the prayer for bail.
