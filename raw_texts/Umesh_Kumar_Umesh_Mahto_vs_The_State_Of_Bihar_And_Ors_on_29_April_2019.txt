For the Petitioner/s : Mr.Sunil Kumar Pandey, Advocate
For the Respondent/s : Mr.Vivek Prasad- GP7
======================================================
CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE JYOTI SARAN
and
HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE ANJANI KUMAR SHARAN
ORAL JUDGMENT
(Per: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE JYOTI SARAN) Date : 29-04-2019 In each of the two cases the
vehicles were seized because they were loaded with Mahua flowers in different quantities and FIR
has been instituted under the provisions of the Indian Penal Code as well as the Bihar Prohibition
and Excise Act, 2016 for alleged recovery of Mahua flowers.
In CWJC No. 23163 of 2018, a counter affidavit has been filed today on behalf of the State informing
that confiscation case has been initiated though Mr. Shailesh Kumar, learned counsel representing
the petitioner submits on instruction that no notice has been issued.
Be that as it may, the issue which engages this Court to seek response from the respondents is
whether Mahua flowers on its own are capable of being seized leading to initiation of confiscation
case by taking recourse to the provisions of the Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016 bearing in
mind that while Patna High Court CWJC No.23163 of 2018 dt.29-04-2019 provision of Section 56 of
the Act which lists the things for confiscation does not include Mahua flower, Section 2(16) of the
Act includes Mahua within the ambit of country liquor or traditional liquor only when it is converted
into plain or spicy spirit. There is although an impediment for the petitioner in the Bihar Excise
(Mahua Flowers) Rules, 2006 which does not permit any person to possess more than 5 kgs. Mahua
and in so far as the present set of cases are concerned, the petitioners were found in possession of
Mahua flowers exceeding the limit, i.e. 5 kgs. but according to Mr. Shailesh Kumar, learned counsel
for the petitioner, the Mahua Flower Rules, 2006 does not conceive of seizure or initiation of
confiscation proceeding on alleged violation, no consequences either, have been spelt out in the Act
for alleged violation of its provision. According to learned cousnel, until such time that these flowers
are converted into spirit, the persons concerned cannot be subjected to prosecution or confiscation
proceeding.
Let the counter affidavit filed in CWJC No. 23163 of 2018 be kept on record but since the same does
not address the issue raised, we allow Mr. Kumar Manish, SC 5 and Mr. Vivek Prasad, GP 7,
appearing in the respective cases, to file counter affidavit while dealing with the issues that have
been taken note Patna High Court CWJC No.23163 of 2018 dt.29-04-2019 hereinabove and bearing
in mind the stipulations in the Act and the Rules.
We keep the larger issue open for discussion but for the present and by way of interim relief, we
direct for the release of the vehicles in question i.e. (1) Bolero Pickup Van bearing Registration No.
