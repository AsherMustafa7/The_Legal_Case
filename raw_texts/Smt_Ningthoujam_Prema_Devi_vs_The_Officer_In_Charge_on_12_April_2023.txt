Smt. Ningthoujam Prema Devi vs The Officer-In-Charge on 12 April, 2023
[4.1] Vide order dated 20.12.2019, the petitioner was protected under interim order and the same
order has been extended from time to time. The contents of the present petition are almost similar
to the contents of the AB No. 30 of 2022 and the same are not reproduced. It is stated that the
present dispute arising out of the civil dispute and the complainant/respondent No. 5 herein in
connivance with the police is harassing the petitioner. It is stated that the petitioner herein also
lodged a complaint dated 05.12.2019 to the Officer-in-Charge, Thoubal Police Station against the
respondent No. 5 with respect to the cheating, impersonation and fabrication of her signature with
respect to the sale deed but no action was taken. There are pending revenue cases in respect of the
disputed property.
[4.2] The State respondents filed objection to the bail application. It is stated that the Revenue
Officers were granted anticipatory bail by the learned Sessions Judge, Thoubal vide orders dated
20.12.2019 and 02.01.2020. It is stated that ASO Thoubal passed an order in Mut.Case No. 9/AS &
SO/TBL/2014 dated 02.04.2014 and Mut.Case No. 553 of 2015 dated 07.04.2015 without examining
any sale deed. It is stated that there is prima facie materials against the petitioners in the case. It is
prayed that, the bail may be rejected. The respondent No. 5 (complainant) also filed Page 13
objection. The petitioner along with officials are accused of forging the signature of the complainant
and fabricating the record of right manufacturing illegal documents. It is prayed that the bail may be
rejected. [5] Heard Mr. N. Jotendro, learned senior counsel assisted by Mr. Murtaza Ahmed, learned
counsel for the petitioner, Mr. Y. Ashang, learned PP for the State respondents, Mr. L. Diko, learned
counsel for the private respondent No. 2 in AB No. 47 of 2022 and Mr. Ph. Sanajaoba, learned
counsel for the respondent No. 5 (complainant) in AB No. 84 of 2019. [6] Mr. N. Jotendro, learned
senior counsel for the petitioner, submits that the present case is purely civil dispute between the
parties and there are litigations in the Civil as well as the Revenue Courts. 2 (two) FIRs No.
9(11)2021 VGL. PS U/Ss 120-B r/w 420IPC & 13(2) r/w 13(1)(d) of PC Act 1988 and 115(12)2019
TBL PS U/S 193/205/209/468/420/120-B, IPC are basically arising out of the same allegation, one
addressed to the OC, Thoubal PS by Shri S. Kunjabihari Singh and other addressed to the Chief
Minister, Manipur submitted to the Chief Minister, Manipur in 'Meeyamgi Numit'. Then, the third
FIR being FIR No. 127(7)2022 TBL PS U/S. 447/307/34 IPC is arising out of the trespass and
attempt to murder.
In FIR No. 115(12)2019 TBL PS U/S 193/205/209/468/420/120-B, IPC, the Revenue Officers were
granted absolute anticipatory bail by the Ld. Sessions Judge, Thoubal by separate orders. Perhaps
the bail orders were not challenged and attained finality.
Mr. N. Jotendro, learned senior counsel, prays that the private accused, i.e., petitioners in this set of
applications herein, are also entitled Page 14 to the same benefit and parity along with officials of
the Revenue Department. He further submits that except for the bald allegation, there is no material
to attract the offences under Section 307 IPC in absence of any injury report or other relevant
materials. He further submits that the present cases are filed by the complainant in connivance with
the police to harass the petitioner in civil dispute between them. Learned senior counsel has pointed
out to the fact that the complaints lodged by the petitioner against Shri S. Kunjabihari Singh have
not been taken up by the police for the reason best known to them. He prays that the case of
allegation and fabrication of document and cheating can be investigated while the petitioners are on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5901875/ 7
Smt. Ningthoujam Prema Devi vs The Officer-In-Charge on 12 April, 2023
bail as done with the case of the official accused. He prays that the interim bail may be made
absolute with such condition as imposed by this Court and the petitioner will abide by all such
conditions. [7] Mr. Y. Ashang, learned PP for the State respondent, submits that the petitioners are
alleged to have committed serious offences including an attempt to murder and their interim bail
was rejected by the Ld. Sessions Judge, Thoubal due to their non-corporation. He prays that the bail
application may be rejected.
[8] Mr. L.Diko, learned counsel for the respondent No. 2 (complainant) namely S. Kunjabihari
Singh in AB No. 47 of 2022 states that the complaint filed by the petitioner herein against the
complainant is for forgery and the same photographs with the complainant holding license gun in
2022 was already filed in criminal case before the Ld. CJM, Thoubal Page 15 in 2020. The
petitioners have not come to this Court with clean hand and hence, their application may be
rejected.
[9] Mr. Ph. Sanajaoba, learned counsel for the respondent No. 5/ complainant (S. Kunjabihari
Singh) in AB No. 84 of 2019, submits that the whole allegation of the complainant is established by a
report dated 24.09.2021 submitted by the AS & SO-VII TBL to the Director Settlement and Land
Revenue, Manipur stating that the complainant name was cancelled from the land record by the
revenue officials and private accused by fabricating documents. He prays that the bail application
may be rejected.
[10] Considered the rival submission of the learned counsel for the parties, perused the documents
on record and the provisions of law in the regard.
[11] It is seen that the present cases are arising out of property dispute between the complainant and
the petitioners. The allegation is that the complainant name has been deleted from the land record
by the petitioners in connivance with the revenue officers stealthily. [12] Last FIR being FIR No.
127(7)2022 TBL PS U/S. 447/307/34 IPC is the outcome of the property dispute where there is
allegation of trespassing and attempt to murder. While the complaint lodged by the complainant has
been registered after 3 months, the complaint lodged by the petitioners against the complainant
were never taken up by the police. [13] Materials attracting Section 307 IPC are lacking in the
present case.
Page 16 [14] This Court is of the opinion that investigation can be conducted without taking the
petitioner into custodial interrogation. Moreover, the Revenue Officers have already been granted
anticipatory bail by the various orders of the Ld. Sessions Judge, Thoubal. In view of the above
obsevations, the bail applications are allowed. In case of arrest the petitioners be released on bail
with PR bond of each Rs. 50,000/- and with a surety of each like amount to the satisfaction of the
arresting officer in each of the FIRs i.e. (1) FIR Nos. 9(11)2021 VGL. PS U/Ss 120-B r/w 420IPC &
