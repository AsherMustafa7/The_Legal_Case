Vasant Pawse vs C.B.I. on 19 March, 2019
Learned ASJ for the respondent/CBI has opposed the application for suspension of sentence and
grant of bail to the appellant.
After hearing rival submissions of learned counsel for the parties, looking to the facts and
circumstances of the case and looking to the fact that the learned trial Court has held in para-131 of
its judgement that the prosecution has already admitted on 12.04.2012 that in the FIR there is
outstanding balance in respect of account which is assumed to be zero and it is also mentioned in
that para that as per t h e record, the amount of Rs.5,50,000/- was almost recovered and it is
directed to the J.M. Finance Company for recovery of the rest amount, but without expressing any
opinion on the merits of the case, I am of the considered opinion that it would be appropriate to
suspend the custodial sentence awarded to the appellant and grant bail to him. Consequently, I.A.
No.5003/2019 is allowed subject to deposit of fine amount, if already not deposited. The custodial
sentence awarded to the appellant shall remain suspended during the pendency of this appeal.
Appellant Vasant Pawse be released from custody subject to his furnishing a personal bond in the
sum of Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand) with one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction
of the trial Court. He shall appear and mark his presence before the Registry of this 3
CRA-2391-2019 Court on 26.07.2019 and shall continue to do so on all such future dates as may be
given in this behalf, during pendency of the matter.
Record of the Court below be called for.
List the matter immediately after receipt of the record. Certified copy as per rules.
