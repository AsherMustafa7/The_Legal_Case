ORAL JUDGMENT
Date : 15-10-2025
1. The present Writ petition is filed for issuance of appropriate writ/writs, order/orders &
direction/directions to the respondent authorities to consider the name of the petitioner for
allotment of PDS Shop under General Category in Mirpur Panchayat, Within Goh Block, in the
District of Aurangabad, as the petitioner is the only candidate under General category, eligible for
selection of PDS Patna High Court CWJC No.12434 of 2019 dt.15-10-2025 Shop reserved for general
category, who is having requisite qualification for allotment of the PDS Shop & whose candidature
was removed by adding the names of two candidates who had applied for allotment of PDS shop
reserved for Backward category & as such consideration of their names for allotment of PDS shop
reserved for general category is arbitrary & wrong. And also for necessary relief/reliefs,
order/orders, direction/directions for which the petitioner will be entitled in the law as well as in the
facts of the case.
2. At this juncture, the Learned counsel for the respondents contended that Section 32(iii) of the
Bihar Targeted Public Distribution System (Control) Order, 2016 provides for the provision of
appeal and Section 32(vi) of the Bihar Targeted Public Distribution System (Control) Order, 2016
provides for the provision of revision. Section 32(iii) 32(v) and 32(vi) read as follows:

"32 (iii). Any person aggrieved by an order of the licensing authority denying the
issue or renewal of the Patna High Court CWJC No.12434 of 2019 dt.15-10-2025
license to the fair price shop owner or cancellation of the license may appeal to the
District Officer within thirty days of the date of receipt of the order and the District
Magistrate shall, as far as practicable, dispose the appeal within a period of sixty
days."
32. (v) Till the disposal of appeal pending, the Appellate Authority may direct that the order under
appeal shall not take effect for such period as the authority may consider necessary for giving a
reasonable opportunity to the other party under sub-clause (4) or until the appeal is disposed of,
whichever is earlier.
(vi) Due to non disposal of the appeal within sixty days by the District Officer or against the order
passed in the appeal, a revision may be filed before the Divisional Commissioner. The revision shall
be disposed of within two months.
3. Admittedly, from the reliefs prayed for in the writ petition, it is evident that the petitioner has an
alternative remedy under the provisions of Bihar Patna High Court CWJC No.12434 of 2019
dt.15-10-2025 Targeted Public Distribution System (Control) Order, 2016.
4. The remedy available under the Act is to prefer an appeal before the District Magistrate. As the
District Magistrate is the head of the Selection Committee he cannot review his orders in an appeal.
Therefore, the petitioner is directed to file a complaint/application before the Divisional
Commissioner.
5. The Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that he intends to file a complaint/application
before the concerned authority, but the limitation period for filing the same has lapsed. He prayed
for a direction to the concerned authority to entertain the same in accordance with Section 5 of the
Limitation Act.
6. Taking into consideration that the petitioner has an alternative remedy for filing Patna High
Court CWJC No.12434 of 2019 dt.15-10-2025 complaint/application, the writ petition is disposed of
with a direction to the petitioner to file complaint/application within two months from the date of
receipt of this order before the concerned authority. The delay in filing the complaint/application
shall be condoned by the authority concerned, and the authority shall dispose of the same within
three months from the date of filing of the same.
7. With the above said observation, the Writ petition is disposed of.
8. Interlocutory Application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
