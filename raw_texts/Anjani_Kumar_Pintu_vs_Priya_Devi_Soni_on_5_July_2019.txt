======================================================
CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE ASHWANI KUMAR SINGH
ORAL JUDGMENT
Date : 05-07-2019 This application under Article 227 of the Constitution of India has been filed by
the petitioner for setting aside the order dated 25.05.2018 passed by the learned Principal Judge,
Family Court, Bhojpur, Ara whereby he has directed the petitioner to pay ad-interim maintenance to
the respondent amounting to Rs.8000/- per month from the date of filing of the suit and
Rs.20,000/- as cost of litigation to the respondent herein.
2. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner had initially filed Matrimonial
Case No. 6 of 2011 under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act for restitution of conjugal rights.
Since the respondent did not join in the said case in spite of due service of notice, the said case could
not proceed. Subsequently, the respondent filed a complaint vide Complaint Case No. 77C of 2015 in
the court against the petitioner inter alia Patna High Court C.Misc. No.387 of 2019 dt.05-07-2019
under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code. He submitted that as a matter of fact, the respondent
has herself deserted the petitioner and is not willing to live in her matrimonial home. Left with no
other option the petitioner filed Matrimonial Case No. 279 of 2013 seeking decree of divorce.
Considering the aforesaid aspects, the trial court ought to have rejected the application filed on
behalf of respondent but erroneously it has allowed the application of the respondent and directed
the petitioner, who is working as an agent in Sahara India to pay Rs.8000/- per month as
maintenance allowance. According to him, the order impugned is erroneous in law and is fit to be
set aside.
3. Having heard learned counsel for the petitioner and perused the materials on record, I find that
the petitioner has filed Matrimonial Case No.279 of 2013 seeking a decree of divorce. After filing of

Anjani Kumar @ Pintu vs Priya Devi @ Soni on 5 July, 2019
the Matrimonial Case No.279 of 2013, the respondent has filed Complaint Case No. 77C of 2015
against the petitioner under Section 498 A of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 3 and 4 of the
Dowry Prohibition Act alleging therein that she was married to the petitioner on 21.06.2010. After
marriage, she was subjected to cruelty in various ways for non-fulfillment of demand of dowry. The
said complaint case is still pending. Patna High Court C.Misc. No.387 of 2019 dt.05-07-2019
4. In her application, she has stated that the petitioner owns a three-storied house out of which two
stories have been given on rent. The petitioner earns Rs. 15,000/- per month as rent. He also owns
two vehicles, namely, Bolero and vehicle, which plies on hire. He also runs a poultry firm and is
engaged in trade of share. Apart from the income of the aforesaid sources, he is also working as an
agent of Sahara India. She has further stated that the total income of the petitioner is about Rs. 3
lakhs per month out of the different trade and business being done by the petitioner. She has also
stated that she does not have any income and is totally dependent on his brothers whose economic
condition is itself bad. On the basis of the aforesaid pleas, the respondent claimed Rs. 30,000/- per
month as an interim maintenance allowance.
5. The petitioner contested the claim of the respondent. He has stated in his reply to the claim made
by the petitioner that the brother of the respondent is a businessman and his monthly income is
about 1 lakh. He also owns a house in Kankarbagh Colony, Patna, which is fitted with all modern
appliances. The respondent is also a working lady and earns about Rs. 30,000/- per month. He has
denied having any vehicle or medical agency or poultry firm of his own. However, he has admitted
that he works as an agent in Sahara India and out of the income from the agency Patna High Court
C.Misc. No.387 of 2019 dt.05-07-2019 somehow he is able to lead his life. On such pleas, he has
made a request to the Court to dismiss the application filed by the respondent under Section 24 of
the Hindu Marriage Act.
6. Having appreciated the rival submissions, the court below has directed the petitioner to pay
interim maintenance allowance amounting to Rs. 8,000/- per month from the date of filing of the
suit and Rs.20,000/- as cost of litigation to the respondent.
7. As far as the factum of marriage is concerned, the same is not disputed. Though, the petitioner
has disputed his income from various sources, as stated by the respondent, he has admitted that he
is working as an agent in the Sahara India. He has not brought on record anything to suggest that
the respondent is a working lady. The statement made by the petitioner that the respondent is
earning Rs.30,000/- per month from her private job is not corroborated by any oral or documentary
evidence. That apart, the ground taken by the petitioner that since the respondent is not living in her
matrimonial house and has herself deserted the petitioner is no ground for denying her
maintenance. It is not disputed that the respondent has filed a case inter alia under Section 498A of
the Indian Penal Code against the petitioner, which is still pending in the court. If the wife alleges
that she is Patna High Court C.Misc. No.387 of 2019 dt.05-07-2019 being subjected to cruelty in her
matrimonial home, she has a right not to live in her matrimonial home in order to save herself from
further torture.

8. It is true that wife's income has to be taken into account while determining the amount of
maintenance payable to her. However, in absence of any proof of employment of the respondent, the
court below has rightly directed the petitioner to pay maintenance allowance to his wife.
9. In Sunita Kachwaha and Ors. vs. Anil Kuchwaha [(2014) 16 SCC 715], the Supreme Court has held
that even if the wife was earning some amount, that may not be a reason to outrightly reject her
maintenance application.
10. The amount allowed as interim maintenance allowance is neither unreasonable nor unjustified.
The order impugned needs no interference by this Court in exercise of power conferred under
Article 227 of the Constitution of India.
11. The application is dismissed.
