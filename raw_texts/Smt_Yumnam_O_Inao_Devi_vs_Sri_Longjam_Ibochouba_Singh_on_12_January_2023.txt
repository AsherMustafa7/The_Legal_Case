...Proforma Respondent BEFORE HON'BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. SANJAY KUMAR
12.01.2023 This revision petition, filed under Article 227 of the Constitution, arises out of the order
dated 03.06.2022 passed by the Revenue Tribunal, Thoubal, in Revenue Revision Case No. 11 of
2022. The petitioner is a third party to the said revision case.
Heard Ms. G. Pushpa, learned counsel for the petitioner; Mr. Liaquat Ali, learned counsel for
respondent No. 1, the petitioner in Revenue Revision Case No. 11 of 2022; and Ms. Momota Devi
Oinam, learned counsel for respondent No. 2, the respondent in Revenue Revision Case No. 11 of
2022.
Revenue Revision Case No. 11 of 2022 was preferred by respondent No. 1 herein under Section 95 of
the Manipur Land Revenue and Land Reforms Act, 1960, against the order dated 30.05.2022 passed
by the Sub-Deputy Collector, Khongjom, in Revenue Misc. Case No. 48 of 2021. The said
miscellaneous case was filed by respondent No. 1 herein under Section 81(2) of the Manipur Land

Smt. Yumnam (O) Inao Devi vs Sri Longjam Ibochouba Singh on 12 January, 2023
Revenue and Land Reforms Act, 1960, seeking to exercise the first option to purchase the land in
Patta No. 352(old), 447(new) covered by C.S. Dag No. 1195 measuring an area of 1.0700 hectares in
Village No. 38, Kang Samaram. However, the Sub-Deputy Collector noted in the order dated
30.05.2022 that the said land was the subject matter of the registered gift deed bearing Document
No. 565(V-I) dated 02.02.2021. Be it noted that the petitioner herein was gifted the said land under
this registered gift deed by respondent No. 2 herein, who was shown as the sole respondent in
Revenue Misc. Case No. 48 of 2021. The Sub-Deputy Collector, Khongjom, further noted that he had
no power to cancel the registered deed which had already been acted upon in Mutation Case No.
300/SDC/KJM, vide order dated 17.07.2021, and accordingly dismissed the application filed by
respondent No. 1. He, however, left it open to the interested parties to approach a higher Court.
Despite knowledge of the registered gift deed, whereby respondent No. 2 herein had gifted the said
land to the petitioner, respondent No. 1 herein chose to file Revenue Revision Case No. 11 of 2022
before the Revenue Tribunal, Thoubal, arraying only respondent No. 2 herein as the sole
respondent. Surprisingly, the Revenue Tribunal, Thoubal, failed to note that the order dated
30.05.2022 of the Sub-Deputy Collector, Khongjom, specifically referred to the third-party interest
created by the execution of the registered gift deed and straightaway entertained the revision case.
Further, by the impugned order dated 03.06.2022, the Tribunal stayed the operation of the order
dated 30.05.2022. Stay of the said order had no meaning whatsoever as the Sub- Deputy Collector,
Khongjom, had merely refused to entertain the application filed by respondent No. 1. Stay of
operation of such order had no consequence. In any event, on 12.07.2022, as the Tribunal had
entertained the Revenue Revision Case ignoring the crucial fact that the revision case suffered from
non- joinder of a necessary party, this Court granted interim stay of the operation of the order dated
03.06.2022 passed by the Revenue Tribunal, Thoubal, in Revenue Revision Case No. 11 of 2022.
This being the factual matrix, Mr. Liaquat Ali, learned counsel for respondent No. 1, states that he
would now take steps to implead the petitioner as a party respondent in Revenue Revision Case No.
11 of 2022 on the file of the Revenue Tribunal, Thoubal. He further states that he was ignorant of the
identity of the petitioner herein and that was the reason why steps were not taken before the
Tribunal earlier.
Accepting his submission, CRP(CRP.Art.227) No. 32 of 2022 is allowed. The order dated
03.06.2022 passed by the Revenue Tribunal, Thoubal, in Revenue Revision Case No. 11 of 2022 is
accordingly set-aside. Respondent No. 1 herein, the petitioner in Revenue Revision Case No. 11 of
2022 on the file of the Revenue Tribunal, Thoubal, is permitted to implead the petitioner herein as a
party respondent in the said revision case. The Revenue Tribunal shall consider prayer for interim
relief, if any, in the said revenue revision case only after effective appearance of the petitioner by
filing her reply therein.
In the circumstances, there shall be no order as to costs.
CHIEF JUSTICE Indrajeet
