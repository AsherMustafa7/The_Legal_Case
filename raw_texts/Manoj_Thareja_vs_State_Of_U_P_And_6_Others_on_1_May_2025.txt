b. Issue a further writ order or direction in the nature of Mandamus commanding
respondents not to demolish petitioner's construction upon land situated at gata no.
1035, area 0.17 hectare out of total area of 0.34 hectare in Bhogpur, Mithauni @ Siri,
Moradabad till the disposal of representation dated 21.04.2025;"
4. It appears that proceedings under the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorized Occupants) Act
were drawn against the petitioner on account of his allegedly having encroached upon the chak road.
These proceedings were decided against the petitioner. It is admitted that against the order, an
appeal alongwith an application for stay filed by the petitioner is pending consideration.
5. It appears that since no interim order is operating in favour of the petitioner, the Municipal
Authorities are allegedly proceeding to carry out demolition in so far as the encroachment is
concerned. It is in this context that the representation dated 21.4.2025 has been made by the
petitioner.
6. In our considered opinion, interest of justice would be served in case the newly added
respondent- the District Judge, Moradabad, before whom the appeal arising out of the proceedings
under the Public Premises Act is stated to be pending is directed to decide the stay application filed
by the petitioner, expeditiously and preferably, within a period of three weeks from the date a
certified copy of this order is filed before him.
7. It is needless to say that the order shall be passed after hearing all concerned.
8. Subject to the above, the petition stands disposed of.
