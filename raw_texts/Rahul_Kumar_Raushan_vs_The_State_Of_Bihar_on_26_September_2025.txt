3. The facts are admitted to the extent that the petitioner had passed his matriculation and
thereafter did his intermediate in Commerce. He further passed his B.Com (Accounts honours) in
the year 2002 from Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University. In the B.Com (Accounts honours) one of the
subsidiary papers of the petitioner was Hindi. In Pursuant to Notification No. PR/2019 issued by
respondent no.2 vide different memos for conducting State Teachers Eligibility Test (Class 9-10),
the petitioner had applied accordingly and was duly qualified. In the meanwhile, the Government of
Bihar invited online application through BPSC under Advertisement No.26/2023 for the
appointment of 1,70,461/- School Teachers under different categories. The petitioner submitted his
online application for Category-II for the post of Secondary School (Class 9-10). On being found
eligible, Admit Card was issued and accordingly he appeared in the examination on 25.08.2023 and
26.08.2023. The BPSC published the result of successful Patna High Court CWJC No.4078 of 2024
dt.26-09-2025 candidates on 21.10.2023. The name of the petitioner finds at serial no.56 under the
Backward Category.
4. In pursuant to the result, afore-noted, the Regional Deputy Director of Education, Munger issued
letter no.1524 dated 29.11.2023, and thereby directed the District Education Officer, Munger to do
the needful and accordingly the petitioner was selected for the district of Munger and he was called
for counselling. Despite completion of all the formalities of counselling, result of the petitioner has
been kept on hold. The petitioner submitted his application before the concerned respondents with
a request to issue his joining letter but no action has been taken; hence, the present writ petition.
5. Learned Advocate for the petitioner submitted that the stand of the State authorities that since
the petitioner was not qualified to be appointed as Secondary School Teacher with Hindi language
for which he had applied, his counselling was held up by the respondent authorities and thus
restrained him to be appointed on the desired posts, as for appointment to the post of Secondary
School Teacher (Class 9-10), the candidate must have Graduated from Hindi subject is wholly
unsustainable as there is no such requirement. Referring to the terms of the advertisement,
especially Clause 4(C)(iv), it is submitted that Patna High Court CWJC No.4078 of 2024
dt.26-09-2025 for appointment to the post of Secondary Teacher, a candidate must have passed
language subject for which he/she had applied for the post. The petitioner applied for language
paper Hindi and in the advertisement, it has been duly mentioned in the advertisement that in
Graduation, one of the papers should be Hindi. Thus the petitioner was satisfying all the criteria of
the captioned advertisement, besides the fact that the petitioner was qualified the examination of
STET. It is further reiterated that the petitioner had completed his Graduation with B.Com
(Accounts honours) and one of his compulsory papers was Hindi, which is apparent from his
educational certificate(s). Non-issuance of appointment letter in favour of the petitioner is wholly
unjustified, is the contention of the learned Advocate for the petitioner.
6. On the other hand, learned Advocate for the State submitted that the terms of the advertisement,
especially clause 4(C)(iv) mandates that the candidate must have Graduated from Hindi subject, if
he had applied for the said subject. Since the petitioner has done his Graduation with B.Com
(Accounts honours) and only one of his subsidiary papers was Hindi, therefore, he was not eligible
in terms of the advertisement.

7. Having considered the submissions advanced by Patna High Court CWJC No.4078 of 2024
dt.26-09-2025 the learned Advocate for the respective parties and taking note of the terms of the
advertisement, especially clause 4(C)(iv), this Court finds substance in the submission of the learned
Advocate for the petitioner.
8. Before parting with the case, it would be apt and proper to notice that the petitioner had passed
the State Teachers Eligibility Test under Notification No. PR/2019, the copy of which is marked as
Annexure-P/2 to the writ petition, in which one of the conditions, especially under clause 6.I
stipulates that the language subject (Hindi) must be studied at Graduation level. Since the petitioner
had passed his B.Com (Accounts honours) with Hindi subject, he had been allowed to appear and on
being found suitable, declared successful in Hindi subject. Subsequent thereto, against the
advertisement no.26/2023, the petitioner applied for the post of Secondary School Teacher (Class
9-10) and he was declared qualified, as is acknowledged from the result of the successful candidates,
the copy of which is marked as Annexure-P/6.
9. Now, after publication of the result the stand of the State that since the petitioner had not done
his Graduation in Hindi subject and therefore he is not qualified to be appointed as Secondary
School Teacher, without such stipulation in the Patna High Court CWJC No.4078 of 2024
dt.26-09-2025 advertisement is wholly unsustainable in law as well as on facts.
10. For better appreciation, it would be pertinent to quote clause 4(C)(iv) of the advertisement,
which reads as follows:
"(cid:128)(cid:129)(cid:130)(cid:129) (cid:131)(cid:132) (cid:131)(cid:133)(cid:134)(cid:133)(cid:135)(cid:135)(cid:136) (cid:135)(cid:137)(cid:130)(cid:138) :- (cid:139)(cid:129)(cid:135)(cid:138)(cid:139)(cid:139)(cid:140) (cid:139)(cid:141)(cid:140)(cid:140) (cid:140)(cid:132) (cid:142)(cid:143) (cid:144)(cid:132) (cid:136)(cid:145) (cid:128)(cid:129)(cid:130)(cid:129) (cid:131)(cid:132) (cid:131)(cid:139)(cid:134)(cid:133) (cid:139)(cid:135)(cid:136) (cid:139)(cid:137)(cid:130)(cid:138)(cid:146)
(cid:139)(cid:132) (cid:131)(cid:133) (cid:134)(cid:133)(cid:139)(cid:147)(cid:136) (cid:128)(cid:129)(cid:130)(cid:129) (cid:139)(cid:137)(cid:130)(cid:138) (cid:140)(cid:132) (cid:148)(cid:142) (cid:139)(cid:132) (cid:131)(cid:149)(cid:129)(cid:136)(cid:140) (cid:131)(cid:136)(cid:148) (cid:142)(cid:148) (cid:142)(cid:139)(cid:150)(cid:136) (cid:144)(cid:146)(cid:149)(cid:129) (cid:151)(cid:139)(cid:149)(cid:137)(cid:129)(cid:138)(cid:148) (cid:144)(cid:152) ."
11. Bare reading of the aforesaid stipulation, this Court does not find that a candidate must have
Graduated from Hindi subject, rather it only qualifies that the relevant language paper must be
studied at Graduation level.
12. The observation made hereinabove, also fortified with the statement, especially para-8 of the
counter affidavit, which is incorporated hereunder:-
"8. That it is humbly submitted that from the perusal of eligibility criteria/conditions
mentioned at Para No.-6 & 7 it is clear that petitioner doesn't possess the essential
qualification to be appointed as secondary school teacher (class 9-10) as he-
a- Applied for to be appointed as secondary school teacher (class9-10) for language
paper i.e. hindi.
b- Graduated from B.Com (Hons) his subsidiary paper was economics and hindi was
his compulsory subject.

c- Is qualified from hindi subject in STET. Patna High Court CWJC No.4078 of 2024
dt.26-09-2025 However, for appointment as secondary school teacher (Class 9-10),
the Candidate must have either graduated from hindi or have hindi as a subsidiary
paper in graduation.
(emphasis supplied).
13. In the case in hand, the fact is not in dispute that the petitioner has passed his B.Com (Accounts
honours) with a Hindi subject as subsidiary. All the more, the petitioner had all along been allowed
to appear in State Teachers Eligibility Test where he was qualified with Hindi subject and further he
declared successful in the School Teachers Recruitment Examination, 2023 in connection with
advertisement no. 26/2023; hence, any objection at this stage by the authority without any such
stipulation in substance is unsustainable.
14. In view of the aforesaid facts and the discussions, this Court directs respondents no.6 and 7 to
issue appointment letter in favour of the petitioner in terms with the result published on 21.10.2023,
preferably within a period of eight weeks from the date of receipt/production of a copy of this order
along with the notional benefits, as have been accorded to the successful candidates, who were
junior in rank to the petitioner, in case the petitioner is otherwise found suitable.
Patna High Court CWJC No.4078 of 2024 dt.26-09-2025
15. The writ petition stands allowed.
