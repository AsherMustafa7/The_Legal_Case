ORDER
[Order of the Court was made by B.PUGALENDHI, J.] This writ petition has been filed by an
Archaka in Arulmigu Sri Rajagopalaswamy Kulasekara Aalwar Thirukovil, Mannar Kovil, as pro
bono publico for a direction to the respondents not to take any steps in furtherance to the launching
of the Thirukoil TV, as per the announcement in Ta.Na.Sa.Pe.No.009, dated 24.03.2020, without
appointing security personnel and other temple staff on minimum / living wages to all the temples
under the Administrative control of the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department.
2.The Grievance of the petitioner is that there are 36000 temples under the control of the Hindu
Religious and Charitable Endowments Department and most of the temples are without adequate
staff, such as http://www.judis.nic.in Archaka, Watchman, Sweeper and other servants and
therefore, most of the temples are left without proper care and protection. Several valuable idols
were also stolen away and the devotees are even finding it difficult to enter into the temples.
3.Heard Mr.K.Gokul, learned Counsel appearing for the petitioner and Mr.K.P.Narayana Kumar,
learned Special Government Pleader appearing for the respondents.
4.The Government has taken a policy decision for launching a dedicated television channel for the
Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department for telecasting the festivals and bringing
out the cultural richness of the temples in Tamil Nadu. The announcement was made on the Floor of
the Assembly by the Hon'ble Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu under Rule 110 and the fund allocation
for the same was also made to the extent of 8.77 crores. Pursuant to the same, the Commissioner,
Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department has also issued certain guidelines to the
Executive Officers of all the temples, how to record the features of the temples and the festivals
conducted, for telecasting in the Thirukoil TV. http://www.judis.nic.in
5.Even according to the petitioner, he welcomes the announcement of launching the Thirukoil TV.
However, the concern of the petitioner is that there are several other issues, which deserve priority
than launching of Thirukoil TV. The Government, instead of taking initiatives for the safety and
security of the temples and the idols, is giving priority to the launching of the TV. Further, the
petitioner has also claimed that he has filed two other writ petitions in W.P(MD)Nos.19286 of 2016
and 22907 of 2017 praying for minimum / living wages for the temple staff.
6.The proposal to launch the dedicated TV is a policy decision of the Government, which has been
announced by the Hon'ble Chief Minister on the Floor of the Assembly under Rule 110. Therefore,
this Court is not inclined to interfere with such an announcement. Moreover, the petitioner cannot

club the appointment of the Watchman, Archaka and other staff for the temples with the proposed
dedicated television channel for the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department and
the petitioner himself has stated that he welcomes the announcement of the Thirukoil TV, but his
concern is the requirement of adequate staff in the Temples to protect the temples and the valuable
idols. http://www.judis.nic.in
7.It is needless to say the that it is the duty of the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments
Department to protect the temples and the valuable Idols in the temples. By referring the same, the
launching of dedicated Televison channel cannot be stalled.
8.With the above observation, the writ petition is dismissed. It is open to the petitioner to work out
his remedy in the other writ petitions filed by him. No Costs.
