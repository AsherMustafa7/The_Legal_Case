THESE W.Ps. HAVING BEEN HEARD AND RESERVED
FOR ORDERS ON 28.10.2022, COMING ON FOR
PRONOUNCEMENT OF ORDERS THIS DAY, ALOK ARADHE J.,
MADE THE FOLLOWING:
ORDER
The petitioners in W.P.No.20701/2022 and W.P.No.20921/2022 are minority educational
institutions established and administered by the Trust. Similarly, petitioner in W.P.No.20917/2022
is an educational institution administered by the Trust. The petitioners are aggrieved by the action
of the State Government in drawing up a seat matrix and in notifying the fee structure for admission
to various post graduate courses for academic year 2022-23. In order to appreciate the grievance of
the petitioners, few relevant facts need mention. For the facility of reference, facts from
W.P.No.20701/22 are being referred to.
2. The petitioner is a private unaided linguistic minority institution, which was established and is
being administered by Srinivasa Trust primarily for the benefit of members of Telugu linguistic
minority community in the State of Karnataka. For the academic year 2022-23, the State
Government had prepared draft terms of consensual agreement and shared it with respondent No.4,
which is an association of minority professional colleges in the State of Karnataka (hereinafter
referred to as 'the association' for short). The association in turn shared it with its members
including the petitioner for deliberation and consideration. The petitioner thereupon submitted a
representation on 07.07.2022 and 19.09.2022 expressing serious reservations and concerns in
respect of various clauses in the draft agreement.
3. However, the Karnataka Examination Authority (hereinafter referred to as 'the authority' for
short) issued a notification on 19.09.2022 inviting applications from candidates who had qualified
for NEET PG 2022 / NEET MDS - 2022 for grant of admission to post graduate courses for the
academic year 2022-23. On 08.10.2022 a calendar of events indicating the seats for PG medical and
dental admissions for academic year 2022-23 was published. The association entered into a
consensual agreement with Government of Karnataka on 04.10.2022 in the matter of regulating
admissions and fee structure of post graduate courses in private professional colleges for the
academic year 2022-23. Thereafter, on 09.10.2022 seat matrix was published.
4. The petitioner on perusal of seat matrix found that while in respect of several other institutions
the overall intake across all PG streams had been factored in for the purposes of such
apportionment, keeping in view the fact that the increase of fee structure has been confined only to
management quota seats, in case of the petitioner, the distribution of seats is taken up on course
wise basis.
5. The petitioner thereupon submitted a representation on 13.10.2022 to the Association to
immediately withdraw from Central counseling conducted by the authority in view of discrepancy in
seat matrix for admission to Post Graduate Degree / Diploma courses for the academic year
2022-23. In the representation, it was stated that fee being charged / chargeable was Rs.12,48,176/-,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158422859/ 6
Vydehi Institute Of Medical Sciences vs State Of Karnataka on 29 October, 2022
Rs.3,12,048/- and Rs.1,56,971/- respectively for clinical, para clinical and pre clinical courses. It was
further stated that concession agreed to be given was 20% of the said amount Rs.9,98,540/-
Rs.2,49,638/- and Rs.1,25,576/-. However, in the impugned notification, the 20% of concession was
worked out to Rs.6,98,280/- Rs.1,74,570 and Rs.87,286/- in respect of clinical, para clinical and pre
clinical courses respectively.
6. The petitioner thereafter submitted detailed representations on 14.10.2022 and 16.10.2022. The
petitioners filed these writ petitions, in which writ of certiorari has been sought for quashment of
impugned seat matrix as well as fee notification issued by the authority. The petitioners in addition
seek a writ of mandamus directing the authority to consider petitioners seat distribution list
submitted on 07.10.2022. The petitioners also seek a writ of mandamus directing the Government
of Karnataka to determine the fee, through a fee fixation committee for the block period 2022 till
2025.
7. Learned Senior counsel for the petitioners in W.P.No.20701/2022 submitted that the petitioner is
a minority education institution and in view of amended Article 15(5) of the Constitution of India,
no reservation can be imposed on the petitioner. It is further submitted that even though members
of the association including the petitioner has been repeatedly asking for constitution of the fee
fixation committee, every year at the last moment, the association is pressurized to sign in on the so
called consensual agreement without constituting a fee fixation committee to determine the cost
involved in imparting quality education. It is also submitted that in respect of several other
institutions, overall intake across all PG streams had been factored in for the purpose of such
apportionment, however, in case of the petitioner, the distribution of seats is taken up on course
wise basis, leading to glaring inequality. It is argued that impugned notifications pertaining to seat
matrix and fee structures is in violation of the consensual agreement. It is further argued that
impugned notification pertaining to fee structure provides for two to three times of agreed
concession of 20% to the government quota admissions and is thus in contravention with clause
4(e) of the consensual agreement. In support of aforesaid submissions, reference has been made to
decisions in 'T.M.A. PAI FOUNDATION VS. STATE OF KARNATAKA', (2002) 8 SCC 481, 'ISLAMIC
ACADEMY OF EDUCATION AND VS. STATE OF KARNATAKA AND OTHERS', (2003) 6 SCC 697,
'P.A.INAMDAR & ORS VS. STATE OF MAHARASHTRA & ORS', (2005) 6 SCC 537.
8. It is also contended that even in respect of a dispute arising out of a contract to which State is a
party the same is open to challenge on the ground of Article 14 specially when bargaining power of
both the parties is not the same. In support of aforesaid submissions, reference has been made to
decisions in 'SRILEKHA VIDYARTHI (KUMARI) v. STATE OF U.P.', (1991) 1 SCC 212 and
VERIGAMTO NAVEEN VS. GOVT OF A.P., (2001) 8 SCC
344.
9. Learned Senior counsel for the petitioner in W.P.No.20917/2022 contended that the seat matrix
and impugned fee notification is in contravention with the consensual agreement inasmuch as
before fixation of seat matrix, the petitioner has not been consulted as required under Section 4A of
the Karnataka Professional Education Institutions (Regulation of Admission and Determination of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158422859/ 7
Vydehi Institute Of Medical Sciences vs State Of Karnataka on 29 October, 2022
Fee) Act, 2006 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act' for short) read with Clause 3(a) and 6 of the
Consensual agreement.
10. Learned Senior counsel for the petitioner in W.P.No.20921/2022 while inviting the attention of
this court to judgment dated 15.03.2022 passed by a division bench of Kalaburgi bench of this court
in W.P.No.200365/2022 submitted that the seat matrix has to be re-worked taking into account the
mandate contained in Article 371J of the Constitution of India. It is urged that the steps have to be
taken by Government of Karnataka to implement the mandate contained in Section 6 and 7 of the
2006 Act.
11. On the other hand, learned Additional Advocate General submitted that parties have entered into
a contract by executing a consensual agreement in terms of Section 4 of the 2006 Act and the
aforesaid statutory agreement binds the petitioners. It is urged that the association had entered into
consensual agreement with the State Government and the petitioners who are members of the
association are bound by the agreement. It is contended that other members of the association did
not have any grievance except the petitioners who are three in number. It is also pointed out that
association having entered into consensual agreement with the State Government ought to have
approached this court. It is further contended that since, the petitioners are bound by the
consensual agreement, the operation of the Act is suspended and therefore, reliance of the
petitioners on the mandate contained in Section 6 and 7 of the Act demanding fee determination by
the Fee Fixation committee is redundant.
12. It is argued that the educational institutions themselves had agreed to the fee structure which is
apparent from perusal of annexure-R2. Therefore, the petitioners are bound by the admissions
made by them and cannot wriggle out of the same. It is contended that even assuming that a wrong
has done by the authorities in apportionment of seats, the petitioners cannot seek the benefit of the
said wrong as the same would amount to reverse discrimination. Our attention has also been invited
to clause 4(h) of the consensual agreement to contend that to prevent any dispute or litigation in the
matter of consensual agreement matter relating to either seat sharing formula or fee structure, the
decision of the admission overseeing committee is final. It is therefore, contended that the
petitioners should approach the admission overseeing committee for redressal of their grievance.
13. Learned Senior counsel for the Association while supporting the case of petitioners contended
that in view of Section 6 and 7 of 2006 Act, the issue pertaining to fixation of fee has to be taken up
by the fee fixation committee. It is also pointed out that despite the direction issued by this court in
the order dated 13.03.2017 passed by division bench of this court in W.P.No.5105/2017 and other
connected matters, the fee has not been fixed by the fee regulatory committee. It is also urged that
the association was compelled to enter into consensual agreement dated 04.10.2022 and fixation of
fee has been made in a arbitrary manner.
14. By way of rejoinder, learned Senior counsel for the petitioners have submitted that consensual
agreement is not a contract and certainly is not a commercial contact to contend exclusion of
judicial review. Attention of this court has also been invited to para 12 of the rejoinder and it is
contended that Annexure R2 is a document which is from college portal of Association website, that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158422859/ 8
Vydehi Institute Of Medical Sciences vs State Of Karnataka on 29 October, 2022
was intended to indicate the sanctioned intake of the association and the fee structure proposed
under respective heads of NRI quota and other quota. It is pointed out that columns of fee under
government and private seats were automatically generated and filled up by the computer without
an option to correct the same. It is also pointed out that it is the fees for NRI and other category of
admission, which was left blank and which was required to be filled up by college management and
have been accordingly filled up.
15. It is submitted that the agreement suffers from a mistake apparent on the face of the record
insofar as it pertains to fixation of fee and therefore, needs to be judicially reviewed and corrected. It
is further submitted that petitioners seek parity of treatment based on assurance held out in
consensual agreement. The denial of fee hike for government quota seats is arbitrary and therefore,
the question of reverse discrimination does not arise. It is also urged that fixation of fee is made
every year and each fixation of fee gives rise to a fresh cause of action and merely because the
petitioners have not questioned the fixation of fee in previous years, the same does not debar them
from questioning the fee this year.
16. We have considered the rival submissions made on both sides and have perused the record. The
Hon'ble Supreme Court in its judgment in ISLAMIC ACADEMY OF EDUCATION AND OTHERS
Supra sought to regulate admissions to professional courses through two committees, one for
overseeing the admissions and the other for approving the fee structure in professional educational
institutions pending enactment of appropriate law by the Parliament. The 2006 Act has been
enacted with a view to provide for regulation of admission and determination of fee in a professional
educational courses in the State of Karnataka and to provide for reservation of seats to persons
belonging to scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and other backward classes in professional
educational institutions. Section 4A of the Act, which deals with method of admission in case of
consensual agreement, Section 6, which deals with constitution of fee regulatory committee and
Section 7, which prescribes the factors to be taken into account for determination of fee, read as
under:
4A. Method of admission in case of consensual agreement: (1) Notwithstanding
anything contained in this Act, in case if the State Government and the association of
unaided professional educational institutions whether minority or non-minority

institutions, shall be done by the Common Entrance Test Committee as Government

(a) summoning and enforcing the attendance of any witness and examining him on oath; (b) the
discovery and production of any document; (c) the reception of evidence on affidavits; (d) the
issuing of any commission for the examination of witness. (4) The fee determined by the Committee
shall be binding on the professional educational institution for a period of three years. At the end of
the said period the institution would be at liberty to apply for revision. The fee so determined shall
be applicable to a candidate who is admitted to an institution in that academic year and shall not be
revised till the completion of his course in the said college. No professional educational institution
shall collect a fee amounting to more than one year's fee from a candidate. Collecting of more than
one year's fee shall be construed as collecting of capitation fee and shall be liable for penalty under
the Karnataka Educational Institutions (Prohibition of Capitation Fee) Act, 1984 (Karnataka Act 37
of 1984). (5) No person who is associated with any private aided or unaided professional educational
institution shall be eligible for being a member of the Fee Regulatory Committee. (6) Subject to the
pleasure of the authority competent to nominate, the term of the office of the nominated members
shall be for the period of two years from the date of their nomination and in the case of vacancy
arising earlier, for any reason, such vacancy shall be filled for the remainder of the term. The
non-official members shall be eligible to draw such rate of sitting fee and Traveling Allowance as
may be prescribed. (7) No act or proceeding of the Fee Regulatory Committee shall be deemed to be
invalid by the reason merely of any vacancy in, or any defect in the constitution of the committee.
(8) A member of the Fee Regulatory Committee shall cease to be so if he performs any act which in
the opinion of the State Government is unbecoming of a member of the committee:
Provided that no such member shall be removed from the committee without giving
him an opportunity of being heard. (9) The Chairman shall preside over the meeting
of the Fee Regulatory Committee and the Committee may adopt its own procedure as
it deems fit.
7. Factors for Determination of Fee.- (1) The Fee Regulatory Committee shall determine the fee or
fees to be charged by a private aided or unaided professional educational institution affiliated to an
University taking into consideration the factors, such as,- (a) the location of the professional
educational institution; (b) the nature of professional course; (c) the available infrastructure; (d) the
expenditure on administration and maintenance; (e) a reasonable surplus required for the growth
and development of the institution (f) any other factors as the Committee may deem fit. (2) No
professional educational institution shall collect any fee by whatever name or form called from the
candidate for admission to professional educational courses over and above the fee determined by
the Fee Regulatory Committee and the fee prescribed by the university concerned. (3) The Fee
Regulatory Committee may determine different fees in respect of different courses of professional
education being offered at different institutions depending upon the facilities available and for this
purpose it may place similarly placed institutions in broad groups:
Provided that the Fee Regulatory Committee may allow a professional educational
institution to collect a higher rate of fee from the Non-Resident Indian student for
admission. The State Government may prescribe the minimum fee to be collected
from the non-resident Indian student and the higher fee so collected over and above
the fee determined for other students in that institution shall be utilized for providing
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158422859/ 13
Vydehi Institute Of Medical Sciences vs State Of Karnataka on 29 October, 2022
concession in fee to candidates belonging to the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled
Tribes and Other Backward Classes. (4) Any complaint of collecting of capitation fee
or fee in excess of the fee determined or profiteering by any institution shall be
inquired into by the Fee Regulatory Committee which shall, after obtaining the
evidence and the explanation of the management concerned, forward appropriate
recommendations to the concerned university or the State Government for necessary
action. On such recommendation, the State Government may direct the concerned
university to levy and collect a fine upto rupees ten lakhs on the management of such
professional educational institution and it shall be lawful for the university to levy
such fine. The university shall not approve all or any of the admissions made to such
institutions in contravention of the provisions of this Act or may withdraw
recognition or affiliation to such institution under intimation to the State
Government:
17. Thus from perusal of Section 4A(1) of the Act, it is evident that notwithstanding
anything contained in the provisions of the Act, the State Government and
association of unaided professional educational institutions are at liberty to enter
into consensual agreement with regard to sharing of seats and fixation of fee in
respect of such seats in the said unaided professional educational institutions, in such
year, the admission to such number of seats as agreed upon by the State Government
and the private educational institutions. Thus, under the provisions of the Act,
notwithstanding the fact that fee has to be fixed by the fee regulatory committee on
the basis of factors to be taken into account under Section 7 of the Act, the State
Government has the power to enter into consensual agreement with the association
of unaided professional educational institutions. The provisions of Section 4A(1) of
the Act overrides the provisions of Section 6 and 7 of the Act.
18. In exercise of aforesaid power, the State Government has entered into a
consensual agreement with the association on 04.10.2022. Clause 3 of the agreement
deals with seat sharing, whereas, clause 4 deals with fee structure. Clause 5(h) of the
agreement provides that in respect of dispute or litigation in the matter of consensual
agreement, the decision of admission overseeing committee shall be final. Clauses 3,
4 and 5 (h) of the agreement read as under:
3. Seat sharing:
a) The Association of Minority
Professional Colleges in Karnataka
members, imparting studies in Post
Graduate Education in medical sciences in their respective institutions, would make

quota / higher fee quota on the basis of inter se merit among the applicants who are NEET qualified
and eligible through common counseling.
c) In view of the making over of 20% of its total available seats in PG courses, the Government of
Karnataka, hereby exempts the members of the AMPCK from the obligation, if any of providing for
reservations for either SCs, STs or other backward classes separately, since the Government of
Karnataka itself is providing for requisite 'reservations', in seats now available to the Government
out of aforesaid 20% of seats, in PG courses in the institutions/ colleges of private managements.
For 55% 'Private seats (P), the members of AMPCK shall adhere to provisions of Article 371(J) of the
Constitution of India mutatis mutandis, in respect of institutions located in Hyderabad
- Karnataka region.
4. Fee Structure a. Although, as per Section 6 of Karnataka Act 8 of 2006, the Fee Regulatory
Committee is in existence, the Government of Karnataka specially exempts the members of AMPCK
from the operation of Section 7(2) of Act No.8/2006 and in lieu thereof, it is agreed by the parties

AMPCK institutions under various categories, for the academic year 2022-23 shall be as follows:

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158422859/ 16
Vydehi Institute Of Medical Sciences vs State Of Karnataka on 29 October, 2022
applicable is the fee to be collected by the Counseling authorities during allotment of
seats and the respective colleges, which are entitled to collect Hostel and Mess fees
and other fees not exceeding Rs.15,000/- per annum, transportation fees if opted by
the students may be collected.
c. Apart from this, in case any member Institution is providing skill lab facility of
similar facility/facilities, the respective colleges can charge reasonable fees which
shall not in any case exceed Rs.30,000/- per annum. However, the fees for above
items shall be informed to Government well in advance by the colleges so that the
same could be notified in the website and the brochure.
d. It is made clear that none of the
covenants under this agreement shall
preclude the colleges executing this
agreement from exercising their rights from seeking redressal for their grievances in
regard to fixation of fee from any competent authority.
e. The AMPCK considering the request by the State Government have now resolved
to extend the same gestures as were extended for previous year, by way of
'scholarship' to Socially and Economically Weaker Sections and others; and
participate in social welfare measures/schemes of the Government. Therefore, it is
proposed and provided that, for 'all PG Course seats' made over to the Government
for grant of admission in accordance with its reservation policy, the members of
AMPCK colleges will extend 'the freeships and scholarships by way of fee concessions'
of 20% of the fees actually being charged by each of the AMPCK institutions for the
current year; by way of scholarships under this Consensual Agreement; out of
additional fees receivable from the category of students falling under Clause 3b(iii)
and 3b(iv) of this agreement.
f. The students admitted for Post Graduate Courses shall pay the tuition fees at the
time of allotment of seats; and or while seeking admission under the allotment as
may be prescribed and notified. Fee structure shall be binding on all the students
allotted to the respective colleges through common counseling for the 2022-23 batch
every year till the completion of their study. In the event of non-payment of fees in
terms of the Consensual Agreement by the student, the college management is at
liberty to suspend imparting education to such defaulting students. The tuition fees
and other fees as notified by the individual institutions shall be paid by the students.
The KEA or the concerned authority shall remit the fee collected to the respective
institutions within 3 months of the receipt of the same, failing which KEA shall pass
on the due to the institution along with simple interest (Bank rate of Interest fixed by
RBI).
f. All financial dues (inclusive of fees, deposits, all such other charges) payable by the students to the
college shall be published in the college website.

Vydehi Institute Of Medical Sciences vs State Of Karnataka on 29 October, 2022
g. The students under NRI and other quota shall furnish bank guarantees for the balance fees at the
time of admission or at such period of time granted by the college. Non-furnishing of the bank
guarantee within the stipulated period would result in cancellation of admission or suspension of
classes till the furnishing of the Bank Guarantee in favour of the colleges.
5. Modalities for Admission:
(h). To prevent any dispute or litigation in the matter of Consensual Agreement now being entered
in to between the State Government and the AMPCK, relating to either Seat Sharing Formula and/
or Fee Structure for the batch of students being admitted for the academic year 2022-23 through
KEA and or, any other issues connected there with it, the decision of the Admission Overseeing
Committee shall be final with regard to admission process.
19. Thus, it is evident that Section 4(A)(1) itself provides for consensual agreement and is a
provision which over rides all other provisions in 2006 Act including Section 6 and 7 of the Act.
Admittedly, the Association on behalf of petitioners as well have executed a consensual agreement
with the State Government on 04.10.2022. The agreement provides for the issues relating to seat
matrix and sharing of seats and fixation of fee. The consensual agreement has been executed by the
association of private unaided professional educational institutions. The petitioners being members
of the association are bound by the agreement. It is pertinent to mention that association has not
filed any writ petition challenging the consensual agreement. It is also worth mentioning that
petitioners also have not sought for quashment of the consensual agreement.
20. A contract being creature of agreement between the parties binds the parties. The association of
which the petitioners are members, has entered into an agreement with the State Government with
eyes wide open. It is pertinent to note that the majority of the members of the association have not
raised any grievance either about seat matrix or about fixation of fee. It is worth noticing that any
alteration in the seat matrix at the instance of the petitioners shall affect the other members of the
associations who are not before the court. The material on record also indicates that the consensual
agreement consist of similar terms and conditions as were incorporated in previous years also.
However, no grievance by the petitioners in previous years was made. The terms of the consensual
agreement have remained identical over the last several years. There is no material on record to
suggest that any coercion was exercised by the government for entering into consensual agreement.
The consensual agreement therefore, binds the petitioners.
21. Clause 4A of the agreement deals with the fee to be charged for the academic year 2022-23.
Clause 4A of the agreement provides that there shall be no fee hike for academic session 2022-23
insofar as government seats are concerned. However, the fee has been hiked by 10% in respect of
private seats. The fee structure prescribed in the agreement has to be given effect to in its entirety
and cannot be read disjunctively to the benefit of the petitioners. The amount of fee has been
specified in clear terms in the agreement and the petitioners as stated supra are bound by the
agreement.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158422859/ 18
Vydehi Institute Of Medical Sciences vs State Of Karnataka on 29 October, 2022
22. So far as the challenge of the petitioners to the seat matrix is concerned, the aforesaid challenge
proceeds on the basis that the consensual agreement contains a promise that the petitioners would
be provided substantial number of NRI and management seats. However, from the careful scrutiny
of the consensual agreement, we find that no such promise is held out in the consensual agreement.
The terms of contract are reduced into writing and the terms of contract alone would determine its
interpretation. The petitioners have not been able to demonstrate any violation of terms of
consensual agreement while allotment of seats. The petitioners have also failed to make out the
ground that allotment of seats has been done in an arbitrary manner. In any case the scope of
Judicial review on the issue of allotment of seats is limited and the allotment of seats has been made
in accordance with consensual agreement.
23. The contention of the petitioners that merely some other colleges have received slightly higher
seats in NRI and management quota, the petitioners should also be given higher number of seats in
the said quota cannot be accepted. Merely on the basis of aforesaid reasoning, it cannot be inferred
that there is an element of discrimination or arbitrariness, therefore, the provisions of Article 14 of
the Constitution of India have been violated. The seats under different categories are allotted to the
educational institutions every year on rotation basis. From perusal of the relevant extract of the seat
matrix, it transpires that petitioners were given more seats in NRI as well as Management quota in
earlier academic years. The relevant extract pertaining to seat matrix of one of the subjects viz.,
dermatology is reproduced for the facility of reference:

1 1 4 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 4 Thus, it is evident that the petitioners have got more seats in
NRI and management quota in previous years. Merely because they have got less
seats in NRI and management quota this year, the petitioners cannot be permitted to
make a complaint in this regard in the absence of violation of any statutory right.
Neither the provisions of the Act nor the provisions of the consensual agreement
incorporate the principle of natural justice.
Therefore, the contention of the petitioners that the petitioners ought to have been consulted before
allotment of seats is misconceived and does not deserve acceptance.
24. The impact and effect of the provisions contained in Article 371J on minority educational
institutions as well as on the seat matrix was challenged before Kalaburgi bench of this court in
W.P.No.200345/2022. A division bench of this court vide order dated 15.03.2022 allowed the writ
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158422859/ 19
Vydehi Institute Of Medical Sciences vs State Of Karnataka on 29 October, 2022
petition in part and quashed the seat matrix insofar as it is applicable to the petitioner therein. A
division bench of this court recorded the findings with regard to the terms of interpretation of
Article 371J as well as its effect. Learned Senior counsel for the petitioners in W.P.No.20901/2022
has placed reliance on the observations of division bench of this court, however, suffice it to say that
the aforesaid order passed by a division bench o f this court was subject matter of challenge in SLP
(C) No.6552- 6553/2022 and Hon'ble Supreme court by an order dated 27.04.2022 has stayed the
effect and operation of the order passed by the division bench of this court. Therefore, the reliance
placed by learned Senior counsel on the findings recorded by division bench of this court in relation
to Article 371J of the Constitution of India is of no assistance to the petitioner in the said case. It is
also noteworthy that percentage of seats can be agreed upon in terms of Section 4A of the 2006 Act
and therefore, an agreement with regard to sharing of seats on any other percentage is also
permissible.
25. In the disputes pertaining to counseling, seat sharing, fee structure as well as admission to
professional courses, the time is the essence. The consensual agreement was executed on
04.10.2022. The entire process of counseling commenced and the first stage of counseling was
completed on 14.10.2022. On the said date W.P.No.20701/2022, (Vydehi Institute of Medical
Sciences) was filed and whereas, W.P.No.20917/2022 and W.P.No.20921/2022 were filed on
20.10.2022. In cases of this nature, everyday's delay is crucial as the interests of the students are
involved. Therefore, in the facts of the case, we hold that the delay on the part of the petitioners in
approaching the court was substantial in nature, which disentitles to them to any discretionary relief
under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
26. The petitioners have sought a writ of mandamus directing the Government of Karnataka to take
steps as mandatory in terms of Section 6 and 7 of the 2006 Act to determine the fee to the fee
fixation committee for the block period 2022-2025. However, provisions of Section 6 and 7 are
subject to provisions of Section 4A(1) of the Act which empowers the government to enter into a
consensual agreement. However, with a view to mitigate the grievances of the members of the
respondent No.4-Association, we hope and trust that the State Government shall advert to the need
of fixation of fee as mandated under Section 6 and 7 of the Act as under the aforesaid provisions the
fixation of fee has an element of adjudication.
Accordingly, the petitions are disposed of.
