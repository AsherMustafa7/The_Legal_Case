JUDGMENT
Mr.K.V.Aravind, learned counsel for the revenue. Mr.K.K.Chythanya., learned counsel for the
assessee. This appeal under Section 260A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (hereinafter referred to as the
Act for short) has been preferred by the revenue. The subject matter of the appeal pertains to the
Assessment year 2007-08. The appeal was admitted by a bench of this Court vide order dated
27.02.2013 on the following substantial questions of law:
(i) Whether the appellate authorities were correct in holding that the assessee is
entitle to claim deduction under Section 10A of the Act, in respect of its units 2, 3 & 4
despite the assessee failing to satisfy the conditions stipulated commencement of
units from a particular date when the assessee's units had already commenced much
before obtaining the licence for the bonded warehouse and contrary to the provisions
of Section 10A of the Act?
(ii) Whether the tribunal was correct in directing to exclude telecommunication
expenses from export turnover and total turnover when there is no provision in
Section 10A mandating exclusion of expenses from total turnover when excluded
from export turnover?
(iii) Whether the appellate authorities were correct in including the foreign exchange
gain for units 5 & 6 for computing exemption under Section 10A of the Act, when the
same was incidental and not derived from the export?
(iv) Whether the appellate authorities were correct in treating the foreign exchange
gain as export profits without taking into consideration the date of raising the sale
bill, date on which foreign exchange remittance was received and the date on which
the assessee has converted the foreign exchange into Indian rupee?

(v) Whether the tribunal was correct in accepting the alternate contention of the
assessee to exclude income from recruitment fee/ body shopping from total turnover
when there is no provision is Section 10A requiring exclusion of such fee from total
turnover?
2. Learned counsel for the assessee submitted that the first substantial question of law has already
been answered against the revenue and in favour of the assessee by a bench of this court vide
judgment dated 20.06.2014 passed in I.T.A.No.403/2008 c/w I.T.A.No.402/2008
(COMMISSIONER OF INCOME- TAX AND ANOTHER VS. M/S CARITOR (INDIA) PVT. LTD.).
The aforesaid submissions could not be disputed by learned counsel for the revenue.
3. With regard to second and fifth substantial questions of law, it is pointed out by the learned
counsel for the assessee that the aforesaid issues are no longer res integra and they have already
been answered against the revenue by judgment of the Supreme Court in 'COMMISSIONER OF
INCOME-TAX, CENTRAL -III VS. HCL TECHNOLOGIES LTD.', 404 ITR 719. Learned counsel was
unable to dispute the aforesaid legal position.
4. Learned counsel for the assessee further submitted that the third substantial question of law has
already been decided against the revenue and in favour of the assessee by a judgment passed by a
division bench of this court dated 22.11.2011 passed in I.T.A.No.1189/2006 (THE COMMISSIONER
OF INCOME TAX AND ANOTHER VS. M/S INFOSYS TECHNOLOGIES LTD.) and has already
been answered against the revenue and in favour of the assessee. The aforesaid submission also
could not be disputed by learned counsel for the revenue.
5. With regard to fourth substantial question of law, it is pointed out that the same has been
answered in favour of the assessee and against the revenue by a judgment of High Court of Bombay
in 'COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX VS. GEM PLUS JEWELLERY INDIA LTD.', 330 ITR 175.
The aforesaid submission also could not be disputed by learned counsel for the revenue.
6. For the reasons assigned in the aforementioned judgments, the substantial question of law
