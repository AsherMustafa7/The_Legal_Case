DR. JUSTICE S.K. PANIGRAHI
DATE OF HEARING:-20.01.2025
DATE OF JUDGMENT: -14.02.2025
Dr. S.K. Panigrahi, J.
1. Both the Appeals under Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter
referred to as ‚A&C Act‛) have been filed against the common judgment dated 23.2.2024 passed by
the Ld. District Judge, Cuttack in Arbitration Petition No. 15 of 2019 arising out of award dated
22.5.2019 passed by the Ld. Collector & District Magistrate Cum Sole Arbitrator in ARB Misc. Case
No. 1 of 2016. As both Appeals arise out of the same impugned judgment and raise the same
questions of law, it is considered prudent to deal with them together. Hereinafter, the parties are
referred to as their original position in the arbitration for the sake of convenience.
I. FACTUAL MATRIX OF THE CASE:
2. For the sake of brevity, the admitted facts involved in the appeals are pithily discussed herein:
Designation: AR-CUM- SR. SECRETARY Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT,
CUTTACK Date: 19-Feb-2025 17:22:45 i. The Government of India, Ministry of Road
Transport and Highways, New Delhi issued a Notification u/s 3A of the NH Act, 1956
vide S.O. No. 679(E) dated 13.3.2013 for the purpose of expansion of national
highways expressing intention to acquire land for construction
(widening/six-laning), maintenance, management and operation of N.H.16 (old
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/40423453/ 2
Project Director vs Prakash Kumar Rout on 14 February, 2025
N.H.5) on the stretch of land from 414 km to 419.2km (Bhubaneswar - Kolkata
Section).
ii. The Notification dated 13.3.2013 was also published in widely circulated local
Newspapers namely, ‚the Samaj‛ and ‚the Sambad‛ on 3.4.2013 inviting objections
u/s 3(C) of the NH Act, 1956 within 21 days.
iii. The Claimant herein filed his Objection on 23.4.2014 requesting the authorities to
exempt his plots from acquisition as he was running a cattle-feed plant on the plots
belonging to him that were sought to be acquired. Upon consideration of his prayer,
out of 7 plots of land originally notified to be acquired, 4 plots were exempted from
acquisition on which he was running the said plant. The remaining 3 plots could not
be exempted as they were found to be adjacent to the National Highways and were
found to be inevitable for acquisition for the proposed expansion. The reason they
were excluded was allegedly that it was found that there were no installations of plant
or machinery on the non-exempted plots which would have any adverse effect on his
plant/industry.
iv. Thereafter, on 10.5.2014, vide S.O. No. 729(E), Notification u/s 3(D) of the NH
Act, 1956 was published for final acquisition of land.
Designation: AR-CUM- SR. SECRETARY Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT,
CUTTACK Date: 19-Feb-2025 17:22:45 Thereafter, it is asserted by NHAI that the
land stood vested with the Central Government, free from all encumbrances.
v. In the meanwhile, the Special Land Acquisition Officer - cum -
Competent Authority, NH 5 invited applications for claim petitions which was to be
filed on or before, 24.5.2014. However, the Claimant herein filed his claim petition
only on 19.9.2014. A field inquiry was made through the Amin in the presence of the
Claimant and also the value of the acquired land of the Claimant was assessed by the
Special Land Acquisition Officer - cum - Competent Authority, NH
5. Alongwith the assistance of registered valuers i.e one M/s Harapriya Associates
Private Limited.
vi. After taking all relevant factors into consideration, the compensation amount was assessed and
the amount was duly disbursed u/s 3(G) of the NH Act, 1956, by the Competent Authority of Land
Acquisition, for a total amount of Rs.1,39,20.236/- which included Land Value, Structure Value,
Solatium @30%, Addl. Market Value (Interest@12%) and Ex-gratia amount, as per law. The same
was paid to the Claimant on 6.5.2015.
vii. Being aggrieved by the compensation determined/awarded, the Claimant filed a representation
before the Collector, Cuttack for re- determination of the compensation amount.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/40423453/ 3
Project Director vs Prakash Kumar Rout on 14 February, 2025
viii. The Claimant also approached this Court in W.P.(C) No. 15266 of 2015 with the prayer to direct
the Collector, Cuttack to consider his representation as an application u/s 3(G)(5) of the NH Act,
1956. Further, a request was made to accord permission to the Claimant to Designation: AR-CUM-
SR. SECRETARY Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date: 19-Feb-2025 17:22:45 file an
Application before the Collector for re-measurement of the structure existing on the acquired area.
This Court vide order dated 17.11.2015, was pleased to direct for disposal of the Claimant's
representation in accordance with law.
ix. Therefore, ARB Misc. Case No. 1 of 2016 was instituted by the Claimant before the Ld. Collector
& District Magistrate Cum Sole Arbitrator.
x. An enquiry was conducted as per the directions of Ld. Arbitrator for joint re-measurement /
reassessment of structure and Industrial Unit under Land Acquisition on the Plot Nos.421 /423
/424 of Mouza- Karapari in the presence of both the parties, GM DIC and Executive Engineer.
xi. On 25.1.2017, the Ld. Arbitrator also ordered the Executive Engineer, NH Division to convene a
meeting, coordinating with all officers and conduct a thorough inquiry after which a joint inquiry
report was directed to be submitted. The joint inspection report was submitted on 24.8.2017.
xii. The Ld. Arbitrator in ARB Misc. Case No. 1 of 2016 vide award dated 22.5.2019 was pleased to
enhance the compensation to Rs.23,92,20,307/- with interest.
xiii. The NHAI challenged the award dated 22.5.2019 before the Ld. District Judge, Cuttack in ARBP
15 of 2019 and the Claimant challenged the award dated 22.5.2019 before the Ld. District Judge,
Cuttack in ARBP 16 of 2019. The impugned award was confirmed by the Ld. District Judge vide
common judgment dated 23.2.2024. This Designation: AR-CUM- SR. SECRETARY Location:
ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date: 19-Feb-2025 17:22:45 judgment confirming the award is
challenged herein by both the parties.
3. Now that the facts leading up to the instant Appeals have been laid down, this Court shall
endeavour to summarise the contentions of the Parties and the broad grounds that have been raised
to seek the exercise of this Court's limited jurisdiction available under S. 37 of the A&C Act. II.
CLAIMANT'S SUBMISSIONS:
4. The Ld. Counsel for the Claimant assails the judgment of the Ld. District Judge mainly on the
ground that the Ld. District Judge has failed to note that the Ld. Arbitrator has not correctly
calculated the compensation due to the Claimant and erroneously rejected a part of the claim of the
Claimant. According to the Ld. Counsel for the Claimant, the Ld. Arbitrator ought to have passed an
award of Rs.90,79,63,700/- towards additional compensation but has wrongly directed NHAI to
only pay additional compensation of Rs. 23,92,20,307/- and, therefore, the award is bad in law and
liable to be set aside.
III. NHAI's SUBMISSIONS:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/40423453/ 4
Project Director vs Prakash Kumar Rout on 14 February, 2025
5. Per contra, Ld. Counsel for the NHAI submits that the arbitral award passed by the Ld. Collector
and Arbitrator is against the evidence on record and ought to be set aside in its entirety. The Ld.
Counsel strenuously argued that the land of the Claimant was ‚Gharabari‛ kisam of land. However,
the Ld. Arbitrator has wrongly awarded additional compensation upon erroneously holding that
there was industry/factory over the acquired land. The Ld. Counsel submits that Designation:
AR-CUM- SR. SECRETARY Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date: 19-Feb-2025
17:22:45 as the Ld. Arbitrator has passed an award without properly applying its mind, the same
ought to shock the conscience of the court apart from being perverse and unsustainable in law.
IV. ISSUE FOR CONSIDERATION
6. Having heard the parties and perused the materials available on record, this court here has
identified the following solitary issue to be determined:
A. Whether the order of the Ld. District Judge warrants interference keeping in mind
the limitations of this court's powers under Section 37 of the A&C Act?
V. ISSUE A: WHETHER THE ORDER OF THE LD. DISTRICT JUDGE WARRANTS
ANY INTERFERENCE KEEPING IN MIND THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS COURT'S
POWERS UNDER SECTION 37 OF THE A&C ACT?
7. This Court has given its thoughtful consideration to the submissions advanced by the learned
counsel for the parties at the bar and I have also perused the relevant record of the case.
8. First things first, it would be apposite to refer to the provisions of Section 34 & 37 of the Act,
which provisions read as under:
‚34. Application for setting aside arbitral award. -(1) Recourse to a Court against an
arbitral award may be made only by an application for setting aside such award in
accordance with subsection (2) and sub-section (3).
(2) An arbitral award may be set aside by the Court only if-
Designation: AR-CUM- SR. SECRETARY Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date:
19-Feb-2025 17:22:45
(a) the party making the application establishes on the basis of the record of the arbitral tribunal
that-
(i) a party was under some incapacity; or
(ii) the arbitration agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it or,
failing any indication thereon, under the law for the time being in force; or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/40423453/ 5
Project Director vs Prakash Kumar Rout on 14 February, 2025
(iii) the party making the application was not given proper notice of the appointment of an
arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or was otherwise unable to present his case; or
(iv) the arbitral award deals with a dispute not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the
submission to arbitration, or it contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to
arbitration:
Provided that, if the decisions on matters submitted to arbitration can be separated
from those not so submitted, only that part of the arbitral award which contains
decisions on matters not submitted to arbitration may be set aside; or (v.) the
composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance
with the agreement of the parties, unless such agreement was in conflict with a
provision of this Part from which the parties cannot derogate, or, failing such
agreement, was not in accordance with this Part; or
(b) the Court finds that--
(i) the subject-matter of the dispute is not capable of settlement by arbitration under
the law for the time being in force, or
(ii) the arbitral award is in conflict with the public policy of India.
Designation: AR-CUM- SR. SECRETARY Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date:
19-Feb-2025 17:22:45 Explanation 1.--For the avoidance of any doubt, it is clarified that an award is
in conflict with the public policy of India, only if,-
(i) the making of the award was induced or affected by fraud or corruption or was in violation of
Section 75 or Section 81; or
(ii) it is in contravention with the fundamental policy of Indian law; or
(iii) it is in conflict with the most basic notions of morality or justice.
Explanation 2.--For the avoidance of doubt, the test as to whether there is a contravention with the
fundamental policy of Indian law shall not entail a review on the merits of the dispute.
(2-A) An arbitral award arising out of arbitrations other than international commercial arbitrations,
may also be set aside by the court, if the court finds that the award is vitiated by patent illegality
appearing on the face of the award:
Provided that an award shall not be set aside merely on the ground of an erroneous
application of the law or by reappreciation of evidence.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/40423453/ 6
Project Director vs Prakash Kumar Rout on 14 February, 2025
(3) An application for setting aside may not be made after three months have elapsed
from the date on which the party making that application had received the arbitral
award or, if a request had been made under Section 33, from the date on which that
request had been disposed of by the arbitral tribunal:
Provided that if the Court is satisfied that the applicant was prevented by sufficient
cause from making the application within the said period of three months it may
entertain the application within a further period of thirty days, but not thereafter.
(4) On receipt of an application under sub-section (1), the Court may, where it is
appropriate and it is so requested by a Designation: AR-CUM- SR. SECRETARY
Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date: 19-Feb-2025 17:22:45 party,
adjourn the proceedings for a period of time determined by it in order to give the
arbitral tribunal an opportunity to resume the arbitral proceedings or to take such
other action as in the opinion of arbitral tribunal will eliminate the grounds for
setting aside the arbitral award.
37. Appealable orders.--(1) (Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being
in force, an appeal) shall lie from the following orders (and from no others) to the court authorised
by law to hear appeals from original decrees of the Court passing the order, namely:--
((a) refusing to refer the parties to arbitration under Section 8;
(b) granting or refusing to grant any measure under Section 9;
(c) setting aside or refusing to set aside an arbitral award under Section 34.) (2) An
appeal shall also lie to a court from an order of the arbitral tribunal--
(a) accepting the plea referred to in sub-section (2) or sub-
section(3) of Section 16; or
(b) granting or refusing to grant an interim measure under Section17.
(3) No second appeal shall lie from an order passed in appeal under this section, but nothing in this
section shall affect or take away any right to appeal to the Supreme Court.‛
9. On a careful perusal of Section 34 of the Act, it is clear that an arbitral award can only be set aside
by moving an application on grounds mentioned under sub-section (2) and sub-section (3) of
Section 34 of the Act. An award can be interfered with, where it is in conflict with the public policy of
India, i.e., if the award is induced or affected by fraud or Designation: AR-CUM- SR. SECRETARY
Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date: 19-Feb-2025 17:22:45 corruption or is in
contravention of the fundamental policy of Indian law, or if it is in conflict with basic notions of
morality and justice.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/40423453/ 7
Project Director vs Prakash Kumar Rout on 14 February, 2025
10. A plain reading of Section 34 reveals that the scope of interference by the Court with the arbitral
award under Section 34 is very limited, and the Court is not supposed to travel beyond the aforesaid
scope to determine whether the award is good or bad. Even an award that may not be reasonable or
is non-speaking to some extent cannot ordinarily be interfered with by the Courts.
11.It is also a well settled proposition in law that the jurisdiction of the Court under Section 34 of the
Act is neither in the nature of an appellate remedy or akin to the power of revision. It is also well
ordained in law that an award cannot be challenged on merits except on the limited grounds that
have been spelt out in sub-sections (2), (2-A) and (3) of Section 34 of the Act, by way of filing an
appropriate application.
12.In the instant case, there is no allegation that the making of the award was induced or affected by
fraud or corruption, or was in violation of Section 75 or Section 81. Therefore, we shall confine our
exercise in assessing as to whether the arbitral award is in contravention with the fundamental
policy of Indian law, and/or whether it conflicts with the most basic notions of morality or justice.
Additionally, in the light of the provisions of sub-section (2-A) of Section 34, this Court shall
examine whether there is any patent illegality on the face of the award.
13.Before undertaking the aforesaid exercise, it would be apposite to consider as to how the
expressions (a) ‚in contravention with the Designation: AR-CUM- SR. SECRETARY Location:
ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date: 19-Feb-2025 17:22:45 fundamental policy of Indian law‛;
(b) ‚in conflict with the most basic notions of morality or justice‛; and (c) ‚patent illegality‛ have
been construed.
(a) In contravention with the fundamental policy of Indian law
14.Till the Amendment, 2015 the expression ‚in contravention with the fundamental policy of Indian
law‛ was not found in the 1996 Act. Yet, in Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. v. General Electric Co.1, in the
context of enforcement of a foreign award, while construing the phrase ‚contrary to the public
policy‛, this Court held that for a foreign award to be contrary to public policy mere contravention
of law would not be enough rather it should be contrary to: (a) the fundamental policy of Indian law;
and/or (b) the interest of India; and/or (c) justice or morality.
15.In the judicial pronouncements that followed Renusagar (supra), the domain of what could be
considered contrary to the 'public policy of India'/'fundamental policy of Indian law' expanded,
resulting in much greater interference with arbitral awards than what the lawmakers intended. This
led to the Amendment2015 to the 1996 Act.
16.In Ssangyong Engineering & Construction Co. Ltd. v. NHAI2, this Court dealt with the effect of
the Amendment, 2015. While doing so, it took note of a supplementary report of February 2015 of
the Law Commission of India made in the context of the proposed 2015 amendments. The said
supplementary report has been extracted in (1984) 4 SCC 679 (2019) 15 SCC 131 Designation:
AR-CUM- SR. SECRETARY Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date: 19-Feb-2025
17:22:45 paragraph 30 of that judgment. The key features of it are summarized below:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/40423453/ 8
Project Director vs Prakash Kumar Rout on 14 February, 2025
‚(a) Mere violation of law of India would not be a violation of public policy in cases of
international commercial arbitrations held in India.
(b) The proposed 2015 amendments in 1996 Act (i.e., in Sections 34(2)(b)(ii) and
48(2)(b) including insertion of sub-
section (2-A) in Section 34) were on the assumption that the terms, such as, ‚fundamental policy of
Indian law‛ or conflict with ‚most basic notions of morality or justice‛ would not be widely
construed.
(c) The power to review an award on merits is contrary to the object of the Act and international
practice.
(d) The judgment in ONGC v. Western Geco International Ltd.3would expand the court's power,
contrary to international practice. Hence, a clarification needs to be incorporated to ensure that the
term 'fundamental policy of Indian law' is narrowly construed. The applicability of Wednesbury
principles to public policy will open the floodgates. Hence, Explanation 2 to Section 34(2)(b)(ii) has
been proposed.‛
17.After taking note of the supplementary report, the statement of objects and reasons of the
Amendment Act, 2015, and the amended provisions of Sections 28, 34 and 48, the Apex Court held
in Ssangyong (supra):
‚34. What is clear, therefore, is that the expression public policy of India, whether
contained in section 34 or in section 48, would now mean the fundamental policy of
Indian law as explained in paras 18 and 27 of Associate Builders i.e. the fundamental
policy of Indian law would be relegated to Renusagar's understanding of this
expression. This would (2014) 9 SCC 263 Designation: AR-CUM- SR. SECRETARY
Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date: 19-Feb-2025 17:22:45 necessarily
mean that Western Geco expansion has been done away with. In short, Western
Geco, as explained in Paras 28 and 29 of Associate Builders, would no longer obtain,
as under
the guise of interfering with an award on the ground that the arbitrator has not
adopted a judicial approach the court's intervention would be on the merits of the
award, which cannot be permitted post amendment. However, in so far as principles
of natural justice are concerned, as contained in sections 18 and 34(2)(a)(iii) of the
1996 Act, these continue to be the grounds of challenge of an award, as is contained
in para 30 of Associate Builders.
35.***** 36******
37. In so far as domestic awards made in India are concerned, an additional ground is
now available under sub-section (2-A), added by the Amendment Act, 2015 to section
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/40423453/ 9
Project Director vs Prakash Kumar Rout on 14 February, 2025
34. Here, there must be patent illegality appearing on the face of the award, which
refers to such illegality as goes to the root of the matter, but which does not amount
to mere erroneous application of the law. In short, what is not subsumed within the
fundamental policy of Indian law, namely, the contravention of a statute not linked to
public policy or public interest, cannot be brought in by the back door when it comes
to setting aside an award on the ground of patent illegality.
38. Secondly, it is also made clear that reappreciation of evidence, which is what an
appellate court is permitted to do, cannot be permitted under the ground of patent
illegality appearing on the face of the award.
39. To elucidate, para 42.1 of Associate Builders, namely, a mere contravention of the
substantive law of India, by itself, is no longer a ground available to set aside an
arbitral award.
Para 42.2 of Associate Builders, however, would remain, for if an arbitrator gives no reasons for an
award and contravenes section 31(3) of the 1996 Act, that would certainly amount to a patent
illegality on the face of the award.
Designation: AR-CUM- SR. SECRETARY Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date:
19-Feb-2025 17:22:45
40. The change made in Section 28(3) by the Amendment Act really follows what is stated in paras
42.3 to 45 in Associate Builders, namely, that the construction of the terms of a contract is primarily
for an arbitrator to decide, unless the arbitrator construes the contract in a manner that no fair
minded or reasonable person would; in short, that the arbitrator's view is not even a possible view to
take. Also, if the arbitrator wanders outside the contract and deals with the matters not allotted to
him, he commits an error of jurisdiction. This ground of challenge will now fall within the new
ground added under Section 34 (2-A).
41. What is important to note is that a decision which is perverse, as understood in paras 31 and 32
of Associate Builders, while no longer being a ground for challenge under ‚public policy of India‛,
would certainly amount to a patent illegality appearing on the face of the award. Thus, a finding
based on no evidence at all or an award which ignores vital evidence in arriving at its decision would
be perverse and liable to be set aside on the ground of patent illegality. Additionally, a finding based
on documents taken behind the back of the parties by the arbitrator would also qualify as a decision
based on no evidence inasmuch as such decision is not based on evidence led by the parties, and
therefore, would also have to be characterized as perverse.
********* ******* *******
69. We therefore hold, following the aforesaid authorities, that in the guise of misinterpretation of
the contract, and consequent errors of jurisdiction, it is not possible to state that the arbitral award
would be beyond the scope of submission to arbitration if otherwise the aforesaid misinterpretation
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/40423453/ 10
Project Director vs Prakash Kumar Rout on 14 February, 2025
[which would include going beyond the terms of the contract], could be said to have been fairly
comprehended as disputes within the arbitration agreement or which were referred to the decision
of the arbitrators as understood by the authorities above. If an arbitrator is alleged to have
wandered outside the contract and dealt with matters not allotted to him, this would Designation:
AR-CUM- SR. SECRETARY Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date: 19-Feb-2025
17:22:45 be a jurisdictional error which could be corrected on the ground of patent illegality, which,
as we have seen, would not apply to international commercial arbitrations that are decided under
Part II of the 1996 Act. To bring in by the back door grounds relatable to Section 28 (3) of the 1996
Act to be matters beyond the scope of submission to arbitration under section 34(2)(a)(iv) would
not be permissible as this ground must be construed narrowly and so construed, must refer only to
matters which are beyond the arbitration agreement or beyond the reference to the arbitral
tribunal.‛
18.The legal position which emerges from the aforesaid discussion is that after the '2015
amendments' in Section 34 (2)(b)(ii) and Section 48(2)(b) of the 1996 Act, the phrase ‚in conflict
with the public policy of India‛ must be accorded a restricted meaning in terms of Explanation 1.
The expression ‚in contravention with the fundamental policy of Indian law‛ by use of the word
'fundamental' before the phrase 'policy of Indian law' makes the expression narrower in its
application than the phrase ‚in contravention with the policy of Indian law‛, which means mere
contravention of law is not enough to make an award vulnerable.
19.In order to bring the contravention within the fold of fundamental policy of Indian law, the award
must contravene all or any of such fundamental principles that provide a basis for administration of
justice and enforcement of law in this country. Without intending to exhaustively enumerate
instances of such contravention, by way of illustration, it could be said that (a) violation of the
principles of natural justice; (b) disregarding orders of superior courts in India or the binding effect
of the judgment of a superior court; and (c) violating law of India Designation: AR-CUM- SR.
SECRETARY Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date: 19-Feb-2025 17:22:45 linked to
public good or public interest, are considered contravention of the fundamental policy of Indian law.
However, while assessing whether there has been a contravention of the fundamental policy of
Indian law, the extent of judicial scrutiny must not exceed the limit as set out in Explanation 2 to
Section 34(2)(b)(ii).
(b) Most basic notions of morality and justice
20.In Renusagar (supra) the Supreme Court held that an arbitral award is in conflict with the public
policy of India if it is, inter alia, contrary to ‚justice and morality‛. Explanation 1, inserted by 2015
Amendment, makes it clear that an award is in conflict with the public policy of India, inter alia, if it
conflicts with the 'most basic notions of morality or justice'.
21.Justice is the virtue by which the society/court/tribunal gives a man his due, opposed to injury or
wrong. Justice is an act of rendering what is right and equitable towards one who has suffered a
wrong. Therefore, while tempering justice with mercy, the court must be very conscious, that it has
to do justice in exact conformity with some obligatory law, for the reason that human actions are

Project Director vs Prakash Kumar Rout on 14 February, 2025
found to be just or unjust on the basis of whether the same are in conformity with, or in opposition
to, the law. Therefore, in 'judicial sense', justice is nothing more nor less than exact conformity to
some obligatory law; and all human actions are either just or unjust as they are in conformity with,
or in opposition to, the law.

22.But, importantly, the term 'legal justice' is not used in Explanation 1, therefore simple conformity
or non-conformity with the law is not the test to determine whether an award is in conflict with the
public policy of India in terms of Explanation 1. The test is that it must conflict with the most basic
notions of justice. For lack of any objective criteria, it is difficult to enumerate the 'most basic
notions of justice'. More so, justice to one may be injustice to another. This difficulty has been
acknowledged by many renowned jurists, as is reflected in the observations of this Court in Delhi
Administration v. Gurdip Singh Uban4 extracted below:
‚23. The words 'justice' and 'injustice', in our view, are sometimes loosely used and
have different meanings to different persons particularly to those arrayed on opposite
sides. One man's justice is another's injustice [Raplph Waldo Emerson : Essays
(1803-82), First Series, 1841, ‚Circles]. Justice Cardozo said:‚The web is entangled
and obscure, shot through with a multitude of shades and colors, the skeins irregular
and broken. Many hues that seem to be simple, are found, when analyzed, to be a
complex and uncertain blend. Justice itself, which we are wont to appeal to what as a
test as well as an ideal, may mean different things to different minds and at different
times. Attempts to objectify its standards or even to describe them have never wholly
succeeded (Selected Writings of Cardozo, pp 223-224, Falcon Publications, 1947).‛
(2000) 7 SCC 296 Designation: AR-CUM- SR. SECRETARY Location: ORISSA HIGH
COURT, CUTTACK Date: 19-Feb-2025 17:22:45
23.In Associate Builders v. D.D.A5, while the Supreme Court was dealing with the concept ‚public
policy of India‛, in the context of a Section 34 challenge prior to 2015 amendment, it was held that
an award can be said to be against justice only when it shocks the conscience of the court. The Apex
Court illustrated by stating that where an arbitral award, without recording reasons, awards an
amount much more than what the claim is restricted to, it would certainly shock the conscience of
the court and render the award vulnerable and liable to be set aside on the ground that it is contrary
to justice.
24.In Ssyangyong (supra), which dealt with post 2015 amendment scenario, it was observed that an
argument to set aside an award on the ground of being in conflict with 'most basic notions of justice',
can be raised only in very exceptional circumstances, that is, when the conscience of the court is
shocked by infraction of some fundamental principle of justice. Notably, in that case the majority
award created a new contract for the parties by applying a unilateral circular, and by substituting a
workable formula under the agreement by another, dehors the agreement. Thus, in the view of the
Supreme Court, breached the fundamental principles of justice, namely, that a unilateral addition or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/40423453/ 12
Project Director vs Prakash Kumar Rout on 14 February, 2025
alteration of a contract can never be foisted upon an unwilling party, nor can a party to the
agreement be liable to perform a bargain not entered with the other party. However, a note of
caution was expressed in the judgment by observing that this ground is (2015) 3 SCC 49
Designation: AR-CUM- SR. SECRETARY Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date:
19-Feb-2025 17:22:45 available only in very exceptional circumstances and under no circumstance
can any court interfere with an arbitral award on the ground that justice has not been done in the
opinion of the court because that would be an entry into the merits of the dispute.
25.In the light of the discussion above, in Court's view, when it is talked about justice being done, it
is about rendering, in accordance with law, what is right and equitable to one who has suffered a
wrong. A trained judicial mind may dispense justice in a manner different from what a person of
ordinary prudence would do. This is so, because a trained judicial mind is likely to figure out even
minor infractions of law/norms which may escape the attention of a person with ordinary prudence.
Therefore, the placement of words ‚most basic notions‛ before ‚of justice‛ in Explanation 1 has its
significance. Notably, at the time when the 2015 Amendment was brought, the existing law with
regard to grounds for setting aside an arbitral award, as interpreted by this Court, was that an
arbitral award would be in conflict with public policy of India, if it is contrary to : (a) the
fundamental policy of Indian law; (b) the interest of India; (c) justice or morality; and/or is (d)
patently illegal. As we have already noticed, the object of inserting Explanations 1 and 2 in place of
earlier explanation to Section 34(2)(b)(ii) was to limit the scope of interference with an arbitral
award, therefore the amendment consciously qualified the term 'justice' with 'most basic notions' of
it. In such circumstances, giving a broad dimension to this categorywould be deviating from the
legislative intent. In my view, therefore, considering Designation: AR-CUM- SR. SECRETARY
Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date: 19-Feb-2025 17:22:45 that the concept of justice
is open- textured, and notions of justice could evolve with changing needs of the society, it would
not be prudent to cull out ‚the most basic notions of justice‛. Suffice it to observe, they ought to be
such elementary principles of justice that their violation could be figured out by a prudent member
of the public who may, or may not, be judicially trained, which means, that their violation would
shock the conscience of a legally trained mind. In other words, this ground would be available to set
aside an arbitral award, if the award conflicts with such elementary/fundamental principles of
justice that it shocks the conscience of the Court.
26.The other ground is that of morality. On the question of morality, in Associate Builders (supra),
the Supreme Court, after referring to the provisions of Section 23 of the Contract Act, 1872; and
Indian Contract Act by Pollock and Mulla, held that judicial precedents have confined morality to
sexual morality. And if 'morality' were to go beyond sexual morality, it would cover such agreements
as are not illegal but would not be enforced given the prevailing mores of the day. The court also
clarified that interference on this ground would be only if something shocks the court's conscience.
(c) Patent Illegality
27.Sub-section (2-A) of Section 34 of the 1996 Act, which was inserted by 2015 Amendment,
provides that an arbitral award not arising out of international commercial arbitrations, may also be
set aside by the Court, if the Court finds that the award is visited by patent illegality Designation:

Project Director vs Prakash Kumar Rout on 14 February, 2025
AR-CUM- SR. SECRETARY Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date: 19-Feb-2025
17:22:45 appearing on the face of the award. The proviso to subsection (2-A) states that an award
shall not be set aside merely on the ground of an erroneous application of the law or by
reappreciation of evidence. In ONGC Ltd. v. Saw Pipes6while dealing with the phrase 'public policy
of India' as used in Section 34, the Supreme Court took the view that the concept of public policy
connotes some matter which concerns public good and public interest. If the award, on the face of it,
patently violates statutory provisions, it cannot be said to be in public interest. Thus, an award could
also be set aside if it is patently illegal. It was, however, clarified that illegality must go to the root of
the matter and if the illegality is of trivial nature, it cannot be held that award is against public
policy.
28.In Associate Builders (supra), the Supreme Court has held that an award would be patently
illegal, if it is contrary to:
(a) substantive provisions of law of India;
(b) provisions of the 1996 Act; and
(c) terms of the contract.
29.The Supreme Court of India has clarified that if an award is contrary to the substantive
provisions of law of India, in effect, it is in contravention of Section 28(1)(a)51 of the 1996 Act.
Similarly, violating terms of the contract, in effect, is in contravention of Section 28(3) of the 1996
Act. (2003) 5 SCC 705 Designation: AR-CUM- SR. SECRETARY Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT,
CUTTACK Date: 19-Feb-2025 17:22:45
30.In Ssangyong (supra)the Supreme Court specifically dealt with the 2015 Amendment which
inserted sub-section (2-A) in Section 34 of the 1996 Act. It was held that ‚patent illegality appearing
on the face of the award‛ refers to such illegality as goes to the root of matter, but which does not
amount to mere erroneous application of law. It was also clarified that what is not subsumed within
‚the fundamental policy of Indian law‛, namely, the contravention of a statute not linked to 'public
policy' or 'public interest', cannot be brought in by the backdoor when it comes to setting aside an
award on the ground of patent illegality. Further, it was observed, re-appreciation of evidence is not
permissible under this category of challenge to an arbitral award.
(d) Perversity as a ground of challenge
31.Perversity as a ground for setting aside an arbitral award was recognized in Western Geco
(supra). It was observed therein by the Supreme Court that an arbitral decision must not be perverse
or so irrational that no reasonable person would have arrived at the same. It was observed that if an
award is perverse, it would be against the public policy of India.
32.In Associate Builders (supra) certain tests were laid down to determine whether a decision of an
arbitral tribunal could be considered perverse. In this context, it was observed that where : (i) a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/40423453/ 14
Project Director vs Prakash Kumar Rout on 14 February, 2025
finding is based on no evidence; or (ii) an arbitral tribunal takes into account something irrelevant
to the decision which it arrives at; or (iii) ignores vital evidence in arriving at its decision, such
decision would necessarily be Designation: AR-CUM- SR. SECRETARY Location: ORISSA HIGH
COURT, CUTTACK Date: 19-Feb-2025 17:22:45 perverse. However, by way of a note of caution, it
was observed that when a court applies these tests, it does not act as a court of appeal and,
consequently, errors of fact cannot be corrected. It was held that a possible view by the arbitrator on
facts has necessarily to pass muster as the arbitrator is the ultimate master of the quantity and
quality of evidence to be relied upon. It was also observed that an award based on little evidence or
on evidence which does not measure up in quality to a trained legal mind would not be held to be
invalid on that score alone.
33.In Ssangyong (supra), which dealt with the legal position post 2015 amendment in Section 34 of
the 1996 Act, it was observed that a decision which is perverse, while no longer being a ground for
challenge under ‚public policy of India‛, would certainly amount to a patent illegality appearing on
the face of the award. It was pointed out that an award based on no evidence, or which ignores vital
evidence, would be perverse and thus patently illegal. It was also observed that a finding based on
documents taken behind the back of the parties by the arbitrator would also qualify as a decision
based on no evidence in as much as such decision is not based on evidence led by the parties, and
therefore, would also have to be characterized as perverse.
34.The tests laid down in Associate Builders (supra) to determine perversity were followed in
Ssyanyong (supra) and later approved by a Designation: AR-CUM- SR. SECRETARY Location:
ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date: 19-Feb-2025 17:22:45 three-Judge Bench of the Supreme
Court in Patel Engineering Limited v. North Eastern Electric Power Corporation Limited7.
35.In a recent three-Judge Bench decision of the Supreme Court in Delhi Metro Rail Corporation
Ltd. v. Delhi Airport Metro Express Pvt. Ltd.8, the ground of patent illegality/perversity was
delineated in the following terms:
‚40. In essence, the ground of patent illegality is available for setting aside a domestic
award, if the decision of the arbitrator is found to be perverse, or so irrational that no
reasonable person would have arrived at it; or the construction of the contract is such
that no fair or reasonable person would take; Or, that the view of the arbitrator is not
even a possible view. A finding based on no evidence at all or an award which ignores
vital evidence in arriving at its decision would be perverse and liable to be set aside
under the head of patent illegality. An award without reasons would suffer from
patent illegality. The arbitrator commits a patent illegality by deciding a matter not
within its jurisdiction or violating a fundamental principle of natural justice.‛ Scope
of interference with an arbitral award
36.The aforesaid judicial precedents make it clear that while exercising power under Section 34 of
the 1996 Act, the Court does not sit in appeal over the arbitral award. Interference with an arbitral
award is only on limited grounds as set out in Section 34 of the 1996 Act. A possible view by the
arbitrator on facts is to be respected as the arbitrator is the ultimate master of the quantity and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/40423453/ 15
Project Director vs Prakash Kumar Rout on 14 February, 2025
quality of evidence to be relied (2020) 7 SCC 167 2024 INSC 292 Designation: AR-CUM- SR.
SECRETARY Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date: 19-Feb-2025 17:22:45 upon. It is
only when an arbitral award could be categorized as perverse, that on an error of fact an arbitral
award may be set aside. Further, a mere erroneous application of the law or wrong appreciation of
evidence by itself is not a ground to set aside an award as is clear from the provisions of subsection
(2-A) of Section 34 of the 1996 Act.
37.In Dyna Technologies (P) Ltd. v. Crompton Greaves Ltd.9, a three-Judge Bench of the Supreme
Court of India held that Courts need to be cognizant of the fact that arbitral awards are not to be
interfered with in a casual and cavalier manner, unless the court concludes that the perversity of the
award goes to the root of the matter and there is no possibility of an alternative interpretation that
may sustain the arbitral award. It was observed that jurisdiction under Section 34 cannot be equated
with the normal appellate jurisdiction. Rather, the approach ought to be to respect the finality of the
arbitral award as well as party's autonomy to get their dispute adjudicated by an alternative forum
as provided under the law.
38.It is also a settled proposition that errors of fact cannot be corrected by the court while exercising
the jurisdiction under Section 34 of the A&C Act as it does not sit in appeal over the award. In Parsa
Kente Collieries Ltd. v. Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Ltd.10, it was further inter alia held
that a possible view by the Arbitrator on facts has necessarily to pass muster as the Arbitratoris the
ultimate master of the (2019) 20 SCC 1 (2019) 7 SCC 236 Designation: AR-CUM- SR. SECRETARY
Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date: 19-Feb-2025 17:22:45 quantity and quality of
evidence to be relied upon when he delivers his arbitral award. It was further observed that an
award based on little evidence or on evidence which does not measure up in quality to a trained legal
mind would not be held to be invalid on this score. Reliance can also be placed upon NHAI v. ITD
Cementation (India) Ltd.11, and SAIL v. Gupta Brother Steel Tubes Ltd.12. The view was reiterated
in Dyna Technologies (P) Ltd. (supra) wherein it was inter alia held that the courts should not
interfere with an award merely because an alternative view on facts and interpretation of contract
exists. It was reminded that the court should defer to the view taken by the Arbitral Tribunal even if
the reasoning provided in the award is implied unless such an award portrays perversity
unpardonable under Section 34 of the A&C Act. In South East Asia Marine Engg. & Constructions
Ltd. [SEAMAC Limited] v. Oil India Ltd.13 , it was inter alia held that the courts should not interfere
with an award merely because an alternative view on facts and interpretation of the contract exists.
39. This Court may also place further reliance on the Apex Court's judgment in Madnani
Construction Corpn. (P) Ltd. v. Union of India14wherein it was held that:
‚20. It is well settled that the arbitrator is the master of facts. When the arbitrator on
the basis of record and materials which are placed before him by the Railways came
to such specific (2015) 14 SCC 21 (2009) 10 SCC 63 (2020) 5 SCC 164 (2010) 1 SCC

CUTTACK Date: 19-Feb-2025 17:22:45 findings and which have not been stigmatised
as perverse by the High Court, the High Court in reaching its conclusions cannot
ignore those findings. But it appears that in the instant case, the High Court has come
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/40423453/ 16
Project Director vs Prakash Kumar Rout on 14 February, 2025
to the aforesaid finding that the items mentioned above are excepted matters and
non-
arbitrable by completely ignoring the factual finding by the arbitrator and without holding that
those findings are perverse.‛
40. Therefore, to reiterate, the scope of interference in proceedings under section 34 of the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 has been laid down by the courts time and time again, more
recently summarised in the judgment of the Delhi High Court in Indian Railways Catering and
Tourism Corp Ltd. v. Brandavan Foods Products15. The operative portion of which reads as under:

Organisation v. Sumangal Services (P) Ltd. (2004) 9 SCC 619.
43. For the sake of brevity, the principles delineated in the aforesaid cases are
summarised hereinafter.
44. The award can be set aside on the ground of patent illegality if : a) the view taken
by the arbitral tribunal is impossible or such that no reasonable person could arrive
at it; b) if the arbitral tribunal exceeds its jurisdiction by going beyond the contract,
and adjudicating upon issues not referred to it; c) the finding of the arbitral tribunal
is based on no evidence or it ignores material evidence.
Rewriting of contractual terms by the Arbitrator is completely prohibited, and an Award which
suffers from such perversity is liable to be set aside. The illegality must go to the root of the matter
and does not include mere erroneous application of law or a contravention of law which is unrelated
to public policy or public interest. If two views are possible, the Court will not interfere with the view
of the arbitral tribunal if it has taken one of the two views. Reappreciation of evidence is also
impermissible.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/40423453/ 17
Project Director vs Prakash Kumar Rout on 14 February, 2025
45. The award can also be set aside on the ground of it being in contravention with public policy of
India, the scope of which includes : a) fraud or corruption; b) violation of Sections 75 and 81 of the
Act; c) any contravention with the fundamental policy of Indian law;
d) violation of the most basic notions of justice or morality, so as to shock the conscience of the
Court. The Court does not function as a Court of appeal, and errors of fact cannot be corrected. The
arbitrator's findings on facts must be accepted, as the arbitrator is the ultimate master of the
quantity and quality of evidence in making the award.
Designation: AR-CUM- SR. SECRETARY Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date:
19-Feb-2025 17:22:45
46. It is also relevant to note that the Court cannot modify or rewrite the Award, and can only set it
aside, post which the parties can re-initiate arbitration proceedings, if they so choose. However,
partial setting aside is valid and justified, if the part proposed to be annulled is independent and can
be removed without affecting the rest of the award. For this, reliance is placed upon McDermott
International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd., (2006) 11 SCC 181; S.V. Samudram v. State of
Karnataka (2024) 3 SCC 623 and National Highways Authority of India v. TrichyThanjavur
Expressway Ltd. 2023 SCC OnLine Del 5183.‛
41.Moreover, on the aspect of the Ld. Arbitrator being the master of facts, the Supreme Court has
recently in NTPC Ltd. v. Deconar Services (P) Ltd.16, has held as under:
‚12. Further, it is also a settled proposition that where the arbitrator has taken a
possible view, although a different view may be possible on the same evidence, the
court would not interfere with the award. This Court in Arosan Enterprises Ltd. v.
Union of India [Arosan Enterprises Ltd. v. Union of India, (1999) 9 SCC 449], held as
follows : (SCC p. 475, paras 36-37) ‚36. Be it noted that by reason of a long catena of
cases, it is now a well-settled principle of law that reappraisal of evidence by the court
is not permissible and as a matter of fact exercise of power by the court to reappraise
the evidence is unknown to proceedings under Section 30 of the Arbitration Act. In
the event of there being no reasons in the award, question of interference of the court
would not arise at all. In the event, however, there are reasons, the interference
would still be not available within the (2021) 19 SCC 694 Designation: AR-CUM- SR.
SECRETARY Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date: 19-Feb-2025
17:22:45 jurisdiction of the court unless of course, there exist a total perversity in the
award or the judgment is based on a wrong proposition of law. In the event however
two views are possible on a question of law as well, the court would not be justified in
interfering with the award.
37. The common phraseology ‚error apparent on the face of the record does not itself, however,
mean and imply closer scrutiny of the merits of documents and materials on record. The court as a
matter of fact, cannot substitute its evaluation and come to the conclusion that the arbitrator had
acted contrary to the bargain between the parties. If the view of the arbitrator is a possible view the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/40423453/ 18
Project Director vs Prakash Kumar Rout on 14 February, 2025
award or the reasoning contained therein cannot be examined.‛‛
42.It is well recognized in Arbitration jurisprudence that the scope of interference by the Courts in
arbitration proceedings and arbitral awards is narrow. In fact, the Courts ought to be cautious and
circumspect in interfering with any award which is passed by an arbitral tribunal which has been
appointed pursuant to an agreement between the parties to the dispute. The exceptions of the
aforementioned rule finds place in Section 34 and Section 37 of the Act wherein certain instances
have been outlined where the Courts can interfere with any award passed by arbitral tribunals and
set it aside. This court therefore shall also examine the award with the aforesaid restrictive mandate
of law.
43.Furthermore, this Court is cognizant that Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act
which provides a statutory forum for appeal, inter alia, against an order either setting aside or
refusing to set aside an Designation: AR-CUM- SR. SECRETARY Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT,
CUTTACK Date: 19-Feb-2025 17:22:45 arbitral award under Section 34 of the Act. The scope of such
an appeal is inherently limited to the grounds enumerated under Section 34, thereby ensuring that
the appellate process remains confined to the specific parameters established by the statute.
44.In view of the foregoing, this Court shall carefully examine the arguments advanced by the
counsel for the Appellant, wherein it is asserted that the claims upheld by the Arbitrator are
inconsistent with the terms of the contract or that the impugned Award lacks any supporting
material or evidence.
45.Prima facie, a perusal of the impugned judgment and Award unequivocally demonstrates that the
Arbitrator relied upon written submissions, documentary evidence, and the statements of the
parties involved in the transaction to determine and quantify the claims.
46.In his petition, the Claimant has claimed additional compensation of Rs.90,79,63,700/-on
different heads. After considering the evidence adduced by the Claimant and hearing arguments
from both the sides the learned Arbitrator refused to grant additional compensation to the extent as
claimed by the Claimant.However, the learned Arbitrator did award additional compensation on
some statutory grounds, as follows:
i. The Ld. Arbitrator noted that after payment of compensation amount of
Rs.1,39,20,236/- on 6.5.2015, the Claimant was instructed by the Competent
Authority to shift his plant and machinery failing which they will dispossess the
Claimant from the land as per law. Therefore, the Ld. Arbitrator concluded that the
Claimant is entitled to get 100% solatium Designation: AR-CUM- SR. SECRETARY
Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date: 19-Feb-2025 17:22:45 instead of
30% which comes to Rs. 1,97,89,793/-. Out of the 100% solatium the Petitioner has
already been paid Rs.1,39,20,236/- and he is entitled for enhanced compensation of
Rs.58,69,557/-along with an interest of 9% per annum u/s3-H (5) of the N.H.Act,
1956 on this head.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/40423453/ 19
Project Director vs Prakash Kumar Rout on 14 February, 2025
ii. In addition to that the Ld. Arbitrator calculated the additional compensation with regard to the
developmental cost @ 30% i.e.Rs.3,87,450/-, and denied the claim advanced by the Claimant of
Rs.1,49,76,000/- on this head.
iii. Besides that the Ld. Arbitrator opined that the Claimant is entitled to get compensation for the
damage sustained for his dispossession and consequential effect resulted thereof. On this head, the
Ld. Arbitrator awarded compensation with regard to the industrial unit for civil cost, cost of plant
and machinery and other charges, installation of electrical fittings and other items which combined
comes to Rs.22,74,73,300/-. iv. Furthermore, it appears that the Ld. Arbitrator refused to pay any
additional compensation on the head "mental agony", but has awarded Rs.94.9 lakhs towards the
consequential loss incurred by the Claimant from the date of acquisition till the shifting and
construction of new factory taking into the profit made by the Claimant during the financial year
2016-17 as against the claim of Rs.3,11,00,000/- under column-F-1 of the petition.
Designation: AR-CUM- SR. SECRETARY Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date:
19-Feb-2025 17:22:45 v. Finally in toto the Ld. Arbitrator awarded Rs. 23,92,20,307/-
along with interest u/s 3-H(5) at 9% per annum with effect from 15.1.2015 till the date of deposit of
the additional compensation by the N.H.A.I.
47.But, it is pertinent to note that, the learned Arbitrator has not accepted the claim of the claimant
that the valuation of the land acquired should have been assessed taking the same as 'industrial'
kisam land and not as 'Gharabari' kisam land. The Ld. Arbitrator found nothing wrong in awarding
the compensation four times higher than the bench mark value of mouza in question and the claim
to enhance the compensation was rejected with the finding that the approach of the Competent
Authority was in accordance with law. The claim advanced by the Claimant to award the cost of
registration @ 7% of the land cost,consequential loss, shifting cost, mental agony are also not
accepted by the Ld. Arbitrator.So far as the claim towards development cost@30% of land cost
calculated by the claimant at Rs1,49,76,000/- taking the bench mark value of the land at Rs.80
lakhs per acre isconcerned, the Ld. Arbitrator did not accept the same and on its own calculation at
the rate of bench mark value fixed by the Competent Authority awarded additional compensation of
Rs.3,87,450/- which according to it was just and proper.
48.In any arbitration proceeding, the role of the arbitrator is pivotal as the final decision-maker.
This role involves not just interpreting and applying the law, but also determining the facts that
underpin the dispute at hand. The arbitrator's ultimate responsibility is to resolve the Designation:

17:22:45 dispute by making an award that reflects a thorough understanding of the facts, the law,
and the parties' arguments. The process by which the arbitrator evaluates facts is highly
discretionary, and this discretion must pass muster in the sense that it aligns with legal standards
and fundamental principles of fairness.
49.Unlike in a courtroom trial, the arbitrator has a much broader scope of discretion in assessing
facts. Arbitrators are not bound by rigid rules of evidence as would be the case in a civil or common

law court. Their duty is to examine the evidence presented by the parties, evaluate its credibility,
and decide which pieces of evidence should be accepted or rejected. This discretion is not without
limitation. While the arbitrator enjoys wide-ranging authority in fact-finding, it is not an
untrammelled power. For instance, there are fundamental principles of justice, transparency, and
fairness that undergird the arbitration process. The arbitrator's decision must be based on the
evidence presented and should not be arbitrary or capricious. The arbitrator's findings must be
justifiable on the record. In this sense, while the arbitrator is the ultimate master of fact, their
decisions must be reasoned and consistent with the evidence on record.
50.Therefore, the arbitrator's role as the ultimate master of the quantity and quality of evidence is
central to the arbitration process. The principle that a court does not sit in appeal over an
arbitrator's findings of fact is a cornerstone of the arbitration process. This fundamental concept
ensures that the arbitration process remains efficient and final, distinguishing it from the
conventional judicial process. One of the Designation: AR-CUM- SR. SECRETARY Location:
ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date: 19-Feb-2025 17:22:45 primary reasons for this is that
courts are generally not permitted to re- appreciate or re-evaluate the evidence presented to the
arbitrator. The rationale behind this limitation is rooted in the understanding that the arbitrator, as
the chosen adjudicator by the parties, is the ultimate authority on matters of fact and evidence.
51.A perusal of the arbitral award would elucidate that the sole Arbitrator has considered the facts of
the case, the contentions of both the parties and other documentary and oral evidence on record to
take a decision. Now, even if one might feel that the evidence could be clearer and its quality could
be higher to buttress the award, however, the same does not by itself warrant interference by this
Court given the restrictive scope of this Court's powers u/s 37 of the A&C Act. VI. CONCLUSION:
52.In light of the discussion above, keeping the settled principles of law in mind and for the reasons
given above, this Court is of the considered view that judgment dated 23.2.2024 passed by the
learned District Judge, Cuttack in Arbitration Petition Nos.15 and 16 of 2019 arising out of award

53.Consequently, the award dated 22.5.2019 passed by the Ld. Collector & District
Magistrate-cum-Sole Arbitrator in ARB Misc. Case No. 1 of 2016 is confirmed accordingly.
