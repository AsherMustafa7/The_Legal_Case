Heard On : 07-5-2025
Delivered On : 20-5-2025
1. This Petition under Article 226 of Constitution of India has been filed seeking the following relief :
"i) That, the order impugned dated 04.08.2023contained in Annexure -- P/1 issued
by the Respondent no. 1 may kindly be quashed with a further the consequential
order dated 18.08.2023contained in Annexure -- P/2 may also be quashed,in
accordance with rules.
(ii) Cost of the petition be awarded or any other order or direction deemed fit in the
circumstances of the case be issued in the favour of the Petitioner."
2. By this petition, the Petitioner had challenged the posting of respondent no. 6 Dr. Anuj Sharma as
Health Officer on deputation. It was also the case of the petitioner that as many as 61 persons who
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 2
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
are not eligible to be sent on deputation are working in Municipal Corporation, Gwalior on
deputation.
3. While the hearing of the case was going on, it was brought to the notice of this Court, that even
Dr. Dinesh Dixit, who is a veterinary Doctor, has also been posted on deputation on the post of Dy.
Commissioner. As shocking facts were coming on record, therefore, this Court by order dated
16-4-2025, issued notice to all the persons who are working/posted on deputation/transfer on
deputation in Municipal Corporation, Gwalior to show cause as to why their deputation may not be
cancelled and why they may not repatriated to their original department.
4. The order dated 16-4-2025 was challenged by State of M.P, Principal Secretary Department of
Veterinary Services and Animal Husbandry, Commissioner, Municipal Corporation and Director
Veterinary Services and Animal Husbandryby filing W.A. No. 1324 of 2025 and by Municipal
Corporation Gwalior by W.A. No. 1329 of 2025.
5. The aforesaid W.A.s were dismissed by Division Bench of this Court by order dated 1-5-2025
which reads as under :
"Heard on admission.
2. The instant appeal is preferred by appellants being crestfallen vide interim order
dated 16/04/2025 passed in WP No. 9096/2024 whereby during the course of
hearing, learned writ Court issued notice to 61 persons who were allegedly working in
Municipal Corporation, Gwalior on deputation.
3. Precisely stated facts of the case are that respondent No.1- Dr. Anuradha Gupta
filed a petition i.e. WP No. 9096/2024 for issuance of writ o f quo warranto against
respondent No.3- Dr. Anuj Sharma on the ground that respondent No.3 is Veterinary
Surgeon and he can not be appointed on the post of Assistant Sanitary Officer/Health
Officer. He does not bear qualification of MBBS, as required in the Madhya Pradesh
Municipal Corporation (Appointment and Condition of Service of Officers and
Servants) Rules, 2000.
4. Respondents of writ petition (State of M.P., Municipal Corporation, Gwalior and
private respondent) filed their respective reply and contested the case. It was the case
of State Government that Rules have been amended and thereafter, Sanitary
Officer/Health Officer/ Veterinary Officer are clubbed in a manner whereby in a city
with more than five lacs population over population of every two Lacs, one Health
Officer can be appointed. In Municipal Corporation, where population exceeds Five
Lacs, two Veterinary Doctors can be appointed. A document Annexure P-7 was filed
in this regard. Therefore, sheet anchor of case of the State of M.P. is that the
amendment was caused in the Rules and amalgamation of cadre of Sanitary
Officer/Health Officer/Veterinary Doctor is carried out. Therefore, order of
deputation of respondent No.3 herein (respondent No.6 in writ petition) was just and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 3
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
proper.
5. During course of arguments, it was submitted by the counsel for appellants-State/
counsel for State in WA No. 1329/2025 and private respondents, especially
respondent No.3 in present writ appeal that it is a motivated petition. Now, private
respondents have already been removed from Municipal Corporation, Gwalior and
posted at Sagar, therefore, very purpose of filing of quo warranto is over. It is further
informed that another similarly placed employee, namely, Dr. Upendra Yadav, was
also Veterinary doctor but appointed as Assistant Sanitary Officer (Erstwhile Health
officer) and very cleverly his appointment has not been challenged in writ petition,
but appointment of only respondent No.3-Dr. Anuj Sharma is being challenged. This
itself indicates the motive.
6. Learned counsel for State also raised point that Dr. Anuradha Gupta shall have to
amend the pleadings in respect of 61 employees who have been put to notice by
learned writ Court and apprehension is raised by appellants that petition may be
withdrawn by petitioner midway because purpose of filing the motivated petition is
over.
7. Learned counsel for respondent No.1 countered the arguments and specifically
submits that petition shall not be withdrawn and petitioner therein shall amend the
pleadings in respect of Dr. Upendra Yadav also and against those 61
officers/employees who are being put to notice by learned Writ Court and they have
to appear before the learned Writ Court on the next date of hearing. Petitioner
therein would contest the case in respect of these 61 officers also. Petitioner would
show her bonafides.
8. At this stage, when this Court referred the impugned order which is interim in
nature and writ petition is still pending, then, counsel for appellants/State fairly
submits that if these aspects as referred above are considered before the learned Writ
Court, then they be permitted to raise all these grounds before the learned Writ Court
only so that adjudication can be held before learned Writ Court meaningfully and
effectively.
9. Counsel for respondents are in unison in respect of such submissions.
10. Considering the submissions and prayer so made, this writ appeal stand disposed
of raising expectation from all the litigants to complete their pleadings dispelling the
apprehension of rival parties and after completion of pleadings, it is requested to
learned Writ Court that after considering the rival submissions and additional
pleadings, writ petition be heard finally on its own merits.
11. With the aforesaid, instant appeal stands disposed of.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 4
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
6. It is not out of place to mention here that although I.A. No. 4951 of 2025 was filed by the
Petitioner in the light of direction given by Division Bench of this Court, but did not implead Dr.
Upendra Yadav. Although the respondent no. 6 in his return which was filed vide Document No.
4596 of 2025 had claimed that Dr. Upendra Yadav has also been posted as Sanitary Officer and he is
also not having the degree of MBBS, but only the posting of the respondent no. 6 has been
challenged therefore, the petition is a motivated one. However, during the course of arguments, it
was admitted by Shri Pawan Dwivedi, Counsel for respondent no. 6 that Dr. Upendra Yadav has
been appointed and has not been sent on deputation. Thus, it is clear that Dr. Upendra Yadav is the
employee of Municipal Corporation, Gwalior. This Court is dealing with the cases of those
employees who have been sent on deputation or transfer on deputation. In the present case, this
Court has nothing to do with the direct appointment of any person, therefore, did not issue any
notice to Dr. Upendra Yadav. Even the petitioner in her I.A. No. 4951 of 2025 has not impleaded Dr.
Upendra Yadav. Therefore, this Court would not consider the eligibility of Dr. Upendra Yadav to
hold the post on which he has been appointed by the MunicipaL Corporation, Gwalior. Therefore,
the question of eligibility of Dr. Upendra Yadav is left open.
7. There is another important aspect of the matter. On 16-4-2025, it was informed by Shri D.P.
Singh, Counsel for Petitioner, that one Dr. Dinesh Dixit who is a Veterinary Doctor has been sent on
deputation on the post of Dy. Commissioner. Thereafter, Shri D.P. Singh made a statement on
2-5-2025 that by order dated 28-4-2025,Dr. Dinesh Dixit has been repatriated back to his parent
department. However, this Court observed, that "the State Government shall justify its act of
sending Dr. Dinesh Dixit on deputation to Municipal Corporation, Gwalior."
8. As already pointed out, the Division Bench of this Court by order dated 1- 5-2025, had directed
the Petitioner, to implead all 61 employees of Municipal Corporation who are working on
deputation, but still the petitioner did not implead Dr. Dinesh Dixit as respondent.
9. During the course of arguments, it came to light that earlier also, Dr. Dinesh Dixit was repatriated
and the order of repatriation has been challenged by Dr. Dinesh Dixit by filing W.P. No. 7250 of
2024. It is not out of place to mention here that Shri D.P. Singh, Advocate is the Counsel of Dr.
Dinesh Dixit. Although, Shri D.P. Singh had provided the copy of repatriation order dated 28-
4-2025, but did not disclose to the Court, that earlier also, Dr. Dinesh Dixit was repatriated and his
writ petition i.e., W.P. No. 7250 of 2024 is pending and he himself is the Counsel for Dr. Dinesh
Dixit.
10. It is true that originally, the case of Dr, Dinesh Dixit was not involved, therefore, there was no
impediment for Shri D.P. Singh, Advocate to file this petition, but the moment, this Court issued
notice to Dr. Dinesh Dixit, then Shri D.P. Singh, Advocate should have withdrawn himself from this
case as the notice was also issued to Dr. Dinesh Dixit and there would be a conflict of interest of Dr.
Dinesh Dixit. But Shri D.P. Singh, Advocate did not withdraw himself but also did not inform that
he is already the Counsel for Dr. Dinesh Dixit. Further more, in compliance of order dated 1-5-2025,
the petitioner was directed to implead all employees who are on deputation, but still Dr. Dinesh
Dixit was deliberately not impleaded as party. Thus, it is clear that every attempt was made to
protect the interests of Dr. Dinesh Dixit. It is really unfortunate that Shri D.P. Singh, Advocate, on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 5
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
one hand was pleading that Veterinary Doctor Anuj Sharma has no competence/eligibility to hold
the post of Health Officer, and at the same time, by not impleading was protecting the interest of Dr.
Dinesh Dixit, who is working as Deputy Commissioner.
11. However, this Court by order dated 2-5-2025 had specifically held that State Govt. should justify
its "act of sending Dr. Dinesh Dixit on deputation to Municipal Corporation, Gwalior" and notice
was also issued to Dr. Dinesh Dixit by order dated 16-5-20205 and he has also been served with the
notice, but neither engaged any lawyer nor appeared in person therefore, he is declared exparte.
12. Before the considering the individual cases of every noticee who is working on
deputation/transfer on deputation in Municipal Corporation, Gwalior, as well as respondent no. 6,
this Court would like to consider the submissions made by the Counsel for the parties with regard to
authority of the State Govt. to send the employees on deputation or transfer on deputation.
13. This Court on various dates passed the following orders :
"Dated 13-3-2025 By this petition, petitioner has sought a writ in the nature of quo
warranto by challenging the posting of respondent No.6 in Municipal Corporation,
Gwalior as a Health Officer on the ground that respondent No.6 is a veterinary doctor
and he has been asked to work as Health Officer in Municipal Corporation, Gwalior.
In fact State Government by posting respondent No.6 as a Health Officer, Municipal
Corporation, Gwalior has treated the residence of Gwalior as animals who are to be
looked after by the veterinary doctor.
Be that whatever it may be.
Respondent No.5 has filed its return and claimed that since, respondent No.6 has
been posted by State Government, therefore, it has given the NOC.
Respondent No.6 has not filed the return, although, he had filed his Vakalatnama on
03/05/2024. Therefore, it is clear that respondent No.6 is deliberately avoiding the
filing of his Vakalatnama because he may not be in a position to justify his posting
and may not be in a position to counter the arguments of counsel for petitioner that
the residence of Gwalior are being treated as animals. Furthermore, the counsel for
respondent No.6 was granted time on 02/12/2024 and 18/12/2024 to file return, but
the return has not been filed.
In spite of multiple opportunities, even State has not filed the return.
This Court is of considered opinion that prima facie case has been made out by
petitioner for issuance of interim order. Accordingly, it is directed that respondent
No.6 shall immediately stop functioning as Health Officer, Municipal Corporation,
Gwalior.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 6
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
Respondent No.1 to 4 are directed to positively file their return pointing out the
reasons behind posting of respondent No.6 as a Health Officer in Municipal
Corporation, Gwalior.
Since, respondent No.6 was earlier posted in Veterinary Hospital, Sagar and from
there he was transferred as Health Officer, Municipal Corporation, Gwalior,
therefore, it is directed that respondent No.6 shall discharge his duties in Veterinary
Hospital, Sagar irrespective of the fact as to whether there is any vacant post or not ?
If the State Government finds difficult to disburse the salary of respondent No.6 from
Veterinary Hospital, Sagar, then State Government is free to post him in any
Veterinary Hospital of State of M.P. except in District Gwalior.
List on 19/03/2025.
If the return is not filed, then this Court may direct for personal appearance of
respondents No.1 to 4 and 6. Dated : 19-03-2025 It is the case of petitioner that there
is no post like Health Officer in the Municipal Corporation. Earlier the post was
known as Health Officer but now it has been redesignated as Chief Sanitary Officer.
The said post is to be filled up by 100% promotion from the post of Sanitary Officer
and the post of Sanitary Officer is to be filled up by 100% promotion from the post of
Assistant Sanitary Officer. Minimum qualification for the post of Assistant Sanitary
Officer is MBBS. Respondent No.6 is not MBBS and therefore, he was not entitled to
hold the post of Health Officer or in other words Chief Sanitary Officer.
Respondent No.3 has filed return and submitted that vide letter dated 31.05.2023
Urban Administration and Housing Department sought information regarding
vacancy, pay scale and consent of respondent No.3 for deputation of Dr. Anuj Sharma
to the post of Health Officer. Respondent No.3 apart from furnishing the other
information also gave a No Objection Certificate. Accordingly, by order dated
04.08.2023 Dr. Anuj Sharma was deputed to the post of Health Officer in the
department of Urban Administration and Development and by order dated
18.08.2023 he was sent on deputation to the Municipal Corporation, Gwalior on the
post of Health Officer. Thus, it is the stand of respondent No.3 that entire exercise
was done at the behest of Department of Urban Administration and Development.
Respondents No.1 and 2 have filed their return. However, it is made clear that
manner in which return has been filed, is also really shocking. The OIC has signed
general index as OIC of respondents No.1 and 2 whereas cause title of return says
that it is short return on behalf of respondent No.2 i.e. Principal Secretary,
Department of Veterinary Services and respondent No.4 i.e. Director Veterinary
Services and Animal Husbandry. Thereafter, return has been signed by OIC in the
capacity of OIC of respondents No.1 and 2. Affidavit has been filed by Dr. R.K. Tyagi
by claiming himself to be the OIC of the case, but he has not clarified as to whether he
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 7
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
has signed that affidavit in the capacity of OIC on behalf of respondents No.2 and 4
or respondents No.1 and 2.
Be that what ever it may be.
In this return, entire burden has been put on the State. Respondents have filed a copy
of letter dated 02.02.2023 written by Urban Administration and Development
Department which was written to the Principal Secretary, Veterinary Services and
Animal Husbandry asking him to provide certain information for posting of Dr. Anuj
Sharma on deputation. Accordingly, Under Secretary of State of Madhya Pradesh,
Veterinary Services and Animal Husbandry gave his report. Thus, respondents No.2
and 4 have tried to put the entire burden on respondents No.1 and 3. Respondents
No.1 and 3 have not filed their return.
However, one thing is clear that respondent No.6 was posted against a non-existing
post that too when he is not holding the MBBS degree.
Petitioner has filed copy of letter dated 14.05.2020 written by Administrator
Municipal Corporation, Gwalior for repatriation of various officers who were posted
on deputation. From this letter, it appears that as many as 62 officers/employees
have been posted in Municipal Corporation, Gwalior on deputation. The manner in
which respondent No.6 was sent on deputation on nonexisting post, specifically when
he was not holding the minimum qualification also speaks in volumes about manner
of posting certain officers on deputation.
Accordingly, respondent No.5 is directed to file detailed return pointing out the
details of officers who are working on deputation including the period of their
posting. Respondent No.5 shall also point out that how many employees of Municipal
Corporation are actually working in the Municipal Corporation and why the
Municipal Corporation is not taking any steps to make regular appointments. Further
respondent No.5 shall also point out as to why the employees who are on deputation
are not being repatriated.
Counsel for respondents No.1 and 3 is granted last opportunity of two weeks' to file
detailed return and respondents No.1 and 3 is also directed to explain as to what
prompted them to initiate the proceedings for sending respondent No.6 on
deputation to the Municipal Corporation, Gwalior. The entire record be produced on
the next date of hearing.
If the proceedings were initiated on the application of respondent No.6, then copy of
said application shall also be filed alongwith the return. Respondents No.1 to 5 are
also directed to clarify as to how they can post a veterinary doctor against post for
which the minimum qualification is MBBS. Allthough a veterinary doctor was posted
as a Health Officer/Sanitary Officer in the Municipal Corporation, Gwalior, but still
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 8
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
numbers of dog bites were alarming and even small kids have suffered severe dog
bites.
It is submitted by counsel for respondent No.5 as well as respondent No.6 that by
virtue of order dated 13.03.2025, respondent No.6 has been relieved. Under hope and
belief that he shall not be sent on a deputation to any corporation for which he is not
holding the requisite qualification, interim order dated 13.03.2025 shall continue till
final disposal of this case. Dated : 07-04-2025 It appears that respondents have filed
their return, but it appears that they are trying to play jugglery of words with the
Court that shows that intention of respondents is not honest.
This Court had directed on 19/03/2025 that the respondents must file a detailed
return pointing out the details of officers who are working on deputation including
the period of their posting. It appears that respondents are trying to bifurcate the
word "deputation" in various different categories. However, the concern of this Court
is about the total number of employees who were appointed as per provisions of
Section 58 of M.P. Municipal Corporation Act and not with regard to those persons
who successfully got themselves transferred or appointed or absorbed on deputation
in the Municipal Corporation, Gwalior. Whatever category of deputation may be, this
Court would take the said category as a single category i.e. "deputation", therefore,
the Municipal Corporation must give details of employees who were originally
appointed as an employee of Municipal Corporation as per the provisions of Section
58 of M.P. Municipal Corporation Act and not the persons who were originally
appointed in different departments but for any good or bad reason they successfully
got themselves transferred to Municipal Corporation, Gwalior in the name of
deputation (whatsoever category of deputation may be).
Accordingly, counsel for respondents prays for a day's time to prepare a fresh list and
file fresh affidavit to point out the details of only those employees who were originally
appointed as an employee of Municipal Corporation as per provisions of Section 58 of
Municipal Corporation Act.
Respondents No.1 and 3 have maintained beautiful silence. This act of respondents
No.1 and 3 cannot be appreciated. On one hand the city of Gwalior is suffering from
excessive dog bites on account of which small kids of the city are getting badly injured
as well as air of Gwalior city is one of the most polluted air of cities of the country and
the city of Gwalior also could not come nearer to category of clean city, therefore, the
silence maintained by respondents No.1 to 3 is really shocking and disturbing.
Accordingly, respondents No.1 and 3 are also directed to file their response positively
by tomorrow because sufficient time has already been granted to them by order dated
19/03/2025. In case if the response is not filed, then this Court may direct the
personal appearance of respondent No.3 to answer the queries.

Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
List on 09/04/2025.
Dated : 09-04-2025 In compliance of order dated 07.04.2025, Shri Gaurav Mishra,
counsel for municipal corporation has informed the total sanctioned post of each and
every post as per the Madhya Pradesh Municipal Corporation (Appointment and
Conditions of Service of Officers and Servants) Rules, 2000 (in short "Rules, 2000).
The mode of filling up those posts have already been given in the schedule appended
to the Rules. Shri Mishra also pointed out the number of posts which have been
occupied by the employees of the municipal corporation as per the provision of
Section 58 of M.P. Municipal Corporation Act, 1956 (in short "Act, 1956") as well as
number of posts which are lying vacant and also number of persons who are on
deputation. However, it is fairly conceded by Shri Mishra that he has done the
homework by anticipating that this Court might put this question to him with regard
to the minute details, therefore, he has prepared the aforesaid information on his
own with the help of officers but in case if any mistake is found, then he reserves his
right to correct the same. The amount of homework done by Shri Mishra is
appreciated and it is put on record accordingly.
2. Since the information which has been supplied by Shri Mishra during the course of
argument was prepared by him without any order from the court, therefore, right of
Shri Mishra to correct the mistake, if any, is hereby reserved and if the municipal
corporation finds that any of the information verbally supplied to the court requires
modification, then municipal corporation shall have every right to file an application
for correction of today's order with regard to the details of the sanctioned post,
vacant post, post hold by employees appointed as per the provisions of Section 58 of
the Act, 1956 and the number of persons who are on deputation.

4. From the information which has been given by Shri Mishra, it appears that as per
Rules, 2000, certain posts cannot be filled up by deputation. However, in view of the
verbal information given by Shri Mishra, it appears that some of the persons have
been sent on deputation without there being any provision under the Rules, 2000.
Furthermore, from the details of the employees who were appointed under Section
58 (1) of the Act, 1956, it is clear that all the employees are either of Class-
III or Class-IV. All the top officials have been sent on deputation whereas according to the rules,
either those posts are to be filled up by direct recruitment or by promotion and for some of the
posts, 50% of the sanctioned strength can be filled up by deputation but more than what could have
been done by the State are working in the Municipal Corporation, Gwalior. It was also found that
where the sanctioned strength is more than one, only one or two persons are working and the
remaining posts are vacant, meaning thereby that one or two officers are holding the charge of the
entire municipal corporation, whereas, officers / employees were required to be appointed as per
the sanctioned posts.
5. Section 58 of the Act, 1956 reads as under :-
"58. Appointment and condition of Service of Corporation officers and servants.-
(1) Subject to the rules made by the State Government in respect of the Set-up,
Strength, Recruitment, Appointment, Pay-Scales, Allowances and other conditions of
service of officers and servants of the Corporation, the Corporation shall appoint such
officers and servants as may be necessary for the efficient performance of the
functions of the Corporation:
Provided that-
(i) the power of appointing any person on a municipal post which carries a maximum
scale of pay as the State Government may, from time to time, by an order in writing
specify, shall vest in the Mayor-in-Council or the Commissioner;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 12
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
(ii) any appointment made within his power by the Commissioner shall be reported
for information to the Mayor- in-Council;
(iii) every appointment to be made by the Mayor-in-Council shall be subject to the
prior confirmation of the State Government. The decision of the State Government in
this behalf shall be final.
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), in emergent situations,
the Mayor-in-Council may make adhoc appointments for a period not exceeding six
months, with prior permission of the State Government.
(2-a) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1) and (2), the
Mayor-in-Council may, with prior permission of the State Government, appoint on
contract, specialist officers and servants in the field of management, accounts,
information technology, engineering and planning for specified periods and the
manner and terms and conditions of appointment of such specialist officers and
servants on contract shall be such as may be prescribed by the State Government.
(3) The State Government may depute to any post under the corporation carrying
maximum scale of pay as the State Government may, from time to time, by an order
in writing specify such servants of the State Government as it may consider
necessary.
Provided that in case of technical posts, the State Government may depute servants of any Town and
Country Development Authority and Government Undertaking to any Municipal Corporation for a
period of not exceeding one year.
(4) The terms and conditions of deputation of servants of the State Government, Town and Country
Development Authority or GovernmentUndertaking including disciplinary control shall be such as
may be prescribed.
(5) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act or any rules or byelaws made thereunder, the
State Government may, subject to the conditions specified in sub-section (6) transfer on deputation
any officer or servant of a Municipal Corporation to any other Municipal Corporation and it shall
not be necessary for the State Government to consult either the Corporation or the Officer or
Servant concerned before passing an order of transfer on deputation under this sub- section.
(6) The officer or servant transferred under sub-section (5) shall-
(a) have his lien on the post held in the parent Corporation;
(b) not be put to disadvantageous position in respect of pay and allowances which he would have
been entitled to had he continued in the parent Corporation;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 13
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
(c) be entitled to deputation allowances at such rate as the State Government may by general order
specify; and
(d) be governed by such other terms and conditions including disciplinary control as the State
Government may, by general or special order, specify."
6. Section 58 (3) of the Act, 1956 empowers the State Government to depute to any post under the
corporation carrying maximum scale of pay by order in writing specifying such servants of the State
as it may consider necessary. Accordingly, State Government is directed to clarify as to whether it
can bypass the provisions of Rules, 2000 to send the employees on deputation for which there is no
provision for filling up the post by deputation. The State Government shall also clarify that why the
persons were sent on deputation and why Municipal Corporation, Gwalior was not directed to fill up
the post by direct recruitment or by promotion as per the provisions of Rules, 2000.
7. By referring to letter dated 11.01.2022, it was submitted by counsel for municipal corporation that
municipal corporation had sent the information of vacant post to Professional Examination Board
but that does not mean that Municipal Corporation, Gwalior had ever made any requests for filling
up the vacant post. Accordingly, Municipal Corporation, Gwalior is directed to ; (i) file a detailed
reply as to why no steps were ever taken to fill up the vacant posts as per the provisions of Section
58 (1) of Act, 1956 and Rules, 2000, (ii) why Municipal Corporation, Gwalior allowed the persons to
be posted on deputation in excess of the sanctioned post,
(iii) why Municipal Corporation, Gwalior succumbed to the dictations of the State Government to
accept the persons on deputation contrary to the Rules, 2000?
8. So far as the deputation of respondent No. 6 - Dr. Anuj Sharma as Health Officer in Municipal
Corporation, Gwalior is concerned, State counsel has produced the record pertaining to the
deputation of Dr. Anuj Sharma to Municipal Corporation, Gwalior as Health Officer. The State has
filed multiple returns but has deliberately suppressed the fact that notesheet had begun at the
instance of the concerning minister and the notesheet of the concerning minister was also not filed
along with any of the return.
9. It is submitted by counsel for State that first return was filed by respondents No. 1 and 3 on
22.03.2025 and since the record was in a sealed condition, therefore, the Office of Advocate General
did not have any idea about the first notesheet which was written by the concerning minister and,
therefore, there is no mention of said notesheet in the return.10. Aforesaid submission made by
counsel for State cannot be accepted. The record which has been produced in a sealed cover also
contains an order dated 07.04.2025 written by Pramod Kumar Shukla, Deputy Secretary, State of
M.P., Urban Administration and Housing Department, which is pasted on the envelope itself. Thus,
it appears that the record must have been sealed on 07.04.2025, therefore, the short return which
was filed by the State on 22.03.2025 cannot be said to have been filed in ignorance of the notesheet.
On the said date, entire record was in an open condition. Furthermore, respondent No. 1 was
required to file its return and for that purpose, if it has deputed somebody as O.I.C., then
respondent No. 1 cannot run away from its liability by saying that the record was in a sealed
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 14
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
condition.
11. Be that whatever it may.
12. One thing is clear that there is every possibility that the O.I.C. has suppressed the material fact
from the court instead of clear direction given by this Court in para 9 of Order dated 19.03.2025
which reads as under :-
"9. Counsel for respondents No.1 and 3 is granted last opportunity of two weeks' to
file detailed return and respondents No.1 and 3 is also directed to explain as to what
prompted them to initiate the proceedings for sending respondent No.6 on
deputation to the Municipal Corporation, Gwalior. The entire record be produced on
the next date of hearing."
13. That is not the end of the matter. Today, additional return has been filed on behalf of respondent
No. 1 and 3. Accordingly, Shri Agrawal was directed to point out as to whether the complete facts
with regard to the initiation of the proceedings for sending respondent No. 6 on deputation was
placed on record or not. It was fairly conceded by Shri Agrawal that the fact that the proceedings
had initiated on the basis of the notesheet written by concerning minister has been suppressed.
14. Be that whatever it may.
15. It is for the O.I.C. to answer the query as to why the material facts were suppressed by him
inspite of the specific direction given by this Court in para 9 of the order dated 19.03.2025.
Accordingly, Shri Anil Kumar Dubey, Additional Commissioner, Municipal Corporation, Gwalior is
directed to clarify as to why in both the returns i.e. return filed on 22.03.2025 and return filed today,
the correct facts have not been placed on record and why they have been suppressed and what was
the intention behind said suppression.
16. From the records which have been placed by the respondents, it is clear that serious complaints
were made against Dr. Anuj Sharma but no steps were taken to decide those complaints. Even the
record contains a notesheet of Dr. R.K. Mehiya, Director, Veterinary Services and Animal
Husbandry, Madhya Pradesh, Bhopal which reads as under :-

17. Therefore, it appears that the Department of Veterinary Services and Animal Husbandry had also
suggested that the decision of posting Shri Anuj Sharma as Health Officer in Municipal Corporation,
Gwalior may be reviewed but it appears that nothing was done thereafter. Accordingly, respondent
No. 2 is directed to file a specific reply as to why the notesheet dated 18.04.2023 written by Dr. R.K.
Mehiya, Director, Veterinary Services and Animal Husbandry was not taken note of and inspite of
his suggestion to review the decision, Dr. Anuj Sharma was sent on deputation.
18. That is not the end of the high handedness of the authority of the State Government. This Court
by order dated 13.03.2025 had directed that respondent No. 6 shall immediately stop function of
Health Officer, Municipal Corporation, Gwalior and, accordingly, Commissioner, Municipal
Corporation, Gwalior by order dated 18.03.2025, relieved respondent No. 6 in the light of order
dated 13.03.2025 passed by this Court. However, the State is still out and out to protect Dr. Anuj
Sharma.In para 13 of the return which has been filed by the State today itself, it is mentioned as
under :-
"That, after completion of tenure of two years deputation, the services of respondent
No. 6 have been repatriated by the municipal corporation vide their letter dated
18.03.2025"
Whereas the respondent No. 6 was relieved by the municipal corporation in view of the interim
order passed by this Court on 13.03.2025. Similar stand was also taken by the State in the return
which was filed on 27.03.2025 at page 4 as under :-
"As the term of the deputation was two years has come to an end the services of the
respondent no.6 has been repatriated by the Municipal Corporation Gwalior vide
letter dated 18.03.2025. Copy of the order of repatriation is annexed hereto marked
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 16
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
as Annexure R/1-4."
19. Respondent / State has filed a copy of order dated 18.03.2025 by which respondent No. 6 was
relieved in the light of interim order dated 13.03.2025. Thus, it is clear that the O.I.C. is out and out
to protect the interest of Dr. Anuj Sharma because if Dr. Anuj Sharma was relieved on account of his
illegal posting on deputation, then it will have adverse effect on the conduct of the State authorities
but by projecting falsely that Dr. Anuj Sharma was not relieved on account of interim order dated
13.03.2025 but he was repatriated on account of completion of his term of two years, State
authorities are directly and indirectly trying to support their act which could not be justified by the
State authority so far.
20. Accordingly. the O.I.C. shall also file his affidavit as to why he has made false statement in
return dated 27.03.2025 and return filed today to the effect that Dr. Anuj Sharma was repatriated
after completion of his term of two years by suppressing this fact that he was relieved vide interim
order dated 13.03.2025.
21. From the record, it appears that Dr. Anuj Sharma was earlier posted in Gwalior as a Veterinary
Officer and he was given the charge of Laltipara Gaushala and other gaushalas, therefore, it appears
that Dr. Anuj Sharma was interested in staying at Gwalior.
22. Accordingly, respondent No. 1 is also directed to file photocopy of the service book of Dr. Anuj
Sharma with the details of his different postings from the date of his appointment.
23. The respondent No. 1 shall also clarify specifically as to why Dr. Anuj Sharma was posted as
Health Officer inspite of the fact that (i) Dr. Anuj Sharma was not holding the MBBS i.e. minimum
qualification; (ii) when the post could not have been filled up by deputation.
24. Respondent No. 6 shall also file his reply as to why he was interested in staying back in Gwalior
instead of working in his parent department i.e. Veterinary Department at Sagar.
25. List on 16th of April, 2025.
Dated : 16-04-2025 In response to order dated 09/04/2025, Municipal Corporation, Gwalior
respondents No.1 and 3, respondents No.2 & 4, and 6 have filed their separate response.
2. In the paragraph 7 of aforesaid order, following three questions were raised to Municipal
Corporation, Gwalior:-
(i) file a detailed reply as to why no steps were ever taken to fill up the vacant posts as
per the provisions of Section 58 (1) of Act, 1956 and Rules, 2000 ?
(ii) why Municipal Corporation, Gwalior allowed the persons to be posted on
deputation in excess of the sanctioned post ?
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 17
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
(iii) why Municipal Corporation, Gwalior succumbed to the dictations of the State
Government to accept the persons on deputation contrary to the Rules, 2000?
3. In reply to those questions, Municipal Corporation, Gwalior has submitted that in the year 2016 a
requisition was forwarded to examination body for initiating recruitment against 106 post. The
examination body conducted the recruitment process only for a part of requisition, pursuant to
which appointments were made and at present 26 candidates from the said recruitment are serving.
It is submitted that in the year 2021 also the answering respondent again communicated to
examination body regarding the requirement to fill-up 137 posts. However, examination body
conducted a recruitment process only in respect of some of the notified posts resulting in 41
appointments on which presently 33 candidates are working. It is further mentioned that
advertisement has been issued on 22/07/2024 for recruitment on various post against handicapped
quota by walk-in interview and that process is going on and in near future the same is likely to be
completed.
4. During the course of arguments, it was also submitted by counsel for respondent No.5 that on
11/01/2022, Municipal Corporation, Gwalior had sent an information to examination body with
regard to vacant posts, but fairly conceded that by that letter only an information was sent in
response to query raised by examination body and no requisition was sent for filling up the vacant
posts.
5. With regard to question No.2, it is mentioned by counsel for Municipal Corporation that State
Government is the highest authority and Municipal Corporation being a statutory local body has no
independent role or discretion in the matter of deputation/appointments. However, it is fairly
conceded that salary of persons who are working on deputation against nonexisting posts or in
excess of sanctioned post is being borne by Municipal Corporation, Gwalior and Municipal
Corporation, Gwalior never asked for reimbursement from the State Government.
6. Answer to question No.3 is dependent on answer to question No.2 and stand of Municipal
Corporation that being local Authority, Municipal Corporation, Gwalior has no say in the matter
with regard to decision taken by State Government to send a person on deputation.
7. Thus, it is clear that Municipal Corporation has taken a specific stand expressing its helplessness
on account of the orders of deputation which are being passed by the State Government i.e.
respondents No.1 and 3.
8. Accordingly, respondents No.1 and 3 are directed to file their response as to why the salary paid
by Municipal Corporation to persons who were sent on deputation in excess of sanctioned post or
against the post which could not have been filled-up by deputation, may not be reimbursed by the
State Government to Municipal Corporation and why salary of such persons may not be paid from
the funds of State Government till they continue on deputation in Municipal Corporation, Gwalior.
9. Further the Municipal Corporation is directed to immediately initiate proceedings for recruitment
to fill-up the post which are to be filled by direct recruitment. Let the requisition in that regard be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 18
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
sent to the competent authority within a period of 30 days from today and the recruitment process
be completed within eight months from thereafter.
10. After referring to the conduct of respondents No.1 and 3 who have filed their return alongwith an
affidavit of Shri Anil Kumar Dubey, Additional Commissioner, Municipal Corporation, Gwalior who
is also on deputation, following question was put in paragraph 20 of order dated 09/04/2025:-
20. Accordingly. the O.I.C. shall also file his affidavit as to why he has made false
statement in return dated 27.03.2025 and return filed today to the effect that Dr.
Anuj Sharma was repatriated after completion of his term of two years by
suppressing this fact that he was relieved vide interim order dated 13.03.2025.
11. Paragraph 6 of the return reads as under:-
6. That, this Hon'ble Court in order dated 9.4.2025 in para 18 has observed in the
following manner: "18. That is not the end of the high handedness of the authority of
the State Government. This Court by order dated 13.03.2025 had directed that
respondent No. 6 shall immediately stop function of Health Officer, Municipal
Corporation, Gwalior and, accordingly, Commissioner, Municipal Corporation,
Gwalior by order dated 18.03.2025, relieved respondent No. 6 in the light of order
dated 13.03.2025 passed by this Court. However, the State is still out and out to
protect Dr. Anuj Sharma. In para 13 of the return which has been filed by the State
today itself, it is mentioned as under :-"That, after completion of tenure of two years
have been repatriated by the municipal corporation vide their letter dated
18.03.2025".
Whereas the respondent No. 6 was relieved by the municipal corporation in view of the interim
order passed by this Court on 13.03.2025.
Similar stand was also taken by the State in the return which was filed on 27.03.2025 at page 4 as
under :-
"As the term of the deputation was two years has come to an end the services of the
respondent no.6 has been repatriated by the Municipal Corporation Gwalior vide
letter dated 18.03.2025. Copy of the order of repatriation is annexed hereto marked
as Annexure R/1-4."
In that regard it is most humbly and respectfully submitted that the documents regarding
repatriation of the petitioner has been filed with first return dated 27.3.2025 vide document
No.3196/2025 before this Hon'ble Court then it is crystal clear that the answering respondents
having no any intention to hide and suppress anything with this Hon'ble Court because once
document is produced before this Hon'ble Court then it is crystal clear that the answering
respondents wants to bring each and every thing before this Hon'ble Court in fair manner though
the wording has been used in the return is not absolutely identical to the document but factum of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 19
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
filing a document shown the bonafide intention of the authority. Hence, it is made clear that the
authority is not suppressed anything before this Hon'ble Court and OIC of the case is not having any
intention to protect the interest of Dr. Anuj Sharma. The OIC is also having an intention to bring
each and every thing before this Hon'ble Court in a fair manner for just decision of the case."
12. Thus, it is clear that Shri Anil Kumar Dubey has admitted that he had given a false statement on
oath by alleging that Dr. Anuj Sharma has been repatriated on account of completion of his tenure
whereas he was sent back to his parent department on account of interim order dated 13/03/2025
passed by this Court. Thus, it is clear that Shri Anil Kumar Dubey, Additional Commissioner,
Municipal Corporation, Gwalior has deliberately filed a false return before this Court thereby
projecting that Dr. Anuj Sharma was sent back to his parent department on completion of his period
of deputation. Although, Shri Anil Kumar Dubey has tried to submit that the Court should not look
into the pleadings but should look into the documents only and the authorities can make any false
statement in their pleadings supported by affidavit but Shri Khedkar, Additional Advocate General
could not justify the aforesaid stand taken by Shri Anil Kumar Dubey.
13. Whether a contempt proceeding, departmental action etc. should be initiated against Shri Anil
Kumar Dubey, Additional Commissioner, Municipal Corporation, Gwalior or not shall be considered
at the time of final disposal of this case.
14. In paragraph 16 and 17 of order dated 09/04/2025, a question was put to respondent No.2 as to
why the note-sheet dated 18/04/2023 written by Dr. R.K.Mehiya, Director Veterinary Services and
Animal Husbandry was not taken note of and why Dr. Anuj Sharma was sent on deputation.
15. By referring to note-sheet of another Minister of Animal Husbandry Dairy Social Justice and
Divyangajan Sashaktikaran, it is submitted by counsel for State that since, Dr. Anuj Sharma had
already worked as Veterinary doctor in Gaushala situated in Gwalior, therefore, the objection raised
by Dr. R.K.Mehiya was overruled.
16. Accordingly, counsel for State was directed to clarify the duties which are assigned to Health
Officer.
17. By referring to paragraph 8 of return filed by respondents No.1 and 3 today, it is submitted that
respondents No.1 and 3 have specifically clarified that the basic work of Sanitary Officer relates to
public health and convenience including cleaning of drains, disposal of sewage drain and privies,
maintain zoo, animal health, control centers, Slaughter house, monitoring adulteration of food and
anti-rabies vaccination, maintenance of carcass.
18. Thus, Shri Khedkar was directed to clarify as to whether all the aforesaid duties, which are not
exhaustive in nature can be performed by a veterinary doctor or not ? It was fairly conceded by Shri
Khedkar that cleaning of drains, disposal of sewage drain and privies and monitoring of adulteration
of food, cleanliness in the city etc does not fall within the jurisdiction of veterinary doctor.
Therefore, it is clear that the objection which was raised by Dr. R.K.Mehiya with regard to
deputation of Dr. Anuj Sharma in Municipal Corporation, Gwalior was overruled on flimsy ground.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 20
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
It is submitted by Shri Khedkar that since, the decision was taken at the highest level, therefore,
authorities were incapable of taking any contrary decision. The aforesaid submission made by
counsel for respondents No.1 and 3 shows helplessness of authorities functioning within the State of
M.P.
19. It is for the State Government to consider that in what manner the law and order situation is to
be maintained in the State of M.P. because on one hand Municipal Corporation has also expressed
its helplessness in respect of all the orders passed by State Government and on other hand the
officers of State Government have expressed their helplessness in view of decisions taken at the
highest level.
20. In paragraph No.15 of order dated 09/04/2025 the following question was put to respondents
No.1 and 3:-
15. It is for the O.I.C. to answer the query as to why the material facts were
suppressed by him inspite of the specific direction given by this Court in para 9 of the
order dated 19.03.2025. Accordingly, Shri Anil Kumar Dubey, Additional
Commissioner, Municipal Corporation, Gwalior is directed to clarify as to why in
both the returns i.e. return filed on 22.03.2025 and return filed today, the correct
facts have not been placed on record and why they have been suppressed and what
was the intention behind said suppression.
21. A reply has been filed by respondents No.1 and 3. Paragraph 5 of their return which has been
filed today reads as under:-
5. That, this Hon'ble Court in order dated 9.4.2025 in para 15 has observed in the
following manner:
15. It is for the O.I.C. to answer the query as to why the material facts were
suppressed by him inspite of the specific direction given by this Court in para 9 of the
order dated 19.03.2025. Accordingly, Shri Anil Kumar Dubey, Additional
Commissioner, Municipal Corporation, Gwalior is directed to clarify as to why in
both the returns i.e. return filed on 22.03.2025 and return filed today, the correct
facts have not been placed on record and why they have been suppressed and what
was the intention behind said suppression.
With regard to the aforesaid observation it most humbly and respectfully submitted that since entire
record has been produced before this Hon'ble Court by the answering respondents on the given date
then there is no question to suppress any of the fact since the sealed cover envelope was not opened
by the OIC so that aforesaid opening has not been done by the OIC and the OIC with the bonafide
intention to produce each and every thing before this Hon'ble Court directly. By that reason only in
the reply filed on behalf of the State is not annexed with the return."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 21
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
22. Respondents No.1 and 3 have also taken a stand that whatever false reply is filed, the Court
should look into the documents only, which speaks in volumes about the high handedness of the
authorities who are trying to put blame on highest authority of their department.
23. One thing is clear that not only Shri Anil Kumar Dubey, Additional Commissioner, Municipal
Corporation, Gwalior suppressed the fact that decision to send respondent No.6 on deputation to
Municipal Corporation, Gwalior was taken by Minister but even the objection raised by Dr.
R.K.Mehiya was also turned down by another Minister was suppressed in their return and facts
came to notice only after the records were perused. It was the contention of counsel for respondents
No.1 and 3 that since records were in sealed cover, therefore, OIC was not aware of certain facts.
That fact has already been taken note of in para 10 of previous order and, therefore, the same does
not require any further deliberations, and said stand is rejected. Furthermore, the respondent Nos. 1
& 2 are directed to clarify as to whether they had disclosed to OIC with regard to initiation of
deputation proceedings or not and, if not, then why the OIC was not made aware of the different
note-sheets written by Ministers.
24. In response to paragraph 21 of order dated 09/04/2025, respondent No.6 has filed his separate
return but has not disclosed as to why he is interested in getting posted in Gwalior itself and that too
against nonexisting post of health officer for which he was not holding the minimum qualification.
However, during the course of arguments, it was submitted by Shri Pawan Dwivedi that respondent
No.6 is ready to go to any place wherever he is posted by State Government.
25. Considered the aforesaid submission made by Shri Pawan Dwivedi.
26. In response to paragraph 22 of order dated 09/04/2025, the service book of respondent No.6
has been produced from which it is clear that after his appointment he was posted in Sagar,
thereafter, he came to Gwalior as veterinary doctor and again went back to Sagar and, thereafter, he
was sent on deputation to Gwalior. He has spent his entire service carrier either at Sagar or Gwalior.
Although, respondent No.6 has fairly conceded that he is ready to go to any place wherever he is
posted by State Government but the manner in which respondent No.6 was shown undue favour by
State Government, it shows that respondent No.6 appears to be an influential person.
27. Since, respondent No.6 has shown his inclination to be posted in any part of State of M.P.,
therefore, it is directed that if the respondent No.6 moves an application for his posting either in the
veterinary hospital, Alirajpur or Jhabua, then State Government shall consider the said request
because the general public is poor and the animals of that area may also get the services of Dr. Anuj
Sharma.
28. Now the only question for consideration is as to whether Dr. Anuj Sharma was holding the
minimum qualification for his posting as Health Officer in Municipal Corporation, Gwalior or not ?
29. It was submitted by Shri Khedkar that minimum qualification for the post of Sanitary Officer is
not MBBS only and to buttress his contention, counsel for respondent No.3 has relied upon his
contentions mentioned in paragraph 8 of return, which has been filed today.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 22
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
30. The relevant part of aforesaid paragraph reads as under:-
"8. That, this Hon'ble Court in order dated 9.4.2025 .......... Thereafter on 18.08.2023
as per earlier note-sheet, Anuj Sharma was appointed on deputation for a period of
two years with certain terms and conditions as mentioned in the order itself which is
already enclosed as Annexure P/2. Anuj Sharma was not having MBBS qualification.
But it is respectfully submitted that Rules of 2000, Schedule-3 wherein the relevant
schedule and numbers are 36, 37, 38 and 39 wherein the persons would be appointed
on the post of Chief Sanitary Officer, thereafter Sanitary Officer, Assistant Sanitary
Officer and the process of promotion was also given. The minimum qualification for
holding the post of Assistant Sanitary Officer is MBBS, however for the post of
Sanitary Inspector, minimum qualification is B.Sc and diploma in Sanitary. It is
further clarified that the post of Sanitary Inspector wherein BSC + diploma in
Sanitary and promotional post of Sanitary Inspector would be Assistant Sanitary
Officer and thereafter the person concern can be promoted as Chief Sanitary Officer.
Meaning thereby, the minimum qualification for holding the post of Sanitary Officer
would not be MBBS only. Meaning thereby, the Sanitary Inspector can be promoted
as per schedule of Rules of 2000 and there are posts available, so the persons may be
promoted from Sanitary Inspector to Assistant Sanitary Officer and thereafter Chief
Sanitary Officer. In such situation, any person who is not having the minimum
eligibility, which is required for Sanitary Officer as MBBS, is not essential
qualification but the post can be filled up by promotion even the person is not having
MBBS degree."
31. Accordingly, a specific question was put to Shri Khedkar as to whether a person who is appointed
as a class three employee can be sent on deputation on a class one post by holding that since, person
who has been sent on deputation is holding the minimum qualification for the class three post or not
? Shri Khedkar rightly got agitated after hearing the query from the Court because a Class-I officer
would not like to be substituted by person of Class-III even by deputation. It is really surprising that
when a higher officer is not ready to get substituted by an officer of Class-III post by deputation,
then why they are taking such stand in the return. Nothing more is required to be said about the
manner in which the return has been drafted except that even Shri Khedkar accepted that
respondent No.6 is not holding the minimum qualification prescribed for the post of Sanitary
Inspector also. Although, it was the stand of State Government that the minimum qualification for
the post of Sanitary Officer is B.Sc. and Diploma and the post of Assistant Sanitary Officer can be
filled by promotion from Chief Sanitary Officer but could not justify as to how the State Government
can say that since, the minimum qualification for the lowest post i.e. Sanitary Officer is Diploma and
B.Sc., therefore, the post of Sanitary Officer can be filled up by a person who is not holding
minimum qualification i.e. MBBS which is required for Assistant Sanitary Officer. Even otherwise, it
is undisputed fact that Dr. Anuj Sharma was not even holding B.Sc. and Diploma as required for
direct recruitment to the post of Sanitary Inspector. Furthermore, the State Government had sent
respondent No.6 on deputation on a non-existing post i.e. Health Officer whereas there is no post
like Health Officer and only posts are of Chief Sanitary Officer, Assistant Sanitary Officer, Sanitary
Officer.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 23
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
32. It was submitted by Shri Pawan Dwivedi that as per the set up relied upon by petitioner himself,
the veterinary doctor is kept in category of Assistant Sanitary Officer and, therefore, the petitioner
could have been posted as a Sanitary Officer in Municipal Corporation, Gwalior.
33. Considered the submissions made by counsel for respondent No.6.
34. It is submitted by counsel for petitioner that so far as the set up is concerned, it merely provides
that where population is more than five lacs, veterinary doctor under the category of Assistant
Sanitary Officer can also be posted. The duties to be performed by veterinary doctor are completely
different from the duties of Assistant Sanitary Officer, therefore, respondent No.6 cannot take
advantage of set up which merely provides number of officers to be posted in an area. Further it is
submitted by counsel for petitioner that said set-up was only a proposed set up and recruitment has
to be made in accordance with Rules, 2000. Furthermore, the veterinary doctor was never placed in
the category of Sanitary Officer which was earlier known as Health Officer.
35. It is further submitted by Shri Pawan Dwivedi that since, Municipal Corporation, Gwalior was in
need of veterinary doctor, therefore, they were also demanding veterinary doctor and thus, the
deputation of respondent No.6 was in order to fulfill the demand raised by Municipal Corporation
for posting of veterinary doctor.
36. In reply, a very shocking answer was given by counsel for petitioner. It is submitted that Dr.
Dinesh Dixit who is a veterinary doctor has been sent on deputation on the post of Dy.
Commissioner by order dated 14/08/2023. The said fact was also accepted by Shri Gaurav Mishra
and submitted that Dr. Dinesh Dixit was sent on deputation on the post of Dy. Commissioner. The
aforesaid fact is subject to verification. However, if a veterinary doctor was sent on deputation on
the post of Dy. Commissioner, then it speaks in volumes about the manner in which the officers are
being sent on deputation to Municipal Corporation, Gwalior requiring deeper probe into this aspect.
Municipal Corporation, Gwalior has also filed the details of all the officers who have been sent on
deputation in Municipal Corporation, Gwalior as Annexure R-5/6. However, it is submitted by Shri
Mishra that so far as the Commissioner is concerned, he is appointed as per the provisions of
Section 54 of M.P. Municipal Corporation Act, 1956. However, in remark column of R-5/6 the word
"deputation" has been mentioned. Thus, in absence of order of posting of Commissioner, it is
difficult for this Court to find out as to whether he has been sent in exercise of power under Section
54 of Municipal Corporation Act, 1956 or he has been sent on deputation.
37. Accordingly, issue notices to 61 persons who have been named in Annexure R-5/6 (filed
alongwith I.A.No.4042/2025) namely Shri Sangh Priya, Smt. Rajni Shukla, Shri Vijay Raj, Shri
Munish Sikarwar, Shri Anil Kumar Dubey, Shri Dinesh Dixit, Shri Sunil Kumar Chauhan, Shri Amar

Parashar, Smt. Priyanka Dwivedi, Shri Sandeep Mishra, Shri Kuldeep Parashar to show cause as to
why their deputation may not be cancelled and why they should not be sent back/repatriated to
their parent department.
Notices are made returnable within a period of two weeks. The notices shall be served through
Commissioner, Municipal Corporation, Gwalior, who shall file his service report by 30/04/2025.
38. Respondents No.1 and 3 are also directed to file their response with regard to each and every
person who has been sent on deputation and whose names are mentioned in R-5/6.
39. Respondents No.1 and 3 shall also specifically file a reply as to why certain persons have been
sent on deputation whereas as per Rules 2000, the post cannot be filled up by deputation, and shall
also clarify that why excessive persons have been sent on deputation whereas sanctioned strength of
that particular post is less.
40. This Court could have quashed the order of deputation or could have closed the writ petition,
but the manner in which shocking facts are coming on record on each and every date, it has become
necessary to issue notices to all the officers who are on deputation including OIC who is guilty of
suppressing the material facts while filing the return.
41. It is submitted by Shri Khedkar that in fact the State Government has cancelled the deputation of
respondent No.6.
42. Considered the aforesaid submissions.
43. Respondents No.1 and 3 have filed a letter dated 15/04/2025 as Annexure R-1/13 alongwith
return filed today, which says that since, Dr. Anuj Sharma has been relieved, therefore, his relieving
is granted post- facto approval and his services are repatriated to parent department. It is made
clear that respondent No.6 was not relieved by Municipal Corporation, Gwalior on its own but it was
under compulsion as an interim order was passed by this Court on 13/03/2025 thereby directing the
Municipal Corporation to immediately relieve Dr. Anuj Sharma. Thus, even while passing the order
dated 15/04/2025 Dy. Secretary State Government of M.P., Urban Development and Housing has
not accepted the mistake which was committed by State and they are still trying to protect and hide
their mistakes. On one hand respondents No.1 and 3 have accepted that Dr. Anuj Sharma was not
holding minimum qualification but still he was sent on deputation on a non-existing post
specifically when, even the Municipal Corporation in its NOC had made it clear that minimum
qualification is MBBS, but still the State is not ready to accept its mistake and is still trying to cover
up its misdeed by filing vague and misleading returns. Therefore, now if any order of cancellation of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 25
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
deputation is passed that will not be taken note of for the purposes of this petition because that will
be under compulsion as respondent/State is unable to answer any of the query, which is being
raised by this Court and is also unable to answer as to how Dr. Anuj Sharma was eligible to be sent
on deputation on the non-existing post of Health Officer.
44. At the cost of repetition, respondents No.1 and 3 are also specifically directed to file detailed
reply in respect of each and every person who has been sent on "deputation/deputation by transfer"
including the question as to why some of them have been sent on deputation in
excess of sanctioned strength and why some of them have been sent on deputation
where Rule does not provide for filling up the post by deputation.
45. The State Government is also directed to clarify that why persons who have been sent on
deputation are not interested in serving their parent department and why persons are interested in
getting themselves transferred to Municipal Corporation, Gwalior on deputation.
46. The photocopy of service book which was produced in sealed cover, the record pertaining to
sending Dr. Anuj Sharma on deputation are also returned to the counsel for respondents No.1 and 3
in a sealed cover.
47. List this case on 02/05/2025.
Dated 02-05-2025 Counsel for the noticees pray for and are granted two days' time to file a detailed
return pointing out the substantive post in their parent department and whether they themselves
had moved an application for sending them on deputation to Municipal Corporation, Gwalior or not
and if so then what was the reason for the same.
Counsel for respondent No.5 also undertakes to file a specific return that which private noticee is
working against a post which could not have been filled by deputation or who are posted in excess of
the maximum number of sanctioned post which could have been filled up on deputation as per
Rules 2000.
The State counsel prays for and is granted two days' time to file a detailed return in respect of each
private noticee specifically pointing out the reason for which the proposal for sending them to
Municipal Corporation, Gwalior on deputation was initiated as well as the substantive post of the
private noticees in their parent department.
The respondents No.1 to 4 shall also specifically point out as to whether the private noticees are
eligible to hold the post on which they have been sent on deputation. The counsel for respondents
No.1 to 4 shall also specifically point out as to why the person in excess of the sanctioned post and
contrary to the Rule 2000 were sent on deputation.
This Court vide order dated 16.04.2025 and had also directed respondents No.1 to 4 to point out as
to why a direction may not be given to reimburse the salary of the persons who have been sent on

Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
deputation by the State to the Municipal Corporation, Gwalior because the Municipal Corporation,
Gwalior has expressed its inability and helplessness in the light of the orders of deputation which
have been passed by State Government. Accordingly, a specific reply should also be given by the
respondents No.1 to 4 as to why salary of such persons who have been sent on deputation should not
be directed to be reimbursed by State right from the date of their deputation as well as till they
remain on deputation in Municipal Corporation Gwalior.
Counsel for respondents No.1 to 6 shall also file their specific return to the question raised by this
Court by order dated 16.04.2025. Therefore, respondent No.6 is also directed to file a specific return
by next date of listing to answer the question raised by this Court by order dated 16.04.2025.
At this stage, it is submitted by counsel for respondent No.5 that Shri Sangh Priy, Commissioner,
Municipal Corporation, Gwalior was sent by the State Government in exercise of power under
Section 54 of the Municipal Corporation Act and therefore, notice issued may be recalled as he was
not sent on deputation.
The case was taken up at 10:30 in the morning and therefore, the State counsel was directed to seek
instructions from the concerning department as to whether Shri Sangh Priy was sent to Municipal
Corporation, Gwalior in exercise of power under Section 54 of the Municipal Corporation Act or he
was sent on deputation because the order by which Shri Sangh Priy was sent to Municipal
Corporation, Gwalior neither contains the declaration that such order has been passed in exercise of
power under Section 54 of the Municipal Corporation Act nor contains the word deputation.
Accordingly, at the request of counsel for the State, case was passed over and it was taken up at
02:30 pm. In the passover round also, counsel for the State expressed his helplessness in answering
the query raised by this Court. Thus, it is clear that either the officers sitting at the highest level are
hiding certain facts from the Court or they are unable to understand the basis on which they have
passed certain orders.
It is submitted by Shri Kushwaha that since the Principal Secretary of GAD was unable to
understand the real intention of the order passed by this Court on 16.04.2025 as well as the
direction given by this Court in the first half of the day, therefore, he did not communicate anything
to him with regard to the provision under which the order of posting of Shri Sangh Priy, Municipal
Corporation, Gwalior was passed. Accordingly, he prays for two days' time to file a detailed reply
with regard to the nature of order of posting of Shri Sangh Priy.
For the time being, notice issued to Shri Sangh Priy, Commissioner, Municipal Corporation, Gwalior
is kept on hold and accordingly, the reply filed by him in response to the notice issued by this Court
by order dated 16.04.2025 shall also not be considered with regard to his method of posting.
At this stage, it is submitted by Shri D.P.Singh that the State Government by order dated
28.04.2025 has repatriated Dr. Dinesh Dixit to his parent department.
The said fact is taken on record.

Municipal Corporation, Gwalior.
It is further directed that from today onwards, all the replies shall be filed by the State Government
along with an officer not below the rank of Under Secretary posted in the department at Bhopal and

application are directed to be impleaded as additional respondents. Since all the respondents as

3. Let amendment be carried out by tomorrow.
4. It is submitted by counsel for State that because of continuous load shedding, the return could not
be prepared and prays for a day's time. It was also submitted that although this Court by order dated
16.04.2025 had directed the State counsel to produce the files of all the persons pertaining to their
deputation but he has received only 30 files. He also expressed that he is not in a position to obtain
the remaining files by tomorrow.
5. It is a case where lot of persons have been sent on deputation contrary to the Madhya Pradesh
Municipal Corporation (Appointment and Conditions of Service of Officers and Servants) Rules,
2000 because of which case of each and every person has to be considered on its own merits and it is
for the Corporation to decide that who is to be retained and who is not to be retained.
6. Counsel for Corporation is also directed to give the details of persons who are engaged in essential
services so that if any order of cancellation of their deputation is passed, then essential services of
City of Gwalior may not come to a halt.
7. It is also submitted by counsel for respondent No. 5 that the proceedings for filling up the vacant
post are underway.

Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
Arguments Shri S.S. Kushwaha, Govt. Advocate
17. By referring to Section 54 of Municipal Corporation Act, it is submitted by Counsel for State that
the Commissioner is appointed under this provision.
Accordingly, it is submitted that Shri Sangh Priy was posted as Commissioner, Municipal
Corporation, Gwalior.
18. Accordingly, he was directed to provide the record pertaining to posting of Shri Sangh Priy, as
Commissioner, Municipal Corporation, Gwalior. In the name of record, only an order of
posting/transfer of Shri Sangh Priy was provided to the Court, and it was submitted that except the
order of posting/transfer, there is no other record to show that the order of Shri Sangh Priy has been
passed in exercise of power under Section 54 of Municipal Corporation Act. He also admitted that
the order of posting of Shri Sangh Priy is a consolidated transfer order of various officers. Thus, it is
clear that Shri Sangh Priy has been transferred to Municipal Corporation, Gwalior by passing a
normal transfer order, without there being anything to show that said order has been passed under
Section 54 of Municipal Corporation Act.
19. It is further submitted by Shri Kushwaha, that employees can be send on deputation/ transfer on
deputation in exercise of power under Section 58(3) and 58(5) of Municipal Corporation Act.
20. However, it was admitted by Counsel for State that inspite of order passed by this Court, the
respondents have not provided records of all the noticees, pertaining to their deputation/transfer on
deputation, and submitted that adverse inference may not be drawn in respect of those employees,
whose records have not been sent by the respondent. Shri Kushwaha also prayed that atleast one
month's time may be granted to produce the record of remaining employees.
21. Considered the submission made by Shri Kushwaha for grant of one month's time to produce the
record of remaining employees.
22. Shri Kushwaha was directed to point out reasons for not producing the records pertaining to
deputation/transfer on deputation of some of the employees. Shri Kushwaha, maintained silence
and did not point out any reason for not producing the record of some of the employees. Thus, it is
clear that the respondents no. 1 to 4 are deliberately hiding the records pertaining to deputation/
transfer on deputation of some of the employees. Thus, where a person is in possession of best
evidence and do not produce the record inspite of the direction given by the Court, then adverse
inference can be drawn. Therefore, it is held that an adverse inference shall be drawn in respect of
those employees, whose record pertaining to their deputation/ transfer on deputation has not been
produced inspite of in spite of opportunity given by this Court.
23. So far as the question as to why the persons were sent on deputation/ transfer on deputation to
the Municipal Corporation, Gwalior, it was submitted by Counsel for the State that it was on the
demand made by the Municipal Corporation, Gwalior. However, fairly conceded that no letter was
sent by Municipal Corporation, thereby requesting the State Govt. to send the employees on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 30
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
deputation/ transfer on deputation. He fairly conceded that the Municipal Corporation, Gwalior had
merely informed about the vacancy existing in the Municipal Corporation, Gwalior. He further
admitted that no note sheet has been placed on record, to show that the State Govt. had ever treated
such information regarding vacancies as a deemed demand. Accordingly, it is fairly conceded by
Shri Kushwaha that the stand that employees were sent on deputation on the demand raised by the
Municipal Corporation is a self generated excuse with no factual background.
24. So far as the question as to why the State Govt. may not be directed to reimburse the salary of
those employees back to the Municipal Corporation, it was submitted by Counsel for the State that
since, the employees were sent on deputation in accordance with law and those employees have
worked for the Municipal Corporation, Gwalior, therefore, no such direction may be issued.
25. Accordingly, whether the employees were sent on deputation in accordance with law or not shall
be considered after individual cases are considered.
26. So far as the question as to why the State Govt. sent the employees on deputation/transfer on
deputation in contravention of Rules 2000 and in excess of sanctioned strength, the Counsel for the
State maintained silence and did not justify the said act of the State Govt. It is fairly conceded that
there is no record to suggest that total number of posts which can be filled up by deputation/
transfer on deputation were ever considered by the State Govt. He further admitted that the
proposal to increase the sanctioned strength of Add. Commissioner to 4 from 2 was never approved
by the State Govt., but could not explain then why four persons were sent on deputation on the post
of Add. Commissioner specifically when according to Rules, 2000, 50% of the sanctioned strength is
to be filled up by promotion. He fairly conceded that there is no answer to the above question either
in the form of pleading or record.
27. So far as the recommendations made by Ministers is concerned, it is specifically admitted by
Shri Kushwaha that none of the record which has been provided to the Court contains the
recommendatory letter of the Minister. There is nothing in the note sheets to show that it was ever
considered by the State Govt. that sending a person on deputation/ transfer on deputation is in
public interest. He fairly conceded that persons were sent on deputation/ transfer on deputation
merely on account of recommendation made by Ministers. Thus, it is clear that employees were sent
on deputation merely on the recommendation made by the Ministers, without considering the
public interest.
28. It is not out of place to mention here that on 16-4-2025, Shri Vivek Khedkar, Add. Advocate
General had appeared on behalf the respondents no. 1 to 4 and had expressed the helplessness of the
officials of the State Govt. and his contention was recorded in the order sheet as under :
"It is submitted by Shri Khedkar that since, the decision was taken at the highest
level, therefore, authorities were incapable of taking any contrary decision. The
aforesaid submission made by counsel for respondents No.1 and 3 shows
helplessness of authorities functioning within the State of M.P."

Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
Shri Gaurav Mishra, Counsel for Municipal Corporation, Gwalior
29. It is submitted by Counsel for Municipal Corporation, Gwalior that it had never made any
request to the State Govt. for filling up the vacancies by deputation/ transfer on deputation. It is
submitted that by letter dated 2-1- 2021, the Joint Director, Urban Administration and Development
Secretariat sought information regarding total number of vacancies, therefore in response to the
said letter, a reply dated 11-1-2021 was sent to Joint Director, Urban Administration and
Development Secretariat, thereby informing the Sanctioned Posts, Vacancies and the filled up posts.
Even otherwise, the Joint Director, Urban Administration and Development Secretariat did not
make any attempt to fill up the posts by direct recruitment. Even otherwise, no decision of the State
Govt. was ever communicated to the Municipal Corporation that till the regular appointments are
made, the State Govt. shall be sending employees on deputation/ transfer on deputation. It is
further submitted that only in few cases, the NOC from Municipal Corporation was sought but
otherwise, the employees were sent without obtaining any consent from the Municipal Corporation.
30. It is further submitted that so far as the action of State to post persons on deputation/ transfer
on deputation in excess of sanctioned strength is concerned, it is submitted that the Municipal
Corporation had sent a detailed report outlining the complete administrative setup including the
number of vacancies, sanctioned strength as well as additional persons working on deputation. It is
submitted that authority to post persons on deputation exclusively lie with the State Govt. under
Section 58(3) of Municipal Corporation Act, and Municipal Corporation has no independent say in
the matter and it has to act in accordance with the decision of the State Govt. It is submitted that
during the tenure of Administrator, the Municipal Corporation had formally requested the State
Govt. to repatriate approximately 38 employees, citing financial constraints on account of Covid 19
pandemic. However, with passage of time, the financial condition of Municipal Corporation
improved and therefore, no action was thereafter taken with regard to request for repatriating the
employees.
31. With regard to efforts made by Municipal Corporation for making regular appointment is
concerned, it is the stand of the Municipal Corporation that the Municipal Corporation was making
sincere and bonafide efforts to fill up the vacant posts in accordance with statutory provisions. In
the year 2016, a requisition was forwarded to the examination body for initiating recruitment
against 106 vacant posts and in response to that, the examination body conducted recruitment
process only for a part of requisitioned posts and at present 26 candidates from the said recruitment
are serving. Again in the year 2021, and Municipal Corporation communicated to the examination
body to conduct examination for 137 posts and only few posts were advertised and at present 33
candidates are working who got selected in the said recruitment process are working. It is further
submitted that on 3-4-2025, 119 posts have been advertised which are reserved for persons with
disabilities and the said selection process is presently underway at the level of Municipal
Corporation.
32. Thus, it is the stand of the Municipal Corporation that from time to time, it was requesting the
examination conducting body to conduct recruitment process to fill up the vacant posts, but it was
the examining body which did not conduct recruitment process to fill up the vacancies.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 32
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
33. It is further submitted that the Municipal Corporation by making remark in its letter dated
11-1-2021, had specifically informed the State Govt. with regard to the excess number of employees
working on deputation. Thus, it is the stand of the Municipal Corporation, Gwalior, that although
the Municipal Corporation was constantly informing the State Govt. about posting of employees on
deputation/ transfer on deputation in excess of what is provided under Rules, but even then the
State Govt. continued to send more persons on deputation/ transfer on deputation even on the posts
which were not available to the filled up by deputation/ transfer on deputation, but since, it is within
the exclusive domain of the State Govt., therefore, the Municipal Corporation, Gwalior could not
refuse to accept the joining of the persons, who were sent on deputation/transfer on deputation, on
the posts which were not available to be filled up by deputation/transfer on deputation or which
were in excess of sanctioned strength.Thus, it is clear that the Municipal Corporation, Gwalior has
put the entire blame on the State Govt. in sending persons on deputation/ transfer on deputation in
contravention of provisions of Rules 2000.
Shri M.P.S. Raghuvanshi, Senior Advocate
34. Shri Raghuvanshi, started his arguments by submitting that the Court must give patient hearing
because at the end of the day, gksbfg lksb tks jke jfp jk[kk. Accordingly, it was the prayer of Shri
Raghuvanshi, that this Court should consider his arguments without putting any question.
Therefore, this Court did not put even a single question during his arguments.
35. It is submitted by Shri Raghuvanshi, that this petition against the noticees i.e., who were
subsequently impleaded in view of the order passed by the Writ Appellate Court, is not
maintainable. The writ of Quo Warranto would lie only if the appointment of an employee is bad on
account of the fact that said employee is not eligible to hold the said post. Even otherwise, there is a
difference between Eligibility and Suitability and this Court cannot look into the suitability of an
employee as it is within the exclusive domain of the State Govt. It is submitted that F.R. 110, 9(7)
deals with deputation, whereas F.R. 9(3) deals with lien. It is further submitted that in view of
provisions of Section 58(3) and (5) of Municipal Corporation Act, the State Govt has an authority to
send any person on deputation/transfer on deputation and as per Section 58(5) of Municipal
Corporation Act, even the consent of the concerning Municipal Corporations is not required.
However, fairly conceded in none of the order of transfer on deputation, it was mentioned by the
State Govt. that the deputationist shall hold his lien on his original post. But it is submitted that the
conditions of Section 58(6) of Municipal Corporation Act are inbuilt in the order of transfer on
deputation and it is not required to be mentioned specifically in the order. It is further submitted
that under Article 243 of Constitution of India, the Municipal Corporations are under the control of
the State Govt. It is further submitted that if a person has been sent on deputation, then the post
held by him on deputation/ transfer on deputation cannot be said to be a regular post. Shri M.P..S.
Raghuvanshi, relied upon the judgments passed by Supreme Court in the case of (1999) 4 SCC 659,
(2012) 7 SCC 757, (2022) 7 SCC 706, (2006) 11 SCC 731, (1997) 4 SCC 348, (2010) 9 SCC 655, 1993)
4 SCC 119, (1999) 7 SCC 120, (2023) 5 SCC 661, (2012) 9 SCC 545, (2014) 1 SCC 161, and orders
passed by this Court in the case of 2015(2) MPLJ 339, 1986 MPLJ 495, and (1998) 1 MPLJ 449.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 33
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
36. Since, Shri Raghuvanshi had requested the Court not to disturb him during the Course of
arguments, therefore, the line of argument which was adopted by Shri Raghuvanshi that this
petition against the subsequently impleaded is a writ petition in the nature of quo warranto was not
questioned by this Court. However, at the end of his arguments,only one question was put to him
and that was that "whether this Court can consider the act of State Govt. in sending any person to
Municipal Corporation on deputation/ transfer on deputation or not and whether such act of Govt.
is subject to judicial review or not? In nutshell, a question was put to Shri Raghuvanshi was that,
whether the act of Govt. is a colourable exercise of power or not can be considered by this Court or
not?
37. It was fairly conceded by Shri Raghuvanshi, that whether the Govt. has acted fairly in accordance
with law or whether its action is bad on account of colourable exercise of power or not has to be
justified by the State and such act of State Govt. is not beyond the power of judicial review.
However, Shri Raghuvanshi, did not advance any argument on the question of colourable exercise of
power by the State."
Shri Harish Dixit, Senior Advocate
38. It was submitted by Shri Dixit that Rules 2000, does not provide the number of sanctioned posts
and the setup on which the respondents are relying is not the final set up and it is merely a proposal.
However, in spite of repeated queries by this Court, that even if his contention is accepted then what
would be consequences, i.e., whether the State Govt. would get uncontrolled power to appoint or
post any number of employees on deputation/ transfer on deputation, or no one can be
posted/appointed in absence of sanctioned posts, but no reply was given and Shri Dixit tried to shift
this burden on to the shoulder of State Govt.
39. Whenever any argument is advanced by the Counsel, specifically Senior Counsel, then he should
also argue on the possible consequences, but Shri Dixit left his arguments in the mid way, by saying
that it is for the State Govt. to argue as to whether it would have uncontrolled power to appoint any
number of employees or no appointment can be made at all. Thus, it is clear that Shri Dixit has
argued the matter half heartedly, without making any attempt to take his arguments to the logical
end.
40. However, it is submitted by Counsel for State and the Municipal Corporation that existing setup
has been sanctioned and posts can be filled up on the basis of sanctioned posts mentioned in the set
up. Shri Pawan Dwivedi, Counsel for Respondent no. 6
41. It is submitted by Shri Dwivedi, that the ineligibility of Dr. Anuj Sharma, to hold the post of
Health Officer has already been considered by this Court on the previous occasions and he has also
been relieved in compliance of the interim order dated 13-3-2025, and subsequently, he has also
made a categorical statement, that he is ready to work on his substantive post in any part of the
State, therefore, submitted that he has nothing more to add.
Other Counsels for the private respondents

Maheshwari Shri Nirmal Sharma, Shri S.K. Sharma, Shri Sanjay Kumar Mishra, Shri Ashok Dohare,
Shri Kamlesh Kori, Shri Dharmendra Nayak, who are appearing for other private respondents
submitted that they would adopt the arguments advanced by Shri S.S. Kushwaha, Shri Gaurav
Mishra, Shri M.P.S. Raghuvanshi, Shri Harish Dixit, Advocates, therefore, they would not like to add
anything.
Scope of interference in this petition
43. This petition can be bifurcated into two parts i.e., Whether the persons who were sent on
deputation/ transfer on deputation were eligible to hold the posts and Whether deputation/transfer
on deputation of private respondents is bad on account of Colourable Exercise of Power?
Discussion What is the meaning of Deputation/Transfer on Deputation
44. The Supreme Court in the case of State of Punjab Vs. Inder Singh and others reported in (1997)
8 SCC 372 has held as under :
18. The concept of "deputation" is well understood in service law and has a
recognised meaning. "Deputation" has a different connotation in service law and the
dictionary meaning of the word "deputation" is of no help. In simple words
"deputation" means service outside the cadre or outside the parent department.
Deputation is deputing or transferring an employee to a post outside his cadre, that is
to say, to another department on a temporary basis. After the expiry period of
deputation the employee has to come back to his parent department to occupy the
same position unless in the meanwhile he has earned promotion in his parent
department as per the Recruitment Rules. Whether the transfer is outside the normal
field of deployment or not is decided by the authority who controls the service or post
from which the employee is transferred. There can be no deputation without the
consent of the person so deputed and he would, therefore, know his rights and
privileges in the deputation post. The law on deputation and repatriation is quite
settled as we have also seen in various judgments which we have referred to above.
There is no escape for the respondents now to go back to their parent departments and working
there as Constables or Head Constables as the case may be.
45. The Supreme Court in the case of Union of India Vs. Bhanwar Lal Mundanreported in (2013) 12
SCC 433 has held as under :
11. It is not in dispute that the respondent was sent on deputation and his lien in the
parent department continued and hence, it was obligatory on the part of the
authorities in the parent department to intimate him when the selection process for
the higher post was undertaken as he had already come within the zone of
consideration. In this context, we may refer with profit to the authority in D.M.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 35
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
Bharati v. L.M. Sud wherein the Court was dealing with a case whether the employee
had got a promotion in the department to which he was sent on deputation. While
considering the effect of the said promotion after repatriation the Court observed
thus:
(SCC p. 167, para 7) "7. ... that the appellant's promotion as junior draftsman and
proposed promotion as Surveyor-cum-Draftsman in the Town Planning
Establishment cannot confer any rights on him in his parent department. When he
left the Municipal Corporation and joined the Town Planning Establishment he was a
tracer and he can go back to the Estate Department or any other department of the
Municipal Corporation only to his original post i.e. as tracer, subject to the
modification that, if in the meantime he had qualified for promotion to a higher post,
that benefit cannot be denied to him."
Thus, the repatriation has to be to the original post and benefit of promotion in the department to
which an employee is deputed is of no consequence, subject to his entitlement of status otherwise
available in the parent department.
12. In Puranjit Singh v. UT of Chandigarh it has been held that when a deputationist is repatriated
he cannot claim promotions in the parent department on the basis of officiation in a higher post in
the borrower organisation.
13. In State of Punjab v. Inder Singh the learned Judges elaborately adverted to the concept of
deputation and the right of a deputationist and in that context opined thus: (SCC pp. 384-85, para
18) "18. The concept of 'deputation' is well understood in service law and has a recognised meaning.
'Deputation' has a different connotation in service law and the dictionary meaning of the word
'deputation' is of no help. In simple words 'deputation' means service outside the cadre or outside
the parent department. Deputation is deputing or transferring an employee to a post outside his
cadre, that is to say, to another department on a temporary basis. After the expiry period of
deputation the employee has to come back to his parent department to occupy the same position
unless in the meanwhile he has earned promotion in his parent department as per the Recruitment
Rules."
46. The Supreme Court in the case of Ashok Kumar Ratilal Patel Vs. Union of India reported in
(2012) 7 SCC 757 has held as under :
13. Ordinarily transfers on deputations are made as against equivalent post from one
cadre to another, one department to another, one organisation to another, or one
Government to another; in such case a deputationist has no legal right in the post.
Such deputationist has no right to be absorbed in the post to which he is deputed. In
such case, deputation does not result into recruitment, as no recruitment in its true
import and significance takes place as the person continues to be a member of the
parent service.

14. However, the aforesaid principle cannot be made applicable in the matter of
appointment (recruitment) on deputation. In such case, for appointment on
deputation in the services of the State or organisation or State within the meaning of
Article 12 of the Constitution of India, the provisions of Article 14 and Article 16 are
to be followed. No person can be discriminated nor is it open to the appointing
authority to act arbitrarily or to pass any order in violation of Article 14 of the
Constitution of India. A person who applies for appointment on deputation has an
indefeasible right to be treated fairly and equally and once such person is selected
and offered with the letter of appointment on deputation, the same cannot be
cancelled except on the ground of non-suitability or unsatisfactory work.
47. The Supreme Court in the case of Umapati Choudhary Vs. State of Bihar and another reported in
(1999) 4 SCC 659 has held as under :
8. Deputation can be aptly described as an assignment of an employee (commonly
referred to as the deputationist) of one department or cadre or even an organisation
(commonly referred to as the parent department or lending authority) to another
department or cadre or organisation (commonly referred to as the borrowing
authority). The necessity for sending on deputation arises in public interest to meet
the exigencies of public service. The concept of deputation is consensual and involves
a voluntary decision of the employer to lend the services of his employee and a
corresponding acceptance of such services by the borrowing employer. It also
involves the consent of the employee to go on deputation or not. In the case at hand
all the three conditions were fulfilled.
The University, the parent department or lending authority, the Board, the borrowing authority and
the appellant, the deputationist, had all given their consent for deputation of the appellant and for
his permanent absorption in the establishment of the borrowing authority. There is no material to
show that the deputation of the appellant was not in public interest or it was vitiated by favouritism
or mala fide. The learned Single Judge in the previous writ petition had neither quashed the
deputation order nor issued any direction for its termination. Indeed the learned Single Judge had
dismissed the writ petition. No material has been placed before us to show that between November
1987 when the judgment of the Single Judge was rendered and December 1991 when the Division
Bench disposed of the writ petition filed by the appellant the petitioners of the previous case had
raised any grievance or made any complaint regarding non-compliance with the directions made in
the judgment of the learned Single Judge. In these circumstances the Division Bench was clearly in
error in declining to grant relief to the appellant. Further, the appellant has, in the meantime,
retired from service, and therefore, the decision in the case is relevant only for the purpose of
calculating his retiral benefits.
48. The Supreme Court in the case of Prasar Bharti Vs. Amarjeet Singh reported in (2007) 9 SCC
539 has held as under :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 37
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
13. There exists a distinction between "transfer" and "deputation". "Deputation"
connotes service outside the cadre or outside the parent department in which an
employee is serving. "Transfer", however, is limited to equivalent post in the same
cadre and in the same department. Whereas deputation would be a temporary
phenomenon, transfer being antithesis must exhibit the opposite indications.
14. There cannot be any doubt whatsoever that ordinarily no employee can be
transferred without his consent from one employer to another. (See Jawaharlal
Nehru University v. Dr. K.S. Jawatkar.) But, the said principle has no application in
the instant case.
15. A transfer of an employee may be governed by the provisions of a statute or the
terms and conditions of a contract of service.
49. The Full Bench of this Court, in the case of Indore Nagar Nigam Karamchari Congress Vs. State
of M.P. reported in 1998 (1)MPLJ 449 has held as under :
"5. In the case of Dr. Vasant (supra), the Division Bench of this Court relying on the
decision of the case Sate of M.P. v. Shankerlal (supra) held that the provisions of
sub-sections (5) and (6) of section 58 of the Amending Act, 1982, is valid. However,
subsequently two decisions given by Hon. Supreme Court in one General Officer,
Commanding-in-Chief v. Subhash Chandra, AIR 1988 SC 876 in Jawaharlal Nehru
University v. K.S. Jawatkar, AIR 1989 SC 1577 this reference is made that how far the
law is laid down in the case of Dr. Vasant (supra) hold good.
In Subhash Chandra's case (supra) it was a case in which a transfer of an employee serving in
Cantonment Board to another Cantonment Board, was challenged. Dr. Subhash Chandra Yadav was
appointed as a sub-charge Cantonment General Hospital, Lucknow and he was transferred to
Cantonment General Hospital, Varanasi. This was challenged before the Allahabad High Court by
challenging the validity of Rule 5-C of the Cantonment Boards servants Rules, 1937 as ultra vires of
the provisions of the Cantonment Act, 1924. Rule 5- C gave a power to Commanding-in-Chief to
transfer the employee from one Cantonment Board to another Cantonment Board. But section 280
of the Cantonments Act which confers the power on the Central Government to make rules, did not
provide any power to frame the rules for transfer. Prior to the amendment of Clause (c) of section
280 of the Cantonment Act, the provision as stood was as under:-
"S.280 Power to make rules. - The Central Government may after previous
publication, make rules to carry out the purposes and objects of this Act.
(2) In particular, and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power, such
rules may provide for. all or any of the following matters, namely:
(a) to (bb).............
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 38
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
(c) the tenure of office, salaries and allowances, provident funds, pensions, gratuities,
leave of absence and other conditions service of servants of Boards."
Therefore, it was observed by their Lordships of the Supreme Court that clause (c) of section 280 of
the Cantonments Act, did not confer power on the Central Government to frame rules regarding
conditions of service which necessary includes the transfer of employees of the Cantonment Board.
It is held that Rule 5-C which was inserted in the Rules by a notification dated November 23, 1972,
provided for the transfer of the employees of the Cantonment Boards from one Board to another,
was on the face of it contrary to the rule making power of the Central Government and therefore, it
was amended in 1983. In these circumstances, their Lordships of the Supreme Court have come to
the conclusion that insertion of Rule 5- C was void being contrary to and excess of rule making
power of the Central Government as it contained in unamended Clause (c) of sub- section (2) of
section 280 of the Cantonments Act. In this background, their Lordships of the Supreme Court
observed in para 12 of the judgment as under:
"When Rule 5-C was inserted into the Rules, it was void as being contrary to and in
excess of the rule making power of the Central Government as contained in the
unamended clause (c) of sub-section (2) of section 280 of the Cantonments Act. It
does not become valid merely because of the amendment of clause (c), inter alia,
conferring power on the Central Government to frame rules relating to conditions of
service."
Therefore, a close reading of the aforesaid judgment would show that what primary persuaded by
their Lordships was that the rule 5-C which enables the authorities to transfer the incumbent from
one Cantonment Board to another, was unauthorised as the Act did not provide framing of such
rules and ultimately, it was found that Rule 5-C is ultra vires of the Act and the same was struck
down, though while striking down, the Lordships made the above observation.
6. But so far as the present rule is concerned, it only provides to a transfer and it does not change the
employer of the incumbent. It only lays down that the State Government has a power to send any
officer or servant of the Municipal Corporation to another on deputation, but for all purposes of
promotion and other benefits, the incumbent will be treated to be in his parent
department/Corporation, that means his lien will be kept with Corporation and he will be entitled to
a deputation allowance also. Thus, these conditions amply safe-guard the interest of the incumbent
and it would not have the effect of terminating of service of the employee in that parent Corporation.
Therefore, the reasoning of the aforesaid Judgment will not be available to the petitioners so as to
strike down provisions of sub-sections (5) and (6) of section 58 of the Act, 1988.
7. The next case in the line which has been relied on is Jawaharlal Nehru University (supra) this was
a judgment in which Assistant Professors who were serving in Jawaharlal Nehru University, were
transferred to Centre of Post Graduate Studies, Imphal established by the University at Manipur.
Subsequently, this centre was transferred to Manipur University. Syndicate of the J. N. University
provided for transfer of the Centre to the Manipur University and it was resolved that the centre will
become a part of Manipur University and it was further resolved that the member of faculty
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 39
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
employed by the Jawaharlal Nehru University, Centre of Post Graduate Studies, Imphal,
immediately before its merger into the University would on and from that date become members of
the staff of the Manipur University. This was challenged and in that context, their Lordships held
that as a matter of fact, the contract of service of the incumbent was with the Jawaharlal Nehru
University and no law can convert that contract into a contract between the incumbent and the
Manipur University without simultaneously making it, either expressly or by implication consent of
that incumbent. In that context, their Lordships quashed the services of the employees of Centre
Post Graduate studies from Jawaharlal Nehru University to Manipur University. This case is entirely
on different footings and here the employer is not sought to be changed. The employees of J. N.
University were transferred to Manipur University without their consent by express or by desire,
and that is not the case here. Here, it is only a temporary transfer and his lien will on kept with the
parent Corporation. Thus, this case also does not help the petitioner.
8. The next case which Shri Vivek Tankha has heavily relied is the decision of this Court in the case
of L.P. Sarabhai v. State of M.P., M.P. No. 387 of 79 decided on 4-7-1979. In this case sub-section (5)
of section 58 of the Act came up for consideration and was in force and that provision reads as
under:-
"Section 58(5) - The State Government may, subject to maintenance of lien on the
post held in the parent Corporation, transfer on deputation any Officer or servant of
the Corporation carrying a maximum scale of pay exceeding Rs. 400/- to any other
Municipal Corporation:
Provided that no such transfer on deputation shall be made except:-
(i) with the prior consultation of the concerned Municipal Corporation;
(ii) on the same post and in the same status;
and the terms and conditions of deputation of the Officer or servant of the Corporation including
disciplinary control shall be such as the State Government may, by general or special order, in
consultation with the Corporation concerned, specify."
This provided that the State Government can transfer any person subject to maintain the lien of the
incumbent on the post in the parent Corporation of any officer or servant carrying a maximum scale
of pay exceeding Rs. 400/- subject to condition that no transfer on deputation shall be made except
with the prior consultation of the concerned Corporation and on the same post and same status. It
further lays down that the terms and conditions of deputation of the officer or servant of the
Corporation including disciplinary control shall be such by general or special order in consultation
with the Corporation, may specify. It was observed that deputation means that a person who goes on
deputation, goes with his consent and it was further observed that lien means a right to occupy the
particular post that is the employee going on deputation, has a right to the post held in the parent
Corporation. In this back ground, their Lordships have held that the retention of lien on the post in
the parent Corporation signifies that the officer or servant concerned goes on deputation with his
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 40
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
consent and back after a period of deputation for which he agreed to go to another Corporation. But
without his consent, the order of the State Government is invalid being not in conformity with
section 58(5) of the Act. But in that case also, the Court did not strike down the provisions of section
58(5), but it was only held that no person can be sent on deputation without his consent. The
validity of this provision was not struck down but the order of transfer was struck down.
9. There is one thing to have a power and the another thing to misuse it. So far as conferring of
power by the Amendment Act, 1988 is concerned it cannot be possibly said that the Legislature was
not competent nor it could be said that it is violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of
India.
10. So far as the competent of Legislature is concerned, under entry 5, List II, Schedule VII of the
Constitution of India provides that the State Legislature is competent to legislate on this item and in
purported exercise of power, the State Legislature amend sub- sections (5) and (6) of section 58 of
the Act. Now coming to Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution, simply confirming of this power does
not violate the Articles 14 and 16. The only arbitrary exercise of power can render that order being
the violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. Therefore, in purported exercise of
this power, if any transfer has been issued which is arbitrary then the same can be struck down.
Moreso, in the present case, the lien of the incumbent is retained in his parent post and his benefits
have also been safeguarded.
10(a). Moreso, all the Corporations receive sufficient grant from the State Government and State
exercise the supervisory control over all Corporations. Part IX, Chapter XXXVI of the Act gives a
controlling power to the State Government. As such the Government can exercise this power. This
Chapter deals with the control and supervision of the Government. When the Government has an
extensive control over the working of the Corporation and it can certainly exercise the power of
transfer of incumbent from one Corporation to another. This is a very important feature which was
not come up in any of the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court cited by Shri Vivek Tankha,
learned counsel for the petitioners and this aspect was also not considered in the case of Sarabhai
(supra). Once the power has been conferred by the Legislature by enacting the valid law then the law
cannot be rendered invalid because of improper exercise of power. Their Lordships of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court have also made a distinction between the competence to enact the law and improper
exercise of the same. Their Lordships of the Hon. Supreme Court in D. K. Trivedi v. State of Gujarat,
AIR 1986 SC 1323, Para 50 observed as under:
"Where a statute confers discretionary powers upon the executive or an
administrative authority, the validity or constitutionality of such power cannot be
judged on the assumption that the executive or such authority will act in an arbitrary
manner in the exercise of the discretion conferred upon it. If the executive or the
administrative authority acts in an arbitrary manner, its action would be bad in law
and liable to be struck down by the Courts but the possibility of abuse of power or
arbitrary exercise of power cannot invalidate the statute conferring the power or the
power which has been conferred by it."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 41
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
It is clear that simply because a power is capable of being misused or in arbitrary manner by
executive is no ground to hold that is liable to be struck down by the courts. Similarly in the case of
Mehmood Alam Tariq v. State of Rajasthan, AIR 1988 SC 1451, their Lordships observed as para 11
of the judgment as under:
"It is important to keep in mind that in this case the results of the viva voce
examination are not assailed on grounds of mala fides or bias etc. The challenge to
the results of the viva voce is purely as a consequence and incident of the challenge to
the vires of the rule. It is also necessary to reiterate that a mere possibility of abuse of
a provision does not, by itself, justify its invalidation. The validity of a provision must
be tested with reference to its operation and efficacy in the generality of cases and not
by the freaks or exceptions that is application might in some rare cases possibly
produce. The affairs of Government cannot be conducted on principles of distrust. If
the selectors had acted mala fide or with oblique motives, there are administrative
Law remedies to secure reliefs against such abuse of powers. Abuse vitiates any
power."
11. In this back ground, we are of the view that section 58(5) and (6) of the Act are not ultra vires
and it is valid. But this power should be exercised with great caution and while transferring the
employee from one Corporation to another, there should be a valid reason. Since the lien of
incumbent is kept in the parent Corporation, therefore, tenure or the period of lien should be
specified and it should not be for all time to come. The State Government should also exercise this
power very sparingly in exceptional case as observed by their Lordships of the Supreme Court in
State of M.P. v. Shankerlal (supra) as quoted above."
50. Thus, it is clear that transfer on deputation is a temporary transfer of an employee from his
parent department to another department , against equivalent post from one cadre to another, for a
limited period. Such employee will hold lien on his substantive post held by him in his parent
department and he cannot claim any right to remain on transfer on deputation and has no legal
right to be absorbed in the post to which he is deputed. Similarly, deputation means that service
outside the cadre i.e., to another department on temporary basis. After the expiry of his term, he has
to come back to his parent department to occupy the same position which he was holding at the time
of his deputation.
51. Furthermore, in the case of Indore Nagar Nigam Karamchari Congress (Supra) the Full Bench of
this Court while upholding the vires of Section 58(5) and (6) of Municipal Corporation Act, has held
that such power should be exercised with caution and sparingly for valid reasons as well as the
tenure and period of lien should be specifically mentioned and it should not be for all times to come.
52. Even otherwise, it was also argued by Shri M.P.S. Raghuvanshi, Senior Advocate, that if a person
is sent on deputation/ transfer on deputation, then as a deputationist he will not be holding any
regular post.
53. Rule 110 of M.P. Fundamental Rules read as under :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 42
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
F.R. 110. Authorities competent to transfer a Government ser- vant to foreign
service.-(a) No Government servant may be transferred to foreign service against his
will:
Provided that this sub-rule shall not apply to the transfer of a Government servant to
the service of a body, incorporated or not, which is wholly or substantially owned or
controlled by the Government.]
(b) A transfer to foreign service outside India may be sanctioned by the
Governor-General in Council.
Note.-The Government of Madras is authorized to transfer to service in Ceylon any Government
servant other than a member of an All India Service.
(c) Subject to any restriction which the Governor-General in Council may be general order impose in
the case of transfer to the service of an Indian State, a transfer to foreign service in India may be
sanctioned by the Local Government under which the Government servant transferred is serving.
54. Rule 9(7) of M.P. Fundamental Rules read as under :
"Foreign Service" means service in which a Government servant receives his pay with
the sanction of government from any source other than the Consolidated Fund of
India or the Consolidated Fund of any state or the Consolidated Fund of a Union
Territory.
55. Lien has been defined under Rule 9(13) of Fundamental Rules which reads as under :
"(13) "Lien" means the title of a Government servant to hold substantively, either
immediately or on the termination of a period or periods of absence, a permanent
post including a tenure post, to which he has been appointed substantively."
56. Thus, it is clear that power of transfer on deputation has to be exercised very sparingly and
cautiously. This must be in the public interest only. Furthermore as required under Section 58(6) of
M.P. Municipal Corporation Act, the Govt. must point out the period and transfer on deputation
cannot be for all time to come. Even if person is sent by transfer on deputation, still that person will
be holding his lien on his substantive post in the parent department. Furthermore, before sending a
person on transfer by deputation, the consent of the parent department as well as borrowing
department should also be taken apart from the consent of the employee.
Colourable Exercise of Power
57. The Supreme Court in the case of State of Tamil Nadu and others Vs. K. Shyam Sunder and
others reported in (2011) 8 SCC 737 has held as under :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 43
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
II. Colourable legislation
36. In State of Punjab v. Gurdial Singh, this Court held that when power is exercised
in bad faith to attain ends beyond the sanctioned purposes of power by simulation or
pretension of gaining a legitimate goal, it is called colourable exercise of power.
The action becomes bad where the true object is to reach an end different from the one for which the
power is entrusted, guided by an extraneous consideration, whether good or bad but irrelevant to
the entrustment. When the custodian of power is influenced in exercise of its power by
considerations outside those for promotion of which the power is vested, the action becomes bad for
the reason that power has not been exercised bona fide for the end design.
58. The Supreme Court in the case of G. Jayalal Vs. Union of India reported in (2013) 7 SCC 150 has
held as under :
17.....In this context, we may refer with profit to the decision in State of A.P. v.
Goverdhanlal Pitti wherein this Court has ruled thus : (SCC p. 744, paras 12-13) "12.
... 'Legal malice' or 'malice in law' means 'something done without lawful excuse'. In
other words, 'it is an act done wrongfully and wilfully without reasonable or probable
cause, and not necessarily an act done from ill feeling and spite. It is a deliberate act
in disregard of the rights of others'. (See Words and Phrases Legally Defined, 3rd
Edn., London Butterworths, 1989.)
13. Where malice is attributed to the State, it can never be a case of personal ill-will or
spite on the part of the State. If at all it is malice in legal sense, it can be described as
an act which is taken with an oblique or indirect object."
A similar view has been expressed in W.B. SEB v. Dilip Kumar Ray and Kalabharati Advertising v.
Hemant Vimalnath Narichania.
59. The Supreme Court in the case of State of Punjab Vs. Gurdial Singh reported in (1980) 2 SCC 471
has held as under :
9. The question, then, is what is mala fides in the jurisprudence of power? Legal
malice is gibberish unless juristic clarity keeps it separate from the popular concept
of personal vice. Pithily put, bad faith which invalidates the exercise of power --
sometimes called colourable exercise or fraud on power and oftentimes overlaps
motives, passions and satisfactions -- is the attainment of ends beyond the
sanctioned purposes of power by simulation or pretension of gaining a legitimate
goal. If the use of the power is for the fulfilment of a legitimate object the actuation or
catalysation by malice is not legicidal. The action is bad where the true object is to
reach an end different from the one for which the power is entrusted, goaded by
extraneous considerations, good or bad, but irrelevant to the entrustment. When the
custodian of power is influenced in its exercise by considerations outside those for
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 44
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
promotion of which the power is vested the court calls it a colourable exercise and is
undeceived by illusion. In a broad, blurred sense, Benjamin Disraeli was not off the
mark even in law when he stated: "I repeat . . . that all power is a trust -- that we are
accountable for its exercise -- that, from the people, and for the people, all springs,
and all must exist". Fraud on power voids the order if it is not exercised bona fide for
the end designed. Fraud in this context is not equal to moral turpitude and embraces
all cases in which the action impugned is to effect some object which is beyond the
purpose and intent of the power, whether this be malice-laden or even benign. If the
purpose is corrupt the resultant act is bad. If considerations, foreign to the scope of
the power or extraneous to the statute, enter the verdict or impel the action, mala
fides or fraud on power vitiates the acquisition or other official act.
60. The Supreme Court in the case of State of Assam Vs. Banshidhar Shewbhagawan and Company
reported in (1981) 4 SCC 283 has held as under:
8.....There can be no doubt that if any authority exercised any power conferred on
him by law in bad faith or for collateral purpose, it is an abuse of power and a fraud
on the statute. In such a case there can be no difficulty in striking down that act of the
authority by the issue of an appropriate writ under Article 226 of the
Constitution...........
61. The Supreme Court in the case of Bajirao T. Kote v. State of Maharashtra, reported in (1995) 2
SCC 442has held as under :
4........ That exception is that if there is a colourable exercise of power the declaration
will be open to challenge at the instance of the aggrieved party. If it appears that what
the Government is satisfied about is not a public purpose but a private purpose or no
purpose at all, the action of the Government would be colourable as not being
relatable to the power conferred upon it by the Act and its declaration will be a
nullity........
62. Thus, when the power is conferred on the authority, but that power is exercised for a purpose
different from what was intended under the law, then it would necessarily mean that such act is bad
on account of colourable exercise of power.
Whether an employee who was allotted particular Municipal Corporation or employee of Municipal
Council can be transferred or they are required to be sent on deputation/ transfer on deputation
only
63. A specific question was put to the Counsel for the parties, that an employee who was allotted
particular Municipal Corporation after undergoing a centralized recruitment process or a person
who is an employee of Municipal Council, can be transferred to Municipal Corporation, Gwalior or
he should have been sent by transfer on deputation.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 45
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
64. It was fairly conceded by Counsel for the State and respondent no. 5, that such an employee can
be send to the Municipal Corporation, Gwalior only by way of deputation/ transfer on deputation
and even if he is transferred, still he has to be treated as a transfer by deputation.
What is the authority of the State Govt. to send the employees to Municipal Corporation, Gwalior on
deputation/transfer on deputation?
65. As already pointed out, the State Govt. can send the employee on deputation by exercising its
power under Section 58(3) and (5) of M.P. Municipal Corporation Act, but as held by Full Bench of
this Court in the case of Indore Nagar Nigam Karamchari Congress (Supra), such power has to be
exercised very sparingly and cautiously and it should be only in public interest and not otherwise.
Furthermore, deputation or transfer on deputation must be for a limited period and not for all time
to come and the period of transfer on deputation / deputation should also be mentioned in the
order. Recommendations made by Ministers
66. While the case was being argued, the Counsel for the State read out the records of those
employees which were available with him. From some of the records, it is clear that the proceedings
for sending an employee on deputation/transfer on deputation were initiated on the
recommendation of Ministers. It is submitted by Shri M.P.S. Raghuvanshi that since, none of the
Minister has been impleaded, therefore, malafide cannot be considered in absence of a person
against whom the allegations of malafide are being made.
67. Now the only question for consideration is that whether recommendation made by Minister by
itself would make the order of deputation/ transfer on deputation bad, or the order of deputation
has to pass the test laid down by Full Bench of this Court in the case of Indore Nagar Nigam
Karamchari Congress (Supra).
68. The Supreme Court in the case of Mohd. Masood Ahmad v. State of U.P. ,reported in (2007) 8
SCC 150 has held as under :
8. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the impugned transfer order of
the appellant from Muzaffarnagar to Mawana, District Meerut was made at the
instance of an MLA. On the other hand, it has been stated in the counter-affidavit
filed on behalf of Respondents 1 and 2 that the appellant has been transferred due to
complaints against him. In our opinion, even if the allegation of the appellant is
correct that he was transferred on the recommendation of an MLA, that by itself
would not vitiate the transfer order. After all, it is the duty of the representatives of
the people in the legislature to express the grievances of the people and if there is any
complaint against an official the State Government is certainly within its jurisdiction
to transfer such an employee. There can be no hard-and-fast rule that every transfer
at the instance of an MP or MLA would be vitiated. It all depends on the facts and
circumstances of an individual case. In the present case, we see no infirmity in the
impugned transfer order.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 46
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
69. Therefore, it is clear that where a proceeding has been initiated on the basis of recommendation
made by Minister, then the State has to establish that order of deputation/transfer on deputation,
which was passed on the recommendation of Minister was in the public interest, for limited period
as well as it was passed after considering the case cautiously. However, sending a person on
deputation/transfer on deputation, on mere recommendation of Minister would not serve the
purpose and such order would be bad in law.
70. So far the submission made by Shri M.P.S. Raghuvanshi, that since none of the Minister has
been impleaded in the writ petition as respondents therefore, the recommendations made by
Minister cannot be scrutinised is concerned, the same is misconceived and is hereby rejected.
71. As already held, a recommendation made by Minister cannot be said to be a malafide action.
Passing of an order of deputation/transfer on deputation without any public interest would amount
to colourable exercise of power. Therefore, non-impleadment of Minister by itself would not be an
impediment in examining the orders of deputation/transfer on deputation passed by the State or by
State authorities.
Whether the State Govt. can send the employees to the Municipal Corporation, Gwalior in
contravention of Rules 2000?
72. None of the Counsel for the parties, argued that the State Govt. can act contrary to what is
provided under Rules 2000. As already pointed, the only half hearted argument raised by Shri Dixit
was that there is no sanctioned strength, therefore, the Rules 2000 cannot be implemented, but Shri
Dixit did not argue as to whether the State Govt. would get unfettered and uncontrolled right to send
any person on deputation in contravention of Rules 2000.
73. Although it was argued by Shri M.P.S. Raghuvanshi, that by sending four Additional
Commissioners, the State Govt. did not commit any mistake because proposal to enhance the
sanctioned strength of the Add. Commissioner is already under consideration, but the said
argument cannot be accepted.
74. The power to enhance the total number of sanctioned posts, rest with the State Govt. and
admittedly, the State Govt. has not accepted the proposal so far and has not enhanced the
sanctioned strength of Additional Commissioner from 2 to 4. Once, the State Govt. itself has not
enhanced the total number of sanctioned posts of Add. Commissioner, then four Add.
Commissioners against two sanctioned posts out of which only one can be filled by deputation
cannot be send. Thus, in absence of any power of the State Govt. to act contrary to the Rules, 2000,
it is held that the State Govt. cannot act contrary to the provisions of Rules 2000, and cannot send
the employees on deputation/transfer on deputation in excess of what is provided under the Rules,
2000 or to such posts which cannot be filled up by deputation/transfer of deputation.
75. Even if there is any shortage of employees, then the State Govt. should have insisted the
Municipal Corporation, Gwalior to fill up the posts by regular appointment/promotion, but could
not have send the employees on deputation/transfer on deputation contrary to the Rules, 2000 and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 47
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
that too, without prescribing any period of deputation/transfer on deputation.
Whether eligibility or suitability of the employees who have been sent on deputation can be
considered by this Court?
76. The Supreme Court in the case of Rajesh Awasthi v. Nand Lal Jaiswal, reported in (2013) 1 SCC
501 has held as under :
19. A writ of quo warranto will lie when the appointment is made contrary to the
statutory provisions. This Court in Mor Modern Coop.
Transport Society Ltd. v. Govt. of Haryana held that a writ of quo warranto can be issued when
appointment is contrary to the statutory provisions. In B. Srinivasa Reddy, this Court has reiterated
the legal position that the jurisdiction of the High Court to issue a writ of quo warranto is limited to
one which can only be issued if the appointment is contrary to the statutory rules. The said position
has been reiterated by this Court in Hari Bansh Lal wherein this Court has held that for the issuance
of writ of quo warranto, the High Court has to satisfy itself that the appointment is contrary to the
statutory rules.
* * * *
22. We fully agree with the learned Senior Counsel for the appellant that suitability of a candidate
for appointment does not fall within the realm of writ of quo warranto and there cannot be any
quarrel with that legal proposition. The learned Senior Counsel also submitted that, assuming that
the Selection Committee had not discharged its functions under sub-section (5) of Section 85 of the
Act, it was only an omission which could be cured by giving a direction to the Selection Committee
to comply with the requirement of sub-section (5) of Section 85 of the Act. The learned Senior
Counsel submitted that since it is a curable irregularity, a writ of quo warranto be not issued since
issuing of writ of quo warranto is within the discretion of the court. The learned Senior Counsel
made reference to the judgment of the Court in R. v. Speyer.
77. The Supreme Court in the case of B. Srinivasa Reddy v. Karnataka Urban Water Supply &
Drainage Board Employees' Assn., reported in (2006) 11 SCC 731 has held asunder :
Writ of quo warranto
43. Whether a writ of quo warranto lies to challenge an appointment made "until
further orders" on the ground that it is not a regular appointment? Whether the High
Court failed to follow the settled law that a writ of quo warranto cannot be issued
unless there is a clear violation of law? The order appointing the appellant clearly
stated that the appointment is until further orders. The terms and conditions of
appointment made it clear that the appointment is temporary and is until further
orders. In such a situation, the High Court, in our view, erred in law in issuing a writ
of quo warranto the rights under Article 226 which can be enforced only by an
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 48
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
aggrieved person except in the case where the writ prayed for is for habeas corpus.
44. In the instant case, the power to appoint the Managing Director of the Board is
vested in the Board under Section 4(2) of the Act.
Neither the Act nor the Rules prescribed any mode of appointment or tenure of appointment. When
the mode of appointment, tenure of appointment have been left to the discretion of the Government
by the Act and the Rules, and the Act makes it clear that the Managing Director shall hold office at
the pleasure of the Government, the High Court could not have fettered the discretion of the
Government by holding that Section 4(2) of the Act does not expressly give the power to the State
Government to make ad hoc or contractual appointment. When the Act and the statutory Rules have
not prescribed any definite term and any particular mode, the High Court could not have read into
the statute a restriction or prohibition that is not expressly prohibited by the Act and the Rules. It is
well settled that when the statute does not lay down the method of appointment or term of
appointment and when the Act specifies that the appointment is one of sure tenure, the appointing
authority who has the power to appoint has absolute discretion in the matter and it cannot be said
that discretion to appoint does not include the power to appoint on contract basis. An appointment
which is temporary remains temporary and does not become permanent with the passage of time.
The finding recorded by the learned Single Judge that the appointment is bad for the reason that the
appointment which was made on temporary basis has continued for nearly 2 years is wholly
contrary to law particularly when the Act and the Rules do not stipulate maximum period of
appointment. The High Court, in our view, gravely erred in issuing a writ of quo warranto when
there is no clear violation of law in the appointment of the appellant.
45. The official memorandum dated 23-12-1994 on a plain reading of it applies only to government
servants. It has no manner of application to the employees or servants of the statutory boards. The
appellant is not a retired government servant. His appointment as Managing Director of the Board
is not a post in government service. The High Court has erred in law in applying the said official
memorandum to the appointment of the appellant which is governed only by the Act and the Rules.
Even otherwise the High Court has failed to appreciate that the official memorandum running
counter to the statutory provisions is ineffective and at any event cannot be enforced in a quo
warranto proceedings.
46. The appellant joined the services of the State in the public health engineering segment of its
Power Works Department in the year 1967. From the time the Karnataka Urban Water Supply and
Drainage Board was established in the year 1975, he has been working in the Board having initially
been appointed to its services as Assistant Engineer, thereafter, absorbed in its services and by his
consistent good performance and unblemished record reached the post of Chief Engineer of the
Board. He has apart from about 34 years of experience in development, establishment, maintenance
and management of drinking water and drainage facilities in the urban areas has undergone several
training programmes abroad in planning, appraisal, implementation of water and sanitation
projects and management of development programmes for senior public health engineers.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 49
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
47. Section 4(2) of the Act, 1973 mandates that the Managing Director shall possess the prescribed
qualification and he shall be appointed by the Government. Rule 3 of the Karnataka Urban Water
Supply and Drainage Board Rules, 1974 prescribes the qualification for appointment of the
Managing Director in these words:
"3. ... The Managing Director shall be a person having experience in administration
and capacity in commercial matters."
48. There was not even a pleading that the appellant does not have experience in administration and
capacity in commercial matters. The appointment of the appellant has been made by the
Government in exercise of powers conferred on it by Section 4(2) of the Act. The High Court does
not dispute the power of the Government to make the appointment. Mr Raju Ramachandran,
learned Senior Counsel for the Union does not dispute the power of the Government to make
contractual appointment. A perusal of the judgment of the High Court would only go to show that
the High Court did not record any finding that the appellant does not possess the qualification
prescribed by the Act and the Rules. The disqualifications for appointment as a Director of the
Board are set out in Section 7 of the Act. The only disqualification that the appellant suffered was
under
Section 7(1)(d) of the Act. He being an employee of the Board, this disqualification
disappeared on 31-1-2004 when the appellant retired from service of the Board on
superannuation. The High Court having regard to the technical nature of quo
warranto proceedings could not have ousted the appellant from the office on the
ground of an inapplicable qualification prescribed by administrative instruction
dated 23-12-1994 which had no manner of application for appointment to the post of
Managing Director of the Board.
49. The law is well settled. The High Court in exercise of its writ jurisdiction in a matter of this
nature is required to determine, at the outset, as to whether a case has been made out for issuance of
a writ of quo warranto. The jurisdiction of the High Court to issue a writ of quo warranto is a limited
one which can only be issued when the appointment is contrary to the statutory rules.
78. The Supreme Court in the case of Centre for Public Interest Litigation v. Union of India,
reported in (2005) 8 SCC 202 has held as under ::
16. The basic question is whether the appointment of Respondent 3 as Chief
Secretary is proper.
17. Learned counsel for Respondents 2 and 3 have submitted that as back as on
17-4-2004 Respondent 3 was promoted to the Chief Secretary's grade with a
particular scale of pay. Since Respondent 3 belonged to the said cadre and grade, one
of the posts on which she could be appointed is the post of Chief Secretary. Therefore,
there is nothing wrong in her appointment. Though the post of Chief Secretary may
belong to a particular grade/cadre, it is certainly a key post. The importance of this
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 50
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
post was noted by this Court in E.P. Royappa v. State of T.N.5
18. The argument presently advanced is that since Respondent 3 has been continuing
in the post for five months, no orders should be passed regarding her appointment
till the Commission gives its report.
Had this consideration weighed with the State Government when it made the appointment there
may not have been any difficulty. It could have, considering the importance of the post, awaited the
report of the Commission headed by Mr Justice K.T. Thomas. It is not the case of Respondent 2, the
State of U.P. that no other officer is suitable to hold that post or that the services of Respondent 3
are so indispensable that none but she should be appointed as the Chief Secretary. This is purely a
case of justifying an action. Linked with it is the question of transparency in action. It is true that the
allegations against Respondent 3 have to be established. It is often said that justice should not only
be done but it should appear to have been done. Lord Denning in Metropolitan Properties Co. v.
Lannon6said : (All ER p. 310 D) "Justice must be rooted in confidence; and confidence is destroyed
when right-minded people go away thinking:'The Judge was biased." The logic is equally applicable
to governmental action and the Government. The State Government could have avoided the washing
of dirty linen which as contended by learned counsel for Respondents 2 and 3 is the sole object of
the writ petition.
19. We do not think it necessary to delve into the question of maintainability of the writ petition as
the same, as noted at the threshold appears to be an offshoot of the earlier petition.
20. The time has come when the postings of officers holding sensitive posts should be done in
transparent manner giving no scope for any grievance. It is true that grievances can be made or
allegations can be levelled for ulterior motive or with the intention of damaging the reputation of an
officer who is likely to be appointed in a sensitive post, very often at the behest of persons angling
for the post. In the peculiar background facts it was really desirable for the State Government to
steer clear of controversy and not to post Respondent 3 as the Chief Secretary. By doing it, it has
unnecessarily created further complications and invited criticism. We, therefore, direct the State
Government to transfer Respondent 3 to some other post in the cadre/grade to which she belonged.
The question of her suitability tobe included in the cadre/grade, shall be examined in the writ
petition itself. For the present, we do not express any opinion on that issue. The necessary steps for
effectuating our order shall be taken within seven days. We make it clear that we have not expressed
any opinion on the merits of the allegations as the matter is pending before the High Court and
Justice Thomas Commission.
79. Thus, where a person is posted on a post for which he is not holding the minimum qualification,
then a writ of quo warranto can be issued. However, this Court cannot consider the suitability of a
person. Thus, in nutshell, this Court can consider the eligibility but not suitability.
Whether the action of the State Govt. in sending the employees on deputation/ transfer on
deputation to Municipal Corporation is result of Colourable exercise of power or not?
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 51
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
80. This aspect shall be considered by considering the case of each and every private respondent
independently.
81. At the outset, it is pointed out that the State Counsel has submitted that files of only 30 persons
pertaining to their deputation/ transfer on deputation have been received and the files of other
persons have not been sent.
82. This Court by order dated 16-4-2025 had also directed as under :
44. At the cost of repetition, respondents No.1 and 3 are also specifically directed to
file detailed reply in respect of each and every person who has been sent on
"deputation/deputation by transfer"
including the question as to why some of them have been sent on deputation in
excess of sanctioned strength and why some of them have been sent on deputation
where Rule does not provide for filling up the post by deputation.
45. The State Government is also directed to clarify that why persons who have been
sent on deputation are not interested in serving their parent department and why
persons are interested in getting themselves transferred to Municipal Corporation,
Gwalior on deputation.
83. Thus, while considering the case of each and every private respondent, the aforesaid aspect shall
be kept in mind.

Dr. Anuj Sharma, Veterinary Doctor, sent on deputation on the post of Heath Officer
85. It is submitted by Counsel for the respondent no.6/Dr. Anuj Sharma, that this Court by order
dated 13-3-2025, had directed that the respondent no.6 be immediately relived from the post of
Health Officer and accordingly, he was relieved and he has also joined on his substantive post i.e.,
Veterinary Doctor. Thereafter by order dated 19-3-2025 and detailed order dated 16-4-2025, it has
already been held that respondent no. 6 was not competent to be sent on deputation to the post of
Health Officer. It is submitted that the respondent no. 6 doesnot wish to add anything more
specifically when the State Govt. has also admitted on 16-4-2025, that respondent no. 6 was not
holding minimum qualification for the post of Health officer/Sanitary Officer.
86. Since, the Counsel for the respondent no. 6 did not submit any supplementary arguments to
justify his deputation on the post of Health Officer, in Municipal Corporation, Gwalior, therefore,
his order of deputation dated 18- 8-2023 by which he was sent on deputation is hereby Quashed.
Since, the respondent no. 6 has already joined in his parent department, therefore, no more
direction in respect of Dr. Anuj Sharma is required, although he did not answer several queries
which were raised by this Court by different orders, which have already been reproduced. It is
suffice to mention here that the order of deputation was passed by ignoring that even the Municipal
Corporation, Gwalior in its NOC had specifically pointed out that the minimum qualification for the
post of Health Officer is MBBS. Even the eligibility of Dr. Anuj Sharma to hold the office of Health
Officer has already been considered by previous order and it has been found that he was not eligible
to hold the post of Health Officer, which otherwise is a non-existing post. Thus, the order of
deputation of respondent no. 6 is also bad on account of colourable exercise of power by the State,
as no public interest has also been pointed out. Commissioner Sangh Priy, Commissioner, Municipal
Corporation, Gwalior
87. The Counsel for the State submitted that the record pertaining to posting of Shri Sangh Priy, as
Commissioner, Municipal Corporation has been received and provided only a copy of order of
transfer of various officers, including Shri Sangh Priy. It was specifically submitted by the Counsel
for the State that before issuing the posting/transfer order of Sangh Priy, no order under Section 54
of Municipal Corporation Act was passed.
88. Section 54 of Municipal Corporation Act, reads as under :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 57
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
54. Appointment and removal of Commissioner.- (1) The Commissioner for the
Corporation shall be appointed by the Government for a renewable period not
exceeding five years.
(2) It shall be forthwith removed from office if at a meeting of the Corporation not less than
three-fourths of the total number of elected councilors vote in favour of a proposition in this behalf;
and he may be removed by the Government at any time if it appears to the Government that he is
incapable of performing the duties of his office or has been guilty of any mis-conduct or neglect
which renders his removal expedient:
Provided that when the Commissioner holds a lien on any post under the
Government, he may recalled at any time by the Government.
89. Thus, it is clear that Commissioner can be appointed for a renewable period not exceeding 5
years.
90. Shri Sangh Priy, Commissioner, Municipal Corporation, Gwalior has filed his response. In his
response, he has filed a copy of the order dated of transfer dated 27-1-2025. It is a general transfer
order of various persons including Shri Sangh Priy. It is no where mentioned that transfer/posting
of Sangh Priy as Commissioner is as per the provisions of Section 54 of Municipal Corporation Act.
Furthermore, the word appointment has not been used in order dated 27-1- 2025. Since, it is
admitted by the Counsel for the State that no note sheet, which may indicate that the appointment
of Shri Sangh Priy as Commissioner, Municipal Corporation was considered, therefore, it is clear
that the State Govt. has issued the transfer order of Shri Sangh Priy in a routine manner, without
realising that a Commissioner can be appointed under Section 54 of Municipal Corporation Act.
Thus, it is held that the transfer of Shri Sangh Priy, as Commissioner, Municipal Corporation,
Gwalior was not under Section 54 of Municipal Corporation Act.
91. Therefore, the order dated 27-1-2025 so far as it relates to transfer of Shri Sangh Priy, as
Commissioner, Municipal Corporation, Gwalior is hereby Quashed.
92. However, this order of quashment shall remain suspended for a period of 15 days from today, to
enable the State Govt to appoint Commissioner, in Municipal Corporation, Gwalior in accordance
with provisions of Section 54 of Municipal Corporation Act. Needless to mention that this order of
quashment shall automatically come into force if a fresh order under Section 54 of Municipal
Corporation Act is not passed within a period of 15 days from today.
Additional Commissioners
93. As per the set up, two posts of Additional Commissioners are there in the Municipal
Corporation, Gwalior. As per Rules, 2000, 50% of the sanctioned strength has to be filled up by
promotion and 50% by deputation. Thus, it is clear that only 2 sanctioned posts of Additional
Commissioner, only one can be filled up by deputation, whereas the State Govt. has sent four
Additional Commissioners on deputation. Therefore, it is clear that at least 3 Additional
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 58
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
Commissioners have been sent on deputation contrary to Rules 2000.
94. The contention of the Counsel for the respondents that the proposal to increase the total number
of posts to Add. Commissioner to 4 is pending, therefore, if 4 Add. Commissioners have been sent by
the State on deputation, then no illegality has been committed.
95. Considered the aforesaid contention.
96. As already pointed out in previous paragraph, that proposal to enhance the number of
sanctioned posts of Add. Commissioner to four is pending with the State Govt. It is the State Govt.
who has not approved the proposal. If the State Govt. was of the view that the number of sanctioned
posts can be increased from 2 to 4, then it could have done so. But that has not been done by the
State Govt. Therefore, it cannot be said that State Govt. can send four persons on deputation to the
post of Add. Commissioner in anticipation of an increase in number of sanctioned posts. The State
Govt. cannot act in anticipation, because the decision to increase the number of sanctioned posts is
to be taken by State itself, which has not been done. Thus, what cannot be done directly, can also not
be done indirectly on the pretext that the State Govt. is anticipating that it may increase the number
of sanctioned posts.
97. Further more, as per Rules 2000, 50% of the sanctioned posts are to be filled up by promotion
and 50% by deputation. Even assuming that the State Govt. had sent persons on deputation under
misconception of fact, then still it is clear that it could have send two persons on the post of Add.
Commissioner (if the sanctioned strength is treated to be 4). Thus in any circumstance, 4 persons
cannot be send on deputation as Add. Commissioner.
(i) Smt. Rajni Shukla, Add. Commissioner
98. The State has not produced the record of Smt. Rajni Shukla pertaining to her deputation.
99. During the Course of arguments it was claimed by Counsel for Smt. Rajni Shukla, that Smt.
Rajni Shukla has no personal interest in getting herself posted in Gwalior. However, the said stand
taken by Smt. Rajni Shukla is not correct. According to Counsel for Smt. Rajni Shukla, in the year
2018, Smt. Rajni Shukla was sent on deputation to the office of Commissioner, Land Record and
Settlement and thereafter, she was sent on deputation to Municipal Corporation, Gwalior on
7-2-2022. Although it is submitted by Shri Gaurav Mishra, Counsel for respondent no. 5, that Rules,
2000 permits that one officer of Financial department can be sent on deputation, and Smt. Rajni
Shukla is an officer of Finance Department, but the only question for consideration is that whether
order of deputation of Smt. Rajni Shukla was in public interest or not?
100. Since, the State has not provided the record pertaining to deputation of Smt. Rajni Shukla,
therefore, it is not clear that whether any consent was given by lending department as well as
borrowing department or not? What were the considerations for sending Smt. Rajni Shukla on
deputation to the post of Add. Commissioner, Municipal Corporation, Gwalior is also not known.
Why Smt. Rajni Shukla is interested in staying back in Gwalior by remaining on deputation in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 59
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
different departments i.e., earlier in the office of Commissioner, Land Records and Settlement and
now in Municipal Corporation, Gwalior?
101. Once an officer is appointed in a particular department, then he/she should serve the said
department only and only in exceptional circumstance and that too if it is in the public interest, the
employee should be send to another department on deputation, but it appears that the State Govt.
and the employees are treating deputation as a convenient method to get the posting in another
department of his/her choice. That cannot be the very purpose of concept of deputation.
102. Thus it is clear that the deputation of Smt. Rajni Shukla in Municipal Corporation, Gwalior on
the post of Add. Commissioner is without any public interest and it appears that She has been sent
on deputation merely to oblige her. Therefore, the action of State Govt. in sending Smt. Rajni Shukla
on deputation is malafide being product of colourable exercise of power. Therefore, the deputation
of Smt. Rajni Shukla on the post of Add. Commissioner, Municipal Corporation, Gwalior is hereby
Quashed. It is directed that Smt. Rajni Shukla be immediately relieved from the post of Add.
Commissioner, Municipal Corporation, Gwalior, and She should immediately report back to her
parent department.
(ii) Shri Vijay Raj, Add. Commissioner.
103. The record pertaining to the deputation of Shri Vijay Raj has not been produced. It was
submitted by Counsel for State that on account of fire in the Vallabh Bhavan on 8-5-2024, the file
pertaining to Shri Vijay Raj has burnt. However, no document has been filed to substantiate this
submission. Therefore, it is held that the State Govt. has deliberately suppressed the file.
104. Shri Vijay Raj, in his reply to the Show Cause Notice has submitted that his substantive post is
Add. Collector. He has further stated that even in other Municipal Corporations, officers in excess of
sanctioned strength have been posted.
105. During the course of arguments, it was accepted by Counsel for Vijay Raj, that earlier he was
posted as S.D.M., Lashkar, Gwalior from 2014 to 2018 and thereafter in the year 2021 he was
promoted to the post of Additional Collector and by order dated 14-2-2023, he was sent on
deputation to Municipal Corporation, Gwalior.
106. Since, the State has not provided the record pertaining to deputation of Shri Vijay Raj,
therefore, it is not clear that whether any consent was given by lending department as well as
borrowing department or not? What were the considerations for sending Shri Vijay Raj on
deputation to the post of Add. Commissioner, Municipal Corporation, Gwalior is also not known.
107. Once an officer is appointed in a particular department, then he/she should serve the said
department only and only in exceptional circumstance and that too if it is in the public interest, the
employee should be send to another department on deputation, but it appears that the State Govt.
and the employees are treating deputation as a convenient method to get the posting in another
department of his/her choice. That cannot be the very purpose of concept of deputation.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 60
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
108. Thus it is clear that the deputation of Shri Vijay Raj in Municipal Corporation, Gwalior on the
post of Add. Commissioner is without any public interest and it appears that he has been sent on
deputation merely to oblige him. Therefore, the action of State Govt. in sending Shri Vijay Raj on
deputation is malafide being product of colourable exercise of power. Thus, in the light of judgment
passed by Full Bench of this Court in the case of Indore Nagar Nigam Karamchari Congress (Supra),
the deputation order is the product of colourable exercise of power. Therefore, the deputation of
Shri Vijay Raj on the post of Add. Commissioner, Municipal Corporation, Gwalior is hereby
Quashed. It is directed that Shri Vijay Raj be immediately relieved from the post of Add.
Commissioner, Municipal Corporation, Gwalior, and he should immediately report back to his
parent department.
(iii) Shri Munish Sikarwar, Add. Commissioner.
109. The State Govt. has produced the record of Shri Munish Sikarwar pertaining to his deputation
to the post of Add. Commissioner, which contains the proposal for transfer of various persons
including Shri Munish Sikarwar.Thus, it is clear that Shri Munish Sikarwar was transferred along
with other officers by order dated 23-2-2024. Therefore, there were no considerations and
deliberations before sending Shri Munish Sikarwar on deputation/transfer on deputation to the post
of Add. Commissioner. It is also not known as to whether the consent of the lending department as
well as borrowing department was obtained or not?
110. Shri Munish Sikarwar has filed his response and has stated that by order dated 28-2-2022, he
was promoted to the post of Add. Collector. Thereafter, he was transferred to Gwalior to the post of
Add. Collector, Gwalior and by order dated 23-2-2024, he was transferred to the post of Add.
Commissioner, Municipal Corporation, Gwalior.
111. It is clear that Shri Munish Sikarwar, was transferred and not sent on deputation to the post of
Add. Commissioner, as he was transferred by order dated 23-2-2024, by which several officers were
transferred within their own cadre. How Shri Munish Sikarwar, could have been sent on transfer to
the post of Add. Commissioner, Gwalior has not been clarified by any body. Whether the case of Shri
Munish Sikarwar for sending him on deputation was ever considered by the State Govt. or not is also
not clear. Whether any consent was obtained from his parent department as well as borrowing
department or not is also not clear. The State Govt. has filed its return vide Document No.
4644/2025 and except pleading that State Govt. has authority to issue the deputation order under
Section 58(3)(5) of Municipal Corporation Act, nothing has been stated in respect of exercise done
by it for sending the officers/employees on deputation. Thus, it is clear that no order dated 58(3)(5)
of Municipal Corporation Act was ever passed. Therefore, the order of transfer of Shri Munish
Sikarwar, Add. Commissioner was done in colourable exercise of power and most probably under an
impression that by issuing a transfer order, he can be posted outside his cadre in the different
department.Therefore, the transfer order of Shri Munish Sikarwar cannot be treated as an order of
deputation. Even, if it is treated as transfer on deputation, but even for that purposes, there is
nothing on record to suggest that any public interest was considered. Thus, in the light of judgment
passed by Full Bench of this Court in the case of Indore Nagar Nigam Karamchari Congress (Supra),
the deputation order is the product of colourable exercise of power. Thus, the transfer order dated
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 61
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
23-2-2024 passed in respect of Shri Munish Sikarwar is hereby Quashed. He be immediately
relieved from the post of Add. Commissioner, Gwalior and he should immediately submit his joining
in the parent department.
Shri Anil Kumar Dubey, Add. Commissioner
112. The State has not produced the record pertaining to sending Shri Anil Kumar Dubey on
deputation to Municipal Corporation, Gwalior. Therefore, what were the considerations and
deliberations behind sending Anil Kumar Dubey on deputation to the post of Add.Commissioner are
not known. It is also not known as to whether the consent of the lending department as well as
borrowing department was taken or not?
113. Shri Anil Kumar Dubey has filed his response vide document No. 4573 of 2025. It is mentioned
that he was appointed as C.M.O. and by order dated 13- 7-2023 he was transferred to the Municipal
Corporation, Gwalior on the post of Dy. Commissioner and by order dated 18-12-2024 he has been
directed to work on the post of Add. Commissioner. Even according to Shri Anil Kumar Dubey, he
was not sent on deputation but he was transferred to Municipal Corporation, Gwalior. The Counsel
for Shri Anil Kumar Dubey did not justify that how Shri Anil Kumar Dubey, can be transferred to
Municipal Corporation, Gwalior. Thus, it is clear that Shri Anil Kumar Dubey was not sent on
deputation in exercise of power under Section 58(3) or (5) of Municipal Corporation Act. Once an
officer is appointed in a particular department, then he/she should serve the said department only
and only in exceptional circumstance and that too if it is in the public interest, the employee should
be send to another department on deputation, but it appears that the State Govt. and the employees
are treating deputation as a convenient method to get the posting in another department of his/her
choice. That cannot be the very purpose of concept of deputation.
114. What were the deliberations and discussions before transferring Shri Anil Kumar Dubey to
Municipal Corporation Gwalior are not known, but one thing is clear that he was transferred under
an impression that he can be transferred to Municipal Corporation, without realizing that it is a
completely different department and cadre. Thus, it is clear that no consent must have been
obtained from the parent department of Shri Anil Kumar Dubey and similarly no consent from
borrowing department i.e., Municipal Corporation, Gwalior must have been obtained. Therefore, the
transfer order dated 31-7-2023 of Shri Anil Kumar Dubey is bad, and cannot be treated as a transfer
on deputation. Nagar Nigam further the order dated 18-12-2024 passed by the State Govt. thereby
posting Shri Anil Kumar Dubey on the post of Add. Commissioner is also bad. Accordingly, both the
orders are hereby Quashed. Shri Anil Kumar Dubey be relieved immediately and Shri Dubey should
immediately go back to his parent department by submitting his joining in his parent department.
Deputy Commissioner
115. As per the set up, 7 posts of Dy. Commissioner are sanctioned and as per Rule 2000, 50% are to
be filled up by promotion and deputation. At present only one person namely Dr. Dinesh Dixit, is
working on the post of Dy. Commissioner. Therefore, it is clear that the post in question can be filled
up State Govt. by sending atleast 3 persons on deputation.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 62
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
Dr. Dinesh Dixit, Dy. Commissioner
116. Undisputedly, Dr. Dinesh Dixit is a Veterinary Doctor. Now the only question for consideration
is that whether Dr. Dinesh Dixit is holding minimum qualifications to hold the administrative post
like Dy. Commissioner in Municipal Corporation, Gwalior or not?
117. As already pointed out, this Court had issued notices to Dr. Dinesh Dixit, and he was duly
served by Commissioner, Municipal Corporation, Gwalior, but Dr. Dinesh Dixit did not think it
proper to either engage any lawyer or to appear personally. He also did not file any response to the
Show Cause Notice issued by this Court.
118. I.A. No. 4951/2025 was filed by Petitioner for impleading the noticees as respondents but Shri
D.P. Singh, who is the Counsel for the Petitioner, did not implead Dr. Dinesh Dixit as respondent.
This was done deliberately. It is not out of place to mention here that earlier also, Dr. Dinesh Dixit
was repatriated and the order of repatriation has been challenged by Dr. Dinesh Dixit by filing W.P.
No. 7250 of 2024. It is not out of place to mention here that Shri D.P. Singh, Advocate is the Counsel
for Dr. Dinesh Dixit in W.P. No. 7250 of 2024. Although, Shri D.P. Singh had provided the copy of
fresh repatriation order dated 28-4-2025, but did not disclose to the Court, that earlier also, Dr.
Dinesh Dixit was repatriated and his writ petition i.e., W.P. No. 7250 of 2024 is pending and he
himself is the Counsel for Dr. Dinesh Dixit. Even there is nothing on record to suggest that Dr.
Dinesh Dixit has been relieved from Municipal Corporation, Gwalior in compliance of order dated
28-4-2025. Therefore, it has become necessary for this Court to consider as to whether the
deputation of Dr. Dinesh Dixit to the Municipal Corporation, Gwalior on the post of Dy.
Commissioner is in accordance with law or not?
119. Admittedly, Dr. Dinesh Dixit is a Veterinary Doctor, therefore, the State Counsel was directed to
point out that how Dr. Dinesh Dixit was eligible to be sent on deputation to the post of Dy.
Commissioner.
120. The State Govt in its return filed vide document no. 4644 of 2025 has stated that by order dated
10-8-2023, Dr. Dinesh Dixit was sent on deputation on the post of Dy. Commissioner, Municipal
Corporation, Gwalior. By order dated 18-3-2024 he was repatriated against which he filed W.P. No.
7250/2024 and by order dated 2-4-2024, interim order was passed. Various Veterinary Doctors
were working on deputation in various other departments and they have been repatriated back to
their parents departments by order dated 28-4-2025 and Dr. Dinesh Dixit has also been repatriated
by order dated 28-4-2025 and his services have also been accepted by his parent department on
28-4-2025 itself.
121. This return filed by the State Govt. is misleading and the State Govt. has suppressed material
facts. Although Dr. Dinesh Dixit was (exparte) relieved from Municipal Corporation, Gwalior but it
is not known as to whether he has submitted his joining in his parent department or not?
122. But one thing is clear that some of the Veterinary Doctors are not interested in working in their
parent department. This presumption has been drawn by this Court on account of various
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 63
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
repatriation orders of other Veterinary Doctors, which have been filed by State as Annexure R/6.
Why the State Govt. at the cost of health of Animals is interested in obliging the Veterinary Doctors
by sending them on deputation on administrative posts is not clear. It is for the State Govt. to
introspect as to whether it is really serious towards the health of the animals of State of Madhya
Pradesh or not?
123. Be that whatever it may be.
124. It is submitted by Shri S.S. Kushwaha, that the file pertaining to the repatriation of Dr. Dinesh
Dixit, Veterinary Doctor is available and accordingly, it was provided to the Court.
125. From the file, it is clear that a note sheet was written by Minister, Urban Administration and
Development that an order of posting of Dr. Dinesh Dixit on the post of Dy. Commissioner,
Municipal Corporation, Gwalior be issued. An objection was raised that the cadre of Dr. Dixit is
different and minimum qualification and duties of both the posts are different, therefore, proposal
from Commissioner, Urban Administration and Development be obtained. Thereafter, it appears
that there was no further development in this regard. Therefore, Minister for State, Udhyaniki Avam
Khadya Prasanskaran Department (independent charge) avam Narmada Valley Ghat Vikas Nigam
wrote a notesheet to issue the orders of deputation. Thereafter, Minister, Urban Administration and
Development, again wrote a note sheet to immediately place the proposal On 14-10-2022, Deputy
Secretary, G.A.D., wrote a letter to Commissioner, Urban Administration and Development to
submit his opinion for further action. On 22-2-2023, Dy. Secretary, GAD wrote a letter to Principal
Secretary, Animal Husbandry to forward the ACRs of 5 years as well as consent and details
regarding any departmental/lokayukt/enquiry etc. Thereafter on 6-2- 2023, Shri Bharat Yadav,
Commissioner, Urban Administration and Development wrote a note sheet that instructions have
been issued by Minister therefore, Dr. Dixit be sent on deputation and accordingly, his ACRs and
consent were sought for further action. Thereafter proposal from Veterinary Department was
sought. The Veterinary Department informed that the pay scale of Dr. Dixit is 56100-177500. The
Municipal Corporation, Gwalior in its NOC had mentioned that the pay scale of the post of Dy.
Commissioner is 67300- 20690/-. Further the post can be filled up by sending an officer of the rank
of Dy. Director, Finance and Accounts. Without considering the aforesaid aspects, proposal was sent
for sending Dr. Dixit on deputation and accordingly on 1-8- 2023, the order of deputation was
issued. Thereafter, the note sheet dated 27-7- 2023, written by some clerical staff mentions that a
complaint has been received from Shri Brijbhan Singh Rajput that Dr. Dixit is a Veterinary Doctor.
His deputation is only for the purposes of corruption, therefore, his deputation may be cancelled.
However, the said complaint was closed on 2-8-2023 without considering the eligibility of Dr.
Dinesh Dixit and any enquiry.
126. From the note sheet dated 4-3-2024, it is clear that Dr. Dinesh Dixit was also given the
additional charge of Gwalior Development Authority and he was negligent in discharge of his duties
and accordingly, he was also placed under suspension by order dated 12-2-2024 passed by
Commissioner, Gwalior Division, Gwalior. Since, Dr. Dinesh Dixit is negligent in discharge of his
duties, therefore, Veterinary Department was requested to take back the services of Dr. Dinesh
Dixit. Accordingly, the order of repatriation was passed on 12-3- 2024. As already pointed out that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 64
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
co-ordinate bench of this Court by order dated 2-4-2024 had stayed the operation of order dated
12-3-2024
127. Further the file of Dr. Dinesh Dixit also contains a complaint sent by one Narendra Yogi which
was addressed to the Chief Minister against the deputation of Dr. Dinesh Dixit.
128. It was submitted by Shri D.P. Singh, that the order of suspension of Dr. Dinesh Dixit was also
challenged by him by filing writ petition and the order of suspension was quashed on the ground of
competency of Commissioner, Gwalior Division Gwalior.
129. Be that whatever it may be.
130. The State Govt. has deliberately suppressed all the above mentioned facts in its return filed vide
document number 4644/2025.
131. From the file of Dr. Dinesh Dixit, it is clear that he was in the pay scale of 56100-177500
whereas he was sent on deputation to the post of Dy. Commissioner whose pay scale is
67300-20690/-. This fact was in the notice of the State Govt. therefore, in the deputation order, it
was mentioned that Dr. Dinesh Dixit would be entitled for the pay scale which he was getting in the
parent department.
132. The Counsel for the State could not point out as to how, Dr. Dinesh Dixit was eligible to be send
on deputation to the post of Dy. Commissioner which is a higher post. Further more, it appears that
apart from the post of Dy. Commissioner, Dr. Dinesh Dixit was also given the charge of some post in
Gwalior Development Authority.
133. Thus, it is clear that Dr Dinesh Dixit was send on deputation on account of recommendations
made by Minister of General Administration and Development and Minister for State Udhyaniki
Avam Khadya Prasanskaran Department (independent charge) avam Narmada Valley Ghat Vikas
Nigam. This is a glaring example of colourable exercise of power. Neither Dr. Dinesh Dixit was
having minimum qualification to hold the post of Dy. Commissioner, Municipal Corporation, nor he
was holding any post which can be said to be equivalent to the post of Dy. Commissioner.
134. Now, the question for consideration is that in view of stay order dated 2- 4-2024 passed by
co-ordinate bench of this Court in W.P. No. 7250/2024, whether this Court can consider the
question of deputation of Dr. Dixit or not?
135. In writ petition no. 7250/2024, the question is with regard to repatriation of Dr. Dinesh Dixit,
but in the present case, the very correctness of his order of deputation is in question. If order of
deputation is quashed, W.P. No. 7250 of 2024 would become infructuous but if W.P. No. 7250 of
2024 is allowed, then only the order of repatriation would be quashed, but the validity of the order
of deputation cannot be decided in W.P. No. 7250 of 2024. Therefore, it is held that pendency of W.
P. no. 7250 of 2024 and interim order dated 2-4-2024 will not come in the way of this Court to
consider the validity of the order of deputation of Dr. Dinesh Dixit.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 65
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
136. As already pointed out, neither Dr. Dinesh Dixit was holding minimum qualification nor any
equivalent post to the post of Dy. Commissioner. In fact Dr. Dinesh Dixit was working on a lower
post in comparison to the post of Dy. Commissioner, Municipal Corporation. No public interest was
considered. Why Dr. Dinesh Dixit should be send on deputation was also not considered, but from
the file it is clear that since, two Ministers were pressurizing the officers, therefore, Dr. Dinesh Dixit
was sent on deputation. The helplessness of the officers because of instructions of the higher
authorities was also expressed by Shri Vivek Khedkar, Additional Advocate General on 16-4-2025,
which is duly mentioned in the order dated 16-4-2025 also.
137. Thus, the order of deputation of Dr. Dinesh Dixit is a product of colourable exercise of power,
therefore, the same is hereby Quashed. Although it appears that Shri Dinesh Dixit was relieved
exparte on 28-4-2025, but it is not known as to whether Shri Dinesh Dixit has actually joined in his
parent department or still has managed to work in Municipal Corporation Gwalior.
Therefore, it is directed that if Dr. Dinesh Dixit has not joined in his parent department, then he
shall immediately do so, and it is also directed that in future also, by keeping the welfare of animals
of State of Madhya Pradesh, in mind Dr. Dinesh Dixit shall not be sent on deputation to any other
department and if he is still working in Municipal Corporation, Gwalior, then he shall stop working
with immediate effect.
Asstt. Commissioners
138. On this post, two officers namely Shri Sunil Kumar Chauhan and Shri Amar Satya Gupta are
working on deputation. As per Rules, 2000, no post of Asstt. Commissioner can be filled up by
deputation. Therefore, it is clear that deputation of both the persons is bad in the light of Rules
2000. Shri Sunil Kumar Chauhan, Asstt. Commissioner
139. By order dated 10-10-2019, Shri Sunil Kumar Chauhan was sent on deputation to the post of
Asstt. Commissioner, Municipal Corporation, Gwalior. The file of Shri Sunil Kumar Chauhan was
made available by the State Govt. He was sent on deputation on the recommendation of Minister,
Urban Administration and Development only and no public interest was considered. Thus, it is clear
that Shri Sunil Kumar Chauhan was accommodated merely on the recommendation of the Minister.
Thus, in the light of judgment passed by Full Bench of this Court in the case of Indore Nagar Nigam
Karamchari Congress (Supra), the deputation order of Shri Sunil Kumar Chauhan is the product of
colourable exercise of power. Accordingly, the deputation of Shri Sunil Kumar Chauhan is hereby
Quashed. Shri Sunil Kumar Chauhan shall stop working as Asstt. Commissioner with immediate
effect and he shall submit his joining in his parent department.
Shri Amar Satya Gupta, Asstt. Commissioner
140. The file of Shri Amar Satya Gupta, Asstt. Commissioner, has not been provided. By order dated
2-9-2021, Shri Amar Satya Gupta, Asstt. Commissioner was transferred to Municipal Corporation,
Gwalior, whereas his parent department is Urban Administration and Development. He could not
have been sent to Municipal Corporation, Gwalior, merely by issuing transfer order. The transfer
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/22280548/ 66
Dr. (Mrs) Anuradha Gupta vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 May, 2025
order of Shri Amar Satya Gupta, Asstt. Commissioner, has been filed by the State in its return vide
document no. 4644/2025. Thus, the transfer order of Shri Amar Satya Gupta is bad on two grounds
i.e., he has been sent on deputation to a post which cannot be filled up by deputation as per Rules,
2000 and secondly, no deputation order was passed and he was merely transferred. In absence of
any foundation, even his transfer order cannot be treated as a transfer on deputation. Furthermore
the order of transfer is also not in conformity with the law laid down by Full Bench of this Court in
the case of Indore Nagar Nigam Karamchari Congress (Supra). Accordingly, the transfer order of
Shri Amar Satya Gupta, is hereby Quashed and it is directed that he shall stop functioning as Asstt.
Commissioner, with immediate effect and he shall submit his joining in his parent department.
Accountant
141. As per Rules, 2000, the post of Accountant, cannot be filled up by deputation.
Shri Santosh Sharma, Accountant
142. The file of Shri Santosh Sharma has been provided according to which he was sent on
deputation on the recommendation of the then Chief Minister. The file doesnot disclose that the law
laid down by Full Bench in the case of Indore Nagar Nigam Karamchari Congress (Supra), was ever
taken note of. No public interest has been considered. Shri Sharma has been sent on deputation on
the recommendation of the then Chief Minister only. Further by order dated 5- 9-2023, he was
posted in Municipal Corporation, Gwalior on the post of Accountant. It is not mentioned in the
