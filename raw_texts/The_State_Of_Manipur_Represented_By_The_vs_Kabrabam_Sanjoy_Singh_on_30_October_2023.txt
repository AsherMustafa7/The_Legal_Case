... RESPONDENTS
BEFORE
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE M.V. MURALIDARAN
For the Applicants :: Mr. S. Nepolean, GA
For the Respondents :: Mr. S. Rupachandra, Sr. Adv.
.
Date of Hearing and reserving Judgment & Order :: 13.10.2023 Date of Judgment & Order ::
30.10.2023 JUDGMENT AND ORDER (CAV) Heard Mr. S. Nepolean, learned Government
Advocate for the applicants and Mr. S. Rupachandra, the learned senior counsel for the
respondents.
2. This miscellaneous case has been filed by the applicants under Section 5 of the Limitation Act
read with Rule 4 of Chapter IX of the High Court of Manipur Rules, 2019 to condone the delay of
425 days in filing the review application. MC(Review Pet.) No. 6 of 2023 (Ref:- Review Pet. No. 7 of
2023) Page |3
3. Mr. S. Nepolean, the learned Government Advocate for the applicants submitted that soon after
the receipt of the copy of the order dated 8.12.2021 passed in the writ petition, the Administrative
Department processed the same for consideration for appointment of the writ petitioners under the
die-in-harness scheme. In the process, the related file was referred to the Department of Personnel
for its views. By the note dated 14.12.2022, the Department of Personnel returned the file by
referring to the Office Memorandum dated 6.6.2007 and also requested the Administrative
Department to take necessary action for reviewing the order dated 8.12.2021. Thereafter, the file
was processed for filing a review application against the order dated 8.12.2021 and while processing
the file, a delay of 463 days occurred. After deducting the statutory period and the period taken for
obtaining the certified copy, there is a delay of 425 days in filing the review application.
4. The learned Government Advocate would submit that the said delay is neither wilful nor wanton
nor deliberate. If the said delay is not condoned, the applicants would put to irreparable loss and
damage. Since the State is the applicants, the Court should take a lenient view as the State
represents collective cause of the community. Further, the applicants have a chance to MC(Review
Pet.) No. 6 of 2023 (Ref:- Review Pet. No. 7 of 2023) Page |4 succeed in the review application.

The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Kabrabam Sanjoy Singh on 30 October, 2023
Thus, a prayer is made to condone the delay of 425 days in filing the review application.
5. Refuting the submissions of the learned Government Advocate, Mr. S. Rupachandra, the learned
senior counsel for the respondents submitted that the Department of Personnel took more than nine
months without whispering anything for reviewing the order stating that the related Office
Memorandum was published on 9.7.2007. In fact, there is no mention in the miscellaneous case
when the alleged publication was discovered. The Department of Personnel is not a party to the writ
and they have never spelt out anything about it. The publication of Office Memorandum stated by
the applicants is not applicable to the case of the respondents to the extent that the dates of
applications submitted which are to be treated invalid was mentioned as applications submitted in
between 15.6.2006 and 31.12.2006, whereas the respondents have submitted their applications on
7.11.2002 and 26.2.2008 respectively. No sufficient cause is shown for condoning the delay. On
merits also, the applicants have no case for seeking review of the order dated 8.12.2021. Thus, a
prayer has been made to dismiss the miscellaneous case. MC(Review Pet.) No. 6 of 2023 (Ref:-
Review Pet. No. 7 of 2023) Page |5
6. This Court considered the rival submissions and also perused the materials available on record.
7. The applicants have filed the present miscellaneous case seeking to condone the delay of 425 days
in filing the review application against the order dated 8.12.2021 passed in W.P.(C) No.1145 of 2018
on the ground that during the process of the file, the delay occurred. According to the applicants, the
Administrative Department processed the order dated 8.12.2021 for appointment of the
respondents under die-in-harness scheme. In the said process, the file was referred to the
Department of Personnel and the Department of Personnel after examining the file retuned the
same stating that the finding of the High Court was mainly on the ground that the Office
Memorandum dated 6.6.2007 was not notified for the knowledge of the general public. The
Department of Personnel further stated that the Office Memorandum was published on 9.6.2007 in
the local dailies and, as such, the Administrative Department may take necessary action for filing
review application. Accordingly, the Administrative Department decided to file the review
application against the order dated 8.12.2021.
MC(Review Pet.) No. 6 of 2023 (Ref:- Review Pet. No. 7 of 2023) Page |6
8. On the other hand, the respondents contended that the Department of Personnel took nearly nine
months' time to return the file. Moreover, the Department of Personnel is not a party to the writ
petition and any opinion/view to be obtained from the Department of Personnel by the
Administrative Department is an internal correspondence and the delay caused during the internal
correspondence cannot be the sufficient cause for condoning the delay.
9. The applicants have explained the reasons for the delay in the present miscellaneous case as
under:
8.12.2021 Judgment and order under review passed by this Court.

The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Kabrabam Sanjoy Singh on 30 October, 2023
10. The learned counsel for the respondents submitted that the State has not shown any acceptable
explanation for the delay and the State ought to have acted with reasonable diligence in prosecuting
the review application.
11. Application under Section 5 of the Limitation Act is to be construed liberally so as to do
substantial justice to the parties. In the present miscellaneous case, the applicants have stated the
cause for the delay, which is the sufficient cause.
12. The question as to what would be held to be "sufficient cause" while considering the application
for condonation of delay came up for consideration in the case Esha Bhattacharjee v. Managing
Committee of Raghunathpur Nafar MC(Review Pet.) No. 6 of 2023 (Ref:- Review Pet. No. 7 of 2023)
Page |9 Academy and others, (2013) 12 SCC 649, wherein upon considering the obligation of the
Court while dealing with an application for condonation of delay and the approach to be adopted
while considering the grounds for condonation, the principles to be applied were summarized by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court as under:
"21. From the aforesaid authorities the principles that can broadly be culled out are:
21.1. (i) There should be a liberal, pragmatic, justice-oriented, non-
pedantic approach while dealing with an application for condonation of delay, for the courts are not
supposed to legalise injustice but are obliged to remove injustice.
21.2. (ii) The terms "sufficient cause"
should be understood in their proper spirit, philosophy and purpose regard being had
to the fact that these terms are basically elastic and are to be applied in proper
perspective to the obtaining fact-situation. 21.3. (iii) Substantial justice being
paramount and pivotal the technical considerations should not be given undue and
uncalled for emphasis. 21.4. (iv) No presumption can be attached to deliberate
causation of delay but, gross negligence on the part of the counsel or litigant is to be
taken note of.
21.5. (v) Lack of bona fides imputable to a party seeking condonation of delay is a
significant and relevant fact. 21.6. (vi) It is to be kept in mind that adherence to strict
proof should not MC(Review Pet.) No. 6 of 2023 (Ref:- Review Pet. No. 7 of 2023) P a
g e | 10 affect public justice and cause public mischief because the courts are required
to be vigilant so that in the ultimate eventuate there is no real failure of justice.
21.7. (vii) The concept of liberal approach has to encapsulate the conception of
reasonableness and it cannot be allowed a totally unfettered free play.
21.8. (viii) There is a distinction between inordinate delay and a delay of short
duration or few days, for to the former doctrine of prejudice is attracted whereas to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/191927384/ 5
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Kabrabam Sanjoy Singh on 30 October, 2023
the latter it may not be attracted. That apart, the first one warrants strict approach
whereas the second calls for a liberal delineation. 21.9. (ix) The conduct, behaviour
and attitude of a party relating to its inaction or negligence are relevant factors to be
taken into consideration. It is so as the fundamental principle is that the courts are
required to weigh the scale of balance of justice in respect of both parties and the said
principle cannot be given a total go by in the name of liberal approach.
21.10. (x) If the explanation offered is concocted or the grounds urged in the
application are fanciful, the courts should be vigilant not to expose the other side
unnecessarily to face such a litigation.
21.11. (xi) It is to be borne in mind that no one gets away with fraud,
misrepresentation or interpolation by taking recourse to the technicalities of law of
limitation.
21.12. (xii) The entire gamut of facts are to be carefully scrutinised and the approach
should be based on the paradigm of judicial discretion which is MC(Review Pet.) No.
6 of 2023 (Ref:- Review Pet. No. 7 of 2023) P a g e | 11 founded on objective
reasoning and not on individual perception. 21.13. (xiii) The State or a public body or
an entity representing a collective cause should be given some acceptable latitude.
13. In Collector, Land Acquisition, Anantnag and another v. Katiji and others, (1987)
2 CC 107, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held:
"3. The legislature has conferred the power to condone delay by enacting Section 5 [
Any appeal or any application, other than an application under any of the provisions
of Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, may be admitted after the
prescribed period if the appellant or the applicant satisfies the court that he had
sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal or making the application within such
period.] of the Indian Limitation Act of 1963 in order to enable the courts to do
substantial justice to parties by disposing of matters on "merits". The expression
"sufficient cause" employed by the legislature is adequately elastic to enable the
courts to apply the law in a meaningful manner which subserves the ends of justice --
that being the life- purpose for the existence of the institution of courts. It is common
knowledge that this Court has been making a justifiably liberal approach in matters
instituted in this Court. But the message does not appear to have percolated down to
all the other courts in the hierarchy. And such a liberal MC(Review Pet.) No. 6 of
2023 (Ref:- Review Pet. No. 7 of 2023) P a g e | 12 approach is adopted on principle
as it is realized that:
"1. Ordinarily a litigant does not stand to benefit by lodging an appeal late.
2. Refusing to condone delay can result in a meritorious matter being thrown out at
the very threshold and cause of justice being defeated. As against this when delay is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/191927384/ 6
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Kabrabam Sanjoy Singh on 30 October, 2023
condoned the highest that can happen is that a cause would be decided on merits
after hearing the parties.
3. "Every day's delay must be explained" does not mean that a pedantic approach
should be made. Why not every hour's delay, every second's delay? The doctrine must
be applied in a rational common sense pragmatic manner.
4. When substantial justice and technical considerations are pitted against each
other, cause of substantial justice deserves to be preferred for the other side cannot
claim to have vested right in injustice being done because of a non-deliberate delay.
5. There is no presumption that delay is occasioned deliberately, or on account of
culpable negligence, or on account of mala fides. A litigant does not stand to benefit
by resorting to delay. In fact he runs a serious risk.
6. It must be grasped that judiciary is respected not on account of its power to legalize
injustice on technical grounds but because it is capable of removing injustice and is
expected to do so.
MC(Review Pet.) No. 6 of 2023 (Ref:- Review Pet. No. 7 of 2023) P a g e | 13 Making
a justice-oriented approach from this perspective, there was sufficient cause for
condoning the delay in the institution of the appeal. The fact that it was the "State"
which was seeking condonation and not a private party was altogether irrelevant. The
doctrine of equality before law demands that all litigants, including the State as a
litigant, are accorded the same treatment and the law is administered in an even-
handed manner. There is no warrant for according a step-motherly treatment when
the "State" is the applicant praying for condonation of delay. In fact experience shows
that on account of an impersonal machinery (no one in charge of the matter is
directly hit or hurt by the judgment sought to be subjected to appeal) and the
inherited bureaucratic methodology imbued with the note- making, file-pushing and
passing-on- the-buck ethos, delay on its part is less difficult to understand though
more difficult to approve. In any event, the State which represents the collective
cause of the community, does not deserve a litigant-non-grata status. The courts
therefore have to be informed with the spirit and philosophy of the provision in the
course of the interpretation of the expression "sufficient cause". So also the same
approach has to be evidenced in its application to matters at hand with the end in
view to do even-handed justice on merits in preference to the approach which
scuttles a decision on merits. Turning to the facts of the matter giving rise to the
present appeal, we are satisfied that sufficient cause exists for the delay. The order of
the High Court dismissing the appeal before it as time- barred, is therefore, set aside.
Delay is MC(Review Pet.) No. 6 of 2023 (Ref:- Review Pet. No. 7 of 2023) P a g e | 14
condoned. And the matter is remitted to the High Court. The High Court will now
dispose of the appeal on merits after affording reasonable opportunity of hearing to
both the sides."

The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Kabrabam Sanjoy Singh on 30 October, 2023
(emphasis supplied)
14. In State of Nagaland v. Lipok AO and others, (2005) 3 SCC 752, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held
thus:
"15. It is axiomatic that decisions are taken by officers/agencies proverbially at a slow pace and
encumbered process of pushing the files from table to table and keeping it on the table for
considerable time causing delay -- intentional or otherwise -- is a routine. Considerable delay of
procedural red tape in the process of their making decision is a common feature. Therefore, certain
amount of latitude is not impermissible. If the appeals brought by the State are lost for such default
no person is individually affected but what in the ultimate analysis suffers, is public interest. The
expression "sufficient cause" should, therefore, be considered with pragmatism in a justice-oriented
approach rather than the technical detection of sufficient cause for explaining every day's delay. The
factors which are peculiar to and characteristic of the functioning of the governmental MC(Review
Pet.) No. 6 of 2023 (Ref:- Review Pet. No. 7 of 2023) P a g e | 15 conditions would be cognizant to
and requires adoption of pragmatic approach in justice-oriented process. The court should decide
the matters on merits unless the case is hopelessly without merit. No separate standards to
determine the cause laid by the State vis-à-vis private litigant could be laid to prove strict standards
of sufficient cause. The Government at appropriate level should constitute legal cells to examine the
cases whether any legal principles are involved for decision by the courts or whether cases require
adjustment and should authorise the officers to take a decision or give appropriate permission for
settlement. In the event of decision to file appeal, needed prompt action should be pursued by the
officer responsible to file the appeal and he should be made personally responsible for lapses, if any.
Equally, the State cannot be put on the same footing as an individual. The individual would always
be quick in taking the decision whether he would pursue the remedy by way of an appeal or
application since he is a person legally injured while the State is an impersonal machinery working
through its officers or servants."
MC(Review Pet.) No. 6 of 2023 (Ref:- Review Pet. No. 7 of 2023) P a g e | 16
15. Refusal to condone the delay would result in denying the State in preferring the review
application against the order dated 8.12.2021. There is no presumption that delay in approaching
the Court is always deliberate. As held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, the word "sufficient cause"
under Section 5 of the Limitation Act should receive liberal construction so as to advance substantial
justice.
16. The applicants are not to gain by delay. The reasons are spelt out in the present miscellaneous
case. It is trite that if the technical considerations and cause for substantial justice are pitted against
each other, the cause for substantial justice has to be sub-served.
17. Applying the aforesaid principles to the case on hand, it would be seen that the present
miscellaneous case seeking condonation of delay spelt out the reasons for the delay in filing the
review application and the reasons specified in that regard could not be held to be insufficient and
no want of bona fides could have been imputed to the State. In the given facts and circumstances of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/191927384/ 8
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Kabrabam Sanjoy Singh on 30 October, 2023
the case, this Court is of the view that liberal approach has to be adopted in the present case and the
delay has been sufficiently explained by the applicants by giving adequate MC(Review Pet.) No. 6 of
2023 (Ref:- Review Pet. No. 7 of 2023) P a g e | 17 reasons. The present miscellaneous case ought
not to be rejected on some hyper technical reasoning, as contended by the respondents. That apart,
the applicants have shown sufficient cause for the delay.
18. For all the reasons stated above and having satisfied with the explanation for the delay, this
Court is inclined to condone the delay of 425 days in filing the review application.
19. In the result, MC (Rev. Pet.) No.6 of 2023 in Review Petition No.7 of 2023 is allowed.
