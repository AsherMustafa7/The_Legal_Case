The tickling tone for this judgment can be set by what Lord Denning had humoured in TOTE

horse-race. Today she has been taking part in another game of chance or skill - the game of
litigation..."
All these petitions by the companies & individuals involving substantially similar questions of law &
facts seek to lay a challenge to the validity of the Karnataka Act No.28 of 2021 (hereafter
'Amendment Act') whereby the Karnataka Police Act, 1963 (hereafter 'Principal Act') has been
amended; the cumulative effect of these amendments, according to them, is the criminalization of

appearance through the learned Advocate General have filed their common Statement of Objections
and Addl. Statement of Objections resisting the challenge. II. A BRIEF DESCRIPTION AS TO WHO
THE PETITIONERS ARE:
Petitioners in W.P.No.18703/2021 and W.P.No.19322/2021 are the societies
registered under the Societies Registration Act. Petitioners in W.P.No.18729/2021,
W.P.No.18732/2021, W.P.No.18733/2021, W.P.No.18738/2021,
W.P.No.18803/2021, W.P.No.18942/2021, W.P.No.19241/2021 and

- 18 -
cross-word, scrabble and fantasy sports such as cricket, etc. III. GROUNDS OF
CHALLENGE BRIEFLY STATED:
The challenge to the Amendment Act is structured inter alia on the following
grounds:
(i) Lack of legislative competence since the Amendment Act does not fit into Entry
34, List II, Schedule VII of the Constitution of India vide CHAMARBAUGWALA-I2,
CHAMARBAUGWALA-II3, K.SATYANARAYANA vs. STATE OF ANDRHA
PRADESH4 & K.R.LAKSHMANAN vs. STATE OF TAMIL NADU5.
(ii) Violation of Article 21 since playing games & sports falls within the umbrella of
'right to life & liberty' that has been stretching precedent by precedent and AIR 1957
SC 628 AIR 1957 SC 874 AIR 1968 SC 825 (1996) 2 SCC 226
- 19 -
violation of doctrine of privacy vide K.S.PUTTASWAMY vs. UNION OF INIDA6.
(iii) Violation of fundamental right to freedom of speech & expression guaranteed under Article
19(1)(a) since playing games & sports of skill is a facet of speech & expression and that criminalizing
apart from amounting to unreasonable restriction, is incompetent under Article 19(2).
(iv) Violation of fundamental right to profession/business guaranteed under Article 19(1)(g) read
with Article 301 i.e., incompetent & unreasonable restriction vide CHINTAMAN RAO vs. STATE OF

(v) Manifest arbitrariness SHAYARA BANO vs. UNION OF INDIA9 since the Amendment Act fails
to (2019) 1 SCC 1 (1950) SCR 759 (1969) 1 SCC 853 (2017) 9 SCC 1
- 20 -
recognize the blatant normative difference between a 'game of skill' and a 'game of chance', in gross
derogation of Chamarbaugwala Jurisprudence of more than six decades.
(vi) The impugned legislative measure is a result of excessive paternalism & populism. The State is
imposing its own notion of morality on the free & rational citizens by clamping a blanket ban on
online games of skill. This is constitutionally unsustainable.
Petitioners in support of their case also press into service several other decisions of the Apex Court
and of some High Courts which will be discussed in due course.
IV. RESPONDENTS' OBJECTIONS TO THE
PETITIONS:
The respondents oppose the petitions on the grounds as summarized below:
(i) There was a Public Interest Litigation in W.P.No.13714/2020 seeking a direction
for legislatively banning all forms of online gambling & online betting; a
- 21 -
Division Bench of this Court vide order dated 31.3.2021 directed the respondent-State to take a
stand on the matter and accordingly, the Chief Secretary, Govt. of Karnataka had filed an affidavit to
the effect that the State would come out with a legislation. The impugned Amendment Act has come
on the Statute book pursuant to the assurance given to the Court.
(ii) In the preceding two decades or so, because of digital revolution, there has been a proliferation
of online gaming platforms which engage in 'betting & wagering' unbound by time & place unlike
traditional betting, and this has proved disastrous to the public interest in general and public order
& public health in particular. The menace of cyber games having reached epic proportions, the
police in the past three years or so, have registered about 28,000 cases, all over the State. Several
persons have committed suicide and millions of families have been ruined. Therefore, the
Amendment Act is made criminalizing wagering, betting or risking money on the unknown result of
an event, be it a game
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35272859/ 17
Galactus Funware Technology Private ... vs State Of Karnatka on 14 February, 2022
- 22 -
of chance or a game of skill. The persons owning these premises or online platforms wherein such
games are played are also liable to be punished. The State derives legislative power under Article
246 read with Entries 1, 2, 6 & 34 of State List as widely interpreted by the Apex Court.
(iii) Amendment Act introduces clarificatory provisions to the effect that the provisions relating to
gaming apply to online gaming & platforms, as well. Apart from making the offences cognizable &
non- bailable, it makes the punishment more stringent commensurating with the gravity of the
offence. However, if persons merely play a game of chance or a game of skill without risking cash or
kind, they do not fall in the net of penal provisions.
(iv) The petitioners lack both the locus standi and the cause of action, there being no coercive action
initiated against anyone of them or against anyone who made use of their online gaming platforms.
Ordinarily,
- 23 -
anticipatory relief of the kind cannot be granted by a constitutional Court.
(v) Those of the petitioners who happen to be the companies incorporated under the erstwhile
Companies Act, 1956 or the present Companies Act, 2013, being juristic persons cannot avail the
fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 19(1) of the Constitution.
(vi) In support of their submission, the respondents inter alia bank upon the decisions of Apex Court
in JILUBHAI NANBHA KACHAR vs. STATE OF GUJARAT10, GODFREY PHILLIPS INDIA LTD.
vs. STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH11, M.J SIVANI vs. STATE OF KARNATAKA12, HIGH COURT OF

2. AS TO WHAT IMPACT THE AMENDMENT HAS ON THE RIGHTS & LIBERTIES OF
INDIVIDUALS:
(a) The Karnataka Police Act, 1963 was enacted by the State Legislature for the
regulation of police force, the maintenance of public order and for the prevention of
gambling. It received the assent of the President of India on 18.01.1964 and came to
be gazetted on 13.02.1964.
This Act came into force with effect from 02.04.1965 as notified. The Act has been amended as many
as a dozen times between 1965 and 2021. Except the 2021 amendment, the rest are not put in
challenge. The Amendment Act i.e., the Karnataka Act No.28 of 2021 which has brought about a
substantial & sweeping change to the Principal Act, received the assent of the Governor of Karnataka
on 4.10.2021. It came into force on being published in the official gazette on 5.10.2021. The
Amendment Act introduces an expansive definition of 'gaming' under Section 2(7) by including all
online games which involve all forms of wagering or betting. The
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35272859/ 24
Galactus Funware Technology Private ... vs State Of Karnatka on 14 February, 2022
- 34 -
definition of the term 'wagering or betting' itself is widened to engulf even a game of skill involving
money or otherwise, however, excluding horse racing subject to certain conditions. Similarly, it
expansively alters the definitions of 'common gaming house' under Section 2(3), 'wagering or
betting' in Explanation (i) to Section 2(7), 'instruments of gaming' under Section 2(11), 'online
gaming' under Section 2(12A), 'place' under Section 2(13). Thus, the amendment encompasses in its
fold games of skill too, offered to users through the online platforms/portals/applications played
with monetary stakes or not.
(b) Section 78(1)(vi) & (vii) post amendment proscribe the act of running online gaming platforms
offering games of skill to its users. These expanded definitions are the building blocks of penal
provisions such as Sections 78, 79, 80, 87, 114 & 128A. The net effect of Amendment Act is: owners
of online gaming houses, providers of online gaming facilities and players of online games, all
become offenders liable to be jailed &
- 35 -
fined in terms of penal provisions. Added, amended Section 128A makes these offences both
cognizable & non-bailable. As mentioned in the Comparative Tables above, the definition of 'pure
game of skill' under the Principal Act has undergone a substantial change by virtue of amendment.
The amended section retains an exclusion for 'pure games of skill' while omitting the exclusion that
benefited the players of games of skill with financial stakes, in the pre-amendment regime. The
amended definition of 'gaming' prohibits online games of skill when played with monetary stakes, is
not disputed by the respondents.
VI. A BRIEF HISTORY OF BETTING AND
GAMBLING:
(a) Acclaimed jurist of yester decades late
H.M.Seervai in his magnum opus 'Constitutional Law of India' Volume III, Fourth Edition, Tripathi,
at paragraph 22.262 writes: 'If the decisions of the US Supreme Court, Supreme Court of Australia
or Canada, or the decision of the Privy Council can be referred to for showing the evils
- 36 -
of gambling, there is no reason why references should not be made to Hindu Law and to Hindu
religious books, or to Mohammadan Law, to show that gambling had been condemned in India from
ancient times'.
(b) Gambling is perhaps as old as mankind. Betting & gambling have always been a part of several
civilizations. The Greeks and Romans were among the first to practise gambling. Most of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35272859/ 25
Galactus Funware Technology Private ... vs State Of Karnatka on 14 February, 2022
scriptures, native & foreign shun them. In India from time immemorial, sages had proscribed
gambling as a sinful and pernicious vice. Sage Kanvasha Ailusha (Aksha Maujavant) had composed
a cautionary poem/hymn in Rig Veda (10.34) which is titled "The Gambler's Lament". It comprises
monologue of a repentant gambler who grieves the ruin brought on him because of addiction to the
game of dice; this Veda (10.34) has a hymn which nearly translates to: a gambler's wife is left forlorn
and wretched; the mother mourns the son who wanders homeless, in constant fear, in debt and
seeking money by theft in the dark of night. In raajsooya yaag, of middle Vedic period, a ritual game
of dice used to be played in
- 37 -
which the game was rigged so that the king-to-be, would win.
(c) In Indian epic 'Mahaabhaarat', King Yudhistira the eldest brother of Paandavaas gambles away
his kingdom, brothers, wife Draupadi and lastly himself to his cousins i.e., Kauravaas and all they as
stipulated go to woods. Yaajnavalkya Smriti has a verse which states that son should not pay the
paternal debt that was contracted for the purpose of liquor, lust or gambling. Kaatyaayana Smriti
states that gambling, if cannot be stopped in the kingdom, should be discouraged by imposing tax.
Manusmriti injuncts that gambling & betting, the king shall exclude from his realm since those two
vices may cause the destruction of kingdom; a wise man should not practise them even for
amusement. Kautilya of arthashaastr fame treats all gamblers as cheats and therefore suggests
severe punishment. A great Tamil book by Thiruvalluvar 'Tirukkural' fumes against gambling.
- 38 -
(d) John Dunkley's 'Gambling: A social & moral problems in France', 1958 Edn. discusses about the
historicity of gambling in France. In 17th -18th centuries, French cities were attracting gamblers
from all over Europe and the Resolution on Hazardous Games was passed way back in the year 1697
providing general guidelines on how to gamble and for easing the problems associated with
gambling; however, French moralists were opposing the same contending: "Gambling spoils an
individual's ability to reason; gambling poisons gamblers' relations with others; gambling makes a
gambler neglect his religious and social duties". It is not impertinent to quote a stanza from
Shakespeare's 'Merchant of Venice':
"If Hercules and Lychas play at dice Which is the better man, the greater throw May
turn by fortune from the weaker hand; So is Alcides beaten by his page, And so may I,
blind Fortune leading me, Miss that which one unworthier may attain, And die with

VII. CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY DEBATES ON 'Betting & gambling':
(a) There was a considerable discussion in the Constituent Assembly on the
introduction of Entry 34 in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35272859/ 26
Galactus Funware Technology Private ... vs State Of Karnatka on 14 February, 2022
- 39 -
the State List which was Entry 45 in the Draft Constitution. Two prominent members of the
Assembly, namely, Mr. Shibban Lal Saksena & Mr. Lakshminarayan Sahu had suggested for the
omission of this Entry from the constitutional document, under a wrong impression that if omitted,
there would no longer be betting or gambling in the country. Dr. Ambedkar erased their impression
by the following reply:
"I should like to submit to them that if this entry was omitted, there would be
absolutely no control of betting and gambling at all, because if Entry 45 was there it
may either be used for the purpose of permitting betting and gambling or it may be
used for the purposes of prohibiting them. If this entry is not there, the provincial
governments would be absolutely helpless in the matter... If this Entry was omitted,
the other consequence would be that this subject will be automatically transferred to
List I under Entry
91.... If my friends are keen that there should be no betting and gambling, then
proper thing would be to introduce an article in the Constitution itself making betting
and gambling a crime, not to be tolerated by the State. As it is, it is a preventive thing
and the State will have full power to prohibit gambling". CAD of 02.09.1949, Volume
IX.
(b) It is relevant to note that Part III of our Constitution outlaws untouchability
(Article 17), human
- 40 -
trafficking and begar (Article 23), child employment (Article 24). Part IV enacts Directive Principles
of State Policy which Dr.Ambedkar called as the 'instrument of instructions'. It specifies a list of do's
& don'ts that address the making of government policies. Article 47 directs prohibition of liquors &
injurious drugs. It is relevant to mention that the Apex Court in KHODAY DISTILLERIES vs.
STATE OF KARNATAKA18,observed that the trade or business in liquor is a res extra commerciam
since the said commodity is inherently harmful and that law can completely ban its trade. Article 48
inter alia directs proscription of cow slaughter. However, there is no such prohibition expressly or
impliedly suggested in respect of gambling although power to legislate concerning the same avails to
the State vide Entry 34, List II, Schedule VII of the Constitution, as would be discussed infra.
VIII. AS TO LEGISLATIVE COMPETENCE & WIDER INTERPREATION OF LEGISLATIVE
ENTRIES:
(1995) 1 SCC 574
- 41 -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35272859/ 27
Galactus Funware Technology Private ... vs State Of Karnatka on 14 February, 2022
(a) The most important feature of Federal Constitutions like ours is the distribution &
sharing of legislative power between the Centre and the States. Our Constitution has
bodily adopted this scheme of Government of India Act, 1935 with small verbal
changes, and with substantially enlarged legislative Lists enacted in Schedule VII;
"Betting and gambling" was the term employed in Entry 36, List II in Schedule VII to
the said Act too; the same is replicated in Entry 34 of the State List in the
Constitution. This term is not defined in our Constitution nor was it defined in the
Government of India Act. It does not find a place even in popular law lexicons, nor in
the contemporary English dictionaries, either. However, the constituent words of the
term, namely 'betting' and 'gambling' are individually and sometimes correlatively
defined. Much assistance cannot be derived by turning to the dictionaries, as it is
often said 'law is not the slave of dictionaries'. "But I am not inclined to play a
grammarian's role" said Justice Hidayatullah in SAJJAN SINGH vs. STATE OF
- 42 -
RAJASTHAN19. No law sings its intent to the subjects. One of the characteristics of enacted law
(constitutional law included) is its embodiment in authoritative linguistic formulae. The very words
in which it is expressed i.e., litera scripta constitute a part of the law itself. Legal authority is
possessed by the letter of an enactment no less than by its spirit. Therefore in the case of enacted
law, a process of judicial interpretation becomes necessary for ascertaining its meaning &
application.
(b) The first ground vehemently canvassed by petitioners is that the subject amendment could not
have been enacted for want of legislative power. Drawing the attention of Court to Entry 34 of State
List which employs the term 'Betting and gambling' they contended that this term has acquired a
constitutional significance having been so treated by the Apex Court in two CHAMARBAUGWALLA
cases, K.SATYANARAYANA and K.R.LAKSHMANAN, supra. Learned Advocate General appearing
for the respondents per contra contended that the legislative competence of the State extends to and
AIR 1965 SC 845
- 43 -
beyond Entry 34. He points out Entry 1 (Public order), Entry 2 (Police), Entry 6 (Public health and
sanitation) and Entry 26 (Trade and commerce) in the same List. According to respondents, the
Amendment Act is a piece of 'ragbag legislation', to borrow the words of Hon'ble
M.N.Venkatachalaiah,J. in UJAGAR PRINTS vs. UNION OF INDIA20.
(c) It has long been settled that the legislative power emanates inter alia from Articles 245 & 246
(now additionally Article 246A) of the Constitution and that the Legislative Entries are only the
fields of law making. These Entries are mere legislative heads of enabling character designed to
define and delimit the respective areas of legislative competence of the Union and the States. The
legislative Entries in whichever List they occur should be interpreted with the 'widest amplitude' as
observed in JILUBHAI NANBHA KACHAR, supra. The purpose of the enumeration of legislative
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35272859/ 28
Galactus Funware Technology Private ... vs State Of Karnatka on 14 February, 2022
power is not to define or delimit the description of law that the Parliament or the State Legislatures
may enact in respect AIR 1989 SC 516
- 44 -
of any of the subjects assigned to them. Such a power constitutionally given is plenary in its content
& quality. The enumeration is made to name a subject for the purpose of assigning to that power.
The names or descriptions employed in legislation are usually of the briefest kind; it is more so
when it comes to the constitutions. In this regard what Gray J., of US Supreme Court more than a
century ago observed in JUILLIARD vs. GREENMAN21, becomes instructive.
"The Constitution ... by apt words of designation or general description, marks the
outlines of the powers granted to the National Legislature; but it does not undertake,
with the precision and detail of a code of laws, to enumerate the sub-divisions of
those powers, or to specify all the means by which they may be carried into
execution...".
(d) When a word or an expression acquires a special connotation in law, it can be safely assumed
that the legislature has used such word or expression in its legal sense as distinguished from its
common parlance (1883) 110 US 421
- 45 -
or the dictionary meaning. These legal concepts employed in a Constitution if construed by the
Courts as such, acquire the constitutional spirit. Further when such terms are construed by the Apex
Court to mean a particular thing, other Courts cannot venture to interpret the same to mean
something else. What we are construing is a constitutional concept, i.e., 'Betting & gambling' and
not just two English words. Learned Advocate General's argument of 'widest amplitude' therefore
cannot stretch the contours of a constitutional concept like this to the point of diluting its identity.
Gambling, betting and other associated concepts are not of recent origin. They have been there in
American and English realm of laws since centuries as mentioned in CHAMARBAUGWALLA-1
itself. We are not required to start afresh every time we want to examine the operation of some
terms employed in the Constitution, even if it transpires that these terms do need a revised
construction; we have a basis from which we can start our critique. In A-G FOR NSW vs. BREWARY
- 46 -
EMPLOYEES UNION22, the High Court of Australia (5 judges) observed "...although we are to
interpret the words of the Constitution on the same principles of interpretation as we apply to any
ordinary law, these very principles of interpretation compel us to take into account the nature and
scope of the Act we are interpreting, to remember that it is a Constitution, a mechanism under
which laws are to be made, and not a mere Act which declares what the law is to be...".
IX. SCOPE OF ENTRY 34 IN STATE LIST;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35272859/ 29
Galactus Funware Technology Private ... vs State Of Karnatka on 14 February, 2022
CHAMARBAUGWALA JURISPRUDENCE; GAMES OF SKILL vs. GAMES OF CHANCE:
Learned advocates appearing for the petitioners submitted that the term 'Betting and
gambling' employed in Entry 34, List II having been treated as a constitutional
concept in CHAMARBAUGWALLA I & II and in the cases that followed, as
distinguished from an ordinary legal concept this Court too has to construe it
accordingly. They contended that substantially the Amendment Act being pari
materia with the statutes of other States, the approach of this Court to the matter
(1908) 6 CLR 469, 611-12
- 47 -
needs to be consistent with the relevant decisions of several High Courts in the country. They also
notified that some of these have been affirmed by the Apex Court on challenge. Justice Oliver
Wendell Holmes in TOWNE vs. EISNER23, had said "A word is not a crystal, transparent and
unchanged; it is the skin of a living thought and may vary greatly in colour and content according to
the circumstances and time in which it is used...". The two words namely "Betting" and "gambling"
as employed in Entry 34, List II have to be read conjunctively to mean only betting on gambling
activities that fall within the legislative competence of the State. To put it in a different way, the
word "betting" employed in this Entry takes its colour from the companion word "gambling". Thus,
it is betting in relation to gambling as distinguished from betting that does not depend on skill that
can be regulated by State legislation; the expression "gambling" by its very nature excludes skill. It is
chance that pervasively animates it. This interpretation of the 245 US 418 (1918)
- 48 -
said Entry gains support from the six decade old CHAMARBAUGWALA jurisprudence, as discussed
below:
(i) In CHAMARBAUGWALA-I, supra the Apex Court inter alia was considering
whether the Bombay Lotteries and Prize Competition Act, 1948, is a legislation
relatable to Entry 34, List II, i.e., "Betting and gambling". To answer this question,
the definition of "prize competition"
in the said legislation was examined with all its constituents & variants such as
"gambling prize competition", "gambling adventure", "gambling nature" & "gambling
competition". After undertaking this exercise, the Court observed:
"...On the language used in the definition section of the 1939 Act as well as in the
1948 Act, as originally enacted, there could be no doubt that each of the five kinds of
prize competitions included in the first category to each of which the qualifying
clause applied was of a gambling nature. Nor has it been questioned that the third
category, which comprised " any other competition success in which does not depend
to a substantial degree upon the exercise of skill", constituted a gambling
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35272859/ 30
Galactus Funware Technology Private ... vs State Of Karnatka on 14 February, 2022
competition. At one time the notion was that in order to be branded as gambling the
competition must be one success in which depended entirely on chance. If even a
scintilla of skill was required for success the competition could not be regarded as of
a gambling nature.
- 49 -
The Court of Appeal in the judgment under appeal has shown how opinions have
changed since the earlier decisions were given and it is not necessary for us to discuss
the matter again. It will suffice to say that we agree with the Court of Appeal that a
competition in order to avoid the stigma of gambling must depend to a substantial
degree upon the exercise of skill. Therefore, a competition success wherein does not
depend to a substantial degree upon the exercise of skill is now recognized to be of a
gambling nature."
What emerges from the above observations is that:
gambling is something that does not depend to a substantial degree upon the exercise
of skill, and therefore something which does depend, ought not to be considered as
gambling; as a logical conclusion, a game that involves a substantial amount of skill is
not a gambling.
(ii) In R.M.D.CHAMARBAUGWALA-II, supra the Court was treating the question,
whether it was constitutionally permissible for section 2(d) of the Prize Competition
Act, 1955, which defined "Prize Competition" to take within its embrace not only the
competitions in which success depended on chance but also those wherein success
depended to a substantial
- 50 -
extent on the skill of player. What is observed in CHAMARBAUGWALA-I becomes further clear by
the following observations in this case:
"... If the question whether the Act applies also to prize competitions in which success
depends to a substantial degree on skill is to be answered solely on a literal
construction of s.2
(d), it will be difficult to resist the contention of the petitioners that it does. The
definition of 'prize competition' in s. 2(d) is wide and unqualified in its terms. There
is nothing in the working of it, which limits it to competitions in which success does
not depend to any substantial extent on skill but on chance...that competitions in
which success depends to a substantial extent on skill and competitions in which it
does not so depend, form two distinct and separate categories ... The distinction
between the two classes of competitions has long been recognised in the legislative
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35272859/ 31
Galactus Funware Technology Private ... vs State Of Karnatka on 14 February, 2022
practice of both the United Kingdom and this country, and the Courts have, time and
again, pointed out the characteristic features which differentiate them. And if we are
now to ask ourselves the question, would Parliament have enacted the law in
question if it had known that it would fail as regards competitions involving skill,
there can be no doubt, having regard to the history of the legislation, as to what our
answer would be ... The conclusion is therefore inescapable that the impugned
provisions, assuming that they apply by virtue of the definition in s. 2(d) to all kinds
of competitions, are severable in their applications to competitions in which success
does not depend to any substantial extent on skill..."
- 51 -
(iii) In K. SATYANARAYANA, the Apex Court was examining as to whether the rummy was a game
of chance or a game of skill. Strangely, CHAMARBAUGWALAS I & II do not find a reference in this
decision; however, what the Court observed being consistent with the said decisions and the
following observations are profitably reproduced:
"12. ... The game of rummy is not a game entirely of chance like the "three-card" game
mentioned in the Madras case to which we were referred. The "three card game
which goes under different names such as "flush", "brag" etc. Is a game of pure
chance. Rummy, on the other hand, requires certain amount of skill because the fall
of the cards has to be memorised and the building up of Rummy requires
considerable skill in holding and discarding cards. WE cannot, therefore, say that the
game of rummy is a game of entire chance. It is mainly and preponderantly a game of
skill. The chance in Rummy is of the same character as the chance in a deal at a game
of bridge. In fact in all games in which cards are shuffled and dealt out, there is an
element of chance, because the distribution of the card is not according to any set
pattern but is dependent upon how the cards find their place in the shuffled pack.
From this alone it cannot be said that Rummy is a game of chance and there is no
skill involved in it..."
- 52 -
(iv) In K.R. Lakshmanan, a Three Judge Bench of the Apex Court was examining the vires of
amendments to the Madras City Police Act, 1888 and the Madras Gaming Act, 1940 whereby the
exception carved out for wagering on horse-racing from the definition of "gaming" was deleted,
much like the effect of the Amendment Act herein which inter alia widens the definition of "gaming"
to include "wagering on games of skill", that hitherto enjoyed constitutional protection. Having
considered CHAMARBAUGWALAS-I & II, K.SATYANARAYANA and some notable decisions of
foreign jurisdictions, the Court succinctly stated the difference between a game of chance and a
game of skill, as under:
"3. The new Encyclopedia Britannica defines gambling as "The betting or staking of
something of value, with consciousness of risk and hope of gain on the outcome of a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35272859/ 32
Galactus Funware Technology Private ... vs State Of Karnatka on 14 February, 2022
game, a contest, or an uncertain event the result of which may be determined by
chance or accident or have an unexpected result by reason of the better's
miscalculations".
According to Black's Law Dictionary (Sixth Edition) "gambling involves, not only chance, but a hope
of gaining something beyond the amount played. Gambling consists of consideration, an element of
chance and a
- 53 -
reward... Gambling in a nut-shell is payment of a price for a chance to win a prize. Games may be of
chance, or of skill or of skill and chance combined. A game of chance is determined entirely or in
part by lot or mere luck. The throw of the dice, the turning of the wheel, the shuffling of the cards,
are all modes of chance. In these games the result is wholly uncertain and doubtful. No human mind
knows or can know what it will be until the dice is thrown, the wheel stops its revolution or the
dealer has dealt with the cards. A game of skill, on the other hand - although the element of chance
necessarily cannot be entirely eliminated- is one in which success depends principally upon the
superior knowledge, training, attention, experience and adroitness of the player."
"33. The expression `gaming' in the two Acts has to be interpreted in the light of the
law laid-down by this Court in the two Chamarbaugwala cases, wherein it has been
authoritatively held that a competition which substantially depends on skill is not
gambling. Gaming is the act or practice of gambling on a game of chance. It is staking
on chance where chance is the controlling factor. `Gaming' in the two Acts would,
therefore, mean wagering or betting on games of chance. It would not include games
of skill like horse-racing. ... We, therefore, hold that wagering or betting on
horse-racing - a game of skill - does not come within the definition of `gaming' under
the two Acts. 34... Even if there is wagering or betting with the Club it is on a game of
mere skill and as such it would not be 'gaming' under the two Acts."
X. AS TO WHAT OTHER HIGH COURTS IN THE COUNTRY VIEWED GAMES OF SKILL AS:
- 54 -
(i) The Punjab & Haryana High Court in VARUN GUMBER, supra held that the
fantasy games predominantly involve skill and therefore, do not fall within gambling
activities and that the said games are protected u/a 19(1)(g) of the Constitution. The
matter went to the Apex Court in SLP No.026642/2017 and came to be dismissed on
15.9.2017.
(ii) A Division Bench of Hon'ble Bombay High Court in GURDEEP SINGH SACHAR
vs. UNION OF INDIA24 was considering in PIL jurisdiction as to whether playing of
fantasy games by virtual teams amounted to gambling. Having discussed
CHAMARBAUGHWALAS, K.R.LAKSHMANAN, etc., answered the question in the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35272859/ 33
Galactus Funware Technology Private ... vs State Of Karnatka on 14 February, 2022
negative specifically recording a finding that the success in dream 11 fantasy sports
depends upon users exercise of skill based on superior knowledge, judgment and
attention, and that the result of the game was not dependent on the winning or losing
of the particular team in the real world game on any particular day. The
- 55 -
Court said "It is undoubtedly a game of skill and not a game of chance." The matter was carried
upward to the Apex Court in SLP (Criminal) No.43346/2019 which came to be dismissed on
13.12.2019.
(iii) The Division Bench of Hon'ble High Court of Madras in JUNGLEE GAMES INDIA PRIVATE
LIMITED vs. STATE OF T.N25, having extensively discussed the two CHAMARBAUGWALAS and
K.SATYANARAYANA as further developed in K.R. LAKSHMANAN, has invalidated Act 1 of 2021
which had amended the Tamil Nadu Gaming Act, 1930, as being ultra vires the Constitution. The
observations at paragraph 125 of the judgment are profitably reproduced below:
" It is in such light that "Betting and gambling" in Entry 34 of the State List has to be
seen, where betting cannot be divorced from gambling and treated as an additional
field for the State to legislate on, apart from the betting involved in gambling. Since
gambling is judicially defined, the betting that the State can legislate on has to be the
betting pertaining to gambling; ergo, betting only on games of chance. At any rate,
even otherwise, the judgments in the two Chamarbaugwala cases and in (2019) SCC
OnLine BOM 13059 (2021) SCC Online MAD 2762 (DB)
- 56 -
K.R.Lakshmanan also instruct that the concept of betting in the Entry cannot cover games of skill..."
(iv) Following the Apex Court Rulings and the above Madras decision, a learned Single Judge of
Hon'ble Kerala High Court in HEAD DIGITAL WORKS PRIVATE LIMITED vs. STATE OF
KERALA26 quashed a statutory notification that was issued under Section 14A of the Kerala Gaming
Act, 1960 which had proscribed online rummy played for stakes. The Court at paragraph 36 of its
judgment observed: ".... As such playing for stakes or playing not for stakes can never be a criterion
to find out whether a game is a game of skill. ... The game of Online Rummy will also have to be held
to be a game of skill..."
(v) A Division Bench of Hon'ble Rajasthan High Court in RAVINDRA SINGH CHAUDHARY vs.
UNION OF INDIA AND OTHERS27 was considering in PIL jurisdiction as to whether online
fantasy sports/games (2021) SCC Online Ker 3592 2020 (4) RLW 3322 (Raj)
- 57 -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35272859/ 34
Galactus Funware Technology Private ... vs State Of Karnatka on 14 February, 2022
offered on dream 11 platform amounted to gambling/betting. Having inter alia referred to
CHAMARBAUGWALA and K.R.LAKSHMANAN, the question was answered in the negative and
writ petition was dismissed with costs. The Court also discussed its decision in CHANDRESH
SANKHLA vs. STATE OF RAJASTAN28 which had already considered the said issue. Further,
challenge to the said decision in AVINASH MEHROTRA vs. STATE OF RAJASTAN29 came to be
repelled by the Apex Court on 30.7.2021. It is relevant to mention that the Court referred to the
decision of New York Supreme Court in WHITE vs. CUOMO30, which had taken the view that
games of the kind were games of chance. This should be a complete answer to the learned AG who
heavily banked upon decision of a US Court in support of his contention.
Note: The collective ratio unmistakably emerging from all the decisions mentioned in paragraphs IX
& X above put succinctly is: A game of chance and a game of (2020) SCC Online RAJ 264 2020 NY
Slip Op 00895, decided on 6.2.2020
- 58 -
skill although are not poles asunder, they are two distinct legal concepts of constitutional
significance. The distinction lies in the amount of skill involved in the games. There may not be a
game of chance which does not involve a scintilla of skill and similarly, there is no game of skill
which does not involve some elements of chance. Whether a game is, a 'game of chance' or a 'game
of skill', is to be adjudged by applying the Predominance Test: a game involving substantial degree
of skill, is not a game of chance, but is only a game of skill and that it does not cease to be one even
when played with stakes. As a corollary of this, a game not involving substantial degree of skill, is
not a game of skill but is only a game of chance and therefore falls within the scope of Entry 34 in
the State List.
XI. AS TO THE VIEW OF FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS ABOUT GAMES OF SKILL:
(i) In UNITED STATES OF AMERICA vs. LAWRENCE DICRISTINA31, the Second
US Circuit of Appeal, New York, tossed out the conviction and vacated the 886 F.
Supp. 2d 164, decided in 2012
- 59 -
indictment of Mr. Lawrence who ran the warehouse wherein the poker game Texas Hold' Em was
played. He was taking 5 % of each nights earning to cover the cost of his staff & profit for himself. In
this game, the pot went not to the luckiest among the participants, but to the most deft i.e., the
player who could guess his opponents' intentions and disguise his own, make calculated decisions
on when to hold & fold, and quickly decide how much to wager. A waitress floated around with food
& drinks and play lasted until breakfast. Judge Jack B. Weinstein held that poker is more a game of
skill than a game of chance and therefore, game operators cannot be prosecuted under vague federal
law that prohibits running an illegal gambling business. Although this decision was reversed in
appeal, the finding that poker is a game of skill, is left undisturbed.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35272859/ 35
Galactus Funware Technology Private ... vs State Of Karnatka on 14 February, 2022
(ii) 'The Gambling Law Review: Israel by Liran Barak (Herzog Fox & Neeman) dated 07.06.2021
states that: The Israeli Penal Law 5737-1977 places a general ban on gambling activity, including all
forms of lotteries,
- 60 -
betting and games of chance. Further restrictions under the Penal Law outlaw ancillary services
pertaining to gambling such as the operation of venues where gaming activity takes place. Chapter
12 of the Penal Law defines 'prohibited game' as a game at which a person may win money, valuable
consideration or a benefit according to the result of a game, those results depending more on chance
than on understanding or ability. The Supreme Court of Israel in October 2018 decided a tax dispute
in between AMIT AMESHVILLI RAFI vs. ASSESSING OFFICER32, TEL AVIV (4) relating to
winnings generated by a poker player in tournaments outside the country and opined that poker
may not be a game of chance.
(iii) 'The Gambling Law Review: Australia' by Jamie Nettelson, Shanna Protic Dib and Brodie
Campbell dated 07.06.2021 mentions about a gambling case in LOTTOLAND AUSTRALIA PTY LTD
vs. AUSTRALIAN COMMISSION AND MEDIA AUTHORITY33, decided by Decided by Supreme
Court of Israel in Civil Appeal No.476/17 2019 NSWSC 1041
- 61 -
the Supreme Court of New South Wales which having analysed the distinction between a 'bet' and a
'game' in the context of Interactive Gaming Act 2019 (IGA) held that petitioner's products are
betting products and it was providing a 'lawful gambling service' in compliance with the IGA. The
inarticulate premise of this judgment is that gaming activities that involve skill do not fall into
prohibited categories of gambling i.e., nearly our predominance test.
XII. AS TO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ACTUAL GAMES & VIRTUAL GAMES, AND IF ALL
ONLINE GAMES ARE GAMES OF CHANCE:
The vehement contention of Learned Advocate General that gaming includes both a
'game of chance' and a 'game of skill', and sometimes also a combination of both, is
not supported by his reliance on M.J SIVANI vs. STATE OF KARNATAKA34. We are
not convinced that M.J. SIVANI recognises a functional difference between actual
games and virtual games. This case was decided on the basis of a wider interpretation
of the definition of 'gaming' in the context of a legislation which
- 62 -
was enacted to regulate the running of video parlours and not banning of video
games; true it is that the Apex Court treated certain video games as falling within the
class of 'games of chance' and not of 'games of skill'.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35272859/ 36
Galactus Funware Technology Private ... vs State Of Karnatka on 14 February, 2022
However, such a conclusion was arrived at because of manipulation potential of
machines that was demonstrated by the reports of a committee of senior police
officers; this report specifically stated about the tampering of video game machines
for eliminating the chance of winning. This decision cannot be construed repugnant
to Chamarbaugwala jurisprudence as explained in K.R.LAKSHMANAN. We are of a
considered view that the games of skill do not metamorphise into games of chance
merely because they are played online, ceteris paribus. Thus, SIVANI is not the best
vehicle for drawing a distinction between actual games and virtual games. What
heavily weighed with the Court in the said decision was the adverse police report. It is
pertinent to recall Lord Halsbury's observation in QUINN vs. 1995 (6) SCC 289
- 63 -
LEATHAM35: that a case is only authority for what it actually decides in a given fact
matrix and not for a proposition that may seem to flow logically from what is decided.
This observation received its imprimatur in STATE OF ORISSA vs. SUDHANSU
SEKHAR MISRA36.
XIII. AS TO ENTRY 1 (Public Order), ENTRY 2 (Police) & ENTRY 26 (Trade and
commerce) IN THE STATE LIST BEING THE FIELDS OF LEGISLATIVE POWER.
(a) The learned Advocate General appearing for the respondents and the learned
Advocate Mr. Shridhar Prabhu appearing for the intervener passionately contended
that the power to enact a statute can be traceable to Articles 245 & 246 read with
multiple legislative Entries; this as a proposition is correct vide UJAGAR PRINTS,
supra. They rely inter alia upon Entry 1 (Public order) and Entry 2 (Police). However,
the invocability of this proposition is stoutly disputed by the petitioners in the given
fact matrix of the case. The vehement contention of learned AG that several persons
and families have been ruined because of online games (1901) A.C 495 AIR 1968 SC
647
- 64 -
and that all over the State, police have registered thousands of cases, may be arguably true. With the
proliferation of online platforms, owing to the digital revolution, the entire landscape of gaming has
undergone a 'cataclysmic change'. Young minds are prone to addiction to the cyber games, cannot
be much disputed. All this however, does not fit into the parameters of Entry 1 (Public order) and
Entry 2 (Police), of the State List howsoever liberally one may construe them. Games of skill have
been judicially held to be 'business' activities protected under Article 19(1) (g) vide
CHAMARBAUGWALA-II: at paragraph 5 it is observed:"...As regards competitions which involve
substantial skill however, different considerations arise. They are business activities, the protection
of which is guaranteed by Article 19(1) (g)..." It is pertinent to mention that in the said decision Apex
Court also observed that power to regulate games of skill lies with the State Legislature under Entry
26, List II i.e., Trade and commerce. If that be so, an activity which is not a res extra commercium
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35272859/ 37
Galactus Funware Technology Private ... vs State Of Karnatka on 14 February, 2022
cannot intrinsically give rise to any
- 65 -
issue of 'Public order'. There is no scope for invoking Entry 2 in the State List, either.
(b) The expression "Public order" in the State List implies an activity which affects the public at
large and therefore, individual instances that do not generate public disorder may not fit into the
same. The Apex Court in BANKA SNEHA SHEELA vs. STATE OF TELANGANA37 observed: "There
can be no doubt that for 'public order' to be disturbed, there must in turn be public disorder. Mere
contravention of law such as indulging in cheating or criminal breach of trust certainly affects 'law
and order' but before it can be said to affect 'public order', it must affect the community or the public
at large." Added, the cases registered by the police are for the games that have eventually become
offences after the amendment which is put in challenge and therefore, much cannot be derived from
the factum of such registration. It is also relevant to quote the observations (2021) SCC Online SC
530 at para 13
- 66 -
of the Apex Court in SUPT. CENTRAL PRISON vs. RAM MANOHAR LOHIA38:
"... The distinction does not ignore the necessity for intimate connection between the
Act and the public order sought to be maintained by the Act. The restriction made 'in
the interest of public order' must also have reasonable relation to the object sought to
be achieved i.e., the public order. If the restriction has no proximate relationship to
the achievement of public order, it cannot be said that the restriction is a reasonable
restriction within the meaning of the said clause..."
XIV. AS TO ENTRY 6 (Public health and
sanitation) IN STATE LIST:
(a) Learned Advocate General and Mr. Sridhar
Prabhu next contended that: the World Health
Organization (WHO) is the United Nations Specialized Agency for health. Being an
intergovernmental agency, it works in collaboration with its Member States and
provides leadership on global health matters by shaping the health research agenda,
setting norms & standards articulating policy options, providing technical support to
countries and monitoring and assessing health trends.
India is a party signatory to the WHO w.e.f. 12.1.1948.

- 67 -
Since 2014, WHO having conducted research and activities relating to the public health implications
of the excessive use of internet, computers, smart phones & other similar electronic devices, has in
the 11th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) of 2018 clinically recognized
the same as a pernicious syndrome. The pattern of gaming behaviour is of such a nature & intensity
that it results in marked distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational or
occupational functioning. The health concerns associated with gaming behaviour are not limited to
gaming disorder but extend to other aspects of health such as insufficient physical activity,
unhealthy diet, problems with eye sight or hearing, musculoskeletal problems, sleep deprivation,
aggressive behaviour & depression and psychosocial functioning. They drew attention of the Court
to the relevant part of the WHO literature at Annexure-R2, Volume I of the Statement of Objections
dated 23.11.2021 contending that our Constitution being an organic document, the term 'Public
health and sanitation' in Entry 6 of the State List
- 68 -
should be broadly interpreted to include online games of the kind.
(b) The above view ingeniously canvassed by the learned Advocate General for the respondents and
Mr.Shridhar Prabhu for the Intervener is bit difficult to agree with and reasons are not far to seek:
that our Constitution as any other, is an organic document is true. However, that per se does not
lend credence to the contention that the policy considerations of International Organizations like
WHO functioning under UN aegis or recognition, should necessarily influence the interpretation to
be placed on the constitutional provisions in general and the legislative Entries in the State List, in
particular. Article 51 of the Constitution inter alia directs fostering respect for international law and
treaty obligations. This direction essentially addresses the Parliament and the Central Government
inasmuch as the power to legislate in respect of matters concerning International Conferences,
Treaties and Agreements is exclusively vested in the Parliament vide Article 253 read with Entry 97
of the Union List. Entry
- 69 -
14 of this List confers on the Union Parliament exclusive power to make laws with respect to
"entering into treaties and agreements with foreign countries and implementing of treaties,
agreements and conventions with foreign countries". Also Entry 10 of that List provides for 'Foreign
affairs; all matters which bring the Union into relation with any Foreign Country'. Article 253 is
intended to make it clear that the power to enter into treaties conferred on Parliament, carries with
it, as incidental thereto, a power to invade the State List to enable the Union to implement the
treaty. Thus a law passed by Parliament to give effect to an international convention shall not be
invalidated on the ground that it contained provisions relating to the State subjects. In view of all
this, the meaning and scope of the Entry in question cannot be widened, when the contours of law in
this regard have already been earmarked in a catena of decisions of the Apex Court.

XV. AS TO RIGHT TO SPEECH & EXPRESSION UNDER ARTICLE 19(1)(a) AND RIGHT TO LIFE
& PERSONAL LIBERTY UNDER ARTICLE 21:
- 70 -
(a) Petitioners argue that playing of games of skill is a form of speech & expression
guaranteed under Article 19(1) (a) and that it is one of the facets of personal liberty as
well protected under Article 21 and therefore, there cannot be unreasonable
restriction on the same.
They submit that any legislative restriction for being valid has to pass the muster of Article 19(2) of
the Constitution which enumerates specific grounds and that there is a heavier onus resting on the
shoulders of the State to justify restriction which constitutes an absolute embargo. Learned
Advocate General contends to the contrary pointing out the likely ill-effects of online gaming in
general and their behavioural addiction potential qua the younger generation in particular. He
submits that under our constitutional scheme, no rights of individuals are accorded in absolute term
and that individuals' interest has to yield to the larger societal interest. According to him, the
Amendment Act having been enacted keeping this in mind, cannot be faltered in Judicial Review.
He also submits that in matter like this the judicial organ of the State should show due
- 71 -
deference to the decisions of the Co-ordinate organ namely the Legislature.
(b) In Harvard Law Review VOL-IV, December, 15, 1890, Samuel D Warren (Attorney) and Louis D
Brandeis (later, Judge of US Supreme Court) in December, 1890 had prophetically wrote:
"...Similar to the expansion of the right to life was the growth of the legal conception
of property. From corporeal property arose the incorporeal rights issuing out of it;
and then there opened the wide realm of intangible property, in the products and
process of the mind, as words of literature and art, goodwill, trade secrets, and
trademarks. This development of the law was inevitable. The intense intellectual and
emotional life, and the heightening of sensations which came with the advance of
civilization, made it clear to men that only a part of the pain, pleasure, and profit of
life lay in physical things. Thoughts, emotions, and sensations demanded legal
recognition, and the beautiful capacity for growth which characterizes the common
law enabled the judges to afford the requisite protection, without the interposition of
the legislature."
The freedoms guaranteed inter alia under Articles 19 & 21 have been broadening from precedent to
precedent, needs no elaboration. The right to speech & expression
- 72 -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35272859/ 40
Galactus Funware Technology Private ... vs State Of Karnatka on 14 February, 2022
has expanded to include even a right to vote vide UNION OF INDIA vs. THE ASSOCIATION FOR
DEMOCRATIC REFORMS39. Similarly, the march of law from A.K.GOPALAN vs. STATE OF
MADRAS40 to K S PUTTASWAMY, supra has broadened the contours of right to life & personal
liberty, exponentially. Several rights guaranteed in Part III of the Constitution are no longer treated
as water tight compartments, since they have correlative content and each illuminates the penumbra
of other by interplay. Political, social & economic changes have entailed the recognition of new
rights such as right to privacy. The following observations in K.S PUTTASWAMY, expounding on
freedom & liberty are worth reproducing:
"The notion that liberty only consists of freedom from restraint does not complete the
universe of its discourse. Broader notions of liberty are cognizant of the fact that
individuals must be enabled to pursue their capacities to the fullest degree. This
approach to understand the content of freedom construes the ability to lead a
dignified existence as essential to the conception of liberty and freedom... If true
freedom is to be achieved through the removal (2002) 5 SCC 294 (AIR 1950 SC 27)
- 73 -
of conditions which cause social and economic deprivation, the role of the State is not confined to an
absence of restraint. On the contrary the State has a positive obligation to enhance individual
capabilities... In the realization of basic rights, the State is subject to positive duties to further the
fulfillment of freedom..."
(c) GAMES: THEIR NATURE & IMPORTANCE TO MEANINGFUL LIFE:
(i) Eric Berne, M.D, an acclaimed Canadian psychiatrist (1910-1970) in his "GAMES
PEOPLE PLAY"
(Penguin-1964) analyses games as "an ongoing series of complimentary ulterior
transactions to a well defined, predictable outcome. Descriptively, it is a recurring set
of transactions, often repetitious, superficially plausible, with a concealed motivation;
or, more colloquially, a series of moves with a snare or 'gimmick'. Games are clearly
differentiated from procedures, rituals, and passtimes by two chief characteristics:
their ulterior quality and pay- off..." What is written on the blurb is even more
instructive: "We all play games. In the workplace, in the bedroom, even, when we are
not aware of it. Every personal encounter is a mental contest, an opportunity to assert
our will."
- 74 -
(ii) Games involve the psychology of relationships and variable patterns of behaviour that reveal the
hidden feelings & emotions of individuals and their underlying motivations. Games, art & culture
have a sort of psychological singularity. Games have artistic & recreational value. Whether online or
offline, they are designed to entertain as well as to inform. Games have emotive content whose
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35272859/ 41
Galactus Funware Technology Private ... vs State Of Karnatka on 14 February, 2022
effects tend more toward the cognitive. The thin line between entertainment and information often
becomes elusive. Games arguably may not convey a discernible message, but even the non- cognitive
forms of expressions can be a means of promoting self-development and therefore, do not readily
fall within the 'unprotected category of expression.' The interactivity of online games does not cut
their status as expression, but enhances the expressive impact of a medium. Playing of games
creates a mood as an abstract art, apart from causing a subtle shaping of thoughts which
characterizes all artistic expression. These provisions of our constitution having become expansive
by the judicial process do not deny protection to 'abstract
- 75 -
painting, avant-garde music and nonsensical poetry'. Therefore, the games of skill fall within the
protective contours of Article 19(1)(a) & Article 21, of course subject to reasonable restriction by law.
(d) Judge Antonin Scalia of US Supreme Court had famously remarked, "If you had to pick...one
freedom...that is the most essential to the functioning of a democracy, it has to be the freedom of
speech." In SECRETARY, MINISTRY OF INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING, GOVERNMENT
OF INDIA AND OTHERS vs. CRICKET ASSOCIATION OF BENGAL AND OTHERS41, the Apex
Court considered the question of right to telecast sports event, inter alia referring to Article 10 of the
European Convention on Human Rights which reads:
"Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to
hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference
by public authority and regardless of frontiers."
(1995) 2 SCC 161
- 76 -
Thereafter, the Court summarised the law on the freedom of speech & expression under Article
19(1)(a) as restricted by Article 19(2) thus: - "The freedom of speech and expression includes right to
acquire information and to disseminate it. Freedom of speech and expression is necessary, for
self-fulfilment. It is the best way to find a truest model of anything, since it is only through it that the
widest possible range of ideas can circulate. Equally important is the role it plays in facilitating
artistic and scholarly endeavours of all sorts..." The Court dealt with the right of telecasting sports
and observed:
"In a team event such as cricket, football, hockey etc., there is both individual and
collective expression...However, the right to freedom of speech and expression also
includes the right to educate, to inform and to entertain and also the right to be
educated, informed and entertained... The right to telecast sporting event will
therefore also include the right to educate and inform the present and the prospective
sportsmen interested in the particular game and also to inform and entertain the
lovers of the game. Hence, when a telecaster desires to telecast a sporting event, it is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35272859/ 42
Galactus Funware Technology Private ... vs State Of Karnatka on 14 February, 2022
incorrect to say that the free-speech element is absent from his right."
XVI. VIRTUAL GAMES AND ELEMENTS OF EXPRESSION AS US COURTS VIEW THEM:
- 77 -
(a) The enactment of Part III of our Constitution by the Constituent Assembly and its
progressive interpretation by the Courts was influenced inter alia by the American
jurisprudence. The growth of legal thought that occurs on a farthest foreign soil does
influence others around the globe which has become small due to advancement of
science & technology. The Apex Court in INDIAN EXPRESS NEWSPAPERS vs.
UNION OF INDIA42 observed:
"While examining the constitutionality of a law which is alleged to contravene Article
19(1)(a) of the Constitution, we cannot, no doubt, be solely guided by the decisions of
the Supreme Court of the United States of America. But in order to understand the
basic principles of freedom of speech and expression and the need for that freedom in
a democratic country, we may take them into consideration...".
The above observations of Hon'ble E.S.Venkataramiah J. justifiably prompt us to look to how the
American law of freedom of speech & expression has been shaped by judicial process over the
decades.
(1985) 1 SCC 641
- 78 -
(b) In 1915, the US Supreme Court in MUTUAL FILM CORPORATION vs. INDUSTRIAL
COMMISSION OF OHIO43, was considering the validity of Ohio statute that required distributors
to submit their films to the Board of Censors before they could be presented for the public view. The
Court had held that motion pictures were not a form of expression eligible for constitutional
protection under the First Amendment. However, after 37 years, this view was laid to rest in
JOSEPH BURSTYN, INC vs. WILSON44 wherein it has been observed that the motion pictures do
not fall outside the category of 'unprotected expression' in terms of First and Fourteenth
Amendments.
(c) Till 2001 i.e., AMERICAN AMUSEMENT MACHINE ASSOCIATION vs. KENDRICK45, Courts
had denied constitutional protection to video-games. Cases of this kind arose from Municipal
Ordinances restricting access to arcades. However, in INTERACTIVE DIGITAL 236 US 230 343 US
495 (1952) 244 F.3d 572
- 79 -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35272859/ 43
Galactus Funware Technology Private ... vs State Of Karnatka on 14 February, 2022
SOFTWARE ASSOCIATION vs. ST. LOUIS COUNTY46 Courts held that they too constitute a form
of expression presumptively entitled to constitutional protection and that they do not fall into any
'categories of unprotected speech'.
(d) The US Supreme Court in BROWN vs. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSOCIATION47 was
considering the challenge to a California law that restricted the sale or rental of violent video-games
to minors. Justice Antonin Scalia reasoned that such a law does not comport with the First
Amendment inasmuch as these games too, qualify for protection under the shadow of Amendment
on par with books, plays & movies, although they communicate ideas through familiar literal devices
and features distinctive to the medium. The Court inter alia observed that the basic principles of
freedom of speech do not vary with a new and different communication medium.
329 F 3d 954 (8th Cir 2003), 564 US 786 (2011)
- 80 -
(e) The views of Prof. Paul E Salamanca, University of Kentucky College of Law expressed in
'VIDEOGAMES AS A PROTECTED FORM OF EXPRESSION' published in Georgia Law Review,
Vol. 40, No.1 (2005) PP 153-206 are instructive:
"...Courts have properly concluded that the First Amendment protects video games as
a form of expression. These games possess all the characteristics of an art form. First,
like other art, they are representational. They may look like universes full of gothic
architecture, labyrinthine tunnels, and grotesque characters, but in fact they are
electronic representations of such things, much like paintings, movies, or TV shows.
Second, video games often have aesthetic value. The architecture depicted in a video
game, for example, can be magnificent, squalid, or both. Indeed, many schools now
teach the art and science of creating interactive video games. Third, these games
often tie music and narration to the player's movement through the various levels,
and these features can be every bit as evocative as the soundtrack of a film or
broadcast. Finally, video games often build upon powerful, elemental themes, just
like fairy tales or epic poems... "
XVII. AS TO REASONABLE RESTRICTION UNDER ARTICLE 19(2) ON RIGHT TO
SPEECH & EXPRESSION UNDER ARTICLE 19(1)(a) AND REGULATION OF
PERSONAL LIBERTY UNDER ARTICLE 21:
(a) What a former Associate Justice of the US Supreme Court, Anthony Kennedy
observed in UNITED
- 81 -
STATES vs. PLAYBOY ENTERTAINMENT GROUP, INC.,48 is worth quoting:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35272859/ 44
Galactus Funware Technology Private ... vs State Of Karnatka on 14 February, 2022
"When a student first encounters our free speech jurisprudence, he or she might
think it is influenced by the philosophy that one idea is as good as any other, and that
in art and literature, objective standards of style, taste, decorum, beauty, and
esthetics are deemed by the Constitution to be inappropriate, indeed unattainable.
Quite the opposite is true. The Constitution no more enforces a relativistic philosophy
or moral nihilism than it does any other point of view. The Constitution exists
precisely so that opinions and judgments, including esthetic and moral judgments
about art and literature, can be formed, tested, and expressed. What the Constitution
says is that these judgments are for the individual to make, not for the Government to
decree, even with the mandate or approval of a majority. Technology expands the
capacity to choose; and it denies the potential of this revolution if we assume the
Government is best positioned to make these choices for us."
The Hon'ble Supreme Court in SHREYA SINGHAL vs. UNION OF INDIA49 observed:
"11. This last judgment is important in that it refers to the "market place of ideas"
concept that has permeated American Law. This was put in the felicitous words of Justice Holmes in
his famous dissent in Abrams v. United States, 250 US 616 (1919), thus: "But 529 U.S. 803 (2000)
(2015) 5 SCC 1supra at paragraph 11
- 82 -
when men have realized that time has upset many fighting faiths, they may come to believe even
more than they believe the very foundations of their own conduct that the ultimate good desired is
better reached by free trade in ideas-that the best test of truth is the power of thought to get itself
accepted in the competition of the market, and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes
safely can be carried out. That at any rate is the theory of our Constitution."
(b) Robert H. Bork, a Judge of U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, in his article "Neutral
Principles and some first Amendment Problems, published in Indiana Law Journal, Vol. 47: Issue 1
(1971), writes:
"An individual may develop his faculties or derive pleasure from trading on the stock
market, following his profession as a river port pilot, working as a barmaid, engaging
in sexual activity, playing tennis, rigging prices or in any of thousands of other
endeavours...." Given the possibilities of expression in any medium, the guarantee
enacted in Article 19 (1) (a) & (g) and Article 21 have to be broadly construed as to
protect all forms of activities that further the self-realization of value. That is a
premise implicit in these provisions. The Court interpreting the fundamental
guarantees has to identify
- 83 -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35272859/ 45
Galactus Funware Technology Private ... vs State Of Karnatka on 14 February, 2022
zones in which free people could experiment and develop their personalities in terms
of enhanced character and virtue without causing excessive, immediate or discernible
harm to others. Online games do not have any such demonstrable effect.
(c) The predicate for Article 19(1)(a) is poised to include not only artistic expression
having an outward effect upon socio political thought but also inarticulate expression
having a predominantly inward effect. What Justice Louis Brandies famously said in
WHITNEY vs. CALIFORNIA50 is worth reproducing:
"Those who won our independence believed that the final end of the state was to
make men free to develop their faculties, and that in its government the deliberative
forces should prevail over the arbitrary. They valued liberty both as an end and as a
means. They believed liberty to be the secret of happiness and courage to be the
secret of liberty. They believed that freedom to think as you will and to speak as you
think are means indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth; that
without free speech and assembly discussion would be futile...They recognized the
risks to which all human institutions are subject. But they knew that order cannot be
secured merely through fear of punishment for its infraction; 247 US 357 (1927)
- 84 -
that it is hazardous to discourage thought, hope and imagination; that fear breeds
repression; that repression breeds hate; that hate menaces stable government; that
the path of safety lies in the opportunity to discuss freely supposed grievances and
proposed remedies..."
XVIII. AS TO 'SCARE ARGUMENT' OF THE
STATE VERSUS RESEARCH STUDIES AND
EMPIRICAL DATA:
(a) The vehement contention of learned
Advocate General appearing for the State that the Amendment Act has been brought
in to curb the menace of online gaming which, has deleterious effect on the societal
interest, has to be examined on the touchstone of the provisions of Articles 19 & 21.
The freedoms enumerated inter alia in these Articles are those great in basic rights
which are recognized as the natural rights inherent in the status of any individual.
But none of these rights is absolute; although being inalienable rights, they are liable
to suffer reasonable restrictions that may be imposed by law. The 'scare argument' of
deleterious effect is not supported by the empirical data loaded to the record of the
case and by
- 85 -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35272859/ 46
Galactus Funware Technology Private ... vs State Of Karnatka on 14 February, 2022
the research material available in the public domain. What the experts have opined is
briefly stated below:
(i) The Discussion Paper titled "THE EPIDEMIOLOGY AND IMPACT OF
GAMBLING DISORDER AND OTHER GAMBLING-RELATED HARM" published by
WHO Forum on alcohol, drugs and addictive behaviors dated 26-28 June 2017
states:
"Problem gambling is one of the negative impacts of the post mid-1980s gambling
expansion... concerns about these impacts on the part of civil society and
governments has led to policy and other initiatives intended to reduce harm
associated with this expansion. There has been a focus on problem gambling and the
provision of information, self-help and treatment... problem gambling and other
gambling related harm are not widely regarded as a health issue or priority...Many of
the non- gambling risk and protective factors for at-risk and problem gambling are
common to other mental health and addiction disorders. Reducing these risk factors
and strengthening protective factors can be expected to have health and social
benefits that extend beyond problem gambling and gambling related
harm...Additional risk factors identified in a number of studies include living in high
deprivation neighbourhoods, membership of particular religious groups, lack of
formal education and unemployed status...It appears likely that the combination of
heightened vulnerability, economic and social disadvantage and high gambling
exposure plays a major part
- 86 -
in problem gambling development (Abbott, 2017a). "
(ii) The National Centre for Responsible Gaming (NCRG) in its White Paper titled "Internet
Gambling: An Emerging Field of Research" by Christine Reilly and Nathan Smith, having referred to
the Harvard Study on internet gambling i.e., "The road less travelled: Moving from distribution to
determinants in the study of gambling epidemiology", Can J Psych. 2004; 49 (8) (504-516)
concludes:
"Both, the online gaming industry and the field of research on the health risks of this
form of gambling are in their infancy. It is, therefore, premature to assume that
Internet gambling will have deleterious health effects. The next phase of research will
be vital to better understanding how to interpret "disordered" patterns and testing
the effectiveness of responsible gaming interventions."
(iii) Professor Malcolm K. Sparrow, John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University, in
his research study titled "CAN INTERNET GAMBLING BE EFFECTIVELY REGULATED?
MANAGING THE RISKS (2009)" writes:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35272859/ 47
Galactus Funware Technology Private ... vs State Of Karnatka on 14 February, 2022
- 87 -
"Some studies have claimed an
association between increased gambling
exposure and increased incidence of problem gambling. In addition, commentators
have suggested that the increased accessibility inherent in online gambling magnifies
such risks. However, more recent studies specific to online gambling, most conducted
since the advent of legal and regulated online gambling, have indicated that online
gambling does not inherently encourage excessive gambling. Most gamblers placed
fewer than four bets per day, and sports gamblers tended to moderate their play
based on their wins and losses; i.e., they played less often when they lost money and
more often when they won money. Also, a large- scale British study in 2007 found no
increase in the rate of problem gambling in the United Kingdom since 1999 despite a
large increase in the number of new gambling opportunities... We believe that
regulators should be able to design sufficient protections to prevent any significant
growth in problem gambling that results from legalization. Moreover, a proportion of
the tax revenues and licensing fees derived from the U.S.-based industry could be
used to substantially bolster the level of support for educational programs and
services...."
(iv) Mr. Shridhar Prabhu appearing for the Intervener draws our attention to the
following observations of European Court of Justice in CARMEN MEDIA GROUP
LTD VS. LAND SCHLESWIG-HOLSTEIN
- 88 -
AND INNENMINISTER DES LANDES SCHLESWIG- HOLSTEIN CASE51 decided on 8th
September 2010.
"It should be noted that, in the same way, the characteristics specific to the offer of
games of chance by the internet may prove to be a source of risks of a different kind
and a greater order in the area of consumer protection, particularly in relation to
young persons and those with a propensity for gambling or likely to develop such a
propensity, in comparison with traditional markets for such games. Apart from the
lack of direct contact between the consumer and the operator...the particular ease
and the permanence of access to games offered over the internet and the potentially
high volume and frequency of such an international offer, in an environment which is
moreover characterised by isolation of the player, anonymity and an absence of social
control, constitute so many factors likely to foster the development of gambling
addiction and the related squandering of money, and thus likely to increase the
negative social and moral consequences attaching thereto, as underlined by
consistent case-law."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35272859/ 48
Galactus Funware Technology Private ... vs State Of Karnatka on 14 February, 2022
What we cannot miss from the above is the nature of game focused in this judgment of a foreign
Court. A careful perusal of the same unmistakably reveals that the Court was dealing with games of
chance and its ill-
European Court decision in C-46/08, 08-09-2010
- 89 -
effects, and not with the games of skill which happen to be the jugular vein of these Writ Petitions.
(b) As internet gaming/online gaming in the form of business continues to evolve exponentially,
participation increases, particularly among young people who are comparatively more familiar with
the new technology. It is likely that the problems associated with such games may surface in due
course. Regulation of online gaming based upon study & research will have to evolve to further the
understanding of the impact of this mode of access based on the experience and incidence of
behavioural addictions & disorders. This should be a data driven exercise to be undertaken on
empirical evidence. Theoretical models for betting & gaming and problem gambling have been
developed on the basis of traditional gaming, largely not considering the recent emergence of
internet modes. It is important to revisit these conceptual models to verify if they account for
pathological gambling among internet users and whether any new variables or interactions should
be included to
- 90 -
explain the emergence of problems associated with online gaming. This is necessary to structure a
more comprehensive & scientific understanding of how people develop gambling problems.
(c) It is relevant to state that before going for a statutory embargo on online gaming, the State had
not constituted any Expert Committee to undertake a scientific study & empirical research as to the
arguable ill effects of online games specific to socio-economic & cultural conditions in the State. We
hasten to add that for the exercise of plenary power of legislation, our Constitution does not
prescribe any such study or research as a sine qua non. However, when the policy content of a
statute is sought to be defended on the ground of its intrinsic merits and technological
advancement, it is but ideal for the State to place on record the necessary material for substantiating
its stand. This view is consistent with CHINTAMAN RAO, supra. When the legislative competence
and the reasonableness of the law are in challenge, the
- 91 -
contention of the State that even Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative House supported the
measure is not significant.
(d) In K.S PUTTASWAMY, supra while considering data and informational privacy, what the Apex
Court observed:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35272859/ 49
Galactus Funware Technology Private ... vs State Of Karnatka on 14 February, 2022
"Technology questions the assumptions which underlie our process of reasoning. It
reshapes the dialogue between citizens and the State. Above all, it tests the limits of
the doctrines which democracies have evolved as a shield which preserved the
sanctity of the individual...India has participated in and benefited from the
reconfiguring of technology by the global community. We live in an age of
information and are witness to a technology revolution that pervades almost every
aspect of our lives. Redundancies and obsolescence are as ubiquitous as technology
itself. Technology is a great enabler. Technology can be harnessed by the State in
furthering access to justice and fostering good governance... The hallmark of freedom
is autonomy & control over one's life and image as portrayed to the world. Privacy
safeguards individual's autonomy and recognises the ability of the individual to
control vital aspects of his life. Every individual is clothed with dignity & liberty so
that he is free to do what he will consistent with the freedom of others and to develop
his faculties to the fullest measure to live in happiness & peace. "
- 92 -
Science & technology are indisputably intertwined with the social and private lives of the citizenry
world over. Online gaming too is a product of technological advancement. Online games as
contra-distinguished from gambling are also a form of expression and partake the character of
business. It may be also a pursuit of happiness that falls within the contours of liberty & privacy of
an individual. As already stated above, placing an absolute embargo on this may take away any
positive development and benefit that the State may be able to achieve by otherwise balancing the
competing interests of the society and the individual. It may be said that while the State has a vested
and legitimate interest in the protection of its citizenry, the individual too has a vested right to
partake in the recreation of gaming in exhibition of individual skills albeit responsibly. Therefore, a
regulation in this regard ought to include technological solutions in the field, in order to better
enable a safe and responsible gaming behavior & environment. The integration of data science &
governance, corporate social responsibility and
- 93 -
individualized responsible gaming programs and/or other regulations may allow legal development
to keep pace with technological advancement.
XIX. AS TO ARTICLE 19 (1) (g) AND ENTRY 26 (TRADE AND COMMERCE) IN STATE LIST:
(a) The Apex Court while considering CHAMARBAUGWALA-II, supra opined that
"...we find it difficult to accept the contention that those activities which encourage a
spirit of reckless propensity for making easy gain by lot or chance, which lead to the
loss of the hard earned money of the undiscerning and improvident common man
and thereby lower his standard of living and drive him into a chronic state of
indebtedness and eventually disrupt the peace and happiness of his humble home
could possibly have been intended by our Constitution makers to be raised to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35272859/ 50
Galactus Funware Technology Private ... vs State Of Karnatka on 14 February, 2022
status of trade, commerce or intercourse and to be made the subject matter of a
fundamental right guaranteed by the Article 19(1)(g) ." It also reproduced the
observation of the US
- 94 -
Supreme Court in UNITED STATES vs. KAHRIGER52 and LEWIS vs. UNITED STATES53: "...there
is no constitutional right to gambling..." In view of the settled position of law, it hardly needs to be
stated that gambling, i.e., the 'games of chance' do not enjoy any Constitutional protection since they
are mala in se. It is open to the legislature to absolutely prohibit them as is done to the trades in
noxious or dangerous goods or trafficking in women. However, games of skill by their very nature
stand on a different footing.
(b) Learned Advocate General appearing for the State contends that: the games of chance being res
extra commercium, the games of skill fall within the field of 'Trade & commerce' under Entry 26 of
State List. The fundamental right inter alia of trade & business is guaranteed under Article 19(1) (g)
and therefore, the same is subject to reasonable restrictions imposed under Article 19(6). A
reasonable restriction may also include an absolute embargo. Regard being had to enormous (1953)
345 US 22 (1955) 348 US 419
- 95 -
adverse implications of online gaming on the society in general and the younger generation in
particular, the Amendment Act is made criminalizing the cyber games. In support of his contention,
he banks upon CHAMARBAUGWALAS, K.R.LAKSHMANAN & M.J. SIVANI, supra. He draws
attention of the Court to a spate of suicides in the State, a plethora of criminal cases registered by
the police and to the debates in the Legislative Assembly that culminated into the Amendment Act.
He contends that the policy of proscribing cyber games is a matter left to the legislative wisdom and
the writ Court should loathe to interfere.
(c) Learned advocates appearing for the petitioners do not much dispute that the State has power to
regulate the business activities, as provided under Article 19(6). They contend that in view of
CHINTAMAN RAO & MOHD. FAROOQ supra, the onus lies on the State to demonstrate the
reasonableness of restrictions and that where the restriction amounts to absolute embargo, this
onus is onerous vide NARENDRA KUMAR
- 96 -
vs. UNION OF INDIA54. They draw attention of the Court to the observations of Madras High Court
in JUNGLEE GAMES, supra, to the effect that the State has not adopted the 'least intrusive
approach test' and therefore, the Amendment Act should be voided. They also invoke the doctrine of
proportionality for the invalidation of impugned legislative measure.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35272859/ 51
Galactus Funware Technology Private ... vs State Of Karnatka on 14 February, 2022
(d) The online gaming activities played with stake or not do not fall within the ambit of Entry 34 of
the State List i.e., 'Betting and gambling', if they predominantly involve skill, judgment or
knowledge. They partake the character of business activities and therefore, they have protection
under Article 19(1(g). Apparently, the games of skill played online or offline with or without stakes,
are susceptible to reasonable restrictions under Article 19(6). The Amendment Act brings in a
blanket prohibition with regard to playing games of skill. The version & counter version as to the
nature & reasonableness of the restrictions need to be (1960) 2 SCR 375
- 97 -
examined in the light of norms laid down by the Apex Court. In a challenge laid to the validity of any
legislation on the ground of violation of Fundamental Rights inter alia guaranteed under Article
19(1), on a prima facie case of such violation being made out, the onus would shift to the State to
demonstrate that the legislation in question comes within the permissible limits of the most relevant
out of clauses (2) to (6). When exercise of Fundamental Right is absolutely prohibited, the burden of
proving that such a total prohibition on the exercise of right alone would ensure the maintenance of
general public interest, lies heavily upon the State. While adjudging a case of infringement of
fundamental rights, what is determinative is not the intent of the legislature but the effect of the
legislation. Legislative action that is too disproportionate or excessive, may suffer invalidation on
the ground of 'manifest arbitrariness' under Article 14 as discussed infra. Judge Aharon Barak of
Supreme Court of Israel in his book 'PROPORTIONALITY: CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AND
THEIR LIMITATIONS', succinctly puts the doctrine of
- 98 -
proportionality: "It requires that a rights-limiting measure should be pursuing a proper purpose,
through means that are suitable and necessary for achieving that purpose and that there is a proper
balance between the importance of achieving that purpose and the harm caused by limiting the
right".
(e) In examining reasonableness of restrictions, both substantive & procedural aspects enter the
fray. That is to say, the Court should consider not only factors such as the duration & extent of the
restrictions but also the circumstances and the manner in which their imposition has been
authorized. This apart, nature of the business sought to be restricted is also relevant vide
COOVERJEE B. BHARUCHA vs. EXCISE COMMISSIONER55. This needs to be done on statute to
statute basis since there cannot be a universal pattern of reasonableness. What the Apex Court said
in CHINTAMAN RAO, supra is worth adverting to:
"The phrase 'reasonable restriction' connotes that the limitation imposed on a person
in enjoyment of the right should not be AIR 1954 SC 220
- 99 -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35272859/ 52
Galactus Funware Technology Private ... vs State Of Karnatka on 14 February, 2022
arbitrary or of an excessive nature, beyond what is required in the interests of the
public. The word 'reasonable' implies intelligent care and deliberation, that is, the
choice of a course which reason dictates. Legislation which arbitrarily or excessively
invades the right cannot be said to contain the quality of reasonableness and unless it
strikes a proper balance between the freedom guaranteed in Article 19(1)(g) and the
social control permitted by clause(6) of Article 19, it must be held to be wanting in
that quality".
(f) In a recent decision i.e., INTERNET & MOBILE ASSN. OF INDIA vs. RESERVE BANK OF
INDIA56, while striking down a complete prohibition of crypto currency by the Reserve Bank of
India, the Apex Court observed:
"The parameters laid down in Md. Faruk are unimpeachable. While testing the
validity of a law imposing a restriction on the carrying on of a business or a
profession, the Court must, as formulated in Md. Faruk, attempt an evaluation of (i)
its direct and immediate impact upon of the fundamental rights of the citizens
affected thereby (ii) the larger public interest sought to be ensured in the light of the
object sought to be achieved (iii) the necessity to restrict the citizens' freedom (iv) the
inherent pernicious nature of the act prohibited or its capacity or tendency to be
harmful to the general public and (v) the possibility of achieving the same object by
imposing a less (2020) 10 SCC 274
- 100 -
drastic restraint...But nevertheless, the measure taken by RBI should pass the test of
proportionality, since the impugned Circular has almost wiped the VC exchanges out of the
industrial map of the country, thereby infringing Article 19(1)(g). On the question of proportionality,
the learned Counsel for the petitioners relies upon the four-pronged test summed up in the opinion
of the majority in Modern Dental College and Research Centre v. State of Madhya Pradesh.109
These four tests are (i) that the measure is designated for a proper purpose (ii) that the measures are
rationally connected to the fulfillment of the purpose (iii) that there are no alternative less invasive
measures and (iv) that there is a proper relation between the importance of achieving the aim and
the importance of limiting the right. The Court in the said case held that a mere ritualistic
incantation of "money laundering" or "black money" does not satisfy the first test and that
alternative methods should have been explored...We cannot and need not go as far as the majority
had gone in Bank Mellat. U.K. has a statute where standards of procedure for judicial review are set
out and the majority decision was on the application of those standards. But even by our own
standards, we are obliged to see if there were less intrusive measures available and whether RBI has
at least considered these alternatives..." We also shall be benefited by looking to what the Apex
Court said in SHAYARA BANO supra:
"It will be noticed that a Constitution Bench of this Court in Indian Express
Newspapers v. Union of India, (1985) 1 SCC 641, stated that it was settled law that
subordinate legislation can
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35272859/ 53
Galactus Funware Technology Private ... vs State Of Karnatka on 14 February, 2022
- 101 -
be challenged on any of the grounds available for challenge against plenary
legislation. This being the case, there is no rational distinction between the two types
of legislation when it comes to this ground of challenge under Article
14...The test of manifest arbitrariness, therefore, as laid down in the aforesaid
judgments would apply to invalidate legislation as well as subordinate legislation
under Article
14. Manifest arbitrariness, therefore, must be something done by the legislature
capriciously, irrationally and/or without adequate determining principle. Also, when
something is done which is excessive and disproportionate, such legislation would be
manifestly arbitrary. We are, therefore, of the view that arbitrariness in the sense of
manifest arbitrariness as pointed out by us above would apply to negate legislation as
well under Article 14."
(g) The Amendment Act puts games of skill and games of chance on par, when they are poles
asunder, in the light of obtaining jurisprudence. The games of skill, in addition to being a type of
expression, are entitled to protection under Article 19(1)(g) by virtue of their recognition as
business. There are competing interests of State and the individual, which need to be balanced by
employing known principles such as doctrine of proportionality, least restrictive test & the like. A
line has to be drawn to mark the boundary between the appropriate field of individual liberty and
the State action
- 102 -
for the larger good ensuring the least sacrifice from the competing claimants. As already mentioned
above, the Amendment Act puts an absolute embargo on the games of skill involving money or
stakes. Learned Advocate General contended that the State was not in a position to apply the 'least
restrictive test' and that the prohibition being the objective of the Amendment Act, there is no scope
for invoking the said test at all. This amounts to throwing the baby with bath water.
(h) In a progressive society like ours, imposing an absolute embargo, by any yardstick appears to be
too excessive a restriction. In such cases, a heavy burden rests on the State to justify such an
extreme measure, as rightly contended by the petitioners. There is no material placed on record to
demonstrate that State whilst enacting such an extreme measure, has considered the feasibility of
regulating wagering on games of skill. If the objective is to curb the menace of gambling, the State
should prohibit activities which amount to gambling as such and not the games of skill
- 103 -
which are distinct, in terms of content and produce. The State action suffers from the vice of
paternalism since there is excessive restriction on the citizens freedom of contract. However, the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35272859/ 54
Galactus Funware Technology Private ... vs State Of Karnatka on 14 February, 2022
ground of legislative populism does not avail against the plenary power of legislation. It has long
been settled that the motive of the legislature in passing a legislation is beyond the scrutiny of courts
vide a Five Judge Bench decision of the Apex Court T VENKATA REDDY vs. STATE OF ANDHRA
PRADESH57.
(i) A mere likelihood or propensity of misuse of online gaming platforms, without anything more,
does not constitute a legal justification for the banning of commercial activities. Article 300A has
been expansively construed to include intangible property like intellectual property which is a
product of original thought and skill, i.e., creation of the mind, and essentially used in commerce
vide K.T.PLANTATIONS vs. STATE OF KARNATAKA58. An activity predominantly involving skill
AIR 1985 SC 724 (2011) 9 SCC 1
- 104 -
cannot be readily banned at a stroke of legislative pen. In any organized society, knowledge, wisdom,
talent & skill are the invaluable tools for wealth generation. They are the unseeming ingredients of
economic rights such as rights to profession, property, etc. Our Constitution modelled on the
principle of 'limited government' normally frowns upon the measures which stultify & negate these
invaluables, whether acquired by Man or gifted by his Maker. On the contrary and ideally speaking,
State in the larger public interest has to create an atmosphere which nurses them. Story of
civilizations is replete with instances of bonsaing of economies in communities that failed to do this.
An absolute embargo on the business activities runs the risk of invalidation, unless the State
produces relevant material for the ouster of 'least restrictive test'. This test is normally employed as
a 'Litmus Test' in judicial review of State action in all civilized jurisdictions .
(j) The Apex Court in INDIAN EXPRESS supra extended protection to the Press with the following
reasoning:
- 105 -
"...Newspaper industry enjoys two of the fundamental rights, namely the freedom of
speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19 (l) (a) and the freedom to engage
in any profession, occupation, trade, industry or business guaranteed under Article
19 (1) (g) of the Constitution, the first because it is concerned with the field of
expression and communication and the second because communication has become
an occupation or profession and because there is on invasion of trade, business and
industry into that field where freedom of expression is being exercised..."
The games of skill as we have reasoned out above involve elements of expression and therefore enjoy
regulatable protection under Article 19(1)(a); it has long been settled that these games apparently
having business characteristics are protected under Article 19(1)(g). Therefore the above
observations in Indian Express equally apply to the case of petitioners. However, the Amendment
Act does not critically adjust the boundaries of existing category of protected activities i.e., games of
skill with the unprotected acts of gambling. Instead, State has created a wholly new category of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35272859/ 55
Galactus Funware Technology Private ... vs State Of Karnatka on 14 February, 2022
medium- based-regulation when change of medium per se does not alter the true nature & content
of the games. The
- 106 -
permissible limits of restriction recognized by Chamarbaugwalas are thus trampled, by proscribing
the online games by lock, stock & barrel. To scuttle the ship is not to save the cargo: to jettison may
be.
(k) The Tamil Nadu Gaming and Police Laws (Amendment) Act 2021 that was put in challenge
before the Madras High Court and the Amendment Act impugned herein are substantially similar in
their text, context, object & effect. They have been structured with the same jurisprudential
concepts. What the Hon'ble Madras High Court in JUNGLEE GAMES supra observed being equally
applicable to the Amendment Act here is profitably reproduced:
"The amended statute prohibited all forms of games being conducted in cyberspace,
irrespective of the game involved being a game of mere skill, if such game is played
for a wager, bet, money or other stake. Also, the main features of the Amending Act
was to enlarge the inclusive definition of the word 'gaming' where the Section 3-A
was introduced in the Act to prohibit wagering or betting in cyberspace and, the
replacement of the substance of Section 11 of the Act that originally exempted games
of "mere skill" from the application of the statute and its substitution by
- 107 -
including games of mere skill also within the fold of offences under the statute, if
such games are played for wager, bet, money or other stake."
XX. AS TO WHETHER CHAMARBAUGWALA JURISPRUDENCE HAS LOST RELEVANCE DUE
TO ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY:
(a) Learned Advocate General appearing for the State in his imitable style and
vociferously contended that: the provisions of an organic Constitution like ours have
to be construed keeping in view contemporary socio-economic developments and the
new challenges associated with the same. There has been a paradigm shift in the
whole lot of activities in the society owing to advancement of science & technology.
New implications and difficulties are cropping up in the society justifying innovative
ventures on the part of the State to effectively manage them. A greater leverage needs
to be conceded to the State in devising appropriate measures for curbing the menace
of online gaming. He passionately submitted that what was true of things that
happened in the bygone decades i.e., when CHAMARBAUGWALAS were decided,
need to be examined afresh. In support of this,
- 108 -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35272859/ 56
Galactus Funware Technology Private ... vs State Of Karnatka on 14 February, 2022
he cites the decision in SIVANI supra contending that the absolute embargo on videogames has
been upheld by the Apex Court, despite CHAMARBAUGWALAS. He also refers to a Public Interest
Litigation in W.P.No.13714/2020 between SHARADA D.R. vs. STATE OF KARNATAKA59 in which
a direction was sought for banning of all forms of online gambling and betting disposed off on
26.10.2021 by this Court, and that the Amendment Act has been enacted keeping in view the same.
(b) We do appreciate the above submissions of the learned Advocate General. However, that does
not much come to the rescue of respondents. True it is:
Constitution is intended to enure for ages to come and consequently, to be adapted to
the various crises of human affairs. It is unwise to insist that what the provisions of
the constitution meant to the vision of its makers must mean to the vision of our
time. They should be interpreted to meet and cover changing conditions of In
W.P.No.13714/2020 disposed off on 26.10.2021
- 109 -
social and economic life. A Constitution states not rules for the passing hour but the
principles for an expanding future. At the same time, the meaning of the Constitution
does not change with every ebb and flow of economic events. A constitution is not a
storehouse of fossilized principles. It is a living law of the people and accordingly its
provisions need to be construed by all the organs of the State.
(c) However, the submission of learned Advocate General overlooks one important
factor:
CHARMARBAUGWALAS were decided decades ago is true, but that jurisprudence
has been validated time and again by the Apex Court in K.R.LAKSHMANAN (1996)
and other subsequent cases. Thus it is not that what was decided in
CHARMARBAUGWALAS is being re- visited for the first time now. In the recent
past, several High Courts in the country have followed the same after critical
examination viz., VARUN GUMBER (P&H-2017), GURDEEP SINGH
(BOMBAY-2019), RAVINDRA SINGH (RAJASTAN-2020), JUNGLEE GAMES
(MADRAS-2021), HEAD DIGITAL WORKS (KERALA-2021), supra. Some of
- 110 -
these cases went to Apex Court and came to be affirmed, the latest being AVINASH
MEHROTRA, supra decided on 30.7.2021. All this is already discussed at paragraphs
(IX) & (X) above. We need not refer to SIVANI again since it is already discussed in
detail infra. The PIL case does not in any way come to the rescue of the respondents
since the prayer therein is related to banning of all online gambling as such.
Apparently, case of the petitioners is not one of gambling; their business does not
involve any act which is determined by the wheel of fortune.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35272859/ 57
Galactus Funware Technology Private ... vs State Of Karnatka on 14 February, 2022
XXI. AS TO DISCRIMINATION AND VIOLATION OF EQUALITY UNDER ARTICLE 14:
(a) Learned Advocates appearing for the petitioners are justified in complaining that
the Amendment Act is violative of Article 14 of the Constitution inasmuch as it does
not recognize the long standing jurisprudential difference between a 'game of skill'
and a 'game of chance' which animates the scheme of the Principal Act, even
post-amendment. Consequently, in the eye of Amendment Act, the persons who play
games of chance
- 111 -
and the persons who play the games of skill (in terms of predominance test) unjustifiably made to
constitute one homogenous class. Our Constitution does not permit things which are different in
fact or opinion to be treated in law as though they were the same. The doctrine of equality enshrined
in Article 14 is violated not only when equals are treated unequally but also when un-equals are
treated equally disregarding their difference vide E.P.ROYAPPA vs. STATE OF TAMIL NADU60
wherein the Apex Court observed:
"... The basic principle which therefore informs both Articles 14 and 16 is equality and
inhibition against discrimination. Now, what is the content and reach of this great
equalising principle? It is a founding faith, to use the words of Bose J., "a way of fife",
and it must not be subjected to a narrow pedantic or lexicographic approach. We
cannot countenance any attempt to truncate its all-embracing scope and meaning, for
to do so would be to violate its activist magnitude. Equality is a dynamic concept with
many aspects and dimensions and it cannot be "cribbed cabined and confined"
within traditional and doctrinaire limits. From a positivistic point of view, equality is antithetic to
arbitrariness. In fact equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies; one belongs to the rule of law in
a republic while the other, to the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch. Where an AIR 1974 SC
555
- 112 -
act is arbitrary it is implicit in it that it is unequal both according to political logic and constitutional
law and is therefore violative of Art. 14, and if it affects any matter relating to public employment, it
is also violative of Article
16. Articles 14 and 16 strike at arbitrariness in State action an (ensure fairness and equality of
treatment. They require that State action must be based on valent relevant principles applicable
alike to all similarly situate and it must not be guided by any extraneous or irrelevant considerations
because that would be denial of equality..."
(b) The amended definition of 'gaming' excludes in so many words, 'a lottery or wagering or betting
on horse- race run on any race course' in a given circumstance. The Apex Court in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35272859/ 58
Galactus Funware Technology Private ... vs State Of Karnatka on 14 February, 2022
K.R.LAKSHMANAN supra held that, horse- racing is a 'game of mere skill' and therefore, it is
'neither gaming nor gambling'. If the legislative policy is to protect the games of skill from being
treated as proscribed, the Amendment Act being unjustifiably selective in that suffers from a grave
constitutional infirmity. It offends the clause of 'equal protection of the laws' enacted in Article 14,
since protection is unreasonably sectarian. The equal protection clause would be diluted into a mild
constitutional injunction that the State shall treat as
- 113 -
equal in law only the horse-racers who are equal in fact with other players of games of skill. For
saving such a blatant discrimination, the respondents have failed to establish the reasonable basis
on which such a classification is founded and the rational nexus identifiable between the differentia
of and the object sought to be achieved by such a classification vide STATE OF WEST BENGAL vs.
ANWAR ALI SARKAR61.
(c) Learned Advocate General pressed into service the decision in SHREYA SINGHAL, supra to
justify classification between 'actual games' and 'virtual games' and that the Amendment Act that
would focus the latter would not suffer any infirmity on the touchstone of equality clause. He
contends that there is an intelligible differentia between online media and offline media as
recognized by the Apex Court and therefore, the legislature in its wisdom has chosen to proscribe
the online games since they are injurious to public interest. True it is that, the Apex Court treated
online media being AIR 1952 SC 75
- 114 -
different from offline. However, such a differential treatment was in the context of distinction that
lies between dissemination of information via traditional media and dissemination of information
via online media. Whilst there are multiple layers of prior editorial control in case of publication
through traditional media, such layers may not exist in the case of publication of information
through online media, as information in the case of latter "travels like lightning". It hardly needs to
be stated that the cases at hand are not one of unregulated information travelling at the speed of
lightening. We are at loss to know how the observations made in the decision would advance the
case of respondents, when its contextual substratum is miles away from that of these petitions. The
ratio in this decision being relevant albeit for different reasons is discussed below. XXII. AS TO
MANIFEST ARBITRARINESS AND VOIDING OF PLENARY LEGISLATIONS:
(a) The expression "pure game of skill" as employed in legislations of the kind i.e.,
Section 176 of the Principal Act has been judicially construed to be
- 115 -
"mere skill" and that the games mainly & preponderantly involving skill, fall into this
class. The expanded meaning of 'gaming' under Section 2(7) as amended, broods
through the entirety of the Amendment Act, which paints 'games of skill' and 'games
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35272859/ 59
Galactus Funware Technology Private ... vs State Of Karnatka on 14 February, 2022
of chance' with the same brush. However, Section 176 of the Principal Act even post
amendment continues to maintain the distinction between these two classes of
games. The original heading of this section 'Saving of games of skill'' now also
continues. In English Parliamentary practice, 'headings and marginal notes are not
voted or passed by Parliament, but are inserted after the Bill has become law' states
Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, 12th Edn. Butterworths at page 11. Of course,
since 2011, there is change in practice. In India, even headings are part of the Bill and
are voted in the legislature. They provide the context for the substantive part of the
section. They are there for guidance. Therefore, they cannot be ignored. Due
significance has to be attached to the heading of a section in a statute. The
substantive text of Section 176 makes the penal provisions enacted in Sections 79 &
80
- 116 -
inapplicable to 'any pure game of skill' i.e., a game predominantly involving skill.
However, the Amendment Act deletes the term "and to wagering by person taking
part in such games of skill" from the text of this section. Thus the amended definition
of 'gaming' under Section 2(7) to the extent it does not admit the difference between
skill games and chance games, is in direct contradiction to the amended Section 176
which intends to maintain such a difference. The very definition of 'gaming' as
amended, suffers from the vice of over- inclusiveness/over-broadness of the idea of
gaming as enacted in the charging provisions of the Act that are animated by
CHAMARBAUGWALA Jurisprudence. The content of 'gaming' as capsuled under
Section 2(7) thus bruises the legislative intent enacted in Section 176 ab inceptio and
continued post-amendment, for protecting a class of citizens who plays the games of
skill and therefore, fits into the text & context of this provision.
- 117 -
(b) In SHAYARA BANO vs. UNION OF INDIA62, the Hon'ble Supreme Court broke a
new ground i.e., 'manifest arbitrariness' for the invalidation of plenary legislations, as
well. Following observation therein is profitably reproduced:
"101. It will be noticed that a Constitution Bench of this Court in Indian Express
Newspapers v. Union of India, (1985) 1 SCC 641, stated that it was settled law that
subordinate legislation can be challenged on any of the grounds available for
challenge against plenary legislation. This being the case, there is no rational
distinction between the two types of legislation when it comes to this ground of
challenge under Article 14.The test of manifest arbitrariness, therefore, as laid down
in the aforesaid judgments would apply to invalidate legislation as well as
subordinate legislation under Article
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35272859/ 60
Galactus Funware Technology Private ... vs State Of Karnatka on 14 February, 2022
14. Manifest arbitrariness, therefore, must be something done by the legislature
capriciously, irrationally and/or without adequate determining principle. Also, when
something is done which is excessive and disproportionate, such legislation would be
manifestly arbitrary. We are, therefore, of the view that arbitrariness in the sense of
manifest arbitrariness as pointed out by us above would apply to negate legislation as
well under Article 14".
In the considered view of this Court, the impugned legislative action that has clamped an absolute
embargo (2017) 9 SCC 1
- 118 -
on all games of skill defies the principle of proportionality and is far excessive in nature and
therefore violates Article 14 of the Constitution on the ground of 'manifest arbitrariness'
(c) The rule of law is recognized by the Apex Court as a 'basic feature' of our Constitution vide
KESAVANANDA63. It is one of the imperatives of rule of law that, laws which regulate the
act/conduct of persons or entities must give a fair notion of such act/conduct that is forbidden or
required of them. A statute which "...leaves open, the widest conceivable inquiry, the scope of which
no one can foresee and the result of which no one can foreshadow or adequately guard against...'
offends this postulate of rule of law and therefore, is liable to be voided on the ground of 'manifest
arbitrariness'. When a Statute is obscure or admits plural meanings with little for a common citizen
to choose between them, there is absolute intractability of the language used. They operate as

to the sensible citizens since they do not allow them to live securely under the rule of law. The
Amendment Act suffers from the infirmity of this kind inasmuch as Section 2(7) which encompasses
all games regardless of skill involved, renders the charging provisions enacted in section 176 read
with Sections 79 & 80 of the Principal Act so vague that the men of common intelligence will not be
in a position to guess at its true meaning and differ as to scope of its application and therefore, is
liable to be voided.
(d) The above view of ours gains support from the following observations of the Hon'ble Madras
High Court in JUNGLEE GAMES, supra:
"120. It is true that, broadly speaking, games and sporting activities in the physical
form cannot be equated with games conducted on the virtual mode or in cyberspace.
However, when it comes to card games or board games such as chess or scrabble,
there is no distinction between the skill involved in the physical form of the activity or
in the virtual form. It is true that Arnold Palmer or Severiano Ballesteros may never
have mastered how golf is played on the computer or Messi or Ronaldo may be
outplayed by a team of infants in a virtual game of football, but Viswanathan Anand

Sharif would not be so disadvantaged when playing their chosen games of skill on the
virtual mode. Such distinction is completely lost in the Amending Act as the original
scheme in the Act of 1930 of confining gaming to games of chance has been turned
upside down and all games outlawed if played for a stake or for any prize."
XXIII. AS TO INCHOATE CAUSE OF ACTION: RIGHTS UNDER ARTICLE 19(1)(a)
& (g) NOT AVAILING TO JURISTIC PERSONS:
(a) The vehement contention of learned Advocate General that whether a game
predominantly involves skill or not, is a question of fact and therefore, without there
being a criminal case in this regard, the challenge to the legislation is premature,
cannot be agreed to. In our Constitutional Jurisprudence, for laying a challenge to
legislation, registration of a crime thereunder is not a sine qua non. Even otherwise,
such criminal cases have already been registered by the police and that a Co-
ordinate Bench of this Court in W.P. No.19287/2021 between BHAVIT SHETH vs. STATE OF
KARNATAKA has granted stay of all further proceedings. This apart, Court non-suiting the
petitioners on this ground as urged by the respondents is tantamount to a physician turning away a
potential patient stating that the
- 121 -
gangrene is yet to develop, when, pathological conditions galore. Anticipatory relief against the
legislative action is not unfamiliar to constitutional adjudication. An argument to the contrary could
risk the liberty of citizens.
(b) The contention of the learned Advocate General that the Fundamental Rights under Article 19 do
not avail to the non-citizens and therefore, petitions are misconceived, cannot be countenanced
inasmuch as there are several citizens before this Court who have laid a challenge to the legislations.
Secondly, the Apex Court in DELHI CLOTH AND GENERAL MILLS vs. UNION OF INDIA64 supra
has disagreed with contention of the kind by the following observations:
"Thus apart from the law being in a nebulous state, the trend is in the direction of
holding that in the matter of fundamental freedoms guaranteed by Article 19, the
rights of a shareholder and the company which the shareholders have formed are
rather coextensive and the denial to one of the fundamental freedom would be denial
to the other. It is time to put an end to this controversy but in the present state of law
we are of the opinion that the petitions should not AIR 1983 SC 937

be thrown out at the threshold. We reach this conclusion for the additional reasons
that apart from the complaint of denial of fundamental right to carry on trade or
business, numerous other contentions have been raised which the High Court had to
examine in a petition under Article 226. And there is a grievance of denial of '
equality before law as guaranteed by Article 14. We accordingly over-rule the
preliminary objection and proceed to examine the contentions on merits."
In the above circumstances, these writ petitions succeed:
1. The provisions of Sections 2, 3, 6, 8 & 9 of the Karnataka Police (Amendment) Act
2021 i.e., Karnataka Act No.28 of 2021 are declared to be ultra vires the Constitution
of India in their entirety and accordingly are struck down.
2. The consequences of striking down of the subject provisions of the Karnataka
Police (Amendment) Act 2021 i.e., Karnataka Act No.28 of 2021 shall follow.
However, nothing in this judgment shall be construed to prevent an appropriate legislation being
brought about
- 123 -
concerning the subject i.e., 'Betting & gambling' in accordance with provisions of the Constitution.
3. A Writ of Mandamus is issued restraining the respondents from interfering with the online
gaming business and allied activities of the petitioners.
No order as to costs.
