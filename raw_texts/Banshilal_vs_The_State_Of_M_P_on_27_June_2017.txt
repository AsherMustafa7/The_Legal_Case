Banshilal vs The State Of M.P. on 27 June, 2017
15. Banshilal(PW7) is a hostile witness. Similarly Ramabai(PW11), one of the
eye-witness of the case has also not supported the case of the prosecution.
16. As per statement of of injured Gopilal(PW5), Kanchanbai(PW6), Kamlibai(PW8),
Sorambai(PW9) and Dhanibai(PW12) on the date of alleged incident, accused No.1 -
Banshilal S/o Bhuraji, Saurambai, Gulabbai, Gangabai, Prembai, Bhulibai were
armed with lathi, Mangilal, Dhannalal, Gorilal, Gulabsingh, were armed with farsi,
accused Dhulji was armed with Ballam, accused Bapual S/o Navalsingh and accused
Banshilal S/o Dhulji and accused Champalal were armed with sword and inflicted
injuries to injured Gopilal(PW5) and Kanchanbai(PW6), Indersingh(deceased) and
Bapual(deceased) by means of the aforesaid weapons, as a result of which,
Indersingh and Bapulal sustained grievous injuries and on the way to hospital they
succumbed to their injuries.
17. Learned counsel for the appellant has drawn our attention to the statement of
injured Gopilal (PW5), Kanchanbai(PW6), Banshilal(PW7), injured -
Sorambai(PW9), Rajalbai(PW10), Ramabai(PW11) and Police statements of
Gopilal(Ex-D/1), Kanchanbai(Ex-D/2), Kamlibai(Ex-D/3), Sourabh((Ex-D/4),
Payalbai(Ex-D/5) and Dhanibai(Ex-D/6) and submitted that there are material
contradictions in their statement. They due to previous enmity in respect of of 3
Bigha land, which was going on between the parties from last 10 to 20 years, they
have been falsely implicated in the alleged offence. None of the eye-witnesses in their
statement has stated about causing any injury by accused Saurambai, Gulabbai,
Prembai, Bhulibai, though they were armed with lathi, but no overt act has been
attributed to them. On coming to the knowledge about the incident they came at the
place of occurrence and the learned trial Court has wrongly convicted them by
holding that they also inflicted injury to the deceased and were member of the
unlawful assembly and had actively participated in the alleged crime.
18. On the other hand, Shri Umesh Gajankush, learned Public prosecutor supported
the judgment of the learned trial Court and submitted that the evidence of the
eye-witnesses are of sterling quality.
As per statement of Gopilal(PW5), Kanchanbai(PW6), Sorambai(PW9), eye-witness Kamlibai(PW8)
and Dhanibai (PW12), the presence of the present appellants were not doubtful and prays for
dismissal of the appeal.
19. We have gone through the evidence of all the material prosecution witnesses Gopilal(PW5),
Kanchanbai(PW6), Sorambai(PW9), eye-witness Kamlibai(PW8) and Dhanibai (PW12). and
Ramabai(PW11) had witnessed the incident, but PW11 has not supported the prosecution case. As
per opinion given by Doctor(PW2), the injury, which was found on the vital part of the body of the
deceased was dangerous to life, therefore, in our opinion on the facts of the case the act committed
with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/84022300/ 5
Banshilal vs The State Of M.P. on 27 June, 2017
20. We ourselves have seen the judgment of the trial Court, which has been passed after proper
appreciation of the evidence of eye- witnesses as well as the evidence of doctors and the
Investigating Officer, therefore, in our opinion the finding recorded regarding causing injury by
hard,sharp and blunt object like sword, Ballam, lathi and farsi, the learned trial Court appears to be
correct.
21. From the evidence on record, particularly, the medical evidence, it is clear that the death of
Indersingh and Bapulal is homicidal in nature and considering the injuries which are caused to the
deceased the case will be that of culpable homicide. From the evidence on record, it is clear that all
the material prosecution witnesses have stated in their deposition that it was the accused persons
who had inflicted injuries to the deceased by means of farsi, ballam, lathi and sword and there is no
reason to disbelieve the evidence of the prosecution witnesses. As per the statement of
eye-witnesses, appellant no.5 - Saurambai, appellant no.6 - Gulabbai, appellant no.8
- Prembai and appellant no.9 - Bhulibai, on coming to the knowledge about the incident they came
at the place of occurrence. Since both the parties were aggressive, therefore, they started moving
their lathi, however, they do not know whether any injury is caused to anyone. None of the
eye-witnesses and injured in their statement has stated about causing any injury by appellants no.5 -
Saurambai, No.6 - Gulabbai and No.8 - Prembai in Criminal Appeal No.46/2005 and appellant No.1
- Bhulibai in Criminal Appeal No.30/2005 though they were armed with lathi, but no overt act has
been attributed to them nor they were member of the unlawful assembly and had actively
participated in the alleged crime. On the other hand, each of the material prosecution witnesses
have narrated the role of each of the accused namely Banshilal s/o Bhuraji, Mangilal, Dhannalal @
Dhaniram, Gorilal, Champalal, Dhulji, Gulabsingh, Banshilal S/o Dhulji and Bapulal S/o
Navalsingh. No doubt an admission is also made to prove that the accused acted in self-defence but
the prosecution has successfully proved the case against accused them. From the evidence of
prosecution witnesses, as these witnesses have received injuries and it is proved by medical
evidence, therefore, their evidence cannot be discarded. All the accused had come with deadly
weapons by forming an unlawful assembly. Even the FSL report supports the case of the
prosecution.
22. On due consideration of the material evidence available on record and also to the fact that at the
time of incident, appellants were inflicting injuries by means of sword, lathi, ballam and farsi, over
the deceased and complainant, it is not the case of the appellants that they have been falsely
implicated in the alleged offence or there is no evidence against them. Looking to the evidence on
record and the circumstances, as aforesaid, we are not inclined to disturb the finding of the trial
Court holding accused Bapulal S/o Naval Singh(in Cri.A. No.27/2005), accused Champalal, Dhulji
and Gulabsingh(in Cri.A. No.30/2005) and Banshilal S/o Bhuraji, Mangilal, Dhannalal @
Dhaniram, Gorilal, Bnashilal S/o Dhulji(in Cri.A. No.46/2005) guilty of offence punishable under
Sections, 147, 148, 323/149, 324/149, 325/149 and 302/149 of IPC and under Section 25(1-B) of the
Arms Act, 1959 and we confirm it.
23. So far as accused appellants Saurambai, Prembai, Gulabbai and Bhulibai are concerned, no overt
act has been attributed to them and none of the eye-witnesses in their statement has made
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/84022300/ 6
Banshilal vs The State Of M.P. on 27 June, 2017
allegation of causing injury by them.
24. We have also gone through the evidence on record and the impugned judgment. Since accused
no.7 Gangabai W/o Mangilal has expired, during pendency of this appeal, this appeal against her
has been abated. So far as other accused persons are concerned, from the evidence on record, it is
clear that at the most the injury caused by the accused to the deceased was caused by the hard and
blunt object and it is rightly believed that the accused were guilty of the alleged offence.
25. In view of this, we find that all the criminal appeals in respect of accused Bapualal(in Cri.A.
No.27/2005), accused Champalal, Dhulji and Gulabsingh(in Crio.A. No.30/2005) and accused
Banshilal S/o Bhuraji, Mangilal, Dhannalal @ Dhaniram, Gorilal, and Banshilal S/o Dhulji (in Cri.A.
No.46/2005) sans merit and deserves to be dismissed as their conviction has been proved and they
found guilty under Sections 323/149, 324/149, 325/149, 147, 148 and 302/149 of IPC and under
Section 25(1-B) of Arms Act.
26. In respect of accused Saurambai, Gulabbai, Prembai, and Bhulibai are concerned, none of the
eye-witnesses in their statement has made any allegation of causing injury to the deceased as well as
the injured nor any overt act has been attributed to them, their conviction for offence under Sections
323/149, 324/149, 325/149, 302/149, 147 and 148 of IPC are hereby set aside and they are acquitted
of the alleged offence. They are on bail. Their bail bond shall stand discharged.
27. For the foregoing reasons, the impugned judgments and orders dated 23/12/2004, passed by
learned Additional Sessions Judge, Rajgarh(Biaora) in S.T. No.140/2002 are hereby confirmed
against Bapulal(in Cri.A. No.27/2005), accused Champalal, Dhulji and Gulabsingh(in Cri.A.
No.30/2005) and accused Banshilal S/o Bhuraji, Mangilal, Dhannalal @ Dhaniram, Gorilal, and
Banshilal S/o Dhulji (in Cri.A. No.46/2005). Bail bonds, if any, of the accused stand cancelled. Since
The jail sentence of appellant - Bapulal S/o Naval Singh (in Cri.A. No.27/2005) was also suspended
by this Court on 29/07/2016 and he is on bail, he shall surrender before the jail authorities within a
period of twelve weeks from today to serve out the remaining period of sentence. Record and
proceedings, if lying here, be sent to the Court below forthwith.
