THESE WRIT PETITIONS COMING ON FOR ORDERS AND
HAVING BEEN RESERVED FOR ORDERS ON 16.02.2023, THIS DAY,
THE COURT PRONOUNCED THE FOLLOWING:
ORDER
1. The petitioner-employer in W.P.No.31261/2016 is before this Court seeking for the following
reliefs:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/8096970/ 3
Vijaya Kumar B vs The Management Of M/S Leotech on 10 April, 2023
"The Petitioner humbly prays that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to issue a writ
in the nature of certiorari and/or writ or order and quash the impugned Award dated
18.2.2016 at Annexure-H passed by the Hon'ble Principal Labour Court, Bengaluru in
Reference No.14/2012 and pass such other Order/s or directions as this Hon'ble
Court deems fit to pass in the circumstances of the case".
2. The petitioner-workman in W.P.No.57652/2017 is before this Court seeking for the following
reliefs:
"Wherefore, the petitioners respectfully prays that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased
to call for the entire records relating to Ref.No.14/2012., on the file the Principal
Labour Court, Bangalore and grant the petitioners of the following reliefs:
a. Issue a Writ of Certiorari or any other appropriate writ or order, quashing that
portion of the Award dtd. 18.02.2016 in Ref No.14/2012, a original copy of which is at
Annexure-A, only to the extent of the petitioners being aggrieved and modify that
portion of the award and grant full back wages, as though the petitioner is continued
in employment from the date of refusal of employment till the date of reinstatement.
b. Issue a writ of Mandamus or any other appropriate writ or order or direction, directing the
respondent management to pay full back wages, as though the petitioner is continued in
employment from the date of refusal of employment till the date of reinstatement.
c. Direct the contesting respondent management to pay the petitioners costs throughout, and d.
Grant such other relief or reliefs as this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to grant, in the facts and
circumstances of the case, to meet the ends of justice.
3. The petitioner is a small-scale industry and a partnership firm manufacturing moulded
components in Thermoset with about 40 workmen working in the Unit. The Union was affiliated to
Hind Mazdoor Sabha and known as 'General Workers Union'. Several settlements were signed with
the Union from time to time and the last settlement was executed on 1.6.2011 and prior to that on
7.7.2007.
4. The employer engaged a contractor M/s Madhu Enterprises, who in turn deployed 16 of its
employees to carry out work which is alleged to be unskilled in nature and not perennial.
5. On a demand being made by contractor for enhancement in salary, etc, of the contract workmen,
the same not being acceptable to the employer, the contract came to be terminated which resulted in
the Union raising an industrial dispute in respect of 5 workmen. Conciliation proceedings having
failed, the appropriate government referred the dispute to the Prl. Labour Court at Bangalore which
came to be registered as Ref. No.14/2012.
6. The points for reference are as under;

The labour
Court raised additional issues viz.,
a) Whether first party proves existence of employer and employee relationship between themselves.
b) Whether the second party is justified in the alleged action of refusing work to the said 5 workmen.
7. The labour court vide its award dated 18.02.2016 directed the employer to reinstate all the
workmen to their original post with continuity of service but denied back wages. It is aggrieved by
the same that the employer is before this Court in W.P. No.13261/2016 seeking for the aforesaid
reliefs. The workmen are also before this Court in 57562/2017 seeking for the aforesaid reliefs:
8. Sri.K.R.Anand, learned counsel for the employer submits that 8.1. The labour court mistook and
misunderstood the issues framed and consequently travelled beyond the reference made and as
such, the award passed, being beyond the reference, is required to be set- aside.
8.2. The labour Court was required to adjudicate on the existence of an employer-employee
relationship but has failed to do so. The labor Court has given a finding as regards the validity,
legality and justification of engagement of contract labour in the employer's establishment which
was not required for the purpose of adjudication. The workmen not having produced any document
to establish the existence of an employer-employee relationship between the employer and the
workmen, without a finding on the same, the labour Court has committed a serious lapse requiring
the award to be set aside.
8.3. The burden of proof was on the workmen to establish the employer-employee relationship,
insofar as the employer is concerned, the employer by the production of necessary document, has
categorically established that the workmen were the employees of a contractor and not employed by
the employer.
8.4. The Labour court ought not to have engaged itself with and given a finding as regards the
permanency or otherwise of the works to be carried out since the same was not referred to.
8.5. In this regard, he relies upon the following decisions:
8.6. Oshiar Prasad v. Sudamdih Coal Washery1, more particularly, para 23, 24, 25
and 26 thereof, which are reproduced hereunder for easy reference:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/8096970/ 5
Vijaya Kumar B vs The Management Of M/S Leotech on 10 April, 2023
23. Coming now to the facts of this case, it is an admitted case that the services of the
appellants and those at whose instance the reference was made were terminated long
back prior to making of the reference. These workers were, therefore, not in the
services of either the Contractor or/and BCCL on the date of making the reference in
question.
Therefore, there was no industrial dispute that "existed" or "apprehended" in relation to the
appellants' absorption in the services of BCCL on the date of making the reference.
24. Indeed a dispute regarding the appellants' absorption was capable of being referred to in
reference for adjudication, had the appellants been in the services of the Contractor or/and BCCL.
But as said above, since the appellants' services were discontinued or/and retrenched (whether
rightly or wrongly) long back, the question of their absorption or regularisation in the services of
BCCL, as claimed by them, did not arise and nor could this issue have been gone into on its merits
for the reason that it was not legally possible to give any direction to absorb/regularise the
appellants so long as they were not in the employment.
25. It is a settled principle of law that absorption and regularisation in service can be claimed or/and
granted only when the contract of employment (2015) 4 SCC 71
- 10 -
subsists and is in force inter se employee and the employer. Once it comes to an end either by efflux
of time or as per the terms of the contract of employment or by its termination by the employer,
then in such event, the relationship of employee and employer comes to an end and no longer
subsists except for the limited purpose to examine the legality and correctness of its termination.
26. In our considered opinion, the only industrial dispute, which existed for being referred to the
Industrial Tribunal for adjudication was in relation to termination of the appellants' employment
and whether it was legal or not? It is an admitted fact that it was not referred to the Tribunal and,
therefore, it attained finality against the appellants.
8.7. Relying on the above, he submits that labour contract having been terminated and the workman
not being in service, the labour Court could not have directed absorption and regularization of such
workmen.
8.8. Bharath Heavy Electricals Ltd., vs. Mahendra Prasad Jakhmola and ors2, more particularly,
para 19 thereof, which is reproduced hereunder for easy reference:
[2019-LLR- Page No.515]

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/8096970/ 6
Vijaya Kumar B vs The Management Of M/S Leotech on 10 April, 2023
19. The expression 'control and supervision' were further explained with reference to
an earlier judgment of this Court as follows:
"12. The expression "control and supervision" in the context of contract labour was
explained by this Court in International Airport Authority of India v. International
Air Cargo Workers' Union thus: (SCC p.388, paras 38-39) "38.... if the contract is for
supply of labour, necessarily, the labour supplied by the contractor will work under
the directions, supervision and control of the principal employer but that would not
make the worker a direct employee of the principal employer, if the salary is paid by a
contractor, if the right to regulate the employment is with the contractor, and the
ultimate supervision and control lies with the contractor.
8.9. Merely because the workmen supplied by a contractor were to supervised by the
employer, the same would not amount to control being vested with the employer
resulting in the workmen of the contractor becoming the workers of the employer.
8.10. Gujarat Electricity Board Thermal Power Station, Ukai, Gujarat vs.Hind
Mazdoor
- 12 -
Sabha and ors.3 more particularly, para 13, 15 and 18 thereof, which are reproduced
hereunder for easy reference:
13. It is not necessary for us to go into the question of the finality of the decision
under Section 10 of the Act since as held by this Court in Vegoils Pvt. Ltd., B.H.E.L.
Workers' Association, Catering Cleaners of Southern Railway, and Dena Nath
[supra], the exclusive authority to decide whether the contract labour should be
abolished or not is that of the appropriate Government under the said provision. It is
further not disputed before us that the decision of the Government is final subject, of
course, to the judicial review on the usual grounds. However, as stated earlier, the
exclusive jurisdiction of the appropriate Government under Section 10 of the Act
arises only where the labour contract is genuine and the question whether the
contract is genuine, or not can be examined and adjudicated upon by the court or the
industrial adjudicator, as the case may be. Hence in such cases, the workmen can
make a grievance that there is no genuine contract and that they are in fact the
employees of the principal employer.
15. The answer to the question as to what would be the status of the erstwhile
workmen of the contractor, once the contract labour system is abolished is therefore
that where an industrial dispute is raised, the status of the workmen will be as
determined by the industrial adjudicator. If the contract labour system is abolished
while the industrial adjudication is pending or is kept pending on the concerned
dispute, the adjudicator can give direction in that behalf in the pending dispute. If,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/8096970/ 7
Vijaya Kumar B vs The Management Of M/S Leotech on 10 April, 2023
[1995 LLR Page No.552],
- 13 -
however, no industrial dispute is pending for determination of the issue, nothing
prevents an industrial dispute being raised for the purpose.
18. Our conclusions and answers to the questions raised are, therefore, as follows :
[i] In view of the provisions of Section 10 of the Act, it is only the appropriate
Government which has the authority to abolish genuine labour contract in
accordance with the provisions of the said Section. No Court including the industrial
adjudicator has jurisdiction to do so.
[ii] if the contract is sham or not genuine, the workmen of the so called contractor
can raise an industrial dispute for declaring that they were always the employees of
the principal employer and for claiming the appropriate service conditions. When
such dispute is raised, it is not a dispute for abolition of the labour contract and
hence the provisions of Section 10 of the Act will not bar either the raising or the
adjudication of the dispute. When such dispute is raised, the industrial adjudicator
has to decide whether the contract is sham or genuine. It is only if the adjudicator
comes to the conclusion that the contract is sham, that he will have jurisdiction to
adjudicate the dispute. If, however, he comes to the conclusion that the contract is
genuine, he may refer the workmen to the appropriate Government for abolition of
the contract labour under Section 10 of the Act and keep the dispute pending.
However, he can do so if the dispute is espoused by the direct workmen of the
principal employer. If the workmen of the principal employer have not espoused the
dispute, the adjudicator, after coming to the conclusion that the contract is genuine,
has to reject the reference, the dispute being not an industrial dispute within the
meaning of Section 2 (k) of the ID Act. He will not be competent to give any relief to
the workmen of the erstwhile contractor even if the labour contract is abolished by
the appropriate Government under Section 10 of the Act.
- 14 -
[iii] If the labour contract is genuine a composite industrial dispute can still be raised
for abolition of the contract labour and their absorption. However, the dispute, will
have to be raised invariably by the direct employees of the principal employer. The
industrial adjudicator, after receipt of the reference of such dispute will have first to
direct the workmen to approach the appropriate Government for abolition of the
contract labour under Section 10 of the Act and keep the reference pending. If
pursuant to such reference, the contract labour is abolished by the appropriate
Government, the industrial adjudicator will have to give opportunity to the parties to
place the necessary material before him to decide whether the workmen of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/8096970/ 8
Vijaya Kumar B vs The Management Of M/S Leotech on 10 April, 2023
erstwhile contractor should be directed to be absorbed by the principal employer,
how many of them and on what terms. If, however, the contract labour is not
abolished, the industrial adjudicator has to reject the reference.
[iv] Even after the contract labour system is abolished, the direct employees of the
principal employer can raise an industrial dispute for absorption of the
ex-contractor's workmen and the adjudicator on the material placed before him can
decide as to who and how many of the workmen should be absorbed and on what
terms.
8.11. So long as the law protects the employer to engage the service of a contractor
and or a contract labour, the employer would be well within his rights to engage such
labour through a contractor. It is only in the event of a notification under Section 10
of the CLRA being
- 15 -
issued, then there would be an embargo on the employer engaging the labour
contractor.
8.12. In the present case, there being no such embargo issuing notification under
Section 10 of the CLRA, the contract entered into by the employer being proper and
correct, the workmen cannot seek for absorption or regularization.
8.13. General Manager (OSD), Bengal Nagpur Cotton Mills v. Bharat Lal4, more
particularly, para 10 thereof, which is reproduced hereunder for easy reference:
10. It is now well settled that if the industrial adjudicator finds that the contract
between the principal employer and the contractor to be a sham, nominal or merely a
camouflage to deny employment benefits to the employee and that there was in fact a
direct employment, it can grant relief to the employee by holding that the workman is
the direct employee of the principal employer. Two of the well-recognised tests to
find out whether the contract labourers are the direct employees of the principal
employer are: (i) whether the principal employer pays the salary instead of the
contractor; and (ii) whether the principal employer controls and [(2011) 1 SCC 635]
- 16 -
supervises the work of the employee. In this case, the Industrial Court answered both
questions in the affirmative and as a consequence held that the first respondent is a
direct employee of the appellant.
8.14. It is only if the principal employer pays the salary instead of contractor and
when the principal employer controls and supervises the work of the employee, that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/8096970/ 9
Vijaya Kumar B vs The Management Of M/S Leotech on 10 April, 2023
the contract labourer can be said to be direct employees of the principal employer.
8.15. Mathura Prasad Shrivastava v. Sagar Electric Supply Co. Ltd5., more
particularly, para 3 which is reproduced hereunder for easy reference:
3. We shall first take the question of bonus. It has again been urged before us that the
coal coolies employed by the so-called independent contractor are also entitled to
bonus. We however agree with the Tribunal that the question whether these coolies
were the employees of the Company or of an independent contractor was not raised
in the reference and that question cannot be considered indirectly while determining
the question of bonus. The Tribunal has accepted the evidence of the [(1966) 2 LLJ
307]
- 17 -
contractor who stated that the coal coolies were his employees and not that of the
Company. In these circumstances the question whether the coal coolies are the
contractor's employees or of the Company cannot be decided in this indirect manner
without even a proper reference on the question of abolition of contract labour. We
therefore agree with the Tribunal that the coal coolies employed by the contractor are
not entitled to any bonus.
8.16. Relying on the above, he submits that whether the labour were the employees of
the contractor or that of the employer cannot be decided without a proper reference
in that regard having been made, in the present case no such question having been
referred, the labour Court ought not to have pronounced its judgment on the same.
8.17. Sindhu Resettlement Corpn. Ltd. v.
Industrial Tribunal of Gujarat6, more particularly, para 4 and 5 thereof, which are
reproduced hereunder for easy reference:
4. The second ground urged on behalf of the appellant is that, in this case, no dispute
relating to reinstatement was actually raised either by [AIR 1968 SC 529]
- 18 -
Respondent 2 or Respondent 3 before the reference was made to the Industrial
Tribunal by the Government of Gujarat and, consequently, that reference itself was
without jurisdiction. When Mr A.K. Sen, counsel for the appellant, raised this ground,
it was urged by Mr Gopalakrishnan on behalf of the respondents that this ground was
being taken for the first time in this Court and had not been raised at any earlier
stage, so that it should not be allowed to be taken in this Court. It, however, appears
that the question of jurisdiction of the State Government to refer the demand for

reinstatement for adjudication to the Tribunal was specifically urged in the High
Court and the High Court actually dealt with it in its judgment, dismissing the
petition filed on behalf of the appellant. The High Court clearly mentions that the
counsel for the appellant contended that the Industrial Tribunal had no jurisdiction
as the question referred to it and which it was called upon to adjudicate relating to
reinstatement of Respondent 3 in the service of the Corporation would not fall within
the scope of Item 3 in the Second Schedule to the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. It
was further urged that, since the third respondent was neither discharged nor
dismissed by the appellant, the question of relief of reinstatement would not arise
under that item and, there being no item under which the demand would fall, the
State Government had no jurisdiction to refer such a demand for adjudication to the
Tribunal. These points urged before the High Court would cover the ground now
urged by Mr Sen before us. It is true that the form in which it was urged before the
High Court was slightly different. There, the point raised was that a demand for
reinstatement, when there had been retrenchment only and no discharge or
dismissal, could not be held to constitute an industrial dispute. On the facts of the
case as they appeared
- 19 -
from the material before the Tribunal, it is now urged that, in fact, the demand,
which was being pressed with the management by both the respondents, was in
respect of retrenchment compensation and not reinstatement. The demand for
reinstatement seems to have been given up, because the respondents realised that the
services of Respondent 3 had not been terminated by discharge or dismissal, but by
retrenchment only, and that retrenchment not being the result of any unfair labour
practice or victimization, Respondent 3 could only claim retrenchment
compensation. In the evidence given before the Tribunal, there were included two
letters written by the two respondents containing the demand for retrenchment
compensation. We have already referred to one of these letters which was sent on 7th
March, 1958 by Respondent 3 to the Administrative Officer of the appellant. The
other letter was sent on 10th July, 1958 by the General Secretary of Respondent 2 in
which again it was stated that Sindhu Hotchief had paid retrenchment dues to
Respondent 3 in respect of the services he had rendered in that Company, but the
appellant Corporation was responsible for his retrenchment dues for the service
which had been rendered by Respondent 3 in the appellant Corporation. The prayer
was that, as the appellant had refused him re-employment, arrangement should be
made to pay his retrenchment dues according to Section 25-F of the Industrial
Disputes Act, 1947. Thus, both the respondents, in their claims put forward before
the management of the appellant, requested for payment of retrenchment
compensation and did not raise any dispute for reinstatement. Since no such dispute
about reinstatement was raised by either of the respondents before the management
of the appellant, it is clear that the State Government was not competent to refer a
question of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/8096970/ 11
Vijaya Kumar B vs The Management Of M/S Leotech on 10 April, 2023
- 20 -
reinstatement as an industrial dispute for adjudication by the Tribunal. The dispute
that the State Government could have referred competently was the dispute relating
to payment of retrenchment compensation by the appellant to Respondent 3 which
had been refused. No doubt, the order of the State Government making the reference
mentions that the Government had considered the report submitted by the
Conciliation Officer under sub-section (4) of Section 12 of the Industrial Disputes
Act, in respect of the dispute between the appellant and workmen employed under it,
over the demand mentioned in the Schedule appended to that order; and, in the
Schedule, the Government mentioned that the dispute was that of reinstatement of
Respondent 3 in the service of the appellant and payment of his wages from 21st
February, 1958. It was urged by Mr Gopalakrishnan on behalf of the respondents that
this Court cannot examine whether the Government, in forming its opinion that an
industrial dispute exists, came to its view correctly or incorrectly on the material
before it. This proposition is, no doubt, correct; but the aspect that is being examined
is entirely different. It may be that the Conciliation Officer reported to the
Government that an industrial dispute did exist relating to the reinstatement of
Respondent 3 and payment of wages to him from 21st February, 1958, but when the
dispute came up for adjudication before the Tribunal, the evidence produced clearly
showed that no such dispute had ever been raised by either respondent with the
management of the appellant. If no dispute at all was raised by the respondents with
the management, any request sent by them to the Government would only be a
demand by them and not an industrial dispute between them and their employer. An
industrial dispute, as defined, must
- 21 -
be a dispute between employers and employers, employers and workmen, and
workmen and workmen. A mere demand to a Government, without a dispute being
raised by the workmen with their employer, cannot become an industrial dispute.
Consequently, the material before the Tribunal clearly showed that no such industrial
dispute, as was purported to be referred by the State Government to the Tribunal,
had ever existed between the appellant Corporation and the respondents and the
State Government in making a reference, obviously committed an error in basing its
opinion on material which was not relevant to the formation of opinion. The
Government had to come to an opinion that an industrial dispute did exist and that
opinion could only be formed on the basis that there was a dispute between the
appellant and the respondents relating to reinstatement. Such material could not
possibly exist when, as early as March and July 1958, Respondent 3 and Respondent
2 respectively had confined their demands to the management to retrenchment
compensation only and did not make any demand for reinstatement. On these facts,
it is clear that the reference made by the Government was not competent. The only
reference that the Government could have made had to be related to payment of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/8096970/ 12
Vijaya Kumar B vs The Management Of M/S Leotech on 10 April, 2023
retrenchment compensation which was the only subject-matter of dispute between
the appellant and the respondents.
5. So far as the third ground is concerned, it loses force and does not arise in view of
our decision relating to the first ground. We have already held, when dealing with the
first ground, that the appellant had neither dismissed Respondent 3, nor had it
discharged him from service. There was no question of wrongful dismissal or
discharge by the appellant. It was not even a case of retrenchment,
- 22 -
because Respondent 3 had willingly gone to join the service under Sindhu Hotchief.
He obviously joined the service in Sindhu Hotchief because of the financial
advantages that were to accrue to him. In September 1953, he was drawing a salary of
Rs 200 p.m. in the scale of Rs 150-10-250 while serving the appellant. The site
allowance of 20 per cent, which he had been receiving earlier, had been discontinued
from March 1952 and he was not getting it at the time when he went to join Sindhu
Hotchief, where he was given a start of Rs 240 in the grade of Rs 200-20-400.
Consequently, in addition to the immediate rise in salary of Rs 40 p.m., he had the
advantage of working in the higher grade, in which, within two years, he exceeded the
maximum of the scale in which he had been working with the appellant. He served
Sindhu Hotchief for a period of about 4½ years and became confirmed there in
accordance with the terms and conditions which were offered to him by Sindhu
Hotchief. In these circumstances, the respondents cannot urge that the services of
Respondent 3 were retrenched by the appellant, either when he went and joined
Sindhu Hotchief, or when he wanted to get back to his post with the appellant. His
appointment in the service of the appellant having terminated, no question could
arise of retrenching him at the stage when he wanted to come back after serving
Sindhu Hotchief. His services were, in fact retrenched by his new employer, Sindhu
Hotchief, and from that Company he received retrenchment compensation. The third
ground, therefore, needs no consideration.
8.18. Relying on the above, he submits that the Labour Court could not decide the
dispute merely because it was raised before it unless
- 23 -
it is raised before the Government who after examination of the same was of the
opinion that it would have to be referred to the labour Court on account of failure of
conciliation.
Without an opportunity and specific reference of a dispute to the labour Court, the
labour Court would not have jurisdiction to decide on the same.

8.19. In the case of Jaipur Udyog Ltd. v. Cement Work Karmachari Sangh7, more
particularly, para 7 thereof, which is reproduced hereunder for easy reference:
7. In our view, if the Tribunal had taken care to examine what was the dispute
between the parties when the Government made the order of reference it would have
had no difficulty in realising that no dispute was raised either by the workman or the
Union that the age of superannuation governing the workman was not 55 years. It
was certainly open to the workman to contend that his age of superannuation should
be fixed at 58 and not 55 years and it would have been equally open to the union to
raise the point in their representation to the Conciliation Officer. If that had been
done, the Government of Rajasihan could have properly made [(1972) 1 SCC 691]
- 24 -
a reference of a dispute between the parties regarding the correct age of
superannuation and the adjudication of the dispute regarding the superannuation of
the workman concerned on that basis. Nothing was however shown to us, apart from
the documents already referred to enable us to find that any question had been raised
before the Government of Rajasthan relating to the age of superannuation of the
workman at the quarries or that there was any basis for apprehension of such a
dispute and it was therefore not open to the Tribunal to enlarge the ambit of the
dispute between the parties by reference to the difference in the age of
superannuation under the two sets of Standing Orders. Mr Setalvad drew our
attention to the judgment of this Court in Sindhu Resettlement Corporation Lid. v.
Industrial Tribunal of Gujarat [AIR 1968 SC 425 : (1968) 1 SCR 515 : (1968) 1 Lab LJ
834] for the proposition that unless a dispute was raised by the workman with their
employer it could not become an industrial dispute. Respondent 3 before this Court
in that case was employed by the appellant as an accounts clerk at Gandhidham in
the year 1950. Some years thereafter his services were placed at the disposal of the
subsidiary company of the appellant. The respondent was appointed in the said
subsidiary company on a different set of conditions of service. He worked with that
company up to February 1958, when his services were terminated after payment of
retrenchment compensation and other dues by the said subsidiary company. The
respondent then went to the appellant and requested that he might be given posting
orders. The appellant declined to do so on the ground that the post which he was
occupying in 1953 had been permanently filled up. Thereupon the respondent
demanded retrenchment compensation from the appellant also. As the
representations of the respondent were not fruitful, conciliation proceedings were
started and ultimately, on the report of the
- 25 -
Conciliation Officer, the State of Gujarat referred the dispute to the Industrial
Tribunal. The matter referred for adjudication was, "whether the said respondent
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/8096970/ 14
Vijaya Kumar B vs The Management Of M/S Leotech on 10 April, 2023
should be reinstated in the service of the appellant and be paid back wages from
February 21, 1958". The Tribunal directed reinstatement and payment of back wages.
In allowing the appeal, this Court observed that the respondent workman had only
asked for payment of retrenchment compensation and did not raise any dispute for
reinstatement. According to this Court (see p. 622):
"... the evidence produced clearly showed that no such dispute (i.e. relating to
reinstatement) had ever been raised by the respondent with the management of the
appellant. If no dispute at all was raised by the respondents with the management,
any request sent by them to the Government would only be a demand by them and
not an industrial dispute between them and their employer".
Relying on the above decision Mr Setalvad argued that in order that a reference can be construed to
embrace a particular dispute it must be shown that a demand had been made by the workman and
not accepted by the employers so as to give rise to a dispute which in the view of the Government
required adjudication. Mr Ramamurty on behalf of the respondents drew our attention to the
provisions of Section 10(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act and in particular to clauses (c) and (d)
thereof. He argued that it was open to the appropriate Government in an appropriate case to refer a
dispute along with any matter appearing to be connected with or relevant to the dispute and no
objection could be taken to the award of the Tribunal where the Tribunal had not transgressed the
limits of clauses (c) and (d) of Section 10(1) of the Act. It was further contended that the proper age
of superannuation applicable to the company as a whole was so intimately connected
- 26 -
with or relevant to the dispute which actually arose between the parties prior to the order of
reference as to lead us to hold that the Tribunal had not gone beyond its jurisdiction in construing
the order of reference to embrace an adjudication as to proper age of superannuation of a workman
like Bhisham Verma. In our view, the finding of the Tribunal that the Company could not fix a lower
age limit of superannuation for workmen at the quarries went beyond the scope of reference which
had to be gathered from the circumstances preceding the Government Order. The Tribunal never
addressed itself to the point of view of the workman that his proper age was only 50 and 55; nor did
it come to a finding that the true age of the workman being 50 years in 1968 there was no question
of his superannuation in that year.
8.20. Relying on the above, he submits that the labour Court cannot go beyond what was referred to
it.

3. The Management filed a statement of case before the Special Tribunal on April 9,
1966 and the Unions filed separate statements of case between April 10, 1966 and
April 13, 1966. There were Replications and Rejoinders up to May 21, 1966.
[AIR 1967 SC 469]
- 27 -
4. On June 3, 1966, the Company prayed before the Industrial Tribunal that Issues 1, 3 and 4(set out
in the terms of reference) may be decided before the parties were called upon to lead their evidence.
As regards Issues 3 and 4, the contention of the management was that the fundamental basis of
these two matters was that there was a strike at the Delhi Cloth Mills and a sit-down strike at the
Swatantra Bharat Mills and the only question referred to the Tribunal for decision related to the
legality and justification of the said strikes. All the four Unions contended before the Tribunal that
there was no strike at the Delhi Cloth Mills. Two of the Unions' case was that the strike at Swatantra
Bharat Mills was in sympathy with the workmen of the Delhi Cloth Mills; while the other two
Unions' case was that there was a lockout in the Swatantra Bharat Mills. As regards the first issue,
the case of the Management was that there was a settlement on December 13, 1965 relating to the
computation of bonus for the year 1963-64 between the Company and the two major Unions. It was
stated further that the settlement referred to the computation of bonus in accordance with the
provisions of the Payment of Bonus Act, 1965 and in arriving at the settlement, all the available and
relevant financial statements had been shown to the Unions which accepted the accounts based on
allocation of share capital and reserves during the years previous to and including 1963-64. Further,
according to the Management, one of the Unions had entered into another settlement with the
Management of the DCM Silk Mills with regard to that Union for the year 1964-65, and in view of
these settlements, it was not open to the workmen of the Delhi Cloth Mills and Swatantra Bharat
Mills to question the correctness and reasonableness of the allocations made by the Management
towards share capital and reserves of these two units.
- 28 -
8.22. Relying on the above, he submits that it is only the workmen of the employer who could raise a
dispute with reference to that employer. The workmen of another employer, in this case a contractor
cannot raise a dispute with the petitioner inasmuch as they are not the employees of the petitioner.

5. The first demand on behalf of the workmen as respects the education allowance of
the children was chiefly based upon the educational facilities said to be available to
the workmen of Bangalore. On behalf of the management it was pointed out that
certain educational facilities were given to the employees living in the township of
Bangalore out not in the city of Bangalore. The workmen working at Barrackpore had
also been provided with certain educational facilities. We, however, do not propose to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/8096970/ 16
Vijaya Kumar B vs The Management Of M/S Leotech on 10 April, 2023
go into the merits of the rival contentions. In our opinion the award directing the
company to pay Rs. 12/- per month to each employee to meet educational expenses of
their children irrespective of the number of children a particular workman may have
is beyond the scope of the issue referred for adjudication. The [1975 II LLJ SC 336]
- 29 -
Tribunal while discussing this issue felt constrained to think that strictly speaking claim for
allowance for the education of employees' children could not form a subject matter of industry.
dispute. Really it was a matter to be taken into consideration at the time of fixing their wages. In
substance and in effect the directions given by the Tribunal is by way of revision of the pay structure
of the Barrackpore employees. No such reference was either asked for or made. The Tribunal,
therefore, had no jurisdiction to change the wage structure in the garb of allowing educational
expenses for the employees' children. We may add that on behalf of the appellant it was stated
before us that the latest revised wage structure has taken the matter of education of the employees'
children into consideration, while, Mr. A. K. San, appearing for the workmen, did not accept it to be
so. If necessary and advisable a proper industrial 1) dispute may be raised in that regard in future
but the award as it stands cannot be upheld.
8.24. The labour Court would not have jurisdiction to change the wage contract by awarding any
expenses if the said expenses had not been claimed before the government and that issue had not
been referred for adjudication to the labour Court.
8.25. On the basis of the above, he submits that the reference ought to have been answered in
- 30 -
favour of the employer and the claims by the workmen ought to have been rejected.
9. Sri.A.J.Srinivasan, learned counsel for the workmen submits that, 9.1. While supporting the
award passed by the labour court submits that when reinstatement has been ordered, the labour
court as a natural consequence ought to have directed the payment of full back wages. The order of
termination or refusal of employment when set aside as being illegal and unjustified, the workmen
would be entitled to reinstatement with all consequential benefits like continuity of service including
back wages. It is only in exceptional circumstances, that back wages could be denied.
9.2. The labour court having held in favour of the workmen has not given any reason whatsoever for
depriving the workmen of consequential benefits and full back wages.
- 31 -
9.3. The workmen being prevented from working at the employer's place by the employer on
account of an illegal termination the principle of 'no work no pay' would not apply and the employer
would be liable to make payment of the full back wages.

which is reproduced hereunder for easy reference:
119 (5) On issuance of prohibition notification under Section 10(1) of the CLRA Act
prohibiting employment of contract labour or otherwise, in an industrial dispute
brought before it by any contract labour in regard to conditions of service, the
industrial adjudicator will have to consider the question whether the contractor has
been interposed either on the ground of having undertaken to produce any given
result for the establishment or for supply of contract labour for work of the
establishment under a genuine contract or is a mere ruse/camouflage to evade
compliance with various beneficial legislations so as to deprive [(2001) 7 SCC 1],
- 32 -
the workers of the benefit thereunder. If the contract is found to be not genuine but a mere
camouflage, the so-called contract labour will have to be treated as employees of the principal
employer who shall be directed to regularise the services of the contract labour in the establishment
concerned subject to the conditions as may be specified by it for that purpose in the light of para 6
hereunder.
9.6. Relying on the above, learned counsel submits that if the labour contract is found not to be
genuine but a mere camouflage, the contract labour will have to be treatd as employees of the
principal employer.

has been clearly stated therein that subterfuge was resorted to by the appellant to
show that the [(2011) 15 SCC 209]
- 33 -
workmen concerned were only workmen of a contractor. The Labour Court has held that the
workmen were the employees of the appellant and not employees of the contractor. Cogent reasons
have been given by the Labour Court to come to this finding. The Labour Court has held that, in fact,
the workmen concerned were working under the orders of the officers of the appellant, and were
being paid Rs 70 per day, while the workmen/employees of the contractor were paid Rs 56 per day.
We are of the opinion that the High Court has rightly refused to interfere with this finding of fact
recorded by the Labour Court.

- 34 -
18. The second respondent Tribunal has adjudicated the industrial dispute between
the parties as per the points of dispute referred to it by the Union of India.
It has conducted an enquiry under Section 11 and 15 of the I.D. Act and answered the points of
dispute referred to it in favour of the concerned workmen holding that the petitioner Bank has not
justified in not regularising the concerned Ticca-Mazdoors whose names are mentioned in the order
of reference after considering the material evidence on record by assigning valid and cogent reasons.
The Tribunal has referred to at paragraph 7 of the impugned Award with reference to the pleadings
and the documents produced on record by the parties before it. It has considered the statistics given
by the concerned workmen when they have been working as ticca mazdoors which fact is not
disputed by the bank and therefore Tribunal has recorded a finding in favour of the concerned
workmen. Further at paragraph 8 of the Award it has stated that from the admitted facts set out in
Para 2 out of 32 workmen, 12 workmen have been working as ticca mazdoors since 1982, 3 have
been working since 1983, one has been working since 1984, as many as 13 have been working since
1986 and 4 ticca mazdoors have been working since 1988. It is further held that it is not as if that the
32 workmen were recruited as ticca mazdoors to work in casual vacancies accrued recently. All the
ticca mazdoors involved in the reference have been working for a long time ranging from 7 to 13
years as on the date of passing the award by the Tribunal and they have been working as Ticca
mazdoors even now. With reference to the said factual aspect, the Tribunal further at paragraph 9 of
the impugned Award considered the law laid down by the Apex Court in the case reported in the
case of The Gen. Secy., Bihar State Road Transport Corporation, Patna v. The Presiding Officer,
Industrial Tribunal, Patna [(1988) 2 LLJ 109.] which is similar to the case of the concerned
workmen who
- 35 -
are covered in the order of reference made to the Tribunal and further the learned presiding officer
of the Tribunal, placed reliance on the law laid down by the Apex Court wherein it has held that
"Since it is admitted by the bank that a large number of people have been working as casual
labourers for a long number of years, the question whether they were initially appointed regularly or
irregularly becomes immaterial for purposes of answering the real question involved in this case as
per the points of dispute and the dispute is resolved between the parties and further at paragraph 10
of the Award it has placed reliance upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Bhagavati
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/8096970/ 19
Vijaya Kumar B vs The Management Of M/S Leotech on 10 April, 2023
Prasad v. Delhi State Mineral Development Corporation [1990 (1) LLJ 320.] , at paragraph 6 of the
said judgment the Apex Court has held stating that "once the appointments of the concerned
workmen were made as daily rated workers and they have allowed to work for a considerable length
of time in the Bank therefore, it would be hard and harsh to deny them the confirmation in the
respective posts on the ground that they lack the prescribed Educational qualification". With
reference to the law laid down in the said case, the learned Presiding Officer of the Tribunal has
recorded a finding holding that the law laid down in the said case will all fours applicable to the
present case for the reason that all the 32 concerned workmen have the necessary qualification to be
appointed as permanent employees in their respective posts.
20. Further at paragraph 13 of the impugned award the Tribunal has referred to entry at serial 10 of
the V Schedule to Section 2(ra) under the heading unfair Labour Practice on the part of the
employer as enumerated under the I.D. Act which clearly states employing workmen as casuals or
temporaries and to continue them as such for years, with the object of depriving them of the status
and privileges of
- 36 -
permanent workmen, is an unfair labour practice. With reference to the said entry in the V
Schedule, the Presiding Officer of the Tribunal has recorded a finding holding that the action of the
Bank in not regularising the 32 concerned workmen as permanent Mazdoors would clearly amounts
to unfair labour practice. The Tribunal has also considered the legal submissions made on behalf of
the Bank placing reliance on the judgment of the Apex Court, reported in, in the case of
Maharashtra State Co- operative Cotton Grower's Marketing Federation Ltd. v. Maharashtra State
Co-operative Cotton Growers' Marketing Federation Employees' Union [1994 Supp (3) SCC 385 :
AIR 1994 SC 1046.] which relates to the seasonal employees, therefore the Tribunal has rightly held
that the ratio laid down in that case has no application to the facts of the case on hand. Further,
reliance is placed by the Bank upon another judgment of the Supreme Court reported in 1993 (II)
LLJ 937 in the case of Piara Singh v. State of Haryana [1993 (11) LLJ 937.] , wherein the Supreme
Court has noticed that some initial recruitments were in violation of the norms and rules. In that
process, some employees had secured employment through the back door method. Under the said
circumstances, the Apex Court set aside the judgment of the Punjab and Haryana High Court and
held that it would be difficult to sustain the direction of the Punjab and Haryana High Court holding
that all those ad-hoc employees who have put in one year's service should be regularised, and the
direction was given without reference to the existence of vacancies. The law laid down in the said
case has been considered by the Presiding Officer of the Tribunal and the observations made in the
said judgment at paragraph 51 is also considered wherein the Apex Court has clearly held that if a
casual labourer is continued for a fairly long spell, say 2 or 3 years, the presumption may arise that
there is regular need for his services. In such a situation, it
- 37 -
becomes obligatory for the concerned authority to examine the feasibility of his regularisation, and
while doing so, the authorities ought to adopt a positive approach coupled with an empathy for the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/8096970/ 20
Vijaya Kumar B vs The Management Of M/S Leotech on 10 April, 2023
person. The said judgment has been considered and distinguished and applied to this case, relying
upon the observations made at paragraph 51 of said judgment and it has rightly held that the
concerned workmen have been working a long spell and they have been continued to work in the
Bank and therefore the Tribunal has held that concerned workmen in the dispute are entitled to be
regularised as permanent workmen in their respective posts.
21. The Apex Court in the case of H.D. Singh v. Reserve Bank of India [(1985) 4 SCC 201.]
considering various provisions under Section 2(oo), 2(A), 25-B(2)(a)(ii), 25-F, 25-N and 25-Q and
also with reference to the fifth Schedule Item No. 10 and Sections 25-T and 25-U at paragraphs 13
and 14 has made certain observations with reference to the confidential circular which are extracted
hereunder:
"13. The confidential circular directing its officers that workmen like the appellant
should not be engaged continuously but should as far as possible, be offered work on
rotation basis and the case that the appellant is a badli worker, have to be
characterised as unfair labour practice. The Fifth Schedule to the Industrial Disputes
Act contains a list of unfair labour practises as defined in Section 2(ra). Item 10 reads
as follows:
To employ workmen as 'badlis', casuals or temporaries and to continue them as such
for years, with the object of depriving them to the status and privileges of permanent
workmen.
We have no option but to observe that the bank, in this case, has indulged in methods
amounting to
- 38 -
unfair labour practice. The plea that the appellant was a badli worker also has to fail.
14. We thought it necessary to refer to the actual details in the case only to show our
concern at the manner in which the employer in this case, the Reserve Bank of India,
who should set a model for other employers being a prestigious institution, behaved
towards its employees. It must have been his helpless condition and abject poverty
that forced the appellant to accept a job on Rs. 3/- per day. Still see how he has been
treated. We will not be far from truth if we say that the Bank has deliberately
indulged in unhealthy labour practice by rotating employees like the appellant do
deny them benefits under the industrial law. It has disturbed us to find that the
appellant was denied job because he had become better qualified perhaps the Reserve
Bank of India and its Officers are not aware of the grave unemployment problem
facing the youth of this Country and also not aware of the fact that graduates, both
boys and girls, sweep our roads and post-graduates in hundreds, if not in thousands,
apply for the posts of peons. It has been our sad experience to find employers trying
to stifle the efforts of employees in their legitimate claims seeking benefits under the

Vijaya Kumar B vs The Management Of M/S Leotech on 10 April, 2023
Industrial Law by tiring them out in adjudication proceedings raising technical and
hyper-technical pleas. Industrial adjudication in bona fide claims have been dragged
on by employers for years together on such pleas. It would always be desirable for
employers to meet the case of the employees squarely on merits and get them
adjudicated quickly. This would help industrial peace. It is too late in the day for this
Court to alert the employers that their attempt should be to evolve a contended
labour. We do not forget at the same time the fact that it is necessary for the labour
also to reciprocate to prevent industrial unrest. In this case, for example, the Bank
should have treated the
- 39 -
appellant as a regular hand in List II. Instead, the Bank has, by adopting dubious methods, invited
from us, remarks which we would have normally avoided".
9.10. If the employer were to engage the contract labour only for the purpose of reducing its burden
and thereby seek to take advantage of the position of the workmen, the same would amount to
unhealthy labour practice requiring the labour Court to interfere which the labour Court has done.
Hence, no fault could be found in relation thereto.
9.11. Shankar Balaji Waje v. State of Maharashtra13, more particularly para 37 which is reproduced
hereunder for easy reference:
37. With this background let us look at the definition of "worker" in Section 2(1) of
the Act. "Worker" is defined to mean "a person employed, directly or through any
agency, whether for wages or not, in any manufacturing process ...". Under this
definition, a person employed in a manufacturing process is a worker. The question
raised in this case turns upon the interpretation of the word "employed" in the [AIR
1962 SC 517]
- 40 -
definition. This Court in Chintaman Rao v. State of Madhya Pradesh [1958 SCR 1340] defined the
word "employed" thus at p. 1346:
"The concept of employment involves three ingredients : (1) employer (2) employee
and (3) the contract of employment. The employer is one who employs i.e. one who
engages the services of other persons. The employee is one who works for another for
hire. The employment is the contract of service between the employer and the
employee whereunder the employee agrees to serve the employer subject to his
control and supervision."
In making out the distinction between an employer and an independent contractor, this Court in the
above case quoted the following observations of Bhagwati, J., in Dharangadhara Chemical Works
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/8096970/ 22
Vijaya Kumar B vs The Management Of M/S Leotech on 10 April, 2023
Ltd. v. State of Saurashtra [(1957) SCR 152, 157] :
"The test which is uniformly applied in order to determine the relationship is the
existence of a right of control in respect of the manner in which the work is to be
done."
The same view was reiterated by this Court in State of Kerala v. V.M. Patel [ Criminal Appeal No. 42
of 1949 (Judgment dated 12-10-60)] . That was a case where 23 persons were employed in the
process of garbling pepper and packing them in bags. Hidayatullah, J., speaking for the Court,
stated:
"It was observed that, to determine whether a person was a 'worker', the proper test
was to see whether or not the 'employer' had control and supervision over the
manner in which the work was to be done".
- 41 -
Adverting to the distinction between an independent contractor and a servant, the learned Judge
proceeded to state:
"An independent contractor is charged with a work, and has to produce a particular
result; but the manner in which the result is to be achieved is left to him. A servant,
on the other hand, may also be charged with the work and asked to produce a
particular result, but is subject to the directions of the master as to the manner in
which the result is to be achieved."
This decision also emphasized that a right to control or supervise is one of the tests for determining
the relationship of master and servant. In this context a judgment of the Madras High Court in
Palaniappa v. Court of Additional First Class Magistrate, Kulitalai [ILR 1958 Mad 999] is strongly
relied upon on behalf of the appellant. There, the petitioner was the owner of a weaving concern at
Karur. He had put up a thatched shed where he had installed a certain number of handlooms and
where towels and bed-sheets were manufactured. His office consisted of only two clerks, who were
the permanent members of his establishment. Some of the residents of the village, most of whom
were agriculturists, but who knew weaving, used to go to the petitioner's shed when they had time,
and when they felt inclined to do so and they were supplied with yarn. These, they wove into
bed-sheets and towels and they were paid at certain rates for the articles they wove. These persons
came in and went out when they liked. On those facts, Balakrishna Ayya, J., held that they were not
"workers" within the definition of the word "worker" in the Factories Act. After considering the
relevant decisions cited and after distinguishing the cases arising under the Industrial Disputes Act,
the learned Judge proceeded to state at p. 1009 thus:
- 42 -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/8096970/ 23
Vijaya Kumar B vs The Management Of M/S Leotech on 10 April, 2023
"An examination of these decisions confirms what one was inclined to suspect at the
outset viz. that 'employed' is a word with a varying content of meaning and that it
signifies different things in different places.... On the other hand, when we say that X
is employed by Y we ordinarily imply that Y remunerates X for his services and that
he has a certain measure of control over his time and skill and labour. But the degree
and extent of control, may be nominal or extensive.... In between lie infinite grades of
control and supervision. But a certain amount of supervision or control is necessarily
implied in the connotation of the word 'employed'."
Having said that, the learned Judge graphically describes the relationship between the parties thus
at p. 1010:
"The worker can come any day he likes, work as long as he likes or as short as he likes
and go away. He may work fast or he may work slow. The petitioner cannot tell him
that he should work on towels and not on bed-sheets or vice versa... And, more
important of all, the petitioner cannot prevent anybody from working for a competing
manufacturer. Come when you like, go when you like, work when you like, stop when
you like, work as fast as you like, work as slow as you like, work on what you like or
not at all, that is the position of the workers vis-a-vis the petitioner. Such persons
cannot, in my opinion, be said to be 'employed' by the petitioner within the meaning
of clause (1) of Section 2 of the Factories Act."
It is not necessary to express our opinion whether the conclusion of the learned Judge on the facts of
that case is correct or not. But the principle accepted by him, namely, that a certain amount of
supervision or control is necessarily implied in the
- 43 -
connotation of the word "employed", has been accepted by this Court in earlier decisions and this
decision is only an application of that principle to a different set of facts.
9.12. Relying on the above, he submits that the employer maintain the productivity of the workmen
inasmuch as it is the employer who fixes the deliverables and not the contractor, therefore, it is the
workmen who had charged with the contract and not the contractor thereby amounting that the
workmen were direct employees under the direct supervision of the employer.
9.13. Bhuvnesh Kumar Dwivedi v. Hindalco Industries Ltd14., more particularly para Nos. 24, 25,
26, 27, 30, 31, 32, 34 and 35 thereof, which are reproduced hereunder for easy reference:
24. The respondent, in order to mitigate its conduct towards the appellant has
claimed that the appellant was appointed solely on contract basis, and his service has
been terminated in the manner permissible under Section 2(oo)(bb) of the ID Act.
[(2014) 11 SCC 85],
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/8096970/ 24
Vijaya Kumar B vs The Management Of M/S Leotech on 10 April, 2023
- 44 -
However, we shall not accept this contention of the respondent for the following reasons:
(i) Firstly, the respondent has not produced any material evidence on record before
the Labour Court to prove that it meets all the required criteria under the Contract
Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970, to be eligible to employ employees on
contractual basis which includes licence number, etc.
(ii) Secondly, the respondent could not produce any material evidence on record
before the Labour Court to show that the appellant was employed for any particular
project(s) on the completion of which his service has been terminated through
non-renewal of his contract of employment.
25. Therefore, we deem it fit to construe that the appellant has rendered continuous service for six
continuous years (save the artificially imposed break) as provided under Section 25-B of the ID Act
and can therefore be subjected to retrenchment only through the procedure mentioned in the ID Act
or the State Act in pari materia.
26. Therefore, we answer Point (ii) in favour of the appellant holding that the Labour Court was
correct in holding that the action of the respondent employer is a clear case of retrenchment of the
appellant, which action requires to comply with the mandatory requirement of the provisions of
Section 6-N of the U.P. ID Act. Undisputedly, the same has not been complied with and therefore,
the order of retrenchment has been rendered void ab initio in law.
Answer to Point (iii)
27. Having answered Point (ii) in favour of the appellant, we also answer Point (iii) in his favour
- 45 -
since we construe that the appellant is a worker of the respondent Company providing continuous
service for 6 years except for the artificial breaks imposed upon him with an oblique motive by the
respondent Company. We hold that the termination of service of the appellant amounts to
"retrenchment" in the light of the principle laid down by the three-Judge Bench decision of this
Court in SBI v. N. Sundara Money [(1976) 1 SCC 822 : 1976 SCC (L&S) 132 : AIR 1976 SC 1111] and
attracts the provisions of Section 6-N of the U.P. ID Act. The case mentioned above, N. Sundara
Money case [(1976) 1 SCC 822 : 1976 SCC (L&S) 132 : AIR 1976 SC 1111] illustrates the elements
which constitute retrenchment. The relevant paragraphs read as under : (SCC pp. 826-27, para 9)
"9. A breakdown of Section 2(oo) unmistakably expands the semantics of retrenchment.
'Termination ... for any reason whatsoever' are the key words. Whatever the reason, every
termination spells retrenchment. So the sole question is, has the employee's service been
terminated? Verbal apparel apart, the substance is decisive. A termination takes place where a term
expires either by the active step of the master or the running out of the stipulated term. To protect
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/8096970/ 25
Vijaya Kumar B vs The Management Of M/S Leotech on 10 April, 2023
the weak against the strong this policy of comprehensive definition has been effectuated.
Termination embraces not merely the act of termination by the employer, but the fact of termination
howsoever produced. May be, the present may be a hard case, but we can visualise abuses by
employers, by suitable verbal devices, circumventing the armour of Section 25-F and Section 2(oo).
Without speculating on possibilities, we may agree that 'retrenchment' is no longer terra incognita
but area covered by an expansive definition. It means 'to end, conclude, cease'. In the present case
the employment ceased, concluded, ended on the expiration of one year ten months nine
- 46 -
days -- automatically may be, but cessation all the same. That to write into the order of appointment
the date of termination confers no moksha from Section 25-F(b) is inferable from the proviso to
Section 25-F(1) [sic 25-F(a)]. True, the section speaks of retrenchment by the employer and it is
urged that some act of volition by the employer to bring about the termination is essential to attract
Section 25-F and automatic extinguishment of service by effluxion of time cannot be sufficient. An
English case R. v. Secy. of State for Social Services, ex p Khan [(1973) 1 WLR 187 : (1973) 2 All ER
104 (CA)] was relied on, where Lord Denning, M.R. observed : (WLR pp. 189-90) '... I think that the
word "terminate" or "termination" is by itself ambiguous. It can refer to either of two things--either
to termination by notice or to termination by effluxion of time. It is often used in that dual sense in
landlord and tenant and in master and servant cases. But there are several indications in this
paragraph to show that it refers here only to termination by notice.' Buckley, L.J., concurred and
said : (WLR p. 191) '... In my judgment the words are not capable of bearing that meaning. As
[Counsel for the Secretary of State] has pointed out, the verb "terminate" can be used either
transitively or intransitively. A contract may be said to terminate when it comes to an end by
effluxion of time, or it may be said to be terminated when it is determined at notice or otherwise by
some act of one of the parties. Here in my judgment the word "terminated" is used in this passage in
para 190 in the transitive sense and it postulates some act by somebody which is to bring the
appointment to an end, and is not applicable to a case in which the appointment comes to an end
merely by effluxion of time.'
- 47 -
Words of multiple import have to be winnowed judicially to suit the social philosophy of the statute.
So screened, we hold that the transitive and intransitive senses are covered in the current context.
Moreover, an employer terminates employment not merely by passing an order as the service runs.
He can do so by writing a composite order, one giving employment and the other ending or limiting
it. A separate, subsequent determination is not the sole magnetic pull of the provision. A pre-
emptive provision to terminate is struck by the same vice as the post-appointment termination.
Dexterity of diction cannot defeat the articulated conscience of the provision."
28. Section 6-N of the U.P. ID Act which is in pari materia with Section 25-N of the ID Act reads
thus:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/8096970/ 26
Vijaya Kumar B vs The Management Of M/S Leotech on 10 April, 2023
"6-N. Conditions precedent to retrenchment of workmen.--No workman employed in
any industry who has been in continuous service for not less than one year under an
employer shall be retrenched by that employer until--
(a) the workman has been given one month's notice in writing indicating the reasons
for retrenchment and the period of notice has expired or the workman has been paid
in lieu of such notice, wages for the period of notice:
Provided that no such notice shall be necessary if the retrenchment is under an
agreement which specifies the date of termination of service;
(b) the workman has been paid, at the time of retrenchment, compensation which
shall be equivalent to fifteen day's average pay for every completed year of service or
any part thereof in excess of six months; and
- 48 -
(c) notice in the prescribed manner is served on the State Government."
Evidently, the abovesaid mandatory procedure has not been followed in the present case. Further, it
has been held by this Court in Anoop Sharma v. Public Health Division [(2010) 5 SCC 497 : (2010) 2
SCC (L&S) 63] as under
"3. ... no workman employed in any industry who has been in continuous service for
not less than one year under an employer can be retrenched by that employer until
the conditions enumerated in clauses
(a) and (b) of Section 25-F of the Act are satisfied.
In terms of clause (a), the employer is required to give to the workman one month's notice in writing
indicating the reasons for retrenchment or pay him wages in lieu of the notice. Clause (b) casts a
duty upon the employer to pay to the workman at the time of retrenchment, compensation
equivalent to fifteen days' average pay for every completed year of continuous service or any part
thereof in excess of six months. This Court has repeatedly held that Sections 25-F(a) and (b) of the
Act are mandatory and non-compliance therewith renders the retrenchment of an employee
nullity--State of Bombay v. Hospital Mazdoor Sabha [AIR 1960 SC 610] , Bombay Union of
Journalists v. State of Bombay [AIR 1964 SC 1617 : (1964) 6 SCR 22] , SBI v. N. Sundara Money

Pramod Jha v. State of Bihar [(2003) 4 SCC 619 : 2003 SCC (L&S) 545].This Court
has used different expressions for describing the consequence of terminating a
workman's service/employment/engagement by way of retrenchment without
complying with the mandate of Section 25-F of the Act. Sometimes it has been
termed as ab initio void, sometimes as illegal per se, sometimes as nullity and
sometimes as non est. Leaving aside the legal semantics, we have no hesitation to
hold that termination of service of an employee by way of retrenchment without
complying with the requirement of giving one month's notice or pay in lieu thereof
and compensation in terms of Sections 25-F(a) and (b) has the effect of rendering the
action of the employer as nullity and the employee is entitled to continue in
employment as if his service was not terminated."
(emphasis supplied) Therefore, in the light of the law provided in the ID Act and its
State counterpart through the U.P. ID Act and also on the basis of the legal principle
laid down by this Court, we hold that the termination of service of the appellant was
illegal and void ab initio.
29. Therefore, the Labour Court was correct on factual evidence on record and legal principles laid
down by this Court in a catena of cases in holding that the appellant is entitled to reinstatement with
all consequential benefits. Therefore, we set aside the order of the High Court and uphold the order
of the Labour Court by holding that the appellant is entitled to reinstatement in the respondent
Company.
30. On the issue of back wages to be awarded in favour of the appellant, it has been held by this
Court in Shiv Nandan Mahto v. State of Bihar
- 50 -
[(2013) 11 SCC 626] that if a workman is kept out of service due to the fault or mistake of the
establishment/company he was working in, then the workman is entitled to full back wages for the
period he was illegally kept out of service. The relevant paragraph of the judgment reads as under:
"5. ... In fact, a perusal of the aforesaid short order passed by the Division Bench
would clearly show that the High Court had not even acquainted itself with the fact
that the appellant was kept out of service due to a mistake. He was not kept out of
service on account of suspension, as wrongly recorded by the High Court. The
conclusion is, therefore, obvious that the appellant could not have been denied the
benefit of back wages on the ground that he had not worked for the period when he
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/8096970/ 28
Vijaya Kumar B vs The Management Of M/S Leotech on 10 April, 2023
was illegally kept out of service. In our opinion, the appellant was entitled to be paid
full back wages for the period he was kept out of service."
31. Further, in Haryana Roadways v. Rudhan Singh [(2005) 5 SCC 591 : 2005 SCC (L&S) 716] , the
three-Judge Bench of this Court considered the question whether back wages should be awarded to
the workman in each and every case of illegal retrenchment. The relevant paragraph reads as under :
(SCC p. 596, para 8) There is no rule of thumb that in every case where the Industrial Tribunal gives
a finding that the termination of service was in violation of Section 25- F of the Act, entire back
wages should be awarded. A host of factors like the manner and method of selection and
appointment i.e. whether after proper advertisement of the vacancy or inviting applications from the
employment exchange, nature of appointment, namely, whether ad hoc, short term, daily wage,
temporary or permanent in character, any special qualification required for the job and the
- 51 -
like should be weighed and balanced in taking a decision regarding award of back wages. One of the
important factors, which has to be taken into consideration, is the length of service, which the
workman had rendered with the employer. If the workman has rendered a considerable period of
service and his services are wrongfully terminated, he may be awarded full or partial back wages
keeping in view the fact that at his age and the qualification possessed by him he may not be in a
position to get another employment. However, where the total length of service rendered by a
workman is very small, the award of back wages for the complete period i.e. from the date of
termination till the date of the award, which our experience shows is often quite large, would be
wholly inappropriate. Another important factor, which requires to be taken into consideration is the
nature of employment. A regular service of permanent character cannot be compared to short or
intermittent daily-wage employment though it may be for 240 days in a calendar year."
32. Subsequently, in Deepali Gundu Surwase v. Kranti Junior Adhyapak Mahavidyalaya [Deepali
Gundu Surwase v. Kranti Junior Adhyapak Mahavidyalaya, (2013) 10 SCC 324 : (2014) 2 SCC (L&S)
184] it was held by this Court as under:
The propositions which can be culled out from the aforementioned judgments are:
In cases of wrongful termination of service, reinstatement with continuity of service
and back wages is the normal rule.
Ordinarily, an employee or workman whose services are terminated and who is
desirous of getting back wages is required to either plead or at least make a statement
before the adjudicating authority or the
- 52 -
court of first instance that he/she was not gainfully employed or was employed on
lesser wages. If the employer wants to avoid payment of full back wages, then it has to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/8096970/ 29
Vijaya Kumar B vs The Management Of M/S Leotech on 10 April, 2023
plead and also lead cogent evidence to prove that the employee/workman was
gainfully employed and was getting wages equal to the wages he/she was drawing
prior to the termination of service. This is so because it is settled law that the burden
of proof of the existence of a particular fact lies on the person who makes a positive
averment about its existence. It is always easier to prove a positive fact than to prove
a negative fact. Therefore, once the employee shows that he was not employed, the
onus lies on the employer to specifically plead and prove that the employee was
gainfully employed and was getting the same or substantially similar emoluments.
In a number of cases, the superior courts have interfered with the award of the
primary adjudicatory authority on the premise that finalisation of litigation has taken
long time ignoring that in majority of cases the parties are not responsible for such
delays. Lack of infrastructure and manpower is the principal cause for delay in the
disposal of cases. For this the litigants cannot be blamed or penalised. It would
amount to grave injustice to an employee or workman if he is denied back wages
simply because there is long lapse of time between the termination of his service and
finality given to the order of reinstatement. The courts should bear in mind that in
most of these cases, the employer is in an advantageous position vis-à-vis the
employee or workman. He can avail the services of best legal brain for prolonging the
agony of the sufferer i.e. the employee or workman, who can ill-afford the luxury of
spending money on a lawyer with certain amount of fame. Therefore, in such cases it
would be prudent to adopt the course suggested in Hindustan Tin Works (P) Ltd. v.
Employees
- 53 -
(emphasis supplied)
33. In the present case, the respondent has made a vague submission to the extent that:
"the conduct of the workman throughout the proceedings before the High Court
during 2002 to 2011 shows that he is continuously gainfully employed somewhere.
Admittedly even in the counter-affidavit in the said writ petition, it has not been
stated that the workman was not employed."
(emphasis supplied) Therefore, on the basis of the legal principle laid down by this Court in Deepali
Gundu Surwase case [Deepali Gundu Surwase v. Kranti Junior Adhyapak Mahavidyalaya, (2013) 10
SCC 324 : (2014) 2 SCC (L&S) 184] , the submission of the respondent that the appellant did not
aver in his plaint of not being employed, does not hold since the burden of proof that the appellant is
gainfully employed post termination of his service is on the respondent. The claim of the respondent
that the appellant is gainfully employed somewhere is vague and cannot be considered and
accepted. Therefore, we hold that the appellant is entitled to full back wages from the date of
termination of his service till the date of his reinstatement.

Answer to Point (iv)
34. The present case is a clear case of violation of the constitutional principles expressly mentioned
in the text. Before we make our concluding findings and reasons, we wish to revisit Harjinder Singh
case [Harjinder Singh v. Punjab State Warehousing Corpn., (2010) 3 SCC 192 : (2010) 1 SCC (L&S)
1146] which made some pertinent points as under :
(SCC pp. 205-09, paras 22 & 27-29)
- 54 -
"22. In Y.A. Mamarde v. Authority under the Minimum Wages Act [(1972) 2 SCC
108] , this Court, while interpreting the provisions of the Minimum Wages Act, 1948,
observed : (SCC p. 116, para 13) The anxiety on the part of the society for improving
the general economic condition of some of its less favoured members appears to be in
supersession of the old principle of absolute freedom of contract and the doctrine of
laissez faire and in recognition of the new principles of social welfare and common
good. Prior to our Constitution this principle was advocated by the movement for
liberal employment in civilised countries and the Act which is a pre-Constitution
measure was the offspring of that movement. Under our present Constitution the
State is now expressly directed to endeavour to secure to all workers (whether
agricultural, industrial or otherwise) not only bare physical subsistence but a living
wage and conditions of work ensuring a decent standard of life and full enjoyment of
leisure. This directive principle of State policy being conducive to the general interest
of the nation as a whole, merely lays down the foundation for appropriate social
structure in which the labour will find its place of dignity, legitimately due to it in lieu
of its contribution to the progress of national economic prosperity.'
27. In 70s, 80s and early 90s, the courts repeatedly negated the doctrine of laissez
faire and the theory of hire and fire. In his treatise : Democracy, Equality and
Freedom, Justice Mathew wrote:
'The original concept of employment was that of master and servant. It was therefore
held that a court will not specifically enforce a contract of employment. The law has
adhered to the age-old rule that an employer may dismiss the employee at will.
Certainly, an employee can never expect to be completely free to do what he likes to
do. He must
- 55 -
face the prospect of discharge for failing or refusing to do his work in accordance with
his employer's directions. Such control by the employer over the employee is
fundamental to the employment relationship. But there are innumerable facets of the
employee's life that have little or no relevance to the employment relationship and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/8096970/ 31
Vijaya Kumar B vs The Management Of M/S Leotech on 10 April, 2023
over which the employer should not be allowed to exercise control. It is no doubt
difficult to draw a line between reasonable demands of an employer and those which
are unreasonable as having no relation to the employment itself. The rule that an
employer can arbitrarily discharge an employee with or without regard to the
actuating motive is a rule settled beyond doubt. But the rule became settled at a time
when the words "master" and "servant" were taken more literally than they are now
and when, as in early Roman Law, the rights of the servant, like the rights of any
other member of the household, were not his own, but those of his paterfamilias. The
overtones of this ancient doctrine are discernible in the judicial opinion which
rationalised the employer's absolute right to discharge the employee. Such a
philosophy of the employer's dominion over his employee may have been in tune
with the rustic simplicity of bygone days. But that philosophy is incompatible with
these days of large, impersonal, corporate employers. The conditions have now vastly
changed and it is difficult to regard the contract of employment with large-scale
industries and government enterprises conducted by bodies which are created under
special statutes as mere contract of personal service. Where large number of people
are unemployed and it is extremely difficult to find employment, an employee who is
discharged from service might have to remain without means of subsistence for a
considerably long time and damages in the shape of wages for a certain period may
not be an adequate compensation to the employee for non-employment. In other
words,
- 56 -
damages would be a poor substitute for reinstatement. The traditional rule has
survived because of the sustenance it received from the law of contracts. From the
contractual principle of mutuality of obligation, it was reasoned that if the employee
can quit his job at will, then so too must the employer have the right to terminate the
relationship for any or no reason. And there are a number of cases in which even
contracts for permanent employment i.e. for indefinite terms, have been held
unenforceable on the ground that they lack mutuality of obligation. But these cases
demonstrate that mutuality is a high-sounding phrase of little use as an analytical
tool and it would seem clear that mutuality of obligation is not an inexorable
requirement and that lack of mutuality is simply, as many courts have come to
recognise, an imperfect way of referring to the real obstacle to enforcing any kind of
contractual limitation on the employer's right of discharge i.e. lack of consideration.
If there is anything in contract law which seems likely to advance the present inquiry,
it is the growing tendency to protect individuals from contracts of adhesion from
overreaching terms often found in standard forms of contract used by large
commercial establishments. Judicial disfavour of contracts of adhesion has been said
to reflect the assumed need to protect the weaker contracting part against the
harshness of the common law and the abuses of freedom of contract. The same
philosophy seems to provide an appropriate answer to the argument, which still
seems to have some vitality, that the servant cannot complain, as he takes the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/8096970/ 32
Vijaya Kumar B vs The Management Of M/S Leotech on 10 April, 2023
employment on the terms which are offered to him.'
28. In Govt. Branch Press v. D.B. Belliappa [(1979) 1 SCC 477 : 1979 SCC (L&S) 39] ,
the employer invoked the theory of hire and fire by contending that the respondent's
appointment was purely temporary and his service could be terminated at
- 57 -
any time in accordance with the terms and conditions of appointment which he had
voluntarily accepted. While rejecting this plea as wholly misconceived, the Court
observed : (SCC p. 486, para 25) '25. ... It is borrowed from the archaic common law
concept that employment was a matter between the master and servant only. In the
first place, this rule in its original absolute form is not applicable to government
servants. Secondly, even with regard to private employment, much of it has passed
into the fossils of time. "This rule held the field at the time when the master and
servant were taken more literally than they are now and when, as in early Roman law,
the rights of the servant, like the rights of any other member of the household, were
not his own, but those of his paterfamilias." The overtones of this ancient doctrine are
discernible in the Anglo- American jurisprudence of the 18th century and the first
half of the 20th century, which rationalised the employer's absolute right to discharge
the employee. "Such a philosophy", as pointed out by K.K. Mathew, J. (vide his
treatise : Democracy, Equality and Freedom, p. 326), "of the employer's dominion
over his employee may have been in tune with the rustic simplicity of bygone days.
But that philosophy is incompatible with these days of large, impersonal, corporate
employers." To bring it in tune with vastly changed and changing socio-economic
conditions and mores of the day, much of this old, antiquated and unjust doctrine has
been eroded by judicial decisions and legislation, particularly in its application to
persons in public employment, to whom the constitutional protection of Articles 14,
15, 16 and 311 is available. The argument is therefore overruled.'
29. The doctrine of laissez faire was again rejected in Glaxo Laboratories (I) Ltd. v.
Presiding Officer
- 58 -
[(1984) 1 SCC 1 : 1984 SCC (L&S) 42] , in the following words : (SCC p. 9, para 12) '12.
In the days of laissez faire when industrial relation was governed by the harsh
weighted law of hire and fire the management was the supreme master, the
relationship being referable to contract between unequals and the action of the
management treated almost sacrosanct. The developing notions of social justice and
the expanding horizon of socio- economic justice necessitated statutory protection to
the unequal partner in the industry, namely, those who invest blood and flesh against
those who bring in capital. Moving from the days when whim of the employer was
suprema lex, the Act took a modest step to compel by statute the employer to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/8096970/ 33
Vijaya Kumar B vs The Management Of M/S Leotech on 10 April, 2023
prescribe minimum conditions of service subject to which employment is given. The
Act was enacted as its long title shows to require employers in industrial
establishments to define with sufficient precision the conditions of employment
under them and to make the said conditions known to workmen employed by them.
The movement was from status to contract, the contract being not left to be
negotiated by two unequal persons but statutorily imposed. If this socially beneficial
Act was enacted for ameliorating the conditions of the weaker partner, conditions of
service prescribed thereunder must receive such interpretation as to advance the
intendment underlying the Act and defeat the mischief.'"
35. We therefore conclude and hold that the Labour Court was correct on legal and factual principles
in reinstating the appellant along with full back wages after setting aside the order of termination.
The High Court, on the other hand, has erred by exceeding its jurisdiction under Article 227 of the
Constitution of India in holding that the appellant has in fact, resigned by not joining his duty as a
Badli worker and also awarding that retrenchment compensation
- 59 -
to the tune of Rs 1,00,000 will do justice to the appellant without assigning reasons which is wholly
unsustainable in law.
9.14. Relying on the above, he submits that the workmen having been engaged at the workplace of
the employer for a long period of time, the works which have been carried out by the workmen being
perennial in nature, the employer of the workmen could not have been discharged by terminating
the contract of the contractor. In such case, the requirement of Section 25-F of the I.D. Act is
required to be followed. Without doing so, any termination would be bad in law entitling the
workmen to be reinstated with all consequential benefits.
The employer cannot by relying upon the doctrine of laissez faire contend that it will do as it pleases
and terminate the workmen who have been working for a long period of time.
- 60 -
9.15. On the basis of the above, he submits that the contract entered into by the employer with the
contractor being a sham document, the real employer being the employer and not the contractor,
the termination of the service of the workmen under the guise of termination of the labour contract
is impermissible. The workmen apart from being reinstated are required to be awarded back wages.
10. Heard Sri.Anand.K.R, learned counsel for the employer and Sri.A.J.Srinivasan, learned counsel
for the workmen. Perused papers.
11. The points that arise for determination are:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/8096970/ 34
Vijaya Kumar B vs The Management Of M/S Leotech on 10 April, 2023
1. Whether the labour Court would be justified to examine whether a labour contract
is a sham or camouflage in all cases where a reference is made as regards termination
of services of contract labour, or would the labour Court be restricted by the terms of
reference and be ineligible to examine the genuineness or the validity of a labour
contract?
- 61 -
2. In the event of the labour contract being held to be a sham and camouflage, would the workmen,
as a matter of right be entitled to reinstatement, continuity of service, and consequent benefits,
including full back wages?
3. Whether the award passed by the labour Court suffers from any legal infirmity requiring
interference at the hands of this Court?
4. What Order?
12. I answer the above points as under:
13. ANSWER TO POINT NO.1: Whether the labour Court would be justified to examine whether a
labour contract is a sham or camouflage in all cases where a reference is made as regards
termination of services of contract labour, or would the labour Court be restricted by the terms of
reference and be ineligible to examine the genuineness or the validity of a labour contract?
13.1. The contention of Sri.K.R.Anand, learned counsel for the employer is that the Labour Court has
travelled beyond the reference.
Unless there being any reference made as regards whether the agreement entered into between the
employer and the contractor being
- 62 -
a sham transaction, the Labour Court could not have ventured into this aspect and pronounce on the
same, which could not have been done and therefore, is contrary to the Judgments of the Hon'ble
Apex Court in the cases of Oshiar Prasad, Sindhu Resettlement Corporation Limited, Jaipur Udyog
Ltd and Delhi Cloth and General Mills co. Ltd.
13.2. In the present matter, the employer claims that the workers were engaged by and were
employees of the contractor, whereas the workers claim that though they were employees of the
contractor, they were under the day-to-
day supervision and instructions of the employer and as such, the contractor was not their
employer. The employer had made use of the methodology of appointing a contractor to reduce its
financial burden inasmuch as the employer is paying Rs.76/- per day to the workmen on its rolls,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/8096970/ 35
Vijaya Kumar B vs The Management Of M/S Leotech on 10 April, 2023
whereas Rs.56/- is paid
- 63 -
insofar as the contract employees were concerned. This amount of Rs.56/- per day is inclusive of the
amounts payable to the contractor, it is in that background that upon the termination of the contract
of the contractor resulted in the denial of employment to the workers engaged through the
contractor that a dispute was raised which went through conciliation and failed and thereafter
referred to the industrial tribunal by the appropriate government.
13.3. It is that background that it is required to be considered by this Court while answering the
above question. The reference being made as regards a few of the workmen, the appropriate
government referred the matter on the points of reference viz., whether the refusal of employment
to the workmen was proper or not? What is the compensation to be paid to such workmen? The
main question which had
- 64 -
been referred to was whether the workmen were to establish that they were employed by the
employer?
13.4. What is not in dispute is that the workmen were engaged by the contractor, in furtherance of
which the workmen were discharging their duties at the factory of the employer. The only question
is whether the workmen were directly working with the employer or for the contractor?
13.5. The evidence on record which has been dealt with by the labour Court categorically indicates
that the instructions were being issued by the employer, the targets were set by the employer and it
is only the supply of labour which was made by the contractor to the employer. The aspect of
determining whether the workmen were employees of the employer or that of the contractor would
therefore require examination of the contract between the employer and the
- 65 -
contractor in order to come to a decision on the above point. Thus, unless the contract is one which
cannot be said to be sham or camouflage, the workmen would continue to be those engaged by the
contractor and not by the employer. However, if the contract is said to be sham and camouflage a
conclusion could be arrived at that the workmen were employees of the employer. Thus this aspect
of whether the contract was sham and camouflage is in my considered opinion an integral part of
the question to determine whether the aggrieved workmen were the direct employees of the
employer or the contractor. Thus, the decision relied upon by Sri.K.R.Anand in Sindhu Resettlement
Corpn. Ltd's case (supra6) that unless the issue was specifically raised before the government and
the government referred the same to the Industrial Tribunal, the
- 66 -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/8096970/ 36
Vijaya Kumar B vs The Management Of M/S Leotech on 10 April, 2023
Tribunal cannot advert to the same would not be applicable.
13.6. Similarly, the decisions in Jaipur Udyog Ltd.
(supra7), Delhi Cloth & General Mills Co.
Ltd. (supra8), which have been pressed into service to contend that the present workers being the
workmen employed by the contractor, those workmen could not raise the dispute against the
present employer are not applicable since the contract is a sham and camouflage. The decision in
Oshiar Prasad's case (supra1) relied upon by Sri.K.R.Anand that a labour contract having been
terminated, the workmen could not seek for regularization would also not be applicable since the
very termination of the contract appears to be for the purpose of getting rid of the contract labour
who have been working in perennial jobs for a long time with the employer.
- 67 -
13.7. The decision in Mahendra Prasad Jakhmola's case (supra2) relied upon by the learned counsel
to contend that mere supervision would not make a contract worker, a worker of the employer is not
applicable for the reason that in the present case, it is not just supervision, but also allotment of
work fixing of targets for each of the contract workmen was made by the employer. Whether the
salary is paid directly by the principal employer to the workmen or through contractor, in my
considered opinion, would not make much of a difference if the engagement of the workmen is made
through a contractor as a camouflage. It is only when a contractor has been hired who in turn
deputes workmen for a specific period of time to conduct non-perennial work, that the decision in
Bharatlals' case (supra4) relied upon by Sri.K.R.Anand would be applicable and not in a situation
where a workmen having been
- 68 -
engaged for a long period of time though a contractor to provide services for the employer.
13.8. The last contention of Sri.K.R.Anand in this regard is that so long as the contract labour is
permitted and there is no embargo under Section 10 of the CLRA, any employer can make use of
contract labour and that labour cannot seek for regularization is also in my considered opinion not a
proposition to be applied to the present case.
13.9. The engagement of contract labour being permitted merely on account of no prohibition under
Section 10 of CLRA being made would not entitle an employer to use the said process for its own
benefit in reducing its burden and or depriving the workmen of their just wages. In the event of a
notification under Section 10 being issued, it is very clear that no contract labour could be used. If
any workmen are engaged through a contractor then they would
- 69 -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/8096970/ 37
Vijaya Kumar B vs The Management Of M/S Leotech on 10 April, 2023
get the preference for being considered for appointment as and when there is a vacancy which
arises. Even otherwise, though no notification under Section 10 is issued if the employer were to
terminate a contract with a contractor and the employer were to engage new labour, it would be the
duty of the employer to provide employment to those workmen as and when vacancy arises, as also
for the employer not to engage any other workmen other than the contract workers for the said post
without offering the same to the contract workers. Thus, whether a notification is issued under
Section 10 of CLRA or not, the right of the workmen to raise industrial dispute of they being denied
work would still continue.
13.10. The Judgments relied upon by Sri.A.J.Srinivasan in the case of National Union Waterfront
Workers (supra10) and Vinod Kumar Sharma (supra11) would be applicable inasmuch as if
- 70 -
the contract is found to be not genuine but a mere camouflage, the so-called contract labour will
have to be treated as employees of the principal employer and this determination would be a
preliminary determination for the purpose of adjudicating the dispute between the principal
employer and the workmen.
13.11. Considering the above, I answer point No.1 by holding that the labour Court would be justified
to examine whether the labour contract is a sham and camouflage in all cases where references are
made as regards termination of service of contract labour since this would be a preliminary question
to be answered before examining whether the termination is proper or not, whether the denial of
work is proper or not and thereafter to examine whether the workmen have to be reinstated or not.
14. ANSWER TO POINT NO.2: In the event of the labour contract being held to be a sham and
camouflage, would the workmen, as a matter of
- 71 -
right be entitled to reinstatement, continuity of service, and consequent benefits, including full back
wages?
14.1. Whenever a labour contract is held to be sham and camouflage, the workman who is denied
work by either termination of the contract with the contractor or by termination of services of the
workman himself, on a dispute being raised, the labour Court would have to consider whether such
workman would be entitled for reinstatement, continuity of service, consequential benefits including
full backwages or not. There is no strict rule applicable to this nor is a straight jacket formula
applicable.
These aspects would have to be considered by the labour Court on merits of individual cases.
14.2. In the event of a labour contract being held to be sham and camouflage, there would be a right
vested with the workmen to be offered employment. In the event of the employer
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/8096970/ 38
Vijaya Kumar B vs The Management Of M/S Leotech on 10 April, 2023
- 72 -
seeking to engage any other person for the very same job or engaging another contractor to deliver
the same services by engaging contract labour, until and unless such action is sought to be taken by
the employer, there is no vested right in the workmen to be reinstated automatically. But the aspect
of whether the workmen would be entitled for reinstatement, continuity of service and
consequential benefits, being dependent on the above the factual matrix would have to be
determined by the labour court before ordering any of the above.
15. ANSWER TO POINT NO.3: Whether the award passed by the labour Court suffers from any legal
infirmity requiring interference at the hands of this Court?
15.1. As regards awardal of back wages, the labour Court has * denied full back wages to the
workmen, I am of the considered opinion that the said order meets ends of justice. Though the
workmen *Deleted vide Court order dated 06.06.2023
- 73 -
were prevented from discharging their work on account of the stand taken by the employer, the fact
remains that the workmen have not carried out any work for the employer and the employer has not
derived any benefits from the said workers. Thus, *denial of back wages, in my considered opinion,
would in the present case serve the interest of justice.
15.2. In view of my answer to Points NO.1 and 2, the labour Court having rightly come to a
conclusion that the labour contract entered into to reduce the burden of the employer, the workmen
being supervised by the employer, the targets being set by the employer, the workmen reporting to
the employer rather than the contractor having been taken into consideration by the labour Court in
a proper perspective, I am of the considered opinion that the said order does not suffer from any
legal *Replaced vide Court order dated 06.06.2023
- 74 -
infirmity requiring interference at the hands of this Court.
16. ANSWER TO POINT NO.4: What order?
16.1. In view of the above, I pass the following:
ORDER i. The writ petition filed by the employer in W.P. No.31261/2016 challenging
the impugned award dated 18.02.2016 passed by the Prl. Labour Court, Bangalore in
Reference No.14/2012 stands dismissed.
ii. The writ petition filed by the workmen in W.P.No.57652/2017 seeking for
modification of the award by granting full back wages is also dismissed.
