Spl.C.C.No.135/2013 (R.C.No.15-A/2012) ANALYSIS:-
9. The petitioner is stated to be a Forest Officer of I.F.S. Cadre and was discharging
duty as Deputy Conservator of Forests, Bellary Division at the relevant point of time.
The directions by the Apex Court in its order of 07.09.2012 was to investigate cases
relating to alleged illegal extraction of 50.79 lakh Metric Tons of Iron Ore from the
forest areas between 01.01.2009 to 31.05.2010 and its illegal transportation to the
Belekere Port.
Subsequent to the Order of the Apex Court dated 07.09.20122, investigation was conducted, charge
sheet was filed and cognizance was taken by the learned Special Judge. Thereafter the
petitioner/accused has sought for Samaj Parivartana Samudaya (supra) quashing of proceedings
and the charge sheet and also called in question the validity of the orders on validity of sanction for
prosecution.
I. VALIDITY OF ORDER OF SANCTION FOR PROSECUTION:-
10. The petitioner has assailed the order dated 05.05.2020 passed by the learned
Special Judge as detailed in the Table supra at para 8 whereby, the Sanction orders
issued by the State Government and Central Government according Sanction under
Code of Criminal Procedure, Karnataka Forest Act and Prevention of Corruption Act
respectively to prosecute the petitioner/accused has been upheld.
However, it is the contention of the petitioner that Sanction has not been granted by the Competent
Authority.
The petitioner further contends that the whole process was conducted in a mechanical manner, that
the Authorities concerned have only appended the word "approved", and that the sanctioning
authority has merely endorsed the draft sanction order submitted by the Investigating Authority. It
was also contended that necessary material was not placed before the Authority which granted
Sanction thus vitiating the order passed.
A. AUTHORITY COMPETENT TO GRANT SANCTION FOR PROSECUTION:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91788375/ 11
Sri.S. Muthaiah vs State on 4 August, 2023
A.1. SANCTION FOR PROSECUTION UNDER SECTION 197 OF CR.P.C. AS
REGARDS OFFENCES UNDER IPC
11. The admitted facts being that petitioner Sri S. Muthaiah was an I.F.S. Officer
[(IFS)(KN-1995)] and was working as Deputy Conservator of Forests, Bellary
territorial division from 18.07.2008 to 19.05.20103.
12. Insofar as offences under IPC are concerned, Section 197 of Cr.P.C. mandates
obtaining of sanction and relevant extract is as hereunder:-
"197. Prosecution of Judges and public servants.--(1) When any person who is or was
a Judge or Magistrate or a public servant not removable from his office save by or
with the sanction of the Government is accused of any Details as found in order
granting sanction from Government of Karnataka dated 07.08.2013 offence alleged
to have been committed by him while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of
his official duty, no Court shall take cognizance of such offence except with the
previous sanction save as otherwise provided in the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act,
2013--
(a) xxx
(b) in the case of a person who is employed or, as the case may be, was at the time of
commission of the alleged offence employed, in connection with the affairs of a State,
of the State Government:..."
13. The FIR makes out a case that in light of the findings of the CEC and Lokayukta of Karnataka
that various Mining Companies, viz., M/s.Dream Logistics Co., India Ltd.; M/s.ILC Industries, M/s.
S.B.Logistics, M/s. Shree Mallikarjun Shipping Pvt. Ltd., have indulged in illegal mining in the
forest areas of Bellary, Bilekere and other places of Karnataka and transported such illegally mined
Iron Ore without valid permits issued by the Department of Mines and Geology as also the
Department of Forests without payment of required royalty and Forest Development Tax. Such acts,
it is stated to have been done in connivance and in conspiracy with petitioner, the then Deputy
Conservator of Forest Bellary, and his subordinates. It is alleged that the accused have caused
wrongful loss to the Government of Karnataka and corresponding gain to themselves.
Clearly, the above information contained in the FIR would indicate alleged commission of offence by
the accused while being posted as a Deputy Conservator of Forest, Bellary. The petitioner being an
I.F.S. Officer, "was at the time of commission of the alleged offence employed, in connection with
the affairs of a State, of the State Government."4
14. The Circular issued by the Government of India, Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and
Pensions, Department of Personnel and Training dated 27.10.1999 addressed to the Chief
Secretaries of all State Governments though deals with sanction for prosecution under the P.C. Act
against I.A.S. Officers, also adverts to sanction as Section 197(1)(b) of Cr.P.C.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91788375/ 12
Sri.S. Muthaiah vs State on 4 August, 2023
regards such Officers when discharging official duties in connection with the affairs of the State
Government, which affirms the legal position as contained under Section 197 of Cr.P.C. The relevant
portion of the said Circular at para-2 reads as follows:-
"2. ... If such a member of the All India Service is or was serving in connection with
the affairs of the State Government, such sanction u/s 197(1) of the Cr.P.C. for the
IPC offences will be required to be accorded by the State Government concerned."
15. As the petitioner was employed in connection with the affairs of the State Government at the
time of alleged commission of offence, under Section 197(b) of Cr.P.C., previous sanction of the
State Government is required.
16. In the present case, sanction of the State Government has been obtained as regards the alleged
offence under Section 197 of Cr.P.C. as follows:-
W.P.No.19179/2021 W.P.No.19178/2021 W.P.No.19176/2021 W.P.No.19163/2021

17. Section 197 (1)(b) of Cr.P.C. which is applicable in the present factual matrix provides for
sanction of the State Government. The term 'State Government' is not defined in the Cr.P.C. and we
need to fall back on the provision under the Karnataka General Clauses Act of 1899, which defines
'State Government' as follows:-
"3(38c) "State Government",-
xxx
(c) as respect anything done or to be done after 1st November, 1973 shall mean the
Governor of the State of Karnataka;
18. It is also necessary to look into the provisions of the Karnataka Government (Transaction of
Business) Rules, 1977 and in particular, Rule 18 and 19 and relevant extracts are as follows:-
"18. All orders or instruments made or executed by or on behalf of Government shall
be expressed to be made or executed in the name of the Governor of Karnataka
19. Orders and instruments made and executed in the name of the Governor of
Karnataka, shall be authenticated by the signature of an Additional Chief Secretary, a
Principal Secretary, a Secretary, a Special Secretary, an Additional Secretary a Joint

Secretary, a Deputy Secretary, an Under Secretary, a Desk Officer or any other officer
holding these posts on ex-officio basis or by such other officer as may be specially
empowered in that behalf by the Governor in the manner specified below, and such
signature shall be deemed to be the proper authentication of such order or
instrument.
By Order and in the name of the Governor of Karnataka, (Signature) Name and
designation of the Officer authorized to sign
19. Accordingly, where the sanction is required of the State Government, the order would be by the
Governor of State of Karnataka5 and in terms of the Transaction of 3(38c) of the Karnataka General
Clauses Act, 1899 Business Rules6, the order in the name of the Governor shall be authenticated by
the Officers referred to under Rule 19 of the Rules which includes the 'Under Secretary'. In the
present case, the sanction orders as per the Table above, have been passed in the following manner:-
"BY ORDER AND IN THE NAME OF THE GOVERNOR OF KARNATAKA SD/-
(Dr.BAGADI GAUTHAM) DEPUTY SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT DP & AR
(SERVICES)"
20. Accordingly, the order passed is in complete compliance with the provisions of Karnataka
General Clauses Act, 1899 and the Karnataka Government (Transaction of Business) Rules 1977 and
no ground is made for interference with such order.
21. The contention of the petitioner that sanction for prosecution even under Section 197 of Cr.P.C.
must be obtained from the appointing and removal authority, i.e. the President, whose power stands
delegated in terms of Karnataka Government (Transaction of Business) Rules, 1977 the Transaction
of Business Rules is liable to be rejected in light of the plain words in Section 197 of Cr.P.C. which
indicates that sanction is to be obtained from the State Government where the person is employed
"in connection with the affairs of the State".
A.2. SANCTION FOR PROSECUTION UNDER SECTION 19 OF P.C. ACT
22. In the present case, sanction of the Central Government has been obtained as regards the
offence under Section 19 of the P.C. Act as follows:-
W.P.No.19179/2021 W.P.No.19178/2021 W.P.No.19176/2021 W.P.No.19163/2021

23. Under Section 19 of P.C. Act, no Court can take cognizance "except with previous sanction" of
the appropriate Government. Relevant extract of Section 19 reads as follows:-
"19. Previous sanction necessary for prosecution.--(1) No court shall take cognizance
of an offence punishable under sections 7, 11, 13 and 15 alleged to have been
committed by a public servant, except with the previous sanction save as otherwise
provided in the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013--
(a) in the case of a person who is employed, or as the case may be, was at the time of
commission of the alleged offence employed in connection with the affairs of the
Union and is not removable from his office save by or with the sanction of the Central
Government, of that Government;
(b) in the case of a person who is employed, or as the case may be, was at the time of
commission of the alleged offence employed in connection with the affairs of a State
and is not removable from his office save by or with the sanction of the State
Government, of that Government;
(c) xxx (2) Where for any reason whatsoever any doubt arises as to whether the
previous sanction as required under sub-section (1) should be given by the Central
Government or the State Government or any other authority, such sanction shall be
given by that Government or authority which would have been competent to remove
the public servant from his office at the time when the offence was alleged to have
been committed."
24. In the present case, as admittedly the petitioner is employed in connection with the affairs of the
State and as he is an Officer of I.F.S. Cadre, the test to be answered in order to ascertain the
'Authority competent' to grant sanction would be "that Government or Authority which would have
been competent to remove the Public Servant from his Office at the time when offence was alleged
to have been committed."7
25. It is to be noticed that Rule 6 of the Indian Forest Service (Recruitment) Rules, 1966 deals with
the appointment into the Indian Forest Service and relevant extract of Rule 6 is as follows:
"6. Appointment to the Service.- 6(1) All appointment to the Service shall be made by
the Central Government and no such appointment shall be made except after
recruitment by one of the methods specified in rule 4."
Section 19(2) of the PC Act
26. Accordingly, an Officer of I.F.S. Cadre being appointed by the Central Government as
enumerated under Rule 6 of the Indian Forest Service (Recruitment) Rules, 1966, his removal would
also be by the same Authority and accordingly, sanction for prosecution under the P.C. Act would be
of the Central Government.

27. In the absence of any definition of 'Central Government' in the P.C. Act, we have to fall back
upon the definition under the General Clauses Act, 1897 and the relevant extract of Section 3(8)(b)
reads as follows:-
"(8) "Central Government" shall,--
(a) xxx
(b) in relation to anything done or to be done after the commencement of the
Constitution, mean the President; and shall include,--
xxx"
28. The orders of the President in terms of Article 77 of the Constitution of India8 are to be made
and executed in "77. Conduct of business of the Government of India.-- (1) All executive action of the
Government of India shall be expressed to be taken in the name of the President.
the name of the President and the authenticated as may be specified in the Rules.
29. In terms of Article 77 of the Constitution of India, the Rules framed are 'Authentication (Orders
and Other Instruments) Rules, 2002'. Rule 2(1) refers to the mode of authentication as follows:-
"(2) They shall come into force on the date of their publication in the official gazette.
All orders and other instruments made and executed in the name of the President
shall be authenticated -
(1) by the signature of a Secretary,
Special Secretary, Additional Secretary, Joint

30. In the present case, the order of sanction as detailed supra have been passed by the Joint
Secretary to (2) Orders and other instruments made and executed in the name of the President shall
be authenticated in such manner as may be specified in rules to be made by the President, and the
validity of an order or instrument which is so authenticated shall not be called in question on the
ground that it is not an order or instrument made or executed by the President. (3) xxx"

Sri.S. Muthaiah vs State on 4 August, 2023
31. Accordingly, the sanction has been granted by the Competent Authority in terms of the Rules
and statutory provisions as noticed above.
32. Though the trial Court has not adverted to the aspect in as much detail, however, the conclusion
arrived at by the trial Court is correct and does not call for interference.
A.3. SANCTION AS REGARDS OFFENCES UNDER THE KARNATAKA FOREST ACT, 1963
33. In the present case, sanction of the State Government has been obtained as regards the offence
under Section 114A of the Karnataka Forest Act as follows:-
W.P.No.19179/2021 W.P.No.19178/2021 W.P.No.19176/2021 W.P.No.19163/2021

Forest Karnataka Forest Karnataka Forest Act Act Act Act
34. Insofar as the aspect of sanction for offences under the Karnataka Forest Act, Section 114A
provides that prosecution shall not be entertained "except with the previous sanction of the State
Government." Relevant extract of Section 114A is as follows:
"114A. Suits or prosecution in respect of acts done under colour of duty not to be
entertained without sanction of the State Government.- (1) In any case of alleged
offence or of wrong alleged to have been committed by any Forest Officer, by any act
done under colour or in excess of any such duty or authority under this Act, or
wherein it shall appear to the court that offence if committed was of the character
aforesaid the prosecution or suit shall not be entertained except with the previous
sanction of the State Government."
35. The interpretation of 'State Government' would be in terms of the discussion made as regards
sanction for prosecution under Section 197 of Cr.P.C. (see para19).
36. The sanction in the present case has been granted by the signatory in the following manner:-
"BY ORDER AND IN THE NAME OF THE GOVERNOR OF KARNATAKA SD/-
(DR.BAGADI GAUTHAM) DEPUTY SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, DP & AR
(SERVICES)"
The sanction granted in the aforementioned manner is in accordance with the requirements of the
applicable law.

detailed order and referred to the evidence of PW.32 and in specific, has observed regarding the

"... But this PW.1 has stated that placing of materials is reflected in the note-sheet
being prepared by his office. He says that he has personally gone through the said
statement of the witnesses which have been recorded by the investigating officer. So
also he has gone through the document collected by the I.O. before issuing the
sanction orders."

copied by the Central Government, the learned Special Judge has observed as follows:-
"When the facts are similar in this case, therefore, we cannot find any fault in
preparing the draft sanction order."
Such conclusion arrived at cannot be faulted and does not call for interference.

52. A perusal of Ex.P69 indicates that it contains the final report of the CBI dated 24.05.2013 in
RC.No.15A/2012. It is further stated that along with the report, CBI had forwarded ten bundles of
connected records. The note sheet in the file refers to the role of Sri S.Muthaiah/petitioner and

58. Insofar as the challenge to the order granting sanction by the State Government, the learned
Special Judge has noticed the evidence of PW.33 wherein, Dr.Bagadi Gautam has deposed that the
entire file prepared in his office marked as Ex.P69 was sent to the office of Chief Minister, after
perusal of which sanction was accorded by the Chief Minister. The learned Special Judge at para-38
of the order has referred to presumption with regard to official acts while discussing the attacks as
regards to procedure that was required to be followed by the officials.
59. While referring to the contention that the order of sanction sent to the Central Government and
the order of sanction of the State Government are replicas of the draft orders sent by the
Investigating Authority, which vitiates the order passed granting sanction on the ground of
non-application of mind, the learned Special Judge observes as follows:-
"40. ...When facts are similar and the competent responsible officer has prepared the
order after going through the records, this defence, of the accused persons about the
imitation of the draft sanction order, etc., becomes a week (sic) defence. As stated
supra, when the facts are similar we cannot expect any change in the sanction order
to that of the draft sanction order. The draft sanction order may be a guidance to
prepare the valid sanction order..."
Such conclusion of the learned Special Judge also does not call for interference.
60. Insofar as the contention that Chief Minister merely stated as "C£ÀÄªÉÆÃ¢¹zÉ" ('approved')
and accordingly, there is no application of mind, the learned Special Judge observes as follows:
"41. ...Only because such words have been used by the sanctioning authority, it does
not mean that the entire business transaction of the Government is a futile exercise.
No bias is alleged against any of the sanctioning authorities in this case, to favour the
CBI or the prosecuting agency..."
The said conclusion of the learned Special Judge is also well considered and sufficient and requires
no interference.

61. The learned Special Judge has then referred to the orders granting sanction and upheld the
same. The learned Special Judge at para-47 while deciding the legality and validity of the sanction
order, has observed rightly as follows:
"47. No doubt, there are certain admissions given in the cross-examination of PW32
and 33. But we are deciding the legality and validity of the sanction order. At this
stage, we have to see that whether the sanctioning authority has applied its mind and
has issued the sanction 68 Spl.CC.135/2013 order. As laid down in the various
judgments of Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, the court cannot sit over the sanction
order and pass an order in favour of the accused persons. The guidelines which have
been set out by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India have to be followed. These
accused No.2 and 7 can very well take advantage of these admissions at the time of
final arguments in this case."
62. No doubt, the learned Special Judge has observed that the question as to whether relevant
evidence which would have tilted the balance in favour of the accused was kept out of consideration
is a matter that is to be decided in trial, is the only question that requires to be established by the
accused, which is kept open.
63. The learned Special Judge has referred to various judgments of the Apex Court including the
guidelines laid down in State of Maharashtra Through Central Bureau of Investigation v. Mahesh G.
Jain9 [Mahesh G. Jain], wherein it is observed that the adequacy of material placed before the
sanctioning authority cannot be gone into by the Court, as it does not sit in appeal over the sanction
order. The learned Special Judge observes that order of sanction ought not to be construed in a
pedantic manner and has rejected the attack against the sanction order and the said order of learned
Special Judge being well reasoned, does not call for interference.
64. The scope of interference in attack as against the order of sanction is limited and is laid down by
the Apex Court in its various decisions and relevant extracts are reproduced below:-
(a) C.S. Krishnamurthy v. State of Karnataka10 [C.S.Krishnamurthy]-
(2013) 8 SCC 119 (2005) 4 SCC 81 "7. ...Therefore, the accused has to account for
difference between the two. The sanction itself shows that there is something to be
accounted for by the accused. When the sanction itself is very expressive, then in that
case, the argument that particular material was not properly placed before the
sanctioning authority for according sanction and the sanctioning authority has not
applied its mind becomes unsustainable. When sanction order itself is eloquent
enough, then in that case only formal evidence has to be produced by the sanctioning
authority or by any other evidence that the sanction was accorded by a competent
person with due application of mind. In the present case the learned Additional
Sessions Judge took a very narrow view that all the papers were not placed before the
court to show that there was proper application of mind by the sanctioning
authority.... Though the sanctioning authority who came in the witness box could not
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91788375/ 24
Sri.S. Muthaiah vs State on 4 August, 2023
answer some questions in cross-
examination, yet this Court held that sanction itself is eloquent read with evidence of the
sanctioning authority and the same is valid. In the present case, the facts contained in the sanction
order read with evidence of the sanctioning authority makes it clear that sanction was properly
accorded and is valid.
8. In this connection, a reference was made to a decision of the Constitution Bench in the case of
R.S. Pandit v. State of Bihar [1963 Supp (2) SCR 652 : (1964) 2 Cri LJ 65] wherein Their Lordships
after referring to a decision of the Privy Council in the case of Gokulchand Dwarkadas Morarka v. R.
[AIR 1948 PC 82 : 49 Cri LJ 261] observed as under: (SCR pp. 662-63) "Section 6 of the Act also
does not require the sanction to be given in a particular form. The principle expressed by the Privy
Council, namely that the sanction should be given in respect of the facts constituting the offence
charged equally applies to the sanction under Section 6 of the Act. In the present case all the facts
constituting the offence of misconduct with which the appellant was charged were placed before the
Government. The second principle, namely, that the facts should be referred to on the face of the
sanction and if they do not so appear, the prosecution must prove them by extraneous evidence, is
certainly sound having regard to the purpose of the requirements of a sanction."
The said judgment is an authority for the point that if the order of sanction is eloquent, that would
suffice and even in the absence of which it was open to the prosecution to supplement the
deficiencies in the order of sanction by extraneous evidence.
(b) State of Maharashtra Through CBI v. Mahesh G. Jain11 "14. From the aforesaid authorities the
following principles can be culled out:
14.1. It is incumbent on the prosecution to prove that the valid sanction has been
granted by the sanctioning authority after being satisfied that a case for sanction has
been made out.
14.2. The sanction order may expressly show that the sanctioning authority has
perused the material placed before it and, after consideration of the circumstances,
has granted sanction for prosecution.
14.3. The prosecution may prove by adducing the evidence that the material was
placed before the sanctioning authority and its satisfaction was arrived at upon
perusal of the material placed before it.
14.4. Grant of sanction is only an administrative function and the sanctioning
authority is required to prima facie reach the (2013) 8 SCC 119 satisfaction that
relevant facts would constitute the offence.
14.5. The adequacy of material placed before the sanctioning authority cannot be gone into by the
court as it does not sit in appeal over the sanction order.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91788375/ 25
Sri.S. Muthaiah vs State on 4 August, 2023
14.6. If the sanctioning authority has perused all the materials placed before it and some of them
have not been proved that would not vitiate the order of sanction.
14.7. The order of sanction is a prerequisite as it is intended to provide a safeguard to a public
servant against frivolous and vexatious litigants, but simultaneously an order of sanction should not
be construed in a pedantic manner and there should not be a hypertechnical approach to test its
validity." The above principles summarise the legal framework within which validity regarding order
of sanction is to be tested and keeping this in mind the validity of the order of sanctions in the
present case requires to be tested.
65. In light of the above, if the orders of sanction are looked into, it is clear that the same are
eloquent enough.
66. The relevant extracts of the sanction order speak for themselves and the same are extracted
hereinbelow:-
EX.P67- ORDER OF SANCTION BY CENTRAL GOVERNMENT IN REGARD TO
P.C. ACT "6. Whereas it is alleged that Shri Muthaiah, the then DCF, Bellary Division
and Shri Manoj Kumar Shukla, the then Conservator of Forests, Bellary, in collusion
with Shri G.Janardhana Reddy, the then Bellary District -in-charge Minister and his
associates, on 15th October 2008, removed the Andhra-Karnataka border forest
check post existed at Halkundi, to facilitate the illegal transportation of iron ore
without valid permits by three firms belonging to Shri Gali Janardhana Reddy and
his men."
"15. Whereas, Shri Muthaiah, the then Deputy Conservator of Forests, and Shri
Manoj Kumar Shukla, the then Conservator of Forests, Bellary, have admitted that
Halkundi check post was removed by them at the behest of Shri G.Janardhana
Reddy, the then Bellary district-in-charge Minister. Hence, Shri S. Muthiah and Shri
Manoj Kumar Shukla did misuse their official positions as government servants and
closed the Halkundi Forest Border check post with dishonest intention, in conspiracy
with Shri.G.Janardhana Reddy and thereby caused wrongful loss to the Government
of No.15011/02/2013-AVU dated 20.05.2014 Karnataka, by evading the collection of
Forest Tax at the said check post.
16. Whereas, the Karnataka Lokayuktha did conduct searches at Belekeri Port during
February/March, 2010 and seized voluminous documents, including fake Andhra
permits purported to be issued by the Department of Mines and Geology, Anantapur
and Kadappa etc. During the course of investigation, the documents seized by the
Karnataka Lokayukta that were used for transporting illegal iron ore to Belekeri Port
were collected by the CBI. The examination of the officials of DMG Anantapur and
Kadappa, Andhra Pradesh, revealed that they have not issued anypermits for
transporting iron ore from Andhra Pradesh to karnataka during 2009-10. Shri
K.Shivashankar Reddy, mine owner of M/s. K.Rajmohan Reddy Mines, Kadappa,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91788375/ 26
Sri.S. Muthaiah vs State on 4 August, 2023
have stated in their recorded statements that only on two occasions supply of about
850 Mts of iron ore in the name of M/s. Shree Manjunatheswara Minerals, Hospet,
was shown. They have supplied the said quantity of iron ore through Shri.
N.Muralidhara Reddy, Mineral Agent, working in the above referred mines. Shri N.
Muralidhara Reddy in his statement has revealed that the above mentioned mine
owners have only sold DMG permits got issued from DMG Kadappa, without actual
supply of iron ore. It has further been revealed that various Andhra permits seized by
Lokayuktha from Belekeri port were not issued by DMG Kadappa and were forged
ones. These forged Andhra permits were deposited with Belekeri port at the time of
delivery of iron ore by claiming that the material was brought from Andhra Pradesh.
The removal of Halkundi check post at Andhra-Karnataka border, helped them to
make the claim and to freely transport the illegal iron ore to Belekeri port by using
this modus operandi.
17. Whereas, Shri. S.Muthaiah and Shri Manoj Kumar Shukla in collusion with
Shri.G.Janardhana Reddy and his associates, removed the Andhra- karnataka border
check post at Halkundi in October, 2008 to facilitate illegal transportation of iron ore
without permits. They have colluded with Shri G.Janardhana Reddy and his
associates, facilitated illegal mining and transportation of iron ore in Bellary district,
enabled Sri.Janardhana Reddy and his associates to construct an approach road to
Dalmia Mines through the leasehold areas of M/s.Veeyam Mines and to do large
scale illegal mining in the Dalmia Mines in 2009-10. They have allowed Sri
Janardhana Reddy and his Associates, illegal mining, store illegally extracted iron ore
in Lakshminarayana Mines, P.K.Halli plot; SBM plot; P.K.Halli; MSPL Stockyard,
Ingalagi, Veeyam Plot, Ingalagi, Karapudi Plot, Kariganur; Swastik Plot, Bellary road,
V.Nagappa Stockyard, Kallahalli, SVK Mines and Plot, Vyasanakere, SVK Plot,
Danapur and other plots/stockyards falling under the jurisdiction of Bellary Forest
Division. Both they have conceded to the demands of Shri.G.Janardhana Reddy and
his cronies and harassed their rival mining owners, favoured the mines controlled by
Shri Janardhana Reddy. They did not take action on the reports submitted by their
subordinate officials on the illegal mining activity in the forest areas in Bellary
District, accepted illegal gratification and allowed illegal mining and transportation.
Shri Muthaiah and Shri Manoj Kumar Shukla have aided Shri Janardhana Reddy in
usurping 40-60% of iron ore from other mine owners.
18. Whereas, Shri.S.Muthaiah facilitated illegal mining and transportation of iron
ore, pressurized other mine owners, and also threatened them to comply with the
conditions put by Shri G.Janardhana Reddy with regard to sharing the iron ore
excavated from their mines.
19. Whereas, the aforesaid acts of Shri.S.Muthaiah, the then Deputy Conservator of
Forests, Bellary and others, constitute offences punishable under section 120-B r/w
409, 420, 434, 447, 468, 471 of IPC and Sections 13(2) r/w 13(1)(d) of Prevention of

offences made out from the facts mentioned above.
21. Now, therefore, the President of India thus hereby accord sanction as required
under Section 197 Cr.P.C. and 19(1)(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (Act
No.49 of 1988) for the prosecution of Shri S. Muthaiah, IFS, KN:95, the then Deputy

18. That, Shri S. Muthaiah, to facilitate illegal mining and transportation of iron ore was
pressurizing other mine owners. He was also threatening them to comply with the conditions put by
Shri Gali Janardhana Reddy in respect of sharing of iron ore excavated from their mines.

collected during the course of investigation by the CBI in RC-15 (A)/2012/CBI/ACB/Bangalore
which were placed before it in regard to the said allegations, consider that a prima-facie case has
been made out against the said Sri.S.Muthaiah the then Deputy Conservator of Forests, Bellary
presently under suspension that he should be prosecuted for the above said offences.
21. Now, therefore, the Government of Karnataka do hereby accord sanction under section 114-A of
the Karnataka Forest Act, 1963 for the prosecution of Shri S. Muthaiah, the then Deputy
Conservator of Forests, Bellary, in a court of law for the aforesaid offences and for taking cognizance
of the said offences by the court of competent jurisdiction."
EX.P69(h) - SANCTION BY THE STATE GOVERNMENT AS REGARDS OFFENCES UNDER IPC
"Whereas, the Central Bureau of Investigation, Anti Corruption Branch, Bangalore has investigated
in detail into the above said allegations G.O. No.DPAR 117 SFP 2013, Bangalore dated 7.8.13 in
RC.15(A)/2012/CBI/ACB/BLR. The CBI has examined the witnesses and Government officials and
scanned documents in connection with the above said allegations during the course of investigation.
Whereas, the investigation by the CBI-ACB Bangalore, has brought forth enough evidence against
Sri.S.Muthaiah, IFS(KN-1995) former DCF, Bellary district, Bellary with regard to the allegations
made against him, listed as below:
a) Sri.S.Muthaiah, IFS the then DCF, Bellary in collusion with others abused his
official position and with deliberate intention to extend undue favour to
M/s.Obalapuram Mining Company and omitted to collect the exchange fee.
b) Removed Andhra Karnataka border check-post at Halkundi to facilitate illegal
transportation of iron ore without valid permits by 3 firms of Gali Janardhana Reddy
and his men. Transferred staff deployed at Halkundi Check-post without
replacement. Thus the checking of vehicles carrying illegal iron ore and issuance of
form No.29 and collection of forest tax were stopped with dishonest 64 intention to
facilitate Sri.G.Janardhana Reddy and his associates in the transportation of illegal
iron ore through the check-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91788375/ 29
Sri.S. Muthaiah vs State on 4 August, 2023
post and caused wrongful loss to Government of Karnataka by evading collection of the tax at the
said check-post.
c) By abusing his official position he helped M/s. OMC Company owned by G.Janardhana Reddy to
transport their illegal iron ore freely without any permits or any checking. Withdrew the services of
forest guards and foresters deployed at Halkundi Check Post and transferred them to their
respective parent places.
Whereas, the said acts of Sri. S.Muthaiah, IFS constitute offences punishable under sections 120-B
r/w 409, 420, 434, 447, 468, 471 of Indian Penal Code 1860 and u/s 13(2) r/w 13(1)(c) & (d) of PC
Act 1988.
Whereas, the Government of Karnataka after due and careful examination of the materials such as
copy of the FIR, statements of witnesses and the accused and related documents etc., collected
during the course of investigation by the CBI-ACB in RC- 15(A)/2012/CBI/ACB BLR and also the
defence statement of Sri.S.Muthaiah, IFS, which were placed before it in regard to the said
allegations and circumstances of the case and on subjective 65 examination of the materials and
having prima-facie, objectively satisfied and considered that it is a fit case to accord sanction to
prosecute Sri.S.Muthaiah, in a Court of Law for the above said offences.
Now, therefore, the Government of Karnataka by the powers vested with it under section 197(1) of
Cr.P.C 1973 hereby accords sanction to the CBI for the prosecution of Sri S.Muthaiah, IFS
(KN-1995), former Deputy Conservator of Forests, Bellary, for the aforesaid offences punishable
under Sections 120-B r/w 409, 420, 434, 447, 468, 471 of the Indian Penal Code 1860."
67. Insofar as the contention that insufficient materials having been placed before the Authority as
noticed above, communication has been addressed by the CBI to the State Government producing

68. It is noticed that the said report is exhaustive and contains all materials. In fact, the note sheet of
the file marked as Ex.P69 recites that the CBI has not only sent the final report dated 24.05.2013 in
RC.15A/2012- CBI/ACB/BLR against the petitioner but have also sent "along with the report CBI
has forwarded 10 bundles of connected records which are kept in safe custody in the section".
69. Further, when the State Government has forwarded the sanction orders to the Central
Government, all material that was before it has been sent which includes the volume of 10 boxes of
papers as is evident from the letter dated 14.08.2013. The description of 10 boxes is as follows:-

Volume 91 to 101
70. The contention that certain materials were not placed before the Authority is liable to be
rejected, as the Authority in the orders of sanction passed in the orders impugned herein records
that there has been a perusal of materials including FIR, copies of statement of witnesses recorded
under Section 161 of Cr.P.C., documents collected in the course of investigation by CBI in
R.C.15A/2012- CBI/ACB/BLR, and the order specifically states that all documents collected in the
course of investigation by the CBI have been looked into.
71. The reference to ten boxes of documents forwarded by CBI can be construed as containing the
entirety of investigation documents including Section 164 Cr.P.C. statement. The CBI report which
makes a summary of the material before it, has also referred to the Section 164 statement at
Sl.No.189 and recorded a summary of the same. It could be inferred that the said statements under
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91788375/ 31
Sri.S. Muthaiah vs State on 4 August, 2023
Section 164 Cr.P.C. is a part of the materials contained in the boxes sent by CBI.
72. The officers have not only led evidence relating to the sanction orders passed but have also led
evidence to supplement the sanction order listing the material placed before the sanctioning
Authority and if sanction order is read with such evidence the same would fall within the guidelines
laid down by the Apex Court in C.S. Krishnamurthy (supra).
73. Even though there may be some discrepancies in the oral evidence of Sri.Ravishankar Prasad
and Dr.Bagadi Gautam regarding the materials placed before the sanctioning Authority, that by
itself cannot outweigh evidence on sanction order and materials produced before the sanctioning
Authority as would come out from Ex.D4 and Ex.P69. The oral evidence of witness cannot take away
the effect of the note sheet which recites placing of materials of ten boxes before the Authority. A
similar contention was rejected by the Apex Court in C.S. Krishnamurthy (supra) after referring to
the observations of the Apex Court in Balaram Swain v. State of Orissa15 [Balaram Swain]. The
relevant observations in para-10 in C.S. Krishnamurthy are extracted hereinbelow:-
"10.In the case of Balaram Swain v. State of Orissa [1991 Supp (1) SCC 510 : 1991 SCC
(Cri) 707] the High Court reversed the finding of the trial court that the sanctioning
authority has not applied his mind on the materials placed before him. It was
observed in para 9 that the sanctioning authority, namely, PW 4 has stated on oath
that he perused the consolidated report of the vigilance and fully applied his mind
and thereafter issued the sanction. The admission of PW 7 in that case that the entire
record was not looked into, was held to be not fatal to the sanction. The finding of the
High Court was affirmed by the Apex Court. Likewise, PW 40 i.e. the sanctioning
authority in the present case, has gone through the report of the Superintendent of
Police and after discussing the matter with the Legal Department has accorded
sanction. That is enough to show that there is due application of mind in the present
case."
1991 Supp (1) SCC 510
74. It must be noted that the learned Special Judge was merely exercising power of judicial review
and once the sanction order recites that there is perusal of material and evidence is led by the
officers concerned which reveals that all materials collected during investigation has been placed
before the sanctioning Authority, nothing further remains. The learned Special Judge nor this Court
sit as a court of Appeal. In the absence of any mala fides established, it can be construed by invoking
the presumption under Section 114 of Indian Evidence Act, 1872 that the acts are done as required,
which presumption has not been rebutted. The oral evidence including statements made in cross-
examination at the most only brings out that the witness does not recollect details of the specific
materials perused. Such leeway ought to be granted as regards oral testimony of officials when there
is an intervening time gap between the order granting sanction in the year 2013 and the evidence
being led in the year 2019.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91788375/ 32
Sri.S. Muthaiah vs State on 4 August, 2023
75. Insofar as the contention that there has been no application of mind by the Authority granting
sanction as draft sanction order was sent by the Investigating Authority to the State Government
and the State Government while forwarding the file to the Central Government had also forwarded a
draft sanction order which draft sanction orders are almost identical to the sanction orders passed
by the State Government and the Central Government has been rightly rejected by the learned
Special Judge as noticed above.
76. It must be noted that in terms of the CBI Manual the draft sanction order is required to be sent
to the sanctioning Authority. The relevant extract of Vigilance Manual, 2021 by the Central Vigilance
Commission reads as follows:
"6.6.2 Cases where prosecution recommended:
...The report, which may be accompanied by the draft sanction order, should give the
rank and designation of the authority competent to dismiss the delinquent officer
from service and the law or rules under which that authority is competent to do so."
It is in accordance with such practice that the draft sanction orders are sent by the Investigating
Authority. The identity of the draft sanction order and the final order of sanction cannot by itself
lead to a conclusive finding that the sanctioning Authority has acted without application of mind.
The practice of sending draft sanction order is in fact mandated by the Vigilance Manual and much
need not be read into such sending of draft sanction order nor can it be construed such action
reflects an intention to dictate to the sanctioning Authority by the Investigation Authority.
77. Similarly, the use of the word "C£ÀÄªÉÆÃ¢¹zÉ"
("approved") by the Chief Minister and the Minister of Forest and Environment,
Government of India, cannot by itself be reflective of non-application of mind. The
practice of Constitutional/Senior Government functionaries of approving the notes
put up by the administrative hierarchy cannot be faulted. The assent to the note by
the word approved cannot be assailed as reflecting non-application of mind. The
note-sheet at Exhibit-P69 and Exhibit-D4 is typical of notes by administrative
Authorities which are so full of details as in the present case that a perusal of the
same would give a complete picture of the relevant facts and makes the tasks of the
decision making functionary a simple exercise and the word "approved" must be read
in conjunction with the content of the note which has led the Authority to a particular
conclusion. Mere existence of such notes which are a guide to the Authority will not
necessarily result in conferring no discretion to the Authority, which is free to take
any decision on such note. It is only when such note leads to a conclusion which
differs with the decision making Authority that reasons maybe required to be spelt
out. If however the decision making Authority accepts the leads as provided in the
note sheet, the expression of consent to such lead by the word "approved" would be
sufficient and there is no warrant for any further explanation or reasoning required
from the authority.

86. Upon consideration of all these materials, the Chief Minister has granted
approval for sanction for prosecution both under Section 197 of Cr.P.C. as also as
regards the offences under the Karnataka Forest Act, 1962 under Section 114A.
PW.43, Dr.Bagadi Gautam, who was working as Deputy Secretary, DPAR Services at
the relevant period of time has deposed that the CBI office had sent copies of the FIR
along with copies of statements recorded during investigation and five boxes of
documents to the Office of Chief Secretary along with report seeking sanction.
It is deposed that according to the procedure, the file was sent to the Department of Personnel and
Administrative Reforms and PW.43 went through the entire files/reports and two sets of
recommendation were sent to the Chief Minister to accord sanction to prosecute accused No.11
(petitioner herein) and that the Chief Minister had approved the recommendation both as regards
IPC offences and also as regards offences under the Karnataka Forest Act.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91788375/ 37
Sri.S. Muthaiah vs State on 4 August, 2023
87. It is also deposed that the proposal was sent to the Government of India, Ministry of
Environment and Forests for according sanction to prosecute the petitioner for offences under the
provisions of P.C. Act. It is specifically asserted that he personally went through all the records. It is
reiterated that the Investigating Officer had sent the report along with five boxes of report and that
all of such documents were also sent to the Chief Minister. Though there are certain stray
admissions in response to suggestions, however, the same will not have the effect of watering down
the procedure as followed, as reflected in the note sheet of the Government which is marked as an
Exhibit.
88. Once the State Government had approved and accorded sanction, the proposal was forwarded to
the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Vigilance Department in terms of the note sheet
(Exhibit-D7) containing the proceedings of Central Government, the details of documents
forwarded are as follows:-
"2. Government of Karnataka has forwarded the following documents along with the
proposal:-
(a) Investigation report (as submitted by CBI) and it includes version of the accused
officers and comments of the Investigation Officer to rebut the contentions and the
accused statements;
(b) Case records - 5 boxes containing copy of case records;
(c) Draft sanction orders under P.C. Act pertaining to both Sri S.Muthaiah and Sri
Manoj Kumar Shukla;
(d) Opinion of State Law Department;
(e) Copies of prosecution, sanction orders issued by the State Government under
Karnataka Forest Act and Cr.P.C. in respect of (a) Sri S.Muthaiah (i)
G.O.No.DPAR/32/SFP/2014(1), dated 22.02.2014 and (b) Sri Manoj Kumar Shukla -
(i) G.O.No.DPAR/32/SFP/2014(3), dated 22.02.2014 and (ii)
G.O.No.DPAR/32/SFP/2014(4), dated 22.02.2014."
89. Clearly, the entire investigation report as submitted by the CBI including the case records
contained in about five boxes had been sent by the State Government to the Ministry of
Environment and Forests. The note sheet contains the background of the case; crux of the
allegations; details of accused persons; details regarding facilitation provided for the transportation
of Iron Ore without permits and on fake Andhra Pradesh permits; role of accused-petitioner;
explanation and defence of the accused; rebuttal to the explanation of the petitioner; summary of
evidence of witnesses. It comes out from the note-sheet that the case was referred to CVC and such
reference was approved by the Minister and with the recommendation of the Joint Secretary, the
matter was placed for approval of the Minister and finally the approval was recorded.

Sri.S. Muthaiah vs State on 4 August, 2023
90. The evidence is clear regarding the material being placed before the Competent Authority. The
witnesses have withstood cross-examination, note sheet of the State Government at Ex.D16 and that
of the Central Government at Ex.D7 clearly lists out records including CBI report with documents is
contained in five boxes being placed before the Authority while granting sanction by the
Government of Karnataka and the said documents also being sent to the Central Government is
borne out from the note sheet.
91. The CBI report by itself is voluminous and the narration made above in the note sheet contain all
necessary details and accordingly approval by use of the word "C£ÀÄªÉÆÃ¢¹zÉ" ('approved') is
sufficient in terms of the discussion supra at para 77.
92. Even in Ex.D7, the note sheet is voluminous and contains all necessary information, perusal of
which would guide the competent authority to come to a correct conclusion.
93. The learned Special Judge also by a detailed order has arrived at a well considered decision that
requires no interference.
94. The sanction orders are by themselves reflective of application of mind and are eloquent. The
learned Special Judge noted the relevant extracts of the sanction orders which are reproduced as
below:
EX.P158 (ANNEXURE-E) - SANCTION ORDER BY CENTRAL GOVERNMENT17

Sri.S. Muthaiah vs State on 4 August, 2023
95. Clearly, the sanction order speaks for itself and the learned Special Judge nor this Court are
sitting in appeal and in the absence of any allegation of mala fides, no grounds are made out for
interference in the orders of Sanction as upheld by the learned Special Judge. Further, the
conclusion arrived supra at para 64 would also reveal narrow scope for interference.
96. It is also necessary to note that the reasoning of the learned Special Judge is identical
substantively to the reasoning in the order passed in Spl.CC.No.135/2013 and accordingly, the
discussion on the legal aspect regarding scope of interference is to be treated as a part of reasoning
leading to non-interference with the order of the Special Judge insofar as Spl.CC.No.6/2014.
B.3. W.P.No.19178/2021 (Spl.CC.No.21/2014)
97. The petitioner/accused No.2 has sought for setting aside of the order dated 05.05.2020 which is
the order passed on validity of sanction, whereby the learned Special Judge has upheld the sanction
for prosecution issued by the State Government and Central Government.
98. The facts are identical as narrated and the order dealt with in the other Writ Petitions, the only
difference is of being involvement of Exporter M/s.Dream Logistics Co. (India) Pvt. Ltd., who is
alleged to have exported 9.16 lakh Metric Tons of Iron Ore through Belekeri Port between
01.01.2009 and 31.05.2010. It is alleged that there was illegal mining in the forest area of Bellary
without valid permits from the Department of Mines and Geology and Department of Forests and
also without payment of royalty under Forest Development Acts. All these activities, it is alleged has
been made in connivance and conspiracy with accused No.2 and other Government officials of other
Departments, resulting in wrongful loss to Government of Karnataka and accordingly, FIR was
registered for the offences punishable under 120-B read with Section 420, 379, 411, 447 of IPC,
Section 13(2) read with Section 13(1)(d) of the P.C. Act, 1988, Section 21 read with 4(1), 4(1)(A) and
Section 23 of MMDR and Section 24 of Karnataka Forest Act, 1963.
99. Insofar as sanction of prosecution for offences under the Karnataka Forest Act, P.C. Act and IPC,
the Head of Branch C.B.I. and A.C.B. had sought for sanction for prosecution against the petitioner
and Sri Manoj Kumar Shukla. The C.B.I. having registered a criminal case in R.C.13(A)/2012 on
13.09.2012 against M/s.Dream Logistics Co., requisition for sanction to Authorities was made. The
note sheet with orders of sanction and other documents insofar as are relevant to the proceedings
before the State Government has been marked as Ex.D.10. The note sheet contains synopsis of
allegations as regards the petitioner (accused No.2) and also the allegations against Sri Manoj
Kumar Shukla (accused No.10). The said Exhibit contains an index of the material that has been

inspected any of the mines despite several complaints lodged by the mine owner M/s. Ramgad
Minerals and Mining Pvt. Ltd., also known as Dalmia Mines (ML.No.2010) regarding the illegal
encroachment by the neighbouring lessees into said Dalmia mines (ML.2010).
15) That in pursuance of the said conspiracy Sri.Ramakanth Yallappa Hullar (A-9), the then Circle
GO NO.DPAR 33 SFP 2014(2) Bangalore Dated 18-02-2014 Inspector, Sandur Circle in conspiracy

not to touch the vehicles belonging to the said accused persons thereby enabling the accused
persons to transport the illegal iron ore without permits to Belekeri Port and in return he had
accepted illegal gratifications from the said accused persons.
16) That investigation has also disclosed that vide letter No.Est./deputation/CR.23/2005.06/362
dated 23-03-2009, Sri.S.Muthaiah, the then Deputy Conservator of Forests, Bellary had written a

issuance of Form 29 at Halkundi Check-post and had clearly stated that as per Rule 145(4) of KFR
1969, a pass ie., Form 29 is mandated for transport or removal of forest produce from outside the
State. Moreover Rule 152(1) also clearly stipulates that no forest produce brought into the State by
road or water shall be conveyed within the limits of the State beyond the first check-post after its
entry into the State without a pass in Form 29 issued under Rule 145 after the surrender of the
"Import Pass". Thus, it is clear that any forest produce entering into the State of Karnataka would
require a pass in Form 29 for transportation of forest produce with the State. Sri.Biswajit Mishra
had expressed concern, that if this matter was not sorted then it would become difficult to regulate
the transportation of iron ore in Karnataka and he had also expressed concern that exempting from
issuing Form-29 would result in the loss of revenue to the State Government. He had also brought to

action/decision was taken by Shri S. Muthaiah and also by Shri S.M.K.Shukla for the resumption of
the issuance of Form 29 clearly revealing that both had actively colluded with other accused persons

stopped with dishonest intention to facilitate Sri.G.Janardhana Reddy and his associates in
transportation of illegal iron ore through the said Karnataka Andhra border forest check-post. In
this manner, Sri.S.Muthaiah, the then Deputy Conservator of Forest, Bellary and Sri. Manoj Kumar

the illegal mining activities carried out by Sri.G.Janardhana Reddy and his associates either at the
surrendered area of LMC mines or at the mining lease area of M/s.Ramgad Minerals and Mining
Pvt, Ltd., (Dalmia Mines) which also belonged to the State Government as statutory clearances were
yet to be given for handing over the lease area (Dalmia Mines) to M/s. Ramgad Minerals and Mining
Pvt. Ltd. Similarly, they had not taken any action regarding the illegal encroachment or illegal
mining carried out at the lease area of M/s. MSPL at Vyasanakere ie., in ML No.2416 by the lessees
M/s S.B.Minerals, Vyasanakere (ML.2515) etc.,

loss of more than Rs.90.72 crore to the Government exchequer and wrongful gain for themselves.
21) By the above acts, Sri.S.Muthaiah, the then Deputy Conservator of Forests, Bellary incollusion
with others has committed the offences punishable under sections 120-B r/w 409, 420, 434, 447,
468, 471 of IPC; under section 13(2) r/w 13(1) (c) and (d) of PC Act 1988.
22) AND, WHEREAS, the Chief Minister on behalf of the Government of Karnataka, the competent
authority to accord sanction against the said Sri.S.Muthaiah, the then Dy.Conservator of Forests,
Bellary Circle, Bellary and present under suspension, after fully and carefully examining all the
material placed before me, such as, copy of the FIR, copies of the statements of witnesses and other
documents collected during the course of investigation in RC 16(A)/2012/CBI/ACB/Bangalore,
which were placed before the Chief Minister for his consideration in regard to the said allegations,
consider that a prima- facie case has been made out against Sri. S. Muthaiah, the then Dy.
Conservator of Forests, Bellary District, Bellary, Karnataka, presently under suspension and that he
should be prosecuted for the above said offences.
23) Now, therefore, Government of Karnataka, do hereby accord sanction under section 114-A of
Karnataka Forest Act, 1963 for the prosecution of Sri.S.Muthaiah, IFS in a court of law for the said
offences and for taking cognizance of the said offences by the court of competent jurisdiction."
135. A perusal of the said extracts clearly indicate that the orders granting sanction are eloquent and
contain all necessary details and the order speaks for itself. The Court, records the answer of PW.25
to the effect that all materials were placed as was reflected in the charge sheet. It is observed that
though there were some admissions by the witnesses, however, the same would not vitiate the order
granting sanction. The Court also records evidence of PW.27 and PW.28 in support of the order of
sanction detailing the procedure followed for grant of sanction. The Court records the law laid down
by the Apex Court in CBI v. Ashok Kumar Aggarwal26 and Mahesh G. Jain (supra) and also
observes that sanction orders being public documents, in terms of Section 74 of the Indian Evidence
Act, the same can be proved in terms of Sections 76 and 78 of Indian Evidence Act and that the same
are proved in the present case. The Court records that the truth of allegations need not be gone into
by the sanctioning authority and that on a perusal of Ex.P103 to Ex.P111, it is clear that the
Government has considered all materials placed on record with regard to allegations made against
the accused persons.
136. The Special Court also records the detailed note sheet prepared by the Department of
Environment and Forests, which shows that the sanctioning authority has considered all aspects.
The Special Court finally concludes (2014) 14 SCC 295 that it is not for the sanctioning authority to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91788375/ 62
Sri.S. Muthaiah vs State on 4 August, 2023
judge the truth of allegations made against the accused persons by calling for records of the case. It
is noted that the grant of sanction is an administrative function, the presumption under Section
114(e) of the Indian Evidence Act would enable drawing of presumption that official acts have been
performed regularly. Eventually, the conclusion is that there is no case made out for interference
with the orders of sanction.
137. Having perused Ex.D6 and Ex.D1, it is clear that all necessary materials were before the
Authorities concerned, detailed note sheets have guided the Authorities in granting approval to the
orders of sanction, minor contradictions in the evidence will not take away the written evidence as
contained in the records marked in Ex.D1 and Ex.D6. The Courts do not sit as Appellate Authorities
as against the orders of sanction and in the absence of mala fides and in light of the materials placed
before the sanctioning authority, there is no warrant to interfere with the said orders and
accordingly, this Court concurs with the view of the learned Special Judge.
II QUASHING OF PROCEEDINGS:-
138. The petitioner has sought for quashing the proceedings in Spl. CC. Nos.135/2013, 105/2014,
6/2014 and 21/2014 pending on the file of Special Judge for CBI Cases and now pending before the
Addl. City Civil and Sessions Judge, Bangalore, registered for the offences punishable under
Sections 120-B read with Section 409, 420, 434, 447, 468, 471 of IPC and under Section 13(2) read
with Section 13(1)(c) and (d) of P.C. Act.
139. It must be noticed that the present petition has been filed under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. and
during the pendency of the proceedings before the Special Court, the discharge applications had
been filed. The Special Court has rejected the applications filed seeking discharge by its order dated
17.04.2017 and the correctness of such order has not been directly assailed in the present
proceedings though the petitioner resorts for quashing of proceedings while invoking the
jurisdiction under Section 482 of Cr.P.C.
140. Sri Hashmath Pasha, learned Senior Counsel appearing for Sri Nasir Ali for the petitioner has
assailed the validity of proceedings primarily on the ground that there are multiple FIRs registered
which have an overlap and such FIRs are registered only on the ground that there are different
exporters who are involved. It is contended that though there is only one offence and the other
offences stated to have been committed, the same are in the course of same transaction and
occurrence. It is also contended that there is violation of the principle enshrined under Article 20(2)
of the Constitution of India and the provisions under Section 300 of Cr.P.C.
141. It is contended that the lands were not forest lands and there was only a proposal under Section
4 of the Karnataka Forest Act and accordingly, no case could be made out against the petitioner,
who is a Forest Officer.
142. It is further contended that Iron Ore is a non-forest produce and accordingly, no offence is
made under the provisions of the Karnataka Forest Act.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91788375/ 63
Sri.S. Muthaiah vs State on 4 August, 2023
143. It is also contended that there is no clarity as to whether the mining is in forest area or Patta
lands or lands after expiry of lease retained by the Government.
144. It is contended that there has to be a joint trial as regards all offences and if it is not so done,
the petitioner would be put to serious prejudice.
145. Sri P. Prasanna Kumar, learned Special Public Prosecutor appearing on behalf of
respondent-CBI has however contended that multiple FIRs can be registered for distinct offences if
the allegations in the subsequent FIRs cover different allegations. It is contended that separate FIRs
have been registered in R.C.Nos.13(A)/2012, 14(A)/2012, 15(A)/2012 and No.16(A)/2012 and the
Table extracted in para-5 of the written arguments for the purpose of convenience is extracted
below:
R.C.No. Allegation 13(A)/2012 The said FIR was registered for the export of 9.16 Lac MT of Iron Ore
by M/s.Dream Logistics Co. India Ltd. between 01.01.2009 to 31.05.2010. 14(A)/2012 The said FIR
was registered for the export of 9.86 Lac MT of Iron Ore by M/s.ILC Industries between 01.01.2009
to 31.05.2010.
15(A)/2012 The said FIR was registered for the export of 7.74 Lac MT of Iron Ore by M/s.S.B.
Logistics between 01.01.2009 to 31.05.2010.
16(A)/2012 The said FIR was registered for the export of 7.23 Lac MT of Iron Ore by M/s.Shree
Mallikarjuna Shipping Pvt. Ltd., between 01.01.2009 to 31.05.2010.
146. It is submitted that respondent-CBI has filed separate charge sheets in light of separate
transactions. It is further submitted that four charge sheets have been filed as regards four FIRs in
light of each FIR constituting a separate and distinct offence. It is submitted that though the modus
operandi in committing the offence is the same, it cannot be construed that the distinct offences
committed on the basis of a common modus operandi is to be construed as constituting a single
offence.
147. It is also submitted that the question of violation of Article 20(2) of the Constitution of India or
Section 300 of Cr.P.C. does not arise, as the petitioner has neither been convicted or acquitted for
the offence on the basis of same set of facts on a prior occasion. Accordingly, it is submitted that the
contention of double jeopardy does not apply.
148. Insofar as the contention that the alleged offence is in fact not an offence as the alleged mining
is in non-forest area, it is submitted that Section 17 of the Karnataka Forest Act provides for defining
the limits of a forest which is intended to constitute a reserve forest and to declare the same to be a
reserved forest from the date fixed by such notification. It is submitted that once a notification is
passed under Section 17(2) of Karnataka Forest Act, such forest shall be deemed to be a reserved
forest. Accordingly, it is submitted that it is not the case of the petitioner that the area in question
where illegal mining has occurred is a reserved forest, but it is the case of the respondent-CBI that
illegal mining has taken place in a forest area. It is submitted that even if the leasehold rights
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91788375/ 64
Sri.S. Muthaiah vs State on 4 August, 2023
granted have expired, on expiry of such leasehold period, the land held by the private mining
companies would fall back within the jurisdiction of the Forest Department.
149. It is further contended that the registration of FIRs was pursuant to the direction of the Apex
Court in Samaj Parivartana Samudaya (supra), which directions were issued pursuant to the
acceptance of the report of the CEC and the observations made in the order of CEC was to the effect
that FIRs are to be registered and investigation carried out relating to illegal extraction of Iron Ore
from the forest areas of Karnataka.
150. The Special Court in Spl.CC.No.135/2013, while dismissing the application for discharge has
made a detailed analysis of the contentions raised by the petitioner. The Special Court has recorded
a specific finding at para-121 of the order that "...Under the given set of circumstances, at this stage,
it is not possible to say accusations made against this accused No.2 in the case on hand and other
accused in Spl. C.C.Nos.116/2012 are one and the same...". It is also to be noted that the learned
Special Judge has recorded a similar finding insofar as the contentions of the petitioner are
concerned in Spl.CC.Nos.105/2014, 06/2014 and 21/2014.
151. Insofar as the contention regarding forest area is concerned and regarding forest produce, the
learned Special Judge has recorded a finding by relying on Section 80 of the Karnataka Forest Act
that there is a presumption that forest area belongs to the Government until the contrary is proved.
152. It must be seen that the question as to whether Iron Ore which was subject matter of
transportation and alleged part of illegal export was forest produce, that the land from which such
Iron Ore was extracted was forest land, is a finding that can be recorded only on the basis of
evidence and records, which aspect of appreciation is a matter best to be left to the trial Court.
153. The question whether the area from which illegal mining has been resorted to after expiry of
lease would still retain the character of forest land, whether mining was from a part of the forest
land, whether the Iron Ore itself would come within the purview of 'forest produce', are matters that
need not be adjudicated at this stage so as to close a prosecution which is being tested in trial.
154. It is also to be noticed that the finding as regards forest land or non-forest land while
interpreting the notification ought not to be embarked upon wherein the same question would arise
as regards co-accused who are not parties in the present proceedings and accordingly, Court must
refrain from recording a finding that may jeopardize prosecution against other accused persons
against whom the trial is in progress.
155. Insofar as the question of multiple FIRs is concerned, taking into consideration the submission
of learned Special Public Prosecutor appearing for CBI and relying on the Table extracted supra, it is
to be noticed that R.C.No.13(A)/2012 was registered as regards export of Iron Ore by M/s.Dream
Logistics India Co., Ltd., for the period between 01.01.2009 to 31.05.2010; as regards
R.C.No.14(A)/2012, FIR was registered for export of 9.86 lakhs of Metric Ton of Iron Ore by
M/s.ILC Industries between 1.1.2009 to 31.05.2010; as regards R.C.No.15(A)/2012, FIR was
registered for export of 7.74 lakh Metric Ton of Iron Ore by M/s. S.B.Logistics between 1.1.2009 to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91788375/ 65
Sri.S. Muthaiah vs State on 4 August, 2023
31.05.2010; while R.C.No.16(A)/2012, FIR was registered for export of of 7.23 lakh Metric Ton of
Iron Ore by M/s.Mallikarjuna Shipping Pvt. Ltd. between 1.1.2009 to 31.05.2010. Accordingly, the
export of Iron Ore of different quantities by different Companies have been registered as a separate
FIR as noticed from the Table extracted supra and accordingly, there is a substance in the
contention that the subject matter of each of the FIRs are distinct and accordingly, the question of
accepting the contention that there are multiple FIRs with respect to the same offence prima facie
cannot be accepted.
156. Though it is contended that there is an overlap of FIRs, however, learned Special Public
Prosecutor appearing for CBI has rightly pointed out that though the modus operandi is the same,
however, there are separate and distinct overt acts in course of separate transactions which
constitute different offences and accordingly, it cannot be contended that there are no multiple sets
of offences that have been committed. Any finding after a detailed analysis regarding overlapping of
offences, is a matter that could be arrived at only during trial and beyond the limited scope of
limited jurisdiction under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. to appreciate evidence and interfere with the
findings made in the order of discharge. Similarly, as to whether offence made out in
R.C.No.18(A)/2011 has an overlap with R.C.Nos.13(A)/2012, 14(A)/2012, 15(A)/2012 and
16(A)/2012 are also factual findings to be arrived at after appreciation of evidence which ought not
to be made in exercise of present jurisdiction invoked.
157. It must be noted that the present FIRs having been registered pursuant to the order of the Apex
Court in Samaj Parivartana Samudaya (supra) cannot be interfered with lightly without permitting
the trial to conclude. The legal effect of lands notified under Section 4 of the Karnataka Forest Act
and as to whether it would qualify to be forest land, whether the mining was in fact carried out in
forest land carrying out mining in lands where leasehold rights have expired and whether such land
if earlier was forest land are again factually dense contentions which are mixed questions of fact and
law which can be gone into only by the trial Court.
Insofar as the relief sought as regards forest offences is concerned, it must be noticed that charges
framed do not pertain to forest offences and accordingly, the question of adjudication sought for by
the petitioner does not arise for consideration.
158. Insofar as the contention of the petitioner that R.C.No.18(A)/2011 which is the complaint that
is comprehensive may be permitted to proceeded with while the other complaints could be stayed as
noticed above, prima facie, the subject matter of each of the FIRs constitute a separate offence. The
alternative contention that there could be consolidation of FIRs in light of Section 219 and 223 of
Cr.P.C., it must be observed that such application ought to have been filed before the trial Court, as
it is the trial Court to decide as regards such request and more importantly, such request must be
made prior to commencement of the trial. The trial being at an advanced stage, it is not open for
such consideration at the present stage.
159. It must be noticed that as against the order dismissing application for discharge, revision under
Section 397(2) of Cr.P.C. would be maintainable. The petitioner not having challenged the said
orders in revision proceedings and having invoked the present jurisdiction, which is narrower than
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91788375/ 66
Sri.S. Muthaiah vs State on 4 August, 2023
the jurisdiction in appeal/revision, the scope of interference being limited in light of the discussion
made above, the Court has refused to interfere and intervene in the proceedings before the trial
Court, which ought to be allowed to be proceeded.
160. It is also necessary to note that the proceedings before the trial Court are at an advanced stage
except in R.C.No.18(A)/2011. The orders of sanction have been upheld and a specific finding is being
recorded as regards the validity of such orders, the evidence of many of witnesses have been
recorded and their cross-examination is complete and at this stage, no case is made out for
interference.
161. It is also to be noticed that the discretionary jurisdiction under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. is to be
exercised to prevent abuse of process or to secure ends of justice only in exceptional cases. Where
interference in exercise of such jurisdiction requires appreciation of evidence, finding on facts, it
would be best left for such matters to be decided during trial. In the present case, it must also be
kept in mind that any finding regarding mining operations in a forest area or in non-forest area
would have implication as regards other criminal cases also pending and accordingly, it may not be
appropriate to jeopardize the cases against other accused by recording a finding as against the
petitioner alone.
162. Accordingly, this Court does not find any scope for interference and the Writ Petitions are
dismissed.
