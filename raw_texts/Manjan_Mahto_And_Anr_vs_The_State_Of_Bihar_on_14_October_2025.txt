3. The factual matrix of the present case is as under : -
As per the written statement of the informant, Lalan
Mahato, his sister, Samtola Devi alias Munni Devi, had been
married to the son of Ramuna Mahato in Nanhkar Belwa
village, located in the Lauriya police station area, approximately
three years ago. It is stated that she was repeatedly subjected to
physical abuse by her husband and in-laws, who blamed her for
being unable to bear children. On the morning of January 12,
2014, at around 8:00 AM, Lalan received a call informing him
that his sister had been set on fire and was severely burned by
her husband, Manjan Mahato, along with Ramuna Mahato. At
the time, Samtola Devi was being treated at Lauriya hospital.
Upon arriving at the hospital, the informant observed that his
sister had sustained serious burns, and the attending doctor

hostile at the prosecution's request.
In his cross-examination, the witness testified that the

passed away four to five months ago. He mentioned that he had

facts came to light during cross-examination that would support
the prosecution's case.

in-chief, testified that on 31.01.2014, he was posted as a

Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.285 of 2016 dt. 16-10-2025
15. PW 12, Lalan Mahato, the informant in this case, stated in his examination-in-chief that Samtola
Devi, also known as Munni Devi, was his sister and that she had been married to Manjan Mahato
three years prior. In paragraph 2, this witness testified that on January 12, 2014, he received a call
on his mobile phone informing him that his sister was being treated for burns at Lauriya Hospital.
Upon arriving at the hospital, he found his sister suffering from burns and undergoing treatment.
The doctor advised him to take her to Bettiah for further treatment. While on route from Lauriya to
Bettiah by jeep, his sister succumbed to her injuries. He then returned to Lauriya Hospital with her
body, where the police arrived. He subsequently had an application written by Devendra Anand and
submitted it to the police. In paragraph 3, this witness stated that, during the journey to Bettiah, his
sister had told him that Manjan Mahato, Ramuna Mahato, and Samtola Devi had attempted to kill
her by setting her on fire. In paragraph 5, this witness identified the accused.
During cross-examination, in paragraph 6, he admitted that he did not witness the fire himself. He
further testified that his sister was not happy in her marital home and had frequently complained
about the situation. However, in Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.285 of 2016 dt. 16-10-2025
paragraph 7, he stated that he had visited his sister's in-laws' house 4-5 times after her marriage and
found her to be happy during those visits. In paragraph 8, the witness revealed that when he
inquired with the person who had informed him via mobile, he was told that his sister had been
burnt in a stove fire. In paragraph 9, he stated that during the journey from Lauriya to Bettiah, his
sister had reiterated that she was burnt due to a stove fire. In paragraph 10, he acknowledged that
he was unaware of the contents of the application he had submitted, as the Sub- Inspector did not
read it to him.
16. PW 13, Bhrigunath Singh, the Investigating Officer (I.O.) in this case, testified in his
examination-in-chief that on January 12, 2014, he was posted at Lauriya Police Station. On that
date, Chowkidar 1/2 Jagdish Manjhi informed him through phone that Manjan Mahato's wife had
died in Nanhkar village, and that her family members had fled, with no villagers offering assistance
in taking her for treatment. Based on this information, FIR No. 308, dated 12-01-14, was registered,
and the I.O. proceeded to Nanhkar for further action. Upon arrival, he found Samtola Devi alias
Munni Devi severely burnt in her house and groaning in pain. She was loaded into the police jeep

Manjan Mahto And Anr vs The State Of Bihar on 14 October, 2025
and taken to the government hospital in Lauriya. Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.285 of 2016
dt. 16-10-2025 During transit, the SDPO, Narkatiyaganj, was informed, and on his direction, the
Block Development Officer (BDO), Lauriya, was requested to record her dying declaration. In
paragraph 2, the witness stated that the dying declaration of Samtola Devi alias Munni Devi was
recorded by Magistrate (Block Agriculture Officer) Tarkeshwar Ram, which was later marked as
Exhibit 3. In paragraph 4, the I.O. testified that the deceased's brother, Lalan Mahato, submitted a
report based on which Lauriya Police Station Case No. 514/14, dated 12.01.14, was registered under
Sections 302/34 of the Indian Penal Code. The I.O. identified the handwriting and signature of the
witness on the written report, marked as Exhibit 4. In paragraph 7, the I.O. described the location of
the incident. Samtola Devi alias Munni Devi was found injured in the courtyard of her ancestral
house in Nanhkar village. The room had a brick roof, and the latch on the inner door, made of wood,
was broken. However, no article inside the house was burnt, and there were no signs of any fire
inside the room. In paragraph 13, the I.O. detailed the statement given by Bandhu Sah, who stated
that upon seeing smoke coming from Ramuna Mahato's house, he went there and found Ramuna
Mahato's daughter-in-law (the victim) crying in the courtyard, severely burnt. Efforts were made to
extinguish the Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.285 of 2016 dt. 16-10-2025 fire, but the victim
succumbed to her burn injuries. The I.O. also noted that Manjan Mahato had a history of abusing
and assaulting his wife.
In paragraph 21 of the cross-examination, the I.O. explained that after receiving the information, he
visited the incident site, as described in paragraph 7. It was mentioned that the door was locked
from inside, and after the latch was broken, the door opened. Villagers then arrived and provided
information regarding the scene. In paragraph 22, the I.O. confirmed that the door of the room was
found broken in his presence. In paragraph 28, the I.O. testified that the deceased was almost 100%
burnt from bottom to top. In paragraph 31, the I.O. stated that the statement of the deceased's
mother-in- law was recorded in paragraph 2 of the case diary. According to the mother-in-law's
statement, Manjan Mahato had beaten his wife and, in a fit of rage, she set herself on fire, thenthe
door was broken and she was taken out. In paragraph 34, the I.O. noted that the statement of the
treating doctor had not been recorded. In paragraph 35, the I.O. stated that statements taken by the
officer from the Block Development Office were not recorded.
17. PW 14, Shri Tarakeshwar Ram, testified in his Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.285 of 2016
dt. 16-10-2025 examination-in-chief that on January 12, 2014, he was posted as the Block
Agriculture Officer in Lauriya Block. On that day, he recorded the dying declaration of Samtola Devi
alias Munni Devi at the Lauriya Primary Health Centre. He wrote the statement in his own
handwriting as narrated by Samtola Devi. While recording the dying declaration, Sub-Inspector
Bhrigunath Singh was present. He read out the dying declaration to Samtola Devi and made her
affix her thumb impression on it. Both his signature and Sub-Inspector Bhrigunath Singh's
signature appear on the document, which has been marked as Exhibit 3.
In paragraph 2 of his cross-examination, the witness admitted that he had written in the last line of
the statement that the victim could not narrate the entire incident. He also stated that he did not
remember whether a doctor was present at the time of recording the statement. In paragraph 3, the
witness clarified that he did not obtain any certificate from a doctor regarding the victim's mental
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169680882/ 9
Manjan Mahto And Anr vs The State Of Bihar on 14 October, 2025
condition to confirm her fitness to give a statement. He further stated that he took the statement
based on the oral order of the Block Development Officer (BDO), Lauriya Block, and that he did not
receive a formal order for recording the statement. In paragraph 5, the witness Patna High Court
CR. APP (DB) No.285 of 2016 dt. 16-10-2025 stated that the victim had sustained 90 percent burns
and was lying on her back with very little hair left on her face. He asked the victim whether she was
in a fit state to give a statement but did not mention this in the recorded statement. The witness also
stated that it was incorrect to claim that he took the victim's dying declaration without authority,
and he denied that he wrote the statement at the behest of the police. He further denied the
allegation that the victim was not fit to give a statement at the time.
18. It is contended on behalf of the appellants that the impugned judgment of conviction and
sentence is unsustainable either in law or on facts. The learned trial court failed to properly
appreciate, assess, and evaluate the evidence available on record. A proper consideration of the
same would have led to the acquittal of the appellants. It has been submitted that out of fourteen
prosecution witnesses examined in the case, P.Ws. 1 to 10 have turned hostile and have not
supported the prosecution version. The informant, P.W.-12, Lalan Mahto, himself stated that the
deceased appeared happy in her matrimonial home, and that he was informed she had died of burn
injuries caused by a stove. The evidence further discloses that the deceased herself stated that she
sustained burn injuries from the stove. Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.285 of 2016 dt.
16-10-2025
19. Learned counsel for the appellants further submits that P.W.-13, the Investigating Officer,
deposed that appellant no. 2 had stated the deceased burnt herself following a quarrel with her
husband and that she was rescued by villagers after breaking open the door. The treating doctor was
not examined, nor was the officer who allegedly recorded the dying declaration. It is well settled that
conviction cannot rest upon an uncorroborated and shaky dying declaration. The Investigating
Officer also noted in paragraph 7 of the case diary that the door of the room in which the deceased
was found injured had been broken open by villagers to save her, further supporting the possibility
of suicide rather than homicide.
20. Learned counsel further submits that P.W.-14, the Block Agriculture Officer, who purportedly
recorded the dying declaration, admitted that no doctor was present at the time, nor was any
medical certificate obtained regarding the fitness of the deceased to make such a statement. He was
not authorized by any competent authority to record it, nor did he follow the questionnaire method.
The authenticity and reliability of such a statement are therefore doubtful.
21. Learned counsel further submits that the investigation initially found the case true under Section
306 Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.285 of 2016 dt. 16-10-2025 IPC. However, without proper
appreciation of the factual circumstances suggesting suicide due to domestic discord, cognizance
was erroneously taken under Sections 302/34 IPC. Even the evidence recorded during trial supports
the inference that the deceased committed suicide after bolting herself inside the room, from where
she was later rescued by breaking open the door. There is no eyewitness to the alleged occurrence,
and the circumstantial evidence on record does not unerringly point to the guilt of the appellants.
The evidence of the prosecution witnesses suffers from material contradictions and inconsistencies,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169680882/ 10
Manjan Mahto And Anr vs The State Of Bihar on 14 October, 2025
rendering their testimony unreliable.
22. At the time of conclusion of his arguments, learned counsel for the appellants placed reliance
upon a judgment rendered by a Division Bench of this Court in the case of Saurav Sharma @ Saurav
Kumar Sharma @ Saurabha Kumar Sharma @ Mukul Sharma and Anr. vs. The State of Bihar, in
Criminal Appeal (DB) No. 1271 of 2017, decided on 13.08.2024. Learned counsel further submitted
that paragraph 12 of the said judgment contains a list of the decisions discussed therein, which are
reproduced as under:
(i) Abhishek Sharma Vs. State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi), reported in AIR 2023 SC 5271;
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.285 of 2016 dt. 16-10-2025
(ii) Uttam Vs. The State of Maharashtra, reported in (2022) 8 SCC 576;
(iii) Naresh Kumar Vs. State of Delhi, reported in 2024 SCC OnLine SC 1641;
(iv) Sardar Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh, reported in (1954) 2 SCC 214;
(v) Jan Mohammad and Another Vs. State of Bihar, reported in (1953) 1 SCC 5;
(vi) Laxman Vs. State of Maharashtra, reported in (2002) 6 SCC 710;
(vii) Koli Chunilal Savji & Anr. Vs. State of Gujarat, reported in (1999) 9 SCC 562;
(viii) P.V. Radhakrishna Vs. State of Karnataka, reported in (2003) 6 SCC 443.
23. Paragraph 41 of the aforesaid judgment contains the findings and extracts from various
decisions wherein the fundamental principles applicable to dying declarations have been discussed.
24. Learned counsel for the appellants further submits that the alleged dying declaration cannot be
treated as a genuine dying declaration, as it suffers from several defects. In particular, it has not
been recorded as a statement of the injured who subsequently died, as is evident from the record of
the alleged dying declaration, which is marked as Exhibit-3.
25. On the contrary, the learned Additional Public Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.285 of 2016
dt. 16-10-2025 Prosecutor (APP) for the State submits that a total of 14 witnesses have been
examined on behalf of the prosecution. PW 1, Gaya Mahato, the father of the deceased, has testified
regarding the death of his daughter due to burns. The informant, Lalan Mahato (PW 12), has fully
supported the incident in his examination-in-chief. In paragraph 3 of his testimony, he stated that,
during transport, his sister made a statement indicating that Manjan Mahato, Ramuna Mahato, and
Samtola Devi attempted to kill her by setting her on fire. This fact was also corroborated by the
testimony of this witness during cross-examination at paragraph -6, that his sister did not live
happily with her husband and frequently complained about the conditions at her in-laws' house. The
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169680882/ 11
Manjan Mahto And Anr vs The State Of Bihar on 14 October, 2025
learned APP also highlighted that the dying declaration of the deceased, Munni Devi alias Samtola
Devi, was recorded by the Block Agriculture Officer. It is evident from the dying declaration that the
victim clearly stated before her death that her husband, mother-in-law, and father-in-law have set
her on fire.
26. The learned APP further contends that the doctor's certificate on the dying declaration, which
attests to the victim being in a sound mental state before her death, is not tenable. The learned APP
also argues that the fact that the dying Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.285 of 2016 dt.
16-10-2025 declaration was not written in response to a supporting reply does not render it
inadmissible. In this case, the formal FIR was filed under Sections 302/34 of the IPC, but after
investigation, the charge sheet was submitted under Section 306 of the IPC. Despite this, charges
have been framed against the accused under Section 302/34 of the IPC. The investigating officer,
PW 13, has testified that the latch inside the house was made of wood and was found broken, though
no evidence has been presented by the prosecution to corroborate this statement. Thus, the
judgment of conviction and the order of sentence are well-founded and do not warrant any
interference.
27. Upon hearing the parties and after perusal of the records, we have observed that in the present
appeal, a total of 14 witnesses were produced by the prosecution and 8 exhibits were brought on
record. Among these, the most important is Exhibit-2, the alleged dying declaration of the victim,
which has been made the sole basis for the conviction and sentence in the present case, against
which this appeal has been preferred.
28. From the record, it transpires that PW-1, PW-2, PW-3, PW-4, PW-5, PW-6, PW-7, PW-8, PW-9
and PW-10 have turned hostile. PW 6 is an inquest witness, but in his cross- examination, he
deposed that he had no knowledge of the Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.285 of 2016 dt.
16-10-2025 incident. PW 11 is the doctor of MJK Hospital, Bettiah, who conducted the post-mortem
examination and opined that the death had occurred due to hypovolemic shock. He further opined
that the burn injuries were ante-mortem in nature and that death had occurred within 6 to 24 hours
prior to the post- mortem examination. PW 12, the brother of the deceased, in his cross-examination
(paragraph 8), deposed that he had received information that his sister died due to a stove fire. In
paragraph 7, he stated that after his sister's marriage, whenever he visited her matrimonial home,
she appeared to be happy. In paragraph 9, he further stated that while he was carrying his sister
from Lauriya to Bettiah, she disclosed to him that she had sustained burn injuries due to a stove fire.
PW 13 is the Investigating Officer in whose presence the dying declaration was recorded, and he is
also one of the witnesses to it. The said dying declaration was recorded by PW 14, Tarkeshwar Ram,
Block Agriculture Officer, Lauriya. In paragraph 6 of his deposition, PW 13 deposed that he did not
witness the incident of fire himself. In paragraph 7, he stated that the room had a brick roof and that
the inner wooden latch of the door was broken. In paragraph 21 of his cross-examination, it
emerged that the door was locked from inside, and after the latch was broken, the door Patna High
Court CR. APP (DB) No.285 of 2016 dt. 16-10-2025 opened, whereupon the villagers arrived and
informed him about the occurrence. In paragraph 22, the Investigating Officer confirmed that the
door of the room was found broken in his presence and that the deceased had sustained almost
100% burn injuries from head to toe. In paragraph 34 of his cross- examination, it was revealed that

Manjan Mahto And Anr vs The State Of Bihar on 14 October, 2025
the statement of the treating doctor was not recorded, and in paragraph 35, he admitted that the
statement of the Block Agriculture Officer was also not recorded during investigation.
29. Upon further perusal of the evidence of PW 14, Tarkeshwar Ram, Block Agriculture Officer,
Lauriya, who recorded the dying declaration of the deceased Samtola Devi at Lauriya Primary
Health Centre, it appears that he deposed that the dying declaration was written by him in his own
handwriting as narrated by Samtola Devi. He also stated that Sub-Inspector Bhrigunath Singh (PW
13) was present at that time. He further deposed that he read over the dying declaration to Samtola
Devi and obtained her thumb impression thereon, after which both PW 14 and PW 13 signed the
document, which has been marked as Exhibit-3. However, in his cross- examination, PW 14 stated
that the victim could not narrate the entire incident. He also admitted that he did not remember
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.285 of 2016 dt. 16-10-2025 whether any doctor was present at
the time of recording the statement. Furthermore, as per paragraph 3 of his deposition, he did not
obtain any certificate from the doctor regarding the victim's mental condition to confirm her fitness
to give the statement.
30. Upon perusal of the judgment rendered in the case of Saurav Sharma (supra), relied upon by the
appellants, it transpires to this Court that paragraph 41 of the said judgment contains the findings
and extracts from various decisions mentioned in paragraph 12 wherein the fundamental principles
applicable to dying declarations have been discussed, as under :
(1) Each dying declaration must be scrutinized on its own merits. The Court has to
examine upon which of the statements reliance can be placed in order for the case to
proceed further. Medical fitness of the person making such declaration, at the
relevant time, assumes importance along with other factors such as possibility of
tutoring by the relatives etc.;
(2) If the Court is satisfied that the dying declaration is true and trustworthy, it can
base conviction upon it without corroboration.;
(3) The Court has to scrutinize the dying declaration carefully and must ensure that
the declaration is not the result of tutoring, Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.285
of 2016 dt. 16-10-2025 prompting or imagination and the declarant was in a fit state
to make the declaration.;
(4) Where the deceased was unconscious and could never make any dying
declaration, the evidence with regard to it is to be rejected.;
(5) Where the prosecution version differs from the version as given in the dying
declaration, the said declaration cannot be acted upon.;
(6) The Court, in order to satisfy whether deceasedwas in a fit mental condition to
make the dying declaration, look up to the medical opinion, but where eye-witnesses
state that the deceased was in a fit and conscious state to make the declaration, the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169680882/ 13
Manjan Mahto And Anr vs The State Of Bihar on 14 October, 2025
medical opinion will not prevail.
(7) The Magistrate being a disinterested witness and a responsible officer and there
being no circumstances or material to suspect that the Magistrate had any animus
against the accused or was in any way interested in fabricating a dying declaration,
question of doubt in declaration recorded by the Magistrate does not arise."
Subsequently, the finding has been recorded in paragraph 41, 43 to 45 of the said judgement, which
reads as Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.285 of 2016 dt. 16-10-2025 under :-
"41. Keeping in view the aforesaid decisions and the principles laid down by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in various decisions, if the facts as discussed hereinabove are
examined, it would reveal that, in the present case, the prosecution-witnesses have
deposed before the Court with regard to the version of Kamala Devi (deceased) stated
before them immediately after the occurrence took place. One of the witnesses stated
that appellant No.2 poured boiling water on Kamala Devi and thereafter appellant
No.1 Mukul set the house on fire. There is no evidence from where appellant No.2
brought the boiling water. When it was a foggy cold night, at about 1- 1:30 a.m., when
the incident took place, what was the source of light to identify the accused is also not
brought on record. Further, the incident took place in the 1-2 room house and when
Sarang Dhar died on the spot in the incident Kamala Devi also sustained serious burn
injuries and, therefore, when she was taken to the hospital whether she was
conscious or not. The dying declaration, in the form of fardbeyan contains minute
details, including the dispute with regard to land as well as the incident which took
place 15-20 days prior to the incident. In the fardbeyan Kamala Devi said that when
she tried to save her husband, she also sustained burn injuries whereas the witnesses
have stated a Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.285 of 2016 dt. 16-10-2025
different story. Dying declaration given by Kamala Devi before the Executive
Magistrate contains the exactly similar details which is not possible when the person
has sustained serious burn injuries. From the deposition of the Executive Magistrate,
it is revealed that when he reached to the hospital, the Investigating Officer narrated
the entire story to him and while recording the dying declaration of the injured
Kamala Devi, villagers were also present. Therefore also, there are all chances of
tutoring.
43. Surprisingly, the dying declaration of the deceased was recorded by the
Investigating Officer and the Executive Magistrate has merely signed the same. Even
there are two versions with regard to the recording of dying declaration. At one place
it is stated that the Investigating Officer has recorded the dying declaration whereas
at another place the Executive Magistrate has stated that the dying declaration is in
his handwriting. Thus, it raises serious doubt. The dying declarations recorded by the
Executive Magistrate is not in question-answer format. Ordinarily it should be in the
question- answer format.

Manjan Mahto And Anr vs The State Of Bihar on 14 October, 2025
44. It is the specific defence of the accused (appellant No.1) in the statement under
Section-313 of Cr.P.C. that he has been falsely implicated by his brother, uncle and
Najo Yadav because of the land-dispute and they wanted to Patna High Court CR.
APP (DB) No.285 of 2016 dt. 16-10-2025 grab the land. Admittedly, after the death of
the parents, the aforesaid three persons have taken over the possession of the land.
45. Thus, looking to the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the present case and the
evidence led by the prosecution, we are of the view that we cannot simply rely upon
the dying declarations given by the deceased Kamala Devi to the police as well as to
the Executive Magistrate. 46. Thus, from the aforesaid deposition of the
prosecution-witnesses, we are of the view that there are major contradictions,
inconsistencies and improvements in the deposition of the prosecution-witnesses. 47.
Thus, the prosecution has failed to prove its case against the appellants beyond
reasonable doubt, despite which the Trial Court has recorded the judgment of
conviction and order of sentence which require to be quashed and set aside."
31. Keeping in view the aforesaid decisions and the principles laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court of India in various judgments mentioned above, as well as from the facts discussed in the
present appeal, it is revealed that in this case, there are in total 14 prosecution witnesses, out of
which the evidence of 10 prosecution witnesses is of no value as they have turned hostile. The
evidence of the doctor who conducted the post-mortem has only indicated the cause of death, while
the Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.285 of 2016 dt. 16-10-2025 evidence of the Investigating
Officer (PW-13) and the recorder of the alleged dying declaration (PW-14) is most relevant. The
recorder of the dying declaration, in his cross-examination, has deposed that the victim could not
narrate the entire incident, and he did not obtain any certificate from the doctor regarding the
victim's mental condition to confirm her fitness to give a statement. He further stated that he did
not remember whether the doctor was present at the time of recording the statement or not.
Although he claimed to have asked the victim whether she was in a fit state to give a statement,
though this fact was not mentioned in the recorded statement.
32. On the other hand, the brother of the victim, who is also the informant in this case, has deposed
in his cross- examination that while he was carrying his sister from Lauriya to Bettiah, she disclosed
to him that she was burnt by a stove.
33. Surprisingly, the dying declaration of the deceased was recorded by the Block Agriculture Officer
and signed by the Investigating Officer, yet contradictions are apparent in their testimonies before
the Court. The Investigating Officer deposed that the room in which the dead body was found was
locked from inside and had to be broken open in the presence of villagers. PW-14, the Block
Agriculture Officer Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.285 of 2016 dt. 16-10-2025 who recorded
the dying declaration, admitted that no doctor was present at the time of recording, nor was any
medical certificate obtained regarding the fitness of the deceased to make such a statement either by
a doctor or by himself. Therefore, it raises serious doubt about the genuineness of the dying
declaration. Furthermore, the dying declaration was not recorded in a question-and-answer format,
which ordinarily should have been the case.

Manjan Mahto And Anr vs The State Of Bihar on 14 October, 2025
34. On the basis of the discussions made above and the evidence led by the prosecution, we are of
the view that there exist major contradictions, inconsistencies, and improvements in the depositions
of the prosecution witnesses particularly PW 13 and PW 14. Thus, the prosecution has failed to
prove its case against the appellants beyond reasonable doubt. Despite this, the learned Trial Court
recorded the judgment of conviction and order of sentence, which are unsustainable in law and,
therefore, are liable to be quashed and set aside.
35. Accordingly, the impugned Judgment of Conviction dated 2nd March, 2016, and the Order of
Sentence dated 5th March, 2016, passed by the learned 2nd Additional Sessions Judge, West
Champaran, Bettiah, in Sessions Trial No. Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.285 of 2016 dt.
16-10-2025 555 of 2014 arising out of Lauriya P.S. Case No. 05 of 2014 corresponding to G.R. Case
No. 139 of 2004, are hereby quashed and set aside. The appellants are acquitted of the charges
levelled against them by the learned Trial Court.
36. Since appellant no. 1, Manjan Mahto, is presently in judicial custody, he is directed to be
released forthwith from jail, if not required in connection with any other case. So far as appellant no.
2, Samtola Devi, wife of Ramuna Mahto, is concerned, since she is on bail, her bail bond stands
cancelled and the sureties are hereby discharged from their liabilities.
37. In result, the appeal stands allowed. Accordingly, Interlocutory Application No. 01/2024 also
stands disposed of, having become infructuous.
