ii) Declaring that the building permission in respect of the building namely Gopal Bhawan situated
at Kachi Chhowni, Jammu is deemed to be accorded to the petitioner by the respondents.
iii) Prohibiting the respondents including their employees and agents from interfering in the
peaceful execution of development, renovation, strengthening and construction work of the property
namely Gopal Bhawan situated at Kachi Chhowni, Jammu as per the proposed plan.
3. The aforesaid reliefs came to be prayed by the petitioner on the premise that he purchased a
commercial property, namely, "Gopal Bhawan"
situated at Kachi Chhowani, Jammu (for short â€žthe property(cid:129)) in an auction ordered
by the High Court on 12.02.2009 for an amount of Rs.1,51,00,000/- and after the
purchase of the same, petitioner applied to the respondent 2 for grant of building
permission under Section 4 of the J&K Control of Building Operation Act, 1988 (for
short 'the Act of 1988'). The petitioner claimed to have completed all requisite
formalities in this regard with the respondents besides having deposited an amount
of Rs.1,49,065/- with the respondents as requisite building permission fee, besides
depositing an amount of Rs.6,000/- for malba security.
The petitioner contended in the petition that the respondents, however, did not
dispose of his permission case within statutory time frame, as a consequence whereof
the petitioner intended to undertake constructional activities on spot under the guise
of deemed permission provided under Regulation 7 of the Regulations framed under
the Act of 1988 and simultaneously filed OWP No. 474/2013 before this Court as the
petitioner was not allowed to carry on constructional activities, which writ petition
came to be disposed of on 25.10.2013 in presence of the counsel for the 3 CM
2169/2023 in OWP 1947/2014 respondents directing the respondent-authority to
take a decision on the petitioner(cid:129)s proposal in accordance with law, rules,
regulations and Master Plan while reserving a right for the petitioner to seek
appropriate remedy in the event cause arises. The aforesaid order dated 25.10.2013
passed by the Court was stated to have not been complied with by the respondents,
resulting into filing of the Contempt petition bearing No. 08/2014, in response
whereof, the respondents filed a statement of facts along with order dated 24.04.2014
informing the petitioner that no building permission for roof replacement can be
issued owing to the dismantling of the building (Old Structure), for which the
building permission for raising fresh construction after dismantling the old structure,
the petitioner had to apply afresh.
4. Aggrieved of the communication dated 24.04.2014 supra the petitioner maintained
OWP No. 1947/2014 supra, whereunder the instant application has arisen. The said
writ petition 1947/2014 came to be finally disposed of by this Court on 22.11.2021
with the following operative portion:

"Having regard to what has been observed, considered and analyzed hereinabove, the
writ petition deserves to be allowed and is accordingly allowed. The respondents are
commanded to accord consideration for grant of building permission in favour of the
petitioner for erection of the building having been applied for on 18.02.2013 under
receipt No. 9123 on the premise of "deemed permission" contemplated under
Regulation 7(iii) of the Regulations, 2001, subject to the conditions contained in
clause (a) to (j) appended thereto, within a period of two months from the date copy
of the judgment is served upon the respondents, uninfluenced of the impugned order
dated 24.04.2014."
4 CM 2169/2023 in OWP 1947/2014
5. It is being stated in the instant application that instead of Regulations of 2001, Regulations of
1998 were applicable to the case and that the said mistake needs to be rectified.
Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.
6. It is pertinent to note here that while disposing of the petition supra as above, admittedly this
Court referred to Regulation 7(iii) of the Regulations of 2001 instead of Regulation 7 of the
Regulations of 1998 also framed under Section 19 of the Act of 1988, as Regulations of 2001 had
been issued for Municipal Limit of Srinagar/Local Area of Srinagar outside the limits of Srinagar
Municipal when infact the Regulations of 1998 were applicable to the case of the petitioner being
admittedly not falling within the Municipal Limits of Srinagar/Local Area of Srinagar, but within the
Municipal Limits of Jammu.
7. The Court at para 16 of the judgment after referring to Sections 4 and 5 of the Act wrongly
referred to the Regulation 7 of the Regulations 2001 instead of the Regulation 7 of the Regulations of
1998.
8. In view of aforesaid position, the instant application merits to be allowed. Accordingly, para 16 of
the judgment is recasts as under:-
"16.Before adverting to the controversy involved in the petition it would be
advantageous and appropriate to refer to the relevant provisions of the Act and the
Regulations being germane herein.
Section 4 of the Act reads as under: -
4. Control of development and building operation.-No person shall undertake or
