02/07/2021 Madurai Bench of this Court dismissed the bail application in Crl.O.P.No.4951 of 2021
to renew his application before the Special Court for NIA cases as investigation is taken over by NIA.
Application filed by the respondent for bail in Crl.M.P.No.222 of 2021 u/s.439 Cr.P.C. and counter
filed by appellant. 03/09/2021 Orders passed by Special Judge releasing the respondent herein on
bail.
3. Challenging the order of bail that was granted by the Special Court under the National
Investigation Agency Act in Crl.M.P.No.222 of 2021 dated 03.09.2021, the National Investigation
Agency has filed the present appeal.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Criminal Appeal No.485 of 2021
4. Heard Mr.R.Karthikeyan, learned Special Public Prosecutor appearing for the appellant and
Mr.SMA.Jinnah, learned counsel appearing for the respondent/accused.
5. The entire case falls in a very narrow compass. It is seen that while the respondent/accused was
being remanded to judicial custody from time to time by the learned Judicial Magistrate V, Madurai,
the Assistant Commissioner of Police, Special Investigation Cell, Madurai, appears to have filed an
application u/s.43D(2)(b) of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, for extending the period
of remand from 90 days to 180 days. On this application, on 02.03.2021, the learned Magistrate has
extended the period of remand from 90 days to 180 days. The learned Magistrate has also dismissed
the default bail application of the respondent/accused in Crl.M.P.No.999 of 2021 on 03.03.2021 on
the ground that he had extended the remand period from 90 days to 180 days.
6. This, in our considered opinion, is legally vitiated inasmuch as the application for extension of
remand period u/s.43D(2)(b) of the Unlawful https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Criminal Appeal
No.485 of 2021 Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, should have been filed by the Public Prosecutor
and not by the Investigating Officer. That apart, the said application should have been filed before
the Special Court or Sessions Court, as the case may be and not before the learned Judicial
Magistrate V, Madurai, since the offences alleged against the respondent/accused are under the
43D(2)(b) of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967. This issue is no more res integra and
stands settled by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Bikramjit Singh v. State of Punjab1. The law laid
down in Birkamjit Singh's case is reiterated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Sadique & others v.
State of Madhya Pradesh2
7. Based on the extension of remand, the State as well National Investigation Agency has conducted
investigation and have collected several materials against the respondent/accused. Of course, the
materials so collected will not stand vitiated just because they were collected during the period when
the remand was erroneously extended by the learned Judicial Magistrate V, Madurai.

8. In India, illegally collected evidence will not by itself stand vitiated as held by the Constitution
Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Pooran Mal v. Director of Inspection (Investigation), New
Delhi and others3.
9. We do not find any infirmity in the impugned order of bail that has been granted by the learned
Special Judge for NIA cases, Poonamallee, vide order dated 03.09.2021 in Crl.M.P.No.222 of 2021,
warranting interference in appeal.
In the result, this Criminal Appeal is devoid of merits and accordingly, the same is dismissed.
