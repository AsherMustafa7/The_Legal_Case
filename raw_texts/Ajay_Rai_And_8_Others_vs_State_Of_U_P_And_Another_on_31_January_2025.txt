Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/143273888/ 1
Ajay Rai And 8 Others vs State Of U.P. And Another on 31 January, 2025
for quashing the entire proceedings of Case No. 3081 of 2021 (State vs. Ajay Rai and others), arising
out of Case Crime No. 57 of 2021, under Sections 188, 323, 147, 504, 171-E of Indian Penal Code,
P.S. Uldan, Jhansi, as well as cognizance/summoning order dated 16.9.2021, pending in the court of
Judicial Magistrate/Civil Judge (Junior Division), Mauranipur, Jhansi, on the basis of compromise
executed between the parties on 27.6.2024.
2. Learned counsel for the parties jointly submitted that the parties settled their dispute out of the
Court by way of compromise dated 27.06.2024, which has been verified by the court concerned on
7.10.2024. Certified copy of compromise deed as well as proceedings of verification is filed as
Annexure No. SA-1 of the supplementary affidavit to compromise the offence punishable under the
aforementioned sections. It is further submitted that both the parties are neighbour (padosi) of
same village. On being arrived at mutual consent, both the parties have come to terms and decided
to settle their dispute, therefore, no useful purpose would be served to keep the matter alive and
pending the present case be finally decided.
3. Learned counsel for opposite party nos. 2 also submits that as the applicants and opposite party
no. 2 has already arrived at amicable settlement on 27.6.2024, therefore, opposite party no. 2 is no
more interested to pursue the case any more against the applicants.
4. Heard Sri Pavan Kumar, learned counsel for the applicants, Sri Santosh Kumar Singh, learned
counsel for the opposite party no. 2 and learned A.G.A. for the State and perused the material on
record.
5. Present matter is related to offence under the aforementioned sections, both the parties entered
into a amicable settlement, and fact of compromise has been confirmed and admitted by learned
counsel for the parties and has jointly submitted that in the interest of justice the proceedings may
be quashed in the light of the compromise.
6. A three-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab & another, (2012) 10
SCC 303, has observed that: (SCC p.340, para 58) "58. Where the High Court quashes a criminal
proceeding having regard to the fact that the dispute between the offender and the victim has been
settled although the offences are not compoundable, it does so as in its opinion, continuation of
criminal proceedings will be an exercise in futility and justice in the case demands that the dispute
between the parties is put to an end and peace is resorted; securing the ends of justice being the
ultimate guiding factor.."
7. Where matters are also of civil nature i.e. matrimonial, family disputes, etc. the Court may
consider "special facts", "special feature" and quash the criminal proceeding to encourage genuine
settlement of disputes between the parties. [Vide: Madhavrao Jiwajirao Scindia v. Sambhajirao
Chandraojirao Angre, (1988) 1 SCC 692].
8. In Parbathbhai Aahir @ Parbatbhai Bhimsinghbhai Karmur & Others v. State of Gujarat &
another, (2017) 9 SCC 641, after referring the various precedents on the subject, summarized the
broad principles relating to the inherent jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code as under; (SCC,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/143273888/ 2
Ajay Rai And 8 Others vs State Of U.P. And Another on 31 January, 2025
p. 653, para 16) "16.1. Section 482 preserves the inherent powers of the High Court to prevent an
abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. The provision does not confer new
powers. It only recognises and preserves powers which inhere in the High Court.
16.2. The invocation of the jurisdiction of the High Court to quash a first information report or a
criminal proceeding on the ground that a settlement has been arrived at between the offender and
the victim is not the same as the invocation of jurisdiction for the purpose of compounding an
offence. While compounding an offence, the power of the court is governed by the provisions of
Section 320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The power to quash under Section 482 is
attracted even if the offence is non-compoundable.
16.3. In forming an opinion whether a criminal proceeding or complaint should be quashed in
exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 482, the High Court must evaluate whether the ends of
justice would justify the exercise of the inherent power.
16.4. While the inherent poser of the High Court has a wide ambit and plenitude it has to be
exercised (i) to secure the ends of justice, or (ii) to prevent an abuse of the process of any court.
16.5. The decision as to whether a complaint or first information report should be quashed on the
ground that the offender and victim have settled the dispute, revolves ultimately on the facts and
circumstances of each case and no exhaustive elaboration of principles can be formulated.
16.6. In the exercise of the power under Section 482 and while dealing with a plea that the dispute
has been settled, the High Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the offence.
Heinous and serious offences involving mental depravity or offences such as murder, rape and
dacoity cannot appropriately be quashed though the victim or the family or the victim have settled
the dispute. Such offences are, truly speaking, not private in nature but have a serious impact upon
society. The decision to continue with the trial in such cases is founded on the overriding element of
public interest in punishing persons for serious offences.
16.7. As distinguished from serious offences, there may be criminal cases which have an
overwhelming or predominant element of a civil dispute. They stand on a distinct footing insofar as
the exercise of the inherent power to quash is concerned.
16.8. Criminal Cases involving offences which arise from commercial, financial, mercantile,
partnership or similar transactions with an essentially civil flavour may in appropriate situations fall
for quashing where parties have settled the dispute.
16.9. In such a case, the High Court may quash the criminal proceeding if in view of the compromise
between the disputants, the possibility of a conviction is remote and the continuation of a criminal
proceeding would case oppression and prejudice; and 16.10. There is yet an exception to the
principle set out in propositions 16.8. and 16.9. above. Economic offence involving the financial and
economic well-being of the State have implications which lie beyond the domain of a mere dispute
between private disputants. The High Court would be justified in declining to quash where the

offender is involved in an activity akin to a financial or economic fraud or misdemeanour. The
consequences of the act complained of upon the financial or economic system will weigh in the
balance."
9. Keeping in mind the position of law and facts, circumstances of the case, the present application
under Section 482 of the Code stands allowed.
10. The entire proceedings relating to proceedings of Case No. 3081 of 2021 (State vs. Ajay Rai and
others), arising out of Case Crime No. 57 of 2021, under Sections 188, 323, 147, 504, 171-E of Indian
Penal Code, P.S. Uldan, Jhansi, as well as cognizance/summoning order dated 16.9.2021, pending in
the court of Judicial Magistrate/Civil Judge (Junior Division), Mauranipur, Jhansi, are hereby
quashed.
11. This order is being passed by this Court after hearing the contesting parties and perusing the
affidavit filed by the applicants. If at all, opposite party no. 2 feels that he has been duped or
betrayed, then in that event, he may file recall application explaining the reasons for filing the said
application.
12. The parties may file the certified copy of this order before the court concerned within four weeks
from today.
