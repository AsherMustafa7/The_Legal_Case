5. Without the completion of training and within
one year of his appointment, the petitioner was posted as
an Executive Magistrate, Tekari in the district of Gaya in
the year 2002 as there was an acute shortage of officers
in the department. It further appears that the petitioner
successfully cleared all the departmental examination for
the purposes of his confirmation in service but the letter of
confirmation in favour of the petitioner was not issued
whereas many other officers were confirmed after
completion of two years of service. If further appears that
because of an order passed in a writ petition bearing no.
C.W.J.C. No. 7221 of 2003, an enquiry was initiated
against the District Magistrate, Gaya and the petitioner but
the enquiry as against the petitioner was conducted behind
his back. Nonetheless, vide letter dated 06.02.2006, the
services of the petitioner was confirmed with effect from
26.06.2005
. However, within three months, the notification of the confirmation of the petitioner was cancelled
by order dated 04.05.2006, contained in Memo No. 4011, issued under the signature of Deputy
Secretary on the ground of pendency of a charge against the petitioner.
6. It further appears from the records that the way back in the year 2004, a show cause notice was
issued to the petitioner by the Deputy Commissioner, Patna High Court CWJC No.16341 of 2017
dt.11-03-2019 Magadh Division and the petitioner in response to the aforesaid show cause notice
had demanded certain papers which were never made available to him. During the pendency of the
aforesaid proceeding, the petitioner was posted as BDO, Tekari, Gaya between 17.05.2003 to
11.08.2003 when he was given some papers which he had demanded and on the basis of the
aforesaid documents, he had replied to the show cause notice. The reply was not accepted by the
General Administration Department and the petitioner was again asked to reply on the basis of
papers which were made available to him.
7. It is relevant to mention that thereafter no correspondence was made with the petitioner even
after his confirmation of his service for a brief period and its subsequent withdrawal.
8. The petitioner thereafter approached this Court vide C.W.J.C. No. 8414 of 2013 and a bench of
this Court vide order dated 01.05.2014, after expressing its displeasure over the manner in which
the counter affidavit in the aforesaid case was filed, directed the Principal Secretary, General
Administration Department, Government of Bihar, Patna to examine the case of the petitioner and
pass an appropriate order within three months of the passing of the order by the Court. Patna High
Court CWJC No.16341 of 2017 dt.11-03-2019
9. It further appears from the records that the representation of the petitioner, on the strength of the
order passed by the High Court referred above, was rejected by the Principal Secretary, General
Administration Department, Government of Bihar, Patna vide his order dated 15.01.2015 stating
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/71977739/ 2
Ram Janam Paswan vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 11 March, 2019
that the charges against the petitioner was found to be prima facie true and that in view of the
Government order dated 16.12.1998 contained in Order No. 467, holding that a person can be
confirmed in service if no prima facie charge is proved against him within the period of probation.
Since the proceeding against the petitioner was pending, therefore, it was held that the notification
regarding confirmation of the service of the petitioner was withdrawn. The sum and substance of the
order of the Principal Secretary, therefore, was that the petitioner could not be confirmed because of
the pendency of the departmental proceeding against him.
10. In the meantime, the enquiry report against the petitioner was submitted by the Divisional
Enquiry Commissioner and the petitioner was asked for his second show cause to which he replied.
11. By order dated 31.10.2016, the petitioner has been subjected to a punishment of withholding of
increment with cumulative effect and debarment of Patna High Court CWJC No.16341 of 2017
dt.11-03-2019 promotion to him for four years from the date when it is due.
12. Apart from various other contentions raised on behalf of the petitioner regarding the faulty
handling of the departmental proceeding against the petitioner, what has actually been stressed
upon is that despite the punishment of stoppage of increment of pay and debarment of promotion
for four years, the petitioner has a right to be confirmed and his confirmation cannot be kept
pending for the period when the punishment given to him on 31.10.2016 loses its effect only after
the passage of four years.
13. The submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner is that confirmation and promotion are
two different things and one cannot be made dependent on the other.
14. It is necessary in this context to be aware of the reason for an employee to be kept under
probation for a particular period. Probation refers to the period when an appointee to a service is on
a trial for a particular period.
15. In Ajit Singh vs. State of Punjab AIR reported in 1983 SC 494, it was explained by the Supreme
Court that the importance of probation lies in confirming the relationship of master and servant, the
idea behind being that an employer cannot be thrust upon the Patna High Court CWJC No.16341 of
2017 dt.11-03-2019 services of an employee who is not capable in the estimation of the employer. A
probationer does not acquire any substantive right to the post during the period of probation and his
services can be terminated any time during the probationary period and before his confirmation.
Thus, the period of probation is a transitory period and right of an employee to continue in service
would only accrue on his confirmation in service.
16. Normally the period of probation is for a particular period and a probationer is entitled to be
considered for confirmation upon the successful completion of probation.
17. Confirmation in service actually means obtaining permanent status of a civil servant. Though it
may depend upon the decision of the employer but it is too late in the day to say that any decision of
the employer, even if arbitrary or irrational would be accepted. The initial view in the service
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/71977739/ 3
Ram Janam Paswan vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 11 March, 2019
jurisprudence of the complete autonomy of an employer in matters of confirming service of an
inductee has now undergone a major change and it is no longer dependent upon the capricious will
of an employer. Confirmation in service is required to be exposited by an order but there are
instances of deemed confirmation also which has gained acceptance in the service jurisprudence.
Patna High Court CWJC No.16341 of 2017 dt.11-03-2019
18. In the case of the petitioner, the letter of confirmation was issued but the same was withdrawn
on the sole premise of a departmental proceeding which was initiated during the probationary
period, being pending. The proceeding continued for more than one and a half decades and the
petitioner continued to render services. What is to be noted is that during the period of probation, if
the services of the petitioner was not found to be satisfactory, he could have been terminated on
grounds of unsuitability or of any charge having been proved against him. However, the
confirmation of a civil servant cannot be kept pending for such a long period of time as if it is the
punishment meted out to him. For an appointee to be punished, he is definitely required to be in
substantive service. As long as the petitioner is under probation and his services are not found to be
satisfactory, he can be terminated from service. But if he has been subjected to a departmental
proceeding in which, as is in the case of the petitioner, he has been punished with the lowering of his
pay scale and debarment of promotion, it presupposes that the service of the petitioner has been
confirmed and the terms of the punishment is proscription of consideration for promotion for a
considerable period. Patna High Court CWJC No.16341 of 2017 dt.11-03-2019
19. This punishment cannot be a ground for withholding the confirmation of the petitioner which
has a totally different connotation.
20. The supplementary counter affidavit filed on behalf of the State merely states that because of the
punishment meted out to the petitioner on 31.10.2016, prohibiting promotion to him for a period of
four years, to be counted from the date of the order of punishment, the services of the petitioner
cannot be confirmed.
21. This, in the opinion of this Court, is a distorted impact of the punishment which has been given
to the petitioner. The petitioner would have the liberty to challenge the aforesaid punishment but
the same cannot be made the basis for withholding confirmation of his service. It appears rather
strange that a person has been made to work since 2001, awaiting his confirmation in service.
22. While saying so, this Court has not expressed any opinion over the manner in which the
departmental proceeding was conducted; the delay in concluding the aforesaid proceeding and the
subjective merit of the decision of the authorities arrived at. What this Court has taken note of is
that bar to promotion for a particular number of years is different from holding back the Patna High
Court CWJC No.16341 of 2017 dt.11-03-2019 confirmation of the petitioner after he has rendered his
service for several years.
23. It would be a complete non-application of mind to allow the decision with respect to the
confirmation of the service of the petitioner to be linked with the terms of punishment meted out to
the petitioner on 31.10.2016.

Ram Janam Paswan vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 11 March, 2019
24. Under the aforesaid circumstances, this Court directs the petitioner to make a representation
before the Principal Secretary, General Administration Department within a period of four weeks
from today along with a copy of this order, who shall, on receipt of such representation take a
decision with respect to issuance of an order of confirmation of the petitioner in service.
25. This Court is conscious of the fact that confirmation is dependent on there being no charge
pending during the probationary period but in the case of the petitioner, such condition cannot be
imposed because of the passage of such long time in concluding the departmental proceeding and
the petitioner having completed his probationary period with all the riders of the clearing the
departmental examination.
26. The concerned respondent shall pass necessary orders in accordance with law within a period of
six weeks thereafter.
Patna High Court CWJC No.16341 of 2017 dt.11-03-2019
27. With the aforesaid direction/observation, the writ petition is disposed of.
