CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE AJAY KUMAR TRIPATHI
ORAL JUDGMENT
Date: 05-04-2016 The petitioners are students of M.A. in Social Work and they took admission for
the session 2013-15. They have been compelled to file the present writ application because the
respondent- Patna University authorities would not evaluate the answer sheet of the 4th semester
and declare their result. Communication in this regard is dated 25.06.2015 and annexed as
Annexure-13.
2. The six petitioners do not dispute the basic facts that 2 Patna High Court CWJC No.12633 of 2015
dt.05-04-2016 as students of the 1st semester, they did not clear the requisite papers, therefore, they
were not entitled to be promoted to the 2nd semester. But it was not so. The petitioners were

allowed to pursue their studies in the 2nd semester, sit for the examination which they cleared. They
cleared the examination of the 3rd semester as well and reached the 4th semester. In the meantime,
they had cleared even the papers of the 1st semester and it is only at the stage of 4th semester that
the respondent authorities of the Patna University discover that these petitioners ought not to have
been promoted to the 2nd semester or allowed to sit for the examination since they had not cleared
the 1st semester examination.
3. The explanation offered by the petitioners for sitting in the 2nd semester is that the result for the
1st semester was delayed. They took admission in the 2nd semester. There was no objection raised
by the University authorities. On completion of the course they applied and they sat for the
examination in which they were declared pass. This went on till they reached the final semester.
Now the University authorities want to invoke their powers under the Ordinance and Regulation
with regard to the conduct of the courses and not evaluate the answer sheet of the 4th semester and
declare their results.
4. Counsel representing the University has explained 3 Patna High Court CWJC No.12633 of 2015
dt.05-04-2016 the position in detail as to the reason why they decided not to evaluate the answer
sheet of these petitioners for the 4th semester. They have brought on record the requisite Regulation
and the Ordinance which govern such issue but they fail to answer as to how the petitioners were
permitted to continue their studies right from 2nd semester till the 4th semester without such a fact
having been discovered.
5. Counsel for the petitioners presses into service a decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court rendered in
the case of Shri Krishan v. The Kurukshetra University, Kurukshetra, reported in AIR 1976 SC 376.
Counsel for the petitioners draws the attention of this Court to paragraph-6 of the said decision. The
relevant parts reads as under:
"The last part of this statute clearly shows that the University could withdraw the
certificate if the applicant had failed to attend the prescribed course of lectures. But
this could be done only before the examination. It is, therefore, manifest that once
the appellant was allowed to take the examination, rightly or wrongly, then the
statute which empowers the University to withdraw the candidature of the applicant
has worked itself out and the applicant cannot be refused admission subsequently for
any infirmity which should have been looked into before giving the applicant
permission to appear."
6. The law laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the Kurukshetra University (supra) case also
applies to the facts of the present case. If the respondent-University authorities wanted to invoke the
powers under the Ordinance, it should have been done so in the 2nd semester itself. They have
themselves allowed the students 4 Patna High Court CWJC No.12633 of 2015 dt.05-04-2016 to
continue the studies till the final semester and they cannot now discover and withhold their
evaluation and non-declaration of result for violating the procedure and the Regulation by the
petitioners.

7. Examinations have been conducted by the University, forms have been accepted by the University
and results for other semester have been declared by the University all along without invoking such
power.
8. It is too late in the day, keeping in mind the principle laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court to
withhold the non- declaration of their result for the final semester specially when the petitioners
have cleared all the papers of every semester except the 4th semester for which evaluation has not
been done. The Court directs the Vice-Chancellor as well as the Controller of Examination to ensure
that the evaluation of the answer sheet of these petitioners is done within a period of six weeks and
results declared within a period of eight weeks.
9. The time frame indicated above must be adhered to. Writ application is allowed.
