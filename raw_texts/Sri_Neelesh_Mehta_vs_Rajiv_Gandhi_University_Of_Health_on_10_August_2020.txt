ORDER
In all these petitions, the students of MBBS Course are grieving against the "Ordinance Governing
Undergraduate evaluation of answer scripts" 2019 promulgated by the respondent - University
through it's Syndicate vide Notification dated 29.03.2019; the said Ordinance which is made
effective from 01.03.2019 provides for Deviation Valuation to be conducted by the third evaluator
where the difference of marks awarded by the two evaluators inter se is 15% or more of the
maximum marks prescribed for the paper in question. After service of notice, the
respondent-University having entered appearance through its Sr. Panel Counsel resists the writ
petitions by filing a common Statement of Objections.
2. All these cases have common questions of facts & law, with little differences that do not much
matter to adjudicating and therefore, all they have been taken up together for hearing and disposal
by a common judgment, as suggested by the counsel. Having heard the learned counsel for the
parties and having perused the petition papers and also having adverted to the only relevant rulings
cited at the Bar, this Court grants moulded relief to the petitioners in view of the following
discussion:

(a) Para 3 (ii) of Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences (Provision for double

"ii. All answer papers wherein the difference in award of marks between the first and
second value is 20% or more of the maximum marks prescribed for that paper, shall
be referred to a third examiner appointed by the Vice-Chancellor chosen from the

the final marks to be awarded for declaration of result. If the difference between any
of the two valuations out of the three is same, then the award for declaration of result
shall be chosen to the best advantage of the candidate. In all other cases, the average
of the marks awarded by the first and second valuers shall be taken as final."
(b) 2010 Ordinance Governing Revaluation: The 2010 "Ordinance Governing Revaluation",
promulgated vide Notification dated 23.03.2010 introduced the revaluation system by the 3rd and
5th examiners for U.G. and P.G. examinations respectively. Paragraph 4 of the said Ordinance reads

"PROCEDURE FOR REVALUATION:
(i) All the answer papers wherein the difference in award of marks between two
valuers and four valuers as the case may be in the general valuation is 15% or more of
the maximum marks prescribed for the paper, shall be referred to a 3rd or 5th
examiner as the case may be for valuation appointed by the Vice-Chancellor chosen
from an approved panel.
(ii) The average of the marks awarded by the 3rd examiner and the marks close to it
in the two general valuations shall be considered for final computation of the results.
(iii) The average of marks awarded by the 5th examiner and the other three marks
close to it amongst the four general valuation marks shall be considered for the final
computation of the results .......".
(c) Paragraph 4 of 2012 "Ordinance Governing Multiple valuation", published vide Notification
dated 15.06.2012 reads as under:
"4. PROCEDURE FOR MULTIPLE VALUATION:
(i) All the answer-papers which are subjected for double valuation, wherein the

THIRD examiner appointed by Vice-Chancellor chosen from an approved panel.
(ii) All the answer-papers which are subjected for four valuations, wherein the
difference in award of marks between FOUR valuations is ≥ 15%, shall be referred to
FIFTH examiner appointed by Vice-Chancellor chosen from an approved panel.
(iii) The average of BEST OF TWO OUT OF THREE VALUATION marks or the

Average of best of two valuation marks shall be considered for final computation of
results after rounding up the fractional mark, if nay, to the next higher whole digit."

Degree and Diploma Courses, paragraph (b) whereof, reads as under:
"b) In the answer paper, if the difference in the marks awarded between four
evaluators is equal to or more than 15%, such answer papers shall be referred to 5th
valuation."
B) Impugned Ordinance promulgated vide Notification dated 29.03.2019:
Some medical students of Undergraduate and Post Graduate Courses had knocked at
the doors of Writ Court in W.P.Nos. 48194-48198/2018 etc., between Dr. Menaka
Mohan Vs. RGUHS ( (2019) 2 KCCR 965) complaining that in terms of June, 2012
Ordinance, the University was not referring their answer scripts for third/fifth
valuation despite the difference between two sets of valuations inter se was 15% or
more; the respondent-University had unsuccessfully resisted those writ petitions
contending that the prescribed percentage difference is not as against two valuations
inter se but as against the maximum marks prescribed for the paper in question; this
Court vide judgment dated 21.12.2018, upheld the contention of the students
rejecting the stand of the University and directed for third/fifth valuation.
C) The respondent-University in the above backdrop of the facts has promulgated the
impugned Ordinance which governs the examination conducted on or after
01.03.2019; by virtue of this new Ordinance, all the other extant Ordinances
concerning the matter stand repealed and the 15% difference is now made as against
the maximum marks prescribed for the paper in question and not between two sets of
evaluations; this is put in challenge in these writ petitions.
4) The challenge to the impugned Ordinance is inter alia on the grounds of legislative competence,
arbitrariness, retrospectivity, non-publication, procedural infirmities and repugnancy with the
extant MCI Regulations; it is also contended that the impugned Ordinance does not address the
cases of extreme erratic valuations and therefore Writ Court should not refrain from granting relief
to the victims de horse Ordinance in such matters; arguments are also advanced for reading down of
the Ordinance; the Ordinance is apparently repugnant to the provisions of Graduate Medical
Education Regulations, 1997 promulgated by the Medical Council of India u/s 33 of the Indian
Medical Council Act, 1956, the same is liable to be struck down on that sole ground as has been
discussed below; thus in the considered opinion of this Court there is no need for undertaking the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/141543728/ 71
Sri Neelesh Mehta vs Rajiv Gandhi University Of Health ... on 10 August, 2020
examination of all other contentions and the rulings pressed into service in support thereof.
5) The impugned Ordinance in the case of undergraduates provides for deviation valuation by the
third evaluator if the difference of marks awarded by the two inter se is 15% or more of the
maximum marks prescribed for the paper in question; thus, this Ordinance is structured apparently
on the premise that all the answer scripts of Undergraduates are liable to be subjected to valuation
by only two evaluators, whereas, Regulation 13(2) of the Regulations on Graduate Medical
Education, 1997 mandate valuation by the four; this contention of the petitioners is seconded by
learned Sr. Panel Counsel for the MCI; in fact, the University has adopted the system of valuation by
four evaluators in respect of practical examinations carrying 20% of the total marks for the
Undergraduates; learned counsel for the University seeks to justify the lapse on the part of the
University in not adopting the same method in respect of Theory Papers as well, on the assumed
unavailability of enough number of Evaluators; it is too feeble a justification for disobeying the
mandate of law;
6) There is a lot of force in the argument of the petitioners that the aforesaid Regulation 13(2) of
1997 Regulations is in substance pari materia, notwithstanding little textual variance with
Regulation 14(1)(b) of the MCI Post Graduate Medical Education Regulations, 2000; both the
Regulations are reproduced below in juxtaposition:
13(2) There shall be at least four examiners for 100 students, out of whom not less
than 50% must be external examiners of the four examiners, the senior most internal
examiner will act as the Chairman and Coordinator of the whole examination
program so that uniformity in the matter of assessment of candidates is maintained.
Where candidates appearing are more than 100, one additional examiner, for every
additional 50 are part thereof candidates appearing, be appointed.
14(1)(b) For all Postgraduate examinations, the minimum number of Examiners shall
be four, out of which at least two (50%) shall be External Examiners, who shall be
invited from other recognized Universities from outside the State. Two sets of
internal examiners may be appointed one for M.D./M.S. and one for Diploma.
Regulation 14(1)(b) has been considered by a Coordinate Bench of this Court vide
judgment dated 27.09.2016 in W.P.No.49749/2016 etc., between Dr. Haritha
Ravipati Vs. RGUHS; the learned Judge having considered all aspects of the matter
directed the respondent - University "to conduct fresh evaluation of answer scripts of
all the petitioners who have failed in the subjects ... in accordance with the provisions
of Regulation 14(1)(b)..."; this judgment having not been challenged has attained
finality, is not in dispute.
7) The contention of learned Sr. Panel Counsel for the University that throughout the Country, many
Universities have adopted only Double Valuation Method since very long and that the same method
has been followed by this University too ab inceptio with no complaints whatsoever from the MCI or
the students, is no justification for such a flagrant violation of law; two millenniums ago the great
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/141543728/ 72
Sri Neelesh Mehta vs Rajiv Gandhi University Of Health ... on 10 August, 2020
Roman Lawyer Marcus Tullius Cicero (106-43 B.C.) had said "let heavens fall down, law should be
obeyed..."; this Court is at loss to know as to how despite uniform mandatory legal prescription, the
University could have had one standard for undergraduates and the other for the Postgraduates; to
make it's case worse, the University has been following Four Valuation Method for the
Undergraduate Practical Examinations, which are only for a frugal 20% of total marks prescribed
for the course; however, for the Theory Papers comprising the remaining huge 80%, such a method
is not extended; strange it sounds, but fact it is.
8) The contention of learned Counsel for the University that the subject MCI Regulations have been
amended w.e.f. November, 2019 whereby discretion is vested in the Universities to adopt Double
Valuation Method, does not come to its rescue; the said amendment is in so many words, made
applicable to the Courses commencing from the Academic Year 2019-20 onwards as pointed out by
Prof V.R.Datar; denying relief to the petitioners on the basis of such a prospective Regulation
amounts to this Court, unjustifiably giving retrospective effect, thereto; the MCI being a statutory
expert academic body in it's wisdom, has enacted a policy with prospectife effect by the amendment
in question and this Court has to show due deference to the same; the " catch straw"argument that if
relief is granted to the petitioners, the same may open up the flood gates of litigations is too poor a
ground for denying remedy to the deserving litigants.
In the above circumstances, these writ petitions succeed; a Writ of Certiorari issues quashing the
impugned Ordinance in its entirety; a Writ of Mandamus issues to the respondent-University to
cause valuation of all Theory answer scripts of all the petitioners by a set of Four Evaluators, in
terms of Regulation 13(2) of Graduate Medical Education Regulations, 1997, forthwith.
It needs to be mentioned that the benefit of this judgment should be made extended to all the
similarly circumstanced students who have been failed in the Theory Papers on the basis of
assessment under Double Valuation Method, if they so seek within a reasonable period and without
driving them to the litigation process unnecessarily; it is open to the respondent-University to devise
its own mechanism for giving effect to this judgment.
However, this judgment shall not be construed as warranting a fresh valuation of any Theory Papers
in which the students have already been declared passed/successful.
It is needless to mention that the University shall accomplish valuation by two more evaluators of
the subject answer scripts before the examinations for the next level are notified; the candidates who
do not emerge victorious on account of valuation by two more evaluators may reappear for the
examination in question in accordance with law.
It is open to the University to re-promulgate similar Ordinance if & when it duly adopts Double
Valuation Method under the now amended MCI Regulations, and in accordance with law.
Costs made easy.
