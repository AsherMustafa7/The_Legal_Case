ORDER
******************** In the captioned main writ petition an 'assessment order dated 23.09.2021
bearing reference DIN No.ITBA/AST/S/143(3)/2021-22/1035839283(1)' (hereinafter 'impugned
order' for the sake of convenience and clarity) being an assessment order made under Section 143(3)
read with Section 144B of 'the Income Tax Act, 1961' [hereinafter 'said Act' for the sake of
convenience and brevity] has been assailed.
2. Mr.T.Ramesh, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the counsel on record for writ petitioner
submitted that the impugned order made by the second respondent is liable to be quashed,
notwithstanding very many averments made in the writ affidavit and very many grounds raised in
the writ affidavit, learned counsel in his campaign against the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
impugned order made three pointed submissions and they are as follows:
(a) The registration of the assessee (which according to him) is a registered 'Public
Charitable Trust' under Section 12AA of said Act has been cancelled vide the
impugned order without giving an opportunity to the writ petitioner-assessee;
(b) The benefit of Sections 11 and 12 of said Act vide registration under Section 12AA
of said Act is being given to the writ petitioner-assessee for over thirty years and it
has suddenly been declined;
(c) The impugned order is a non-speaking order and therefore, it calls for
interference in writ jurisdiction.
3. Before I proceed further, it is necessary to give short facts or in other words, factual matrix in a
nutshell containing essential facts that are imperative for appreciating this order. Short facts shorn
of unnecessary particulars are that the writ petitioner-assessee claims to be a public charitable trust
having been so registered vide a Trust deed on the file of Sub-Registrar, Peravurani, Thanjavur
District; that the writ petitioner-assessee applied for registration under Section 11 of said Act,
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis exemption was granted vide letter Ref No.CNo.2039(43)/87; that
approval under Section 80G of said Act was also granted in respect of donations received by the
petitioner under same reference dated 29.12.1988; that the exemption was subsequently renewed
vide letter C No.2039)43)/87 dated 29.09.1992 for the period 05.12.1991 to 31.03.1994; that the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186318774/ 2
Muvendar Trust vs The The Income Tax Officer on 16 December, 2021
exemption was periodically renewed until 31.03.2000 vide communication dated 03.03.1999; that
the writ petitioner-assessee did not seek approval under Section 80G after 31.03.2000 as the
petitioner discontinued taking voluntary contributions and donations from anyone; that the
petitioner's accounts have been regularly audited as required under said Act and the petitioner has
been filing income tax returns along with the audit report as required under Section 12A(b) of said
Act from the year of grant of registration under Section 12A of said Act; that the impugned order was
preceded by a notice under Section 143(2) of said Act being notice dated 30.09.2020 and the writ
petitioner-assessee uploaded its reply saying that registration under Section 12AA of said Act had
not been cancelled; that there were two reminders thereafter from the second respondent i.e.,
Department dated 25.02.2021 and 30.08.2021 requesting the writ petitioner-assessee to upload the
registration certificate but the writ petitioner-assessee did https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis not
respond; that thereafter the impugned (assessment) order came to be made inter-alia negativing the
claim of the writ petitioner of being a trust entitled Sections 11, 12 benefits qua said Act and taking
the total income of the assessee trust i.e., taking the gross income; that assailing the impugned order
captioned main writ petition has been filed.
4. This Court having set out the factual matrix in a nutshell, before proceeding further, deems it
appropriate to say that the factual matrix narrated supra is based on the writ affidavit averments
and the submissions made before this Court. This Court notices that the registration (as set out
supra) is not under Section 12A but it is under Section 12AA of said Act.
5. Mr.N.Dilip Kumar, learned Senior Standing Counsel for Income Tax accepted notice on behalf of
both the respondents. Owing to the narrow compass on which captioned writ petition turns, with
the consent of learned counsel on both sides, captioned main writ petition was taken up and heard
out.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
6. In response to the points raised by learned counsel for writ petitioner, learned Revenue counsel
made submissions a summation of which is as follows:
(a) Cancellation of registration under Section 12AA of said Act is not vide the
impugned order but the impugned order merely records the fact and more
particularly, the impugned order records the fact that the writ petitioner-assessee has
not uploaded the Section 12AA registration certificate either in response to notice
under Section 142(1) of said Act or two reminders thereafter;
(b) It is incorrect to say that the writ petitioner-
assessee is being continuously given the benefit of exemption under Section 12AA of said Act for
thirty years as even according to the writ petitioner and even according to the case file placed before
this Court, such exemption was negatived for the assessment year 2018-19 vide assessment order
dated 30.04.2021 bearing reference DIN ITBA/AST/S/143(3)/2021-22/1032744474(1);
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186318774/ 3
Muvendar Trust vs The The Income Tax Officer on 16 December, 2021
(c) It is not tenable to say that the impugned order https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis is a
non-speaking order as it clearly records the trajectory and the reason for not extending Section
12AA benefit to the writ petitioner-assessee.
7. In addition to the aforementioned submissions in terms of reply, a reply to the arguments
projected by learned counsel for writ petitioner, learned Revenue counsel also brought to the notice
of this Court that there is a effective and efficacious alternate remedy qua impugned order as the
same is appealable under Section 246 of said Act.
8. By way of reply submissions, learned counsel for writ petitioner submitted that in 2018-19,
Section 12AA of said Act registration has not been cancelled by way of the assessment order i.e., the
aforementioned assessment order dated 30.04.2021 and therefore the question of assailing the same
in writ jurisdiction does not arise.
9. This Court carefully considered the rival submissions and this Court is of the considered view that
this is not a fit case for interfering with the impugned order in writ jurisdiction and that the prayer
of the writ petition in the captioned main writ petition cannot be answered in
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis affirmative i.e., cannot be acceded to and the reasons are as
follows:
(a) The relevant part of the impugned order which deals with Section 12AA of said
Act issue is captured in two paragraphs of impugned order and the same read as
follows:
'...For further proceedings of the case, Notice U/s 143(2) of the Income-Tax Act, 1961
dated 30/09/2020 was issued and duly served upon the assessee but the assessee has
not complied. Further, reminder letters dated 25/02/2021 and 30/08/2021 were
issued to the assessee requested to make compliance to upload registration
certificate. But till date no reply has been received from the assessee.
Considering the above and going through the reason for selection of the case for
scrutiny i.e the Registration of the Trust under Section 12AA of the Income-Tax
Act,1961 has been cancelled. Therefore, the authenticity of assessee being a bnafide
registered trust not fully confirmed. Hence, without evidence of registered
documents, the assessee's claim of being trust is not accepted and taxed as per
Income Tax Act, 1961 and the total income of the assessee trust is assessed taking the
gross income received by the trust of Rs.
5,75,93,708/- during the Financial Year 2018-19...' https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
A careful perusal of the aforementioned two paragraphs leaves this Court with the
considered view that the cancellation of registration under Section 12AA of said Act is
not vide the impugned order but it only records the cancellation;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186318774/ 4
Muvendar Trust vs The The Income Tax Officer on 16 December, 2021
(b) There is nothing to demonstrate why the writ petitioner did not upload the
registration certificate under Section 12AA of said Act in spite of adequate ample and
multiple opportunities being given to the writ petitioner, all of which is captured in
the aforementioned two paragraphs;
(c) On a demurrer, even if it is to be construed that the cancellation is vide impugned
order cancellation of registration under Section 12AA of said Act is also revisable
under Section 264 of said Act. Suffice to say that there is an effective and efficacious
alternate remedy even against cancellation. To be noted, as mentioned in the opening
part of this point this is on a demurrer;
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
(d) The submission that the writ petitioner-assessee being given the benefit of registration under
Section 12AA of said Act for thirty years continuously falls flat on its face in the light of
aforementioned assessment order dated 30.04.2021 made for the assessment year 2018-19. The
most relevant portion of this assessment order is contained in paragraph 14 thereat and the relevant
paragraph 14 reads as follows:
'It is also undisputed that the assessee trust has applied for registration u/s.12A and
exemption u/s.80G of the Act on 12.08.1986 onwards. From that time onwards, there
has been constant renewal of exemption u/s.80G of the Act but in the case of
assessee, the assessee was not able to provide the copy of application for registration
u/s 12A and exemption u/s 80G from the inception of the trust i.e. 15/07/1985.Even,
the submission of the assessee that it was granted 12A vide ref No.2039(43)/87 by
the CIT, Tamilnadu-V, Chennai in the year 1987 is not acceptable. From the copy of
ITR of the A.Y. 2013-14 to A.Y. 2015-16 this fact was clear that the assessee did not
have 12A registration. Further, the assessee had entered registration no and date of
80G registration in the ITR of A.Y. 2016-17. From this
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis fact, it is clear that the registration number given
and claim that it was issued it I 1987 was the registration number of 80G issued on
29/09/1992. Further, In A.Y. 2013-14, the auditor has made audit (as per ITR of A.Y.
13-14) as per section 10(23)(iv) of the Act.' To be noted, there are two 'paragraph 14'
in the previous assessment order and I am referring to the first of the two paragraphs
at pages 61 and 62 of the typed set of papers that has been placed before me;
(e) The impugned order, in the considered view of this Court cannot be said to be a
non-speaking order.
Two critical paragraphs in the impugned order which has captured the crux and gravamen of the
matter had been extracted and reproduced supra. Those two paragraphs by itself and of course the
rest of the order make it clear that it is not a non-speaking order. It may at best be a terse order. An
order can be tersely eloquent, it cannot be construed to be a non-speaking order unless it is laconic,
not when it is epigrammatic or merely because it is terse. Therefore, this Court is of the considered
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186318774/ 5
Muvendar Trust vs The The Income Tax Officer on 16 December, 2021
view that the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis argument that the impugned order is a non-speaking
order becomes a non-starter i.e., an argument which does not take off;
(f)This takes this Court to the alternate remedy aspect. Alternate remedy no doubt is a self-imposed
restraint. It is not an absolute rule. Alternate remedy rule is a rule of discretion. Notwithstanding
alternate remedy rule being a rule of discretion, Hon'ble Supreme Court which in a long line of case
laws i.e., in a catena of case laws starting from Dunlop India case [Assistant Collector of Central
Excise, Chandan Nagar, West Bengal Vs. Dunlop India Ltd., and others reported in (1985) 1 SCC
260] ; Satyawati Tandon [United Bank of India Vs. Satyawati Tondon and others reported in (2010)
8 SCC 110] and K.C.Mathew [Authorized Officer, State Bank of Travancore and another Vs. Mathew
K.C. reported in (2018) 3 SCC 85], has held that in fiscal law Statutes, alternate remedy rule has to
be applied with utmost rigour. Relevant paragraph in Dunlop case is paragraph No.3 and relevant
portion of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis the same reads as follows:
'3. ....... Article 226 is not meant to short-circuit or circumvent statutory procedures.
It is only where statutory remedies are entirely ill-suited to meet the demands of
extraordinary situations, as for instance where the very vires of the statute is in
question or where private or public wrongs are so inextricably mixed up and the
prevention of public injury and the vindication of public justice require it that
recourse may be had to Article 226 of the Constitution. But then the Court must have
good and sufficient reason to bypass the alternative remedy provided by statute.
Surely matters involving the revenue where statutory remedies are available are not
such matters. We can also take judicial notice of the fact that the vast majority of the
petitions under Article 226 of the Constitution are filed solely for the purpose of
obtaining interim orders and thereafter prolong the proceedings by one device or the
other. The practice certainly needs to be strongly discouraged.' (Underlining made by
this Court to supply emphasis and highlight) Relevant paragraph in K.C.Mathew case
is paragraph 10 and the same reads as follows:
'10. In Satyawati Tondon the High Court had restrained further proceedings under
Section 13(4) of the Act. Upon a detailed consideration of the statutory scheme under
the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis SARFAESI Act, the availability of remedy to the
aggrieved under Section 17 before the Tribunal and the appellate remedy under
Section 18 before the Appellate Tribunal, the object and purpose of the legislation, it
was observed that a writ petition ought not to be entertained in view of the alternate
statutory remedy available holding: (SCC pp.123 & 128, Paras 43 & 55) “43.
Unfortunately, the High Court overlooked the settled law that the High Court will
ordinarily not entertain a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution if an effective
remedy is available to the aggrieved person and that this Rule applies with greater
rigour in matters involving recovery of taxes, cess, fees, other types of public money
and the dues of banks and other financial institutions. In our view, while dealing with
the petitions involving challenge to the action taken for recovery of the public dues,
etc., the High Court must keep in mind that the legislations enacted by Parliament
and State Legislatures for recovery of such dues are a code unto themselves inasmuch
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186318774/ 6
Muvendar Trust vs The The Income Tax Officer on 16 December, 2021
as they not only contain comprehensive procedure for recovery of the dues but also
envisage constitution of quasi-judicial bodies for redressal of the grievance of any
aggrieved person. Therefore, in all such cases, the High Court must insist that before
availing remedy under Article 226 of the Constitution, a person must exhaust the
remedies available under the relevant statute.
55.It is a matter of serious concern that despite repeated pronouncement of this
Court, the High Courts https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis continue to ignore the
availability of statutory remedies under the DRT Act and the SARFAESI Act and
exercise jurisdiction under Article 226 for passing orders which have serious adverse
impact on the right of banks and other financial institutions to recover their dues. We
hope and trust that in future the High Courts will exercise their discretion in such
matters with greater caution, care and circumspection.' (underlining made by this
Court to supply emphasis and highlight) Paragraph 10 of K.C.Mathew case extracts
the Satyawati Tandon principles i.e., portions of the case law from Satyawati Tandon
and the same has been reproduced. Therefore, I deem it appropriate to not to burden
this order with extracts from Satyawati Tandon case. To be noted, these three case
laws are not an exhaustive list qua alternate remedy principle in Fiscal Law Statute
but they are illustrative qua a long line of case laws.
In addition to the above line of authorities, the latest case law is Commercial Steel Limited case [The
Assistant Commissioner of State Tax and others Vs. M/s.Commercial Steel Limited in Civil Appeal
No. 5121 of 2021] which was rendered by a three Member Bench of the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Hon'ble Supreme Court on 03.09.2021. Three Member Hon'ble
Bench had culled out the exceptions to the alternate remedy rule and had clearly held that
interference in writ jurisdiction will arise only in exceptional cases where the exception adumbrated
therein are attracted. Relevant paragraphs in Commercial Steel case are paragraph Nos.11, 12 and
the same read as follows:
'11 The respondent had a statutory remedy under section 107. Instead of availing of
the remedy, the respondent instituted a petition under Article 226. The existence of
an alternate remedy is not an absolute bar to the maintainability of a writ petition
under Article 226 of the Constitution. But a writ petition can be entertained in
exceptional circumstances where there is: (i) a breach of fundamental rights; (ii) a
violation of the principles of natural justice; (iii) an excess of jurisdiction; or (iv) a
challenge to the vires of the statute or delegated legislation.
12 In the present case, none of the above exceptions was established. There was, in
fact, no violation of the principles of natural justice since a notice was served on the
person in charge of the conveyance. In this backdrop, it was CA 5121/2021 7 not
appropriate for the High Court to entertain a writ petition. The assessment of facts
would have to be carried out by the appellate authority. As a matter of fact, the High
Court has while doing this exercise proceeded on the basis of surmises. However,
since we are inclined to relegate the respondent to the pursuit of the alternate
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186318774/ 7
Muvendar Trust vs The The Income Tax Officer on 16 December, 2021
statutory https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis remedy under Section 107, this Court
makes no observation on the merits of the case of the respondent.' In addition to the
above the oft quoted and celebrated Whirlpool principle [Whirlpool Corporation Vs.
Registrar of Trade Marks, Mumbai and others reported in (1998) 8 SCC 1] case law
also fortifies the view that is being taken by this Court. The Whirlpool Corporation
case is such an oft quoted case law that it has come to stay in litigation parlance as
'Whirlpool exceptions'. In the case on hand, the only arguments that comes closest to
an exception is the writ petitioner allegedly not being given an opportunity before
cancellation of Section 12AA registration. As already alluded to supra, this Court is of
the view that the impugned order may not be the order by which the Section 12AA
registration has been cancelled. Though not specifically pointed out, I am of the view
that this alleged NJP violation if at all and if that be so would be predicated and
posited on the proviso to Sub-section (3) of Section 12AA of said Act. This did not
arise as the impugned order merely records a cancellation. This is buttressed and
bolstered by the writ petitioner not uploading the registration certificate more so
when it is the positive and categoric averment of the writ petitioner that the 12AA
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis registration has been repeatedly renewed for over a
continuous period of time whereas only the 80G registration was discontinued post
31.03.2000. To be noted, even now, even in this writ petition case file, Section 12AA
registration certificate has not been produced. This Court is of the considered view
that the writ petitioner has not given any acceptable reason for not uploading the
12AA registration certificate which the writ petitioner claims is in its possession.
10. The above takes us to Section 142(1) notice which becomes relevant. A scanned reproduction of
142(1) notice dated 30.08.2021 is as follows:
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis What is of relevance is serial No.4 thereat. The
second respondent has sought for the registration certificate under Section 12AA of
said Act with utmost clarity and specificity but the same has not been uploaded. This
142(1) notice, as already alluded to supra was followed by not one but two reminders
i.e., dated 25.02.2021 and 30.08.2021. There is nothing to demonstrate that the writ
petitioner-assessee responded to these two reminders. There is no response which
has been placed before me. There is no averment that the writ petitioner-assessee
responded to these reminders. On the contrary, specific submission made, on
instructions, before this Court today is that the writ petitioner does not readily have
the 12AA registration certificate.
11. Reverting to the alternate remedy facet of the matter on hand which has been alluded to supra,
interestingly and intriguingly, as rightly pointed out by learned Revenue counsel in one of the
previous https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis assessment year i.e., 2018-19 assessment order dated
30.04.2021 (referred to supra) has been assailed by the writ petitioner by way of an appeal.
Furthermore, the submission of learned Revenue counsel that even vide the assessment order for
2018-19, the 12AA benefit has been considered and negatived. The reasons in paragraph 14 to which
my attention was drawn has already extracted and reproduced supra. The above is buttressed by the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186318774/ 8
Muvendar Trust vs The The Income Tax Officer on 16 December, 2021
positive averment of the writ petitioner in paragraph 5 of the writ affidavit. Relevant portion of
paragraph 5 reads as follows:
'Without considering any of the submissions, the Assessing Officer passed an order
dated 30/4/2021 for the Assessment Year 2018-19 denying the status of public
charitable trust to the petitioner and treated the total income of the petitioner as
gross income. The Respondent also initiated action for imposing penalty under
Section 274 read with Section 270 A of IT Act for underreporting of income. In the
said Assessment Order there is no finding or mention with regard to the cancellation
or otherwise of the Registration Certificate earlier issued to the petitioner under the
IT Act. Against the said order, the petitioner has filed an Appeal before
Commissioner (Appeals) and the same is pending.' https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
12. A perusal of above averment makes it clear that it is the stated position of the writ petitioner i.e.,
the stated case of the writ petitioner that the assessment order qua 2018-19 has been assailed by the
writ petitioner by way of a statutory appeal. The arguments that vide assessment order 2018-19
there is cancellation of 12AA registration certificate, does not hold water and does not carry the writ
petitioner any further for two reasons. One reason is as already alluded to supra, the impugned
order is not the order by which the cancellation has been made and on a demurrer even if that be so,
the same is revisable under Section 264 of said Act and more importantly the second reason is sauce
for Goose is sauce for Gander too. If the writ petitioner can assail the assessment order for 2018-19
(where Section 12AA benefit have been negatived) by way of a statutory appeal under Section 246 of
said Act, there is no reason as to why the writ petitioner cannot do it qua impugned assessment
order. This by itself downs the curtains from all these arguments and it douses the writ petitioner's
campaign against the writ petitioner.
13. Notwithstanding the dismissal of the captioned writ petition, if the writ petitioner chooses to
avail the alternate remedy either by way of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis an appeal under
Section 246 of said Act or by way of a revision under Section 264 of said Act as the case may be,
subject to limitation and subject to pre-deposit condition, the appellate authority/revisional
authority can consider the appeal/revision on its own merits and in accordance with law
untrammelled by observations made in this order as the observations made in this order are for the
purpose of deciding the tenability of interference qua the impugned order in writ jurisdiction.
14. In the light of the narrative, discussion and dispositive reasoning set out supra, the sequitur is
the captioned writ petition fails and the same is dismissed. Consequently, captioned W.M.P is also
dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs.
