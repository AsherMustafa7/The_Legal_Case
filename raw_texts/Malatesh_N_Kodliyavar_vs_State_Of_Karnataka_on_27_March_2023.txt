LETTER DATED 22ND MAY, 2020 VIDE ANNEXURE-A; AND ETC.
IN THIS WRIT PETITION ARGUMENTS BEING HEARD,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/18072955/ 11
Malatesh N Kodliyavar vs State Of Karnataka on 27 March, 2023
JUDGMENT RESERVED, COMING ON FOR "PRONOUNCEMENT OF
ORDERS", THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:
ORDER
In this writ petition, petitioners are assailing the Endorsement dated 05.03.2020 (Annexure-Q)
issued by the respondent No.3 interalia, seeking direction to the respondents to issue fresh seniority
list in terms of the declaration of law by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of K.NARAYANAN AND
OTHERS VS. STATE OF KARNATAKA AND OTHERS reported in 1994 Supp. (1) SCC 44 and in the
case of P. SUDHAKAR RAO AND OTHERS VS. U.GOVIND RAO AND OTHERS reported in (2013)
8 SCC 693 and also in terms of the Board orders dated 16.08.1996 and 27.12.1996 and further,
sought for direction to re-fix the seniority accordingly.
2. Relevant facts for the adjudication of the case are that, the Karnataka Electricity Board amended
the Karnataka Electricity Board Recruitment and Promotion Regulation, 1969, incorporating the
new policy of appointment called as "Appointment by transfer" (for short, hereinafter referred to
'ABT' Policy) of the in-service junior engineers who possess or acquires B.E. or AMIE (India)
qualification as Assistant Engineers (Elec.). Copy of the approval of the Board dated 26.07.1986 is
produced as Annexure-A to the writ petition. Paragraph 2 of the Annexure-A provides for transfer.
The said Board approval provided for retrospective seniority over and above the existing Assistant
Engineers was questioned before this Court in the case of GURUSRIPAD VS. KARNATAKA
ELECTRICITY BOARD in WP No. 14622 of 1986. It is further stated in the writ petition that
identical provision providing for retrospective seniority for appointment by transfer in the Public
Works Department was challenged before the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of K. Narayanan
(supra). The Hon'ble Apex Court, struck down the provisions providing for retrospective promotion
on the ground that undue benefit is being given to a class of employees over the other and the
provisions providing for weightage of past service was upheld. It is contended by the petitioners that
the dictum of the Hon'ble Apex Court was to highlight eligibility criteria only for in-service
candidates while providing promotion. The Division Bench of this court following the dictum of the
Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of K.Narayanan (supra) disposed of the writ petition in the case of
Gurusripad (supra). Pursuant to the aforementioned judgments, respondent- Corporation was
directed to prepare a fresh gradation list by holding the date of entry into service as Assistant
Engineer (Elec.) from the cadre of Junior Engineers (Elec.) who were appointed by transfer. It is
further stated in the writ petition that during the pendency of the aforementioned case, certain
Assistant Engineers, who are appointed under Appointment By Transfer Policy on the condition that
their interse seniority ranking would be fixed after the disposal of the writ petition and at the time of
regularizing their service as officiating Assistant Engineers and such appointment orders were
passed by the respondent-Board as per Official Memorandum dated 30.01.1992, 07.09.1993,
23.09.1994 and 20.03.1995 (Annexure-B1 to B4 respectively). It is the case of the petitioners that all
the Junior Engineers, who were appointed by transfer to the post of Assistant Engineer Cadre were
aware that their Seniority ranking in the Assistant Engineer cadre would be subject to outcome of
court proceedings in K.Narayanan case and Gurusripad case (supra). Following the dictum of the
Hon'ble Apex Court in K.Narayanan case, respondent- Corporation amended the Board order dated
26.07.1986 on 16.08.1996 and 27.12.1996. As per the amended Board order dated 16.08.1996,
Junior Engineer, who is appointed by transfer as Assistant Engineer on or after 26.07.1986 shall be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/18072955/ 12
Malatesh N Kodliyavar vs State Of Karnataka on 27 March, 2023
entitled to count one-third of the service rendered by him as Junior Engineer subject to maximum 4
years for the purpose of consideration of his eligibility for promotion to the post of Assistant
Executive Engineer i.e., the Senior of such Junior Engineer is to be fixed in the cadre of Assistant
Engineer from the date of transfer (Annexure-C). Subsequent amendment on 27.12.1996, it provides
that a Junior Engineer to be appointed as Assistant Engineer under the 'ABT policy' should have put
in minimum of 7 years service as a Junior Engineer (Annexure-D).
3. It is averred in the writ petition that the petitioners are appointed to the cadre of Assistant
Engineer between 1988 and 1998. It is the grievance of the petitioners that the
respondent-Corporation erroneously interpreting the law declared by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the
case of K.Narayanan (supra), re-fixed the seniority of Junior Engineers i.e. the Senior of Junior
Engineers appointed by transfer has been fixed in the Assistant Engineer cadre retrospectively over
and above the seniority of existing Assistant Engineers by fixing their actual date of
joining/reporting as Assistant Engineers much before they were able to get place in the cadre of
Assistant Engineers and accordingly, Official Memorandum dated 04.11.2000 (Annexure-E) was
issued by the respondent-Corporation. The said re-fixation was neither notified to the petitioners
nor published in the website of the respondent-Corporation. The said Official Memorandum dated
04.11.2000 is contrary to the law declared by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of K.Narayanan. It
is further amplified that, dictum of the K.Narayanan case was followed in the case of P.Sudhakar
Rao (supra) by the Hon'ble Apex Court relating to Andra Pradesh Engineering subordinate service.
It is also stated in the writ petition that the respondent- Corporation, notified the revised seniority
list dated 27.10.2017 (Annexure-F), pursuant to the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case
of B.K.PAVITRA VS. UNION OF INDIA reported in (2017) 4 SCC 620. Thereafter, the petitioners
have addressed representation dated 05.06.2017 (Annexure-G) to the respondent-Corporation and
subsequently, the petitioners have filed WP No.35999 of 2019 before this Court, seeking
consideration of the said representation and this Court, by order dated 04.12.2019 (Annexure-J),
directed the respondent-KPTCL consider the same in accordance with law. Again the petitioners
addressed one more representation dated 18.12.2019 (Annexure-K) to the respondent-Corporation
and pursuant to the same, the respondent-Corporation has issued impugned Endorsement dated
05.03.2020 (Annexure-Q), rejecting the representation filed by the petitioners on the ground that
the Seniority has been already re-fixed. Feeling aggrieved by the same, the petitioners have
presented this writ petition.
4. I have heard Sri D.R. Ravishankar, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of Smt.
M.L.Suvarna, for petitioners; Sri T.P.Srinivasa, learned Principal Government Advocate appearing
for respondent No.1; Sri Shirish Krishna, learned counsel appearing for the respondents 2 and 3; Sri

respondents 7, 17, 19, 24, 33, 31, 36 and 44; Sri Ashok N.Patil, learned counsel appearing for the

5. Sri. D.R. Ravishankar, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners contended
that the petitioners are Engineering graduates and they have been appointed by direct recruitment
in to the respective cadre. The contesting respondents, who were appointed with a Diploma
Certificate acquired graduation while in service and they have been transposed as Assistant
Engineers and were placed in the seniority in the cadre of Assistant Engineers above the petitioners
and the said action of the respondent-Corporation, is contrary to law. Referring to the
respondent-Board orders dated 16.08.1996 and 26.07.1986, learned Senior Counsel appearing for
petitioners contended that judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of K. Narayanan (supra),
would clearly indicate that the Junior Engineer (Elec.) should put in a minimum experience of seven
years of service in the cadre of Junior Engineer and thereafter, such Junior Engineers are eligible for
ABT Policy to the post of Assistant Engineer (Elec.). He pleaded that, seniority of a Junior Engineers
(Elec.) who has been appointed as Assistant Engineer by transfer from the cadre of Junior Engineer
shall be fixed in the category of Assistant Engineers (Elec.) from the date of their transfer and such
Engineers cannot claim their seniority in the cadre of Assistant Engineer before it takes birth in the
said cadre. Sri. D.R. Ravishankar, learned Senior Counsel having taken through the Recruitment
and Promotion Regulations of the respondent-Corporation contended that the promotions have to
be made on the basis of seniority-cum- merit. In this regard, he submitted that the foremost criteria
to be considered for promotion of an employee is that the employee should be senior in the seniority
list and by applying Regulation-2 of aforementioned Regulations that an employee appointed
against a substantive vacancy shall be senior to all other persons who are appointed on officiating in
the same cadre. Therefore, it is the principal contention of learned Senior Counsel appearing for the
petitioners that the seniority of Assistant Engineers who are appointed by direct recruitment takes
precedence over the promotees and all persons in the same cadre. Therefore, he contended that the
petitioners in the present writ petition are direct recruitees and therefore, the petitioners have to be
placed above the Engineers appointed by transfer. Emphasize was also made that as the respondent
- Corporation having not followed the procedure contemplated under their Regulations and same is
violation of the orders dated 16.08.1996 and 27.12.1996. Accordingly, he sought for quashing the
impugned endorsement.
6. Nextly, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioners contended that as the contesting
respondents having been appointed by transfer cannot claim the cadre equivalent to the petitioners
herein on the ground that their entry into the said cadre is from the date of their transfer and
therefore, Sri. D.R. Ravishankar, learned Senior Counsel argued that the impugned action of the
respondent-Corporation is contrary to the law declared by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
P. Sudhakar Rao (supra). He further contended that the respondent-Corporation has violated the
principle that the Seniority to a person cannot be granted retrospectively even before such promotee
was born in the cadre.
7. Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners further contended that there are only two ways of
recruitment to any cadre namely, by direct recruitment or by way of promotion. The
respondent-Corporation, by introducing a new method of appointment by transfer of in-service
employees, possessing and acquiring higher qualification to technical cadre course as per Board
order dated 26.07.1986 is a scheme to provide for such employees of a lower cadre being appointed
to a technical cadre post without any competition or examination, based on the acquisition of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/18072955/ 14
Malatesh N Kodliyavar vs State Of Karnataka on 27 March, 2023
degree. Promoting such employees above the petitioners who have been directly recruited is
contrary to law declared by Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of K.Narayanan (supra) wherein, it is
held that the benefit of retrospective seniority is ultra-vires to the service jurisprudence. The
respondent-Corporation having aware about its own Board orders dated 16.08.1996/27.12.1996 that
only one-third weightage of service will be counted for the purpose of eligibility for promotion to the
post of Assistant Executive Engineer cadre and not for the purpose of seniority however, the said
order is violated by the respondent-Corporation. In this regard, he referred to the Judgment of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of K. NARAYANAN AND ANOTHER Vs. STATE OF
KARNATAKA AND OTHERS reported in 1994 Suppl. 1 SCC 44, in the case of P. SUDHAKAR RAO
AND OTHERS Vs. U.GOVIND RAO AND OTHERS reported in (2013) 8 SCC 693; GURUSRIPAD
AND OTHERS Vs. KARNATAKA ELECTRICITY BOARD in WP No. 14622 of 1986 decided on
23.01.1986 ; in the case of GOVERNMENT OF INDIA AND OTHERS Vs. INDIAN TOBACCO
ASSOCIATION reported in (2005) 7 SCC 396 and in the case of CHAIRMAN, STATE BANK OF
INDIA AND ANOTHER Vs. M.J. JAMES, reported in (2022) 2 SCC
301.
8. In reply to the submission made by the learned counsel appearing for the parties with regard to
delay and laches, Sri. D.R. Ravishankar argued that the petitioners and other similarly situated
employees have been kept in dark and further the respondent-Corporation failed to implement the
Judgments of the Hon'ble Apex Court and this Court, as there is violation of statutory duty by the
respondent-Corporation and same is a continuing wrong till the issuance of the seniority list, 2017
and immediately the petitioners made efforts to file the writ petition challenging the impugned
notification issued by the respondent- Corporation as the same is contrary to the law declared by
this Court in Gurusripad's case and retrospective seniority has been assigned to the Junior
Engineers despite the Judgment of this Court and Hon'ble Apex Court and the same is in violation
of the Board orders and as such, he argued that, delay and laches would not come in the way of
granting relief to the petitioners. In this regard, he refers to the Judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court
in the case of AJAY KUMAR SUKLA AND OTHERS Vs. ARVIND RAI AND OTHERS reported in
(2021) SCC Online 1195 and submitted that, as the seniority list has been prepared in contravention
of statutory rules, same cannot be defended on the ground of delay and laches.
9. Per contra, Sri. Shirish Krishna, learned counsel appearing for respondents 2 and 3, invited the
attention of the Court to the prayer made in the writ petition and submitted that, the petitioners
have challenged the provisional seniority list and same cannot be quashed. He further contended
that the writ petition is liable to be dismissed on the ground of delay and laches and the rights of the
petitioners cannot be enforced in writ proceedings after unreasonable lapse of action in service
related disputes. Claiming seniority is not a fundamental right and is only a civil right, Sri. Shirish
Krishna relied upon the Judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of SHIBA SHANKAR
MOHAPATRA AND OTHERS Vs. STATE OF ORISSA AND OTHERS reported in (2010) 12 SCC 471;
in the case of CHAIRMAN / MANAGING DIRECTOR, U.P. POWER CORPORATION LIMITED
AND OTHERS Vs. RAM GOPAL reported in 2020 SCC Online SC 101 and in the case of
KARNATAKA POWER CORPORATION LIMITED VS. K. THANGAPPAN AND ANOTHER reported
in (2006) 4 SCC 322 and argued that mere making representation to the authorities would not
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/18072955/ 15
Malatesh N Kodliyavar vs State Of Karnataka on 27 March, 2023
justify the belated approach by the petitioners in the present case. He further contended that the
petitioners were well aware about the series of seniority list issued by the respondent-Corporation
since 2000, however, approached this Court with inordinate delay of more than a decade and
therefore, he sought for dismissal of the writ petition.
10. Sri. N. Devdas, learned Senior Counsel on behalf of Smt. Anusuyadevi, appearing for some of the
contesting respondents argued that the representation dated 05.06.2017 (Annexure-G) itself has
become infructuous and therefore, consideration of the same does not arise at all. Petitioners having
filed objections to the preliminary notification, have not attended the oral hearing afforded by the
respondent-KPTCL to the objectors who had filed objections to the provisional seniority list.
Learned Senior Counsel further contended that even after the judgment rendered by the Hon'ble
Apex Court in the case of B.K. PAVITRA-II on 10.05.2019, the petitioners did not filed objections to
their seniority and therefore, writ petition is liable to be dismissed for want of material facts. He
further contended that the petitioners have suppressed vital material facts that the judgment
delivered in Writ Appeal No.41 of 2020. Therefore, looking into the conduct of petitioners, learned
Senior Counsel pleaded that, the writ petition deserves to be dismissed.
11. Nextly, Sri. N. Devadas, learned Senior Counsel argued that the petitioners are complaining
about the issue of seniority of ABT Engineers after a lapse of 24 years, and therefore, the writ
petition deserves to be dismissed on the ground of delay and laches. The petitioners were aware
about the method of recruitment to the post of Assistant Engineer which provided for direct
recruitment and also by Appointment By Transfer of the Junior Engineers who possess requisite
qualification and at this stage, the petitioners cannot be permitted to raise the belated claim in this
writ petition. Accordingly, he sought for dismissal of petition with cost.
12. Sri. Subramanya Bhat, Sri Ashok N.Patil, Sri Abhinav R., and Sri. Vijay Kumar, learned counsel
appearing for the contesting respondents contended that some of the respondents have acquired
B.E. Degree before their appointment as Junior Engineer and therefore as per the existing Rules
under Regulation 10-A of Recruitment and Promotion Regulation, such respondents were permitted
to change the cadre, having obtained the requisite degree in Engineering and were appointed as
Assistant Engineer under appointment by transfer (ABT) and accordingly, they sought for dismissal
of the petition on the ground that these contesting respondents have been promoted, based on the
seniority in the cadre of Assistant Engineer. Referring to Notification dated 16.08.1996, Clause 2 of
Note (V) of paragraph 2, Sri. Vijay Kumar, learned counsel appearing for the respondents made a
specific contention that the said Notification permits counting of one-third service rendered as
Assistant Engineer for the purpose of qualifying service and eligible for promotion as Assistant
Executive Engineer and considering the same, the contesting respondents have been promoted as
Assistant Executive Engineer by orders dated 16.11.1999, 30.11.1999 and 29.07.2000 and therefore,
he contended that as per order dated 27.12.1996, which prescribes a minimum seven years of service
in the cadre of Junior Engineer for appointment by transfer is not applicable to the case of
petitioners. It is the categorical argument of learned counsel Sri. Vijay Kumar that the contesting
respondents are not beneficiaries of retrospective promotion, as claimed by the petitioners and
therefore, he sought for dismissal of the petition on the ground of delay and laches.

Malatesh N Kodliyavar vs State Of Karnataka on 27 March, 2023
13. In the light of the submission made by learned counsel appearing for the parties, the principal
claim of the petitioners is that the petitioners are entitled for promotion in terms of the judgment of
the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of K. Naryanan (supra) and P. Sudhakar Rao (supra) and they
have to be placed above ABT Junior Engineers in the seniority list. Petitioners have also challenged
the endorsement dated 05.03.2020 (Annexure-Q) whereby, pursuant to the direction issued by this
Court on 04.12.2019 in Writ petition No.35999 of 2019 and the representation dated 05.06.2017
made by the petitioners requesting to place their seniority above the seniority of ABT Engineers in
accordance with Board orders. It is relevant to extract the entire judgment rendered by this Court on
04.12.2019 in Writ Petition No.35999 of 2019, which reads as under:
"ORDER Petitioners being the employees of the 2nd respondent KPTCL are invoking
the writ jurisdiction of this court with an innocuous prayer i.e. a direction for
considering their representation dated
05.06.2017, a copy whereof is at Annexure-C, whilst finalizing the final Seniority List of the
Assistant Engineers in terms of the Apex Court judgment in the case of P.SUDHAKAR & OTHERS
vs. U. GOVINDA RAO AND OTHERS, (2013) 8 SCC 693.
2. Sri C.N. Mahadeshwara, learned Additional Government Advocate accepts notice for 1st
respondent -State and Sri A. Chandrachud, learned panel counsel accepts notice for 2nd
respondent- KPTCL.
3. Learned Panel counsel for KPTCL fairly submits that there will be no difficulty for considering
petitioners subject representation if a reasonable period is prescribed by this court and also if
petitioners agree to produced all necessary material required for such consideration. This stand of
2nd respondent is fair and reasonable.
In the above circumstance, this writ petition succeeds; a Writ of Mandamus issues to the 2nd
respondent to consider petitioners representation dated 05.06.2017, a copy whereof is at
Annexure-C within a period of six weeks and in accordance with law.
It is needless to mention that petitioners shall furnish all the necessary information/documents as
may be solicited by the respondent-KPTCL; however, in the guise of such solicitation, delay shall not
be brooked.
Result of consideration shall be made known to he petitioners without any delay.
14. It is the grievance of the writ petitioners that the Junior Engineers who were appointed with a
Diploma certificate, acquired B.E. Degree while in service and on such acquisition, such
appointment by Transfer (ABT-contesting private respondents), on acquisition of such Degree
qualification transposed as Assistant Engineers and were placed in the seniority in the cadre of
Assistant Engineers above the petitioners herein is contrary to Board orders dated 16.08.1996 and
26.07.1986.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/18072955/ 17
Malatesh N Kodliyavar vs State Of Karnataka on 27 March, 2023
15. In the backdrop of these aspects, I have carefully considered the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex
Court in the case of K. Narayanan and Gurusripad (supra), identical provisions existing in Public
Works Department, wherein challenge was laid to the retrospective seniority granted to such Junior
Engineers. In the case of K. Narayanan (supra), Hon'ble Apex Court at paragraph 5 to 9 held as
under:
"5. Demarcation of cadres or gradation in the same cadre on higher and lower
qualification is a common phenomenon for fixing hierarchy in services. It is a valid
basis of classification as held by this Court in State of Mysore v. P. Narasing Rao,
Union of India v. Dr S.B. Kohli (Mrs), State of J&K v. Triloki Nath Khosa, P.
Murugesan v.
State of T.N. Engineering services throughout the country, normally, maintain distinction between
Junior and Assistant Engineer on diploma and degree. It existed in the State of Karnataka right
from the day the rules were framed. It has been done away with on assumption by the Cabinet that
some of the duties performed by the two were common. The Tribunal did not agree with it, and in
our opinion rightly. But that alone is not sufficient to strike down the rule. A policy decision taken by
the Government is not liable to interference, unless the Court is satisfied that the rule-making
authority has acted arbitrarily or in violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14
and 16. Appointment by transfer in the same service or from the different cadre or service but equal
in rank and status is well known. But transfer from lower to higher cadre not by promotion but
direct appointment only because the incumbent became eligible without any selection, test or
criteria may not be in consonance with service discipline. What the rules contemplate is that once a
Junior Engineer acquires a degree qualification then he automatically should be deemed to have
become an Assistant Engineer. An employee occupying a higher post in different cadre may on
regularisation be entitled to claim his seniority from the date he was holding the post but giving a
higher post in different cadre in which the employee has never worked either as officiating or
temporary or even ad hoc because the employee became eligible earlier would be violative of the
right of equality. The methodology adopted in the rules by transferring such a person and placing
him in the category of direct recruits from the date of acquiring the degree the Government in our
opinion violated the basic norms of appointment and recruitment to any particular service. The
Government may appoint all the Junior Engineers en bloc after framing of the rule and place them
below all those who were working as Assistant Engineers on that date but they cannot be so
appointed as to get precedence over those who are working from before. It would result in artificially
making unequals as equals. Any person entering the service can justly feel secure of equality in
continuance, promotion etc. Any executive action violating it cannot be upheld. Seniority is an
incident of service which cannot be eroded or curtailed by a rule which operates discriminately. The
purpose of opening evening classes and permitting diploma holders to study was to improve
efficiency in service and provide better service conditions. When rules were framed and provision
for appointment by transfer was made both these objectives were achieved. But operation of the rule
with retrospective effect has no nexus with either except that it may result in undue benefit to one
class of employees over the other. The impugned rules having been framed in 1985 with effect from
1976 result in entry of diploma holders as Assistant Engineer only because they became qualified as
against those who entered in service before or after 1976 by competitive process. Devi Prasad] was
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/18072955/ 18
Malatesh N Kodliyavar vs State Of Karnataka on 27 March, 2023
upheld by this Court because it was found, 'as reasonable and in the circumstances fair'. The dispute
was between non- graduate diploma holders working as supervisors etc. and graduates working as
Junior Engineers. Since the Court found that there was functional parity between supervisors and
Junior Engineers the rule framed by the Government giving weightage of four years to supervisors
to make them eligible for appointment as Assistant Engineer was not invalid. But there can be no
functional parity between employees of two different cadres. It would be too dangerous to accept
such assumption. In R.N. Nanjundappa v. Thimmiah this Court struck down a rule for violation of
Article 14 as it had attempted to bypass the regular method of recruitment by competitive
examination or by selection or by promotion and provided for regularisation of a government
servant working on deputation as deemed to have been appointed. In State of A.P. v. K.S.
Muralidhar the temporary supervisor who had succeeded before this Court in Devi Prasad case
claimed seniority from the date of acquiring academic qualification. It was repelled and it was held
that it could be from the date of appointment only.
6. Article 309 of the Constitution empowers the appropriate Legislature to frame rules to regulate
recruitment to public services and the post. 'Recruitment' according to the dictionary means 'enlist'.
It is a comprehensive term and includes any method provided for inducting a person in public
service. Appointment, selection, promotion, deputation are all well-known methods of recruitment.
Even appointment by transfer is not unknown. But any rule framed is subject to other provisions of
the Constitution. Therefore it has to be tested on rule of equality. Transfer is normally resorted in
same cadre. But when it is made in a different and higher cadre it must not be violative of
constitutional guarantee and the rule of fairness. Providing for appointment of a diploma holder
from the cadre of Junior Engineer to Assistant Engineer from back date without any test or selection
on eligibility only does not sound reasonable and fair. Why was it done is apparent from the
following notings by the Secretary:
"The most important issue was regarding the date of transfer of the Junior Engineer
acquiring graduate qualifications, the weightage of past service had to be taken into
consideration. In the proposals submitted to the cabinet this crucial aspect was not
outlined specifically and the impression that was created was that the transfer would
take place with prospective effect. In such an event the weightage of previous service
would have to be confined only up to date of graduation and this would not have been
of any advantage to most of the Junior Engineers who have acquired the degree
qualification several years ago. Even if the weightage of past service after graduation
and up to the date of appointment as Junior Engineers was given the transferees
would not have gained any significant advantage in the matter of notional seniority.
The Karnataka Graduate Engineers have strongly represented on this issue and have
urged that their transfer to the Assistant Engineer's cadre should be with
retrospective effect i.e., from the date they have acquired graduate qualification. In
support of their arguments they have pointed out that even in Andhra Pradesh a
similar step was taken in that the transfer was allowed with retrospective effect. The
points raised by the Graduate Engineers Association have been examined and it is felt
that their demand to have the transfer effected with retrospective effect has some
justification in view of the long years of service rendered by the Junior Engineers
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/18072955/ 19
Malatesh N Kodliyavar vs State Of Karnataka on 27 March, 2023
before and after acquiring graduate qualification. If this benefit is not given, the
amendment to the C&R Rules allowing for their transfer would be of little use for
many of the senior members of the Graduate Engineers Association who have been
fighting for this change for many years. Therefore taking an overall sympathetic view
it is proposed that we may allow for the transfer of Junior Engineers who acquired
graduate qualifications with retrospective effect from the date of acquisition of such
qualification subject to the availability of vacancies at that time in the Assistant
Engineer's cadre. It is seen that the first batch of the in- service Junior Engineers
took their graduate degree in 1976 and hence the notification amending the rules
would have to be effective from January 1, 1976."
Rules were thus bent and made retrospective as a sympathetic consideration as many Junior
Engineers who were working since long would not have derived any benefit otherwise. May be true
but if the extension of such benefit impinges upon the constitutional guarantee of equality then it
cannot be upheld. And that does stand disturbed. Nothing further need be said. Nor it is necessary
to pronounce on the validity of a rule which in the class of appointment by direct recruitment
includes appointment by transfer resulting in entry of one class by competition or selection and
other by acquisition of minimum qualification as the appellants did not challenge the rule of
appointment by transfer but confined their claim to its operation retrospectively.
7. Rules operate prospectively. Retrospectivity is an exception. Even where the statute permits
framing of rule with retrospective effect the exercise of power must not operate discriminately or in
violation of any constitutional right so as to affect vested right. The rule-making authority should
not be permitted normally to act in the past. The impugned rule made in 1985 permitting
appointment by transfer and making it operative from 1976 subject to availability of vacancy in
effect results in appointing a Junior Engineer in 1986 with effect from 1976. Retrospectivity of the
rules is a camouflage for appointment of Junior Engineers from a back date. In our opinion the rule
operates viciously against all those Assistant Engineers who were appointed between 1976 to 1985.
In Ex-Capt. K.C. Arora v. State of and P.D. Aggarwal v. State of U.P. it was held by this Court that
the President or Governor cannot make such retrospective rules under Article 309 of the
Constitution as contravene Articles 14, 16 or 311 and affect vested right of an employee. Even in B.S.
Yadav v. State of where the power to frame rules retrospectively was upheld it was observed: (SCC p.
557, para 76) "Since the Governor exercises a legislative power under the proviso to Article 309 of
the Constitution, it is open to him to give retrospective operation to the rules made under that
provision. But the date from which the rules are made to operate must be shown to bear, either from
the face of the rules or by extrinsic evidence, reasonable nexus with the provisions contained in the
rules, especially when the retrospective effect extends over a long period as in this case."
As seen earlier there is no nexus between framing a rule permitting appointment by transfer and
making it retrospective with effect from 1976. Appointing a person to a higher post in a different
cadre in which he has never worked is violative of constitutional guarantee of those who are working
in the cadre. It is against basic principle of recruitment to any service. Even in Mohammad Shujat
Ali where the Constitution Bench while reiterating that distinction in qualification was valid
criterion for determining eligibility for promotion except where both held the same post and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/18072955/ 20
Malatesh N Kodliyavar vs State Of Karnataka on 27 March, 2023
perform same duty did not strike down the rules as the differentiation in same class of persons was
not brought about for the first time but existed from before and the two were treated as distinct and
separate class. The retrospective operation of the impugned rule attempts to disturb a system which
has been existing for more than twenty years. And that too without any rationale. Absence of nexus
apart no rule can be made retrospectively to operate unjustly and unfairly against other (sic). In our
opinion the retrospective operation of the rule with effect from January 1, 1976 is discriminatory
and violative of Articles 14 and 16.
8. So far weightage is concerned such provision has been upheld by this Court in Devi Prasad. Even
the appellants candidly stated that they were not against weightage.
9. For the reasons stated above these appeals and writ petition succeed and are allowed. The
following directions are issued:
(i) The order of the tribunal dated October 21, 1988 is set aside. The second
paragraph of the 1985 Amendment Rules making it operative from January 1, 1976 is
struck down as ultra vires.
(ii) Note (2) shall be read as providing eligibility only."
16. In Gurusripad case (WP No.14622 of 1986), some of the employees have challenged Board order
dated 26.07.1986 providing retrospective seniority and this Court, by order dated 23.01.1986, struck
down the provision providing retrospective seniority and directed the respondent-Board therein to
prepare fresh gradation list in the light of the judgment rendered in K. Narayan (supra).
".........
(2) the note relating to giving weightage shall be read as providing eligibility only and
(3) the respondent are directed to prepare fresh gradation list n the light of this and
in the light of the observations made by the Supreme Court in NARAYANAN'S case
referred to earlier. Let such action be taken by the Board within a period of four
months from today."
17. In the backdrop of the aforementioned declaration of law made by the Hon'ble Apex Court, it is
relevant to extract, the Board Resolution dated 26.07.1986 whereby, Note 4 and 5 of the said Board
Resolution reads as under:
Note (iv): The transfer shall be effective from the date of graduation subject to the
availability of vacancies without ignoring the interse seniority among those eligible
for such transfer.
Note (v): A Junior Engineer who is appointed by transfer as Assistant Engineer on or
after 1.1.76 shall be entitled to count one third of the service rendered by him as
Junior Engineer, prior to appointment as Assistant Engineer, subject to a maximum
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/18072955/ 21
Malatesh N Kodliyavar vs State Of Karnataka on 27 March, 2023
of 4 years, as if it had been in the post of Assistant Engineer, for the purpose of
consideration for promotion to the post of Assistant Executive Engineer and subject
to the following conditions, namely:-
(1) The seniority of a Junior Engineer who is appointed as Assistant Engineer shall be
fixed in the category of Assistant Engineers with reference to the national date
arrived at after giving weightage of service as aforesaid;
(2) A Junior Engineer who is appointed as Asst Engineer shall put in a minimum
service of two years on duty as Assistant Engineer, after such appointment and a total
service of five years as Assistant Engineer, inclusive of the service given as weightage
to become eligible for promotion as Assistant Executive Engineer.
18. On careful examination of the aforementioned note would indicate that, a Junior Engineer who
has been appointed by transfer as Assistant Engineer shall be entitled to count 1/3rd of the service
rendered by him as Junior Engineer, and same is subject to a maximum of four years. Note 5
extracted above, comprises two sub-clause. A clear reading of Note 5 would makes it clear that the
eligibility criteria for such promotion is the relevant factor to be looked into at the time of
consideration of the promotion. Undisputedly, the petitioners herein are working in the cadre of
Superintendent Engineer and Executive Engineer in the respondent-Corporation. The above
provisions of Board order dated 26.07.1986 providing retrospective seniority to the existing
Assistant Engineer was tested by this Court, in Gurusripad's case. In terms of the judgment
rendered in K.Narayanan's case supra and Gurusripad's case supra, respondent-Corporation ought
to have prepared a fresh gradation list by holding the date of entry into service as Assistant
Engineers from the date such Junior Engineers were appointed by transfer in the cadre of Assistant
Engineers. It is also to be noted that, the contesting respondents, who are all Junior Engineers and
appointed by transfer to the Assistant Engineer cadre were well aware about their Seniority ranking
in the Assistant Engineer cadre in view of the judgments rendered by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the
case of K.Naryanan's case and this court in Gurusripad's case (supra). It is also not in dispute that
the petitioners herein are appointed as Assistant Engineers by way of direct recruitment and if the
Board order providing retrospective promotion to the ABT Engineers, is allowed to be continued,
same would run contrary to the law declared by the Hon'ble Apex Court in K.Narayanan's case
(supra). It is mandated in the Note 4 and 5 that, the actual date of joining/reporting as Assistant
Engineer, by the ABT Junior Engineers is the determinative factor for consideration for promotion
to higher cadre. Looking into the aforementioned Board orders, I am of the view that, the
respondent- Corporation/Board, erroneously construed that, the seniority list of Assistant
Engineers/Assistant Executive Engineer cadre, published up to 2014 wherein the date of entry into
service of Junior Engineers was shown as that they had entered the service of the
respondent-Corporation directly to the cadre of Assistant Engineer and not by way of promotion in
terms of the Board orders by fulfilling the conditions of acquiring the necessary degree as well as
putting minimum period of 7 years as mandated by Board order dated 27.12.1996 and therefore, it is
clear violation on the part of the respondent-Corporation to issue the series of promotion, dehorse
the eligibility criteria as well as the law declared by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of
K.Narayanan's case, and therefore, the petitioners herein have made out a case that the impugned
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/18072955/ 22
Malatesh N Kodliyavar vs State Of Karnataka on 27 March, 2023
final list of promotion made by the respondent-Corporation is contrary to law as well as the law
declared by the Hon'ble Apex Court referred to above. If at all the Junior Engineer who became
Assistant Engineers by way of appointment by transfer are given seniority in the cadre of Assistant
Engineer from the date on which, they got promotion dehorsing the statutory provisions namely,
criteria of eligibility as mentioned in the regulation would amounts to violation of the judgment
Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of P.Sudhakar Rao (supra). It is pertinent to note that, impugned
order of promotion is liable to be set aside on the ground that the respondent-Corporation did not
make way for consider only the 1/3rd service weightage for the purpose of eligibility for promotion
to the Assistant Executive cadre and very same scheme / policy of appointment by transfer would be
defeated. Therefore, I find force in the submission made by Sri. D.R. avishankar, learned Senior
Counsel appearing for the petitioners that respondent-Corporation failed to follow eligibility criteria
before considering the case of the contesting respondents who were appointed by transfer.
19. Though I have arrived at a conclusion, that the petitioners have made out a case for interference
in the impugned Endorsement dated 05.03.2020, however, it is the principal submission of the all
the counsel representing the respondents that the writ petition deserves to be dismissed on the
ground of delay and laches as the petitioners have not approached this court at the earlier point of
time and the belated claim made by the petitioners is required to be rejected. I have also noticed
various judgments referred to by Sri. Shirish Krishna, learned counsel appearing for the respondent-
Corporation with regard to delay and laches. It is well settled principle in law that right to
promotion is not a fundamental right however, right for promotion of the aggrieved parties, have to
be appreciated by looking into the statutory provisions or the claim made by the aggrieved parties,
like petitioners in this petition, when there is discrimination based on applying the principle
arbitrarily without following the statutory provisions, interalia, dehorse the eligibility criteria of
such applicants seeking promotion. In this regard, sum and substance of the submission of the
respondents is that, promotion should not be disturbed after a long lapse of time when there is
inordinate delay. It is essential that, one who feels aggrieved by the seniority assigned to him, should
approached the Court as early as possible, otherwise, there would be administrative complications.
It is argued by the learned counsel appearing for the respondents that writ court shall take into
account the delay and laches on the part of the petitioners in approaching the court and if there is
gross and unexplained delay, the court shall refuse to grant relief in favour of such petitioners. In
the backdrop of these detailed arguments on delay and laches by the learned counsel appearing for
the respondent-Corporation and other contesting respondents one cannot miss the fact that writ
court is having a equitable jurisdiction under Article 226 of Constitution of India, and even if the
respondents raised plea of delay and laches on the part of the petitioners, this Court is empowered
to analise the satisfactory explanation offered by the petitioners and would grant relief to such
petitioners, if the petitioners satisfactorily explain the reasons for delay in approaching this Court.
Having come to the conclusion that the respondent-Corporation has violated the norms by
promoting the contesting respondents contrary to the Board orders and the judgment of the Hon'ble
Apex Court in the case of K.Narayanan supra, it is relevant to extract the judgment of the Hon'ble
Apex Court in the case of KULDEEP CHAND VS. UNION OF INDIA reported in 1995 (5) SCC 680.
Paragraph 5 of the said judgment reads as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/18072955/ 23
Malatesh N Kodliyavar vs State Of Karnataka on 27 March, 2023
"5. When the aforesaid facts are taken into consideration, it would be obvious that the
preparation of seniority list per se was illegal. Therefore, the mere fact that he did not
challenge the seniority list, which was illegally prepared, till he was aggrieved for
non-consideration of the claim to the post of accountant, his legitimate right to be
considered cannot be denied. Under these circumstances, the delay is of no
consequence for considering the claims of Ashok Kumar for the post of accountant."
20. Recently, Hon'ble Supreme Court had an occasion to discuss the issue relating to applicability of
delay and laches in the petitions challenging the Seniority list in the case of AJAY KUMAR SHUKLA
AND OTHERS VS. ARVIND RAI and others reported in (2021) SCC Online SC 1195, at paragraphs
21 to 53 reads as under:
"21. We may now discuss the law on the point regarding delay in approaching the
court and in particular challenge to a seniority list. The learned Single Judge had
placed reliance on a judgment of this Court in the case of Shiba Shankar Mohapatra
v. State of Orissa (supra). Dr. B.S. Chauhan, J., after considering the question of
entertaining the petition despite long standing seniority filed at a belated stage
discussed more than a dozen cases on the point including Constitution Bench
judgments and ultimately in paragraph 30 observed that a seniority list which
remains in existence for more than three to four years unchallenged should not be
disturbed. It is also recorded in paragraph 30 that in case someone agitates the issue
of seniority beyond period of three to four years he has to explain the delay and
laches in approaching the adjudicatory forum by furnishing satisfactory explanation.
Paragraph 30 is reproduced below:--
"30. Thus in view of the above, the settled legal proposition that emerges is that once
the seniority had been fixed and it remains in existence for a reasonable period, any
challenge to the same should not be entertained. In K.R. Mudgal, this Court has laid
down, in crystal clear words that a seniority list which remains in existence for 3 to 4
years unchallenged, should not be disturbed. Thus, 3-4 years is a reasonable period
for challenging the seniority and in case someone agitates the issue of seniority
beyond this period, he has to explain the delay and laches in approaching the
adjudicatory forum, by furnishing satisfactory explanation."
22. On the other hand, the Division Bench while shutting out the appellants on the ground of delay
relied upon following judgments of this Court.
• Dayaram Asanand Gursahani v. State of Maharashtra2 • B.S. Bajwa v. State of Punjab3 • Malcom
Lawrence Cecil D'Souza v. Union of India4 • R.S. Makashi v. I.M. Menon5
23. In the case of Dayaram Asanand Gursahani (supra), there was a delay of 9 years. In the case of
B.S. Bajwa (supra), there was a delay of more than a decade. In Malcom Lawrence Cecil D'Souza
(supra), the delay was of 15 years and in R.S. Makashi (supra) there was a delay of 8 years. In all
these cases, this court has recorded that the delay has not been explained. Shiba Shankar Mohapatra
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/18072955/ 24
Malatesh N Kodliyavar vs State Of Karnataka on 27 March, 2023
(Supra) is a judgment of 2010, which has laid down that, three to four years would be a reasonable
period to challenge a seniority list and also that any challenge beyond the aforesaid period would
require satisfactory explanation.
24. In view of the above legal proposition, we now examine the facts of the present case, firstly, as to
whether there was delay of more than three to four years and secondly, if there was delay of more
than three to four years, whether the same has been satisfactorily explained.
25. In October, 2001, when the appointment letters were issued it carried a stipulation that the
seniority would be determined later on as per rules. It is an admitted position that before 2006, the
seniority list of the appellants was not notified. In March, 2006, when the tentative list was
published, it did not mention about the three select lists nor was this fact mentioned when the final
seniority list was published on 05.09.2006. Rather, it clearly mentioned that the seniority list had
been prepared on the basis of merit. This was in fact an incorrect statement. The seniority list had
not been prepared on the basis of merit but on the basis of receipt of the three separate select lists
one after the other. As the Agricultural list was received first on 28.09.1999, all the selected
candidates of agricultural stream were en bloc placed on the top, thereafter the Mechanical list was
received on 06.01.2000, they were placed below the Agricultural stream and lastly, the Civil stream
list was received on 07.11.2000, they were placed at the end.
26. Rules 5 and 8 of Rules 1991 clearly mention that there shall be one list for one selection of direct
recruits. Creating three separate lists for one selection was contrary to the provisions contained in
Rules 5 and 8 of Rules 1991. Rules 2009 clearly mention that seniority would be determined and
prepared as per 1991 Rules. Rule 5 of Rules 1991, dealt with the selections made only through direct
recruitment whereas Rule 8 thereof dealt with the situation where seniority list is to be prepared of
both the direct recruits and the promotees. However, the principles underlined in both these Rules
are the same that there has to be one list for one selection, as is clear from Rule 8(2)(a) and Rule 5 of
Rules 1991.
27. Once it is established that the seniority list was prepared in contravention to the statutory
provisions laid down in Rules 1991, the seniority list could be interfered with. The Appointing
Authority would be bound by the statutory rules and any violation or disregard to the statutory rules
would vitiate the seniority list. The same would be arbitrary, de hors the rules and in conflict with
Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. The only exception to the above would be where there is
unreasonable delay which is unexplained.
28. In the present case, if we accept the submission of the appellants then the delay at best could be
a few months or a year however, if we accept the contentions of the private respondents then the
delay could be of five years. In the first contingency, no explanation would be required. However, in
the second contingency, if the appellants are successful in satisfactorily explaining the delay, then
even this hurdle could be overcome. In the facts of the present case what we find from the final
seniority list of 05.09.2006 is that it nowhere mentioned that there were three separate lists of
separate streams and that they were received on different dates. On the contrary, there was a recital
therein and specific averment to the effect that the list had been prepared on the basis of merit.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/18072955/ 25
Malatesh N Kodliyavar vs State Of Karnataka on 27 March, 2023
Thus, it cannot be said that the appellants were aware of the three separate select lists dispatched by
the Commission on three different dates at the time of publication of final list dated 05.09.2006.
29. It would also be worthwhile to mention here that the appellants had no occasion to know about
the three separate lists either at the time they were dispatched by the Commission or at any time
thereafter as the appointment letters of all selected candidates of all the three streams were issued
simultaneously under Office Order dated 08.10.2001. It would also be relevant to mention that the
order finalizing the seniority list of 05.09.2006 also nowhere mentioned that three separate lists of
three streams were received from the Commission and placed en bloc as received one after the
other.
30. At the time of notifying the tentative list on 29.12.2009, it was not stated anywhere that there
were three separate lists received on three different dates. As such it could not be alleged that the
appellants even at that stage did not file objections regarding preparation of common seniority list.
It was only when the final seniority list was published on 05.03.2010 and in the order finalizing the
list, it was mentioned by the department that there were three separate lists received on three
separate dates and in that sequence the combined seniority was prepared. Thus, it is for the
first-time that appellants came to know of the error on publication of the final seniority list on
05.03.2010.
31. The respondents have not been able to show any material which could clearly indicate that the
appellants had knowledge of three separate lists and the preparation of the seniority list on its basis.
A frail attempt has been made by the respondents referring to office order dated 17.03.2006
Annexure-P-30 to the Appeal @ SLP(C) No. 5435 of 2020 which is the order notifying the tentative
seniority list. Paragraph 3 thereof mentions that the sequence whereunder the selection list of
Junior Engineers selected by the Commission has been received, the seniority has been given in that
sequence. Paragraph 3 reads as under:
"3 : The sequence, where under the selection list of the Junior Engineers selected by
the Commission has been received, in that sequence, the Seniority has been given in
accordance with Seniority detailed therein."
32. A reading of the above paragraph does not refer to any details either of any stream, the year of
selection, the selection being made on the basis of which advertisement or the dates on which
separate lists were received. It is a general statement. This submission of the respondents stands
completely diluted in view of the facts recorded in paragraph 5 and last sentence as contained in
paragraph 25 of the same office order dated 05.09.2006. We will analyse the same but before that
they are reproduced hereunder:
"5. Shri Vinod Kumar Singh has requested to enter his Name in the Seniority List and
requested to grant Seniority in ratio of 50 : 30 : 20 to the
Agriculture/Mechanical/Civil Engineering. In this regard, it is clear that the above
ratio is only for recruitment. From Commission, on 6.01.2000, on 27.01.2000 and on
07.11.2000 list was sent. Therefore, in this sequence, on the basis of merit, the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/18072955/ 26
Malatesh N Kodliyavar vs State Of Karnataka on 27 March, 2023
Seniority has already been assessed. Name of Shri Vinay Kumar has been entered at
the required place in the Seniority List as his Name was left to be entered therein and
as requested to increase and enter his Name in this Seniority List.
xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx
25. "...The Seniority of the candidates selected from the Public Service Commission
have been kept in their Serial of merit."
33. Reading of paragraph 5, it is again mentioned that three lists were received by the Commission
and in that sequence, on the basis of merit, the seniority has been assessed. Paragraph 5 was dealing
with objection of one Vinod Kumar Singh requesting to enter his name in the seniority list and
further requesting to grant seniority in the ratio of 50 : 30 : 20. The competent authority allowed the
request finding that the name of Vinod Kumar Singh was left to be entered and accordingly it was
incorporated at the required place. Further, the last sentence of this office order clearly mentions
that the seniority of the candidates selected from the Commission has been kept in their serial of
merit. It does not refer to any separate merit being considered for preparing the seniority list of the
three separate streams.
34. After coming of Rules 2009, fresh exercise was undertaken for preparation of seniority list. A
tentative list was notified by the Office Order dated 29.12.2009. This Office Order mentions that the
seniority list has to be prepared according to 1991 Rules. While dealing with the finalization of this
tentative list, vide office order dated 05.03.2010, we find reference to disposal of an objection by
Mahesh Chand Bagani and Mahesh Kumar in which they had apparently sought clarification
regarding the requisition send to the Commission and other related aspects. In paragraph 11 of the
Office Order, it is mentioned that the Commission had forwarded the three lists of the Agriculture,
Mechanical and Civil streams separately on 06.01.2000, 27.01.2000 and 07.11.2000 respectively. It
further mentioned that it was in that sequence i.e. the date of receiving that the combined seniority
was assessed. Thus, again the seniority list was finalized in the same sequence as the three lists have
been received and in that order. It is thereafter that the representations were made that the seniority
list of the direct recruits of 2001 was wrongly prepared contrary to the Rules, however, when no
action was taken, Rajiv Nain Upadhyay and fourteen others approached the High Court by way of
W.P. No. 53123 of 2012 in October 2012 which was within a period of two to two and half years and
till such time they had been pursuing their representation after office order dated 05.03.2010. From
the above facts, it is clear that in the first contingency or in the second contingency, the appellants
cannot be found at fault. The Division Bench committed an error in holding that the claim lodged by
the appellant suffered from delay and laches.
35. The plea to defend the seniority list prepared contrary to the statutory provisions on the ground
of delay would be a difficult proposition. Apart from the submission of the appellants that there is
no delay as they came to know of the three separate lists only in March, 2010, even if it is assumed
that there was some delay and a fresh seniority list was being prepared in 2009-2010 again contrary
to the provisions of statutory rules, such seniority list cannot be sustained or defended on the
ground of delay of five years.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/18072955/ 27
Malatesh N Kodliyavar vs State Of Karnataka on 27 March, 2023
36. It is also admitted by the parties that the next promotion of Junior Engineers in the higher grade
is to the post of Assistant Engineer. In the cadre of Assistant Engineer, there are no separate streams
but only one cadre of Assistant Engineers. It is the seniority list of the cadre of Junior Engineers
which would be the feeder cadre for the post of Assistant Engineers. The Junior Engineers of
Agricultural stream of the selection of the year 2001, would have direct march over the Junior
Engineers selected in the same selection of the Mechanical and Civil streams, even though the
overall merit of some or many of Agricultural stream Junior Engineers could be lower than some or
many of the Engineers of the Mechanical and Civil streams. The appointing authority ought to have
prepared a combined merit list based upon the performance or the proficiency on the basis of the
marks received in the selection test as prepared by the Commission. Otherwise, it would amount to
denial of the right of consideration for promotion to a more meritorious candidate as against a
candidate having lesser merit. Right to promotion is not considered to be a fundamental right but
consideration for promotion has now been evolved as a fundamental right.
37. This Court, time and again, has laid emphasis on right to be considered for promotion to be a
fundamental right, as was held by K. Ramaswamy, J., in the case of Director, Lift Irrigation
Corporation Ltd. v. Pravat Kiran Mohanty6 in paragraph 4 of the report which is reproduced below:
"4... There is no fundamental right to promotion, but an employee has only right to
be considered for promotion, when it arises, in accordance with relevant rules. From
this perspective in our view the conclusion of the High Court that the gradation list
prepared by the corporation is in violation of the right of respondent/writ petitioner
to equality enshrined under Article 14 read with Article 16 of the Constitution, and
the respondent/writ petitioner was unjustly denied of the same is obviously
unjustified."
38. A Constitution Bench in case of Ajit Singh v. State of Punjab7, laying emphasis on Article 14 and
Article 16(1) of the Constitution of India held that if a person who satisfies the eligibility and the
criteria for promotion but still is not considered for promotion, then there will be clear violation of
his/her's fundamental right. Jagannadha Rao, J. speaking for himself and Anand, CJI.,
Venkataswami, Pattanaik, Kurdukar, JJ., observed the same as follows in paragraphs 21 and 22 and
27:
"21 : Articles 14 and 16(1) : is right to be considered for promotion a fundamental
right 22 : Article 14 and Article 16(1) are closely connected. They deal with individual
rights of the person. Article 14 demands that the "State shall not deny to any person
equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws". Article 16(1) issues a
positive command that "there shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in
matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the State".
It has been held repeatedly by this Court that clause (1) of Article 16 is a facet of Article 14 and that it
takes its roots from Article 14. The said clause particularises the generality in Article 14 and
identifies, in a constitutional sense "equality of opportunity in matters of employment and
appointment to any office under the State. The word "employment" being wider, there is no dispute
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/18072955/ 28
Malatesh N Kodliyavar vs State Of Karnataka on 27 March, 2023
that it takes within its fold, the aspect of promotions to posts above the stage of initial level of
recruitment. Article 16(1) provides to every employee otherwise eligible for promotion or who comes
within the zone of consideration, a fundamental right to be "considered" for promotion. Equal
opportunity here means the right to be "considered" for promotion. If a person satisfies the
eligibility and zone criteria but is not considered for promotion, then there will be a clear infraction
of his fundamental right to be "considered" for promotion, which is his personal right.
"Promotion based on equal opportunity and seniority attached to such promotion are
facets of fundamental right under Article 16(1) xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx
27. In our opinion, the above view expressed in Ashok Kumar Gupta and followed in
Jagdish Lal and other cases, if it is intended to lay down that the right guarantee to
employees for being "considered" for promotion according to relevant rules of
recruitment by promotion (i.e. whether on the basis of seniority or merit) is only a
statutory right and not a fundamental right, we cannot accept the proposition. We
have already stated earlier that the right to equal opportunity in the matter of
promotion in the sense of a right to be "considered" for promotion is indeed a
fundamental right guaranteed under Article 16(1) and this has never been doubted in
any other case before Ashok Kumar Gupta right from 1950."
39. This Court in Major General H.M. Singh, VSM v. UOI8, again reiterated the legal position, i.e.
right to be considered for promotion as a fundamental right enshrined under Article 14 and Article
16 of the Constitution of India. The relevant extract from paragraph 28 is reproduced below:
"28. The question that arises for consideration is, whether the non-consideration of
the claim of the appellant would violate the fundamental rights vested in him under
Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. The answer to the aforesaid query
would be in the affirmative, subject to the condition that the respondents were
desirous of filling the vacancy of Lieutenant-General, when it became available on
1-1-2007. The factual position depicted in the counter-affidavit reveals that the
respondents indeed were desirous of filling up the said vacancy. In the above view of
the matter, if the appellant was the senior most serving Major-General eligible for
consideration (which he undoubtedly was), he most definitely had the fundamental
right of being considered against the above vacancy, and also the fundamental right
of being promoted if he was adjudged suitable. Failing which, he would be deprived
of his fundamental right of equality before the law, and equal protection of the laws,
extended by Article 14 of the Constitution of India. We are of the view that it was in
order to extend the benefit of the fundamental right enshrined under Article 14 of the
Constitution of India, that he was allowed extension in service on two occasions,
firstly by the Presidential Order dated 29-2-2008, and thereafter, by a further
Presidential Order dated 30-5-2008. The above orders clearly depict that the
aforesaid extension in service was granted to the appellant for a period of three
months (and for a further period of one month), or till the approval of the ACC,
whichever is earlier. By the aforesaid orders, the respondents desired to treat the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/18072955/ 29
Malatesh N Kodliyavar vs State Of Karnataka on 27 March, 2023
appellant justly, so as to enable him to acquire the honour of promotion to the rank of
Lieutenant-General (in case the recommendation made in his favour by the Selection
Board was approved by the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet, stands
affirmed). The action of the authorities in depriving the appellant due consideration
for promotion to the rank of the Lieutenant- General would have resulted in violation
of his fundamental right under Article 14 of the Constitution of India. Such an action
at the hands of the respondents would unquestionably have been arbitrary."
40. If the seniority list is allowed to be sustained then the engineers who are more meritorious in the
Mechanical and Civil streams than the Junior Engineers of the Agricultural stream would be
deprived of their right of being considered for promotion and in fact their right would accrue only
after all the Junior Engineers of the Agricultural stream selected in the same selection are granted
promotion. For these reasons also the seniority list in question must go.
41. The other ground taken by the High Court for non- suiting the appellants were that they had not
impleaded all the affected Junior Engineers. For the said proposition, the Division Bench of the
High Court has placed reliance upon judgment of this Court in the case of Ranjan Kumar v. State of
Bihar9. The above case was in respect of selection and appointment on the ground that the same
had been made only on the basis of interview without holding any written test. The High Court had
quashed such selection and appointments even of those appointees who were not even parties to the
petition. It was in these circumstances that this Court held that the appointments of non-parties
could not be quashed. Facts of the said case are clearly distinguishable.
42. The Division Bench of the High Court also relied upon another judgment of this Court in
Prabodh Verma v. State of Uttar Pradesh10. This case again related to challenge to appointments
and in the said case there was no impleadment even in the representative capacity. In such
circumstances, this Court said that the petition was liable to be dismissed for non-joinder of
necessary parties. In fact, this judgment helps the appellants. Paragraph 50 thereof is reproduced
below:
"50(1) : A High Court ought not to hear and dispose of a writ petition under Article
226 of the Constitution without the persons who would be vitally affected by its
judgment being before it as respondents or at least some of them being before it as
respondents in a representative capacity if their number is too large to join them as
respondents individually, and, if the petitioners refuse to so join them, the High
Court ought to dismiss the petition for non-joinder of necessary parties."
43. The third case relied upon by the Division Bench for the above proposition namely State of
Uttaranchal v. Madan Mohan Joshi11 was again a case where none of the affected parties were
impleaded not even in the representative capacity. In such circumstances, this Court remanded the
matter to the High Court leaving it open to the original petitioners therein to move an appropriate
application for impleading some of the affected teachers in their representative capacity.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/18072955/ 30
Malatesh N Kodliyavar vs State Of Karnataka on 27 March, 2023
44. The fourth case relied upon by Division Bench on the above proposition is Indu Shekhar Singh v.
State of U.P.12. In this case also, the affected parties were not impleaded and this Court relied upon
the judgment of this Court in Prabodh Verma (supra).
45. In the case of Tridip Kumar Dingal v. State of West Bengal13, C.K. Thakker, J., held that the case
falls within the ambit of non-joinder of necessary parties as none of the 66 candidates against whom
the complaint was made, were made parties. It further held that some of the respondents should
have been arrayed in representative capacity. Paragraph 41 is reproduced below:
"41 : Regarding protection granted to 66 candidates, from the record it is clear that
their names were sponsored by the employment exchange and they were selected and
appointed in 1998-1999. The candidates who were unable to get themselves. selected
and who raised a grievance and made a complaint before the Tribunal by filing
applications ought to have joined them (selected candidates) as respondents in the
original application, which was not done. In any case, some of them ought to have
been arrayed as respondents in a "representative capacity". That was also not done.
The Tribunal was, therefore, wholly right in holding that in absence of selected and
appointed candidates and without affording opportunity of hearing to them, their
selection could not be set aside."
46. In the recent case of Mukul Kumar Tyagi v. The State of Uttar Pradesh,14 Ashok Bhushan, J.,
laid emphasis that when there is a long list of candidates against whom the case is proceeded, then it
becomes unnecessary and irrelevant to implead each and every candidate. If some of the candidates
are impleaded then they will be said to be representing the interest of rest of the candidates as well.
The relevant portion of paragraph 75 from the judgment is reproduced below:
"75...... We may further notice that Division Bench also noticed the above argument
of non-impleadment of all the selected candidates in the writ petition but Division
Bench has not based its judgment on the above argument. When the inclusion in the
select list of large number of candidates is on the basis of an arbitrary or illegal
process, the aggrieved parties can complain and in such cases necessity of
impleadment of each and every person cannot be insisted. Furthermore, when select
list contained names of 2211 candidates, it becomes unnecessary to implead every
candidate in view of the nature of the challenge, which was levelled in the writ
petition. Moreover, few selected candidates were also impleaded in the writ petitions
in representative capacity."
47. The present case is a case of preparation of seniority list and that too in a situation where the
appellants (original writ petitioners) did not even know the marks obtained by them or their
proficiency in the examination conducted by the Commission. The challenge was on the ground that
the Rules on the preparation of seniority list had not been followed. There were 18 private
respondents arrayed to the writ petition. The original petitioners could not have known who all
would be affected. They had thus broadly impleaded 18 of such Junior Engineers who could be
adversely affected. In matters relating to service jurisprudence, time and again it has been held that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/18072955/ 31
Malatesh N Kodliyavar vs State Of Karnataka on 27 March, 2023
it is not essential to implead each and every one who could be affected but if a section of such
affected employees is impleaded then the interest of all is represented and protected. In view of the
above, it is well settled that impleadment of a few of the affected employees would be sufficient
compliance of the principle of joinder of parties and they could defend the interest of all affected
persons in their representative capacity. Non- joining of all the parties cannot be held to be fatal.
48. The Division Bench has also dealt with an issue which according to us was totally irrelevant and
alien to the adjudication of the present appeals. In paragraph 45 of the judgment of the Division
Bench there is a reference to an issue where a party takes calculated chances of participating in
selection/appointment process and later turns around after being unsuccessful would be hit by
doctrine of estoppel. For the said proposition, the Division Bench made detailed discussions in
paragraphs 46, 47, 48 and 49 of the judgment and relied upon a number of case laws. In our
considered view, this issue was not at all relevant. The said issue does not arise in the present case.
The appellants/original writ petitioners had never challenged the selection process. The challenge
was only to preparation of the seniority list. As such, this discussion by the Division Bench is totally
irrelevant.
49. The Division Bench further in paragraph 51 had in a generalized and vague manner recorded
that the authorities relied upon by the learned single Judge were rendered in a different fact
situation and were not applicable. The Division Bench did not consider the judgments relied upon
by the learned Single Judge but only made this passing remarks. What we find is that the authorities
relied upon by the learned Single Judge were relevant and correctly applied.
50. Further, the Division Bench in paragraphs 51, 52, 53 proceeded to deal with the delay stating it
to be 11 years, the basis for calculation of 11 years was that the seniority list of 2006 was challenged
by way of amendment by the appellants in the year 2017 and therefore there was a delay of 11 years.
This discussion by Division Bench also cannot be sustained. The first seniority list was prepared in
2006. It was not disclosed as to how the seniority list has been prepared by treating the three
separate lists independently on their merits but not as a result of combined merit of the three lists. It
was only in 2010 that the appellants came to know of the fallacy and soon thereafter they challenged
the seniority list of 2010. Even if, they did not challenge the seniority list of 2006, 2010 seniority list
could always be revisited, reviewed and prepared afresh, if the same was quashed. The appellants
could not have been at any loss even if they had not challenged the 2006 seniority list.
51. The reasoning given in paragraphs 54, 55, 56 regarding issue of single selection is also not
sustainable in view of Rules 1991 as also Rules 2009.
52. Lastly, paragraph 57 of the judgment of the Division Bench which deals with Rule 5 and 8 of
1991 Rules, we may only reiterate that, whether it was Rule 5 which was applicable or Rule 8 which
was applicable, the seniority inter se of direct recruits to one selection has to be one combined list
based on the performance and the marks awarded in the examination prepared either by the
Commission or the Committee, as the case may be. True, the learned Single Judge, in the operative
portion mentioned that a fresh seniority list be prepared in accordance with Rule 5 and apparently
did not consider the effect of Rule 8, would not vitiate the judgment inasmuch as the basis for
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/18072955/ 32
Malatesh N Kodliyavar vs State Of Karnataka on 27 March, 2023
preparation of the seniority list of direct recruits was the same in both the Rules. It may be noted
that there is no lis inter se between direct recruits and promotees.
53. For all the reasons recorded above, we find that the Division Bench fell in error in allowing the
appeal and dismissing the writ petition. The learned Single Judge was right in his view in setting
aside the final seniority list and directing the appointing authority for preparation of fresh seniority
list in accordance with Rules 1991, be it Rule 5 or Rule 8 thereof."
21. Following the dictum of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Ajay Kumar Shukla (supra), I am
of the view that, the contentions raised by learned counsel appearing for the respondents, with
regard to delay and latches cannot be accepted.
22. I have also noticed that, the respondent-Corporation has amended the Board orders, on
16.08.1986 and 27.12.1996 particularly Note 4 paragraph 2, wherein, minimum service of 7 years as
Junior Engineer was mandated to be consider while appointing as Assistant Engineer. It is also
gathered from the writ petition that, despite the direction to prepare the fresh gradation list, as per
Gurusripad's case, respondent- Corporation did implement its own board orders, and acted contrary
to the orders and provided retrospective seniority to the ABT Junior Engineers. Taking into
consideration the aforesaid aspects, I am of the view that, the contentions raised by the respondents
not only with regard to delay and laches but also regarding suppression of materials, cannot be
accepted.
23. It is pertinent to mention here that, statutory rules cannot override by executive orders, by the
respondent- Corporation (see. (1998) 8 SCC 469). In the event, interference is not made in the
present writ petition to set right the wrong being continued by the respondent-Corporation and
allowing for continuing wrong with the determination of the seniority on the basis of struck down
orders of 1986 by the Board, despite the same is amended in terms of the judgment of this Court,
same would amounts to perpetuate the illegality and arbitrary exercise of power by the
respondent-Corporation providing retrospective seniority to ABT Engineers and same would
amounts to violation of Article 14 of Constitution of India. Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of P.C.
SETI VS. UNION OF INDIA reported in (1975) 4 SCC 67 held that delay cannot be a ground to deny
the relief to the aggrieved parties, when there is violation of their constitutional rights. It is the duty
of the Court to enforce the fundamental rights and the ground of delay and laches is an exception to
the same. Petitioners have clearly demonstrated that the discrimination has been made by
promoting ABT Juniors.
24. This Court has categorically ordered in WP No.35999 of 2019 that the respondent-Corporation
shall consider the representation dated 05.06.2017 made by the petitioners in accordance with the
declaration of law made by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of P. Sudhakar (supra). The
aforesaid, judgment was questioned in Writ Appeal No.41 of 2020 and the Division Bench, by its
order dated 22.01.2020, directed the respondent-Corporation, accordingly, to address the grievance
of the petitioners in the light of judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of P. Sudhakar Rao
(supra). Thereafter, the petitioners have made one more representation dated 18.12.2019
(Annexure-K) to the writ petition. Petitioners have also brought to the notice of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/18072955/ 33
Malatesh N Kodliyavar vs State Of Karnataka on 27 March, 2023
respondent-Corporation, objecting the ranking made in the provisional seniority list date
08.05.2017 on the ground that the Junior Engineers who had been appointed by transfer to the
cadre of Assistant Engineer and promoted them by granting seniority with retrospective effect and
same is contrary to the law declared by Hon'ble Supreme Court in P. Sudhakar case (Supra).
Petitioners have also highlighted the Board orders from the inception is order 26.07.1986 till the
27.12.1996. Judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of K.Narayanan (supra) and other
judgment were also placed before the respondent-Corporation to take decision in the matter is a
manner known to law. At this juncture, it is relevant to cite the dictum of Hon'ble Apex Court in the
case of DIRECTOR OF SETTLEMETNS, A.P. AND OTHERS vs. M.R. APPARAO AND ANOTHER
reported in (2002) 4 SCC 638 at paragraph 17, Hon'ble Supreme Court held as under:
"17. Coming to the third question, which is more important from the point of
consideration of the High Court's power for issuance of mandamus, it appears that
the Constitution empowers the High Court to issue writs, directions or orders in the
nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari for the
enforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part III and for any other purpose
under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. It is, therefore essentially, a power
upon the High Court for issuance of high prerogative writs for enforcement of
fundamental rights as well as non- fundamental or ordinary legal rights, which may
come within the expression "for any other purpose". The powers of the High Courts
under Article 226 though are discretionary and no limits can be placed upon their
discretion, they must be exercised along the recognised lines and subject to certain
self-imposed limitations. The expression "for any other purpose" in Article 226,
makes the jurisdiction of the High Courts more extensive but yet the Courts must
exercise the same with certain restraints and within some parameters. One of the
conditions for exercising power under Article 226 for issuance of a mandamus is that
the Court must come to the conclusion that the aggrieved person has a legal right,
which entitles him to any of the rights and that such right has been infringed. In
other words, existence of a legal right of a citizen and performance of any
corresponding legal duty by the State or any public authority, could be enforced by
issuance of a writ of mandamus. "Mandamus" means a command. It differs from the
writs of prohibition or certiorari in its demand for some activity on the part of the
body or person to whom it is addressed. Mandamus is a command issued to direct
any person, corporation, inferior courts or Government, requiring him or them to do
some particular thing therein specified which appertains to his or their office and is
in the nature of a public duty. A mandamus is available against any public authority
including administrative and local bodies, and it would lie to any person who is under
a duty imposed by a statute or by the common law to do a particular act. In order to
obtain a writ or order in the nature of mandamus, the applicant has to satisfy that he
has a legal right to the performance of a legal duty by the party against whom the
mandamus is sought and such right must be subsisting on the date of the petition
(Kalyan Singh v. State of U.P.. The duty that may be enjoined by mandamus may be
one imposed by the Constitution, a statute, common law or by rules or orders having
the force of law. When the aforesaid principle is applied to the case in hand, the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/18072955/ 34
Malatesh N Kodliyavar vs State Of Karnataka on 27 March, 2023
so-called right of the respondents, depending upon the conclusion that the
Amendment Act is constitutionally invalid and, therefore, the right to get interim
payment will continue till the final decision of the Board of Revenue, cannot be
sustained when the Supreme Court itself has upheld the constitutional validity of the
Amendment Act in Venkatagiri case [State of A.P. v. Rajah of Venkatagiri, on
6-2-1986 in Civil Appeals Nos. 398 and 1385 of 1972 and further declared in the said
appeals that interim payments are payable till determination is made by the Director
under Section 39(1). The High Court in exercise of power of issuance of mandamus
could not have said anything contrary to that on the ground that the earlier judgment
in favour of the respondents became final, not being challenged. The impugned
mandamus issued by the Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in the
teeth of the declaration made by the Supreme Court as to the constitutionality of the
Amendment Act would be an exercise of power and jurisdiction when the
respondents did not have the subsisting legally enforceable right under the very Act
itself. In the aforesaid circumstances, we have no hesitation to come to the conclusion
that the High Court committed serious error in issuing the mandamus in question for
enforcement of the so-called right which never subsisted on the date, the Court issued
the mandamus in view of the decision of this Court in Venkatagiri case [State of A.P.
v. Rajah of Venkatagiri, . In our view, therefore, the said conclusion of the High Court
must be held to be erroneous."
25. It is also relevant to extract the law laid down by the Ho'ble Apex Court in the case of
CHAIRMAN, STATE BANK OF INDA AND OTHERS VS. M.J. JAMES reported in (2022)2 SCC
301. Paragraph 38 to 41 reads as under:
"38. In Ram Chand v. Union of India [Ram Chand v. Union of India, and State of U.P.
v. Manohar [State of U.P. v. Manohar, this Court observed that if the statutory
authority has not performed its duty within a reasonable time, it cannot justify the
same by taking the plea that the person who has been deprived of his rights has not
approached the appropriate forum for relief. If a statutory authority does not pass
any orders and thereby fails to comply with the statutory mandate within reasonable
time, they normally should not be permitted to take the defence of laches and delay.
If at all, in such cases, the delay furnishes a cause of action, which in some cases as
elucidated in Union of India v. Tarsem Singh [Union of India v. Tarsem Singh, may
be continuing cause of action. The State being a virtuous litigant should meet the
genuine claims and not deny them for want of action on their part. However, this
general principle would not apply when, on consideration of the facts, the court
concludes that the respondent had abandoned his rights, which may be either express
or implied from his conduct. Abandonment implies intentional act to acknowledge,
as has been held in para 6 of Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills Co. Ltd. v. State of U.P.
(Applying this principle of acquiescence to the precept of delay and laches, this Court
in U.P. Jal Nigam v. Jaswant Singh after referring to several judgments, has accepted
the following elucidation in Halsbury's Laws of England : (Jaswant Singh case, SCC
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/18072955/ 35
Malatesh N Kodliyavar vs State Of Karnataka on 27 March, 2023
pp. 470-71, paras 12-13)
12. The statement of law has also been summarised in Halsbury's Laws of England,
Para 911, p. 395 as follows:
In determining whether there has been such delay as to amount to laches, the chief
points to be considered are:
(i) acquiescence on the claimant's part; and
(ii) any change of position that has occurred on the defendant's part.
Acquiescence in this sense does not mean standing by while the violation of a right is in progress,
but assent after the violation has been completed and the claimant has become aware of it. It is
unjust to give the claimant a remedy where, by his conduct, he has done that which might fairly be
regarded as equivalent to a waiver of it; or where by his conduct and neglect, though not waiving the
remedy, he has put the other party in a position in which it would not be reasonable to place him if
the remedy were afterwards to be asserted. In such cases lapse of time and delay are most material.
Upon these considerations rests the doctrine of laches.'
13. In view of the statement of law as summarised above, the respondents are guilty since the
respondents have acquiesced in accepting the retirement and did not challenge the same in time. If
they would have been vigilant enough, they could have filed writ petitions as others did in the
matter. Therefore, whenever it appears that the claimants lost time or whiled it away and did not
rise to the occasion in time for filing the writ petitions, then in such cases, the court should be very
slow in granting the relief to the incumbent. Secondly, it has also to be taken into consideration the
question of acquiescence or waiver on the part of the incumbent whether other parties are going to
be prejudiced if the relief is granted. In the present case, if the respondents would have challenged
their retirement being violative of the provisions of the Act, perhaps the Nigam could have taken
appropriate steps to raise funds so as to meet the liability but by not asserting their rights the
respondents have allowed time to pass and after a lapse of couple of years, they have filed writ
petitions claiming the benefit for two years. That will definitely require the Nigam to raise funds
which is going to have serious financial repercussions on the financial management of the Nigam.
Why should the court come to the rescue of such persons when they themselves are guilty of waiver
and acquiescence?"
39. Before proceeding further, it is important to clarify distinction between
"acquiescence" and "delay and laches". Doctrine of acquiescence is an equitable
doctrine which applies when a party having a right stands by and sees another
dealing in a manner inconsistent with that right, while the act is in progress and after
violation is completed, which conduct reflects his assent or accord. He cannot
afterwards complain. In literal sense, the term acquiescence means silent assent, tacit
consent, concurrence, or acceptance, which denotes conduct that is evidence of an
intention of a party to abandon an equitable right and also to denote conduct from
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/18072955/ 36
Malatesh N Kodliyavar vs State Of Karnataka on 27 March, 2023
which another party will be justified in inferring such an intention. Acquiescence can
be either direct with full knowledge and express approbation, or indirect where a
person having the right to set aside the action stands by and sees another dealing in a
manner inconsistent with that right and in spite of the infringement takes no action
mirroring acceptance. However, acquiescence will not apply if lapse of time is of no
importance or consequence.
40. Laches unlike limitation is flexible. However, both limitation and laches destroy
the remedy but not the right. Laches like acquiescence is based upon equitable
considerations, but laches unlike acquiescence imports even simple passivity. On the
other hand, acquiescence implies active assent and is based upon the rule of estoppel
in pais. As a form of estoppel, it bars a party afterwards from complaining of the
violation of the right. Even indirect acquiescence implies almost active consent,
which is not to be inferred by mere silence or inaction which is involved in laches.
Acquiescence in this manner is quite distinct from delay. Acquiescence virtually
destroys the right of the person. Given the aforesaid legal position, inactive
acquiescence on the part of the respondent can be inferred till the filing of the appeal,
and not for the period post filing of the appeal. Nevertheless, this acquiescence being
in the nature of estoppel bars the respondent from claiming violation of the right of
fair representation.
41. The questions of prejudice, change of position, creation of third-party rights or
interests on the part of the party seeking relief are important and relevant aspects as
delay may obscure facts, encourage dubious claims, and may prevent fair and just
adjudication. Often, relevant and material evidence go missing or are not traceable
causing prejudice to the opposite party. It is, therefore, necessary for the court to
consciously examine whether a party has chosen to sit over the matter and has woken
up to gain any advantage and benefit, which aspects have been noticed in Dehri
Rohtas Light Railway Co. Ltd. v. District Board, Bhojpur [Dehri Rohtas Light Railway
Co. Ltd. v. District Board, Bhojpurand State of Maharashtra v. Digambar [State of
Maharashtra v. Digambar. These facets, when proven, must be factored and
balanced, even when there is delay and laches on the part of the authorities. These
have bearing on grant and withholding of relief. Therefore, we have factored in the
aspect of prejudice to the appellants in view of the relief granted in the impugned
judgment."
26. Having applied the dictum of the Apex Court to the factual aspects on record, it is relevant to
borne in mind that the appointment by transfer is an appointment of in-service candidates- Junior
Engineers (cadre of Group-C) to the post of Assistant Engineers (cadre of Group-B) on the basis of
acquiring Degree qualification without appearing for the competitive examination nor following the
reservation - roster as mandated in the Constitution of India, and therefore, the appointment by
transfer is itself is an exception to the regular mode of appointment/promotion to the higher cadre
of Assistant Engineer. In that view of the matter, following the law declared by Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of P. Sudhakar Rao (supra) and K. Narayanan (supra) and also order passed by
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/18072955/ 37
Malatesh N Kodliyavar vs State Of Karnataka on 27 March, 2023
this Court in Gurusripad case, the directly recruited Assistant Engineers takes precedence over the
Assistant Engineers who were promoted by ABT. Regulation 2(a) of Chapter IV of Rerecruitment
and Promotion Regulation makes it clear that the employees appointed substantially in clear
vacancies shall be Senior to all persons appointed on officiating or any other basis in the same cadre
of service. Regulation 3 of the same, provided that the employees recruited by promotion or by
direct recruitment will take precedence over the promoted employees where the date of
appointment is the same. Regulation 2(a) and 3(a) shall be read conjunctively with Regulation 7
which mandates that the promotions of eligible employees shall be made on seniority-cum-merit
basis. Perusal of the aforementioned Regulations, envisages that the appointment by transfer (ABT)
Engineers, cannot claim their seniority in the cadre of Assistant Engineer before they takes birth in
the said cadre. The issue involved in this writ petition is not with regard to Seniority however,
Seniority as claimed by the parties is the by-product of appointment and if there is no appointment,
the question of Seniority does not arise. In that view of the matter, the contentions rasied by the
learned counsel appearing for the parties banking upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in
Shiba Shankar (supra) and other cases relating to delay and laches, are not applicable to facts on
record as the cases referred to by the learned counsel appearing for the respondents are with regard
to Seniority disputing in a particular cadre and does not deal with the issue of appointments made
to the retrospective dates and it is pertinent to mentioned here that the issue involved in this writ
petition is with regard to non implementation of the judgments of the Hon'ble Apex Court in
K.Narayananan (supra) and Gurusripad (supra) viz-a-viz application of the amended Board orders
dated 16.08.1996 and 27.12.1996 and therefore, the illegal benefits have been extended to the Junior
Engineers appointed by transfer to the cadre of Assistant Engineer and therefore, said illegality has
to be put an end by allowing this writ petition. If not so, the illegality will be perpetuate and further
promotions will be made in violation of Rules, Regulations, Orders passed by the Hon'ble Apex
Court in the aforementioned cases, and that apart two amended orders of the Board have not been
implemented in its true spirit. I have also borne in mind that, appointment by transfer is only an
appointment but not to promotion. Junior Engineers who were working as one Rank below the
Assistant Engineers had been promoted and placed above by providing impugned seniority and
thereby such Junior Engineers who were working under the Assistant Engineers have been
appointed and placed above in the Seniority of Assistant Engineers under whom they were working.
This aspect of the matter has not dealt by the court referred to by the learned counsel appearing for
the respondents. Therefore, I am of the view that, the impugned endorsement dated 05.03.2020 is
contrary to Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India and consequently, the Official
Memorandum dated 04.11.2000 issued by the respondent- Corporation is contrary to Board orders
dated 16.08.1996 and 27.12.1996. In the result, I pass the following:
ORDER
(i) Writ petition is allowed;
(ii) Endorsement dated 05.03.2020 (Annexure-Q) issued by the respondent No.3 is
hereby quashed and direction is issued to the respondent-Corporation to redo the
Seniority in accordance with the judgments of Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of K.
Narayanan (Supra) and P. Sudhakar Rao (Supra) and in terms of the Board orders

dated 16.08.1996 and 27.12.1996 (Annexure-C and D respectively), within a period of
six weeks from the date of receipt of this order.
(iii) It is made clear that having taken note of judgments of Hon'ble Apex Court in case of K.
Narayanan (Supra) and P. Sudhakar Rao (Supra), respondent-Corporation is directed to implement
the Board orders dated 16.08.1996 and 27.12.1996 with effect from 26.07.1986, date on which the
Board order produced at Annexure-A was notified and no further promotion shall be effected till
implementation of the amended Board Order dated 16.08.1996 and dated 27.12.1996 effect from
26.07.1986.
Ordered accordingly.
