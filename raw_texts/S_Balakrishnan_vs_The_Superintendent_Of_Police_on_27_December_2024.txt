ORDER
This Writ Petition has been filed challenging the charge memo issued by the first respondent herein
in Tha.Pa.No.95/2024, dated 30.08.2024
2.Mr.A.Baskaran, learned Additional Government Pleader takes notice for the respondents.
3.With the consent of the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner and the learned Additional
Government Pleader, this Writ Petition is taken up for final disposal at the time of admission itself.
4.The brief facts of the case, which are necessary for disposal of this Writ Petition, are as follows:
The petitioner was selected to the post of Grade II Police Constable in Tamil Nadu
Uniform Service Recruitment Board in the year 2003 and posted at Battalion No.VII.
In the year 2021, the petitioner was https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis transferred to
Vijayanarayanam Police Station, Tirunelveli District.
Presently, the petitioner is working as Head Constable under the fourth respondent.
(ii) The first respondent issued charge memo dated 30.08.2024 consisting of two
charges, viz., the petitioner received for a sum Rs.
10,000/- from one Sudalaimuthu, who was an accused in Crime No.101 of 2022 under Sections
291(b), 353, 332 and 506(ii) of IPC, not to take action against him under Goondas Act and further
the petitioner demanded Rs.2,000/- from one Muthuraman and received Rs.1,000/- in the
Parappadi Petrol Bunk as per his instructions. (ii) The above actions contravene Rule 24 of the
Tamil Nadu Subordinate Police Officers Conduct Rules, 1954.
(iii) A mere reading of the statement of the witnesses and the audio conversation referred to in the
annexure exhibit, it is clear that the petitioner has not committed any misconduct as alleged in the
charge memo. The impugned charge memo is nothing but an outcome of an non-application of
mind, non-consideration of relevant materials, initiated at the instance the persons having mala-fide
intention against the petitioner and also is a selective in nature. Hence, this writ petition.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
5.The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner would submit that the impugned charge
memo is liable to be quashed on the sole ground that the first respondent does not have authority to
initiate disciplinary proceedings. A mere reading of the statement of the witnesses and audio clips
do not disclose any misconduct committed by the petitioner. The bare perusal of the statement of
witnesses and audio clips would have made it clear to the first respondent that the petitioner was
not involved any misconduct as alleged in the charge memo. He would submit that both the charges
are vague in nature. The impugned charge memo against the petitioner is liable to be quashed on the
ground of colourable exercise of power and selective in nature. The said Sudalaimuthu in his
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138762492/ 2
S.Balakrishnan vs The Superintendent Of Police on 27 December, 2024
statement and in the audio clip has categorically mentioned that it was only on behalf of Naga
Kumari one Anthony Prabhu had received bribe from him. Without initiating any disciplinary
proceedings against the said Naga Kumari, charge memo has been issued against the petitioner. The
petitioner could have been added only as an witness but has been made a delinquent and forced to
face ordeal by the disciplinary proceedings for no fault committed by the petitioner. In support of
his contention, the learned counsel for the petitioner relied on https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis a
judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the decision reported in (2009) 12 SCC 78 (Union of India &
Others Vs Gyan Chand Chattar).
6.Per contra, the learned Additional Government Pleader on behalf of the respondents would
submit that the impugned charge memo has been issued only on 30.08.2024 and the petitioner had
chosen to give reply dated 05.12.2024. Disciplinary authority has also appointed an enquiry officer
and the petitioner has also appeared before the enquiry officer and the departmental proceedings is
under way. He would submit that the petitioner can very well take his defence, during the enquiry
proceedings. Charge memo cannot be quashed at this stage.
7.It is not in dispute that the first respondent has issued charge memo dated 30.08.2024 consisting
of two charges, viz., the petitioner received for a sum Rs.10,000/- from one Sudalaimuthu, who was
an accused in Crime No.101 of 2022 under Sections 291(b), 353, 332 and 506(ii) of IPC, not to take
action against him under Goondas Act and further the petitioner demanded Rs.2,000/- from one
Muthuraman and received Rs.1,000/- in the Parappadi Petrol Bunk as per his instructions.
(ii) The above actions contravene Rule 24 of the Tamil Nadu Subordinate
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Police Officers Conduct Rules, 1954. At this juncture, it is relevant
to cite that the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in (2006) 12 Supreme Court Cases 28
in the case of Union of India and another vs. Kunisetty Satyanarayana, wherein it has been held as
follows:-
â€œ13. It is well settled by a series of decisions of this Court that ordinarily no writ lies
against a charge sheet or show-cause notice vide Executive Engineer, Bihar State
Housing Board vs. Ramdesh Kumar Singh and others JT 1995 (8) SC 331, Special
Director and another vs. Mohd. Ghulam Ghouse and another AIR 2004 SC 1467,
Ulagappa and others vs. Divisional Commissioner, Mysore and others 2001(10) SCC
639, State of U.P. vs. Brahm Datt Sharma and another AIR 1987 SC 943 etc.
14. The reason why ordinarily a writ petition should not be entertained against a
mere show-cause notice or charge-sheet is that at that stage the writ petition may be
held to be premature. A mere charge-
sheet or show-cause notice does not give rise to any cause of action, because it does not amount to
an adverse order which affects the rights of any party unless the same has been issued by a person
having no jurisdiction to do so. It is quite possible that after considering the reply to the show-cause
notice or after holding an enquiry the authority concerned may drop the proceedings and/or hold
that the charges are not https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis established. It is well settled that a writ
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138762492/ 3
S.Balakrishnan vs The Superintendent Of Police on 27 December, 2024
lies when some right of any party is infringed. A mere show-cause notice or charge-sheet does not
infringe the right of any one. It is only when a final order imposing some punishment or otherwise
adversely affecting a party is passed, that the said party can be said to have any grievance.
15. Writ jurisdiction is discretionary jurisdiction and hence such discretion under Article 226 should
not ordinarily be exercised by quashing a show-cause notice or charge sheet.
16. No doubt, in some very rare and exceptional cases the High Court can quash a charge-sheet or
show- cause notice if it is found to be wholly without jurisdiction or for some other reason if it is
wholly illegal. However, ordinarily the High Court should not interfere in such a matter.
8. By applying the ratio laid down in the judgment cited supra, in the case on hand, it is an admitted
fact that the petitioner had submitted his representation to the charge memo and the first
respondent has appointed Deputy Superintendent of Police (AR), Tirunelveli as an enquiry officer.
The writ petitioner herein has also appeared before the enquiry officer on 19.12.2024 and the
enquiry was adjourned to 24.12.2024. When the petitioner had participated in the enquiry
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis proceedings, does not give rise any cause of action. The petitioner
very well defend in case before the enquiry officer. It is quite possible, after holding an enquiry the
authority concern may drop the proceedings/ or hold that the charges are not established. Hence,
there is no merit in this petition and the same is liable to be dismissed. The respondents are directed
to expedite the enquiry proceedings in accordance with law.
9. In the result, this writ petition is dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs. Consequently,
connected miscellaneous petition is closed.
