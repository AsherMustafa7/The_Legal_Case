(Per: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE S. B. PD. SINGH)
Date : 25-09-2025
Heard the parties.
2. The appellant has come up in this appeal against
judgment dated 08.07.2011 and decree dated 21.07.2011
passed by the learned Principal Judge, Family Court,
Vaishali at Hajipur in O.S. Case No. 162 of 2010, whereby

Rahmat Rozy vs Sushil Kumar @ Sushil Kumar Bh on 25 September, 2025
No. 1 and the appellant had performed love marriage on
01.03.2004
and registered their marriage at the Civil Court, Patna. The marriage was consummated and a
female-child was born out of the wedlock. The religion of the respondent-husband and the
appellant-wife was different. Initially at the time of marriage, the appellant-wife accepted the
proposal of the respondent No. 1 to convert herself into Hinduism but subsequently she denied and
pressurized the respondent No. 1 to convert into Islam. The respondent No. 1 took good care of the
appellant while she delivered a female child and when he went to to the place of his sertice at Pune,
he managed to get a rented house for the appellant- wife at Hajipur to live with her father and also
provided a servant namely Chandrika Paswan (respondent No. 2). The appellant thereafter
pressurized the respondent No. 1 to transfer one kattha of land in her name which was denied by the
respondent-husband. However, in order to maintain peace in the family, the father of the
respondent-husband had transferred one kathha of land to the appellant-wife through a registered
sale-deed on 21.09.2007. In the year, 2007 itself, when the respondent-husband told her to Patna
High Court MA No.178 of 2012 dt.25-09-2025 accompany him at his place of posting, she flatly
denied and also refused to cohibit with him. The appellant, in order to put pressure upon the
respondent-husband has filed criminal cases against him and other in-laws family members. The
respondent-husband made all his efforts to bring the appellant back to her matrimonial house but
she was not ready to live with the respondent-husband and started living separately from
17.11.2007. The appellant- wife has also filed a case for maintenance. The respondent- husband
subsequently came to know that appellant-wife has illegal marital affairs with respondent No. 2 and
they both are living together as husband and wife.
4. The appellant-wife has completely failed to discharge her matrimonial obligation towards her
husband and other in-laws members. The actions/misdeeds of the appellant have caused great
torture and harassment in the mind of the respondent-husband. This causes enormous pain and
grief in the mind of the respondent-husband and he found that in spite of giving best possible love
and affection, there was no change in her behaviour towards him, his parents, relations and friends.
The appellant has left Patna High Court MA No.178 of 2012 dt.25-09-2025 the society and company
of the respondent-husband and started living with respondent No. 2. The matrimonial relation
between the appellant and respondent has already irretrievably broken down and there is no hope of
restoration of their conjugal life. In the aforesaid circumstance, the present divorce petition was
filed by the respondent-husband seeking dissolution of marriage with the appellant-wife.
5. After filing of the Divorce Petition, summons were issued to the opposite party/appellant but
despite of that the opposite party/appellant did not chose to appear in the case. Subsequently,
notices were issued in daily newspaper "Dainik Jagran" but still the appellant-wife did not appear to
contest her case. Consequently, the case was fixed for ex-parte hearing against opposite
party/appellant vide order dated 21.06.2011 and after taking/recording the evidence of respondent
No.1/applicant, the learned Family Court passed the impugned judgment dated 08.07.2011. Being

Rahmat Rozy vs Sushil Kumar @ Sushil Kumar Bh on 25 September, 2025
aggrieved with the said judgment and decree, the appellant/opposite party has filed the present
appeal.
6. It is submitted on behalf of the appellant that Patna High Court MA No.178 of 2012
dt.25-09-2025 no notice was ever been served upon the appellant nor it appears from the impugned
order that any notice was ever been served upon the appellant. So far as the publication of notice in
the news-paper is concerned, the appellant did not get the knowledge of the same as she uses other
newspaper. The appellant had no knowledge about any divorce case and learned Principal Judge,
Family Court, Vaishali at Hajipur has allowed the divorce petition of the respondent-husband
without hearing the other aggrieved person (appellant-wife).
7. After going through the impugned order passed by the learned Principal Judge, Family Court, it
appears that the Matrimonial Suit was not decided after hearing both sides and in a flimsy manner,
after hearing the respondent- husband and the materials brought on record only by the respondent,
the order of dissolution of marriage was passed which is not sustainable in the eye of law. So, a fresh
adjudication of the Matrimonial Suit is required after taking the evidence of both the parties and
giving an opportunity to both of them to argue on the basis of materials available on record.
8. Accordingly, the judgment dated 08.07.2011 and Patna High Court MA No.178 of 2012
dt.25-09-2025 decree dated 21.07.2011 passed by the learned Principal Judge, Family Court,
Vaishali at Hajipur in O.S. Case No. 162 of 2010 is set aside.
9. The matter is remanded back to the Principal Judge, Family Court, Vaishali at Hajipur to decide
the case on merits after giving opportunity to both the parties to adduce their evidence within a
period of three months from the date of receipt/production of a copy of this judgment. Parties shall
co-operate in the proceeding.
10. The respondent No. 1 shall pay a sum of Rs. 25,000/-(Twenty Five Thousands) to the
appellant-Rahmat Rozy to face remanded case. The amount shall be paid to her within a period of
two months from today.
11. M.A. No. 178 of 2012 stands allowed.
12. Pending I.A, if any, stands disposed of.
