M/S. Carborundum Universal Limited vs The Assistant Commissioner Of Income ... on 13 December, 2021
(cid:12) TCA No. 1049 & 1050 of 2008
COMMON JUDGMENT
(Judgment of the Court was delivered by R. MAHADEVAN, J.) These tax case appeals have been
filed by the appellant / assessee, calling in question the correctness of the common order dated
28.12.2007 passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, 'A' Bench, Chennai, in I.T.A.Nos.
1102/Mds/2006 and 1103/Mds/2006 relating to the assessment years 2000-01 and 2002-03
respectively.
2.According to the appellant / assessee, they are engaged in the business of manufacturing and sale
of abrasives, industrial ceramics and electro minerals. For the assessment years in question, they
filed return of income, which were processed under Section 143(1)(a) of the Income-tax Act, 1961
(hereinafter referred to as “the Act”). The Assessing Officer issued notice under Section 148 for the
purpose of scrutiny assessment and the assessment was completed under Section 143(3) read with
Section 147 of the Act. While so, the Assessing Officer restricted the relief under Section 80HHC and
Section 80 I and disallowed depreciation claimed on the merged entity and on Technical know-how
fee paid and added the notional profit arising on valuation of closing inventory on account of
mandatory adoption of Accounting Standard (AS 2) issued by ICAI. Further, the Assessing Officer
included the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis TCA No. 1049 & 1050 of 2008 sale of scrap in the
total turnover and excluded 90% of gross interest income while computing deduction under
80HHC.
3.Challenging the orders of assessment, the assessee filed appeals before the Commissioner of
Income-tax (Appeals)-III, Chennai, who partly allowed the appeals, by common order dated
28.02.2006. Aggrieved over the same, both the assessee and the Revenue went on further appeals
before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal. By order dated 28.12.2007, the Tribunal partly allowed
the appeals filed by the assessee as well as the Revenue. Therefore, the present tax case appeals by
the assessee alone.
4.By order dated 30.07.2008, TCA No.1049 of 2008 was admitted on the following substantial
questions of law :-
“1. Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was right
in holding that scrap should be included in the total turnover while computing
deduction under Section 80HHC?
2. Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was right in
confirming the disallowance of depreciation claimed under Section 32 on the
technical know how fee paid and holding that only relief under Section 35AB is to be
allowed on such payment?

M/S. Carborundum Universal Limited vs The Assistant Commissioner Of Income ... on 13 December, 2021
3. Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was right in confirming
the disallowance of depreciation claimed under section 32 on the assets acquired through
amalgamation?
4. Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was right in confirming
the additional of notional profit arising on account of the inventory valuation due to mandatory
application of AS-2?”
5.By another order dated 30.07.2008, TCA No.1050 of 2008 was admitted by this court on the
substantial question of law Nos.1 to 3 as were raised in TCA No.1049 of 2008, as stated above.
6.Heard both sides and perused the materials placed before this court. 7.1 As regards the first
question of law, whether the sale of scrap should be included in the total turnover for the purpose of
deduction under Section 80HHC of the Act, the same is covered by the decision of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Commissioner of Income Tax vs. Punjab Stainless Steel Industries
[(2015) 229 Taxman 0423 (SC)], wherein it was held that “the proceeds generated from the sale of
scrap would not be included in the ‘total turnover’, for computation of deduction under Section
80HHC”. The relevant paragraphs of the said decision are usefully extracted below:
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis TCA No. 1049 & 1050 of 2008 “22. So far as the
scrap is concerned, the sale proceeds from the scrap may either be shown separately
in the Profit and Loss Account or may be deducted from the amount spent by the
manufacturing unit on the raw material, which is steel in the case of the
respondent-assessee, as the respondent-assessee is using stainless steel as raw
material, from which utensils are manufactured. The raw material, which is not
capable of being used for manufacturing utensils will have to be either sold as scrap
or might have to be re-cycled in the form of sheets of stainless steel, if the
manufacturing unit is also having its re- rolling plant. If it is not having such a plant,
the manufacturer would dispose of the scrap of steel to someone who would re- cycle
the said scrap into steel so that the said steel can be re-used.
23. When such scrap is sold, in our opinion, the sale proceeds of the scrap cannot be
included in the term ‘turnover’ for the reason that the respondent-unit is engaged
primarily in the manufacturing and selling of steel utensils and not scrap of steel.
Therefore, the proceeds of such scrap would not be included in ‘sales’ in the Profit and Loss Account
of the respondent-assessee. ....
28. The intention behind enactment of Section 80HHC of the Act was to encourage export so as to
earn more foreign exchange. For the said purpose the Government wanted to encourage
businessmen, traders and manufacturers to increase the export so as to bring more foreign exchange
in our country. If the purpose is to bring more foreign exchange and to encourage export, we are of
the view that the legislature would surely like to give more benefit to persons who are making an
effort to help our nation in the process of bringing more foreign exchange. If a trader or a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/111373663/ 3
M/S. Carborundum Universal Limited vs The Assistant Commissioner Of Income ... on 13 December, 2021
manufacturer is trying his best to increase his exports, even at the cost of his business in a local
market, we are sure that the Government would like to encourage such a person. In our opinion,
once the Government decides to give some benefit to someone who is helping the nation in bringing
foreign exchange, the Revenue should also make all possible efforts to encourage such traders or
manufacturers by giving such business units more benefits as contemplated under the provisions of
law.
29. For the aforesaid reasons, we are of the view that the view expressed by the High Court is in
conformity with the normal https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis TCA No. 1049 & 1050 of 2008
accounting practice followed by the traders, including the respondent-assessee and it was justified
in coming to a conclusion that the proceeds generated from the sale of scrap would not be included
in the ‘total turnover’.
7.2 Following the aforesaid decision, we are inclined to interfere with the finding of the Tribunal and
this issue is answered against the Revenue and in favour of the assessee.
8.With regard to second question of law relating to the expenditure incurred by the assessee for the
purpose of getting technical know-how on manufacture and process of goods, they are entitled to
depreciation or deduction under Section 35AB, the same is covered by the decision of this court in
Carborundum Universal Ltd vs. The Joint Commissioner of Income Tax [(2012) TIOL 790 HC Mad
IT], wherein it was held that “the assessee is entitled to deduction under section 35AB and not
entitled to depreciation under section 32”. In view of the same, we answer this issue against the
appellant/assessee and in favour of the revenue/respondent.
9.1 Regarding the third question of law, in the decision reported in the case of Commissioner of
Income Tax vs. Silical Metallurgic Ltd [324 CTR 29(Madras)], this Court concluded that “the
amalgamation of one company https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis TCA No. 1049 & 1050 of 2008 with
the other company cannot be regarded as a splitting up or reconstruction or by a transfer of a new
business of the plant and machinery of the old business. Thus, the amalgamation cannot be
regarded as a splitting up of the company for the purpose of negativing the claim of deduction under
Section 80HH and 80-I, which has been statutorily conferred on the company, if such companies
fulfil the conditions stipulated therein. Similar view was expressed by this court in another decision
reported in the case of EID Parry (India) Limited v. Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax [256 CTR
104 (Madras)], in which, it was held that “the accumulated loss and unabsorbed depreciation of the
amalgamating company is deemed to be the loss or the allowance of depreciation to the
amalgamated company for the previous year in which the amalgamation is effected”. The relevant
paragraph of the said decision is reproduced below:
“23.As far as the present case is concerned, it is no doubt true that Explanation 2 is
not similarly worded as Explanation 2A, which was considered by the Bombay High
Court. The provisions contained in Explanation 2, applicable to the present case, in
fact, brings out the intention better and is crisp in its language, as is evident from a
reading of explanation 2. As per explanation 2, the actual cost of the block of assets at
the hands of the amalgamated company is “the written down value of the block
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/111373663/ 4
M/S. Carborundum Universal Limited vs The Assistant Commissioner Of Income ... on 13 December, 2021
assets” as in the case of transferor company or the amalgamating company for the
immediately preceding previous year as reduced by the amount of depreciation
actually allowed in relation to the said immediately https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
preceding previous year. The use of the phrase “for the TCA No. 1049 & 1050 of 2008
immediately preceding previous year” with reference to the written down value at the
hands of transferor company in understanding what should be the cost of the block of
assets at the hands of amalgamated company.” 9.2 In view of the above decision, we
are inclined to answer this issue in favour of the assessee and against the Revenue
and is accordingly, answered.
10. As regards the fourth substantial question of law in TCA No.1049 of 2008, in the
decision in the case of Commissioner of Income Tax vs. George Oakes reported in [75
CCH 357 (Mad)], this Court was of the view that “the assessee having valued its
inventory as per AS-2 prescribed by the ICAI, such a change was bonafide and was
mandatory by the ICAI and the discrepancy in profitability arising in the year of
change, cannot be forced to be taxed”.
Similar view was upheld by the Hon'ble supreme court in the decision reported in the case of VKJ
Builders and Contractors (P) Ltd v. Commissioner of Income Tax in [318 ITR 204 (SC)], wherein it
was held that “the closing stock of earlier year has to be treated as opening stock of current year and
therefore where the opening stock of current year shows a lower value than the value of closing stock
of earlier year as finally determined by the Assessing Officer, the same is amenable to rectification
under Section 154 of the Act”. In view of the said decisions, this issue is answered in favour of the
assessee.
11.In the result, both the tax case appeals filed by the assessee are partly
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis TCA No. 1049 & 1050 of 2008 allowed to the extent as indicated
above. No costs.
