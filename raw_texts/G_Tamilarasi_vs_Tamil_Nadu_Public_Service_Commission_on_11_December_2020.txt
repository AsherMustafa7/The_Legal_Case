For Petitioner : Mr.NGR.Prasad for
M/s.Row & Reddy
For Respondent : Mr.N.Balamurali Krishnan, SC
ORDER
This writ petition has been filed to declare that the action of the respondent not including the name
of the petitioner for the original certificate verification list issued by the respondent dated
12.02.2020 as arbitrary, illegal and in violation of natural justice and consequently, direct the
respondent to permit the petitioner to participate in both the counseling for the posts included in
the Combined Civil Services Examination -4, Group-IV examinations, issued by the respondent in
Notification No.19/2019 dated 14.06.2019.
2. According to the petitioner, the respondent Commission issued notification No.19/2019, inviting
applications for recruitment to the posts included in the Combined Civil Services Examination â€“ 4,
Group IV, http://www.judis.nic.in W.P.No.5726 of 2020 and seeking to fill up 6491 vacancies. The
petitioner, in response to the notification, applied for consideration of her candidature through
online on 24.06.2019. The petitioner belongs to BC category and she is also eligible to be considered
under PSTM Quota and also Destitute Widow (Special Category).
3. The petitioner thereafter participated in the written examination held on 01.09.2019 and the
result was published on 12.11.2019. The petitioner has secured 211.5 marks out of total 300 marks.
As per the statement of mark, she has secured overall rank as 60496 and communal rank as 26207
for all posts included in the notification.
4. According to the petitioner, she was ranked as 85 under Destitute Widow category. The
Commission published two separate list for provisionally admitted candidates for Certificate
Verification on 30.11.2019. Thereafter, the candidates were directed to upload the copies of the
certificates through E-Seva Centres in support of their claim for appointment on 03.12.2019. The
time was fixed between 05.12.2019 and http://www.judis.nic.in W.P.No.5726 of 2020 and
18.12.2019 for uploading certificates by the candidates.
5. According to the petitioner, she approached E-Seva Centre, Karur, on 07.12.2019 and uploaded all
the certificates and the fact of uploading of the certificates, has also been acknowledged by issuing
proper receipt by the E-Seva Centre. The respondent subsequently issued a list of 39 candidates on
31.01.2020, directing them to upload the certificates from 01.02.2020 to 07.02.2020. Further, the
respondent issued the list on 12.02.2020, of candidates admitted to original Certificate Verification
and counseling based on the rank list published on 12.11.2019, including 27 new candidates who
were not in the original list published on 12.11.2019. At this, the petitioner found that her Register
Number was missing in the list. Thereafter, on enquiry, the petitioner came to know that the E-Seva
Centre, has uploaded only the petitioner's 12 th Std PSTM Certificate and failed to upload the 10th
Std PSTM Certificate, as the 10th Std PSTM Certificate was a requirement for consideration of the
petitioner under PSTM Quota.

6. In the circumstances, the petitioner was not included in the http://www.judis.nic.in W.P.No.5726
of 2020 and final original Certificate Verification and Counseling on 12.02.2020. According to the
petitioner, the E-Seva Centre, through which, the certificates were uploaded, had given proper
acknowledgment stating that all the certificates including PSTM Certificate for both 10th Std and
12th Std have been uploaded and for unknown reason, it did not reach the Commission. Since the
candidature of the petitioner was not considered in the final stage of selection, being aggrieved, the
petitioner is before this Court.
7. Notice was ordered in the writ petition. Mr.N.Balamurali Krishnan, learned Standing Counsel
appeared on behalf of the respondent.
8. When the matter was taken up for hearing earlier, this Court has directed the Commission vide
interim order dated 04.03.2020, to permit the petitioner to attend the counseling on any one of the
dates scheduled without prejudice to the rights of the parties in the writ petition. Thereafter, it
appears that the petitioner was permitted to participate in the counseling and the certificates as
required by the Commission were also http://www.judis.nic.in W.P.No.5726 of 2020 and produced
to the satisfaction of the Commission. Ultimately, the petitioner being found eligible for
appointment in the category for which she laid her claim, the provisional appointment has also been
issued appointing the petitioner as Junior Assistant in Public Health and Preventive Medicine
Department, in pursuance of her selection pursuant to the subject Notification. However, the
appointment is stated to be subject to the disposal of the present writ petition.
9. On behalf of the respondent Commission, a counter affidavit has been filed. In the counter
affidavit, it is stated that when the candidates were informed of the selection procedure as stipulated
in the Notification itself, it is the responsibility of the candidate to ensure that all the certificates
were uploaded within the time stipulated by the Commission. As far as the Commission is
concerned, the PSTM claim of the petitioner could not be considered in the absence of 10th Std
certificate as a proof of petitioner having done her schooling in Tamil Medium of Instructions.
Therefore, she could not be considered against the PSTM Quota.
10. Mr.NGR.Prasad, learned counsel for the petitioner, would http://www.judis.nic.in W.P.No.5726
of 2020 and submit that the petitioner cannot be faulted for the error, even assuming that the
certificate in question has not been uploaded by the E-Seva Centre. The E-Seva Centre has in fact
issued acknowledgment for having uploaded all the certificates, vide its receipt dated 07.12.2019.
Therefore, the petitioner was under the bonafide impression that every requirement has been
complied with.
11. In any event, he would submit that, now, the petitioner has been found to be eventually eligible
for appointment and appointment order has also been issued, the writ petition may be disposed of
in favour of the petitioner, taking note of the positive development.
12. Although in the facts and circumstances of the case, the petitioner cannot be faulted with for not
uploading 10th Std PSTM certificate, at the same time, the Commission cannot also be blamed for
originally not considering the claim of the petitioner. As far as the Commission is concerned, the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/86197378/ 3
G.Tamilarasi vs Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission on 11 December, 2020
required certificate did not reach the Commission's office and therefore, there was no scope for the
Commission http://www.judis.nic.in W.P.No.5726 of 2020 and to consider the petitioner against
PSTM Quota.
13. In any case, this Court has intervened and passed interim orders and on the basis of which, the
petitioner was allowed to participate in the counseling provisionally and ultimately the petitioner
has been favoured with the provisional appointment order also. When the petitioner is found to be
fully eligible for appointment and being appointed also as Junior Assistant, this Court is of the view
that, in all fairness, the issue must rest at that.
1. This Court is not inclined to fathom out as to who is to be blamed in the contention between
petitioner and the respondent Commission for non availability of the certificate in question at the
crucial time. According to this Court, such blame game is of no consequence, in view of the
subsequent development wherein the petitioner has been issued a provisional appointment order.
15. In the above circumstances, the considered view of this http://www.judis.nic.in W.P.No.5726 of
2020 and Court is that the petitioner should be allowed to enjoy the fruition of the appointment
without any strings attached to her appointment. This is particularly so, that the petitioner being a
Destitute Widow, has earned her appointment in her own right.
16. Therefore, it is hereby declared that the appointment of the petitioner dated 28.11.2020, as
Junior Assistant, Public Health and Preventive Department, is not to be construed as provisional
appointment on account of pending of this writ petition. The Commission is directed to issue
necessary clarification in this regard expeditiously.
17. With the above observation, this writ petition stands disposed of. No costs. Consequently,
connected miscellaneous petition is closed.
