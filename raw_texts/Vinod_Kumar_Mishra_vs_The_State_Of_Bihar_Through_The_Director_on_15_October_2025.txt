Date : 15-10-2025
Heard learned counsel for the respective parties.
2. The instant writ petition has been filed for quashing

the Indian Penal Code.
3. From perusal of record, it appears vide order dated
Patna High Court CR. WJC No.1304 of 2025 dt.15-10-2025
2/5
24.06.2025
, on the prayer of learned counsel for the petitioner, the learned Coordinate Bench ordered that till
further orders, the petitioner would not be arrested in connection with Chhapra Town P.S. Case No.
507 of 2023. The informant of Chapra Town P.S. Case No. 507 of 2023 has been made party as
respondent no.8 and he has appeared in this case and filed counter affidavit as well as one I.A.No.01
of 2025 for vacating the interim order of stay dated 24.06.2025 whereby arrest of the petitioner has
been stayed till further orders.
4. It has been submitted on record by the respondent no. 8 that the petitioner has not approached
this Court with clean hands and earlier the petitioner moved this Court by filing Cr. Misc.
No.67248/2023 seeking bail. Vide order dated 13.12.2023, the provisional bail was granted to the
petitioner with direction to pay Rs.32.10 lacs to the informant within four months. But due to
default of the petitioner, even after repeated extensions, provisional bail granted to the petitioner,
vide order dated 13.12.2023, was cancelled and the petitioner was directed to surrender before the
learned court below immediately vide order dated 09.05.2025 passed in Cr. Misc. No.67248/2023.
But the petitioner concealed this fact and filed Cr.W.J.C.No.1304/2025 and got a favourable order
staying his Patna High Court CR. WJC No.1304 of 2025 dt.15-10-2025 arrest. The same is in
complete violation of the orders of this Court dated 09.05.2025 passed in Cr.Misc. No.67248 of
2023.
5. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner submits that there was no requirement
while filing the writ petition for mentioning the fact about dismissal of bail petition or orders passed
by the learned Coordinate Bench about grant of provisional bail. The learned counsel, however,
tenders apology for inconvenience caused to this Court.
6. Perused the record.
7. When the petitioner approached this Court seeking quashing of the FIR and prayed for stay of his
arrest, the petitioner was duty bound to apprise this Court regarding all the facts in connection with
the FIR for which quashing has been sought. A bare reading of two orders of this Court dated
09.05.2025 and 24.06.2025 passed in Cr. Misc. No.67248 of 2023 and Cr.W.J.C.No.1304 of 2025,
respectively, makes it abundantly clear that as soon as the petitioner did not get any favourable
order in Cr. Misc. No.67248 of 2023, he moved before this Court by filing the present writ petition
concealing this important fact about dismissal of his bail petition and other directions of the
Coordinate Bench in Cr. Misc. No. 67248 of 2023. The act of the petitioner in not mentioning the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/4988997/ 2
Vinod Kumar Mishra vs The State Of Bihar Through The Director ... on 15 October, 2025
facts about Patna High Court CR. WJC No.1304 of 2025 dt.15-10-2025 Cr. Misc. No.67248 of 2023
amounts to active concealment and playing hide and seek with this Court. The petitioner is guilty of
not approaching the Court with clean hands and playing fraud upon it.
8. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of S.P. Chengalvaraya Naidu v. Jagannath & Ors., AIR
1994 SC 853, has quoted the observation of the Chief Justice Edward Coke of England made about
three centuries ago that "fraud avoids all judicial acts, ecclesiastical or temporal" and held that the
courts of law are meant for imparting justice between the parties. One who comes to the court, must
come with clean hands and finally their Lordships held that a person, who's case is based on
falsehood, has no right to approach the court. He can be summarily thrown out at any stage of the
litigation.
9. Therefore, I am of the considered opinion that the concealment/suppression of vital facts makes
the petition of the petitioner liable to be dismissed but with substantive cost and reliance could be
placed on the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of General Manager, Haryana
Roadways vs. Jai Bhagwan and Anr., (2008) 4 SCC 127 wherein for suppression of facts, exemplary
cost of Rs.1,00,000/- was imposed.
Patna High Court CR. WJC No.1304 of 2025 dt.15-10-2025
10. In the light of aforesaid discussion, the present petition is dismissed with cost. The cost is
quantified at Rs.50,000/-, which shall be paid by the petitioner in the coffer of Patna High Court
Legal Services Committee within a period of four weeks from today. If not paid, the Registry is
directed to recover the same by taking appropriate action against the petitioner.
11. Consequently, pending interlocutory application, if any, also stands disposed of.
