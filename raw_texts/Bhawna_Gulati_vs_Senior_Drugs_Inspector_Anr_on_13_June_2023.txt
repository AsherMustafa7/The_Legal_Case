2. As an identical question of law as to whether a complaint in terms of the Drugs and Cosmetic Act,
1940 („the Act(cid:129)) is maintainable against a company without there being any evidence with regard to
its composition, these nine petitions are taken up for disposal by this common order.
3. The petitioners have sought quashment of proceedings against them in the complaints filed by the
Drugs and Food Organization though respondent no. 1 Senior Drug Inspector in terms of Section
18a(1) read with Section 27(d) of the Act which have been entertained by the learned Chief Judicial
Magistrate, Jammu (Trial Court), asserting therein that proceedings against the petitioners have
been initiated against statutory provisions of the Act.
4. As per record, respondent-Drug Inspector filed the complaints inter alia against the petitioners as
Managing Director/Proprietor of a company M/S Samrat Surgical Private Limited, the
manufacturers of Absorbent Cotton Wool IP, Zig Zag Absorbent Cotton Wool IP, Rolled Bandages as
during checking samples were lifted from the unit of the company in accordance with the provisions
of the Act and sent to the Government Analyst who vide their reports described the samples as
"Sample fails in packaging, surface active substance and other soluble substances" on different
dates, as such the complaints were filed by the respondent herein for the commission of the offences
punishable under Section 18a(1) read with Section 27 of the Act, as the petitioner(cid:129)s company had
been found having committed the offence of manufacturing, sale, stock, exhibiting, offering for sale
and distribution of the said material in question which was declared „not of standard quality.(cid:129) The
Trial Court on receipt of the complaints, entertained the same and took cognizance of the offences
and issued process against the petitioners herein as accused.
5. Aggrieved of the complaint and the cognizance taken thereon and the issuance of process, the
accused as petitioners in these petitions filed these petitions invoking inherent jurisdiction of this
Court seeking quashment of the proceedings.

6. Learned counsel for the petitioner argued that the complaints had been filed by the
complainant-respondent and entertained by the Trial Court by taking cognizance thereon against
the provisions of Section 32-A of the Act, which vests powers with the Court to implead
manufacturer as an accused. Though the petitioners have raised a number of grounds challenging
the impugned complaints and the proceedings emanating therefrom, but the main ground that has
been raised during the course of arguments is that the petitioners have been impleaded as an
accused in the complaints without there being any evidence against it/him/her and that the learned
Magistrate while issuing process against the accused has not followed the procedure prescribed
under law. It has also been contended that there are no allegations against the petitioners in the
impugned complaints inasmuch as it is nowhere stated in the complaints that the petitioners were
the persons responsible for conducting the day to day business of the company. It is further
contended that the company of which the petitioners are the Director(s) has not been impleaded as
an accused, as such, the complaints cannot proceed against the petitioners.
7. In order to test the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioners, Section 32-A of Act,
which vests powers with the Court to implead manufacturer etc., as an accused is required to be
taken into account. From a perusal of Section 32-A of the Act, it is clear that for impleading a
manufacturer or some other person as an accused, the Court has to be satisfied on the basis of the
evidence adduced before it that such person is also concerned in that offence. The provisions clearly
indicate that the impleadment of an additional accused can be resorted to only by the Trial Court on
satisfaction about the involvement of such additional accused based on the evidence that has been
adduced during the trial.
8. After some initial resistance, Mr. Amit Gupta, learned AAG has fairly conceded the proposition on
the subject that it is only after the trial has commenced and the evidence has been led that power to
implead manufacturer or any other person that appears to be involved in the offences can be
exercised and prior to that no such power can be exercised.
9. In all the cases, the learned Magistrate, at the very outset, after lodging complaints by the
respondents had issued the process against the petitioners as accused in all the complaints. In fact
all the complaints were still at the stage of summoning at the relevant time, therefore, the impugned
orders whereby the process issued against the petitioners by the learned Magistrate as accused is
contrary to the procedure prescribed under law. On perusal of the copies of the complaints placed
on record, it is clear that the respondents as complainant at their own had arrayed the petitioner as
accused without seeking any orders from the learned Magistrate for their impleadment as additional
accused.
10. It has also been noticed that the petitioners have been shown as Director(s) of the company and
arrayed, whereas legally as per Section 34 of the Act, it is only the person incharge of and
responsible for the conduct of business of the company who can be deemed to be guilty of the
offences along with the company but in the instant cases the averments in this regard are completely
missing. Learned Magistrate in absence of any evidence brought on record by the complainant with
regard to the fact as to who was incharge and responsible for the conduct of the business of the
company, had issued process against the petitioners.

11. Another important question in such cases is as to whether a Director or a Proprietor of a
company can be proceeded against without impleading the company as accused, this question,
however, is no longer res integra, the Apex Court in case titled „Aneeta Hada vs. M/S Godfather
Travels and Tours Pvt. Ltd.(cid:129), reported as (2012) 5 SCC 661 has clearly laid down that there can be
no vicarious liability in criminal law, expect in a case, where a statute specifically provides so. While
interpreting the provisions contained in Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, which are in
pari materia with the provisions contained in Section 34 of the D&C Act, the Supreme Court held
that in the absence of arraigning of a company as an accused, the complaint for offences under
Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act cannot proceed against the Directors and office
bearers of the company. This Court following the aforesaid judgment of the Apex Court also in a case
of „Ashish Damija & Anr. Vs. UT of J&K(cid:129) [CRM(M) No.14/2021 and CRM(M) No.303/2019]
decided on 04.08.2022, has held that prosecution against the Director of a company or a partner of
a firm cannot proceed without impleading the company/firm as accused.
12. Since the learned counsel for the respondents has fairly conceded that the process should not
have been issued by the learned Magistrate against the petitioners without recording satisfaction as
to whether they were incharge of and responsible for the conduct of the business of the company,
after recording some evidence and the legal position as discussed hereinabove, this Court is of the
opinion that the impugned orders regarding summoning of the petitioners passed by the learned
Trial Magistrate in all the complaints are not sustainable.
13. Having regard to the foregoing reasons and observations made hereinabove, the impugned
orders in all the petitions qua petitioners are, thus, quashed invoking the inherent jurisdiction of
this Court and the learned Trial Magistrate is directed to proceed in the cases in accordance with
law, particularly in view of Section 32-A and 34 of the Act. The petitioners are directed to cause
appearance before the Trial Court for further orders on 05.07.2023. This order shall be placed
across all the files and copies thereof shall also be forwarded to the Trial Court along the Trial Court
record, if any, for the information and compliance.
14. These petitions along with pending application(s) are disposed of.
