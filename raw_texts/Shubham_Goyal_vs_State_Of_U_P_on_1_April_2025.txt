applicant was granted benefit of Section 41A Cr.P.C. Investigation has been completed. Charge-sheet
has been filed. The applicant had cooperated in the investigation. No custodial interrogation is
required. The applicant has been summoned by the concerned court. Counsel for applicant further
contends that the maximum sentence provided for the alleged offences is upto seven years. He
submits that in view of the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Satender Kumar Antil
Vs. Central Bureau of Investigation and another, (2021) 10 SCC 773, the applicant is entitled to be
enlarged on anticipatory bail. The applicant has no criminal antecedents. The applicant has
apprehension of his arrest in the above mentioned case. In case, the applicant is released on
anticipatory bail, he will not misuse the said liberty.
5. Learned A.G.A. for the State could not dispute the fact that the offences against the applicant are
punishable upto seven years. He does not dispute the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in
the case of Satender Kumar Antil (supra). He has not placed any criminal antecedents of the
applicant.
6. The Supreme Court in the case of Satender Kumar Antil (supra) has laid down the guidelines with
regard to enlargement of an accused on bail. The guidelines provided category/type of offences. One
of the category being Category-A are offences punishable with imprisonment of seven years or less.
The Supreme Court in paragraph-3 of the aforesaid judgment has laid down the guidelines that after
the filing of the charge sheet/cognizance ordinary the summons are required to be issued permitting
the appearance of the accused through Lawyer and the bail applications of the accused persons on
appearance are to be decided without the accused being taken into custody or by granting interim
bail. A perusal of the aforesaid guidelines would demonstrate that the liberty of an individual has
been recognized by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the aforesaid judgment in term of Article 21 of the
Constitution of India.
7. It is further to be noted that as per Section 41 of the Code of Criminal Procedure also during
investigation the liberty of an individual is protected in respect of an offence where the maximum
punishment provided is upto seven years.
8. It is not the case of the opposite party that applicant was arrested for the alleged offences during
investigation and it is also not the case of the opposite party that the applicant had not co-operated
in the investigation. Once no apprehension has been raised with regard to the conduct of the
applicant and the applicant has been charge-sheeted and summoned in respect of offence in which
punishment provided is upto seven years, then in view of the judgment of the Supreme Court in
Satender Kumar Antil (supra), the liberty of the individual is required to be protected.
9. It is not shown by learned AGA that the nature and gravity of allegations are such that the same
would disentitle the applicant for relief of anticipatory bail. No material, facts, circumstances or
concern been shown by learned AGA for the State that the accused may tamper with the evidence or
witnesses or accused is of such character that his mere presence at large would intimidate the
witnesses or that accused will use his liberty to subvert justice or tamper with the evidence.

10. It is settled principle of law that the object of bail is to secure the attendance of the accused. No
material particulars or circumstances suggestive of the applicant fleeing from justice or thwarting
the course of justice or creating other troubles in the shape of repeating offences or intimidating
witnesses and the like have been shown by learned AGA for the State.
11. Having regard to the submissions made by counsel for the applicant, considering the nature of
accusations, antecedents of the applicant and the fact that during the course of investigation, the

are punishable up to seven years and adhering to the guidelines provided in the judgment of the
Supreme Court in Satender Kumar Antil (supra). Charge-sheet has been filed. The applicant had
cooperated in the investigation and no custodial interrogation is required.without commenting on
