The High Court of Madhya Pradesh
Mcrc.37038.2021
(Chandra Prakash Dubey Vs. State of M.P.)
Gwalior dated 06.08.2021
None for the petitioner.
Shri Pramod Pachouri, learned Public Prosecutor for
respondent/State.
Heard through video conferencing.
Case-diary is read over by the State Counsel. This is first application u/S.438 Cr.P.C. for grant of
anticipatory bail by the petitioner.
Petitioner apprehends arrest in connection with offence punishable u/Ss.304-B, 114 & 34 of IPC and
Sec.3/4 Dowry Prohibition Act registered as Crime No.143/2021 by Police Station City Kotwali
Bhind, District Bhind (M.P.).
Learned counsel for the State opposed the application and prayed for its rejection by contending
that on the basis of the allegations and the material available on record, no case for grant of
anticipatory bail is made out.
Present is the first application preferred by petitioner u/S.438 Cr.P.C. where petitioner apprehends
arrest in respect of offence of dowry death. Allegation against petitioner is of acting as a Mediator
who had made arrangement for the marriage in question. The deceased died due to hanging within
seven years of marriage.
Petitioner is not related to the husband. Considering the fact that petitioner has no relationship with
the husband of deceased, does not reside in the matrimonial home 2 Mcrc.37038.2021 and is aged
about 54 years and that the material placed on record does not disclose the possibility of petitioner
fleeing from justice, this Court is inclined to extend the benefit of bail to the petitioner.
Accordingly, without expressing any opinion on merits of the case, I deem fit appropriate to allow
this application u/S. 438 of Cr.P.C. in the following terms.
