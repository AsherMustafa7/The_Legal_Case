I.A. No.8318/2021, I.A. No.8315/2021, I.A. No.8362/2021, I.A. No.8364/2021, I.A. No.8374/2021
and I.A. No.8363/2021 have been filed in respective W.P.No.5901/2019, W.P.No.25181/2019,
W.P.No.3757/2020, W.P.No.8923/2020, W.P.No.8930/2020 and W.P.No.9328/2020 for vacation
of the interim order passed therein on various dates on behalf of the State.
We have heard Mr.Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor General of India and Mr. Purushaindra Kaurav,
learned Advocate General appearing on behalf of the State of Madhya Pradesh, at some length, who
sought to argue that the interim orders passed by this Court on 19.3.2019 and extended on
28.1.2020, 31.1.2020 and lastly on 20.7.2020 deserve to be vacated in view of the settled proposition
of law that there is always a presumption in regard to constitutional validity of an enactment and
unless the enactment is declared ultra vires the Constitution, its effect and operation cannot be
stayed. Reliance in support of this argument is placed on the judgments of the Supreme Court in
Bhavesh D. Parish and others vs. Union of India and another, (2000) 5 SCC 471; Desiya Murpokku
Dravida Kazhagam (2) and another vs. Election Commission of India, (2011) 4 SCC 224; and Health
for Millions vs. Union of India and others, (2014) 14 SCC 496. Learned Solicitor General of India
further argued that this Court has not recorded any reason in support of the interim orders passed
from time to time and in fact, the interim order dated 31.1.2020 appears to have been passed on the
basis of suggestion given by the then Advocate General and therefore, the Court may modify the stay
orders in the terms that the appointments to the extent of increased quota of reservation in favour of
OBC may remain subject to final outcome of the petitions.
Learned counsel appearing for the petitioners in these petitions opposed the prayer and submitted
that even if the reasons are not elaborately mentioned in the orders but the first order that has been
passed on 19.3.2019 and thereafter, when arguments were made on subsequent dates i.e. 28.1.2020
and 31.1.2020, the matters were heard by the Court at quite some length and the relevant case law
was also cited. Since the orders have been passed after hearing both the parties, sub-article (3) of
Article 226 of the Constitution cannot be at this stage invoked. It is, therefore, prayed that matters

may be heard and decided finally.
Having regard to the submissions made at the Bar and considering that the aforesaid interim orders
have remained in operation for past two and half years, rather than vacating the stay orders, we
deem it appropriate to decide all the writ petitions finally. We therefore, require the learned counsel
for the parties to come prepared on next date for arguments. In the meantime, they may file their
written submissions.
In view of above, the applications filed on behalf of the State for vacation of interim relief are
accordingly disposed of.
Matter to come up for hearing on 20.9.2021.
