CORAM:
THE CHIEF JUSTICE
JUSTICE M.S. RAMAN
JUDGMENT
02.01.2023
1. A common question of law arises in all these writ petitions and they are accordingly disposed of by
this common judgment.
2. For the Petitioners in the present writ petitions, it is not the first time that they are litigating
before this Court. In some cases, there have been at least two earlier rounds of litigation. The
present batch of writ petitions has several common features. In all of them, the Petitioners are
questioning the powers of the Assistant Settlement Officer (ASO), an authority functioning under
the Orissa Survey and Settlement Act, 1958 (OSS Act), to purportedly exercise suo motu powers at
the stage of a preliminary publication of a draft record of rights (ROR) under Section 12 of OSS Act
and to pass orders directing that the lands in question be recorded in the name of the Government
in the ROR.
3. Another common feature of all these cases is that the lands in question are in Khurda District
either in the city of Bhubaneswar or in its outskirts. The litigation has its genesis in an order passed
by the Division Bench of this Court on 29th January 1996 in OJC No.9449 of 1993 noting the
allegations made about irregularities committed in the grant of leases of land in Bhubaneswar Tahsil
area; and directing the State Government to scrutinize all irregular lease cases and thereafter take
appropriate action. Those leases under the Orissa Government Land Settlement Act, 1962 (OGLS
Act) were granted in favour of either the Petitioners themselves or their vendors and their
predecessors-in-interest.
4. On the basis of the above general direction issued by this Court in OJC No.9449 of 1993, orders
came be passed in purported exercise of suo motu powers by ASOs at the stage of examining the
applications for mutation of the names of the purchasers in the RORs. Many of these purchasers had
purchased the land in question through registered sale deeds (RSDs) and were asking for
consequential entry of their names in the ROR on the basis of such RSDs.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146182691/ 7
Narottam Rath vs State Of Odisha And Another .... ... on 2 January, 2023
5. Pursuant to the directions issued by this Court in OJC No. 9449 of 1993, action was sought to be
taken under the OGLS Act to cancel the leases. At that stage, writ petitions were filed in this Court in
which orders were passed remanding the matters to the Additional District Magistrate (ADM) to
examine, after hearing the Petitioners, whether in fact leases hadbeen granted validly in their
favour. The Court is informed that in some of these cases, on such remand, the ADM again passed
orders affirming the grant of lease in favour of the Petitioners or their vendors or the
predecessors-in- interest. The grievance is that even in such cases where the ADM had confirmed
the grant of leases in favour of the predecessors-in-
interest of the Petitioners, the ASOs at the stage of examining the request for mutation in the ROR,
again exercised purported suo motu power to decline such registration of ROR and issued positive
directions that they should in fact be recorded in the name of the Government. This has triggered
the present round of litigation.
6. This Court has been shown numerous orders passed by both the learned Single Judge of this
Court as well as various Division Benches where in similar circumstances, it has been repeatedly
held that the ASOs exercising powers under the OSS Act are bound by the orders passed by the ADM
under the OGLS Act and cannot possibly override such orders.
7. Among the earliest of such orders is an order dated 20th August, 2013 passed by a Division Bench
of this Court in W.P.(C) No.18936 of 2013 (Mrs. Sneha Mohanty v. State of Odisha) holding that the
ASO "has no jurisdiction to review the order passed by the revisional authority in a proceeding
under the OGLS Act regarding lease of Government land".
8. Then there are a series of orders passed by the Division Benches of this Court in 2014 including
an order dated 4th July 2014 in W.P. (C) No.8402 of 2014 (Nilendri Mohanty v. State); an order
dated 4th July 2014 in W.P.(C) No.8237 of 2014 (Kamal Basini Mohanty v. State of Orissa); an order
dated 8th July 2014 in W.P.(C) No.11165 of 2014 (M/s. Kapaleswar Firms Pvt. Ltd. v. State of
Odisha); and an order dated 27th October 2014 in a batch of writ petitions, the lead case of which
was W.P.(C) No.4596 of 2014 (Tridev Kodamasingh v. State of Odisha), where it was held as under:
"The leases having been granted either under the OGLS Act or under any other
appropriate law, unless and until it is set aside or declared invalid by the competent
authority under the appropriate statute the lease cannot be said to be invalid. Unless
and until the lease is either set aside or leasehold lands are resumed by the order of
the competent authority, the Assistant Settlement Officer/Settlement authorities are
bound by the lease orders and have no jurisdiction to question the validity of the
lease concerned. For the omission of the State Government to scrutinize and to find
out any irregularities in respect of any lease, no fault can be imputed either to the
lessees or to the petitioner, who have purchased by registered sale deeds portions of
such leasehold lands. Since the Assistant Settlement Officer was in seisin of the
matter, it was incumbent on him to make field enquiry to find out the actual
possession of the petitioners and he having not done so it is not open to him to doubt
about the possession of the petitioners over the lands which they claimed and on that

ground direct recording of the land in favour of the State."
9. In many of the above cases, the matters were remanded to the ASO to again examine the matters
and pass appropriate orders.
10. Then there are a series of orders that were passed by the Division Benches of this Court in 2018.
In W.P.(C) No.12776 of 2014 (Padmanav Prusty v. State of Odisha), an order was passed by the
Division Bench of this Court on 6th April 2018 where it was noticed that the ASO was "swayed away
by the observation of this Court passed in OJC No.9449 of 1993, which is a general instruction to the
State Government to find out the fraud, if at all committed in granting lease of the case. But never
that order shows any cancellation of lease without following the due procedure of law". It was then
observed as under:
"10. ... It must be made clear that it was none of the business of the Assistant
Settlement Officer to go into the question of correctness of lease and direct to change
the draft record because the authority under the OGLS Act, lease principle or
Government Grants Act under which there are hierarchy of authorities to take
cognizance of any irregularity and illegality and then pass the order of cancellation
under the concerned statute. The Assistant Settlement Officer is not authorized to
encroach upon the authority as prescribed under other revenue laws to behave like
appellate authority to cancel the lease. On the other hand, the impugned order passed
by the Assistant Settlement Officer is without jurisdiction and wholly erroneous.
Similarly, the Additional Sub-Collector, without mentioning the provision of law
under which he heard the appeal, has dismissed the appeal and as such, the same is
also without jurisdiction and illegal.
11. The propriety demands that the authority vested with the power under the statute
must exercise the power as assigned under the Act and he cannot encroach the power
of other authority purportedly assigned to that authority under the said Act. On the
other hand, in the case of Babu Verghese and others v. Bar Council of Kerala and
others; (1999) 3 SCC 422, Hon'ble Supreme Court, have observed at paragraphs 31
and 32 in the following manner:
"31.It is the basic principle of law long settled that if the manner of doing a particular
act is prescribed under any Statute, the act must be done in that manner or not at all.
The origin of this rule is traceable to the decision in Taylor v. Taylor (1875) 1 Ch.D
426 which was followed by Lord Roche in Nazir Ahmad vs. King Emperor; AIR 1936
PC 253 who stated as under :
"Where a power is given to do a certain thing in a certain way, the thing must be done
in that way or not at all."
32. This rule has since been approved by this Court in Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh & Anr. v.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146182691/ 9
Narottam Rath vs State Of Odisha And Another .... ... on 2 January, 2023
State of Vindhya Pradesh; AIR 1954 SC 322 and again in Deep Chand v. State of Rajasthan; AIR
1961 SC 1527. These cases were considered by a Three-Judge Bench of this Court in State of Uttar
Pradesh v. Singhara Singh & Ors. AIR 1964 SC 358 and the rule laid down in Nazir Ahmad's case
(supra) was again upheld. This rule has since been applied to the exercise of jurisdiction by courts
and has also been recognised as a salutary principle of administrative law.
12. The Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Captain Sube Singh and
others v. Lt. Governor of Delhi and others; AIR 2004 SC 3821 at paragraph-29 of the said judgment
have observed that when a statute vests certain power in an authority to be exercised in a particular
manner then the said authority has to exercise it only in the manner provided in the statute itself.
Paragraph-29 of the said judgment is placed in the following manner for better appreciation:
29. In Anjum M.H. Ghaswala a Constitution Bench of this Court reaffirmed the
general rule that when a statute vests certain power in an authority to be exercised in
a particular manner then the said authority has to exercise it only in the manner
provided in the statute itself. (See also in this connection Dhanajaya Reddy v. State of
Karnataka; (2001) 4 SCC 9. The statute in question requires the authority to act in
accordance with the rules for variation of the conditions attached to the permit. In
our view, it is not permissible to the State Government to purport to alter these
conditions by issuing a notification under Section 67(1)(d) read with sub-
clause (i) thereof.
13. With due regard to the aforesaid decisions, it is made clear that if a statute vests certain power in
an authority to be exercised in a particular manner, then said authority has to exercise only in that
manner provided under the statute. A similar matter, i.e., W.P.(C) No.2207 of 2015 (Rukmani
Panigrahi v. State of Orissa) has also been disposed by this Court on 13.07.2015 with the finding that
the Assistant Settlement Officer cannot dispose of such matter while being only authorized to
prepare the final record of right in accordance with the draft record of right (PARCHA). Relying
upon the decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and the judgment of this Court, the impugned
order passed by the Assistant Settlement Officer, Bhubaneswar Settlement Camp, Rental Colony,
Bhubaneswar in Objection Case No.16372/4306 of 2013 and the order dated 16.9.2013 passed by
the Additional Sub-Collector, Bhubaneswar in Appeal Case No.1806 of 2013 are liable to be set aside
and the Court do so."
11. Having held as above, this Court remitted the matter to the ASO "to finally record the disputed
land in favour of the Petitioner in accordance with draft record of right (PARCHA) under the OSS
Act within a period of three months".
12. Then we have an order dated 10th May, 2018 in W.P.(C) No. 18357 of 2014 where again it was
held likewise and a direction was issued remitting the matter to ASO to finally record the disputed
land in favour of the Petitioner. The learned Single Judge of this Court in a detailed judgment dated
18th June 2021 in W.P.(C) No.8774 of 2019 and batch (Vijay Krishna Poultry Pvt. Ltd. v. State of
Odisha) dealt with a similar issue and held that the settlement authorities had acted without
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146182691/ 10
Narottam Rath vs State Of Odisha And Another .... ... on 2 January, 2023
jurisdiction in passing the orders under the OSS Act overriding the orders passed by the ADM under
the OGLS Act. In para-30 of the said order, it was observed as under:
"30. Nevertheless, the writ Court under Article 226 of the Constitution can interfere
with an order passed by the statutory authority when it acts in a manner not
recognized under law. In all these writ petitions, the properties in question were
settled under the provisions of the O.G.L.S. Act. The settlement authority also
accepted the same and proceeded in the settlement operation up to the stage of
Section 11 of the Act, 1958. But, surprisingly the authority under the Act has acted in
a different manner and passed the impugned orders without recognizing the
settlement of the land under the provisions of the O.G.L.S. Act. Law is well settled
that the authorities under the Act cannot sit over the settlement made under the
O.G.L.S. Act. There is ample provision under the O.G.L.S. Act to cancel the lease
granted in favour of beneficiary and in fact, the said settlements had undergone the
test of its validity. It appears from the impugned orders that the Assistant Settlement
Officer/Addl. Sub-Collector conveniently avoided the settlement made under the
O.G.L.S. Act by ignoring the same, which is not permissible under law. The impugned
orders have, in effect, resulted in cancelling the lease granted in favour of beneficiary,
which is not within the domain of the settlement authorities. My view gets support
from the case of Lily Nanda v. State of Odisha reported in 2018 (I) OLR 559. As such,
the impugned orders are without jurisdiction and the same are void. The action taken
or publication made pursuant to the said void orders are also equally ineffective and
no nest in the eyes of law. Thus, final publication of the R.O.Rs. under Section 12-B of
the Act, 1958 pursuant to the void orders is not sustainable in the eyes of law."
13. The learned Single Judge in the above judgment went so far as to say that even if such order of
the ASO under the OSS Act had resulted in a final publication of the ROR under Section 12- B of the
OSS Act that would not be sustainable in the eye of law. Consequently, even the RORs published
pursuant to the final list were set aside. The matters were remitted to the authorities under the OSS
Act for a fresh a adjudication in accordance with law after giving an opportunity of hearing to the
parties concerned.
14. At one stage of the arguments in the present cases, a question arose whether in many of these
cases there had been a final publication of the list as envisaged in Rule 29 of the Orissa Survey and
Settlement Rules, 1962 (OSS Rules)? That was because in terms of Section 13 of the OSS Act, the
final publication of the list lends a presumption of correctness to every entry made on the ROR and
the remedy for a person aggrieved by such entry in the final list published under Section 13 of the
OSS Act is to prefer a revision petition under Section 15(b) of the OSS Act before the Board of
Revenue. Where there is no such final publication of list, and an order has been passed by an ASO at
the stage of publication of the draft ROR under Section 12 of the OSS Act, the remedy lies by way of
an appeal under Section 12-A of the OSS Act.
15. In some of the cases before us, such appeals were in fact filed and rejected by the Appellate
Authority under Section 12-A of the OSS Act perhaps on the ground that in the meanwhile a final list
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146182691/ 11
Narottam Rath vs State Of Odisha And Another .... ... on 2 January, 2023
had been published. However, the position is not very clear from the pleadings in these writ
petitions. Therefore, two scenarios can possibly emerge i.e., one where there has been a final
publication of the ROR in terms of Section 13 of the OSS Act read with Rule 29 of the OSS Rules and
another where there has been no such final publication of the ROR. Nevertheless in both scenarios,
a common feature, as already noticed, in all these writ petitions is that ASOs have passed orders
declining the request of the Petitioners for recording their names in the ROR in respect of the land
in question. It must be noted at this stage that in all these writ petitions while issuing notice, this
Court had directed status quo to be maintained and that interim order has continued. In most of
these writ petitions, no counter affidavits have been filed despite the petitions having been pending
over 8 years now.
16. Be that as it may, it is plain that in all these cases, the ASOs exercised 'suo motu powers' to
override the orders of the ADM under the OGLS Act in favour of the predecessors-in-interest of the
Petitioners or refused to record their names in the ROR despite there being no objections to the
draft publication of the ROR.
17. Clearly the ASOs were acting without jurisdiction and beyond the scope of their powers under
the OSS Act. It is obvious that powers which could have been exercised only under the OGLS Act
were sought to be exercised by the ASO which was impermissible in law for them to do. The above
extracted portions of the orders of this Court conclusively settle the legal position in this regard and
do not bear repetition.
18. The question that next arises is what should be the consequential orders passed by this Court
consequent upon the setting aside of all such orders of the ASOs and the Appellate Authorities under
the OSS Act, which are without jurisdiction. One course of action, as has been done in some of the
cases, is to remand the matters to the ASO for a fresh decision by following the law and the correct
legal procedure. However, that course does not commend itself to this Court for the simple reason
that there have been at least two rounds of litigations already involving these very Petitioners and
their lands in question. Remanding the matters would only multiply litigation when the legal
position is already clear. If the Government seeks to recover land which it believes belongs to the
Government, then there are enough provisions under the OGLS Act to take care of such
contingencies. For instance Section 3-B of the OGLS Act provides for resumption of land and
imposition of penalty. The Rules made under the OGLS Act set out the detailed procedure for
exercise of such powers. In other words, the Government is not powerless or remediless in such a
contingency. There is no need for an ASO exercising limited powers under the OSS Act to take up on
himself or herself the task of seeking to recover Government land when there are no such powers
vested in the ASO under the OSS Act.
19. In that view of the matter, the following directions are issued in all these writ petitions:
(i) The impugned orders of the ASOs declining to accept the request of the Petitioners
for recording of their names in the ROR in respect of the lands in question on the
ground that the land belongs to the Government, are hereby set aside;

(ii) The corresponding orders by the Appellate Authorities affirming such orders of
the ASOs are also hereby set aside;
(iii) A direction is issued to the ASOs to now proceed to record the names of the
respective Petitioners concerning the land in question in their names in the ROR, in
accordance with law within a period of eight weeks.
(iv) Where the land in question stands recorded in the final published RoR in the
name of the Government that entry will stand cancelled by virtue of this order and
the ASO will proceed to record it in favour of the respective Petitioners.
20. The above directions will be carried out within a period of four months from today. It is made
clear that this order will not prevent the Government from exercising powers under Section 3-B of
the OGLS Act, in accordance with law.
21. The writ petitions are disposed of in the above terms.
