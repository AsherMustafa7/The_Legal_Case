2. The facts of the case giving rise to filing of these petitions are as follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/25176794/ 24
Sri N G Shastri vs Central Bureau Of Investigation on 29 November, 2023
a) An unfortunate incident occurred at the City Civil Court Complex in Bengaluru,
resulting in multiple first information reports (FIRs) being filed against the police
personnel, members of the Advocates Association, Bengaluru (AAB) and media
personnel. The AAB and the Advocates, alleging that the local police conducting
investigation was not fair and impartial, petitioned this Court to transfer the
investigation to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). However, this Court
declined the request, prompting the AAB to seek relief from the Hon'ble Supreme
Court which eventually acceded to the request and transferred the investigation to
the CBI.
b) The CBI registered the following five first information reports:
Five FIRs were registered by the C.B.I:-
1. RC No.7(S)/2013 and RC No.8(S)/2013 were registered on the basis of the two
crimes registered at the behest of the Police.
2. RC No.9(S)/2013 was registered on the basis of Crime No.206/2013 registered on
the complaint of the Registrar, City Civil Court.
3. RC No.10(S)/2013 was registered on the basis of the Crime No.222/2012, on the
Complaint of Advocates' Association.
- 28 -
NC: 2023:KHC:43558 CRL.P No. 977 of 2015 AND CONNECTED MATTERS
4. RC No.11(S)/2013 was registered on the basis of one of the Complaints lodged by the Media.
3. The CBI after conducting investigation submitted the charge sheets before the learned Magistrate.
The learned Magistrate took cognizance of the offences alleged against the petitioners. Taking
exception to the same, these petitions are filed.
4. Sri S Vijayshankar, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners/police personnel would make the
following submissions:
a) Previous sanction of the State Government under the provisions of Section 197 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and under the provisions of Section 170 of the
Karnataka Police Act, 1963 is "sine qua non" for prosecution of a public servant
accused of any offence alleged to have been committed by him while acting or
purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty and that no Court shall take
cognizance of such offence except with the previous sanction of the State
Government.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/25176794/ 25
Sri N G Shastri vs Central Bureau Of Investigation on 29 November, 2023
5. Chapter X of the Criminal Procedure Code deals with maintenance of public order and tranquility.
Division "A" thereof is unlawful assemblies. Section 129 is dispersal of such assembly by use of civil
force as distinguished from use of armed forces to disperse such assembly. Section 132 gives
- 29 -
NC: 2023:KHC:43558 CRL.P No. 977 of 2015 AND CONNECTED MATTERS protection against
prosecution for acts done under Section 129. Section 132 further states that no prosecution shall be
instituted in any Criminal Court except with the sanction of the State Government. Sub-section (2)
Clause (b) lays down that no person doing any act in good faith in compliance with a requisition
under Section 129 shall be deemed to have thereby committed an offence. Section 141 of the Indian
Penal Code defines an unlawful assembly.
6. Chapter XIV is conditions requisite for initiation of proceedings. Section 197 is prosecution of
Judges and public servants. Every officer of the Government whose duty it is, as such officer, to
prevent offences, to give information of offences, to bring offenders to justice, or to protect the
public health, safety or convenience, is a public servant. (Section 21, Eighth description of the Indian
penal code, 1860). Sub-section (1) of Section 197 states that a public servant accused of any offence
alleged to have been committed by him while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his
official duty, no Court shall take cognizance of such offence except with the previous sanction of the
State Government. In this regard, emphasis is laid on the word "previous".
7. Sub-section (1) of Section 170 of the Karnataka Police Act states that in any case of alleged offence
by a Police officer or Reserve Police officer, by an act done under colour or in excess of any such duty
as aforesaid, or wherein it shall appear to the court that the offence or wrong if committed or done
was of the character aforesaid, the prosecution shall not
- 30 -
NC: 2023:KHC:43558 CRL.P No. 977 of 2015 AND CONNECTED MATTERS be entertained except
with the "previous" sanction of the Government.
8. In the present case it is indisputable that the previous sanction of the State Government was not
taken before prosecuting the public servants for acts done by them in the discharge of official duties
on 02-03-2012. The learned Magistrate had no jurisdiction to take cognizance of the charge sheets
filed by the C.B.I.
9. The C.B.I. in the charge sheet dated 27-12-2014 filed against the public servants, advocates and
media- television-persons, categorically stated in paragraph 15.34 that sanction for prosecution
under Section 197 Cr.P.C. and under Section 170 of the Karnataka Police Act will be submitted in
due course. (Page 91 of Annexure "C" in Criminal Petition 977/2015 of P.S. Gachinakatti, Retired
Assistant Commissioner of Police). The charge sheet which is filed in gross violation of the statutory
mandate of previous sanction of the State Government is to be quashed on the said threshold
illegality without going into the facts of the case.

Sri N G Shastri vs Central Bureau Of Investigation on 29 November, 2023
10. The submission that the charge sheets are to be quashed on the ground of lack of previous
sanction without examining the merits of the case is supported by precedent. In Criminal Petition
No. 6926 of 2015 on the file of this Hon'ble Court decided on 03-09-2019, the charge sheet filed by
the C.B.I. against media-television-personnel alleging commission of offences under Sections 120B
and 153(A)(1)(b) I.P.C., Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 and

incidents which occurred on 02-03-2012, was quashed for want of previous sanction under Section
196 of the Criminal procedure Code (which is in pari-materia with Section 197 Cr.P.C) and for
non-compliance with Section 18 of the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995. The
counsel for the C.B.I. did not dispute the fact that the mandatory requirements of Section 18 of the
Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995 as well as the requirements of Section 196 Cr.P.C.
have not been complied with. This Hon'ble Court may be pleased to quash the present charge sheet
for the same reasons. It is the further submission that the fair submission made by the counsel for
the C.B.I. is also made in the present cases. Without prejudice to the above, the following
submissions are made.

submissions:

Sri N G Shastri vs Central Bureau Of Investigation on 29 November, 2023
a) The then Director General and the Inspector General of Police having directed the
then Commissioner of Police to withdraw the police from the City Civil Court
Premises and the police deployed having been removed, the accused police personnel
had no authority to enter the Civil Court premises and any act done thereafter does
not come under the purview of discharging their duties.
Therefore, the accused police personnel having resorted to violence and damaged the properties are
not entitled for protection under Section 197 of Cr.PC and Section 170 of Karnataka Police Act, 1963.
b) The requirement of granting sanction to prosecute before taking cognizance of the offences
alleged against the accused police personnel is not mandatory, and the Trial Court at any time after
taking cognizance can examine whether the act/s of the accused police personnel was in the course
of performance of the duties. Therefore, the question of sanction can be left open to be decided at a
later stage and at this stage, the cognizance taken does not warrant any interference.

15. After examining the submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties, the main issue
involved in these petitions revolves around determining whether the action of the petitioners, who
are the police personnel were carried out within the scope of the duties or if they exceeded their
duties, influencing their eligibility to seek protection under Section 197 Cr.PC and Section 170 of
Police Protection Act.
16. Before delving into the matter at hand, it is pertinent to cite Section 197 of Cr.PC and Section 170
Karnataka Police Act and extract the legal principle associated with the said provisions.
17. Section 197 of Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973:
197. Prosecution of Judges and public servants.
(1) When any person who is or was a Judge or Magistrate or a public servant not
removable from his office save by or with the sanction of the Government is accused
of any offence alleged to have been committed by him while acting or purporting to
act in the discharge of his official duty, no Court shall take cognizance of such offence
except with the previous sanction-
(a) in the case of a person who is employed or, as the case may be, was at the time of
commission of the alleged offence employed, in connection with the affairs of the
Union, of the Central Government;
(b) in the case of a person who is employed or, as the case may be, was at the time of
commission of the alleged offence employed, in connection with the affairs of a State,
of the State Government:

NC: 2023:KHC:43558 CRL.P No. 977 of 2015 AND CONNECTED MATTERS
Provided that where the alleged offence was committed by a person referred to in
clause (b) during the period while a Proclamation issued under clause (1) of article
356 of the Constitution was in force in a State, clause (b) will apply as if for the
expression" State Government" occurring therein, the expression" Central

[Explanation: For the removal of doubts it is hereby declared that no sanction shall
be required in case of a public servant accused of any offence alleged to have been
committed under section 166A, section 166B, section 354, section 354A, section
354B, section 354C, section 354D, section 370, section 375, section 376, [section
376A, section 376AB, section 376C, section 376D, section 376DA, section 376DB] or
section 509 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1869)] (2) No Court shall take cognizance
of any offence alleged to have been committed by any member of the Armed Forces of
the Union while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty, except
with the previous sanction of the Central Government.
(3) The State Government may, by notification, direct that the provisions of sub-
section (2) shall apply to such class or category of the members of the Forces charged with the
maintenance of public order as may be specified therein, wherever they may be serving, and
thereupon the provisions of that sub- section will apply as if for the expression" Central
Government"
occurring therein, the expression" State Government" were substituted.
3(A) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub- section (3), no court shall take
cognizance of any offence, alleged to have been committed by any member of the
Forces charged with the maintenance of public order in a State while acting

purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty during the period while a
Proclamation issued under clause (1) of article 356 of the Constitution was in force
therein, except with the previous sanction of the Central Government.
(3B) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Code or any other
law, it is hereby declared that any sanction accorded by the State Government or any
cognizance taken by a court upon such sanction, during the period commencing on
the 20th day of August, 1991 and ending with the date immediately preceding the
date on which the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1991, receives the
assent of the President, with respect to an offence alleged to have been committed
during the period while a Proclamation issued under clause (1) of article 356 of the
Constitution was in force in the State, shall be invalid and it shall be competent for
the Central Government in such matter to accord sanction and for the court to take
cognizance thereon.] (4) The Central Government or the State Government, as the
case may be, may determine the person by whom, the manner in which, and the
offence or offences for which, the prosecution of such Judge, Magistrate or public

servant is to be conducted, and may specify the Court before which the trial is to be
held.
18. Section 170 of Karnataka Police Act:
170. Suits or prosecutions in respect of acts done under colour of duty as aforesaid
not to be entertained without sanction of Government.--(1) In any case of alleged
offence by the Commissioner, a Magistrate, Police Officer or Reserve Police Officer or
other person, or of a wrong alleged to have been done by such Commissioner,
Magistrate, Police Officer or Reserve Police Officer or other person, by any act done
under colour or in excess of any such duty or

NC: 2023:KHC:43558 CRL.P No. 977 of 2015 AND CONNECTED MATTERS authority as aforesaid,
or wherein it shall appear to the court that the offence or wrong if committed or done was of the
character aforesaid, the prosecution or suit shall not be entertained except with the previous
sanction of the Government.
(2) In the case of an intended suit on account of such a wrong as aforesaid, the person intending to
sue shall be bound to give to the alleged wrongdoer one month's notice at least of the intended suit
with sufficient description of the wrong complained of, failing which such suit shall be dismissed.
(3) The plaint shall set forth that a notice as aforesaid has been served on the defendant and the date
of such service, and shall state whether any, and if so, what tender of amends has been made by the
defendant. A copy of the said notice shall be annexed to the plaint endorsed or accompanied with a
declaration by the plaintiff of the time and manner of service thereof.
(2019) 6 SCC 111 S.K. Miglani v. State (NCT of Delhi, Paras 14, 16:
i) At the stage, when the Court was considering the question regarding applicability
of Section 197 CrPC, it was not necessary for the CMM to make an observation that
the appellant had done an act of forgery. The FSL Report was one of the pieces of
evidence collected by IO. Its evidentiary value was still to be gone into at the time of
trial in the light of the evidence, which may come before the trial court.
ii) The observation made by CMM as extracted above, by giving an opinion using the
expression that the appellant has committed forgery, ought to have been avoided.
The Magistrate, at any stage prior to the final trial, is to avoid any conclusive opinion regarding any
evidence collected during the investigation. It is true that evidence collected in the investigation can
be looked into to form an opinion as to whether prima facie charge

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/25176794/ 31
Sri N G Shastri vs Central Bureau Of Investigation on 29 November, 2023
NC: 2023:KHC:43558 CRL.P No. 977 of 2015 AND CONNECTED MATTERS is made out against an
accused and what is the nature of the offence alleged against him.
(2015) 2 SCC 33 Manzoor Ali Khan v. Union of India, Para 13 Thus, while it is not possible to hold
that the requirement of sanction is unconstitutional, the competent authority has to take a decision
on the issue of sanction expeditiously as already observed. A fine balance has to be maintained
between need to protect a public servant against mala fide prosecution on the one hand and the
object of upholding the probity in public life in prosecuting the public servant against whom prima
facie material in support of allegation of corruption exists, on the other hand.
(2012) 3 SCC 64 Subramanian Swamy v. Manmohan Singh, Para 44 We may also observe that grant
or refusal of sanction is not a quasi-judicial function and the person for whose prosecution the
sanction is sought is not required to be heard by the competent authority before it takes a decision
in the matter. What is required to be seen by the competent authority is whether the facts placed
before it which, in a given case, may include the material collected by the complainant or the
investigating agency prima facie disclose commission of an offence by a public servant. If the
competent authority is satisfied that the material placed before it is sufficient for prosecution of the
public servant, then it is required to grant sanction. If the satisfaction of the competent authority is
otherwise, then it can refuse sanction. In either case, the decision taken on the complaint made by a
citizen is required to be communicated to him and if he feels aggrieved by such decision, then he can
avail of appropriate legal remedy.
(2009) 17 SCC 92 - State of Punjab v. Mohd. Iqbal Bhatti, Paras 6, 7.
i) Although the State in the matter of grant or refusal to grant sanction exercises statutory
jurisdiction, the same, however, would not mean that power once exercised cannot be exercised
once again. For exercising its
- 39 -
NC: 2023:KHC:43558 CRL.P No. 977 of 2015 AND CONNECTED MATTERS jurisdiction at a
subsequent stage, express power of review in the State may not be necessary as even such a power is
administrative in character. It is, however, beyond any cavill that while passing an order for grant of
sanction, serious application of mind on the part of the authority concerned is imperative. The
legality and/or validity of the order granting sanction would be subject to review by the criminal
courts. An order refusing to grant sanction may attract judicial review by the superior courts.
ii) Validity of an order of sanction would depend upon application of mind on the part of the
authority concerned and the material placed before it. All such material facts and material evidence
must be considered by it. The sanctioning authority must apply its mind on such material facts and
evidence collected during the investigation. Even such application of mind does not appear from the
order of sanction, extrinsic evidence may be placed before the court on that behalf. While granting
sanction, the authority cannot take into consideration an irrelevant fact nor can it pass an order on
extraneous consideration not germane for passing a statutory order. It is also well settled that the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/25176794/ 32
Sri N G Shastri vs Central Bureau Of Investigation on 29 November, 2023
superior courts cannot direct the sanctioning authority either to grant sanction or not to do so. The
source of power of an authority passing an order of sanction must also be considered. The authority
concerned cannot also pass an order of sanction subject to ratification of a higher authority.
(2006) 1 SCC 294 Romesh Lal Jain v Naginder Singh Rana, Para 14 It is also beyond any cavil of
doubt that an order granting or refusing sanction must be preceded by application of mind on the
part of the appropriate authority. If the complainant or the accused can demonstrate such an order
granting or refusing sanction to be suffering from non-application of mind, the same may be called
in question before a competent court of law.
(2002) 6 SCC 543 Raj Kishor Roy v. Kamleshwar Pandey, Para
- 40 -
NC: 2023:KHC:43558 CRL.P No. 977 of 2015 AND CONNECTED MATTERS In this case, as
indicated above, the complaint was that the 1st respondent had falsely implicated the appellant and
his brother in order to teach them a lesson for not paying anything to him. The complaint was that
the 1st respondent had brought an illegal weapon and cartridges and falsely shown them to have
been recovered from the appellant and his brother. The High Court was not right in saying that even
if these facts are true then also the case would come within the purview of Section 197 CrPC. The
question whether these acts were committed and/or whether the 1st respondent acted in discharge
of his duties could not have been decided in this summary fashion. This is the type of case where the
prosecution must be given an opportunity to establish its case by evidence and an opportunity given
to the defence to establish that he had been acting in the official course of his duty. The question
whether the 1st respondent acted in the course of performance of duties and/or whether the defence
is pretended or fanciful can only be examined during the course of trial. In our view, in this case the
question of sanction should be left open to be decided in the main judgment which may be delivered
upon conclusion of trial.
19. No Blanket Requirement of sanction for prosecuting all public servants.
(2019) 4 SCC 351-Devendra Prasad Singh v. State of Bihar, Paras - 3,6,10,11.
i) The question, which arises for consideration in this appeal, is whether the High Court was
justified in quashing the complaint filed by the appellant (complainant) against Respondent 2
holding that there was no prima facie case made out against Respondent 2 for issuance of the
process of the summons to him for commission of the offences punishable under Sections 323, 341,
379 and 504 IPC.
ii) The High Court quashed the complaint essentially on two grounds; First, no sanction under
Section 197 CrPC was obtained by the prosecution for filing the complaint against Respondent 2 and
the second, there are

Sri N G Shastri vs Central Bureau Of Investigation on 29 November, 2023
NC: 2023:KHC:43558 CRL.P No. 977 of 2015 AND CONNECTED MATTERS contradictions in the
statement of the complainant and the witnesses.
iii) In our view, in order to attract the rigor of Section 197 CrPC, it is necessary that the offence
alleged against a government officer must have some nexus or/and relation with the discharge of his
official duties as a government officer. In this case, we do not find it to be so.
iv) So far as the second ground is concerned, we are of the view that the High Court while hearing
the application under Section 482 CrPC had no jurisdiction to appreciate the statement of the
witnesses and record a finding that there were inconsistencies in their statements and, therefore,
there was no prima facie case made out against Respondent 2. In our view, this could be done only
in the trial while deciding the issues on the merits or/and by the appellate court while deciding the
appeal arising out of the final order passed by the trial court but not in Section 482 CrPC
proceedings.
v) In view of the foregoing discussion, we allow the appeal, set aside the impugned order [Umesh
Kumar v. State of Bihar, Criminal Miscellaneous No. 35751 of 2014, order dated 9-8-2017 (Pat)] and
restore the aforementioned complaint case to its original file for being proceeded with on merits in
accordance with law.
(2016) 8 SCC 722, Surinderjit Singh Mand v. State of Punjab, Para - 20.
Keeping the legal position emerging from the provisions of the Code referred to in the foregoing
paragraphs in mind, it was the contention of the learned counsel for the respondents that in order to
require sanction under Section 197 of the Code, it needs to be further established that the appellants
had acted in the manner provided for under the provisions of the Code during the period Neeraj
Kumar was allegedly arrested (from 24-6- 1999 to 28-6-1999) i.e. before his admitted formal arrest
on 28-6-1999. And only if they had done so, the requirement of seeking sanction under Section 197
would arise because in that situation the offence allegedly committed would be taken to have been
- 42 -
NC: 2023:KHC:43558 CRL.P No. 977 of 2015 AND CONNECTED MATTERS committed "while
acting or purporting to act in the discharge of their official duties". In the present case the arrest and
detention of Neeraj Kumar from 24-6-1999 to 28-6-1999 is denied. The formalities postulated under
the Code on the alleged arrest of Neeraj Kumar on 24-6- 1999 were admittedly not complied with, as
according to the appellants Neeraj Kumar was not arrested on that date. It was therefore submitted
that any arrest or detention prior to 28-6-1999, if true, was obviously without following the
mandatory conditions of arrest and detention contemplated under the provisions (referred to
above). And therefore, would not fall within the realm of "acting or purporting to act in the
discharge of their official duties".

Sri N G Shastri vs Central Bureau Of Investigation on 29 November, 2023
i) The test of direct and reasonable connection between the official duty of the accused and the acts
allegedly committed by them is, therefore, the true test to be applied while deciding whether the
protection of Section 197 CrPC is available to a public servant accused of the commission of an
offence. The High Court has not adverted to this test nor has it held that there existed a direct and
reasonable connection between the official duty being discharged by the accused public servant and
the acts committed by him. The High Court has on the contrary misdirected itself when it said that
the accused had only committed an act of omission towards his official duties which entitled him to
the protection of Section 197 of the Code.
ii) It is difficult to appreciate what the High Court meant by saying that the acts of the accused were
"at best acts of omission towards official duty". It was not the case of the respondent before the High
Court nor is it his case before us that the complaint filed by Maya Devi disclosed any offence which
could be taken cognizance of by him as an Executive Magistrate or investigated by the police.
Assuming that the complainant and R.C. Chopra were living together even when they were not
married to each other, the complaint regarding any such relationship could be filed only by the wife
of R.C. Chopra, or the husband of the complainant Urmila Devi.
- 43 -
NC: 2023:KHC:43558 CRL.P No. 977 of 2015 AND CONNECTED MATTERS The complaint filed by
Maya Devi could not provide a valid basis for the SDM, the Tahsildar or the Deputy Superintendent
of Police concerned to barge into the house of the complainant, humiliate or harass her or drag her
to the police station without the registration of any case or subject her to an uncalled for medical
examination. The test of direct and reasonable connection between the official duty of the
respondent Sub-Divisional Magistrate and the police officers concerned and the acts complained of
thus fails in the present case especially because there is not even a semblance of a lawful justification
forthcoming from the respondent for what he did. Entering the house of a woman, after sunset with
a posse of police force, carrying video cameras conducting an unwarranted search of the house,
humiliating and invading the privacy of the complainant, insulting and humiliating R.C. Chopra by
asking him to undress and dragging both of them to the police station for medical examination
against their wishes, especially when male doctors were asked to examine the complainant which
added insult to injury, all remain unsupported by any lawful justification and have no connection
with the duties that were cast upon the respondent as a public servant, even if a complaint alleging
an adulterous relationship between the appellant and R.C. Chopra had been received by the SDM.
The alleged acts of the respondent cannot, therefore, be said to be in discharge of his official duties
or in the purported discharge of such duties.
iii) Public functionaries cannot under the cloak of purported discharge of official duties resort to
harassment and humiliation of the citizens on the pretext of a complaint having been received by
them, especially when the same does not disclose the commission of any offence triable by the
Executive Magistrate or cognizable by the police; nor was there any other proceeding in connection
with which such conduct could be justified in law. The plea of the respondent that the prosecution
was barred under Section 197 CrPC has, therefore, to be rejected.

87,Devinder Singh v. State of Punjab, Para - 40.
In the instant cases, the allegation as per the prosecution case is that it was a case of fake encounter
or death caused by torture whereas the defence of the accused person is that it was a case in
discharge of official duty and as the deceased was involved in the terrorist activities and while
maintaining law and order the incident has taken place. The incident was in the course of discharge
of official duty. Considering the aforesaid principles in case the version of the prosecution is found
to be correct, there is no requirement of any sanction. However, it would be open to the accused
persons to adduce the evidence in defence and to submit such other materials on record indicating
that the incident has taken place in discharge of their official duties and the orders passed earlier
would not come in the way of the trial court to decide the question afresh in the light of the aforesaid
principles from stage to stage or even at the time of conclusion of the trial at the time of judgment.
As at this stage it cannot be said which version is correct. The trial court has prima facie to proceed
on the basis of the prosecution version and can re-decide the question afresh in case from the
evidence adduced by the prosecution or by the accused or in any other manner it comes to the notice
of the court that there was a reasonable nexus of the incident with discharge of official duty, the
court shall re-examine the question of sanction and take decision in accordance with law. The trial

The above discussion will now require the Court to consider the question as to whether the acts
giving rise to the alleged offences had been committed by the accused in the actual or purported
discharge of his official duties. In a series of pronouncements commencing with K. Satwant Singh v.
State of Punjab [AIR 1960 SC 266 : 1960 Cri LJ 410] ; Harihar Prasad v. State of Bihar [(1972) 3 SCC

1 : (2007) 1 SCC (Cri) 193] it has been consistently held that it can be no part of the duty of a public
servant or acting in the discharge of his official duties to commit any of the offences covered by
Sections 406, 409, 420, etc. and the official status of the public servant can, at best, only provide an
opportunity for commission of the offences. Therefore, no sanction for prosecution of the public
servant for such offences would be required under Section 197 of the Code. Notwithstanding the
above, the High Court had granted liberty to the appellant to raise the issue of sanction, if so
required, depending on the evidence that may come on record in the course of the trial. Despite the
view taken by this Court in the series of pronouncements referred to above, the opportunity that has
been provided by the High Court to the benefit of the appellant need not be foreclosed by us

inasmuch as in Matajog Dobey v. H.C. Bhari [AIR 1956 SC 44 : 1956 Cri LJ 140] , P.K. Pradhan v.
State of Sikkim [(2001) 6 SCC 704 : 2001 SCC (Cri) 1234] and Parkash Singh Badal [(2007) 1 SCC 1 :
(2007) 1 SCC (Cri) 193] this Court had consistently held that the question of sanction under Section
197 of the Code can be raised at any time after cognizance had been taken and may have to be
determined at different stages of the proceeding/trial.
(2001) 6 SCC 704, P.K.Pradahan v State of Sikkim, Para -15.
Thus, from a conspectus of the aforesaid decisions, it will be clear that for claiming protection under
Section 197 of the Code, it has to be shown by the accused that there is reasonable connection
between the act complained of and the discharge of official duty. An official act can be performed in
the discharge of official duty as well as in dereliction of it. For invoking protection under Section 197
of the Code, the acts of the accused complained of must be such that the same cannot be separated
from the discharge of official duty, but if there was no reasonable connection between them and the
performance of those duties, the official status furnishes only the occasion or opportunity for the
acts, then no sanction would be required. If the case as put forward by the prosecution fails or the
defence establishes that the act purported to be done is in discharge of duty, the proceedings will
have to be dropped. It is well settled that question of sanction
- 46 -
NC: 2023:KHC:43558 CRL.P No. 977 of 2015 AND CONNECTED MATTERS under Section 197 of
the Code can be raised any time after the cognizance; maybe immediately after cognizance or
framing of charge or even at the time of conclusion of trial and after conviction as well. But there
may be certain cases where it may not be possible to decide the question effectively without giving
opportunity to the defence to establish that what he did was in discharge of official duty. In order to
come to the conclusion whether claim of the accused that the act that he did was in course of the
performance of his duty was a reasonable one and neither pretended nor fanciful, can be examined
during the course of trial by giving opportunity to the defence to establish it. In such an eventuality,
the question of sanction should be left open to be decided in the main judgment which may be
delivered upon conclusion of the trial.
21. Principles Regarding Section 197 Cr.PC summarised by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.
(2016) 12 SCC 87, Devinder Singh v. State of Punjab, Para - 39.
The principles emerging from the aforesaid decisions are summarised hereunder:
* Protection of sanction is an assurance to an honest and sincere officer to perform
his duty honestly and to the best of his ability to further public duty. However,
authority cannot be camouflaged to commit crime.
* Once an act or omission has been found to have been committed by a public servant
in discharging his duty it must be given liberal and wide construction so far its official
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/25176794/ 37
Sri N G Shastri vs Central Bureau Of Investigation on 29 November, 2023
nature is concerned. Public servants are not entitled to indulge in criminal activities.
To that extent Section 197 CrPC has to be construed narrowly and in a restricted
manner.
* Even in cases when a public servant has exceeded in his duty, if there is reasonable
connection it will not deprive him of protection under Section 197 CrPC. There
cannot be a universal rule to determine whether there is a reasonable nexus between
the act done and official duty nor is it possible to lay down such rule.
- 47 -
NC: 2023:KHC:43558 CRL.P No. 977 of 2015 AND CONNECTED MATTERS * In
case the assault made is intrinsically connected with or related to performance of
official duties, sanction would be necessary under Section 197 CrPC, but such relation
to duty should not be a pretended or fanciful claim. The offence must be directly and
reasonably connected with official duty to require sanction. It is not part of official
duty to commit an offence. In case offence was incomplete without proving, the
official act, ordinarily the provisions of Section 197 CrPC would apply.
* In case sanction is necessary, it has to be decided by competent authority and
sanction has to be issued on the basis of sound objective assessment. The court is not
to be a sanctioning authority.
* Ordinarily, question of sanction should be dealt with at the stage of taking
cognizance, but if the cognizance is taken erroneously and the same comes to the
notice of court at a later stage, finding to that effect is permissible and such a plea can
be taken first time before the appellate court. It may arise at inception itself. There is
no requirement that the accused must wait till charges are framed.
* Question of sanction can be raised at the time of framing of charge and it can be
decided prima facie on the basis of accusation. It is open to decide it afresh in light of
evidence adduced after conclusion of trial or at other appropriate stage.
* In some cases it may not be possible to decide the question effectively and finally
without giving opportunity to the defence to adduce evidence. Question of good faith
or bad faith may be decided at the conclusion of trial.
(2013) 8 SCC 119, State of Maharashtra v. Mahesh G. Jain, Para - 14.
From the aforesaid authorities the following principles can be culled out:
- 48 -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/25176794/ 38
Sri N G Shastri vs Central Bureau Of Investigation on 29 November, 2023
NC: 2023:KHC:43558 CRL.P No. 977 of 2015 AND CONNECTED MATTERS * It is
incumbent on the prosecution to prove that the valid sanction has been granted by
the sanctioning authority after being satisfied that a case for sanction has been made
out.
* The sanction order may expressly show that the sanctioning authority has perused
the material placed before it and, after consideration of the circumstances, has
granted sanction for prosecution.
* The prosecution may prove by adducing the evidence that the material was placed
before the sanctioning authority and its satisfaction was arrived at upon perusal of
the material placed before it.
* Grant of sanction is only an administrative function and the sanctioning authority is
required to prima facie reach the satisfaction that relevant facts would constitute the
offence.
* The adequacy of material placed before the sanctioning authority cannot be gone
into by the court as it does not sit in appeal over the sanction order.
* If the sanctioning authority has perused all the materials placed before it and some
of them have not been proved that would not vitiate the order of sanction.
* The order of sanction is a prerequisite as it is intended to provide a safeguard to a
public servant against frivolous and vexatious litigants, but simultaneously an order
of sanction should not be construed in a pedantic manner and there should not be a
hypertechnical approach to test its validity.
In the case of D Devaraja -vs- Owais Sabir Hussain (2020) 7 SCC 695, it is held at
paras-65 to 73 as follows:
65. The law relating to the requirement of sanction to entertain and/or take
cognizance of an offence, allegedly committed by a police officer under Section 197 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure read with Section 170 of the Karnataka Police Act, is
well settled by this Court, inter alia by its decisions referred to above.
- 49 -
NC: 2023:KHC:43558 CRL.P No. 977 of 2015 AND CONNECTED MATTERS
66. Sanction of the Government, to prosecute a police officer, for any act related to the discharge of
an official duty, is imperative to protect the police officer from facing harassive, retaliatory,
revengeful and frivolous proceedings. The requirement of sanction from the Government, to
prosecute would give an upright police officer the confidence to discharge his official duties
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/25176794/ 39
Sri N G Shastri vs Central Bureau Of Investigation on 29 November, 2023
efficiently, without fear of vindictive retaliation by initiation of criminal action, from which he would
be protected under Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, read with Section 170 of the
Karnataka Police Act. At the same time, if the policeman has committed a wrong, which constitutes
a criminal offence and renders him liable for prosecution, he can be prosecuted with sanction from
the appropriate Government.
67. Every offence committed by a police officer does not attract Section 197 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure read with Section 170 of the Karnataka Police Act. The protection given under Section 197
of the Criminal Procedure Code read with Section 170 of the Karnataka Police Act has its limitations.
The protection is available only when the alleged act done by the public servant is reasonably
connected with the discharge of his official duty and official duty is not merely a cloak for the
objectionable act. An offence committed entirely outside the scope of the duty of the police officer,
would certainly not require sanction. To cite an example, a policeman assaulting a domestic help or
indulging in domestic violence would certainly not be entitled to protection. However, if an act is
connected to the discharge of official duty of investigation of a recorded criminal case, the act is
certainly under colour of duty, no matter how illegal the act may be.
68. If in doing an official duty a policeman has acted in excess of duty, but there is a reasonable
connection between the act and the performance of the official duty, the fact that the act alleged is in
excess of duty will not be ground enough to deprive the policeman of the protection of the
government sanction for initiation of criminal action against him.
69. The language and tenor of Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and Section 170 of the
Karnataka
- 50 -
NC: 2023:KHC:43558 CRL.P No. 977 of 2015 AND CONNECTED MATTERS Police Act makes it
absolutely clear that sanction is required not only for acts done in discharge of official duty, it is also
required for an act purported to be done in discharge of official duty and/or act done under colour of
or in excess of such duty or authority.
70. To decide whether sanction is necessary, the test is whether the act is totally unconnected with
official duty or whether there is a reasonable connection with the official duty. In the case of an act
of a policeman or any other public servant unconnected with the official duty there can be no
question of sanction. However, if the act alleged against a policeman is reasonably connected with
discharge of his official duty, it does not matter if the policeman has exceeded the scope of his
powers and/or acted beyond the four corners of law.
71. If the act alleged in a complaint purported to be filed against the policeman is reasonably
connected to discharge of some official duty, cognizance thereof cannot be taken unless requisite
sanction of the appropriate Government is obtained under Section 197 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure and/or Section 170 of the Karnataka Police Act.

Sri N G Shastri vs Central Bureau Of Investigation on 29 November, 2023
72. On the question of the stage at which the trial court has to examine whether sanction has been
obtained and if not whether the criminal proceedings should be nipped in the bud, there are diverse
decisions of this Court.
73. While this Court has, in D.T. Virupakshappa [D.T. Virupakshappa v. C. Subash, (2015) 12 SCC
231 :
(2016) 1 SCC (Cri) 82] held that the High Court had erred [D.T. Virupakshappa v. C.
Subash, 2013 SCC OnLine Kar 10774] in not setting aside an order of the trial court
taking cognizance of a complaint, in exercise of the power under Section 482 of the
Criminal Procedure Code, in Matajog Dobey [Matajog Dobey v.
H.C. Bhari, AIR 1956 SC 44 : 1956 Cri LJ 140] this Court held that it is not always necessary that the
need for sanction under Section 197 is to be considered as soon as the complaint is lodged and on
the allegations contained therein. The complainant may not disclose that the act constituting the
offence was done or purported to be done in the discharge of official duty and/or under colour of
duty. However, the facts
- 51 -
NC: 2023:KHC:43558 CRL.P No. 977 of 2015 AND CONNECTED MATTERS subsequently coming
to light in course of the trial or upon police or judicial enquiry may establish the necessity for
sanction. Thus, whether sanction is necessary or not may have to be determined at any stage of the
proceedings.
22. The understanding derived from examining Section 197 of Cr.PC and Section 170 of the
Karnataka Police Act along with the legal principle established by the Hon'ble Supreme Court
regarding the provisions contained in Section 197 of Cr.PC is summarized as follows:
i) According to Section 197 of Cr.PC, a sanction to prosecute is necessary when a
public servant's actions are within the scope of their official duties or exceed such
boundaries.
ii) If the action of the public servants is not within the scope of official duties or
exceeded scope of his official duties, the sanction to prosecute under Section 197 of
Cr.PC is not mandated.
iii) In cases where the charge sheet does not inherently establish that the action was
within the scope of official duties or beyond such limitation, the Trial Court after
evaluating the materials at any stage can halt the proceeding and direct the
prosecution to obtain sanction to prosecute to proceed further.
23. The term `excess of duties' as per Section 197 of Cr.PC, generally refers to action performed by a
public servant that exceeds the scope of his official duties.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/25176794/ 41
Sri N G Shastri vs Central Bureau Of Investigation on 29 November, 2023
24. Upon reviewing the contents of Section 197 of the Cr.PC, it is essential to consider the matter at
hand.
25. The examination of the charge sheets reveals the following:
- 52 -
NC: 2023:KHC:43558 CRL.P No. 977 of 2015 AND CONNECTED MATTERS Police
personnel were assigned for the production of the accused, Sri Janardhan Reddy, a
former Minister, before the CBI Court at the City Civil Court premises in Bengaluru
on December 3, 2012. The situation escalated when media personnel arrived,
triggering objections from some lawyers. Chaos ensued, leading to the imposition of
Section 144 of the Cr.PC by the Commissioner of Police around 10:45 a.m.
26. At approximately 10:45 a.m., Janardhan Reddy was presented before the Court, followed by his
shifting to Boring Hospital for a medical examination at 11:45 a.m. Subsequent clashes erupted
around the Court complex at 11:50 a.m., resulting in the Assistant Commissioner of Police ordering
a lathi charge to disperse the agitated advocates. By 12:00 noon, the Police Commissioner arrived
and ordered another lathi charge. At 12:15 p.m., while the Deputy Commissioner of Police was
attempting to calm the advocates, he was hit by a stone thrown by one of them, leading to his injury
and hospitalization. During this time, the deployed police personnel entered the Court premises,
allegedly assaulting advocates and causing damage to parked vehicles, actions that occurred
between 12:00 noon and 1:30 p.m. when they were providing security.
27. Recognizing the excessive use of force, the then Hon'ble Chief Justice directed the withdrawal of
police forces from the Court premises around 1:30 p.m. The then Inspector General of police
directed the then Police Commissioner to withdraw the forces from the Court premises and
accordingly, at about 1.30 p.m. the forces were moved out of the Court.
- 53 -
NC: 2023:KHC:43558 CRL.P No. 977 of 2015 AND CONNECTED MATTERS
28. Post 1.30 p.m. the investigation conducted by the CBI reveals as follows:
15.31. Investigation revealed that, Shri Ravikanthe Gowda ordered for lathi charge at
1.45 PM, on the ground that, advocates set ablaze a Police motorcycle and the Police
Outpost. This lathi charge lasted till 3 PM. As per the available Video, it is seen that,
there was no fire till close to 2 PM.
Hence, this lathi-charge is not justified. Investigation revealed that, at about 1.45 PM, the Police
persons who were kept as reserve at Mysore Bank Circle, Arts College ground entered the Court
premises and lathi charge was restored to as per the Instructions of Shri.Ravikanthe Gowda, DCP
North East who was the incharge of the bandhobust duty in place of Shri Ramesh, DCP central. As a

result, the advocates took shelter in their Association building, which is located behind the Police
Outpost. Another group of advocates ran towards southern side of the City Civil Court.
15.33. Investigation revealed that,
Sh.Mahabalishiora, S/o Late Sh.K.
Lakshminarayana Madiastha, a Xerox shop keeper in the northern side of the City Civil, adjacent to
Police Outpost has witnessed between 1:30 PM and 2:30 PM Police entering into Advocates'
Association building and breaking glasses and other articles.
15.34. The recordings of the incidents of 02.3.12 in the DVD collected from Commissioner Office
shows at 13.45.45 hours, a group of Policemen run towards the advocates in an aggressive mood
from gate No.2 to Police Outpost side and started lathi charge Indiscriminately, without any
warning, sound of lathi charge and screaming can be heard, but, the cameraman has focused the
camera towards advocates standing in different floors of the Court. It is also seen at 13:48:44 hours,
3 Policemen enter the shop in
- 54 -
NC: 2023:KHC:43558 CRL.P No. 977 of 2015 AND CONNECTED MATTERS front of Advocates'
Association building and assault advocates hiding inside the shop.
15.36. Thus, the investigation reveals that, the following Police Personnel, in furtherance of a
common intention, on 2.3.2012 while being deployed on bandobust duty in the City Civil Court
premises, between 1.45 PM and 3 PM, in the guise of mob dispersal, criminally assaulted the
advocates mentioned Para 15.29 and damaged vehicles shown in Para 15.30 and Advocates'
Association Building.
"Investigation revealed that between 2.45 PM and 3 PM Justice K.L.Manjunath
informed Shri Ravikanthe Gowda, DCP that advocates wanted to go out and they are
afraid of Police presence in the Mysore Bank Circle and directed Ravikanthe Gowda
to ensure safety of the advocates, who ever wanted to return to his house. Shri
Ravikanthe Gowda, passed instructions to officer Incharge of Mysore Bank Circle
Shri Siddarappa, DCP to withdraw the Police from that place. At that time some
advocates went out in the presence of the Hon'ble Justice Manjunath. After seeing
the advocates going out from Court premises Hon'ble Justice Manjunath left the
place."
29. The CBI investigation post-1:30 p.m., when the police personnel were withdrawn from the court
premises indicated that the police personnel, while on bandobast/ security duty engaged in criminal
acts under the pretext of dispersing a mob. The charge sheet materials also indicated that the
prohibitory order u/s 144 Crpc was also in force, and the police personnel were on security duty. The
Charge sheet material does not establish that the police personnel were not on security duty thereby
making them ineligible for protection under Section 197 Cr.PC.

- 55 -
NC: 2023:KHC:43558 CRL.P No. 977 of 2015 AND CONNECTED MATTERS
30. The charge sheet explicitly notes that the actions of the police personnel, committed during
security duty and under the guise of mob dispersal, were involved in criminal assaults on advocates,
damage to vehicles, and Court property. These actions, if proven, would indicate a breach beyond
the scope of their duties, thus potentially entitling them to the protection as mandated under
Section 197 of the Cr.PC and Section 170 of the Karnataka Police Act. Consequently, the
prosecution's initiation without the required sanction stands legally flawed.
31. Accordingly, I pass the following:
ORDER
i) Criminal petitions are allowed.
ii) The impugned order dated 5.1.2015 passed in CC No.348/2015 in RC No.9(S) and
RC No.10(S)/2013 of CBI/SCB/Chennai by the 17th Additional Chief Metropolitan
Magistrate, Bengaluru taking the cognizance of the aforesaid offences are hereby
quashed.
iii) The CBI to approach the learned Magistrate for taking cognizance in the event the
State Government grants sanction to prosecute in light of the order dated 29.11.2023
passed by this Court in W.P.No.2200/2016 c/w W.P.No.47539/2015.
