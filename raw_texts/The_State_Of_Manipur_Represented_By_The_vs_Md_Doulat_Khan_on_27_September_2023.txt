M.C.(WP(C)) No.319 of 2021 has been filed by the State to grant leave to publish the result of the
DPC held on 26.11.2021 for appointment by promotion from the post of Havildar to Jemadar in the
Manipur Police Department in view of the order dated 11.10.2021 of this Court passed in W.P.(C)
No.690 of 2021 coupled with a prayer to vacate/modify the said order dated 11.10.2021.

4. M.C.(WP(C)) No.376 of 2022 has been filed by the applicant NingthoujamKiranjit Singh to
implead him as fourth respondent in W.P.(C) No.625 of 2021.
5. Since all the four miscellaneous cases are interlinked with each other, they were heard together
and disposed of by this common order.
6. The State had filed M.C.(WP(C)) No.319 of 2021 to vacate the interim order dated 11.10.2021
passed in W.P.(C) No.690 of 2021 on the ground that the writ petitioners therein are aggrieved by
the Standing Order No.189 dated 15.4.2021 and its further amendments, which was issued in
relation to 15% (out-of- turn) category. According to the State, the prayer of the writ petitioners to
stall the entire process for promotion of 143 vacant MC(WP(C)) No. 319 of 2021 & MC(WP(C)) No.
57 of 2022 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 690 of 2021) and MC(WP(C)) No. 376 of 2022 & MC(WP(C)) No. 208
of 2023 (Ref:- WP(C)) No. 625 of 2021) Page |7 posts of Jemadars cannot be allowed. During the
pendency of the said writ petition, the Manipur Police Department submitted proceedings of Class
III DPC for promotion from Havildar to Jemadar held on 26.11.2021 along with relevant documents
to Home Department vide letter dated 27.11.2021 for filling up of 143 posts of Jemadar by
promotion from Havildar including 15% out-of-turn category. The non-filling up of the available
vacancies of different posts, including the above vacant posts of Jemadar in time has seriously
hampered the administration of policing in the present law and order situation in the State of
Manipur. The grievance of the writ petitioners is confined to 15% out-of-turn category as provided
under the Recruitment Rules of Jamedar and the grievance of the writ petitioners should not affect
the whole administration of policing in the State. If leave is not granted to publish the result of the
DPC held on 26.11.2021 for appointment by promotion from the post of Havildar to Jemadar, whose
cases were considered by the DPC, much hardship would be caused not only to the State, but also
the aggrieved persons.
7. Resisting M.C.(WP(C)) No.319 of 2021, the writ petitioners filed affidavit-in-opposition stating
that the writ petitioners had challenged the Standing Order No.189 dated 15.4.2021 and its
amendment, which is contrary to the Recruitment Rules of Jemadar. The writ petitioners claimed
that MC(WP(C)) No. 319 of 2021 & MC(WP(C)) No. 57 of 2022 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 690 of 2021) and
MC(WP(C)) No. 376 of 2022 & MC(WP(C)) No. 208 of 2023 (Ref:- WP(C)) No. 625 of 2021) Page |8
Recruitment Rules of Jemadar of Police, 2009 provides out-of-turn promotion quota of 15%. The
writ petitioners have no intention to stall the entire process of promotion of 143 vacant posts, as the
portion had already been declared except for 15% out-of-turn quota. The writ petitioners have
already submitted relevant documents of proceedings of the Class III DPC for promotion from
Havildar to Jemadar. As such continuation of the interim order is very much in need, as the
respondent authorities are ready to declare the promotion any moment thereby defeating the
legitimate claim of the writ petitioners. If this Court allowed to publish the result of the DPC held on
26.11.2021 for appointment by promotion from the post of Havildar to Jemadar in respect of 15%
out-of-turn quota during the pendency of the writ petition, the writ petitioners would be put to
irreparable loss and damage.

The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Md. Doulat Khan on 27 September, 2023
8. The third respondent in W.P.(C) No.690 of 2021 has filed M.C.(WP(C)) No.57 of 2022 praying to
vacate the interim order dated 11.10.2021 on the ground that the awards acquired by the writ
petitioners were never used in their service career for out-of-turn promotion. As such, it is in
violation of Article 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India and utter disregard to the gallant act of the
writ petitioners. Further, the writ petitioners have no locus standi to file the writ petition. They
aware of the existence of the Standing Order prior to the filing of the writ petition and the
MC(WP(C)) No. 319 of 2021 & MC(WP(C)) No. 57 of 2022 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 690 of 2021) and
MC(WP(C)) No. 376 of 2022 & MC(WP(C)) No. 208 of 2023 (Ref:- WP(C)) No. 625 of 2021) Page |9
same was not objected to by them before the competent authority till date. The third respondent
who has taken part in the said DPC for promotion to the next higher post of Jemadar has a right to
know about the result of the DPC. Therefore, it is necessary to vacate the interim order dated
11.10.2021 so that the second respondent to the extent declare the result of the DPC for the post of
Havildar to the next higher post of Jemadar under 15% out-of- turn category held on 26.11.2021
otherwise all the DPC faced candidates of the Police Department would suffer loss and injury.
9. The third respondent in W.P.(C) No.625 of 2021 has filed M.C.(WP(C)) No.208 of 2023 to vacate
the interim orders granted on the ground that the said writ petition has been filed to quash the
Standing Order No.189 dated 15.4.2021 as well as the DPC process for consideration of promotion to
the post of Jemadar from Havildar for the recruitment year 2012-2013 to 2019-2020 under 15%
out-of-turn category. The writ petitioners assailed the Standing Order inter alia on the ground that
under the Recruitment Rules for the rank of S.I., Jemadar, ASI, Havildar and Head Constable, there
is no provision of eligibility for out-of-turn promotion on considering Good Service Marks and that
Rule A and Sub Rule C(1)(d) of the Standing Order No.189 dated 15.4.2021 is null and void.
According to the third respondent, on 20.9.2021, this Court passed an interim order to the effect
that if DPC is MC(WP(C)) No. 319 of 2021 & MC(WP(C)) No. 57 of 2022 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 690 of
2021) and MC(WP(C)) No. 376 of 2022 & MC(WP(C)) No. 208 of 2023 (Ref:- WP(C)) No. 625 of
2021) P a g e | 10 conducted for promotion to the post of Jemadar, the result of the DPC shall not be
published without the leave of the Court. Aggrieved by the said order, the State had filed
M.C.(WP(C)) No.318 of 2021 for vacation of the interim order dated 20.9.2021. On 29.12.2021, after
considering the arguments of the respective counsel, this Court modified the order thereby allowing
the authorities to announce the result of the said DPC in respect of general category i.e. for
promotion against 85% quota provided under the Recruitment Rules. However, the authorities were
restrained from announcing the result of the DPC in respect of promotion against 15% quota for
out-of-turn promotion without the leave of the Court.
10. It is stated by the third respondent that the writ petitioners have sought staying the declaration
of the DPC for promotion to the post of Jemadar only on the apprehension that the writ petitioners
will not be recommended for promotion to the post of Jemadar by the DPC held on the basis of the
Standing Order No.189. It is an undisputed fact that the DPC for promotion to the post of Jemadar
has been held and the result of the DPC in respect of 15% out-of-turn promotion quota is yet to be
declared thereby giving cause of action to claim for stay of the DPC proceedings. Therefore, the
order dated 29.12.2021 passed in M.C.(WP(C)) No.318 of 2021 restraining the authorities from
MC(WP(C)) No. 319 of 2021 & MC(WP(C)) No. 57 of 2022 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 690 of 2021) and
MC(WP(C)) No. 376 of 2022 & MC(WP(C)) No. 208 of 2023 (Ref:- WP(C)) No. 625 of 2021) P a g e |
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164032115/ 6
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Md. Doulat Khan on 27 September, 2023
11 declaring the result of the DPC for promotion under the out-of- turn quota is liable to the vacated.
11. According to the third respondent, under the Recruitment Rules for the post of Jemadar, the
Director General of Police has power to recommend persons under the 15% out-of- turn promotion
quota. Since the writ petitioners have not challenged the powers of the Director General of Police,
they cannot challenge the Standing Order issued to regulate the recommendation by the Director
General of Police. A conjoint reading of Rule 43 and Rule 44 of Assam Police Manual Part- IIIwould
imply that a candidate who has been awarded Good Service Marks with the approval of the Director
General of Police can be considered under the 15% out-of-turn quota. Therefore, there is nothing
wrong with the Standing Order under challenge in the writ petition as well as the DPC held in terms
of the Standing Order.
12. The case of the third respondent is that pursuant to the interim order dated 29.12.2021, result of
the DPC was declared in respect of the general quota and eligible Havildars who have been
recommended under 85% general quota and were given appointment followed by issuance of
posting order.While so, despite the fact that the third respondent's case has also been MC(WP(C))
No. 319 of 2021 & MC(WP(C)) No. 57 of 2022 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 690 of 2021) and MC(WP(C)) No.
376 of 2022 & MC(WP(C)) No. 208 of 2023 (Ref:- WP(C)) No. 625 of 2021) P a g e | 12 considered
by the same DPC has been subjected to a situation where he is not in a position to ascertain as to
whether he was recommended by the said DPC for promotion to the post of Jemadar or otherwise
and also for enjoying the benefit of such promotion like other eligible candidates who have now
given promotion on the basis of recommendation made by the same DPC. Therefore, a sense of
discrimination and deprivation of right for promotion has been instilled upon the third respondent
for no fault and has been deprived of the right of promotion to higher post.
13. Resisting the prayer made in M.C.(WP(C))No.208 of 2023, the writ petitioners inter alia stated
that the order dated 29.12.2021 passed in MC No.318 of 2021 is a consequential order of earlier
interim order dated 20.9.2021 passed in the writ petition when the third respondent is not a party
respondent. The modification/alteration of earlier interim order dated 20.9.2021 passed in the same
writ petition, the third respondent is not a party. Therefore, the order dated 29.12.2022 passed in
MC No.318 of 2021 cannot be considered as ex parte interim order. It is stated that there is no
provision of eligibility of out-of-turn promotion on considering the Good Service Marks in respect of
all ranks stated under Rule A except for the rank of Inspector of Police in the relevant Recruitment
Rules. Therefore, Rule A and MC(WP(C)) No. 319 of 2021 & MC(WP(C)) No. 57 of 2022 (Ref:-
WP(C) No. 690 of 2021) and MC(WP(C)) No. 376 of 2022 & MC(WP(C)) No. 208 of 2023 (Ref:-
WP(C)) No. 625 of 2021) P a g e | 13 Sub Rule C(1)(d) in the Standing Order No.189 dated 15.4.2021
insofar as Good Service Marks is concerned, the same cannot stand in the eyes of law. The third
respondent has filed the MC No.208 of 2023 after a gap of almost 2 years from the date of passing
the interim orders that too after exchange of pleadings. The third respondent with ulterior motives,
vested interest to dismantle the entire judicial process, approached this Court with dirty hands and
minds and endeavor to deprive the fundamental and legal rights of the writ petitioners in
considering promotion to the post of Jemadar from Havildars for the recruitment year 2012- 2013
to 2019-2020 under 15% out-of-turn quota. According to the writ petitioners, it is necessary to
restrain the State respondents from declaring the result of the DPC in respect of 15% out-of-turn

The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Md. Doulat Khan on 27 September, 2023
quota promotion in view of the fact that while passing the interim order dated 20.9.2021 in W.P.(C)
No.625 of 2021 and its consequential order dated 29.12.2021 passed in M.C. (WP(C)) No.318 of
2021, this Court had appreciated the case of the writ petitioners and after fully considering the
balance of convenience and on seeing irreparable injury to the writ petitioners. As there is no
provision of eligibility for out-of-turn promotion on considering Good Service Marks in respect of all
ranks in the relevant Recruitment Rules, there is no necessity to vacate the interim orders passed in
the said writ petition. MC(WP(C)) No. 319 of 2021 & MC(WP(C)) No. 57 of 2022 (Ref:- WP(C) No.
690 of 2021) and MC(WP(C)) No. 376 of 2022 & MC(WP(C)) No. 208 of 2023 (Ref:- WP(C)) No.
625 of 2021) P a g e | 14
14. M.C.(WP(C)) No.376 of 2022 in W.P.(C) No.625 of 2021 has been filed by one
NinghoujamKiranjit Singh to implead him as fourth respondent in the writ petition stating that he
and the original writ petitioners were eligible candidates for consideration of promotion to the next
higher post of Jemadar under 15% out-of-turn quota as provided under the Recruitment Rules and
the connected Standing Orders have already faced a duly constituted regular DPC. The applicant
who had already participated the aforesaid DPC for promotion from the post of Havildar to Jemadar
under 15% out-of-turn quota has been affected and prejudiced by the ex parte interim order thereby
the result of the said DPC could not be declared. Since the applicant who is already affected by the ex
parte interim order and is more likely to be affected by any final adverse order is desirous of being
impleaded as respondent No.4 in W.P.(C) No.625 of 2021 so as to enable him to contest the claims
and contentions of the writ petitioners besides protecting his vested right to know the result of the
DPC.
15. Mr. S. Niranjan, learned Government Advocate submitted that pursuant to the interim order
dated 11.10.2021 passed in the writ petitions, the authorities have been restrained from publishing
the result of the DPC held on 26.11.2021 for promotion to the post of Jemadar in Manipur Police
Department MC(WP(C)) No. 319 of 2021 & MC(WP(C)) No. 57 of 2022 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 690 of
2021) and MC(WP(C)) No. 376 of 2022 & MC(WP(C)) No. 208 of 2023 (Ref:- WP(C)) No. 625 of
2021) P a g e | 15 (M.R) under 15% out-of-turn promotion without the leave of the Court. The
learned Government Advocate argued that the Manipur Police Department has submitted the
proceedings of Class III DPC for promotion to the post of Jemadarfrom Havildar to the Home
Department for filling up of 143 posts of Jemadars by promotion including 15% out-of-turn quota.
The non-filling up of the available vacancies of different ranks including the vacant posts of Jemadar
in Manipur Police Department is hampering the administration in the law and order in the State of
Manipur. Therefore, leave may be granted to the State to publish the result of the DPC held on
26.11.2021 for appointment by promotion to the post of Jemadar by vacating the interim order
dated 11.10.2021.
16. The learned counsel appearing for the third respondent in W.P.(C) No.690 of 2021 submitted
that the third respondent who has taken part in the DPC for promotion to the next higher post of
Jemadar under 15% out-of-turn quota has a right to know about the result of the DPC. Therefore, it
would be in the interest of justice that this Court may pass an order vacating the interim order dated
11.10.2021 so as to enable the Director General of Police to declare the result of the DPC for the post
of Havildar to the next post of Jemadar under 15% out-of- turn quota held on 26.11.2021. If the

result of the DPC is not MC(WP(C)) No. 319 of 2021 & MC(WP(C)) No. 57 of 2022 (Ref:- WP(C) No.
690 of 2021) and MC(WP(C)) No. 376 of 2022 & MC(WP(C)) No. 208 of 2023 (Ref:- WP(C)) No.
625 of 2021) P a g e | 16 published, all the DPC faced candidates namely the Havildars would put to
irreparable loss and injury, which cannot be compensated by any amount.
17. Similarly, Mr. HS Paonam, learned senior counsel for the third respondent in W.P.(C) No.625 of
2021 submitted that on 20.9.2021, this Court had passed an interim order to the effect that if the
DPC is conducted for promotion to the post of Jemadar, the result of the DPC shall not be published
without the leave of the Court. Aggrieved by the said interim order, the State had filed M.C.No.318
of 2021 for vacation of the said interim order dated 20.9.2021. This Court, vide order dated
29.12.2021, allowed the State to declare the result of the DPC for promotion to the post of Jemadar
held on 26.11.2021 in respect of general category and at the same time, the authorities were
restrained from announcing the result of the DPC in respect of promotion against 15% out-of- turn
quota without the leave of the Court. Since the said order is causing the injustice to the third
respondent and others, the learned counsel prayed for vacation of the interim order dated 20.9.2021
passed in W.P.(C) No.625 of 2021and the order dated 29.12.2021 passed in M.C.(WP(C)) No.318 of
2021.
18. Per contra, the learned senior counsel for the writ petitioners submittedthat there is no provision
of eligibility of out- MC(WP(C)) No. 319 of 2021 & MC(WP(C)) No. 57 of 2022 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 690
of 2021) and MC(WP(C)) No. 376 of 2022 & MC(WP(C)) No. 208 of 2023 (Ref:- WP(C)) No. 625 of
2021) P a g e | 17 of-turn promotion on considering the Good Service Marks in respect of all ranks
stated under Rule A, except for the rank of Inspector of Police in the relevant Recruitment Rules.
Therefore, Rule A and Sub Rule C(1)(d) in the Standing Order No.189 dated 15.4.2021 insofar as
Good Service Marks cannot stand and go together.
19. The learned senior counsel submitted that the writ petitioners have no intension to stall the
entire process of promotion of 143 vacant posts, as portion of the vacant posts had already been
declared, except for the 15% out-of-turn quota. According to the learned senior counsel, the State
officials cannot go against the relevant Recruitment Rules and the existing law. If the result of the
DPC held on 26.11.2021 for appointment by promotion to the post ofJemadar in respect of 15%
out-of-turn quota during the pendency of the writ petitions is declared, the writ petitioners would be
put to irreparable loss and damages.
20. The learned senior counsel for the writ petitioners in W.P.(C) No.625 of 2021 added that the
third respondent in the said writ petition has filed MC(WP(C)) No.208 of 2023 after a gap of almost
2 years from the date of passing the interim orders that too after exchange of pleadings. The third
respondent with MC(WP(C)) No. 319 of 2021 & MC(WP(C)) No. 57 of 2022 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 690 of
2021) and MC(WP(C)) No. 376 of 2022 & MC(WP(C)) No. 208 of 2023 (Ref:- WP(C)) No. 625 of
2021) P a g e | 18 ulterior motives, vested interest to dismantle the entire judicial process,
approached this Court with unclean hands and endeavor to deprive the fundamental and legal rights
of the petitioners in considering promotion to the post of Jemadar from Havildar for the
recruitment year 2012-2013 to 2019-2020 under 15% out-of- turn quota.

The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Md. Doulat Khan on 27 September, 2023
21. The learned senior counsel further submitted that it is necessary to restrain the State
respondents from declaring the result of the DPC in respect of 15% out-of-turn quota promotion in
view of the fact that while passing the interim order dated 20.9.2021 in W.P.(C) No.625 of 2021 and
its consequential order dated 29.12.2021 passed in M.C. (WP(C)) No.318 of 2021, this Court
appreciated the case of the writ petitioners.Only after considering the balance of convenience and on
seeing irreparable injury to the writ petitioners, this Court passed the aforesaid interim orders. As
there is no provision of eligibility for out-of-turn promotion on considering Good Service Marks in
respect of all ranks in the relevant Recruitment Rules, there is no necessity to vacate the interim
orders. Thus, prayed for dismissal of the miscellaneous cases for vacating the interim orders.
22. This Court considered the rival submissions and also perused the materials available on record.
MC(WP(C)) No. 319 of 2021 & MC(WP(C)) No. 57 of 2022 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 690 of 2021) and

23. W.P.(C) No.690 of 2021 has been filed by six petitioners to quash the (i) Standing Order No.189
dated 15.4.2021; (ii) Standing Order No.189 (1st Amendment) dated 23.8.2021; (iii) Standing Order
No.189 (2nd Amendment) dated 1.9.2021 issued by the Director General of Police and to set aside
the impugned DPC proceedings for consideration of out-of-turn promotion to the post of Jemadar
from Havildar and to direct the respondents to give preference to the personnel who have been
awarded the police medal for gallantry by His Excellency, the President of India over those
personnel who have been given other gallantry awards and to exclude the Good Service Marks as per
the Recruitment Rules.
24. When the said writ petition is taken up for admission on 11.10.2021, this Court passed the
following interim order:
"Heard Mr.A.Mohendro, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners.
Issue notice, returnable within 4 (four) weeks. Mr.H.Samarjit, learned Government Advocate
accepts notice on behalf of all the respondents, hence no formal notice is called for.

in Manipur Police Department (M.R), the result of such DPC in respect of the promotion under the
15 (fifteen) percent out of turn promotion should not be announced without the leave of the Court."
25. W.P.(C) No.625 of 2021 has been filed by two petitioners to quash the very same Standing Order
No.189 dated 15.4.2021 as well as the DPC proceedings for consideration of promotion to the post of
Jemadar from Havildar for recruitment 2012-2013 to 2019-2020 under 15% out-of-quota.

26. On 20.9.2021, when the said writ petition was taken up for admission, this Court passed the

Therefore, Mr. Shyam Sharma, learned GA for the respondent Nos.1 & 2 is directed to file

27. In W.P.(C) No.625 of 2021, the State had filed M.C.(WP(C)) No.318 of 2021 to vacate the interim
order dated 20.9.2021. By the order dated 29.12.2021, this Court disposed of MC(WP(C)) No. 319 of
2021 & MC(WP(C)) No. 57 of 2022 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 690 of 2021) and MC(WP(C)) No. 376 of 2022
& MC(WP(C)) No. 208 of 2023 (Ref:- WP(C)) No. 625 of 2021) P a g e | 22 M.C.(WP(C)) No.318 of
2021. The order dated 29.12.2021 reads thus:
"Heard Mr. NiranjanSanasam, learned GA appearing for the applicants and Mr.
M.Hemachandra, learned senior counsel for the respondents/writ petitioners.
The only submission advanced by the learned GA appearing for the applicants is that
by an order dated 20.09.2021 passed in the connected WP(C) No.625 of 2021, the
authorities have been restrained from publishing the result of the DPC held on
26.11.2021 for promotion to the post of Jamadar (MR/IRB) without leave of this
Court. The applicants are seeking leave of this Court through this application for
allowing them to declare the result of the said DPC in respect of the General Category
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164032115/ 11
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Md. Doulat Khan on 27 September, 2023
only, i.e., 85% quota provided under relevant Recruitment Rules as the election code
of conduct is knocking at the door. It has also been submitted by the learned GA that
no prejudice will be caused to the applicants as their grievance is restricted in respect
of promotion against the 15% out of turn promotion quota provided under the RR.
MC(WP(C)) No. 319 of 2021 & MC(WP(C)) No. 57 of 2022 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 690 of
2021) and MC(WP(C)) No. 376 of 2022 & MC(WP(C)) No. 208 of 2023 (Ref:- WP(C))
No. 625 of 2021) P a g e | 23 Mr.M.Hemachandra, learned senior counsel vehemently
objected to the submission advanced by the GA on the ground that such prayer made
by the GA is contrary to the pleading made by the applicants as well as the prayer
made in the present application. However, the learned senior counsel fairly conceded
that the dispute raised in the connected writ petition confines to the promotion
against 15% quota for out of turn promotion.
After hearing the argument of the learned counsel appearing for the parties, this
Court is of the considered view that interest of justice will be served by allowing the
authorities to announce the result of the said DPC in respect of the General Category,
i.e., for promotion against 85% quota as provided under the RR. It is hereby also
made clear that the authorities should not announce the result of the said DPC in
respect of promotion against 15% quota for out of turn promotion as provided under
the RR without leave of this Court.
With the aforesaid direction, the application is disposed of."
28. Now the State as well as the private respondents in the respective writ petitions contend that the
grievance of the writ petitioners should not affect the whole administration in the Police MC(WP(C))
No. 319 of 2021 & MC(WP(C)) No. 57 of 2022 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 690 of 2021) and MC(WP(C)) No.
376 of 2022 & MC(WP(C)) No. 208 of 2023 (Ref:- WP(C)) No. 625 of 2021) P a g e | 24 Department
in the State of Manipur. Though the result of DPC was declared in respect of the general quota and
eligible Havildars who have been recommended under the 85% quota were given appointment and
thereafter posting orders were issued, the private respondents whose case has also been considered
by the same DPC have been subjected to a situation where they are not in a position to ascertain as
to whether they have been recommended by the DPC for promotion to the post of Jemadar or
otherwise and also for enjoying the benefit of such promotion like the other eligible candidates who
have now given promotion on the basis of the recommendation made by the same DPC.
29. Elaborating further, the State contends that in order to streamline the existing system of
out-of-turn promotion in respect of police personnel in the Manipur Police Department, revised
guidelines approved by the Home Department was issued by the Director General of Police being
Standing Order No.189 dated 15.4.2021. The Standing Order clearly mentions the provisions of
applicability, eligibility and calculation of vacancy, methodology of awarding marks, period of
achievements, personnel facing departmental enquiries, interpretation and relaxation. The Standing
Order dated 15.4.2021 is applicable to all the posts where out-of-turn promotion category is clearly
mentioned in the respective Recruitment Rules. The Standing MC(WP(C)) No. 319 of 2021 &
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164032115/ 12
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Md. Doulat Khan on 27 September, 2023
MC(WP(C)) No. 57 of 2022 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 690 of 2021) and MC(WP(C)) No. 376 of 2022 &
MC(WP(C)) No. 208 of 2023 (Ref:- WP(C)) No. 625 of 2021) P a g e | 25 Order has been amended
twice with the approval of the Home Department. The Standing Order allow all the eligible
Havildars to be considered for promotion to the rank of Jemadars under out- of-turn quota without
restricting the normal zone of consideration. In the absence of the Standing Order, the writ
petitioners would not be eligible to be considered for promotion under out-of-turn quota, as they are
not within the normal zone of consideration.
30. The State further contends that even though the writ petitioners are gallantry awardees and have
not utilized the said gallantry awards for promotion under out-of-turn quota, these gallantry awards
cannot be used for promotion to Jemadar under out-of-turn quota as the said awards are not the
achievements while serving in the feeder post i.e. Havildar. The Standing Order and its amendments
are within the ambit of the Recruitment Rules and have not altered the Recruitment Rules. Prior to
the Standing Order, there was no specific guidelines to assess the grading of achievements of police
personnel for promotion under the out-of- turn category,whereas the DPC could devise its own
method and procedure for objective assessment of the suitability of the candidates and the Standing
Order No.189 will aid in the assessment. The DPC can make its own independent assessment and
the subsequent amendments were issued to remove the MC(WP(C)) No. 319 of 2021 & MC(WP(C))
No. 57 of 2022 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 690 of 2021) and MC(WP(C)) No. 376 of 2022 & MC(WP(C)) No.
208 of 2023 (Ref:- WP(C)) No. 625 of 2021) P a g e | 26 confusion that has arisen amongst the
eligible and deserving out- of-turn candidates and also to avoid multiplicity of litigation.
31. There is no dispute that under the Recruitment Rules, the Director General of Police has the
power to recommend persons under 15% out-of-turn quota for the post of Jamadar. Out-of-turn
means police personnel has done something remarkably good. Out-of-turn promotion is permissible
to encourage the police personnel to perform better in service and the same cannot be granted in
breach of the rules governing out- of-turn promotion.
32. Admittedly, the writ petitioners have not challenged the power of the Director General of Police.
Prima facie, as the writ petitioners have not challenged the power of the Director General of Police
under the Recruitment Rules, the writ petitioners cannot challenge the Standing Order issued to
regular the recommendation by the Director General of Police. Therefore, as rightly argued by the
learned counsel for the private respondents, unless the power of the Director General of Police is
curtailed by a competent authority, the Director General of Police has the authority to recommend
candidate in terms of the Standing Order. Though the aforesaid observation of this Court would
touch upon the very root of the writ petitions, taking into consideration the MC(WP(C)) No. 319 of
2021 & MC(WP(C)) No. 57 of 2022 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 690 of 2021) and MC(WP(C)) No. 376 of 2022
& MC(WP(C)) No. 208 of 2023 (Ref:- WP(C)) No. 625 of 2021) P a g e | 27 plea raised by the
respective parties on the merits of the Standing Order and power of the Director General of Police,
this Court has arrived at such finding.
33. As could be seen from the records, in terms of the same Standing Order, the DPC was held in
promotion to the post of Sub-Inspector of Police from Assistant Sub-Inspector of Police and they
have been given promotion without any interference from any corner.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164032115/ 13
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Md. Doulat Khan on 27 September, 2023
34. At this juncture, the learned counsel for the private respondents submitted that in respect of
MR/IRB, due to the interim orders of this Court, the candidates under the out-of-turn quota have
been deprived of the right to promotion. This not only shows deprivation, but also the private
respondents and similarly situated candidates have to salute their junior counterparts serving in the
Police Department. This Court finds some force in the said submission made by the learned counsel
for the private respondents.
35. As rightly argued by the learned counsel for the private respondents, the private respondentsare
not in a position to ascertain as to whether they have been recommended by the said DPC for
promotion to the post of Jemadar or otherwise. A sense of discrimination and deprivation of the
right for promotion MC(WP(C)) No. 319 of 2021 & MC(WP(C)) No. 57 of 2022 (Ref:- WP(C) No.
690 of 2021) and MC(WP(C)) No. 376 of 2022 & MC(WP(C)) No. 208 of 2023 (Ref:- WP(C)) No.
625 of 2021) P a g e | 28 has been instilled upon the private respondents for no fault and they have
been deprived of the right of promotion to the higher post, inasmuch as they have not even know
whether they have been recommended or not. Except the writ petitioners herein, others have not
questioned and/or challenged the Standing Order dated 15.4.2021 and its amendments and also the
DPC proceedings for consideration of out-of-turn promotion to the post of Jemadar from Havildar.
Therefore, as rightly argued by learned Government Advocate only because of the writ petitioners,
the whole administration of policing in the State should not affect.
36. As the State and the private respondents have prima facie proved that withholding of the result
of the DPC in respect of promotion against 15% quota for out-of-turn promotion is not only
hampering the administration of the Police Department, but also the private respondents who have
taken part in the said DPC for promotion to the next higher post of Jemadar have right to know
about the result of the DPC.
37. The learned senior counsel for the writ petitioners submitted that since exchange of pleadings in
the writ petitions are completed and awaits final hearing for disposal, it is prudent to hold the result
of the DPC held on 26.11.2021 in respect of 15% out-of-turn quota promotion to the post of Jemadar
in view MC(WP(C)) No. 319 of 2021 & MC(WP(C)) No. 57 of 2022 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 690 of 2021)
and MC(WP(C)) No. 376 of 2022 & MC(WP(C)) No. 208 of 2023 (Ref:- WP(C)) No. 625 of 2021) P a
g e | 29 of the interim orders passed in the writ petitions till the final adjudication of the cases.
According to the learned senior counsel, the result of the DPC held on 26.11.2021 for appointment
by promotion from the post of Havildar to Jemadarin respect of 15% out-of-turn quota should not
be declared till the final disposal of the case. The aforesaid argument cannot be countenanced.
38. In view of the findings arrived at by this Court in the preceding paragraph that withholding of
the result of the DPC in respect of promotion against 15% out-of-turn quota is hampering the
administration and also causing hardship to the private respondents, the arguments of the learned
senior counsel to hold the result of the DPC in respect of 15% out-of-turn quota promotion to the
post of Jemadar cannot be accepted.
39. It is pertinent to note that by submitting their required documents for consideration for
promotion under out-of- turn promotion quota in spite of having knowledge about the condition
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/164032115/ 14
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Md. Doulat Khan on 27 September, 2023
provided in the Standing Order, the writ petitioners have waived their right to challenge the
Standing Order as well as the DPC held on the basis of the impugned Standing Order. If really the
writ petitioners have aggrieved by the Standing Order, they should not have submitted their
documents for consideration under out-of-turn promotion category. Prima facie, by submitting
MC(WP(C)) No. 319 of 2021 & MC(WP(C)) No. 57 of 2022 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 690 of 2021) and
MC(WP(C)) No. 376 of 2022 & MC(WP(C)) No. 208 of 2023 (Ref:- WP(C)) No. 625 of 2021) P a g e |
30 their documents for consideration under out-of-turn promotion quota, the writ petitioners have
given up their right to challenge the Standing Order.
40. In the facts and circumstances stated supra, this Court is of the prima facie view that there is no
need for restraining the State from declaring the result of the DPC in respect of 15% out-of-turn
promotion category. Due to the interim orders, the candidates under the out-of-turn quota cannot
be deprived of. The interest of justice warrants to vacate the interim order dated 11.10.2021 passed
in W.P.(C) No.690 of 2021 and the interim order dated 20.9.2021 passed in W.P.(C) No.625 of 2021
and the order dated 29.12.2021 passed in MC(WP(C)) No.318 of 2021 in W.P.(C) No.625 of 2021.
41. As far as M.C.(WP(C)) No.376 of 2022 in W.P.(C) No.625 of 2021 is concerned, the learned
counsel for the applicant submitted that the applicant Ningthoujam Kiranjit Singh was aspirant for
consideration of promotion to the next higher post of Jemadar under 15% out-of-turn quota as
provided under the relevant Recruitment Rules. Since the applicant Ningthoujam Kiranjit Singh has
already participated in the DPC for promotion from the post of Havildar to Jemadar under 15%
out-of-turn quota and the interim orders passed in the writ petition are gravely MC(WP(C)) No. 319
of 2021 & MC(WP(C)) No. 57 of 2022 (Ref:- WP(C) No. 690 of 2021) and MC(WP(C)) No. 376 of
2022 & MC(WP(C)) No. 208 of 2023 (Ref:- WP(C)) No. 625 of 2021) P a g e | 31 affected him, the
applicant is in desirous to be impleaded as respondent No.4 in W.P.(C) No.625 of 2021.
The applicant Ningthoujam Kiranjit Singh also sought to implead on the ground of protecting his
vested right to know the result of the DPC.
42. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and the fact remains that the applicant
Ningthoujam Kiranjit Singh was aspirant for consideration of promotion to the next higher post of
Jemadar under 15% out-of-turn quota, this Court is of the view that it is just and fair to implead the
applicant Ningthoujam Kiranjit Singh as fourth respondent in W.P.(C) No.625 of 2021. If the
applicant Ningthoujam Kiranjit Singh is impleaded as party respondent in the writ petition, no
prejudice would be caused to the writ petitioners. Therefore, for proper adjudication of the writ
petition, the applicant Ningthoujam Kiranjit Singh is ordered to be impleaded as fourth respondent
in the writ petition.
43. In the result:
(i) MC(WP(C)) Nos.319 of 2021 and 57 of 2022 in W.P.(C) No.690 of 2021 and MC
(WP(C)) No.208 of 2023 in W.P.(C) No.625 of 2021 are allowed.
