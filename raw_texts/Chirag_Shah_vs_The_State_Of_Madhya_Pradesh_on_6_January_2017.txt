ORDER
THIS order shall also govern the disposal of Misc. Criminal Case Nos.12677 and 12102 of 2016 and
Misc. Criminal Case No.73 of 2017.
Misc. Criminal Case Nos.12677 and 12102 of 2016 are first bail applications; whereas Misc. Criminal
Case No.73 of 2017 is a repeat (second) bail application under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C for grant of
bail in connection with Crime No.13/2016 registered at Police Station Crime Branch, Indore, District
Indore for the offence punishable under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471 and 120-B of the IPC.
Complainant Usha Jain submitted a written complaint to DIG, Indore that Directors of Phoenix
Devcon Private Limited had sold a plot No.1868 by registered sale deed after receiving entire sale
consideration. However, they have not handed over the possession of the plot after her repeated
demand. Subsequently it was disclosed that the Directors of the company got a false Certificate of
development of land from the Town and Country Planning Department and in the sale deed it is
falsely mentioned that a developed plot has been sold to the complainant. Thus, the Directors of the
said company have cheated the complainant on the basis of forged documents. On this basis
aforesaid offence has been registered and investigation was conducted.

It was found that the Directors of the company have got sanctioned map for 100 acres of land,
however, they have purchased only 50 acres of land. On the basis of forged sanctioned map and
without development of the land the Directors have sold the plots to 2,440 persons, however, as per
sanctioned map there are only 2,303 plots, thus, it is apparent that the Directors have sold one plot
to more than one person by registered sale deed. Thus, cheated many persons and collected huge
amount. It is also disclosed that as per rules they have mortgaged 25% plots to the SDO as a security
that they would develop the land in time, however, without development they got released
mortgaged plots, for this purpose they have submitted letters contained forged signatures of
agriculturists. Hence, the Directors have hatched conspiracy and committed the offence of cheating
and forgery.
Learned Senior Counsel for the applicant - Chirag Shah submits that the applicant was Director of
the Company for a short period i.e. from 30.09.2008 to 12.09.2012. Thereafter he has resigned from
the Directorship and he was not connected in any manner with the affairs of the Company. As per
the prosecution case, some land has been purchased from the agriculturists through the applicant.
Except this, there is no evidence against the applicant. The applicant has not received any money
from any plot holder and cheated any body. Complainant Usha Jain filed a petition before this Court
for withdrawal of the FIR. The Company had already given a plot to her and possession has also
been delivered. The applicant is detained since 26.06.2016; whereas the trial will take time to
conclude. In view of the judgment of Hon'ble apex Court in the case of Sanjay Chandra v/s Central
Bureau of Investigation, reported in (2012) 1 SCC 40, there is no purpose to detain the applicant in
jail. In such circumstances, he be released on bail.
Learned counsel for the applicant - Nikul Kapasi submits that the applicant was Director of Phoenix
Devcon Pvt. Ltd. for a short period i.e. from 02.02.2013 to 06.04.2013. During that period he has
not committed any forgery, cheating or hatched any conspiracy with other co- accused persons. He
has been implicated in this case only on the ground that he was Director for some time in the
Company. He is detained since 26.06.2016; whereas the trial will take time to conclude. In such
circumstances, he be released on bail.
Learned counsel for the applicant - Shabbir submits that the earlier application has been dismissed
vide order dated 03.11.2016. However, it is not considered that the applicant was never served in
Phoenix Devcon Pvt. Ltd. He was an employee of Mayuri Herbal Care Pvt. Ltd. [Heena Mehandi
Company]. He is not connected with the affairs of Phoenix Devcon Pvt. Ltd. There is no evidence
against the applicant to connect him with the crime. He is detained since 29.07.2016; whereas the
trial will take time to conclude. In such circumstances, he be released on bail.
On the other hand, learned Panel Lawyer vehemently opposes the prayer and submits that
admittedly applicant Chirag Shah was the Director of Phoenix Devcon Pvt. Ltd. since 30.09.2008 to
12.09.2012 and applicant Nikul Kapasi was the Director since 20.02.2012 to 06.04.2013. They have
played active role in committing forgery and cheating. The applicants along with the other
co-accused hatched a conspiracy and on the basis of forged documents, they have cheated many
persons and collected huge money. It is further submitted that so far as the application of applicant
Shabbir is concerned, at the disclosure statement of the applicant, forged sale-deeds have been

recovered. He also referred the statement of witness Manish Kediya recorded under Section 164 of
Cr.P.C. Hence, it cannot be said that the applicant is not involved with the crime. His first
application has been dismissed on 03.11.2016 and thereafter there is no change in the
circumstances. It is further submitted that if the applicants be released on bail, they will tamper the
evidence and may be absconded. He, therefore, prays for dismissal of the applications.
After hearing learned counsel for the parties, I have gone through the final report.
Phoenix Devcon Pvt. Ltd. was incorporated in the year 2007 for development of residential colony.
Applicant Chirag Shah, Pawan Ajmera, Ritesh, Nilesh, Yogita, Sonali and some others are the
Directors of the Company. Admittedly applicant Chirag Shah was the Director of the Company since
30.09.2008 to 12.09.2012 and applicant Nikul Kapasai was the Director of the Company from
20.02.2013 to 06.04.2013. The Directors of the Company have allured the public at large that they
will sold them developed plot in a very reasonable price and on this pretext, on the basis of forged
sale-deeds and maps they have collected the huge amount. However, they know from the very
inception that they cannot give the developed plots to them.
It is apparent from the final report that the Directors of the Company have cheated 2440 persons
and collected huge amount.
In such circumstances, I am of the view that it is not in the interest of society to release the
applicants on bail. Thus, the bail applications are hereby dismissed.
