Patna High Court C.Misc. No.584 of 2025 dt.14-10-2025
2/23
CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE ARUN KUMAR JHA
CAV JUDGMENT
Date :14-10-2025
The present civil miscellaneous petition has been filed
by the petitioners for setting aside the order dated 05.03.2025
passed by the learned Sub Judge-1st, Naugachhia in Title
Execution Case No. 02 of 2006, whereby and whereunder the
learned executing court held that the said execution case has
been filed within the statutory period of 12 years.
02. Briefly stated, facts of the case are that the
respondents 1st set are the decree holders and petitioners and
respondents 2nd set are the descendants of the original judgment
debtors. The respondents 1st set filed Title Suit No. 100 of 1982
for a decree of specific performance against the defendants of
that suit for enforcement for an agreement for sale for executing
a sale deed after payment of remaining amount of consideration
money. The said suit was decreed on 24.05.1991 with a
direction to the respondents 1st set to get the sale deed executed
within a period of 60 days. Pursuant thereto, the
plaintiffs/decree holders/respondents 1st set got the sale deed
executed after depositing the consideration money on
20.07.1991
. The petitioners thereafter filed a miscellaneous case under Order 9 Rule 13 of the Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908 (for short 'the Code) against the said decree vide Misc. Case No. 02 Patna High
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198547931/ 2
Manoj Kumar vs Krishna Mohan Kumar on 14 October, 2025
Court C.Misc. No.584 of 2025 dt.14-10-2025 of 1992, which was dismissed on 25.06.1993. Against
the said order of dismissal, the petitioners then preferred a miscellaneous appeal bearing Misc.
Appeal No. 16 of 1993, which was dismissed for non-prosecution on 11.10.1996. For execution of
decree of Title Suit No. 100 of 1992, the decree holders filed execution case in the year 2006 bearing
Execution Case No. 02 of 2006 for executing the said decree and declaration of decree of possession.
The petitioners who are the judgment debtors appeared in the said case and filed an objection
challenging the maintainability of the said case. Besides other grounds, question of limitation was
also raised regarding maintainability of execution case on 24.04.2024 by the petitioners. The
learned executing court, after hearing the parties, vide order dated 05.03.2025, rejected the
objection of the petitioners and the said order is under challenge before this Court.
03. Learned senior counsel, Mr. J. S. Arora, appearing on behalf of the petitioners submitted that
the impugned order is bad in the eyes of law and suffers from manifest illegality. The learned
executing court has not considered that the execution case was filed after 15 years of passing of the
decree and statutory period of limitation being 12 years, on face of it, the execution case, is
hopelessly barred by limitation. Therefore, the Patna High Court C.Misc. No.584 of 2025
dt.14-10-2025 learned executing court committed jurisdictional error. Learned executing court
further failed in its responsibility of discharging the statutory duty casts upon it to consider the
effect of limitation in view of Section 3 of Limitation Act. The learned executing court has further
not appreciated that once a decree is passed, it becomes executable from the date of decree itself,
unless its operation of execution was stayed by any Court. Learned senior counsel further submitted
that it is immaterial that who has raised the question of limitation but what is material is whether
there is substance in the question brought to the notice of the Court regarding maintainability of the
case. Learned senior counsel further submitted that the learned executing court also failed to
appreciate that filing of a miscellaneous case under Order 9 Rule 13 of the Code and any appeal
against the dismissal of the said case would not stand in the way of filing of execution case or
execution relating to decree in question nor shall stand in the way of executability of the said decree.
Since the execution case became barred by limitation, the learned executing court committed
jurisdictional error by not appreciating that once the period of limitation expired, the
enforceability/executability of the decree became barred and, in these circumstances, execution case
was not Patna High Court C.Misc. No.584 of 2025 dt.14-10-2025 maintainable. The learned
executing court has failed to follow the mandate of Article 136 of the Limitation Act, limitation of 12
years would start when the decree and orders became enforceable and the present decree became
enforceable on 24.05.1991 itself. Therefore, the impugned order is not sustainable as it is completely
illegal and against the law.
04. Mr. Arora further submitted that though the objection has been taken by the petitioners under
Order 21 Rule 97 r/w Section 151 of the Code, the petitioner being party to the proceeding could not
have taken objection under Order 21 Rule 97 of the Code but wrong mentioning of provision is not
fatal to the consideration of the application if power to pass such an order is available with the court.
Therefore, wrong mentioning of provision is not fatal to the cause of the petitioners. In this regard,
learned senior counsel referred to the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
Pruthvirajsinh N Jadeja (D) By Lrs. vs Jayeshkumar Chhakaddasm Shah, (2019) 9 SCC 533 wherein
the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that it is well settled law that mere mentioning of an incorrect
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198547931/ 3
Manoj Kumar vs Krishna Mohan Kumar on 14 October, 2025
provision is not fatal to the application if the power to pass such an order is available with the court.
Another decision relied on by the learned senior counsel in the case of P. K. Palanisamy Vs. N. Patna
High Court C.Misc. No.584 of 2025 dt.14-10-2025 Arumugham and another, (2009) 9 SCC 173,
wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that only because a wrong provision was mentioned by the
appellant, the same, in their opinion, by itself would not be a ground to hold that the application was
not maintainable or that the order passed thereon would be a nullity. The Hon'ble Supreme
reiterated that it is a well settled principle of law that mentioning of a wrong provision or
non-mentioning of a provision does not invalidate an order if the court and/or statutory authority
had the requisite jurisdiction therefor. While making this observation, the Hon'ble Supreme Court
referred to the decision in the case of Ram Sunder Ram vs Union Of India & Ors, (2007) 13 SCC 255,
wherein it has been held that if an authority has a power under the law, merely because while
exercising that power the source of power, is not specifically referred to or a reference is made to a
wrong provision of law, that by itself does not vitiate the exercise of power so long as the power does
exist and can be traced to a source available in law. This observation was made quoting N. Mani v.
Sangeetha Theatre and Ors. (2004) 12 SCC 278.
05. On the point of commencement of limitation period of 12 years, Mr. Arora referred to the
decision of Hon'ble Patna High Court C.Misc. No.584 of 2025 dt.14-10-2025 Supreme Court in the
case of Ram Bachan Rai & Ors. vs. Ram Udar Rai, 2006 (9) SCC 446 and submitted that facts of the
case are almost similar to the facts of the said case before the Hon'ble Supreme Court. In the case
before the Hon'ble Supreme Court, the suit was decreed ex parte on 3.5.1976 as the defendants did
not appear on the date fixed. No appeal was, however, filed against the aforesaid judgment and
decree. The appellants before the Hon'ble Supreme Court, who were the judgment debtors, filed an
application under Order 9 Rule 13 of the Code for setting aside the ex parte decree which was
dismissed for default on 14.7.1978. The said application was not restored by the trial court and a
Miscellaneous Appeal filed also stood dismissed on 10.1.1987. The Civil revision filed against the
order of dismissal was also dismissed on 6.4.1987. At no stage any stay was granted by any Court
and the respondents as decree holders filed an application for execution on 5.4.1991. When symbolic
possession was taken by the decree holders, the judgment debtors filed objection under Section 47
of the Code saying that the decree was not legally enforceable as it was barred by time. The learned
Subordinate Judge dismissed the objection holding that the period of twelve years had to be counted
from the date of dismissal of the Civil Revision by the Patna High Court C.Misc. No.584 of 2025
dt.14-10-2025 High Court, i.e., from 6.4.1987 as the ex- parte decree had merged in it. Against the
dismissal of Civil Revision, the appellant approached the Hon'ble Supreme Court. The Hon'ble
Supreme Court relied on the decision of three Judge Bench in the case of Dr. Chiranji Lal (D) by Lrs.
V. Hari Das (d) by Lrs., (2005 (10) SCC 746). In the aforesaid facts and circumstances, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court held that the application for execution filed on 5.4.1991 was clearly time barred
having been filed beyond the period of twelve years prescribed under Article 136 of the Limitation
Act and, thus, held that the High Court as well as the Executing Court committed illegality in coming
to a conclusion that it was not barred by limitation.
06. Mr. Arora next referred to the decision in the case of Bimal Kumar & Another vs. Shakuntala
Debi & Others, (2012) 3 SCC 548, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the decree was a
final decree and, therefore, it was immediately executable. As at no point of time, there was any
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198547931/ 4
Manoj Kumar vs Krishna Mohan Kumar on 14 October, 2025
order by any court directing stay of operation of the judgment and decree passed in partition suit
and the question for consideration before the Hon'ble Supreme Court was whether the period
during which the suit and the appeal preferred by the appellants remained pending has to be
excluded for the purpose Patna High Court C.Misc. No.584 of 2025 dt.14-10-2025 of limitation. The
Hon'ble Supreme Court referred to the decision in the case of Ratan Singh vs. Vijay Singh, AIR
(2001) 1 SCC 469, wherein it has been held that normally a decree or order becomes enforceable
from its date. But cases are not unknown when the decree becomes enforceable on some future date
or on the happening of certain specified events. The Hon'ble Supreme Court further held that filing
of an appeal would not affect the enforceability of the decree, unless the appellate court stays its
operation. But if the appeal results in a decree that would supersede the decree passed by the lower
court and it is the appellate court decree which becomes enforceable. When the appellate order does
not amount to a decree there would be no supersession and hence the lower court decree continues
to be enforceable. The Hon'ble Supreme Court also referred to the case of Ram Bachan Rai & Ors.
(supra). Thus, having regard to facts and judicial pronouncement before it, the Hon'ble Supreme
Court reached the conclusion that the initiation of execution proceedings was indubitably barred by
limitation and the appeal was allowed.
07. Mr. Arora next referred to the decision of a Division Bench of this Court in the case of Branch
Manager, Central Bank of India vs. M/s. A.M. Brothers, reported in 2013 Patna High Court C.Misc.
No.584 of 2025 dt.14-10-2025 (3) PLJR 807, wherein the Hon'ble Division Bench referred to the
cases of Bimal Kumar & Another (supra) and Ratan Singh (supra) and held that the ex parte decree
passed in 1992 continued to be enforceable from the date of decree itself and there was no stay at
any stage. The Hon'ble Division considering the hardship arising out of non-enforceability of a
decree on the ground of limitation and public interest being suffered because of legal technicality,
rejected such argument in view of the doctrine ""dura lex sed lex" which means that "the law is hard
but it is the law". The Hon'ble Division Bench further referred to the decision in the case of
Madamanchi Ramappa & Anr vs Muthalur Bojjappa, AIR 1963 SC 1633, wherein it has been held
what is administered in courts is justice according to law and consideration of fair play and equity,
however, important they may be, must yield to clear and express provisions of the law. Further, in
India House Vs. Kishan N. Lalwani, (2003) 9 SCC 393, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the
period of limitation statutorily prescribed has to be strictly adhered to and cannot be relaxed or
departed from for equitable consideration.
08. Thus, the learned senior counsel submitted that the impugned order is completely illegal and
hence, the same needs Patna High Court C.Misc. No.584 of 2025 dt.14-10-2025 to be set aside.
09. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents 1st set vehemently opposed the
contention of the learned senior counsel for the petitioners. Learned counsel for the respondent 1st
set submitted that the judgment debtors filed an application viz. under Order 21 Rule 97 r/w Section
151 of the Code under some misconception. The judgment debtors are not allowed to take objection
in the aforesaid provision. They are not stranger and they cannot claim in Executing Court to decide
their right, title and possession. Therefore, the application was not maintainable and it was rightly
rejected. The question of limitation could not be raised after the execution of the sale-deed and any
objection on this account is barred by doctrine of estoppel, waiver and acquiescence. Learned
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198547931/ 5
Manoj Kumar vs Krishna Mohan Kumar on 14 October, 2025
counsel further submitted that against the ex parte decree, the judgment debtors preferred an
application under Order 9 Rule 13, but miscellaneous case of the judgment debtor has been
dismissed on 25.06.1993. Thereafter, Misc. Appeal No. 16 of 1993 was filed by the judgment debtors
and the same was also dismissed on 11.10.1996 in default. Meanwhile, the decree holders have
deposited the rest consideration amount within statutory period as directed by the judgment of the
learned trial court. In such Patna High Court C.Misc. No.584 of 2025 dt.14-10-2025 circumstances,
period of limitation under Article 136 of the Limitation Act would come into play from the date of
11.10.1996 and the judgment and decree of the learned trial court merged with the decree of the
appeal and from the date of dismissal of the said appeal, limitation period would start. Therefore,
the execution application was filed well within the period of limitation.
10. In support of his contention, learned counsel for the respondent relied on a decision of learned
Co-ordinate Bench in the case of Sudarshan Prasad Vs. Smt. Rajpati Devi (Civil Misc. Jurisdiction
No. 157 of 2020, decided on 10.12.2024). Learned counsel for the respondents submitted that the
issue before the learned Co-ordinate Bench was almost similar. The respondent therein filed a suit
bearing Title Suit No. 14 of 1994 for specific performance of contract and the suit was decreed ex
parte against defendant vide judgment and decree dated 09.01.1998. The ex parte decree was
challenged by filing Miscellaneous Case No. 13 of 1998 under Order IX Rule 13 of the Code bu the
said miscellaneous case was dismissed on 27.08.1999. The defendant, thereafter, challenged the said
order in miscellaneous appeal, which was also dismissed on 25.08.2000. Against the aforesaid
order, the defendant preferred Patna High Court C.Misc. No.584 of 2025 dt.14-10-2025 a civil
revision before this Court, which was also dismissed on 31.08.2006. Thereafter, in the execution
case filed by the decree holder, maintainability of execution case was challenged on the ground of
limitation. Learned counsel further submitted that the objection on the ground of maintainability of
execution case was rejected by the learned executing court which was challenged in Civil
Miscellaneous Jurisdiction No. 157 of 2020. Learned counsel next submitted that the decisions in
the case(s) of Ram Bachan Rai (supra), Ratan Singh (supra), Branch Manager, Central Bank of India
(supra) were cited in support of his contention by the petitioner therein but the learned Co- ordinate
Bench, after discussing a number of case laws on the point of commencement of period of
limitation, relied on the decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Kunhayammed Vs. State
of Kerala, (2000) 6 SCC 359 and also the Division Bench decision of this Court in the case of Ram
Murti Choudhary @ Ram Murat Prasad Chaurasiya Vs. Ram Nihora Choudhary, (2017) 2 PLJR 136,
dismissed the civil miscellaneous petition holding that the dismissal of the civil revision would
amount to merger of a decree and the execution petition was not found barred by limitation.
Learned counsel next submitted that decision of the Co-ordinate Bench in the Patna High Court
C.Misc. No.584 of 2025 dt.14-10-2025 case of Sudarshan Prasad (supra) has been affirmed by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court vide order dated 07.02.2025 passed in Special Leave to Appeal (C) No(s).
2765 of 2025 whereby and whereunder the Hon'ble Supreme Court showed its disinclination to
interfere with the impugned judgment passed by the Co-ordinate Bench of this Court.
11. Learned counsel for the respondent further submitted that in the light of decision of Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Kunhayammed (supra), the dismissal order of the appellate court
would merge with the decree of trial court and the limitation period would start from the date of
dismissal of the appeal. Therefore, the execution case of the respondent is not time barred. Learned
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198547931/ 6
Manoj Kumar vs Krishna Mohan Kumar on 14 October, 2025
counsel further submitted that it is the substance of the petitioners' application and not the mere
nomenclature of the case and if any order is challenged before a Superior Court, then it is an appeal
against the order of lower court and the mere nomenclature would not change the nature of the
appeal. Placing strong reliance on the decision in the case of Sudarshan Prasad (supra), learned
counsel submitted that dismissal of miscellaneous case against an ex parte decree was challenged by
the judgment debtor/petitioner before the appellate court by filing miscellaneous appeal, the order
of the Patna High Court C.Misc. No.584 of 2025 dt.14-10-2025 learned trial court has merged with
the decision of the appellate court and for this reason, the execution case cannot be said to be barred
by limitation. Thus, the learned counsel submitted that there is no merit in the present petition and
the impugned order needs no interference by this Court.
12. I have given my thoughtful consideration to the rival submission of the parties in the light of
peculiar facts of the case.
13. Admittedly, the Title Suit No. 100 of 1982, filed by the plaintiffs/decree-holders for a decree of
specific performance for enforcement for an agreement for sale for executing a sale deed after
depositing the consideration money on 20.07.1991, decreed on 24.05.1991. The miscellaneous case
filed by the petitioners under Order IX Rule 13 of the Code vide Misc. Case No. 02 of 1992 came to
be dismissed on 25.06.1993. Thereafter, the petitioners preferred Misc. Appeal No. 16 of 1993,
which was also dismissed on 11.10.1996, though for non prosecution. The execution case has been
filed in the year 2006. The challenge to the Execution Case No. 02 of 2006 is on the ground that the
limitation period of 12 years started from the date when the ex parte decree was passed, i.e. on
24.05.1991, and came to an end in the year 2003 whereas the execution has Patna High Court
C.Misc. No.584 of 2025 dt.14-10-2025 been filed in the year 2006. However, the learned counsel for
the respondents 1st set contended that the decree of the learned trial court merged with the order of
the appellate court dismissing Misc. Appeal No. 16 of 1993 and, therefore, filing of execution case in
the year 2006 was well within the limitation period of 12 years. Now, challenge to the order of the
learned executing court by the petitioner is based on the reliance placed by the learned senior
counsel on the decisions in the case(s) of Ram Bachan Rai (supra), Ratan Singh (supra), Branch
Manager, Central Bank of India (supra). However, the learned Co-ordinate Bench in the case of
Sudarshan Prasad (supra) have considered these authorities. It was observed by the learned
Co-ordinate Bench that Ratan Singh (supra) has been overruled by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
the case of Shyam Sundar Singh Vs. Pannalal Jaiswal, 2005(1) SCC 436. Thereafter, taking note of
the Hon'ble Division Bench decision of this Court in the case of Ram Murti Choudhary @ Ram
Murat Prasad Chaurasiya (supra), the learned Co-ordinate Bench observed that this reference has
been decided while relying upon the decision in the case of Kunhayammed (supra). Paragraph Nos.
32, 41 and 44 of Kunhayammed (supra) read as under:
"32. It may be that in spite of having Patna High Court C.Misc. No.584 of 2025
dt.14-10-2025 granted leave to appeal, the Court may dismiss the appeal on such
grounds as may have provided foundation for refusing the grant at the earlier stage.
But that will be a dismissal of appeal. The decision of this Court would result in
superseding the decision under appeal attracting doctrine of merger. But if the same
reasons had prevailed with this Court for refusing leave to appeal, the order would
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198547931/ 7
Manoj Kumar vs Krishna Mohan Kumar on 14 October, 2025
not have been an appellate order but only an order refusing to grant leave to appeal.
41. Once a special leave petition has been granted, the doors for the exercise of
appellate jurisdiction of this Court have been let open. The order impugned before
the Supreme Court becomes an order appealed against. Any order passed thereafter
would be an appellate order and would attract the applicability of doctrine of merger.
It would not make a difference whether the order is one of reversal or of modification
or of dismissal affirming the order appealed against. It would also not make any
difference if the order is a speaking or non-speaking one. Whenever this Court has
felt inclined to apply its mind to the merits of the order put in issue before it though it
may be inclined to affirm the same, it is customary with this Court to grant leave to
appeal and thereafter dismiss the appeal itself (and not merely the petition for special
leave) though at times the orders granting leave to appeal and Patna High Court
C.Misc. No.584 of 2025 dt.14-10-2025 dismissing the appeal are contained in the
same order and at times the orders are quite brief. Nevertheless, the order shows the
exercise of appellate jurisdiction and therein the merits of the order impugned having
been subjected to judicial scrutiny of this Court.
44. To sum up, our conclusions are:
(i) Where an appeal or revision is provided against an order passed by a court,
tribunal or any other authority before superior forum and such superior forum
modifies, reverses or affirms the decision put in issue before it, the decision by the
subordinate forum merges in the decision by the superior forum and it is the latter
which subsists, remains operative and is capable of enforcement in the eye of law.
(ii) The jurisdiction conferred by Article 136 of the Constitution is divisible into two
stages. The first stage is upto the disposal of prayer for special leave to file an appeal.
The second stage commences if and when the leave to appeal is granted and the
special leave petition is converted into an appeal.
(iii) The doctrine of merger is not a doctrine of universal or unlimited application. It will depend on
the nature of jurisdiction exercised by the superior forum and the content or subject-matter of
challenge laid or capable of being laid shall be determinative of the applicability of merger. The
superior Patna High Court C.Misc. No.584 of 2025 dt.14-10-2025 jurisdiction should be capable of
reversing, modifying or affirming the order put in issue before it. Under Article 136 of the
Constitution the Supreme Court may reverse, modify or affirm the judgment-decree or order
appealed against while exercising its appellate jurisdiction and not while exercising the
discretionary jurisdiction disposing of petition for special leave to appeal. The doctrine of merger
can therefore be applied to the former and not to the latter.
(iv) An order refusing special leave to appeal may be a non-speaking order or a speaking one. In
either case it does not attract the doctrine of merger. An order refusing special leave to appeal does
not stand substituted in place of the order under challenge. All that it means is that the Court was
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198547931/ 8
Manoj Kumar vs Krishna Mohan Kumar on 14 October, 2025
not inclined to exercise its discretion so as to allow the appeal being filed.
(v) If the order refusing leave to appeal is a speaking order, i.e., gives reasons for refusing the grant
of leave, then the order has two implications. Firstly, the statement of law contained in the order is a
declaration of law by the Supreme Court within the meaning of Article 141 of the Constitution.
Secondly, other than the declaration of law, whatever is stated in the order are the findings recorded
by the Supreme Court which would bind the parties thereto and also the court, tribunal or Patna
High Court C.Misc. No.584 of 2025 dt.14-10-2025 authority in any proceedings subsequent thereto
by way of judicial discipline, the Supreme Court being the Apex Court of the country. But, this does
not amount to saying that the order of the court, tribunal or authority below has stood merged in the
order of the Supreme Court rejecting the special leave petition or that the order of the Supreme
Court is the only order binding as res judicata in subsequent proceedings between the parties.
(vi) Once leave to appeal has been granted and appellate jurisdiction of Supreme Court has been
invoked the order passed in appeal would attract the doctrine of merger; the order may be of
reversal, modification or merely affirmation.
(vii) On an appeal having been preferred or a petition seeking leave to appeal having been converted
into an appeal before the Supreme Court the jurisdiction of High Court to entertain a review petition
is lost thereafter as provided by sub-rule (1) of Rule 1 of Order 47 CPC."
14. The learned Co-ordinate Bench in the case of Sudarshan Prasad (supra) held in Paras-29 and 30
as under:
"29. It is well settled that it is the substance of the petition/application and not the
mere nomenclature of the case chosen by the parties that has determinative value. In
my Patna High Court C.Misc. No.584 of 2025 dt.14-10-2025 view, if any order is
challenged before a superior Court then it is an appeal against the order of the lower
Court and the mere nomenclature will not change the nature of the appeal. In the
present case also, the ex parte decree of the Munsif was challenged before the learned
District Judge by filing a Miscellaneous Appeal, which was dismissed and the same
was thereafter challenged/appealed before the High Court under Civil Revisional
Jurisdiction though the nomenclature is civil revision but, in fact, it is an appeal
against the order passed by the District Judge. In the present case, against the order
of appeal, a revision petition has been filed before this Court and in the revision, the
order of the appeal has been affirmed and therefore, the decision of the subordinate
Court i.e. Munsif has merged in the decision of the superior forum i.e. in the order of
this Court and therefore, the same is capable of enforcement in the eye of law.
30. In view of the aforesaid discussions as well as in view of the decisions rendered in
the case of Kunhayammed vs. State of Kerela (supra) and Ram Murti Choudhary @
Ram Murat Prasad (D.B) (supra) dismissal of the civil revision will amount to merger
of a degree and the same cannot be said to be barred by limitation. Therefore, once it
is held that the appellate decree has merged with the Patna High Court C.Misc.

Manoj Kumar vs Krishna Mohan Kumar on 14 October, 2025
No.584 of 2025 dt.14-10-2025 revisional order, the period of limitation for the
execution of decree will start from the date of dismissal of the civil revision and
therefore, the execution case filed by the decree holder i.e. respondent-plaintiff is well
within the period of limitation.
15. The decision of the learned Co-ordinate Bench in the case of Sudarshan Prasad (supra) was
challenged before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Special Leave to Appeal (C) No(s). 2765 of 2025
and the said Special Leave to Appeal has been dismissed vide order dated 07.02.2025, thus,
affirming the reasoning adopted by the learned Co-ordinate Bench. The fact of the present case are
similar to the case before the learned Co- ordinate Bench and adopting the same reasoning and in
the light of the decision rendered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Kunhayammed
(supra), it can be safely concluded that the decree of the learned trial court merged with the order of
the learned appellate court and the period of limitation for execution of decree would start from the
date of dismissal of Misc. Appeal No. 16 of 1993. Therefore, Execution Case No. 02 of 2006 filed by
the decree holders/respondent 1st set is well within the period of limitation.
16. Therefore, in the light of discussion made here-in- before, I do not find any infirmity in the
impugned order dated Patna High Court C.Misc. No.584 of 2025 dt.14-10-2025 05.03.2025 passed
by the learned Sub Judge-1 st, Naugachhia and the same is hereby affirmed. Accordingly, the
present petition is dismissed.
17. The stay granted vide order dated 13.08.2025 stands vacated.
18. Pending interlocutory applications, if any, stand disposed of.
