ORDER
This Criminal Revision case has been preferred challenging the judgment of the learned Principal
District and Sessions Judge dated 20.07.2016 made in C.A.No.53 of 2015 confirming the judgment
of the learned Judicial Magistrate No.IV, Vellore dated 10.06.2014 in C.C.No.10 of 2008.
2. The case has arisen out of an accident occurred at Vellore bus stand. As per the case of the
prosecution on 28.06.2006 at about 7.30.p.m, when the passengers were waiting for getting into the
bus, the first accused, who is not an employee of the Tamil Nadu State Corporation, driven the bus
bearing Registration No.TN2 N 1675 in a rash and negligent manner and caused the death of three
persons and caused injuries to three persons.
3. On the complaint-statement given by PW1/Vijayakumar, PW18- Manikandan, Sub Inspector of
Police registered a case in Crime No.470 of 2006 of Vellore North (L & O) police station under
Section 279, 338(2 counts), 337, 304A(3 counts) IPC and prepared the FIR. He conducted the
inquest on the body of the deceased Balu and prepared inquest report. Thereafter, PW16-Ayyavu,
Inspector of Police took up the investigation. He went to the place of occurrence and prepared the
observation mahazar(Ex.P2) https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis and rough sketch (Ex.P16). He
examined the witnesses and recorded their statements. He conducted the inquest on the bodies of
the deceased Sathyakavi and Dhanalakshmi and prepared inquest reports. Thereafter, the bodies
were sent for postmortem. On the same day, he arrested the accused at 1.30.p.m and recorded his
confession statement and thereafter, PW19 continued the investigation. He enquired rest of the
witnesses and the doctor who conducted postmortem and got postmortem certificates. He obtained
Motor Vehicle Inspector report also after examining the Motor Vehicle Inspector. After completing
investigation, he filed the charge sheet against the first accused for the offence under Sections 279,
337, 338(2 counts) and 304A(3 counts) IPC and against the second and third accused for the offence
under Sections 337, 338(2 counts) and 304A(3 counts) IPC. After the case was taken on file and
after completing the legal mandates, when the accused were questioned, they pleaded innocence
and claimed to be tried. Hence, the trial was conducted.
4. During the course of trial, on the side of the prosecution, 19 witnesses have been examined as
PW1 to PW19 and 21 documents were marked as Exs.P1 to P21. On the side of the defence, no
witness has been examined. However, one document has been marked as Ex.D1.

5. After completing the trial and after considering the materials available on record, the learned trial
Judge acquitted A2 and A3 and found the first accused guilty for the offence under Sections 279,337,
338(2 counts) and 304A (3 counts) IPC and convicted and sentenced him as under:-
Offence under Punishment Imposed on the accused Sections 279 IPC To pay a fine of

Rs.500/-
304(A) IPC To undergo one year Rigorous (3 counts) Imprisonment and a fine of
Rs.2000/- for each count of the offence, in default, to undergo a simple
imprisonment for a period of two months for each offence
6. Aggrieved over that, he preferred an appeal in C.A.No.53 of 2014 and the same was
also dismissed on 20.07.2016. Challenging the said judgment, the present revision
case has been filed by the accused.
7. Heard the learned counsel for the revision petitioner and the learned Government
Advocate (Crl. Side) appearing for the respondent and perused the materials
available on record.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
8. Point for consideration:
Whether the conviction and sentence of the accused for the offence under Sections
279, 337, 338(2 counts) and 304A(3 counts) IPC by the learned Sessions Judge based
on the materials available on record is fair and proper?
9. The learned counsel for the revision petitioner submitted that the rash and negligence on the part
of the accused was not proved; it is also not proved before the trial Court that it was the accused,
who had acted as driver at the relevant point of time; without proving the rash and negligent
driving, a person cannot be convicted for the offence under Section 304(A) IPC. He cited the
decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in 1968 AIR 829 (Suleman Rehiman Mulani &
Another Vs. State of Maharashtra) in support of his above contentions.
10. The learned Government Advocate (Crl. Side) appearing for the respondent submitted that the
accused who was the brother of third accused had gone to the driver seat and started the bus and hit
against the persons randomly and in which three persons got injured and three died; the act of the
accused speaks for itself and the Courts are right in convicting the accused for the offence under
Section 304(A) IPC.

11. This is a strange case, in which the bus belonging to State Transport Corporation was not driven
by its driver at the time of accident. There is no dispute about the fact that the vehicle involved in
the accident was the bus belonging to Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation and it was parked in
the Vellore Bus stand. The injured and the deceased were the passengers, who were waiting in the
bus stand.

12. It is claimed by the learned counsel for the defence that the prosecution has not established the
relationship between the third accused and the first accused. He invited the attention of this Court
to the letter written by the Investigation Officer (Ex.D1) in which, the accused has been shown as a
passenger of the bus. It is to be noted that the second and third accused were the driver and the
conductor of the bus. What has to be actually found is whether it was the accused, who had handled
the bus and whether the accident has been caused due to his negligence.
13. PWs1 to 3 were not only the injured witnesses, but they are the eye- witnesses. Their evidence
would reveal that while they were standing in the bus stand, the vehicle, which was handled by the
accused, was hit against the persons, who were waiting for the bus. The learned trial Judge believed
the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ocular account of the eye witnesses, who also got injured in the
accident. PW2 is the witness, who not only got injured but also lost his child in the accident. PW3
has lost his son and daughter-in-law in the occurrence. PW5, who was working as a Security in the
bus stand deposed that immediately after the occurrence, the accused was secured by the public and
handed over to the security. I find no reason to reject the evidence of the above witnesses, in the
absence of any motive they had against this accused.
14. This is a kind of a case in which the prosecution need not establish the rash and negligent driving
of the accused. Because the accused is a stranger to the bus and the audacity or curiosity he had to
handle the bus caused this accident. He is not a professional driver. The very act of the accused to
get into the bus for starting it, is an act of negligence. Hence, there is no force in the argument that
the prosecution did not establish the rash and negligent driving of the accused. The accused was
seen by the injured witness and he was secured by the public and caught red handed and handed
over to PW5-Security. The accused was not authorised to handle the bus. He was seen alighting
down hurriedly from the driver seat by some passengers. Since the evidence of witnesses could
infuse the confidence of the Court, the Trial Court had chosen to accept the same and it was upheld
by the Appellate Court. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis The accused, who does not know driving,
out of curiosity got into the driver seat and started the bus. That would naturally go directionless
and hit against innocent people, who would be waiting in the bus stand for various reasons. It is a
very sad incident in which three lives were lost and three people got injured. It has been already
observed that PWs 2 and 3 are not injured, but they had also lost the kiths and kins in the accident.
15. Since the evidence available on record is concrete and clear and proves the guilt of the accused, I
find no reason to interfere with the judgment of the Courts below. However, the learned counsel for
the petitioner submitted that some indulgence may be shown in the quantum of sentence. It is seen
that the accused was found guilty for the offence under Section 304(A) IPC (3 counts) and he was
convicted and sentenced to undergo Rigorous Imprisonment for a period of One Year and a fine of
Rs.2,000/- for each count. It is submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the
petitioner has paid the fine amount in its entirety.
16. In my opinion, the act of the accused is not only negligent but also mischievous. The punishment
imposed by the Courts below sufficiently deterrent and in my view the accused does not deserve any
reduction in the punishment.
