(iii) And for any other relief (s) the petitioner is found to be entitled in the facts and circumstances

2. This Court has passed an interim order dated 20.02.2019 which reads as follows:-
"Let the defects, as pointed out by office, be ignored.
This writ application has been preferred seeking release of the Tractor and Trailer
loaded with food-grains which are said to be 23.55 qunital of Wheat, 72 quintal of
Rice and 8.02 qunital of Maize and paddy. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits
that the petitioner has also challenged the confiscation proceeding for the reason that
in the facts of the present case where the seizure of food-grains is based on mere
Patna High Court CWJC No.3335 of 2019 dt.13-10-2025 suspicion and till date the
investigation is still pending, there is no basis for initiation of a confiscation
proceeding.
Learned counsel submits that the food-grains in question are not controlled items
and the petitioner is not a PDS dealer, therefore, the mere lodgment of the F.I.R.
under Section 420 of the I.P.C. and Section 7 of the E.C. Act would not give rise to a
presumption against the petitioner that he was indulged in any act of cheating or
black- marketing.
It is further submitted that the food-grains and Tractor are under seizure for the last
more than six months, therefore those are required to be released otherwise it will be
a case of gross injustice to the petitioner. The petitioner is willing and ready to abide
by the terms and conditions of the release of the vehicles and food-grains.
Under these facts and circumstances, learned counsel for the State submits that as
regards initiation of the confiscation proceeding in the facts of the present case he
would file a counter affidavit within four weeks from today.
Patna High Court CWJC No.3335 of 2019 dt.13-10-2025 Considering the fact that in
similar matters this court has been directing provisional release of the vehicle and
release of food-grains, this court finds that six months has already gone and as the
food-grains are not controlled items and it would only be just and proper to direct the
District Magistrate-cum- Collector, Purnia (Respondent No. 2) to release the food-
grains and the Tractor as well as Trailer of the petitioner on his furnishing document
of registration of the vehicles in his favour and surety bond to the extent of the cost of
the food-grains and the value of the vehicles as indicated in the insurance document.
The surety bond shall not be in form of cash or bank guarantee. The question as to
whether in the given facts the confiscation proceeding should be continued against
the petitioner shall be considered after filing of a counter affidavit.

The aforesaid release shall be ordered within a period of one week from the date of
submission of the surety bond as indicated above. Patna High Court CWJC No.3335
of 2019 dt.13-10-2025 List this matter on 28th March, 2019 under the heading "For
Admission"."
3. On perusal of the interim order, it is evident that the vehicle as well as food grains of the
petitioner were released by the respondents. It is contended by the Learned counsel for the
petitioner that the confiscation proceedings are pending before the respondents. Therefore, the
respondents are directed to dispose of the confiscation case within a period of four months from the
date of the receipt of this order.
4. With the abovesaid observation, the writ petition shall stand disposed of.
