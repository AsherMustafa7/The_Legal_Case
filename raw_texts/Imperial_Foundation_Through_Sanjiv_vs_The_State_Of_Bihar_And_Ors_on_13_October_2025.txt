Imperial Foundation Through Sanjiv ... vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 13 October, 2025
for issuance of a writ in nature of
Mandamus commanding the respondent
to refund security deposit and earnest
money in the form of bank guarantee of
Agreement No. 10/2008-09 and
07/2009-10
U/PMGSY & Agreement No. 44-F2/2008-09 of MMGSY as well as money deducted U/head of
extension of time with admissible interest as the work in question has been successfully completed
and even the respondent no.6 Executive Engineer has issued completion certificate of the work in
question."
2. The brief facts as culled out from the petition are that the petitioner is a registered Class II
Contractor with the respondents having unblemished track record and was awarded following rural
road construction contracts under the PMGSY and MMGSY schemes in Saran (Chapra) District:
(I) Agreement No. 07/2009-10 - from Repura Rasulpur Road to Gochi Chapra
(PMGSY)
(ii) Agreement No. 10/2008-09 - from Paharpur to Akhaipur (PMGSY) Patna High
Court CWJC No.12764 of 2017 dt.13-10-2025
(iii) Agreement No. 44-F2/2008-09 -
from Manpur Garkha Road Ke Basant Pakwa Innar to Ratanpura Basant via Gouhar Basant
(MMGSY)
3. It is submitted that in compliance with standard tender Bidding Documents, the petitioner
deposited earnest money in the form of Bank Guarantee / NSC (National Savings Certificate) /KVP
(Kishan Vikash Patra) and in due course the respondent has deducted performance security while
making certain payments. It is further submitted that completion certificates were issued by the
concerned Executive Engineer (Annexures 1, 2 & 3). Additionally, certain deductions were made
under the head "Extension of Time," which, according to the petitioner, are refundable after
successful completion of the work.
4. It is contended that apart from the above, the petitioner was also awarded three other work
contracts i.e., Agreement No. 84/2009-10 - REO Road to Sabalpur (PMGSY), Agreement No.
85/2009-10 - Bhawani Chapra to Deoria (PMGSY), Agreement No. 86/2009-10 - Paharpur to
Sarwadih Patna High Court CWJC No.12764 of 2017 dt.13-10-2025 (PMGSY).
5. It is claimed that these agreements are separate and distinct from the first three agreements.
However, the contracts under Agreements 84, 85, and 86 were subsequently terminated, and the
earnest money and security deposits related thereto were forfeited. The impugned Letter No. 1815
dated 18.09.2013 directed recovery of deficit amounts from the petitioner's dues, under the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/40603792/ 2
Imperial Foundation Through Sanjiv ... vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 13 October, 2025
successfully completed and certified works.
6. The Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the termination of Agreements 84-86 was
arbitrary and caused by delays in fund allocation or lack of response from the department. It is
further contended that recovery from unrelated contracts, which were successfully completed, is
without jurisdiction and violative of principles of natural justice.
7. The Learned counsel further contended that the Executive Engineer himself had recommended
"Extension of Time" for the Patna High Court CWJC No.12764 of 2017 dt.13-10-2025 terminated
contracts (Annexure-4). Despite repeated representations filed by the petitioner, there was no
redressal for which the petitioner is constrained to approach this Court.
8. A counter affidavit was filed by the respondent Nos. 2 to 6.
9. The Learned counsel for the respondents submitted that the petitioner failed to complete the
work under Agreement No. 86/2009-
10. Even after lapse of 2 years and 10 months, only 27% of the work was done. Due to non- renewal
of the bank guarantee and defects in the work, the Executive Engineer, Rural Work Department
rescinded the agreement as per Clause 52 of the General Conditions of Contract (GCC). It is further
submitted that the recovery under Letter No. 1815 dated 18.09.2013 was as per Clause 53.1 of the
GCC.
10. It is further submitted that with regard to Agreement No. 86/2009-10, a final bill of Rs. 2,46,903
was prepared post-measurement on Patna High Court CWJC No.12764 of 2017 dt.13-10-2025
25.08.2013. However, payment could not be made, due to the liability not being within the approved
priority list and is currently pending before the Liability Committee through Letter No. 3200 dated
09.06.2018.
11. Heard the Learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the Learned counsel for the State and
perused the record of the case.
12. This Court finds from the record that the petitioner successfully completed the works under
Agreement Nos. 10/2008-09, 07/2009- 10, and 44-F2/2008-09 and accordingly, completion
certificates were issued by the Executive Engineer, and no dispute has been raised regarding the
quality or timeliness for these three contracts. Further, vide Annexure-4, the Executive Engineer
himself had forwarded recommendations for grant of extension of time for the terminated contracts,
thereby acknowledging the delays that were solely not attributable to the petitioner. The impugned
action of adjusting alleged liabilities arises out of separate and Patna High Court CWJC No.12764 of
2017 dt.13-10-2025 unrelated contracts i.e., Agreement Nos. 84, 85, and 86 of 2009-10, against
amounts due under completed contracts and is not supported by any clause that permits such
set-off, especially in the absence of a clear determination of liability. The respondents have not
denied that the petitioner was entitled to receive payment under the completed contracts, including
refund of earnest money, performance security, and deductions made under the head of "extension
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/40603792/ 3
Imperial Foundation Through Sanjiv ... vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 13 October, 2025
of time". The relevant clause on payment upon termination as cited in the agreement mandates
issuance of a certificate for the work done. However, no such certificate was placed on record
showing due calculation or justification for the recovery made.
13. This Court is of the considered view that the impugned Letter No. 1815 dated 18.09.2013 is
arbitrary and violative of the principles of natural justice, particularly as it relates to contracts that
stand completed with formal certifications and where no fault has been found.
Patna High Court CWJC No.12764 of 2017 dt.13-10-2025
14. In light of the above findings Letter No. 1815 dated 18.09.2013 is hereby quashed. The
respondents are directed to refund the security deposit, earnest money, and deductions made under
the head of extension of time in respect of Agreement Nos. 07/2009-10, 10/2008-09, and 44-
F2/2008-09, within a period of two months from the date of receipt or production of a certified
copy of this order.
15.With the above observations and directions, the writ petition is allowed.
16. Interlocutory Application, if any, shall stands disposed of.
