Date : 10-10-2025 1 The petitioner has filed the instant application for the following reliefs:
"(a) for issuance of writ of certiorari, or any other writ/writs, direction/directions or
order/orders to quash order dated 19.07.2017 (Annexure 6 of petition) and

(b) for any other relief or Patna High Court CWJC No.13572 of 2017 dt.10-10-2025
reliefs to which the petitioner is found entitled as per law."
2. At the outset, the Learned counsel for the respondents submitted to the Court that the present
Writ petition is squarely covered by the orders passed by this Court in CWJC No. 1490 of 2017 (Vijay
Patel Singh Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors. as well as in CWJC No. 16068 of 2017 (Vibhore Kumar Vs.

Rajeev Kumar @ Rajiv Kumar vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 10 October, 2025
The State of Bihar & Ors). It is further submitted that this Court has disposed of Vibhore Kumar
(supra) in light of the judgment passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of
Pawapuri Rice Mills Versus Bihar State Food and Civil Supplies Corporation Ltd. & Ors. and other
analogous cases reported in 2024 SCC OnLine SC 3777, therefore, this Writ petition may also be
disposed of on the same terms and conditions.
3. However, the Learned counsel for the petitioner placed reliance on AIR 1976 Patna 217 (Hari
Prasad Agarwalla Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors.).
Patna High Court CWJC No.13572 of 2017 dt.10-10-2025
4. Heard the Learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the Learned counsel for the State and
perused the records of the cases.
5. I find force in the submissions made by the Learned counsel for the respondents and have also
perused the orders passed in the cases relied upon by him.
6. The reliance placed by the Learned Counsel for the petitioners is not applicable in the present
case, as the Hon'ble Supreme Court has recently observed in Pawapuri Rice Mills (supra), which
squarely applies to the present matters.
7. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Pawapuri Rice Mills (supra) has observed as follows:
"41. We have perused the record and are of the view that the Rice Millers invoked the
writ remedy by raising a jurisdictional fact against realising the sums as a public
demand under the Act. As a writ court or in an appeal under Article 136, we are not
examining the contentions on alleged Patna High Court CWJC No.13572 of 2017
dt.10-10-2025 procedural deviations. We, however, leave it open to the respective
Rice Millers to avail a statutory remedy as may be available under the Act. For
availing a statutory remedy, we grant thirty days from today to the Rice Millers.
42. In the event of a Rice Miller availing a statutory remedy as permitted by this
Judgment, the said authority shall entertain the case without reference to the delay
and the period of limitation in availing a remedy before the said authority. With the
above observation, the civil appeals stand dismissed. No order as to costs. "
8. Taking into consideration of the Pawapuri Rice Mills (supra) that the petitioner has a statutory
remedy for filing an appeal under Section 60 of the Bihar & Orissa Public Demand Recovery Act,
1914, therefore, the petitioner is directed to to file an appeal within four weeks from the date of
receipt of this order before the appropriate authority. The delay in filing the appeal Patna High
Court CWJC No.13572 of 2017 dt.10-10-2025 shall be condoned by the authority concerned, and the
authority shall dispose of the appeal within three months from the date of filing of the appeal.
9. With the above said observation, the aforesaid Writ petition is disposed of.
