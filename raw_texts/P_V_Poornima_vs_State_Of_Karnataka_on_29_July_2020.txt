P V Poornima vs State Of Karnataka on 29 July, 2020
2. This Writ Petition assails the order dated 20.01.2020 passed by the Karnataka State
Administrative Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as 'KSAT', for the sake of convenience) in
Application No.5689/2019. By the said order, KSAT has allowed the Application and set aside
notification No.¹D¸ÀÄE 56 D¸ÉÃªÀ dated 11.09.2019 insofar as the Applicant and respondent no.2
therein.
3. Heard learned Senior Counsel Sri. A.S. Ponnanna, for the petitioner, learned counsel Sri. D.R.
Ravishankar, for respondent no.3 through Video Conference; and also Sri. T.L. Kiran Kumar,
learned AGA, who appeared in person for respondent nos.1 and 2.
4. Sri R. Anil Kumar was the applicant in Application No.5689/2019 before the KSAT. Smt. P.V.
Poornima was arrayed as respondent no.2. In the said Application, Sri R. Anil Kumar (respondent
no.3 herein) had challenged Notification bearing No.¹D¸ÀÄE 56 D¸ÉÃªÀ dated 11.09.2019 issued
by respondent no.1 canceling the earlier transfer Notification dated 06.09.2019 in respect of Smt.
P.V. Poornima and posting Sri R. Anil Kumar, as SLAO-II, KIADB (BMICP), Bengaluru.
5. The facts briefly stated are that, the applicant - Sri R Anil Kumar, was working as the SLAO,
Yettinahole Project, Doddaballapura. On 29.06.2019, he was transferred to the post of SLAO-II,
KIADB. He replaced Smt. P.V. Poornima, who was working in the said post, since 2017. He took
charge on 04.07.2019. Within two weeks, i.e. under a Notification dated 15.07.2019, they were
reverted back. The order dated 15.07.2019 was challenged by Sri R. Anil Kumar in Application
No.4271/2019. During its pendency, an order dated 19.08.2019 was passed by the Government,
modifying the Notification dated 15.07.2019 and Sri R. Anil Kumar came to be transferred to the
post of SLAO-II, KIADB. Taking note of the order dated 19.08.2019, Application No.4271/2019 was
disposed of. Immediately thereafter, the impugned order dated 11.09.2019 came to be issued and
Smt. P.V. Poornima, who was under transfer as the SLAO, Singataluru, Lift Irrigation Project,
Hoovina Hadagali, Ballari, in terms of order dated 06.09.2019 was modified and she was brought
back as the SLAO-II, KIADB, Bengaluru. She replaced Sri. R. Anil Kumar in the post, who in turn
was transferred to the post of SLAO-II, KIADB (BMICP), Bengaluru. As stated earlier, challenging
this order, Application No.5689/2019 was filed before KSAT.
6. Upon service of notice, the State Government did not file statement of objections. However, Smt.
P.V. Poornima entered appearance and filed objections. In her objections, it was contended that
both Sri. R. Arun Kumar and Smt. P.V. Poornima were officials belonging to the Revenue
Department, whose services were lent to the Commerce and Industries Department. The impugned
order was only an order of deputation by the Commerce and Industries Department to particular
posts and was not a transfer. Therefore, transfer guidelines were not attracted. Alternatively, even if
it were considered to be as 'transfer', it had prior approval of the Chief Minister and was not
contrary to the Transfer guidelines. Yet another contention was that Sri R. Anil Kumar, was merely
shifted within KIADB from one subject i.e., SLAO-II, KIADB to SLAO-II, KIADB (BMICP), which
did not involve change of headquarters and therefore, it was not an order of transfer.
7. On consideration of the case, the KSAT held that even a change of office (within KIADB) was a
transfer, by referring to the Full Bench decision in S.N. Gangadharaiah Vs. State of Karnataka, (ILR
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/70041106/ 3
P V Poornima vs State Of Karnataka on 29 July, 2020
2015 KAR 1955). It further held that the transfer was premature. Regardless of prior approval by the
Chief Minister, as the impugned order of transfer did not contain any detailed reasons and hence the
premature transfer was unsustainable. It accordingly allowed Application No.5689/2019 and set
aside transfer order dated 11.09.2019 insofar as Sri. R. Anil Kumar and Smt. P.V. Poornima are
concerned. Assailing this order of the KSAT, Smt. P.V. Poornima has filed this writ petition.
8. On behalf of the petitioner - Smt. P.V. Poornima, the learned Senior counsel, made the following
submissions:
(i) The KSAT held that the impugned transfer was premature. But KSAT ignored the
fact both Sri. R. Anil Kumar and Smt. P.V. Poornima belonged to Revenue
Department. Their services were lent to Commerce and Industries Department.
Thereafter vide the impugned order, Sri R. Anil Kumar was merely issued with order
of deputation to a particular post. Such order of deputation was not a transfer.
(ii) It was also urged that the impugned order even if it were to be considered as an
order of transfer and was premature, it had the prior approval of the Chief Minister
and therefore, could not have been set aside by KSAT.
(iii) It was also urged that mere change of subject of Sri R. Anil Kumar, from
SLAO-II, KIADB to SLAO-II, KIADB (BMICP), without change of Head Quarter was
not a 'transfer' as defined in the Transfer Guidelines. The decision in
W.P.No.1383/2019 disposed of on 17.01.2019 (M.J. Varun Kumar Vs. H.T. Natesh&
Ors.) was relied upon.
9. On the other hand, the learned Addl.
Government Advocate, representing respondents no.1 and 2 sought to justify the impugned order on
the ground that the same did not attract application of the transfer guidelines.
10. On behalf of Respondent no.3 - Sri R. Anil Kumar, it was submitted as follows:
(i) The very nomenclature of the impugned order itself clarified that it was an order
of transfer.
(ii) In view of Full Bench decision in S.N. Gangadharaiah's case (supra), change of
post even within department would also be 'transfer'.
(iii) Even change of subject would be 'transfer' as per Clause 3 (d) of the Transfer
Guidelines.
(iv) It was further contended that issuance of repeated orders to retain Smt. P.V.
Poornima as SLAO-II. KIADB, Bengaluru, indicated that they were issued at her
behest and no public interest was involved. Hence transfer was totally malafide.

P V Poornima vs State Of Karnataka on 29 July, 2020
11. Learned counsel relied upon the following decisions:
(i) ILR 2015 KAR. 1955 S.N. Gangadharaiah Vs. State of Karnataka
(ii) 2019 (1) AKR 489 Rajashekar M. Vs. State of Karnataka & Ors.
(iii) 2019 (1) Kar LJ 161 Shivakumar Vs. State of Karnataka & Ors.
Manjunath Vs. State of Karnataka & Ors.
Kotresh Vs. State of Karnataka & Ors.
(vi) 2018 (1) AKR. 685 B.C. Ravindra Vs. Managing Director & Ors.
12. In addition, attention of this Court was also sought to be drawn to the fact that the Senior
Counsel, who represented respondent No.3 - Sri R. Anil Kumar, in Application No.4971/2019, was
now representing Smt. P.V. Poornima.
13. It has been contended in this case, by the Petitioner that an order issued for a mere change of
subject within KIADB cannot be termed a 'transfer' nor would an order of deputation/posting in the
department to which the services of the official is lent also does not amount to a transfer. The full
bench of this Court in S.N. Gangadharaiah's case(supra), in paragraph No.20 has held as follows:
"20. .....
(c) Consequently, we hold that posting of a Government servant from one office to
another within the same headquarters, to take up the duties of a new post would
tantamount to transfer within the meaning of clause 3 (d) of the Government Order
dated 07.06.2013."
The said finding is on the very point. Hence no error is committed by KSAT in relying upon the
decision and following the law laid down therein. Hence, the said contention is rejected.
14. From a perusal of the preamble to the impugned order dated 11.09.2019, it is mentioned as a
transfer by the Government. It also does not appear to be issued by the borrowing department.
Hence the petitioner's contention that the impugned order was only an order of deputation to a
particular post by the borrowing department is contrary to facts. The decision of this Court in M.J.
Varun Kumar's case(supra), also does not assist the petitioner. The impugned order describes itself
as a transfer and there is absolutely no material on record to indicate that it was a mere case of
movement from one desk to another. It is also highly unlikely, as posts in question are meant for
officers of Karnataka Administrative Services rank and therefore, the transfer being from one office
to another within the same Headquarter is highly probable. Failure of the State to throw light on this
aspect also has to be held against the petitioner herein in view of the nomenclature of the impugned
order. Hence, for all the above reasons, petitioner's contention is rejected.

15. Further from the tabulation of the transfer Notifications placed on record in this case, it is seen
that no less than eleven orders have been issued by the State Government, either transferring or
modifying transfer orders or withdrawing transfer orders, within a span of about one year. This is
without any doubt a case of premature transfer. Thus, the finding of the KSAT is fully justified and
cannot be faulted.
16. As held by Coordinate Bench of this Court in Shivakumar's case (supra), in case of a premature
transfer, prior approval of the Chief Minister to the transfer is mandatory. If the same is not
granted, the transfer would be void ab initio. Another Coordinate Bench of this Court in
Rajashekar's case(supra), has added that unless the impugned transfer fell within any of the
circumstances mentioned in para - 9 (a) (i) to (vii) of the Transfer Guidelines dated 07.06.2013,
prior approval of the Chief Minister will not save it from being set-aside as contrary to the
Guidelines. As no such circumstance has been cited in the impugned transfer order dated
11.09.2019, the KSAT has rightly set it aside. The same does not call for any interference in this case.
17. From the facts of this case, we are unable to hold back from dealing with an important aspect of
transfers which has manifested itself in this case. We deem it necessary to tabulate the various
transfer orders issued with regard to Smt. P.V Poornima and Sri R. Anil Kumar, the parties herein.

Shockingly, transfer orders are issued and modified repeatedly even after unsuccessful challenge
before KSAT or even before taking charge at the place of transfer. Yet, it was submitted that it is the
petitioner, who has suffered hardship due to repeated transfers and that she was the victim, when it
is glaringly on record that, she repeatedly sought to be brought back to a particular post, that too
after her completing minimum tenure in it. Such action on the part of the State is indeed contrary to
its intention expressed in the transfer Guidelines to keep the transfers to below 6% of the cadre
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/70041106/ 8
P V Poornima vs State Of Karnataka on 29 July, 2020
strength in a year and to regulate the same based on definite criteria. It is equally disturbing to
notice in this case that the State, which issued the impugned transfer Notifications has done little to
defend the same. No statement of objection was filed before the KSAT or before this Court. Though
attempt was made to defend the transfer Notifications orally, on the ground that they were issued in
public interest, administrative exigencies and efficiency in administration, no material is produced
to substantiate the same. We observe that the result of repeated transfer/retransfer of an official in
order to accommodate another Officer causes grave hardship upon the transferred officials and their
families. Due to unregulated transfers, the accountability of the officials towards effective
implementation of state policy is lost, which impacts the public at large. Taking stock of this
situation, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in TSR Subramanian and Ors. Vs. Union of India and Ors.
reported in 2013 (15) SCC 732,has observed in paragraph No.35 as under:
"35. We notice, at present the civil servants are not having stability of tenure,
particularly in the State Governments where transfers and postings are made
frequently, at the whims and fancies of the executive head for political and other
considerations and not in public interest. The necessity of minimum tenure has been
endorsed and implemented by the Union Government. In fact, we notice, almost 13
States have accepted the necessity of a minimum tenure for civil servants. Fixed
minimum tenure would not only enable the civil servants to achieve their
professional targets, but also help them to function as effective instruments of public
policy. Repeated shuffling/transfer of the officers is deleterious to good governance.
Minimum assured service tenure ensures efficient service delivery and also increased
efficiency. They can also prioritise various social and economic measures intended to
implement for the poor and marginalised sections of the society."
18. Under the circumstances, we deem it proper to stipulate the requirement of disclosing specific
reasons for issuing orders for modification or cancellation of transfers with a further requirement
that the degree of detail/specific reasons would increase with each subsequent
modification/cancellation of transfer order, issued prematurely. This would not stifle the power of
the executive to transfer officials in exceptional circumstances, but at the same time, the disclosure
of reasons would ensure accountability to the public is being served. Such a measure would also act
as a check on the transfers being effected on the requests made by officers to particular posts that
too repeatedly, as in the instant case. Moreover, the transfer guidelines issued by the State
Government to regulate transfers of government servants in the State are statutory in nature and
binding on the State Government. They cannot be blatantly flouted to appease any government
servant nor can they be ignored while accepting requests from officers/officials to seek postings of
their choice. Such action on the part of the State Government not only demoralises the other officers
who are consequently displaced prematurely but also generates litigation before the
Tribunals/Courts. It needs to be emphasised that no Government Servant should think that he/she
can seek postings of his/her choice in blatant violation of the Transfer Guidelines. Such practice has
to be deprecated.
19. Before parting with the case, the last of the submissions indeed requires us to deviate from the
merits of the case. It was stated at the Bar that the Senior Counsel appearing in this case for the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/70041106/ 9
P V Poornima vs State Of Karnataka on 29 July, 2020
petitioner (Smt. P.V. Poornima), had represented the respondent no.3 (Sri R. Anil Kumar), before
the Tribunal. In this regard our attention was drawn to the order sheet of the Tribunal in
Application No.4271/2019, which we have perused. Learned Counsel and particularly Senior
Counsel are looked upon as legal professionals with high standards of conduct and etiquette in the
society, particularly while discharging their duties as counsel. What is required is to send a strong
reminder about the exemplary traditions and high standards of legal practice and standing at the
Bar, which the members of the Bar must always bear in mind. This is in order to maintain purity in
dispensation of justice towards which, we have all solemnly affirmed. We wish to say no more! For
the foregoing reasons, the writ petition is dismissed.
No order as to costs.
