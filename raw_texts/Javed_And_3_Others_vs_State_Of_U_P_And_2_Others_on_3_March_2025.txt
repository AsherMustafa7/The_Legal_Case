Judicial Magistrate 4th, Meerut, on the basis of compromise.
4. On 31.01.2025, the following order was passed:-
"1. Heard Sri J.B. Singh, learned counsel for the applicants, learned AGA for the
State, learned counsel for opposite party no. 2 and perused the record.
2. The present 482 Cr.P.C. application has been filed by the applicants to quash
entire proceedings of Case No. 659 of 2015 (State v. Abdul Kayyum & others), arising
out of Case Crime No. 175 of 2011, under Section 406 IPC and 3/4 Dowry Prohibition
Act, Police Station Kotwali, District Meerut, as well as charge sheet dated 11.10.2011,
on the basis of compromise dated 03.04.2024.
3. Learned counsel for the applicants submits that the parties have amicably settled
their dispute and to that effect compromise deed has been filed. Copy of said
compromise deed has been annexed as Annexure no. 8 to the affidavit, therefore,
continuance of proceedings against the applicants would be futile exercise and
wastage of time of the Court and will be abuse of process of law. Hence, proceedings
of the aforesaid case be quashed in the light of law laid down by the Apex Court in the
case of Gian Singh v. State of Punjab reported in (2012) 10 SCC 303.
4. Learned AGA does not dispute the correctness of the submissions made by the
learned counsel for the applicants.

court, where the proceedings are pending, after ensuring the presence of the parties
before it.
6. In view of the above, parties are directed to appear before the court below along
with copy of compromise deed and certified copy of this order. It is expected that the
trial court may fix a date for the verification of the compromise and after ensuring the
presence of parties, pass an appropriate order with respect to the same in accordance
with law, as expeditiously as possible, preferably within a period of four weeks from
today. While passing the order verifying the compromise, the concerned court shall
also record the statements of the parties as to whether all the terms and conditions
mentioned in the original compromise deed, so filed, have been fulfilled or not.
7. If the said compromise is verified, the same shall be made part of the record and
report to that effect, will be prepared and the parties would be allowed to obtain
certified copy thereof and file the same before this Court.
8. Put up this case on 03.03.2025, as fresh.

between the parties even in respect of certain cognizable and non compoundable offences. Reference
may also be made to the decision given by this Court in Shaifullah and Others Vs. State of U.P. &
Another; 2013 (83) ACC 278 and Pramod & Another Vs. State of U.P. & Another (Application U/S
482 No.12174 of 2020, decided on 23rd February, 2021) and Daxaben Vs. State of Gujarat, reported
in 2022 SCC Online SC 936 in which the law expounded by the Apex court in the aforesaid cases has
been explained in detail.
