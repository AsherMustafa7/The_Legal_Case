90 IV ANALYSIS OF PROCEEDINGS UNDER SECTION 99 OF R.P ACT 132 The
present Election Petition has been filed under Sections 80, 81, 100 read with Section
123 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 ('R.P. Act') seeking to set aside the
election of respondent No.1 to the 15th Karnataka Legislative Assembly from Tumkur
Rural Assembly Constituency held during May 2018 and consequently declare the
petitioner as duly elected to fill the seat of Karnataka Legislative Assembly as regards
Tumkur Rural Assembly Constituency (No.133).
I. BRIEF FACTS:
2. The facts make out that the petitioner and respondent No.1 had filed nomination
seeking election to the Karnataka Legislative Assembly from Tumkur Rural Assembly
Constituency. The petitioner belongs to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), while the
respondent No.1 belongs to Janata Dal (S) Party [JD(S) Party]. In the ensuing
elections, the petitioner is stated to have obtained 77,100 votes, while the respondent
No.1 had secured 82,740 votes and was declared as elected by margin of 5,640 votes
and the Returning Officer had issued Form No.21-C under Section 64 of the R.P. Act
declaring the respondent No.1 as elected.
3. The petitioner has challenged the validity of the election of respondent No.1
contending that his election was vitiated by commission of corrupt practices as
defined under Sections 123(1) and 123(2) of the R.P. Act.
4. Amongst the corrupt practices that are stated to have been resorted to by the
respondent No.1 are the following:-
(i) Payment of Rs.5,00,000/- by the Kammagondanahalli Sri Maruthi Seva Samithi
[KMSS] which is a Registered Society alleged to have been controlled by first
respondent's father and having as its office bearers, mother, brother and members of
the extended family, for renovation of Shanidevaru Temple at Dasarahalli.
(ii) The promise of 1000 free seats in Engineering College run by KMSS in the event
the JD(S) Party comes to power.
(iii) The followers of JD(S) Party,
Smt.Gowramma and Sri Anantha were
distributing Medi Assist Cards while canvassing on 02.04.2018 in order to lure the
voters to vote for the respondent No.1. It is stated that there was seizure of 56 Medi
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 5
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
Assist Bonds from the house of Smt.Gowramma and Sri Anantha.
(iv) It is further submitted that on 11.05.2018, the FST-II Squad was visiting Gulur and Hebbur
Hobli and Sri C.Rangadhamappa, Sri Jayaram C.N. and Sri Devaraju intercepted a Scorpio vehicle
bearing registration number KA-06-N- 2725, coming from the opposite direction and the said
vehicle was abandoned by inmates. The Medi Assist cards, cash and other materials along with
materials which contained details of JD(S) Party workers were seized. Subsequently, the
investigation report revealed that the vehicle belonged to Sri Palanethraiah, who eventually pleaded
guilty for the offence under Section 171E of IPC, who is alleged to be the Counting Agent of
respondent No.1.
(v) That Medi Assist Policy was taken out by KMSS whereby there would be reimbursement of the
medical expneses incurred by the children of electors. Pursuant to such Policy, there was
distribution of Medi Assist cards on behalf of respondent No.1 with his consent to the parents of the
children which was an enticement, with a request to vote in favour of respondent No.1 in the 2018
General Elections.
(vi) Upon complaint being made by PW.2 as regards the issuance of Medi Assist Policy, it is stated
that M/s.New India Assurance Co. Ltd., which had issued the policies had cancelled the said policies
with effect from 08.05.2018. It is further alleged that the factum of cancellation of Medi Assist
Policy was not intimated to the recipients.
5. It is further submitted that by benefiting from such corrupt practices, the respondent No.1 was
declared elected and the present Election Petition has been filed within the time stipulated assailing
the validity of the election on the grounds referred to above.
6. The respondent No.1 upon notice of the petition filed his written statement denying the
allegations made while asserting that a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) by the name 'One
Rupee Charity Foundation' ('ORCF') had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)
with 'KMSS' and after obtaining the data with regard to poor students residing in the vicinity had
paid the premium and taken the Medi Assist Policy and issued the Medi Assist Cards.
7. It was further asserted that the Medi Assist Policy was issued prior to the Election Notification by
the Election Commission of India. It was specifically contended that the respondent No.1 resides
separately from his parents and does not have any transaction with his parents or relatives
subsequent to the execution of Release Deed in the year 2007, and that he is not associated with
KMSS.
8. It was also contended that the JD(S) Party had declared the respondent No.1 as its candidate only
by issuance of 'B' Form on 21.04.2018, while denying the allegation that the declaration was made
by the JD(S) Party on 18.02.2018 itself.
9. It was specifically asserted that the respondent No.1 did not have any relationship with
Smt.Gowramma and Sri Anantha, who were neither the official agents nor authorized agents of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 6
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
respondent No.1.
10. The respondent No.1 has also denied any connection with the incident of 11.05.2018 where the
Election Squad had intercepted the 'Scorpio' vehicle bearing registration No.KA-06-N-2725 and
made the seizure of articles.
11. The respondent No.1 has specifically raised the defence regarding irregularity of verification in
light of requirement under Section 83(1)(c) of R.P. Act and Order VI Rule 15 of C.P.C; that separate
affidavit verifying averments made in the Election Petition was not filed as required under Order VI
Rule 15(4) of C.P.C., that affidavit filed by the petitioner in Form-25 at page Nos.30 and 31 do not
meet the requirements of law, that verification of Annexures are not done in accordance with
Section 83(2) of the R.P. Act.
12. The respondent No.1 has filed I.A.No.1/2018 under Sections 81, 83, and 86 of the R.P. Act read
with Order VII Rule 11 of C.P.C. to dismiss the Election Petition, I.A.No.2/2018 under Sections 81,
83, 86 and 87 of the R.P. Act read with Order VI Rule 16 of C.P.C. seeking for an order to strike out

the R.P. Act and furnish affidavit as contemplated under C.P.C.

III. ANALYSIS:
PART - A
15. Issue Nos.(ii)(a) and (ii)(b) are taken up together for consideration as relevant
facts and evidence that is considered for disposal of the said issues are common.
The issues framed are as follows:-
(ii) WHETHER THE PETITIONER PROVES THAT THE RESPONDENT NO.1, HIS
ELECTION AGENTS AND OTHERS WITH FIRST RESPONDENT'S KNOWLEDGE
AND CONSENT HAS COMMITTED THE FOLLOWING CORRUPT PRACTICES AS
DEFINED UNDER THE R.P.ACT AND HENCE HIS ELECTION IS TO BE
DECLARED AS VOID. -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 8
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
(a) WHETHER PETITIONER PROVES DONATIONS WERE MADE TO THE
SHANIDEVARU TEMPLE AT DASARAHALLI THROUGH SRI MARUTI SEVA
SAMITHI IN ORDER TO ENTICE THE VOTERS TO VOTE IN FAVOUR OF
RESPONDENT NO.1 ?
(b) WHETHER THE PETITIONER PROVES RESPONDENT NO.1 EITHER BY
HIMSELF OR THROUGH PERSONS ASSOCIATED WITH HIM HAD PROMISED
TO DISTRIBUTE FREE SEATS IN ENGINEERING COLLEGE?
16. The above issues relate to the assertion of petitioner that with the consent of
respondent No.1, the persons acting on his behalf have made donations to
Shanidevaru Temple at Dasarahalli Village through KMSS in order to entice the
voters and that further, the respondent No.1 by himself or through persons associated
with him had promised to distribute free seats in the Engineering College managed
by KMSS.
17. Both the issues are taken up together insofar as there is commonality regarding
the period during which donation was made to Shanidevaru Temple as well as
promise made to distribute the free seats in Engineering College.
18(i) The petitioner has asserted that the respondent No.1 has a 'facebook account1' which is a social
networking platform and in his 'facebook account' he has posted on 25.03.2018 that respondent
No.1 has notified the public that the Society had paid Rs.5,00,000/- for renovating Shanidevaru
Temple at Dasarahalli Village, Hebbur Hobli. A screen shot of the photograph posted on the
facebook has been marked as Ex.P8.
18(ii) It is further asserted that a post on the facebook account of respondent No.1 on 30.03.2018,
wherein public were informed through an interview that the father of respondent No.1 who was also
the President of Tumkur District JD(S) Party had informed the public that if JD(S) Party returns to
power, he would give 1,000 free seats in the Engineering College run by the Society. A Video clip of
the said statement had been shared by the respondent No.1 on his facebook page, which is marked
as Ex.P9.
see ¶18 of Election Petition 18(iii) It is submitted that donation to Shanidevaru Temple at
Dasarahalli and the statement made by the father of respondent No.1 were made with an intention
of luring the electorate to vote for respondent No.1 who was declared as the candidate of JD(S)
Party.
19(i) In the written statement filed by respondent No.1, the allegations have been denied. It is
asserted that respondent No.1 did not have any facebook account and that KMSS had not paid any
amount for the renovation of Shanidevaru Temple at Dasarahalli Village on 25.03.2018.
19(ii) It was specifically asserted that even otherwise, the date on which the alleged amount is stated
to have been paid is prior to the date of filing of nomination pursuant to the Notification of election
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 9
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
issued by the Election Commission dated 17.04.2018 and accordingly, cannot be taken note of2.
see ¶ 21 of the written statement filed by respondent No.1 19(iii) Insofar as the allegation relating to
father of respondent No.1 informing the public through an interview that if JD(S) Party is returned
to power, he would give 1,000 free seats in the Engineering College run by KMSS, the said allegation
has been specifically denied.
20. It must be noted that the donation by Society to the Shanidevaru Temple even as per the
pleadings is stated to have been made on 25.03.20183 and insofar as the statement in a Television
channel relating to giving of 1,000 free seats in the Engineering College was also stated to have been
made on 30.03.20184, whereas, the respondent No.1 is stated to have filed his nomination on
23.04.2018.
21. Insofar as corrupt practice falling within the scope of Section 123 of R.P. Act, it is clear that the
same must be committed by a candidate. A 'candidate' has been defined under Section 79(b) of the
R.P. Act as "a person who has been or claims to have been duly nominated as a candidate at any
election." Section 34 of the R.P. Act see ¶18 of the petition see ¶19 of the petition provides that a
candidate shall not be deemed to be duly nominated unless he deposits or causes to be deposited in
case of an election from an Assembly Constituency, a sum of Rs.10,000/-. It is further specified
under Section 34(2) of R.P. Act that any sum required to be deposited under sub-section (1) shall
not be deemed to have been deposited unless at the time of delivery of nomination paper, the
candidate has deposited the said amount.
Accordingly, unless a person is a 'candidate' in terms of Section 34 of R.P. Act, any corrupt practice
committed earlier cannot be taken note of for the purpose of Section 123 of the R.P. Act5.
This is however subject to an exception where the corrupt practice is constituted by a chain of linked
events which may have commenced prior to the date of the candidate filing his nomination and is
linked to other acts subsequent to the candidate filing his nomination which interpretation has been
applied to the allegation which is a subject matter of issue No.(iii) discussed infra. This however is
an interpretation based on appreciation of evidence. The Apex Court in the case of Mohan Rawale v.
Damodar Tatyaba-(1994) 2 SCC 392) has kept the question open as regards incident prior to the
notified date being admissible and relevant for other purposes during the subsequent stage
22. The Apex Court has also laid down the law on this aspect in Subhash Desai v. Sharad J. Rao6.
The observations made are as follows7:
"18. On behalf of the appellant, it was then pointed out that in election petition, while
alleging corrupt practices, reference has been made in respect of the speeches and
publications, of period prior to 31-1-1990, which was the date when nomination
papers were filed. The publications and speeches alleged to have been made prior to
31-1-1990 have to be ignored because the framers of the Act, required the High Court
to judge the conduct of the candidate, his agent or persons with the consent of the
candidate or his election agent, only after a person becomes a candidate for the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 10
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
particular election. A person becomes a candidate for the election in question only
after filing the nomination paper. In this connection, reference may be made to
Section 79(b) of the Act which defines 'candidate' to mean a person, who has been or
claims to have been duly nominated as a candidate at any election. Section 34 of the
Act says that a candidate shall not be deemed to be duly nominated for election from
a constituency unless he deposits or causes to be deposited the amounts AIR 1994
SCC 2277 This observation has been affirmed in Chandrakanta Goyal v. Sohan Singh
Jodh Singh Kohli - (1996) 1 SCC 378 (see para-3) and also in the case of Sri
D.T.Sridhar v. Sri B.K.Sangameshwar and Others - ILR 2012 KAR 1995, a judgment
by this Court (see para-22) prescribed in the said section. When a person becomes a
candidate, was examined by this Court in the well- known case of Indira Nehru
Gandhi v. Raj Narain [1975 Supp SCC 1] and it was held: (SCC p. 64, para 146) ...
Recently, this Court in the case of Mohan Rawale v. Damodar Tatyaba alias
Dadasaheb, (Special Leave Petition (Civil) No.5594/1992 disposed of on August 6
1992,) has said:
"We hold that all the averments in paragraphs 1 to 20 of the memorandum of election
petition insofar as they refer to a period prior to 23-4-1991 cannot amount to
allegations of corrupt practice."
This cut-off date 23-4-1991 was fixed with reference to the date when nomination papers were filed
by the appellant concerned, because since that date the appellant will be deemed to have legally
acquired the status of a candidate. According to us, any allegation of corrupt practice against the
appellant, made by the respondent in respect of the period prior to the filing of nomination by the
appellant on 31-1-1990, cannot be taken into consideration for judging the legality or validity of his
election."
23. Accordingly, both the alleged corrupt practices relate to the period prior to respondent No.1
filing his nomination hence, there arises no other reason for enquiring into the said aspect any
further.
24. Accordingly, the issue Nos.ii(a) and ii(b) are answered in the negative.
PART - B
25. Issue Nos.-(ii)(c), (ii)(d) and (v) are taken up together for consideration, as relevant facts and
evidence that are considered for disposal of the said issues are common.
The issues are as follows:-
(ii) WHETHER THE PETITIONER PROVES THAT THE RESPONDENT NO.1, HIS
ELECTION AGENTS AND OTHERS WITH FIRST RESPONDENT'S KNOWLEDGE
AND CONSENT HAS COMMITTED THE FOLLOWING CORRUPT PRACTICES AS
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 11

(c) WHETHER THE PETITIONER PROVES THAT SRI MARUTHI SEVA SAMITHI

WERE CANCELLED ON THE BASIS OF COMPLAINTS?
(v) DOES THE PETITIONER PROVE THAT RESPONDENT NO.1 IS ASSOCIATED
WITH SRI MARUTHI SEVA SAMITHI AND IF SO, IN WHAT MANNER ?
26(i) It is the case of the petitioner that KMSS is a family controlled Society and that the family
members of the respondent No.1 control it by virtue of being the office bearers, that the Medi Assist
Policy was taken out by KMSS, which would enable the insured who are children studying in schools
to obtain the benefit of reimbursement of medical expenses upto Rs.10,000/- in the event of
treatment and that there was distribution of the Medi Assist Identity Cards, which were in a cover
containing the photograph of Sri.H.D.Devegowda, Former Prime Minister, Sri.H.D.Kumaraswamy,
Former Chief Minister and Sri.C.Chennigappa by Sri Arehalli Manjunath, Smt.Renukamma, Sri
Krishnegowda and Smt.Sunandamma, who are JD(S) Party workers. It was further alleged that the
distribution of Medi Assist cards was for the purpose of luring the voters to vote for respondent
No.1. It was also contended that distribution is done to Sri Lakshminarayana V.N, Sri Gopalaiah, Sri
Mahadevaiah, Sri D.R.Ramesh, Smt.Ramamani, whose children were beneficiaries and have
produced the said Medi Assist cards in their evidence.
26(ii) It was specifically asserted that policies were taken to benefit the students studying in various
schools i.e., about 50 to 100 schools situated in Tumkur Rural Assembly Constituency and the
students residing in approximately 200 villages.
26(iii) It is further asserted that the agents of the respondent No.1 had distributed insurance bonds
in Doddasarangipalya on 26.04.2018, in Virupasandra village on 27.04.2018, in Mallasandra village
on 30.04.2018 and in Honnudike village on 03.05.2018. That the said issue was covered by the
Media in "Prajavani" Newspaper and Sri Mahesh, President of JD(S) Yuva Morcha had held a Press
Meet on 11.05.2018, in which it was admitted that 17,000 students had been insured for obtaining
the benefit under the Medi Assist Policy by the respondent No.1 and the said clarification was
covered by the "Prajavani" Newspaper and also in the local media "Tumkur Varthe".
26(iv) It is asserted that Sri Narasimha Murthy had intimated the Deputy Commissioner and the
Tahsildar, upon whose information the Flying Squad of Election Commission conducted a search
operation in the house of Sri Anantha (referred to as Ananthu in deposition by the parties) and
Smt.Gowramma and had recovered 56 Medi Assist cards issued by M/s.New India Assurance Co.

Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
Ltd., favouring the students.
26(v) It was specifically asserted that KMSS had paid a sum of Rs.6.00 lakhs as premium, that the
Policy bearing Number-67210034170500000258 came to be issued which was valid for the period
between 26.02.2018 to 25.02.2019 and that holder of the policy was KMSS.
26(vi) Accordingly it is averred that the respondent No.1 with the aid of his father had indulged in
corrupt practice falling within the scope of Section 123 of the R.P. Act.
26(vii) It is further specifically asserted that the petitioner's brother Sri Ramesh Bettaiah (PW-2), on
coming to know of the said Medi Assist cards on 07.04.2018 had made out plaints by way of Email
to Smt.Jyothi, who is in- charge of customer care and also to the Vigilance of Insurance Regulatory
and Development Authority of India (IRDAI).
26(viii) It is asserted that there were various Email correspondence with the Election Commission
and Insurance Authorities and eventually a communication was received on 08.05.2018 from the
Regional Manager of M/s.New India Assurance Co. Ltd., that decision was taken to cancel the Medi
Assist policies.
27(i) In the written statement filed by respondent No.1, it was contended that after receipt of notice
in the present petition, an enquiry was made with the KMSS and had learnt that an NGO named
ORCF which was registered on 01.07.2013 had entered into an understanding with KMSS and in
terms of the said MoU, KMSS was to furnish the data with regard to poor students residing in its
jurisdiction to ORCF and thereafter ORCF would pay the premium for the poor students and issue
Medi Assist Policies to the poor students.
27(ii) It is specifically asserted that the respondent No.1 is neither a member nor an office bearer of
KMSS and respondent No.1 did not have any relationship with KMSS. It was asserted that KMSS
had not paid premium for issuance of Medi Assist policies and the premium was paid by ORCF and
policies were taken for the period from 26.02.2018 to 25.02.2019, and in terms of the said policy,
the date of issuance of policy was prior to the election notification issued by the Election
Commission of India.
27(iii) It is specifically asserted by respondent No.1 that he has severed ties with his family by
entering into a Release Deed in the year 2007 and was residing separately from his parents.
ISSUANCE OF MEDI ASSIST POLICY ON 26.02.2018
28. A legal contention that requires to be considered is as to whether the issuance of Medi Assist
Policy at Ex.P.80 on 26.02.2018 could be taken note of and finding recorded regarding commission
of corrupt practice relating to Ex.P.80, while the schedule for the election was published in the
Gazette on 17.04.2018 and the nomination was stated to have been filed on 23.04.2018. This
assumes importance in light of the settled position that the commission of a corrupt practice could
be taken note of only after the returned candidate pursuant to his nomination has made deposit as
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 13
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
envisaged under Section 34 of the R.P. Act. Section 79(B) defines a 'candidate' as a person who has
been duly nominated as a candidate which must be read in conjunction with Section 34 which
provides that the candidate shall not be deemed to be duly nominated unless he deposits the sum
prescribed.
29. Initially a Medi Assist Policy was taken and subsequently Medi Assist cards were stated to have
been distributed to the Voters. It must be noted that in the facts of the present case, the distribution
of the Medi Assist cards is admittedly after the date of nomination of the respondent No.1. The
distribution of the Medi Assist cards by itself coupled with enticement to vote for the returned
candidate would amount to bribery in terms of Section 123 of the R.P. Act.
30. However, the fact that the policy at Ex.P.80 was taken before the respondent No.1 became a
candidate would not have the effect of negativing the corrupt practice of bribery constituted by
distribution of Medi Assist cards after the date on which respondent No.1 has been declared a
candidate. The issuance and distribution of Medi Assist cards irrespective of their genuineness
would as a matter of fact still constitute bribery in terms of Section 123 of R.P. Act, if the said
document constituting the Medi Assist card was held out to be reflective of a Medi Assist Policy and
used to entice the electors to vote for him. The fact that the validity of the Medi Assist cards even if
not proved but still is construed by the receiver to be a document capable of enticement is by itself
sufficient. The handing over of the Medi Assist card being a gift/gratification and intended to be so,
would serve the purpose of falling within the mischief sought to be curbed under Section 123 of the
R.P. Act. In fact, the cancellation of the policy on 08.05.2018, i.e. four days before polling by the
M/s.New India Assurance Co. Ltd., not having been made known to the recipient has still served the
purpose of acting as enticement and has influenced the voter to vote in a particular manner. An
example of a coupon being distributed during polling period to the electorate which is capable of
being encashed and constituting gift/gratification having been accepted and acted upon and votes
are cast on the basis of such enticement and the subsequent discovery of it being a fake coupon and
could not be encashed, would not have the effect of not treating such act of distribution of coupon
constituting bribery in terms of Section 123 of the R.P. Act.
31. In the present factual matrix, the issuance of the Medi Claim Policy at Ex.P.80 was admittedly
prior to date of nomination of respondent No.1. That by itself would not form an act of corrupt
practice. However, where pursuant to the issuance of policy as per Ex.P.80, Medi Assist cards were
distributed subsequent to the date of nomination with the purpose of enticement to the electors to
vote for the respondent No.1, such distribution of Medi Assist cards with enticement, subject to
proof, would be a stand alone corrupt practice. Nevertheless, the taking out of Medi Ass ist Policy
prior to the date of nomination, seizure including Medi Assist cards as detailed in P.F. No.31/2018
in Crime No.0073/20188 and acts of distribution of Medi Assist cards after the cut off date would be
circumstances to be taken note of to come to a conclusion regarding the pattern of commission of
bribery as is made out in the present case.
32. The Apex Court in Mohan Rawale v. Damodar Tatyaba alias Dadasaheb9 (Mohan Rawale), has
considered the precise question as to whether acts of alleged corrupt practice though prior to the
relevant date could be made use of for other purposes, has been commented upon as follows:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 14
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
"7. Shri R.F. Nariman for the first respondent found it difficult to support the view
taken by the High Court as to the time at which appellant's candidature could be said
to have commenced. However, Shri Nariman endeavoured to contend that even if the
allegations in on 11.05.2018, the FST-II Squad was visiting Gulur and Hebbur Hobli
and Sri C.Rangadhamappa, Sri Jayaram C.N. and Sri Devaraju intercepted a Scorpio
vehicle bearing registration number KA-06-N-2725, coming from the opposite
direction and the said vehicle was abandoned by inmates. The Medi Assist cards, cash
and other materials along with materials which contained details of JD(S) Party
workers were seized. Subsequently, the investigation report revealed that the vehicle
belonged to Sri Palanethraiah, who eventually pleaded guilty for the offence under
Section 171E of IPC, who is alleged to be the Counting Agent of respondent No.1.
(1994) 2 SCC 392 paragraphs 1 to 20 did not, by themselves, establish corrupt
practice in law by virtue of their commission prior to the appellant becoming a
candidate, these averments and allegations must be read as parts of similar
transactions pleaded in the later and subsequent paragraphs of the memorandum of
the election petition. Shri Nariman said that, at all events, the allegations in
paragraphs 1 to 20 cannot be said to be irrelevant if they can be sustained for the
purposes of probabilising or furnishing "similar-fact" evidence of the allegations of
corrupt practice made in the later paragraphs of the election petition.
8. We hold that all the averments in paragraphs 1 to 20 of the memorandum of
election petition insofar as they refer to a period prior to April 23, 1991 cannot
amount to allegations of corrupt practice. But on the question whether they are
relevant and admissible for other purposes for the reasons submitted by Shri
Nariman we abstain from expressing any opinion. This aspect did not engage the
attention of the High Court and was not considered by it. It is for the High Court to
consider them at the appropriate time. We, therefore, declare that the allegations in
paras 1 to 20 relating to the period anterior to the commencement of the candidature
cannot be relied upon to establish corrupt practice proprio vigore."
(emphasis supplied) It is relevant to note that the Apex Court has not expressed any opinion in light
of its observation that "this aspect did not engage the attention of the High Court and was not
considered by it", in effect, the said aspect has been kept open and is a matter that could be
adjudicated upon.
33. In light of the discussion made above, this Court is of the view that though certain acts do not
constitute bribery and corrupt practice in light of the said incident having occurred prior to the
relevant date, however, as in the present case, it may be taken as a circumstance constituting a chain
of events where subsequent events alongwith the prior event together reveals a pattern and design in
commission of the corrupt practice. The contention that other judgments of the Apex Court have not
approved this view may not be correct as the question as noticed in Mohan Rawale (supra) which
was kept open and has not been overruled and is essentially the matter to be factually demonstrated.
In terms of the discussion infra, such a chain of events as referred to above is found to be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 15
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
established. Even otherwise, de hors the reliance on Ex.P.80, the distribution of Medi Assist cards
after the designated date by themselves constitute bribery and corrupt practice. ISSUANCE OF
MEDI ASSIST POLICY IN THE NAME OF KMSS
34. Ex.P.80 is the policy issued by M/s.New India Assurance Co. Ltd., wherein the name of the
insured is Kammagondanahalli Sri Maruthi Seva Samithi. The address relating to the name of the
insured is shown as "No.6, Kammagondanahalli, Abbigere Main Road, Bangalore North Taluk,
Bangalore". Policy Number is 67210034170500000258. The address mentioned in Ex.P80 tallies
with the address mentioned in the Bye-laws of KMSS which is marked as Ex.P5. Both Ex.P80 and
Ex.P5 are not in dispute. Ex.P80 is the best available evidence regarding the existence of the Medi
Assist policy. The policy is marked through the Regional Manager of M/s. New India Assurance Co.
Ltd., Sri Kittuswamy.A, who was examined as PW.10. The evidence of PW.10 would also reveal that
upon cancellation of the policy, refund of the premium has been made to the KMSS as is evidenced
from Ex.P90.
35. The voucher at Ex.P90 is dated 25.06.2018 and the receiver's name is shown as
"Kammagondanahalli Sri Maruthi Seva Samithi, No.6, Kammagondanahalli, Abbigere Main Road,
Bangalore North Taluk, Bangalore- 560064, Karnataka, India." Policy Number is shown as
67210034170500000258 and refund of Rs.5,29,527/- has been paid through "Cheque favouring:
KAMMAGONDANAHALLI SRI MARUTHI SEVA SAMITHI® (PO 5778459)".
Payment is stated to have been made through Cheque bearing No.4518.
36. The statement of account of M/s. New India Assurance Co. Ltd., Disbursement Account is
produced and marked through PW.10 as Ex.P93 and indicates transfer of funds to KMSS on
27.06.2018 i.e., two days after the issuance of voucher at Ex.P90 for an amount of Rs.5,29,527/-.
The voucher number is 1819000316, which tallies with the voucher number of Ex.P90 and
Ex.P90(a). PW.10 has specifically asserted that refund is made to KMSS. Though it is contended by
respondent No.1 that a fake KMSS account had been created, in light of the refund voucher in the
name of KMSS at Ex.P90, the burden of proving that it was a fake account was on the respondent
No.1 and no efforts have been made to discharge such burden.
37. On the basis of the said evidence, it can be stated that the policy has been issued in the name of
KMSS and upon cancellation, the refund is also made to KMSS.
38. The only serious contention that is taken is that the premium was paid by ORCF which requires
consideration. The payment of premium however will not have the effect of altering the terms of
Ex.P80 insofar as policy is undoubtedly issued in the name of KMSS and accordingly, any
contention that the policy must be construed as having been taken out by ORCF cannot be looked
into.
39. Insofar as the payment of premia, it comes out from Ex.P80 that the total premia paid is
Rs.6,57,406/- and the receipt number and date is mentioned as 67210081170000006739 dated
05.03.2018. In terms of Ex.P81 marked through PW.10, the collection number mentioned is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 16
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
67210081170000006739 which tallies with the receipt number in Ex.P80. The amount received
shown in Ex.P81 is Rs.6,57,406/-. The receipt is issued in the name of "KAMMAGONDANAHALLI
SRI MARUTHI SEVA SAMITHI(R)".
40. As per Exhibits-P82, P83, P84 and P85, advance premium deposit receipt issued in the name of
KMSS refers to an amount of Rs.1,90,000/- in each of the receipts and there are three cheque
numbers viz., Ex.P82- Ch.No.555019, Ex.P83-Ch.No.555020, Ex.P84- Ch.No.555021 and
Ex.P85-Ch.No.555022 and the sum total of these three cheques is Rs.6,60,440/- (1,90,000 x 3 =
5,70,000 + 90,440/-). The payment is stated to have been made by Sri T.L.Krishnamurthy as per
Ex.R2(a) which is the bank statement that would indicate payment to M/s.New India Assurance Co.
Ltd., in a sum of Rs.6,60,440/-. The fact that Sri.T.L.Krishnamurthy is the Founder Trustee of
ORCF which comes out from Ex.R13 which is the Trust Deed of ORCF and the payment reflected in
the account statement at Ex.R2(a) could be construed as payment being made by the Founder
Trustee of ORCF. However, that by itself would not alter the factum of issuance of Policy in terms of
Ex.P80 in the name of KMSS, as all the receipts for payment of premia viz., Adjustment Voucher at
Ex.P81, Advance Premium Deposit Receipts at Ex.P82 to Ex.P85 are issued in the name of
"KAMMAGONDANAHALLI SRI MARUTHI SEVA SAMITHI(R)."
41. The specific stand of respondent No.1 in the written statement was to the effect that ORCF which
is a Trust has entered into a MoU with KMSS, according to which there was an understanding
whereby the KMSS was required to furnish data to ORCF which would pay premium for the
policy10. However, the said MoU has not been placed before the Court or summoned from the
custody of the person who is in possession of the same in order to establish the assertion regarding
the MoU and the limited role of KMSS insofar as the Medi Assist Policy is concerned.
42. As regards the MoU, the respondent No.1 who is examined as RW.1 was specifically asked and
his response to the same is as follows:
"Question:
Have you seen the Memorandum of
Understanding?
Answer:
They have shown a letter. It is false to state that I have not seen the Memorandum of
Understanding. I have seen the same."
¶ 4 and 5 of the written statement, which is of relevance are as follows:
"4. As per the information furnished by the Kammagondanahalli Sri Maruti Seva
Samithi to the Respondent No. I in respect of the issue of Medi Assist policies, it is
learnt by the Respondent No. I that, The One Rupee Charity Foundation Trust had
entered into an understanding with the Kammagondanahalli Sri Maruti Seva Samithi
and as per the Memorandum of Understanding, the Kammagondanahalli Sri Maruti
Seva Samithi has to furnish the data with regard to the poor students residing in its
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 17
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
jurisdiction to the One Rupee Charity Foundation Trust and the One Rupee Charity
Foundation Trust thereafter pays the premium for the poor students and issues
Medical Health Policy to the poor students .
5. The Respondent No. l further submits that even the NGO named as One Rupee
Charity Foundation Trust had issued the Mediclaim policies after entering into an
understanding with Kammagondanahalli Sri Maruti Seva Samithi prior to the
Gazette Notification issued by the Election Commission of lndia on 27.03.2018 ."
43. It is relevant to notice simultaneously the evidence of Sri Kishore Varadachari, who was
examined as RW.2 and who is a Trustee of ORCF, has specifically stated in his examination-in-chief
recorded on 04.04.2022 as follows:-
"The understanding between One Rupee
Charity Foundation and Kammgondanahalli Sri
Maruthi Seva Samithi was in the nature of written understanding.
The written understanding between the One Rupee Charity Foundation and Kammgondanahalli Sri
Maruthi Seva Samithi which was in my possession was handed over to Tumakuru Rural Police
Station in connection with the investigation of the case.
All the documents given by Kammgondanahalli Sri Maruthi Seva Samithi were handed over to the
police authorities and whatever documents we gave in the form of proposal, etc., to the
Kammgondanahalli Sri Maruthi Seva Samithi was in possession of Sri Chennigappa."
44. It is clear from the stand of RW.1 that there was a Memorandum of Understanding. It is the
stand of RW.1 also that it was the understanding that KMSS would furnish data to ORCF. If it is the
case that the role of KMSS insofar as the policy is concerned was only limited to the furnishing of
data of students to ORCF which would further take steps to obtain policy, which is also the stand
taken by RW.2 and there was no other role of KMSS, then the best evidence available to support
such assertion was the Memorandum of Understanding between KMSS and ORCF.
45. As pointed out above, the existence of MoU has been asserted by RW.1 as well as RW.2. As it is
the case put forward by RW.2 that the copy of MoU had been submitted to the Police Authorities
and in light of specific assertion by RW.1 in the written statement as well as in his deposition
regarding the MoU, the burden of proving the scope of MoU rested on RW.1. Further, once Ex.P80
reveals that policy is taken in the name of KMSS and by way of a counter it is stated that premium is
paid by ORCF and that limited role of KMSS was only to furnish data to ORCF and nothing more,
the onus shifts on RW.1 to prove such an assertion as regards the scope of MoU which could be
accomplished only by the production of MoU by taking steps to have the same produced from the
custody of Police Authorities as stated by RW2. No steps have been taken by RW.1 to summon the
said MoU and it could be concluded that the onus on RW.1 regarding the assertion of limited role of
KMSS vis-à-vis the Medi Assist policies does not stand discharged. In fact, not taking appropriate
steps for summoning such documents which would support the case of respondent No.1 would lead
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 18
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
to drawing an adverse inference as it could be construed that no steps were taken to summon the
MoU, as the said document if produced may reveal material contrary to their stand.
46. It is also relevant to note that as regards the scope of MoU stated to have been entered into
between KMSS and ORCF, the non-examination of Sri T.L. Krishnamurthy who was the Founder
Trustee and from whose account amount asserted to be premia has been transferred to the M/s.
New India Assurance Co. Ltd., calls for drawing an adverse inference against KMSS and respondent
No.1. The evidence of Sri T.L.Krishnamurthy would have had the effect of clarifying the issue insofar
as MoU is concerned.
47. Once it is the specific stand of respondent No.1 that there was an understanding that KMSS
would share data with ORCF regarding the students, it would indicate the willingness of KMSS to
collaborate with ORCF as regards Medi Assist Policy. In the absence of MoU being produced and
eventually policy being issued in the name of KMSS as per Ex.P80, there can be no doubt regarding
the existence of policy and the respondents have failed to prove their assertion that the
understanding between KMSS and ORCF was only as regards the limited role of providing data of
school students to facilitate obtaining of policy and not beyond such limited understanding.
48. However, the payment of premia by third party other than the insured does not have the effect of
altering the policy holder as the policy depicts the name of the insured as KMSS and the premium
receipts are still issued in the name of KMSS. Accordingly, it is held that Medi Assist Policy has been
taken in the name of KMSS. ASSOCIATION OF RESPONDENT NO.1 WITH KMSS
49. A significant contention raised is that the respondent No.1 had nothing to do with KMSS and
even if KMSS has committed a lapse, he has nothing to do with it.
50. It is the specific defence that the respondent No.1 had severed ties with the family, that he had
executed Release Deed and was residing separately and had nothing to do with KMSS, which was
allegedly controlled by his family.
51. What requires to be determined is as to whether KMSS with the consent of respondent No.1 has
acted in a manner so as to benefit the respondent No.1 in issuance of Medi Assist Policy.
52. The execution of Release Deed is stated to be of the year 2007, dated 19.05.2007 and is produced
as Ex.R9. Even if the same is admitted, it would by itself not have any effect, if otherwise it is
demonstrated that KMSS which admittedly is controlled by the family has acted in a manner so as to
benefit the respondent No.1. An aspect of relevance would be as to whether the family members
nursed any animosity against respondent No.1 and in the absence of which, it would be the common
course of human conduct of other members of the family to support respondent No.1 and enhance
his prospects in the election, if relevant facts are demonstrated which would be a permissible
presumption under Section 114 of the Indian Evidence Act.
53. The fact that the office bearers of KMSS are family members of respondent No.1 is not in dispute
and has come out during evidence. RW.1 in his cross- examination recorded on 25.02.2022 has
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 19
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
deposed as follows:-
"My father's name is found at Sl.No.1 of Ex.P5 which relates to list of office bearers of
Kammagondanahalli Sri Maruthi Seva Samithi ... the name G.S.Siddagangamma
shown at Sl.No.6 is of my mother ..."
54. The persons at Sl.No.1 Sri C.Chennigappa is the father; Sl.No.2 Sri D.C.Venugopal is the brother;
Sl.No.4 Smt.G.H.Siddagangamma is the mother.
55. Though the Release Deed is stated to have been executed in 2007, it is a document between
respondent No.1 and other members of the family. The respondent No.1 (RW.1) states in his
cross-examination as follows:-
"there are four houses where I am staying ... In the other houses in the compound,
my mother and my younger brother stay."
This would indicate that the brother and mother of respondent No.1 are staying in close vicinity. The
above would indicate that the members of the family are on cordial terms and there would be a
presumption permissible to be drawn taking note of common course of human conduct in the
absence of any other fact to indicate animosity amongst them being presented before the Court.
Accordingly, it can be stated that the KMSS has acted to further the interest of the respondent No.1
in the act of taking out the Medi Assist Policy.
56. The admitted fact of entering into an understanding with ORCF by KMSS in order to share data
of students and further understanding that the premia would be paid by the ORCF even as per the
stand of respondent No.1 in the written statement would indicate that there was an intention of
having Medi Assist Policies to be taken in the name of students11. It must be noted that KMSS has
its Office situated at Abbigere which is in Bengaluru City, that predominantly the policies were taken
benefiting the students studying in Tumkur Rural Constituency during the Para-4 of the written
statement reads as follows:-
"4. As per the information furnished by the Kammagondanahalli Sri Maruti Seva
Samithi to the Respondent No. I in respect of the issue of Medi Assist policies, it is
learnt by the Respondent No. I that, The One Rupee Charity Foundation Trust had
entered into an understanding with the Kammagondanahalli Sri Maruti Seva Samithi
and as per the Memorandum of Understanding, the Kammagondanahalli Sri Maruti
Seva Samithi has to furnish the data with regard to the poor students residing in its
jurisdiction to the One Rupee Charity Foundation Trust and the One Rupee Charity
Foundation Trust thereafter pays the premium for the poor students and issues
Medical Health Policy to the poor students ."
time coinciding with election to Tumkur Rural Constituency wherein the respondent No.1 was
contesting, and the timing of such activity and geographical location of the schools as regards
students of which policies were taken; all of such would lead to a logical deduction that KMSS had
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 20
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
taken up this task of facilitating issuance of Medi Assist Policy to help the respondent No.1. Even if it
is assumed that the premium of policy was paid by ORCF which would not have the effect of altering
Ex.P80, the whole exercise of taking Medi Assist Policy in the name of students who were
predominantly belonging to Tumkur Rural Constituency as would come out from the majority of
Medi Assist cards marked as Ex.P23 series would only indicate that willingness of KMSS to act in
support of the respondent No.1 so as to promote his election prospects.
57. Accordingly, it is held that respondent No.1 is associated with KMSS.
58. The aspect as to whether the action of KMSS was with the consent of respondent No.1 has been
considered separately.
CANCELLATION OF MEDI ASSIST POLICY
59. Insofar as issue No.ii(d) is concerned, the factum of cancellation of policy is admitted. In terms
of Ex.P42, which is an Email correspondence by Ms.Preetha, an employee of M/s. New India
Assurance Co. Ltd., communicating to PW-2, brother of petitioner that Sri Devendra Prasad,
Divisional Manager, had been advised to issue cancellation notice as per internal guidelines. In
terms of Ex.P87, the policy has been cancelled with effect from 08.05.2018 and the premium has
been refunded. The said document issued by M/s.New India Assurance Co. Ltd., is conclusive of the
factum of cancellation and is not in dispute. The reason assigned for cancellation as enumerated in
Ex.P87 is that the policy was cancelled as there was "NO INSURABLE INTEREST IN THE
STUDENTS COVERED AS ALSO THE GROUP OF STUDENTS COVERED DO NOT FALL UNDER
THE DEFINITION OF irdai SPECIFIED HOMOGENOUS GROUP."
60. It is made out from the correspondences exchanged between employees of M/s. New India
Assurance Co. Ltd., and Sri Ramesh Bettaiah and the PMO that the Medi Assist Policy was cancelled
at the instance of Sri Ramesh Bettaiah. The correspondence between PW2 and M/s. New India
Assurance Co. Ltd., is marked as Ex.P33 to Ex.P38. This fact has been spoken to by PW.10 Sri
Kittuswamy, Regional Manager, M/s.New India Assurance Co. Ltd., who has got marked the Medi
Assist Policy cancellation document as Ex.P87. However, the assertion of the petitioner regarding its
cancellation is not so much the factum of cancellation, but the reason for such cancellation which
the petitioner seeks to take benefit of by contending that the policy came to be cancelled only on the
ground of it being capable of misuse during election period.
61. After cancellation of the Medi Assist Policy with effect from 08.05.2018 in terms of Ex.P90(f),
though PW.2 had issued a statement in 'Prajavani' newspaper to the effect that the Medi Assist
Policy was cancelled on the ground of misuse, however in terms of the media report covering the
statement of Sri Mahesh, President JD(S) Yuva Morcha, an assertion was made that policy was
taken out keeping in mind the health benefit of the local people and that many beneficiaries had
taken benefit of the same and were in fact present in the press conference. Copy of which is marked
as Ex.P11(a).
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 21
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
62. No doubt, the content of Exhibits P10(a) and P11(a) cannot be taken note of as being conclusive
proof regarding the incidents narrated but could be taken note of only for the purpose of inferring
that the issue regarding cancellation was in public domain as on 09.05.2018 [Ex.P10(a)] and on
11.05.2018 [Ex.P11(a)], both of which were prior to the date of polling on 12.05.2018. The
contradictory stand taken in Exhibits-P10 and P11 regarding the cancellation and absence of any
clarification by M/s. New India Assurance Co. Ltd. and KMSS, or any stand by respondent No.1
distancing himself from the Medi Assist cards alleged to have been issued with his consent, while
further noticing that no effort was made by M/s. New India Assurance Co. Ltd. or the Authorities to
withdraw the Medi Assist cards has had the effect of continuance of impression in the minds of
those who had received the Medi Assist cards regarding its benefits and accordingly its capability of
enticing the voters as on the polling date continued. Accordingly, though the issue as to whether the
Medi Assist Policy was cancelled on the basis of complaints is answered in the affirmative, it in fact
has no effect insofar as the capability of Medi Assist cards to act as an object of enticement.
63. Accordingly, the issue Nos.2(d) and (v) are answered in the affirmative. As regards issue
No.ii(c), a part of the issue that KMSS has taken out policies on the wards of the voters, the issue is
held in the affirmative. However, there is no direct evidence of KMSS distributing the policies
directly and the portion of the issue regarding KMSS having distributed the policies is held in the
negative, though it may have facilitated such distribution as circumstances are made out as per
discussion infra. PART - C
64. Issue No.(iii) is taken up for consideration and the issue framed is as follows:
"WHETHER THE PETITIONER PROVES THAT THE RESPONDENT NO.1,
ELECTION AGENTS AND THE PERSONS ASSOCIATED OR CLAIMING
THROUGH HIM HAVE COMMITTED ANY OTHER CORRUPT PRACTICE AS
MADE OUT IN THE PETITION WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 123 OF R.P.
ACT ?"
65. The election of a returned candidate could be declared to be void by the High Court, if a corrupt
practice has been committed by the returned candidate, his election agent/any other person with the
consent of the returned candidate in terms of Section 100(1)(b) of the R.P. Act12.
100. Grounds for declaring election to be void.--(1) Subject to the provisions of sub-section (2) if the
High Court is of opinion--
(b) that any corrupt practice has been committed by a returned candidate or his election agent or by
any other person with the consent of a returned candidate or his election agent;
the High Court shall declare the election of the returned candidate to be void.
66. Section 123 of the R.P. Act provides for what would constitute corrupt practice and what is of
relevance in the present case is the definition of 'bribery'. The relevant portion of Section 123 is
extracted hereinbelow:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 22
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
"123. Corrupt practices.--The following shall be deemed to be corrupt practices for
the purposes of this Act:--
(1) "Bribery", that is to say--
(A) any gift, offer or promise by a candidate or his agent or by any other person with
the consent of a candidate or his election agent of any gratification, to any person
whomsoever, with the object, directly or indirectly of inducing--
(a) xxx
(b) an elector to vote or refrain from voting at an election, or as a reward to--
(i) xxx
(ii) an elector for having voted or refrained from voting;"
Accordingly, any gift or offer of gratification to any person with the object of directly or indirectly
inducing the elector to vote at the election in favour of the candidate from whom enticement has
been made would amount to bribery.
67. Section 123(1)(B) provides 'bribery' that would include the receipt of any gratification with the
purpose of directly or indirectly inducing the elector to vote and the Explanation provides for a
wider understanding of 'gratification' and includes all forms of gratifications 'estimable in money'.
The relevant portion of Section 123 is extracted hereinbelow:-
Section 123 - (1) xxx (A) xxx (B) the receipt of, or agreement to receive, any
gratification, whether as a motive or a reward--
(a) xxx
(b) by any person whomsoever for himself or any other person for voting or
refraining from voting, or inducing or attempting to induce any elector to vote or
refrain from voting, or any candidate to withdraw or not to withdraw his candidature.
Explanation.--For the purposes of this clause the term "gratification" is not restricted to pecuniary
gratifications or gratifications estimable in money and it includes all forms of entertainment and all
forms of employment for reward but it does not include the payment of any expenses bona fide
incurred at, or for the purpose of, any election and duly entered in the account of election expenses
referred to in section 78."
68. In the present case, the alleged corrupt practice is the distribution of Medi Assist cards by
agents/Party workers/other persons with the express quid pro quo of the recipient voting for the
returned candidate. MEDI ASSIST POLICY AND CORRUPT PRACTICE
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 23
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
69. The Medi Assist Policies were designed such that the expenses upto the limit of Rs.10,000/-
relating to sickness of children is covered under the policy.
70. In terms of the definition of 'bribery', the delivery of the policy to the parents of the children
could be either: (a) gift or offer of gratification with the object of inducing the electors to vote. The
delivery of Medi Assist Cards pursuant to the policy would constitute the gift or offer. (b) It could
also constitute gratification estimable in money, as medical expenses upto Rs.10,000/- of children
was covered under the Medi Assist Policies to be invoked by the parents who are the electors.
71. Accordingly, the same could fall within the definition of 'corrupt practice' under Section 123 of
the R.P. Act. It must be noted that the inducement could also be indirect and could be gathered from
circumstances.
72. The aforesaid aspect including the meaning of 'gift' in the context of R.P. Act and manner of
proof of bribery as well as the contention that there must be a bargain between the returned
candidate and the electors has been adverted to by the Apex Court in C. Narayanaswamy v. C.K.
Jaffer Sharief and Others13 and the observations made by the Apex Court are as follows:-
"6. The next aspect which needs examination is as to whether before arranging any
such mass feeding, or in course thereof, the factum of any negotiation between the
electors on one side, and (1994) Supp.(3) SCC 170 candidate or his agent or any
person arranging such mass feeding on behalf and with the consent of the candidate
or his election agent on the other side has to be proved. The framers of the Act while
specifying as to what shall be deemed to be 'bribery', did not provide that the
negotiation between the candidate or his agent or any other person with the consent
of such candidate or his election agent on the one hand and the electors on the other
should be proved. Section 123(1)(A) says that any gift, offer or promise by a candidate
or his agent or any other person with the consent of such candidate or his election
agent, of any gratification made to the elector "with the object, directly or indirectly
of inducing" such an elector to vote, shall be deemed to be 'bribery'. Section 123(1)(A)
does not require the electors to express or convey their acceptance or assurance that
they shall vote for such candidate. On the material on record, of course the court has
to be satisfied that such gift, offer or promise of any gratification has been made to
the electors with the object directly or indirectly to induce the electors to vote in
favour of such candidate. A nexus between the gift, offer or promise of gratification
and the inducement to vote has to be established. This can be established even by
circumstantial evidence. The election petitioner is not required to prove any direct
negotiation between the candidate or his agent on the one hand and the electors on
the other.
7. In the case of S.B. Adityan v. S. Kandaswami [AIR 1958 SC 857 : (1958) 2 MLJ (SC)
187] , it was said:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 24
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
"The words 'gift, offer or promise by a candidate or his agent or by any other person'
clearly show that what is contemplated is the making of a gift. These words are wholly
inappropriate to describe the acceptance of a gift. The words 'with the object, directly
or indirectly, of inducing' also indicate that only the making of a gift is contemplated,
for the object is of the person making the gift, and clearly not of the person accepting
it."
8. ...
9. But before the charge of bribery, as contemplated in Section 123(1)(A) of the Act, is held to have
been proved, against the candidate concerned, because of mass feeding arranged by him or his agent
or any other person with his consent or the consent of his election agent, it must be established that
the object of such mass feeding was directly or indirectly to induce the electors to vote in favour of
such candidate. In some cases, on material being produced, this charge can be established directly if
the candidate or his agent or any other person with the consent of the candidate or his election
agent, at such mass feeding of the electors, seeks their support and votes at the election in question.
But there may be cases, where the inducement to vote is not direct but only indirect one. The
candidate or his agent or any other person who has arranged such mass feedings with the consent of
the candidate or his election agent, may not make a direct appeal to the electors either before,
during or after the feast."
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST PALANETHRAIAH
73. It has been averred in the Election Petition that on 11.05.2018, a day prior to the election at 9.00
p.m., the FST-II Squad had visited Gulur, Hebbur Hobli and when it was approaching K.Palasandra
Village, Scorpio vehicle bearing registration No.KA-06-N-2725 was intercepted. It is submitted that
the vehicle was abandoned by the inmates and the Squad was able to seize the following: (a) Scorpio
vehicle bearing registration No.KA-06-N-2725 (b) Note Book where JD(S) was written; (c) JD(S)
Students' indemnity letter14; (d) xxx (e) Eight pages containing names of Booth Level workers and
their telephone numbers; (f) A bundle of Rs.500/- notes totaling Rs.50,000/-; (g) One Cheque Book

sum of Rs.1,000/- as fine and has produced Certified Copy of P.F.No.31/2018 along with other
documents.
can be construed to be Medi Asisst bond which is a contextual interpretation keeping in mind the
facts and circumstances
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 25
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
76. It was specifically averred in the affidavit that Sri Palanethraiah was the Counting Agent of
respondent No.1 and the other three accused were JD(S) Party workers and agents of respondent
No.1.
77. It must be noted that insofar as the proceedings in Crime No.0073/2018, P.F.No.31/2018 which
reflected the list of seized items was marked as Ex.P26, which indicates the seizure of the
following:--
a) Scorpio vehicle bearing registration No.KA-06-N-2725;
b) xxxx
c) JD(S) student Indemnity Letter;
d) xxxx
e) Eight pages containing details of Booth
Level workers with telephone numbers;
f) Currency Notes of Rs.500/- denomination of 100 notes totaling to an amount of
Rs.50,000/-;
g) Cheque Book consisting of 12 empty cheque leaves of Canara Bank belonging to
Palanethraiah.G S/o Gangappa;
h) Pass Book relating to A/c
No.0474101036881 belonging to
Palanethraiah.G S/o Gangappa;
78. After investigation, charge sheet came to be filed in Crime No.0073/2018 for the
offence under Section 171E of IPC. The said charge sheet was marked as Ex.P27 by
PW.1. After taking cognizance under Section 190(1)(b) of Cr.P.C. for the offence
under Section 171E of IPC, summons was issued to the accused. The charges were
framed by the Court as regards to the alleged offence made out from the material on
record, which was read out and the accused Palanethraiah and accused Nos.2, 3 and
4 pleaded guilty.
The charges framed and proceedings relating to pleading guilty is extracted as below:-

79. It is clear from the charges framed which are specific that while the Flying Squad was on rounds,
they intercepted a Scorpio vehicle bearing registration No. KA-06-N-2725 and that money was being
ferried in the vehicle in order to distribute the same to the voters on behalf of JD(S) Party during the
time the Code of Conduct was notified by the Election Commission which was in force and that the
accused abandoned the vehicle and ran away and upon inspection, the material stated in
P.F.No.31/2018 referred to above was seized and accordingly, accused had committed an offence
under Section 171E of IPC.
80. As regards such charge, the accused having pleaded guilty leads to the conclusion that the
charges are proved. Upon conviction for the offence under Section 171E of IPC, the proceedings in
the said case came to be concluded and records would indicate that Sri Palanethraiah
- accused No.1 had obtained an order for release of his Scorpio vehicle15 by filing an application
under Section 451 r/w 457 of Cr.P.C.
81. The legal consequence that emanates from the judgment of the trial Court16 in which the
accused has pleaded guilty, when such judgment comes up for bearing registration
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 27
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
No.KA-06-N-2725 consideration in other proceedings would be that the accused has admitted the
contents of the charge made out. The validity of such judgment cannot be sought to be reopened in
collateral proceedings.
82. The submission that the order passed sentencing the accused on the basis of his pleading guilty
has been challenged in Criminal Appeal No.15/2023 after a delay of about five years and only during
the pendency of the present proceedings, would not take away the effect of the judgment as it stands
today, in the absence of any stay of the judgment and order of sentence passed in
C.C.No.3079/2018.
83. Insofar as the defence relating to the allegation made against Sri Palanethraiah as being a
Counting Agent of respondent No.1, it is asserted that the Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961
prescribes the procedure of appointment of Counting Agents and Form-18 is the prescribed format,
which has not been produced.
84. It must be noted that PW.1 has produced and marked Ex.P32 (Pages 784 to 791 are collectively
marked as Ex.P32) which is an Endorsement certifying the Counting Agents for Tumkur Rural
Assembly Constituency for the elections of 2018. The said Endorsement reads as follows:-
75 PART - C
85. The endorsement dated 27.11.2019 is enclosed alongwith the list of Counting Agents and
contains the name of Sri Palanethraiah. G. The said document is signed on behalf of Tahsildar and
the covering sheet to the list is the endorsement furnishing the information of Counting Agents as
has been sought for, under Right to Information Act, 2005.
86. The further contention raised at the time of argument is that Rule 52 of the Conduct of Elections
Rules, 1961 deals with the appointment of Counting Agents and stipulates that appointment can be
made in accordance with Form-18 and accordingly, the petitioner ought to have produced Form-18.
87. It must be noted that the RTI response issued by the Tahsildar is clear as regards furnishing of
information consisting of the list of Counting Agents for Tumkur Rural Assembly Constituency as
regards the elections in the year 2018. The covering letter furnishing information is signed by the
Tahsildar, the list enclosed also bears the signature of Tahsildar. The presumption under Section 114
of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 would apply as regards such documents issued by Public Authority.
Illustration (e) to Section 114 enables raising a presumption that official acts have been regularly
performed. Insofar as the candidate Sri D.C.Gowrishankar amongst others whose names are
enumerated as Counting Agents, the name of Sri Palanethraiah. G is found. If Ex.P32 is taken note
of which is clear, it would indicate that Sri Palanethraiah. G was a Counting Agent of respondent
No.1.
88. The mere say that it is a fabricated document is not sufficient to disbelieve the said document.
No doubt, there may be records that are required to be maintained in Form-18 containing the list of
Counting Agents, but the non-furnishing of the said Form-18 by itself would be no ground to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 28
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
disbelieve the response of RTI, produced and marked at Ex.P32.
89. Once the document bearing the signature of Tahsildar who is a public official is issued
containing the list of Counting Agents, which list is also signed on behalf of Tahsildar and bears his
seal, there is no reason to doubt the genuineness of such document, more so, in light of presumption
under Section 114 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.
90. Once the petitioner has produced and marked Ex P.32 which has been appreciated above, the
petitioner has discharged his burden and the onus then shifts on respondent No.1, who was in a
position to establish that Palanethraiah was not his Counting Agent by taking steps to produce
Form-18 from proper custody and prove his assertion. In fact, the Apex Court has also noticed the
role of a person contending that no corrupt practice was made out and steps to be taken, in M.
Narayana Rao v. G. Venkata Reddy17 wherein, it has been observed that the person cannot keep
silent and the relevant extract is as follows:
(1977) 1 SCC 771 "19. xxx (1) That the charge of commission of corrupt practice has to
be proved and established beyond doubt like a criminal charge or a quasi-criminal
charge but not exactly in the manner of establishment of the guilt in a criminal
prosecution giving the liberty to the accused to keep mum. The charge has to be
proved on appraisal of the evidence adduced by both sides especially by the election
petitioner."
DISTRIBUTION OF MEDI ASSIST CARDS
91. The stand of the petitioner is that the Medi Assist cards were distributed to induce the voters to
vote for respondent No.1 and had resulted in respondent No.1 securing large number of votes
eventually leading to his victory and the details of distribution between 25.04.2018 to 11.05.2018
along with the persons involved in such distribution is detailed in the petition. It is further asserted
that the factum of cancellation of Medi Assist Policies was never intimated to the public, by which
time the inducement was complete18.
92. It is further asserted that though the Medi Assist Policy was cancelled, a Press Meet was held by
Sri Mahesh, President Of JD(S) Yuva Morcha on 11.05.2018, who is stated to have admitted that
17,000 students had been insured and the said Press Meet was covered by the Media in 'Prajavani'
as well as 'Tumkur Varthe'.
93. The respondent No.1 in his written statement while disowning the connection with KMSS has
specifically taken a stand as reflected in para-24 of the written statement regarding the distribution
of Medi Assist cards as follows:-
The relevant portion of paras-33 and 34 of the petition are extracted hereinbelow:-
"33. ...The action of first respondent in distributing the Medi Assist ID cards to each
house in which the students were residing was clearly an act to induce the voters in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 29
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
that particular house to vote for first respondent. Petitioner believes that the
inducement effected by the first respondent worked out to large extent and large
number of voters residing in various villages did vote for first respondent because of
the inducement and that resulted in the first respondent securing large number of
votes leading to his victory in the election. The distribution of Medi Assist ID cards
were effected between 25.4.2018 to 11.5.2018 at different times by the following JDS
workers...
34. It is submitted that the factum of cancellation of the policies was never intimated
to the public at large and the damage that was sought to be done with the aid of
insurance policies and large scale distribution of Medi assist Cards have already been
distributed by the respondent and his agents who were canvassing for him and luring
the public for vote in the elections in favour of 1st respondent, since their children
will be benefited upto Rs.10,000 /- for medical treatment."
"24. ... The NGO named as One Rupee Charity Foundation after obtaining data from
the Kammagondanahalli Sri Maruti Seva Trust had issued Medi Assist Card covering
health benefit upto Rs. l0,000/- to the poor students from the period 26.02.2018 to
25.02.2019... Instead, they had discovered the Medi Assist card in the house of
Gopalaiah in respect of Kum.Nirmala and in the house of Sri Shivashankar in respect
of his daughter Kum.Likitha after the same was being distributed by the NGO One
Rupee Charity Foundation and accordingly false allegations were alleged against the
Respondent No.1. Even the documents produced as Annexure-L and M are not legal
and valid documents and the same do not have any evidential value under the eye of
Law."
94. The above statement in the written statement is a clear admission as regards the distribution of
Medi Assist cards, though it is the stand that the distribution was done by ORCF. The last sentence
regarding Annexures-'L' and 'M' (Medi Assist cards) not being legal and valid document and not
having evidentiary value does not have the effect of watering down the unambiguous admission in
the pleading itself regarding distribution. The said contention regarding the validity of Medi Assist
cards has been considered infra at paras-103 to 105.
95. Sri Kishore Varadhachari, the Trustee of ORCF has been examined as RW2, who admits the
downloading of 150 Medi Assist cards from the C.D. and he has deposed as hereunder in the
cross-examination:-
"I have received copies of the Medi-Assist Policies by way of C.D. from Medi-Assist
TPA Services. About 150 cards were downloaded from the C.D and I could not
download any more as there was an error. I was unable to download other cards from
the C.D., as at the time of downloading an error appeared."
The further stand in the deposition which may have a bearing on the aspect of distribution is as
follows:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 30
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
"Out of 150 cards that were downloaded, about 10 cards relating to Tumakuru were
retained by me and the remaining cards were given to Sri Narasimhamurthy and Sri
Ananthu and I had told them to keep the said cards with them which could be
distributed after all other cards are received."
96. It is to be noticed that (a) Sri Lakshminarayana examined as PW3 has taken the stand that
Ex.P52 is the Medi Assist card issued in the name of his son was given by Sri Arehalli Manjunath
who is a JD(S) Party worker; (b) Sri Mahadevaiah examined as PW5 has stated that Sri
Krishnegowda and Smt.Renukamma, who were JD(S) Party workers had come to his house in the
month of April 2018 and gathered information regarding his daughter and subsequently three days
prior to the election, Sri Krishnegowda and Smt.Renukamma had handed over the bonds and the
copy of said Medi Assist Policy was marked as Ex.P63; (c) Sri D.R. Ramesh examined as PW6, who
was a resident of Doddasarangipalya has produced the Medi Assist card and stated to have been
given by Sri Krishnegowda and Smt.Renukamma, both belonging to JD(S) Party and the said

given by Sri Arehalli Manjunath and Smt.Sunandamma, both belonging to JD(S) Party and the
document is marked as Ex.P76.
97. Each of these witnesses have produced corroborative material to demonstrate that the School in
which the child was studying and other documents to demonstrate the correctness of description of
the child in the Medi Assist cards by relying on the other documents. The following Table would
indicate such of the details referred to above:

98. Though it is contended that these witnesses are interested witnesses and are brought at the
instance of petitioner, the conclusive finding relating to the distribution of Medi Assist cards is
arrived at after appreciation of entirety of the evidence and noticing that PW3, PW5, PW6 and PW8
have withstood the cross-examination.
99. The fact of distribution of policies is admitted in terms of para-24 of the written statement
averment of respondent No.1. This admission if read in conjunction with evidence of RW2, whose
admission is to the extent that about 150 Medi Assist cards were downloaded from the CDs and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 31
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
printed and handed over to Sri Narasimha Murthy and Sri Anantha and the production of the Medi
Assist cards by PW3, PW5, PW6 and PW8 and the names of their children and the Schools in which
they are studying indicating the correctness of description in the Medi Assist cards, the withstanding
of cross-examination by all the above mentioned witnesses, the above evidence when evaluated in its
entirety, it could be concluded that the Medi Assist Policies have been distributed in the villages
falling within Tumkur Rural Constituency. The denials made do not outweigh the entirety of
evidence produced by the petitioner nor does it lead to any doubt in the version of petitioner.
100. Curiously RW3 - Sri Rangaswamy has deposed on behalf of respondent No.1 taking a specific
stand that Sri Narashima Murthy, husband of BJP Zilla Panchayat Member, had visited his house in
the month of March 2018 along with persons from ORCF and BJP leaders and distributed the Medi
Assist cards including to his two children and the said documents were marked as Ex.R21 and
Ex.R22. This stand would also indicate unequivocally relating to the distribution of Medi Assist
Policies.
101. Though it is the contention that Sri Narashima Murthy was a BJP Party worker who had
distributed the Medi Assist Policy, the said assertion has not been raised in the pleadings. This
evidence of RW3 appears to be an afterthought so as to improve the case of respondent No.1 after
having seen the stand and the evidence of petitioner and accordingly, it cannot be given due
credence and is to be disbelieved. No doubt, RW3 has contended that distribution is in March 2018,
prior to the date of nomination. However, while appreciating the acts of distribution of Medi Assist
Policies subsequent to the date of nomination, the act of issuance of Medi Assist Policies on
26.02.2018, and distribution thereafter, i.e. just before polling date by Noticees as asserted by PW3,
PW5, PW6 and PW8 form an important and inseparable chain of events and if all these acts referred
to are appreciated in its entirety, the pattern of taking out the policy and its distribution form a
chain of circumstances establishing the commission of corrupt practice.
102. The aspect as to the role of agents/Party workers/any other person having obtained and
distributed the Medi Assist cards with the consent of the respondent No.1 has been dealt with in the
discussion infra. In light of the above, the material on record requires to be looked into.
MEDI ASSIST CARDS AND ENTICEMENT
103. The Medi Assist cards were stated to have been issued pursuant to issuance of Medi Assist
Policy and the TPA is stated to have given a C.D. containing e-cards and from the C.D., about "150
files" are stated to have been downloaded as per the deposition of RW.2-Kishore Vardhachari. It is
stated that about 150 e-cards were jointly given to Sri Ananthu and Sri Narasimha Murthy. The
reference to distribution must be construed as distribution of Medi Assist cards. PW3, PW5, PW6
and PW8 have also produced the Medi Assist cards and stated to have been distributed to them.
104. Though the validity of said Medi Assist cards has been assailed and Sri Devendra Prasad. A
(PW.11), Divisional Manager of M/s.New India Assurance Co. Ltd., refuses to vouch with respect to
the authenticity of said Medi Assist cards, what is required to be noted is that the fact of issuance of
Medi Assist Policy is not in doubt. The Medi Assist Policy contains the details of TPA (Third Party
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 32
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
Administrator). In the policy marked as Ex.P80, the details of TPA point out that 'Medi Assist
Insurance TPA Private Limited' would service the policy, the details of the same TPA is found in the
Medi Assist cards marked as Ex.P23 series as well as Ex.R15 series.
105. The Medi Assist cards by itself being a document purporting to reflect the details of Medi Assist
Policy which have been held out by those who have distributed these e-cards to be a document
which would enable enforcement of the Medi Assist Policy, even if it is not proved that the Medi
Assist cards were issued by the TPA, the document having the capability of enticing cannot be
denied. The e-cards (Medi Assist cards) being traced back to the Medi Assist Policy would be
sufficient to attribute to it the objective of enticing the voters and there is no other utility of the
e-cards beyond this.
CONSENT OF RETURNED CANDIDATE/RESPONDENT NO.1:-
106. The consent of returned candidate for the acts done by persons other than the candidate and
other than the election agent is a prerequisite to hold a returned candidate liable for corrupt
practice.
107. Sections 100 and 123 of the R.P. Act are of relevance and are extracted hereunder:-
"100. Grounds for declaring election to be void.--

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 33
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
(2) If in the opinion of the High Court, a returned candidate has been guilty by an
agent, other than his election agent, of any corrupt practice but the High Court is

(c) that the candidate and his election agent took all reasonable means for preventing
the commission of corrupt practices at the election; and
(d) that in all other respects the election was free from any corrupt practice on the
part of the candidate or any of his agents, then the High Court may decide that the
election of the returned candidate is not void.
123. Corrupt practices.--The following shall be deemed to be corrupt practices for the purposes of
this Act:--
(1) "Bribery", that is to say--
(A) any gift, offer or promise by a candidate or his agent or by any other person with
the consent of a candidate or his election agent of any gratification, to any person
whomsoever, with the object, directly or indirectly of inducing--
(a) xxx
(b) an elector to vote or refrain from voting at an election, or as a reward to--
(i) xxx
(ii) an elector for having voted or refrained from voting;
(B) the receipt of, or agreement to receive, any gratification, whether as a motive or a

(a) xxx
(b) by any person whomsoever for himself or any other person for voting or

gratifications or gratifications estimable in money and it includes all forms of entertainment and all
forms of employment for reward but it does not include the payment of any expenses bona fide
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 34
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
incurred at, or for the purpose of, any election and duly entered in the account of election expenses
referred to in section 78.
(2) Undue influence, that is to say, any direct or indirect interference or attempt to interfere on the
part of the candidate or his agent, or of any other person [with the consent of the candidate or his
election agent], with the free exercise of any electoral right...."
108. The definition of 'consent' as contained in the Black's Law Dictionary is as follows:-
"A concurrence of wills. Express consent is that directly given, either lira voce or in
writing. Implied consent is that manifested by signs, actions, or facts, or by inaction
or silence, which raise a presumption that the consent has been given. Cowen v.
Paddock, 62 Hun, 022, 17 N. Y. Supp. 3SS. Consent in an act of reason, accompanied
with deliberation, the mind weighing as in a balance the good or evil on each side. 1
Story, Eq. Jur."
109. Thus it is clear that 'consent' can be express or implied and in essence is an "act of reason
accompanied by deliberation". The 'consent' could be implied by existence of circumstances
indicating approval for action of others, non- taking of positive action to prohibit commission of acts
could also be one of the circumstances and if the same is taken note of along with other
circumstances, 'consent' could be inferred.
110. The finding relating to commission of corrupt practice as made out under Sections 100 and 123
of R.P. Act by persons on behalf of respondent No.1 requires that the corrupt practice was
committed with his consent.
111. The evidence could be direct or through circumstantial. The only element of caution that is
required to be exercised while relying on circumstantial evidence is that the chain of circumstances
must not be interrupted.
112. The five golden principles (Panchsheel) that is to be followed while appreciating the burden of
proof while dealing with the circumstantial evidence is laid down by the Apex Court in Sharad
Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra.19 The observations made are as follows:-
"153. ...
(1) the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be
fully established. ...
(2) the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt
of the accused, that is to say, they should not be explainable on any other hypothesis
except that the accused is guilty, (3) the circumstances should be of a conclusive
nature and tendency, (4) they should exclude every possible hypothesis except the
one to be proved, and (5) there must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 35
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the
accused and must show that in all human probability the act must have been done by
the accused."
(1984) 4 SCC 116
113. In the present case, the aspect of consent of respondent No.1 and the corrupt practice of bribery
by Sri Arehalli Manjunath, Sri Krishnegowda, Smt.Renukamma and Smt.Sunanda is taken to be
proved by circumstantial evidence and the circumstances are as follows:-
(i) The stand of respondent No.1 is that there was MoU between ORCF and KMSS
whereby KMSS was required to furnish data of the poor students residing in its
jurisdiction20. Though the MoU is stated to have been seen by respondent No.1, the
same is not produced. The relevant deposition is as follows:-
"Question:-
Have you seen the Memorandum of
Understanding?
Answer:-
They have shown a letter.
It is false to state that I have not seen the Memorandum of Understanding. I have
seen the same."
see ¶ 7 of RW1 affidavit and ¶ 4 of written statement filed by respondent No.1.
(ii) Kishore Vardachari - RW2 the Trustee of ORCF in his deposition recorded on 04.04.2022 has
admitted that there was an understanding between ORCF and KMSS in the nature of written
understanding. It is stated that ORCF had approached KMSS for the purpose of assistance and in
that regard, they had approached Sri C. Chennigappa, father of respondent No.1 to whom the
proposal was given.
RW.2 had stated that the said document was handed over to the Police Authorities. No steps were
taken to summon the said MoU from proper custody either by respondent No.1, KMSS or by RW.2.
The said aspect has been discussed supra at para - 45.
(iii) It is the specific stand of respondent No.1 that MoU was limited only to the sharing of data. In
the absence of said MoU being produced and Medi Assist Policy being issued in the name of KMSS
as per Ex.P80, the plain understanding and best evidence is to the effect that Medi Assist Policy was
taken out in the name of KMSS.
The non-production of MoU between KMSS and ORCF leads to drawing of adverse inference and
has the effect of disbelieving the assertion of respondent No.1 that MoU was only limited to the
sharing of data of students.

Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
(iv) The refund of premium upon cancellation has been made to KMSS as is evidenced from the
refund voucher at Ex.P90.
(v) KMSS is a family controlled Society as is evidenced from the Byelaws of KMSS marked as Ex.P5
and the list containing the Members of the Executive Committee as per Ex.P6 Sri C. Chennigappa,
who was the president of KMSS at the relevant point of time was also the District President of JD(S)
Party.
(vi) The Medi Assist cards were seized as per P.F.No.31/2018 in Crime No.0073/2018. The articles
were found in the vehicle belonging to Sri.Palanethraiah with the materials indicating link with the
JD(S) Party.
The F.I.R was lodged at the instance of Sri C. Rangadhamappa, Officer of the Flying Squad with the
charge framed, which is extracted supra at para-78. Sri Palanethraiah who was accused No.1 and
other accused have pleaded guilty for the offence punishable under Section 171E of IPC.
(vii) RW2 - Kishore Varadachari, Trustee of ORCF admits that he downloaded 150 Medi Assist cards
from the C.D.
(viii) RW3 - Sri Rangaswamy admits that Medi Assist Policies were distributed by Sri Narasimha
Murthy and though it is alleged that Sri Narasimha Murthy belongs to BJP Party, the fact remains
that there is an admission relating to the distribution of Medi Assist Policies and such admission
coming from RW.3 could be taken note of.
(ix) The newspaper report at Ex.P10(a) on 09.05.2018, published in 'Prajavani' newspaper contains
the details regarding the complaint by PW2 relating to malpractice by issuance of Medi Assist
Policy.
(x) On 11.05.2018, Sri Mahesh, President of JD(S) Yuva Morcha, had specifically denied that the
said Medi Assist cards were concocted and the said stand has been reflected in the report in
'Prajavani' newspaper marked as Ex.P.11(a). On the same day, another report, Ex.P12 was published
on 12.05.2018 indicating the stand of said Sri Mahesh that action would be taken for publishing
false information published in 'Tumkur Varthe'.
All the above media reports at Ex.P10(a), Ex.P.11(a) and Ex.P.12 could not have missed the attention
of respondent No.1, as the dates of publication of Media reports were a few days preceding the date
of polling on 12.05.2018 and that forms an inference is the natural course of human conduct.
(xi) The distribution of Medi Assist Policies has also been corroborated by the parents of students
who were examined as PW.3, PW.5, PW.6 and PW.8. The said witnesses have asserted that there has
been distribution by Sri Arehalli Manjunath, Smt.Renukamma, Smt.Sunanda and Sri
Krishnegowda. The said witnesses have withstood the cross-examination and also produced the
identity cards such as detailed in the table supra at para-97, which corroborates the correctness of
entry of names of students in the Medi Assist cards marked as Exhibit P23 series, Exhibits.P52, P63,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 37
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
P68, and P76.
(xii) The handing over of Medi Assist Policies to the parents of the children who were voters was an
inducement to ensure that they would vote for the respondent No.1.
114. Accordingly issue No.(iii) is answered in the affirmative.
PART - D
115. Issue No.(iv) is taken up for consideration and the issue framed is as follows:-
(iv) WHETHER ALL ALLEGATIONS REGARDING CORRUPT PRACTICE RELATE
TO A PERIOD SUBSEQUENT TO THE NOMINATION? IF NOT, WHETHER THE
OTHER ALLEGATIONS CAN BE TAKEN NOTE OF ?
116. Insofar as the allegation of corrupt practice relating to donations made to Shanidevaru Temple
at Dasarahalli through Sri Maruthi Seva Samithi and the allegation regarding respondent No.1 by
himself or through persons associated with him having promised to distribute free seats in
Engineering College, a detailed consideration has been made while discussing Issue Nos. - ii(a) and
ii(b), while concluding that the said allegations regarding corrupt practice are prior to the
nomination. The discussion at Issue Nos. ii(a) and ii(b) are to be referred.
117. Insofar as the allegation relating to insurance policies being taken out by KMSS on the wards of
voters and distributed at the instance and on behalf of respondent No.1 and thereby committing
corrupt practice, a detailed analysis is made while answering Issue No.ii(c), which would throw light
on the present issue framed. This by itself was prior to the date of nomination.
118. In the discussion supra, it has been pointed out that Ex.P.80 is the Medi Assist Policy taken out
prior to the cut-off date. The distribution of Medi Assist cards was resorted to after the relevant date
by persons on behalf of respondent No.1 with consent and with enticement to vote for him are stand
alone corrupt practice committed after the relevant date. Meanwhile, a day before the polling date,
i.e. on 11.05.2015, the vehicle belonging to Sri Palanethraiah was intercepted and cash and Medi
Assist cards were seized amongst other things. Crime No.0073/2018 came to be filed and
Palanethraiah pleaded guilty for the offence under Section 171E of IPC.
119. The taking out of the Medi Assist Policy at Ex.P80 prior to the nomination coupled with the
incidents of distribution form a chain of events demonstrating a pattern of distribution. Except for
the above allegations referred to, there are no other allegations that can be taken note of.
120. According to the discussion made above, some of the incidents are prior and the remaining
incidents of corrupt practice are subsequent to the date of nomination in terms of the above
discussion.

Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
121. Issue No.(vii) is taken up for consideration and the issue framed is as follows:-
"(vii) WHETHER THE PETITIONER IS ENTITLED TO BE DECLARED AS
ELECTED IN PLACE OF THE FIRST RESPONDENT IN TERMS OF SECTION101
OF R.P. ACT AS A CONSEQUENTIAL RELIEF IF THE ELECTION OF THE
RETURNED CANDIDATE IS SET ASIDE ?
122. It must be noted that the number of candidates who contested were 12 candidates. The details
of candidates and the votes obtained are contained in Form-21E marked as Ex.P3 and the details are
as hereunder:-
Form-21E Return of Election Election to the Legislative Assembly from the 133
Tumkur Rural Constitutency Return of Election Sl. Name of Candidate Party

(Secular) 2 Rayasandra Ravikumar Indian National 7633 Congress 3 B.Suresh Gowda
Bharatiya Janata 77100 Party India empowerment Party T.H.
123. The question is as to whether on setting aside the election of respondent No.1 on the ground of
having committed a corrupt practice, whether the petitioner who had secured next highest number
of votes is to be declared elected?
124. The legal position is detailed by the Constitution Bench of the Apex Court in Vishwanatha
Reddy v. Konappa Rudrappa Nadgouda and Another21 at para- 12, which is extracted hereinbelow:-
"12. ...When there are only two contesting candidates, and one of them is under
statutory disqualification, votes cast in favour of the disqualified candidate may be
regarded as thrown away, irrespective of whether the voters who voted for him were
aware of the disqualification. This is not to say that where there are more than two
candidates in the field for a single seat, and one alone is disqualified, on proof of
disqualification all the votes cast in his favour will be discarded and the candidate
securing the next highest number of votes will be declared elected. In such a case, a
question of notice to the voters may assume significance, for the voters may not, if
aware of disqualification have voted for the disqualified candidate."
125. The same view has been reiterated in Prakash Khandre v. Dr.Vijaykumar Khandre and
Others22 at para-14, which is extracted hereinbelow:-
AIR 1969 SC 604 (2002) 5 SCC 568 "14. However, in an election where the elected
candidate is declared to be disqualified to contest election and there are more than
two candidates contesting election, there is no specific provision under the Act under
which the person who has secured the next highest number of votes could be declared
as elected. The Act is silent on this point. Further, it cannot be presumed that the
votes secured by the disqualified elected candidates would have been wasted or
would have been secured by the next candidate who has secured more votes. If
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 39
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
disqualified candidate was not permitted to contest the election then how the voters
would have voted in favour of the candidate who has secured more votes than the
other remaining candidates would be a question in the realm of speculation and
unpredictability. In such a situation, declaring the election of the returned candidate
on the ground of his initial disqualification to contest the election by itself would not
entitle the election petitioner or any other candidate to be declared elected."
126. It is clear that it cannot be demonstrated that voters have voted for disqualified candidate
knowing he was disqualified, in which event, the votes of the returned candidate whose election is
set aside would be treated to be thrown away votes. Further, in the event there were candidates
other than the returned candidate in the fray, it cannot be second guessed that votes of returned
candidate would have gone only to the candidate having obtained the second highest votes.
Accordingly, in light of the law laid down by the Apex Court, the question of declaring the petitioner
as returned candidate when there were multiple contestants does not arise.
127. Accordingly, the Issue No.(vii) is answered in the negative.
PART - F
128. Issue No.(i) is taken up for consideration. Issue No.(i) which is framed is as follows:-
(i) WHETHER THE PETITIONER HAS COMPLIED WITH ALL THE

furnish material facts and particulars as required under Section 83 of the R.P. Act. and the
assertions being vague, he is not in a position to take an appropriate defence. Further, it is
contended that the allegations regarding corrupt practices stated to have been resorted to in terms
of Sections 123(1) and 123(2) of the R.P. Act do not have any factual basis and is bereft of necessary
particulars and supporting materials, that the documents produced as Annexures cannot be looked
into due to non-compliance with Section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, that the acts
complained of are attributable to third persons who are not authorized agents of the respondent,
many of the allegations regarding corrupt practices, including issue of Medi Assist cards relate to a
period prior to the election notification issued by the Election Commission of India.
It is also contended at the time of arguments on the applications that the affidavit that has been filed
is not in conformity with Form No.25 of Conduct of Election Rules, 1961 and that the Annexures are
not attested in the requisite manner.
4. Petitioner's objections to I.A.No.1/2018:-
The petitioner has filed objections to the said application.
The petitioner contends that the application does not specifically plead as to which
part of Order VII Rule 11 of C.P.C. is sought to be invoked. All material facts and
particulars required under Sections 83(1)(a) and (b) of the Act which disclose cause
of action have been enumerated and allegations of corruption are substantiated with
necessary supporting documents. Once cause of action has been made out, the
strength and weakness of the case is a matter to be proved during trial, and it is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 42
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
contended that the application has been filed only to protract the proceedings.
5. In re. I.A.No.2/2018.-
The respondent No.1 has contended that the averments made in various paragraphs of the petition
as detailed in the application are liable to be struck off, as such of the allegations are vague,
irrelevant, are unrelated and do not give rise to any cause of action for filing of the present petition.
It is further contended that the pleadings sought to be struck off are scandalous, vexatious,
frivolous, unnecessary and not supported by documents nor substantiated by evidence. It is further
contended that the allegations made relating to corrupt practices cannot be treated as material facts
in the eye of law and that the imputations made against Sri Anantha and Smt.Gowramma and other
third parties, are not the respondent No.1's authorized agents and hence such of the pleadings are
liable to be struck off, as it is abuse of process of court and also prejudices fair trial.
It is further contended that some of the assertions contained in the petition, including para-30
relate to incidents prior to the election notification issued by the Election Commission of India and
hence being irrelevant are liable to be struck off.
Accordingly, the paragraphs referred to in the application are liable to be struck off as lacking in
material facts and particulars as required under Section 83 of the R.P. Act.
6. Petitioner's objections to I.A.No.2/2018 The petitioner has filed objections to the said application.
It is contended that the application is bald and does not identify the paragraphs in the petition
which are frivolous or vexatious, that the petition does contain statement of material facts as
required under Section 83 of the R.P. Act and the documents and grounds relating to Section 123 of
the R.P. Act has been enumerated in detail. That the respondent No.1 by seeking for striking out 35
paragraphs out of 45 paragraphs contained in the election petition is seriously prejudicing right of
the petitioner to conduct proceedings in a fair manner. That prayer (ii) is maintainable under
Section 101 of the R.P. Act, where the court after declaring the election of returned candidate as void
can further declare that the petitioner is duly elected after looking into the number of votes received
by the petitioner. The requirement of pleadings as per Section 83 of the R.P. Act is complied with
and necessary details and particulars regarding each of the allegations are specified.
7. In re. I.A.No.1/2019.-
The petitioner seeks permission to furnish fresh affidavit in Form No.25 in compliance with Section
83(1) of R.P. Act and Rule 94-A of The Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961 and an affidavit as
contemplated under the Code of Civil Procedure.
It is contended by the petitioner that an affidavit has been filed verifying the election petition and
that the said affidavit is in order. However, in light of respondent filing I.A.No.1/2018 seeking
dismissal of the election petition on various grounds, including defective verification and in specific,
asserting verification is not in consonance with Form-25 as a matter of abundant caution, present
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 43
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
application has been filed.
It is submitted that if there is a defect in the affidavit, the same is curable and cannot be construed
to be fatal. Hence, it is submitted that the petitioner may be permitted to submit fresh affidavit
verifying the election petition as well as fresh Form No.25 affidavit, if the Court were to hold that the
verification and affidavits filed are not in order.
8. First Respondent's objections to I.A.No.1/2019:-
The respondent No.1 has filed objections to the said application.
It is contended that I.A.No.1/2019 has been filed belatedly after I.A.Nos.1/2018 and
2/2018 were deliberated upon and after arguments were concluded. Even otherwise,
the affidavits have been filed after the period of limitation prescribed under Section
81 of the R.P. Act and the same is impermissible. It is contended that there are
substantial defects in the affidavits already filed and it is impermissible to file
additional affidavit. It is also contended that there has been no compliance with the
requirement of Order VI Rule 15 of Code of Civil Procedure or with the requirement
with Form-25 affidavit, and that the defects noticed are not merely formal, but
substantial. Hence, it is contended that fresh affidavits cannot be filed without
withdrawing earlier affidavit.
9. (A) IN RE. AFFIDAVIT FILED IN FORM NO.25 AS PER RULES AND VERIFICATION BY
AFFIDAVIT AS REQUIRED UNDER THE CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE
(a) Source of information:-
The respondents have raised contentions in the written statement relating to faulty
affidavits filed in Form No.25 as well as affidavit filed as required by the Code of Civil
Procedure (i.e., both affidavits as contemplated under Section 83 of the Act).
It is the contention of learned counsel for the respondents that the affidavit is bad in
law as the source of information is not provided.
It must be noted that the Form No.25 affidavit is required to be filed only where the
petitioner alleges corrupt practice. The affidavit in Form No.25 that is filed in the
present case stipulates that -
(a) Statements in paragraphs 7, 12, 20 & 42 relate to commission of corrupt practice
and are true to his knowledge;
(b) Particulars of corrupt practice in paragraphs 15, 16, 18, 19, 21 to 24, 26 to 33, 35,
36, 38 to 41 are true to his information.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 44
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
The assertion at paras-7 and 12 of the petition are general in nature. The specific allegation at
para-20 relates to donations and statements made by respondent No.1 and his father and constitute
part of the allegations made in the other paragraphs relating to donations and statements made to
entice the voters. The source of such information is also revealed in the other paragraphs where it is
stipulated regarding posts in the facebook account of the respondent No.1:
https://www.facebook.com/dc.gowrishankar.exmla/ and
https://www.facebook.com/dc.gowrishankar.exmla/ videos/1594041073978583.
The assertion at para-42 relates to taking of insurance policy by Sri Maruthi Seva
Samithi, a Trust stated to be managed by the father of respondent No.1, as regards
students. While, the other allegation relates to poll related expenditure. All the above
assertions are said to be as per knowledge and have been verified to be so. The
affidavit containing affirmation is in accordance with the affidavit in Form No.25.
As regards the affirmation in Form No.25 with respect to particulars of corrupt
practice made in the paragraphs referred to in the affidavit, are stated to be on the
basis of information. Perusal of the assertions in the said paragraphs also reveal the
source of information as noticed hereinbelow:-

7. 41 Allegation of previous Earlier proceedings
misconduct. before the criminal
courts.
Accordingly, it is evident that the allegations made on information with sources are
specified in the petition.
It must be noted that on a plain reading of the affidavit in Form No.25, there is no
requirement to mention the source of information. The requirement of affidavit to be
filed in Form No.25 is only where there is an allegation regarding corrupt practice
and no other requirement needs to be read into the affidavit. The Apex Court in the
case of F.A.Sapa and others v. Singora and others reported in (1991) 3 SCC 375 has
gone a step further while considering the validity of the verifying affidavit as follows:
"28. From the text of the relevant provisions of the R.P. Act, Rule 94-A and Form 25
as well as Order 6 Rule 15 and Order 19 Rule 3 of the Code and the resume of the case
law discussed above it clearly emerges - (i) a defect in the verification, if any, can be
cured (ii) it is not essential that the verification clause at the foot of the petition or the
affidavit accompanying the same should disclose the grounds or sources of
information in regard to the averments or allegations which are based on information
believed to be true (iii) if the respondent desires better particulars in regard to such
averments or allegations, he may call for the same in which case the petitioner may
be required to supply the same.......".
It is no doubt clear as per the discussion made above with particular reference to the observations
made by the Apex Court in the case of F.A. Sapa (supra) that non- mentioning of the source of
information would not be fatal to the election petition, while construing the requirement of an
affidavit in Form No.25.
The respondent while contending that the source of information ought to have been mentioned in
the affidavit and has relied on various judgments, which are considered as below:-
(a) V.Narayanaswamy v. C.P.Thirunavukkarasu reported in (2000) 2 SCC 294 -
While referring to the requirement of mentioning the source of information the Court
at para-23 has observed as follows:-
"23. ...He must state which of the allegations are true to his knowledge and which to
his belief on information received and believed by him to be true...."
Hence, the requirement is only to mention which of the allegations are based 'on knowledge' and
which 'on information' and nothing more.
(b) R.P.Moidutty v. P.T.Kunju Mohammed and Another reported in AIR 2000 SC 388.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 46
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
The affidavit that was filed was verified as being true to the best of "my knowledge and information".
It is in that context, the Apex Court while upholding the dismissal of the election petition at para-33
has observed that the verification was -
"33. .....without specifying which of the allegations were true to the personal
knowledge of the petitioner and which of the allegations were based on the
information of the petitioner believed by him to be true. Neither the verification in
the petition nor the affidavit gives any indication of the source of information of the
petitioner as to such facts as were not in his own knowledge."
Once again source is referred to only as regards mentioning as to whether the averments are true to
knowledge or information. Further, the court notices that even the petition did not give any
indication as to source of information as referred to above.
(c) L.R.Shivaramegowda v. T.M. Chandrashekar reported in (1999) 1 SCC 666.
The Apex Court has held as under:-
"....that the statement made in paras 1 to 42 of the said petition are true to the best of
my knowledge and belief and information and Annexures A to B are true copy of the
original".
The Apex Court while upholding the contention of defective verification has held at para 16A that
the affidavit
-
"....does not disclose the source of information nor does it set out which part of the
election petition was personally known to the petitioner and which part came to be
known by him on information".
Accordingly, the emphasis in all the judgments is on the requirement that the verification ought to
mention which of the paragraphs of the petition are based 'on knowledge and which 'on
information.' The reference hence to non- mentioning of source of information is only in this context
and nothing more.
It is also to be noted that the affidavit filed on 26.06.2018 titled as "affidavit verifying the election
petition" at paragraph 4 states -
"Annexures A, H, J, K, R, S, T, V, W, X, Z and AA are electronic documents printed
from various websites and e- mail communications for which a certificate under
Section 65B of the Evidence Act is separately filed".
Such, an averment could also be construed to be a declaration of source of information.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 47
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
However, in the present case, it is clear that the verification filed in Form 25 does mention as to
which of the paragraphs are based 'on knowledge' and which of the other paragraphs are based 'on
information.' On a closer examination of the averments of the petition as regards to averments made
on the basis of information, it is clear that source of information is enumerated as demonstrated by
Table referred to above.
This Court in E.P.No.1/2016 (Sri Doddabasavaraju v. Sri M. Narayanaswamy and others, dated
24.04.2018) while considering I.A.Nos.3/2016 and 4/2016 relating to a similar contention as
regards source of information not being mentioned in the verifying affidavit after a detailed analysis
of the relevant case law has observed at para- 33 as follows:-
"33.........The source of information is also discernable upon a reading of the election
petition, which is from different sources as narrated in the pleadings in various
paragraphs of the election petition."
By concluding so, the Co-ordinate Bench has refused to accept the contention that the affidavit filed
was bad for not having mentioned the source of information. It is to be noted that the said order of
the Co-ordinate Bench was challenged by the way of Special Leave to Appeal (C)
Nos.11343-11344/2018, which has however been dismissed by order dated 04.07.2018, thereby
confirming the order of the learned Single Judge.
Accordingly, the contention of the respondents as regards the affidavit being defective for
non-mentioning of source of information is rejected.
(b) Verification of documents:-
Insofar as the assertion of the petitioner regarding verification of the documents are concerned, it is
asserted by the learned counsel for the respondents that the documents have not been verified in
terms of Section 83(2) of the R.P. Act. It must be noted that the Apex Court in the case of F.A. Sapa
(supra) has observed in para-28 as follows:-
"28. ..... similarly the court would have to decide each individual case whether the
schedule or annexure referred to in Section 83(2) constitutes an integral part of the
election petition or not; different considerations will follow in the case of the former
as compared to those in the case of the latter".
In this regard, an important distinction is to be borne in mind while construing whether a given
annexure or schedule is an integral part of the election petition or not. There is a difference between
documents that substantiate a material fact and documents that serve as evidentiary value to
support the material particulars furnished in the petition, and it is in the case of the former that
documents constitute an integral part of the election petition.
The Table referred supra reveals that the documents that have been marked as Annexures are only
material in the form of evidence to substantiate the pleading. In fact, every assertion of an allegation
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 48
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
as found in the second column of the Table by itself forms ground of corrupt practice and the proof
of the said assertion is by reliance on documents marked as annexure. If that were to be so, it cannot
be stated that the documents marked as Annexures are an integral part of the petition and
accordingly, the requirement of verification as regards the petition is not applicable as regards such
of the documents and hence, verification that is found would be in compliance with the legal
requirement.
(B) REJECTION OF PETITION:-
It is to be noticed that while considering the application under Order 7 Rule 11, CPC
in the specific context of the assertion that affidavits are faulty, the Apex Court in the
case of G.M. Siddeshwar v. Prasanna Kumar reported in (2013) 4 SCC 776 while
referring to F.A. Sapa's case (supra) has held that a defective affidavit may not be
fatal to the maintainability of an election petition. It is also to be noted that Section
86 of the R.P. Act provides that an election petition will be dismissed if it does not
comply with Sections 81, 82 and 117 of the R.P. Act whereas, the requirement relating
to verification as provided under Section 83 of the R.P.Act does not come under the
purview of Section 86 of the R.P.Act and hence, the petition cannot be said to be hit
by the mandatory requirement of Section 86 of R.P. Act.
Further, it has been held that the High Court should ensure compliance before parties go to the trial
so that the returned candidate can meet the allegations and is not taken by surprise during trial. In
light of the same, even if it were to be held that affidavits are defective, that by itself would be no
ground for rejection of plaint.
It is also to be noted that while construing as to whether the defect in affidavit would be fatal to the
election petition, the Court needs to strike a fine balance between the statutory requirements to be
complied with vis-à-vis petitions filed to maintain purity of election process. Too hyper-technical an
approach should not result in defeating a genuine attempt made by a litigant to maintain purity of
election process.
The dismissal of an application under Order 7 Rule 11 of C.P.C. would have the effect of merely
holding that there is a triable issue and that the case is fit for trial. The Court while deciding an
application under Order 7 Rule 11 of C.P.C. needs to look at the application by accepting what the
petitioner states to be true and then embark upon finding out if the case for rejection of the plaint
has been made out. The endeavour of the court is not to find out whether the petition will eventually
succeed on its merits, for that is a matter for trial. At the stage of considering the application, the
court needs to see if the bare minimum requirements which could be stated to be pre-conditions for
invoking the jurisdiction are present.
(i) Re.: Faulty Affidavit:
In so far as the contention that in light of affidavit being faulty, the petititon is liable
to be rejected is to answered in the negative in light of the finding that the verifying
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 49
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
affidavit in Form No.25 as regards the averments and documents are in compliance
with the legal requirements of verification.
In the present case, having dealt with the contention regarding the faulty affidavit, it
is to be seen as to whether the petition is liable to be rejected under Order 7 Rule 11 of
C.P.C. as being in violation of Sections 83 and 86 of R.P. Act.
In so far as the contention regarding petition being bad for faulty affidavit, even if it
were to be accepted that the affidavit was faulty which is not the case herein, it is
definitely not in violation of Section 86 of R.P. Act in light of the discussion supra.
Further, the observation of the Apex Court in the case of Ponnala Lakshmaiah v.
Kommuri Pratap Reddy and Others reported in (2012) 7 SCC 788 provides an answer
as follows:
"9. We may also gainfully refer to the decision of this Court in H.D. Revanna v. G.
Puttaswamy Gowda [(1999) 2 SCC 217] where this Court held that an election
petition can be dismissed for non-compliance with Sections 81, 82 and 117 of the
Representation of the People Act, 1951 but it may also be dismissed if the matter falls
within the scope of Order 6 Rule 16 or Order 7 Rule 11 CPC. A defect in the
verification of the election petition or the affidavit accompanying the election petition
was held to be curable, hence, not sufficient to justify dismissal of the election
petition under Order 7 Rule 11 or Order 6 Rule 16 CPC. The following passage in this
regard is instructive: (SCCp.233, para 14) "14. ... the relevant provisions in the Act are
very specific. Section 86 provides for dismissal of an election petition in limine for
non-compliance with Sections 81, 82 and 117. Section 81 relates to the presentation of
an election petition. It is not the case of the appellant before us that the requirements
of Section 81 were not complied with.... Sections 82 and 117 are not relevant in this
case. Significantly, Section 86 does not refer to Section 83 and non-compliance with
Section 83 does not lead to dismissal under Section 86. This Court has laid down that
non- compliance with Section 83 may lead to dismissal of the petition if the matter
falls within the scope of Order 6 Rule 16 or Order 7 Rule 11 CPC. Defect in verification
of the election petition or the affidavit accompanying the election petition has been
held to be curable and not fatal."
The Constitution Bench of the Apex Court in the case of Murarka Radhey Sham Ram Kumar v. Roop
Singh Rathore and Others (as per B.P.Singh C.J.I., S.K.Das J., Raghubar Dayal J., N.Rajagopala
Ayyangar J., and J.R.Mudholkar J.) has held that a defect in the verification would not be fatal and
such lapse could be rectified later. Hence, mere fact that the affidavit is faulty would be no ground
for rejection of the petition.
(ii) Re. Material facts and material particulars:
"Whether the election petition is liable to be rejected as pleaded in I.A.No.1/2018,
due to lack of material facts and material particulars of corrupt practice enumerated
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 50
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
in the petition as envisaged under Section 83 of the Act?"
The absence of mentioning of material facts and full particulars of corrupt practice would result in
dismissal of the petition is not in dispute. However, the true meaning and purport of the term
'material facts' and 'material particulars' ought to be looked at keeping in mind the observations of
the Apex Court as made in Harkirat Singh v. Amrinder Singh reported in (2005) 13 SCC 511 at
paras-48, 51 and 52, which are as follows:
"48. The expression "material facts" has neither been defined in the Act nor in the
Code. According to the dictionary meaning, "material" means "fundamental", "vital",
"basic", "cardinal", central', 'crucial', 'decisive', "essential", "pivotal", "indispensable",
"elementary" or "primary". [Burton's Legal Thesaurus, (3rd Edn..) p.349]. The phrase
"material facts", therefore, may be said to be those facts upon which a party relies for
his claim or defence. In other words, "material facts" are facts upon which the
plaintiffs cause of action or the defendant's defence depends. What particulars could
be said to be "material facts" would depend upon the facts of each case and no rule of
universal application can be laid down. It is, however, absolutely essential that all
basic and primary facts which must be proved at the trial by the party to establish the
existence of a cause of action or defence are material facts and must be stated in the
pleading by the party.
51. A distinction between "material facts" and "particular"', however, must not be
overlooked. "Material facts" are primary or basic facts which must be pleaded by the
plaintiff or by the defendant in support of the case set up by him either to prove his
cause of action or defence. "Particulars", on the other hand, are details in support of
material facts pleaded by the party. They amplify, refine and embellish material facts
by giving distinctive touch to the basic contours of a picture already drawn so as to
make it full, more clear and more informative. "Particulars" thus ensure conduct of
fair trial and would not take the opposite party by surprise.
52. All "material facts" must be pleaded by the party in support of the case set up by
him. Since the object and purpose is to enable the opposite party to know the case he
has to meet with, in the absence of pleading, a party cannot be allowed to lead
evidence. Failure to state even a single material fact, hence, will entail dismissal of
the suit or petition. Particulars, on the other hand, are the details of the case which is
in the nature of evidence a party would be leading at the time of trial."
It would be useful to refer to Halsbury's Laws of England, (Fourth Edition); Vol.36; para 38, which
is as follows:
"38. The function of particulars is to carry into operation the overriding principle that
the litigation between the parties, and particularly the trial, should be conducted
fairly, openly and without surprises, and incidentally to reduce costs. This function
has been variously stated, namely either to limit the generality of the allegations in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 51
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
the pleadings, or to define the issues which have to be tried and for which discovery is
required. Each party is entitled to know the case that is intended to be made against
him at the trial, and to have such particulars of his opponent's case as will prevent
him from being taken by surprise. Particulars enable the other party to decide what
evidence he ought to be prepared with and to prepare for the trial. A party is bound
by the facts included in the particulars, and he may not rely on any other facts at the
trial without obtaining the leave of the court...."
In light of the above observations, the contents of the pleadings in the election petition needs to be
subjected to close scrutiny in light of the assertions of non- compliance. On a perusal of the Table
formulated above, what would come out is the mentioning of the allegation of corrupt practice and
also evidence and material referred to, to substantiate the said allegation of corrupt practice.
The specific assertions are enumerated below:-
(a) Insofar as the allegation relating to donations made to entice the ward 'voters', a
perusal of para-18 would indicate the specific allegation is that on 25.03.2018
respondent No.1 notified the public at large that through the Society that a sum of
Rs.5.00 lakhs was paid for renovation of Shanidevaru Temple at Dasarahalli, which is
a material fact. The particulars relate to statements made through the facebook
account and screen shots of the photographs produced on the facebook page.
(b) The next assertion is regarding taking of insurance policy by Maruti Seva Samithi
managed by father of respondent No.1, and the assured being the students studying,
whose wards reside in the said constituency. In substance, the allegation was that the
said Samithi had taken out Medi Assist Policy on the students so as to entice the
guardians of the said students to vote in favour of the candidate. Such of those
assertions are material facts while, the material particulars that are enumerated
relate to the available evidence and the manner of proof which includes recovery of
56 number of Medi Assist identification cards by an official of flying squad of
M/s.New India Assurance Company Limited (para-22 of the petition), recovery of 56
number of pamphlets alleged to be issued by JDS party workers (para-22 of the
petition), reference to mahazar, videography of the operation, FIR in Crime
No.0097/2018 in the Court of 1st Additional Civil Judge (Jr.Dn.) & JMFC, Tumkur,
charge sheet filed in the criminal case, reference to the e-mail communication by the
official of Vigilance of IRDAI (para-27), details in para-33 as regards distribution of
Medi Assist I.D. cards and seizure of insurance policies as referred to in para-39 on
11.05.2018 by the named official of the flying squad. All of which are the material
particulars that have been enumerated.
(c) As regards the allegation of use of money to entice voters, the material facts and
particulars are contained in para-39 while, material fact is enumerated to the effect
that the party workers were distributing money in connection with election, whereas
the material particulars relate to the enumeration of seizure of the said amount by
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 52
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
officials of the squad which is mentioned in para-39.
Thus it becomes clear that material facts as well as particulars regarding the allegation of corrupt
practice has been mentioned.
It is to be noted that while deciding the question as to whether material facts and particulars have
been mentioned so as to fulfill the requirements under Section 83 of R.P. Act, what needs to be seen
is as to whether there has been requisite enumeration of the facts and particulars in the pleading. It
is not the task of the court to complete a full enquiry and arrive at the conclusion at this stage itself
as to whether the allegations made would be proved and were strong enough to allow the petition.
While looking into the contentions advanced to reject the petition, the court would not be required
to dwell into the strength of the allegation and probability of it being proved. In the case of Madiraju
Venkata Ramana Raju v. Peddireddigari Ramachandra Reddy and others reported in AIR 2018 SC
3012, the Apex Court has aptly observed at para-29 as follows:-
"29. Whether the material facts as asserted by the appellant can stand the test of trial
and whether the appellant would be able to bring home the grounds for declaring the
election of respondent No.1 to be void, is not a matter to be debated at this stage.
Suffice it to observe that the averments in the concerned paragraphs of the election
petition, by no standard can be said to be frivolous and vexatious as such. The High
Court committed manifest error in entering into the tenability of the facts and
grounds urged in support thereof by the appellant on merit, as is evident from the
cogitation in paragraphs 16 to 22 of the impugned judgment."
It is also to be noted that if the court were to come to a finding that material facts and particulars of
even one allegation of corrupt practice has been enumerated in the election petition, that would
suffice for the purpose of holding that the petition would be maintainable.
The court also needs to keep in mind the observation at para-17 of Ponnala Lakshmaiah (supra),
which runs as follows:
"17. While a successful candidate is entitled to defend his election and seek dismissal
of the petition on ground legally available to him, the prolongation of proceedings by
prevarication is not conducive to the ends of justice that can be served only by an
early and speedy disposal of the proceedings. The courts have, therefore, to guard
against such attempts made by parties who often succeed in dragging the proceedings
beyond the term for which they have been elected. The courts need to be cautious in
dealing with requests for dismissal of petitions at the threshold and exercise their
powers of dismissal only in cases where even on a plain reading of the petition no
cause of action is disclosed."
It is also to be noted that the statements made in the election petition must be read in totality and
cannot be taken out and read in isolation. The observations in Ponnala Lakshmaiah's case (supra) at
para-5 requires to be noticed:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 53
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
"5. It is equally well settled that while examining whether a plaint or an election
petition discloses a cause of action, the court has a full and comprehensive view of the
pleading. The averments made in the plaint or petition cannot be read out of context
or in isolation. They must be taken in totality for a true and proper understanding of
the case set up by the plaintiff."
(C) RE. STRIKING OFF THE PLEADINGS:-
(i) Pleadings related to 'corrupt practices' prior to the date of nomination It is the
contention of the respondents that the allegations relating to 'corrupt practices' found
at para-
18 (donation for renovating Shanidevaru Temple), para-19 (promise to give 1000 free seats in the
Engineering College run by Society) and para-21 (issuance of Medi Assist identity cards), relate to a
period prior to filing of the nomination and hence, are liable to be struck off.
Learned counsel for the petitioner relies on the judgment of the Apex Court in Subhash Desai v.
Sharad J. Rao and Others reported in AIR 1994 SC 2277 (specifically, para-8) and Chandrakanta
Goyal v. Sohan Singh Jodh Singh Kohli reported in (1996) 1 SCC 378 (specifically, para-3) which
would indicate that matters prior to filing of nomination papers cannot be looked into while passing
of a judgment.
It is however to be noted that the observations of the Apex Court was made in the context of disposal
of the Election Petition after trial. No doubt 'corrupt practice' anterior to a person being 'duly
nominated as a candidate' cannot be taken note of, however, as the question of striking of pleadings
is being considered at the initial stage, before trial, such request could be allowed only if such a
conclusion can be arrived at without any admission of doubt.
The Supreme Court in Raj Narain v. Smt. Indira Nehru Gandhi and another reported in [(1972) 3
SCC 850] has held that just because a corrupt practice has to be strictly proved would not mean that
a pleading in an election petition must be strictly construed. The Court held that it cannot refuse to
enquire into allegations made by the election petitioner merely because the election petitioner or
someone who prepared his brief did not know the language of law.
Noting that the striking of pleadings before trial has commenced, such plea ought to be cautiously
considered. Further it is to be noted that the allegations made in the present case are not standalone
allegations, but are also continuing in nature.
As regards the allegations relating to issuance of Medi Assist cards, there are specific assertions at
paragraph 33 of the petition that the cards were distributed after 25.4.2018 and between 25.4.2018
and 11.5.2018. It comes out from Annexure-AA that the policies were cancelled only on 8.5.2018 (i.e.
after the date for filing nomination was fixed on 25.4.2018). In view of the above, the question of
striking off the pleadings relating to issuance of Medi Assist cards, accepting the contention of the
respondent at this stage would not arise.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 54
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
In so far as the contention regarding the promise to distribute free seats in the Engineering College,
though there is a reference to the television interview on 30.03.2018, the facebook post containing
the said interview has been uploaded on 30.03.2018. The facebook post continuing to be on the
online platform, with it being accessible to viewers in the election period would prima facie indicate
that the possibility of facebook post serving as an enticement cannot be summarily ruled out at this
pre-trial stage. Accordingly, the contention of the respondent is liable to be rejected.
Similarly, the contention of the respondent regarding the announcement of a donation made for the
temple through a facebook post dated 25.03.2018 cannot be construed to be an allegation made in
isolation, in light of the assertions made in paras-12 and 39 of the petition.
As regards the relief sought to strike off the pleadings relating to other paragraphs mentioned in the
application, the same is dealt hereinafter.
The averments in paragraph Nos.3 to 6 of the petition relate to the background of the petitioner
while, the averments in paragraph Nos.7 and 8 relate to general assertion of facts. The averments at
paragraph No.11 relates to the number of votes polled and issuance of Form- 21C while, the
averments in paragraph Nos.13 to 17 relate to constitution and management of Sri Maruthi Seva
Samithi. No grounds are made out to strike off such pleadings as it cannot be said that the pleadings
are, in terms of Order VI Rule 16 or under the provisions of the Representation of People Act, 1951
demonstrably such as being liable to be struck off.
As regards the pleadings in paragraph Nos.21 to 24 and 26 to 30, the same primarily relate to the
allegations of corrupt practice by issuance of Medi Assist cards and contention to strike off pleadings
relating to such allegation has already been dealt supra. Hence, no ground is made out to allow the
application and the same is liable to be rejected.
10. In light of the above discussion, the applications, viz., I.A. Nos.1/2018 and 2/2018 are dismissed.
11. In view of the above, I.A. No.1/2019 seeking for permission to furnish fresh affidavit does not call
for any orders and the said application is disposed off as not requiring to be adjudicated upon."
134. The requirements under Section 83 of the R.P. Act in the present petition has been considered
while passing orders on the interlocutory applications, viz., I.A.Nos.1/2018 and 2/2018 in detail and
accordingly, Issue No.(i) is answered in the affirmative in terms of the order passed dated
06.12.2019 disposing off the interlocutory applications.
135. Accordingly, to avoid repetition, the order on the above said interlocutory applications in its
entirety is to be read as an answer to the present issue raised. An attempt to summarize the said
order and pass fresh order would be wholly unnecessary. Any attempt to summarize would also be
inadequate insofar as some of the points contained in the order may be left out and accordingly, the
said attempt is not being made.
IV ANALYSIS OF PROCEEDINGS UNDER SECTION 99 OF R.P ACT
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 55
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
136. The relevant extract of Section 99 of the R.P. Act is as follows:-
"99. Other orders to be made by the High Court.-- (1) At the time of making an order
under section 98 the High Court shall also make an order--
(a) where any charge is made in the petition of any corrupt practice having been
committed at the election, recording--
(i) xxx
(ii) the names of all persons, if any, who have been proved at the trial to have been
guilty of any corrupt practice and the nature of that practice; and
(b) xxx Provided that a person who is not a party to the petition shall not be named in
the order under sub-
clause (ii) of clause (a) unless--
(a) he has been given notice to appear before the High Court and to show cause why he should not
be so named; and
(b) if he appears in pursuance of the notice, he has been given an opportunity of cross-examining
any witness who has already been examined by the High Court and has given evidence against him,
of calling evidence in his defence and of being heard.
(2) In this section and in section 100, the expression "agent" has the same meaning as in section
123."
137. Insofar as the mandate of Section 99 of the R.P. Act which prohibits the naming of a person
who has been proved at the trial to have been guilty of corrupt practice, the requirement under law
is that a person who is not a party to the petition shall not be named unless he has been given notice
to appear and show cause why he should be so named.
138. In light of such mandate and noticing the settled position that proceedings under Sections 98
and 99 of R.P. Act have to be considered simultaneously, the notices were issued to the following
persons:- Sri Palanethraiah, Sri Arehalli Manjunath, Smt.Renukamma, Smt.Sunandamma, Sri
Krishnegowda and the President of KMSS.
139. Alongwith the notices, the Noticees were furnished with relevant pleadings and documents so
as to enable them to make out an effective reply. All of the said Noticees have filed their statement of
defence and also led their own evidence and have been granted opportunity to cross-examine
witnesses and also examined the witnesses who have already adduced the evidence.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 56
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
140. In the course of the proceedings under Section 99 of the R.P. Act, a finding is to be recorded as
to whether the Noticees could be named as being guilty of corrupt practice.
141. Before adverting to the particular facts and contentions of each of the Noticees, there are certain
legal and factual aspects which are common as regards all of the Noticees.
142. It must be noted that in the pleadings specifically at para-33 of Election Petition, it is averred
that the respondent No.1 distributing Medi Assist cards was an act to induce the voters to vote in
favour of respondent No.1 and it is asserted that the distribution of Medi Assist cards were effected
between 25.04.2018 to 11.05.2018 at different times by the JD(S) Party workers who are mentioned
in the table extracted at para-33 of the Election Petition. The names of the Noticees are found in the
table at Sl.No.20 (Smt.Renukamma and Sri Krishnegowda) and Sl.No.24 (Sri Arehalli Manjunath).
143. Insofar as the incident of seizure of insurance policies subsequent to interception of the Scorpio
vehicle belonging to Sri Palanethraiah by the FST-II Squad on 11.05.2018, the relevant pleadings are
found in para-39, though name of Sri Palanethraiah is not forthcoming. After Crime No.0073/2018
was registered regarding the incident of 11.05.2018, investigation was conducted and in the report
subsequently filed during the pendency of the proceedings, name of Sri Palanethraiah being
mentioned, the same is brought to the notice of the Court at the stage of evidence.
144. Insofar as the common contention relating to handing over of Medi Assist cards by the Noticees
as is alleged by the witnesses, it is specifically asserted that while handing over Medi Assist cards,
there was request to the recipients of the bonds to vote for respondent No.1. The very act of handing
over the Medi Assist cards which could be invoked to claim reimbursement of medical expenses and
could be construed to be a gift/offer with the object of directly or indirectly inducing the elector to
vote; or could be construed to be a gratification to induce the elector to vote. Accordingly, the same
would constitute 'bribery' in terms of Section 123 of the R.P. Act.
145. Though it is contended that PW.3, PW.5, PW.6 and PW.8 are interested witnesses and are
brought at the instance of the petitioner, however, the evidence of such of the witnesses deserve
acceptance when looked into in conjunction with the circumstances relating to the distribution of
policies, which include averment of respondent No.1 in para-24 of the written statement and the
documents marked by PW.3, PW.5, PW.6 and PW.8 extracted at the table at para-97. The said
documents corroborate the Medi Assist cards produced by the recipients as regards Schools in
which the children are studying, which details are found in the Medi Assist cards. It is also to be
noted that all the Noticees have adopted the cross- examination of the witnesses of the respondent
No.1, indicating that both the respondent No.1 and the Noticees were sharing a similar stand.
146. It is in this background that the allegations made out against the Noticees is to be looked into.
147. Noticee - Sri Palanethraiah
(i) The allegations made out in the notice as regards Sri Palanethraiah are as follows:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 57
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
"Allegations made against Palanethraiah:
It is alleged that on 11.05.2018, a day prior to election, the officer-in-charge of the
FST-11 squad while proceeding in K.Palasandra village noticed a Scorpio vehicle
bearing registration No. KA 06 N 2725 and tried to stop the vehicle but the vehicle
sped away. The vehicle was chased down and pulled over and four persons ran away
from the vehicle out of which one person took a bag along with him. After inspection
the officer in-charge seized one note-book in which JDS was written, JDS student
insurance policy, 5 pages containing names of booth level workers and their
telephone numbers, a bundle of Rs.500 notes amounting to Rs. 50,000/-, one cheque
book, one Canara Bank pass book, pair of chappals and wedding invetition card. After
seizure mahazar was drawn and FIR was registered and Crime No.0073/2018 dated
11.05.2018 was registered against four unknown persons. In the case, Palanethraiah
appeared before the trial court and pleaded guilty under section 171(E) of IPC.
It is further alleged that the said Palanethraiah is the counting agent of Respondent
No.1. Therefore, it is stated that the corrupt practice carried out by Palanethraiah is
stated to have been proved by the fact that he pleaded guilty in Crime
No.0073/2018,making RespondentNo.1 liable for corrupt practices under section 123
of RP Act."
(ii) Responding to the show cause as to why he should not be named, the defence statement came to
be filed asserting as follows:-
(a) That there is no pleading in the Election Petition that the Noticee is an agent or
person with the consent of the candidate.
(b) The pleadings do not indicate that the Noticee is an occupant or agent who has
indulged in bribery.
(c) That insofar as the proceedings initiated pursuant to Crime No.0073/2018 as per
the Police Report filed after investigation, there is no identification of persons who
were occupants of the vehicle. The Police Report further includes the name of the
Noticee only, as he is the registered owner of the vehicle.
(d) Pleading guilty by the Noticee for the offence under Section 171E of IPC was only
in order to get over the "false petty offence to avoid the long drawn legal battle does
not enure to the benefit of any person to draw the presumption."
(e) The Noticee is not the Counting Agent of respondent No.1 and Ex.P32 produced
by the petitioner cannot be relied upon.
(iii) The evidence by way of affidavit has been filed by Sri Palanethraiah. Insofar as
his request to lead evidence touching the aspect of his pleading guilty in the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 58
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
proceedings in Crime No.0073/2018, this Court has observed at paras-22 and 23 of
the order dated 22.11.2022 that the question of leading evidence contrary to the
judgment passed in criminal proceedings does not arise. Further, the legal
consequence of conviction under Section 171E of IPC is as envisaged under Section
11A of the R.P. Act and that cannot be lost sight of. Relevant observations made at
para-23 of the order referred to above is as follows:-
"23. ... The question of leading evidence insofar as judgment of conviction is
concerned, would not arise in light of the legal consequence flowing from the
judgment of conviction which remains unchallenged. Accordingly, the Noticee is
entitled to lead evidence only insofar as the aspect of him allegedly being a counting
agent of the respondent."
The said order came to be challenged before the Apex Court in SLP Diary No.40495/2022 filed by
Sri Palanethraiah and though leave was granted and matter was heard, the appeal came to be
dismissed holding that the order impugned did not call for interference as per the order dated
16.12.2022, which reads as hereunder: -
"1. The application for permission to file the Special Leave Petition is allowed.
2. We have heard learned counsel for the petitioner at a considerable length and also
perused the statutory provisions as well as the deposition of P.W.12.
3. In our considered view, the impugned interim order dated 02.12.2022, passed by
the High Court of Karnataka at Bengaluru, does not call for any interference by this
Court.
4. The Special Leave Petition is, accordingly, dismissed.
5. As a result, pending interlocutory application also stands disposed of."
(iv) Accordingly, the evidence led in was limited only insofar as the assertion that the Noticee was
the Counting Agent of respondent No.1.
(v) It must be noted that on 11.05.2018, a day prior to the polling day, the FST-II Squad visited
Gulur, Hebbur Hobli and when it was approaching K.Phalasandra Village, a Scorpio Vehicle bearing
registration No.KA-06-N-2725 was intercepted. The said vehicle was abandoned immediately and
the Squad has seized the following:-
a) Scorpio vehicle bearing registration No.KA-06-N-2725;
b) xxxx
c) JD(S) student Indemnity Letter;
d) xxxx
e) Eight pages containing details of Booth
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 59
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
Level workers with telephone numbers;
f) Currency Notes of Rs.500/- denomination of 100 notes totaling to an amount of
Rs.50,000/-;
g) Cheque Book consisting of 12 empty cheque leaves of Canara Bank belonging to
Palanethraiah.G S/o Gangappa;
h) Pass Book relating to A/c
No.0474101036881 belonging to
Palanethraiah.G S/o Gangappa;
(vi) The FIR was registered as per Crime
No.0073/2018 initially against the unknown persons and after investigation, the
charge sheet came to be filed in Crime No.0073/2018 for the offence under Section
171E of IPC and charges were framed and the Noticee Sri Palanethraiah has pleaded
guilty. An extract of the proceedings is as follows:-

(vii) It is clear from the charges framed that the charge made out a case that money was being
ferried in the vehicle in order to distribute the same to the voters on behalf of JD(S) Party during the
time the Code of Conduct was notified and was in force and that the accused had abandoned the
vehicle and upon inspection, the material referred to above was seized and accused had committed
an offence under Section 171E of IPC. By virtue of pleading guilty, it could be stated that the charges
have been held to be proved and the legal consequence would be that the said Noticee Sri
Palanethraiah can be stated to have been guilty of the corrupt practice. In terms of Section 123 of the
R.P. Act, 'corrupt practice' includes 'bribery' and Section 171E provides punishment for 'bribery'.
Section 171B defines 'bribery' and Section 171B(2) provides that a person who offers or agrees to give
a gratification shall be deemed to give a gratification.
(viii) By virtue of pleading guilty, the offence under Section 171E is established and would constitute
'bribery' in terms of Section 123.
(ix) Though it is submitted that the judgment in C.C.No.3079/2018 has been challenged by filing
Criminal Appeal No.15/2023 after a delay of about five years and during the pendency of the present
proceedings, it would not have the effect of taking away the conviction and sentence in the absence
of stay of the judgment and order of sentence passed in C.C.No.3079/2018.
(x) Accordingly, it can be stated that the Noticee Sri Palanethraiah is guilty of corrupt practice in
terms of the offence for which punishment is imposed under Section 171E of IPC.
(xi) Insofar as the defence relating to the allegation made against Sri Palanethraiah as being a
Counting Agent of the respondent No.1, it is asserted that the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961
prescribes a procedure of appointment of Counting Agent and Form-18 is the prescribed format,
which has not been produced by the petitioner.
(xii) The endorsement dated 27.11.2019 is enclosed alongwith the list of Counting Agents and
contains the name of Sri Palanethraiah. G. The said document is signed on behalf of Tahsildar and
the covering sheet to the list is the endorsement furnishing the information of Counting Agents as
has been sought for. Therefore, in light of the discussion made supra at para-87, there is a
presumption under Section 114 of the Indian Evidence Act as regards the documents issued by the
public authority.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 61
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
(xiii) The Noticee Sri Palanethraiah had asserted that the said document is a fabricated document
and submits that the said document does not have his signature.
(xiv) Once the Noticee, Sri Palanethraiah seeks to assert that he is not the person referred to as
Palanethraiah.G in Ex.P32 and that Ex.P32 is a fabricated document, the burden is cast on Sri
Palanethraiah himself to prove the same. The same has not been discharged by Sri Palanethraiah
who was afforded an opportunity to lead evidence through Section 99 proceedings wherein such
stand as noticed above was taken. It was upto Sri Palanethraiah, the Noticee to disprove Ex.P32 or
to have taken such other steps to discharge the burden of proving the assertion that he was not a
Counting Agent of respondent No.1 and that Ex.P32 does not relate to him.
(xv) Accordingly, it can be held that the Noticee Sri Palanethraiah has committed the corrupt
practice of bribery in terms of 'bribery'.
148. Noticee - Sri Arehalli Manjunath:-
(i) Insofar as the Noticee Sri Arehalli Manjunath, the allegations made out under
Section 99 of R.P. Act are as detailed in the notice and extracted hereinbelow:-
"The nature of allegations made against you and the evidence in that regard are
briefly mentioned as herein below:
It is the case of the petitioner that you have colluded with Respondent no.1 and have
committed corrupt practice of distributing Medi Assist Insurance Policies by carrying
out door to door campaign during the election for the period between 25.04.2018 to
11.05.2018. It is the allegation made that though the policy was taken prior to the
nomination of the candidate, the distribution was carried out in favour of
Respondent No.1 after the nomination of the candidate was filed.
The Petitioner has led evidence by examining Laksminarayan V.N. [PW-3] and
Ramamani [PW-8] - It is stated in the evidence affidavit of PW-3 that PW-3 is the

JDS Party along with manifesto of JDS Party.
PW-8 through her evidence affidavit has made out similar allegations.
(ii) In response to the said notice, the defence statement has been filed to the show
cause notice. The primary stand taken by the Noticee is that the petitioner has relied
upon PW.3 and PW.8, who were parents of the wards, who are the beneficiaries of
the Medi Assist Policy distributed to them and evidence of such of the witnesses were
not reliable as they were deposing at the instance of the petitioners.
(iii) PW.3 Sri Lakshminarayana has stated in his evidence affidavit that in the 2018
Assembly Elections, few days before the polling date, the noticee Sri Arehalli
Manjunath and his supporters had come to his house and handed over a bond of the
M/s.New India Assurance Co.

he was told while handing over of the bond that the insurance premia was paid by Sri

regards expenses upto Rs.10,000/-. It is further asserted that the elections were to be held for
Tumkur Rural Constituency within a few days and he and his family members were to vote in favour
of Sri D.C.Gowrishankar.
(iv) The witness PW.3 was cross-examined and has withstood the cross-examination. It is also
relevant to notice that during cross-examination PW.3 has specifically stated that the noticee has
come to his house on two occasions and the bond was given on one such occasion.
(v) It is relevant to note that the learned counsel for the noticee has sought for adoption of cross-
examination of the said witness on an earlier occasion by learned counsel for respondent No.1.
(vi) PW.8 Smt.Ramamani has filed affidavit by way of evidence asserting that Sri Arehalli
Manjunath and Smt.Sunandamma are from her village and had come to her house in April 2018. It
is submitted that the details of her daughter studying in 5th standard was collected by

daughter meets with an accident or suffers any health issue, there would be an insurance coverage
upto Rs.10,000/- and treatment could be obtained from any hospital. She has further stated at
para-5 of the affidavit that she was lured to cast her vote to Sri D.C.Gowrishankar in the elections to
be held.

to how did she know that Sri Arehalli Manjunath and Smt.Sunandamma were JD(S) Party workers,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 63
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
she has stated that she had seen them moving around with Sri D.C.Gowrishankar in all the
functions.
(viii) Though an effort was made to raise a doubt regarding the notarization of the affidavit, the said
aspect does not have the effect of discarding the affidavit.
(ix) It must be noted that PW.3 Sri Lakshminarayana has got marked the following documents in
support of his stand and to corroborate his evidence regarding issuance of Medi Assist cards issued
in the name of his child:-
NAME OF WITNESS WITNESS EXHIBITS MARKED EXAMINED AS
Lakshminarayana V.N PW - 3 Ex.P49 and Ex.P50 - Voters List for the year 2018,
2021 Ex.P51 - Son's Study Certificate Ex.P52 - Medi Assist Card Ex.P53 - Aadhar
Card Ex.P54 - Son's Aadhar Card Similarly, PW.8 Smt.Ramamani has produced the
following documents in support of her stand and assertion:-
NAME OF WITNESS WITNESS EXHIBITS MARKED EXAMINED AS Ramamani
PW - 8 Ex.P73 and Ex.P74 - Voters List Ex.P75 - Daughter's Study Certificate Ex.P76
- Medi Assist Card Ex.P77 - Aadhar Card Ex.P78 - Daughter's Aadhar Card
(x) It is clear from the above that the details of the child as regards PW.3 and PW.8
found in the Medi Assist card is supported by the details in the Aadhar Card (Ex.P53
and Ex.P54 produced by PW.3 and Ex.P77 and Ex.P78 produced by PW.8). The Study
Certificate issued by the School also tallies with the description of the School in the
Medi Assist Policy.
(xi) Accordingly, it can be held that the Noticee Sri Arehalli Manjunath has
committed the corrupt practice of bribery in terms of Section 123 of R.P. Act insofar
as after the coming into force of the Code of Conduct, Medi Assist cards were
distributed to the parents of children in Tumkur Rural Constituency (PW.3 and
PW.8) with the quid pro quo of the parents voting for Sri D.C.Gowrishankar
(respondent No.1) during the election. The Medi Assist Policy could be construed to
be either a gift in terms of Section 123(1)(A) with the object of directly or indirectly
inducing the electors to vote for the returned candidate, or could be construed to be a
gratification from the candidate
- respondent No.1. As the Noticee has distributed inducing the elector to vote for the
candidate in terms of Section 123(1)(B). The said distribution of gift/gratification as
per the evidence made out was on behalf of the candidate as is made out from the
oral evidence of PW.3 and PW.8.

"The nature of allegations made against you and the evidence in that regard are

It is the case of the petitioner that you have colluded with Respondent no.1 and have

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 65
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
(iii) It is asserted that except for the oral testimony of PW.5 and PW.6, there is nothing on record to
indicate that the proposed respondent had visited the residence of the said witnesses.
(iv) At the outset, it must be noted that the petitioner has specifically averred at para-33 of the
election petition that Medi Assist cards bearing the name of the students has been distributed
between 25.04.2018 to 11.05.2018 by the JD(S) Party workers detailed in the table and the name of
Smt.Renukamma is found along side that of Sri Krishnegowda and Sri Naveen as regards the village
of Guluru is concerned. The tone and tenor of the pleading at para-33 is to the effect that the
distribution was on behalf of respondent No.1. The averment at para-12 is to the effect that the
corrupt practices have been carried out with the consent and connivance of respondent No.1 by his
agents and his family members and when read in conjunction with the averment in para-33 it
becomes clear that the allegation of distribution of Medi Assist Policies with the consent of
respondent No.1, has been made in the pleadings.
(v) PW.5 Sri Mahadevaiah has specifically asserted in the affidavit filed that his daughter was
studying in 5th Standard in the Government School at Doddasarangipalya and his other child
Vidhyashree was studying in 3rd Standard in the same school. It is asserted that he was acquainted
with Sri Krishnegowda and Smt.Renukamma who are JD(S) Party workers from his village and that
they had come to his house in April 2018 and were told that Sri D.C. Gowrishankar was getting
health insurance policies in the name of the children and that they were required to vote in his
favour. It is submitted that the details of his daughter Sinchana and name of the school in which she
was studying was collected.
(vi) It was submitted that two days prior to the polling day, Sri Krishnegowda and Smt.Renukamma
had come to his house and handed a bond bearing the name of his daughter in the name of M/s New
India Assurance Co. Ltd., whereby, they had informed him that premium was paid by the JD(S)
MLA, whereby there was insurance coverage which would take care of medical expenses. While
handing over the bonds it was specifically averred that they were required to vote for Sri D.C
Gowrishankar.
(vii) PW.5 had produced and got marked Medi Assist Policy at Ex.P63 and had produced other
documents to support the details mentioned in the Medi Assist card which are as follows:-
NAME OF WITNESS WITNESS EXHIBITS MARKED EXAMINED AS Mahadevaiah
PW - 5 Ex.P60 and Ex.P61 - Voters List for the year 2018, 2021 Ex.P62 - Daughter's
Study Certificate Ex.P63 - Medi Assist Card Ex.P64 - Aadhar Card Ex.P65 -
Daughter's Aadhar Card
(viii) Though much is made of the differences in the name of the school as the Study
Certificate at Ex.P62 mentions GLPS (Government Lower Primary School)
Doddasarangipalya, whereas in the Medi Assist cards at Ex.P63, the name of the
school it is mentioned as GHPS (Government Higher Primary School)
Doddasarangipalya.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 66
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
However, the said difference in name of the School is not material enough so as to disbelieve the
Medi Assist card. So also the spelling error in the name in the Medi Assist is also not material and is
clearly a typographical error.
(ix) The possession of the original Medi Assist card which is produced and marked by itself has to be
given due weightage as that pertaining to the daughter of Sri Mahadevaiah.
(x) PW.6 Sri D.R. Ramesh has filed his affidavit on same identical lines as that of Sri Mahadevaiah
and submits that his son Rahul was studying in SLN Vidyamandira in 1st Standard and
Sri.Krishnegowda and Smt.Renukamma had collected the details. The same promise was held out
while handing over the bond as was made out to Sri Mahadevaiah. It was submitted that the bond
was handed over about two days prior to the polling date inside a cover and such cover had the
photograph of Sri D.C. Gowrishankar, his father Sri C. Chennigappa, Sri Kumaraswamy, former
Chief Minister and Sri H.D. Deve Gowda, former Prime Minister. It also contained a copy of election
manifesto.
(xi) In support of his assertion regarding grant of Medi Claim Policy to his son, PW.6 has submitted
the following documents :-
NAME OF WITNESS WITNESS EXHIBITS MARKED EXAMINED AS D.R. Ramesh
PW - 6 Ex.P66 - Voter ID Ex.P67 - Son's Study Certificate Ex.P68 - Medi Assist Card
Ex.P69 - Aadhar Card Ex.P70 - Son's Aadhar Card
(xii) Despite minor contradictions, the witness has withstood the cross-examination.
(xiii) Accordingly, taking note of the evidence of PW5 and PW6 and also noticing the
circumstantial evidence relating to distribution of Medi Assist cards including the
seizure of Medi Assist cards pursuant to investigation, it can be stated that evidence
is made out regarding distribution of Medi Assist cards by Smt. Renukamma. It is
clear that the timing of the distribution of Medi Assist cards few days prior to the
polling date was made with the enticement to vote in favour of respondent No.1. The
said fact of enticement has been stated in the affidavit and is also a matter that could
be inferred from the circumstance of distribution during election as reasoned in the
detailed discussion made supra. It can be stated that corrupt practice in terms of
Section 123 of R.P. Act has been committed.
150. Noticee Smt. Sunanda

about eight days prior to polling day and handed a bond bearing the name of her daughter Poornima

child mentioned in the Medi Assist card to be correct.
(vii) It is specifically asserted during cross- examination that Sri Arehalli Manjunath and Smt.
Sunandamma had distributed the policy. Despite minor contradictions, no case is made out to
discard the evidence of PW8, though witness admits that there is mistake regarding year of study
furnished by the Head Master. However, that by itself would not have the effect of disbelieving the
case put forward by PW8. Though it is stated that witness has come to know that the bond was fake,
such discovery has been made only after the elections.
(viii) The evidence of PW8 when read with the evidence of other witnesses and in light of admissions
made regarding distribution of policy it can be stated that Smt.Sunanda has committed a corrupt
practice under Section 123 of the R.P. Act. The giving of Medi Assist card to the parent of the child
during election time with the express request for voting in favour of respondent No.1 would fall
within the definition of 'bribery' under Section 123 of R.P. Act.
(ix) The contra evidence of the Noticee does not have the effect of displacing the evidence led in by
PW8 and accordingly, the Noticee Smt.Sunanda is also named to have committed the corrupt
practice.

152. Noticee President, KMSS
(i) Insofar as the President, KMSS, the notice under Section 99 of R.P. Act came to be issued calling
upon the Noticee, President of KMSS to reply to the show cause notice as regards such of the
allegations.
The nature of allegations made against you and the evidence in that regard are briefly mentioned as
herein below:
The prime allegations made against a Society by the name 'Kammagondanahalli Sri
Maruthi Seva Samithi' (KMSS) is that the Society formed by the father of Respondent
No.1, Sri. Chennigappa who was also the then President of Tumkur JDS Party and
that the said society is essentially controlled and managed by the family members of
Respondent No.1, has approached an insurance company by the name 'New India
Assurance Company Ltd' for group insurance policies covering health risk of the
students studying in various institutions within the Assembly Constituency from
where Respondent No.1 was nominated and that the Society has paid a sum of
Rs.6,00,000/- towards the premium. It is further alleged in the petition that the said
transaction was serviced by Medi Assist Insurance TPA Pvt. Ltd., and the policy
bearing No.6710034170500000258 having its validity for the period of 26.02.2018 to
25.02.2019 (see para 26 of the petition) It is further alleged that KMSS having its
registered office at Bangalore North Taluk, Bangalore and its administrative office
situated at Nelamangala Taluk, Bengaluru Rural District, the engineering college
which is managed and run by KMSS is situated in Byranayakanahalli,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124095086/ 71
Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
TyamagondluHobli, Nelamangala Taluk, also the school which it is running is at
Yelahanka, hence the area of operation and the activities of KMSS is in Bangalore
Rural District. Whereas KMSS is not running any school in Tumkur Rural Taluk,
KMSS has not taken any such insurance policy to cover the students either of
Nelamangala Taluk or of Yelahanka and the fact that KMSS has chosen to cover
16000 students in 133-Tumkur Rural Constituency is for the only reason to entice the
parents of insured children who are all voters in 133- Tumkur Rural Constituency to
vote for Respondent No.1.
It is because the son of the President of KMSS is contesting the election to the
Karnataka Legislative Assembly as a JDS candidate and that the society is a family
run society (the President's wife, the first respondent's mother is the treasurer, the
President's another son who is the brother of the first respondent is the
Vice-President, the secretary is the son-in-law of the President of KMSS and the
brother-in-law of Respondent No.1) and every one of them were interested in
furthering the cause of the Respondent No.1 (see para 42 of the petition). It is further
asserted that in order to bribe the voters in the said constituency and entice them to
vote in favour of the respondent no.1 they have applied to National Insurance
Company Ltd., for a Group Insurance (see para 43 of the petition).
The above stated allegations are supported by the Evidence affidavit of the Petitioner
and Ramesh Bettaiah (PW2).
Subsequently the brother of Petitioner got the policies cancelled and upon such
cancellation the refund of premium amount was made to the bank account of KMSS
as per Ex. P.88 and P.90 series. Reliance is placed on the email conversations
between Devendra Prasad.A (PW-11).Kittuswamy A. (PW-10) who is the Regional
Manager New India Assurance Co. Ltd. has stated in his evidence that the Flexi
Group Mediclaim policy is insured in the name of KMSS and that the premium was
paid by cheque. The adjustment voucher which records payment of advance premium
is marked as Ex.P.81.It is further stated that a letter dated 07.05.2018 (Ex.P.86) is an
intimation sent to KMSS regarding cancellation of Medi Assist Policies. Ex.P.90
series is identified by PW-10 as payment vouchers which reflect refund of premium
consequent to the cancellation of policy and the refund is made to KMSS.
Therefore, it is alleged that KMSS society carried out corrupt practices by making
payment for the insurance policies in favour of children studying within the
constituency from which Respondent No.2 was nominated in order to entice the
voters of the constituency.
(ii) Essentially, the notice was issued in the context of allegations made against
KMSS, while noticing that during the relevant period Sri C. Chennigappa, the father
of respondent No.1 was the President of KMSS. In the reply to the said notice, Sri
D.C.Venugopal has asserted that till Sri D.C. Venugopal was appointed as the

Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
President Sri C. Chennigappa, father of the respondent No.1 was the decision making
person. It was asserted that Sri Chennigappa had informed Sri D.C.Venugopal that
the KMSS did not make any transaction or payment to M/s.New India Assurance Co.
Ltd., and that it was ORCF which had made a request to provide data regarding the
poor students.
(iii) It is specifically brought out in the cross-
examination regarding Sri C. Chennigappa being Chairman of KMSS since 1992 to October 2018.
The relevant deposition of Sri D.C. Venugopal is as follows:-
"My father was Chairman of KMSS Trust since 1992 to October 2018.... Before I
became Chairman of KMSS, my father was looking after day-to-day affairs. My father
was the Authorized Signatory for the Bank Account between 2017 and 2018."
Thus, it becomes clear that Sri C. Chennigappa was incharge of day-to-day affairs till 2018.
(iv) Insofar as the role of KMSS, the specific defence is taken that respondent No.1 is not an office
bearer.
(v) It is asserted that KMSS and M/s. New India Assurance Co. Ltd., have no transactions amongst
them. it is averred that premium was paid by Sri T.L.Krishnamurthy, Founding Trustee of ORCF
and accordingly, there was no involvement of KMSS. It is submitted that even on cancellation, the
KMSS has not received the refund which was in fact received by another entity named KMSS.
(vi) It must be noted that Ex.P80 is on record and the policy has been taken out in the name of
KMSS. Irrespective of who has paid the premium, the policy at Ex.P80 would stand.
(vii) It must be noted that insofar as the distribution of Medi Assist cards, despite Media reports
regarding the same as per Ex.P10(a) and Ex.P11(a), there was no effort made by KMSS to distance
itself from alleged action of distribution of Medi Assist cards.
(viii) It is stated during cross-examination that except Sri B.H. Munisiddappa, all persons
mentioned in Ex.P6, list of Executive Members are family members. Ex.P6 is the list of Executive
Committee Members and when Sri D.C. Venugopal, who is the brother of respondent No.1 and
present President of KMSS was subjected to cross- examination subsequent to notice issued under
Section 99 of R.P. Act, insofar as the office bearers of KMSS are concerned, he has deposed as
follows:-
"Ex.P6 is the list of office bearers of KMSS for the year 2017-18. All the persons
mentioned in Ex.P6 are family members except B.H.Munisiddappa at Sl.No.6 ...
Apart from the list of office bearers in Ex.P6, there are no other office bearers."

Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
It is clear from the above that except Sri B.H.Munisiddappa, all the members of Executive
Committee of KMSS are related. Therefore, all others are admittedly the family members as per the
say of Sri D.C.Venugopal who being the present President of KMSS and there is no reason to
disbelieve such statement.
(ix) The proof of distribution of Medi Assist cards pursuant to the policy at Ex.P80 and the timing of
taking of the policy and distribution of Medi Assist cards by other persons as discussed supra would
all point to action being taken by KMSS to help respondent No.1 who was a family member in the
elections, which would be a presumption to be drawn relating to the conduct of KMSS in accordance
with the natural human conduct in terms of Section 114 of the Indian Evidence Act.
(x) The distribution by persons on behalf of respondent No.1 by his consent has been proved
through circumstantial evidence as per the discussion at para- 113.
(xi) Accordingly, it could be concluded that evidence would point out to the role of KMSS in the
commission of corrupt practice by facilitating the distribution of Medi Assist cards and not taking
any steps to distance itself from such distribution. It cannot be lost sight of that the question of
distribution of Medi Assist cards arose only consequent to the taking out of Medi Assist Policy as per
Ex.P80 in the name of KMSS. The circumstances read in its entirety would indicate that the
distribution of Medi Assist cards was with the consent of KMSS. Though respondent No.1 and RW2
have taken the specific stand that there was MoU between KMSS and ORCF, the same has not been
produced and the Noticee Sri D.C.Venugopal merely denies existence of such MoU and cannot be
believed in light of the specific stand by respondent No.1 and RW2, which evidence outweighs that
of Sri D.C. Venugopal. The fact that the Noticee admits that resolution was passed by KMSS for
collection of information and giving information to ORCF would indicate that there was a
relationship between the two, but the burden was upon KMSS to establish that beyond providing for
information, there was no other understanding between KMSS and ORCF. That burden has not
been discharged. No steps are taken to summon the MoU stated to be in possession of Police
Authorities as is revealed by RW2 and in the absence of taking steps to summon the said MoU from
custody of the Authorities, an adverse inference could be drawn under Section 114 of Indian
Evidence Act that steps were not taken to obtain such MoU, as it would go against the Noticee.
(xii) The evidence and material on record would indicate that KMSS has stood by and did not
distance itself from the distribution of Medi Assist cards which was in the name of KMSS. It can be
stated that KMSS has been an accessory and played a part in the entirety of the design of
commission of corrupt practice.
(xiii) However, as the KMSS is represented by Sri D.C. Venugopal as its President, who has
specifically stated that Sri C. Chennigappa was incharge of all affairs till October 2018 noticing that
all acts attributable to KMSS have been conducted prior to October 2018, in light of death of Sri C.
Chennigappa, it would be impermissible to name Sri D.C. Venugopal in terms of Section 99 of the
R.P. Act so as to inflict harsh penalties that may flow from naming Sri D.C. Venugopal.

Sri B Suresh Gowda vs Sri D C Gowrishankaraswamy on 30 March, 2023
(xiv) It is clarified that the effect of not naming the President only due to the technical reasons as
stated above, that would not water down the finding made in the main proceedings against KMSS.
Section 99 proceedings are limited to the naming of the person. In the case of KMSS, as it is a
separate entity, the question of naming would be of the person incharge at the relevant period of
time. Though the role of KMSS has been affirmed as an accessory in the commission of corrupt
practice, however, there is no sufficient material to name Sri D.C. Venugopal, as material reveals
that it was Sri C. Chennigappa was incharge of the proceedings at the relevant point of time.
(xv) The sending of notice under Section 99 of R.P. Act was specifically with respect to the President
of KMSS and in light of facts made out, no case is made out as regards naming of present President
Sri D.C. Venugopal.
153. After having recorded the findings on the issues, it is clear that case is made out for declaring
the election of respondent No.1 as void in terms of Section 100(1)(b) of R.P.Act. No grounds are
however made out for declaring the petitioner to be elected. Further, as discussed, no grounds have
been made out in terms of Section 100(2) of the R.P. Act so as to refrain from declaring the election
void, despite respondent No.1 being guilty of commission of corrupt practice by virtue of acts done,
found to be done with his consent.
154. In light of the above discussion and findings on the issues the following:-
Order
(a) The election of the returned candidate Sri D.C. Gowrishankaraswamy, Member of
Legislative Assembly, No.133 - Tumkur Rural Assembly Constituency having been
declared elected as per Form-21C dated 15.05.2018 is hereby declared to be void.
(b) The following persons are named in terms of Section 99(1)(a)(ii) of the R.P. Act
for having committed corrupt practice at the election, viz., Sri Palanethraiah. G, Sri
Arehalli Manjunath, Sri Krishnegowda, Smt.Renukamma and Smt.Sunanda
(Noticees);
(c) The Registrar to comply with the mandate under Rule 19 of the Election Petitions
Procedure Rules, Karnataka.
Accordingly, the Election Petition is allowed in part.
