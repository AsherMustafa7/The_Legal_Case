COMMON ORDER
The litigation between the applicants on the one hand and the respondents on the other hand
unfolds like a tactical game of Chess with two groups vying to checkmate the other. The events
herein below detailed would stand ample testimony to this.
Facts preceding the filing of the suit:
2. The applicants are the officials of the 7th respondent Federation, hereinafter
referred to as the Federation which is a Society registered http://www.judis.nic.in
O.A.Nos.310 & 312 of 2020 under the Tamil Nadu Societies Act, 1975, hereinafter
referred to as the Act. The operation of the Federation had started in the year 1950
and was registered on 12.12.1958 at Madras. The Federation is governed by its
Constitution and Byelaws and all the State Associations are the members of the
Federation.
3. Various litigations had arisen on account of the serious dispute between the 1st
applicant who is the President and the 6th respondent, who the applicants claim, was
the erstwhile General Secretary of the Federation. Disputes arose when the 6th
respondent had issued a separate notice calling for an elections after the President
had called for the elections and had appointed a three member committee in which
the 6 th respondent was the Honorary Secretary. Suits were filed challenging the
notice issued by the 6th respondent and ultimately this Court had upheld the notice
issued by the 1st applicant and an Election Officer, who was none less than a retired
Judge of the Honourable Supreme Court, was appointed as the Returning Officer to
conduct the elections to the various posts and for declaring the results.
http://www.judis.nic.in O.A.Nos.310 & 312 of 2020
4. Since there was some procedural glitches in the filing of the nominations for the various posts, the
results which was originally declared by the Returning Officer was set aside and the Returning
Officer was directed to conduct the elections once again by accepting fresh nominations for the
various posts and by reason of this order the election of persons to the various posts had been set
aside by the Honourable Division Bench and parties had reverted to status quo ante. Thereafter, the
Returning Officer had expressed his inability to continue and had recused himself. The plaintiff in
C.S.No.25 of 2020 has filed an application for appointing another Returning Officer and the same is
yet to be numbered.

5. In this scenario, the 10 Associations have called for a Special / Extraordinary General Body
Meeting by notice dated 31.03.2020 which was to be held on 22.04.2020 between 11 a.m. to 1 p.m at
Tivoli Grand Resort, Alipur, New Delhi. The notice was issued invoking Article 11 of the Constitution
of the Federation and Section 28 of the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act, hereinafter called the
Act. On 21.04.2020 just http://www.judis.nic.in O.A.Nos.310 & 312 of 2020 hours before the
meeting, the venue for the meeting was changed into the virtual world as it was informed that the
meeting would be conducted through "ZOOM" application. It is contended that nineteen out of
thirty three members have not participated and nine associations have confirmed that the minutes
and list of participants were fraudulent as they have not attended the said meeting.
6. It appears that in the impugned meeting several resolutions were taken, in and by which a five
member committee to administer the Federation was constituted. The applicants herein were
removed as Office Bearers. Some Associations were disaffiliated and some disaffiliated Associations
were brought back. It is challenging the said meeting and the resolutions therein that the present
suit has been filed. Relief sought for in the suit:
7. In the suit C.S.No.185 of 2020 the plaintiffs / applicants have sought for the following relief:

giving effect to the decisions taken at the “Special / Extra Ordinary General Body Meeting of the A

8. The following interim applications have also been filed along with the plaint seeking the following
reliefs:

“a) That there was no proper requisition from the members placed before the Office
Bearers and the requisitionists have not given any time for the office bearers to call
for the meeting;
b) The meeting that has been called for is contrary to the provisions of Section 28 of
the Act and Article 11 of the Constitution and Byelaws of the Federation;
c) The notice dated 21.04.2020 converting the physical meeting into the virtual
meeting is illegal and contrary to the law;
d) Majority of the members of the Federation, i.e., nineteen out of thirty three
members did not participate and nine Associations have confirmed that the minutes
drawn up for the meeting dated 22.04.2020 was fraudulent one as it shows that these
members have attended the meeting, where in reality they had not;
http://www.judis.nic.in O.A.Nos.310 & 312 of 2020
e) The meeting through Video Conference is not permissible as per the Act and as per the Byelaws of
the Federation as well;
f) Decision taken tends to upset the election process which already been set in motion;
g) The respondents have totally overthrown the electoral body by disaffiliating certain members and
affiliating certain others”

10. The learned counsels for the respondents particularly the learned Senior counsel and the
instructing counsel appearing for the 6th respondent were present. Though no counter was filed
elaborate arguments were made on behalf of the respondents and this Court heard the arguments of
all concerned.
Submissions:
11. Mr.P.S.Raman, Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the learned counsel for the applicants /
plaintiffs would contend that on 31.03.2020 notice had been given out by certain Associations who
are favourably disposed of towards the 6th respondent informing that they are
http://www.judis.nic.in O.A.Nos.310 & 312 of 2020 calling for a Special / Extraordinary General
Body Meeting of the Federation since the Honorary Secretary of the Federation (6th respondent
herein) had by his letter dated 29.03.2020 expressed his inability to call for the meeting and
therefore the requisitionist have themselves decided to call for the meeting.
12. The notice would further state that the meeting was to be held on 22.04.2020, Wednesday
between 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. at Tivoli Grand Resort, Alipur, New Delhi. The notice also provides that
persons who could not attend the meeting physically could attend the same via Audio / Video
conference or by e-mail. The notice also included the agendas for the meeting which were nine in
number. One of the agendas, namely, agenda no.2 was to discuss the various Court cases and the
agenda no.9 was to take a decision on monitoring and regulating the day to day functioning of the
Federation till fresh elections of the office bearers are conducted. The notice would indicate that 11
members have requisitioned the meeting. http://www.judis.nic.in O.A.Nos.310 & 312 of 2020
13. The learned senior counsel would further point out to this Court that on 21.04.2020 at about
10.43 p.m, the Haryana Chess Association of which the 1st respondent is a member had sent out an
e-mail stating that the Special / Extraordinary General Body Meeting was to be held on 22.04.2020
through the "ZOOM" platform. The e-mail also provides the meeting ID and Password. The learned
senior counsel would submit that this intimation of converting a physical meeting into Virtual
meeting is totally against the Bye-Laws of the Federation as also the provisions of the Act.
14. He would further argue that the 6th respondent had been removed from the post of the Secretary
and therefore his participation in the meeting and also his response to the Associations that he
cannot conduct the meeting is contrary, not only to the Bye-laws but also the known provisions of
the Act. The learned Senior counsel would further submit that neither in the notice dated
31.03.2020 nor in the e-mail dated 21.04.2020 had the respondents not been given any material
required for considering and passing resolutions on the agendas. However, the
http://www.judis.nic.in O.A.Nos.310 & 312 of 2020 Minutes would read as if the annexures were
earlier given to the members. However, the e-mail dated 21.04.2020 calling for the Zoom meeting
states that only the letter of the Honorary Secretary expressing his inability to call for a meeting and
the letter of requisitions dated 31.03.2020 are being enclosed, however even these documents are
not found attached to the e- mail. The learned senior counsel would submit that the conduct of the
fraudulent meeting was contrary to the directions issued by the Registrar of Societies. Infact a News
Bulletin dated 29.07.2020 issued by the Government clarified that the Societies cannot hold on-line
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99854720/ 6
P.R.Venketarama Raja vs Naresh Sharma on 31 March, 2020
meeting citing COVID - 19 as such a meeting was contrary to the provisions of Section 2 ( j), 15 (3) &
26 of the Act.
15. He would further submit that with a clear intent of disturbing the existing electoral body, the 6th
defendant had used the 10 Associations owing allegiance to him, to requisition a meeting and has
used the meeting to disaffiliate some of the associations and bring back some associations which had
been disaffiliated. He would further contend that the persons who had attended the meeting were
only Ad hoc members and not the http://www.judis.nic.in O.A.Nos.310 & 312 of 2020 affiliated
members.
16. The learned Senior Counsel would point out the haste with which the entire events preceding the
meeting had taken place. The requisition is stated to have been given on 27.03.2020, 28.03.2020
and 29.03.2020, the Secretary pleads inability to hold the meeting owing to pandemic vide e-mail
dated 29.03.2020 and on 31.03.2020, the notice for holding the Special General Body Meeting was
sent. The procedure adopted was totally contrary to the Bye-Laws. He would further submit that the
6th respondent had been removed from the post of Secretary on 30.03.2020 and he was therefore
not competent to hold the meeting. He would therefore pray that interim orders be granted
restraining the respondents 1 to 6 from interfering with the administration and the elections of
Federation, as prayed for.
17. Mr.J.Sivanandaraj, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the the 7th respondent would make
the following submissions:
He would submit that the Special Meeting was called for by a http://www.judis.nic.in
O.A.Nos.310 & 312 of 2020 Secretary of one of the Chess Associations, which is a
Member of the Federation. He would then draw the attention of this Court to
Bye-Laws of the Federation and he would submit that as per Article 11 of the Bye-
Laws a special Meeting of the General Body can be called:
a) By the Resolution of a Central Council;
b) On the requisition in writing of at least by 10 members of the Federation or;
c) By the President to consider such matter mentioned in the agenda.
On receipt of the requisition, the Secretary is required to give 14 clear days notice of such meetings
to all the Members with a copy of the proposed agenda. The meeting should be called within 30 days
of the receipt of the requisition. Under Bye-Law 15 (c), the notice of the meeting is required to be
issued by the Secretary. He would argue that in the instant case, notice of the meeting has not been
given by the Secretary as proposed under the Bye-Law but by one of the requisitionists.
http://www.judis.nic.in O.A.Nos.310 & 312 of 2020
18. The learned counsel would point out that it is the provisions of the Act which governs the
working of the Federation. Under Section 2 (a) the term 'committee' has been defined as the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99854720/ 7
P.R.Venketarama Raja vs Naresh Sharma on 31 March, 2020
“Governing body of a registered Society to whom the management of its affairs is entrusted."
19. Section 28 of the Act governs the procedure regarding Extraordinary General Body Meeting. As
per this provision, it is the Committee that can at any time call an Extraordinary General Body
Meeting within such period as may be prescribed after receipt of a requisition in writing from such
member as prescribed in the Bye-Laws of the Registered Society. Section 26 deals with the Annual
General Body meeting. Section 26 (3) talks about the contents of a notice of meeting. Section 26(2)
states that a notice of every general body meeting should be given by a registered society within such
period as prescribed before the day appointed for the meeting. The notice shall specify the day, hour
and place and the object of the meeting and, in case the agenda relates to the amendment of a
Bye-Law or object of Association, the same should be http://www.judis.nic.in O.A.Nos.310 & 312 of
2020 enclosed along with the notice. The learned counsel would therefore contend that the
requisitionist herein has not placed the requisition to the committee which at that point of time
consisted of the first applicant, second applicant and the sixth respondent. The sixth respondent
appears to have suo-moto informed the requisitionist that the meeting cannot be held in view of the
pandemic and the lock-down scenario. This refusal is stated to have been given on 29.03.2020 to
the requisitionists and the requisitionists have within two days fixed the date of meeting on
22.04.2020. He would submit that under the notice dated 31.03.2020 the physical meeting was to
be held at Tivoli Grand Resort Alipur, New Delhi. In the notice dated 31.03.2020, though the notice
states that Members could attend the same by Audio/Video conferencing or by Email, no weblink
details have been shared in the said notice. Therefore, the notice is flawed to the extent that there
are no details about how the video conference is proposed to be held and could not be considered a
notice of meeting. It is only in the e-mail dated 21.04.2020 that the details of the ZOOM Application
has been shared and this does conform to the procedure as prescribed under the Bye-Laws and
Section 26 & 28 of the http://www.judis.nic.in O.A.Nos.310 & 312 of 2020 Act and therefore, the
meeting is not valid. That apart, he would submit that the Secretary had been removed and
therefore the requisitionists ought not to have submitted the requisition to the Secretary and the
Secretary was not authorised to unilaterally reject the same without placing the same before the
committee, particularly when he had not challenged his removal. He would submit that the entire
exercise on the part of the 6th respondent was to change the electoral body as the present body,
according to the 6th respondent was not favourably disposed towards him and therefore with the
intent of bringing in members favourably disposed towards him the 6th respondent had stage
managed the entire meeting. He would submit that in the process, the respondents have altered the
electoral body and they have practically highjacked the entire electoral process. The procedure
contemplated under the bye-laws for disaffiliation has not been followed. Once this Court is seized
of the matter, the respondents ought to have moved the Court if they were in any manner aggrieved
by the vacuum that had been created due to the recusing of the returning officer.
http://www.judis.nic.in O.A.Nos.310 & 312 of 2020
20. Mr. Manishankar, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of Mr. Sanjay Chanda, learned
counsel for the 6th respondent, would submit that the entire process preceding the meeting dated
22.04.2020 had taken place after following the Bye-Laws of the Federation. He would submit that
since the 6th respondent who is the Secretary of the Federation and one of the Committee Members
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99854720/ 8
P.R.Venketarama Raja vs Naresh Sharma on 31 March, 2020
had declined to proceed with the meeting in the light of the Pandemic, the requisitionist had taking
recourse to the provisions of Article 11 and had called for the meeting. Therefore, there is nothing
illegal on the part of the respondents calling for the meeting. He would further submit that a perusal
of the minutes would clearly indicate that the Members had participated and had taken decisions
only after properly comprehending the agendas that were the subject matter of the meeting.
21. The learned Senior Counsel would submit that by no stretch of imagination can it be stated that
the 6th respondent had over reached the orders of this Court, since the 6th respondent was in no
way connected http://www.judis.nic.in O.A.Nos.310 & 312 of 2020 with the calling for the meeting
or its conduct. It is only the Members who had called for the meeting and who had taken the
decision unanimously.
22. The learned Senior Counsel would submit that once the meeting has been held as per the
procedure and the resolution passed by majority, the Court should not normally interfere in the
internal affairs of the society. He would submit that the applicants have not made out any prima
facie case and neither is balance of convenience in their favour. Therefore, he prays that the
applications have to be dismissed. Discussion:
23. Heard the counsels and perused the pleadings and documents both in C.S.No.25 of 2020 and
C.S.No.185 of 2020 in which suit the instant applications are filed.
24. The entire gamut of dispute centers around the meeting that was held on 22.04.2020, the
resolutions taken therein and the procedure adopted for convening the said meeting. This Court has
examined the http://www.judis.nic.in O.A.Nos.310 & 312 of 2020 notice of requisition, the notice of
meeting dated 31.03.2020 and the notice dated 21.04.2020 in great detail, since the arguments are
primarily based on the validity of the requisition for holding the meeting and the conduct of the
meeting as also the subject matters that had been discussed therein. A close scrutiny of these were
necessitated to find out if the applicants had made out a prima facie case for the grant of an order of
injunction.
25. The applicant has enclosed the notice calling for the meeting dated 31.03.2020 as one of the
documents. Prior to this notice, from a perusal of the typed set of papers filed in A.No.1438 of 2020
in C.S.No.25 of 2020, it is seen that on 27.03.2020, 28.03.2020 and 29.03.2020, 11 Associations
had addressed emails to the Honorary Secretary of the Federation ( who then was the 6th
respondent herein) calling upon the 6th respondent to call for a Special General Body Meeting of the
Federation as per the rights and powers vested on them by Article 11 of the Constitution of the
Federation and Section 28 of the Act. Each of these notices would state that the meeting was called
to discuss important issues relating to:
a) issue relating to AICF including staff payments;
http://www.judis.nic.in O.A.Nos.310 & 312 of 2020
b) Website and Email issue
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99854720/ 9
P.R.Venketarama Raja vs Naresh Sharma on 31 March, 2020
c) Court matters
c) Fresh elections
e) Exorbitant remuneration projected by the Returning Officer, etc.
26. Following are the associations who have made the requisition:
S.No. Date of E-mail Name of the Association
1 27.03.2020 All Arunachal Pradesh Chess
Association
2 27.03.2020 All Assam Chess Association
3 27.03.2020 Gujarat State Chess Association
4 27.03.2020 The Haryana Chess Association
5 27.03.2020 Sikkim Chess Association
6 27.03.2020 Uttarakhand Chess Association
7 27.03.2020 Chess Association of Uttaranchal
8 28.03.2020 Delhi Chess Association
9 28.03.2020 All Bihar Chess Association
10 28.03.2020 Chandigarh Chess Association
11 29.03.2020 All Jharkhand Chess Association
27. The 6th respondent has sent an e-mail dated 29.03.2020 stating as follows:
http://www.judis.nic.in O.A.Nos.310 & 312 of 2020 “ With reference to your above
referred requisition on behalf of more than 10 members state association to call a
Special/Extraordinary General Body Meeting of AICF, I would like to inform you that
due to pandemic of Corona Virus and at the restrictions imposed by the Govt on the
social gathering and travelling, it would not be possible for the AICF to call this
meeting as requested by you” Therefore it is clearly evident that the 6th respondent
who was fully conversant with the Act and Bye-Laws of the Federation was aware that
a physical meeting cannot be held during this period of the pandemic.
28. On 31.03.2020, the Honorary Secretary of Chandigarh Chess Association informed All Member
State/UT Associations that on the request of the 10 Member State/UT Associations of the
Federation, the meeting is to be held on Wednesday, 22.04.2020 at 11 am to 1 pm at Tivoli Grand
Resort, Alipur, New Delhi. The notice goes on to state that Members who are unable to attend the
meeting physically can attend the same by Audio/Video Conferencing or by Email. It beats logic as
to how a Special General Body Meeting can be attended by a member http://www.judis.nic.in
O.A.Nos.310 & 312 of 2020 through email. Further the notice does not throw any light as to whether
the same has been addressed to all the Member Associations since the mail only contains a BCC to
the following email Id namely "DelhiChess64 @ gmail.com". The notice further lists out 9 agendas
for the meeting.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99854720/ 10
P.R.Venketarama Raja vs Naresh Sharma on 31 March, 2020
29. In the letters of the requisitionists dated 27.03.2020, 28.03.2020 and 29.03.2020
requisitionists had clearly indicated that they wanted only the subjects relating to staff payments,
website and mail issues, Court matters, fresh elections and exorbitant remuneration projected by
the Returning Officer to be discussed. However, in the 31.03.2020 notice, agendas 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9
appear to have been included which does not find a place in the requisitionist letter. In fact, the
requisitionist had specifically requested that the agenda for election should be discussed. However,
that agenda has not been included and in that place the 9th agenda has been included. After receipt
of this letter, two of the requisitionists by their email dated 30.03.2020 and 31.03.2020 made the
following statement “looking forward to receive the invite of this meeting as soon as country returns
to normalcy after winning the pandemic Covid- http://www.judis.nic.in O.A.Nos.310 & 312 of 2020
19”. This email has been sent by the All Arunachal Pradesh Chess Association and the Meghalaya
Chess Association. Therefore, these two associations had made it clear that they would be inclined to
attend the meeting after the Covid situation had eased out (This is found in page 317 of typed set of
papers filed along with CS.No.185 of 2020). On 21.04.2020 at 10:43:09 p.m, the first respondent
has issued an email to various associations informing them that he was enclosing a request sent to
the 6th respondent by members of State Association calling for a Special / Extraordinary General
Body meeting of the Federation and also the letter of the 6th respondent expressing his inability to
call for the meeting. This email does not make any reference to the notice of meeting dated
31.03.2020 but would go on to state as follows:
" These documents are sent to you in reference with the Special / Extraordinary
General Body Meeting to be held on 22.04.2020 and the link for conducting the
online meeting through ZOOM platform is appended herein.”
30. A reading of this E-mail would indicate that this is the first notice of the meeting
issued to all the Members (This e-mail is addressed http://www.judis.nic.in
O.A.Nos.310 & 312 of 2020 to the e-mail addresses of all the member Associations
unlike the notice dated 31.03.2020). The contents of this E-mail assume significance
since not only does it not refer to the email dated 31.03.2020, but the notice of
meeting dated 31.03.2020 is also not enclosed. This notice therefore can only be
considered as fresh notice of meeting. Therefore, taking into account the above
factors, it is evident that the meeting called for by the e- mail dated 21.04.2020 is not
in conformity with the provisions of Sections 26 and 28 of the Act, which clearly
stipulate that a meeting should be called for within such period as prescribed after
the receipt of the requisition. Further the provisions of the Act does not provide for a
virtual meeting of the General Body which has also been clarified in the News
Bulletin of the Government referred supra in paragraph no.14.
31. Article 11 of the Bye-Laws would state that the Secretary should give 14 clear days
notice of the meeting to all the Members with copies of the proposed agenda and
further that the meeting should be called for within 30 days from the date of the
requisition. A reading of the email dated 21.04.2020 would indicate that requisition
of the meeting and its http://www.judis.nic.in O.A.Nos.310 & 312 of 2020 rejection
by the 6th respondent was being conveyed only through this email and the meeting

P.R.Venketarama Raja vs Naresh Sharma on 31 March, 2020
was proposed to be held within a few hours of the issue of the notice of meeting. In
these circumstances, the only conclusion that can be drawn is that the email dated
21.04.2020 was a fresh notice of meeting. Therefore, the meeting held on 22.04.2020
on the basis of this flawed notice of meeting is also an invalid meeting.
32. That apart, the agenda which was sought for by the requestionist and the agenda
that was alleged to be discussed in the meeting dated 22,04.2020 are totally different.
33. The applicants have argued that the requisitionists have not followed the
procedure in submitting the requisition. The notice which is required to be addressed
to the Committee as contemplated under the Act and the Bye-Laws is addressed to
the Secretary and the Secretary without consulting the committee has unilaterally
rejected the request. http://www.judis.nic.in O.A.Nos.310 & 312 of 2020
34. Further procedure has not been followed while calling for the meeting. The
requisitionists have clearly stated that they are making the requisition as per Article
11 and Section 28 of the Act. Article 11 does not specify as to whom the requisition has
to be made. However, a reading of section 28 of the Act, which is the basis on which
the requisition is made, would stipulate that it is the committee to which the
requisition has to be made. The committee on receipt of the requisition, should call
for the meeting. The Bye-Laws prescribe that it is the Secretary who has to issue the
notice of the meeting. However, the notice dated 31.03.2020 and e- mail dated
21.04.2020 have been issued by the requisitionist. Further, a reading of the email
from the 6th respondent, turning down the request of the requisitionist is not an
outright refusal but only a statement that in the current scenario of Covid-19 it was
not possible to hold the meeting.
35. The next ground on which the meeting appears to be flawed is on the basis of the
agenda that has been discussed and passed in the meeting. The Bye-Laws of the
Federation confers the right to disaffiliate a http://www.judis.nic.in O.A.Nos.310 &
312 of 2020 member with the Central Council. A reading of Article 16(b)(4) would
indicate that the Central Council has the power to disaffiliate any member of the
Federation for committing misconduct or otherwise and thereafter refer the same to
the General Body in its next available meeting for its consideration. On the basis of
the decision received from the Central council, the members of the General Body are
given the powers under Article 9 of the Bye-Laws of the Association to disaffiliate
members, the General Body cannot independently disaffiliate any member since it is
the Central Council which is the executive body of the Federation and which is vested
with all the powers of the Federation including disaffiliation of members as well. In
other words the decision of the Central Council is only ratified by the General Body.
36. A reading of the minutes of the meeting dated 22.04.2020 would show that in the
meeting dated 22.04.2020 by invoking the power under Article 9 , the members have
restored the affiliation of associations which have been disaffiliated and disaffiliated

P.R.Venketarama Raja vs Naresh Sharma on 31 March, 2020
the memberships of some of the Associations. In the meeting held on 22.04.2020 the
electoral body which http://www.judis.nic.in O.A.Nos.310 & 312 of 2020 had come
into existence on the day when this Court appointed the returning Officer to hold the
elections viz. on 28.01.2020 has been overturned. By their action, the respondents
have tried to circumvent the electoral body that had crystallized on the date of the
order of this court to hold elections. Even on this ground, the decisions taken in the
meeting have to necessarily be injuncted. The requisitionists had only wanted to
discuss holding fresh election but however the 6th respondent appears to have
pushed his personal agenda of taking over the administration and control of the
Federation by removing the 3 member committee and substituting it with a 5
member committee. A very reading of the minutes dated 22.04.2020 would clearly
indicate the active role that has been played by the 6th respondent in achieving his
end. To borrow a Chess terminology the meeting of 22.04.2020 appears to be a
"double attack it not only disturbs the electoral body but also the constitution of the
Committee which existed on the date when this Court had directed the holding of the
election".
37. In a nutshell the meeting dated 22.04.2020 and the resolutions http://www.judis.nic.in
O.A.Nos.310 & 312 of 2020 adopted therein are bad for the following reasons:
(i) Request for holding the Special General Body meeting is not as per the prescribed
procedure.
(ii) Notice of meeting does not conform to the Bye-
Laws and Act regarding the time limit and therefore the meeting held on the basis of this notice is
invalid.
(iii) Notice not called for by the person authorised to do so by the Bye-Laws of the Federation.
(iv) The resolutions passed are contrary to the Bye- Laws and the constitution of the Federation.
(v) The resolutions adopted in the meeting dated 22.04.2020 over turns the electoral body that had
crystallised as on the date when this Court had passed the orders for holding the election.
38. From the discussion above, it is clear that the calling for the meeting, conduct of the meeting and
the resolutions adopted therein are totally contrary to the Bye-Laws and the Act and therefore the
applicant http://www.judis.nic.in O.A.Nos.310 & 312 of 2020 has made a prima facie case for grant
of injunction and balance of convenience is also in favour of the applicant for the grant of the ad
interim injunction. Therefore, there shall be an ad-interim injunction as prayed for until further
orders. The applicants shall comply with the provisions of Order XXXIX Rule 3 of the Code of Civil
Procedure. Post the mater on 27.09.2020 for counter of respondents.
