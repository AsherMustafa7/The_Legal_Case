And this Hon'ble Court be pleased to pass any further order/orders or
direction/directions as this Hon'ble Court deems fit and proper in the facts and
circumstances of the case."
2. On a careful reading of the reliefs, quoted hereinbefore, it is emerged that in all these writ
petitions the petitioners essentially seek to quash the notification no. 5465/SME., dated 11.03.2020
issued by the Government of Odisha in School & Mass Education Department, pursuant to the
policy framed vide notification no.10442/SME dated 14.05.2018, for rationalization and
consolidation of schools under School & Mass Education (S&ME) Department, as well as the
consequential office memorandum no. 5538/SME., dated 11.03.2020 for implementation of
guidelines for the policy of rationalization and consolidation of schools. Therefore, all these writ
petitions have been heard together, along with other // 8 // batch of cases, and are disposed of by
this common judgment which will govern in all the cases.
3. In course of hearing, Mr. S. Parida, learned Senior Standing Counsel appearing for the State
contended that since the notification no. 5465/SME., dated 11.03.2020 and subsequent office
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148064781/ 4
School Managing Committee Of vs State Of Odisha & Others ..... Opp. ... on 4 May, 2021
memorandum no. 5538 dated 11.03.2020 have been issued pursuant to the policy decision of the
Government taken vide notification no.10442/SME dated 14.05.2018, thereby, to justify such policy
decision counter affidavit has been filed by opposite party no.1 in W.P.(C) No. 27401 of 2020 and
the same is adopted in all the cases.
4. Therefore, the relief sought in all these writ petitions being analogous and the cause of action
involved therein being similar, with the consent of the learned counsel appearing for the respective
parties and for the sake of convenience and brevity, the facts of W.P.(C) No. 27401 of 2020 are
referred to, in a nutshell, for just and proper adjudication of all the cases.
// 9 //
5. The factual matrix, as asserted in W.P.(C) No. 27401 of 2020, is that Amaramunda Government
Primary School was established in the year 1954. It is one of the oldest institutions in the locality.
The said school is imparting education from Class-I to V. There are two teachers working in the said
school. As such, the school in question has got sufficient infrastructure, i.e., five class rooms with a
pucca building. For the year 2019-20, the roll strength of the said school was 33. Thereby, the
authorities directed the Headmaster of the School not to give admission to the children in Class-I.
Had the admission been made in Class-I in 2020, then certainly the strength of the school would
have been increased beyond 42, as nine guardians of village Amaramunda were interested to admit
their wards in Class-I of the said school. Most of the population of the village Amaramunda
belonged to SC and OBC communities. Although since 1954, the said school is catering education to
the need of local children of that area, basing upon the Government order dated // 10 //
27.08.2020, the Block Education Officer, Agalpur, vide office order no.1048 dated 16.09.2020
directed for merger/ consolidation of Amaramunda Government Primary School with Laxmanpali
Project U.P. School, even though the roll strength of the school was 33. Such direction was issued
basing on the notification No. 5465/SME., dated 11.03.2020 with regard to rationalization and
consolidation of schools under School and Mass Education (S&ME) Department and subsequent
office memorandum no. 5538 dated 11.03.2020 with regard to implementation of guidelines for the
policy of rationalization and consolidation of schools.
6. Mr. K.K. Swain, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner in W.P.(C) No.27401 of 2020
contended that the Government Notification No.5465/SME dated 11.03.2020 for rationalization and
consolidation of schools under School and Mass Education Department and consequential office
memorandum no.5538/SME dated 11.03.2020 with // 11 // regard to implementation of
rationalization of policy decision cannot sustain in the eye of law. As a consequence thereof, the
notification no.11842/SME., dated 27.08.2020 issued by the Govt. of Odisha in S&ME Department
with regard to rationalization and consolidation of schools also cannot sustain. Thereby, the
direction given by the Block Education Officer, Agalpur vide Annexure-2 dated 16.09.2020, in
pursuance of notification no.11842/SME., dated 27.08.2020, for merger of school also cannot
sustain, as the same is violative of the provisions contained in Right of Children to Free and
Compulsory Education Act, 2009 (for short the "Act, 2009") read with Odisha Right of Children to
Free and Compulsory Education Rules, 2010 (for short the "Rules, 2010"). It is further contended
that as defined under Section 2(f) of the Act, 2009, the elementary education means the education
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148064781/ 5
School Managing Committee Of vs State Of Odisha & Others ..... Opp. ... on 4 May, 2021
from first class to eighth class. Thereby, the impugned notification no.5465/SME., dated 11.03.2020
and office memorandum no. 5538 dated 11.03.2020 with regard to // 12 // implementation of
guidelines for the policy of rationalization and consolidation of schools also cannot sustain in the
eye of law, being contrary to the provisions contained under the Act, 2009 and Rules, 2010.
It is further contended that under the Act, 2009, there is no provision for limiting roll strength of
the students in a school. In the name of rationalization and consolidation of schools, as a policy
decision of the Government, the roll strength of a school cannot and should not be limited to a
particular strength. It is further contended that the policy decision of the Government cannot be
contrary to the statutory provisions governing the field, particularly under the Act, 2009 and Rules,
2010. It is also further contended that it is the Central Government, which is empowered under the
Act to remove the discrepancies. Therefore, if any difficulties are faced by the State Governments,
they have to approach the Central Government under the provisions of law, instead of framing a
policy on their // 13 // own for merger of schools, which is contrary to the provisions of law.
It is further contended that vide notification no.4661/SME., dated 25.02.2019, transport facilities
for children of elementary schools have been provided, while issuing the notification for
implementing policy decision of the Government for merger of schools, which is not permissible
under the Rules, 2010. It is emphatically submitted further that Rule-6(2) of the Rules, 2010 when
provides for up-gradation of schools, merger of schools is not permissible and any action taken also
cannot sustain in the eye of law. Section-20 of the Act, 2009 stipulates that power to amend the
schedule is only available with the Central Government, but not by any other authority, and thereby
issuance of such policy decision, which touches the provisions of the Act, 2009 and Rules, 2010
framed thereunder, cannot sustain in the eye of law. As a result thereof, in view of issuance of the
notification no.5465 dated 11.03.2020 for rationalization and consolidation of schools under // 14 //
School & Mass Education (S&ME) Department and subsequent notification no.5538 dated
11.03.2020 for implementation of guidelines for such policy decision, the elementary education
concept would lose its efficacy, if merger of schools would be taken place pursuant to such
notification or office memorandum, as mentioned above. Thereby, he seeks for quashing of the said
notification and consequential office memorandum and directions issued by the individual
authorities to individual institutions mentioned in the different writ petitions.
To substantiate his contentions, he has relied upon Laxman Dundappa Dhamanekar v. Management
of Vishwa Bharata Seva Samiti, (2001) 8 SCC 378; Punjab Water Supply & Sewerage Board v.
Ranjodh Singh, AIR 2007 SC 1082; Santosh Kumar Sahu v. District Judge, Kalahandi-Nuapada,

7. Mr. A.K. Pandey, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners in W.P.(C) No.11704 of 2020
contended that notification no.5465 dated 11.03.2020 and consequential office memorandum
no.5538 dated 11.03.2020 in the shape of // 16 // implementation of guidelines for the policy of
rationalization and consolidation/merger of schools cannot be construed to be a policy decision of
the Government and at best the same can be construed to be executive instructions. More so, an
executive instruction cannot supersede the statutory provisions governing the field. It is further
contended that the policy decision has to be published in the official gazette and the same has not
been done in the instant case.
8. Mr. R. Roy, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner in W.P.(C) No.30808 of 2020 contended
that before taking any action for merger of schools, the managing committees of the institutions
have not been consulted. It is therefore followed that by exercising arbitrary and unreasonable
power, direction has been given for merger of schools relying upon the notification no.5465 dated
11.03.2020 and subsequent office memorandum no.5538 dated 11.03.2020 with regard to guidelines
for implementation of policy decision, which cannot sustain in the eye of law. It is further contended
// 17 // that the roll strength cannot be a ground for merger of the schools de hors the provisions of
law governing the field. Thereby, he seeks for quashing of the notification no.5465 dated 11.03.2020
as well as office memorandum no. 5538 dated 11.03.2020 and consequential order passed by the
authority concerned.
9. Mr. B.S. Rayaguru, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners in W.P.(C) No.11603 of 2021
contended that even if the impugned notifications, as referred to above, are outcome of a policy
decision of the State Government, the same can be subject matter of judicial review, if the same are
illegal, irrational and contrary to the provisions of law. To substantiate his contention, he has relied
upon State of NCT of Delhi v. Sanjeev @ Bitoo, (2005) 5 SCC 181; Ramana Dayaram Sethy v.
International Airport Authority of India, (1979) 3 SCC 489; and State of Punjab v. Brijeswar Singh
Chahal, (2016) 6 SCC 1.
10. Mr. A.K. Mohanty-A, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner in W.P.(C) No.8275 of 2021 //
18 // contended that the report of the competent authority has not been taken into consideration
while passing the order of merger of school and, thereby, the same cannot sustain in the eye of law.
In support of his contention, he has relied upon the judgment of this Court in Basanta Kumar Sahoo
v. State of Odisha, 2018 (II) ILR CUT-
200.
11. Mr. D.N. Rath, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner in W.P.(C) No.14289 of 2021 and Mr.
D.P. Dhal, learned counsel for the petitioners in W.P.(C) No.2600 of 2021 also reiterated the
contentions raised by learned counsel for the petitioners in other writ petitions, as mentioned above.
12. Mr. S. Parida, learned Senior Standing Counsel appearing for School and Mass Education
Department, referring to counter affidavit filed by opposite party no.1, contended that the State
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148064781/ 7
School Managing Committee Of vs State Of Odisha & Others ..... Opp. ... on 4 May, 2021
Government has introduced a policy of rationalization and consolidation of schools vide School and
Mass Education Department notification no.5465 dated // 19 // 11.03.2020 under Annexure-3 to
W.P.(C) No.27401 of 2020 with the objectives (1) to reduce the number of educationally and
economically sub-optimal schools; (2) to rationalize and consolidate existing schools to reduce the
category of schools thus fix the range category to only four, i.e. I-V, I-VIII, I-X & VI-X; (3) to create
as many integrated secondary schools as possible hence provide education up to high school level in
one single campus, improving transition; and (4) to consolidate standalone Upper Primary and
Secondary Schools. The exercise of consolidation is to be conducted in the manner so as to ensure
optimum number of schools with optimum environment, create as many integrated secondary
schools as possible and convert all other schools having reasonable enrolment to any of the four
categories of schools as mentioned in the objectives of the policy, as indicated above. It is further
contended that on the basis of such policy decision, guidelines to implement the policy of
rationalization and consolidation of schools was issued by the Government in the Department of
School // 20 // and Mass Education vide office memorandum no.5538 dated 11.03.2020. The
primary objective of such rationalization and consolidation is to improve the learning environment
and outcomes for students. This will be achieved by streamlining and increasing teacher per grade,
with better infrastructure and concentrated investment of resources. Consolidation will lead to fully
functional schools that have adequate teachers, infrastructure and resources. Consolidation will also
lead to a large number of integrated schools (schools that are from I-X or VI-X) so that transition
rate up to grade 10 is smooth and continuous and reduces dropout. This will also improve learning
and institutional time available to teachers and students through reduction in administrative burden
on teachers. It is further contended that at all times, the interest of the students will be the guiding
principle of the consolidation exercise. Hence the rationalization and consolidation policy aims to
achieve the following objectives:
// 21 //
1. Improve learning outcomes.
2. Make schools aspirational for students with a larger peer group and better sources.
3. Improvement of Pupil-Teacher Ratio (PTR) and Teacher per Grade ratio.
4. Better infrastructure facilities.
5. Better academic environment with additional Teaching Learning Materials (TLM)
facilities, e-learning and curricular facilities.
6. Improve quality of monitoring.
7. Vibrant parent community as enrolment increases and PTMs stabilize.
8. Better transition rate and school management.

School Managing Committee Of vs State Of Odisha & Others ..... Opp. ... on 4 May, 2021
Thereby, it is contended that as per the provisions enumerated under the government notification
dated 11.03.2020, which is impugned herein, the Government upon careful examination have laid
down certain principles for consolidation of schools. While laying down the provisions and
principles for consolidation of schools as per the guidelines the Government Primary/Upper
Primary schools with low enrolment, having another elementary school within a reasonable
distance, are to // 22 // be consolidated with nearby schools with better enrolment and/or better
infrastructure. The basis on which the schools are to be selected for consolidation are mentioned in
Table-1 furnished to the said notification dated 11.03.2020. It is contended that on a close scrutiny
of the said table mentioned in the notification dated 11.03.2020 it is apparently clear that the
primary school having less than 40 students within a non- scheduled area within a distance of 1 KM
of any elementary school shall be merged with the lead school. Besides the above, on a meticulous
reading of government notification dated 11.03.2020, it is made clear that the Government in the
Department of School and Mass Education, while formulating the norms and guidelines for
rationalization and consolidation of schools, classified the consolidation under different categories.
It is further contended that under the government notification dated 11.03.2020, the school with
highest class in group shall normally be the lead school with which other school (satellite school)
will // 23 // consolidate, provided it has sufficient infrastructure and suitable location. In case there
is more than one school having the eligibility for being the lead school, the District Level
Consolidation Committee may decide as to which school will be selected as lead school. Thereby, the
District Level Consolidation Committee, upon verification of the necessary factors, such as the roll
strength of the satellite and lead school, the distance between two schools, the natural barrier if any
between the two schools and other basic requirement for the purpose of consolidation of the
concerned school, takes decision for merger of schools. Consequentially, no illegality or irregularity
has been committed by issuance of such notification, which is sought to be quashed by this Court in
exercise of the power of judicial review under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
It is further contended that so far as the petitioner-school is concerned, the student strength is 33
i.e. below 40. Therefore, the petitioner-school attracts sl. no.3 of the table mentioned in the
notification dated // 24 // 11.03.2020 and, as such, rationalization and consolidation has been done
as per roll strength for the year 2019-20. As such, the student strength was uploaded by the school
concerned in the Odisha School Education Programme Authority portal, for which the school was
considered for rationalization and consolidation for two reasons, i.e., (i) the student strength of the
petitioner-school is 33, i.e. below 40; and
(ii) distance between satellite school and lead school is 800 meters, which is well within 1 KM.
Thereby, there is no arbitrary or unreasonable exercise of power of the authority directing for such
merger of school. So far as other writ petitions are concerned, similar distance factors have been
taken into consideration, which have been mentioned in different slabs of the table indicated in the
notification dated 11.03.2020. As a consequence thereof, the decision taken by the authority is well
justified and should not be interfered with in exercise of the power under judicial review as
exercised by this Court and, more so, this Court is not sitting as an // 25 // appellate authority over
the decision taken by the authority to have the merger of schools.

14. Before delving into the notification no. 5465/SME., dated 11.03.2020 for rationalization and
consolidation of schools under the School and Mass Education (S&ME) Department, for just and
proper adjudication of the case, some of the office notes, which gave rise to issuance of such
notification, are referred to below:-
"Noting No.1:
The Notification of Merger of Government Upper Primary Schools with
nearby/adjacent Government High Schools was issued vide No. 16167 dtd.
30.08.2017. (16167-Page1). The step was taken for optimum utilization of available
resources and Government, after careful consideration decided to merge 1603
Government Upper Primary Schools with adjacent/nearby Govt. High Schools.
It was dealt in the Section File bearing No. SME-GHE-GHS-0080-2015.
Further an addendum was issued vide No. 5113 dtd. 13.03.2018(5113~page1)
regarding naming of the Nodal High Schools after merger.
Since last two decades there has been expansion of access to schools and at present
there is hardly any un-served habitation left in the state. One of the important factors
affecting the pace of growth in quality education is lack of adequate number of
teachers in many schools. Ironically, many schools are running with very less number
of teachers in our state although it has a high highly favourable PTR i.e. 23:1 against
the // 31 // RTE Norm 40:1. This is the reason way a continuous effort has been
made in last 10 years to rationalize the teachers. But rationalization of teachers alone
has not solved the acute problem of vacancy of teachers in many schools especially
those located in rural & remote areas.
As discussed in the meeting the DSE(O) has furnished a draft notification on Policy of
Rationalisation of Schools which is attached below.
Accordingly the file is submitted for kind perusal and further orders.

"Noting No.2:
Notes above explain.
No formal proposal of DSE(O) for rationalization of schools has been received rather
a draft Notification has been received in this regard on personal contact and placed
herewith for kind consideration and orders of Government.
As revealed, it is proposed that such rationalization process is proposed to be made
for improvement of quality education and availability of teaching as well as material
resources to pace cope with the exponential growth of elementary and secondary
schools in the state since last two decades.
The details of such proposed rationalization has been shown in the draft Notification
placed in the correspondence side may be seen.
It is relevant to mention here that Government has already taken effective steps for
merger of 1603 nos. of nearby/adjacent Government U.P. Schools with that nos. of
Government High Schools in the State placed either in one campus or the adjacent
campuses vide this Department Notification No.16167 dt.30.08.2017 and subsequent

below may be seen.
As intimated it is widely alleged that the proposal submitted by the district authority
for merger of Schools in different districts are not properly examined and in many
cases local issues were ignored. This aspect lead to lot of resentment. Besides, in the
mid of the session it would not be prudent to further implement any merger proposal.

Hence, as intimated immediate instruction be issued to the DEOs to further examine
the merger and submit their report for further examination at Government level.
In other way Hon'ble Minister, S& ME have also intimated for necessary instruction
to the field authority for keeping an hold of the merger process.
Kind orders of Principal Secretary on the kind observation/order of Hon'ble Minister
may be seen on the body of the UOI.
It is to mention here that taking into account the successful implementation of the
earlier principle issued in this regard among the 1603 nos. of adjacent and nearby UP
Schools with that of the Govt. High Schools further steps have been taken for
extending the principle of merger to different Govt. Schools within a radius of 100
mtrs and even in certain cases where the student strength is less than 20.
The detail benefits/goal of such merger has been explained in this Department
Notification No.10442 dt. 14.5.18 may be seen.
Although a no. of benefits are there in the merger policy of Government, but also a
no. of allegations are received against the policy mainly on distance problems,
hazardous communication problem and local politics among the different villages so
also the naming of Schools etc. It is further to mention here that various
representations are also received for welcoming the principle of merger and request
for merger of their Schools with the nearby Schools.
In face of above fact and circumstances the file may be submitted before Principal
Secretary for kind orders on the UOI note received from the Hon'ble Minister, S&ME.

16. The facts narrated above are not in dispute. As it appears the Government in

schools, issued notification no.5465 dated 11.03.2020 and also office memorandum
no.5538 dated 11.03.2020 in the shape of guidelines for // 50 // implementation of
rationalization and consolidation of schools. The principles as enumerated under
Clause-3- A(1)(a) of the notification no.5465 dated 11.03.2020 laid down that
"Government Elementary and Secondary Schools having enrollment less than or
equal to 20 to be consolidated with nearby schools irrespective of distance" was
modified by issuing a corrigendum dated 14.12.2020 in Annexure-A/1 series at page
116 of the brief stating that "Government Elementary and Secondary Schools having
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148064781/ 27
School Managing Committee Of vs State Of Odisha & Others ..... Opp. ... on 4 May, 2021
enrollment less than or equal to 15 in Scheduled & KBK areas and less than or equal
to 20 in other areas to be consolidated with nearby schools irrespective of distance"
and the word "20 or less" appearing in the Table-1: Distance and Enrollment Norms
for Consolidation, in 1st row at Sl. No.1, Column-
4 with the heading Scheduled area as attached to Para-3 of the said Notification may
be read as "15 or less in Scheduled and KBK areas". As per para-3.(A)(1) of the
notification no.5465/SME dated 11.03.2020, a school having lower roll strength shall
be treated as a satellite // 51 // school and the school to which the satellite school will
be merged, that school having higher roll strength will be treated as a Lead School. As
per the corrigendum dated 14.12.2020, paragraph-3-A(1)(a) of the notification
no.5465 dated 11.03.2020 has been modified to the above extent. The table-1 of the
notification no.5465 dated 11.03.2020 states about the categories of the schools, i.e.
Primary, Upper Primary and Secondary Schools and about their enrollment and the
nearby distance of the said schools regarding merger.
Paragraph-3.2 of the notification no.5465 dated 11.03.2020 provides about different
types of merger/ consolidation i.e. (i) Horizontal Consolidation; and (ii) Vertical
Consolidation. Horizontal Consolidation means consolidation of same range of
schools, that means Primary Schools with Primary Schools, Upper Primary Schools
with Upper Primary Schools and Secondary Schools with Secondary Schools. So far
as Vertical Consolidation is concerned, it means consolidation/ merger of different
range of schools, i.e. one Primary // 52 // School with Upper Primary School, one
Primary School with Secondary School or one Upper Primary School with Secondary
School. So far as paragraph-2(b) of the notification no.5465 dated 11.03.2020 is
concerned there are two types of consolidation/merger of schools, i.e. (i) physical
consolidation and (ii) administrative consolidation. In case of physical consolidation
one or more schools shall be consolidated with the Lead School and in such case, the
students, staff, records and movable assets will be physically shifted to the Lead
School from the Satellite School. So far as administrative consolidation is concerned,
two or more schools shall be consolidated for the purpose of optimum utilization of
available resources under unified administrative supervision. Therefore, the very
notification no.5465 dated 11.03.2020 issued by the Government in School and Mass
Education Department under Annexure-3 to W.P.(C) No.27401 of 2020 and the
corrigendum dated 14.12.2020 under Annexure-A/1 series filed by opposite party
no.1, which provides the mechanism/modalities // 53 // relating to
consolidation/merger of schools i.e. Primary School, Upper Primary School and
Secondary School.
The main ground of consolidation/merger of school as per notification no.5465 dated
11.03.2020 read with the corrigendum dated 14.12.2020 is based on the roll strength
of the school. Therefore, question arises whether the State Government can take a
policy decision for merger of schools on the basis of roll strength or not.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148064781/ 28
School Managing Committee Of vs State Of Odisha & Others ..... Opp. ... on 4 May, 2021
The note sheets, which have been referred to above, clearly indicate that the
Government have taken all endeavour for merger of schools purely on the basis of roll
strength and while taking such steps the constitutional mandate read with statutory
provisions have been given a go by.
17. Article-21-A, which has been inserted by the Constitution (Eighty-sixth
Amendment) Act, 2002, Sec.2 and has come into force w.e.f. 01.04.2010, reads as
follows:-
"21-A. Right to Education-The State shall provide free and compulsory education to
all children of the age of six to fourteen years in // 54 // such manner as the State
may, by law, determine."
At this juncture, it is worthwhile to refer to Article-246, which reads as follows:-
"246. Subject-matter of laws made by Parliament and by the Legislatures of
States.--(1) Notwithstanding anything in clauses (2) and (3), Parliament has exclusive
power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I in the
Seventh Schedule (in this Constitution referred to as the ―Union List").
(2) Notwithstanding anything in clause (3), Parliament, and, subject to clause (1), the
Legislature of any State 1 *** also, have power to make laws with respect to any of the
matters enumerated in List III in the Seventh Schedule (in this Constitution referred
to as the ―Concurrent List").
(3) Subject to clauses (1) and (2), the Legislature of any State has exclusive power to
make laws for such State or any part thereof with respect to any of the matters
enumerated in List II in the Seventh Schedule (in this Constitution referred to as the
―State List").
(4) Parliament has power to make laws with respect to any matter for any part of the
territory of India not included 2 [in a State] notwithstanding that such matter is a
matter enumerated in the State List."
In view of the aforesaid provision under Article 246(2) notwithstanding anything in clauses (2) and
(3), Parliament and, subject to clause (1), the Legislature of any State also, have power to make laws
with respect to // 55 // any of the matters enumerated in List-III in the Seventh Schedule (in this
Constitution referred to as the "Concurrent List"). Entry-25 of Concurrent List-III is as follows:
"25. Education, including technical education, medical education and universities,
subject to the provisions of entries 63, 64, 65 and 66 of List I; vocational and
technical training of labour."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148064781/ 29
School Managing Committee Of vs State Of Odisha & Others ..... Opp. ... on 4 May, 2021
A perusal of the above Entry-25 makes it clear that "education" is a subject, for which both
Parliament and Legislature of any State have got power to make laws.
18. Now coming to the question as to what constitute an "education", in Barry v. Hughes, (1973) 1 All
ER 537, it has been held that education denotes training of the mind, in contradiction to training in
manual skills.
In Padmanav Dehury v. State of Orissa, AIR 1999 Ori 97, it has been held that the word "education"
is derived from the Latin word 'educa' which means brining out a latent faculties. "Education"
means // 56 // the act of process of imparting or acquiring general knowledge, developing the
powers of reasoning and judgment, and generally of preparing oneself or others intellectually or
mature life; the act or process of imparting or acquiring particular knowledge or skills. It is the
result produced by instruction, training or study. Thus the word has very wide import.
In P.A. Inamdar v. State of Maharastra, (2005) 6 SCC 537, the apex Court in paragraph-83 held as
under:-
"Act or process of providing with knowledge. The sense in which the word
"education" has been used is the systematic instruction, schooling or training given to
the young in preparation for the work of life. It also connotes the whole course of
scholastic instruction which a person has received. What education connotes in that
clause is the process of training and developing the knowledge, skill, mind and
character of students by formal schooling."
The same view has also been taken in Loka Shikshana Trust v. I.T. Commissioner, Mysore, AIR 1976
SC 10 : (1976) 1 SCC 254 and Gujarat University v. Shri Kirshna Ranganath Madholkar, AIR 1963
SCC 703.
// 57 // In P.A. Inamdar mentioned supra, the apex Court considering the India-Vision 2020, held
that "education" is an important input both for the growth of the society as well as for the individual.
Properly planned educational input can contribute to increase in the gross national products,
cultural richness, build positive attitude towards technology and increase efficiency and
effectiveness of the governance. Education opens new horizons for an individual, provides news
aspirations and develops new values. It strengthens competencies and develops commitment.
Education generates in an individual a critical outlook on social and political realities and sharpens
the ability to self-examination, self-monitoring and self-criticism.
In T.M.A. Pai Foundation v. State of Karnataka, (2002) 8 SCC 481, the apex Court held that
expression "education" occurring in various Articles of the Constitution of India means and includes
education at all levels, from the primary school level up to the postgraduate level and professional
education.
// 58 // In Avinash Mehrotra v. Union of India, (2009) 6 SCC 398, the apex Court held that
"education" today remains liberation- a tool for the betterment of our civil institutions, the

protection of civil liberties, and the path to an informed an questioning citizenry. Education is of
transcendental importance in the lives of individuals and in the very survival of our Constitution and
Republic.
19. Right to education includes right to safe education. Education is the brining up; the process of
developing and training the powers and capabilities of human beings. In its broadest sense the word
comprehends not merely the instruction received at school, or college but the whole course of
training moral, intellectual and physical; is not limited to the ordinary instruction of the child in the
pursuits of literature. It also comprehends a proper attention to the moral and religious sentiments
of the child. And it is sometimes used as synonymous with "learning".
// 59 //
20. Parliament has enacted a law, called "The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education
Act, 2009, (Act No. 35 of 2009)", which has got assent of the President on 28.08.2009 and
published in G.O.I. Ext. Part-II, Sec.1 dated 27.08.2009 and came into force on 01.04.2010. The
statement of objects and reasons of enacting such Act, as has been elaborately mentioned therein, is
reduced hereunder:-
"The crucial role of universal elementary education for strengthening the social fabric
of democracy through provision of equal opportunities to all has been accepted since
inception of our Republic. The Directive Principles of State Policy enumerated in our
constitution lays down that the State shall provide free and compulsory education to
all children up to the age of fourteen years. Over the years there has been significant
spatial and numerical expansion of elementary schools in the country, yet the goal of
universal elementary education continues to elude us. The number of children,
particularly children from disadvantaged groups and weaker sections, who drop out
of school before completing elementary education, remains very large. Moreover, the
quality of learning achievement is not always entirely satisfactory even in the case of
children who complete elementary education.
2. Article 21-A, as inserted by the Constitution (Eighty-sixth Amendment) Act, 2002,
provides for free and compulsory education of all children in the age group of six to
fourteen years as a Fundamental Right in such manner as the State may, by law,
determine.
3. Consequently, the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Bill, 2008,
is proposed to be enacted which seeks to provide,-
// 60 //
(a) 'compulsory education' casts an obligation on the appropriate Government to
provide and ensure admission, attendance and completion of elementary education.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148064781/ 31
School Managing Committee Of vs State Of Odisha & Others ..... Opp. ... on 4 May, 2021
(b) 'Free education' means that no child, other than a child who has been admitted by
his or her parents to a school which is not supported by the appropriate Government,
shall be liable to pay any kind of free or charges or expenses which may prevent him
or her from pursuing and completing elementary education;
(c) the duties and responsibilities of the appropriate Governments, local authorities,
parents, schools and teachers in providing free and compulsory education; and
(d) a system for protection of the right of children and a decentralized grievance
redressal mechanism.
4. The proposal legislation is anchored in the belief that the values of equality, social
justice and democracy and the creation of a just and humane society can be achieved
only through provision of inclusive elementary education to all. Provision of free and
compulsory education of satisfactory quality to children from disadvantaged and
weaker sections is, therefore, not merely the responsibilities of schools run or
supported by the appropriate Governments, but also of schools which are not
dependent on Government funds.
5. It is, therefore, expedient and necessary to enact a suitable legislation as envisaged
in Art. 21-A of the Constitution.
6. The Bill seeks to achieve this objective."
21. In Sanghvi Jeevraj Ghewar Chand v. Secretary, Madras Chillies, Grains and Kirana Merchants
Workers Union, AIR 1969 SC 530, the apex Court held that reference to the Statement of Objects
and Reasons is permissible for understanding the // 61 // background, the antecedent state of
affairs, the surrounding circumstances in relation to the statute, and the evil which the statute was
sought to remedy.
Similar view has also been taken in Secretary, Regional Transport Authority v. D.P. Sharma, AIR
1989 SC 509; Shashikant Laxman Kale v. Union of India, AIR 1990 SC 2114 and British Airway Plc.
V. Union of India, AIR 2002 SC 391.
22. In Bhaiji v. Sub-divisional Officer, Thandla, (2003) 1 SCC 692, summarizing the use of the
Statement of Objects and Reasons in the process of construction LAHOTI, J. said: "Reference to the
Statement of Objects and Reasons is permissible for understanding the background, the antecedent
state of affairs, the surrounding circumstances in relation to the statute and the evil which the
statute sought to remedy. The weight of judicial authority leans in favour of the view that the
Statement of Objects and Reasons cannot be utilized for the purpose of restricting and controlling
the plain meaning of the language employed by the // 62 // legislature in drafting a statute and
excluding from its operation such transactions which it plainly covers.

Women's Cooperative Finance Corporation Ltd, (2009) 8 SCC 431

24. In exercise of power conferred under Section 38 of Right of Children to Free & Compulsory
Education Act, 2009, the State Government has made a Rule called "The Odisha Right of Children
to Free and Compulsory Education Rules, 2010". The Rules-6 and 7 of the Rules, 2010, being
relevant for the purpose of the case, are extracted below:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148064781/ 36
School Managing Committee Of vs State Of Odisha & Others ..... Opp. ... on 4 May, 2021
"6. Areas or limits of neighborhood -(1) The areas or limits of neighborhood within
which a school would be established by the Government or Local Authority shall be
as under -
// 67 //
(a) In respect of children in classes I - V, a school shall be established within a
walking distance of one km of the neighborhood.
(b) In respect of children in classes VI - VIII, a school shall be established within a
walking distance of 3 km of the neighborhood.
(2) Wherever required, the Government shall upgrade existing schools with classes I -
V to include classes VI - VIII. In respect of schools which start from class VI onwards,
the Government shall endeavor to add classes I - V, if necessary.
(3) In places with difficult terrain, risk of landslides, floods, lack of roads and in
general, danger for young children in the approach from their homes to the school,
the State Government/Local Authority shall locate the school in such a manner as to
avoid such dangers, by reducing the limits specified under sub-rule (1).
(4) For children from small hamlets, as identified by the Government/Local
Authority, where no school exists within the area or limits of neighborhood specified
under sub-rule (1) the Government/Local Authority shall make adequate
arrangements for providing elementary education in a school, in relaxation of the
limits specified under sub-rule (1).
(5) In places with high population density, the Government/local authority may
consider establishment of more than one neighborhood school, having regard to the
number of children in the age group of 6-14 years in such areas.
(6) The Local Authority shall identify the neighborhood school(s) where children can
be admitted and make such information to public for each habitation in the Gram
Panchyat office notice board within its jurisdiction.
(7) In respect of children with disabilities which prevent them from accessing the
school the Government/Local Authority will endeavor to make appropriate and safe
arrangements for them to // 68 // attend school through Committee and complete
elementary education.
(8) The Government/Local Authority shall ensure that access of children to the
school is not hindered on account of social, legal and cultural factors.

School Managing Committee Of vs State Of Odisha & Others ..... Opp. ... on 4 May, 2021
7. Responsibility of Government and Local Authority -(1) xxxxxxxxxx (2) For the
purpose of determining and for establishing neighborhood schools, the
government/local authority shall undertake school mapping, and identify all
children, including children in remote areas, children with disabilities, children
belonging to disadvantaged groups, children belonging to weaker sections migrated
children and children referred to in section 4, within a period of one year from the
appointed date, and every year thereafter."
25. On perusal of aforementioned provisions, it is made clear that Act, 2009 has been framed under
Article 21-A of the Constitution of India, which inter alia provides for free and compulsory education
to all children in the age group of 6 to 14 years as a fundamental right. To enforce and implement
the objective of Article 21-A of the Constitution of India, Parliament has enacted Act, 2009. As per
Section 2 (f) of the Act, 2009, elementary education means the education from first class to eight
class. Section 3(1) of the Act, 2009 clearly provides that every child of the age // 69 // of six to
fourteen years, including a child referred to in clause-(d) or clause (e) of Section 2 shall have the
right to free and compulsory education in a neighbourhood school till the completion of his or her
elementary education. Section 6 of the Act, 2009 provides the duty of appropriate government and
local authority to establish school. As per section 6 of the Act, for carrying out the provisions of the
said act, the appropriate government and the local authority shall establish, within such area or
limits of neighbourhood, as may be prescribed, a school where it is not so established, within a
period of three years from the commencement of this Act. Section 7(1) of the Act, 2009 provides that
the central government and the State governments shall have concurrent responsibility for
providing funds for carrying out the provisions of the said Act. Section 8(b) of the Act, 2009
provides that the appropriate government shall ensure availability of a neighbourhood school as
specified in Section 6. Section 19 of the Act, 2009 provides the norms and standards for School.
Section // 70 // 19(1) of the Act, 2009 provides that no school shall be established for recognized
under section 18 unless it fulfills the norms and standards specified in the schedule. Section 38 of
the Act, 2009 provides the power of appropriate government to make rules in various matters
including the area or limits of a neighbourhood school under Section 6. The schedule appended to
the Act, 2009 so far as primary schools are concerned, i.e., for classes from I-V for admitted children
up to '60', two teachers are required and for classes VI-VIII at least one teacher each for science and
mathematics, social studies and languages.
26. Similarly, Rule-6 of Rules, 2010 provides establishment of neighbourhood school, i.e., in respect
of children in classes I-V within a walking distance of one km. of the neighbourhood. So far as
children having classes VI-VIII, a school shall be established within a walking distance of 3 kms. of
the neighbourhood. Rule- 6(3), (4), (5), (6), (7) and (8) of Rules, 2010 provides about the
contingencies in which the area or limits of the // 71 // neighbourhood school can be reduced.
Therefore, combined reading of Act, 2009 and Rules, 2010, no where there is any provision for
merger/consolidation of primary/upper primary schools with high schools. Therefore, the
notification no.5465 dated 11.03.2020 regarding consolidation of various types of schools including
high schools with classes VI to X, I-X or IX-X with primary and upper primary school, is contrary to
the provisions of the Act, 2009 and Rules, 2010, as the very definition of elementary education as
provided under Section 2 (f) of the Act, 2009 means the education from first class to eight class.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148064781/ 38
School Managing Committee Of vs State Of Odisha & Others ..... Opp. ... on 4 May, 2021
Therefore, the Government has issued the notification no.5465 dated 11.03.2020 without taking into
consideration the constitutional mandate as well as statutory provisions, namely, Act, 2009 and
Rules, 2010. Thereby, the same cannot sustain in the eye of law.
27. The table relating to distance and enrollment norms for consolidation in the notification no.5465
dated 11.03.2020 wherein secondary schools // 72 // beyond class-VIII have been given contrary to
the Act, 2009 and Rules, 2010. In the table, a primary school having roll strength less than 40 in
respect of non- scheduled area and less than 25 in respect of scheduled area can be consolidated, is
also contrary to the provisions of the Act, 2009, wherein it has been prescribed for classes having
I-V admitted children up to 60, two teachers are required. Therefore, when there is no minimum
roll strength prescribing for a primary school under the Act, 2009 and the Rules, 2010, the
notification no.5465 dated 11.03.2020 fixing the minimum roll strength prescribed as per the table
in respect of primary schools, i.e., less than 40 in respect of non-scheduled area and less than 25 in
respect of scheduled area is contrary to the statute and, as such, the same cannot sustain in the eye
of law.
28. In respect of the upper primary school the roll strength has been prescribed less than 50 in
respect of non-scheduled area and less than 40 in respect of scheduled area, is also contrary to the
// 73 // schedule appended to the Act, 2009, though while issuing the notification in the office note
deals with some factual matrix with regard to natural barriers, but the same has not taken up under
Rule-6 of Rules, 2010, which clearly provides that the area or limits of neighbourhood school can be
reduced.
29. As has been contended by Mr. S. Parida, learned Sr. Standing Counsel for the School and Mass
Education Department that government has introduced the policy of rationalization and
consolidation of schools by virtue of notification no.5465 dated 11.03.2020 under Annexure-3 to
W.P.(C) No.27401 of 2020 with following objectives:-
"i) To reduce the number of educationally and economically sub-optimal school.
ii) To rationalize and consolidate existing schools to reduce the category of schools
thus fix the range category to only four, i.e., I-V, I-VIII, I-X and VI-X.
iii) To create as many integrated secondary schools as possible hence provide
education up to high school level in one single campus, improving transition.
iv) To consolidate stand alone upper primary and secondary schools."
// 74 // It is contended that the same cannot contrary to the Act, 2009 and Rules, 2010. But, when
the government notification no.5465 dated 11.03.2020 itself runs contrary to Article 21-A of the
Constitution and provisions of Act, 2009 and Rules, 2010, the mechanism provided for
consolidation/merger of various category of school is not acceptable. Besides that, when the very
purport of the Act, 2009 and Rules, 2010 is to provide at least one school within a walking distance
of one km. of the neighbourhood, in that case, the State Government cannot and could not take
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148064781/ 39
School Managing Committee Of vs State Of Odisha & Others ..... Opp. ... on 4 May, 2021
steps for abolition of schools which are already there and catering to the needs of the local people.
Therefore, in the guise of merger/consolidation of the schools, the very purpose of the Act, 2009 and
Rules, 2010 has been frustrated. Thereby, the impugned notifications cannot sustain in the eye of
law.
30. By virtue of the notification no.5465 dated 11.03.2020, an alternative Grievance Redressal Cell
has been created, which can examine the specific // 75 // grievance of any party during post
consolidation period, is of no use as once consolidation/merger is made any sort of grievance
redressal by the alternative forum may lead to an empty formality as the Grievance Redressal Cell is
created by the Government itself and the government officers are the members of the said cell.
Besides that, such Grievance Redressal Cell in the district office or anywhere is being contrary to the
Act, 2009 and Rules, 2010. Thereby, the same is of no use.
31. Law is well settled by catena of decisions of the apex Court as well as this Court that no man
should be a Judge of his own cause, which is violative of principles of natural justice. Meaning
thereby, having a Grievance Redressal Cell with some government officers, the petitioners will not
get justice. Thereby, it is only an empty formality and an eye wash for implementation of the
notifications, as referred to above order, and as such, the same is contrary to the provisions of law.
Thereby, the impugned notifications issued by the government cannot sustain in the eye of law.
// 76 //
32. Coming to the petitioner's school in W.P.(C) No.27401 of 2020, no doubt the student strength of
the petitioner's school was 33 for the academic session 2019-20, as the petitioner's school was not
given permission for admission of students in respect of Class- I during the session 2020-21. Had
the permission been given to the petitioner's school to admit students in Class-I, then the students
strength of the school would have been beyond 40, as nine guardians of the village were interested
to admit their wards in class-I of the said school. With regard to distance between Amaramunda
Government Primary school and Laxmanpali Project Upper Primary school, the same is more than 1
km., i.e., 2.9 kms, which is evident from google map. But in the counter affidavit, the distance
between the Amaramunda Government Primary school to Laxmanpali Project Upper Primary
school has been shown as 800 meters. The same is beyond the actual fact and record available. The
joint inquiry report, which has been placed under Annexure- B/1 to the counter affidavit, cannot be
relied upon as the // 77 // distance between two schools is 2.9 kms. The further contention made in
the counter affidavit that there is no natural barriers like ponds, rivers, deep forest and traffic
congestion between the lead school and the satellite school is also not correct, as there is reserve
forest between the road leading from Amaramunda to Laxmanplai and wild elephants are crossing
the road frequently which has come out in various newspapers stating that village Amaramunda is
adjacent to Cheliapat reserve forest. Therefore, at the caprice and whims of the authority, merger of
schools have been made, which is a disadvantage to the local people and also contrary to the
constitutional mandate as well as the provisions of the Act, 2009 and Rules, 2010. Thereby, the
impugned notification no.5465 dated 11.03.2020 and consequential notification no.5538 dated
11.03.2020, i.e., guidelines for implementation of policy for rationalization and consolidation of
schools, and also corrigendum issued on 14.12.2020, cannot sustain in the eye of law.

// 78 //
33. No doubt, the general principles of policy decision are within the complete domain of the
Government. Necessarily the Government shall exercise its own discretion in this regard. But, it is a
fundamental rule for the exercise of the discretionary power that discretion must brought to bear on
every case-each one must be considered on its own merits and decided as the public interest
requires at the time.
34. In State of Gujarat v. Arvind Kumar Tewari, (2012) 9 SCC545, the apex Court held that policy
decision cannot ordinarily be subject-matter of judicial review.
The same view has also been taken by the apex Court in State v. Naveena, (2009) 3 SCC 649 and
Dilip Kumar v. State, (2009) 5 SCC 1.
35. The scope of judicial review of governmental policy is now well defined. Courts do not and
cannot act as appellate authorities examining the correctness, suitability and appropriateness of a
policy, // 79 // nor are courts advisors to the executive on matters of policy which the executive is
entitled to formulate.
36. In Directorate of Film Festivals v. Gaurav Ashwin Jain, (2007) 4 SCC 737, the apex Court held
that the scope of judicial review when examining a policy of the Government is to check whether it
violates the fundamental rights of the citizens or is opposed to the provisions of the Constitution, or
opposed to any statutory provision or manifestly arbitrary. Courts cannot interfere with policy either
on the ground that it is erroneous or on the ground that a better, fairer or wiser alternative is
available. Legality of the policy, and not the wisdom or soundness of the policy, is the subject of
judicial review. The judicial review, as the words imply, is not an appeal from a decision, but a
review of the manner in which the decision was made. Meaning thereby, judicial review is
concerned, not with the decision, but with the decision-making process.
37. In Tamil Nadu Education Department Ministerial and General Subordinate Services // 80 //
Association mentioned supra, on which reliance has been placed by Mr. S. Parida, learned Sr.
Standing Counsel appearing for the School and Mass Education Department, in paragraph-16 of the
judgment, the apex Court held that Court cannot strike down a G.O., or a policy merely because
there is a variation or contradiction. Life is sometimes contradiction and even consistency is not
always a virtue. What is important is to know whether mala fides vitiates or irrational and
extraneous factor fouls.
38. In Ram Lubhaya Bagga mentioned supra, the apex Court in paragraph-25 held that when
government forms its policy, it is based on a number of circumstances on facts, law including
constraints based on its recourses. It is also based on expert opinion. It would be dangerous if court
is asked to test the utility, beneficial effect of the policy or its appraisal based on facts set out on
affidavits. The court would dissuade itself from entering into this realm which belongs to the
executive.

// 81 //
39. In Balco Employees' Union mentioned supra, the apex Court held that the decision to disinvest
and the implementation thereof is purely an administrative decision relating to the economic policy
of the State and challenge to the same at the instance of a busy body cannot fall within the
parameters of public interest litigation.
40. In Directorate of Film Festivals mentioned supra, the apex Court held that the scope of judicial
review of governmental policy is now well defined. Courts do not and cannot act as Appellate
Authorities examining the correctness, suitability and appropriateness of a policy, nor are courts
advisors to the executive on matters of policy which the executive is entitled to formulate. The scope
of judicial review when examining a policy of the Government is to check whether it violates the
fundamental rights of the citizens or is opposed to the provisions of the Constitution, or opposed to
any statutory provision or manifestly arbitrary. Courts cannot interfere with policy either on // 82 //
the ground that it is erroneous or on the ground that a better, fairer or wiser alternative is available.
Legality of the policy, and not the wisdom or soundness of the policy, is the subject of judicial
review.
41. This Court is conscious of its jurisdiction which has been laid down by the apex Court in the
above decisions. But applying the same to the present case, as has been held that scope of judicial
review in examining the policy of the government is to check whether it violates the fundamental
rights of the citizens or is opposed to the provisions of the Constitution, or opposed to any statutory
provision or manifestly arbitrary, in that case, the Court may have jurisdiction to entertain the writ
petitions by scrutinizing the so called policy with the above realm.
42. On perusal of the relevant note-sheets, referred to above, it reveals that while taking a decision,
the authorities have not taken note of the provisions contained in Act, 2009 and Rules, 2010, as
discussed above. Therefore, this Court has jurisdiction to interfere // 83 // with the decision making
process, as has been held by the apex Court in catena of decisions. If in the decision making process
there is non-compliance of the statutory provisions, then ultimate decision suffers from illegality
and irregularity, with which the Court can interfere. In view of such power, this Court examined the
government notification and consequential office memorandum dated 11.03.2020 and found that
both are violative of statutory provisions governing the field.
43. Now, examining the question with regard to the jurisdiction of the Court to have a judicial
review in a policy decision of the authority, it is well explained by the apex Court in Delhi
Development Authority v. Joint Action Committee, (2008) 2 SCC 672 that a policy decision is
subject to judicial review on the following grounds:
(a) if it is unconstitutional;
(b) if it is dehors the provisions of the Act and the regulations;
(c) if the delegate has acted beyond its power of delegations;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148064781/ 42

(d) if the executive policy is contrary to the statutory or a larger policy.
// 84 //
44. In Laxman Dundappa Dhamanekar (supra), the apex Court in paragraph-9 of the judgment held
as follows:
"9. We noticed earlier, the appointment and conditions of service of teachers in
private government-aided institutions are governed by the provisions of the Act and
the statutory Rules. The said provisions are a self-contained code relating to the
appointments of teachers in private-aided institutions. The field relating to method of
appointment of regular teachers in a government- aided institution is fully covered by
the provisions of the Act and the Rules and we do not find any provisions in the Act
empowering the Government to supplement the Rules by executive instructions. It is
no doubt true that if the Act had empowered the State Government to issue
administrative instructions by way of supplementing the Rules, the position would be
different. In such a case, the Government would have power to fill up the gaps in the
Rules by issuing administrative instructions if the Rules are silent on the subject
provided the same is not inconsistent with the statutory Rules already framed. In the
present case, the Act does not empower the State Government to supplement the
Rules by issuing administrative instructions or orders. In the absence of such
provision in the Act, it is not open to the Government to supplement the Rules by
executive orders. If we accept the argument of learned counsel for the respondent, it
would be repugnant to Sections 3 and 15 of the Act."
45. In Punjab Water Supply and Sewerage Board (supra), in paragraphs- 10 and 14 of the judgment,
the apex Court held as follows:
// 85 //
10. A statutory board is an autonomous body.
Nothing has been brought to our notice to show that under the statute any direction issued by the
State shall be binding on it. The State may have some control with regard to recruitment of
employees of local authorities, but such control must be exercised by the State strictly in terms of
the provisions of the Act. The statutory bodies are bound to apply the rules of recruitment laid down
under the statutory rules. They being "State" within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of
India, are bound to implement the constitutional scheme of equality. Neither can the statutory
bodies refuse to fulfil such constitutional duty, nor can the State issue any direction contrary to or
inconsistent with the constitutional principles adumbrated under Articles 14 and 16 of the
Constitution of India. The purported directions of the State were otherwise bad in law insofar as
thereby the statutory rules were sought to be superseded. A circular letter furthermore is not a
statutory instrument. It was not even issued by the State in exercise of the power under Article 162
of the Constitution of India. Even a scheme issued under Article 162 of the Constitution of India,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148064781/ 43
School Managing Committee Of vs State Of Odisha & Others ..... Opp. ... on 4 May, 2021
would not prevail over statutory rules.
xxx xxx xxx
14. Once it is held that the terms and conditions of service including the recruitment of employees
were to be governed either by the statutory rules or rules framed under the proviso to Article 309 of
the Constitution of India, it must necessarily be held that any policy decision adopted by the State in
exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 162 of the Constitution of India would be illegal and without
jurisdiction. In A. Umarani v. Registrar, Coop. Societies [(2004) 7 SCC 112 : 2004 SCC (L&S) 918] a
three-Judge Bench of this Court has opined: (SCC p. 126, para 45) "45. No regularisation is, thus,
permissible in exercise of the statutory power conferred under Article 162 of the Constitution if the
appointments have been made in contravention of the statutory rules."
// 86 // It was further held: (SCC pp. 126-27, para 49) "49. It is trite that appointments cannot be
made on political considerations and in violation of the government directions for reduction of
establishment expenditure or a prohibition on the filling up of vacant posts or creating new posts
including regularisation of daily-waged employees. (See Municipal Corpn., Bilaspur v. Veer Singh
Rajput [(1998) 9 SCC 258 : 1998 SCC (L&S) 1178] .)"
46. In Mahadeo Bhau Khilare (Mane) (supra), the apex Court in paragraphs 7 and 10
of the judgment held as follows :
"7. Indisputably, the State of Maharashtra has framed recruitment rules. Any scheme
by way of an executive instruction in terms of Article 162 of the Constitution of India,
if violative of such statutory rules would not be legally sustainable. (See A. Umarani v.
Registrar, Coop. Societies [(2004) 7 SCC 112 : 2004 SCC (L&S) 918].
xxx xxx xxx
10. In terms of the said scheme, Stenotypists, Typists of the IIIrd grade or similar
posts of the Revenue Department could be absorbed in the State service. We would
assume that the said scheme was valid in law, although it was not in view of the
decision of this Court in Umarani [(2004) 7 SCC 112 : 2004 SCC (L&S) 918] . The
appellants were appointed by Talathis as their assistants. They only used to assist the
Talathis in their day-to-day work. They were never appointed as Talathis. No such
post of Assistant to Talathis had been created and/or sanctioned by any competent
authority. No recruitment rule therefor was framed. Therefore, their appointments
were illegal. The State had also imposed a ban on appointment of such persons. In
any event, they were appointed by the employees themselves to // 87 // help them
and not by any authority having the requisite jurisdiction therefor."
47. In Avinash Mehrotra (supra), the apex Court in paragraphs 46 and 47 of the judgment held as
follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148064781/ 44
School Managing Committee Of vs State Of Odisha & Others ..... Opp. ... on 4 May, 2021
"46. It is the fundamental right of each and every child to receive education free from
fear of security and safety. The children cannot be compelled to receive education
from an unsound and unsafe building.
47. In view of what happened in Lord Krishna Middle School in District
Kumbakonam where 93 children were burnt alive and several similar incidences had
happened in the past, therefore, it has become imperative to direct that safety
measures as prescribed by the National Building Code of India, 2005 be implemented
by all government and private schools functioning in our country. We direct that:
(i) Before granting recognition or affiliation, the State Governments and Union
Territories concerned are directed to ensure that the buildings are safe and secure
from every angle and they are constructed according to the safety norms incorporated
in the National Building Code of India.
(ii) All existing government and private schools shall install fire extinguishing
equipments within a period of six months.
(iii) The school buildings be kept free from inflammable and toxic material. If storage
is inevitable, they should be stored safely.
(iv) Evaluation of structural aspect of the school may be carried out periodically. We
direct that the engineers and officials concerned must strictly follow the National
Building Code. The safety certificate be issued only after proper inspection.
Dereliction in duty must attract immediate disciplinary action against the officials
concerned.
// 88 //
(v) Necessary training be imparted to the staff and other officials of the school to use the fire
extinguishing equipments."
48. In Society for unaided private schools of Rajasthan (supra), in paragraph-45 of the judgment the
apex Court held as follows:
"45. At the outset, we may reiterate that Article 21-A of the Constitution provides that
the State shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of the specified
age in such manner as the State may, by law, determine. Thus, the primary obligation
to provide free and compulsory education to all children of the specified age is on the
State. However, the manner in which this obligation will be discharged by the State
has been left to the State to determine by law. The State may do so through its own
schools or through aided schools or through private schools, so long as the law made
in this regard does not transgress any other constitutional limitation. This is because
Article 21-A vests the power in the State to decide the manner in which it will provide
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148064781/ 45
School Managing Committee Of vs State Of Odisha & Others ..... Opp. ... on 4 May, 2021
free and compulsory education to the specified category of children. As stated, the
2009 Act has been enacted pursuant to Article 21-A."
49. In Vinod Kumar Koul vrs. State of Jammu and Kashmir (supra) the apex Court in para-9 of the
judgment held as follows:
"9. In our view, the administrative decision of the Board, which is ex facie
inconsistent with the plain language of Rule 13(i), could not have been relied upon for
determining the eligibility of the appellant for appointment as the Laboratory
Assistant in District Udhampur and the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench
of the High Court // 89 // committed serious error by negating the appellant's
challenge to the decision of the Selection Committee not to consider his candidature
and that too by overlooking the fact that at the time of submission of application, the
appellant was residing in District Udhampur, which is an integral part of the State of
Jammu and Kashmir."
50. In Devi Multiplex (supra), the apex Court in paragraph 23 of the judgment held as follows:
"23. Furthermore, the Scheme as framed on 20-12- 1995 formed the basis of a
statutory notification under Section 29 of Act 16 of 1977 and as such the core
components of the Scheme had acquired a statutory status. By virtue of said Section
29, the Notification dated 14-2-1997 was required to be laid for not less than 30 days
before the State Legislature. If the State Government was desirous of amending,
varying or rescinding said Notification dated 14-2-1997, the subsequent GR dated
28-6- 2000 ought to have been translated into a statutory notification under Section
29 of the Act 16 of 1977. In the absence of such steps having been undertaken, the GR
dated 28-6-2000 could not in any way detract from or dilute the effect of the Scheme
which had acquired statutory status."
51. In Lok Prahari (supra), the apex Court in paragraph-43 and 44 of the judgment held as follows:
"43. The 1997 Rules are not statutory rules. They are in the nature of administrative
or executive instructions. They would not stand the test of legality if they are not in
consonance with statutory provisions. The said Rules are definitely in contravention
of the statutory provisions and therefore, the said Rules can be said to be bad in law
so far as they are in contravention of the statutory provisions.
// 90 //
44. There cannot be any dispute that when the rules and regulations or executive
instructions are contrary to any statutory provision, the statutory provision would
prevail and the rules or executive instructions, so far as they are contrary to the
statutory provisions, would fail."

52. In Krishna Murari Lal Asthana (supra), the apex Court in paragraph-15 of the judgment held as
follows :-
"15. On scanning of anatomy of Rule 55 of the 1995 Rules, we are absolutely clear that
it does not confer power on the Chairman of the Corporation to issue any instructions
that can travel beyond the Rules. In terms of Rule 55, he has been authorised to issue
instructions which are necessary and expedient for the implementation of the Rules.
The Board had passed the resolution. The Board can pass a resolution and the
Chairman can be the head of the Board, but it does not authorise the Board to take a
decision with regard to certain matters which are within the domain of the rule-
making authority. On a perusal of Section 48, it is clear as crystal that conferment of
benefit, either pension or anything ancillary thereto has to be conferred by the Rules
and the rule as prescribed under Section 48 of the Act is to be tabled before
Parliament. In the absence of a rule, in our considered opinion, no benefit can be
granted on the basis of the resolution passed by the Corporation. This being the legal
position, the High Court could not have held to the contrary on the basis of the
concession given by the counsel for the Union of India."
53. In Employees' State Insurance Corporation (supra), the apex Court in paragraph-16 of the
judgment held as follows:-
// 91 // "16. In our considered opinion, the High Court has ignored to appreciate that
the effect of the ESI Act enacted by Parliament cannot be circumvented by the
department office memorandum. The High Court has also failed to appreciate that
the payment of interim relief/wages emanates from the provisions contained in terms
of the settlement, which forms part of the contract of employment and forms the
ingredients of "wages" as defined under Section 2(22) of the ESI Act and that the
respondent paid interim relief, as per a scheme voluntarily promulgated by it as per
the Notification dated 20-
4-1996, issued by the Government of India, in view of the recommendations of "Manisana Wage
Board", pending revision of rates of wages. It was not an ex gratia payment. In this context, it is
beneficial to note the observations of this Court in ESI Corpn. v. Gnanambigai Mills Ltd. [ESI
Corpn. v. Gnanambigai Mills Ltd., (2005) 6 SCC 67 :
2005 SCC (L&S) 800] , which read thus: (SCC p. 70, para 6) "6. In our view the High
Court has gone completely wrong in concluding that by virtue of the award it ceases
to be wages. As stated above, the Tribunal has not applied its mind as to whether or
not the payments were wages. All that the Tribunal did was to give its imprimatur to
a compromise between the parties. Merely because the parties in their compromise
chose to term the payments as "ex gratia payments" does not mean that those
payments cease to be wages if they were otherwise wages. As stated above, they were
wages at the time that they were paid. They did not cease to be wages after the award
merely because the terms of compromise termed them as "ex gratia payments". We
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148064781/ 47
School Managing Committee Of vs State Of Odisha & Others ..... Opp. ... on 4 May, 2021
are therefore unable to accept the reasoning of the judgments of the High Court. The
judgment of the Division Bench as well as that of the Single Judge accordingly stand
set aside. It is held that the amounts paid are wages and contribution will have to be
made on those amounts also. We, however, make it clear that payments of the
interest will be as per the statutory provisions."
// 92 //
54. In Santosh Kumar Sahu (supra), this Court in paragraphs 20, 21, 22 and 24 of the judgment held
as follows:-
"20. A Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court, in B.N. Nagarajan 85 Ors. Vs. State
of Mysore 81. ors., AIR 1966 SC 1942, has observed as under-
"It is hardly necessary to mention that if there is a statutory rule or an Act on the
matter, the executive must abide by that Act or Rule and it cannot in exercise of its
executive powers under Article 162 of the Constitution ignore or act contrary to that
rule or the Act. "
21. Similarly, another Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in Sant Ram Sharma Vs. State of
Rajasthan 85 Ors., AIR 1967 SC 1910, has observed as under:-
"It is true that the Government cannot amend or supersede statutory Rules by
administrative instruction, but if the Rules are silent on any particular point, the
Government can fill-up the gap and supplement the rule and issue instructions not
inconsistent with the Rules already framed."
22. The law laid down above, has consistently been followed and it is settled proposition of law that
an Authority cannot issue orders/office memorandum/executive instructions in contravention of
the statutory Rules. However, instructions can be issued only to supplement the statutory rules but
not to supplant it. Such instructions should be subservient to the statutory provisions. (Vide The
Commissioner of Income--tax, Gujarat Vs. M / s. A. Raman 85 Co., AIR 1968 SC 49; Union of India
85 ors. Vs. Majji Jangammayya 85 ors., AIR 1977 SC 757; The District Registrar, Palghat 85 ors. Vs.
M.B. Koyyakutty 85 ors., AIR 1979 SC 1060; Ramendra Singh 85 ors. Vs. Jagdish Prasad 85 ors.,
AIR 1984 SC 885; P.D. // 93 // Aggarvval 85 Ors. Vs. State of U.P. 85 Ors., AIR 1987 SC 1676; M/s.
Beopar Sahayak (P) Ltd. 85 Ors. Vs. Vishwa Nath 85 Ors.,AIR 1987 SC 2111; Paluru Ramkrishnaiah
85 Ors. Vs. Union of India 85 Anr., AIR 1990 SC 166; Comptroller 85 Auditor General of India 85
ors. Vs. Mohan Lal Mehrotra 85 ors., AIR 1991 SC 2288; and C. Rangaswamaiah 85 Ors. Vs.
Karnataka Lokayukta 85 Ors., AIR 1998 SC 2496).
Xx xx xx
24. Thus, it is settled law that executive instructions cannot amend or supersede the statutory rules
or add something therein. The orders cannot be issued in contravention of the statutory rules for the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148064781/ 48
School Managing Committee Of vs State Of Odisha & Others ..... Opp. ... on 4 May, 2021
reason that an administrative instruction is not a statutory rule nor does it have any force of law;
while statutory Rules have full force of law as held by the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court
in State of U.P. 85 ors. Vs. Babu Ram Upadhya, AIR 1961 SC 751; and State of Tamil Nadu Vs. M/s.
Hind Stone etc. etc., AIR 1981 SC 711."
55. The question of merger of school had come up for consideration before the Rajasthan High
Court in Jule Khan Bai mentioned supra, wherein the learned Single Judge has quashed the
impugned order issued by the Joint Secretary, Elementary Education, Government of Rajasthan,
directing merger of the Government Primary School, Rikhiyani in government Upper Primary
School, Sagoroliya and also directed the opposite parties to restore the Government Primary School,
Rikhiyani and ensure that the children of the age // 94 // of 6 to 14 years of village Rikhiyani are
imparted free education up to class VIII, as mandated by the provisions of RTE Act.
56. Similarly, a Division Bench of Uttarakhand High Court in Ganesh Chandra Upadhyay mentioned
supra, while hearing the writ petition, passed status quo order with regard to shifting of school from
the existing locality to another until further orders.
57. In view of the settled position of law, as discussed above, it is made clear that the Court can
exercise its power of judicial review, if the notification issued is unconstitutional and de hors the
provisions of rules and regulations and more so the executive policy is contrary to the constitutional
mandate and statutory rules.
58. Applying the said principles, children in elementary schools should be our first concern. The rise
in the literacy rates in various States over the years is // 95 // primarily due to better inputs in
(formal) primary education.
59. When then base is weak, everything remains weak in later years. In half-hearted primary
education, all efforts to reform secondary or higher education will prove to be futile exercise.
60. Unfortunately the authorities of the system do not seem to realize this natural phenomenon,
because, they themselves have no stakes in this system; they follow for their wards the "other"
system of public and model schools which often has a sound basis. However, for the general run of
the people, the only resort is the prevalent system run by different authorities, who swim or sink in
it.
61. Elementary education obviously requires maximum attention in respect of academic,
administrative and financial inputs. Many academic and administrative measures are equally
important- as the purpose is not only to have funds but also to spend them most honestly and
gainfully. This calls for wholesale // 96 // decentralization of powers and active involvement of local
communities and panchayats.
62. With the avowed objectives of giving education to the children of the locality, lands had been
donated by the then generous people for establishment of the schools and, as such, the schools were
named after them and many of the schools have been established more than 10 years above and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148064781/ 49
School Managing Committee Of vs State Of Odisha & Others ..... Opp. ... on 4 May, 2021
many students have come out from said institutions having elementary education. In such
circumstances, directing merger of schools and consequential closure of institutions having all
infrastructure, cannot be considered to be a sound approach by the authority in issuing the
notification no.5465 dated 11.03.2020 and consequential guidelines issued vide office memorandum
no.5538 dated 11.03.2020 and corrigendum issued on 14.12.2020.
63. As the number of primary schools is very large, formal and regular inspections are not possible.
There are hundreds, if not thousands, of primary schools, which were never inspected by the
department // 97 // officers. And quite often, inspections comprise only a fleeting glance.
64. Instead of finding the reasons for decreasing roll strength merger of school will not serve the
purpose. It is just like without finding the cause of disease treatment has been started. There are
enumerable reasons for decreasing of roll strength, instead of eradicating the ground difficulties
merger is taken place due to decision is taken place at higher level without realizing the ground level
reality.
65. As it appears, in the State of Odisha, many categories of teachers exist - confirmed teachers,
unconfirmed teachers, ad hoc teachers, tenure teachers, teachers on contractual basis, volunteer
teachers, and so on. No other kind of employees or workers has such divisions. This clearly indicates
the extent of regard the planners and policy- makers have for education. So the teaching profession
is to be taken as a full-time job.
// 98 //
66. Earlier, ET and CT training teachers with less qualification were being appointed and they had
got their institutional commitment. But, now appointments are being made to different categories of
teachers with multifarious activities and utilizing them with a paltry sum of money. With a half fed
belly, they are directed to discharge their duties. Consequentially, the objectives are not being
achieved. This may be one of the reasons for reduction of roll strength of a particular school. But this
can be eradicated in effective manner, if the authorities, who are in the helm of affairs, are little
vigilant.
67. Now, the authorities are shedding crocodile tears to have a primary education in mother tongue,
but they are granting permission in free hands for establishment and recognition of institutions in
other medium, which may be a reason for reduction of students' strength in the existing schools. As
it appears, Govt. of Delhi has taken drastic steps for upliftment of government primary schools in
Delhi Union Territory and // 99 // that is the best example for other States to follow, so as to keep
elementary education accessible to each child having the minimum infrastructure available in the
locality.
68. Students in neglected rural far-flung region need special dispensation, additional dose of
teaching and other activities. If Government accommodation for teaching is provided and a rational
transfer policy is formulated and strictly adhered to, many problems of teachers posted in difficult
rural regions will be resolved to a great extent.

69. Kendriya Vidyalayas and other institutions affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary
Education (CBSE), primary school teachers are invariably trained graduates. It is difficult for matric
or Plus-Two pass educators to teach modern, updated syllabi and texts at the primary stage -
particularly the CBSE syllabi, NCERT books designed with trained graduates as elementary teachers
in view.
// 100 //
70. But educational administration at all levels, as suggested by numerous commissions and
committees on education, should be the exclusive prerogative and domain of experts, educationists
and educators. Also, education at the elementary school level should be accorded a top-priority,
acute and persistent financial crunch notwithstanding.
71. Article 21-A of the Constitution of India and its consequent legislation, the Right to Children to
Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 became operative in the country in 2010. The RTE
Act confers the right to elementary education on all children, in the age group 6-14 years, on the
basis of equality of opportunity in a formal school which satisfies certain essential norms and
standards. All States and UTs have notified their State RTE Rules. The centrally sponsored scheme
of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) supports States and UTs in their efforts to implement the RTE Act.
Its interventions include, inter alia, opening of new schools, construction of schools and additional
classrooms, // 101 // constructing toilets and drinking water facilities, provisioning for teachers,
in-service training for teachers and academic resource support, free textbooks and uniforms,
support for improving learning achievement levels, research, evaluation and monitoring.
72. Universalisation of primary education under the RTE Act paved the way for making education
accessible to all. The status of access to education in Odisha can be assessed through different
indicators such as enrolment ratio, pupil teacher ratio, drop-out rate, transition rate, buildings and
infrastructure, in both primary and upper primary (together termed as 'elementary') and secondary
schools.
73. Keeping the above factual and legal aspects in mind, this Court, in exercise of power under
judicial review, is of the considered view that the notification no.5465 dated 11.03.2020 under
Annexure-3 to W.P.(C) No.27401 of 2020 and subsequent office memorandum no.5538 dated
11.03.2020 for implementation of guidelines for policy of rationalization // 102 // and consolidation
of schools, and also the corrigendum issued on 14.12.2020 under Annexure-A/1 series to above
mentioned writ petition, cannot sustain in the eye of law and the same are liable to be quashed and
are hereby quashed. The opposite parties are directed to restore back the position of the schools in
question, as before, and provide necessary infrastructure for smooth running of the same.
74. In the result, the writ petitions are allowed. However, there shall be no order as to costs.
