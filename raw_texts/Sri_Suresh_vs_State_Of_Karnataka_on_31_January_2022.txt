THESE WRIT PETITIONS COMING ON FOR PRELIMINARY
HEARING THROUGH VIDEO CONFERENCE THIS DAY, THE COURT
MADE THE FOLLOWING:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/14112163/ 38
Sri.Suresh vs State Of Karnataka on 31 January, 2022
ORDER
In all these petitions, the short grievance of the citizen litigants who belong to the oppressed classes
is as to non- implementation of the Parliamentary Legislation, i.e., The Prohibition of Employment
as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013. Learned counsel for the petitioners heavily
banks upon the decision of Hon'ble Apex Court in SAFAI KARMACHARI ANDOLAN AND OTHERS
Vs. UNION OF INDIA AND OTHERS reported in 2014 (11) SCC 224, in support of his contention.
2. Learned Additional Government Advocate appearing for the 1st respondent-State opposes the
petitions contending that from the side of his clients, everything has been done for the
implementation of the scheme enacted in the Socio-Welfare Legislation is question and that if there
is any lapse, it lies at the door steps of the implementing authorities namely the officials of the 2nd
respondent, and therefore, the Government cannot be blamed.
3. Learned panel counsel appearing for the 2nd respondent points out that for the implementation
of the Act in question, the Managing Director of the Corporation has already issued orders dated
03.01.2020 & 08.01.2020 and therefore, no complaint can be made against his client. He also
submits that there are some spurious claims made by the unscrupulous members of the community
and the same needs to be enquired into so that the fruits of the legislative policy reach the right
hands. He assures the court that all steps would be taken for the implementation of the policy before
long.
4. Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and having perused the petition
papers, this Court places on record, its deep anguish for the enormous delay brooked in
implementing the Socio-Welfare policy enacted by the Parliament in the form of the Act for the
benefit of oppressed classes who choicelessly do manual scavenging disregarding the degradation of
basic human value & dignity involved in it. Permitting such a job is abhorrent to the notions of
civility and core human value. Therefore the Parliament has enacted the subject legislation for
eradicating the same and for rehabilitation of persons exploitatively associated with it. Though
nearly a decade has lapsed since making of this statute, its benefits are eluding the concerned
section of the society, because of apathy of the quarters that be. Tolerating this callousness
attributable to the authorities virtually amounts to tacitly contributing to the continuation of the
practice of manual scavenging and thereby placing premium on the violation of law. It pains the
court to the core though in the State of Karnataka the earlier law enacted by the Parliament i.e., the
Employment of Manual Scavengers & Construction of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act, 1993 was in
force since 1997, its policy was frugally implemented. Nothing much has changed despite the 2013
Act that has been made keeping in view several international conventions & covenants.
5. The Apex Court in SAFAI KARMACHARI ANDOLAN supra had directed the authorities to
identify all persons who have died in severage work such as manholes, septic tanks, etc. since 1993
and award compensation of Rs.10 lakh for each such death to the dependent members of the family
of the deceased by way of compensatory rehabilitation on the principles of justice & transformation.
What it had directed in paragraph 24 is worth reproducing:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/14112163/ 39
Sri.Suresh vs State Of Karnataka on 31 January, 2022
"24.In the light of various provisions of the Act referred to above and the Rules in
addition to various directions issued by this Court, we hereby direct all the State
Governments and the Union Territories to fully implement the same and take
appropriate action for non-implementation as well as violation of the provisions
contained in the 2013 Act. Inasmuch as the Act 2013 occupies the entire field, we are
of the view that no further monitoring is required by this Court. However, we once
again reiterate that the duty is cast on all the States and the Union Territories to fully
implement and 26 Page 27 to take action against the violators. Henceforth, persons
aggrieved are permitted to approach the authorities concerned at the first instance
and thereafter the High Court having jurisdiction."
6. The 2nd respondent-Managing Director of the Corporation except issuing the above two orders
dated 03.01.2020 & 08.01.2020, has done nothing. Implementation of the policy is one thing, and
passing orders after orders is another; a paper boat cannot carry the persons and these orders are
nothing more than a paper boat. Not even a grain of benefit is yielded to the deserving members of
the scavenging classes. The Government seems to be a mute spectator to all this, though the funds
have lapsed because of non-implementation of the policy which is time bound. All this is not a happy
thing to happen.
7. A Co-ordinate Bench of this Court vide interim order dated 24.01.2022 had directed the 2nd
respondent- Managing Director to file an affidavit as to the steps taken towards implementation of
the statutory policy, presumably because there was nothing on record to evidence anything being
done. However, no such affidavit has been filed nor any explanation is offered for not filing one. Be
that as it may. Now, learned Panel Counsel appearing for the 2nd respondent assures of taking all
effective steps for the implementation of the policy in question keeping in view his two orders
referred to above. He also assures that the enquiry into spurious claims would be accomplished on a
war footing and that the statutory policy would be implemented in a time bound way. The fact that
serious matters of this kind are not much debated in the public platforms and government portals
dismays this court, to say the least.
In the above circumstances, all these petitions are disposed off placing on record the undertaking of
the 2nd respondent given as above. The respondents 1 & 2 are directed to take all steps for the
implementation of the statutory policy on a war footing and in any event within a period of three
months and further report compliance to the Registrar General of this Court.
It is made clear that if the undertaking and the direction is not implemented, the same would
amount to contempt of this court and heavy & exemplary costs may be imposed personally on the
incumbents of the offices concerned, at the next level of legal battle.
Now, no costs.
