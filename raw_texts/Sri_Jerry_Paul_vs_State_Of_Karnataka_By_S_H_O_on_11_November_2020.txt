ORDER
The present petition has been filed by the petitioner under Section 438 of Cr.P.C. to release him on
bail in the event of his arrest in Crime No.10/2020 of Commercial Street Police Station for the
offences punishable under Sections 118, 406, 409, 411, 419, 420, 462, 467, 468, 471, 473, 474, 475,
477(A), 201, 120B r/w 34 of IPC.
2. I have heard the learned counsel Sri.Nanjundaswamy N. for the petitioner virtually and the
learned Special Public Prosecutor-I Sri.V.M.Sheelavanth and the learned High Court Government
Pleader Sri.Mahesh Shetty, for the respondent-State.
3. The Managing Director of Karnataka Agricultural Marketing Federation filed the complaint
alleging that they have called quotation from various banks for keeping the fixed deposits with the
said federation by informing that they will give higher rate of interest. The Board had decided to
keep the fixed deposit of Rs.100 Crores in the Syndicate Bank. In pursuance of the same, on
18.11.2019 transferred an amount of Rs.100 Crores from Andhra Bank, Rajajinagar Branch to
Syndicate Bank, Uttarahalli Brach through RTGS and the said amount has been kept in two
accounts for Rs.50 Crores each. Subsequently, on 21.1.2020 when an enquiry has been made, the
bank officials informed that out of the deposited amount of Rs.100 Crores, only Rs.52 Crores has
been left out and they also informed that about Rs.48 Crores has been transferred to various
accounts and on verification of the certificates given to the bank, they came to know that fabricated
certificates have been produced and the amount has been got transferred. On the basis of the
complaint a case has been registered.
4. It is the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner that already charge sheet has been
filed. Either in the complaint or in the charge sheet the name of the petitioner is not found. It is his
further submission that already accused Nos.3, 7, 12, 17 and 18 have been released on bail by the
trial Court and the petitioner is also entitled to be released on bail. It is his further submission that
there is no allegation of misappropriation of any funds of the complainant by the petitioner. It is his
further submission that entire charge sheet does not disclose any serious overt acts of the petitioner.
It is his further submission that the petitioner has been apprehended by the Commercial Street
Police on 10.9.2020 at about 9.30 pm. and he has been in custody till 14.9.2020 and thereafter on
14.9.2020 they have got issued a notice under Section 41A of Cr.P.C. and the petitioner has been
released. It is his further submission that subsequently the police are asking him to pay
Rs.39,00,000/-, otherwise they are going to apprehend him. The petitioner is an innocent person
and there is apprehension of his arrest by the police. He is ready to abide by the conditions that may
be imposed by this Court and ready to offer the sureties. On these grounds he prayed to allow the
petition and to release the petitioner on anticipatory bail.
5. Per contra, the learned SPP-I Sri.V.M.Sheelavant vehemently argued and submitted that the
petitioner- accused has not made out any grounds so as to release him on anticipatory bail. It is his
further submission that name of the petitioner is neither found in the charge sheet nor in any of the
charge sheet material and no allegations are there as against the petitioner. It is his further
submission that on 14.9.2020 notice has been got issued under Section 41A of Cr.P.C. It is his

Sri.Jerry Paul vs State Of Karnataka By S.H.O. on 11 November, 2020
further submission that the provisions of Section 41A of Cr.P.C. are very clear that where the arrest
of a person is not required under the provisions of sub-section (1) of Section 41, then issue of notice
directing the person against whom a reasonable complaint has been made or credible information
has been received or a reasonable suspicion exists that he has committed a cognizable offence. It is
his further submission that the Officer of the station house if he is intending to apprehend him, in
that regard he has to pass a reasoned order, then thereafter he ought to be arrested. It is his further
submission that if a notice has been issued, a duty caste upon the person that he shall comply with
the terms of the said notice. It is his further submission that if he fails to obey the terms of the
notice, then under such circumstances the competent authority will have a right to arrest him for the
offence mentioned in the notice. No such circumstances are existing in the present facts of the case.
It is his further submission that there is no apprehension of arrest of the petitioner in the said case
and the petitioner-accused has been called only for the purpose of enquiry. Under such
circumstances the present petition is not maintainable. On these grounds he prayed to dismiss the
petition.
6. I have carefully and cautiously gone through the submissions made by the learned counsel
appearing for the parties and perused the records.
7. It is the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that there is apprehension of arrest by
the Commercial Street Police in Crime No.10/2020. But as could be seen from the material
produced, the name of the petitioner is not found in anywhere in the charge sheet record. When the
petitioner has not been arrayed as an accused and already the charge sheet has been filed, then
under such circumstance the petitioner-accused apprehending that he is likely to be arrested,
appears to be not justifiable and proper. It is not the case of the petitioner that police have obtained
necessary permission under Section 173(8) of Cr.P.C. for further investigation. In that light, there is
no apprehension of his arrest.
8. Be that as it may. Even as could be seen from the record it is brought to the notice of this Court by
the learned counsel for the petitioner that a notice has been got issued by police to the petitioner
under Section 41A of Cr.P.C. on 14.9.2020 as per Annexure-E. It is the contention of the learned
SPP-I that when notice has been issued under Section 41A of Cr.P.C., it indicates that arrest of
person is not required, in that light, such notice has been issued. As such there is no apprehension of
arrest. For the purpose of brevity, I quote Section 41A of Cr.P.C. which reads as under:
41A. Notice of appearance before police officer.
(1) The police officer shall in all cases where the arrest of a person is not required under the
provisions of sub-
section (1) of section 41, issue a notice directing the person against whom a reasonable complaint
has been made, or credible information has been received, or a reasonable suspicion exists that he
has committed a cognizable offence, to appear before him or at such other place as may be specified
in the notice.

Sri.Jerry Paul vs State Of Karnataka By S.H.O. on 11 November, 2020
(2) Where such a notice is issued to any person, it shall be the duty of that person to comply with the
terms of the notice.
(3) Where such person complies and continues to comply with the notice, he shall not be arrested in
respect of the offence referred to in the notice unless, for reasons to be recorded, the police officer is
of the opinion that he ought to be arrested.
(4) Where such person, at any time, fails to comply with the terms of the notice or is unwilling to
identify himself, the police officer may, subject to such orders as may have been passed by the
competent Court in this behalf, arrest him for the offence mentioned in the notice.
9. On close reading of Section 41A of the Act, it indicates that where the arrest of a person is not
required under the provisions of sub-section (1) of Section 41 of Cr.P.C., then the notice could be got
issued to the person against whom a reasonable complaint has been made or credible information
has been received or suspicion exists for having committed a cognizable offence to appear before
him and it also makes it clear that it is the duty of the
- 10 -
person to comply the terms of the notice and when the said person complies and continues to
comply with notice, he shall not be arrested in respect of the offence referred to in the notice unless
for the reasons to be recorded. The police officer is of the opinion that he ought to be arrested and in
that regard he has to pass an order.
10. On going through the said provision and the records, admittedly a notice has been got issued
under Section 41A of Cr.P.C. When once notice has been issued under Section 41A of Cr.P.C., that
itself makes it clear that the arrest of the petitioner is not required. Be that as it may. It is the
submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner that on 10.09.2020 at about 9.30 p.m. he has
been taken to custody and was there till 14.09.2020. In that event, if police wanted to arrest him,
definitely they could have done so. Not arresting and issuing notice under Section 41A of Cr.P.C. and
sending him, goes to show that in terms of the provisions of Section 41A of Cr.P.C., they do not want
to apprehend or arrest the petitioner.
- 11 -
11. Taking into consideration the factual matrix of the case on hand and the above said proposition
of law, I am of the considered opinion that there is no apprehension of arrest of the
petitioner-accused. Even though it is contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the
police are demanding the petitioner to give Rs.39,00,000/-, but in order to substantiate the said
fact, no material has been got produced. On such submission anticipatory bail cannot be granted.
12. Taking into consideration the above said facts and circumstances the petitioner has not made out
any grounds to grant anticipatory bail. Petition is liable to be dismissed and accordingly it is
dismissed.
