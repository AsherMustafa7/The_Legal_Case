Anand Das vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 1 April, 2019
K9KE424E021831, which has been seized in connection with Complaint Case No. 427 of 2016 for
the offences punishable under Sections 47(a) and 53(a) of the Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act for
recovery of 300 ml of I.M.F.L. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that for the present he
would not be pressing the relief for quashing the order dated 08.08.2017 passed by the District
Magistrate, Kishanganj in Case No. 17 of 2016. He, however, submits that liberty may be granted to
the petitioner to challenge the confiscation order in an appropriate jurisdiction by filing an appeal
before the Commissioner within a period of 30 days from today.
In view of the circumstances noted, we allow the petitioner to question the order of confiscation
before the Appellate Authority within a period of 30 days from today. In case such an appeal is
preferred within the aforesaid period accompanied with an application for condonation of delay, the
appellate authority shall consider the same keeping in mind that the petitioner was prosecuting his
remedy before this Court and the appeal shall be heard on its own merit and disposed of
expeditiously.
Patna High Court CWJC No.18620 of 2018 dt.01-04-2019 Learned counsel for the petitioner, at this
stage, submits that because the appellate authority has no power to pass an interim order of release,
he would press this application for a provisional release of the vehicle in question.
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the vehicle is lying in the open sky in the police
station and it has turned almost a junk and if not allowed to be released, the State is not going to
gain anyway in confiscation proceeding. Learned counsel submit that the petitioner is willing to give
such surety and undertakings which may be required to protect the interest of the State during the
pendency of the appeal.
Having heard learned counsel for the parties and in the circumstances discussed above, we direct
that the vehicle in question be released provisionally in favour of the petitioner on production of
ownership and registration with respect to vehicle in question in his name before the District
Magistrate-cum- Collector, Kishanganj with two sureties (one local) to the extent of the value of the
vehicle as indicated in the insurance document. The petitioner while submitting the sureties shall
also furnish the following affidavits/undertakings:
(i) That the vehicle in question has never been involved in any offence of similar
nature in past and shall not Patna High Court CWJC No.18620 of 2018
dt.01-04-2019 indulge in similar offence in further.
(ii) That the petitioner shall not indulge in creating any third party right or interest in
respect of the vehicle during the pendency of the appeal and shall not alienate the
vehicle during this period.
(iii) The petitioner shall furnish an undertaking to produce the vehicle before the
confiscating authority as and when required.

(iv) Prior to release of the vehicle, a Panchanama would be prepared by the
confiscating authority wherein the photograph of the vehicle shall be taken and will
be certified by the petitioner and the same shall be kept on record so that in future if
so required, it may be used as a secondary evidence.
The petitioner shall furnish an undertaking not to challenge the said Panchanama in course of trial.
The release shall be allowed within a period of 14 days from the date of submission of the sureties
(one local) and the undertakings as stated above. This release of the vehicle would however be
subject to the order passed in appeal and in case the petitioner fails to take recourse to the appellate
remedy within the time allowed, the release order shall stand recalled with liberty to the confiscating
authority to proceed in Patna High Court CWJC No.18620 of 2018 dt.01-04-2019 accordance with
law.
With the observations/directions above, this writ petition is allowed.
