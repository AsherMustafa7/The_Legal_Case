Case :- RERA APPEAL No. - 20 of 2025
Appellant :- Dream Town Developers Pvt. Ltd., Hathras Thru. Director Mr. Krishna Kumar Dixit
Respondent :- Nihal Singh
Counsel for Appellant :- Ajai Kumar Singh,Shobhit Singh
Hon'ble Manish Mathur,J.
1. Heard learned counsel for appellant. In view of order being passed, notices to respondent stand
dispensed with.
2. Appeal under Section 58 of the Real Estate (Regulation & Development) Act, 2016 has been
preferred against order dated 16.12.2024 passed in Appeal No.662 of 2022, Dream Town
Developers Pvt. Ltd. v. Nihal Singh by the U.P. Real Estate Appellate Tribunal, Lucknow.
3. Learned counsel for appellant submits that initially in pursuance of complaint made by

made within a period of 45 days thereafter.
4. It is submitted that the appellant made all endeavour for execution of the sale deed prior to the
cut off date indicated but since the same could not be done, it was ready and willing to refund the
amount deposited by respondent and it was in these circumstances that order dated 04.12.2020
passed by the Regulatory Authority was not challenged whereafter order dated 10.03.2022 was
passed by Regulatory Authority in execution proceedings and recovery challan has also been issued
on 27.06.2022.
5. It is submitted that appellant did not have any knowledge with regard to execution proceedings
and came into knowledge with regard to same only once the recovery challan was issued upon it
whereafter the Appeal had been preferred and was rejected.
6. It is submitted that appellate authority has rejected the Appeal primarily on ground that reasons
for delay had not been explained satisfactorily as also on ground that since principal order dated
04.12.2020 has not been challenged, the Appeal having been preferred against consequential order
without seeking relief against the principal order, was not maintainable.
7. It is submitted that once the first portion of principal order could not be complied with, the
appellant being ready and willing to comply with second portion of the order, as well as fact that the
appellant did not have any prior knowledge with regard to passing of order in execution
proceedings, the appeal was required to be entertained.
8. It is also submitted that specific ground had been taken by appellant that as per order dated
04.12.2020 passed by the Regulatory Authority, the second portion which came into operation once
the sale deed was not executed by 20.01.2021, provided that the appellant should refund the amount
deposited by the respondent as per the application form. It is submitted that the ground taken was
that although Application form indicated an amount of Rs.22,50,000/- excluding Service Tax but in
fact only a sum of Rs.7,50,000/- was deposited by the respondent and was an aspect required to be
considered by the appellate court.
9. It has been submitted that the substantial question of law therefore arising in the present appeal
would be whether the appellate court committed substantial error of law in relying upon fact that
principal order dated 04.12.2020 was not challenged and ignoring the fact that the said order in fact
was complied with with respondent not being aggrieved thereagainst?
10. The second substantial question of law indicated is whether the proceedings under Section 63 of
the RERA Act, 2017 arising out of order dated 04.12.2020, though delayed, was properly explained
due to which the Appeal was required to be adjudicated on merits?
11. The third substantial question of law indicated is as to whether the appellate authority has failed
to appreciate that Appeal had been preferred only against order dated 10.03.2022 passed in
execution proceedings since the appellant was aggrieved only by the said order and not by principal
order dated 04.12.2020?

12. Upon consideration of submissions advanced by learned counsel for appellant and perusal of
material on record, it is evident from a perusal of impugned order and admitted by learned counsel
for appellant that the initial complaint instituted by respondent - allottee was allowed by means of
order dated 04.12.2020 with twin directions being issued; firstly, the appellant herein was directed
to execute a sale deed in favour of allottee by 20.01.2021 and secondly, that in case the first part was
not complied with, the appellant herein was required to refund within a period of forty five days
from 20.01.2021, the amount deposited by the respondent/allottee as indicated in the Application
Form.
13. So far as the aspect of rejection of Application for condonation of delay is concerned, it is the
discretion of the Real Estate Appellate Tribunal with regard to same once it is indicated that the
reasons taken by the appellant for filing Appeal with delay is unsatisfactory.
14. However, First Appeal has not been rejected only on the ground of delay but also on the ground
that Appeal has been preferred only against consequential order passed in execution proceedings
without challenging principal order dated 04.12.2020 and therefore the Appeal was not
maintainable.
15. So far as aforesaid aspect is concerned, although learned counsel for appellant has submitted
that the appellant was not aggrieved by order dated 04.12.2020 but submits that although the
Application form accepted from respondent/allottee indicates an amount deposited to the tune of
Rs.22,50,000/- excluding service tax but actually the said allottee had deposited a sum of only
Rs.7,50,000/-.
16. Clearly, in view of such submission, the aspect of appellant being aggrieved by the second
portion of order dated 04.12.2020 is evident since he particularly disputes the amount deposited by
the respondent/allottee.
17. In the considered opinion of this Court, the same would have provided appellant with an ample
ground to challenge order dated 04.12.2020, which having not been done, the executing court was
bound to comply with order dated 04.12.2020 in its entirety particularly since the executing court
cannot go beyond the decree.
18. The impugned order has considered the aforesaid aspect particularly that Appeal had been
preferred only against consequential order without seeking relief against the principal order and
therefore impliedly Appeal was held not to be maintainable.
19. This Court is in respectful agreement with the finding recorded by the Real Estate Appellate
Tribunal by means of order dated 16.12.2024.
20. In view thereof, this Court does not find any substantial question of law arising for adjudication.
21. The appeal therefore being devoid of merits is dismissed at the admission stage itself.
