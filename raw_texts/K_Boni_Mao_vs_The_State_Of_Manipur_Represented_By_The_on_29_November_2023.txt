representation dated 01.08.2023 to the District Treasury Officer, Imphal West for payment of the

K. Boni Mao vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 29 November, 2023
Sir, In reference to the above subject, vide No. 102/450(K)/2023- GA(C)/1569-F
dated 12th September, 2023, I am hereby furnishing comment on relevant paras.
Para 6. I acknowledge that this office received revised authority in respect of Smt. K.
Boni Mao from Accountant General (A & E), Manipur, Imphal in the month of
March, 2022. The details was entered in Pension Manipur portal and excepting
Gratuity amounting to Rs. 1,44,787/- and Commutation amounting to Rs. 6,46,998/-
payment of other pensionary benefit arising out of revised pay was made in the
month of April, 2022. Her gratuity & commutation is entered in April, 2022 month
batch.
Para 7. I acknowledge that this office received application/representation from the
pensioner, but I am not in the position to make payment of the above mentioned
gratuity and commutation as I have not received instruction from higher authority.
In this regard I would like to inform you that, due to financial constraint of the state,
payment of any kinds are restricted and payment is made only when instruction is
received from Finance Department, Government of Manipur.
Further, I would like to mention that gratuity and commutation has been released
upto the month of January, 2022 batch for revised pensioner, thereafter this office
has not received any instruction. Since her batch is April, 2022, we are unable to
make her gratuity and commutation payment.
Therefore, this office performed its duty as per order and instruction received from
higher authority and I believe there were no lapses.
Your's faithfully (Sushil Kumar Ningombam) Treasury Officer, Treasury, Imphal
West.
WP(C) No. 633 of 2023 Page 4
[6] Mr. N. Ibotombi, learned senior counsel for the petitioner,
submits that the stand of the State Government is that the pensionary benefit cannot
be released due to financial constraint. It is further submitted that pension is an
entitlement of an employee for the past service done by him or her and it cannot be
withheld without any reason. It is also stated that financial constraint of the State is
not a ground for denying pensionary benefit to the retired employee. He prays that
the respondents be directed to release due amount to the petitioner.
[7] Mr. Shyam Sharma, learned G.A. for the State respondent, submits that the State
Government has not withheld the pensionary benefits on any extraneous ground, but
it is compelled by the poor financial condition of the State. He submits that the
amount will be released as soon as necessary instruction has been received from the
higher authority. Mr. S. Samarjeet, Sr. PCCG has clarified that respondent No.3 has
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/8236379/ 3
K. Boni Mao vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 29 November, 2023
already issued revised Authority and it is for the State authority to release the due
amount.
[8] This Court has considered the submissions made by the learned counsel for the
parties, perused the materials on record and discussed the relevant law in this regard.
[9] It is settled proposition of law that pension is not a bounty from the state
authority to the retired employee. It is the compensation for the past service rendered
by the employee and is a means of substance in the post retired. The pension cannot
be withheld without assigning any reason.

[10] In the case of Jharkhand & Ors. v. Jitendra Kumar
Srivastava & Anr. reported as MANU/SC/0801/2013 : (2013) 12 SCC 210 Hon'ble
Supreme Court held that the right to pensionary benefit is a constitutional right as as
such cannot be taken away without proper justification. Further, in the case of Dr.
Uma Agarwal v. State of U.P. reported as MANU/SC/0184/1999 : (1999) 3 SCC 438,
it was held that grant of pensionary benefits is not a bounty, but a right of the
employee, and as such cannot be denied without proper jurisdiction. In the case of
D.S. Nakara & Ors. v. Union of India reported as MANU/SC/0237/1982 :
(1983) 1 SCC 3005, a 5 Judge Bench of the Hon'ble Apex Court held that "31.......(i)
that pension is neither a bounty nor a matter of grace depending upon the sweet will
of the employer and that it creates a vested right subject to 1972 Rules which are
statutory in character because they are enacted in exercise of powers conferred by the
proviso to Article 309 and clause (5) of Article 148 of the Constitution; (ii) that the
pension is not an ex gratia payment but it is a payment for the past service rendered;
and (ii) it is a social welfare measure rendering socio-economic justice to those who
in the hey-day of their life ceaselessly toiled for the employer on an assurance that in
their old age they would not be left in lurch. It must also be noticed that the quantum
of pension is a certain percentage correlated to the average emoluments drawn
during last three years of service reduced to 10 months under liberalised pension
scheme, Its payment is dependent upon an additional condition of impeccable
behaviour even subsequent to retirement, that is, since the cessation of the contract
of WP(C) No. 633 of 2023 Page 6 service and that it can be reduced or withdrawn as a
disciplinary measure".
In the case of Sudhir Chandra Sarkar v. Tata Iron and Steel Co. Ltd. reported as
MANU/SC/0208/1984 : (1984) 3 SCC 369, it was held that "18. For centuries the courts swung in
favour of the view that pension is either a bounty or a gratuitous payment for loyal service rendered
depending upon the sweet will or grace of the employer not claimable as a right and therefore, no
right to pension can be enforced through court. This view held the field and a suit to recover pension
was held not maintainable. With the modern notions of social justice and social security, concept of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/8236379/ 4
K. Boni Mao vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 29 November, 2023
pension underwent a radical change and it is now well-settled that pension is a right and payment of
it does not depend upon the discretion of the employer, nor can it be denied at the sweet will or
fancy of the employer." [11] Poor financial condition of the State and non-receiving of the
instruction from the higher authority is not a ground to deny pensionary benefit and other
entitlement to the pensioner. The contention of the State Government for releasing the pensionary
benefit of the petitioner is without any substance and perverse on the face of it.
[12] Reference may be made to Rule 9 of CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972 which empowers withholding of
pension or gratuity or both, if the pensioner is found guilty of grave misconduct or negligence during
the period of service in a departmental or judicial proceeding. Apart from Rule 9, there is no other
provisions which stipulate withholding of pension or gratuity or any other pensionary benefit. In the
present case, the reason cited for not releasing the pensionary benefit is the poor financial condition
WP(C) No. 633 of 2023 Page 7 of the State and non-clearance for the payment from higher
authority. The contents of the letter dated 24.10.2023 sent by the Treasury Officer, Imphal West to
the Office of Govt. Advocate, High Court are not within the scope of Rule 9 of CCS (Pension) Rules,
1972 for the simple reason that there was no departmental or judicial proceeding against the
petitioner holding her of guilty of grave misconduct. This Court is of firmed opinion that
withholding the pensionary benefit of the petitioner by the State authority is without any substance
and the same is in violation of aforesaid Rule 9 and also against the law laid down by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court. Such illegal action cannot be sustained in a welfare State.
[13] Accordingly, writ petition is allowed. The respondents are directed to release the enhanced
amount of Gratuity and arrear of Commutation as calculated and authorised by the office of the
Principal Accountant General within a period of 2 (two) months from the date of receipt of a copy of
this order, failing which it shall carry an interest @ 6% per annum from 11.02.2022, the date on
which the office of Principal Accountant General issued the revised authority of pension. [14] With
the above observation, writ petition is disposed of. [15] Send a copy of this order to the Chief
Secretary, Manipur for information.
