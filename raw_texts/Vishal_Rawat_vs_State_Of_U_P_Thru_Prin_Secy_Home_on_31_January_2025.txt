of the petitioner and investigate the same, in the interest of law and justice.

with respect to non compliance of the guidelines issued by Hon'ble Supreme Court in
the case of Lalita Kumari vs. Government of U.P. and others (2014) 2 SCC, in the
interest of justice."
(3) It is the case of the petitioner that he tried to lodge an FIR in Police Station Para, District
Lucknow and also made complaint to the Commissioner of Police concerned and thereafter
approached to the Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (West) Lucknow regarding cognizable
offence committed by the accused, however, the FIR was not lodged.
(4) The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Lalita Kumari Vs. Government of Uttar Pradesh and
others reported in (2014) 2 SCC 1, has observed that a Police Officer cannot avoid his duty for
registering an offence if in the application cognizable offence discloses and in case they avoid such
responsibility, an action to be taken against the erring Officer under Section 166-A of I.P.C. or
Departmental Proceedings be initiated and such proceedings can be taken against erring Officer in
not registering the FIR.
(5) The petitioner has moved an application to the Opposite party nos.2 to 5 to lodged an FIR in
pursuance of the Guidelines issued by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.
(6) Learned A.G.A. has also pointed out that the judgment rendered by the Division Bench of this
Court in the case of Waseem Haider Vs. State of U.P. and others reported in (2021) 2 ADJ 86, to say
that after considering the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the Lalita Kumari's case
(supra), this Court expressed its opinion that the informant has statutory remedy under Section 156
(3) Cr.P.C. or under Section 200 of Cr.P.C. The Paragraph-45 of the said judgment is being quoted
hereinbelow:-
"45. Before parting, the conclusion arrived at based on the above discussion and
analysis is delineated below for ready reference and convenience :-
(1) Writ of mandamus to compel the police to perform its statutory duty under
Section 154 Cr.P.C can be denied to the informant/victim for non-availing of
alternative remedy under Sections 154 (3), 156 (3), 190 and 200 Cr.P.C., unless the
four exceptions enumerated in decision of Apex Court in the the case of Whirlpool
Corporation Vs. Registrar of Trade Marks, Mumbai and Ors., (1998) 8 SCC 1, come to
rescue of the informant / victim.
(2) The verdict of Apex Court in the case of Lalita Kumari Vs. Government of U.P. &
Ors. reported in (2014) 2 SCC 1 does not pertain to issue of entitlement to writ of
mandamus for compelling the police to perform statutory duty under Section 154
Cr.P.C without availing alternative remedy under Section 154 (3), 156 (3), 190 and

200 Cr.P.C..
(3) The informant/victim after furnishing first information regarding cognizable
offence does not become functus officio for seeking writ of mandamus for compelling
the police authorities to perform their statutory duty under Section 154 Cr.P.C in case
the FIR is not lodged.
(4) The proposed accused against whom the first information of commission of
cognizable offence is made, is not a necessary party to be impleaded in a petition
under Article 226 of the Constitution of India seeking issuance of writ of mandamus
to compel the police to perform their statutory duty under Section 154 Cr.P.C".
(7) This Court is of the opinion that if the petitioner is aggrieved by non-lodging of the FIR,
therefore, he has appropriate remedy of filing a complaint under Section 156 (3) Cr.P.C. or under
Section 200 of the Cr.P.C.
(8) This writ petition stands disposed of.
