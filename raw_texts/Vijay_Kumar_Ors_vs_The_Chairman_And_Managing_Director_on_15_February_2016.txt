CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE NAVANITI PRASAD SINGH
And
HONOURABLE JUSTICE SMT. NILU AGRAWAL
ORAL JUDGMENT
(Per: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE NAVANITI PRASAD SINGH) Date: 15-02-2016 The writ
petitioners, in all the three writ petitions, Patna High Court CWJC No.1861 of 2014 dt.15-02-2016
challenge the common order of the Central Administrative Tribunal, Patna Bench, Patna dated
13.11.2013 and 04.08.2015, passed in O.A. No. 521 of 2013 and O.A. No. 824 of 2013 respectively in
relation to an internal promotional examination that was conducted by the Bharat Sanchar Nigam
Ltd., Bihar Circle (hereinafter referred to as the B.S.N.L.). These examinations are part of
promotional examination in respect of seats reserved for a particular category of employees for
promotion. The examination was of objective type questions. As before the Tribunal so also before
us, three fold contentions were raised, which are as follows :
(i). Five questions having been found to be wrong not only they ought to be deleted
but at least one mark added in respect of each such question as was done in different
circles.
(ii). There were questions which were beyond the syllabus. In other circles this was
accepted and the questions were deleted. In Bihar circle also similar action should be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/24739741/ 6
Vijay Kumar & Ors vs The Chairman And Managing Director ... on 15 February, 2016
taken.
(iii). There still remains some questions, the answer to which was wrong.
Considering the aforesaid, the prayer was that the results, which were declared in the year 2013, be
re-evaluated. It may be also mentioned that because of the pendency of the applications Patna High
Court CWJC No.1861 of 2014 dt.15-02-2016 before the Tribunal over 236 persons, who were
otherwise qualified for promotion in the said examination, their promotions also got held up. The
Tribunal negated the pleas and being aggrieved the present writ petitions have been filed.
We have heard Sri Chittaranjan Sinha, learned Senior Counsel, who led the arguments on behalf of
the petitioners and other counsel in support of the writ petitions and learned counsel for the
B.S.N.L. and with their consent we are disposing of these writ petitions at this stage itself.
We may note at the very outset, that though the question paper was same for various circles, each
circle has an independent entity and the promotions are within the cadre which is limited to the
circle itself. A promotion granted today in one circle pursuant to the said examination would have
no effect on any other person similarly situated in another circle. In other words, each circle is an
independent unit.
Keeping the aforesaid in mind, so far as the first contention is concerned, we agree with the Tribunal
that once the expert committee found that five questions were wrong their recommendation to
delete the five questions was correct and it made no sense in adding a mark instead of five questions
to be deleted. We agree and endorse the same view. If the questions were wrong, it is well settled,
they have to be deleted. For a deleted question no mark Patna High Court CWJC No.1861 of 2014
dt.15-02-2016 can be awarded. It matters little whether any such decision was taken in other circles.
As noted above, each circle is independent.
The second contention was that some questions were outside the syllabus. The expert committee set
up for the Bihar Circle was not agreeable to the said. It is submitted that in other circles this was
accepted and questions were deleted. The Tribunal did not accede to the request of the writ
petitioners and rightly so. We also think that it is not open for the Court or Tribunal to sit as an
appellate authority over the views taken by an expert committee in this regard. The matter must rest
there.
The third objection was that there were certain other wrong questions or wrong answers. The expert
committee thought it otherwise. The Tribunal refused to interfere and in our view rightly so. We
may notice that even if there was a mistake it was without discrimination, for every body. It is not
being urged that it was so purposely designed to benefit any person or some persons or any group of
persons. It was a mistake if at all, across the circle. That being so, it would not be advisable for this
Court to become wiser and sit as an appellate body to re-evaluate the questions and answers as an
expert body over the expert body.

Vijay Kumar & Ors vs The Chairman And Managing Director ... on 15 February, 2016
Thus, in our view, no interference is called for. Each circle, being a separate unit, has come to
different decisions, but for all the examinees within that circle there cannot be a comparison Patna
High Court CWJC No.1861 of 2014 dt.15-02-2016 between the decision taken by the authorities of
one circle and other circle because each circle is an independent unit. However, this does not debar
the apex body i.e. corporate office of B.S.N.L. to take any appropriate decision forthwith, if they are
so persuaded in the matter, as the next examination in relation to promotions in relation to the
years 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16 have already been announced, taking into account all the
unfulfilled vacancies and carried over vacancies which is open to all the petitioners as well.
Be that as it may, in the facts and circumstances noted above, we do not take it to be an appropriate
case for this Court to interfere in the matter. We find no merit in these writ petitions.
With the observations and directions as aforesaid, these writ petitions stand disposed of.
