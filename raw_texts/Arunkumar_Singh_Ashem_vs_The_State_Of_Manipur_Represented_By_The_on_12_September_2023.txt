[4] It is stated that Department of Personnel & Administrative Reforms (Personnel Division), Govt.
of Manipur issued Office Memorandum dated 09.10.2020 replacing 'vacancies' by 'total sanctioned
post' at Column 10 of MPSC Form-8 in the said Rules. It is stated that the Department of Personnel
& Administrative Reforms (Personnel Division), Govt. of Manipur issued letter dated 27.07.2022
under the subject 'step for rectification of systemic deficiencies in Engineering Deptts. - Regarding'
and suggested revised provision proposed for appointment of AE as 80% by promotion and 20% by
direct recruitment. 80% of the promotion quota shall be filled up as per seniority list. Reservation of
SC/ST in promotion quota shall be in the overall vacancies and not with reference to sub-quota. The
present writ petition is filed challenging Column 10 of the MPSC Form-8 for providing 50:50 sub
quota for the Degree Holders and Diploma Holders SO-I in the 60% promotion quota from the post
of SO-I to AE as the same is violative Page 5 against the degree holder SO-I. In view of the fact that
at present there are 152 Section Officers, 120 Section Officers are Degree Holders and only 32 are
Diploma Holders and the distribution of sub-quota as 50:50 is violative and not proportionate with
the number of incumbent officers eligible for promotion. It is also pointed out that there is no quota
for direct recruit and promotee in the cadre of Executive Engineer in the same department and in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/104033097/ 4
Arunkumar Singh Ashem vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 12 September, 2023
the proposal put up by the Department of Personnel & Administrative Reforms (Personnel
Division), Government of Manipur. It is proposed that promotion to AE be 80% by promotion and
20% by direct recruitment and 80% by promotion quota shall be filled up as per seniority list and
there is no 50:50 sub-quota.
[5] Mr. E. Premjit, learned counsel for the petitioners, relies on the judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in Raghunath Prasad Singh Vs. Secretary, Home (Police) Department of Bihar
(1988) Supp. SCC 59 to the point that an officer should get atleast two promotions in his career and
the impugned rule amounts to forfeiting the right of the Degree Holder SO-I for further promotion
in their career.
[6] The prayer is reproduced below:-
a) to admit and allow the present Writ Petition;
b) issue an appropriate writ, order or direction quashing impugned provisions contained in Column
10 of MPSC Form- 8 of the PWD, IFCD and PHED, Manipur [Assistant Engineer
(Civil/Mechanical)/Assistant Surveyor of Works] Recruitment Page 6 Rules, 2013 providing division
60% promotion quota into sub-quota of 50:50 between Degree Holder Section Officer Grade-I and
Diploma Holder Section Officer Grade-I so far it relates to PHE Department, Government of
Manipur;
c) direct the Respondents to fill the 60% promotion quota of Assistant Engineer in PHE Department
as per combined seniority list of Section Officer Grade-I;
d) pass any further order/orders, direction/directions as deem fit and proper under the facts and
circumstances of the case.
AND
-In the interim-
e) restrain the Respondents from taking any steps for holding DPC for appointment by way of
promotion to the post of Assistant Engineer in Public Health Engineering Department pending
disposal of the instant petition;
f) pass such other orders and further orders, direction/directions as may be deemed necessary and
proper on the facts and in the circumstances of the case.
[7] It is prayed that during the pendency of the present writ petition, the State respondents be
restrained from taking any steps for holding DPC for appointment by way of promotion to the post
of AE in Public Health Engineering Department under the impugned rule.

Page 7 [8] Mr. S. Nepolean, learned Government Advocate, assisted by Ms. R.K. Emily, learned
Deputy G.A., submits that the Recruitment Rules of 2013 providing 60% promotion quota into two
sub-quotas of 50:50 between Degree Holder SO-I and Diploma Holder SO-I has been formed under
the provisions of Article 309 of the Constitution and the same has been in existence even before the
petitioners joined the service of the PHE Department. The only ground in the writ petition that out
of the 152 Section Officers, 120 belong to Degree Holders and only 32 are Diploma Holders is not a
criteria to challenge the service rule. Learned G.A. highlights that the petitioners have measurably
failed to show that the division of 50:50 sub- quota out of 60% promotion quota to the post of AE
has infringed the right of the Degree Holders. The same rule is applicable in all engineering
departments such as PWD, IFCD and PHED. It is submitted that in the exigency of service, the
numbers of Degree Holders and Diploma Holders may vary from time to time. Learned G.A. has
pointed out that if the numbers of diploma holder increases in future then the rule is liable to be
challenged. It is submitted that reliance on the proposal sent by Department of Personnel cannot be
a ground for challenge of the existing rule. It is prayed that the writ petition be dismissed at this
stage as the same is without any merit. [9] Ms. O. Momota Devi, learned counsel for the MPSC also
adopts the submissions of learned G.A. and states that there is no basis for challenging the
sub-quota of 50:50 out of 60% promotion quota and prays that the writ petition be dismissed.
Page 8 [10] We have heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties, perused the materials on
record and considered the relevant law. [11] The main ground for challenge in the writ petition is for
quashing Column 10 of MPSC Form-8 of providing sub-quota of 50:50 between the Degree Holder
SO-I and Diploma Holder SO-I in the 60% promotion quota from the SO-I for promotion to AE. The
only ground pleaded in the writ petition is that at present out of the 152 SO, 120 are Degree Holders
and 32 are Diploma Holders. Hence, 50:50 sub-quota is irrational and it is loaded against the
Degree Holder Section Officers. Another ground is that Department of Personnel Affairs have
proposed 80% promotion quota from SO to AE and 20% for direct recruit. 80% promotion quota
will be considered on the basis of the common seniority list and no sub-quota (as 50:50 in the
present case) is not proposed.
[12] This Court is of the opinion that this 50:50 sub-quota out of 60% promotional quota to A.E. has
been adopted and has been prevailing in all Engineering Departments such as PWD, IFCD and
PHED in the state of Manipur and the Rule is framed under Article 309 of the constitution of India.
In the exigency of service, the percentage of the degree holders and diploma holders S.O. Grade-I
may vary from time to time. Larger proportion of degree holders at a particular time cannot be a
ground for challenge of the recruitment rules providing the sub-quota of 50:50 unless the
petitioners have shown that the sub-quota of 50:50 violates the principles of equality as enshrined
in Article 14 of the Constitution. It is settled proposition of law that Page 9 there can be classification
and such classification should be reasonable and the object behind the classification shall have an
intelligible criteria [kindly see D.S. Nakara Vs. UOI: (1983) 1 SCC 305]. The existing rule cannot be
challenged on the basis of proposed rule in absence of any discriminatory provisions in the
distribution of sub-quota of 50:50 in the existing rule in Column 10 of the MPSC Form - 8 for
promotion to the AE. If the plea of the petitioners are accepted, the diploma holders can also
challenge the sub quota 50:50 rules if the numbers of diploma holder increases subsistently in a
particular period. The number of existing incumbents of degree holders vis a vis diploma holders
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/104033097/ 6
Arunkumar Singh Ashem vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 12 September, 2023
cannot be a ground for setting aside the Recruitment Rules of providing equitable distribution of
50:50 sub quota in the 60% promotional quota from the post of SO to the post of AE. [13] We don't
find any merit in the plea of the petitioners. Accordingly, the writ petition is dismissed at the
admission stage.
[14] No costs.
