Vivek Sehgal And Another vs State Of U.P. And 2 Others on 1 May, 2025
2. The prayer made in the instant petition is for issuing a writ of mandamus directing the
respondents to properly compute one time lease rent as per the stipulations in sub-lease deed dated
06.10.2016 and for a further direction to the respondents to act as per the law.
3. According to the petitioners the sublease gave option to the petitioners to deposit lease rent
equivalent to 11 years in lump sum within ten years, at the prevalent rate and in which event no
further annual lease rent would be payable. The petitioners have exercised the option within ten
years, but the computation provided to them is erroneous.
4. Sri Shivam Yadav, learned counsel appearing for the respondent Authority points out that the
petitioner vide notice dated 06.01.2025 has already requested the State Government to decide the
representation filed in this regard by the petitioners under Section 41(3) of U.P.Urban Planning and
Development Act, 1973 (in short the 'Act') expeditiously and restrain the Authority from charging
interest on the amount computed as lease rent in contravention of the specific stipulations in the
sub-lease deed.
5. As it is not disputed before us that the representation of the petitioners under Section 41(3) of the
Act is pending consideration before the State Government, therefore, at this stage, we decline to
examine the issue and dispose of the instant petition with direction to respondent no.1 to take
decision on the representation of the petitioners dated 20.02.2024 within eight weeks from the date
of communication of the instant order. The demand of lease rent would abide by the decision that
would be taken by the respondent no.1 on the representation of the petitioners.
Order Date :- 1.5.2025 Ashish Pd.
