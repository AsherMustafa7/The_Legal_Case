Amar Singh vs State Of U.P. Thru. Addl. Chief ... on 2 January, 2025
against the judgment of the learned Single Judge. The appeal was allowed solely on the ground of
territorial jurisdiction, resulting in the setting aside of the learned Single Judge's judgment dated
21st August 2023. Consequently, the petitioner was granted liberty to file a writ petition before the
Lucknow Bench of this Court. Pursuant to this liberty, the present writ petition has been filed
challenging the termination order dated 7th September 2020 passed by respondent no. 2.
3. The petitioner, who was serving as Additional Private Secretary in the State Secretariat of Uttar
Pradesh, has sought the issuance of a writ of certiorari to quash the order dated 7th September
2020, passed by respondent no. 2, terminating his services.
4. The facts of the case, in brief, are as follows: The petitioner, acting as an administrator of a
WhatsApp group linked to his mobile number 9454410505, allegedly received a message on July 6,
2018, stating:

"As per UGC regulations, opportunities for the OBC and Scheduled Caste
communities have effectively been closed. In this era of Ramrajya, Chief Minister
Thakur Ajay Singh Yogi and Deputy Chief Minister Pandit Dinesh Sharma, while
purportedly eradicating casteism, have appointed 52 individuals from their own caste
as Assistant Professors out of a total of 71 positions in Gorakhpur University."
(The above is the English translation of the original text, provided by the Court.)
5. The message was deemed objectionable and critical of the State Government. The petitioner
attempted to delete the message but inadvertently pressed the 'forward' button, resulting in the
message being shared with the WhatsApp group. Upon realizing the error, the petitioner requested
the group members to delete the message. Although no complaint was lodged with the State
Government by any group member, the petitioner voluntarily expressed regret through a letter
addressed to the Chief Secretary of Uttar Pradesh on July 9, 2018, which stated:

"To The Chief Secretary, Government of Uttar Pradesh, Sir, I respectfully submit that
on July 6, 2018, I received an objectionable message on my mobile number
9454410505, which was critical of the government. Considering the message to be
inappropriate, I attempted to delete it. However, due to an inadvertent error, the
message was forwarded to a WhatsApp group instead of being deleted. Subsequently,
I personally requested the group members to delete the message.
The aforementioned act occurred unintentionally, and I sincerely regret the incident.
I assure you of my vigilance in the future.
Dated: July 9, 2018 Yours sincerely, [Signed: Amar Singh-II] Additional Private
Secretary."
6. Based on the petitioner's letter, the State Government initiated a departmental inquiry and issued
a chargesheet on July 24, 2018, containing the following allegations:
(a) The petitioner had forwarded objectionable remarks concerning the Chief
Minister and Deputy Chief Minister using his CUG mobile number 9454410505 on
July 6, 2018.
(b) The objectionable message, being a serious allegation, tarnished the reputation of
the State Government in public perception and undermined its trust. These actions
were in violation of the Uttar Pradesh Government Servant's Conduct Rules, 1956
(hereinafter referred to as "Conduct Rules, 1956").
7. To substantiate these charges, the State Government presented four pieces of evidence, including
provisions under Rules 3, 7, and 9 of the Conduct Rules, 1956, and the forwarded message itself. On
September 6, 2018, the petitioner requested the Inquiry Officer to ascertain whether the forwarded
message had been received and read by any recipient and whether it had caused reputational
damage to the Government. The petitioner sought an opportunity to examine relevant reports to
adequately respond to the charges.
8. On November 12, 2018, the petitioner sent a reminder for his earlier request but, receiving no
response, submitted a detailed reply refuting the charges. He maintained that the forwarding of the
message was accidental and that it had been deleted promptly. He argued that he had no intent to
cause reputational harm to the Government and claimed the second charge to be unfounded.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/104903903/ 3
Amar Singh vs State Of U.P. Thru. Addl. Chief ... on 2 January, 2025
9. On July 29, 2019, the Inquiry Officer informed the petitioner that the Special Secretary had
confirmed via correspondence dated July 19, 2019, that no information regarding the receipt or
reading of the forwarded message by group members was available. Consequently, no witnesses
were available for cross-examination. The petitioner was instructed to appear for oral inquiry and
hearing on July 30, 2019. During this appearance, the petitioner reiterated his plea for leniency and
submitted a written statement. The Inquiry Officer's report, dated August 13, 2019, concluded that
neither of the charges was substantiated. However, the Inquiry Officer noted the petitioner's
admission of forwarding the message.
10. On September 17, 2019, the petitioner was provided with the inquiry report and invited to
submit an explanation, which he furnished on October 4, 2019, denying any intentional wrongdoing.
He emphasized that the message was deleted promptly and that the act of forwarding was purely
accidental.
11. Despite the inquiry findings, the State Government sought further clarification from the Inquiry
Officer regarding the date and time of message deletion and whether the "delete for everyone"
feature had been used.
12. The Inquiry Officer clarified that the petitioner's WhatsApp version at the time only supported
the "delete" option and that the petitioner, not being technologically proficient, had used this
feature.
13. The Inquiry Officer reaffirmed in the final report that no group member had acknowledged
receiving or reading the message, as confirmed by the Secretariat's records. The evidence suggested
that the message was deleted before it could be disseminated further.
14. The State Government, rather than issuing any further order based on the inquiry report,
initially constituted a two-member Technical Committee through its order dated 29th January
2020. The Committee was comprised of Sri Amrit Tripathi, Special Secretary, Secretariat
(Administration), U.P., and Sri Raj Kumar Gupta, Technical Director (NIC) and Technical Advisor,
Technical U.P. Secretariat, Lucknow. The Technical Inquiry Committee was tasked with submitting
a report.
15. The Deputy Secretary, Government of U.P. wrote a letter to the Technical Director, NIC, a
member of the Committee to submit report on four points:
(i). In the matter concerned when the objectionable message was forwarded on 16th
July, 2018 at around 11:26 pm in the night what was the time available within which
the matter could have been deleted;
(ii). At what time the delinquent employee had deleted the message;
(iii). Once the message has been forwarded in the chat group from a mobile then
whether such a person can delete such message for himself or for the entire group;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/104903903/ 4
Amar Singh vs State Of U.P. Thru. Addl. Chief ... on 2 January, 2025
and
(iv). What option was exercised by the petitioner for deleting the message whether
delete for him or delete for everyone.
16. The technical team submitted its report on 6th February 2020, addressing the four points
outlined, stating that the message could have been deleted within one hour, eight minutes, and
sixteen seconds (1 hour 8 minutes 16 seconds) after being forwarded. It was noted that it is the
responsibility of the delinquent employee to specify the exact time when the message was deleted.
Furthermore, a message can be deleted from the handset from which it was sent. In a WhatsApp
group, a message can only be deleted by selecting the 'delete for everyone' option.
17. Upon receipt of the aforementioned report, the respondents proceeded to issue an order on 7th
September 2020, finding the petitioner guilty of serious misconduct for forwarding an objectionable
message against the Government. This was deemed to sufficiently demonstrate indiscipline,
misconduct, and despotism, warranting the imposition of the maximum punishment. As a result,
the order of termination from service was issued.
18. The arguments put forth by the learned counsel for the petitioner are as follows:
(i) The second inquiry conducted by the Technical Committee was conducted in
contravention of the procedure prescribed under the U.P. Government Servant
(Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1999 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Rules, 1999'), as
the petitioner was not provided with a copy of the inquiry report. Therefore, the
respondents were unjustified in relying on the ex parte inquiry report.
(ii) The petitioner was not made aware of the proposed inquiry by the two-member
Committee under the State Government's order dated 29th January 2020. No copy of
the order was provided to the petitioner, nor was the petitioner afforded the
opportunity to participate in the inquiry, as no notice was issued to him by the
Technical Committee. Consequently, the principles of natural justice were completely
violated, rendering the impugned order unsustainable on this ground alone.
(iii) The serious charges of misconduct, specifically the circulation of an objectionable
message with the deliberate intention to harm the prestige and respect of the State
Government, were found not to be substantiated by the Inquiry Officer due to
insufficient evidence. The mere allegation that the petitioner forwarded the message
from his mobile number was not grave enough to warrant the maximum penalty of
termination from service. Therefore, the argument is that the punishment is
disproportionate to the charge proved.
19. To support the above arguments, learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted the following
documents before this Court: the Inquiry Officer's report dated 13th August 2019 (Annexure-11 to
the writ petition), the clarification sought from the Inquiry Officer by the State Government via
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/104903903/ 5
Amar Singh vs State Of U.P. Thru. Addl. Chief ... on 2 January, 2025
letter dated 18th November 2019 (Annexure-13 to the writ petition), the Inquiry Officer's reply
dated 16th December 2019 (Annexure-14 to the writ petition), the inquiry correspondence with the
petitioner and his response under letter dated 2nd December 2019 and 12th December 2019 (part of
Annexure-14 to the writ petition), the letter dated 29th January 2020 (Annexure-15 to the writ
petition) by the Deputy Secretary of the Government of U.P. constituting the two-member Technical
Inquiry Committee, a letter dated 5th February 2020 from the State Secretariat requesting a report
on four points, and the Technical Advisor's reply dated 6th July 2020 (Annexure-16 to the writ
petition).
20. Learned counsel for the petitioner has relied upon the judgment of England and Wales Court of
Appeal (Civil Division) in the case of Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd. v. Wednesbury
Corporation: (1947) 2 All ER 680, judgment of Supreme Court in the case of Union of India and
others v. J. Ahmed: (1979) 2 SCC 286, Ram Kishan v. Union of India and others: (1995) 6 SCC 157,
Gohil Vishvaraj Hanubhai and others v. State of Gujarat and others: (2017) 13 SCC 621, judgment of
Allahabad High Court in the case of Pushpak Jyoti v. State of U.P. and others: (2004) 1 UPLBEC
547, Deen Dayal Shukla v. State of U.P. and others: 2005 (3) ESC 1814 (All) & Kisan Sahkari Chini
Mills Ltd. and others v. Presiding Officer, Labour Court, Lucknow and others: 2019 (8) ADJ 92.
21. In response to the submissions made by the learned counsel for the petitioner, the learned
Standing Counsel representing the State argued that an admission is the most reliable piece of
evidence. Since the petitioner himself admitted to forwarding the objectionable message to the
WhatsApp group, in his capacity as the group administrator, no further evidence was required to
prove whether the message was circulated. He further contended that even if a message was deleted
within the group, the petitioner failed to prove that the message was deleted for all group members
or that they had not seen it. Thus, a presumption arises that the petitioner circulated the message
and, as a result, caused damage to the prestige and respect of the Government.
22. On the matter of the constitution of the Technical Committee and the subsequent clarification
sought from the Inquiry Officer who had submitted the inquiry report, the learned Standing Counsel
asserted that it is within the discretion of the disciplinary authority to disagree with the Inquiry
Officer's findings or to seek clarifications on specific points. He emphasized that the Technical
Committee's report did not necessitate further clarification or involvement of the petitioner. The
report primarily supported the findings of the Inquiry Officer concerning charge No. 1, specifically
that the petitioner had forwarded the message. The technical issue was whether the petitioner had
deleted the message and, if so, whether it was deleted for himself or for all members of the
WhatsApp group.
23. The learned Standing Counsel sought to justify the termination order based on the reasons
provided therein and submitted that the order of termination does not disqualify the petitioner from
seeking future employment elsewhere. He further submitted that this Court should not sit in appeal
over the findings of the Inquiry Officer or the decision made by the disciplinary authority, except in
the event that the Court concludes that the procedure followed was in violation of the prescribed
service rules.

24. Learned Standing Counsel has relied upon the judgment of Supreme Court in the case of Union
of India v. Sardar Bahadur: (1972) 4 SCC 618, Narinder Mohan Arya v. United India Insurance
Company Ltd. and others: AIR 2006 SC 1748, Government of India and another v. George Philip:
AIR 2007 SC 705, Deputy Commissioner, KVS and others v. J. Hussain: (2013) 10 SCC 106, State of
Karnataka v. N. Gangaraj: (2020) 3 SCC 423, Muzaffar Husain v. State of U.P. and others: AIR 2022
SC 2216, Managing Director, ECIL, Hyderabad and others v. B. Karunakar and others, (1993) 4 SCC
727.
25. After hearing the learned counsel for the respective parties and considering the arguments
presented, along with a thorough review of the record and the cited authorities, I find that two key
issues arise for determination before this Court:
(a) Whether the procedure adopted for conducting the inquiry by constituting a
technical team was inconsistent with the regular inquiry process as prescribed under
the Rules, 1999, and, as such, whether holding such an inquiry was contrary to the
procedure established therein; and
(b) Whether the punishment imposed upon the petitioner is disproportionate to the
misconduct that was proven.
26. Coming to the first issue, it is necessary to go through the procedure prescribed under the Rules,
1999. Rule 7 of Rules, 1999 contemplate regular inquiry for the purposes of major penalty including
the penalty of dismissal/ termination from service. Rule 7 of Rules, 1999 is reproduced hereunder:
"7. Procedure for imposing major penalties. - Before imposing any major penalty on a
Government servant, an inquiry shall be held in the following manner:
(i) The disciplinary authority may himself inquire into the charges or appoint an
authority subordinate to him as Inquiry Officer to inquire into the charges.
(ii) The facts constituting the misconduct on which it is proposed to take action shall
be reduced in the form of definite charge or charges to be called charge-sheet. The
charge-sheet shall be approved by the disciplinary authority:
Provided that where the appointing authority is Governor, the charge- sheet may be
approved by the Principal Secretary or the Secretary; as the case may be, of the
concerned department.
(iii) The charges framed shall be so precise and clear as to give sufficient indication to
the charged Government servant of the facts and circumstances against him. The
proposed documentary evidence and the name of the witnesses proposed to prove the
same alongwith oral evidence, if any, shall be mentioned in the charge-sheet.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/104903903/ 7
Amar Singh vs State Of U.P. Thru. Addl. Chief ... on 2 January, 2025
(iv) The charged Government servant shall be required to put in a written statement
of his defence in person on a specified date which shall not be less than 15 days from
the date of issue of charge-sheet and to state whether he desires to cross-examine any
witness mentioned in the charge-sheet and whether desires to give or produce
evidence in his defence. He shall also be in- formed that in case he does not appear or
file the written statement on the specified date, it will be presumed that he has none
to furnish and Inquiry Officer shall proceed to complete the inquiry ex parte.
(v) The charge-sheet, alongwith the copy of the documentary evidences mentioned
therein and list of witnesses and their statements, if any shall be served on the
charged Government servant personally or by registered post at the address
mentioned in the official records. In case the charge-sheet could not be served in
aforesaid manner, the charge-sheet shall be served by publication in a daily
newspaper having wide circulation:
Provided that where the documentary evidence is voluminous, instead of furnishing
its copy with charge-sheet, the charged Government servant shall be permitted to
inspect the same before the Inquiry Officer.
(vi) Where the charged Government servant appears and admits the charges, the
Inquiry Officer shall submit his report to the disciplinary authority on the basis of
such admission.
(vii) Where the charged Government servant denies the charges, the Inquiry Officer
shall proceed to call the witnesses proposed in the charge-sheet and record their oral
evidence in presence of the charged Government servant who shall be given
opportunity to cross-examine such witnesses. After recording the aforesaid evidence,
the Inquiry Officer shall call and record the oral evidence which the charged
Government servant desired in his written statement to be produced in his defence:
Provided that the Inquiry Officer may for reasons to be recorded in writing refuse to
call a witness.
(viii) The Inquiry Officer may summon any witness to give evidence or require any
person to produce documents before him in accordance with the provisions of the
Uttar Pradesh Departmental Inquiries (Enforcement of Attendance of Witnesses and
Production of Documents) Act, 1976.
(ix) The Inquiry Officer may ask any question he pleases, at any time of any witness
or from person charged with a view to dis- cover the truth or to obtain proper proof of
facts relevant to charges.
(x) Where the charged Government servant does not appear on the date fixed in the
inquiry or at any stage of the proceeding in- spite of the service of the notice on him
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/104903903/ 8
Amar Singh vs State Of U.P. Thru. Addl. Chief ... on 2 January, 2025
or having knowledge of the date, the Inquiry Officer shall proceed with the inquiry ex
parte. In such a case the Inquiry Officer shall record the statement of witnesses
mentioned in the charge-sheet in absence of the charged Government servant.
(xi) The disciplinary authority, if it considers it necessary to do so, may, by an order
appoint a Government servant or a legal practitioner, to be known as "Presenting
Officer" to present on its behalf the case in support of the charge.
(xii) The Government servant may take the assistance of any other Government
servant to present the case on his behalf but not engage a legal practitioner for the
purpose unless the Presenting Officer appointed by the disciplinary authority is a
legal practitioner of the disciplinary authority having regard to the circumstances of
the case so permits:
Provided that this rule shall not apply in following cases:
(i) Where any major penalty is imposed on a person on the ground of conduct which
has led to his conviction on a criminal charge; or
(ii) Where the disciplinary authority is satisfied that for reason to be recorded by it in
writing, that it is not reasonably practicable to hold an inquiry in the manner
provided in these rules; or
(iii) Where the Governor is satisfied that, in the interest of the security of the State, it
is not expedient to hold an manner provided in these rules."
27. A plain reading of the aforementioned rules clearly indicates that a chargesheet containing
specific charges, approved by the disciplinary authority, must be served upon the delinquent
employee. Subsequently, the charged government servant is to be given an opportunity to submit a
reply. An inquiry shall be conducted by the Inquiry Officer if the government servant denies the
charges. The Inquiry Officer is required to record the oral evidence of the witnesses named in the
chargesheet in the presence of the charged government servant, who is entitled to cross-examine the
witnesses. The Inquiry Officer must also consider and record the oral evidence of any witnesses the
charged government servant wishes to present in his defense, as outlined in his written statement.
Furthermore, the Inquiry Officer is empowered to summon witnesses and demand the production of
documents, as necessary, under the provisions of the U.P. Departmental Inquiries (Enforcement of
Attendance of Witnesses and Production of Documents) Act, 1976. After the completion of the
inquiry, including the recording of evidence, reviewing the documents, and hearing the testimonies
of both departmental and defense witnesses, the disciplinary authority shall prepare the final report.
28. After the inquiry report is submitted as per Rule 9 of Rules, 1999, the disciplinary authority shall
proceed to take action on the report. For its better appreciation Rule 9 is reproduced hereunder:
"9. Action on Inquiry Report.-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/104903903/ 9
Amar Singh vs State Of U.P. Thru. Addl. Chief ... on 2 January, 2025
(1) The disciplinary authority may, for reasons to be recorded in writing, remit the
case for re-inquiry to the same or any other Inquiry Officer under intimation to the
charged Government servant. The Inquiry Officer shall thereupon proceed to hold
the inquiry from such stage as directed by the disciplinary authority, according to the
provisions of Rule 7.
(2) The disciplinary authority shall, if it disagrees with the findings of the Inquiry
Officer on any charge, record its own findings thereon for reasons to be recorded.
(3) In case the charges are not proved, the charged Government servant shall be
exonerated by the disciplinary authority of the charges and inform him accordingly;
1. (4) If the disciplinary authority having regard to its findings on all or any of charges is of the
opinion that any penalty specified in Rule 3 should be imposed on the charged Government servant,
he shall give a copy of the inquiry report and his findings recorded under sub-rule (2) to the charged
Government servant and require him to submit his representation if he so desires, within a
reasonable specified time. The disciplinary authority shall, having regard to all the relevant records
relating to the inquiry and representation of the charged Government servant, if any, and subject to
the provisions of Rule 16 of these rules, pass a reasoned order imposing one or more penalties
mentioned in Rule 3 of these rules and communicate the same to the charged Government servant."
(Emphasis added)
29. A plain reading of Rule 9(1) makes it clear that the disciplinary authority, for reasons to be
recorded in writing, has the discretion to remit the case for re-inquiry, either by the same Inquiry
Officer or by a different one, with due intimation to the charged government servant. The Inquiry
Officer shall then proceed to continue the inquiry from the stage directed by the disciplinary
authority. Sub-rule 2 of Rule 9 allows the disciplinary authority to disagree with the findings of the
Inquiry Officer on any charge and to record its own findings, with reasons. Sub-rule 3 of Rule 9
provides that if the charges are not proven, the charged government servant shall be exonerated by
the disciplinary authority, which shall inform the government servant accordingly. Sub-rule 4 of
Rule 9 stipulates that if the disciplinary authority concludes that a penalty as proposed under Rule 3
of the Rules, 1999 is warranted, it must provide the charged government servant with a copy of the
inquiry report and its findings, recorded under sub-rule (4), and allow the government servant a
specified time to submit a representation before proceeding to impose the punishment as prescribed
under Rule 3.
30. From the discussions as made above qua Rule 7, 8 & 9 three stages are clearly postulated under
the Rules:
(i). Setting up a regular inquiry in the event of major penalty with the issuance of
chargesheet and appointment of Inquiry Officer and issuance of an approved
chargesheet by the disciplinary authority calling for reply;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/104903903/ 10
Amar Singh vs State Of U.P. Thru. Addl. Chief ... on 2 January, 2025
(ii) Disciplinary Inquiry Officer is to hold inquiry in detail both oral as well as
requiring documentary evidence and then to submit report;
(iii) With the submission of report it is open for the disciplinary authority to order
inquiry de novo, or disagree with the Inquiry Officer for the reason on the findings by
assigning reasons and in the event decides to propose major penalty under Rule 3,
shall cause service to the inquiry report or his decision of the proposed punishment
upon the delinquent employee requiring his representation within specified period;
and then if charges are not proved, charged Government servant shall be exonerated
by disciplinary authority.
31. Upon reviewing the inquiry report in the present case, I find that the Inquiry Officer concluded
that Charge No. 1, relating to the circulation of an objectionable message criticizing the Government
as per Rule 9 of the Rules, 1956, was not proven. Since the intention to circulate the objectionable
message--amounting to criticism of the Government via unauthorized communication--was not
substantiated, the act and conduct of the petitioner, which was alleged to be misconduct for failing
to maintain disciplined behavior as required under Rules 3 and 7 of the Rules, 1956, was also not
established. The Inquiry Officer, however, found that the charge of forwarding the message in
question in the WhatsApp group was proven, based solely on the petitioner's admission.
32. Notably, the department had no witnesses to present before the Inquiry Officer to provide oral
testimony, nor did it have any documentary evidence to demonstrate that the objectionable message
was circulated within the WhatsApp group or that the members of the group had read or otherwise
disseminated it.
33. Upon receipt of the inquiry report, the disciplinary authority sought to verify the petitioner's
defense, which claimed that although he intended to delete the message, he inadvertently forwarded
it and later deleted it. To clarify this, the disciplinary authority made certain inquiries of the Inquiry
Officer via a letter dated 18th November 2019. In turn, on 26th November 2019, the Inquiry Officer
posed further queries to the petitioner, to which the petitioner responded on 2nd and 12th
December 2019. The Inquiry Officer subsequently submitted a supplementary report on 16th
December 2019. This report reiterated that, according to the petitioner's statement, he was using an
older version of WhatsApp, where only a 'delete' option was available, which the petitioner had
pressed. Despite requests for supporting evidence, the department failed to provide any proof that
the message was indeed deleted.
34. The supplementary report also referenced a letter from the Inquiry Officer to the petitioner on
29th July 2019 during the inquiry, which stated that despite contacting the office of the Chief
Minister regarding the availability of any evidence supporting the charge, the response received on
9th July 2019 indicated that no such documents existed. After submission of the supplementary
report--although not explicitly labeled as a "supplementary" report--the disciplinary authority
decided to form a new two-member 'Technical Committee' to seek clarification on four points.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/104903903/ 11
Amar Singh vs State Of U.P. Thru. Addl. Chief ... on 2 January, 2025
35. The letters dated 29th January 2020 and 5th February 2020 from the Deputy Secretary do not
reflect any disagreement with the findings of the Inquiry Officer, who had exonerated the petitioner
of two charges. Instead, the only clarification sought was whether the message was deleted in time.
The Technical Committee's report, however, indicated that it was only the delinquent employee who
could clarify whether the message had been deleted for everyone or not, or if the message was
deleted at all.
36. The formation of the inquiry committee without showing any disagreement with the Inquiry
Officer's specific findings--which had exonerated the petitioner on the charges--was not in line with
Rule 9(2) of the Rules, 1999. The defense argument presented by the learned Standing Counsel,
suggesting that the formation of the Technical Committee was merely for clarification purposes,
cannot be accepted. This is because the disciplinary authority had already sought clarification from
the Inquiry Officer in its letter dated 18th November 2019, which was sufficient. The Inquiry Officer
had submitted a supplementary report on 16th December 2019, containing the petitioner's
statement about the deletion of the message. In the absence of any disagreement with this report,
the decision to form a Technical Committee to further investigate the matter was entirely
unnecessary.
37. This administrative action is contrary to the authority vested in the disciplinary authority, as per
Rule 9(2) of the Rules, 1999. There is no provision in the Rules for conducting a second inquiry de
novo by appointing a new Inquiry Officer. Therefore, the petitioner's argument that the second
inquiry, which can be termed as a 'Technical Inquiry Committee,' was conducted in violation of the
prescribed procedure is valid. Moreover, the show cause notice issued to the petitioner on 17th
November 2019, which requested a representation, did not mention any proposed punishment other
than acknowledging that the petitioner had forwarded the objectionable message. Only after the
petitioner submitted his reply did the disciplinary authority seek a supplementary inquiry report.
Hence, in these circumstances, the second technical inquiry conducted under the letter dated 29th
January 2020 should have involved the petitioner's participation, but he was not notified of this
inquiry.
38. Paragraph 42 of the inquiry report explicitly states that the technical inquiry was conducted ex
parte. In response to this, paragraph 42 of the counter affidavit remarks that "it need no comments,
being a matter of record, and can be verified from the same."
39. Therefore, it is evident that the inquiry was conducted in gross violation of the principles of
natural justice. The respondents' admission that the procedure adopted was contrary to the
prescribed rules renders the action arbitrary and illegal, making the resultant decision void. When a
process is required to be followed in a particular manner, it must be adhered to. (Taylor v. Taylor
(L.R.) 1 Ch. 426).
40. The above principle is grounded in the legal maxim "Expressio unius est exclusio alterius,"
which implies that when a statute prescribes a specific method for performing an act, that method
must be strictly followed, and no other course of action is permissible. This maxim has been
consistently upheld in various decisions, such as in Chandra Kishore Jha v. Mahavir Prasad (1999),
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/104903903/ 12
Amar Singh vs State Of U.P. Thru. Addl. Chief ... on 2 January, 2025
Haresh Dayaram Thakur v. State of Maharashtra (2000), Delhi Administration v. Gurdip Singh
Uban (2000), Dhanajaya Reddy v. State of Karnataka (2001), Commissioner of Income Tax,
Mumbai v. Anjum M.H. Ghaswala (2002), Prabha Shankar Dubey v. State of Madhya Pradesh
(2004), and Ram Phal Kundu v. Kamal Sharma (2004).
41. The Supreme Court, in Sirsi Municipality v. Cecelia Kom Francis Tellis (1973), affirmed that
"rules and regulations are binding on the authorities," and in Sukhdev Singh v. Bhagatram Sardar
Singh Raghuvanshi (1975), it stated that "statutory authorities cannot deviate from the conditions of
service." Such deviations would be invalidated by the courts. In Krishna Rai v. Banaras Hindu
University (2022), the Court reiterated the principle that "if the law requires something to be done
in a particular manner, then it must be done in that manner, and if it is not done, it would have no
legal existence."
42. The first argument put forth by the petitioner's counsel is thus valid, and the impugned order
should be quashed on this basis alone.
43. Regarding the second argument about the disproportionate punishment, it is clear that the only
evidence against the petitioner is his own admission in writing to the Government and during the
inquiry that he had forwarded the message in the WhatsApp group by mistake and deleted it once he
realized his error. There was no substantial evidence from the State Government presented before
the Inquiry Officer or the Technical Committee to support the claim that the petitioner intentionally
circulated the message to damage the Government's reputation.
44. Both the inquiry and technical committee reports indicate that the petitioner deleted the
message. Since the department failed to provide evidence that the message was read or circulated
widely among people, it is speculative to conclude that the circulation caused harm to the
Government's reputation.
45. In J. Ahmed (supra), the Supreme Court emphasized the importance of distinguishing between
intentional misconduct and acts of negligence or innocent mistakes. The Court ruled that acts of
negligence or errors in judgment do not amount to misconduct. This principle is applicable in the
petitioner's case, as there is no evidence of malice or ill intent behind the act of forwarding the
message.
46. In misconduct cases, it must first be determined whether the action was deliberate and whether
it was serious enough to warrant severe punishment. The disciplinary authority's decision to
terminate the petitioner's service was based on the report of the Inquiry Officer and the Technical
Committee, which found that the petitioner forwarded the message but did not establish that he did
so deliberately with the intent to damage the Government's reputation. The disciplinary authority
assumed that since the petitioner deleted the message after realizing the severity of his action, this
constituted an act of misconduct.
47. However, this finding of the disciplinary authority is flawed due to a lack of evidence. The
message was forwarded at 11:26 PM on 6th July 2018 and was allegedly deleted within 2-3 minutes.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/104903903/ 13
Amar Singh vs State Of U.P. Thru. Addl. Chief ... on 2 January, 2025
Given the timing, there was no opportunity for the message to be read by everyone in the WhatsApp
group, let alone be circulated to other groups. In fact, the Government only became aware of the
message after the petitioner expressed his regret. Therefore, the disciplinary authority's conclusions
are based on insufficient material and are liable to be considered perverse.
48. The disciplinary authority's finding would have been valid had the department presented
evidence showing that the message was read by other members of the WhatsApp group and
circulated further. However, no such evidence was provided, and the department did not investigate
mobile phone records or call/message logs that could have corroborated the circulation of the
message.
49. Given the lack of evidence, it is unreasonable to impose the maximum penalty of termination
from service when no charge has been definitively proven.
50. Therefore, based on the lack of substantial evidence and the improper procedure followed, it is
clear that the imposition of termination from service is unjustified.
51. In the case of Ram Kishan (supra) the Court dealt with an issue of nature of punishment imposed
and whether it was commensurate to the gravity of the charge or too harsh to be approved of. Vide
paragraphs 11 and 12 the Court has observed thus:
"11. It is next to be seen whether imposition of the punishment of dismissal from
service is proportionate to the gravity of the imputation. When abusive language is
used by anybody against a superior, it must be understood in the environment in
which that person is situated and the circumstances surrounding the event that led to
the use of the abusive language. No staight jacket formula could be evolved in
adjudging whether the abusive language in the given circumstances would warrant
dismissal from service. Each case has to be considered on its own facts. What was the
nature of the abusive language used by the appellant was not stated.
12. On the facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the considered view that the
imposition of punishment of dismissal from service is harsh and disproportionate to
the gravity of charge imputed to the delinquent constable. Accordingly, we set aside
the dismissal order. We hold that imposition of stoppage of two increments with
cumulative effect would be an appropriate punishment. So, we direct the disciplinary
authority to impose that punishment. However, since the appellant himself is
responsible for the initiation of the proceedings, we find that he is not entitled to
back wages; but, all other consequential benefits would be available to him."
52. The petitioner's admission that he inadvertently forwarded the message is a significant factor. In
my opinion, the punishment should have been more lenient, such as an adverse entry in his service
records or a censure. As a government servant, he should have exercised caution when dealing with
such objectionable content, but his actions were not malicious. A more proportionate response
would have been appropriate given the circumstances.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/104903903/ 14
Amar Singh vs State Of U.P. Thru. Addl. Chief ... on 2 January, 2025
53. The petitioner further raised an important point in paragraph 67 of his petition, claiming that
the proposed punishment, as considered by the U.P. Public Service Commission, was contrary to the
findings, and the State Government failed to provide him with a copy of this proposed punishment
for his comments. This omission deprived the petitioner of the opportunity to contest the proposed
action.
54. In response, the respondents argued that a detailed reply had already been provided in the
counter affidavit, but upon review, I find that no such reply was specifically addressed to paragraph
67 of the petition. This omission is significant as the petitioner's claim regarding lack of opportunity
to contest the proposed punishment remains unaddressed.
55. Another point raised by the petitioner pertains to a similar case involving Jagdish Prasad Yadav,
a Commercial Inspector, who faced disciplinary action for comments made about the Chief Minister
on social media. The suspension was overturned by the Lucknow Bench of the High Court, and
disciplinary proceedings were dropped with only a warning issued to Yadav. The petitioner argues
that this situation is discriminatory, as similar actions were treated differently in his case. While the
two cases are not identical, it is worth noting that, like the petitioner, Yadav's misconduct was not
proven by any substantial evidence but rather was based on his own admission. Thus, the
punishment in the petitioner's case appears disproportionate to the actual charge.
56. While the cases are not identical, the similarities are worth noting, especially given that in both
instances, the misconduct was not proven beyond the individuals' own admissions. The fact that the
petitioner's conduct was addressed by him voluntarily, with regret, further highlights that a more
lenient punishment could have been appropriate, rather than termination.
57. The discretion to impose punishment lies with the employer, but this discretion must be
exercised with care and in line with established principles. The judicial review of such decisions is
based on three grounds: illegality, irrationality, and procedural impropriety, as articulated in the
case of Indian Railway Company Ltd. v. Ajay Kumar (2003). The Supreme Court also referred to
Lord Diplock's observations in Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service
(1984), where "irrationality" or "Wednesbury unreasonableness" is described as a decision so
outrageous that no reasonable person could have arrived at it. In this case, the termination of the
petitioner's service appears disproportionate and unreasonable, failing to align with logical
standards of fairness.
58. On the question of proportionality of punishment as to the charge in the case of Deen Dayal
Shukla (supra) a coordinate Bench of this Court referred to the judgment of Supreme Court in the
case of State Bank of India and others v. Samarendra Kishore Endow and another: (1994) ILLJ 872
SC, wherein it was held that punishment awarded to an employee should be commensurate with an
offence and, therefore, while exercising power under Article 226 of the Constitution, the High Court
will ensure that an individual receives fair treatment. Vide paragraph 16 the Court has held thus:
"16. In the case of State Bank of India and others v. Samarendra Kishore Endwo and
another (supra) it has been held by Hon'ble Supreme Court that the punishment
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/104903903/ 15
Amar Singh vs State Of U.P. Thru. Addl. Chief ... on 2 January, 2025
awarded to an employee should be commensurate with the offence and accordingly
held while exercising power under Article 226 of the Constitution of India High Court
have to ensure that individual receives fair treatment and not to ensure that authority
after according fair treatment reaches on a matter which it is authorised by law to
decide for itself. Relevant portion from the said judgment is reproduced as under :
"10. On the question of punishment, learned Counsel for the respondents submitted
that the punishment awarded is excessive and that lesser punishment would meet the
ends of justice. It may be noticed that the imposition of appropriate punishment is
within the discretion and judgment of the. disciplinary authority. It may be open to
the appellate authority to interfere with it but not to the High Court or to the
Administrative Tribunal for the reason that the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is similar
to the powers of the High Court under Article 226. The power under Article 226 is
one of judicial review. It "is not an appeal from a decision, but a review of the manner
in which the decision was made." [Per Lord Brightman in Chief Constable of the
North Wales Police v. Evans and H.B. Gandhi Excise and Taxation
Officer-cum-Assessing Authority v. Gopinath and Sons]. In other words the power of
judicial review is meant to ensure that the individual receives fair treatment and not
to ensure that the authority after according fair treatment, reaches on a matter which
it is authorised by law to decide for itself, a conclusion which is correct in the eyes of
the Court."
Hon'ble Supreme Court after considering the other judgments of Apex Court arrived to the
conclusion that punishment awarded to the delinquent employee was too harsh and remitted the
matter again to disciplinary authority to reconsider for imposition of appropriate punishment."
59. The Court also referred to the various authorities on the principle of applying Wednesbury test
to an administrative order vide paragraph 67 thus:
"67. But where as administrative action is challenged as "arbitrary" under Article 14
on the basis of Royappa (as in cases where punishments in disciplinary cases are
challenged), the question will be whether the administrative order is "rational" or
"reasonable" and the test then is the Wednesbury test. The Courts would then be
confined only to a secondary role and will only have to see whether the administrator
has done well in his primary role, whether he has acted illegally or has omitted
relevant factors from consideration or has taken irrelevant factors into consideration
or whether his view is one which a reasonable person could have taken. If his action
does not satisfy these rules, it is to be treated as arbitrary. In G.B. Mahajan v. Jalqaon
Municipal Council, SCC at p. 111. Venkatachaliah, J. (as he then was) pointed out that
"reasonableness" of the administrator under Article 14 in the context of
administrative law has to be judged from the stand point of Wednesbury rules. In
Tata Cellular v. Union of India, SCC at pp. 679-80; Indian Express Newspapers
Bombay (P) Ltd. v. Union of India, SCC at p. 6910 ; Supreme Court Employees'
Welfare Assn. v. Union of India, SCC at p. 2410 and U.P. Financial Corporation v.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/104903903/ 16
Amar Singh vs State Of U.P. Thru. Addl. Chief ... on 2 January, 2025
Gem Cap (India; (P) Ltd., SCC at p. 307, while judging whether the administrative
action is "arbitrary" under Article 14 (i.e. otherwise than being discriminatory), this
Court has confined itself to a Wednesbury review always.
60. The petitioner's counsel also referred to the Supreme Court judgment in Mithilesh Singh v.
Union of India (2003) 2 SCR 377, where the Court held that it would intervene if the punishment is
shockingly disproportionate to the gravity of the offense. The principle established in this case
emphasizes that punishment must not be excessively harsh relative to the proven misconduct. This
judgment is cited here to argue that the punishment in this case--termination--is shockingly
disproportionate to the admitted guilt of the petitioner.
61. The petitioner also referred to the case of Kisan Sahkari Chini Mills (supra), where the Court
observed that while the quantum of punishment is generally within the discretion of the employer,
the Court would interfere when the penalty is found to be shockingly disproportionate. The principle
from this case aligns with the petitioner's argument that the punishment here is excessive
considering the nature and circumstances of the alleged misconduct.
62. On the other hand, the Standing Counsel, Sri Neeraj Tripathi, relied on several judgments,
including Rajendra Upadhyay v. State of U.P. and others (Writ - A No. 30927 of 2009), decided on
9th May 2018. In this case, the Court refused to interfere with the order of punishment, relying on
the judgments in Narinder Mohan Arya and George Philip. In Narinder Mohan Arya (supra), the
Supreme Court held that the High Court should not interfere with the findings of fact made by the
disciplinary authority or the appellate authority. These authorities are empowered to determine the
facts, and the High Court, acting as a judicial review body, cannot act as an appellate forum to
reassess the findings of fact.
63. This legal position emphasizes that while the High Court has the power to review procedural
fairness and the proportionality of punishment, it generally does not reassess factual findings made
by disciplinary authorities unless there is a clear miscarriage of justice or an error of law.
64. Paragraph 9 of the George Philip's case (supra) has been cited to demonstrate that the Court
would normally be not intending to interfere in the matters of domestic inquiry and resultant
punishment if awarded holding that it was the sole domain of administrative authority as an
primary authority to decide as to the nature of punishment to be awarded. Paragraph 9 of the
judgment is reproduced hereunder:
"9. It is trite that the Tribunal or the High Court exercising jurisdiction under Article
226 of the Constitution are not hearing an appeal against the decision of the
disciplinary authority imposing punishment upon the delinquent employee. The
jurisdiction exercised by the Tribunal or the High Court is a limited one and while
exercising the power of judicial review, they cannot set aside the punishment
altogether or impose some other penalty unless they find that there has been a
substantial noncompliance of the rules of procedure or a gross violation of rules of
natural justice which has caused prejudice to the employee and has resulted in

miscarriage of justice or the punishment is shockingly disproportionate to the
gravamen of the charge. The scope of judicial review in matters relating to
disciplinary action against employees has been settled by a catena of decisions of this
Court and reference to only some of them will suffice. In B.C. Chaturvedi v. Union of
India (1995) 6 SCC 749, it was observed as under in para 18 of the reports :-
"18. A review of the above legal position would establish that the disciplinary
authority, and on appeal the appellate authority, being fact-finding authorities have
exclusive power to consider the evidence with a view to maintain discipline. They are
invested with the discretion to impose appropriate punishment keeping in view the
magnitude or gravity of the misconduct. The High Court/Tribunal, while exercising
the power of judicial review, cannot normally substitute its own conclusion on
penalty and impose some other penalty. If the punishment imposed by the
disciplinary authority or the appellate authority shocks the conscience of the High
Court/Tribunal, it would appropriately mould the relief, either directing the
disciplinary/appellate authority to reconsider the penalty imposed, or to shorten the
litigation, it may itself, in exceptional and rare cases, impose appropriate punishment
with cogent reasons in support thereof."
65. In Om Kumar v. Union of India (2001) 2 SCC 386, after considering large number of cases, the
principle was summarized as under in para 71 of the reports:-
"71. Thus, from the above principles and decided cases, it must be held that where an
administrative decision relating to punishment in disciplinary cases is questioned as
"arbitrary" under Article 14, the court is confined to Wednesbury principles as a
secondary reviewing authority. The court will not apply proportionality as a primary
reviewing court because no issue of fundamental freedoms nor of discrimination
under Article 14 applies in such a context. The court while reviewing punishment and
if it is satisfied that Wednesbury principles are violated, it has normally to remit the
matter to the administrator for a fresh decision as to the quantum of punishment.
Only in rare cases where there has been long delay in the time taken by the
disciplinary proceedings and in the time taken in the courts, and in such extreme or
rare cases can the court substitute its own view as to the quantum of punishment."
66. In Damoh Panna Sagar Rural Regional Bank & Anr. v. Munna Lal Jain (2005) 10 SCC 84, it was
observed that the Court should not interfere with the administrator's decision unless it was illogical
or suffers from procedural impropriety or was shocking to the conscience of the Court, in the sense
that it was in defiance of logic or moral standards. The Court would not go into the correctness of
the choice made by the administrator open to him and the Court should not substitute its decision to
that of the administrator. The scope of judicial review is limited to the deficiency in decision-making
process and not the decision.
67. In Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd. v. N.B. Narawade (2005) 3 SCC 134, the respondent was
dismissed from service on the charge of having used abusive and filthy language against his
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/104903903/ 18
Amar Singh vs State Of U.P. Thru. Addl. Chief ... on 2 January, 2025
supervisor. The labour Court on the finding that the punishment of dismissal was harsh and
improper, directed his reinstatement with continuity of service and two-third back wages. The writ
petition filed by the employer was dismissed both by the learned Single Judge and also by the
Division Bench of the High Court. In appeal a three Judge Bench of this Court set aside the
judgments of the High Court and also the award of the labour Court and upheld the order of the
disciplinary authority dismissing the respondent from service. In Bharat Forge Co. Ltd. v. Uttam
Manohar Nakate (2005) 2 SCC 489, the respondent workman was found sleeping at about 11.40
a.m. while he was on duty in the first shift. On some earlier occasions also he was found guilty of
similar misconduct. After domestic enquiry wherein he was found guilty, he was dismissed from
service. The labour Court held that the punishment of dismissal was harsh and disproportionate and
no reasonable employer could impose such punishment for the proved misconduct and accordingly
directed reinstatement with fifty per cent back wages. There was a revision to the Industrial
Tribunal and then a writ petition and finally in letters patent appeal the Division Bench of the High
Court modified the award of the labour Court by directing the employer to pay a sum of
Rs.2,50,000/- to the workman. In appeal this Court, after referring to large number of earlier
decisions, set aside the judgment of the Division Bench and restored the order passed by the
employer.
68. On above principle another authority cited is of State of Karnataka and another v. N. Gangaraj:
(2020) 3 SCC 423 to demonstrate that certain discrepancies in evidence would not render the case
to be of no evidence. Citing the judgment of Supreme Court in the case of State of A.P. v. S. Sree
Rama Rao: AIR 1963 SC 1723 vide paragraph 9 the Court held thus:
"8. In State of A.P. v. S. Sree Rama Rao: AIR 1963 SC 1723, a three Judge Bench of
this Court has held that the High Court is not a court of appeal over the decision of
the authorities holding a departmental enquiry against a public servant. It is
concerned to determine whether the enquiry is held by an authority competent in
that behalf, and according to the procedure prescribed in that behalf, and whether
the rules of natural justice are not violated. The Court held as under:
"7. ... The High Court is not constituted in a proceeding under Article 226 of the
Constitution a court of appeal over the decision of the authorities holding a
departmental enquiry against a public servant: it is concerned to determine whether
the enquiry is held by an authority competent in that behalf, and according to the
procedure prescribed in that behalf, and whether the rules of natural justice are not
violated. Where there is some evidence, which the authority entrusted with the duty
to hold the enquiry has accepted and which evidence may reasonably support the
conclusion that the delinquent officer is guilty of the charge, it is not the function of
the High Court in a petition for a writ under Article 226 to review the evidence and to
arrive at an independent finding on the evidence."
69. Supreme Court also cited its earlier decision with approval in the case of Union of India v. P.
Gunasekaran: (2015) 2 SCC 610, wherein vide paragraph 13 the Court laid down the guiding
principle for interference in exercise of power by the High Court under Article 226/ 227 of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/104903903/ 19
Amar Singh vs State Of U.P. Thru. Addl. Chief ... on 2 January, 2025
Constitution. The Court dealt with the argument of the respondent in the case of N. Gangaraj
(supra) vide paragraph 14 to conclude that it was not a case of no evidence rather it was a case where
discrepancies in the evidence was cited to vitiate the conclusion drawn in the departmental inquiry
and decision taken by the disciplinary authority. The Court observed that once the Inquiry Officer
has appreciated the evidence it was beyond the scope of the authority of High Court to have
re-appreciated the same. The Court further observed vide paragraph 15 that once the evidence had
been accepted by the departmental authority the Tribunal or the High Court could not interfere with
the findings of the fact. Vide paragraph 14 and 15 the Court held thus:
"14. On the other hand learned counsel for the respondent relies upon the judgment
reported as Allahabad Bank v. Krishna Narayan Tewari: (2017) 2 SCC 308, wherein
this Court held that if the disciplinary authority records a finding that is not
supported by any evidence whatsoever or a finding which is unreasonably arrived at,
the Writ Court could interfere with the finding of the disciplinary proceedings. We do
not find that even on touchstone of that test, the Tribunal or the High Court could
interfere with the findings recorded by the disciplinary authority. It is not the case of
no evidence or that the findings are perverse. The finding that the respondent is
guilty of misconduct has been interfered with only on the ground that there are
discrepancies in the evidence of the Department. The discrepancies in the evidence
will not make it a case of no evidence. The Inquiry Officer has appreciated the
evidence and returned a finding that the respondent is guilty of misconduct.
15. The disciplinary authority agreed with the findings of the enquiry officer and had
passed an order of punishment. An appeal before the State Government was also
dismissed. Once the evidence has been accepted by the departmental authority, in
exercise of power of judicial review, the Tribunal or the High Court could not
interfere with the findings of facts recorded by re-appreciating evidence as if the
Courts are the Appellate Authority. We may notice that the said judgment has not
noticed larger bench judgments in S. Sree Rama Rao and B.C. Chaturvedi as
mentioned above. Therefore, the orders passed by the Tribunal and the High Court
suffer from patent illegality and thus cannot be sustained in law."
70. Upon reviewing the authorities cited by both parties, the Court concludes that the principles
discussed in the judgments are not contradictory but complementary. The Court emphasized that its
role is not to re-evaluate the evidence and arrive at a different conclusion, but rather to assess
whether the decision-making process was rational and legally sound. In this case, the department
failed to present sufficient evidence to support the charge that the petitioner deliberately circulated
the message to defame the Government.
71. Referring to the case of Union of India v. Sardar Bahadur (1972) 4 SCC 618, the Court noted that
if the department had failed to produce the relevant witnesses before the Inquiry Officer for
cross-examination, the department could not later claim that the Inquiry Officer had failed to
appreciate the statements made by those witnesses.

Amar Singh vs State Of U.P. Thru. Addl. Chief ... on 2 January, 2025
72. The Court also discussed the principle of Wednesbury unreasonableness in the case of
Wednesbury Corporation (supra), which allows judicial review of decisions that are irrational or not
based on logical reasoning. It further cited the case of Gohil Vishvaraj Hanubhai where the Court
reiterated that decisions should not defy logic or accepted moral standards, and if a decision is so
unreasonable that no reasonable person could have arrived at it, the Court would intervene.
73. The Court observes that in this case, the second charge against the petitioner was not proved at
all, and the first charge was partially substantiated based on the petitioner's admission that he had
forwarded the message inadvertently. The message was deleted before anyone could have read it,
and the department failed to provide evidence that the message had been circulated or read. Thus,
the dismissal was found to be shockingly disproportionate to the actual proven misconduct.
74. The Court considered the petitioner's admission as being made in the context of an honest
mistake, where he had tried to delete the message and asked others to do the same. The admission
was not an acknowledgment of an intentional attempt to harm the Government's reputation.
75. The Court, therefore, finds that the dismissal was disproportionate to the nature of the offense,
especially in light of the lack of evidence regarding the circulation of the message. It emphasizes that
the department should have acknowledged the petitioner's fairness in admitting the mistake and
could have issued a warning instead of imposing a harsh penalty.
76. While the admission of forwarding the message inadvertently was considered strong evidence,
the Court highlights that the admission did not indicate an intention to defame the Government. It
was simply an acknowledgment of an error, and the petitioner had taken steps to mitigate any
potential damage by deleting the message and informing others.
77. After considering both the arguments from the petitioner and the State, the Court concludes that
the dismissal order was disproportionate and warranted judicial intervention.
78. Consequently, the writ petition is allowed and therefore the dismissal order dated 7th
September, 2020 is quashed. The Court orders the petitioner's reinstatement with all consequential
benefits. The State Government is directed to impose a minor punishment, such as a warning,
taking into account the petitioner's admission of the mistake and lack of evidence of any damage
caused by the message.
79. The Court further directs the State Government to issue the appropriate order within 30 days of
receiving a certified copy of this judgment.
80. The case was remitted for a decision on a lesser punishment, acknowledging the petitioner's
fairness in dealing with the situation.
81. Costs would be easy, implying no heavy costs would be imposed.
