is seeking the following substantial reliefs:
"a) issue a writ, order or direction in the nature of MANDAMUS directing the
respondents authority to shift High Voltage Wire in another place who is passing over

compensation is payable to the petitioner.
4. Accordingly, the petitioner is directed to make an application under Section 10(d) of the Indian
Telegraph Act, 1885 before the Executive Engineer, Power Grid Corporation Sahjanwa, Gorakhpur

period of three weeks from date, the respondent No.5 shall consider and decide the same in
accordance with law expeditiously, preferably within a period of three months from the date of
making the said application.
5. With the above directions, the writ petition is disposed of.
