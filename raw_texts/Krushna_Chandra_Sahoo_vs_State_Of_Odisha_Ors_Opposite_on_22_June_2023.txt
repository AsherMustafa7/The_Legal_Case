Mr. P.K. Muduli, AGA
CORAM:
DR. JUSTICE B.R. SARANGI
MR. JUSTICE M.S. RAMAN
ORDER
22.06.2023 Order No. This matter is taken up through hybrid mode.
2. Heard Mr. S.R. Mohanty, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner and Mr. P.K. Muduli,
learned Additional Government Advocate appearing for the State-opposite parties.
3. The petitioner has filed this writ petition seeking to quash the show-cause notice dated
16.03.2023 under Annexure-3 as well as the demand notice dated 13.04.2023 under Annexure-5
issued by opposite party no.4-Tahasildar, Dharmasala directing the petitioner to deposit
Rs.13,31,31,670/- towards royalty and penalty for extraction beyond the permissible quantiy within
15 days from the date of receipt of the letter.
4. Mr. S.R. Mohanty, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner, at the outset, contended that the
demand notice under Annexure-5 dated 13.04.2023 issued by opposite party no.4- Tahasildar,
Dharmasala directing the petitioner to deposit Rs.13,31,31,670/- towards royalty and penalty cannot
be sustained in the eye of law, in view of the fact that opportunity of hearing to the petitioner has not
been given. It is also contended that the documents asked for by the petitioner under Annexure-4
have not been supplied to him so as to give effective reply to the show-cause notice and demand
notice issued by opposite party no.4. He further contended that similar matter had come up for
consideration before this Court in Manoj Kumar Samal v. State of Odisha & Ors. (W.P.(C) No.17732
of 2023, disposed of on 01.06.2023), in which one of us (Mr. Justice M.S. Raman) was a party,

wherein demand raised by the authority was quashed and the matter was remitted to the Tahasildar
for reconsideration.
5. Mr. P.K. Muduli, learned Additional Government Advocate appearing for the State-opposite
parties contended that the order impugned passed by the Tahasildar, Dharmasal is appealable one.
Instead of approaching the appellate authority, the petitioner has approached this Court directly by
filing this writ petition. He further contended that so far as supply of documents is concerned, as has
been dealt in the demand notice, he has not received any instructions to that effect.
6. Considering the contentions raised by learned counsel for the parties and after going through the
records, this Court finds that the petitioner was issued show-cause notice on 16.03.2023 under
Annexure-3 for payment of extra dues for unauthorized/over extraction of 2,45,404 cum and as a
consequence thereof, he is liable to pay the entire amount. In response to the said show-cause
notice, the petitioner gave reply vide Annexure-4 specifically asking for certain documents, as has
been indicated in page-44 of the brief, which reads as follows:
"In order to establish the truth of this matter; I request the competent Authority to
supply the following records for arriving at a conclusion based on facts and records.
1) To supply the surface plan of the demise lease area as on 25.6.2018.

But the said documents have not been supplied to the petitioner to give effective reply. Thereafter,
opposite party no.4-Tahasildar, Dharmasala issued demand notice dated 13.04.2023 under
Annexure-5 directing the petitioner to deposit Rs.13,31,31,670/- towards royalty and penalty.
7. In view of such position, this Court is of the considered view that when the demand was raised,
the authority should have complied with the principle of natural justice, but, as it appears, no such
compliance has been made. Therefore, the demand notice under Annexure-5 dated 13.04.2023 so
issued by opposite party no.4-Tahasildar, Dharmasala is liable to be quashed and is hereby quashed.
The matter is remitted to the said authority, i.e. opposite party no.4 for its reconsideration by giving
opportunity of hearing to the petitioner keeping in view of ratio decided by the apex Court in Oryx
Fisheries Pvt. Ltd. v. Union of India, (2010) 13 SCC 427 and also the order dated 01.06.2023 passed
by this Court in Manoj Kumar Samal (supra). Needless to say, the entire exercise shall be completed
as expeditiously as possible, preferably within a period of four weeks.
8. With the above observation and direction, the writ petition stands disposed of.
