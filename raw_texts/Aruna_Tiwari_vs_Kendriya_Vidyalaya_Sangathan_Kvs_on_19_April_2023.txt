ORDER
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/178992258/ 1
Aruna Tiwari vs Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (Kvs) on 19 April, 2023
Learned counsel for rival parties are heard on the question of admission so also final disposal.
2. Learned counsel for rival parties do not dispute that similar issue has since been decided in a
bunch of petitions includingWP. No.1262/2023 decided on 03.03.2023 whereby this Court while
considering the challenge made to order of Tribunal issued following directions:-
"6. On hearing learned counsels and without going into the merits of the case, we are
of the considered view that appropriate interference are required to be made in all
these matters.
7. So far as the grievances of each one of the petitioner are concerned, it is admitted
that none of the grievances have been broughtto the notice of the concerned Kendriya
Vidyalaya Sangathan. That, each one of the petitioners appear to have their own
reasons, in order to assail the orders of transfer. Therefore, we are of the view that it
will only be just and appropriate to permit the petitioners to make their
representations to the respondents/ Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan culling out the
reasons as to why the transfer order is required to be withdrawn. It is only when the
petitioners make a request to the respondents stating their grievances, the
respondents/ Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan would then consider the same on merits
and also in terms of the transfer guidelines.
8. However, it is contended that so far as Guideline No.6 is concerned, the same
appears to have been stayed by the Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan. Even then we are
of the view that every order oftransfer requires to be fairly considered. It is ultimately
fairness in action, which the Court will be looking into.
9. Therefore, with the consent of the learned counsel for the parties, we are of the
considered view that the petitioners may make a representation individually to the
respondents/Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan on or before 06.03.2023. That, they are
entitled to take all grounds in support of their case. The respondents should consider
t he representation individually and pass appropriate orders thereon on or before
20.03.2023. That they shall also take into account the fresh manpower that is likely
to be employed by them while considering the case of each one of the petitioners.
Furthermore, even those petitioners who have already reported to the place of
posting would also be permitted to make a representation to this effect. In case, the
representation has already been furnished, the same does not prevent the petitioners
from filing a fresh representation also. The challenge to the transfer guidelines, will
be considered in an appropriate proceeding.
10. Hence, all these petitions are accordingly disposed off.
11. The interim order granted by the Tribunal shall remain in operation till
10.04.2023.

12. The respondents shall not be influenced by any of the observations made by the
Tribunal while passing the fresh orders.
13. Pending interlocutory applications stand disposed off."
3 . This Court after hearing learned counsel for rival parties is of the considered view that aforesaid
order dated 03.03.2023 in WP. No.1262/2023 shall mutatis mutandis apply to present case.
4 . However. learned counsel for petitioner has referred to various provisions of Transfer Guidelines
of Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan, 2021 to emphasize the personal grievance of petitioner, which
primarily relate to field of compassion on medical grounds.
5. We have no manner of doubt that said compassionate grounds, if any, shall be taken into account
by Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan in terms of prevailing policy and the law.
6. On the other hand, Shri Verma, learned counsel for Sangathan informs that Clause 6 has been
suspended and said suspension has neither been disturbed by the Tribunal nor by Coordinate Bench
of this Court in WP. No.1262/2023..
7. Be that as it may, the Sangathan being an employer is free to consider the matter at its own level
and this Court need not comment upon the merits of the grievances since they relate to domain of
compassion which lies within the exclusive purview of the employer and not this Court.
8. Accordingly, order dated 03.03.2023 passed in MP.No.1262/2023 shall mutatis mutandis apply
for disposal of this case.
9. Since an interim order was passed by this Court on 02.03.2023, the s a me is directed to be
continued till 28.04.2023 or till decision on the representation whichever is earlier whereafter the
petitioner is well advised to join at the transferred place without awaiting for outcome of
representation.
10. It is made clear that mere joining of petitioner at the transferred place shall not render the cause
in the representation infructuous.
11. With aforesaid observations, present petition stands disposed of.
