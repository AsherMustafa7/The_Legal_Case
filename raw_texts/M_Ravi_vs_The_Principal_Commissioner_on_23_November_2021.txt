possession has not been taken over till today. Therefore, the non-service of notice under Section

11(5) of the Act is fatal and the entire acquisition proceedings have lapsed, since after the Repeal Act,

Naicker, Rajambal and Krishna Naicker were found to be the owners of the lands comprised in
S.Nos.36/8 and 36/9 respectively measuring an extent of 6200 sq.mts and 6000 sq.mts situated at
Noombal Village as per Revenue Records. Since they had not filed “Return” under Section 7(1) of the
Act, a notice under Section 7(2) of the Act was issued by the second respondent to them and the
same was duly received by them. However, they have not filed any objection. Subsequently, a notice
under Section 9(4) along with statement under Section 9(1) of the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.No.11690 of 2006 etc., batch Act was issued by the second respondent on 12.11.1991, calling
upon them to raise objections if any. The said notice was duly received by one Rajeswari daughter of

objections were received and as such, the final statement under Section 10(1) of the Act was issued
on 27.05.1992. The same was also received by their respective daughters. The Notification under
Section 11(1) of the Act was issued on 14.09.1992 and published in the Tamil Nadu Government
Gazette No.41, dated 21.10.1992. The Notification under Section 11(3) of the Act was issued on

of 2006 etc., batch Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board, vide G.O.Ms.No.1003, Revenue Department,
dated 30.09.1996.
4. On a perusal of the respective sale deeds, it is clear that all the petitioners have purchased the said
property by their respective sale deeds in the year 1999 itself viz., after the Repeal Act came into
force with effect from 16.06.1999. Therefore, their respective possession was handed over on the
date of their purchase and they have constructed respective houses which were also assessed to
property tax. Even till today, they are residing there and paying house tax and the electricity
consumption charges. That apart, from their sale deeds, it reveals that the subject properties were
sold out by one L.Srinivasan So/.P.Lakshmanan. The said Srinivasan derived title by the sale deed
dated 17.02.1992, which was executed by one Pugazharasu through his Power Agent one
J.Aadidevan S/o.Jagannathan. Therefore, as early as on 17.02.1992, the said Ramalinga Naicker,
Rajambal and Krishna Naicker were not the owner of the properties comprised in S.Nos.36/9 and
36/8. Hence, the entire proceedings were initiated as against the said Ramalinga Naicker, Rajambal
and Krishna Naicker. However, the physical possession of their respective house plots are very much
with the respective https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.No.11690 of 2006 etc., batch petitioners.
5. Further, from the counter affidavit, it also reveals that the notice under Section 11(5) of the Act

M.Ravi vs The Principal Commissioner & on 23 November, 2021
Ramalinga Naicker on 14.03.1993. On the date of issuance of the notice under Section 11(5) of the
Act, the said Ramalinga Naicker was not the owner of the property and the petitioners have
purchased the said property on the date of notice issued under Section 11(5) of the Act. The
petitioners were never served with the notice under Section 11(5) of the Act and they are in
possession and enjoyment of the respective plots, after constructing their respective houses.
Therefore, the entire work done by the second respondent was only by “desk work” and no physical
possession has been taken yet. Therefore, the entire acquisition had lapsed as per the Repeal Act.
6. In view of the above discussion, the impugned proceedings have lapsed. The third respondent is
directed to mutate the Revenue Records in the name of respective petitioners as per the respective
sale deeds and issue Patta to the petitioners, within a period of four weeks from the date of receipt of
a copy of this order.
