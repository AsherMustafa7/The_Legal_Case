Prashant Kumar Mahensaria vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 25 July, 2019
as for directing the respondent no.3 for inclusion of rates for
irrigated/ agricultural category of land in the Minimum
Valuation Register (MVR) under Rule 5 of the Bihar Stamp
Patna High Court CWJC No.6440 of 2016 dt.25-07-2019
2/11
(Prevention of under Valuation of Instruments) Rules, 1995
pertaining to Nagar Panchayat, Gogri, Jamalpur and for
declaring that in absence of an entry of rates specified in the
MVR for irrigated/ agricultural lands for Nagar Panchayat
Gogri, Jamalpur, the respondents cannot draw benefit of such
absence in the MVR and recover stamp duty and registration
charges at higher rates from the petitioner.
2. The brief facts of the case are that the petitioner has
purchased a plot being irrigated/ agricultural at Mauza-
Jamalpur, Thana No. 309/1, Nagar Panchayat, Gogri, Ward No.
12, Khata No. 80, Kheshra No. 236, 237, 238 and 239 ad
measuring 157.00 decimals. The said land was purchased by the
petitioner from Basudev Pansari & Ors. The petitioner had
declared the value of land in the sale deed as Rs. 23,70,000/-, by
adopting the rates of irrigated/ agricultural land mentioned in
the MVR pertaining to Mauza-Jamalpur and had then presented
the sale deed for registration before the respondent no.4 on
12.03.2014
. Thereafter, the District Sub-Registrar, Khagaria by a letter dated 22.02.2014 had called for a report
from the Circle Officer, Gogri regarding Khesra number in question to the effect as to whether the
said land was residential or not. The Circle Officer, Gogri by his letter dated 05.03.2014 had written
to the Patna High Court CWJC No.6440 of 2016 dt.25-07-2019 District Sub-Registrar, Khagaria
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/61892717/ 2
Prashant Kumar Mahensaria vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 25 July, 2019
stating that the aforesaid land in question was inspected by the Halka-Karmchari and Incharge
Circle Inspector and it has been found that the said land is an irrigated/ agricultural land.
Thereafter, the respondent no. 4 is said to have verbally informed the petitioner that the stamp duty
totalling to a sum of Rs. 1,89,600/- shall be payable for registration of the sale deed in question,
whereafter the petitioner duly paid the said amount by way of stamp duty as also the registration
charges, however, the sale deed was then not provided to the petitioner herein, whereupon the
petitioner approached the respondent no.4, who intimated him that the matter has been referred to
the respondent no.2 under Section 47(A) of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899. Subsequently, a notice
dated 31.03.2014 was issued by the AIG, Munger Division, Munger to the petitioner herein,
initiating a proceeding under Section 47(A) of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899, for recovery of deficit
stamp duty amounting to a sum of Rs.25,01,868/-. The petitioner had then appeared before the
respondent no.2, however, neither any hearing was conducted nor any enquiry, as contemplated
under Section 47(A) of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 was conducted, but instead the impugned order
dated 27.01.2016 was passed by the respondent no.2 in Stamp Case Patna High Court CWJC
No.6440 of 2016 dt.25-07-2019 No. 15/2015 whereby and whereunder the respondent no.2, relying
upon the report of the Registration Officer, treating the aforesaid land to be under the Nagar
Panchayat, Ward No.12 and not relying upon the report of the Circle Officer dated 05.03.2014, fixed
the deficit amount of stamp duty, recoverable from the petitioner, as Rs. 25,01,868/-.
3. The learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that Rules 5 and 6 of the Bihar Stamp
(Prevention of Under Valuation of Instruments) Rules, 1995 (herein after referred to as the "Rules,
1995") provides that the Collector of the District shall classify the lands of rural or urban area and
prepare a register showing estimated minimum value of the land/ properties of that category as per
the procedure prescribed under Rules 6 of the Rules 1995. It is submitted that as per the provisions
of the Rules, 1995, for the purposes of determination of estimated minimum market value of the
land and property in question, the matter can be referred by the District Sub- Registrar to the
District authorities of the State. In the instant case, since there was no entry in the MVR for Nagar
Panchayat, Gogri, the respondent no.4 had requested the Circle Officer, Gogri to provide a physical
inspection report of the land in question whereupon the Circle Officer, Gogri had reported that
Patna High Court CWJC No.6440 of 2016 dt.25-07-2019 the said land in question was do fasla
irrigated/ agricultural land. It is the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner that the
said report of the Circle Officer ought to have been accepted by the respondent no. 4 for the
purposes of valuation of the land in question, hence the respondent no.4 has committed a gross
error by referring the matter to the respondent no.2 under Section 47(A) of the Indian Stamp Act,
1899. It is further submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that neither the petitioner was
heard nor any enquiry was made under section 47(A) (ii) of the Indian Stamp Act, hence the
impugned order dated 27.01.2016 is without jurisdiction and is liable to be set aside. It is also the
submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner that since the petitioner was not provided any
opportunity of hearing to deny the liability under section 47(A) of the Indian Stamp Act, the
impugned order dated 27.01.2016 is violative of the principles of natural justice, hence is fit to be set
aside. Lastly, it is submitted that the impugned order dated 27.01.2016 is cryptic and suffers from
the vice of non-application of mind by the respondent no.2.

4. Per contra, the learned counsel for the respondents no. 3 and 4 has submitted that initially the
document in question was produced on 12.03.2014 before the District Sub-Registrar, Patna High
Court CWJC No.6440 of 2016 dt.25-07-2019 Khagaria, and according to the report submitted by the
Circle Officer, Gogri dated 02.04.2012, the land in question has been classified as residential
notified urban area, however, the petitioner had presented the document by showing the land in
question as agricultural land. In fact, in MVR, Ward No. 12 has been classified as an urban area,
hence no agricultural land in situated in the said area. It is the contention of the learned counsel for
the respondents that though the land in question has been classified as an urban area but the
petitioner has paid registration fee, treating the land in question to be situated in a rural area, hence
the deed was not accepted by the respondent no.2 for registration, whereafter the entire deed was
carefully examined and it was found that proper registration fee has not been paid, resulting in
passing of the impugned order dated 27.01.2016 under Section 47 of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899
whereby the petitioner has been directed to pay the deficit stamp fees of Rs. 25,01,868/-, however,
the petitioner has failed to pay the same, hence the sale deed has not been registered till date. Lastly,
it is submitted that the land in question was/is under the category of commercial/ residential, hence
the valuation has been done accordingly.
5. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and Patna High Court CWJC No.6440 of 2016
dt.25-07-2019 perused the materials on record. At this juncture, it would be relevant to reproduce
Rule 5 of the Bihar Stamp (Prevention of Under Valuation of Instruments) Rules, 1995 herein
below:-
"5. Guidelines register of minimum value.- For the purpose of assisting the
Registering Officer in finding out actual market value of properties (as accurately as
may be possible) the District Sub- Registrar within the area of his district shall after
classifying the lands of rural or urban area prepare a register showing estimated
minimum value of the land/ properties of the category as per procedure laid down in
Rule 6".
6. Rule 6 of the aforesaid Rules, 1995 prescribes the process for fixation of estimated minimum
market value in every district on the recommendation of District Valuation Committee established
for this purpose under the chairmanship of the Collector of the district which in turn functions
under the overall guidance and supervision of Central Valuation Committee constituted at State
level.
7. Admittedly, in the present case, the minimum valuation register, as prescribed under Rules 5 and
6 of the Bihar Stamp (Prevention of Under Valuation of Instruments) Rules, 1995, does not
prescribe any rate in the category of irrigated/ agricultural land of Nagar Panchyat, Gogri, however,
according to the petitioner, the minimum valuation register pertaining to Mauza-Jamalpur
(Annexure-1/A to the writ Patna High Court CWJC No.6440 of 2016 dt.25-07-2019 petition) shows
the rate of irrigated land under the district of Jamalpur whereas on the other hand, the respondents
have relied upon a letter dated 02.04.2012 issued by the Circle Officer, Gogri wherein the land in
question along with other Khesras have been shown as "NAC" i.e. non-agricultural/ commercial
lands and, accordingly, the rate has been decided on the basis of commercial rate prescribed for
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/61892717/ 4
Prashant Kumar Mahensaria vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 25 July, 2019
Ward No.12 in the MVR. This Court finds that the respondent no.2 in the impugned order dated
27.01.2016 has nowhere referred to the aforesaid letter of the Circle Officer, Gogri dated 02.04.2012
which, in fact, is a general letter showing various khesras to be either non- agricultural or
commercial land or agricultural/ irrigated land, hence the respondents cannot be permitted to
improve their case by supplementing their arguments by way of the counter affidavit filed in the
present case and introducing the said letter of the Circle Officer dated 02.04.2012, for the simple
reason that an order has to be judged on its own merits, considering the contents thereof. Therefore,
this Court finds that the respondent no.2, in the impugned order dated 27.01.2016, though has
referred to the letter/report of the Circle Officer, Gogri dated 05.03.2014 showing the land in
question to be "do fasla irrigated land", submitted in response to the letter of the District Patna High
Court CWJC No.6440 of 2016 dt.25-07-2019 Sub-Registrar, Khagaria calling for a report from him
regarding the nature and category of the land in question, but he has failed to rely upon the same
and instead has relied upon the opinion of the Registration Officer to the effect that the land in
question is situated in Nagar Panchayat Ward No.12.
8. Admittedly, there is no categorization of the land in question i.e. as to whether the said land is
irrigated/ agricultural land or urban land or non-agricultural land or commercial land. The
respondents, in their counter affidavit, have shown the land in question as belonging to the category
of "commercial/ residential", which is not decipherable, in as much as a plot of land cannot be both
commercial and at the same time residential. This position has been stated in paragraph-9 of the
counter affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent nos. 3 and 4. Thus, this Court finds that there has
been neither any fixation of estimated market value of the plot in question nor there has been any
categorisation of the irrigated/ agricultural plots of Nagar Panchayat, Gogri District Khagaria.
Moreover, this Court finds that the impugned order dated 27.01.2016 does not show that the
respondent no.2 has conducted any enquiry before passing the said order, in compliance of the
provisions as contained in Section 47(A)(ii) of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899. Lastly, this Patna High
Court CWJC No.6440 of 2016 dt.25-07-2019 Court is of the opinion that the impugned order dated
27.01.2016 is cryptic and does not show any application of mind by the respondent no.2 in declaring
that there is deficit stamp duty of Rs. 25,01,868/-, which is recoverable from the petitioner herein.
9. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case and for the reasons mentioned herein
above, the writ petition is allowed and the order dated 27.01.2016 passed by the respondent no.2 is
quashed, however, with a direction to the respondent no.3 i.e. the District Magistrate-cum-
Collector, Khagaria to act in terms of Rule 6 of the Bihar Stamp (Prevention of Under Valuation of
Instruments) Rules, 1995 and fix the estimated minimum value of the land in question along with
other irrigated/ agricultural category land of the Nagar Panchayat, Gogri, District Khagaria as also
define the category of the land in question belonging to the petitioner herein for which sale deed has
been presented by the petitioner for registration before the respondent authorities.
10. It is needless to state that the respondent no. 3 shall do the needful, as aforesaid, within a period
of twelve weeks from the date of receipt/production of a copy of this order, whereupon the
respondent no.4 i.e. the District Sub-

Prashant Kumar Mahensaria vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 25 July, 2019
Patna High Court CWJC No.6440 of 2016 dt.25-07-2019 Registrar, Khagaria shall work out the
stamp duty to be paid by the petitioner herein for the purpose of registration of the sale deed in
question, as per the categorization and rate fixed by the respondent no.3 under Section 6 of the
Indian Stamp Act, 1899. Any consequential action of the respondents, pursuant to passing of the
impugned Order dated 27.01.2016, by the respondent no.2 are also quashed, as a consequence of
setting aside of the impugned order dated 27.01.2016.
