Pooran Chand Saini And 4 Others vs State Of U.P. And 2 Others on 28 February, 2025
No.0140 of 2023, under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471, 120-B IPC, P.S. Falawada, District- Meerut.
4. This Court vide order dated 29.11.2024 has proceeded to pass the following order:
"1. Heard learned counsel for the petitioners and learned A.G.A. appearing for the
State respondents.
2. Present writ petition has been preferred for quashing the impugned FIR dated
27.10.2023 registered as Case Crime No.140 of 2023, under Sections 420, 467, 468,
471 and 120B IPC, Police Station Falawada, District Meerut and for a direction to
respondents not to arrest the petitioners pursuant to aforesaid FIR.
3. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that there is a civil dispute and the
parties have already settled the matter out of court on 28.2.2024. A copy of the
compromise dated 28.2.2024 is also brought on record as Annexure No.SA-1 to the
supplementary affidavit. It is pressed that continuation of the proceedings of the
aforesaid case will be an abuse of process of law and as such, the impugned first
information report is liable to be quashed. In support of his submission, he has
placed reliance on the judgements of Hon'ble Apex Court in B.S. Joshi Vs. State of
Haryana reported in 2003(4) SCC 675, Nikhil Merchant Vs. Central Bureau of
investigation and another J.T. 2008(9) SC 192, Gian Singh Vs. State of Punjab (2012)
10 SCC 303, Yogendra Yadav and others Vs. State of Jharkhand (2014) 9 SCC 653
and also in Narendra Singh Vs. State of Punjab (2014) 6 SCC 466.
4. In all the aforesaid cases, the Apex Court has laid down the law that criminal
proceedings may be quashed even in non-compoundable cases by the High Court in
exercise of its extraordinary jurisdiction to restore peace between the parties and in
case the justice so demands. According to Hon'ble Supreme Court, if the offence
involves private dispute between the parties of commercial nature or matrimonial
dispute and it is not related to heinous offence, the proceedings may be quashed.
6. Since the dispute between the parties has been amicably and mutually settled, no
fruitful purpose would be served by permitting to continue the criminal proceeding
and it would simply be a waste of time, if the aforesaid case is permitted to continue
till its logical conclusion.
7. As it is informed that till date the police report under Section 173 (2)
Cr.P.C./Section 193 (3) of Bhartiya Nagrika Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 has not been
submitted in the aforesaid Case Crime No.140 of 2023, we direct that the parties may
appear before the Investigating Officer for verification of the settlement/compromise
within one week from today. Thereafter, the investigating officer will produce the
parties to the concerned jurisdictional Magistrate for verification of the said claim. It
is also directed that the Magistrate concerned will record the statement of the parties
concerned as to whether the terms and conditions, if set out in the

settlement/compromise, had been fulfilled or not and submit a report before this
Court within one week thereafter.
8. List this matter in the week commencing 16.12.2024. The interim order is
extended till the next date of listing."
5. In response to the order dated 29.11.2024, a report dated 09.12.2024 is submitted by ACJM
(J.D.), Third, Meerut whereby the compromise/settlement has been duly verified. Learned counsel
for the petitioner contends that the parties reached a mutual compromise and executed a
Compromise on 28.02.2024, agreeing to withdraw cases filed against each other. He further states
that since the parties have already settled the matter, the instant First Information Report is liable
to be quashed.
6. Learned counsel for the informant states informant has no objection in case the impugned first
information report is quashed. Learned AGA has also fairly submitted that as the matter is already
settled and the interim order was accorded, the impugned FIR may be quashed.
7. It is jointly submitted that this being an offshoot of a dispute, same has come to be amicably
resolved under the compromise dated 28.02.2024, duly verified by the concerned Judicial
Magistrate, pending proceedings would serve no purpose and the same are liable to be quashed in
the light of the judgements of the Hon'ble the Apex Court in the case of B.S. Joshi v. State of
Haryana and others, 2003(4) SCC 675 and Gian Singh v. State of Punjab, 2012(10) SCC 303.
Reliance has also been placed on the judgment of Division Bench of this Court dated 16.9.2022 in
Criminal Misc. Writ Petition No.8510 of 2022 (Anuj Pandey v. State of U.P. & Ors.) wherein it is
observed that the High Court has ample power under its inherent jurisdiction to quash the first
information report in which the parties have settled their disputes which are of private in nature and
have no any grave impact on the society. The time of courts as well as investigating agencies are very
precious which should not be wasted in any futile proceedings where the chance of conviction is
bleak.
8. Hon'ble the Apex Court in the case of Gian Singh (supra) has held in para-61 that;
"the power of the High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint
in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to
a criminal court for compounding the offences Under Section 320 of the Code.
Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be
exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz; (i) to secure the
ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases
power to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be exercised
where the offender and victim have settled their dispute would depend on the facts
and circumstances of each case and no category can be prescribed. However, before
exercise of such power, the High Court must have due regard to the nature and
gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or offences
like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. cannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim or

Pooran Chand Saini And 4 Others vs State Of U.P. And 2 Others on 28 February, 2025
victim's family and the offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are not
private in nature and have serious impact on society. Similarly, any compromise
between the victim and offender in relation to the offences under special statutes like
Prevention of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants while
working in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for quashing criminal
proceedings involving such offences. But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly
and pre-dominatingly civil favour stand on different footing for the purposes of
quashing, particularly the offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile,
civil, partnership or such like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
relating to dowry, etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically private or
personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this category
of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the
compromise between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote
and bleak and continuation of criminal case would put accused to great oppression
and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the
criminal case despite full and complete settlement and compromise with the victim.
In other words, the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or contrary
to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of
the criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process of law despite
settlement and compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and whether to
secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put to an end and if
the answer to the above question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well
within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."
9. The present dispute was a civil dispute. Neither it is involving any moral turpitude nor is heinous
in nature. Since the dispute between the parties have already been settled amicably vide
compromise dated 28.02.2024, pending proceedings would serve no purpose and the same are
liable to be quashed in the light of the aforesaid judgments.
10. The writ petition is allowed and the proceedings of First Information Report dated 27.10.2023
registered as Case Crime No.0140 of 2023, under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471, 120-B IPC, P.S.
Falawada, District- Meerut are quashed.
