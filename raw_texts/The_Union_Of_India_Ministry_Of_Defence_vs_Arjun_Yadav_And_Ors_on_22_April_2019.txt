HONOURABLE JUSTICE SMT. ANJANA MISHRA
ORAL JUDGMENT
(Per: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE)
Date : 22-04-2019
This appeal is by the Union of India arising out of a
writ petition in proceedings under the Land Acquisition Act,
1894 where the appellant was not made a party and the writ
petition was allowed vide impugned judgment dated 7th of May,
2014 in C.W.J.C. No. 20058 of 2012 and other analogous cases
and in compliance whereof proceedings under the 2013 Act
were drawn up and orders were passed in exercise of powers
under Section 64 of the 2013 Act, thereby considerably
enhancing the amount of compensation payable to the
respondent-petitioners applying the rates as per the new Act. The
appeal had been entertained and notices were issued on 17 th of
April, 2018 and, simultaneously, an interim order was passed
staying the operation of the impugned judgment.
2. The order dated 17th of April, 2018 is extracted
hereinunder:-

along with L.P.A. No. 1731 of 2017.
In the meanwhile, all actions
and further proceedings before the
Presiding Officer, Land Acquisition &
Rehabilitation Authority, Patna, in
furtherance to the impugned order passed
on 07.05.2014 by the learned Writ Court in
the writ petition in question, shall remain

3. Thereafter vide order dated 18th December, 2018
leave to appeal was granted to the appellant and the delay in the
filing of the appeal was condoned whereafter the respondents
were called upon to file their response. The interim order
extracted hereinabove was directed to continue until further
orders.
4. The matter was thereafter taken up and,
ultimately, after hearing the learned counsel for the parties, a
direction was issued to list the matter for delivery of judgment
on the date fixed.
5. The background in which the present appeal has
Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019
4/90
been filed is that the Ministry of Defence, Government of India,
for the setting up of an Ordnance Factory at Rajgir, District-
Nalanda, Bihar, required land. For this, acquisition process was
set into motion and on 15th of September, 1999 a notification
under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 was issued,
followed by a Section 6 notification simultaneously invoking the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138901827/ 3
The Union Of India, Ministry Of Defence vs Arjun Yadav And Ors on 22 April, 2019
provisions of Section 17(4) of the said Act.
6. The sanction was granted by the Central
Government for deposit of the amount of 80 per cent. This
amount was deposited and further steps were taken for
acquisition of 50 acres of land for rehabilitation of the displaced
persons on the land that was acquired for the Ordinance Factory.
7. According to the appellant, the District Land
Acquisition Officer, on 12th of June,2001, pronounced an award.
The respondent had every knowledge of the said proceeding, but
since there was a dispute with regard to the ownership and the
extent of compensation payable, a reference was made under
Section 30 of the 1894 Act on 12th of October, 2002 vide letter
dated 21.10.2002 for being adjudicated by the concerned Court
at Nalanda, Biharsharif, Prior to this, possession of the land was
taken over on 6th July, 2002. The balance of the 20% amount
was also deposited by the appellant with the respondent
Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019
5/90
Collector.
8. On 30th January, 2010, the reference under
Section 30 was answered whereby the claim of the respondents
was accepted and a direction was issued to apportion the award
accordingly.
9. A notice was issued under Section 12(2) of the
1894 Act on 24th April, 2010 calling upon the respondents to
receive the award of the land stated therein.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138901827/ 4
The Union Of India, Ministry Of Defence vs Arjun Yadav And Ors on 22 April, 2019
10. The respondent-petitioners thereafter moved an
application on 24th May, 2010 to exercise their right for making
a reference under Section 18 of the 1894 Act. The fact that an
award was passed on 12th June, 2001 was accepted in the said
proceedings, but the amount awarded was disputed contending
that the respondent-petitioners were entitled to payment of
compensation at a higher rate as awarded. It was also disputed
that the award was deficient and it did not contain the particulars
including the area or the amount to which the respondent-
petitioner was entitled. The respondent-petitioners alleged that it
is only through the order passed by the Court in proceedings
under Section 30 that the respondent-petitioners came to know
about the exact contents of the award about the area acquired
and the compensation released. It is for this reason that they
Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019
6/90
moved the application under Section 18 on 02.06.2010 within
the time prescribed therein after having been served with a copy
of the order aforesaid.
11. The said application was rejected by the Land
Acquisition Officer on 15.07.2010 declining to refer the dispute
under Section 18 on the ground that the application was barred
by time that was impugned in the petition giving rise to this
appeal.
12. At this juncture, we may mention that Shri
Mrigank Mauli, learned counsel appearing for the respondent-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138901827/ 5
The Union Of India, Ministry Of Defence vs Arjun Yadav And Ors on 22 April, 2019
petitioners, has raised three basic preliminary objections; firstly
that in Section 18 proceedings, it is only after the Court
entertains the application that notices are required to be issued to
the beneficiaries of acquisition. Thus, the Union of India was not
a proper and necessary party to be impleaded in the writ petition
and, as a matter of fact, the Union of India could not press its
commercial interest in order to question the correctness or
otherwise of the application under Section 18 of the Act. It is
urged that it is only after the proceedings are entertained that
any party interested may be called upon to give evidence and not
otherwise. Thus, if the Collector had rejected the application
then the writ petition filed challenging the said order did not
Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019
7/90
require impleadment of the Union of India, inasmuch as, it is
only the issue of the entertaining of an application under Section
18 within the limitation prescribed that has to be decided and for
which the learned Single Judge has arrived at the correct
conclusion. Accordingly, the appellant has no right to institute or
maintain this appeal. The order of grant of leave to appeal
therefore be recalled and the appeal be dismissed.
13. The second ground of preliminary objection is
that the appellant after the judgment of the learned Single Judge,
that was delivered in the year 2014, participated in the
proceedings which is evident from the order-sheet that has been
filed to demonstrate that the appellants had come to know of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138901827/ 6
The Union Of India, Ministry Of Defence vs Arjun Yadav And Ors on 22 April, 2019
proceedings initiated by the answering respondents and in spite
of having participated therein, the present appeal, which was
filed in the year 2018, did not disclose the fact of having
participated before the court below and orders having been
passed. It is in this background that it is urged that the
preliminary objections deserve to be entertained and the appeal
dismissed on this ground alone. We will deal with this matter as
the learned counsel have advanced their submissions in this
regard with the aid of certain judgments claiming them to be
applicable on the facts of the present controversy.
Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019
8/90
14. The third ground of the preliminary objection is
on the limitation part contending that this appeal is wholly
belated and, therefore, the order passed condoning the limitation
should be set aside and the appeal be dismissed for want of any
sufficient cause or explanation on the part of the appellant in
filing of this appeal.
15. There is one more fact which deserves mention
that against the orders passed under Section 64 of the 2013 Act,
appeals have been filed by the State of Bihar questioning the
correctness thereof. However, the learned counsel for the
appellants contends that those proceedings have been initiated
by the State of Bihar, but in the present case since the entire
exercise for enhancement after entertaining the contentions in
the application under Section 18 emanates on the strength of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138901827/ 7
The Union Of India, Ministry Of Defence vs Arjun Yadav And Ors on 22 April, 2019
judgment impugned herein, then the decision rendered in this
appeal challenging the impugned judgment of the learned Single
Judge may have an impact and for which it was necessary for
the appellants to have preferred this appeal.
16. The main thrust of the argument of Shri S.D.
Sanjay, learned Additional Solicitor General of India on behalf
of the Ministry of Defence, Union of India is that the learned
Single Judge not only committed an error in treating the
Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019
9/90
application under Section 18 to have been filed within time, but
also the reason given in respect thereof, namely that the award
dated 12th June, 2001 was a purported award and it came into
existence only after the orders came to be finally passed on the
reference under Section 30 of the Act. It is urged that this was a
totally incorrect approach of assuming that there was no award
dated 12th June, 2001 and, therefore, the judgment of the learned
Single Judge deserves to be set aside.
17. Responding to the said submission, Shri
Mrigank Mauli contends with the aid of certain decisions that an
award has to be a complete award and the stated award dated
12th June, 2001 was a mere paper calculation, without there
being any order pronouncing an award as required under Section
11 indicating the details of the area and the amount payable. It is
his submission that in the absence of any valid award the
question of running of the period of limitation under Section 18
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138901827/ 8
The Union Of India, Ministry Of Defence vs Arjun Yadav And Ors on 22 April, 2019
does not arise. He has, however, with the aid of the judgments of
the Apex Court, contended that the opportunity to file an
application under Section 18 arises only after notices are served
under Section 12(2) of the 1894 Act and the contents of the
award are made known, whereas in the present case the so-
called award dated 12th June, 2001 does not contain any details
Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019
10/90
with regard to the area of the respondent-petitioners having been
acquired or the extension of compensation received. It was only
in the year 2010 when, for the first time, upon adjudication in
Section 30 proceedings of the 1894 Act that the material was
made known and, consequently, it is thereafter that the
application was filed under Section 18 of the 1894 Act. It is,
therefore, urged that there was no delay and the application
under Section 18 of the Act moved in the year 2010 was very
much within time. The learned Single Judge, therefore, has
rightly construed this position and has arrived at the correct
conclusion.
18. Coming to the issue of preliminary objections
raised, we may deal with the issue of filing of this appeal after
some delay. The prayer for condonation of delay in the filing of
this appeal has been made in I.A. No. 2477 of 2018. In
Paragraph 3 of the said affidavit, the appellant discloses that
pursuant to the judgment of the learned Single Judge dated 7 th
May, 2014 the proceedings were undertaken after transfer from
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138901827/ 9
The Union Of India, Ministry Of Defence vs Arjun Yadav And Ors on 22 April, 2019
the court of District & Sessions Judge by the court of Land
Acquisition Rehabilitation and Resettlement, Authority, Patna
and then notice was isued to the appellant in October, 2016. The
fact, therefore, disclosing the knowledge of the proceedings
Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019
11/90
pursuant to the judgment of the learned Single Judge, therefore,
appears to have been accepted to be in October, 2016. The said
Authority has proceeded to hear the matter an the appellant did
participate in the said proceedings, whereafter the new Award
was passed on 23rd May, 2018. In Paragraph 4 of the affidavit, it
has been stated that when these facts came to the notice of the
officials of the appellant through the Defence State Officer,
Danapur who referred the matter in the headquarters at Delhi in
the Legal Department of the Ministry of Defence, it was then
decided to take appropriate steps to challenge the order of the
learned Single Judge dated 7th May, 2014 followed by the advice
of the learned Additional Solicitor General of India in the Patna
High Court who immediately dispatched his communication for
filing of this appeal and as soon as the sanction was given on
05.12.2018
, the appeal has been filed. The explanation is that there was no intentional delay or latches keeping
in view the said background and if the delay is not condoned, it shall cause serious prejudice to the
appellant that would be saddled with a liability of great magnitude which would be against public
interest and the public exchequer. It is further stated in the affidavit that no prejudice will be caused
by condoning the delay keeping in view the important issue of law that has been raised Patna High
Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 in the appeal.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138901827/ 10
The Union Of India, Ministry Of Defence vs Arjun Yadav And Ors on 22 April, 2019
19. By way of another I.A. No. 2478 of 2018 a prayer was made for staying the operation of the
impugned judgment dated 07.05.2014. A third application has been filed being I.A. No. 2479 of
2018 seeking leave to appeal as the appellant admittedly was not a party to the writ petition even
though they were respondents to the application filed by the respondent-petitioners under Section
18 of the 1894 Act that has culminated in the passing of the new Award dated 23.05.2018. It is in
this background that the prayer has been made to condone the delay. We may put on record that
vide interim order dated 17.04.2018 a Division Bench of this Court, presided by the then Hon'ble
Chief Justice, had stayed the operation of the impugned judgment of the learned Single Judge dated
07.05.2014. By an order dated 18.12.2018, this Bench taking notice of the aforesaid fact granted
leave to appeal to the appellant and also condoned the delay in the filing of this appeal. Thus, by
vurtue of the orders dated 17th April, 2018 and 18th December, 2018, the Interlocutory Application
virtually stood disposed of by condoning the delay in the filing of the appeal and granting leave to
appeal. In this regard, one of the decisions cited at the Bar deserves mention, namely, Postmaster
General and others Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 Vs. Living Media India
Limited and another, reported in (2012) 3 SCC 563. This aspect was dealt with in the aforesaid
judgment in Paragraphs 10 to 19 that is extracted hereinunder:-
"10. Since the learned Senior Counsel for the respondents seriously objected to the
conduct of the appellants in approaching this Court after enormous and inordinate
delay of 427 days in filing the above appeals, we intend to find out whether there is
any "sufficient cause" for the condonation of such a huge delay. In view of the fact
that the application for condonation of delay in filing the SLPs dated 10.2.2011 does
not contain acceptable and plausible reasons, we permitted the appellant Postal
Department to file a better affidavit explaining the reasons for the same. Pursuant to
the same, an affidavit has been filed on 26-12-2011. After taking us through the same,
the learned Additional Solicitor General submitted that in view of series of decisions
of this Court and the appellant being a government department, delay may be
condoned and an opportunity may be given to put forth their stand as to the
impugned judgment of the High Court.
11. Before going into the reasons furnished by the Department for the delay, let us
consider various decisions of this Court relied on by Mr. Raval, learned ASG.
12. In Collector, (LA) vs. Mst. Katiji, (1987) 2 SCC 107, while considering "sufficient
Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 cause" in the light of Section 5
of the Limitation Act, 1963, this Court pointed out various principles for adopting
liberal approach in condoning the delay in matters instituted in this Court.
13. The learned Additional Solicitor General heavily relied on the following
principles:-
"(1). Ordinarily a litigant does not stand to benefit by lodging an appeal late.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138901827/ 11
The Union Of India, Ministry Of Defence vs Arjun Yadav And Ors on 22 April, 2019
(2). Refusing to condone delay can result in a meritorious matter being thrown out at
the very threshold and cause of justice being defeated. As against this when delay is
condoned the highest that can happen is that a cause would be decided on merits
after hearing the parties.
(3) 'Every day's delay must be explained' does not mean that a pedantic approach
should be made. Why not every hour's delay, every second's delay? The doctrine must
be applied in a rational common sense pragmatic manner.
(4). When substantial justice and technical considerations are pitted against each
other, cause of substantial justice deserves to be preferred for the other side cannot
claim to have vested right in injustice being done because of a non-deliberate delay.
(5). There is no presumption that delay is occasioned deliberately, or on account of
culpable negligence, or on account of mala fides. A litigant does not stand to benefit
by resorting to delay. In fact he runs a serious risk.
Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 (6). It must be grasped that judiciary is
respected not on account of its power to legalise injustice on technical grounds but because it is
capable of removing injustice and is expected to do so."
By showing the above principles, learned ASG submitted that there is no warrant for according
step-motherly treatment when the "State" is the applicant. It is relevant to mention that in that case,
the delay was only for four days.
14. In G. Ramegowda v Land Acquisition Officer, (1988) 2 SCC 142, the principles enunciated in
paras 15 and 17 are heavily relied on by the learned ASG. They are:-
"15. In litigations to which Government is a party there is yet another aspect which, perhaps, cannot
be ignored. If appeals brought by Government are lost for such defaults, no person is individually
affected; but what, in the ultimate analysis, suffers is public interest. The decisions of Government
are collective and institutional decisions and do not share the characteristics of decisions of private
individuals.
17. Therefore, in assessing what, in a particular case, constitutes 'sufficient cause' for purposes of
Section 5, it might, perhaps, be somewhat unrealistic to exclude from the considerations that go into
the judicial verdict, these factors which are peculiar to and characteristic of the functioning of the
government. Governmental Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 decisions are
proverbially slow encumbered, as they are, by a considerable degree of procedural red tape in the
process of their making."
Considering the peculiar facts, namely, the change of government pleader who had taken away the
certified copy after he ceases to be in office, the High Court condoned the delay which was affirmed
by this Court.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138901827/ 12
The Union Of India, Ministry Of Defence vs Arjun Yadav And Ors on 22 April, 2019
15. In State of Haryana v Chandra Mani and Others, (1996) 3 SCC 132 while condoning the delay of
109 days in filing the LPA before the High Court, this Court has observed that certain amount of
latitude within reasonable limits is permissible having regard to impersonal bureaucratic set-up
involving red-tapism. In the same decision, this Court directed the State to constitute legal cells to
examine whether any legal principles are involved for decision by the courts or whether cases
required adjustment at governmental level.
16. In State of U.P. and Others vs. Harish Chandra and Others, (1996) 9 SCC 309, by giving similar
reasons, as mentioned in Chandra Mani's case (supra) this Court, condoned the delay of 480 days in
filing the SLP.
17. In National Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Giga Ram and Others, (2002) 10 SCC 176, this Court, after
finding that the High Court was not justified in taking too technical a view of the facts and refusing
to condone the delay, accepted the case of the appellant insurance company by protecting the Patna
High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 interest of the claimant and condoned the delay. It
is relevant to point out that while accepting the stand of the Insurance Company for the delay, this
Court has safeguarded the interest of the claimant also.
18. In State of Nagaland vs. Lipok Ao and Others, (2005) 3 SCC 752, this Court, while reiterating the
principle that latitude be given to the Government's litigation, allowed the appeal filed by the State
of Nagaland. It is also relevant to note here that this matter relates to criminal jurisdiction and delay
in filing the SLP was only 57 days.
19. Though the learned ASG heavily relied on the abovesaid decisions and the principles laid down,
on going through all the factual details, we are of the view that there is no quarrel about the
propositions inferred therein. However, considering the peculiar facts and circumstances of each
case, this Court either condoned the delay or upheld the order of the High Court condoning the
delay in filing appeal by the State. While keeping those principles in mind, let us consider the
reasonings placed by the Postal Department with regard to the same."
20. The issue as to whether what would be sufficient cause particularly in matters relating to appeals
to be filed on behalf of the State or the Union of India, it was held as follows in Paragraphs 21 to 24:-
Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019
"21. Before considering whether the reasons for justifying such a huge delay are acceptable or not, it
is also useful to refer the decisions relied on by Mr. Soli J.
Sorabjee, learned senior counsel for the respondents.
22. In CWT V. Amateur Riders Club, 1994 Supp (2) SCC 603, there was a delay of 264 days in filing
the SLP by the Commissioner of Wealth Tax, Bombay.
The explanation for the delay had been set out in the petitioner's own words as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138901827/ 13
The Union Of India, Ministry Of Defence vs Arjun Yadav And Ors on 22 April, 2019
"2...... (g) The Advocate-
on-Record got the special leave petition drafted from the drafting Advocate and sent
the same for approval to the Board on 24.6.1993 along with the case file.
(h) The Board returned the case file to the Advocate-on-
Record on July 9-7-1993 who re- sent the same to the Board on September 20.9.1993
requesting that draft SLP was not approved by the Board. The Board after approving
the draft SLP sent this file to CAS on October 1-10- 1993."
After incorporating the above explanation, this Court refused to condone the delay by
Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 observing thus:
"3. ... Having regard to the law of limitation which binds everybody, we cannot find
any way of granting relief. It is true that the Government should not be treated as any
other private litigant as, indeed, in the case of the former the decisions to present and
prosecute appeals are not individual but are institutional decisions necessarily
bogged down by the proverbial red-tape. But there are limits to this also.
Even with all this latitude, the explanation offered for the delay in this case merely
serves to aggravate the attitude of indifference of the Revenue in protecting its
common interests. The affidavit is again one of the stereotyped affidavits making it
susceptible to the criticism that the Revenue does not seem to attach any importance
to the need for promptitude even where it affects its own interest.
[Emphasis supplied]
23. In Pundlik Jalam Patil v. Jalgaon Medium Project, (2008) 17 SC 448, the Patna
High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 question was whether the
respondent- Executive Engineer, Jalgaon Medium Project had shown sufficient cause
to condone the delay of 1724 days in filing appeals before the High Court. In para 17,
this Court held:
"17.....The evidence on record suggests neglect of its own right for long time in
preferring appeals. The court cannot enquire into belated and stale claims on the
ground of equity. Delay defeats equity. The court helps those who are vigilant and "do
not slumber over their rights".
24. After referring various earlier decisions, taking very lenient view in condoning the
delay, particularly, on the part of the Government and the Government Undertaking,
this Court observed as under:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138901827/ 14
The Union Of India, Ministry Of Defence vs Arjun Yadav And Ors on 22 April, 2019
"29. It needs no restatement at our hands that the object for fixing time-limit for
litigation is based on public policy fixing a lifespan for legal remedy for the purpose of
general welfare. They are meant to see that the parties do not Patna High Court L.P.A
No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 resort to dilatory tactics but avail their legal remedies
promptly. Salmond in his Jurisprudence states that the laws come to the assistance of
the vigilant and not of the sleepy.
30. Public interest undoubtedly is a paramount consideration in exercising the
courts' discretion wherever conferred upon it by the relevant statutes. Pursuing stale
claims and multiplicity of proceedings in no manner subserves public interest.
Prompt and timely payment of compensation to the landlosers facilitating their
rehabilitation/resettlement is equally an integral part of public policy. Public interest
demands that the State or the beneficiary of acquisition, as the case may be, should
not be allowed to indulge in any act to unsettle the settled legal rights accrued in law
by resorting to avoidable litigation unless the claimants are guilty of deriving benefit
to which they are otherwise not entitled, in any fraudulent Patna High Court L.P.A
No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 manner. One should not forget the basic fact that what
is acquired is not the land but the livelihood of the landlosers.
These public interest parameters ought to be kept in mind by the courts while
exercising the discretion dealing with the application filed under Section 5 of the
Limitation Act. Dragging the landlosers to courts of law years after the termination of
legal proceedings would not serve any public interest. Settled rights cannot be lightly
interfered with by condoning inordinate delay without there being any proper
explanation of such delay on the ground of involvement of public revenue. It serves
no public interest."
21. Having considered the aforesaid submissions, it is correct that settled rights should not be
unsettled on account of such delay unless there is some valid explanation. By the passage of the time
prescribed for filing of an appeal, an appropriate explanation is required that may be not strictly a
day-today explanation but there has to be a plausible explanation Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of
2018 dt.22-04-2019 so as to justify the cause in the delay. What we find in the instant case and as
pointed out by Shri S.D. Sanjay, learned Additional Solicitor General of India that a written
statement, which is most casually drafted on behalf of the Union of India through its counsel Shri
Harischandra Prasad dated 24.04.2017, was filed before the Presiding Officer of the Land
Acquisition Rehabilitation and Re-settlement Authority, Patna. Thus, the aforesaid fact, therefore,
establishes that the appellant Union of India had the knowledge of the judgment of the learned
Single Judge in the year 2016 itself, but it was attended to very casually. A new Award was prepared
by the Presiding Officer on 09.05.2017 and when the matter went into execution, the order- sheet
dated 22.11.2017 indicates that the earlier counsel Shri Harish Chandra Prasad had been conducting
the matter and the new counsel who took over informed the Court that no appropriate objection has
been filed to the executive proceedings and a prayer was made to grant more time. In the
order-sheet dated 1st of January, 2018 it is apparent that the Defence Department filed an
application and it was recorded by the Court that so far as the State of Bihar is concerned, it had
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138901827/ 15
The Union Of India, Ministry Of Defence vs Arjun Yadav And Ors on 22 April, 2019
been filing applications for adjournments and time was sought by the Defence Department, Union
of India on account of Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 change of counsel.
Accordingly, the matter was adjourned and then again a date was fixed on 10th April, 2019.
22. The executive case, therefore, appears to have proceeded in spite of the stay order dated 17 th
April, 2018 in this appeal.
23. The usual bureaucratic approach in dealing with such serious matters is evident in this case as
well. The lawyer of the Union of India in the court below who was conducting the case does not
appear to have seriously pursued the matter and it is only after it was brought to the notice of the
learned Assistant Solicitor General of India in the High Court that the entire machinery was set into
motion for taking up appropriate steps in the matter. It is in this background that it would be apt to
refer to the six principles that were dealt with by the Apex Court in the case of Collector (Land
Acquisition) Vs. Katiji, reported in (1987) 2 SCC 107 that has been dealt with and the ratio whereof
has been quoted in the judgment of Postmaster General (supra), extracted hereinabove. Applying
the aforesaid principles, we find that the said judgment concludes in Paragraphs 27 to 30 that is
extracted hereinunder:-
"27. It is not in dispute that the person(s) concerned were well aware or conversant
with the issues involved Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019
including the prescribed period of limitation for taking up the matter by way of filing
a special leave petition in this Court. They cannot claim that they have a separate
period of limitation when the Department was possessed with competent persons
familiar with court proceedings. In the absence of plausible and acceptable
explanation, we are posing a question why the delay is to be condoned mechanically
merely because the Government or a wing of the Government is a party before us.
28. Though we are conscious of the fact that in a matter of condonation of delay when
there was no gross negligence or deliberate inaction or lack of bona fides, a liberal
concession has to be adopted to advance substantial justice, we are of the view that in
the facts and circumstances, the Department cannot take advantage of various earlier
decisions. The claim on account of impersonal machinery and inherited bureaucratic
methodology of making several notes cannot be accepted in view of the modern
technologies being used and available. The law of limitation undoubtedly binds
everybody, including the Government.
29. In our view, it is the right time to inform all the government bodies, Patna High
Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 their agencies and instrumentalities that
unless they have reasonable and acceptable explanation for the delay and there was
bona fide effort, there is no need to accept the usual explanation that the file was kept
pending for several months/years due to considerable degree of procedural red-tape
in the process. The government departments are under a special obligation to ensure
that they perform their duties with diligence and commitment. Condonation of delay
is an exception and should not be used as an anticipated benefit for the government
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138901827/ 16
The Union Of India, Ministry Of Defence vs Arjun Yadav And Ors on 22 April, 2019
departments. The law shelters everyone under the same light and should not be
swirled for the benefit of a few.
30. Considering the fact that there was no proper explanation offered by the
Department for the delay except mentioning of various dates, according to us, the
Department has miserably failed to give any acceptable and cogent reasons sufficient
to condone such a huge delay. Accordingly, the appeals are liable to be dismissed on
the ground of delay."
24. Thus, the conclusion drawn by the Supreme Court was not to grant any indulgence merely
because the delay Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 by a Government
Department. However, in the present case, what we find is that as soon as the matter was brought to
the notice of the Union of India, they did take appropriate steps immediately. The presumption that
the Union of India was assisted by competent persons familiar with court proceedings does not
appear to be available here keeping in view the nature of the application of Shri Harishchandra
Prasad, the advocate of the Union of India in the court below. We have perused the said affidavit
which has been filed along with the counter affidavit of the respondents and we find that it does not
have even approval or sanction of the appropriate authorities of the Defence Department and
appears to have been drawn up by Shri Harish Chandra Prasad and filed in a cavalier fashion. In this
background, the case of substantial justice would definitely suffer, inasmuch as, in the present case
what has happened is that in the garb of the new proceedings pursuant to the impugned judgment,
the enhancement of the compensation is from Rs. 1410.84 per decimal to Rs. 1,20,000/- per
decimal, which is almost 80 times enhancement. Order-sheet also shows the laxity on the part of the
State of Bihar in not filing appropriate affidavits and contest the matter which also went on casually.
We may not be able to assume an active collusion, but Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018
dt.22-04-2019 at the same time, the manner in which the case has been contested with the State of
Bihar in not even participating in the Section 30 proceedings and not even contesting the matter
appropriately after remand from the High Court speaks volumes of their attitude of a passive
participation. The Union of India is not less to blame, as is evident from the facts stated above after
having knowledge of the judgment of the High Court, but the fact remains that the Union of India at
least has a plausible explanation to the extent that it was not made a party to the writ petition which
was deliberate on the part of the respondent- petitioners in spite of the fact that the appellants were
a party of their Section 18 application. We also find that the learned Single Judge was not justified at
all in allowing the writ petition without the impleadment of the Union of India and consequently,
the administrative mayhem that was caused which is a combination of the circumstances indicated
above the Union of India has at least come up in this appeal with an explanation where the delay
cannot be stated to be deliberate or any culpable negligence on the part of the appellant though the
conduct of the counsel appearing before the court below after the judgment was made known is
reprehensible. Public interest should not be allowed to suffer on account of any such delay being
caused due Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 to default on the part of the
lawyer who could have informed the Assistant Solicitor General of India earlier or his higher
authorities about the urgency of the matter. This casual approach, therefore, may be a default but so
far as the appellant is concerned, it has made its best efforts to approach this Court and we are,
therefore, of the considered opinion that the delay deserves to be condoned in entertaining this
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138901827/ 17
The Union Of India, Ministry Of Defence vs Arjun Yadav And Ors on 22 April, 2019
appeal, which has been rightly done under the orders passed by this Court referred to above.
25. The second preliminary objection is that the appellant has suppressed facts about its
participation before the court below and the executive proceedings while filing this appeal. It is
correct that the order-sheet as already referred to above does record that the appellant had come to
know of the judgment of the High Court and had participated in the proceedings of the court below,
but it has already been noted above that the conduct of the counsel who filed the affidavit before the
court below and the manner in which the case was attended to indicates the slackness on the part of
the legal machinery employed by the Union of India in the court below. This fact may not have been
explained in detail, but as noted above, the affidavit filed in support of I.A. No. 2477 of 2018 Patna
High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 admits the proceedings of the court below and its
disclosure in Paragraphs 3 to 9 thereof. The appellant, therefore, cannot be said to have suppressed
any material fact, even though the details thereof have not been stated and which has been brought
on record through the order-sheet of the court below filed by the respondent-petitioners in their
counter affidavit. This, therefore, does not amount to any suppresio Veri or suggestio falsi so as to
construe that the appellants had succeeded in getting this appeal entertained with an interim order
on 17.04.2018 or by getting the delay condoned and permission to file appeal by suppressing any
material facts. The second objection is also, therefore, untenable.
26. The third ground which was urged and vehemently contended by Shri Mrigank Mauli is that the
appellant was rightly not made a party in the writ petition as the appellant was neither a proper or a
necessary party in a matter arising out of condonation of delay for entertaining an application under
Section 18 of the 1894 Act. It was urged that neither the appellant was a proper or necessary party
and even otherwise, in an application under Section 18 where the question of limitation is involved.
The appellant not being an interested person at that stage having only a commercial interest was
Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 rightly not impleaded in the writ petition.
Shri Mrigank Mauli contends that it is only after a Section 18 application is entertained and notices
are issued then only in order to lead any evidence with regard to quantum of compensation or
otherwise can be led by an interested person and it is at that stage that the participation of the
appellant that may be necessary. That stage had not yet arrived and, therefore, the appellant had
absolutely no cause to plead or oppose the issue of limitation in the application filed by the
respondent-petitioners. For this, he has invited the attention of the Court to the definition of the
phrase "person interested" as contained in Section 3(b) of the 1894 Act, which is extracted
hereinunder:-
"3(b) the expression "person interested" includes all persons claiming an interest in
compensation to be made on account of the acquisition of land under this Act; and a
person shall be deemed to be interested in land if he is interested in an easement
affecting the land."
27. He has then referred to Section 18 of the said Act, which is also reproduced hereinunder:-
"18. Reference to Court.- (1) Any person interested who has not Patna High Court
L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 accepted the award may, by written application
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138901827/ 18
The Union Of India, Ministry Of Defence vs Arjun Yadav And Ors on 22 April, 2019
to the Collector, require that the matter be referred by the Collector for the
determination of the Court, whether his objection be to the measurement of the land,
the amount of the compensation, the persons to whom it is payable, or the
apportionment of the compensation among the persons interested.
(2) The application shall state the grounds on which objection to the award is taken:
Provided that every such application shall be made,-
(a) If the person making it was present or represented before the Collector at the time
when he made his award, within six weeks from the date of the Collector's award;
(b) in other cases, within six weeks of the receipt of the notice from the Collector
under section 12, sub-
Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 section (2), or within six months from the
date of the Collector's award, whichever period shall first expire."
28. It is urged that Section 18 is a stage where the Collector passes an administrative order for
referring and adjudicating a reference thereunder for being decided by the Court in terms of Section
19 of the Act. It is at the stage of Section 19 that a notice will be served on the applicant or all
persons interested in the objection except those who have consented without protest.
29. Sections 19, 20 and 21 of the 1894 Act are extracted hereinunder:-
"19. Collector's statement to the Court.-
(1) In making the reference, the Collector shall state for the information of the Court,
in writing under his hand,-
(a) the situation and extent of the land, with particulars of any trees, buildings or
standing crops thereon;
(b) the names of the persons whom he has reason to think interested in such land;
Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019
(c) the amount awarded for damages and paid or tendered under sections 5 and 17, or either of
them, and the amount of compensation awarded under section 11;
(cc) the amount paid or deposited under sub- section (3-A) of section 17; and
(d) if the objection be to the amount of the compensation, the grounds on which the amount of
compensation was determined.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138901827/ 19
The Union Of India, Ministry Of Defence vs Arjun Yadav And Ors on 22 April, 2019
(2) To the said statement shall be attached a schedule giving the particulars of the notices served
upon, and of the statements in writing made or delivered by the parties interested respectively.
20. Service of notice.- The Court shall thereupon cause a notice specifying the day on which the
Court will proceed to determine the objection, and directing their appearance before the Court on
that day, to be served on the following persons, namely:-
(a) the applicant;
(b) all persons interested in the objection, Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018
dt.22-04-2019 except such (if any) of them as have consented without protest to
receive payment of the compensation awarded; and
(c) if the objection is in regard to the area of the land or to the amount of the
compensation, the Collector.
21. Restriction on scope of proceedings.-The scope of the inquiry in every such proceeding shall be
restricted to a consideration of the interests of the persons affected by the objection."
30. This issue has to be decided simultaneously with the issue as to whether the appellant is an
interested person or not. From the facts stated in detail and noted by us hereinabove, we may first
begin with the nature of the objection raised by Shri Mrigank Mauli. He submits that at the stage of
considering the limitation of Section 18, the appellant is not a person having any interest, inasmuch
as, a commercial interest cannot be made the basis for opposing an application under Section 18.
For this, he has relied on some of the judgments of the Supreme Court that have been dealt with by a
Division Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 Bench of the Allahabad High Court
in the case of Gorakhpur Development Authority Gorakhpur Vs. District Judge, Gorakhpur and
other, reported in A.I.R. 1991 Allahabad
241. That was a case where the acquisition was for local authority and the provisions of Section
50(2) had to be taken into consideration.
31. Section 50(2) of the 1894 Act is extracted hereinunder:-
"50(2). In any proceeding held before a Collector or Court in such cases the local
authority or company concerned may appear and adduce evidence for the purpose of
determining the amount of compensation:
Provided that no such local authority or company shall be entitled to demand a
reference under section 18."
32. The same categorically recites that a local authority or a company shall not be entitled to
demand a reference under Section 18 but the company of the local authority may appear and adduce
evidence. We may indicate that the said decision was in relation to an acquisition of a local authority
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138901827/ 20
The Union Of India, Ministry Of Defence vs Arjun Yadav And Ors on 22 April, 2019
whereas in the present case acquisition for the Union of India. Another decision in the case of Delhi
Development Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 Authority Vs. Bhola Nath
Sharma (Dead) by LRS. And Others, reported in (2011) 2 SCC 54 has been cited where again it was a
case relating to the Delhi Development Authority which is a local authority. However, the said
decision went on to rule that the phrase "person interested" is inclusive and not exhaustive. In
another case of the Apex Court Santosh Kumar and others Vs. Central Warehousing Corporation
and another, reported in AIR 1986 Supreme Court 1164 it was held that a company cannot challenge
the amount of compensation through a writ petition in view of the bar contained in Section 50(2) of
the 1894 Act. As to who is a proper and necessary party, the following judgments have been cited at
the Bar:
(i) Kasturi Vs. Iyyamperumal and others, reported in (2005) 6 SCC 733;
(ii) Bara Hanuman Temple Durgain, Amritsar Vs. Gurbux Lal Malhotra and others,
reported in AIR 1978 Punjab and Haryana 192;
(iii) Kaka Singh Vs. Rohi Singh and others, reported in A.I.R. 1978 Punjab and
Haryana 30 and
(iv) Ramesh Hirachand Kundanmal Vs. Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay
and others, Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 reported in (1992)
2 SCC 524.
33. We may, however, now refer to those decisions which shed light as to when the acquisition is
carried out for in such public parties then who would be a person interested or a proper and
necessary party. In this regard, an earlier Supreme Court judgment in the case of Himalaya Tiles
and Marble (P.) Ltd. Vs. Francis Victor Coutinho (dead) by LR's, reported in AIR 1980 Supreme
Court 1118 ruled that when a land is acquired for a Company and it has to pay a compensation under
agreement then it becomes an interested person. For this, we may extract hereunder Paragraphs 6
to 13 of the said judgment:-
"6. Before, however, deciding the question as to whether or not the proceedings taken
under Section 4 were cured by the amending Act, we would first deal with the
contention of Dr. Chitale that the High Court was wrong in holding that the company
had no locus standi to file an appeal before the Letters Patent Bench.
Learned counsel submitted that the definition of person interested in Section 18 is an
inclusive one and is wide enough to include the appellant for whose benefit the land
was acquired and who had to pay the entire compensation in accordance with the
agreement entered into by the Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019
Government with the appellant. He argued that it could not be said that the appellant
was not interested in defending the acquisition or in the quantum of compensation
which was to be awarded by the Court on a Reference made by the Collector. The
High Court was of the view that as the land was acquired by the Government, the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138901827/ 21
The Union Of India, Ministry Of Defence vs Arjun Yadav And Ors on 22 April, 2019
company had no interest in the same and was, therefore, not entitled either to appear
or to defend the proceedings before the court. In order to decide this question it may
be necessary to extract the relevant part of Section 18(1) which runs thus:-
"18(1). Any person interested who has not accepted the award may, by written
application to the Collector, require that the matter be referred by the Collector for
the determination of the Court, whether his objection be to the measurement of the
land, the amount of the compensation, the persons to whom it is payable, or the
apportionment of the compensation among the persons interested."
7. It seems to us that the definition of 'a Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019
person interested' given in Sec. 18 is an inclusive definition and must be liberally construed so as to
embrace all persons who may be directly or indirectly interested either in the title to the land or in
the quantum of compensation. In the instant case, it is not disputed that the lands were actually
acquired for the purpose of the company and once the land vested in the Government, after
acquisition, it stood transferred to the company under the agreement entered into between the
company and the Government.
Thus, it cannot be said that the company had no claim or title to the land at all.
Secondly, since under the agreement the company had to pay the compensation, it was most
certainly interested in seeing that a proper quantum of compensation was fixed so that the company
may not have to pay a very heavy amount of money. For this purpose, the company could
undoubtedly appear and adduce evidence on the question of the quantum of compensation.
8. So far as this aspect of matter is concerned, there appears to be a general consensus of judicial
opinion that even though the company may not have any title to the property yet it certainly has a
right to Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 appear and put forward its case in
the matter of determination of the quantum of compensation. In the case of Sunder Lal v.
Paramsukhdas, (1968) (l) SCR 362, this Court observed as follows:
"It will be noticed that it is an inclusive definition. It is not necessary that in order to
fall within the definition a person should claim an interest in land, which has been
acquired. A person becomes a person interested if he claims an interest in
compensation to be awarded.
It seems to us that Paramsukhdas is a "person interested" within Sec. 3(b) of the Act
because he claims an interest in compensation.
..... ...... ...... ...... .... It seems to us that Paramsukhdas was clearly a person interested
in the objections which were pending before the Court in the references made to it
and that he was also a person whose interest would be affected by the objections,
within Sec. 2l. He was accordingly entitled to be made a party."

Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019
9. In the case of The Hindustan Sanitaryware and Industries Ltd.
Bhadurgarh v. The State of Haryana, AIR 1972 Punj and Har 59. Pandit. J.
observed as follows:-
"From the facts stated above, it is apparent that the compensation amount has to be
paid by the two companies. If the said amount is increased by the learned Additional
District Judge on a reference under section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act, it would
be the two companies who would be prejudiced .... No authority even was cited by
him that under similar circumstances any Court had ever held that the persons, who
had actually to pay the compensation, could not be allowed to lead evidence and say
that the compensation amount be not enhanced."
10. In the case of Comilla Electric Supple Ltd. v. East Bengal Bank Ltd., Comila, AIR 1939 Cal 669,
while the High Court took the view that the company for whose benefit the land was acquired may
not strictly be an interested person yet it had undoubtedly a right to appear and adduce Patna High
Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 evidence on the quantum of compensation. In this
connection, Mukherjea, J. observed thus:-
"Section 50, cl. (2) purports to remedy this disability and it lays down that in any
proceeding held before a Collector or Court in such cases the local authority or
company concerned may appear and adduce evidence for the purpose of determining
the amount of compensation. The reason is plain. It is the company or the local
authority who has got to pay the money in such cases and it would be unjust to deny
them the right would have a bearing on the amount of the compensation money."
Roxburgh, j. made the following observations:-
"Thus the first question for decision is clearly settled by the above decision and there
can be no doubt that in the circumstances at present being considered the company is
a person interested, as defined in the Act, and is entitled to require Patna High Court
L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 a reference under Section 18 unless that right is
restricted by the terms of the proviso to Section 50(2)."
11. In the case of M. Kuppuswami v. The Special Tahsildar, (1967) 1 Mad LJ 329, Venkatadri, J.
interpreting the definition of 'interested person' observed as follows:-
"The only question for consideration therefore is whether the petitioner is a person interested, as
defined in Sec.
3(b) of the Land Acquisition Act.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138901827/ 23
The Union Of India, Ministry Of Defence vs Arjun Yadav And Ors on 22 April, 2019
The definition section says that the expression 'person interested' includes all persons claiming an
interest in compensation to be made on account of the acquisition of land under the Act.
The expression 'person interested' is very comprehensive and it does not profess to give an
exhaustive definition. The expression 'person interested' has been interpreted by various Courts,
and the trend of the opinion seems to be that I should give a liberal interpretation ...
On a review of the case-law on Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 the subject, it
seems to me that the expression 'person interested' does not require that a person must really have
an interest in the land sought to be acquired. It is enough if he claims an interest in compensation,
as distinguished from an interest in the property sought to be acquired. As long as a person claims
an interest in the compensation, he is a person interested within the meaning of the definition of
that expression."
12. The only case which appears to have taken a contrary view is a Division Bench decision of the
Orissa High Court in the case of State of Orissa v. Amarandra Pratap Singh, AIR 1967 Orissa 180,
where the High Court held that the expression 'person interested' did not include a local authority or
a company on whose behalf acquisition is made by the State. At the same time, it was clearly held
that it was open to the company in any proceeding before the Collector or court to appear and
adduce evidence for the purpose of determining the amount of compensation.
13. Thus, the preponderance of judicial Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019
opinion seems to favour the view that the definition of 'person interested' must be liberally
construed so as to include a body, local authority, or a company for whose benefit the land is
acquired and who is bound under an agreement to pay the compensation. In our opinion, this view
accords with the principles of equity, justice and good conscience. How can it be said that a person
for whose benefit the land is acquired and who is to pay the compensation is not a person interested
even though its stake may be extremely vital ? For instance, the land acquisition proceeding may be
held to be invalid and thus a person concerned is completely deprived of the benefit which is
proposed to be given to him. Similarly, if such a person is not heard by the Collector or a court, he
may have to pay a very heavy compensation which, in case he is allowed to appear before a court, he
could have satisfied it that it the compensation was far too heavy having regard to the nature and
extent of the land. We are, therefore, unable to agree with the view taken by the Orissa High Court
or even by the Calcutta High Court that a company, local authority or a person for whose benefit the
land is Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 acquired is not an interested person.
We are satisfied that such a person is vitally interested both in the title to the property and also in
the compensation to be paid therefor because both these factors concern its future course of action
and if decided against him, seriously prejudice his rights. Moreover, in view of the decision of this
Court referred to above, we hold that the appellant was undoubtedly a person interested as
contemplated by S. 18(1) of the Act. The High Court, therefore, committed an error in throwing out
the appeal of the appellant on the ground that it had no locus to file an appeal before the Bench."
34. The aforesaid judgment was approved by the Apex Court in the case of Union of India Vs. Sher
Singh and others, reported in (1993) 1 SCC 608. This decision assumes importants in the present
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138901827/ 24
The Union Of India, Ministry Of Defence vs Arjun Yadav And Ors on 22 April, 2019
case as this was a case where the land had been acquired for the Union of India and where also it
was held that the Union of India was a proper and necessary party being an interested person.
35. Paragraphs 9 to 11 of the judgment is extracted hereinunder:-
Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 "9. In the case in hand before
us, it is an admitted position that the State of Haryana acquired the land in District
Gurgaon for the benefit of National Security Guard as desired by the Union of India.
The land owners including the respondents of the present case filed reference
petitions under Section 18 of the Act. During the pendency of the reference
application before the Additional District Judge, Gurgaon, an application was moved
by the Union of India through Deputy Inspector General, National Security Guard for
being impleaded as respondents on the ground that the land had been acquired for
the purpose of National Security Guard. It was submitted in the application that the
interest of the applicant Union of India will adversely suffer in case the rate of
compensation was enhanced and it would also be deprived of an opportunity to file
an appeal in case Union of India is not impleaded as a party. The Additional District
Judge declined to implead the Union of India as a party. A revision application was
dismissed by the High Court by the impugned order dated May 24 1989. The High
Court in the impugned order took the view that the matter stands concluded by the
Full Bench judgment in Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 the
case of Kulbhushan Kumar & Co. case.
10. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and have thoroughly perused the
record. It was contended on behalf of the appellant Union of India that the Central
Government is neither a company nor a firm and as such the Full Bench judgment of
the High Court relied upon in the impugned order has no application in the instant
case. The Central Government has no machinery of its own for acquiring of land and
as such it had to depend upon the State Government for the above purpose.
However, the financial implication with regard to the payment of compensation is to be borne by the
Central Government. It was contended that the point is fully covered by the decision of this Court in
the case of Himalayan Tiles & Marbles. It was also submitted that in the meantime the learned
Additional District Judge, Gurgaon by its order dated January 17, 1990 has decided the reference
and has enhanced the compensation. It was submitted that a great injustice has been done to the
appellant as it has not been given an opportunity to contest the order of enhanced compensation
and in view of the fact that its application for impleadment has been dismissed, it has been left with
no remedy Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 of filing an appeal against the
judgment of the learned Additional District Judge, enhancing the compensation.
11. On the other hand, it was contended on behalf of the respondent-land-owners that the learned
Single Judge of the High Court passing the impugned order dated My 24, 1989 was bound by the
Full Bench decision of the said court and there was no infirmity in taking such view. It was further
contended that even if there was a conflict between the two decisions of this Court in the Municipal
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138901827/ 25
The Union Of India, Ministry Of Defence vs Arjun Yadav And Ors on 22 April, 2019
Corporation of the City of Ahmedabad v. Chandulal Shamaldas Patel and in Himalayan Tiles &
Marbles (P) Ltd. Case both by Division Bench comprising of two Hon'ble Judges, the conflict can
only be resolved by referring the case to a larger Bench of this Court."
36. The judgment in the case of Himalaya Tiles and Marble (supra) was again approved by a Five
Judges Constitution Bench in the case of U.P. Awas Evam Vikas Parishad Vs. Gyan Devi (Dead) by
LRS. and others, reported in (1995) 2 SCC 326 where it was explained that the judgments in the case
of Union of India Vs. Sher Singh (supra), the judgment in the case of Union of India Vs. Kolluni
Ramaiah, Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 reported in (1994) 1 SCC 367 an
the judgment in the case of Himalayan Tiles and Marble (supra) correctly interpreted the phrase
"person interested" and approved the law laid down in the said cases. It then went on to reiterate the
law of the Apex Court in the case of Udit Narain Singh Malpaharia Vs. Additional Member, Board of
Revenue, reported in 1963 Supp (1) SCR 676: AIR 1963 Supreme Court 786 to hold that the law is
well settled that a necessary party is one without whom no order can be made effectively and a
proper party is one in whose absence an effective order can be made but whose presence is
necessary for a complete and final decision of the question involved in the proceedings.
37. From the definition of the phrase "person interested" and the ratio of the judgment in the case of
Union of India Vs. Sher Singh (supra) read with the judgment in the case of Himalayan Tiles and
Marble (supra) as approved by the Constitution Bench in the case of U.P. Awas Evam Vikas Parishad
(supra) it is evident that in the instant case the land was acquired for setting up of an ordinance
factory by the Union of India. It is not disputed that the amount of 80 per cent had already been
deposited when the approval had been given and 100 per cent by the time the entire Award was
pronounced. Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 Thus, the Union of India was at
the receiving end of making payments. In the present case, as noticed above, the enhancement on
account of the impugned judgment of the High Court has resulted in 80 times escalation. In this
circumstance, there can be no doubt that the Union of India was not only a proper but also a
necessary party, inasmuch as, the impugned judgment did not only decide the issue of limitation of
the application under Section 18 but has also gone to hold that the Award of the year 2001 was in
effect not an Award and accordingly directed the authorities to pass a fresh Award. The round about
away manner in which the application under Section 18 was found to be entertainable after treating
it to be within time from the date of the order under Section 30 of the Act, that too, even after 13
years of the Award of 2001, it cannot be said that the Union of India was not a proper or a necessary
party for the purpose of at least contesting the writ petition before this Court. It is also not
understood as to why the respondent petitioners in spite of having made the appellant a party in the
application under Section 18 of the 1894 Act, did not choose to implead the same parties in the writ
petition. This was, therefore, a deliberate omission on the part of the respondent petitioners and
which omission ought to have taken Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 notice of
and rectified by the learned Single Judge. It is only thereafter that any opinion could have been
expressed on the issue of the status of the Award. We will deal with the issue relating to the status of
the Award later, but for the purpose as to whether the Union of India is a proper or a necessary
party or not, we in view of the aforesaid discussion hold that the appellant Union of India had been
rightly arrayed as a proper and necessary party in the application under Section 18 which was
deliberately avoided in the writ petition for reasons best known to the respondent-petitioners and,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138901827/ 26
The Union Of India, Ministry Of Defence vs Arjun Yadav And Ors on 22 April, 2019
therefore, the writ petition being allowed in the absence of the appellant vitiates the impugned
judgment. The appellant was very much a person interested apart from being a proper and
necessary party in the light of the discussion of the law as referred to in the decisions of the Apex
Court quoted hereinabove. The branding of the interest of the appellant as only a commercial
interest by the respondent-petitioners is not at all justified because this interest is not a pure
commercial interest but a vital public interest involving a huge exchequer of the tax payers money
where the Union of India sought to be saddled with compensation 80 times more than what was
awarded. For all this, the appellant is a person interested and, therefore, a proper and necessary
party. Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 The impugned judgment, therefore,
deserves to be set aside on this ground alone that it was passed ex parte to the appellant.
38. Having held and overruled the preliminary objections as raised hereinabove, we now proceed to
consider the other arguments raised on behalf of the learned counsel for the parties.
39. We now come to the argument raised by the learned counsel for the respondent-petitioners
about the limitation and maintainability of the application under Section 18 of the Act. For this, the
primary ground of attack as pleaded in the writ petition is that the proceedings dated 12 th June,
2001 is not an Award and, therefore, the application under Section 18 was well within time. In the
instant case, the learned Single Judge in order to decide the issue of limitation took upon itself the
task to determine the status of the proceedings dated 12th of June, 2001 as being not an Award. At
the same time, before the learned Single Judge it was held that the Award became complete only
when effect was given by the authorities to the order of the Civil Court upon a reference upon
apportionment under Section 30 of the Act. For this, the learned Single Judge relied on the fact that
the State of Bihar issued a notice under Section 12(2) of the 1894 Act after the order was passed
under Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 Section 30 in a reference that was
decided on 30th January, 2010. The notice under Section 12(2) numbering the apportioned Award
in favour of the appellant as Award No. 60 Y was issued on 24.05.2010. The objection, therefore,
was rightly made on 2 nd of June, 2010. The learned Single Judge, therefore, instead of deciding the
issue of limitation came to the conclusion that since there was no Award at all and it was a
purported Award, therefore, it is only after the notice under Section 12(2) that was issued on
24.04.2010 that the respondent-petitioners gave a fresh cause to file a reference under Section 18.
The learned Single Judge also held that no notice had been issued under Section 12(2) after the
proceedings dated 12.06.2001 and, therefore, it was a purported Award. The awardees for the first
time identified after the order passed in Section 30 proceedings and it is, therefore, at that stage that
the cause to file an application under Section 18 had arisen which was obviously in the year 2010
and not in the year 2001.
40. For this Shri Mrigank Mauli has urged that the learned Single Judge was right in construing that
the proceedings dated 12th June, 2001 was only a purported Award and not an Award. We have
been unable to gather any help either from the Act or any other judgment as to what would be a
Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 purported Award. To us, it appears that
Section 11 of the Act clearly defines an Award, which is extracted hereinunder:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138901827/ 27
The Union Of India, Ministry Of Defence vs Arjun Yadav And Ors on 22 April, 2019
"11. Enquiry and award by Collector- [(1)]On the day so fixed, or on any other day to
which the enquiry has been adjourned, the Collector shall proceed to enquire into the
objection (if any) which any person interested has stated pursuant to a notice given
under section 9 to the measurements made under section 8, and into the value of the
land [at the date of the publication of the notification under section 4, sub-section
(1)], and into the respective interest of the persons claiming the compensation and
shall make an award under his hand of-
(I) The true area of the land;
(ii) the compensation which in his opinion should be allowed for the land; and
(iii) the appointment of the said compensation among all the persons known or
believed to be interested in the land, of whom, or of whose Patna High Court L.P.A
No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 claims, he has information, whether or not they have
respectively appeared before him:
[Provided that no award shall be made by the Collector under this sub-section
without the previous approval of the appropriate Government or of such officer as the
appropriate Government may authorise in this behalf:
Provided further that it shall be competent for the appropriate Government to direct
that the Collector may make such award without such approval in such class of cases
as the appropriate Government may specify in this behalf.] [(2) Notwithstanding,
anything, contained in sub-section (1), if at any stage of the proceedings, the Collector
is satisfied that all the persons interested in the land who appeared before him have
agreed in writing on the matters to be included in the award of the Collector in the
form prescribed by rules made by the appropriate Government, he may, Patna High
Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 without making further enquiry, make an
award according to the terms of such agreement.
(3) The determination of compensation for any land under sub-section (2) shall not
in any way affect the determination of compensation in respect of other lands in the
same locality or elsewhere in accordance with the other provisions of this Act.
(4) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Registration Act, 1908 (16 of 1908),
no agreement made under sub-section (2) shall be liable to registration under that
Act.]"
41. The Award of a Collector is an offer and for that the learned counsel for the respondent has cited
judgment in the case of Mrs. Khorshed Shapoor Chenai etc. Vs. Assistant Controller of Estate Duty,
A.P. etc., reported in A.I.R. 1980 Supreme Court 775. The relevant portion of Paragraph 11 of the
said judgment is extracted hereinunder:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138901827/ 28
The Union Of India, Ministry Of Defence vs Arjun Yadav And Ors on 22 April, 2019
"11. In our opinion the High Court was right in holding that there are no two separate
rights- one a right to receive Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019
compensation and other a right to receive extra or further compensation. Upon
acquisition of his lands under the Land Acquisition Act the claimant has only one
right, which is, to receive compensation for the lands at their market value on the
date of the relevant notification and it is this right which is quantified by the Collector
under S.11 and by the Civil Court under S.26 of the Land Acquisition Act. It is true
that under S.11 the Collector after holding the necessary inquiry determines the
quantum of compensation by fixing the market value of the land and in doing so is
guided by the provisions contained in Sections 23 and 24 of the Act- the very
provisions by reference to which the Civil Court fixes the valuation. It is also true that
the Collector's award is, under Section 12, declared to be, except as otherwise
provided, final and conclusive evidence as between him and the persons interested.
Even so, it is well settled that in law the Collector's award under S.11 is nothing more
than an offer of compensation made by the Government to the claimants whose
property is acquired (vide Privy Council decisions in Ezra v. Secy. of State for India,
(1905) ILR 32 Cal 605 and this Court's decision in Raja Patna High Court L.P.A
No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 Harish Chandra v. Dy. Land Requisition Officer,
(1962) 1 SCR 676 and Dr. G. H. Grant v. State of Bihar, (1965) 3 SCR 576). If that be
the true nature of the award made by the Collector then the question whether the
right to receive compensation survives the award must depend upon whether the
claimant acquiesces therein fully or not. If the offer is acquiesced in by total
acceptance the right to compensation will not survive but if the offer is not accepted
or is accepted under protest and a land reference is sought by the claimant under
S.18, the right to receive compensation must be regarded as having survived and kept
alive which the claimant prosecutes in Civil Court. It is impossible to accept the
contention that no sooner the Collector has made his award under S.11 the right to
compensation is destroyed or ceases to exist or is merged in the award, or what is left
with the claimant is a mere right to litigate the correctness of the award. The claimant
can litigate the correctness of the award because his right to compensation is not fully
redeemed but remains alive which he prosecutes in Civil Court. That is why when a
claimant dies in a pending reference his heirs are Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of
2018 dt.22-04-2019 brought on record and are permitted to prosecute the reference.
"
42. As to what constitutes an Award, learned counsel for the respondent-petitioners has relied on
the judgment in the case of Steel Authority of India Limited Vs. SUTNI Sangam and others, reported
in (2009) 16 SCC 1 paragraphs 33 to 35 that is extracted hereinunder:
"33. An award is to be made at the end of the enquiry. The award made must be
under the following three heads:
• correct area of land, • amount of compensation the Collector thinks should be given,
and • apportionment of compensation, if any.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138901827/ 29
The Union Of India, Ministry Of Defence vs Arjun Yadav And Ors on 22 April, 2019
34. Section 11 makes it obligatory on the part of the Collector to safeguard the
interests of all persons interested, even though they might not have appeared before
him. In awarding compensation the Land Acquisition Collector should look into the
estimate value of land and give due consideration to the other factors specified
therein. Value of the property in the neighbourhood can be used as a criterion.
The award should be made within a period Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019
two years.
35. A perusal of the provisions of Sections 12, 18, 30, 31 and the procedure for reference as
contained in Part III of the Act, reveals that except for the right of reference on the said three factual
matters, the Act does not provide for appeal from the award of the Collector. Of course, an appeal
lies under Section 54 to the High Court from an award of the Reference Judge made under Section
26 of the Act, and a second appeal lies to the Supreme Court from the decision of the High Court.
But the remedy of appeal is restricted only to the questions relating to the aforesaid three factual
matters. At most, therefore, the Act can be said to be a complete code, only for the special purpose of
adjudicating any dispute with respect to the three factual matters of the area, value of the land and
the apportionment of the compensation among the interested persons."
43. On the strength of the aforesaid judgment it is urged that the documented proceedings dated
12th June, 2001 neither indicates the correct area of the land, the amount of compensation and
apportionment of compensation. In the Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019
present case, it is evident from the records, particularly the detailed order of reference under Section
30 that Award Nos. 61 to 92 of 2001 in respect of trees and constructions had already been
determined and finalized, whereafter the payments of compensation had also been made. This order
dated 12 th October, 2002 also records that the tenure-holders had made claims far more than the
area which had been acquired for which there were only 52 recorded tenure-holders. The acquired
area was only 46.38 acres, whereas the claim of compensation had been made by different persons
in respect of 100.7875 acres. This disproportionate claim, therefore, was sought to be resolved by
several persons by submitting a compromise, but the officer found that the same had not been
signed by all the recipients. The said compromise dated 04.10.2002 was, therefore, rejected and it
was held that since there are competing claims including that of title, therefore, the matter for
apportionment should be referred under Section 30.
44. We may extract Section 30 of 1894 Act hereinunder:-
"30. Dispute as to apportionment.- When the amount of compensation has been
settled under section 11, if any dispute arises as to the apportionment of the same
Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 or any part thereof, or as to
the persons to whom the same or any part thereof, is payable, the Collector may refer
such dispute to the decision of the Court."
45. Thus, in respect of the land since the Collector did not find it appropriate to mention names of
the awardees it only mentioned the extent of area acquired and the total amount of compensation
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138901827/ 30
The Union Of India, Ministry Of Defence vs Arjun Yadav And Ors on 22 April, 2019
that was to be awarded for the said area. Thus, the area and the quantum of compensation were
both mentioned in the Award, but in the column of recipient on account of the dispute it was stated
that due to dispute of title, the names are not being mentioned and the matter was being referred
under Section 30 of the Act for adjudication. This document, therefore, dated 12th June, 2001 was
turned as Award No. 60 of 2001 which was declared as an Award but the payments were not made
on account of the said dispute of reference. The reference was sent along with the list of the
claimants and it is not in dispute that the respondent-petitioners thereafter in the said reference
filed their claim which was registered as a Title Suit in the same reference proceedings as Title Case
No. 10 of 2007 (Chhotan Yadav and two others Vs. State of Bihar and others). The two others were
the Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 respondent-petitioners Arjun Yadav and
Ranjit Yadav. A copy of the plaint which was not part of the record has been supplied by the learned
counsel for the respondent-petitioners which has been perused by us. Learned counsel for the
respondent- petitioners, therefore, contends that the same was only a claim set up for establishing
the title and since neither the area of the respondent-petitioners was disclosed nor the amount of
compensation that was payable to them was known, therefore, the contents of the Award did not
exist about which the respondent-petitioners had no knowledge. It is only after the Section 30
proceedings were finalized that the amount payable to the answering respondents was made known
through a notice under Section 12(2) in the year 2010 as stated above. The applicants then were
tendered a cheque, whereafter they filed the application under Section 18 of the 1894 Act. It is urged
on their behalf that unless there is a notice under Section 12(2), there cannot be any actual or
constructive knowledge about Award and in fact there was no knowledge about the contents of the
Award in the present case so as to enable the respondent- petitioners to file an application. Two
judgments have been cited being that of Madan and another Vs. State of Maharashtra, reported in
(2014) 2 SCC 720 and Vijay Mahadeorao Kubade Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018
dt.22-04-2019 Vs. State of Maharashtra through the Collector, reported in (2018) 8 SCC 266. The
said judgments hold that it is only when a copy of the Award accompanies the said notice, then only
it can be said that there is knowledge of the Award to the tenure- holder to enable him to file an
objection under Section 18 and, therefore, limitation has to be counted accordingly. Thus,
knowledge according to the aforesaid judgments can be presumed only after a notice is sent under
Section 12(2) of the 1894 Act and not before it. The issue of limitation was discussed in the case of
Bhagwan Das and others Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and others, reported in (2010) 3 SCC 545. The
learned counsel for the parties have also invited the attention of the Court to the Division Bench
judgment in the case of Dr. J. Dubey Vs. State of Bihar and Anr. decided on 14th November, 1967,
reported in 1968 BLJR Part 16 page-562 to advance their respective submissions.
46. As a corollary to this argument, learned counsel for the appellant has also advanced his
submissions that no acquiescence can be presumed on the part of the appellant as it has been
contesting the matter throughout. On the other hand, the respondent-petitioners contend that no
acquiescence can be presumed on their part either, inasmuch as, they had not actual Patna High
Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 or constructive knowledge of the Award or its contents
till th matter was finalized under Section 30 of the Act. As to what is the actual and constructive
knowledge, the decisions in the case of Kanara Bank Vs. Canara Sales Corporation and others,
reported in (1987) 2 SCC 666 and Rajasthan Housing Board Vs. New Pink City Nirman Sahkari
Samiti Limited and another, reported in (2015) 7 SCC 601 have been cited at the Bar.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138901827/ 31
The Union Of India, Ministry Of Defence vs Arjun Yadav And Ors on 22 April, 2019
47. In order to clear the web of facts, we find that the proceedings dated 12th of June, 2001 were
very much in the actual knowledge of the respondent-petitioners, inasmuch as, the
respondent-petitioners have admitted their participation before the Collector upon the issuance of a
Section 9 notice issued to them in Paragraph 11 of the writ petition. Therefore, the
respondent-petitioners cannot contend that they were not aware of the proceedings of the Award
dated 12 th June, 2001. The argument that the Award was not pronounced in their presence or they
were not having knowledge also does not appear to have any substance, inasmuch as, the
order-sheet of reference dated 12th October, 2002 categorically indicates the presence of the
respondent-petitioners and a compromise being admitted by some of the claimants that ended up in
failure and a reference Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 was made under
Section 30 for apportionment. The respondent- petitioners were also claimants and they filed their
claim upon having full knowledge of the proceedings before the Collector in the proceedings of the
Award dated 12th of June, 2001. Thus, in our opinion, they had actual knowledge of the proceedings
dated 12th of June, 2001, which is now criticized by them to be not an Award and to be a purported
Award as held by the learned Single Judge. We are unable to accept this submission, inasmuch as, it
is only the said Award which gave rise to a proceeding under Section 30. The respondent-petitioners
themselves filed the claim under Section 30, which is evident from a copy of the plaint which has
been handed over to the Court during the proceedings. In the said plaint, they have described the
said Award No. 60 as a nil Award. We are extracting a part of the plaint which is the pleading
contained therein in the proceedings under Section 30 of the Act.
48. Paragraphs 4 and 5 of the plaint are extracted hereinunder:-
"4. That other circumstances which led to the making of reference was that the
claimant/objectors failed to decide their respective claim by their free consent
interese through resolution, though attempts were made to partition the land on
Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 the basis of Agreement, but
the resolution could not be signed by all the executants and the plaintiffs are ready to
prove the title of the land held by them.
5. That the plaintiffs have been owners of the land until its possession on 1.9.00 by
the state of Bihar through the land acquisition collector Nalanda. The defendant No.
2 the land acquisition collector took the possession of the land in Sch. I of the plaint
without making any award of compensation payable and without making any
payment of compensation of the land acquired but made an Award No. 60 of 2001
which is a NIL award as regards compensation payable for land acquired under plot
No. 1470 aforesaid. It is relevant to mention that award Nos. 61/01 to 92/01 were also
made for trees and house structure etc, on the land on the basis of survey done and
Adhoc compensation money was paid to the claimant on the basis of possession of
respective claimant but the dispute of title of the land under acquisition could not be
resolved by the respective owners and hence the reference for determination by this
learned court under section 30 of the Act. The parties are bound by the Adjudication
of this court and the same Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019
question cannot be determined by any other courts. The plaintiffs are real owner of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138901827/ 32
The Union Of India, Ministry Of Defence vs Arjun Yadav And Ors on 22 April, 2019
the land described in Sch. I hereunder the title of which is required to be determined
and declared in favour of the plaintiffs on the basis of title document to be submitted
with a list attached therewith and also on the basis of oral evidence in support of
pleading."
49. The aforesaid paragraph indicate admission of having received compensation for trees and
house structure under Award No. 61 to 92 of 2001. It is also admitted therein that the dispute of the
land could not be resolved as the Collector found that there was no effective agreement between the
parties and looking to the nature of the dispute, the matter has been referred. All this clearly
established that the respondent-petitioners had full knowledge of the proceedings of the Award and
the reference thereafter. Thus, they had full knowledge of the said proceedings of Award, the
reference whereof was made on 12th October, 2002.
50. The argument is that unless there is a notice under Section 12(2) and which notice had not been
given after the Award, it cannot be presumed that the respondent-petitioners had knowledge of the
contents of the Award so as to enable them Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 to
file an application under Section 18. It is clear that one has to refer to the judgment in the case of
Bhagwan Das (supra), which in our opinion, binds us to hold that the application under Section 18
of the 1894 Act has to be moved within six months if the person interested or his representative
claims that he was not present when the Award was made. As held above, on facts, the
respondent-petitioners were aware of whatever material was written in the document dated 12th
June, 2001 and, therefore, it cannot be said that they were not present, inasmuch as, the very plaint
extracted hereinabove indicates that they had knowledge of the proceedings. However, at the same
time, Paragraph 28 of the judgment in the case of Bhagwan Das (supra) holds as under:-
"28. The following position therefore emerges from the interpretation of the proviso
to Section 18 of the Act :
(i) If the award is made in the presence of the person interested (or his authorised
representative), he has to make the application within six weeks from the date of the
Collector's award itself.
(ii) If the award is not made in the presence of the person interested (or his
authorised representative), he has to make the application seeking reference within
six Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 weeks of the receipt of the
notice from the Collector under section 12(2).
(iii) If the person interested (or his representative) was not present when the award is
made, and if he does not receive the notice under Section 12(2) from the Collector, he
has to make the application within six months of the date on which he actually or
constructively came to know about the contents of the award.
(iv) If a person interested receives a notice under section 12(2) of the Act, after the
expiry of six weeks from the date of receipt of such notice, he cannot claim the benefit

The Union Of India, Ministry Of Defence vs Arjun Yadav And Ors on 22 April, 2019
of the provision for six months for making the application on the ground that the date
of receipt of notice under Section 12(2) of the Act was the date of knowledge of the
contents of the award."
51. As against the aforesaid ratio what we find is that the judgment in the case of Madan (supra) in
Paragraph 11 held as under:-
"11. A cursory glance at the provisions of Sections 18 and 30 of the Act, extracted
above, may suggest that there is some overlapping between the Patna High Court
L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 provisions inasmuch as both contemplate
reference of the issue of apportionment of compensation to the court. But, a closer
scrutiny would indicate that the two sections of the Act operate in entirely different
circumstances. While Section 18 applies to situations where the apportionment made
in the award is objected to by a beneficiary thereunder, Section 30 applies when no
apportionment whatsoever is made by the Collector on account of conflicting claims.
In such a situation one of the options open to the Collector is to make a reference of
the question of apportionment to the Court under Section 30 of the Act. The other is
to relegate the parties to the remedy of a suit. In either situation, the right to receive
compensation under the award would crystallize after apportionment is made in
favour of a claimant. It is only thereafter that a reference under Section 18 for
enhanced compensation can be legitimately sought by the claimant in whose favour
the order of apportionment is passed either by the court in the reference under
Section 30 or in the civil suit, as may be."
52. In the aforesaid case, the aforesaid finding Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018
dt.22-04-2019 was recorded after holding that the appellant in the said case had no knowledge of
the Award until the order was passed in a reference under Section 30 and then relying on the
judgment in the case of Harish Chandra Raj Singh Vs. Land Acquisition Officer, reported in A.I.R.
1961 SC 1500 was considered in the case of Bhagwan Das (supra) and it was thereafter that the ratio
was laid down in Paragraph 28 of the said judgment extracted hereinabove. The ratio of the
judgment in the case of Bhagwan Das (supra) does not appear to have been noticed in the case of
Madan (supra). In order to reconcile the ratio of the aforesaid two decisions, distinction that we find
is that in the case of Madan (supra) it was specifically held that the appellants had no knowledge of
the Award till the order was passed under Section 30, whereas, in the present case, as held above, we
find that the respondent-petitioners had actual knowledge of the entire proceedings culminating in
the Award dated 12 th June, 2001 which is also evident by their subsequent conduct while
participating in the proceedings under Section 30 of the Act. Thus, if the respondent-petitioners had
not received notice under Section 12(2) but they had the knowledge of the entire proceedings, the
respondents could have raised objection even under Section 18 of the Act. It may be mentioned that
Section 18 Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 of the 1894 Act is a right of
objection to an interested person to apply for a reference to the Court who has not accepted the
Award which may be with regard to measurement of the land, the amount of compensation, the
persons to whom it is payable or the apportionment of the compensation among the persons
interested. Thus, Section 18 is available for any person who has not accepted the Award. The
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138901827/ 34
The Union Of India, Ministry Of Defence vs Arjun Yadav And Ors on 22 April, 2019
respondent-petitioners, therefore, could have challenged the same in terms of Section 18 but they
subjected themselves to the limited proceedings of apportionment under Section 30 of the Act in
spite of having knowledge that the Award was in respect of a total area for which the compensation
had already been determined. Thus, the respondent-petitioners were in effect claiming their right to
receive the compensation by way of apportionment on the basis of title and it is for this reason that
in order to apportion the same, reference was made under Section 30. They described the said
award as 'Nil' award because they did not receive the compensation on account of the reference of
the dispute. If the award was not acceptable, they had every right to apply before the Collector to
refer the matter under Section 18 including the right to receive enhanced compensation or
otherwise. The quantum of compensation, therefore, has to be dealt with under Patna High Court
L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 Section 18 which includes the rate of compensation or any
dispute with regard to the measurement or the area of the land. It is only on the limited ground of
apportionment that Section 30 comes into play. This has been explained in the Division Bench
Judgement in the case Dr. J. Dubey (supra) with which we find ourselves in full agreement. It was
held therein that the validity of the award is not dependent on the issuance of a notice under Section
12(2) of the Act. Paragraphs 9 to 12 of the said decision are extracted hereinunder for ready
reference:-
"9. Learned Counsel for the petitioner asserted that the petitioner was neither
present nor represented before the Collector at the lime when he made the award and
as such it was necessary for the Collector to have issued notice under Section 12(2) of
the Act. Admittedly, no notice as contemplated under Section 12(2) of the Act was
issued. Therefore, the plea of the petitioner was that the so-called award could not be
an award in the eye of law. There is no substance in this contention either. The
validity of the award does not depend on the issue of notice under Section 12(2) of the
Act, which is contemplated to be issued after the award has become final under
Section 12(1) of the Act.
Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019
10. Issue and service of notice under Section 12(2) of the Act are of some importance
for the purpose of determination of the question of limitation for an application for
making a reference under Section 18 of the Act. Section 18 of the Act runs as follows:
(1) Any person interested who has not accepted the award may, by written
application to the Collector require that the matter be referred by the Collector for the
determination of the Court, whether his objection be to the measurement of the land,
the amount of the compensation, the persons to whom it is payable or the
apportionment of the compensation among the persons interested. (2) The
application shall state the grounds on which objection in the award is taken:
Provided that every such application shall be made: (a) If the person making it was
present or represented before the Collector at the time when he made his award,
within six weeks, from the date of the Collector's award: (b) In other cases, within six
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138901827/ 35
The Union Of India, Ministry Of Defence vs Arjun Yadav And Ors on 22 April, 2019
weeks of the receipt of the notice from the Collector under Section 12 Sub-section (2),
or within six months from the date of the Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018
dt.22-04-2019 Collector's award, whichever period shall first expire. A person
interested in the award may accept the award as final as to the quantum of
compensation payable for the land acquired. If he is not satisfied as to the quantum
of compensation allowed by the award, he may file a written application before the
Collector under Section 18 of the Act for making a reference to the Court for
determination of proper amount of compensation payable in respect of the land so
acquired. The Section does not contemplate suo motu reference to the court for the
said purpose. A written application to that effect is required to be filed by any person
interested. The application must be made under proviso (a) within six weeks if he was
present or represented before the Collector at the time when he made the award. The
petitioner asserted that he was neither present nor was he represented before the
Collector when the award was made. He could not have, therefore; made an
application for reference within six weeks.
11. Under proviso (b), if notice under Section 12(2) of the Act is issued and served on
the Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 person, the application
will have to be filed within six weeks of the receipt of the notice.
No notice admittedly was served on the petitioner under Section 12(2) of the Act. In the second part
of proviso (b) the period of limitation is six months from the date of the Collector's award in those
cases which are not covered by the above contingencies. While interpreting proviso (b) of Section 18
of the Act, the Supreme Court has held in State of Punjab v. Mst. Qaiser Jehan Begum A.I.R. 1968
S.C. 1604 that the expression "six months from the date of the Collector's award" used in the proviso
must mean when the award is either communicated to the party or is known to him either actually
or constructively. Therefore, for the purpose of determining the period of limitation in such a case, it
is necessary to find out as to when the petitioner had knowledge of the contents of the award. The
petitioner did not state in clear terms as to when he came to know about the award and its contents.
The counter affidavit shows that the petitioner was served with a notice (Annexure
f) on the 29th March, 1962, by the Land Acquisition Officer, Palamau, intimating to him that
reference under Section 30 of the Act had been made by him to the District Judge of Palamau by
letter No. 204 dated the 26th March, 1962. The petitioner in reply to the Patna High Court L.P.A
No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 counter affidavit admitted that though by that letter respondent 2
informed him that since Haribansi Mahto had disputed the petitioner's title to the land under
acquisition, the dispute had been referred to the District Judge for adjudication of the dispute, but it
did not convey any intimation to him that an award had been made on the 15th January, 1959. The
objection filed by the petitioner on September 22, 1962, before the District Judge in Land
Acquisition Case No. 11 of 1962 quoted above, however, clearly shows that the petitioner had full
knowledge of the award and its contents at the latest on the 29th September, 1962. Therefore, the
application (Annexure C) filed by the petitioner before the Land Acquisition Officer on the 14th
September, 1965, after more than six years for making a reference to the court under Section 18 of
the Act is clearly barred by limitation. Hence, the impugned order of the Land Acquisition Officer,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138901827/ 36
The Union Of India, Ministry Of Defence vs Arjun Yadav And Ors on 22 April, 2019
dated the 22nd November, 1965 (Annexure D), cannot be said to be erroneous in law.
12. Learned Counsel for the petitioner, however, urged that as the title to the land was disputed by
Haribansi Mahto, he had no locus standi to file an application before the Land Acquisition Officer
for making reference to the court under Section 18 of the Act and his Patna High Court L.P.A No.418
of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 cause of action remained in abeyance. It is difficult to accept this contention.
There is nothing in Section 18 to indicate that the person whose title is in dispute can file an
application under this Section only after his title is finally determined by a competent civil court.
Under the provisions of Section 18 of the Act, any person interested who has not accepted the award
may by a written application to the Collector require that the matter be referred to by the Collector
for the determination of the court. Therefore, if a person is interested in the award he can file an
application under this Section Person interested has been defined in Section 3(b) of the Act as
follows:
The expression 'person interested' includes all persons claiming an interest in
compensation to be made on account of the acquisition of land under this Act, and a
person shall be deemed to be interested in land if he is interested in an easement
affecting the land: In the present case, the award was prepared in the name of the
petitioner as being entitled to receive Rs. 156.98 as compensation in respect of the
land. Therefore, he is the most vitally interested person in the award and as such he
should Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 have filed an
application under Section 18 of the Act as soon as he had known about the existence
and contents of the award. His status to file an. application under Section 18 was in
no way dependent on the decision of the District Judge in a case arising out of
reference under Section 30 of the Act made at the instance of Haribansi Mahto. The
two kinds of reference contemplated under Sections 18 and 30 of the Act are quite
distinct and independent of each other.
Section 18 contemplates a case of reference when the quantum of compensation was disputed by the
person interested and Section 30 contemplates a reference when there is a dispute as to the title of
the land acquired and consequently to receive the compensation money. The effect of the decision of
the District Judge dated the 7th June, 1965, was only to affirm the title of the petitioner to receive
the compensation money and nothing more. In my Judgment therefore, the contention of the
petitioner that his cause of action to Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 apply to
the Land Acquisition Officer for making a reference to the District Judge under Section 18 of the Act
remained suspended till June 7, 1965, must be over-ruled."
53. There is a relevant fact which deserves mention and which we have gathered from the order
sheet of the present appeal. We find that there was a direction to list this case along with other
analogous cases. In the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the state in the present case there is a
reference to the counter affidavit filed in C.W.J.C. No. 11241 of 2012 which arises out of the same
acquisition proceedings. The said writ petition along with a bunch of other writ petition was
dismissed as withdrawn on 3rd of July, 2017. The order is extracted hereinunder:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138901827/ 37
The Union Of India, Ministry Of Defence vs Arjun Yadav And Ors on 22 April, 2019
"All the above stated petitions arise out of same impugned order and accordingly, all the above
stated petitions are taken together for hearing and are being disposed of by this common order.
After some argument,
learned counsel appearing for the
petitioners seeks permission for withdrawal of all the petitions.
Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 Accordingly, all the above stated petitions
stand dismissed as withdrawn."
54. The reference was made to the counter affidavit filed in the said writ petition. From the order
sheet of the writ petition giving rise to this appeal we find that a reference was made to the
analogous cases and in the counter affidavit in the writ petition a reference was made to the counter
affidavit filed in C.W.J.C. 11241 of 2012. Learned counsel for the respondent petitioners sought time
to give reply to the same if so desired. We have not been able to find any reply filed to the counter
affidavit of the State in C.W.J.C. No. 11241 of 2012 in the present proceedings.
55. From the records of C.W.J.C. No. 11241 of 2012, we find that a counter was filed to which a reply
was given by the petitioners therein. The said counter affidavit brings on record the documents
which indicate the list of persons who had raised the objections. We find that Ranjit Yadav son of
Arjun Yadav had filed his objection and the respondent Arjun Yadav and also filed his objection
whose names appear in the list of objectors that has been appended along with the counter affidavit.
The compromise that had been tendered was placed Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018
dt.22-04-2019 before the officer with a recommendation that since there is a title dispute the matter
can be referred. Arjun Yadav also appears to have put his thumb impression on the said compromise
which was rejected while making the reference under Section 30 of the 1894 Act. All the said writ
petitions, as quoted above were dismissed as withdrawn and, therefore, it was incumbent on the
respondent-petitioners to have filed a reply to the averments contained to the counter therein in the
writ petition giving rise to the present appeal which they do not appear to have done. The
respondent-petitioners, therefore, have chosen willfully not to contest the said fact which also
indicates their participation and presence in the proceedings of the award dated 12th June 2001.
56. In the above background what we find is that the judgment in the case of Madan (supra) does
not cover the issue on facts as involved in the present case inasmuch as here the appellants had both
actual and constructive knowledge about the contents of the award dates 12th June 2001 which was
an award under Section 11 of the 1894 Act. The conclusion drawn by the learned Single that it was a
purported award does not appeal to reason at all, inasmuch as, if the award was even otherwise
deficient in any way, the same had not been challenged within time as per the law laid down in the
case of Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 Bhagwan Das (supra). The period of
limitation either six weeks if the notice had been received under Section 12(2), which is not the case
here, was extended till six months. The actual award was being contested by the
respondent-petitioners in the manner indicated above in the proceedings under Section 30 of the
1894 Act since 2002 itself. They therefore, cannot contend that they had no opportunity to move an
application earlier. All the grounds which are being taken now in the application under Section 18
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138901827/ 38
The Union Of India, Ministry Of Defence vs Arjun Yadav And Ors on 22 April, 2019
were very much available and could have been made the basis of an application under Section 18 of
the Act way back in 2001 itself. It would have been possible for the Collector to have referred the
matter under Section 18 as well if a ground was made out for such reference along with the
proceedings under Section 30 of the 1894 Act on any demand been made by the
respondent-petitioners.
57. Having held so, we may also answer the issue relating to the applicability of the 2013 Act in this
regard. Suffice would be to quote Section 24 (1) (b) and Section 114 of the 2013 Act that are
extracted hereinunder:-
"24(1)(b) where an award under said section 11 has been made, then such
proceedings shall continue under the provisions of the said Land Acquisition Patna
High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 Act, as if the said Act has not been
repealed.
114. Repeal and saving.- (1) The Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (1 of 1894) is hereby
repealed.
(2) Save as otherwise provided in this Act the repeal under sub-section (1) shall not
be held to prejudice or affect the general application of section 6 of the General
Clauses Act, 1897 (10 of 1897) with regard to the effect of repeals."
58. Coupled with the same reference be had to Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897, which is
extracted hereinunder:-
"6. Effect of repeal. - Where this Act, or any [Central Act] or Regulation made after
the commencement of this Act, repeals any enactment hitherto made or hereafter to
be made, them unless a different intention appears, the repeal shall not -
(a) revive anything not in force or existing at the time at which the repeal takes effect;
or
(b) affect the previous operation of any enactment so repealed or anything duly done
or suffered Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 thereunder; or
(c) affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued or incurred
under any enactment so repealed; or
(d) affect any penalty, forfeiture or punishment incurred in respect of any offence
committed against any enactment so repealed; or
(e) affect any investigation, legal proceeding or remedy in respect of any such right,
privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment as aforesaid;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138901827/ 39
The Union Of India, Ministry Of Defence vs Arjun Yadav And Ors on 22 April, 2019
and any such investigation, legal proceeding or remedy may be instituted continued
or enforced, and any such penalty, forfeiture or punishment may be imposed as if the
repealing Act or Regulation had not been passed."
59. Several judgments have been cited at the Bar by the learned counsel for the parties to contend
that once the 1894 Act has been repealed, there was no scope to proceed under Section 64 of the Act.
Here we find that the authority below has proceeded afresh under Section 64 of the 2013 Act after
the judgment of the learned Single Judge. The authority Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of 2018
dt.22-04-2019 below appears to have not correctly appreciated the provisions aforesaid which
clearly allow the proceedings to continue under the old Act to a limited extent. In the instant case,
the application was under Section 18 of the 1894 Act and it is the said proceedings which were under
challenge before this Court before the learned Single Judge. If the writ petitions were to be allowed
and relief granted, then it was to be for a limited purpose namely to decide as to whether Section 18
application was within the limitation prescribed and was otherwise entertainable and therefore, the
said proceedings could have been continued being procedural in nature that are saved under Section
24(1) (b), as allowing of the writ petition would only make the application under Section 18 pending
before the authority. In the instant case, the learned Single Judge went beyond the aforesaid scope
of the proceedings and went on to hold that the award was not a valid award in the eyes of law and
was a purported award and then directed the authorities to proceed afresh which was taken by the
authorities to be a proceeding available under Section 64 of the 2013 Act.
60. We do not agree with the said process adopted by the respondent authorities by taking recourse
to Section 64 of the 2013 Act and, therefore, all consequential Patna High Court L.P.A No.418 of
2018 dt.22-04-2019 actions culminating into a fresh award are a nullity as the impunged judgment
of the learned Single Judge is clearly vitiated and deserves to be set aside. Since the proceedings are
an outcome of the impugned judgment which is being set aside, the conclusion is that the
proceedings for fresh award are a nullity. We accordingly, hold so.
61. We accordingly allow this appeal and set aside the impugned judgment of the learned Single
dated 07.05.2014 and uphold the order of the Collector dated 15 th July 2015. We also declare all
consequential proceedings undertaken by the respondent authorities and Court pursuant to the
judgment dated 7.5.2014 to be a nullity.
