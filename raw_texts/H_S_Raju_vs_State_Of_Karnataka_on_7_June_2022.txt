Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82378290/ 52
H.S. Raju vs State Of Karnataka on 7 June, 2022
petitioners have sought for the following reliefs:
In W.P.No.8502/2022:
For mandamus directing the respondents to include the names of the petitioners in
the eligible voters list and permit them to vote in the elections to the Co-operative
Society's Board in terms of the Provisional list of eligible voters dated 07.03.2022
(Annexure-B to the writ petition).
In W.P.No.8477/2022:
For mandamus directing the respondent No.2, 3, 4 and 5 to include the names of the
petitioners in the eligible voters list and permit the petitioners to vote in the elections
to the Co-operative Society's Board which is scheduled to be held on 23.04.2022 in
the interest of justice and equity".
2. This Court has granted interim orders in both these writ petitions permitting the petitioners to
cast votes in the elections to be held on 20.04.2022 for the constitution of the Managing Committee,
but on the condition that the votes cast by the petitioners shall be kept in separate boxes and the
results shall not be announced without the order of this Court. It is submitted in unison that the
election is indeed held on 23.04.2022 and the votes cast by the petitioners are kept in separate
boxes.
3. Sri. P S Rajagopal, the learned Senior Counsel who leads the learned counsels for the petitioners,
submits that the petition could be disposed of directing the Returning Officer to announce the
results including the votes cast by the petitioners, and if any person is aggrieved by the result so
announced, or affected by counting of the petitioners' votes, such person could always avail remedy
under Section 70 (2) of the Karnataka Co-operative Societies Act, 1959 (for short, 'the Co-operative
Societies Act')1.
4. Sri A.Mohammed Tahir, the learned counsel for the Co-operative Society, and Sri T.L. Kiran
Kumar, the learned counsel for the Election Authority, were called upon to respond, and they now
submit that there are records to demonstrate that the petitioners are guilty of creating records.
Therefore, the petitioners' exclusion from Final Eligible Voters List is justified. With the material on
record, if the petitioners' votes are counted and the results announced, it would amount to an order
in their favour without adjudication on the necessary question of whether the petitioners are eligible
to vote in the light of the allegations against them.
1 As recorded by this Court after the hearing on 26.5.2022
5. Sri A.Mohammed Tahir and Sri T.L. Kiran Kumar also submit that the request for disposal of the
petitions is because this Court has granted interim order. But, notwithstanding the interim order
granted, this Court must dismiss the writ petitions as the petitioners should invoke the alternative
remedy under Section 70(2) of the Co-operative Societies Act. Sri.Mohammed Tahir relies upon the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82378290/ 53
H.S. Raju vs State Of Karnataka on 7 June, 2022
decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Shri Sant Sadguru Janardan Swami (Moingiri Maharaj)
Sahakari Dugha Utpadak Sanstha and Another v. State of Maharashtra and Others2. He argues that
if there is any irregularity in the conduct of election for the Managing Committee, a petition under
Article 226 of the Constitution of India would not be the proper remedy and the petitioners must
avail alternative remedy, especially when questions of fraud in creation of the documents relied
upon by the petitioners are to be examined. 2 (2001) 8 Supreme Court Cases 509
6. The petitioners' grievance is with the non- compliance of the due procedure as contemplated
under Rule 13D of the Karnataka Co-operative Societies Rules, 1960 (for short, 'the Co-operative
Societies Rules') in preparation of the Final Electoral Rules. Sri.P.S.Rajagopal submits that the
Provisional Eligible Electoral List is published on 07.03.2022 with the names of the petitioners in
W.P.No.8502/2022 but their names are excluded from the Final Electoral Rolls. Even according to
the respondents, the publication of the Provisional Eligible Voters List is followed by a General
Public Notice dated 8.11.2021 (Annexure-R5-C) calling for objections, and these petitioners have not
responded. However, even if this Public Notice dated 8.11.2021 is accepted, the petitioners have
been denied individual opportunity under Rule 13-D (2-A) of the Co- operative Societies Rules. As
such, this Court must permit the results to be announced including the votes cast by the petitioners.
7. As against these submissions, both Sri.A.Mohammed Tahir and Sri T.L.Kiran Kumar are
categorical that indeed certain lapses could be shown in publication of Final Electoral List but this
Court must not be persuaded to interfere with Article 226 of the Constitution of India and direct the
results to be announced including the votes cast by the petitioners. They assert that the petitioners
in W.P.No. 8502/2022 rely upon documents which can be established are created. Insofar as the
petitioners in W.P.No.8477/2022, Sri A. Mohammed Tahir, and Sri.T.L.Kiran Kumar contend in
unison that these petitioners' names did not figure in the Provisional List of Eligible Voters and they
cannot in any event complain about their exclusion, and as such, their votes must not be counted at
this stage.
8. In the light of these rival submissions, the question for consideration is:
Whether these writ petitions must be disposed of directing the Returning Officer [the
fourth respondent and sixth respondents in the respective petitions] to announce the
results of the elections held on 23.04.2022 including the votes cast by the petitioners.
9. The provisions of Rule 13-D (2-A) of the Rules read as hereunder:
(3) The Election Officer shall take steps for publication of voters list in the following
manner, namely:-
(a) for publication of draft eligible electoral list, a list of defaulters, a list of members
whose repayment falls due, before the election date clear fifty days;
(b) for calling objections, if any, calling upon the defaulter members to repay the
amounts due to the co-operative societies on or before thirty clear days prior to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82378290/ 54
H.S. Raju vs State Of Karnataka on 7 June, 2022
date of election;
(c) the scrutiny and verification of the voters list after payment by defaulters etc.,
clear twenty days before the ate of election.
(d) for publication of final eligible voters list before fifteen clear days prior to the date
of election.
The underlining is by this Court.
10. These provisions do not leave any room for doubt that an excluded member, with the publication
of the Draft Eligible Electoral List, must have an opportunity by way of an individual notice to file
objections on exclusion from the Electoral List. It must be shown that the concerned Chief Executive
has prepared and sent notice to the affected members. The Public Notice dated 8.11.20213 does not
meet these requirements. In fact, it is admitted on behalf of the respondents that there are
deficiencies in the preparation of the Final Electoral Roll after the 3 This Public Notice reads as

11. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Shri Sant Sadguru Janardan Swami (Moingiri Maharaj) Sahakari
Dugha Utpadak Sanstha and Another v. State of Maharashtra and Others supra has held as follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82378290/ 55
H.S. Raju vs State Of Karnataka on 7 June, 2022
'7. A perusal of the Rules discloses that the preparation of provisional list of voters,
filing of objection against the provisional list of voters, consideration of the objection
by the Collector and finalising the list of voters, all occur in the Rules which cover the
entire process of the election. The Rules framed for election of specified societies are
complete code in itself providing for the entire process of election beginning from the
stage of preparation of the provisional voters list, decision on the objection by the
Collector, finalisation of electoral rolls, holding of election and declaration of result of
the election. In view of the scheme of the Act and Rules, the preparation of voters' list
must be held to be part of the election process for constituting managing committee
of a specified society.
12. In view of our finding that preparation of the electoral roll is being an intermediate stage in the
process of election of the managing committee of a specified society and the election process having
been set in motion, it is well settled that the High Court should not stay the continuation of the
election process even though there may be some alleged illegality or breach of rules while preparing
the electoral roll. It is not disputed that the election in question has already been held and the result
thereof has been stayed by an order of this Court, and once the result of the election is declared, it
would be open to the appellant to challenge the election of returned candidate, if aggrieved, by
means of an election petition before the election tribunal.
12. It follows from this decision that the adjudication of all questions must be as provided under
Section 70(2) of the Co-operative Societies Act4. However, in the present case the respondents
admit that there are deficiencies in finalization of Final Electoral List. The petitioners are admittedly
not issued with individual notice as required under the provisions of Rule13-D (2-A) of the
Co-operative Societies Rules; the petitioners have now cast their votes in the elections on
23.04.2022; the petitioners are not given the 4 70. Disputes which may be referred to Registrar for
decision.- (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force, if any
dispute touching the constitution, management, or the business of a co-operative society arises,--
(a) xxxxxxxxx (2). For the purposes of sub-section (1), the following shall be deemed to be disputes
touching the constitution, management or the business of a co-operative society, namely:--
(a). XXXXXXXXXXX
(b). XXXXXXXXXXXXX
(c). any dispute arising in connection with the election of a President, Vice- president,
Chairman, Vice-chairman, Secretary, Treasurer or Member of Committee of the
society.
opportunity to show cause against the allegations that they have created documents. The
respondents, despite admitting deficiencies in finalisation of the Final Electoral List, want to invoke
the rule of alternative remedy. This Court is of the considered view that, in the peculiarities of this
case, the writ petitions should be disposed of with directions to the concerned respondent to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82378290/ 56
H.S. Raju vs State Of Karnataka on 7 June, 2022
announce results counting even the votes cast by the petitioners and with liberty to all the concerned
to avail remedy under Section 70(2) of the Act if aggrieved by the results. If such remedy is availed
raising a dispute, exclusion of votes of those petitioners who are guilty of fraud can also be
considered based on the material that will be placed on record.
Therefore, writ petitions are disposed of calling upon the Returning Officer [the fourth
respondent/sixth respondent in the respective petitions] to announce the result forthwith including
the votes cast by the petitioners in both the petitions. All the contentions are left open for
consideration in appropriate proceedings, if commenced.
