2. LPASW No. 144 of 2017, LPA 28 of 2023, LPA 29 of 2023, LPA 30 of 2023, LPA 31 of 2023, LPA
32 of 2023, LPA 33 of 2023, LPA 34 of 2023 and LPA 35 of 2023 have been preferred against the
common judgment and order dated 09.05.2014 passed in SWP Nos.1352 of 2010, 1802 of 2009,
1270 of 2009, 1527 of 2009, 1478 of 2009, 1177 of 2009, 1257 of 2009, 1527 of 2009, 998 of 2013,
777 of 2013, 778 of 2013, and 211 of 2017, whereby the Ld. Single Judge had quashed the selection of
the appellants and some others as Constables (Operators).
The issue involved in these letters patent appeals relate to the validity of the appointments made to
the posts of Constables (Operator) in the districts, based on district-wise select lists in
contradistinction to the rival contention that the appointments should have been made based on
State level select list as the advertisement did not provide for appointment by preparing district wise
merit lists.
3. In WP (C) Nos. 1546 of 2021, l548 of 2021, l684 of 2021, 1585 of 2021 and 736 of 2023, the
judgment and order dated 28.07.2021 passed by the Ld. Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT),
Jammu Bench in TA No. 62/864/2021 has been challenged, by which the Ld. CAT had set aside the
Government order dated 10.07.2018 appointing the appellants/petitioners as Wireless Assistants,
after their appointments as Constables (Operator) were terminated by the earlier judgment and
order dated 09.05.2014 passed in SWP No.1352 of 2010 and batch of writ petitions referred to
above.
In this batch of writ petitions, the writ petitioners are those, who were earlier appointed as
Constables (Operator) whose services were subsequently terminated in terms of the common
judgment and order dated 09.05.2014 passed in SWP No.1352/2010 and batch of writ petitions out
of which the present LPAs have arisen and were subsequently appointed as Wireless Assistants vide
order dated 10.07.2018. Their appointments as Wireless Assistants were set aside by the Ld. CAT
vide dated 28.07.2021 passed in T.A.No. 62/864/2021. Thus, being aggrieved by the order of the Ld.
CAT, these writ petitions have been filed impugning the same.
4. The appellants in the LPAs were initially appointed as Constables (Operator) as per the merit
list/select list prepared district-wise, in terms of an advertisement issued on 09.03.2007, whose
appointments were successfully challenged by the private respondents in these LPAs primarily on
the ground that appointments to these posts were to be made on the basis of the select list prepared
at the State level and not by preparing district wise select list as had been done.
5. The Ld. Single Judge allowed the writ petitions challenging these appointments vide common
judgment and order dated 09.05.2014 passed in SWP No. 1352 of 2010 and batch of writ petitions
now impugned in these letters patent appeals by which the appointments of the appellants were
quashed, and the official respondents were directed to make fresh appointments by preparing a
state-level merit list within 4 (four) months.
6. As we proceed to examine the issues, it may be apposite to keep in mind certain aspects of the
relevant law while dealing with direct recruitment as these disputed appointments are by way of
direct recruitment.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123360706/ 3
Manmohan Khajuria &Ors. vs . Sheikh Muzaffar Ahmad &Ors. on 24 November, 2023
7. It is now well settled that direct recruitment is to be normally made after notifying the vacancies
by public notification to conform to the requirement of the equal opportunity clause for public
employment mandated under Article 16 of the Constitution of India. The advertisement has to be,
without any exception, in conformity with the service rules or the recruitment rules governing the
posts. Thus, the eligibility criteria for posts as per the service rules are to be mentioned in the
advertisement so as to enable the aspirant candidates to know the essential requirements while
seeking appointments, since no one can be appointed who does not fulfil the essential criteria for the
post. The number of posts or vacancies sought to be filled up are to be mentioned, as well as the
different categories of reservations, vertical and/or horizontal, if any, in the advertisement.
In short, the public notification or the advertisement, which is an invitation to the eligible
candidates, will ordinarily be a mirror reflection of the provisions of the service rules governing the
posts, as appointment to such advertised posts has to be in accordance with the service rules. As a
corollary, the terms and conditions mentioned in the public notification/advertisements cannot be
in conflict with the service rules, as the service rules are generally statutory in nature and thus have
the force of law and have to be meticulously followed. The terms and conditions mentioned in the
advertisement, thus, cannot be in derogation of the service rules.
The advertisement for the posts, should also indicate the manner in which the recruitment is to be
conducted as provided under the service rules. The way the recruitment process is to be carried out,
must be in conformity with the service rules and if there be any deviation from the service rules, the
recruitment process will be vulnerable to impeachment and may be rendered invalid.
8. Keeping the aforesaid fundamental legal position relating to recruitment by direct recruitment in
mind, we may examine the relevant facts beginning with the advertisement.
9. The Advertisement issued on 09.03.2007 reads as follows:
"POLICE HEADQUARTERS J&K JAMMU ADVERTISEMENT NOTICE.

10. Though the aforesaid advertisement mentioned the essential
qualifications, it did not mention either the number of posts of Constables (Operator) to be filled up
under the unreserved/open category or any other reserved category, as normally the advertisement
is required to indicate the number of posts sought to be filled up and future/ anticipated vacancies,
if any and the manner the selection was to be made, whether by preparing district wise merit list or
state level merit list, though there is a reference to SRO 294 of 2005 in the impugned judgment and
order relating to reservation.

Manmohan Khajuria &Ors. vs . Sheikh Muzaffar Ahmad &Ors. on 24 November, 2023
11. It was the case of the petitioners in the aforesaid writ petitions out of which the present LPAs
have arisen that since applications were invited from eligible candidates and selection process
undertaken at the state level, the appointments ought to have been made on the basis of the state
level merit list. It was also pleaded that the district-wise vacancies were not mentioned in the
advertisement, nor it was clarified that the district wise select list would be prepared for filling up
these posts district-wise. There was no stipulation in the advertisement that the candidates would be
considered based on their residential status in the district, which is normally the case when district
cadre posts are filled up. When appointments are made to district cadre posts, the candidates
belonging to such district are given preference in appointments subject to merit, which condition is
to be mentioned in the advertisement to enable the concerned candidate to submit relevant
supporting documents like residential certificates, etc. But in the present case, the district-wise
vacancies of the posts of Constables (Operator) were not indicated in the advertisement. Though the
physical tests were carried out in the respective districts, the written test was conducted centrally
through the office of the Inspector General of Police.
There was no stipulation in the advertisement that candidates belonging to a particular district
would be chosen for appointment in the respective district. Though appointments were made
district wise, yet, it was not based on the State level select list, in as much as candidates not
belonging to the district were not offered appointments to other districts. As a result, candidates
who were otherwise high in the merit list were not given appointments since, they did not belong to
the district. Further, since it was not notified in the advertisement of the vacancies in the district,
the candidates were not able to know whether they would be offered appointment in their respective
districts or not, which aspect appears to have swayed the Ld. Single Judge in quashing appointment
orders.
12. Thus, this silence about the manner of recruitment in the advertisement that it would be
district-based recruitment by preparing district-wise merit lists and appointments accordingly were
to be given district-wise, did not find favour with the Ld. Single Judge who took the view that since
the advertisement did not mention that district-wise select lists would be prepared and accordingly
appointments made, the appointments made based on the district-wise select list were held to be
infringement of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India and thus void, warranting quashing of
such appointments and directions were issued for redrawing a fresh State level select list and to
make fresh appointment to the various districts based on the state level merit list. The Ld. Single
Judge also noted that the number of vacancies in the districts was not indicated in the
advertisement leaving a scope for manipulation. Accordingly, the Ld. Single Judge found the
appointments unsustainable in law and quashed the same.
13. Though the number of vacancies were not indicated in the advertisement, during the initial
round of litigation challenging the aforesaid appointments of the appellants, the Official
Respondents informed the Court that the total number of posts of Constables (Operator) that were
sought to be filled up was 1126, but the Select List was prepared consisting of 925 candidates, which
was challenged in SWP No. 1478 of 2009, in which the said Select List was stayed. Several writ
petitions were also filed challenging the aforesaid Select list in SWP Nos. 1802 of 2009, 1270 of
2009, 1527 of 2009, 1177 of 2009, 1267 of 2009. Once the Select List was acted upon and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123360706/ 7
Manmohan Khajuria &Ors. vs . Sheikh Muzaffar Ahmad &Ors. on 24 November, 2023
appointment orders issued in favour of the selected candidates as Constables (Operator) in the year
2010, a fresh petition was filed as SWP No. 1532 of 2010 challenging these appointment orders.
Some other petitions, SWP Nos. 998 of 2013, 777 of 2013, 778 of 2013 were also filed challenging the
appointments. While some of the writ petitioners abandoned their claims because of employment
elsewhere or other reasons, 167 petitioners continued with their pursuit.
14. The aforesaid writ petitions were disposed of by the impugned common judgment and order
dated 09.05.2014 quashing the appointments of the appellants by holding that the post of Constable
(Operator) was a state cadre post and the staff is to be recruited at the state level and after
recruitment, the staff are to be allotted to the districts on need basis. It was also held that the
recruitment process was made in gross violation of J& K Reservation Act, 2004, and rules made
thereunder. Hence, the selection and appointments made on district level merit list was not
sustainable and accordingly, a direction was issued to the State Government to revise the select list
by preparing the merit list at the state level and consider appointment in order of merit against 1126
posts, even though the number of posts was not mentioned in the advertisement. It was also
directed that selection and appointment of such of the Constables (Operator) who find place in the
reframed select list and having regard to their place in the merit list and the number of vacancies to
be filled up, make the grade for their appointment, shall remain intact and undisturbed. The
aforesaid exercise was directed to be completed as far as possible within four weeks from the date of
receipt of a copy of the judgment.
15. It is significant to note that the Ld. Single Judge directed redrawing of merit list at the state level
and making appointments accordingly as far as possible within 4 months vide impugned judgment
and order dated 09.05.2014, the State authorities did not comply with the same immediately and
instead the Director General of Police, Jammu & Kashmir wrote to the then Additional Advocate
General on 20.11.2014 making a request for exploring the possibility of retaining the appellants in
service and to extend assurance to the Court that the State Government was willing to accommodate
the writ petitioners in SWP No. 1352 of 2010 and other writ petitioners who come within the cut off
mark as per merit for appointment.
The Police Department was concerned that implementation of the impugned order would result in
ousting of wireless operators dealing with sensitive areas of the functioning of the Police
Department and would have serious repercussions not only on the security of the state, but also on
the individuals and their families.
16. In the light of the aforesaid communication of the Director General of Police, a review petition,
being Review Petition (SW) No. 33 of 2014 came to be filed, which however, was dismissed on
25.02.2015 on the ground that the there was no error apparent on the face of record but the Court
left it to the wisdom of the State Government to accommodate the writ petitioners for appointment
and also save the appointment of the appellants. However, in spite of dismissal of the review
petition, the State government apparently did not take any steps immediately for redrawing the
merit list as directed by the Ld. Single Judge as aforesaid.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123360706/ 8
Manmohan Khajuria &Ors. vs . Sheikh Muzaffar Ahmad &Ors. on 24 November, 2023
17. It was only after about 3 (three) years, that the Police Department reframed the select list at the
state level on the basis of which the appellants were removed from service vide termination order
dated 19.01.2017, and an equal number of candidates came to be appointed as Constables
(Operator) based on the state level merit list prepared.
18. Naturally, the appellants being aggrieved by the aforesaid termination order dated 19.01.2017
challenged the same by filing a writ petition, being SWP No. 114 of 2017 on the ground that though
the select list was supposed to be redrawn within four weeks, the same was drawn after almost three
years and as such the appellants were deprived of the opportunity to challenge the acts of the
respondent authorities within 90 days by filing any appeal and sought stay of the termination order
dated 19.01.2017, and the writ Court vide order on 27.01.2017duly granted a stay of the said
termination order dated 19.01.2017. Thus, by virtue of the stay order, the appellants were entitled to
remain in service.
19. Despite the stay order granted by the writ Court, the State government appointed the candidates
based on state level merit list vide order dated 12.06.2017 which came to be challenged by the
appellants in SWP No. 1157 of 2017 contending that once the termination of the appellants was
stayed by the Court, there could not have been any vacancy against which these candidates were
appointed. The said writ petition, SWP No. 1157 of 2017 was however, dismissed by the writ Court
on 28.06.2017 on the ground that the appointments were pursuant to the judgment dated
09.05.2014 passed in the SWP No. 1352 of 2010 and other writ petitions, and no error was
committed by the State Government in appointing them. Appeal preferred against the aforesaid
dismissal order dated 28.06.2017 passed in SWP No. 1157 of 2017 in LPA no. 122 of 2017 was
dismissed on 18.08.2017.
20. It may be noted that while the said writ petition, SWP No. 114 of 2017 was pending in which the
termination of the appellants was challenged and an interim order was passed staying the
termination of the service of the appellants, the appellants had sought to challenge the original
judgment and order dated 09.05.2014 passed in SWP No. 1352 of 2010 and batch of petitions
quashing the appointment of the appellants by filing a letters patent appeal, which was registered as
LPA (SW) No. 144 of 2017, but since there was delay in filing the said appeal, a condonation
application being COAD No. 51 of 2017 was also filed.
21. However, the said condonation application, COAD No. 51 of 2017 was dismissed by the Division
Bench on 19.08.2017, and as against the said dismissal of the condonation application, the
appellants approached the Hon'ble Supreme Court by filing SLP (C) No. 26437 of 2017 which was
withdrawn by the appellants, and approached this Court by filing a review petition against the order
of dismissal of the condonation application, which was registered as RPLPA No. 17 of 2017.
22. While the said review petition was pending, on the basis of a Cabinet decision, the Government
issued an order under No. 891-Home, dated 10.07.2018 granting sanction for creation of 151 posts
of Wireless Assistants at the monthly honorarium of Rs. 2500/- as a one-time relaxation and
engaged the appellants numbering 151 against these newly created posts with the condition that the
appellants would be regularised in these posts after 10 years of service, with the further condition
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123360706/ 9
Manmohan Khajuria &Ors. vs . Sheikh Muzaffar Ahmad &Ors. on 24 November, 2023
that the service rendered by the appellants as Constables (Operator) prior to their appointment as
Wireless Assistants shall be taken into consideration for counting 10 years of service for
regularisation.
23. After appointment of the appellants as Wireless Assistants, the Review Petition being no. RPLPA
No. 17 of 2017 preferred against the dismissal of the condonation application was also dismissed by
the Review Court on 28.01.2019. Consequently, the impugned judgment and order dated
09.05.2014 passed by the learned Single Judge in SWP No.1352 of 2010 etc., remained undisturbed
till then.
24. The re-engagement of the appellants as Wireless Assistants on 10.07.2018 after creation of
corresponding number of posts was however, challenged by some of the candidates by filing a writ
petition, being SWP No. 1637 of 2018, on the ground that these newly created posts were not
advertised before being filled up and thus, the engagement was violative of equality opportunity
clause for public employment under Article 16 of the Constitution. However, the writ Court did not
pass any interim order staying the appointment of the appellants and accordingly, the appellants
continued to serve as Wireless Assistants. Later the aforesaid writ petition, SWP No. 1637 of 2018
was transferred to the Ld. Central Administrative Tribunal, Jammu Bench as TA No. 864 of 2021.
25. During the pendency of the aforesaid TA No. 864 of 2021 before the Ld. CAT, the appellants
preferred a Special Leave Petition, registered as SLP No. 11568 of 2019 challenging the order dated
28.01.2019 passed in the review petition, RPLPA No. 17 of 2017.
26. It may be observed that as per the selection list at the state level for the Constables (Operators)
issued vide Order no. 251 of 2020 dated 29.08.2020, out of 1226 posts, 841 are shown to have been
filed up, thus, 251 posts remain vacant.
27. The Ld. Central Administrative Tribunal which considered TA No. 864 of 2021 dismissed the
application on 28.07.2021 on the ground that the appointments of the appellants were made
without advertising the posts, thus denying opportunities to the applicants of the right to be
considered for appointment to these posts.
28. The appellants preferred a writ petition against the aforesaid judgment and order of the learned
Central Administrative Tribunal passed in TA no. 864 of 2021 by filing writ petition, SWP No. 1548
of 2021 and by an interim order passed by this Court on 05.08.2021, the judgment and order of the
learned CAT was stayed, because of which the appellants continued to serve as Wireless Assistants.
29. While the said SWP No.1548 of 2021 was pending and the appellants continued in service, the
Civil Appeal No. 919-920/202 after granting leave in SLP No. 11568 of 2019, was allowed by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court by setting aside both order dated 19.08.2017 passed by the Division Bench
in COAD No. 521 of 2017, by which the application seeking condonation of delay was dismissed, and
also the order dated 28.01.2019 passed in RPLPA No. 17 of 2017, and the Hon'ble Supreme Court
requested the Division Bench to decide the LPA No. 114 of 2017 along with all the connected
matters.

Manmohan Khajuria &Ors. vs . Sheikh Muzaffar Ahmad &Ors. on 24 November, 2023
That is how this appeal, LPA No. 114 of 2007 is before us and being heard with other LPAs,
challenging the same order dated 09.05.2014 passed by the Ld. Single Judge in SWP No.1352 of
2010 and other petitions.
30. In this regard, it may be apposite to reproduce the relevant portions of the order passed by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court as follows:
"9. As regards other appellants, in the peculiar circumstances of the case and the very
nature of the order dated 09.05.2014, it cannot be held that each and every candidate
was bound to challenge the same by assuming that his candidature was to be rejected
or that he was to be displaced from the select list. Even if they were the parties to the
writ petitions, we are clearly of the view that their cases also deserve consideration
and could not have been rejected merely for they having taken up the challenge after
issuance of the revised merit list. Moreover, the other features of the case, including
the fact that large number of them had already put in substantial years of service
could not have been ignored altogether." (emphasis supplied)
31. The significance of the aforesaid observation of the Hon'ble Supreme Court is that the appellants
had already put in substantial years of service which could not have been ignored altogether by the
Division Bench of this Court while dismissing the application and review application seeking
condonation of delay.
32. From the above, the position which emerges before us is that there is a batch of letters patent
appeals i.e., LPASW No.114 of 2017 etc., preferred against the order dated 09.05.2014 passed in
SWP No. 1352 of 2010 and batch of writ petitions, by which the appointment of the appellants as
Constables (Operator) had been quashed which require adjudication by us.
Further, there is another batch of writ petitions in which the judgment and order dated 28.07.2021
passed by the Ld. Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), Jammu Bench in TA No. 62/864/2021
has been challenged, by which the Ld. CAT had set aside the Government order dated 10.07.2018
appointing the appellants as Wireless Assistants. As noted earlier, it is these Wireless Assistants,
who were earlier appointed a Constables (Operator), but their services as Constables (Operator)
were terminated in terms of the judgment and order dated 09.05.2014 passed in SWP No. 1352 of
2010 and batch of writ petitions.
Though these two sets of proceedings arise out of different orders passed by different judicial fora,
i.e., High Court in exercise of Article 226 of the Constitution and another by the Central
Administrative Tribunal, these are closely interconnected and have affected the same persons,
having suffered adverse orders in both the sets of proceedings.
Hence, these two proceedings were taken up together so that all these LPAs and the writ petitions
can be disposed of with consistent orders.

33. Because of the subsequent developments which have taken place since the quashing of the initial
appointments of the appellants as Constables (Operator) by the impugned judgment and order
dated 09.04.2014 and subsequent appointment of these appellants as Wireless Assistants as
discussed above, these appellants in the LPAs, though were initially appointed as Constables
(Operator) have continued in service, albeit in a different capacity as Wireless Assistants, and there
are some candidates, though had participated in the initial recruitment process as per
Advertisement dated 09.03.2007, but were neither appointed as Constables (Operator) nor as
Wireless Assistants as they could not make it on merit, yet they successfully challenged the
appointment of the appellants as Wireless Assistants before the Ld. CAT who are also before us.
34. Under the circumstances, it has been the collective plea of the appellants and the aforesaid
candidates that the appellants may be adjusted against the exiting vacancies in the posts of
Constables (Operator) because of the long service they have rendered as Constables (Operator) and
Wireless Assistants, and it is the case of the remaining candidates that if the appellants are adjusted
as above, there will be sufficient vacant posts in the Wireless Assistant, where they could be
adjusted.
35. However, before we examine this plea, which is essentially based on equity, we would like the
examine the correctness of the decision of the High Court in the writ petitions out of which the
present set of Letters Patent Appeals have arisen and also the decision of the Ld. CAT.
36. As regards the challenge to the findings by the Ld. Single Judge in SWP No. 1352 of 2010 and
batch of writ petitions, it can be observed that the basis for arriving at such conclusions by the Ld.
Single Judge can be summarised as follows:
i) The Advertisement was not tailored to the requirements of the rules as it neither
mentioned the number of posts to be filled up district-wise with the attending
number of reserved posts, nor the candidates informed that the selection would be
made at the district level.
ii) Ld. Single Judge observed that even though physical and outdoor tests were
conducted at the district level, the written test and viva voice were conducted at the
State level under the supervision of the Inspector General of Police, which clearly
shows that it was State level recruitment process.
iii) Resultantly, many candidates were put to a disadvantageous position by
converting merit to demerit as many candidates who were otherwise more
meritorious, were left out of the district-wise appointments. The Ld. Single Judge
noted that for example, in respect of Anantnag District, the cut-off mark was 78, and
for Ganderbal, 91.
As a result, many meritorious candidates who might have hailed from Ganderbal district and scored
more than 78 could not be appointed in Anantnag District though they may be more meritorious
than many of those appointed in Anantnag. Similarly, in Shopian district, the cut- off mark was 62,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123360706/ 12
Manmohan Khajuria &Ors. vs . Sheikh Muzaffar Ahmad &Ors. on 24 November, 2023
in Ramban district, it was 67 and in Jammu, it was 71, whereas it was high in Ganderbal with 91,
Baramulla at 87, Budgam at 86, etc. Thus, because of this large disparity in the cut-off marks in the
districts, many meritorious candidates could not be appointed merely because, they do not hail from
the districts where the cut-off marks were less, thus causing great anomaly and depriving them of
the opportunity of being appointed despite being placed at higher merit position at the State level.
iv) According to the Ld. Single Judge, this anomalous situation could have been avoided had the
appointments been made based on the merit prepared State-wise and not district-wise, more so
when the Advertisement did not mention that the merit lists would be prepared district-wise, and
appointments made accordingly.
v) Though, apparently, the appointments were made district-wise as per the population, the Ld.
Single Judge noted that the number of appointments made did not correspond to the population,
hence, there was an element of capriciousness and arbitrariness, thus giving room for manipulation.
The Ld. Single noted that 36 posts had been allotted to Doda District which has a population of
4,09,576, whereas only 33 posts were allotted to Udhampur District with a population of 5,55,357.
Similarly, Reasi District with a population of 3,14,114 got 12 posts, whereas Shopian District with a
population of 2,65,960 got 20 posts. The Ld. Single Judge, therefore, found the appointments quite
inconsistent with the district population.
vi) Ld. Single Judge also observed that reservations for various categories were not properly
maintained.
vii) The Ld. Single Judge also discounted the contention of the respondents that appointments were
made in terms of Rules 172 and 176 of the J&K Police Rules, 1960 which were held not applicable to
the case.
37. Ld. Single Judge, accordingly, held that the consequence of such a recruitment process was that
it led to discrimination based on birth or residence which, in the absence of earlier stipulation in the
advertisement will lead to infringement of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.
38. The Ld. Single Judge, thus, concluded that even if the appointments were made in 2010, in view
of the unfair and arbitrary selection process which smacks of favouritism, such an injustice cannot
be condoned on the ground of delay and public largesse in the form of public employment cannot be
meted out in the manner in which it has been done and accordingly, quashed the select lists and the
appointments orders issued pursuant thereto and directed the official respondents to prepare a
fresh select list at the State level on the basis of merit secured by the candidates and make
appointments accordingly. It was however, ordered that the appointment of those candidates who
again figure in the freshly determined State level select List shall remain undisturbed, which
exercise was to be completed within four months, i.e., by 8 November 2014.
39. As regards the aforesaid findings of the Ld. Single Judge in the impugned judgment and order
dated 09.05.2014, the contentions of the appellants may be stated as follows.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123360706/ 13
Manmohan Khajuria &Ors. vs . Sheikh Muzaffar Ahmad &Ors. on 24 November, 2023
(i) It has been submitted on behalf of the appellants that the writ court was not right in holding that
the post of Wireless Operator (Constable) is a 'State Cadre' Post. It was submitted that neither the
advertisement nor selection process nor the ultimate order of appointment establishes that the post
in question is 'State Cadre' post. It was further submitted that 'Cadre Management' is the absolute
prerogative of Government and the court has no jurisdiction to direct the Government either to
create a cadre or readjust existing cadre or to deal with in any manner with categorisation.
(ii) Since it was the stand of official respondents before the writ Court that post of Wireless Operator
is a 'District Cadre' post, the Ld. Single Judge ought not have upset the Selection/appointment of
appellants on the ground of issue relating to 'Cadre Management'.
(iii) That the grade of Wireless Operator (Constable) is Rs.5200- 20200+1900 and all Constables in
the Police Department carry the same grade. It is only the specialized services rendered which
distinguishes this class of Constables from other Constables. The duties are also not of same nature.
But despite these differences, the post of Constable or Wireless Operator (Constable) continues to be
in the same category.
(iv) There are several wings in the Police Department, but the designation of a class of people, even
if working in a different wing of the Department, remains that of Constable. This position holds too
in Traffic Wing, Security Wing, C.I.D Wing, Crime Branch, Executive Wing, Auxiliary Wing, Armed
Wing etc., and pay scale of all Constables in all these wings is same and identical and all the
Constables are appointed by an Officer of S.P Rank of the respective wing.
(v) It was the contention of the writ petitioners in the first round of litigation that they are more
meritorious when list is made at "state level" and less meritorious in their respective districts.
In this regard, the official respondents had, in their affidavit, shown the basis of adjusting posts of
Constables (Operators) in a district based on population ratio. It has submitted that when the select
list is made District wise, difference in merit is bound to occur. According to the appellants, since
appointment to the post of Constable (Operator) is to be made district wise based on 'Cadre
Management', comparison of merit between candidates, belonging to different districts becomes
irrelevant.
(vi) It was also contended that the Hon'ble Supreme Court while condoning the delay on 24.01.2023
in filing the LPA against the order dated 09.05.2014 has acknowledged that the cases of the
appellants merit consideration and the LPAs should not have been rejected solely because they
challenged the decision after the issuance of the revised merit list. Furthermore, the Supreme Court
took into account the fact that a significant number of the appellants had already served substantial
years in their positions and this aspect of the case should not be ignored in its entirety.
(vii) It has been submitted that over the years, the Apex Court, while considering cases for quashing
of appointments, has consistently emphasized the importance of equity and the principle of
balancing competing interests. It is recognized that the strict application of legal rules may
sometimes lead to harsh or unjust outcomes, especially in cases where incumbents have served in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123360706/ 14
Manmohan Khajuria &Ors. vs . Sheikh Muzaffar Ahmad &Ors. on 24 November, 2023
their positions for a considerable period.
(viii) It has been also submitted that the appellants have been in service in the department for more
than a decade and the appellants have been trained in the Police Wireless Communication Code and
due to the nature of their service, are privy to sensitive information. It is also important to mention
here that the Police Wireless Communication Codes and other ancillary communication codes are
only in the knowledge of the Wireless operators and even the highest Officials in the Department are
not privy to the same. These codes are used by the Police Department all over India and the
appellants have spent a considerable time in the department and have also gained a valuable
experience in the said field. Since appellants are privy to these sensitive information and
communication codes that are exclusively only accessible to operators, they are exposed to
significant risks and potential threats.
(ix) The appellants also contend that the appellants had actively participated in the selection process
and were rightfully appointed to the posts and the Department on its own accord and past practices
had issued the selection list at the District Level. The entire selection process was carried out
following the prescribed procedure, without any mala-fide intentions. There is no allegation that in
the process of selection, any fraud or undue influence was played by the appellants for securing their
appointment as Constables (Operators). The equity in such a situation would tilt in favour of the
appellants who were appointed after participating in the selection process conducted by the official
respondents. Furthermore, many of the appellants have now exceeded the age limit to be eligible for
entry into any other service. In view of the aforesaid challenging circumstances, the Cabinet took a
compassionate view by creating the posts of "Wireless Assistants" to accommodate the appellants,
which have been also challenged.
(x) It has been submitted on behalf of the appellants that in view of the seniority list of Constables
(Operators) appointed from 2010 onwards published by Police Telecommunication J&K on 29.08.
2020, it appears that a total of 841 positions are occupied in the Department out of 1126 against
which the selection was made pursuant to the Court's order dated 09.05.2014, leaving 285 posts
vacant. Keeping in view the vacancies, the appellants pleaded that they may be accommodated
against the aforesaid vacancies.
(xi) The appellants also contend that as per the order dated 27.01.2017 passed in SWP 114/2017, this
Court had directed that the appellants be allowed to continue at the post they had held, and the
respondents were also directed to release their salaries. The said order provided an interim
protection to the appellants which is still continuing. Therefore, if this Court allows the appeal, it
should also extend notional benefits to the appellants.
(xii) Thus, keeping in view the chequered history of the case, the protracted litigation and peculiar
facts and circumstances of the case, it has been pleaded that the equities tilts in favour of the
appellants Constables (Operators). It has been submitted that from the very inception of the Home
Department, the recruitment and selection to the post of Constable (Operator) has been done by
PHQ by preparing merit at district level i.e. for the last more than 70 years, and the selection at
district level in the year 2009 of which the appellants were beneficiaries, was not a deviation from
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123360706/ 15
Manmohan Khajuria &Ors. vs . Sheikh Muzaffar Ahmad &Ors. on 24 November, 2023
the settled practice. Apart from that, there is not fraud committed by the Department or the
appellants and at the most it can be said to be an irregularity to which the appellants were not privy.
40. Ld. Senior Counsel/counsel appearing for the appellants have contended that the appellants
having been allowed to serve for such a long time in the capacity of Constables (Operators) and
Wireless Assistants, it would be inequitable, and cause immense injustice to them, if their
appointments as Wireless Assistants are interfered with for the simple reason that there was no
advertisement for the posts when they were appointed as such.
It has been submitted that when they were initially appointed as Constables (Operator), they were
so appointed on the basis of district wise merit list, and they were not involved in any fraud. The
irregularities in the recruitment process and their appointment as Constables (Operator) are plainly
attributable to the official respondents with which they had nothing to do and as such they cannot
be made to suffer for the negligence of the official respondents. It has been also submitted that these
posts of Wireless Assistants were created specially to accommodate the appellants considering the
long service rendered by the appellants as Constables (Operator) and the training they had
undergone, which is quite sensitive in nature.
It is their plea that they had competed along with other eligible candidates and had crossed the
benchmark for appointment as Constables (Operator) and hence, they are quite suitable and fit to be
appointed as Wireless Assistants.
41. In support of their plea they have pressed into service a number of decisions as follows.
(i) Tejinder Kaur v. Raj Kumari, (2009) 1 SCC 177.
(ii) Tridip Kumar Dingal v. State of W.B., (2009) 1 SCC 768.
(iii) Rajesh Kumar v. State of Bihar, (2013) 4 SCC 690.
(iv) Tajvir Singh Sodhi and Ors. vs. The State of Jammu and Kashmir and Ors AIR 2023 SC 2014.
(v) LPASW No. 80/2016, titled "Narinder Singh and Ors. v/s Vijay Kumar and Ors.
42. Having heard the Ld. Counsel for the parties and on perusal of the impugned order dated
09.05.2014 passed by the Ld. Single Judge, we are also in agreement with the Ld. Single Judge on
many counts, though on some, we would like to give our own views.
43. One of the hotly contested issues was whether the post of Constable (Operator) is a District
Cadre post or a state cadre post.
The Ld. Single Judge appears to have taken the view that Superintendents of Police of District does
not have the power to appoint Constable (Operator) borne on Telecommunication Wing only
because posts of Constables (Operator) are allocated before or after recruitment to a district and
Directorate of Police Communication is set up at State level and staff is also to be recruited at State
level, and after recruitment, allocated to districts on need basis. The Ld. Single also took the view
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123360706/ 16
Manmohan Khajuria &Ors. vs . Sheikh Muzaffar Ahmad &Ors. on 24 November, 2023
that the Government orders by which the posts have been created/sanctioned at different levels in
Police Department from time also lend support to the aforesaid conclusion. The Ld. Single Judge
also noted that after the selection process are completed, appointment orders of the selected
candidates based on district wise merit were issued by Police of respective districts also lead to the
conclusion that selection was made at State level and appointment orders were passed at State level,
though selection made on the basis of district-wise merit list. The view of the Ld. Single Judge
appears to be that it is not a district cadre post.
44. As regards this issue, we would like to observe that while the view taken by the Ld. Single Judge
does appear to be based on the practice and official documents, it does not appear to be consistent
with the J&K Police Rules, 1960. It is also true that the post of Constable (Operator) is not
specifically mentioned in the aforesaid rules, yet, if we accept the view of the Ld. Single Judge, it
would have the effect of carving out a distinct category of Constables who are working as wireless
operators, known as "Constables (Operator)" who would be treated as State Cadre in
contradistinction to the "Constables" who are borne on district roll and the Superintendent of Police
of the District is the appointing authority. Thus, there will be two sets of Constables, one who are
wireless operators, known as "Constables (Operator)" and other "Constables". This differentiation
and classification may have serious implications in the service conditions amongst the constables for
which it would be appropriate for the competent authority to clarify the same. In any disciplinary
proceeding the hierarchy of the official to take appropriate actions including appellate and reviewing
authority becomes relevant. If the Constables (Operator) are appointed by the Police Headquarters
and not by the Superintendent of Police of respective Districts as observed by the Ld. Single Judge,
and if the appointing authority of other constables is Superintendent Police of the District, who will
be the disciplinary authority, appellate authority and reviewing authority in respect of Constables
(Operator) in the matter of disciplinary proceedings and how the inter se seniority of the Constables
and Constables (Operator) are to be maintained, separately or together? These are some of the
questions which will crop up which would require to be clarified by the authority concerned in the
J& K Police Rules of 1960.
Classification of cadre, based on the nature of service rendered, is within the domain of the
executive, and in view of lack of clarity in the relevant rules, and in order to avoid any such
controversies in future it is desirable that the concerned authority in the Government clarifies this
issue, as to whether the Constables (Operator) is a State cadre to be recruited only at the State level
and as to who is the appropriate appointing authority in contradistinction to the position that the
appointing authority of the constables in general is the Superintendent of Police of the District.
45. As regards the applicability of Rules 172 and 176 of the J&K Police Rules, 1960 in the present
case, the Ld. Single Judge was of the view that these rules are not applicable in the present case.
46. Rule 172 of the Police Rules reads as follows:
"172. Authorities empowered to make appointment (1) Recruitment to the rank of
Assistant Superintendents of Police is governed by the Indian Service (Recruitment)
Rules, 1954.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123360706/ 17

Deputy Superintendents of Police are appointed in accordance with the rules prepared by the Public
Service Commission and sanctioned by Government from time to time.

(3) The power to confirm the appointment of officers appointed on probation vests in
the case of gazetted officers with the Government and in the case of Inspectors, Sub-
Inspectors and Assistant Sub-Inspectors with the Inspector- General of Police in the case of Head
Constables, Senior Grade with the Deputy Inspector-General and in the case of Head Constables
Junior Grade and Constables with the Superintendents of Police.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123360706/ 18
Manmohan Khajuria &Ors. vs . Sheikh Muzaffar Ahmad &Ors. on 24 November, 2023
(4) The seniority of Inspectors and Sub-Inspectors shall be inter-range. Assistant Sub Inspectors
shall be borne on range rolls and shall receive range constabulary numbers.
Head Constables and Constables in each district shall be borne on district rolls and shall receive
district constabulary numbers.
(5) The seniority list of Sub-Inspectors appointed after issuance of this notification against any
direct Department, recruitment posts in the Executive and the Armed wing of the Police shall be
combined and maintained as per the applicable rules.
47. From the reading of Rule 172, the following can be gathered:
(i) Rule 172(1) provides that the Superintendent of Police is the appointing authority
in respect of Constables.
(ii) As per Rule 172 (2) all appointments to non-gazetted ranks, [which includes the
post of Constable (Operator)] by direct recruitment shall be made by the appointing
authority on consideration of recommendations of the Jammu and Kashmir Services
Selection Board (SSB).
(iii) Rule 172 (4) provides that Constables in each district shall be borne on district
rolls and shall receive district constabulary numbers.
48. Thus, what is discernible is that the post of constable is a district cadre post, and consequently,
the post is to be filled up district-wise, which means that the district-wise vacancies are to be
indicated at the time of recruitment.
49. However, as discussed above, there is no clarity as to whether Constable (Operator) is also to be
treated as Constable within the scope of Rule 172 and other provisions of the Police Rules, 1960,
which requires to be clarified by the respondent authorities to obviate any future controversies.
50. In the present case, we are also in agreement with the Ld. Single Judge that in absence of
stipulation in the Advertisement that the post is to be filled up on the basis of district wise merit list,
and only the residents of the district will be considered for appointment in that particular district, it
would be impermissible to prepare a district wise merit to the exclusion of more meritorious
candidates who do not hail from the particular district. It will certainly prejudice the interest of
more meritorious persons who would not be able to make grade in the district wise merit list, simply
because they are not residents of the district.
51. We have also observed that how the District Cadre Constable post is to be filled up is also not
specifically provided in the J & K Police Rules, 1960. The rules are silent about it, unlike in the case
of Jammu and Kashmir Subordinate Service Recruitment Rules, 1992 wherein as per the
amendment made to the said rules by SRO 343 dated 13th October, 2004, preference has been given
to the candidates who are residents of the district concerned and only a candidate can apply under
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123360706/ 19
Manmohan Khajuria &Ors. vs . Sheikh Muzaffar Ahmad &Ors. on 24 November, 2023
one district. However, there is no such provision under the of the J&K Police Rules, 1960.
Nevertheless, in view of the provision under Rule 172(4) of the J&K Police Rules, 1960, as the post of
"Constable" is borne on the district rolls and shall receive district constabulary number, and the
appointment authority is the concerned Superintendent of Police, by inference the appointments are
to be made district wise. Even assuming that the post of Constable (Operator) is covered by Rule 172
of the J& K Police rules, as observed above, since there is no such stipulation in the Advertisement
that only candidates from a district can apply for the vacancies in the particular district and the
appointment will be made district wise it appears, any candidate from other district can also apply
and can be appointed as a constable in a district, provided he is willing to serve in the said district.
52. Though the post of Constable (Operator) is not specifically mentioned under the aforesaid Rule
172 of J&K Police Rules, 1960, the submission advanced before us by the appellants cannot be
ignored to the effect that there are several wings in Police Department like Traffic Wing, Security
Wing, C.I.D Wing, Crime Branch, Executive Wing, Auxiliary Wing, Armed Wing etc. and persons
working in the grade of Constables remains as Constables described according to the units they are
attached to and pay scale of all Constables in all wings is same and identical. All the Constables are
appointed by an Officer of the rank of Superintendent of Police of the respective wing.
53. The problem with the recruitment process in the instant case is that there was no indication in
the advertisement of the number of posts/vacancies available in each of the districts. It is not also
clarified by the official respondents as to whether the appointments made district wise was based on
the actual vacancies occurring in the districts or as per requirements in the districts though the
official respondents tried to justify the contentions that the candidates could have ascertained the
vacancies in the district from the concerned district police.
The Ld. Single Judge was primarily swayed by the fact that the Advertisement did not indicate the
number of vacancies district wise and nor was it clearly mentioned that the appointments would be
made district wise.
Because of these irregularities the Ld. Single Judge was persuaded to hold that the appointments
made were arbitrary and discriminatory, which finding we are not inclined to disturb, though we are
also of the view that the recruitment process otherwise, was not tainted with any malpractice or
fraudulent practice or deliberate discriminatory act on the part of the authorities. The appointment
of the appellants as Constables (Operator) based on district wise merit list appears to have been
motivated by the lack of clarity in the service rules, rather than any mala fide motive, for the
relevant service rules require to be clarified at the earliest as observed above.
54. For the reasons discussed above, we are of the view that the findings and directions of the Ld.
Single Judge as contained in the impugned order dated 09.05.2014 passed in SWP No. 1352 of 2010
and other writ petitions does not warrant interference from our end. In such event, the termination
of the appellants cannot be considered illegal. We, however, would like to add that the appointment
of the appellants as Constables (Operator), though were irregular, could not be said to be wholly
illegal if the post of Constable (Operator) is also treated as a district cadre post, in which case,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123360706/ 20
Manmohan Khajuria &Ors. vs . Sheikh Muzaffar Ahmad &Ors. on 24 November, 2023
district-based appointments could have been permissible if the said conditions were clearly
mentioned in the advertisements. Since, the said conditions that appointments would be made
district wise based on district level merit list were not mentioned in the Advertisement, the Ld.
Single Judge held their appointments to be not valid. It is also to be noted that the appellants were
otherwise, found eligible and also suitable for being appointed as Constables (Operator).
55. Consequently, the subsequent appointment of the appellants as Wireless Assistants by creating
151 posts, which was set aside by the Ld. CAT on being challenged by others will be now the subject
matter of our consideration.
56. We are of the opinion that interfering with the appointment of the appellants as Wireless
Assistants at this stage will be highly inequitable after they have rendered more than 9 (nine) years
in the capacity of Constables (Operator) from 2010 to 2014 and thereafter since 2018 as Wireless
Assistants. The private respondents in the batch of writ petitions where the judgment and order
dated 28.07.2021 was passed by the Ld. CAT in T.A. No. 62/864/2021 have pleaded that there are
sufficient number of vacancies exiting in the posts of Constables (Operator) against which the
present appellants can be adjusted without disturbing the appointments already made to the posts
of Constables (Operator) and they can be easily adjusted against the resultant vacancies of Wireless
Assistants, to which all the contesting private parties had welcomed.
57. In fact, considering the aforesaid proposition emanating from the contesting candidates, this
Court had desired to know from the Government, as to whether the Government is agreeable to such
an arrangement and passed the order on 01.06.2023 by this Court as follows:
"09. Under the aforesaid situation, this Court will be called upon to examine whether
the appointment of these 151 candidates based on District wise merit list was valid or
not. However, this Court has noted that this matter is pertaining to 2009 which has
traversed though various steps of judicial sojourn and still there is uncertainty as to
the respective rights of the petitioners as well as the respondents.
10. It has also been brought to our notice that the advertisement was initially made
for 1126 posts of Constable (Wireless Operators) in the Police Department in the year
2007 but only 925 candidates were selected. Thus, there were 201 vacant posts which
are still lying vacant as not being filled. As per the redrawn list of the State wise merit
list, out of selected 925 candidates 220candidates had to be ousted to accommodate
the new entrants as per the State wise merit list, and out of the aforesaid 220 who
had been ousted, only 151continue to remain in service though in another capacity as
Wireless Assistants. It appears that there are 270 (201+69) vacant posts available and
if the present 151 petitioners are adjusted against the said existing 270 vacant posts of
Wireless Operators, 119 posts are still remaining vacant.
11. It has been brought to our notice by the contesting parties that in addition to the
above 151 candidates whose right is yet to be determined, there are about111
claimants who have been litigating since 2009 though not appointed till now. These
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123360706/ 21
Manmohan Khajuria &Ors. vs . Sheikh Muzaffar Ahmad &Ors. on 24 November, 2023
111 claimants were not found either in the State nor District wise merit list, but, if
they could be adjusted against the 119 number of vacancies after adjustment of the
151 Wireless Assistants as mentioned above, perhaps the long drawn litigation could
come to an happy ending for all the contesting private parties.
12. While pending consideration of the matter on merit, if the respondent authorities
can come up with a proposal to accommodate these 151 Wireless Assistants and 111
claimants to the existing 270 vacant posts of Constables (Wireless Operators) as
these 111 claimants have already taken part in the selection process and if otherwise
not found suitable and also considering the facts that these 151 candidates have been
serving till now, and not only the present 151 candidates, but the other 111 candidates
must have crossed the age bar for seeking appointment in future. perhaps this long
drawn litigation can come to an end even without touching upon the merit of the
case.
13. Under these circumstances, we require the respondent authorities to inform this
Court as to whether they are agreeable to accommodate these 151Wireless Assistants
and 111 candidates against the available vacancies which this Court would welcome. If
such proposal is not forthcoming from the State, obviously, we will proceed to decide
the matter on merit.
14. Let the matter be listed on 8th June 2023 before the same Bench, to be taken up
by hybrid mode."
58. On 08.06.2023, on the basis of submissions made before the court about the exiting vacancies
and number of claimants, this Court clarified the number of candidates and vacancies required for
such an arrangement as follows:
02. It has been brought to our notice today by the learned counsel for the parties that
as on date there are 170 vacant posts of Constable (Wireless Operators) and the
number of those who were found successful and were earlier appointed as Constable
(Wireless Operators) on the basis of District wise merit list will be 151 and these 151
persons are presently working as Wireless Assistants on consolidated pay, and if they
are adjusted against the170 vacant posts of Constable (Wireless Operators), 19 posts
will still remain vacant. On such adjudgments, 151 posts of Wireless Assistants will
become available.
03. It has been informed by Ld. Counsel for the parties that there are 63claimants
who were neither in the District wise merit list nor in the State wise merit, but have
challenged the appointment of 151 Wireless Assistants.
04. It has been submitted that if 151 Wireless Assistants are adjusted against the 170
posts of Constable (Wireless Operators), these 63 claimants can be perhaps adjusted
against the 19 posts of Constable (Wireless Operators) and 151 posts of Wireless

Manmohan Khajuria &Ors. vs . Sheikh Muzaffar Ahmad &Ors. on 24 November, 2023
Assistants.
05. Mr. Rahul Pant, learned Senior Counsel assisted by Ms. Arushi Shukla and the
counsel representing the petitioners/private respondents present today have
submitted that if any such arrangement is made by the State authorities, the same
will be acceptable to all the parties (petitioners/private respondents).
06. In view of the above, we require the respondent authorities to inform this Court
as regards the proposal which has emanated from the parties and as reflected in the
previous order and in today's order.
07. Ms. Monika Kohli, learned Senior Additional Advocate General, submits that she
may be granted some more time to get specific instructions in the matter.
08. In view of the above, as agreed by the parties, the matter stands adjourned to
18th July, 2023.
09. List along-with all connected matters for further consideration on 18thJuly
2023."
59. As the Government did not agree to the aforesaid proposal, this Court continued to hear these
matters to decide on merit.
60. As regards merit of the case, we have already given our view earlier that there is certain
ambiguity about the status of the post of Constable (Operator), as to whether it is a State Cadre post
or district cadre post which would be required to be clarified by the competent authority in order to
obviate such similar controversy in future.
61. If the appellants could be adjusted against vacant posts of Constables (Operator), it may not be
necessary for us to decide on the legality of the judgment and order dated 28.07.2021 passed by the
Ld. Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), Jammu Bench in TA No. 62/864/2021 which has been
challenged in the writ petitions, WP (C) Nos. 1546 of 2021, l548 of 2021, l684 of 2021, 1585 of 2021
and 736 of 2023.
62. In our opinion though the view of the Ld. CAT appears to be correct, yet, had the peculiar
circumstances in which the said appointments made, were examined, the Ld. CAT could have come
to a different conclusion by not disturbing the appointment of the petitioners as Wireless Assistants.
63. The peculiar circumstances are as follows:
(i) The creation of the posts of Wireless Assistants was to accommodate the
appellants who were initially appointed as Constables (Operator) and their services
were terminated after they had already successfully completed their training and had
already rendered about 4 years of service, pursuant to the impugned judgment and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123360706/ 23
Manmohan Khajuria &Ors. vs . Sheikh Muzaffar Ahmad &Ors. on 24 November, 2023
order dated 09.05.2014 passed in SWP Nos.1352 of 2010 and batch of writ petitions.
(ii) Though these posts of Wireless Assistants were not advertised, the fact remains
that the petitioners were already tested for their suitability and were found
meritorious to be appointed at the district level as per their merit, after they had
taken part in the recruitment process pursuant to a public
notification/advertisement, in which they had competed with other candidates
including those who had challenged their appointments as Wireless Assistants.
The matter could have been otherwise, if the persons challenging their appointments as Wireless
Assistants had not taken part in the recruitment process and were fresh candidates in which event
the plea of denial of equal opportunity in seeking public employment as guaranteed under Article 16
of the Constitution would have been well founded.
(iii) Though the appointments of the appellants as Constables (Operator) were set aside by the Ld.
Single Judge, the appellants could not be faulted for the same, as it was because of error committed
by appointing authority in properly following the procedures or the terms of the advertisement.
Even these appointments of the appellants by the official respondents were not due to any mala-fide
or by engaging in fraudulent or corrupt practice and the appellants were also not involved in any
malpractice. In our opinion, the appellants were victims of irregularities committed by the
authorities for which the appellants should not made to suffer.
(iv) We have also noticed that there are ambiguities and lack of clarity as regards the service
conditions/status of the post of Constable (Operator) which could have contributed to the aforesaid
irregular appointments of the appellants.
(v) The Government had also clearly shown their inclination not to oust the appellants from services
and in fact, these posts of Wireless Assistants were specifically created to accommodate them, after
they had served for about four years as Constables (Operators) and had completed their training
involving sensitive assignments.
(vi) The appellants had been virtually in service since their initial appointment in 2010 as
Constables (Operator) till their services were terminated in 2017 vide order dated 19.01.2017 but
they obtained an interim order staying the said termination order, even though the Government did
not comply with the said stay order. However, the appellants were re-engaged as Constables
(Operator) vide order dated 10.07.2018. Though the said appointment of the appellants as Wireless
Assistants was challenged before the Ld. CAT which set aside the same vide order dated 28.07.2021,
it was stayed by this Court on 05.08.2021.
(vii) The persons who had challenged the appointment of the appellants as Wireless Assistants
themselves had also taken part in the competition along with the appellants and were not found
meritorious either at the State level or District level.

64. Even if our view, and the submission of the appellants that the services of the appellants should
not be disturbed, is based on equity, the same finds sustenance from various judicial
pronouncements.
65. In this regard, we may refer to a recent decision rendered by this Bench Court on 01.08.2023 in
LPASW No. 80/2016, titled "Narinder Singh and Ors. Vs. Vijay Kumar and Ors.", wherein this Court
had declined to interfere, based on the principle of equity, of certain appointments made though
irregularly, but continuing for a long period, and for which appointment, the candidates were not to
be blamed. In the aforesaid decision, we made the following observations.
"19. From the above, what can be said is that there are two competing claims, one
based on legal provisions and another on equity. When a claim based on law and
once the claim of the right is established, it cannot be denied to the claimant. To
achieve that end and to confer the claimant the rightful claim, it may require
depriving another of his rights which had otherwise accrued to him. On the other
hand, claim based on equity is primarily to protect the right of a person accrued to
him, based on equitable considerations, but it cannot be at the cost of such person in
whose favour a legal right has accrued. Consequently, when grating any relief based
on equity by protecting the right of such a person, the legal right accrued to the
person in accordance with law must be also protected.
20. It may also be kept in mind that merely because it is lawful to do so, the writ
court while exercising extraordinary discretionary jurisdiction, may not set aside an
order based on mere errors of law, if it does not lead to any substantial injustice, for
while protecting a person of his legal rights, the court must also advance justice and
not to thwart it. While doing so, the court has to balance the competing interests,
keeping in mind that the interests of justice and public interest coalesce generally. Of
course, a court of equity, when exercising its equitable jurisdiction must act so as to
prevent perpetration of a legal fraud and promote good faith and equity and an order
in equity is one which is equitable to all the parties concerned, as also observed by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in Ritesh Tewari v. State of U.P., (2010) 10 SCC 677, wherein
it was held that, "26. The power under Article 226 of the Constitution is discretionary
and supervisory in nature. It is not issued merely because it is lawful to do so. The
extraordinary power in the writ jurisdiction does not exist to set right mere errors of
law which do not occasion any substantial injustice. A writ can be issued only in case
of a grave miscarriage of justice or where there has been a flagrant violation of law.
The writ court has not only to protect a person from being subjected to a violation of
law but also to advance justice and not to thwart it. The Constitution does not place
any fetter on the power of the extraordinary jurisdiction but leaves it to the discretion
of the court. However, being that the power is discretionary, the court has to balance
competing interests, keeping in mind that the interests of justice and public interest
coalesce generally. A court of equity, when exercising its equitable jurisdiction must
act so as to prevent perpetration of a legal fraud and promote good faith and equity.
An order in equity is one which is equitable to all the parties concerned. The petition
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123360706/ 25
Manmohan Khajuria &Ors. vs . Sheikh Muzaffar Ahmad &Ors. on 24 November, 2023
can be entertained only after being fully satisfied about the factual statements and
not in a casual and cavalier manner........."
21. In our view, though the appointments of the appellants are certainly not in consonance with the
terms of the advertisement and the SRO 343 of 2004, yet these appointments under the
circumstances narrated above, cannot be said to be a grave and flagrant violation of law to disentitle
any equitable relief to the appellants. While coming to this conclusion, we have kept in mind the
decisions of the Supreme Court in Tejinder Kaur v. Raj Kumari, (2009) 1 SCC 177, Tridip Kumar
Dingal v.
State of W.B., (2009) 1 SCC 768 and Rajesh Kumar v. State of Bihar, (2013) 4 SCC 690 relied upon
by the appellants, where the Supreme Court, in view of the long service rendered by the persons
whose appointments were challenged and finding that there was not fault on their part, did not
disturb their appointments.
22. In the present case also, as noticed above, the appellants could not be faulted for being offered
appointment in Udhampur District. They may not be in a position to know whether there were other
eligible and suitable local candidates for appointment in Udhampur. On the other hand, it was the
authorities who were in the know of the positions obtaining about the availability of candidates
hailing from Udhampur District, and since the authorities had offered appointment to the
appellants, which they accepted, and as there was no collusion with the authorities, nor had they
played fraud or misrepresented, and as the appellants were otherwise more meritorious than the
writ petitioners, in view of the long service rendered by the appellants, they deserve to be protected.
23. The appellants also fulfilled all the requisite qualifications for being appointed as Physical
Education Teachers. They claim to be more meritorious than the writ petitioners. The only hurdle
coming in the way of their appointment and continuation in their service is that the writ petitioners
claim to be residents of Udhampur who would have a preference over other non-local candidates. It
is to be noted that if there were no eligible and suitable candidates in Udhampur, the appointments
of the appellants could not have been questioned and their appointments could not have said to be
contrary to the advertisement in as much as the advertisement does not bar candidates from other
districts in the absence of local candidates. Under the circumstances, their appointments can be said
to be more of an irregularity than being wholly and fundamentally illegal so to vitiate the
appointment.
24. In the present case while granting equitable relief to the appellants by protecting their services,
the legal right accrued in favour of the writ petitioners to get appointed as Physical Education
Teachers in Udhampur District by virtue of merit and being residents of Udhampur District in terms
of the advertisement must be also protected.
66. It would be apposite to briefly refer to the relevant observations made in the aforesaid decisions
of the Hon'ble Supreme Court as follows.
(i) Tejinder Kaur v. Raj Kumari, (2009) 1 SCC 177, wherein it was held as follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123360706/ 26
Manmohan Khajuria &Ors. vs . Sheikh Muzaffar Ahmad &Ors. on 24 November, 2023
"12. We find that the guidelines really provide for request by the candidate for
reassessing of his/her marks and there is no scope for asking for reassessment in the
case of other candidates. But in view of the earlier order of the High Court that the
question has become academic, it is to be noted that Respondents 6 to 10 in the writ
petition had completed 2½ years of training. In the meantime they had appeared in
List B, C and List D.
13. In view of the aforesaid peculiar situation we set aside that part of the order of the
High Court by which their selection was set aside. It would be inequitable to deprive
them the benefits of what had been extended to them. Deficiency, if any, in not
allotting proper marks as done by the authorities cannot deprive them of the benefit
which they have obtained. It is not shown that they were a party to the wrong
allotment of marks at the original stage. The position may have been different if that
was so. That being so, their appeal is allowed. But the appellant Raj Kumari has not
made the grade. Therefore, her appeal deserves to be dismissed, which we direct.
There is no substance in the plea that some of the appellants in the other appeal had
secured lesser marks than her. But because of the circumstances highlighted above,
we feel that the analogy cannot be extended to her. The appeals are accordingly
disposed of."
(ii) Tridip Kumar Dingal v. State of W.B., (2009) 1 SCC 768, in which it was observed as follows:
"49. In Munindra Kumar v. Rajiv Govil6 the selection comprised of written test,
group discussion and oral interview. The relevant rule fixed 40% of total marks for
group discussion and oral interview (20% each). Though this Court held fixation of
marks as arbitrary, being on higher side, it refused to set aside selection made on that
basis since selection had already been made, persons were selected, appointed and
were in service.
50. In Gujarat State Dy. Executive Engineers' Assn. v. State of Gujarat7 this Court
recorded a finding that appointments given under the "wait list" were not in
accordance with law. It, however, refused to set aside such appointments in view of
length of service (five years and more).
51. In Buddhi Nath Chaudhary v. Abahi Kumar8 appointments were held to be
improper. But this Court did not disturb the appointments on the ground that the
incumbents had worked for several years and had gained good experience. "We have
extended equitable considerations to such selected candidates who have worked on
the post for a long period", said the Court (at SCC p. 331, para 6).
52. In M.S. Mudhol (Dr.) v. S.D. Halegkar9 the petitioner sought a writ of quo
warranto and prayed for removal of a Principal of a school on the ground that he did
not possess the requisite qualification and was wrongly selected by the Selection
Committee. Keeping in view the fact, however, that the incumbent was occupying the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123360706/ 27
Manmohan Khajuria &Ors. vs . Sheikh Muzaffar Ahmad &Ors. on 24 November, 2023
office of Principal since more than ten years, this Court refused to disturb him at that
stage.
53. In our considered opinion, the law laid down by this Court in aforesaid and other
cases applies to the present situation also. We are of the considered view that it would
be inequitable if we set aside appointments of candidates selected, appointed and are
working since 1998-1999. We, therefore, hold that the Tribunal and the High Court
were right in not setting aside their appointments.
54. It is undisputed that by the time we are called upon to decide the matter, the
selected and appointed candidates have completed ten years. They are thus having
rich experience in the field. There are several vacancies. The stand of the State
Government is equally fair and reasonable. It was stated that those candidates who
had grievance against the selection and had not waived their right to get similar
treatment and had approached the Tribunal, the High Court and this Court, may be
granted similar relief. We are also of the view that such relief can be granted in favour
of the appellants who were agitated and had raised voice against the selection of
candidates before the Tribunal, before the High Court and before us.
6: (1991) 3 SCC 368 7: 1994 Supp (2) SCC 591 8: (2001) 3 SCC 328 9: (1993) 3 SCC
591
(iii) In Rajesh Kumar v. State of Bihar, (2013) 4 SCC 690 ,it was held as follows:
"20. That brings us to the submission by Mr Rao that while re- evaluation is a good
option not only to do justice to those who may have suffered on account of an
erroneous key being applied to the process but also to the writ petitioners,
Respondents 6 to 18 in the matter of allocating to them their rightful place in the
merit list. Such evaluation need not necessarily result in the ouster of the appellants
should they be found to fall below the "cut-off" mark in the merit list. Mr Rao gave
two reasons in support of that submission. Firstly, he contended that the appellants
are not responsible for the error committed by the parties in the matter of evaluation
of the answer scripts. The position may have been different if the appellants were
guilty of any fraud, misrepresentation or malpractice that would have deprived them
of any sympathy from the court or justified their ouster. Secondly, he contended that
the appellants have served the State efficiently and without any complaint for nearly
seven years now and most of them, if not all, may have become overage for fresh
recruitment within the State or outside the State. They have also lost the opportunity
to appear in the subsequent examination held in the year 2007. Their ouster from
service after their employment on the basis of a properly conducted competitive
examination not itself affected by any malpractice or other extraneous consideration
or misrepresentation will cause hardship to them and ruin their careers and lives.
The experience gained by these appellants over the years would also, according to Mr
Rao, go waste as the State will not have the advantage of using valuable human
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123360706/ 28
Manmohan Khajuria &Ors. vs . Sheikh Muzaffar Ahmad &Ors. on 24 November, 2023
resource which was found useful in the service of the people of the State of Bihar for a
long time. Mr Rao, therefore, prayed for a suitable direction that while re-evaluation
can determine the inter se position of the writ petitioners and the appellants in these
appeals, the result of such re-evaluation may not lead to their ouster from service, if
they fell below the cut-off line.
21. There is considerable merit in the submission of Mr Rao. It goes without saying
that the appellants were innocent parties who have not, in any manner, contributed
to the preparation of the erroneous key or the distorted result. There is no mention of
any fraud or malpractice against the appellants who have served the State for nearly
seven years now. In the circumstances, while inter se merit position may be relevant
for the appellants, the ouster of the latter need not be an inevitable and inexorable
consequence of such a re-evaluation. The re-evaluation process may additionally
benefit those who have lost the hope of an appointment on the basis of a wrong key
applied for evaluating the answer scripts. Such of those candidates as may be
ultimately found to be entitled to issue of appointment letters on the basis of their
merit shall benefit by such re-evaluation and shall pick up their appointments on that
basis according to their inter se position on the merit list.
(iv) In Tajvir Singh Sodhi and Ors. vs. The State of Jammu and Kashmir and Ors. AIR
2023 SC 2014, the Supreme Court again reiterated that the positions of drug
inspectors who had served for such a long time cannot be disturbed, and due
consideration should be accordance to the time they had given in the service of the
Government.
67. As mentioned above, and also recorded in our order dated 08.06.2023, as on date there are 170
vacant posts of Constables (Operator) after appointments made in terms of the impugned judgment
and order dated 09.05.2014, and the number of appellants who were earlier appointed as
Constables (Operator) on the basis of District wise merit list, whose services were terminated and
subsequently engaged as Wireless Assistants on consolidated pay are 151 in number. Hence, these
appellants can be easily adjusted against the said 170 vacant posts of Constables (Operator), thus
leaving 19 posts vacant. Consequently, upon adjustment of 151 Wireless Assistant (the appellants)
against the aforesaid 170 posts of Constables (Operator), 151 posts of Wireless Assistants will
become available.
68. We have been informed that the number of private respondents/original applicants in the batch
of applications challenging the appointment of the appellants as Wireless Assistants, which were
decided by the Ld. Administrative Tribunal petitions, who are pursuing their cause is 63. They were
also candidates who had taken part in the recruitment process conducted in terms of the
advertisement issued on 09.03.2007 but could not make it either in the merit list prepared at the
district level or state level. Though, under normal circumstances, they cannot be considered for
appointment in terms of merit and they had not served in any capacity earlier, as the appellants,
since, there are sufficient vacancies in the post of Wireless Assistants, these 63 candidates can be
considered for appointment as they had successfully pursued their claim before the Ld. CAT. We are
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123360706/ 29
Manmohan Khajuria &Ors. vs . Sheikh Muzaffar Ahmad &Ors. on 24 November, 2023
also of the view as also contended by them that since they had also taken part in the recruitment
process, their case can be considered. We, accordingly, are of the view that their cases can be
considered for engagement as Wireless Assistants against the existing vacancies of Wireless
Assistants, if they are found to be fulfilling the minimum standard required or the benchmark for
appointment and if they so given appointment, their services shall stand regularized on completion
of 10 years as per the condition stipulated at the time of creation of the 151 posts of Wireless
Assistants.
69. Accordingly, subject to our observations and findings as discussed above, we are not interfering
with the common judgment and order dated 09.05.2014 passed in SWP Nos.1352 of 2010, 1802 of
2009, 1270 of 2009, 1527 of 2009, 1478 of 2009, 1177 of 2009, 1257 of 2009, 1527 of 2009, 998 of
2013, 777 of 2013, 778 of 2013, and 211 of 2017.
We, however, allow the WP (C) Nos. 1546 of 2021, l548 of 2021, l684 of 2021, 1585 of 2021 and 736
of 2023, whereby the judgment and order dated 28.07.2021 passed by the Ld. Central
Administrative Tribunal (CAT), Jammu Bench in TA No. 62/864/2021 has been challenged, by
setting aside the same with the following directions:
(i) The appellants in LPASW No. 144 of 2017, LPA 28 of 2023, LPA 29 of 2023, LPA
30 of 2023, LPA 31 of 2023, LPA 32 of 2023, LPA 33 of 2023, LPA 34 of 2023, LPA
35 of 2023, stated to be numbering 151 (one fifty-one) and who are presently serving
as Wireless Assistants, shall forthwith be appointed as Constables (Operator) on
regular basis by adjusting against the 170 (one seventy) vacant posts of Constables
(Operator) and their appointments shall be given effect notionally from the date they
were initially appointed as Constables (Operator), without any back wages.
(ii) The services of those persons who are already appointed as Constables (Operator) after the
services of the appellants were terminated vide order dated 19.01.2017 will remain undisturbed and
will be en-bloc senior to the appellants in the LPAs as the seniority of the Constables (Operator)
should be based on the state level merit list which was prepared in terms of the direction issued by
the Ld. Single Judge in the impugned judgment and order dated 09.05.2014 in SWP No. 1352 of
2010 and other writ petitions, as this would truly reflect the comparative merit of the candidates,
irrespective of the fact that they may be appointed on different dates and in different districts.
(iii) In order to avoid any such similar future litigation, the official respondents should clarify the
status/position of the "Constable (Operator)" qua the "Constable" as provided in the J & K Police
Rules, 1960.
(iv) The private respondents in WP (C) Nos. 1546 of 2021, l548 of 2021, l684 of 2021, 1585 of 2021
and 736 of 2023, who have continued to pursue their claim till now, stated to be numbering 63
(sixty-six), shall be appointed as Wireless Assistants against the resultant 151 (one fifty-one) vacant
posts of Wireless Assistants, subject to their suitability and on attaining the benchmark in terms of
the performance in the recruitment process pursuant to the advertisement dated 09.03.2007, as
may be decided by the appointing authority, as observed above, within a period of one month from

today.
70. All petitions/applications connected to these LPAs and writ petitions, relating to appointment to
the aforesaid posts of Constables (Operator) and Wireless Assistants consequent to the
Advertisement dated 09.03.2007 also stand disposed of in terms of the above directions.
71. Registry is directed to place a copy of the of this judgment in each file for ready reference.
