I.A.NO.IX AND ALLOW THE WRIT PETITION.
THIS PETITION COMING ON FOR ORDERS THIS DAY,
THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:

WP No. 109727 of 2016
ORDER
1. The petitioners are before this Court seeking for the following reliefs:
a. Issue a writ in the nature of certiorari or any other writ or direction and quash the
order passed by the Civil Judge, Banahatti passed in O.S.No.27/2007 dated
28.11.2016 on I.A.No.IX, copy as per Annexure-E and allow I.A.No.IX and allow the
writ petition and /or, b. Pass such other order or orders as this Hon'ble Court deems
fit in the facts and circumstances of the case.
2. O.S.No.27/2007 had been filed for the relief of permanent injunction restraining the defendants
from interfering with the possession of the petitioners/plaintiffs in the suit schedule property.
Defendant No.2 had filed a written statement therein, contending that the defendant had purchased
the suit schedule property vide unregistered sale deed dated 04.05.2005 and as such, during the
course of evidence, the said unregistered sale deed was sought to be produced and marked as an
exhibit.
3. The plaintiffs filed an application under Section 34 of the Karnataka Stamps Act read with Section
151 of CPC, which came to be numbered as I.A.No.IX, contending that the said document being an
unregistered and void document, cannot be marked in evidence.
4. The trial Court considering the said objection and after hearing the parties, partly allowed the said
application impounding the unregistered sale deed dated 04.05.2005, directing the defendants to
make payment of duty and penalty on the document and thereafter permitted the defendants to
mark the said unregistered sale deed for collateral purpose. It is the said order, which is challenged
before this Court.
5. Sri. Mrutyunjaya Tata Bangi, learned counsel for the petitioners, by relying upon the decision of
the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Yellapu Uma Maheswari & another Vs. Buddha
Jagadheeswararao & Others reported in 2015 AIR SCW 6184, submits that when a document, which
is compulsorily registrable is not registered, is not admissible in evidence and therefore, the present
sale deed, which is compulsorily registrable not having been registered, could not have been marked
in evidence. He also relies upon the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Shyam
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158045321/ 3
Sri Prabhu vs Smt.Shanta on 30 March, 2022
Narayan Prasad Vs. Krishna Prasad and Others reported in AIR 2018 SC 3152 in support of the
aforesaid contention.
6. Sri. Anil Kale, learned counsel appearing for respondent No.2 submits that defendant No.2 being
willing to make payment of the stamp duty on the document being impounded, the admissibility or
otherwise of the document in evidence cannot be gone into at the time of marking the document but
would have to be considered at the appropriate stage, once the document is impounded and
defendant has paid the stamp duty and penalty the document needs to be marked, which cannot be
refused by the trial Court. In this regard, he relies upon the decision of this Court in the case of
Mahadeva Vs. The Commissioner, Mysore City Corporation and Others reported in 2003 (1)
Kar.L.J. 518 and as such he submits that the order passed by the trial Court being proper and
correct, the above petition is liable to be dismissed.
7. Heard Sri. Mrutyunjay Tata Bangi, learned counsel for the petitioner and Sri. Anil Kale, learned
counsel for respondent No.2. Perused the records.
8. The short question that would arise for consideration of this Court is:
"Whether a document though compulsorily registrable not having been registered,
can be objected to at the time of marking during the course of evidence?
9. There is no dispute as regards the document being unstamped or unregistered. In fact the claim of
defendant No.2 is that, she had purchased the property under an unregistered sale deed. The trial
Court also finding that the said sale deed was not properly stamped, by exercising powers under
Section 34 of the Karnataka Stamp Act, 1958 has impounded the same and levied penalty.
10. Sri. Anil Kale, learned counsel for respondent No.2 has submitted that respondent
No.2/defendant No.2 has no objection to make payment of penalty levied.
11. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Yellapu Uma Maheswari & another Vs. Buddha
Jagadheeswararao & Others reported in 2015 AIR SCW 6184, at paragraph 18 has held as under:
"18. Then the next question that falls for consideration is whether these can be used
for any collateral purpose. The larger Bench of Andhra Pradesh High Court in
Chinnappa Reddy Gari Muthyala Reddy Vs. Chinnappa Reddy Gari Vankat Reddy ,
AIR 1969 A.P. (242) has held that the whole process of partition contemplates three
phases i.e. severancy of status, division of joint property by metes and bounds and
nature of possession of various shares. In a suit for partition, an unregistered
document can be relied upon for collateral purpose i.e. severancy of title, nature of
possession of various shares but not for the primary purpose i.e. division of joint
properties by metes and bounds. An unstamped instrument is not admissible in
evidence even for collateral purpose, until the same is impounded. Hence, if the
appellants/defendants want to mark these documents for collateral purpose it is open
for them to pay the stamp duty together with penalty and get the document

Sri Prabhu vs Smt.Shanta on 30 March, 2022
impounded and the Trial Court is at liberty to mark Exhibits B-21 and B- 22 for
collateral purpose subject to proof and relevance."
12. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Shyam Narayan Prasad Vs. Krishna Prasad and Others
reported in AIR 2018 SC 3152 at paragraphs 22 and 23 has held as under:
"22. It is clear from the above judgment that the best evidence of the contents of the
document is the document itself and as required under Section 91 of the Evidence Act
the document itself has to be produced to prove its contents. But having regard to
Section 49 of the Registration Act, any document which is not registered as required
under law, would be inadmissible in evidence and cannot, therefore, be produced and
proved under Section 91 of the Evidence Act. Since Exhibit P2 is an unregistered
document, it is inadmissible in evidence and as such it can neither be proved under
Section 91 of the Evidence Act nor any oral evidence can be given to prove its
contents. Therefore, the High Court has rightly discarded the exchange deed at
Exhibit P2"
.
13. This Court in Mahadeva Vs. The Commissioner, Mysore City Corporation and Others reported in
2003 (1) Kar.L.J. 518 at para 9 and 10 has held as under:
"9. The proviso to Section 34 prescribes the conditions subject to which a document
which is not duly stamped can be admitted in evidence. It inter alia provides for
payment of the duty with which the same is chargeable or in the case of an
instrument insufficiently stamped, the amount which is required to make up such
duty together with the prescribed penalty. Suffice it to say that there is no conflict
between what is permitted by the proviso to Section 49 of the Registration Act on the
one hand and Section 34 of the Karnataka Stamp Act, 1957, on the other. The
demand of duty and penalty in terms of the proviso to Section 34 before the
document could be marked in token of its having been admitted in evidence did not
therefore suffer from any error of law to warrant interference. As a matter of fact,
whenever an objection regarding the admissibility of an instrument on the ground of
its being unstamped or insufficiently stamped is raised, the Court is required to
determine the objection before proceeding any further, unlike other cases where an
objection to the admissibility of a document on any other ground may be examined at
a later stage and the document tentatively marked to avoid delay in recording of the
evidence. The decisions of the Supreme Court in Ram Rattan (dead) by L.Rs v.
Bajrang Lal and Ors., , and Bipin Shantilal Panchal v. State of Gujarat and Anr., AIR
2001 SC 1158 : (2001)3 SCC 1 : 2001 Cri. L.J. 1254 (SC), and that of a Single Bench of
this Court in Riyaz Khan, and Ors. v. Modi Mohammed Ismail and Ors., 2002(3) Kar.
L.J. 551 : ILR 2002 Kar. 3369, clearly settle the legal position in this regard.

Sri Prabhu vs Smt.Shanta on 30 March, 2022
10. The only other question that was argued by Mr. Shetty was whether the amount of
duty and penalty on the sale deed relied upon by him could be determined by the
Court itself or a reference to the Registrar of Stamps was necessary. There is no
provision in the Karnataka Stamp Act, 1957, nor has Mr. Shetty brought any to my
notice which would envisage a reference to the Registrar of Stamps for determining
the duty payable on any instrument. The scheme of Section 34 of the Karnataka
Stamp Act, 1957, also does not envisage any such reference being made before the
document could be marked. The amount of duty payable on the sale deed (in the
absence of any material to show that the property had been undervalued) is relatable
to the consideration that was paid and received by the parties to the transaction. The
penalty amount leviable on the instrument also didn't require or call for any enquiry
which could possibly call for a reference to the Registrar. The Court below was
therefore justified in holding that the duty payable on the instrument as also the
penalty had to be calculated by the Court and not by the Registrar as argued by the
plaintiff."
14. A perusal of the above paragraphs in the aforesaid decisions would clearly indicate that, if an
unregistered document is brought up for marking during the course of evidence, in the event of the
said document not being stamped adequately, or the stamping being improper, the said Court can
impound the document and levy penalty. It is only after the penalty is paid upon the impoundment,
that the Apex Court as also this Court have held that, the document can be marked in
- 10 -
evidence. However, the admissibility thereof is to be decided subsequently.
15. In view of the above, the point framed for determination in this case is no longer res integra. The
Hon'ble Apex Court has clearly laid down the law relating to the same. Hence I answer the point
raised by holding that, even if a document is not registered, the said document can be marked in
evidence, admissibility being left upon for consideration at appropriate stage.
16. In the present facts, applying the above, I am of the considered opinion that the order passed by
the trial Court does not suffer from any legal infirmity.
17. With the above observations, the writ petition stands dismissed, leaving open the aspect of
admissibility of the unregistered sale deed dated 04.05.2005. In view of disposal of the main
petition, all pending I.As. stands disposed of.
