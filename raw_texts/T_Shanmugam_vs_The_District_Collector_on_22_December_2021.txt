ORDER
This writ petition has been filed challenging the acquisition proceedings in ROC.1029/1973 and
Award in 7/74 dated 16.08.1974 on the ground that the possession has not been taken over and the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis compensation has not been paid as contemplated under Section
24(2) of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and
Resettlement Act, 2013.
2. Heard Mr.M.Guruprasad, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners, Mr.G.Ameedius, learned
Government Advocate appearing for the respondents 1 to 4 and Mr.C.Prakasam, learned counsel
appearing for the fifth respondent.
3. One N.K.Palanisamy, made a representation to the officials alleging that the petitioners have
encroached the land belong to the Government which is classified as lake stream comprised in
Survey No.77/1, situated at Kumarapalayam Village, Molasi Firka, Tiruchengode Taluk, Namakkal
District. Since, the respondents did not take any action on his representation, he approached this
Court in W.P.No.30058 of 2018. The Hon'ble First Bench of this Court, recorded the submissions of
the learned Government Pleader that the notice under Section 7 of the Tamil Nadu Land
Encroachment Act, 1905 was issued to the encroachers and followed by Section 6 notice of the Tamil
Nadu Land https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Encroachment Act, 1905 was issued. Aggrieved by the
same, the petitioners herein have filed statutory appeal before the first respondent on Section 10 of
the Tamil Nadu Land Encroachment Act, 1905 and it was rejected by an order dated 12.10.2018 for
the reason that they have encroached the land comprised in Survey No.77/1 to an extent of 1.76.0
hectares. Recorded the said submissions, the said writ petition was disposed of on 06.02.2019.

4. However, the said N.K.Palanisamy also filed a contempt petition before this Court and the same
was closed by an order dated 18.03.2021 and had also taken note of the pendency of the present writ
petition. The first respondent mechanically concluded by the proceedings dated 12.10.2018, that the
subject land is classified as "lake" (water body) in the revenue records. These lands have been
encroached by the petitioners. In fact, they were given an opportunity of hearing and passed a
detailed order.
5. Further revealed that prior to UDR survey, the subject land was classified as "Ryotwari punja"
lands along with Survey No.77/1, 2, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ad-measuring 6.32 cents of
lands. Before UDR survey, the patta in respect of the above land was issued in Patta No.11 in the
name of V.Thanda Gounder i.e. the father of the first petitioner and 5 others as per the proceedings,
dated 15.02.1975 in TK/8A/57/84. After UDR survey, the subject land was classified as 'Eri' (lake).
6. A perusal of the revenue records, the first respondent has specifically referred to the acquisition
proceedings initiated in Na.Ka.No.1029 of 1973, dated 16.08.1974. The acquisition proceedings were
initiated at the instance of the Public Works Department as the requisitioning body, who had sought
for acquisition of the subject land to maintain the subject land as a water body for water storage.
Therefore, the land comprised in Survey No.77/1, ad-measuring 4.34 cents was acquired and
handed over to the Public Works Department. Originally, the land stood in the name of Sellappan
Gounder and father of the petitioner i.e. Thanda Gounder. After acquisition of the said land, the
entire compensation amount of Rs.8,150.80/- was deposited on 16.08.1974, before the Principal
Subordinate Judge, Salem in L.A.O.P. No.289 of 1974 as per the proceedings of the Special
Tahsildar and Land https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Acquisition Officer, Salem in Na.Ka.No.1029
of 1973. In fact, the possession of the said property was handed over by the father of the first
petitioner and Lakshmana Gounder and it is evident from the certificate dated 16.08.1974.
7. Thereafter, the revenue records were mutated in the name of water body. In fact, after demise of
the said Thanda Gounder, the petitioner seems to have encroached the subject property. When the
said N.K.Palanisamy, filed a writ petition before this Court to remove the encroachment made by the
petitioners in Survey No.77/1, the respondents had taken steps to remove the encroachments made
by the petitioners under the Tamil Nadu Land Encroachment Act, 1905.
8. Therefore, the present writ petition is nothing but tactic of escape from the clutches of law under
the Tamil Nadu Land Encroachment Act, 1905. The petitioners failed to fulfill the twin conditions as
contemplated under Section 24(2) of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land
Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013.

9. In this regard it is relevant to extract the judgment reported in (2020) 8 SCC 129 in the case of
Indore Development Authority Vs. Manoharlal and ors etc., held that, “366. In view of the aforesaid
discussion, we answer the questions as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/112365681/ 3
T.Shanmugam vs The District Collector on 22 December, 2021
1. Under the provisions of Section 24(1)(a) in case the award is not made as on
1.1.2014 the date of commencement of Act of 2013, there is no lapse of proceedings.
Compensation has to be determined under the provisions of Act of 2013.
2. In case the award has been passed within the window period of five years excluding
the period covered by an interim order of the court, then proceedings shall continue
as provided under Section 24(1)(b) of the Act of 2013 under the Act of 1894 as if it
has not been repealed.
3. The word or used in Section 24(2) between possession and compensation has to be
read as nor or as and. The deemed lapse of land acquisition proceedings under
Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 takes place where due to inaction
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis of authorities for five years or more prior to
commencement of the said Act, the possession of land has not been taken nor
compensation has been paid. In other words, in case possession has been taken,
compensation has not been paid then there is no lapse. Similarly, if compensation
has been paid, possession has not been taken then there is no lapse.
4. The expression 'paid' in the main part of Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 does not
include a deposit of compensation in court. The consequence of non-deposit is
provided in proviso to Section 24(2) in case it has not been deposited with respect to
majority of land holdings then all beneficiaries (landowners) as on the date of
notification for land acquisition under Section 4 of the Act of 1894 shall be entitled to
compensation in accordance with the provisions of the Act of 2013. In case the
obligation under Section 31 of the Land Acquisition Act of 1894 has not been fulfilled,
interest under Section 34 of the said Act can be granted. Non-deposit of
compensation (in court) does not result in the lapse of land acquisition
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis proceedings. In case of non-deposit with respect to
the majority of holdings for five years or more, compensation under the Act of 2013
has to be paid to the "landowners" as on the date of notification for land acquisition
under Section 4 of the Act of 1894.
5. In case a person has been tendered the compensation as provided under Section
31(1) of the Act of 1894, it is not open to him to claim that acquisition has lapsed
under Section 24(2) due to non-payment or non-deposit of compensation in court.
The obligation to pay is complete by tendering the amount under Section 31(1). Land
owners who had refused to accept compensation or who sought reference for higher
compensation, cannot claim that the acquisition proceedings had lapsed under
Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013.
6. The proviso to Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 is to be treated as part of Section
24(2) not part of Section 24(1)(b).

T.Shanmugam vs The District Collector on 22 December, 2021
7. The mode of taking possession under the Act of 1894 and as contemplated under
Section 24(2) is by drawing of inquest report/ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
memorandum. Once award has been passed on taking possession under Section 16 of
the Act of 1894, the land vests in State there is no divesting provided under Section
24(2) of the Act of 2013, as once possession has been taken there is no lapse under
Section 24(2).
8. The provisions of Section 24(2) providing for a deemed lapse of proceedings are
applicable in case authorities have failed due to their inaction to take possession and
pay compensation for five years or more before the Act of 2013 came into force, in a
proceeding for land acquisition pending with concerned authority as on 1.1.2014. The
period of subsistence of interim orders passed by court has to be excluded in the
computation of five years.
9. Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 does not give rise to new cause of action to
question the legality of concluded proceedings of land acquisition. Section 24 applies
to a proceeding pending on the date of enforcement of the Act of 2013, i.e., 1.1.2014.
It does not revive stale and time-barred claims and does not reopen concluded
proceedings nor allow landowners to https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis question the
legality of mode of taking possession to reopen proceedings or mode of deposit of
compensation in the treasury instead of court to invalidate acquisition.”
10. In view of the above, the writ petition is devoid of merits and is liable to be
dismissed. Accordingly, this writ petition stands dismissed.
Consequently, connected Miscellaneous petitions are closed. There shall be no order as to costs.
