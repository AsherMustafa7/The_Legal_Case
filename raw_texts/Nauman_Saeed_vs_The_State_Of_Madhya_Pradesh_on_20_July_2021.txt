Shri Jitendra Shrivastav, Panel Lawyer for the respondent/State.
This is first bail application under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. for grant of regular bail filed on behalf
of the applicant who is in custody since 13.05.2021 in connection with Crime No. 122/2021
registered at Police Station Crime Branch, District Bhopal (MP) for offence punishable under
Sections 269, 270 of the Indian Penal Code, Section 53/57 of the Disaster Management Act, Section
3 of the Epidemic Diseases Act, Sections 3/7 of the Essential Commodities Act and Section 5/13 of
the MP Drugs Control Act.
As per the case of the prosecution, three remdesivir injections were seized from the applicant and
other co-accused persons worth Rs. 8,000/- each. It is alleged that they were involved in
black-marketting of the remdesivir injection.
Learned counsel for the applicant submits that the applicant has been falsely implicated in the case.
He further submits that in similar circumstances, the Coordinate Bench of this Court has granted
bail to the accused facing same allegations, as are being faced by the present applicant. Therefore,
applicants may also be granted bail.
On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent-State has opposed the bail application and
submitted that considering the offence and the conduct of the applicant, if he is released on bail then
an adverse message would go to the society because he was involved in blackmarketing of
remdesivir injection, which was not available for sale in the open market. Therefore, in such
circumstances, the bail application be rejected.
Learned Panel Lawyer for the State has strongly opposed the bail 2 MCRC-31484-2021 application.
Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, without commenting upon the merits of the
case, this application is allowed. It is directed that applicant-Nauman Saeed be released on bail on
