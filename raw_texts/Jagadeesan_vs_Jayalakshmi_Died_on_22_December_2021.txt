JUDGMENT
A.The Appeal :
This Appeal Suit is filed aggrieved by the Judgment and Decree dated 13.07.2011
delivered by the Additional District Judge, (Fast Track Court) Vellore, in O.S.No.26
of 2016, in and by which, a preliminary decree was passed for the division of the suit
property into 20 equal shares and allotment and delivery of possession of 6/20
shares to the plaintiffs and the plaintiffs being permitted to file separate proceedings
for the rendition of accounts for the income derived from the suit properties for the
three preceding years from the date of filing of the suit under Order XX Rule 18 of the
Code of Civil Procedure, and also granting the permanent
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ____________ injunction restraining the
defendants from in any manner alienation of the suit property till partition.
B.The plaint :
2. The case of the plaintiffs is that they are the legal heirs of one Govindasamy. The
said Govindasamy and the first defendant/Jagadeesan are the sons of one
Narayanasamy, through his first wife, namely, Dhanabakiyam. The second
defendant/Unnamalaiammal, is the second wife of Narayanasamy, through the said
second wife, a daughter, namely, Gaja/ the third defendant, and a son, namely,
Dhanapal/the fourth defendant were born. The suit properties were the ancestral
properties of the said Narayanasamy and upon his death devolved upon the plaintiffs
and the defendants. A family arrangement was also attempted, but, the parties
wriggled out of the same. Therefore, the said Govindasamy filed a suit for a partition
and separate possession in O.S.No.395 of 1998, which was later transferred and
re-numbered as O.S.No.153 of 1996. However, the said suit was dismissed for default
for non-appearance. While so, the defendants started acting as per their proclaimed
family arrangement and further documents have been attempted to be created.
Hence, the suit.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ____________ C.The Written Statements:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/147880744/ 2
Jagadeesan vs Jayalakshmi (Died) on 22 December, 2021
3. The first defendant filed a written statement stating that, as per the family
arrangement dated 09.03.1987, the suit properties have already been divided into
metes and bounds. The plaintiffs cannot seek an alternative or fresh partition. The
first defendant denied that there was no such item as mentioned under item No.7 in
the suit schedule. As a matter of fact, in the family arrangement dated 09.03.1987, in
the property described in Schedule 'B' thereto, the half share was allotted to the sister
of the said Narayanasamy, and they have also filed a suit for partition of their share,
in which a compromise was effected and the said sisters are not added as parties in
the instant suit. As far as the properties in the possession of the first defendant are
concerned, he has been enjoying the same for more than 30 years in his own interest
and therefore, he has perfected his title. The said Manickammal and Govindammal,
the sisters of the Narayanasamy were allotted the properties and they have also sold
their properties to third parties. The first plaintiff's husband Govindasamy also filed a
suit in O.S.No.153 of 1996, which was dismissed, and therefore, the present suit filed
by the plaintiffs is hit by Order II Rule 2 and Order IX Rule 9 of Code of Civil
Procedure. It is also contended that the suit is barred by limitation and prayed for
dismissal of the suit.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ____________ 3.1 Another written statement was filed on
behalf of the third defendant, which was adopted by defendants 2 and 4, as per the same, the
properties are self-acquired properties of the defendant's father Narayanasamy. There is no
partition between the first plaintiff's husband and the said Govindasamy and the first and fourth
defendants. As per the Hindu Succession Act, the third defendant is also entitled for 1/5th share and
the plaintiffs are also entitled for 1/5th share. The first defendant is not having any right to
encumber or alienate the suit property and the alienation mentioned in the plaint will not bind the
defendants.
3.2 The sixth defendant contested the suit by filing a separate written statement. As per the sixth
defendant, the properties are already partitioned and 'A' Schedule property was allotted to the share
of the said Govindasamy and Koorchit is binding on the plaintiffs and already the suit filed by the
said Govindasamy is dismissed. The sixth defendant is the bona-fide purchaser and therefore,
prayed for dismissal of the suit. D. The Issues :
4. On the strength of the above said pleadings, issues were framed on 17.10.2006, and additional
issues were framed on 24.07.2009, and https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ____________
24.11.2010, however, they were finally re-casted on 21.06.2011, which were as follows:-
“1.Whether the suit properties are the joint family properties and whether the
plaintiffs are entitled to claim partition ?
2. Whether there was an attempt for a family arrangement of the joint family
properties in the year 1987 as contended by the plaintiffs?
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/147880744/ 3
Jagadeesan vs Jayalakshmi (Died) on 22 December, 2021
3. Whether there was partition of both landed and house properties on 11.03.1987 as
contended by the 1st defendant?
4. Whether it is true that the 1st defendant was allotted 1 acre 45 cents as claimed by
him?
5. Whether there was a suit O.S.No.274 of 1947 as contended by the 1st defendant
and whether it is true that 1 acre 45 cents was given to Manickammal and
Pachaiammal?
6. Whether the sisters Manickammal and Pachaiammal of the Late. Narayanasamy,
father of Late Govindasamy and 1st defendant had any right in the suit properties
belonging to Narayanasamy?
7. Whether the suit proceedings in O.S.No.274 /1947, the alleged sale deeds dated
16.11.1964 and 07.12.1965 are fraudulent and created in collusion as contended by the
plaintiffs?
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ____________
8.Whether the previous proceedings in O.S.No.153 /1996 is hit by the principle of res judicate and
Order II Rule 2 of C.P.C, and barred by Order IX Rule 9 of C.P.C, as contended by the first
defendant?
9. Whether the suit is barred by Limitation and the 1st defendant has perfected title by adverse
possession?
10. To what relief the plaintiffs are entitled? ” E.The Evidence :
5. On the said issues the parties let in evidence, the fifth plaintiff was examined as
P.W.1 and One Sathasivam was examined as P.W.2, and on behalf of the plaintiffs,
Exs.A-1 to A-15 were marked. The first defendant was examined as D.W.1 and on
behalf of the defendants, Exs.B-1 to B-4 were marked.
F.The findings of the Trial Court :
6. Thereafter, by a Judgment dated 13.07.2011, the Trial Court proceeded to consider
the case of the parties and found that the defendants have not produced the
compromise decree or Judgment in the said suit and therefore, the sale under Ex.B-1
& B-2 were sham and nominal and will not be binding on the plaintiffs. The Trial
Court further found that the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ____________
plaintiffs have proved the properties as joint family properties and even though the
family arrangement was attempted and it was an unregistered document, no
partition can be effected by the same. Therefore, the Trial Court held that the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/147880744/ 4
Jagadeesan vs Jayalakshmi (Died) on 22 December, 2021
plaintiffs would be entitled for their share and separate possession thereof. The Trial
Court also rejected the contentions in that view of the dismissal of the earlier suit,
and therefore, the present suit is hit by Res judicata. Therefore, it finally held that the
suit properties have to be partitioned into 20 equal shares and the plaintiffs are
together entitled for 6/20 shares and the first and the fourth defendant each are
entitled to 6/20 shares and the second and the third defendant are entitled to 1/20
share in the suit properties and answered the issues accordingly. Aggrieved by the
preliminary decree passed, the first defendant has filed the present Appeal Suit.
G.The Submissions :
7. Heard Ms.R.T.Sundari, learned Counsel for the Appellant and Mr.T.R.Rajaraman,
learned Counsel appearing for the Respondents Nos.2 to 7, and Ms.P.Shanthi,
learned Counsel appearing for the Respondent No.13.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ____________ 7.1 Ms.R.T.Sundari, learned Counsel for the
Appellants would submit that the family arrangement has been duly marked and the same is signed
by the parties. Pursuant thereto all the brothers have been enjoying their shares. Therefore, the Trial
Court ought not to have granted the decree for partition once again. The learned Counsel also
submitted that the defendants have marked copies of the registered sale deed executed by
Manickammal and Pachaiyammal in favour of the third parties and unless the said
sisters/subsequent purchasers are impleaded, the suit is bad for non-joinder of necessary parties.
She would contend that the Trial Court has held that the sale is a sham and nominal in the absence
of the said parties. She would submit that when the deceased/Govindasamy has filed the earlier suit
and when the same was dismissed for default, by virtue of Order IX Rule 9 once again a fresh suit in
respect of the same relief will not lie. Therefore, she prayed that the suit be dismissed.
7.2 Per contra, Mr.T.R.Rajaraman, the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents
would submit that, the plea that the suit is barred by Res judicata and is not maintainable as the
earlier suit was dismissed for default. In a suit for partition, unless the properties were divided, the
plaintiff cannot be non-suited on hyper-technical pleas. He would submit
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ____________ that after the death of Govindasamy, they have
independent rights as the legal heirs of the said Govindasamy, and therefore, they cannot be
precluded from filing the present suit. The learned counsel would submit that, in actuality, no
partition by metes and bounds had taken place pursuant to the earlier attempted family
arrangement and the same cannot bind the parties. As a matter of fact, certain properties were also
not included in the said family arrangements. The learned Counsel would submit that the Trial
Court has correctly appreciated the issues and granted the decree. In support of his contentions, the
learned Counsel also relied upon the Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, in
R.M.Sundaram @ Meenakshisundaram Vs. Sri Kayarohanasamy and Neelaydhakshi Amman
Temple (Through its Executive Officer) Nagapattinam, Tamil Nadu1, more specifically relying on
Paragraph Nos.29 to 38, to contend that in the instant case, the principles of Res Judicata, as well as
Order II Rule 2 of CPC., will not apply. The learned Counsel also relied upon the Judgment of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, in M.Venkatramana Hebbar (Dead) by Lrs., Vs. M.Rajagopal

____________ reject the case of the plaintiff.
G. Points for consideration :
8. Upon considering the submissions made on behalf of both sides and perusal of the material
records, the following questions arise for consideration in the instant case :-
“(i) Whether the suit is liable to be dismissed on the basis of Ex.B-1, partition deed,
dated 09.03.1987?
ii) Whether the suit is filed by the plaintiff is liable to be dismissed as barred under
Order IX Rule 9 and Order II Rule 2 and Section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure?
iii) What is the nature of the suit properties and what shares the parties are entitled
to ?
iv) Whether the suit is liable to be dismissed for non-
joinder of necessary parties, namely, Manickammal and Pachaiyammal or their legal heirs or the
purchasers under Ex.B-1 & B-2?
v) To what relief the parties are entitled to?” https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ____________ H.
Point No. (i) 8.1 As far as Ex.B-1, partition deed dated 09.03.1987 is concerned it is an unregistered
document. An unregistered Koorchit/family arrangement can be accepted as a valid document, if
only it records an oral partition effected between the parties. But, in this case, the relevant portion of
Ex.B-1, which reads as under:-

Thus, it can be seen that that document actually effects partition and therefore it is compulsorily
registrable as per Section 17 of the Registration Act, and cannot be looked into by the Court.
Therefore, on the basis of Ex.B-1/ family arrangement, the relief of partition cannot be rejected and
accordingly the point is answered. I. Point No. (ii) :
8.2 It is true that the first plaintiff's husband Govindasamy had earlier filed a suit in
O.S.No.153 of 1996 for partition. But, it is seen that the same was dismissed for
non-appearance of the plaintiff in the suit.
Therefore the principles of Res Judicata would not apply as the issues were not determined on
merits. Similarly, the principles of Order II Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure will not apply, as
this is not a case for claiming different relief on the same cause of action. As far as the contention
regarding the Order IX Rule 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure, though in the ordinary course, the
dismissal of the suit filed by the first plaintiff's husband and father of the plaintiffs 2 to 6 would bind
on the plaintiffs and they will be barred in bringing the fresh suit for the same relief, this is a case of
partition. In the present suit, defendants 2 to 4 have https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
____________ also pleaded for partition. This Court in Balamani Vs. S. Balasundaram3, had held
that the cause of action in a suit for partition being a continuing one and all the plaintiffs being
defendants and defendants being the plaintiffs, the suit cannot be dismissed under Order IX Rule 9
of C.P.C. The properties remain to be partitioned. As such, the plaintiffs cannot be non-suited for
the dismissal of the earlier suit. Accordingly the point is answered.
J. Point No. iii :
8.3 It can be seen that suit properties are purchased by the said Narayanasamy, vide
Ex.A-10 and A-14. The plaintiffs are the parties alleging that the suit properties are
joint family properties. They have not let in any evidence that there were any
ancestral or joint family properties or joint family nucleus from which the suit
properties could have been purchased. The Trial Court without any discussion simply
accepted the case of the plaintiff and the first defendant as if the suit properties are
ancestral properties, while it is the contention of the third defendant that the suit
properties are the ancestral properties. It is too well settled that it is for the party who
alleges that the properties are ancestral in nature to 2009 82 AIC 329 Mad
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ____________ prove the same. Useful reference
in this regard can be had to the Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in
D.S. Lakshmiah Vs. Balasubramanyam4. The suit properties can be termed as
ancestral properties if only the said Govindsamy, the first defendant and the other
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/147880744/ 7
Jagadeesan vs Jayalakshmi (Died) on 22 December, 2021
children had a right by their birth. Useful reference in this regard can be made to the
Judgment of this Court in D.T. Rajkapoor Sah @ Ragul Sah & others Vs. Kamakshi
Bai & others (A.S. No. 429 of 2016 – Judgment dated 30.11.2022).
8.4 The plaintiff's themselves have produced Ex.A-10 and A-14 from which it is clear
that the entire suit properties are purchased by Narayanasamy as two undivided half
shares. Thus, I hold that the suit properties are the self-acquired properties of
Narayanasamy.
8.5 The said Narayanasamy is said to have died 3 months after Ex-
B1, that is in the year 1987. It is seen from the reading of the evidence that he was first married to
one Dhanabaggiam and after her death, he married Unaamalai Ammal. He had two sons
Govindsamy and Jagadeesan through the first wife. He had one daughter Gaja and one Son
Dhanapal (2003) 10 SCC 310 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ____________ through the
second wife. Admittedly he died intestate. Therefore, his wife and plaintiffs are jointly entitled for
1/5 share in the suit properties. The defendant 1 to 4 are also entitled for 1/5 share each in the suit
properties. Accordingly, the point is answered.
K. Point No. (iv):
8.6 It is the case of the first defendant that ½ share of the suit properties was allotted
to the share of the sisters of Narayanasamy and they have also dealt with the sold the
properties to third parties vide Ex.
B2 & B3 sale deeds and therefore the entire suit should be dismissed for non-joinder of necessary
parties. It is for the first defendant to prove the same. First, it can be seen that the properties are the
self-acquired properties of Narayanasamy. Second, it is pleaded that they filed a suit for partition in
O.S.No.274 of 1947 in which a compromise is said to have been recorded by which they were granted
the properties. A copy of the same was not produced before the court. The only proof produced were
Ex.B-2 & B-3 sale deeds. A reading of the Ex.B-2, it is clear that the first sister Manickammal is
claiming 0.67 cents in S.No.356/4 with 1/6th right of irrigation in the well and land in S.No.356/8.
Similarly, in Ex.B-3, the second sister Pachaiyammal is claiming 0.67 cents in S.No.356/6 with
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ____________ th 1/6 right of irrigation in the well and land in
S.No.356/8. Unless the said vendors or the persons claiming through her or the purchasers are
parties to the suit, the question, whether there was any right, whether the sale is valid or not, cannot
be decided in the present suit. Therefore, the Trial Court is not right in holding the sale by the sisters
as a sham and nominal in the absence of the said vendors or purchasers as parties to the suit. When
Ex-B2 & B-3, registered sale deeds of the years 1964 and 1965 are produced, in the absence of the
concerned Vendor or Purchaser, it cannot be brushed aside as 'sham and nominal'. If really it is so,
then the plaintiffs ought to have impleaded them and when the involvement of third-party rights is
apparent from the evidence on record, then, in their absence, a decree for partition cannot be
passed. Whether it is true or sham and nominal cannot be decided without them being parties to the
suit. However, except to hold that the plaintiffs will not be entitled for partition to the said extent, it
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/147880744/ 8
Jagadeesan vs Jayalakshmi (Died) on 22 December, 2021
cannot be said that the suit itself is to be dismissed for non-joinder of the necessary parties.
Therefore, to the said extent the Judgment of the Trial Court needs modification and the point is
answered accordingly.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ____________ L. Point No.(iv):
8.7 Thus, the suit is liable to be dismissed in respect of 0.67 cents in item No.3 of the
suit schedule property in S.No.356/4 and in respect of 0.67 cents in respect of item
No.4 of the suit schedule property in S.No.356/6 and in respect of 2/6th share in
item No.6 of the suit property in S.No.356/8. In respect of the rest of the properties,
the plaintiff's jointly will be entitled to 1/5th share. Similarly the defendants 1 to 4
will be entitled to 1/5th each. Accordingly, this question is answered.
9. In view of my above findings, the finding of the Trial Court regarding the issue
No.1 that the suit properties are joint family properties is reversed and it is held that
suit properties are self-acquired properties of Narayanasamy. That there was only an
attempt of family arrangement and it did not fructify in respect of the issue No.2 is
confirmed for the reasons of Ex.B-1, is not a registered document. The further
findings of the Trial Court in respect of issue No.3 & 4, that the properties were not
partitioned and allotted to the first defendant are confirmed. As far as the issue No.5
& 7 are concerned, when the concerned parties are not impleaded it cannot be
decided that the sales in Ex.B-2 and B-3 are sham and nominal and to that extent,
those properties are excluded from partition. As far as the issue
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ____________ No.8 is concerned, the finding of
the Trial Court, the present suit is not barred under Order II Rule 2 or Order IX Rule
9 or Res judicata is confirmed. The finding of the Trial Court that the suit is not
barred by limitation and the defendants had not perfected by adverse possession in
respect of issue No.9 is confirmed. As far as the issue No.10 is concerned, the relief
granted by the Trial Court is modified as stated supra.
M. The Result :
10. In the result, the Appeal Suit in A.S.No.4 of 2012 is partly allowed :
