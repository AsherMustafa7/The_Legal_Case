2019 clearly held that the applicant/present Petitioner is entitled to Grade Pay of Rs.6600/- towards
3rd financial upgradation with effect from 01.01.2013 and accordingly a direction was given to fix
the pay of the Petitioner and pay the accrued arrear to him within three months from the date of
receipt of a copy of the said Order, the impugned Order dated 28.02.2020 passed by the Authority is
contrary to the direction given by the Tribunal. He further submits that though in terms of the Order
passed by the Tribunal, Office Order dated 21.08.2014, vide which the Petitioner was allowed Grade
Pay of Rs.5400/- on 3rd financial upgradation, was modified and his client was allowed Grade Pay

all of them were allowed Grade Pay of Rs.6600/- in PB-3 towards 3rd upgradation under RACP

pay attached to the post of Executive Engineer which is the 3rd promotional post of
Junior Engineer as on 1.1.2013 counting the period of 30 years from the date of

this Court.

O.A. No.517 of 2019, the Petitioner initiated a contempt proceeding before the Odisha
