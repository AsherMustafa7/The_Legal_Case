ND&PS Act, 1985 in the facts and circumstances of the present Bail Application."
[3] On 18th March, 2023 at around 03:30 pm while en-route to Imphal, the petitioner's Truck was
stopped at Khongsang Village, Nungba, Tamenglong by the officials of Directorate of Revenue
Intelligence, Imphal. Thereafter, the petitioner along with his Truck was directed/ instructed to

Accordingly, the petitioner was arrested and placed under custody on 18.03.2023 in connection with
case No. 01/LD/NDPS/HEROIN/DRI/IMP/2022-23 dated 18.03.2023 U/s 21(c), 23(c), 25, 29 & 60
of the ND&PS Act, 1985.
Bail Application No. 29 of 2023 Page 2
[4] Subsequent to the arrest, the petitioner was produced
before the Court of the Duty Magistrate/ Chief Judicial Magistrate, Tamenglong in Cril. Misc. Case
No 9 of 2023. Accordingly, the Court of Duty Magistrate/ CJM, Tamenglong passed an order dated
19.03.2023 remanding the petitioner to judicial custody for 14(fourteen) days with direction to
produce the petitioner before the Hon'ble Special Judge, (ND&PS), Tamenglong on 01.04.2023.
Since, then the petitioner has been languishing in jail till date.
[5] As the petitioner was languishing in jail for more than 180 days prior to filing of the Charge
Sheet, the petitioner moved the Court of Special Judge, ND&PS, Tamenglong, Manipur for releasing
the petitioner on bail by way of Cril. Misc. (B) Case No. 5 of 2023. After hearing both the parties and
upon perusal of the materials placed on record, the Court of Special Judge, (ND&PS), Tamenglong,
Manipur passed an order dated 14.09.2023 in Cril. Misc. (B) Case No. 5 of 2023 releasing the
petitioner on bail by furnishing PR bond of Rs. 1,00,000/- (Rupees one lakh) only and 2(two) local
sureties of the like amount to the satisfaction of the Court. However, the petitioner was unable to
furnish the PR bond immediately and took some time.
[6] Meanwhile on 27.09.2023, the petitioner made a request to furnish the said PR bond before the
Court of Special Judge, ND & PS, Tamenglong but the same was refused and remanded into further
custody of 15(fifteen) days with no specific ground for refusing the said PR bond furnished by the
petitioner.
[7] On 11.10.2023, the Special Judge (ND & PS), Tamenglong passed an order in Special Trial (ND &
PS) Case No. 5 of 2023 thereby cancelling the order dated 14.09.2023 passed in Cril. Misc (B) Case
No. 05 of 2023 wherein the petitioner was Bail Application No. 29 of 2023 Page 3 released on bail
on the ground that charge sheet has already been filed.
[8] During the course of hearing the learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the Special
Judge (ND&PS), Tamenglong, Manipur failed to appreciate the fact that the petitioner was already
granted bail prior to filing of the Charge sheet on 14.09.2023 and that the charge sheet was filed
only on 27.09.203. The only reason that the petitioner was still in custody at the time of filing the
charge sheet was for the reason that the petitioner was not able to furnish the PR of Rs. 1,00,000/-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144324476/ 2
Ainul Haque Talukdar vs The Directorate Of Revenue ... on 10 May, 2024
and 2 local sureties of like amount. That on 27.09.2023 when the petitioner was ready to furnish the
said conditions, the Court of Special Judge (ND&PS), Tamenglong refused to entertain the same on
the ground that the charge sheet has been filed by the Special PP for DRI, only on the ground that
charge sheet has been filed, the right to be released on bail was curtailed thereby remanding the
petitioner into further custody. Since then the petitioner has been languishing in jail till date with no
hope for freedom even though Bail has already been granted by the Court.
[9] In support of his case, the learned counsel for the petitioner mentioned "Bail Application No. 8
of 2019" where the petitioners was released on bail by the Hon'ble High Court of Manipur in which
the petitioners were languishing in jail for more than 400 days.
[10] The learned counsel for the respondent has filed their objection stating that the petitioner
himself admitted in his voluntary statement dated 18.03.2023 that he has successfully smuggled &
delivered contraband drugs in earlier one occasion and the instant case is his second attempt. The
officer of DRI, Imphal Regional Unit arrested the petitioner along with his vehicle Tata truck u/s 42
& 43 of the NDPS Act, 1985 on the reasonable believe that he has Bail Application No. 29 of 2023
Page 4 committed an offence punishable u/s 22, 23 & 25 of the NDPS Act and filed a case.
[11] The officer of DRI, Imphal Regional Unit sent the sample of the seized 1989.98 grams of Heroin
Powder to Director of Forensic Science, Pangei, Manipur for testing and got testing report issued
vide Memo No. 31/10/88-DFS (CHEM) dated 21.06.2023 mentioned that the seized substance gave
positive response to the test of Heroin.
[12] The learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the respondent has already file a final
complaint to the Hon'ble Court of the Special Judge, ND&PS, Tamenglong, Manipur vide Special
Trial (NDPS) Case No. 5 of 2023. The I.O. has completed the investigation and filed a charge sheet
on 21.09.2023 clearly establishing his role and complicity in the inter-state drug smuggling
syndicate. The Hon'ble Court of Special Judge (ND&PS), Tamenglong has taken cognizance of the
offence and also noted that the materials on records enclosed therein with the charge sheet, exist
sufficient materials for prosecuting the accused and thus, the bail granted earlier vide order dated
14.09.2023 was cancelled on 27.09.2023 considering the facts stated above.
[13] According to the learned counsel for the respondent, if the investigation reveals that the
accused has committed a serious offence and charge sheet is filed, the bail granted under proviso (a)
to section 167(2) of Cr.P.C. could be cancelled on an application by the prosecuting agency. Section
437(5) provide for the cancellation of bail by a Court other than a High Court or a Session Court.
Meaning thereby it confers power of cancellation on the magistrate court. As per section 37 of the
NDPS Act, the court can grant bail to the accused only if it is satisfy that there are reasonable
grounds for Bail Application No. 29 of 2023 Page 5 believing that he is not guilty of such offense and
that he is not likely to commit any offense while on bail. The bail granted u/s 436 Cr.P.C. can be
cancelled by High Court or Session Court u/s 439 (2) - Orissa High Court.
[14] The learned counsel for the respondent further submitted that the default bail is not granted on
merits, it may be canceled after the filing of a charge sheet if a strong case is made against the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144324476/ 3
Ainul Haque Talukdar vs The Directorate Of Revenue ... on 10 May, 2024
accused for a non bailable offence. But section 437(5) is the provision understood as the provision
enabling a magistrate for cancelation of bail granted by the Magistrate in respect of a non bailable
offence. Similarly, section 439(2) is the provision understood as locating the power of session judge
and the High Court for cancelling the bail.
[15] The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted written argument on behalf of the petitioner
and further submitted that although the bail granted under section 167(2) Cr.P.C can be cancelled
on an application made by the prosecution, till date no application has been filed by the prosecution
till date for cancellation o the bail granted by the Court of Special Judge (ND&PS), Tamenglong in
Cril. Misc. (B) Case No. 5 of 2023 order dated 14.09.2023.
In State through Central Bureau of Investigation Vs T. Gangi Reddy, (2023) 4 SCC 253 it is observed
as under:
"27. From the above, the law, which emerges is that mere filing of the charge-sheet
subsequent to a person is released on default bail u/s 167(2) Cr.P.C. cannot be a
ground to cancel the bail of a person, who is released on default bail."
In Babu Singh & Ors Vs The State of Uttar Pradesh, AIR 1978 SC 527 it has been observed as under:
Bail Application No. 29 of 2023 Page 6 "2. .....an order refusing an application for bail does not
necessarily preclude another on a later occasion, giving more materials further developments and
different considerations.
8. ......personal liberty, deprived when bail is refused, is too precious a value of our constitutional
system recognized under Art. 21 that the crucial power to negate it is a great trust exercisable, not
casualty but judicially, with lively concern for the cost to the individual and the community. To
glamorize impressionistic orders as discretionary may, on occasions, make a litigative gamble
decisive of a fundamental right. After all, personal liberty of an accused or convict is fundamental,
suffering lawful eclips nly in terms of procedure established by 'law'. The last four words of Art.21
are the life of that human right."
In Siddharam Satlingappa Mhetre Vs State of Maharashtra and Ors, (2011) 1 SCC 694 it has been
observed as under:
"14. When we carefully analyse this section, the wisdom of the legislature becomes
quite evident and clear that the legislature was keen to ensure respect for the
personal liberty and also pressed in service the age-old principle that an individual is
presumed to be innocent till his is found guilty by the court."
In Sanjay Chandra Vs Central Bureau of Investigation (2012) 1 SCC 40 it has been observed as
under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144324476/ 4
Ainul Haque Talukdar vs The Directorate Of Revenue ... on 10 May, 2024
"40. The grant of refusal to grant bail lies within the discretion of the court. The grant
or denial is regulated, to a large extent, by the facts and circumstances of each
particular case. But at the same time, right to bail is not to be denied merely because
of the sentiments of the community against the accused. The primary purposes of bail
in a criminal case are to relieve the accused of imprisonment, to relieve the State of
the burden of keeping him, pending trail, and at the same time, to keep the accused
constructively in the custody of the court, whether before or after conviction, to
assure that he will submit to the jurisdiction of the court and be in attendance
thereon whenever his presence is required."
In Registrar General, High Court of Patna Vs. Pandey Gajendra Prasad and Others, (2012) 6 SCC
357 it has been observed as under:
Bail Application No. 29 of 2023 Page 7 "15. Bearing in mind the scope of Article 235 of the
Constitution we may now advert to the facts at hand. As aforesaid, according to the report of the
enquiry officer only Charges II and III, as extracted above, stood proved against Respondent 1. It is
manifest that in both cases, the charge is related to the grant of bail by Respondent 1. While it is true
and relevant to note that "grant of bail" is an exercise of judicial discretion vested in a judicial officer
to be exercised depending on the facts and circumstances before him, yet it is equally important that
exercise of that discretion must be judicious having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances
and not as a matter of course."
[16] It is admitted fact that the learned Special Judge (ND&PS), Tamenglong released the
accused/petitioner on bail as default bail i.e. after the expiry of 180 days of Judicial remand and also
before filling of charge sheet, further it is also admitted fact that charge sheet was filed by the
prosecution after the default bail was granted by the learned Special Judge (ND&PS), Tamenglong,
further it is also admitted facts that I.O of the case submitted charge sheet on 21.09.2023, further it
is also an admitted fact that the prosecution did not filed any application to cancelled the bail order
of the accused/petitioner before the learned Special Judge (ND&PS), Tamenglong. But, the
accused/petitioner failed to furnish the required bonds immediately due to the petitioner being from
a very poor family and accordingly took time to furnish the same before the learned court. However,
the accused/petitioner filed an application on 27.09.2023 with the request to allow him to furnish
the required bond but the learned Special Judge (ND&PS), Tamenglong rejected.
[17] The learned Special Judge (ND&PS), Tamenglong passed the following orders;
"The UT has been produced by the Jail Authority of Manipur Central Jail, Sajiwa
through Video Conferencing using Jitsi Meet.
Ld. Counsel for the UT has filed Vakalatnama tody. She prays for releasing the UT on
bail u/s 167(2) Cr.P.C. as per order dated 14th September, 2023 passed in Cril.
Bail Application No. 29 of 2023 Page 8 Misc (B) Case No. 5 of 2023 pending
investigation and inquiry of the case by furnishing required bonds as per the said

Ainul Haque Talukdar vs The Directorate Of Revenue ... on 10 May, 2024
order passed by this Court.
However, the prosecution being the Intelligence Officer, Directorate of Revenue
Intelligence, Imphal Regional Unit had already submitted chargesheet vide order
dated 21st September, 2023 and accordingly this Court has taken cognizance of
offence u/s 21, 22(c), 23(c) & 25 of NDPS Act, 1985 vide order dated 27th September,
2023. Further, the prosecution has submitted that the R.P. has already bee n
furnished to the UT through the Addl. S.P. Central Jail, Sajiwa, Manipur on 3rd
October, 2023.
Upon submission of the chargesheet vide order dated 21st September, 2023 and the
UT being unable to furnish necessary bonds was further remanded into judicial
custody u/s 309(2) of Cr.P.C. vide order dated 27th September, 2023 for standing
trail against the charges leveled by the prosecution.
The Ld. PP has appears and prays for adjourning the charge consideration hearing
today on the ground that he is suffering from viral fever.
In the meantime, Ld. Counsel for the UT is allowed to interview and receive R.Ps
from the Jailor, Manipur Central Jail, Sajiwa.
The Ut may be allowed to contact his family member through phone whatever
necessary.
Hence, the hearing is adjourned today.
In the meantime, the order dated 14th September, 2023 passed in Cril. Misc. (B) Case
No. 5 of 2023 is not maintainable and stands cancelled.
The Addl. S.P. of Manipur Central Jail, Sajiwa, Manipur is directed to produce the
accused on 25.10.2023 at 11:30 AM for charge consideration and hearing.
Send an extract copy of this order to the Addl. S.P of Manipur Central Jail, Sajiwa,
Manipur and Standing Counsel of DRI for information."
[18] The point to be considered now is after the default bail is granted but before the submission of
required bonds chargesheet is filed by the prosecution whether the Court can dismissed the bail on
the ground that the chargesheet is filed and cognizance of the offences taken.
[19] Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that bail granted under section 167(2) can be
cancelled on an application but the order dated 11.10.2023 of the learned special Judge (ND&PS),
Tamenglong was passed thereby cancelling the bail order dated Bail Application No. 29 of 2023
Page 9 14.09.2023 only on the ground that the chargesheet was filed without any application filed by
the prosecution. Further, referred to section 437(5) and section 439(2) but both sections are not
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144324476/ 6
Ainul Haque Talukdar vs The Directorate Of Revenue ... on 10 May, 2024
applicable in the present bail application.
[20] The learned counsel for the petitioner made reference to the following judgement of the
supreme court in support of his case;
1. In State through Central Bureau of Investigation Vs T. Gangi Reddy, (2023) 4 SCC 253 it is
observed as under:
"27. From the above, the law, which emerges is that mere filing of the charge-sheet
subsequent to a person is released on default bail u/s 167(2) Cr.P.C. cannot be a
ground to cancel the bail of a person, who is released on default bail."
2. In Babu Singh & Ors Vs The State of Uttar Pradesh, AIR 1978 SC 527 it has been observed as
under:
"2. .....an order refusing an application for bail does not necessarily preclude another

8. ......personal liberty, deprived when bail is refused, is too precious a value of our

Art.21 are the life of that human right."
3. In Siddharam Satlingappa Mhetre Vs State of Maharashtra and Ors, (2011) 1 SCC 694 it has been
observed as under:
"14. When we carefully analyse this section, the wisdom of the legislature becomes
quite evident and clear that the legislature was keen to ensure respect for the
personal liberty and also Bail Application No. 29 of 2023 Page 10 pressed in service
the age-old principle that an individual is presumed to be innocent till his is found

4. In Sanjay Chandra Vs Central Bureau of Investigation (2012) 1 SCC 40 it has been observed as
under:
"40. The grant of refusal to grant bail lies within the discretion of the court. The grant

in a criminal case are to relieve the accused of imprisonment, to relieve the State of
the burden of keeping him, pending trail, and at the same time, to keep the accused
constructively in the custody of the court, whether before or after conviction, to
assure that he will submit to the jurisdiction of the court and be in attendance

5. In Registrar General, High Court of Patna Vs. Pandey Gajendra Prasad and Others, (2012) 6 SCC
357 it has been observed as under:
"15. Bearing in mind the scope of Article 235 of the Constitution we may now advert

must be judicious having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances and not as a
matter of course."
[21] In the facts and circumstances discussed above and in conjunction with the Hon'ble Supreme
Court's observation made in the forgoing I am of the view that the submission made about by the
learned counsel for the petitioner found reasonable, hence, accepted and on top of that in the
present case the Hon'ble Supreme Court's observation made in State through Central Bureau of
Investigation Vs T. Gangi Reddy, (2023) 4 SCC 253 squarely covered. Accordingly the Bail
Application No. 29 of 2023 Page 11 accused/petitioner is released on bail on his furnishing of PR
bond of Rs. 2,00,000/- (Rupees Two Lakh) only with 2 (two) sureties of two local Government
employee of like amount to the satisfaction of the learned Special Judge (ND&PS), Tamenglong. The

concerned.
As the charge sheet has already been filed and as the trial is to be started, the accused/petitioner is
directed to appear before the Ld. Trial Court on every date/dates fixed by the Ld. Court for further
proceeding of the trial.
[22] The accused/petitioner is directed to furnish the required bonds before the learned Special
Judge (ND&PS), Tamenglong within 7(seven) days.
[23] Accordingly, the present bail application is allowed and disposed of.
