Biraja Prasanna Satapathy, J.
I.A. No.704 of 2020 This is an application filed by the appellants seeking condonation of delay of
around 738 days in filing of the appeal in question.
1. It is contended that GIA Case No.578 of 2012 was filed by the sole respondent seeking extension
of the benefit of grant-in- aid under GIA Order, 1994 instead of being // 2 // covered under
Grant-In-Aid order 2004. The Tribunal vide its judgment dtd.07.09.2018 allowed the claim of the
sole respondent with a direction to extend the benefit under GIA Order, 1994.

2. It is contended that this Court vide order dated 23.06.2023 was pleased to issue notice of the
matter on the question of limitation subject to conditions that appellants shall deposit a sum of
Rs.50,000/- before the Registry on or before 24.07.2023. Pursuant to the said order an Account
Payee Cheque for Rs.50,000/- was deposited before the Registry on 31.07.2023 and the said amount
though was directed to be deposited in a fixed deposit but since the validity of the cheque has
expired, the amount is lying with the Registry. It is contended that even though the Tribunal allowed
the GIA Case, so filed by the sole respondent vide judgment dated 07.09.2008, but Addl. Secretary
to Govt. in the department of School and Mass Education vide letter dated 19.03.2020 authorize
DEO, Cuttack to file the Appeal and the Appeal was accordingly filed on 13.11.2020.
2.1. It is also contended that even though DEO, Cuttack was requested to file the Appeal vide letter
dated 19.03.2020, but because of prevailing situation arising out of COVID-19, the matter could not
be filed immediately // 3 // and after due deliberation with the office of Advocate General, the
matter was filed on 13.11.2020.
2.2. It is accordingly contended that the delay in filing of the appeal therefore is neither intentional
nor deliberate, rather a bona fide one. In support of the contention with regard to condonation of
delay, learned State Counsel relied on the stand taken in Para-2, 3 & 4 of the interim application,
which are reproduced hereunder:-
""2. That it is humbly submitted that after hearing all the sides, the GIA Case
No.578/2012 was disposed of vide judgment dated 07.09.2018 with a direction to
release grant-in-aid in favour of the teaching and non-teaching staff w.e.f. 1.6.1999
within a period of four months. That it is relevant to mention here that the aforesaid
judgment was passed after hearing and in presence of Counsel appearing for the State
Opp. Parties by the Hon'ble Tribunal and the said judgment has been communicated
by the Office of GIA case. Notwithstanding communication the aforesaid judgment,
when no step was taken for compliance of the same, at that stage, the Respondent,
who is the applicant in the GIA case No.578/2012, was constrained to file an
Execution Case No.77/2019 before the State Education Tribunal for
implementation/execution/compliance of the judgment/order dated 07.09.2018
passed in GIA Case No.578/2012.
3. That it is respectfully submitted that notwithstanding receipt of the copy of the
order dated 07.09.2018 passed in GIA Case No.578/2012, the State Govt. remain
silent by sitting over the same for more than 16 months thereafter as stated in
Paragraph-3 issued a letter on 19.03.2020 by authorizing the District Education
Officer, Cuttack, to file Appeal before the Hon'ble High Court against the aforesaid
order dated 07.09.2018 passed in GIA Case No.578/2012 of the learned Education
Tribunal. For the above period of 16 months, no explanation is forthcoming from the
limitation petition filed by the Appellant causing such delay of 16 months in issuing
an instruction to the DEO, Cuttack, regarding filing of appeal before the Hon'ble
High Court. The principles of law is settled to the extent that each days delay is
required to be explained as to why the appeal while filing the aforesaid Appeal caused

An Appeal Under Section-24-C Of The ... vs Managing Committee Of on 20 February, 2024
the aforesaid inordinate delay of 492 days in issuing instruction on 19.03.2020
4. That it is respectfully submitted that the aforesaid appeal as stated to have been
filed on 13.11.2020 // 4 // challenging the judgment dated 07.09.2018 passed in GIA
Case No.578/2012 is barred by inordinate and unexplained delay of 16 months at the
instance of the Appellant No.1.
It is relevant to mentioned here that no plausible explanation has been advanced at
the instance of the appellant in the aforesaid Appeal Case causing the delay of about
16 months, which is not only an inordinate delay but also the same is hopelessly
barred by the limitation prescribed under the aforesaid Section 24 (C) of the Orissa
Education Act. Moreover, the appellants have not explained the cause of such
inordinate delay of more than 16 months, particularly when, they have contested the
case in the proceeding of GIA Case before the State Education Tribunal. The
explanation advanced in the Paragraph-3 is nothing but a casual explanation,
particularly when, the explanation for each day delay is required to be presented in
support of such inordinate 16 months delay. Besides that when Appellants have
contested the GIA case, were well aware of the judgment dated 07.09.2018 passed in
GIA Case No.578/2012 pronounced in open Court.".
2.3. It is also contended that similar application seeking condonation of delay of around 1011 days
when was not condoned by this Court in FAO No.125 of 2016, the matter was carried to the Hon'ble
Apex Court. Hon'ble Apex Court in Civil Appeal No.11080-81 of 2017 set aside the order passed by
this court on 25.01.2017 and allowed the Appeal by condoning the delay. Not only that learned Addl.
Govt. Advocate also relied on the orders passed by the Hon'ble Apex Court on 22.11.2019 in SLP
(Civil) Diary No.33245 of 2018 and similar SLPs.
It is contended that in all the aforesaid three orders, Hon'ble Apex Court was pleased to condone the
delay in filing the Special Leave Petition by imposing a cost of Rs.50,000/- on the State. Order
passed in SLP (Civil) Diary // 5 // No.33245 of 2018 and similar SLPs are reproduced hereunder:-
"Delay condoned.
Subject to the Petitioner-State depositing a sum of Rs.50,000/- (Rupees fifty
thousand only) in the Registry of this Court within four weeks from today, issue
notice, returnable on 13.01.2020, Dasti service, in addition, is permitted.
If the amount is not deposited within the stipulated time, the special leave petition
shall stand dismissed without further reference to the Court.
Upon deposit, the amount shall be invested in a fixed deposit receipt with a
nationalized bank initially for a period of 90 days with auto renewal facility.

Diary No.39309/2018; Diary No.39347/2018; Diary No.39352/2018 Diary
NO.31098/2019; and Diary No.33665/2019 Mr. Ashok Parija, learned Senior
Counsel invited out attention to the judgment and order dated 16.09.2019 passed in
Civil Appeal No.7295 of 2019 and all other connected matters. The issue involved in
the matter was set out in para 1 of the said judgment as under:
"1. The question involved in the appeals is whether the employees are entitled to
claim grant-in-aid as admissible under the Orissa (Non-Government Colleges, Junior
Colleges and Higher Secondary Schools) Grant-in-aid Order, 1994 (hereinafter
referred to as the ' the order of 1994), after its repeal in the year 2004 by virtue of
provisions contained in Orissa (Non-government Coleges, Junior Colleges and
Higher secondary Schools) Grant-in-aid Order, 2004 (hereinafter referred to as the
'the order of 2004'). The order of 2004 has also been repealed by Orissa (Aided
Colleges, Aided Junior Colleges, and Higher Secondary Schools) Grant-in-aid Order,
2008."
The conclusion drawn by the Court as set out in para 31 was as under:
"31. It is apparent on consideration of Paragrapha 4 of order of 2004 that only saving
of the right is to receive the block grant and only in case grant in aid had been
received on or before the repeal of the Order of 2004, it shall not be affected and the
Order of 1994 shall continue only for that // 6 // purpose and no other rights are
saved. Thus, we approve the decision of the High Court in Lok Nath Behera (supra)
on the aforesaid aspect for the aforesaid reasons mentioned by us."
Relying on the aforesaid observations, it is submitted that the only right that was saved was to
receive the block grant and only in case the grant-in-aid was received on or before the repeal of the
Order of 2004. It is further submitted that the decision of the High Court in Loknath Behera was
approved by this Court. Exactly contrary situation has now been accepted by the High Court in the
orders presently under appeal.
We must however state that the matters were disposed of by the High Court as the petition in every
case was delayed by at least 800 days. In the circumstances, we pass following order:-
a) Delay condoned.
Subject to the petitioner-state depositing a sum of Rs.50,000/- (Rupees fifty thousand only), to the
account of every petition in the Registry of this Court within four weeks from today, let notices be
issued to the respondents, returnable on 13.01.2020.
Dasti service, in addition, is permitted.

b) If the amount is not deposited within the stipulated time, the special leave petitions shall stand
dismissed without further reference to the Court.
c) Upon deposit, the amount shall be invested in a fixed deposit receipt with a nationalized bank
initially for a period of 90 days with auto renewal facility.
Mr. Subhasish Mohanty, learned Advocate-on-Record, who has appeared on behalf of Caveator/
Sole respondent in SLP (Civil) Diary No.31098 of 2019, accepts notice on behalf of sole respondent.
He prays for and is granted three weeks' time to put in affidavit in reply.
Rejoinder, if any, be filed within two weeks' thereafter.
List all the matters on 213.01.2020".
2.4. Learned State Counsel also relied on the decision rendered by the Hon'ble Apex Court on
09.10.2023 in Civil Appeal No.5867 of 2015 (Sheo Raj Singh (Deceased) Through Lrs. & Ors. vs.
Union of India & Anr.) Placing reliance on the decision in Sheo Raj Singh as provided under
Section-5 of the Limitation Act, it is // 7 // contended that, the term sufficient cause is elastic
enough for Courts to do substantial justice. Further, when substantial justice and technical
considerations are pitted against one and another, the former would prevail. Since in the present
case the Tribunal allowed the claim of the respondent without following the decision of this Court in
the case of Laxmidhar Pati vs. State of Orissa & Others (1996) (I) OLR- 152 as well as other decisions
rendered by this Court, in view of the ratio decided in the case Sheo Raj Singh and the order passed
by the Hon'ble Apex Court in SLP (Civil) Diary No.33245 of 2018, 38574 of 2015 and 11604 of 2020
in condoning the delay, subject to payment of cost of Rs.50,000/- the delay in filing of the present
appeal is required to be condoned as substantial question of law is involved.
2.5. Hon'ble Apex Court in Para-31(b) and 37 of the Judgment in Sheo Raj Singh has held as
follows:-
"31.b. The expression sufficient cause is elastic enough for courts to do substantial
justice. Further, when substantial justice and technical considerations are pitted
against one another, the former would prevail".

37. Having bestowed serious consideration to the rival contentions, we feel that the
High Court's decision to condone the delay on account of the first respondent's
inability to present the appeal within time, for the reasons assigned therein, does not
suffer from any error warranting // 8 // interference. As the aforementioned
judgments have shown, such an exercise of discretion does, at times, call for a
illiberal and justice-oriented approach by the Courts, where certain leeway could be
provided to the State. The hidden forces that are at work in preventing an appeal by
the State being presented within the prescribed period of limitation so as not to allow
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/98393897/ 5
An Appeal Under Section-24-C Of The ... vs Managing Committee Of on 20 February, 2024
a higher court to pronounce upon the legality and validity of an order of a lower court
and thereby secure unholy gains, can hardly be ignored. Impediments in the working
of the grand scheme of governmental functions have to be removed by taking a
pragmatic view on balancing of the competing interests".
3. Mr. M.K. Sahoo, learned counsel appearing for the Respondent on the other hand made his
submission contending inter alia that even though G.I.A Case was disposed of by the Tribunal vide
judgment dtd.07.09.2018, but the present appeal was only filed on 13.11.2020, with delay of around
738 days. But no sufficient cause has been shown by the State-Appellant for such inordinate delay,
save and except taking a plea that the judgment passed by the Tribunal on 07.09.2018 though was
received in the Department, but State Govt. after remaining silent for more than 16 months, issued a
letter on 19.03.2020 to DEO, Cuttack to file the appeal against the judgment after due deliberation
with the learned Advocate General. Thereafter, the appeal was ultimately filed on 13.11.2020.
3.1. It is contended that neither in the Interim Application nor in the memo of appeal, any cause has
been shown with regard to the delay for the period from 07.09.2018 to 19.03.2020 and 20.03.2020
to 12.11.2020 and as to why // 9 // the O.P. No.1 even after receipt of the judgment in time sit over
the matter till 19.03.2020.
3.2. It is accordingly contended that since the delay for the period from 07.09.2018 to 19.03.2020
has not at all been explained by assigning sufficient cause, the delay in filing of the appeal is not
required to be condoned by this Court as prayed for. It is also contended that only after Hon'ble
Apex Court passed the judgment in the case of Anup Kumar Senapati on 16.09.2019, appellants
decided to challenge the judgment and that too more than 6 months from the date of judgment.
3.3. Learned counsel appearing for the Respondent also contended that the delay in filing the appeal
has not been properly explained by showing sufficient cause and in view of the decision of the
Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Postmaster General & Ors. Vs. Living Media Ltd. & Anr. ((2012) 3
SCC 563) and the decision of this Court in State of Odisha & Ors. Vs. Sales Tax Officer, Cuttack II
(W.P.(C) No. 15763 of 2021), the delay is not required to be condoned.
3.4. Hon'ble Apex Court in Para 27 and 29 of the Judgment in the case of Postmaster General & Ors.
has held as follows:-
// 10 // "27. It is not in dispute that the person(s) concerned were well aware or
conversant with the issues involved including the prescribed period of limitation for
taking up the matter by way of filing a special leave petition in this Court. They
cannot claim that they have a separate period of limitation when the Department was
possessed with competent persons familiar with court proceedings. In the absence of
plausible and acceptable explanation, we are posing a question why the delay is to be
condoned mechanically merely because the Government or a wing of the Government
is a party before us.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/98393897/ 6
An Appeal Under Section-24-C Of The ... vs Managing Committee Of on 20 February, 2024
29. In our view, it is the right time to inform all the government bodies, their agencies
and instrumentalities that unless they have reasonable and acceptable explanation
for the delay and there was bona fide effort, there is no need to accept the usual
explanation that the file was kept pending for several months/years due to
considerable degree of procedural red tape in the process. The government
departments are under a special obligation to ensure that they perform their duties
with diligence and commitment. Condonation of delay is an exception and should not
be used as an anticipated benefit for the government departments. The law shelters
everyone under the same light and should not be swirled for the benefit of a few."
Similarly this Court in the case of State of Odisha & Ors in Para -5 has held as follows:-
"5. The Supreme Court has recently in a series of matters reiterated that the
explanation usually offered by the State and its entities for the delay on account of
administrative exigencies should not be accepted unless they are shown to be
justified. A sampling of such orders is as under:
(i) Order dated 13th January 2021 in SLP No.17559 of 2020 (State of Gujarat v.
Tushar Jagdish Chandra Vyas & Anr.)
(ii) Order dated 22nd January 2021 in SLP No.11989 of 2020 (The Commissioner of Public
Instruction & Ors. v.
Shamshuddin) // 11 //
(iii) Order dated 22nd January 2021 in SLP No.25743 of 2020 (State of Uttar Pradesh & Ors v.
Sabha Narain & Ors.)
(iv) Order dated 4th February 2021 in SLP No.19846 of 2020 (Union of India v.
Central Tibetan Schools Admin & Ors)
(v) Order dated 11th January 2021 in SLP No.22605 of 2020 (The State of Odisha & Ors v. Sunanda
Mahakuda)"
3.5. Learned counsel appearing for the Respondent also relied on the decision in the
case of State of Uttar Pradesh & Others vs. Sabha Narain & Others reported in (2022)
9 SCC 266 . Hon'ble Apex Court in Para-3 to 5 of the said judgment has held as
follows:-
"3. We have repeatedly discouraged State Governments and public authorities in
adopting an approach that they can walk in to the Supreme Court as and when they
please, ignoring the period of limitation prescribed by the statutes, as if the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/98393897/ 7
An Appeal Under Section-24-C Of The ... vs Managing Committee Of on 20 February, 2024
Limitation statute does not apply to them. In this behalf, suffice to refer to our
judgments in State of M.P. v. Bherulal [State of M.P. v. Bherulal, (2020) 10 SCC 654 :
(2021) 1 SCC (Cri) 117 : (2021) 1 SCC (Civ) 101 : (2021) 1 SCC (L&S) 84] and State of
Odisha v. Sunanda Mahakuda [State of Odisha v. Sunanda Mahakuda, (2021) 11 SCC
560 : (2022) 1 SCC (Cri) 300 : (2022) 2 SCC (L&S) 393] . The leeway which was given
to the Government/public authorities on account of innate inefficiencies was the
result of certain orders of this Court which came at a time when technology had not
advanced and thus, greater indulgence was shown. This position is no more prevalent
and the current legal position has been elucidated by the judgment of this Court in
Postmaster General v. Living Media India Ltd. [Postmaster General v. Living Media
India Ltd., (2012) 3 SCC 563 : (2012) 2 SCC (Civ) 327 : (2012) 2 SCC (Cri) 580 :
(2012) 1 SCC (L&S) 649] Despite this, there seems to // 12 // be little change in the
approach of the Government and public authorities.
4. We have also categorised such kind of cases as "certificate cases" filed with the only object to
obtain a quietus from the Supreme Court on the ground that nothing could be done because the
highest Court has dismissed the appeal. The objective is to complete a mere formality and save the
skin of the officers who may be in default in following the due process or may have done it
deliberately. We have deprecated such practice and process and we do so again. We refuse to grant
such certificates and if the Government/public authorities suffer losses, it is time when officers
concerned responsible for the same, bear the consequences. The irony, emphasised by us repeatedly,
is that no action is ever taken against the officers and if the Court pushes it, some mild warning is all
that happens.
5. Looking to the period of delay and the casual manner in which the application has been worded,
we consider appropriate to impose costs on the petitioner(s) of Rs 25,000 for wastage of judicial
time which has its own value and the same be deposited with the Supreme Court
Advocates-on-Record Welfare Fund within four weeks. The amount be recovered from the officers
responsible for the delay in filing the special leave petition and a certificate of recovery of the said
amount be also filed in this Court within the same period of time".
3.6. Learned counsel for the Respondent also relied on another decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court
in the case of State of Kerala vs. Akshaya Jewellers reported in 2023 SCC OnLine SC 1437. Hon'ble
Apex Court in Para-4 & 5 of the said order has held as follows:-
"4. We have considered the rival contentions of the parties. At the outset, we find that delay of 390
days in filing the Special Leave Petition, now converted into Civil Appeal, has not been explained to
the satisfaction of this Court, inasmuch as there is no narration as to what happened between
18.02.2019, the date on which the impugned order was passed till 25.04.2019.
// 13 // Thereafter the only explanation given is that the file had got mixed up with some other files
and, therefore, ultimately only on 13.01.2021, the same was noticed and steps were taken to send a
letter to the Office of the Advocate General of the State of Kerala and a copy to the Special Govt.
Pleader (Taxes) and thereafter, steps were taken to file the appeal on 22.07.2021.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/98393897/ 8
An Appeal Under Section-24-C Of The ... vs Managing Committee Of on 20 February, 2024
5. We find that the reason cited for the gross delay of 390 days in filing the Special Leave Petition,
now converted into a Civil Appeal, does not pursuade us to condone the delay. The explanation
offered is not satisfactory and not sufficient in the eye of law to condone the delay".
3.7. Learned counsel for the Respondent also relied on the decision reported in (2020) 13 SCC 745,
Hon'ble Apex Court in Para-19 to 24 and 31 has held as follows:-
"19. Though we have exhaustively referred to the pleadings and the contentions of the
parties, including contentions put forth on merits, the same is only for completeness
and to put the matter in perspective before considering the issue relating to delay and
laches. In the instant case, considering that the Division Bench [University of Delhi v.
Union of India, 2018 SCC OnLine Del 12085] of the High Court has dismissed the
LPA on the ground of delay of 916 days, that aspect of the matter would require
consideration at the outset and the facts on merits are noted to the limited extent to
find out whether in that background the public interest would suffer.
20. The learned Senior Counsel for the appellant in order to impress upon this Court
the principle relating to consideration of "sufficient cause" for condonation of delay
and the factors that are required to be kept in view, has relied on the decision in LAO
v. Katiji [LAO v. Katiji, (1987) 2 SCC 107] wherein it is held as hereunder : (SCC pp.
108-09, para 3) "3. The legislature has conferred the power to condone delay by
enacting Section 5 [ Any appeal or any application, other than an application under
any of the provisions of Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, may be
admitted after the prescribed // 14 // period if the appellant or the applicant satisfies
the court that he had sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal or making the
application within such period.] of the Limitation Act, 1963 in order to enable the
courts to do substantial justice to parties by disposing of matters on "merits". The
expression "sufficient cause"
employed by the legislature is adequately elastic to enable the courts to apply the law in a
meaningful manner which subserves the ends of justice--that being the life-purpose for the
existence of the institution of courts. It is common knowledge that this Court has been making a
justifiably liberal approach in matters instituted in this Court. But the message does not appear to
have percolated down to all the other courts in the hierarchy. And such a liberal approach is adopted
on principle as it is realised that:
1. Ordinarily a litigant does not stand to benefit by lodging an appeal late.
2. Refusing to condone delay can result in a meritorious matter being thrown out at
the very threshold and cause of justice being defeated. As against this when delay is
condoned the highest that can happen is that a cause would be decided on merits
after hearing the parties.

An Appeal Under Section-24-C Of The ... vs Managing Committee Of on 20 February, 2024
3. "Every day's delay must be explained" does not mean that a pedantic approach
should be made. Why not every hour's delay, every second's delay? The doctrine must
be applied in a rational common sense pragmatic manner.
4. When substantial justice and technical considerations are pitted against each
other, cause of substantial justice deserves to be preferred for the other side cannot
claim to have vested right in injustice being done because of a non-deliberate delay.
5. There is no presumption that delay is occasioned deliberately, or on account of
culpable negligence, or on account of mala fides. A litigant does not stand to benefit
by resorting to delay. In fact he runs a serious risk.
6. It must be grasped that judiciary is respected not on account of its power to legalise
injustice on technical grounds but because it is capable of removing injustice and is
expected to do so.
Making a justice-oriented approach from this perspective, there was sufficient cause for condoning
the delay in the institution of the appeal. The fact that it was the "State" which was seeking
condonation and not a private party was altogether irrelevant. The doctrine of equality before law
demands that all litigants, including the State as a litigant, are accorded // 15 // the same treatment
and the law is administered in an even-handed manner. There is no warrant for according a
step-motherly treatment when the "State" is the applicant praying for condonation of delay. In fact
experience shows that on account of an impersonal machinery (no one in charge of the matter is
directly hit or hurt by the judgment sought to be subjected to appeal) and the inherited bureaucratic
methodology imbued with the note-making, file- pushing and passing-on-the-buck ethos, delay on
its part is less difficult to understand though more difficult to approve. In any event, the State which
represents the collective cause of the community, does not deserve a litigant-nongrata status. The
courts therefore have to be informed with the spirit and philosophy of the provision in the course of
the interpretation of the expression "sufficient cause". So also the same approach has to be
evidenced in its application to matters at hand with the end in view to do even-handed justice on
merits in preference to the approach which scuttles a decision on merits. Turning to the facts of the
matter giving rise to the present appeal, we are satisfied that sufficient cause exists for the delay.
The order of the High Court dismissing the appeal before it as time-barred, is therefore, set aside.
Delay is condoned. And the matter is remitted to the High Court. The High Court will now dispose of
the appeal on merits after affording reasonable opportunity of hearing to both the sides."
(emphasis in original)
21. Further the decision in Dehri Rohtas Light Railway Co. Ltd. v. District Board, Bhojpur [Dehri
Rohtas Light Railway Co. Ltd. v. District Board, Bhojpur, (1992) 2 SCC 598] is relied upon, wherein
this Court has indicated the real test to determine the delay is that the petitioner should come to

An Appeal Under Section-24-C Of The ... vs Managing Committee Of on 20 February, 2024
22. The learned Senior Counsel for Respondent 13, on the other hand, has relied upon the decision
in Postmaster General v. Living Media (India) Ltd. [Postmaster General v. Living Media (India)
Ltd., (2012) 3 SCC 563 : (2012) 2 SCC (Civ) 327 : (2012) 2 SCC (Cri) 580 : (2012) 1 SCC (L&S) 649]
wherein it is held as hereunder : (SCC p. 574, paras 28-29) "28. Though we are conscious of the fact
that in a matter of condonation of delay when there was no gross negligence or deliberate inaction
or lack of bona fides, a liberal concession has to be adopted to // 16 // advance substantial justice,
we are of the view that in the facts and circumstances, the Department cannot take advantage of
various earlier decisions. The claim on account of impersonal machinery and inherited bureaucratic
methodology of making several notes cannot be accepted in view of the modern technologies being
used and available. The law of limitation undoubtedly binds everybody, including the Government.
29. In our view, it is the right time to inform all the government bodies, their agencies and
instrumentalities that unless they have reasonable and acceptable explanation for the delay and
there was bona fide effort, there is no need to accept the usual explanation that the file was kept
pending for several months/years due to considerable degree of procedural red tape in the process.
The government departments are under a special obligation to ensure that they perform their duties
with diligence and commitment. Condonation of delay is an exception and should not be used as an
anticipated benefit for the government departments. The law shelters everyone under the same light
and should not be swirled for the benefit of a few."
23. From a consideration of the view taken by this Court through the decisions cited supra the
position is clear that, by and large, a liberal approach is to be taken in the matter of condonation of
delay. The consideration for condonation of delay would not depend on the status of the party,
namely, the Government or the public bodies so as to apply a different yardstick but the ultimate
consideration should be to render even-handed justice to the parties. Even in such case the
condonation of long delay should not be automatic since the accrued right or the adverse
consequence to the opposite party is also to be kept in perspective. In that background while
considering condonation of delay, the routine explanation would not be enough but it should be in
the nature of indicating "sufficient cause" to justify the delay which will depend on the backdrop of
each case and will have to be weighed carefully by the courts based on the fact situation. In Katiji
[LAO v. Katiji, (1987) 2 SCC 107] the entire conspectus relating to condonation of delay has been
kept in focus. However, what cannot also be lost sight of is that the consideration therein was in the
background of dismissal of the application seeking condonation of delay in a case where there was
delay of four days pitted against the consideration that was required to // 17 // be made on merits
regarding the upward revision of compensation amounting to 800%.
24. As against the same, the delay in the instant facts in filing the LPA is 916 days and as such the
consideration to condone can be made only if there is reasonable explanation and the condonation
cannot be merely because the appellant is public body. The entire explanation noticed above, depicts
the casual approach unmindful of the law of limitation despite being aware of the position of law.
That apart when there is such a long delay and there is no proper explanation, laches would also
come into play while noticing as to the manner in which a party has proceeded before filing an
appeal. In addition in the instant facts not only the delay and laches in filing the appeal is contended
on behalf of the respondents seeking dismissal of the instant appeal but it is also contended that

An Appeal Under Section-24-C Of The ... vs Managing Committee Of on 20 February, 2024
there was delay and laches in filing the writ petition itself at the first instance from which the
present appeal had arisen. In that view, it would be necessary for us to advert to those aspects of the
matter and notice the nature of consideration made in the writ petition as well as the LPA to arrive
at a conclusion as to whether the High Court was justified.

31. In the matter of condonation of delay and laches, the well-accepted position is also that the
accrued right of the opposite party cannot be lightly dealt with. In that regard, rather than taking
note of the hardship that would be caused to Respondent 13 as contended by the learned Senior
Counsel, what is necessary to be taken note of is the manner in which Respondent 11, DMRC has
proceeded in the matter. Respondent 11, DMRC is engaged in providing the public transport and for
the said purpose the Government through policy decision has granted approval to generate
resources through property development and in that regard the development as earlier indicated, is
taken up. Pursuant thereto Respondent 11 has received a sum of Rs 218.20 crores from Respondent
13 as far back as in the year 2008. The said amount as indicated is used for its projects providing
metro rail service to the commuting public. In such circumstance, if at this stage the inordinate
delay is condoned unmindful of the lackadaisical manner in which the appellant has proceeded in
the matter, it would also be contrary to public interest".
// 18 // 3.8. Similarly reliance was placed in the decision in Civil Appeal No.4440/2008 (Arising out
of SLP (C) No.6111 of 2006, Perumon Bhagvathy Devaswom, Perinadu Village vs. Bhargavi Amma
(Dead) by Lrs. & Ors.
3.9. Placing reliance on the aforesaid decisions, learned counsel appearing for the Respondent
contended that since while filing the appeal with delay of more than 738 days, no cause lest
sufficient cause has been explained with regard to delay for the period from 07.09.2018 to
19.03.2020, the delay in filing of the appeal is not to be condoned.
4. Having heard learned counsel for the Parties and after going through the materials placed before
this Court, this Court finds that the claim raised by the respondent in GIA Case No.578 of 2012 was
allowed by the Tribunal vide its judgment dtd.07.09.2018. The appeal against such an order was
filed before this Court on 13.11.2020. But it is found that no explanation has been given by assigning
any cause lest sufficient cause with regard to the delay staring from 07.09.2018 to 19.03.2020. Since
no reason has been assigned by showing sufficient cause with regard to the delay for the period from
07.09.2018 to 19.03.2020, this Court placing reliance on the decisions so cited by the learned
counsel for the Respondent, is not inclined to // 19 // condone the delay in filing of the appeal.
Accordingly, the I.A stands dismissed.
(Biraja Prasanna Satapathy) Judge
1. Since this Court is not inclined to condone the delay in filing the appeal, the appeal is accordingly
dismissed.
