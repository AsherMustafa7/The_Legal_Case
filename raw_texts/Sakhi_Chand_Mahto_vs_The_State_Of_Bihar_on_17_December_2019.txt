2/15
To issue appropriate writ/writs,
order/orders, direction/directions-
I. Declaring / Clarifying that the order
abating the BLT Case 567/2018 (Annexure 9)

3. The petitioner has sought clarification in the order
dated 03.07.2019 passed by the Bihar Land Tribunal in BLT Case
No. 567 of 2018 to the extent that after recording the abatement of
the proceeding in view of the provisions of the Bihar Land
Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling Area and Acquisition of Surplus
Land) (Amendment) Act, 2019, (hereinafter referred to as the
'Act'), it should have been held that the abatement was from the
pre-emption stage before the DCLR itself as such right of pre-
emption had become non-est by coming into effect of the aforesaid
act.
Patna High Court CWJC No.25200 of 2019 dt.17-12-2019
3/15
4. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that from
the language of the Act, by which Section 16(3) of the main Act
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/143760572/ 2
Sakhi Chand Mahto vs The State Of Bihar on 17 December, 2019
has been repealed, further goes to add that pursuant to the repeal
the purchase money together with a sum equal to 10% thereof,
shall be refunded to the depositors, which clearly indicates that the
intention of the legislature was that the right given under Section
16(3) of the main Act itself would go away. Learned counsel
submitted that such was with a view to protect the purchase money
and 10% thereof, being deposited by the pre-emptor so that such
money is refunded to him. Learned counsel submitted that the
petitioner's right to move in appeal cannot be curtailed by such
repealment and since the lis was continuing and had not attained
finality, the entire cause and right to pre-emption, as existing
earlier, would abate. Learned counsel drew the attention of the
Court to the provisions of Section 4 (1) (c) of the Bihar
Consolidation of Holdings and Prevention of Fragmentation Act,
1956, (hereinafter referred to as the 'Consolidation Act') in which
also there is pari materia provisions by which every suit and
proceeding pending before any Court or authority stood abated in
view of the coming into effect of the notification under Section 3
(1) of the Consolidation Act. Learned counsel submitted that such
repealment was the subject matter of the case before the Hon'ble
Patna High Court CWJC No.25200 of 2019 dt.17-12-2019
4/15
Supreme Court in Paras Nath Rai and others v. State of Bihar
and others reported as AIR 2013 Supreme Court 1010, the
relevant being at paragraphs no. 23, 27, 30 and 36. Learned
counsel submitted that it has been held that there was a conceptual
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/143760572/ 3
Sakhi Chand Mahto vs The State Of Bihar on 17 December, 2019
difference of abatement in civil law and the scheme of the
Consolidation Act and the legislature intended that not only the
appeal or revision would abate but the judgment, order or decree
against which the appeal is pending would also become non-est as
they would also abate and that would leave consolidation
authorities free to adjudicate the claims of title or other rights or
interest in land involved in consolidation.
5. Thus, it was submitted that Section 16 (3) of the main
Act itself being deleted, no right based on the same could be
enforceable and the same would also abate.
6. Learned counsel for the State submitted that the writ
petition is misconceived. It was submitted that the parties were
represented before the Bihar Land Tribunal when the order dated
03.07.2019
was passed and the petitioner should thus have sought any clarification by the Tribunal itself. It was
submitted that the Act by which Section 16 (3) of the main Act was repealed has mentioned the level
at which the proceeding is pending and from Patna High Court CWJC No.25200 of 2019
dt.17-12-2019 the same, it is clear that all connected proceedings would not abate and only at the
level at which they are pending would abate.
7. Having considered the facts and circumstances of the case and submissions of learned counsel for
the parties, the Court does not find any merit in the contention of learned counsel for the petitioner.
For the purpose of consideration of the present issue, it could be appropriate to reproduce the
amendment brought in the main Act by which Section 16 (3) of the main Act has been repealed. The
same reads as under:
"The Bihar Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling Area and Acquisition of Surplus Land)
(Amendment) Act, 2019* (Bihar Act 6, 2019) An Act to amend the Bihar Land
Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling Area and Acquisition of Surplus Land) Act, 1961 (Bihar
Act 12 of 1962) Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Bihar in the Seventieth
Year of the Republic of India as follows:-
1. Short title, extent and commencement.- (1) This Act may be called the Bihar Land
Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling Area and Acquisition of Surplus Land) (Amendment)
Act, 2019.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/143760572/ 4
Sakhi Chand Mahto vs The State Of Bihar on 17 December, 2019
(2) It shall extend to the whole of the State of Bihar. (3) It shall come into force immediately.
Patna High Court CWJC No.25200 of 2019 dt.17-12-2019
2. Amendment in Section 16 of the Act, 1961.- (1) Sub- section (3) of Section 16 of the said Act is
hereby repealed.
(2) In the Section-16 of the said Act, the following new sub section-(4) shall be added:-
"(4)(i) After the repeal of sub-section (3) of Section 16 of this Act, all cases or
proceedings pending before the State Government, the Board of Revenue, the Bihar
Land Tribunal, the Divisional Commissioner, the Collector, the Additional Collector,
the Deputy Collector Land Reforms or in any other Court, shall be deemed to be
abated.
(ii) Pursuant to the repeal of sub-section (3) of Section 16 of this Act, any purchase
money together with a sum equal to 10% thereof, already legally deposited shall be
refunded, without any interest, to the depositor."
_____________________________________________________ Published in Bihar
Gazette (Ex.-Ord.) dated 25.02.2019."
8. From the aforesaid language of the Act itself, it is clear that all cases or proceedings pending
before the State Government, the Board of Revenue, the Bihar Land Tribunal, the Divisional
Commissioner, the Collector, the Additional Collector, the Deputy Collector Land Reforms or in any
other Court, shall be deemed to be abated. The Court would pause here. The reason why Patna High
Court CWJC No.25200 of 2019 dt.17-12-2019 various authorities have been mentioned in the Act
leaves no doubt that the legislature was conscious that there would be stages where such proceeding
would be pending and coupled with the fact that only cases or proceeding pending before the
authorities shall be deemed to be abated, leaves no scope of any ambiguity or confusion as to what
was the intent or the legislature. Once the abatement is with regard to proceeding pending and that
too, at various levels, the only interpretation would be that only such proceeding shall abate. As a
corollary, the position existing prior to the proceeding which has abated, would be deemed to revive.
This is one part of the issue. The other part, as learned counsel for the petitioner has pointed out, is
the provision by which any purchase money together with sum equal to 10% thereof, has been
directed to be refunded to the depositors. Though learned counsel for the petitioner has tried to
emphasize the fact that such provision shows that the original amount on which the right under
Section 16 (3) of the main Act was claimed by depositing the purchase money together with a sum
equal to 10% thereof, by providing it to be refunded, would mean that the intent of the legislature
was to extinguish the right from the very inception, in the considered opinion of the Court, would
not be the correct interpretation. The said provision, has been provided for the specific reason that
the Patna High Court CWJC No.25200 of 2019 dt.17-12-2019 same shall be refunded "without any
interest". A money deposited by a person cannot be forfeited by any authority or provision in the
statute without justifiable reason. Thus, the question of refund of the money was not an issue, which
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/143760572/ 5
Sakhi Chand Mahto vs The State Of Bihar on 17 December, 2019
was required to be brought about in the Act. Rather, such provision has been brought about only for
preventing any confusion as to what amount would be ultimately refunded to the depositor. The act
provides that the same shall be without any interest of the depositors. In view thereof, the Court
finds that such provision would not have any bearing on the issue as to whether the claim itself
under Section 16(3) of the main Act would stand abated right from its inception.
9. As far as, the decision in the case of Paras Nath Rai (supra) is concerned, the Court would only
indicate that though the provision of the Consolidation Act may be somewhat similar to the
language of the Act, but the basic difference between the two cannot be lost sight of. The difference
is that by providing for abatement of all suit and proceeding pending before any Court or authority,
whether of the first instance or appeal, reference or revision, has to be read in the context that an
alternative was provided for the purpose of adjudicating such rights. This is a stark difference
between the provisions of the Consolidation Act and the language and intent of the Act by which, a
right which was present Patna High Court CWJC No.25200 of 2019 dt.17-12-2019 has been taken
away. The language of the Act itself clearly states that it shall come into force immediately i.e. with
effect from 25.02.2019. The Hon'ble Supreme Court, has also taken this factor into account in the
case of Paras Nath Rai (supra) which would be clear form the following paragraphs:
"23. In Chattar Singh (AIR 1975 SC 1499) (supra) while the appeal was pending
before this Court a notification had been issued under Section 4 of the 1953 Act. By
virtue of the operation of Section 5(2)(a) of the said Act, there was a statutory
abatement of the suit and other proceedings pending therefrom. The three-Judge
Bench referred to the decision in Ram Adhar Singh (AIR 1968 SC 714) (supra) and
opined that even appeals pending before this Court would abate consequent upon
statutory provision. This Court ruled that the suit and the appeal stood abated and it
was open to the parties to work out their rights before the appropriate consolidation
authorities.
xxxxx
27. It is worthy to note that this Court noticed the conceptual difference of abatement in civil law
and in the scheme of the 1956 Act, and observed that if the abatement as conceptually understood in
the Code of Civil Procedure is imported to Section 4 of the 1956 Act, it would cause irreparable harm
and the party whose appeal is pending would lose the chance of convincing the Patna High Court
CWJC No.25200 of 2019 dt.17-12-2019 appellate court which, if successful, would turn the tables
against the other party in whose favour the judgment, decree or order would become final on
abatement of the appeal. The Bench further proceeded to state that regard being had to the same,
the legislature intended that not only the appeal or revision would abate but the judgment, order or
decree against which the appeal is pending would also become non est as they would also abate and
that would leave consolidation authorities free to adjudicate the claims of title or other rights or
interest in land involved in consolidation.

Sakhi Chand Mahto vs The State Of Bihar on 17 December, 2019
30. From the aforesaid enunciation of law it is crystal clear that once a notification has been
published under Section 3 of the Act, every suit and proceeding in respect of declaration of rights or
interest in any land lying in areas or for declaration or adjudication of any other rights in regard to
which proceeding can or ought to be taken under the Act pending before any court or authority
whether of the first instance or of appeal, reference or revision, shall, on order being passed in that
behalf by the court or authority before whom such suit or proceeding is pending shall stand abated
with a view to ensure the jurisdiction of the authorities under the Consolidation Act remains
unhampered and the said authorities are not obstructed by the proceedings in civil courts and their
decisions are not impeded by Patna High Court CWJC No.25200 of 2019 dt.17-12-2019 the
decisions of the civil courts. It is also vivid that the purpose of the scheme of consolidation is to
avoid conflict of jurisdiction in order to confer jurisdiction on the consolidation authorities who are
required to exclusively examine the rival claims of the parties. Apart from that there is conceptual
difference between statutory abatement and abatement under the Code of Civil Procedure. On the
basis of a statutory abatement, the whole proceeding from its inception stands abated because the
local law has provided an effective alternative remedy to be perused before an exclusive forum to
remedy the grievance raised before the court. It has been further pronounced by this Court that
nothing remains to be adjudicated before the civil court and it is apt to note in the case of
Satyanarayan Prasad Sah (supra) this Court had held that the High Court should not have nullified
the decree of the trial court but should have declared that the proceedings stood abated which meant
that civil proceedings came to a naught, that is to say, the proceedings from its commencement
stood abated.

36. The Full Bench was dealing with an appeal directed against the final decree for partition. The
question before the Full Bench was whether under Section 4(4) of the Orissa Consolidation of
Holdings and Prevention of Administration of Land Act, 1972 (for short `the 1972 Act') a final
decree Patna High Court CWJC No.25200 of 2019 dt.17-12-2019 stood abated. The Full Bench
referred to the notification issued under Section 3(1) of the 1972 Act, scanned the language
employed in sub-section (4) of Section 4 and came to hold that a final decree proceeding cannot be
characterized as a suit or a proceeding for right, title or interest in respect of any land. It has been
opined there that Section 4(4) does not include an appeal arising out of a final decree as the same
would not declare any right, title or interest of the parties but deal with certain matters pertaining to
what has already been declared. Pendency of an appeal against the final decree cannot take away the
finality of the preliminary decree which has already declared the rights, title and interest of the
parties. We may repeat for clarity that in the said case, the preliminary decree passed in the suit had
become final as it was not challenged by way of an appeal. Thus, the factual matrix was quite
different. Suffice it to say that in the present case the title appeal was pending against the
preliminary decree and an application under Section 4(c) had been preferred. It would have been
advisable on the part of the appellate court to record a finding that the entire proceeding of the civil
suit stood abated. Unfortunately, the appellate court directed abatement because of
non-substitution of the legal heirs of one of the respondents. We are conscious that an order is to be
passed on an application filed under Section 4 (c) of the Act, but we do not intend to relegate the
matter to that stage Patna High Court CWJC No.25200 of 2019 dt.17-12-2019 as it is obvious that in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/143760572/ 7
Sakhi Chand Mahto vs The State Of Bihar on 17 December, 2019
the suit, right, title and interest and status were involved which do come within the scheme of
consolidation. Hence, the suit as well as the appeal abated and resultantly the very commencement
of the civil proceeding came to a naught and, therefore, findings recorded in the said proceeding
became extinct. The learned Judge dealing with the writ petition as well as the learned Judges
deciding the intra-court appeal did not appreciate the lis in proper perspective and opined that the
reliance on the findings recorded by the civil court by the revisional authority under the 1956 Act
could not be faulted. The said conclusion is wholly erroneous and deserves to be overturned and we
do so."
10. From the above, it is clear that the Hon'ble Supreme Court, in the background that the
abatement led to creation of an alternative forum, came to the conclusion that the legislature
intended that all the rights related to the issue be decided by the newly created forum and not
obstructed by the proceedings in Civil Courts and their decisions do not come in the way of such
decision by the freshly constituted authority and that the purpose of the scheme of consolidation
was to avoid conflict of jurisdiction in order to confer jurisdiction on the consolidation authorities
who are required to exclusively examine the rival claims of the parties. This is clear from paragraph
no. 27 of the aforesaid judgment Patna High Court CWJC No.25200 of 2019 dt.17-12-2019 where it
has been recorded that "the legislature intended that not only the appeal or revision would abate but
the judgment, order or decree against which the appeal is pending would also become non est as
they would also abate and that would leave consolidation authorities free to adjudicate the claims of
title or other rights or interest in land involved in consolidation."
11. From the same, it is clear that since an alternative forum had been provided for adjudication of
the claim, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held by interpreting that all the decisions in the entire chain,
right from the original Court till the last stage, would abate. In the present case, a right has been
taken away. However, the abatement is only with regard to the proceeding pending at various
different levels. In such view of the matter, in the considered opinion of the Court, the decision and
reasoning of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Paras Nath Rai (supra) would not be applicable in the
facts and circumstances of the present case for reasons already discussed above.
12. The Court would further add, at the cost of repetition, that by the Act, a right has been taken
away and not replaced by any other right. Moreover, the taking away of the right has also been made
effective from 25.02.2019 and there is no retrospectivity attached to the same, for law requires that
every Patna High Court CWJC No.25200 of 2019 dt.17-12-2019 law shall be operative prospectively
unless retrospectivity is provided in the law itself, which has not been done in the present case.
13. Once the Court finds that the abatement is only with regard to the proceeding which is pending,
upon such abatement, the situation/ position which was existing prior to initiation of such
proceeding, would automatically stand revived, which may include either an order in favour of the
depositor who claims pre-emption or in favour of the purchaser, in whose favour there may be a
decision of the Court/ authority just below the authority/ Court where the matter was pending as on
25.02.2019.
14. Accordingly, for reasons aforesaid, the application stands dismissed.

15. However, if the petitioner has any remedy available to him, in accordance with law, it shall
always be open to him to avail of the same.
