appearing for the private respondents.
3. The brief facts are stated as follows:-
On 05.02.2004, the Chief Minister of Karnataka in his budget speech articulated that
the Grama Vidyuth Pratinidhis (GVPs) scheme would be introduced with the object
of providing employment opportunities amongst youth in rural areas. The GVPs were
to read meters, collect bills and engage in minor repair works for which they will be
paid a fixed remuneration out of the bill amounts recovered.
On the basis of this speech, the 5 Electricity Distribution Companies in the State of
Karnataka appointed GVPs after publishing newspaper advertisements. The
eligibility criteria was not uniform among all the 5 companies and the reservation
rules was followed only by GESCOM only in the first appointment process. None of
the other Electricity Supply Companies (ESCOMS) followed the reservation policy
while appointing GVPs on contract as they were not employees. The GVPs were
required to furnish Bank Guarantees and their remuneration was not uniform among
the companies and depended on their monthly collection. As on 23.02.2015, 3498
GVPs were working in all 5 companies.
The terms of engagement of the GVPs are contained in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
which has undergone changes from time to time. The duration of the MOU was for a period of one
year which has been extended from time to time. The responsibilities of the GVPs and payments
which are linked to performance are set out in the MOU, and the MOU stipulates that the GVPs will
not be treated as employees.
As the GVPs made various demands in respect of their terms of engagement, a 13 Member
Committee was constituted which included representatives of the GVPs to examine 10 points in
respect of the GVPs. This Committee submitted its report dated 23.02.2015 recommending that
equal, uniform remuneration be paid and that medical allowance, the new pension scheme and
accident benefits can be provided on a humanitarian basis. However, it has been recommended that
it is not possible to regularise the GVPs.
On 05.09.2019, an interim order was passed in W.P. No. 43037/2015 directing the Government, in
consultation with all the concerned departments, to take a policy decision as to the
recommendations of the 13 Member Committee within a time bound manner. In furtherance of the
same, the Government order dated 02.11.2019 was passed. The aforesaid Government order notes
that based on the report of the 13 Member Committee, changes have been included like the payment
of Rs.12,000/- uniform remuneration and Rs.2,000/- incentive and that a sum of Rs.2,00,000/-
compensation shall be provided in case of death while on duty and an additional Rs.5,000/- to meet
medical expenses. After considering the opinions given by the Department of Personnel and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/96263625/ 637
Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply ... vs Sri C H Kumar on 24 January, 2025
Administrative Reforms, the Law Department and the Finance Department, the Government, vide
order dated 02.11.2019 has come to the conclusion that there is no provision to regularise the GVPs
or provide relaxation in educational qualifications and weightage based on service, when they apply
for the post of meter readers.
4. The learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants contended that the order of the learned
Single Judge is unsustainable on facts of law. A bare reading of the impugned order suggests that
assumptions are made with regard to duties discharged by GVPs and regular employees of lower
cadre. The judgments relied by the learned single judge are completely different to the facts and
circumstances of the present case. The work of GVPs is not a full time employment and it is only a
part time work for ad hoc purposes of meter reading and collection of bill amount. The learned
Single Judge had not considered any judgments relied upon by the appellants nor appreciated the
distinguishing factors pointed out by the appellants. GVP is created to provide employment to rural
youth on contractual basis. Therefore, granting relief of regularization does not arise. The learned
Single Judge erred in coming to the conclusion that they are the permanent employees. The
executive statements cannot be enforced when they are not in consonance with law, rules and
regulations relating to public employment. The finding of fact that duties discharged by GVPs has
the trappings of public services is without any basis. The work carried out by the GVPs on behalf of
appellants is purely on the basis of principle - agent relationship governed in MOU. The learned
Single Judge relied upon the law laid down by Apex Court in the case of Chander Mohan Negi vs.
State of Himachal Pradesh in Civil Appeal No.2813/2017, which is factually incorrect. The learned
Single Judge failed to appreciate that one of the recommendations of the committee is that it would
not be possible to appoint GVPs through regularization against the vacant posts of meter readers
and by virtue of Government Order dated 02.11.2019, the State had rejected the request of
petitioners for formulating the scheme and absorption.

6. The learned senior counsel appearing for the respondents contended that the GVPs are selected
through a recruitment process with procedure as stipulated by the appellant-ESCOMS. A scheme
was formulated to engage the services of rural unemployed youths as GVPs. The scheme was
intended to provide employment opportunities to the small and marginal farmers in the rural areas,
where unemployed rural folk would work as GVPs. The Companies invited applications for
recruitment showing the criteria which a candidate had to fulfill, such as age, educational
qualifications, etc. The work assigned to the GVPs are the statutory duties in terms with the
Electricity Act, 2003 and Karnataka State Electricity Regulatory Commission (Electricity Supply)
Code, 2004. In order to strengthen their contentions they have placed reliance upon the judgment of
the Apex Court in the case of State v. C. N. Manjunath reported in (2017) 11 SCC 361. GVPs have
spent two decades working for appellant-ESCOMS, therefore, it is an obligation on the part of the
appellants to act fairly and to adopt procedure which is 'fairplay in action'. It would turn rise a
legitimate expectation in every person to be treated fairly, when dealing with a state entity. In
support of their contentions they have placed reliance on the judgment of the Apex Court in the case
of Food corporation of India v. Kamadhenu cattle Feed Industries reported in (1993) 1 SCC 71 para
7&8, and State of Jharkhand v. Brahamputra Metallics ltd. reported in (2023) 10 SCC
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/96263625/ 641
Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply ... vs Sri C H Kumar on 24 January, 2025
634. The State cannot take up a defense stating that there are no sanctioned posts to absorb the
respondents after utilizing their services for a long duration. To strengthen this statement they have
relied upon the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Nihal Singh v. State of Punjab, reported in
(2013) 14 SCC 65, paragraphs No.20, 23, 24, 32, 33, 35, 37 and 39. If the work carried out by the
contract laborers is of perennial nature and permanent one, such employment cannot be treated as
contractual employment. In order to strengthen this statement they have relied upon the judgment
of Apex Court in the case of M/s. Pawan Hans ltd. v. Aviation Karmachari Sanghatana, civil appeal
no. 353/2020, Narendra kumar Tiwari v. State of Jharkhand reported in (2018) 8 SCC 238 and
Sheo Narain Nagar vs. State of Uttar Pradesh reported in (2018) 13 SCC 432. It is contended that the
judgment of the Apex Court in Umadevi's case (supra), ought to be interpreted in a pragmatic
manner and persons who have completed 10 years of service ought to be regularized. In order to
substantiate this statement they have placed reliance on the para 7 of the judgment of Narendra
Kumar (supra) and para 37 of the judgment of Nihal Singh (supra).

8. Shri Pradeep C.S, learned Additional Advocate General (AAG) appearing for the appellants in
W.A.No.282/2022 submits that the contract or the MOU entered into between the ESCOMS and the
GVPs were never under challenge and it is only under such contracts that the writ petitioners placed
their case. It is submitted that with the march of technology, prepaid metering is being adopted all
over Karnataka and there is no necessity for the engagement of large number of persons to carry out
the reading of the meters and the other functions assigned to them. It is submitted that the
employers cannot be forced to create posts and engage persons for whom they have no needs and
that the financial aspects of the matter are also liable to be considered.
9. The learned Additional Advocate General contended that the GVPs were engaged under a MOU
that explicitly provides for termination based on performance (Clause 8, particularly 8.3.2). The
learned Single Judge quashed the Government Orders and directed a disciplinary inquiry, despite
the MOU not envisioning one. Since the GVPs are not regular employees, the introduction of
disciplinary proceedings, which typically apply to permanent personnel, prejudices the ESCOMS
and contravenes the clear terms of the MOU. The MOU stipulates that GVPs are appointed on a
"contract for service," with no fixed wages but a performance-linked remuneration. It also states
categorically that GVPs are agents, not employees, of the ESCOMS. Thus, there can be no claim for
regularization or absorption arising from such a purely contractual arrangement. Further, learned
AAG has contended that the learned Single Judge failed to accord due weight to the fundamental
nature of this contractual setup. Although the learned Single Judge concluded by saying that there is
a master-servant relationship largely because the MOUs were renewed periodically, a co-ordinate
Bench of this Court in the case of H. Raghavendra v. MD BESCOM in W.P.No.58814/2013 has
expressly held that GVPs engagements are purely contractual. The impugned judgment neither
distinguishes this precedent nor justifies departing from it, rendering it unsustainable. The GVPs
entered into the MOU voluntarily, without any coercion, fully aware of its contractual conditions.
Established case law holds that those accepting contractual terms of engagement cannot
subsequently claim permanency. The learned Single Judge overlooked this principle, thereby
warranting interference with the impugned order. Regularization is legally permissible only against
sanctioned posts. As no such posts exist for GVPs and as their qualifications, recruitment, and duties
differ from linemen or meter readers and the question of absorbing them as regular employees does
not arise. Equating their service to that of sanctioned posts is factually and legally incorrect.
10. The learned AAG further contended that the learned Single Judge by citing Umadevi's case,
failed to consider that imposing regularization obligations on the ESCOMS (and thus the State
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/96263625/ 645
Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply ... vs Sri C H Kumar on 24 January, 2025
Exchequer) creates a significant financial burden and could open floodgates for similar litigation.
The impugned judgment overlooks this crucial aspect of public finance management. While the
learned Single Judge observed that the judgment of ONGC v. Krishna Gopal are referred to a Larger
Bench, the unchallenged legal conclusions of that judgment remain binding. The impugned
judgment's reliance on an incomplete reading of that precedent, is therefore flawed. Ordering the
GVPs be paid on par with regular sanctioned posts contravenes the principle of "equals being
treated equally"
under Article 14 of the Constitution of India. The GVPs role does not exist in the
sanctioned establishment, so equating them with different cadres is legally untenable.
For all the above reasons, the impugned judgment is liable to be set aside.
11. We have considered the contentions advanced. The Government of Karnataka had taken a policy
decision to provide employment opportunities to the educated youth in rural areas by introducing a
scheme for appointment of GVPs in the ESCOMS in the State. The intention of the scheme was to
give responsibilities, such as, Meter Reading, Collection of Bill Amounts and Minor Electrical Repair
Works to Rural Youth within the jurisdiction of the respective Village Panchayaths. The scheme
envisaged that they would be entitled to fixed remuneration out of the bill amount recovered by
them. The scheme was announced by the then Chief Minister of Karnataka while presenting
2004-2005 budgets on the floor of the Legislative Assembly.
12. On the basis of the said declaration, a recruitment process was undertaken and notifications
were issued from persons within the age group of 18 to 38 years possessing ITI Trade Certificate or
Diploma or degree, SSLC/PUC with knowledge of electricity billing and connection, who are
ordinary residents of the Villages concerned. The selectees were required to furnish Bank Guarantee
as security for services to undergo classroom/on-field training and were engaged to generate power
bills, collect the bill amount from consumers, submit proposals for new connections, attend to
complaints of consumers and carry out all work entrusted by the ESCOMS from time to time. 10% of
the monthly collection was to be paid as incentive. The GVPs were subject to transfer from one unit
to another and to disciplinary action, if required. Further, they would get Rs.5,000/- as medical
expenses and a compensation of Rs.2 Lakh in case of death due to electrical accidents.
13. After the selection process, Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was entered into between
the ESCOMS and the GVPs and they had been functioning as such for several years. While so,
several of them sought regularization of their services and better remuneration and working
conditions at par with regular employees of the ESCOMS. The matter was referred to a High Level
Committee (HLC) by the Government for a consideration of their contentions. The HLC, which
consisted of the representatives of all the ESCOMS as well as the representatives of the KPTCL., and
the Government as well as the representatives of the employees had considered the entire issue and
had recommended to the Government as follows:-
"1. The works that are being done by the Rural Electric Representatives are major
works of the Electricity Supply Companies.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/96263625/ 646
Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply ... vs Sri C H Kumar on 24 January, 2025
2. As all the works being done by the Rural Electric Representatives are uniform in all
the Electricity Supply Companies equal remuneration can be provided.
3. As the Rural Electric Representatives are carrying out the major responsibilities of
the Company, apart from uniform remuneration, medical allowance, new pension
scheme and accident benefits can be provided on humanitarian basis.
4. It is not possible to regularize the Micro Feeder Franchisee Jobs and compensate it
with the vacant meter readers posts in the Electricity Supply Companies. Because,
they are working on yearly contract basis with the Electricity Supply Companies and
hence are completely serving as franchisees."
14. However, the Government after considering the recommendations in consultation with the Law
Department and the Finance Department initially passed an order dated on 02.11.2019 rejecting the
recommendations. The said order was challenged before this Court in W.P.No.52014/2019 and by
judgment dated 31.08.2020, the order was set aside and re-consideration was ordered on the
ground that there is no rule permitting the regularization of the GVPs or providing facilities like
relaxation and educational qualification or weight-age based on their service tenure, while filling up
the posts of meter readers that are available in the various electrical companies. The GVPs challenge
the order of the Government and by the Judgment under appeal, the learned Single Judge
considered the batch of writ petitions and directed as follows:-
"i) A writ of certiorari issues quashing the impugned Govt. Orders whereby GVPs'
claim for absorption/regularization and for the grant of wages in regular pay scales
has been rejected;
ii) A writ of mandamus issues to the first respondent to frame a Fair Scheme for
considering the claim of GVPs for regularization/ absorption in service, keeping in
view the High Level Committee Recommendations, the current services of the GVPs
shall not be dispensed with except on the ground of proven delinquency or the like;
iii) A writ of mandamus issues to the respondents to identify the posts whose Job
Chart substantially matches with the work being done by the GVPs and to pay them
the wages in the minimum of the pay scales admissible to such posts, having in mind
the Recommendations of High Level Committee and observations in Kollaiah Case,
with effect from 02.10.2020, being the Jayanthi of Father of the Nation;
iv) A writ of certiorari issues quashing the impugned termination orders in
W.P.No.43037/2015 and in W.P.No.44902/2015, with liberty to hold disciplinary
enquiry within eight weeks, if not found guilty, these petitioners shall be reinstated
without any consequential benefits such as back wages, counting of service, etc., and
v) The respondent-Govt., KPTCL and the ESCOMs shall report compliance of above
directions to the Registrar General of this Court within two weeks following the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/96263625/ 647
Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply ... vs Sri C H Kumar on 24 January, 2025
expiry of respective periods prescribed in the paragraphs, supra."
The ESCOMS, as well as the State Government, are in appeal against the directions issued by the
learned Single Judge.
15. The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the ESCOMS contended that the GVPs were engaged
by the ESCOMS only to provide the limited services and the contract between the ESCOMS and the
GVPs was essentially only a contract for service. It is contended that the persons, who were engaged
on contract as Micro Feeder Franchise (MFF) had entered into an MOU clearly spelling out the
duties and responsibilities after furnishing a Bank Guarantee and was entitled only to proportionate
remuneration and were not employees at all. It is contended that there are no sanction posts
available to accommodate them and that they do not have the qualification required for
appointment to the post of Bill Collectors or Meter Readers, which are the sanctioned posts
available. The contract between the GVPs and the ESCOMS is specifically pleaded to be a contract
for service and as such no question of regularization would arise at all.
16. It is further contended that the decisions of the Apex Court including the one in the case of
Secretary, State of Karnataka v. Uma Devi reported in (2006) 4 SCC 1, would make it clear that the
persons engaged on contract basis cannot claim regularization in the absence of regular sanctioned
posts, for which they are duly qualified. It is further contended that HLC was only an advisory
committee formed to consider the grievances of GVPs and that the recommendations of the
Committee can, by no stretch of imagination, be seen as binding on the Government which has to
take a decision on the basis of the legal as well as financial implications and the recommendations of
the Committee have been specifically considered and rejected by the Government for cogent
reasons. It is therefore contended that the directions issued by the learned Single Judge were
completely untenable and the valid objections raised by the ESCOMS have been completely ignored
by the learned Single Judge. It is contended that the directions issued by the learned Single Judge
are impossible of compliance and that the ESCOMS cannot be saddled with the financial burden of
regularization of a large number of GVPs, who were intended only to provide the limited services to
the Companies as service providers.
17. The learned senior counsel for the respondents would on the other hand contend that it was on
the basis of the policy decision of the Government of Karnataka that a scheme for appointment of
GVPs in the ESCOMS was conceptualized and given effect to by the ESCOMS. It is submitted that
the Public Notifications were issued and it was after a regular selection process that the GVPs were
appointed. It is submitted that they were provided over 15 days of training in the Electricity Code,
Electricity Supply Code as well as in carrying out their statutory functions and duties including
fixing of meter, reading of meter etc.
18. It is submitted that the duties carried out by the GVPs are statutory functions and duties, which
are subject to the provisions of the Electricity Act, the Electricity Supply Code and the Rules and
Regulations made thereunder. It is contended that in the light of the control exercised by the
ESCOMS, the contract in question is admittedly a contract of service and any contentions to the
contrary is totally untenable.

19. Shri. Aditya Sondhi, learned senior counsel appearing for the writ petitioners in eighteen of these
writ petitions as instructed by Advocate Smt. Shwetha Ravishankar, submits that the report of the
HLC considers all relevant aspects of the matter and should not have been lightly discarded by the
State Government. It is submitted that the transfer orders and the show-cause notices issued by the
employers would clearly show that there is an employer-employee relationship involved and that the
plea that the MOUs are the contract for service is completely untenable. It is further submitted that,
all that the HLC had recommended was equal remuneration and benefits for the work done by the
GVPs since they were carrying out the responsibilities of Meter Readers, Assistant Lineman,
Lineman and Junior Assistant in the ESCOMS. It is submitted that the Apex Court in the case of
Jaggo v. Union of India and others reported in 2024 SCC OnLine SC 3825, has also clarified that the
decision of the Constitution Bench in Umadevi's case (supra), should not be used to defraud
employees, who have been forced to work for long years of their just dues.
20. It is evident from the decisions which are relied on that regularization of contract employees is
not an accepted mode of recruitment into public service. The Constitution Bench of the Apex Court
in Umadevi's case (supra), has clearly held that indiscriminate regularization of contractual and ad
hoc employees would amount to a fraud on the constitutional framework of recruitment and
selection to public employment. However, this does not mean that the State, which is intended to be
a model employer, should be permitted to hold out promises of public employment as part of its
avowed public policy, extract labour from employees selected through a due recruitment process for
decades together and then plead the existence of a contract of employment or a memorandum of
understanding to contend that they are not entitled to any benefits including fair wages for the work
actually done by them. After taking a policy decision for engaging qualified rural youth for the
purpose of the statutory duties of the Corporations, who are licensees under the Electricity Act, the
State and the ESCOMS cannot, thereafter, turn around to contend that the employees are not
entitled to any benefits and the contracts are terminable at pleasure. We have already found that the
contracts in question, regardless of the wordings used therein, are contracts of service and not
contracts for service as contended by the State and the licensees. Even if it is argued that the
employees in question are not entitled to regularization, it cannot be said that the other claims
raised for fair wages and proper conditions of service can be rejected by the State on the grounds as
contained in order impugned before the learned Single Judge.
21. We notice that the learned Single Judge, after considering the contentions and the arguments,
has set aside the Government Order and directed the Government to frame a fair scheme for
considering the claims for regularization, equal pay and fair working conditions for the large
numbers of GVPs engaged under the scheme.
22. The question which arises for consideration therefore is:
"Whether the directions issued by the learned Single Judge require any interference?"
23. The learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants submits that even if all the contentions
are accepted, the GVPs would not be entitled to regularization since what was envisaged was only a
contractual engagement. We notice that the policy announced on the floor of the house was to utilize
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/96263625/ 649
Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply ... vs Sri C H Kumar on 24 January, 2025
the services of unemployed youth for carrying out meter reading and such other activities by the
licensees, who are the appellants herein. The question as to the nature of work carried out by the
private respondents and the equivalence of qualification, nature of work etc., are matters which fall
specifically within the realm of policy. The State Government, having taken a policy decision to
provide employment to unemployed rural youth and thereafter having appointed a High Level
Committee to study the issue of their service conditions, cannot thereafter refuse to consider the
report of such committee in the proper perspective. It is not in dispute that the GVPs were engaged
on contractual basis after undergoing a due selection process on the basis of a scheme envisaged by
the Government. It is also not in dispute that the Writ Petitioners were working for nearly two
decades on renewal of their contractual engagements. It is also not in dispute that the ESCOMS have
been exercising clear and direct supervisory control over the personnel as is evident from the order
of transfer as well as the termination orders issued to some of them. Even after the decision of the
Apex Court in Umadevi's case (supra), the State of Karnataka, in exercise of its legislative powers,
had enacted the Karnataka Daily Wage Employees Welfare Act, 2012, to address the grievances of
the ad-hoc employees engaged in public service, who had no claims for regularization in terms of the
judgment of the Apex Court. We find that the learned Single Judge has considered all relevant
factors and materials to come to the conclusion that the claims of the Writ Petitioners are liable to
be considered. Even, in case all the arguments of the companies and the Government are accepted,
we feel that the Government cannot refuse to work out the scheme for fair wages and conditions of
service of a large number of persons admittedly engaged in public employment as part of the State
Policy for carrying out the essential and statutory duties of the Electricity Transmission Companies.
Though economic considerations may be relevant and of importance from the point of view of the
Government, we are of the opinion that even such considerations cannot stand in the way of the
Government considering a fair scheme with regard to the fair wages and proper conditions of service
for the Writ Petitioners.
24. Having considered the contentions advanced and given our anxious consideration to the case
law placed before us, we hold that the contract entered into by the ESCOMS with the writ petitioners
cannot be characterized as a contract for service and is definitely a contract of service in view of the
clear and direct control exercised by the appellants on the writ petitioners. We also notice that the
statutory duties being performed by the writ petitioners would have to be carried out by the
appellants. There is no material on record to show that the appellants do not require the services of
the petitioners to carry out such duties.
25. In the above view of the matter, we are of the opinion that even if the contention that the
regularization could not be ordered by this Court, this Court exercising powers under Article 226 of
the Constitution of India would be well within its powers, in the facts and circumstances of the
instant batch of cases, in directing the State Government to frame a scheme for fair wages and
proper working conditions of the personnel engaged in the licensee companies as a part of State
Policy. We notice that the Apex Court in Jaggo's case (supra), deprecated the practice of extracting
service and thereafter relying on the claim of the Constitutional Bench in Umadevi's case (supra), to
deny benefits of long service to low paid employees. It was specifically held in paragraph No.26, as
follows:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/96263625/ 650
Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply ... vs Sri C H Kumar on 24 January, 2025
"26. While the judgment in Uma Devi (supra) sought to curtail the practice of backdoor entries and
ensure appointments adhered to constitutional principles, it is regrettable that its principles are
often misinterpreted or misapplied to deny legitimate claims of long-serving employees. This
judgment aimed to distinguish between "illegal" and "irregular" appointments. It categorically held
that employees in irregular appointments, who were engaged in duly sanctioned posts and had
served continuously for more than ten years, should be considered for regularization as a one-time
measure. However, the laudable intent of the judgment is being subverted when institutions rely on
its dicta to indiscriminately reject the claims of employees, even in cases where their appointments
are not illegal, but merely lack adherence to procedural formalities. Government departments often
cite the judgment in Uma Devi (supra) to argue that no vested right to regularization exists for
temporary employees, overlooking the judgment's explicit acknowledgment of cases where
regularization is appropriate. This selective application distorts the judgment's spirit and purpose,
effectively weaponizing it against employees who have rendered indispensable services over
decades."
26. Further, in the facts and circumstance of the case, we are in agreement with the findings of the
learned Single Judge that the contract being one of service, it can be terminated on allegations of
malfeasance or misfeasance only after issuance of due notice in that regard. The directions issued by
the learned Single Judge are therefore upheld. The interim order dated 30.09.2024 passed in
W.A.No.684/2020, is sustained and made absolute.
27. In the facts and circumstances, we are of the opinion that the appeals can succeed only to the
limited extent of stating that the directions issued by the learned Single Judge shall not be
understood as directing regularization of GVPs/MFFs (Micro Feeder Franchisees) in sanctioned
posts to which they may not be qualified as per the Recruitment Rules. However, we are of the
opinion that the State is duty bound to consider the recommendations of the High Level Committee
and to frame a proper scheme for fair wages and proper working conditions of GVPs engaged
pursuant to its policies. The question whether the contract employees have the eligibility to be
continued as against the existing posts since they were admittedly carrying out the statutory duties
assigned to them shall also be specifically considered. The needful shall be done by the State
Government within four months from the date of receipt of a copy of this Judgment. The order of
the learned Single Judge is sustained in all other aspects.
28. Writ Appeals are ordered accordingly. Pending IAs, if any, in all the appeals shall stand disposed
of.
