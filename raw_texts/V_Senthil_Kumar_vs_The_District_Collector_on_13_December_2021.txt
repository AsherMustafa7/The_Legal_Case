COMMON ORDER
W.P.(MD)No.20398 of 2021 had been filed in the nature of Certiorarified Mandamus relating to the
issuance of Tender-cum-Public Notification, dated 13.10.2021, which notification had been issued
pursuant to resolution Nos.272nd and 273rd Dindigul Municipal Corporation and by which
notification, bids were invited for lease of shops and for pay and use toilet at Gandhi Market and
Kamarajar Bus Terminal at Dindigul and to interfere with the said notification and for a direction to
issue No Due Certificate to enable the petitioner to participate in the tender process.
2.W.P.(MD)No.20437 of 2021 had also been filed for https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.(MD)Nos.20398, 20437 and 20512 of 2021 Certiorarified Mandamus with respect to a notice,
dated Nil, on the file of the respondent/Commissioner, Dindigul Municipal Corporation and to
quash the same and in the alternate, to direct the respondent to issue No Objection Certificate and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/24211242/ 3
V.Senthil Kumar vs The District Collector on 13 December, 2021
to accept the tender/application for auction from the petitioner.
3.W.P.(MD)No.20512 of 2021 had been filed in the nature of Certiorarified Mandamus again
relating to the very same Tender-cum- Public Notification, dated 13.10.2021, and to quash the same
and also to direct the respondents to issue No Objection Certificate to enable the petitioner to
participate in the tender process.
4.A reading of the reliefs sought would indicate that the three petitioners seek interference with a
notification, which had been issued by the Dindigul Corporation for lease-cum-tender of shops and
pay and use toilet. In the same breath, the petitioners also claim that they must be granted No
Objection Certificate to enable them to participate in the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.(MD)Nos.20398, 20437 and 20512 of 2021 auction. It is thus seen that they have sought a
relief, which cannot be granted in entirety. Either the notifications are interfered by this Court or the
petitioners are granted the alternate, namely, No Objection Certificates to participate in the auction
process.
5.Be that as it may, in the affidavit filed in support of W.P.(MD)No. 20398 of 2021, the Writ
Petitioner had alleged that there should be interference by stating that the Tender-cum-Public
Notification, dated 13.10.2021 had not been affixed in the notice board of the Dindigul Municipal
Corporation and it was also not notified in the news papers having circulation in Dindigul. It was
claimed that these are violations of the provisions of Tamil Nadu Transparency in Tenders Act,
1998. It was further claimed that the respondent by this particular act, had turned the clock back to
the feudal days.
6.The petitioner had, however, obtained a copy of the notification. He had given a representation to
the Commissioner of Dindigul https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.(MD)Nos.20398, 20437 and
20512 of 2021 Municipal Corporation, to issue a No Objection Certificate or No Due Certificate to
participate in the tender process. He claimed that it was not provided to him and further stated that
this was to eliminate him from participating in the tender process.
7.He had also enlightened the Court by quoting the provisions of Tamil Nadu Transparency in
Tenders Act, 1998, and Rules thereof, in his affidavit. Claiming that the notification had been issued
in violation of the aforesaid provision, and at the same time, also claiming that he wants to
participate in the notification, even though the entire process was, according to him, in violation of
the aforesaid provisions the Writ Petition has been filed.
8.In the affidavit filed in support of W.P.(MD)No.20437 of 2021, the Writ Petitioner had stated that
he was a Councillor in Dindigul Municipal Corporation and was not due in payment of property tax
or any other charge. He had also enlightened the Court the fact that the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.(MD)Nos.20398, 20437 and 20512 of 2021 Dindigul
Municipal Corporation had adopted the provisions of Coimbatore City Municipal Corporation Act,
1981, as its guidelines. He had further stated that the Corporation had constructed 34 shops in
Dindigul Kamarajar Bus Terminal and that the petitioner was very much interested in taking any
one of the shops for lease.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/24211242/ 4
V.Senthil Kumar vs The District Collector on 13 December, 2021
9.He came to know from his friends on 10.11.2021 that secret arrangements have been made to
auction the shop to a certain syndicate and to exclude others. He did not find any publication in
newspapers having circulation in Dindigul regarding the auction process. He rushed to the office of
the respondent. He claimed that he had to struggle and to fight to get a copy of the notification. He
also pointed out a contradiction in the notification with respect to the time when it should be
submitted and with respect to obtaining No Objection Certificate by paying Rs. 5,000/- and that the
No Objection Certificate should be obtained three days prior.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.(MD)Nos.20398, 20437 and 20512 of 2021
10.He had, however, reconciled himself to participate in the auction and obtained two Demand
Drafts for Rs.5,00,000/- for that purpose. He claimed that he went back to the office of the
respondent on 11.11.2021 at 02.45 pm and struggled till 05.00 pm to get No Objection Certificate. At
05.00 pm, he rushed back to the office of his Advocate and filed the Writ Petition.
11.In the affidavit filed in support of W.P.(MD)No.20512 of 2021, the Writ Petitioner stated that he
intended to participate and place his bids in response to a tender-cum-public notification issued by
the second respondent/Dindigul Municipal Corporation, which was dated 13.10.2021. He further
claimed that the notification was bereft of mandatory details, such as, where the tender documents
could be obtained, the amount of application fees, the last date and time for submitting the bids, the
date and time when the bids would be opened, the amount of Earnest Money Deposit to be paid and
therefore, claimed that the entire notification was in violation of Rule 10 of the Tamil Nadu
Transparency in Tenders Rules, 2000.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.(MD)Nos.20398, 20437 and 20512 of 2021
12.It was also claimed that the notification was not published in regional newspapers and was not
affixed in the notice board. It was not put on public notice or notified in the website of Dindigul
Municipal Corporation. He claimed that the notice was in violation of Section 9 of Tamil Nadu
Transparency in Tenders Act, 1998. He also claimed that it was in violation of Rules 15 and 16 of
Tamil Nadu Transparency in Tender Rules, 2000.
13.He also stated that he had made a representation to the second respondent to issue No Objection
Certificate/No Due Certificate but there was no response from the second respondent. He had
therefore filed the Writ Petition seeking the relief as stated above.
14.Even before entering into the contention of the respondents, one fact will have to be clarified at
the first instance itself. That is with respect to the claim of the Writ Petitioner in
W.P.(MD)No.20437 of 2021, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.(MD)Nos.20398, 20437 and
20512 of 2021 who alone had stated that he had also purchased two demand drafts for
Rs.5,00,000/- for participating in the tender process.
15.In the documents filed by the respondents, the details with respect to the said two demand drafts
had also been filed and it is seen that one of the demand drafts was actually used by one
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/24211242/ 5
V.Senthil Kumar vs The District Collector on 13 December, 2021
Veeramarban, who is a stranger and had independently purchased the same to participate in the
auction and the other was used by one N.Pandeeswaran for similar purpose. The statement of the
petitioner that he had purchased the demand drafts is evidently false to the knowledge of the
petitioner. I am deeply pained to note that a brazen falsity has been stated before the Court. On this
one ground alone, the Writ Petition should be rejected. However, let me examine the points raised
in deference to the arguments advanced during the course of hearing.
16.Counter affidavits were also filed. In the counter affidavit filed by the second respondent, the
Commissioner of Dindigul Municipal https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.(MD)Nos.20398,
20437 and 20512 of 2021 Corporation, after denying the averments stated in the affidavits filed in
support these Writ Petitions, it had been stated that the notification for the tender process was given
wide publicity by affixing copies of the notification at prominent places of the Corporation office,
Main gate and Kamarajar Bus Stand Premises, to enable the public to take part in the tender
process. It was also stated that the notification was also published in the Tamil Daily, “Dinakural”,
by the first respondent on 29.10.2021. It had been further stated that many applicants applied for
the tender documents and also received the same.
17.With respect to the averments made in the affidavit that No Due Certificate had not been granted,
it had been very specifically stated in the counter affidavit that details as to the officials whom the
Writ Petitioners approached for receipt of No Due Certificate had not been given. It had also been
stated that all the necessary guidelines have been followed. It had been further stated that on
12.11.2021, the Commissioner, Dindigul Municipal Corporation, was present in his office till 12.30
pm. Since complaints were received regarding water https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.(MD)Nos.20398, 20437 and 20512 of 2021 logging in various places from the general public,
the Commissioner had to leave the office to monitor the draining of rain water. He came back to the
office in the evening hours.
18.It was further stated that by office order, dated 19.07.2021, the Assistant Revenue Officer of the
Corporation, had been authorised to do certain duties of the Commissioner, including the matters
pertaining to lease. It had been stated that the said provisions had been mentioned in the
notification itself. He had also issued a note order in the name of Assistant Revenue Officer with
respect to the tender notification. Resolution had been earlier passed on 13.10.2021 to bring the 32
shops in Gandhi Maidan Market Complex for public auction/tender. The notifications were also
affixed in all the places in Corporation Office, bus stand premises and market premises.
19.It had also been stated that the second respondent requested the Information and Public Relation
Officer, Dindigul to publish the tender https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.(MD)Nos.20398,
20437 and 20512 of 2021 notification in Tamil Dailies and they were also published on 29.10.2021.
It was also stated that for 32 shops, 86 sealed covers were received from intending auction bidders.
It had been further stated that it was not the case of the Writ Petitioners that they have made
payment of Rs.5,000/- in the respondent Office to get No Objection Certificate. The Writ Petitioners
have not produced any proof to support this allegation. It had been stated that on 12.11.2021, the
officials of the second respondent made efforts to reach out the Writ Petitioners. But, there was no
response. It had also been stated that the tender notification was not uploaded in the website of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/24211242/ 6
V.Senthil Kumar vs The District Collector on 13 December, 2021
respondent Corporation, since there were no proper facilities available in this regard.
20.Separate counter affidavits were also filed with respect to other Writ Petitions and the same
aspects had also been stated in the counter affidavit and additional affidavit had also been filed by
Commissioner, Dindigul Municipal Corporation, stating very specifically that the Writ Petitioners
did not come forward to obtain the No Objection Certificate by making the payment of Rs.5,000/-.
With respect to the averments https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.(MD)Nos.20398, 20437 and
20512 of 2021 made in W.P.(MD)No.20437 of 2021, it had been stated that the two demand drafts
mentioned by said Writ Petitioner relate to one N.Pandeeswaran and one Veeramarban. Similarly,
one Manikandan had also submitted a tender application by enclosing the demand drafts.
Therefore, it had been stated that the petitioners had come to Court with false allegations and had
actually produced documents, which did not relate to him. It had been stated that the named
persons could not succeed in the tender process and they had taken away the demand drafts from
the second respondent and the copies of those demand drafts had been used by the Writ Petitioner
claiming that he had purchased the said demand drafts. As a matter of fact, he had not done so. It
had been further stated that the Writ Petitioner had come to Court with false statements.
21.Reply affidavit and additional affidavits were also filed by the Writ Petitioners. In the reply
affidavit in W.P.(MD)No.20398 of 2021, it had been stated that the news paper, “Dinakuaral” did
not have any circulation in Dindigul. It had been stated that the petitioner was informed that the
publication was actually in Tamil Daily https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.(MD)Nos.20398,
20437 and 20512 of 2021 “Malaichudhar”. It had been further stated that the respondents
themselves did not know the news paper in which publication was made. It had also been stated that
the delegation of powers, as stated by the second respondent, was not proper and there was no such
authority to delegate the powers. The statement that 86 sealed tenders were also received was also
questioned and disputed by the Writ Petitioner. It had been stated that since the Writ Petition was
pending, the Writ Petitioner had opted not to participate in the auction. It had been reiterated that
notification had not been put up on the website.
22.An additional affidavit was also filed, wherein, it had been stated that the second respondent was
present in Office at 12.30 pm on 12.11.2021 and thereafter, suddenly left. This was with respect to
the statement made by the second respondent that he had left office, since complaints were received
about the water logging from the general public. The Writ Petitioners reiterated that the Writ
Petitions should be allowed, while the respondents contended that the Writ Petitions should be
dismissed.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.(MD)Nos.20398, 20437 and 20512 of 2021
23.Heard arguments advanced by Mr.S.R.Rajagopal and Mr.G.Prabhu Rajadurai, learned Counsels
for the petitioner and Mr.Veerakathiravan, learned Additional Advocate General appearing for the
respondents.
24.The learned Counsels for the petitioners contended that the entire notification had not been
given due publicity, as is required, under the Tamil Nadu Transparency in Tenders Act, 1998. They
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/24211242/ 7
V.Senthil Kumar vs The District Collector on 13 December, 2021
stated that the notification had not been published in the website and it had not been published in
the local daily, as is required. They also stated that though the Writ Petitioners desired to participate
in the tender auction, they were not given No Due Certificate, even though they were ready to pay a
sum of Rs.5,000/- for such certificate. The Writ Petitioner in W.P.(MD)No. 20437 of 2021 also
contended that he had also purchased two demand drafts for a sum of Rs.5,00,000/- as earnest
money deposit for participating in the tender process, but was not permitted to participate. In fact,
the learned Counsels contended that this Court should interfere https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.(MD)Nos.20398, 20437 and 20512 of 2021 with the tender process owing to the fact that there
has been violation of rules governing issuance of such tenders.
25.The learned Additional Advocate General, on the other hand, seriously disputed all these facts
and contended that publication was made by the first respondent/District Collector in Dinakural on
29.10.2021. He also stated that the notification was affixed in prominent premises including the
office of the respondent, public bus stand and such other places and there has been good response
from the general public for participating in the tender process. It was also contended by the learned
Additional Advocate General that the respondents had never denied the issuance of No Due
Certificate, but, it was only the petitioners, who did not come forward to pay Rs.5,000/- to obtain
No Objection Certificate.
26.With respect to the specific contention of the Writ Petitioner in W.P.(MD)No.20437 of 2021 that
he had purchased two demand drafts, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.(MD)Nos.20398,
20437 and 20512 of 2021 the learned Additional Advocate General stated that those demand drafts
relate to two other unrelated persons, who were not successful in the tender process and therefore,
those two demand drafts have been used by the Writ Petitioner and the same were also filed as
documents in Court. The learned Additional Advocate General also stated that there was no
provision to put up the notification in the web site and finally contended that the Writ Petitioners
were not at all interested in participating in the tender process, but only in derailing the entire
process. He contended specifically that auction had been conducted, but results have not been
declared in deference to the directions of this Court.
27.I have given careful consideration to the arguments advanced on either side and the documents
available on record.
28.W.P.(MD)No.20398 of 2021 came up for consideration on 15.11.2021. On that date, it was
contended by the learned Counsel for the petitioner that a representation had been given by the Writ
Petitioner on https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.(MD)Nos.20398, 20437 and 20512 of 2021
09.11.2021. It was disputed by the learned Additional Advocate General. It had been informed on
that date that auction had been scheduled on 12.11.2021 and a representation had been made
seeking to move the Writ Petition as a lunch motion. The petitioner had been given permission to
participate in the auction process. It was informed that if the petitioner was willing to actually
participate in the auction process, then he can approach the respondent and they would give No
Objection Certificate to the petitioner herein on making Rs.5,000/- as is required under the Rules.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/24211242/ 8
V.Senthil Kumar vs The District Collector on 13 December, 2021
29.There has been a very specific statement made by the respondent, and as a matter of fact, records
of telephone calls have been given, indicating that the respondent had tried to contact the Writ
Petitioner. They had not responded and they did not actually obtain a No Objection Certificate. In
fact, the Writ Petitioners, though given an opportunity by this Court to participate in the auction
process had actually not participated in the process.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.(MD)Nos.20398, 20437 and 20512 of 2021
30.It must also be stated that one of the Writ Petitioners, namely, the Writ Petitioner in
W.P.(MD)No.20437 of 2021, had stated that apart from Rs.5,000/- towards No Objection
Certificate, he had also purchased two demand drafts for Rs.5,00,000/-, with specific intention to
participate in the auction, but was prevented from participating. This statement by the Writ
Petitioner has been found to be false in view of the documents produced by the respondent showing
that the demand drafts mentioned by the petitioner actually related to two unknown strangers
N.Pandeeswaran and Veeramarban, who had independently purchased those demand drafts and
had also participated in the auction, but since their bids were not sufficient, they had taken back the
demand drafts and the Writ Petitioner had used those Demand Drafts. The copies of those demand
drafts have been filed as documents by the petitioner as if he had purchased the said demand drafts.
Any individual, who approaches a Court with false documents, as its basis, can never expect relief
from the Court.
31.Be that as it may, the fundamental premise, on which the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.(MD)Nos.20398, 20437 and 20512 of 2021 petitioners rested their case, was that the
notification was not given due publicity. This was denied by the respondents, who also produced
documents to show that the notification had been put up at authorised places. The Writ Petitioners
have not contended that they were totally unaware of the notification process. They were aware of
the notification process. They deliberately did not come over to obtain No Objection Certificate, but
delayed till the last minute claiming that notification was not put up in the website. It is contended
by the respondent that there was no website for the Corporation. These are all facts, which can never
be determined by this Court.
32.In (2007) 14 SCC 517 in the case of Jagdish Mandal vs State of Orissa and others, the Honourable
Supreme Court had very clearly stated as follows:
“22.Judicial review of administrative action is intended to prevent arbitrariness,
irrationality, unreasonableness, bias and mala fides. Its purpose is to check whether
choice or decision is made “lawfully” and not to check whether choice or decision is
“sound”. When the power of judicial review is invoked in matters relating to tenders
or award of contracts, certain special features should be borne in mind. A contract is
a commercial transaction.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.(MD)Nos.20398, 20437 and 20512 of 2021
Evaluating tenders and awarding contracts are essentially commercial functions.
Principles of equity and natural justice stay at a distance. If the decision relating to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/24211242/ 9
V.Senthil Kumar vs The District Collector on 13 December, 2021
award of contract is bona fide and is in public interest, courts will not, in exercise of
power of judicial review, interfere even if a procedural aberration or error in
assessment or prejudice to a tenderer, is made out. The power of judicial review will
not be permitted to be invoked to protect private interest at the cost of public
interest, or to decide contractual disputes. The tenderer or contractor with a
grievance can always seek damages in a civil court. Attempts by unsuccessful
tenderers with imaginary grievances, wounded pride and business rivalry, to make
mountains out of molehills of some technical/procedural violation or some prejudice
to self, and persuade courts to interfere by exercising power of judicial review, should
be resisted. Such interferences, either interim or final, may hold up public works for
years, or delay relief and succour to thousands and millions and may increase the
project cost manifold. Therefore, a court before interfering in tender or contractual
matters in exercise of power of judicial review, should pose to itself the following
questions:
(i) Whether the process adopted or decision made by the authority is mala fide or
intended to favour someone;
or Whether the process adopted or decision made is so arbitrary and irrational that the court can
say: “the decision is such that no responsible authority acting reasonably and in accordance with
relevant law could have reached”;
(ii) Whether public interest is affected.
If the answers are in the negative, there should be no interference under Article 226. Cases involving
blacklisting or imposition of penal consequences on a tenderer/contractor or distribution of State
largesse (allotment of sites/shops, grant of licences, dealerships and franchises) stand on a different
footing as they may require a higher degree of fairness in action.” https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.(MD)Nos.20398, 20437 and 20512 of 2021
33.In the instance case, it is not the case of the petitioners that the process adopted was intended to
favour select persons alone. It is seen that 86 applicants participated in the auction for 32 shops.
The choice was not limited to one single individual. The participants had all participated on equal
footing. None of them had approached this Court. It is, therefore, very clear that the process adopted
by the authorities cannot be faulted by stating that it was to benefit only some specific individual or
group of persons.
34.Further, while examining whether public interest was affected, it has to be held that the answer
should be in the negative, since there has been general participation of the public in the auction
process. The very fact that the shops were auctioned indicated that the respondent had taken care of
public interest to generate income for the second respondent. I, therefore, hold that while examining
the two questions as stated in the judgment referred to above, the answer is an emphatic “No”.

V.Senthil Kumar vs The District Collector on 13 December, 2021
35.In 2021 SCC Online SC 738, in the case of Uflex Limited vs Government of Tamil Nadu and
others, the Honourable Supreme Court had held as follows:
“6.The burgeoning litigation in this field and the same being carried to this Court in
most matters was the cause we set forth an epilogue in Caretel Infotech Ltd. v.
Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited Even if it amounts to repetition, we
believe that it needs to be emphasized in view of the controversy arising in the
present case to appreciate the contours within which the factual matrix of the present
case has to be analysed and tested.
“37. We consider it appropriate to make certain observations in the context of the
nature of dispute which is before us. Normally parties would be governed by their
contracts and the tender terms, and really no writ would be maintainable under
Article 226 of the Constitution of India. In view of Government and public sector
enterprises venturing into economic activities, this Court found it appropriate to
build in certain checks and balances of fairness in procedure. It is this approach
which has given rise to scrutiny of tenders in writ proceedings under Article 226 of
the Constitution of India. It, however, appears that the window has been opened too
wide as almost every small or big tender is now sought to be challenged in writ
proceedings almost as a matter of routine. This in turn, affects the efficacy of
commercial activities of the public sectors, which may be in competition with the
private sector.
This could hardly have been the objective in mind. An unnecessary, close scrutiny of minute details,
contrary to the view of the tendering authority, makes awarding of contracts by Government and
Public Sectors a cumbersome exercise, with long drawn out litigation at the threshold. The private
sector is competing often in the same field. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.(MD)Nos.20398,
20437 and 20512 of 2021 Promptness and efficiency levels in private contracts, thus, often tend to
make the tenders of the public sector a non- competitive exercise. This works to a great
disadvantage to the Government and the public sector.
38. In Afcons Infrastructure Limited v. Nagpur Metro Rail Corporation Limited, this Court has
expounded further on this aspect, while observing that the decision- making process in accepting or
rejecting the bid should not be interfered with. Interference is permissible only if the
decision-making process is arbitrary or irrational to an extent that no responsible authority, acting
reasonably and in accordance with law, could have reached such a decision. It has been cautioned
that Constitutional Courts are expected to exercise restraint in interfering with the administrative
decision and ought not to substitute their view for that of the administrative authority. Mere
disagreement with the decision-making process would not suffice.
39. Another aspect emphasised is that the author of the document is the best person to understand
and appreciate its requirements. In the facts of the present case, the view, on interpreting the tender
documents, of Respondent No. 1 must prevail. Respondent No. 1 itself, appreciative of the wording
of Clause 20 and the format, has taken a considered view. Respondent No. 3 cannot compel its own
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/24211242/ 11
V.Senthil Kumar vs The District Collector on 13 December, 2021
interpretation of the contract to be thrust on Respondent No. 1, or ask the Court to compel
Respondent No. 1 to accept that interpretation. In fact, the Court went on to observe in the aforesaid
judgment that it is possible that the author of the tender may give an interpretation that is not
acceptable to the constitutional Court, but that itself would not be a reason for interfering with the
interpretation given. We reproduce the observations in this behalf as under:
“15. We may add that the owner or the employer of a project, having authored the
tender documents, is the best https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.(MD)Nos.20398, 20437 and 20512 of 2021 person to understand and appreciate
its requirements and interpret its documents. The constitutional courts must defer to
this understanding and appreciation of the tender documents, unless there is mala
fide or perversity in the understanding or appreciation or in the application of the
terms of the tender conditions. It is possible that the owner or employer of a project
may give an interpretation to the tender documents that is not acceptable to the
constitutional courts but that by itself is not a reason for interfering with the
interpretation given.”
40. We may also refer to the judgment of this Court in Nabha Power Limited (NPL) v. Punjab State
Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL), authored by one of us (Sanjay Kishan Kaul, J.). The legal
principles for interpretation of commercial contracts have been discussed. In the said judgment, a
reference was made to the observations of the Privy Council in Attorney General of Belize v. Belize
Telecom Ltd.as under:
“45. … 16. Before discussing in greater detail the reasoning of the Court of Appeal, the
Board will make some general observations about the process of implication. The
court has no power to improve upon the instrument which it is called upon to
construe, whether it be a contract, a statute or articles of association. It cannot
introduce terms to make it fairer or more reasonable. It is concerned only to discover
what the instrument means. However, that meaning is not necessarily or always what
the authors or parties to the document would have intended. …” ……… “19. …..In
Trollope & Colls Ltd. v. North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board9 Lord
Pearson, with whom Lord Guest and Lord Diplock agreed, said:
“…the court does not make a contract for the parties. The court will not even improve
the contract which the parties have made for themselves, however desirable the
improvement might be. The court's function is to interpret
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.(MD)Nos.20398, 20437 and 20512 of 2021
and apply the contract which the parties have made for themselves. If the express
terms are perfectly clear and free from ambiguity, there is no choice to be made
between different possible meanings : the clear terms must be applied even if the
court thinks some other terms would have been more suitable. An unexpressed term
can be implied if and only if the court finds that the parties must have intended that
term to form part of their contract : it is not enough for the court to find that such a
term would have been adopted by the parties as reasonable men if it had been
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/24211242/ 12
V.Senthil Kumar vs The District Collector on 13 December, 2021
suggested to them : it must have been a term that went without saying, a term
necessary to give business efficacy to the contract, a term which, though tacit, formed
part of the contract which the parties made for themselves.”
41. Nabha Power Limited (NPL) also took note of the earlier judgment of this court in Satya Jain v.
Anis Ahmed Rushdie, which discussed the principle of business efficacy as proposed by Bowen, L.J.
in the Moorcock. It has been elucidated that this test requires that terms can be implied only if it is
necessary to give business efficacy to the contract to avoid failure of the contract and only the bare
minimum of implication is to be there to achieve this goal. Thus, if the contract makes business
sense without the implication of terms, the courts will not imply the same.
42. The judgment in Nabha Power Limited concluded with the following observations in para 72:
“72. We may, however, in the end, extend a word of caution. It should certainly not be
an endeavour of commercial courts to look to implied terms of contract. In the
current day and age, making of contracts is a matter of high technical expertise with
legal brains from all sides involved in the process of drafting a contract. It is even
preceded by opportunities of seeking clarifications and doubts so that the parties
know what they are getting into. Thus, normally a contract should be read as it reads,
as per its express terms. The implied terms is a concept, which is
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.(MD)Nos.20398, 20437 and 20512 of 2021
necessitated only when the Penta-test referred to aforesaid comes into play. There
has to be a strict necessity for it. In the present case, we have really only read the
contract in the manner it reads. We have not really read into it any ‘implied term’ but
from the collection of clauses, come to a conclusion as to what the contract says. The
formula for energy charges, to our mind, was quite clear. We have only expounded it
in accordance to its natural grammatical contour, keeping in mind the nature of the
contract.”
43. We have considered it appropriate to, once again, emphasise the aforesaid aspects, especially in
the context of endeavours of courts to give their own interpretation to contracts, more specifically
tender terms, at the behest of a third party competing for the tender, rather than what is
propounded by the party framing the tender. The object cannot be that in every contract, where
some parties would lose out, they should get the opportunity to somehow pick holes, to disqualify
the successful parties, on grounds on which even the party floating the tender finds no merit.”14
7. It may also be pertinent to note the principles elucidated in the case of Tata Cellular v. Union of
India:
“94. The principles deducible from the above are:
(1) The modern trend points to judicial restraint in administrative action.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/24211242/ 13
V.Senthil Kumar vs The District Collector on 13 December, 2021
(2) The court does not sit as a court of appeal but merely reviews the manner in
which the decision was made.
(3) The court does not have the expertise to correct the administrative decision. If a
review of the administrative decision is permitted it will be substituting its own
decision, without the necessary expertise which itself may be fallible.
(4) The terms of the invitation to tender cannot be open to judicial scrutiny because
the invitation to tender is in the realm of contract. Normally speaking, the decision to
accept the tender or award the contract is reached by process of negotiations through
several tiers. More often https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.(MD)Nos.20398,
20437 and 20512 of 2021 than not, such decisions are made qualitatively by experts.
(5) The Government must have freedom of contract.
In other words, a fair play in the joints is a necessary concomitant for an administrative body
functioning in an administrative sphere or quasi-administrative sphere. However, the decision must
not only be tested by the application of Wednesbury principle of reasonableness (including its other
facts pointed out above) but must be free from arbitrariness not affected by bias or actuated by mala
fides.
(6) Quashing decisions may impose heavy administrative burden on the administration and lead to
increased and unbudgeted expenditure.” ......
42. We must begin by noticing that we are examining the case, as already stated above, on the
parameters discussed at the inception. In commercial tender matters there is obviously an aspect of
commercial competitiveness. For every succeeding party who gets a tender there may be a couple or
more parties who are not awarded the tender as there can be only one L-1. The question is should
the judicial process be resorted to for down playing the freedom which a tendering party has, merely
because it is a State or a public authority, making the said process even more cumbersome. We have
already noted that element of transparency is always required in such tenders because of the nature
of economic activity carried on by the State, but the contours under which they are to be examined
are restricted as set out in Tata Cellular and other cases. The objective is not to make the Court an
appellate authority for scrutinizing as to whom the tender should be awarded. Economics must be
permitted to play its role for which the tendering authority knows best as to what is suited in terms
of technology and price for them.” https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.(MD)Nos.20398, 20437
and 20512 of 2021
36.The learned Counsel for the petitioner relied on the judgment of a learned Single Judge of this
Court in W.P.No.14981 of 2016, in the case of P.Srinivassan, vs the Commissioner, Dharmapuri
Municipality, wherein, the learned Single Judge, while examining the case of the Writ Petitioner
therein, who had participated in a tender and sought a direction against the respondent therein to
conduct the process in a transparent manner by following the provisions of Tamil Nadu
Transparency in Tenders Act, 1998 and the Rules framed therein, had stated that when the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/24211242/ 14
V.Senthil Kumar vs The District Collector on 13 December, 2021
respondent proposed to conduct process, it has to issue fresh notification by following the
provisions of Tamil Nadu Transparency of Tenders Act, 1998. This order was relied upon by the
learned Counsel for the petitioner to point that the lease of shops is also covered by the Tamil Nadu
Transparency of Tenders Act, 1998.
37.The learned Additional Advocate General, however, relied upon a judgment of this Court
reported in 2005 (1) CTC 81, in the case of S.Selvakumar Vs the Commissioner, Karaikudi, wherein,
it had been held as follows:
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.(MD)Nos.20398, 20437 and 20512 of 2021
“13. Apart from what is stated above, we are of the opinion that The Tamil Nadu
Transparency in Tenders Act, 1998, may not be applicable to the facts of the present
case, because the word "Procurement" in the afore said Act has been defined in
Section 2(d) as follows:
" 'Procurement' means acquisition by any means by purchase of goods or services and
also of construction."
We are at a loss to understand as to how the right to collect rent from the road-side vendors can be
said to be a 'procurement' as defined in aforesaid Act. The said right is neither purchase of goods nor
of services.” This judgment was specifically followed by the Division Bench of Court in
W.P.(MD)No.15462 of 2021, dated 27.08.2021. in D.Sreedhar vs the Commissioner, Corporation of
Madurai and others.
38.In (2021) 2 MLJ 325, in the case of State of Tamil Nadu and another vs M.Kandan, a Division
Bench of this Court held as follows:
“11. The four grounds that found favour with the learned Single Judge pale into
insignificance in the backdrop of the writ petitioner having to be regarded merely as a
prospective participant who otherwise appears not to have participated in the
process. In the absence of the writ petitioner establishing that the writ petitioner was
denied access to the tender papers or an opportunity to participate in the process, the
writ petitioner must necessarily be regarded as not having participated in the
process. The writ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.(MD)Nos.20398, 20437 and
20512 of 2021 petitioner was well within his rights not to participate in the process
and rest on his principled stand that the process was illegal. But the very basis of the
action was that the writ petitioner could not participate in the tender process. When
the writ petitioner could not affirmatively demonstrate that he had been denied
access to the tender documents, the Court could not have ruled in favour of the writ
petitioner. The other grounds asserted appear to run contrary to the underlying basis
for the writ petitioner bringing the action. On the one hand, the writ petitioner
wanted to participate in the process, yet the writ petitioner found that the entire
process was illegal and could not have been sustained.”
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/24211242/ 15
V.Senthil Kumar vs The District Collector on 13 December, 2021
39.Even in this case, the Writ Petitioners, who contended that they wanted to participate the tender
process, had approached this Court to get No Objection Certificate and this Court had directed them
to approach the respondents to get No Objection Certificate and had also directed the respondents
to give No Objection Certificate provided the petitioners pay a sum of Rs.5,000/-. The petitioners
never took any effort to approach the respondents, even though the officials had contacted the Writ
Petitioners. I hold that the Writ Petitioners only want to put spokes in the auction process. The
allegation that proper publicity was not given cannot be countenanced, since notification had been
affixed at various places and on the very fact that the general public had participated in the tender
process. The statement of the respondent that there was no website for
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.(MD)Nos.20398, 20437 and 20512 of 2021 putting up
advertisements online can never be tested in Writ proceedings. This statement on oath is pitted
against another statement on oath. A definite finding can never be given. The Writ Petitioner could
have taken resort to the inbuilt appeal procedure in the Act, if they had wanted to establish facts. It
is a fact that the notification was published in Dinakural News Paper. Therefore, I hold that the
respondents have, to the extent possible, given wide publicity for the notification.
40.The issue of delegation of powers cannot be questioned by the petitioners, since the second
respondent had only exercised existing powers vested in him in that regard. The second respondent
had stated on affidavit that he was called over to attend complaints of water logging and therefore,
had delegated the power to a competent official. These are facts, which stare on the face of the
petitioners.
41.Primarily, the very fact that one of the petitioners had approached the Court with documents,
which were false to the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.(MD)Nos.20398, 20437 and 20512 of
2021 knowledge of the said petitioner, is alone sufficient to dismiss the Writ Petitions. The Writ
Petitions are misconceived.
42.The Writ Petitions are, therefore, dismissed. No costs. Consequently, connected miscellaneous
petitions are closed.
43. The respondents are permitted to declare the results of the auction.
