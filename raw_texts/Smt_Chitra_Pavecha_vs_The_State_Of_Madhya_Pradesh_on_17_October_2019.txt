Indore, Dated : 17-10-2019
Shri Vinay Saraf, learned Sr. Counsel with Shri Rizwan Khan,, Shri
Adiya Garg, Shri Sandeep Kochatta and Shri Hemendra Jain learned counsel
for the petitioner.
Shri Ravindra Chabbra, learned Additional Advocate General with Shri
Akshat Pahadia, learned Govt. Advocate for the respondent no.1 to 3/State.
Shri Y.K. Mittal and Shri Sudarshan Joshi, learned counsel for the respondent no.4.
This batch of 43 writ petitions is before this Court at the instance of land owners allegedly falling
under the Scheme No. 165 floated in the year 2006 and finalized in the year 2007 by the IDA.
Parcels of lands in these cases were initially part of a development scheme finalized in the year 1989
by the IDA. With the passage of time, it has elapsed. Thereafter, a new scheme was formulated and
finalized in the year 2007 known as Scheme No. 165.
During the course of hearing, it has transpired that notification under Section 4(1) of the Land
Acquisition Act 1984 (for short 'the Act of 1984')was issued on 22.11.2011 and notification under
Section 6 of the Act of 1984 was issued on 19.11.2012. Thereafter, award was passed on 14.11.2014
allegedly under the Land Acquisition Act, 2013[for short 'the 2013 Act']. However, neither
possession has been taken from the petitioners nor compensation has been paid.
Shri Saraf, learned Sr. counsel leading the arguments submits that not 2 WP-1940-2015 only mere
parcels of lands, but also houses constructed thereupon have been sought to be included in the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/11788432/ 1
Smt. Chitra Pavecha vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 17 October, 2019
development scheme contrary to the provisions of M.P. Nagar Tatha Gram Nivesh Adhiniyam &
Niyam, 1973( for short 'the Act of 1973). Moreover, the alleged award is not in conformity with the
provisions of the 2013 Act, particularly in the matter of computation and finalization of the amount
of compensation in terms of Section 24 (1)(a) of the new Act of 2013.
Learned Sr. counsel further submits that in terms of Section 77 of 2013 Act, the Collector has neither
tendered payment of compensation awarded by him to persons interested and entitled thereto
according to the award including petitioners, nor deposited in their bank accounts. Admittedly,
petitioners continued to be in possession of the lands.
Shri Mittal and Shri Joshi, learned counsel for IDA do not dispute the same.
Shri Saraf referring to the order passed by this Court on the last date of hearing i.e. 01.10.2019
submits that IDA in its latest communication to the State Government on 19.07.2019 has made it
apt clear that total amount of compensation of Rs. 4125.30 crores for acquiring an area of 150.23
hectares shall be required and it shall not be possible for the IDA to raise loan for the huge equired
amount for implementation of the scheme, unless the State Government makes available the
determined amount of compensation.
It is further submitted that this Court had called upon the respondent/State to seek instructions
from the State Government on the proposal of the IDA and cased have been posted today for orders.
Unfortunately, there is no response from the State Government in that behalf. Therefore, this Court
may proceed to hear the petitions on merit.
Shri Chabbra, learned Additional Advocate General passed on board and taken on record, the
affidavit of Mr. Sanjay Dubey, Principal Secretary, Urban Development and Housing Department,
Vallabh Bhavan, Bhopal dated 14.10.2019 sworn purportedly in compliance of the order dated
01.10.2019.
3 WP-1940-2015 Before commenting upon the affidavit, it is considered apposite to observe that on
01.07.2019, this Court by a detailed order had sought response of the State Government on the
proposal of the IDA forwarded to the State Government on 04.10.2018 as referred earlier. The
affidavit dated 29.07.2019 was filed by the same officer stating on oath that a new policy is being
formulated to address the questions involved in these writ petitions. The same shall help facilitate
disposal of writ petitions. Thereafter on the next date of hearing i.e. on 01.10.2019, another affidavit
of the same officer was shown during the course of hearing on 01.10.2019, but actually filed on
04.10.2019 whereunder, it is stated that the formulation of policy shall not be possible unless M.P.
Town and Country Planning Act, 1973 is amended and in para 5 and 6 of the of said affidavit, it is
stated that draft amendment after consideration by Director, Town and Country Planning
Department is sent to the Principal Secretary, Urban Development and Housing Department.
Whereafter, meeting was also held with the officials of Directorate of Town and Country planning on
23.09.2019 and eventually the draft amendment has been sent to the Minister, Urban Development
and Housing for administrative approval on 24.09.2019.

Smt. Chitra Pavecha vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 17 October, 2019
This Court has carefully perused the affidavit passed on Board today and taken on record. The
affidavit is said to be in compliance of the order passed by this Court on 01.10.2019. However, the
same on its face is not in compliance of the order so passed on 01.10.2019 as there is no response to
the proposal of the IDA dated 04.10.2018 and 19.07.2019 referred to in previous ordersheets(supra).
The Officer appears to harbour a notion that he can afford to avoid compliance of the Court orders
and keep on changing his stand by filing successive affidavits without understanding that such
recourse adopted by him may invite serious action against him. Even in this affidavit, vague and
evasive statements are made regarding the procedure to be adopted in the matter of carrying out
amendment in the Act. In fact, it is even worst than the second affidavit whereunder he had
disclosed a draft 4 WP-1940-2015 amendment after due consultation with the Directorate, Town
and Country Planning has been sent for administrative approval of the Minister, Town and Country
Planning on 24.09.2019. From the demeanour of the Officer, it appears that there is no seriousness
attached to the concern of the Court in the context of proposal of the Indore Development Authority.
Hence, as prayed for by learned Sr. Counsel for the petitioners, writ petitions are now posted for
final disposal on a date to be agreed by the parties.
List this batch of cases on 14.11.2019 for final disposal, as jointly agreed to by the parties. A copy of
the order be placed on the record of connected matters.
