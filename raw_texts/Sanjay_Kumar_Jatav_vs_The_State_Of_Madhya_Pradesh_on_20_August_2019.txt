THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
W.A.No.703/2019 (Sanjay Kumar Jatav Vs. State of M.P. and others)
Gwalior, Dated:-20.8.2019
Shri G.S. Sharma, learned counsel for the appellant.
Heard on admission.
(1) This appeal under Section 2 (1) of Madhya Pradesh Uchcha
Nyayalaya (Khand Nyaypeeth Ko Appeal) Adhiniyam, 2005 is
directed against the order dated 22.10.2018 passed in
W.P.No.18818/2018; whereby, rejection of appellant's candidature
for appointment to the post of Constable has been upheld. The
rejection of candidature was for the reasons that the appellant
concealed the fact of his criminal prosecution in verification form.
(2) Having participated in the process of recruitment to the post
of Constable and being placed in the select list, the candidature of the
appellant was cancelled on the finding that he did not disclose in the
verification form the fact that he was proceeded in a Criminal Case
vide Crime No.438/2014 for the offence punishable under sections
323, 325 and 504 IPC, by order dated 14.8.2014. The order was
successfully challenged in W.P.No.8204/2015. However, the order
was modified in W.A.No.912/2017, which was decided on
11.12.2017 in the following terms:

"Therefore, the conclusion that the respondent is
not eligible, without any foundation cannot be given the stamp of approval. Learned Single Judge
was, thus, within his right in setting aside the THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
W.A.No.703/2019 (Sanjay Kumar Jatav Vs. State of M.P. and others) order. However, since it is
within the domain of the competent Authority to consider the incumbent for an appointment, the
direction by learned Single Judge directing the issuance of appointment order and for consequential
benefit cannot be given the stamp of approval. Consequently, the direction for appointment,
back-wages, seniority and other consequential benefits is set aside. The appellants shall consider the
case of respondent in the terms of paragraphs 38.4.1 and 38.4.3 Avtar Singh (Supra) and pass an
order within three months from the date of communication of this order." (3) On reconsideration
fresh order was passed on 24.5.2018;
whereby, his candidature was rejected on the findings:

challenge declined indulgence on the findings:
"12. From a bare reading of the paragraph 38.4.1 and 38.4.3, the Apex Court has
allowed discretion to the competent authority to ignore suppression of fact or
furnishing of false information by condoning the lapses if the offence is petty in
nature which does not render the incumbent unfit for the post in question.
12.1 In the present case, the offence is voluntarily causing grievous injury which
cannot be termed as petty in nature especially when overt act of assault with Lathi is
alleged against the petitioner and it is not a case of implication merely with the aid of
section 34 or 149 of IPC. Therefore, discretion exercised by the competent authority
while passing the impugned order treating offence u/S. 325 IPC as one of the relevant
consideration for rendering the petitioner unfit for employment in police force,
cannot be found fault with and deserves no interference in the limited discretionary
jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH W.A.No.703/2019 (Sanjay Kumar
Jatav Vs. State of M.P. and others) 12.2 The Apex court in Paragraph 38.4.3 has
extended further discretion upon the employer to consider all relevant facts available
as to antecedents and may take decision as to continuance of the employee in service
if it is found that the candidate has been acquitted of any offence involving moral
turpitude or offence of heinous/serious nature on technical ground which is not clean
and honourable.
12.3 Factual matrix when tested on the anvil of law laid down in paragraph 38.4.3, it
is seen that the offence in question u/S. 325 IPC does not involve moral turpitude but
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/118316220/ 3
Sanjay Kumar Jatav vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 August, 2019
is not of petty nature and is a serious offence especially when the overt act of
petitioner of assaulting with Lathi has caused grievous injury of fracture in the
arm/hand of the injured. Therefore, the employer may not be right in treating the
offence u/S. 325 IPC as involving moral turpitude but it cannot be denied that the
said offence is not petty in nature and is serious enough to make available the
required discretion to the recruiting/appointing authority to treat the said offence as
a bar to public employment which herein is a disciplined force.
13. The most relevant and crucial factor which dissuades this court from exercising
writ jurisdiction in favour of the petitioner is the suppression of material fact about
criminal antecedent in the verification form as held supra.
THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH W.A.No.703/2019 (Sanjay Kumar
Jatav Vs. State of M.P. and others) The act of suppression in the verification form
reflects adversely on the moral fiber and character of the candidate thereby enabling
the employer to oust the petitioner from competition and choose another eligible
candidate, though less meritorious, but of clean image and character for induction
into the police force."
(5) Appellant takes exception to the order on the ground that the learned Single Jude glossed over
the aspect that the offences registered against him did not involve moral turpitude, and the
appellant was also acquitted of all the offences.
(6) In our considered opinion it is not the offence or an acquittal thereof which is relevant, the
relevant is its disclosure in the verification form, which enables the employer to know the
antecedent and access whether he can be employed. Therefore, non-disclosure of the criminal cases
in verification form has been treated as unpardonable act of concealment, and the consequential
disqualification.
(7) In Avtar Singh Vs. Union of India and others, (2016) 8 SCC 971, it is held by their Lordships:
"38.7. In a case of deliberate suppression of fact with respect to multiple pending
cases such false information by itself will assume significance and an employer may
pass appropriate order THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
W.A.No.703/2019 (Sanjay Kumar Jatav Vs. State of M.P. and others) cancelling
candidature or terminating services as appointment of a person against whom
multiple criminal cases were pending may not be proper."
(8) In State of Madhya Pradesh and others Vs. Abhijit Singh Pawar, Civil Appeal No.11356 of 2018,
it is held:
"17. We must observe at this stage that there is nothing on record to suggest that the
decision taken by the concerned authorities in rejecting the candidature of the
respondent was in any way actuated by malafides or suffered on any other count. The
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/118316220/ 4
Sanjay Kumar Jatav vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 August, 2019
decision on the question of suitability of the respondent, in our considered view, was
absolutely correct and did not call for any interference. We, therefore, allow this
appeal, set aside the decisions rendered by the Single Judge as well as by the Division
Bench and dismiss Writ Petition No.9412 of 2013 preferred by the respondent. No
costs."
(9) The issue as present one came up for consideration before Full Bench of our High Court in
Ashutosh Pawar Vs. High Court of Madhya Pradesh & Another (2018 (2) M.P.L.J. 419), wherein
following questions were dwelt upon:-
"1. Whether in all cases, where an FIR lodged against a person for minor offences has
been quashed on the basis of a compromise arrived at between the parties or a person
has been acquitted on account of a compromise between the parties, THE HIGH
COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH W.A.No.703/2019 (Sanjay Kumar Jatav Vs. State of
M.P. and others) the character of the person applying for appointment thereafter, has
to be treated as Good and such a person cannot be held ineligible for appointment
under the Rules of 1994 ?
2. Whether the High Court in exercise of its powers under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India, can step into the shoes of the Appointing Authority and
determine as to whether the person concerned is fit for appointment or whether the
High Court on finding that the Authority concerned has wrongly exercised its
discretion in holding the candidate to be ineligible should, after quashing the order,
remit the matter back to the authority concerned for reconsideration or for fresh
consideration as to the eligibility of the person ?
3. Whether the High Court while allowing such a petition in exercise of its powers
under Article 226 of the Constitution of India can issue a further direction to the
authority to appoint the person concerned on the post from the date his batchmates
were appointed and to grant him back dated seniority and all other benefits or
whether the High Court should simply remit the matter back to the authority for
taking a decision in this regard ?
4. Whether the high standards of adjudging the good character of a candidate for
appointment as a Judicial Officer, which has been adopted and THE HIGH COURT
OF MADHYA PRADESH W.A.No.703/2019 (Sanjay Kumar Jatav Vs. State of M.P.
and others) followed by the State under the Rules of 1994 till the decision in the case
of Arvind Gurjar (supra) were and are right and proper or whether in view of the
decision in the case of Arvind Gurjar (supra), the same should be considered to be
relaxed to the extent that in all cases the character of a person should be treated to be
good where he has been acquitted for minor offences on the basis of a compromise?
5. Whether the decision in the case of Arvind Gurjar (supra) lays down the correct
law ?
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/118316220/ 5
Sanjay Kumar Jatav vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 August, 2019
6. Any other question that may arise for adjudication or decision in the dispute
involved in the present petition and which the Larger Bench thinks appropriate to
decide ?"
Presently we are concerned with issue no.2. Dwelling on the same, it is held:
"40. In view of the law laid down in above said judgments, there is no doubt that in
exercise of power of judicial review under Article 226 of the Constitution of India,
this Court only examines the decision-making process and does not substitute itself
as a Court of appeal over the reasons recorded by the State Government. We find that
the decision of the State Government holding that the petitioner is not suitable, is
just, fair and reasonable keeping in view the nature of the post and the duties to be
discharged.
41. Even if the High Court finds that the THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA
PRADESH W.A.No.703/2019 (Sanjay Kumar Jatav Vs. State of M.P. and others)
decision of the State Government is suffering from some illegality, the jurisdiction of
the High Court in a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India is to
remit the matter to the Authority for reconsideration rather than to substitute the
decision of the competent Authority with that of its own. The Supreme Court in a
judgment reported as (1994) 4 SCC 448 (State of Haryana vs. Naresh Kumar Bali)
was examining a question: as to whether there could be a direction to appoint a
candidate, who sought appointment on compassionate ground. The Supreme Court
held as under:-
"16. With regard to appointment on compassionate ground we have set out the law in
Life Insurance Corpn. of India v. Asha Ramchhandra Ambekar (1994) 2 SCC
718. The same principle will clearly apply here. What the High Court failed to note is
the post of an Inspector is a promotional post. The issuing a direction to appoint the
respondent within three months when direct recruitment is not available, is
unsupportable. The High Court could have merely directed consideration of the claim
of the respondent in accordance with the rules. It cannot direct appointment. Such a
direction does not fall within the scope of mandamus. Judicial review, it has been
THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH W.A.No.703/2019 (Sanjay Kumar
Jatav Vs. State of M.P. and others) repeatedly emphasised, is directed against the
decision-making process and not against the decision itself; and it is no part of the
court's duty to exercise the power of the authorities itself. There is widespread
misconception on the scope of interference in judicial review. The exercise of the
extraordinary jurisdiction constitutionally conferred on the Apex Court under Article
142(1) of the Constitution can be of no guidance on the scope of Article 226."
(10) When the impugned order is tested on the anvil of above analysis, it cannot be faulted with.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/118316220/ 6

(11) Consequently, appeal fails and is dismissed. No costs.
