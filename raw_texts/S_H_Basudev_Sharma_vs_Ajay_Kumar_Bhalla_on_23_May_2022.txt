.... Petitioner/s
- Versus -
Ajay Kumar Bhalla, IAS and 4 Ors
.... Respondent/s
BEFORE HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE MV MURALIDARAN 23.05.2022 [1] Heard Mr. . K. Roshan,
learned counsel for the petitioner and Mr. Kh. Samarjit, learned ASG for the respondent Nos. 1,2.3,4
& 5. [2] Since this Court directed to take notice, Mr. K. Roshan, learned counsel for the petitioner
has already taken notice but Registry's note says that notice issued to respondent No.4 was returned
the reason being " No such person on this address". [2] Anyhow, Mr. Roshan, learned counsel for
the petitioner seeks time to take fresh notice upon the respondent No.4 with the correct address.
[3] Mr. Kh. Samarjit, learned ASG for the respondent Nos. 1,2,3,4 and 5 seeks time for filing counter
affidavit. [4] Therefore, post this matter on 18.07.2022.
