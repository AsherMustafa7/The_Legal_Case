V.Sujatha Bai vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 21 December, 2021
ORDER
This petition has been filed to quash the charge sheet in P.R.C.No.11 of 2017 on the file of the
learned Judicial Magistrate, Ambattur against the petitioner/2nd accused for the offence punishable
under Section 305 of I.P.C.
2. The crux of the prosecution case is that the deceased Divya aged about 18 years was studying in
the college known as Vel Tech. The present petitioner/A2 was working in the above college as
Assistant Professor and A1 was working as Computer Operator and also working as Warden. Both of
them were stayed in the same hostel. On 18.3.2014 at about 7.00 p.m. during study hours when
using of cellphones were prohibited, A1 found the deceased speaking over cellphone outside the
hostel. Immediately A1 received the cell phone from the deceased and removed the sim card and did
not hand over the cellphone to the student, informed that she will handover the same to the Chief
Warden viz., A2. Thereafter, A1 handed over the cell phone to A2. On seeing some obsene messages
exchanged by the deceased A2 the Petitioner herein appears to have stated the following words:
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.No.11039 of 2017 and Crl.M.P.Nos.7299 &
7300 of 2017 “Ú x©Q« fhnyÍš go¢á »Ê¡f njitÆšiy. cd¡F ãÇ‹ágš»£nl v‹FaÇ ïU¡F. Ú
it¤âU¡F« á«fh®il bfh©Lth. Ú všyh« cÆnuhL ïU¡fwijÉl br¤J¤ bjhiyayh«.” The
deceased thereafter committed suicide in the hostel on 19.3.2014.
3. The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Petitioner vehemently contended that it is a
unfortunate incident where the student has committed suicide on her own, particularly when she
was found using the cell phone during prohibited hours. As the warden found some obscene
messages in the cell phone the deceased has committed suicide. Therefore, it is his contention that
due to the unrest among the students the case has been foisted against the petitioner who has
arrayed as 2nd Accused and the other accused A1 is not before this Court.
4. It is the further contention of the learned Senior Counsel is that the entire prosecution materials
collected in final report even taken in face https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.No.11039 of
2017 and Crl.M.P.Nos.7299 & 7300 of 2017 value, the same will not constitute an offence of
abetting, under section 305 I.P.C. The entire allegations unearthed against the Petitioner from the
statements of the witnesses clearly show that the deceased in fact had affairs with one Gopinath. The
entire allegations targeted against the petitioner is that on seeing some obscene messages in the cell
phone seized from the deceased the Petitioner stated that, “what is the point in studying here.
Instead of you go and die.” Except that there is no allegation unearthed from the Petitioner. The
learned Senior Counsel also submitted that due to the arrest the Petitioner was suspended and she
lost her job and during the Covid both husband and wife infected with Covid and husband died in
the hospital, she not even seen and performed his last rites and rituals. At any event it is his
contention that the entire offence has not been made out. Therefore, it is the fit case for the Court to
exercise its power under Section 482 Cr.P.C.to quash the final report. In support of his contention,
he relied upon the following judgments:

5. The learned counsel appearing for the State submitted that the Petitioner has not properly
handled the deceased. She is nearing 18 years at the relevant point of time and the incident the
Petitioner seized the cell phone and not returned it and informed the deceased that she will report to
the principal. Therefore, the conduct of the Petitioner in not properly handling the deceased has to
be taken into consideration in this matter and opposed to quash the final report.
6. Normally the Court will not exercise power under Section 482 Cr.P.C.when the materials collected
by the prosecution prima faciely indicate that there are allegation which required to be established
before the trial Court. But at the same time, when the entire materials collected by the prosecution
and final report taken in face value do not constitute an offence, there cannot be any difficulty for
the Court to exercise the power under Section 482 Cr.P.C.to quash the proceedings to prevent the
unnecessary ordeal of trial. The case on hand as narrated above unfortunately a pathetic case. The
deceased is a student from a college where the present Petitioner https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
Crl.O.P.No.11039 of 2017 and Crl.M.P.Nos.7299 & 7300 of 2017 joined as a Professor as per the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/136833734/ 3
V.Sujatha Bai vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 21 December, 2021
prosecutor and A1 is also joined as a Computer Operator in the college besides she was also working
as Hostel Warden. The entire prosecution also indicate that the use of cell phones during the study
hours in the evening in the hostel is prohibited.
7. On 18.3.2014 at 7.00 p.m.during study hours, the deceased was found talking to someone over
cell phone which was noticed by A1 and she seized the cellphone and kept the sim card with her.
Thereafter, when the next day the deceased asked her sim card A1 produced the deceased before the
Chief Warden/the Petitioner herein and handed over the simcard to her. On seeing some messages
exchanged in the cellphone by the deceased said to have stated that “there is no need to study.
Instead of studying you go and die.” and also informed that she will report to the Principal.
Thereafter, the deceased appears to have committed suicide. It is relevant to note that when the
materials collected by the prosecution do not itself constitute any offence, there is no purpose in
driving the persons to undergo ordeal of trial. The grave men of the offence punishable under
section 305 I.P.C is abetting https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.No.11039 of 2017 and
Crl.M.P.Nos.7299 & 7300 of 2017 suicide. To bring a person within the ambit of Section 107
I.P.C.,which defines abetment, it must be shown by the prosecution that
(a) there must be instigation by the accused to commit the offence.
(b) the accused engaged in conspiracy to commit the offence
(c) to aid into commission of offence only these three ingredients which are essential for proving the
abetment to establish on record the prosecution can succeed in establishing the charges under
Sections 305 or 306 of I.P.C. The abetment to constitute an offence there must be some active
suggestion or support to the commission of offence. The Word instigate found in Section 107 IPC
literally means to provoke, incite, urge on or to bring about by persuasion to do any thing as held by
the Apex Court in Kishori lal vs. State of M.P. [(2007) 10 SCC 797] Therefore, when the words which
are using in normal circumstances without any intention of driving any person to end his/her life,
such words never to be construed as an instigation to instigate a person to commit
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.No.11039 of 2017 and Crl.M.P.Nos.7299 & 7300 of 2017
suicide. The entire prosecution case itself indicate that the deceased has found talking cellphone
when the same was prohibited during the study hours. It is normal affairs in any institution that
whenever any student deviates the rules of the institution, head of the department or warden would
normally warn the student in that aspect. Therefore, merely because unable to withstand such
warning and the student took some extreme step of ending his/her life such act cannot constitute an
offence of inciting or instigating the student to commit an office that too with intention. Even any
words spoken by the warden or professors such utterance was only for the welfare of the students.
Therefore merely because a student herself thought she was ashamed and committed suicide due to
emotional decision or over sensitiveness such act never constitute an offence of abetment on the
part of the teachers. This Court is also cannot ignore the fact that many cases are filed due to unrest
among the students in order to prevent any further law and order issues, the prosecution shirking
the responsibility just filing the final report.

8. In Sonti Rama Krishna's case (supra) the Apex Court has held that the words uttered in a fit of
anger or emotion without any intention cannot be termed as instigation and thereby quashed the
final report by exercising power under Section 482 Cr.P.C.
9. In Sanju Alias Sanjay Sing Sengar's case (Supra) in para 12 the Apex Court held as follows:
12. ... ... ... ... ... Even if we accept the prosecution story that the appellant did tell the
deceased 'to go and die', that itself does not constitute the ingredient of 'instigation'.
The word 'instigate' denotes incitement or urging to do some drastic or unadvisable
action or to stimulate or incite. Presence of mens rea, therefore, is the necessary
concomitant of instigation. It is common knowledge that the words uttered in a
quarrel or https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.No.11039 of 2017 and
Crl.M.P.Nos.7299 & 7300 of 2017 in a spur of the moment cannot be taken to be
uttered with mens rea. It is in a fit of anger and emotional.
10. In Swamy Prahaladdas's case (supra) the accused remarked to the deceased to go and die. Such a
circumstances the Apex court has held that the prosecution do not stand on the quash.
11. Similar views also taken by this Court and followed the above judgement and quashed the
proceedings in Crl.O.P.Nos.4186 of 2016 and 16295 of 2017.
12. Considering the above well settled position of law and also indicated that except the allegation
that the petitioner has remarked that instead of studying to go and die there were no other
allegations as against the petitioner or 1st Accused, that they forced the deceased to commit suicide.
Only when allegations indicate that their act was such which has driven a student to take such
extreme step by ending her life it can be said that their act come under abetment. The very
allegation unearthed by the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.No.11039 of 2017 and
Crl.M.P.Nos.7299 & 7300 of 2017 prosectuion indicate that the student has took emotional decision
as some obscene messages found in her cellphone which was noticed by the warden and informed
that the same would be placed to the principal. Such conduct, in view of this Court never amounts to
instigation or incitement. Even assuming such utterances has taken place, such utterances made by
the Petitioner being the well wisher and guardian of the students at the relevant point of time, she
has uttered only for the benefit of the student to prevent such incident. Further, the investigation
reveals that the student has also fell in affair with somebody. In such view of the matter merely
because the girl committed suicide and such utterance made without any intention as only
corrective measures would not constitute an offence under section 305 I.P.C. Therefore, this Court is
of the view that the continuation of the proceedings is nothing but futile exercise and no purpose
would be served to the prosecution. In such view of the matter entire proceedings in PRC No.11 of
2017 on the file fo the Judicial Magistrate, Ambattur is quashed.
13. 1st Accused is not before this Court, the only allegation against https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
Crl.O.P.No.11039 of 2017 and Crl.M.P.Nos.7299 & 7300 of 2017 A1 is only seizing of the mobile
phone from the student and informing the same to the Petitioner/A2. Such view of the matter,
merely because she has not approached this Court by way of 482 Cr.P.C.petition she cannot be

V.Sujatha Bai vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 21 December, 2021
forced to undergo the ordeal of the trial. In such view of the matter this Court taking note of the facts
and circumstances of the case and well settled law in this aspect as no materials unearthed to prove
the allegations of abetment which resulted in suicide, the entire prosecution, not only against this
Petitioner but also against the 2nd Accused is quashed.
14. In the result, the entire proceedings in PRC No.11 of 2017 on the file of the Judicial Magistrate,
Ambattur is quashed and the Criminal Original Petition is ordered.
