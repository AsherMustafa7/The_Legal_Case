(xiv) To any other relief/ reliefs for which the petititoner is found to be entitled in the fact and
circumstances of the case."
3. Perusal of the blacklisting order dated 27.08.2025, it is crystal clear that it is not a speaking or
reasoned order so as to affirm. Respondents are exercising quasi judicial function insofar as
blacklisting Contractors. In such an event, they are bound to follow the certain principles laid down
by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in paragraph-40 in the case of ORYX Fisheries Private Patna High
Court CWJC No.16000 of 2025 dt.09-10-2025 Limited Versus Union of India and Others, reported
in (2010) 13 Supreme Court Cases 427. Paragraph-40 reads as under:
"40. In Kranti Associates [(2010) 9 SCC 496 :
(2010) 3 SCC (Civ) 852] this Court after considering various judgments formulated
certain principles in SCC para 47 of the judgment which are set out below : (SCC pp.
510-12) "(a) In India the judicial trend has always been to record reasons, even in
administrative decisions, if such decisions affect anyone prejudicially.
(b) A quasi-judicial authority must record reasons in support of its conclusions.
(c) Insistence on recording of reasons is meant to serve the wider principle of justice
that justice must not only be done it must also appear to be done as well.
(d) Recording of reasons also operates as a valid restraint on any possible arbitrary
exercise of judicial and quasi-judicial or even administrative power.
(e) Reasons reassure that discretion has been exercised by the decision-maker on
relevant grounds and by disregarding extraneous considerations.
(f) Reasons have virtually become as indispensable a component of a
decision-making process as observing principles of natural justice Patna High Court
CWJC No.16000 of 2025 dt.09-10-2025 by judicial, quasi-judicial and even by
administrative bodies.
(g) Reasons facilitate the process of judicial review by superior courts.
(h) The ongoing judicial trend in all countries committed to rule of law and
constitutional governance is in favour of reasoned decisions based on relevant facts.
This is virtually the lifeblood of judicial decision-making justifying the principle that
reason is the soul of justice.
(i) Judicial or even quasi-judicial opinions these days can be as different as the judges
and authorities who deliver them. All these decisions serve one common purpose
which is to demonstrate by reason that the relevant factors have been objectively
considered. This is important for sustaining the litigants' faith in the justice delivery

Md. Makbul Alam vs The State Of Bihar on 9 October, 2025
system.
(j) Insistence on reason is a requirement for both judicial accountability and
transparency.
(k) If a judge or a quasi-judicial authority is not candid enough about his/her
decision-making process then it is impossible to know whether the person deciding is
faithful to the doctrine of precedent or to principles of incrementalism.
(l) Reasons in support of decisions must be cogent, clear and succinct. A pretence of
reasons or Patna High Court CWJC No.16000 of 2025 dt.09-10-2025 'rubber-stamp
reasons' is not to be equated with a valid decision-making process.
(m) It cannot be doubted that transparency is the sine qua non of restraint on abuse
of judicial powers. Transparency in decision-making not only makes the judges and
decision-makers less prone to errors but also makes them subject to broader scrutiny.
(See David Shapiro in Defence of Judicial Candor(1987) 100 Harv. L. Rev. 731-37.)
(n) Since the requirement to record reasons emanates from the broad doctrine of
fairness in decision-making, the said requirement is now virtually a component of
human rights and was considered part of Strasbourg Jurisprudence. See Ruiz Torija
v. Spain [(1994) 19 EHRR 553] , EHRR at p. 562, para 29 and Anya v. University of
Oxford [2001 EWCA Civ 405 : 2001 ICR 847 (CA)] , wherein the Court referred to
Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights which requires, 'adequate and
intelligent reasons must be given for judicial decisions'.
(o) In all common law jurisdictions judgments play a vital role in setting up
precedents for the future.
Therefore, for development of law, requirement of giving reasons for the decision is of the essence
and is virtually a part of 'due process'."
In the light of the aforementioned principles, the respondents have not adhered to the principles
while ordering Patna High Court CWJC No.16000 of 2025 dt.09-10-2025 blacklisting. Accordingly,
the petitioner has made out a case so as to interfere with the orders dated 23.08.2025 (Letter No.
02- 15/25, 2297), 27.08.2025 (Letter No. 4515-01-966/2025, 3028) and dated 27.08.2025 (Memo
No. 4515-01-966/2025, 3082), order dated 27.08.2025 (Letter No. 2435) and order dated
29.08.2025 (Letter No. 2047), hence, they are set aside.
4. The matter is remanded to the concerned authority to pass a fresh order, after providing
opportunity of hearing to the petitioner and to proceed to pass a reasoned and speaking order.
The concerned authority is hereby directed to take note of the principles laid down by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the aforementioned decision and pass orders within three months from today.
