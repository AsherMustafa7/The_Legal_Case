[3] After passing the order, the respondent No.1 has issued a resolution dated
20.04.2023 which reads as follows:
"MANIPUR LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY SECRETARIAT *********** Imphal, 20th
April, 2023 The Hill Areas Committee, Manipur Legislative Assembly, in its meeting
held on 20" April, 2023 in the Office Chamber of the Hon'ble Chairmen, HAC
unanimously adopted the resolution.
RESOLUTION NO, 55/2023 - (HAC) The Hill Areas Committee, Manipur Legislative
Assembly is perturbed/aggrieved by the Order of Hon'ble Court of Manipur dated
19/04/2023 in Writ Petition No. 229 of 2023 directing the Government of Manipur
to recommend for inclusion of Meitei/Meetei community in the Scheduled Tribe list
of the Constitution of India in Spite of Strong opposition from the Scheduled Tribes
of Manipur.
In the matter, the HAC as a Constitutional Body of the Hill Areas of Manipur was
neither made party to the case nor consulted The HAC also has given any
recommendation or consent.
Further, it is pertinent to mention that the Meitei/Meetei community of Manipur are
already protected under Constitution of India and categorized as (i) General (ii)
Other Backward Classes (OBC) and
(iii) Scheduled Cast (SC). In view of the above, the committee unanimously resolved
to urge the Government of Manipur and Government of India to go for Appeals
against the aforementioned Order of the Hon'ble High Court of Manipur, taking into
account the sentiments and interests/rights of the Scheduled Tribe of the Manipur.
(Sd/-) (Dinganglung Gangmei) Chairman (HAC) Manipur Legislative Assembly"
[4] Thereafter, the second respondent who is the President of All Tribal Students'
Union Manipur(ATSUM) also issued press statement dated 21. 04.2023 which reads
as follows:
"19 April is a black letter day for the tribal people of Manipur. The High Court
judgement which directed the state Government to recommend the demand of Meitei
for inclusion in the ST list by contradicting the wish and aspiration of the tribal
people is unfortunate and deplorable. It is an ex parte judgement that only heard the

Mutum Churamani Meitei And Anr vs Dinganglung Gangmei And 4 Ors on 3 May, 2023
interests of the petitioners.
The demand of ST status by the socially and economically advanced community of
the state is uncalled for. lt deeply disturbs the sense of security of the tribal people
who are otherwise protected under the provisions of the constitutions. The tribal
community have been opposing this demand on valid reasons that the Meitei
community, which is comparatively an advanced community, does not merit their .
inclusion as scheduled tribe in the constitutions. It completely negates the very
objective of scheduling group of people for protective discrimination as ST in the
constitutions.
Therefore, the tribal people of the state will not take this judgment lying down. We
blame the state government because of whose consent such an ex parte judgment was
delivered. We will explore all options including legal means to dissuade the state
government from recommending it to the central government. We will continue to
strongly oppose this demand.
The state government must desist from recommending this demand as it completely
affects the rights and interests of the tribal people, and also as the demand has the
potential of adversely affecting the unity and integrity of the people of the state. We
also appeal the State Government to uphold the emotional integrity of the state which
is bound to disintegrate once the demand for inclusion of Meitei in ST is granted.
The meeting of the tribal students' organizations of the state convened by ATSUM
today( Friday, the 21st April 2023) acknowledge the prompt action of the HAC for
taking into account the sentiments, rights and interest of the scheduled tribes of
Manipur with respect to the Meitei ST demand vide its resolution No.55/2023 -
(HAC) dated 20th April 2023.
In fact, the resolution as pressed issued by the respondents No.1 and 2 is criticizing
the order passed by this Court in WP(C) No. 229 of 2023 dated 27.03.2023.
[5] He also further argued that such resolution dated 20.04.2023 passed by the
contemnor No.1 and the press statement dated 21.04.2023 by the contemnor No.2
are against the law and he cannot take such decision which amounts to purview of the
Hill Area Committee of Manipur and the respondents No. 1 and 2 are not permitted
to circulate such resolution which is violative of this Court's order passed in the above
writ petition.
[6] He also further argued that the press Communioue issued by the respondent No.2
dated 21.04.2023 whereby mentioned so many contemptuous words like " 19 April is
a black letter day for the tribal people of Manipur... ... ... by conducting the wish and
aspiration of the tribal people is unfortunate and deplorable"

[7] Mr. M. Hemchandra, learned senior counsel further argued that the tribal people of the State will
not take with judgment and order lying down thereby directly threatening the authority of the
Hon'ble High Court of Manipur. Therefore, the Act of the respondents No. 1 and 2 amounts to
comtempt and they should be punished under the Contempt of Court Act, 1971 read with Article 215
of the Constitution of India and hence, he prayed this Court to issue notice to the respondents and
deal the same seriously.
[8] After hearing the arguments of the learned senior counsel for the petitioner, this Court comes to
know that the resolution dated 20.04.2023 passed by the respondent No.1 and the press
Communioue dated 21.04.2023 issued by the respondent No.2 which amounts to criticize the
judgment and order passed by this Court in WP(C) No.229 of 2023 dated 27.03.2023. Therefore,
this Court is inclined to call the respondents No.1 and 2 before this Court and seek the explanation
as to why action should not be taken under the Contempt of Court against them.
[9] Therefore,
a). Issue notice to the respondents No.1 and 2 for their personal appearance on 08.05.2023 before
this Court.
b). The Director General of Police, Manipur is to ensure their personal appearance for instigating
innocent hill people against the order passed by Hon'ble High Court of Manipur with show cause as
to why they should not be punished for criticizing the order passed by this Court in WP(C) No.229 of
2023 dated 27.03.2023.
c). Friends in Print and Electronic Media may appeal to the organizations/Civil Society Bodies and
General People not to cause low dignity of the High Court of Manipur. [10] Registry is directed to
issue the copy of this order to Director General of Police, Manipur today itself.
