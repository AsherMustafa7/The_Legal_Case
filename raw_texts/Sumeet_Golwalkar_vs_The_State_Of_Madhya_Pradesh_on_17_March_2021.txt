(SUMEET GOLWALKAR Vs THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH)
Jabalpur, Dated : 17-03-2021
Shri Sankalp Kochar, learned counsel for the applicant.
Shri Rajeshwar Rao, learned G.A. for the respondent/State.
This is third application under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. for grant of bail. Applicant Sumeet
Golwalkar was arrested on 11/04/2019 in connection with Crime No.12/2019 registered at
Economic Offences Wing, Bhopal (MP) for the offence punishable under Sections 120-B, 420, 467,
468, 471 of the IPC, Section 66 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 and Section 7 read with
Section 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.
2. The earlier bail applications filed by applicant were dismissed on merit by this Court vide orders
dated 25/06/2019 & 31/10/2019 passed in M.Cr.C.Nos.19786/2019 & 40800/2019 respectively.
3. As per prosecution story, M.P. State Electronics Development Corporation Ltd. (hereinafter
referred to as Ã¢Â€ÂœMPSEDCÃ¢Â€Â) is a body working under the State of M.P. Department of
Science and Technology. The Department of Information Technology, Govt. of Madhya Pradesh
adopted the e-Tendering System using an online platform in 2006. In the year 2012 Government of
Madhya Pradesh appointed MPSEDC, as the Nodal Agency for MP e-procurement portal. MPSEDC
selected M/s Tata Consultancy Services with Antares Systems Ltd. as the new Implementation
Agency for end-to-end e-Procurement solutions. The agreement with TCS & Antares was signed in
the year 2013. The New Service Providers undertook the Customization, Integration,
Implementation and Maintenance of Single, Unitary, Web-Based e-Procurement Software (Portal)
with the specified modules which also include E-Tendering. Co-accused Manohar M.N. was the Vice
President of Antares Systems Ltd. and was the project in-charge on behalf of the company.
Co-accused Nandkishor Brahme was posted as OSD in MPSEDC from the year 2012 and was
assigned the duty as Nodal Officer 2 MCRC-26178-2020 of E-Tendering Project. In the E-Tendering
Project, MPSEDC made a platform available to various Government Departments for floating
tenders. In the tendering processes, the concerned Department which issued the tender uploaded its

Sumeet Golwalkar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 17 March, 2021
tender on the portal, on which the last date of filing tender and the time of its opening was
mentioned. While issuing the tender, the concerned officer also attached the public key of his digital
signature. The tenderer after registering himself on MP e-Procurement portal filled the tender and
after filing the tender, submitted the tender on the portal after it was encrypted by the public key of
the officer concerned attached with the tender. After submission of the tender, no departmental
officer, e-tendering company or another person could open the tender before its opening time.
4. On 11th April 2018 at the time of opening of three tenders Nos. 91, 93 & 94 floated by the Madhya
Pradesh Jal Nigam Maryadit (hereinafter referred as Ã¢Â€ÂœMPJNMÃ¢Â€Â) the computer
displayed a message that Ã¢Â€Âœthe contents of the document had been modifiedÃ¢Â€Â. On that
service provider company, Antares Systems Ltd. was directed to submit the report after inquiry. In
the first report given by the team of Antares Systems Ltd after examining the system, they
mentioned that there was no irregularity and only attributed the message to technical defect.
However, they also stated that further technical analysis was going on. Thereafter, on 05/05/2019
Antares Systems Ltd. again gave the Root Cause Analysis Report (R.C.A.) mentioning therein that
the tenders had been tampered with. On that, the then Managing Director of MPSIDC informed
MPJNM for cancelling these bids and also directed Antares Systems Ltd. to enquire all the tenders,
which were floated by the various Government departments between 01/01/2018 to 30/04/2018 on
E-Portal. On that, the team of employees of Antares Systems Ltd. again enquired the matter and
gave the report to the effect that during the check period six other tenders i.e. tender of MP Road
Development Corporation No.786, Public Works Department Tender Nos. 49813, 49982 & 49985
and tender of Water Resources Department Nos. 10030 & 10044 were 3 MCRC-26178-2020 also
manipulated similarly.
5. Thereupon, on the direction of Chief Secretary of M.P. Government, a preliminary enquiry was
conducted by the Economic Offence Wing. In the preliminary enquiry, it was found that after
changing the bid price of tender Nos. 91, 93 & 94 of MPJNM amounting to Rs.1,769 crore the M/s
GVPR Engineers Limited Hyderabad for tender No.91, M/s the Hume Pipe Company Limited
Mumbai for tender No. 93 and M/s JMC Projects India Limited Mumbai for tender No. 94 were
made lowest bidder (L1), likewise by tampering the two tenders of the Public Works Department
Tenders Nos.49985 & 49982 amounting to Rs.13.46 crores, M/s Ramkumar Narwani Bhopal, were
made lowest bidder, in the Tender no. 4981319 amounting to 15 crores, Sorathiya Velji Ratna and
Company Vadodara were made lowest bidder. After tampering the tender of Madhya Pradesh Road
Development Corporation amounting to Rs.7.86 crores M/s Madhav Infra projects Vadodara, Water
Resources Department tender Nos.10030 & 10044 total amounting to Rs.1135 Crore, M/s Max
Mantena Micro JV Hyderabad & Sorathiya Velji Ratna Baroda were made a lower bidder, due to
which companies earned illegal profits.
6. On the basis of that preliminary evidence and findings of a probe report of the Computer
Emergency Response Team, New Delhi, Crime No.12/2019 was registered at Economic Offences
Wing, Bhopal (M.P.) for the offence punishable under Sections 120-B, 420, 468, 471 of the IPC,
Section 66 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 and Section 7 read with Section 13(2) of the
Prevention of Corruption Act against applicant and other co-accused persons.

7. From the report of the Computer Emergency Response Team, New Delhi and the other evidence
collected by the investigating agency during investigation it was found that in the year 2016, OSMO
Pvt. Ltd. co-accused Vinay Choudhary and Varun Chaturvedi, the Managing Directors of OSMO and
applicant Sumit Golwalkar, the Marketing Director of that company 4 MCRC-26178-2020 entered
into an agreement with Antares Ltd. in order to check the reasons why the whole system of
E-tendering had slowed down and was engaged to conduct a performance test of the E-tendering
system and come up with concrete steps to tackle the slow speed. During the performance test,
OSMO was provided with user IDs and Bidder IDs by Antares Ltd. In the month of June 2016,
OSMO stated that it was not able to conduct a performance test of the whole system and thus could
not complete the process of testing.
8. It is further stated that the manipulation was done by one of the user ID and bid IDs. For
manipulating the tenders of MPJNM, a demo file was created on MP e-procurement portal. That file
was created using ID PT 4, which was given to OSMO IT Solutions at the time of performance
testing and they also used digital signature certificate (DSC) of Keshav Rao Uikey. The IP address
registered while creating the said demo file was 27.60.163.98 and 27.60.185.14 which was linked
with mobile No. 9755092919. The SIM of this mobile number was registered in the name of
co-accused Vinay Choudhary and was being used by co-accused Varun Chaturvedi. Thereafter,
hackers entered into the database through the staging server, where original tenders were stored
and this process was done through a virtual private network (VPN), the access of which was only
with co-accused Nandkishore Bramhe. After reaching the database server hackers accessed the file
where the original tenders were saved. They copied the details of all the bidders, who submitted the
bids, which were encrypted. After copying the bids they again came back to the demo tender file
created by them earlier and by using bidder ID number 15597 and vendor ID number QK 829 846
pasted the said bids in the demo file. The vendor ID used for this purpose was the same, which was
issued to OSMO for performance testing in the year 2016. After pasting the encrypted bid in the
demo file, the hackers assessed the system again on 03-03-2018 i.e. the date on which the said bids
stood decrypted as the date of opening the demo tender was mentioned as 03-03-2018. Thus, they
were able to see the figures/bids submitted by all the bidders in 5 MCRC-26178-2020 encrypted
form. After seeing the amount filed by each bidder another demo file was created in the second
demo file, the encrypted bids as visible in the first demo file were pasted in the second demo file.
Again by using the bidder ID No.15597 having vendor ID number QK29846 they manipulated the
bids and made the person they wanted to benefit as the lowest bidder. After making the change in
the second demo file and placing a wrong bidder L1 hackers copied the encrypted/manipulated bid
value and again by using the staging server reached the database server through a VPN, access of
which was given to co-accused Nandkishore Bramhe, opened the original tender file and pasted the
said encrypted manipulated bid value next to the name of the bidder they wanted to benefit and thus
manipulated the bids.
9. The specific allegations against the applicant Sumit Golwalkar is that digital signature certificate
of Praveen Guru and Keshav Rao Uike were registered by applicant Sumeet Golwalkar, who was the
Marketing Director of OSMO and the manipulation in the bids was done by using said DSC of
Praveen Guru and Keshav Rao Uikey. Applicant was also partner in Shricon Multi Infra along with
co-accused Vinay Choudhary and Avinash K. Choudhary (brother of Vinay Choudhary). Sarothia

Sumeet Golwalkar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 17 March, 2021
Velji, who was made L1 bidder by manipulating the bids, transferred money in the account of
Shricon Multi Infra Developers, which shows the nexus of the applicant in the crime.
10. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the applicant submitted that the applicant is innocent
and has falsely been implicated in the offence. He further submitted that the applicant was not the
Marketing Director of OSMO Company. It is alleged that co-accused Vinay Choudhary & Varun
Chaturvedi in connivance with the present applicant and other co- accused persons manipulated the
bids, but the present applicant is merely an employee of the company OSMO IT Solutions. It is
alleged against the present applicant that he had registration authority of digital signature of the
tender opening authority Mr. Praveen Kumar Guru and Keshav Rao Uikey. But the said allegation is
not true. The Registration authority associate 6 MCRC-26178-2020 agreement was executed
between M/s Samadhan Technologies, Cosmo IT Solution Private Limited and E-mudra. Samadhan
Technology was the registration authority while OSMO was the Registration Authority Associate and
E-Mudra was the certifying authority. The digital signature of Mr. Praveen Kumar Guru and Keshav
Rao Uikey were prepared by E-mudra and not by the applicant. After preparing digital signature of
the officer/employee, the said signatures are handed over to the officer/employee concerned as per
policy of company and that person after changing the password starts using the same. There is no
evidence on record to show that said digital signature of Mr. Praveen Kumar Guru and Keshav Rao
Uikey were not handed over to them. It is also alleged that some money was transferred by the
Sorathiya Velji in the account of Shricon Multi Infra, in which the applicant was one of the partners,
but that amount was transferred on account of work done by the company as subcontractor for
Sorathiya Velji. There is no other evidence on record to connect the applicant with the crime. Police
falsely implicated the applicant in the crime. There is no likelihood of his absconding or tampering
with the prosecution evidence. He has been in custody since 11/04/2019 and the trial is still
pending. On the strength of aforesaid submissions, it is prayed that the applicant be released on
bail.
11. Learned counsel for the respondent/EOW submitted that co- accused Vinay Chaudhary and
Varun Chaturvedi are the Managing directors of OSMO Private Ltd. and applicant Sumit Golwalkar
is the marketing director of OSMO. He further submitted that from the evidence collected by the
EOW it is revealed that the manipulation in the tenders was done by using the user ID PT4 and
Bidder ID QK29846 which were provided to OSMO in the year 2016. The IP address registered
while creating the said demo file was 27.60.163.98 and 27.60.185.14, which were found linked with
mobile No.9755092919. The SIM of this mobile number was registered in the name co-accused
Vinay Choudhary and was being used by co-accused Varun Chaturvedi. It is also revealed that digital
signature certificate of Keshav Rao 7 MCRC-26178-2020 Uike and Praveen Guru were registered by
applicant Sumeet Golwalkar, who was the Marketing Director of OSMO and was also a partner in
Shricon Multi Infra along with co-accused Vinay Choudhary and Avinash K. Choudhary (brother of
Vinay Choudhary). Sarothia Velji, who was made L1 bidder by manipulating the bids, transferred
money in the account of Shricon Multi Infra Developers, which shows the nexus of the applicant in
the crime. He further submitted that there are transactions between Shricon Multi Infra Developers
and Milestone Builders belonging to Manish Khare, who is also an accused in the present case. From
the memorandum of Manish Khare recorded by the police under Section 27 of the Cr.P.C. It is
revealed that Sarothia Velji gave money to him regarding manipulation in the bids and he
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/69825826/ 4
Sumeet Golwalkar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 17 March, 2021
transferred that amount in the account of Shricon Multi Infra. It is further revealed that money was
also deposited in the account of Avinash Enterprises belonging to Avinash Choudhary, the brother
of co-accused Vinay Choudhary. The amount was also deposited by Sorathia Velji and Mantena
Infra. The said companies are also accused in the present crime and have benefited by the bid
manipulation. The earlier two bail applicants filed by the applicant were dismissed on merit and
thereafter there is no change in circumstance, except custody period of the applicant. So the
applicant should not be released on bail.
12. The earlier bail applications filed by applicant were dismissed on merit by this Court vide orders
dated 25/06/2019 & 31/10/2019 passed in M.Cr.C.Nos.19786/2019 & 40800/2019 respectively and
thereafter there is no change in circumstance except custody period of the applicant. Hon'ble Apex
Court in the case of Rajesh Ranjan Yadav alias Pappu Yadav v. CBI Through its Director, (2007) 1
SCC 70 held that bail, cannot be granted solely on the ground of long incarnation in jail and inability
of accused to conduct the defence. Apex Court in the case of State of M.P. v. Kajad, (2001) 7 SCC 673
observed "It is true that successive bail applications are permissible under the changed
circumstances. But without the change in the 8 MCRC-26178-2020 circumstances, the second
application would be deemed to be seeking review of the earlier judgment which is not permissible
under criminal law as has been held by this Court in Hari Singh Mann v. Harbhajan Singh Bajwa
[(2001) 1 SCC 169 : 2001 SCC (Cri) 113] and various other judgments."
13. In the instant case, prima facie it is revealed that Online bidding processes were rigged to favour
a few private players. E- Procurement portal was tampered in nine tendering processes to provide
benefits to five private companies, which were based in Hyderabad, Mumbai, Baroda and Bhopal.
They include GVPR Ltd, Max Mantena Ltd, The Hume Pipe Ltd, JMC Ltd and Sorthiya Belji Pvt Ltd.
The allegation against the applicant is that the digital signature certificate of Praveen Guru and
Keshav Rao Uike were registered by applicant Sumeet Golwalkar, who was the Employee of OSMO
and the manipulation in the bids was done by using DSC of Praveen Guru and Keshav Rao Uikey.
Applicant was also partner in Shricon Multi Infra along with co-accused Vinay Choudhary and
Avinash K. Choudhary (brother of Vinay Choudhary). Sarothia Velji, who was made L1 bidder by
manipulating the bids, transferred money in the account of Shricon Multi Infra Developers, which
prima facie shows the nexus of applicant in the crime. Such scams will not only send a wrong
message to the society but also affect the credibility of the Government authorities. It has also
shaken the confidence of the general public in the functioning of the Government and gave the
impression that everything is possible by manipulation. So such acts should be dealt with severely. It
is alleged that applicant is one of the main accused person of the crime who committed
manipulation in the bids and gained a huge amount of money from the firm which they made the
lowest bidder by manipulation.
14. So looking to the seriousness of the crime and the contention of the learned counsel of the EOW,
this Court is not inclined to grant bail to the applicant.
15. Hence, the application is hereby dismissed.
