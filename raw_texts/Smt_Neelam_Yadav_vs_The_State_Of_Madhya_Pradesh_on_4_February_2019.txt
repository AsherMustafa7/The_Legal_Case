[iii]. Crime No.505/2015 under Section 160 of IPC, is registered at Police Station Cant Jabalpur. The
date of incident is mentioned as 09.11.2015 and challan No.410/2015 was filed before JMFC,

Smt. Neelam Yadav vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 4 February, 2019
5. As averred in the writ petition that the husband of the petitioner having some altercation with the
Excise Officer against registration of case under Section 34(2), 40 of M.P. Excise Act on 30.08.2018.
The detenu remanded by the Court and sent to judicial custody. Thereafter, police initiated National
Security Act proceeding against the detenu without giving opportunity of hearing to detenu and
without adducing evidence of witness, the respondent No.2 passed the detention order on
11.10.2018 for a period of three months. The detenu was in jail since 30.08.2018 in connection with
Crime No.197/2018 punishable under Section 34(2) and 40 of M.P. Excise Act. The detention order
is perverse and illegal because during detention order detenu Krishna alias Kanhiya Yadav was in
jail. The ground mentioned in para Nos. 1 to 9 is stale and it is not relevant for forming the
subjective satisfaction of detaining authority. The cases referred against the detenu are minor in
nature and without any subjective satisfaction, aforesaid cases have been imposed by the police due
to political motivation. The grounds as mentioned in the detention order by detaining authority are
illegal and perverse because the act of detenu is not disturbing the society to the extent of causing a
general disturbance of public tranquility and act of detenu had no effect on the public or community
at large and cannot be held to have disturbance in the public order. The detaining authority did not
send his order for confirmation before respondent No.1 and the detenu is not produced before the
Advisory Board during the day of filing of petition, therefore, the order is perverse and liable to be
quashed. The petitioner has also mentioned some case laws in para-6(K) and said that the order of
detention is bad in eyes of law due to principle laid down by the High Court and Hon'ble Supreme
Court. Therefore, it is prayed that the order of detention be quashed and the detenu be directed to
release from custody.
6. The respondents have filed their return as I.A. No.15921/2018 on 04.12.2018. The respondents
have drawn attention of the Court towards Section 3(2) of National Security Act, 1980 and said that
the SHO Gorabazar has A.F.R. submitted a report No. 1606/2018 dated 17.09.2018, alongwith
criminal record and a list of witnesses and the copy of rojnamcha before Superintendent of Police,
Jabalpur stated in that petitioner's husband is involved in illegal activities and there is terror in the
police and local area because of that the maintenance of peace in that area has become difficult.
Upon the basis of the aforesaid report, the Superintendent of Police, Jabalpur submitted a report on
5.10.2018 to the District Magistrate and said that the petitioner's husband is a hardened criminal
and he alongwith companion abused the persons who are residing under the police area and also did
marpit and also threatened to death. He has a habit to sale and keep illegal liquor and because of
which, criminal offence has been registered against him and, therefore, peace is not maintained in
that area of Police Station Gorabazar. The petitioner is an active criminal. His name has also been
registered in the Gunda list. It is also mentioned that detenu has habit of roaming in the area at
night along with his active friends. He also assaulted the government servant. District Magistrate,
Jabalpur after considering the police report has found that to stop the crime and to maintain peace
in the district and to provide peaceful environment to the general public living in the area, it is
necessary to pass the detention order against the petitioner. The ground for detention has also been
supplied to the petitioner. The District Magistrate, Jabalpur has issued a jail warrant against the
petitioner, which has been duly served upon the petitioner, therefore, the contention of the
petitioner is that the detention order cannot be passed, if the petitioner is already in jail is
misconceived. Upon the aforesaid ground, it is requested that the petition is liable to be dismissed.
No case is made out warranting interference of this Court in exercise of its extra ordinary writ
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/134644174/ 4
Smt. Neelam Yadav vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 4 February, 2019
jurisdiction.
7. It is submitted by petitioner that without giving opportunity of hearing to detenu and without
adducing evidence of witness, the respondent No.2 passed the detention order. This argument
having no any force. Another D.B. of this court, by order dated 22.07.2016 passed in W.P. No. 10476
of 2016 "Ankur Mishra Vs. State of M.P.", held that there is no requirement to give prior notice or
opportunity of hearing before passing a detention order.
8. In this case on 12.12.2018, the Court directed to the Superintendent of Police, Jabalpur, SHO of
concerned Police Station to file an affidavit indicating therein that the detaining authority was aware
of the fact that the detenu was already in custody at the time of passing of the order dated 11.10.2018
and also give details about date of arrest of detenu and as to whether he has been granted bail or not
? In response to the aforesaid order the respondent filed a compliance report bearing I.A.
No.16776/2018 on 19.12.2018. It is stated in the report that the accused / detenu was arrested on
30.08.2018 in another crime No.197/2018 under Section 34(2) and 40 of Excise Act and also
arrested on 31.08.2018 in connection with Crime No.248/2018 for the offence punishable under
Sections 294, 323, 186, 332, 353 and 506/34 of IPC. In Crime No.248/2018 he was enlarged on bail
vide order dated 10.10.2018 passed by High Court in M.Cr.C. No.38069/2018, but he did not
furnish bail bond. In Crime No.197/2018 bail was not granted, therefore, the petitioner/detenu is
confined in custody since 30.08.2018. In this reply, it is also mentioned that the respondents are
relying on para Nos. 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the order passed by the Division Bench of this Court. In case of
Chhenu alias Yunus Vs. State of M.P. reported in 2011 (1) MPWN 50, wherein the Court after relying
on catena of judgments of Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the order of detention can be passed
against the person who is already in jail in some other offence subject to if the authority passing the
order is aware of the fact that he is actually in custody. It is also submitted that the detenu was
granted bail by High Court but he failed to furnish the bail bond and is continuing in jail. The order
was served upon him in jail on 13.10.2018.
9. It is an admitted position in this case that the detenu was arrested on 30.08.2018 in connection
with Crime No.197/2018 and on 31.08.2018 in connection with Crime No.248/2018. The detention
order has been passed on 11.10.2018. Therefore, when the order was passed, the detenu was already
in jail. The detention order was passed upon the basis of report dated 17.09.2018 given by Police
Station Gorabazar. Station Incharge Gorabazar submitted his report No.1588/2018 dated
17.09.2018 to the Superintendent of Police and the Superintendent of Police submitted his report
No.S.P./JBP/NSA/16/18 dated 05.10.2018 to District Magistrate, Jabalpur, who passed the order of
detention on 11.10.2018.
10. Learned counsel for the petitioner strongly raised a ground that the detention order cannot be
passed because on the date of passing of the aforesaid order the detenu was already in jail.
A.F.R.
11. Sub-section (2) of Section 3 of the Act confers power to make an order of detention with a view to
preventing any person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of the State or from
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/134644174/ 5
Smt. Neelam Yadav vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 4 February, 2019
acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order, etc. A preventive action
postulates that if preventive step is not taken the person sought to be prevented may indulge in any
activity prejudicial to the maintenance of public order. In other words, unless the activity is
interdicted by a preventive detention order the activity which is being indulged in is likely to be
repeated. This is the postulate of the section. And this undoubtedly transpires from the language
employed in Sub-section (2) which says that the detention order can be made with a view to,
preventing the person sought to be detained from acting in an manner prejudicial to the
maintenance of public order. Now, if it is shown that the man sought to be prevented by a preventive
order is already effectively prevented, the power under Sub-section (2) of Section 3, if exercised,
would imply that one who is already prevented is sought to be further prevented which is not the
mandate of the section. An order for preventive detention is made on the subjective satisfaction of
the Detaining Authority. The Detaining Authority before exercising the power of preventive
detention would take into consideration the past conduct or antecedent history of the person and as
a matter of fact it is largely from the prior events showing, the tendencies or inclinations of a man
that an inference could be drawn whether he is likely even in the future to act in a manner
prejudicial to the maintenance of public order. If the subjective satisfaction of the Detaining
Authority leads to this conclusion it can put an end to the activity by making a preventive detention
order. In Rameshwar Shaw v. District Magistrate, Burdwan, MANU/SC/0041/1963 : AIR 1964 SC
334, the Constitution Bench considered the question: "Can a person in jail custody be served with an
order of detention whilst he is in such custody ?" In this context, the Bench held that as an abstract
proposition of law, there may not be any doubt that Section 3(1)(a) does not preclude the Authority
from passing an order of detention against a person whilst he is in detention or in jail; but the
relevant facts in connection with the making of the order may differ It was observed thus:
"Whether the detention of the said person would be necessary after he is released
from jail, and if the authority is bonafide satisfied that such detention is necessary, he
can make a valid order of detention a few days before the person is likely to be
released."
Same view has been reiterated in subsequent decisions of the Supreme Court. [See: Sanjay Kumar
Agarwal v. Union of India, MANU/SC/0461/1990 :
(1990) 3 SCC 309, N. Meera Rani v. Government of Tamil Nadu,

1982 Cri.L.J. 988 [17.03.1988] detention order dated July 11, 1981 made by the District Magistrate,
Jammu in exercise of the power conferred by Section 8 of The Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety
Act, 1978. The detenu Vijay Kumar was arrested on June 26, 1981. The detenu was served with the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/134644174/ 6
Smt. Neelam Yadav vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 4 February, 2019
detention order dated July 11, 1981 on the same day in jail because he was already in jail from June
25, 1981. The grounds for detention were served on him on July 15, 1981. The contention of
petitioner was that the order of the District Magistrate suffers from nonapplication of mind
inasmuch as the date on which he passed the impugned order of detention dated July 11, 1981, the
detenu was long before arrested and locked up in Jail on the allegation that he was suspected to
have committed some offence under the Enemy Agents Ordinance 8 of Samvat Year 2005, and,
therefore there was no present apprehension that the detenu, if not detained, was likely to act in any
manner prejudicial to the security of the State. The District Magistrate passed the impugned order
of detention on being satisfied that with a view to preventing the detenu from acting in a manner
prejudicial to the security of the State it was necessary to detain him. The order ex facie does not
show that the detaining authority was aware that the detenu was already arrested and kept in jail. If
the detaining authority was conscious of the fact that the detenu was already arrested and confined
in jail, the order exfacie would have shown that even though the detenu was in jail, with a view to
preventing him from acting in a manner prejudicial to the security of the State it was necessary to
detain him. The Apex court held ( in para 9 of Cri.L.J.) that :-
"............Preventive detention is resorted to, to thwart future action. If the detenu is
already in jail charged with a serious offence, he is thereby prevented from acting in a
manner prejudicial to the security of the State. May be, in a given case there yet may
be the need to order preventive detention of a person already in jail. But in such a
situation the detaining authority must disclose awareness of the fact that the person
against whom an order of preventive A.F.R. detention is being made is to the
knowledge of the authority already in jail and yet for compelling reasons a preventive
detention order needs to be made. There is nothing to indicate the awareness of the
detaining authority that detenu was already in jail and yet the impugned order is
required to be made. This, in our opinion, clearly exhibits nonapplication of mind
and would result in invalidation of the order."
13. The similar issue had come up before the Division Bench of this Court in the matter of Chhenu @
Yunus vs. State of M. P. and another, reported in MANU/MP/0478/2010 : 2010(4) MPL J 253 =
2011(1) MPHT 208. In this case The District Magistrate, Ujjain, passed the detention order on the
March 3, 2010, directing that the Petitioner should be detained. The Order recites that the District
Magistrate was satisfied that it was necessary to detain the Petitioner with a view to prevent him
from acting in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order. This order was served on the
Petitioner on March 3, 2010. The grounds of detention were served on 4-3-2010. After getting
positive report from the Advisory Board, State Government passed the Order dated April 19, 2010
under Section 12 of the Act confirming the detention order for a period of twelve months. According
to Learned Counsel for Petitioner the detenu was already in jail when he was served with the
detention order. After taking note of the judgment of the Supreme Court in the matter of Sanjay
Kumar Agarwal vs. Union of India, reported in MANU/SC/0461/1990 : (1990) 3 SCC 309, N. Meera

Smt. Neelam Yadav vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 4 February, 2019
SCC 1, Veeramani vs. State of Tamil Nadu, reported in MANU/SC/0632/1994 : JT 1994(1) SC 350,
the Division Bench of this Court held thus :--
"9. From the catena of decisions of Supreme Court it is clear that even in the case of a
person in custody, a detention order can validly be passed if the authority passing the
order is aware of the fact that he is actually in custody: if he has reason to believe on
the basis of the reliable material that there is a possibility of his being released on bail
and that on being so released, the detenu would in all probabilities indulge in
prejudicial activities and if the authority passes an order after recording his
satisfaction the same cannot be struck down."
In Para 7 the D.B. also said that the question as to whether an order of detention can be passed
against a person who is in detention or in jail, will always have to be determined in the
circumstances of each case. In the aforesaid case the Division Bench of this Court found that nothing
was produced to show that the detaining authority was aware of the fact that the detenu was already
in jail, therefore, the detention order was held to be invalid by observing :--
"12. The impugned detention order does not give the slightest indication that the
Detaining Authority was aware that the detenu was already in jail and yet on the
material placed before him he was satisfied that a detention order ought to be made.
There is nothing in the order to show that to the knowledge of the Detaining
Authority the detenu was already in jail before the date on which he passed the order
and that such detention in the opinion of the Detaining Authority was not sufficient
to prevent the detenu from acting in a manner prejudicial to the security of the State,
and, therefore, power under section 3(2) of the Act is required to be exercised. The
reply and affidavit of the District Magistrate does not throw any light on the vexed
question whether the Detaining Authority was aware of the fact that the detenu on
being suspected of having committed a serious offence, was already in jail. There is
nothing to indicate the awareness of the Detaining Authority that detenu was already
in jail and yet the impugned order was made. This, in our opinion, clearly exhibits
non-application of mind and would result in invalidation of the order.
13. In view of the foregoing discussion we allow this writ petition and quash the
detention order dated March 3, 2010 and the subsequent confirmation order dated
April 19, 2010 and direct that the detenu Chhenu alias Yunus be released
immediately from the custody if he is not required in any other cause. Order
accordingly."

detention order dated 17.02-2010 was passed against him under Section 3(2) of the Act and he was
taken in detention on 22.02.2010. He was served with the detention order and grounds of detention
along with the documents on 22.02.2010. The case was sent for approval of the Government on
17.02.2010 and the State Government granted approval on 26.02.2010 and the information was sent
to the Central Government on 02.03.2010. The case was sent to the Advisory Board on 3.3.2010 and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/134644174/ 8
Smt. Neelam Yadav vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 4 February, 2019
the Advisory Board gave its opinion and thereafter the order confirming the detention order was
passed on 15.04.2010. It was contended that the Petitioner No. 1 was already in jailfor offence under
Section 302 of I.P.C. and the detention order has been passed without application of mind and that
there is no material to indicate that the Petitioner No. 1 is indulging in any activity from inside the
jail to disturb public order. The court said in para 6 that it is the settled position in law that
detention A.F.R. of a person without a trial is a very serious encroachment on his personal freedom
and at all stage all questions in relation to the detention are required to be carefully and solemnly
considered. Since the preventive detention is a serious inroad into the freedom of individuals,
therefore, reason, purposes and the manner of such detention is subject to closest scrutiny and
examination. Court also quote the following lines of Shafiq Ahmad v. District Magistrate, Meerut
and Ors., reported in MANU/SC/0491/1989 : (1989) 4 SCC 556, related to scope of judicial review:
"Hence, there must be conduct relevant to the formation of the satisfaction having
reasonable nexus with the action of the Petitioner which are prejudicial to the
maintenance of public order. Existence of materials relevant to the formation of the
satisfaction and having rational nexus to the formation of the satisfaction that
because of certain conduct "it is necessary" to make an order "detaining" such person,
are subject to judicial review."
Thereafter the Court said in para 8 :
"It is the settled position in law that the authorities are not precluded from passing an
order of detention when the person concerned is in jail, but while passing the order of
detention, they are required to apply their mind to the fact that the person concerned
is already in jail and there are compelling reasons justifying such detention despite
the fact that the detenu was already in detention and the compelling reasons implies
that there must be cogent material before the Detaining Authority on the basis of
which it may be satisfied that the detenu is likely to be released from custody in the
near future or taking into account the nature of the antecedent activities of the
detenu, it is likely that after his release from custody he would indulge in prejudicial
activities and it is necessary to detain him in order to prevent him from engaging in
such activities. The aforesaid proposition in law is supported by the judgments of the
Supreme Court in the matter of Abdul Razak Abdul Wahab Sheikh v. S.N. Sinha,
Commissioner of Police, Ahmedabad and Anr., reported in MANU/SC/0007/1989 :
(1989) 2 SCC 222; in the matter of N. Meera Rani v. Government of Tamil Nadu and
Anr., reported in MANU/SC/0381/1989 : (1989) 4 SCC 418; and in the matter of
Dharmendra Suganchand Chelawal v. Union of India and Ors., reported in
MANU/SC/0226/1990 : (1990) 1 SCC 746."
The D.B. held in para 9 that the order has been passed without application of mind and said :
"In the present case the Respondents have noted the fact that the Petitioner No. 1 is
in jail but there is no application of mind by the Respondents in respect of the
possibility of the release of the Petitioner No. 1 on bail in respect of the offence of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/134644174/ 9
Smt. Neelam Yadav vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 4 February, 2019
Section 302, IPC and other connected offences for which he is already in jail. The
detention order and the grounds of detention do not mention if the Petitioner No. 1
had applied for grant of bail and what was its but come. Thus, the detention based on
Ground No. 40 cannot be sustained having been passed without application of mind
on this aspect."
15. In the case of Bhagwan Singh @ Choti Vs. State of M.P., 2012 (III) MPWN 37 [DB] the detention
order was passed by D.M. Ujjain on 18.01.2012 on which the petitioner was already in Jail in
connection with the crime No. 446 of 2011 under sections 323, 365, 368, 120(B), 506, 395, 397,
364A R/w 34 of IPC. The D.B. took the note of Chhenu @ Yunus vs. State of M. P. and another,
2010(4) MPL J 253 = 2011(1) MPHT 208 and examined the matter in the light of the observation
made by Supreme Court in Vijay Kumar Vs. State of Jammu & Kashmir and Ors., AIR 1982 SC 1023,
and queshed the order and said in para 8 that :-
"...........We find that there is no indication in the order to the effect that the detaining
authority was aware that the detenu was already in custody and that he has reason to
believe on the basis of reliable material that there is a possibility of his being released
on bail and that on being so released the detenu would in all probabilities indulge in
prejudicial activities and for compailing reasons a preventive detention order need to
be made."
16. Therefore it is the settelled position of law that the authorities are not precluded from passing an
order of detention when the person concerned is in jail, but while passing the order of detention,
they are required to apply their mind to the fact that the person concerned is already in jail and
there are compelling reasons justifying such detention despite the fact that the detenu was already
in detention and the compelling reasons implies that there must be cogent material before the
Detaining Authority on the basis of which it may be satisfied that the detenu is likely to be released
from custody in the near future or taking into account the nature of the antecedent activities of the
detenu, it is likely that after his release from custody he would indulge in prejudicial activities and it
is necessary to detain him in order to prevent him from engaging in such activities.
17. Whether the aforesaid requirements are fulfilled in this case or not ? In this regard the
respondents tried to convenience the Court that the detaining authority was aware of the fact that
the accused is already in jail. He draws our attention towards the report submitted by the
Superintendent of Police and argued that, in the report, it was mentioned that the detenu has been
arrested in A.F.R. Crime No.197/2018 and has been sent to the judicial custody. It was also
mentioned that on 30.08.2018 the detenu was arrested in connection with Crime No.248/2018 and
sent to the judicial custody. As per respondent the detenu was arrested in connection with Crime
No.248/2018 and 197/2018 and was confined in custody. But the aforesaid fact is not reflected from
the order passed by the detaining authority. In the order dated 11.10.2018, it is mentioned that :-
"it is necessary to detain him under Sub Section (2) of Section 3 of the National
Security Act. 1980". ¼jk"Vªh; lqj{kk vf/kfu;e 1980 dh /kkjk 3 dh mi/kkjk ¼2½ ds

In para No.2, it is mentioned that:-
"may be so detained and kept in Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Central Jail, Jabalpur"
(dks fu:) fd;k tkdj dsUnzh; tsy tcyiqj esa j[kk tkos).
In para No.3 of the order, it is mentioned that:-
"This order will be valid for a period of upcoming 03 (three) months from the date of
actual detention" (;g vkns'k vukosnd dks fu:) fd;s tkus dh okLrfod frfFk ls vkxkeh 03
¼rhu½ ekg dh vof/k ds fy;s cS/k gksxk).
18. The aforesaid quoted portion of the order shows that the detaining authority did not took the
notice of the fact that the detenu is already in custody. We have minutely perused the impugned
order dated 11.10.2018 passed by District Magistrate. In the said impugned order, it is not mention
that the accused was in jail at the time of passing of the said order. It is not reflected from the said
order that the detaining authority was aware of the fact that the accused was in jail at the time of
passing of the said order. No any such material has been produced before this Court to establish
such facts. Therefore, the impugned order clearly indicates the non application of mind by the
detaining authority in respect of the possibility of the release of the Petitioner. Since, the detaining
authority was not made aware of the fact that the accused was in custody in relation to the
investigation in two criminal cases, therefore, the detaining authority had no occasion to apply his
mind in respect of possibility of the accused being released on bail and the probability of his
involvement in such activities after release on bail. It is not clear from the order passed by the
detaining authority that it was in the notice of the authority that the detenu was already in jail since
30.08.2018 otherwise the authority will not mention in para-3 that "this order will be valid for a
period of upcoming 03 (three) months from the date of actual detention".
Before about 40 days back, the detenu was in custody, therefore, the satisfaction of the authority
was required and should be mentioned in the order passed, but the authority passed the order in
mechanical way by using a set proforma. Order did not fulfill the requirement of the law and the
principle laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court and the High Court.
19. The petitioner also filed some documents in relation to the result of criminal cases mentioned in
the grounds of detention order. The case mentioned at Sr. No.(ii) (In para No.vii of this order) was
the Criminal Case No.6072/2014, in which judgment has been passed by JMFC, Jabalpur on
01.06.2015. It appears from the judgment that the offence under Sections 294, 336, 427 and 506-II
IPC were compromised and the Court passed the order of acquittal only in the offence under Section
336 of IPC. In case No.2359/2011, fine of Rs.1000/- has been imposed under Section 34 (A)and 34
(g) of excise act on 16.03.2011.
20. Therefore, it appears from the aforesaid documents that two cases mentioned in the grounds of
detention were already disposed of . Two cases are recently registered on 30.08.2018 as Crime
No.248/2018 and Crime No.197/2018, in which accused was in custody. Remaining two cases are
related to Excise Act and Sec.160 of IPC, registered in 2014-15. There is no any information whether
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/134644174/ 11
Smt. Neelam Yadav vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 4 February, 2019
these cases are pending or not. Therefore, at the time of passing the detention order only two cases
were in existence and both were recently registered on 30.08.2018. Both the cases arise out of same
transaction. As such the allegation made against the accused are of trivial nature and do not admit
of grave and serious offence having implication of serious repercussions on the life and liberty of
larger section of community causing disturbance even tempo of life and liberty of the community so
that same may be classified as the Act of the intended to subvert the public order. We find that in the
ground of detention there is no other material referred to which would justify the apprehension of
detaining authority that the accused is engaged in a manner to subvert public order or that the
witnesses were not coming forward to depose against him due to fear and more so that the accused
is likely to engage himself in the activities, which may affect public order. In absence of any
contemporaneous material in this behalf it is unfathomable as to how subjective satisfaction reached
by the detaining authority regarding involvement of the petitioner in subversion of public order can
be justified. Therefore, such sporadic A.F.R. and stale instances referred to and relied upon the
detaining authority are of trivial in nature cannot be construed to have the potential of causing
threat to maintenance of public order. These are the instances, at best of breach of law and order
and they did not establish any live and proximity link to the threat of public order nor does it pass
the test of detention order passed for the right purpose. The nature of allegations with reference to
the alleged offences are of the nature, which can be dealt with under the powers to maintain law and
order. They are not of such a nature, which may be perceived to have the intensity of causing threat
to public order.
21. The respondent also placed reliance upon Kamla Bai Vs. Commissioner of Police, Nagpur and
Others, reported in (1993) 3 SCC 384 and submits that registration of Crime No.248/2018 is
sufficient to justify the order of detention on 30.08.2018. The accused committed marpit with the
District Excise Officer, G.S. Maravi and created obstruction in discharging the official duty of Shri
Maravi and other Official of the Excise Department, when they were discharging their duty and
trying to seize the liquor. During the proceeding of Crime No.197/2018, the accused attacked upon
officer of excise department, therefore, one case Crime No.197/2018 registered under Excise Act as
Crime No.197/2018 and another case registered under Sections 294, 323, 186, 332, 353 and 506/34
of IPC as Crime No.248/2018 .
22. In the case of Kamla Bai (supra) the detenu catch hold the police ASI and threatened him in a
public place when S.I attempt to effect arrest of detenu and detenu associates and seizure of liquor
bottles being sold. It is also mentioned in para-3 of the aforesaid judgment that on 01.02.1992 at
about 9:45, when the Police Sub Inspector was patrolling, he saw people gathered near detenu's
stable and on seeing him they tried to run away. The Sub Inspector caught hold one of them, who
admitted that he was selling illicit liquor in the detenu's stable and thereafter Sub Inspector took
search of the stable and found liquor bottles. When Sub Inspector was about to take the arrested
person and the liquors bottles the detenu and his associates came there, questioned the Sub
Inspector and forcefully broke the liquor bottle on the spot when Sub Inspector told them that he
was performing duty, the detenu threatened him that they finish him, if he does not act according to
their wishes. So saying the detenu caught hold of the Sub Inspector and surrounded him. The Sub
Inspector however, got release and went to Police Station. This act and conduct of detenu was
considered to be nothing but display of Gundaism, by the detaining authority. The Court said that :-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/134644174/ 12
Smt. Neelam Yadav vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 4 February, 2019
" ..... We cannot say that this is a stray act affecting law and order. Catching hold of a
Sub Inspector and threatening him in public place like that naturally would have
created panic in the locality. We cannot say the ground has no nexus to the public
order".
23. In this case particulars of Crime No.197/2018 and 248/2018 have not been mentioned in the
ground of detention. In the report of Superintendent of Police the position is the same. Whether the
aforesaid crime was committed in public place or not, it is not clear. Most the cases registered
against the petitioner were related to Excise Act. Any offence related to public was not registered.
The offence under IPC were related to the specific person not to the public and the aforesaid person
entered in the compromise and the accused was acquitted in that offence. Therefore, the case of
Kamla Bai (supra) does not help the respondents.
24. In view of the foregoing discussion we allow this writ petition and quash the detention order
dated 11.10.2018 and direct that the detenu Krishna @ Kanhaiya Yadav be released immediately
from the custody, if he is not required in any other case. Order accordingly.
