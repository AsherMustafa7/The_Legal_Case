Moti Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 17 May, 2019
2. The prosecution case, in brief, is that 45 days prior to the date of incident, a quarrel took place
between Roop Singh Thakur of village Rusalla with Pappu, thereafter, Roop Singh went to his house
alongwith his family members and threatened him that he would kill him. On the date of incident,
Pappu alongwith Munna and Balram (complainant) had gone to the temple Raikhedi for taking
blessings (Prasad). When they were coming back at about 6:00 p.m. and reached near tank of
Rusalla village, then Roop Singh, Arvind and Sunil armed with Lathi and Santosh with Ballam
reached there. Seeing the accused persons, Pappu ran away, then Roop Singh, Arvind and Sunil
have started beating Balram and Munna, thereafter they followed Pappu. Moti Singh, Bakhat Singh,
Bhure, Niranjan, Raju, Sanju, Rajkumar, Pran Singh and Surendra were armed with Lathi, Ballam
and Lohangi encircled Pappu and assaulted him. The accused went away leaving Pappu
unconscious, assuming he was dead. The persons passing-by intimated father of Balram, who came
alongwith some villagers and together they reached Police Station Rahatgarh, District Sagar to lodge
the FIR. The FIR was registered and investigation was conducted. In the said incident, Pappu was
murdered and as such, charge-sheet was submitted by the prosecution.
3 Criminal Appeal Nos.435/2009, 596/2009, 697/2009 & 699/2009
3. In trial, the prosecution has examined as many as 17 witnesses, out of those, PW-6 (Balram) and
PW-8 (Munna) have been produced as eyewitnesses, who had also suffered injuries in the incident.
4. As per the statement of eyewitnesses PW-6 (Balram) and PW-8 (Munna), the accused/appellants
were armed with Lathi, Ballam and Lohangi and were the members of unlawful assembly, assaulted
Munna, Balram and Pappu (deceased).
5. As per the statement of PW-5 (Dr. R Rajiv Kumar and PW-7 (Dr. Jitesh Diwakar) there were
several injuries found over the body of PW-6 (Balram) and PW-8 (Munna) and also on the body of
the deceased Pappu. As per their statement, after examining the injured persons and also
conducting postmortem of the body of the deceased Pappu, all injuries were found to have been
caused by hard and blunt object. The cause of death was shown as hemorrhagic shock due to injuries
received over the body and damage got to the blood vessels. As per the statement of the doctors, the
injuries caused to PW-6 (Balram) and PW-8 (Munna) were not of grievous nature and were not
dangerous to life. Accordingly, the trial Court has found that the offence under Section 325/149 of
the Indian Penal Code is made out against the appellants for causing injuries to PW-6 (Balram) and
PW-8 (Munna). As per the injuries caused to the deceased Pappu and as per the witnesses 4
Criminal Appeal Nos.435/2009, 596/2009, 697/2009 & 699/2009 produced by the prosecution,
offence under Section 302/149 of the Indian Penal Code is found proved against the
accused/appellants.
6. The trial Court relied upon the testimony of eye witnesses PW-6 (Balram) and PW-8 (Munna).
The Investigating Officer, PW-15 (R.K.S. Chouhan) was also examined, who supported the case of
the prosecution and stated that the FIR Ex.P-22 was registered at the instance of PW-6 (Balram) on
22.08.2008 vide Crime No.359/2007 and thereafter Pappu, Munna and Balram were sent to the
Government Hospital Rahatgarh for their treatment. Marg intimation vide Marg Case No.56/2007
(Ex.P-30) was also registered in view of the information given by Constable Damodar. The trial
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/136359638/ 2
Moti Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 17 May, 2019
Court also relied upon the statement of PW-5 (Dr. R. Rajiv Kumar) who had examined injured
Balram and found that there were 6 injuries over his body and all the injuries were caused by hard
and blunt object. He had also examined injured Munna and prepared the MLC (Ex.P-19) describing
that there were four injuries, which were simple in nature and caused by hard and blunt object. The
Autopsy Surgeon (PW-5) prepared the postmortem report (Ex.P-27), found 18 injuries over the body
of the deceased and the cause of death was due to hemorrhagic shock. The trial Court found that
there is nothing produced by the defence which makes the prosecution story doubtful and also
observed that the defence taken by the accused/appellants 5 Criminal Appeal Nos.435/2009,
596/2009, 697/2009 & 699/2009 cannot be relied upon.
7. The learned counsel for the appellants have assailed the impugned judgment by contending that
there are material contradictions in the statement of the eye witnesses. They have pointed out that
as per the FIR, it was lodged at about 21:25 p.m., whereas the Investigation Officer, PW-15 (R.K.S.
Chouhan) has stated that he reached the spot at about 10-11 p.m., it makes the FIR suspicious. They
have also contended that MLC did not contain the names of the accused as to who had caused the
injuries, and that the marg intimation reflects to have been recorded at about 11:15 p.m., whereas in
the FIR there is no description about such marg intimation, but in the FIR in which the names of
accused are mentioned, is nothing but an afterthought. They have also drawn attention of this Court
towards the statements of the eyewitnesses saying that they have given names of only four persons
who had assaulted but there was no evidence adduced by the prosecution to show that the other
persons have also caused injuries to the deceased as also, that the trial Court has not properly
appreciated the defence taken by some of the appellants raising their 'plea of alibi' as they were
hospitalized and taking treatment at the time of incident. They further contended that looking to the
injuries caused and weapons used in commission of offence, it is not a case of Section 302 of the IPC
and, therefore, it can be converted into Section 304 (Part-II) of the IPC. The appellants 6 Criminal
Appeal Nos.435/2009, 596/2009, 697/2009 & 699/2009 have placed reliance upon the decisions
reported in 1998 AIR SCW 1775 parties being Rewa Ram Vs. Teja and others, 1993 SCC (Cri) 554
parties being Sarman and others Vs. State of M.P. and 1992 SCC (Cri) 829 parties being Sukhdev
Singh Vs. State of Punjab.
8. Per contra, the learned Government Advocate appearing for the respondent/State has supported
the judgment of the trial Court and contended that it is not a case of Section 304 (Part-II) of IPC but
looking to the injuries caused to the deceased Pappu it is a clear-cut case of homicidal death and the
trial Court has rightly convicted the accused/appellants under Section 302/149 of the IPC. He has
relied upon the decisions reported in (2004) 13 SCC 189 parties being Parsuram Pandey and others
Vs. State of Bihar and (2004) 13 SCC 199 parties being State of M.P. Vs. Deshraj and others.
9. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.
10. As per the statement of injured eyewitness PW-6 (Balram), who has stated in his statement that
when Pappu was assaulted, he was near him and 13 persons were assaulting Pappu (deceased) and
has specified the names and active role of each of the appellants herein.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/136359638/ 3
Moti Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 17 May, 2019
11. Likewise PW-8 (Munna) who is the injured eyewitness of the incident in paragraph-1 of his
statement, has named all the accused persons and then in paragraph-8 he has 7 Criminal Appeal
Nos.435/2009, 596/2009, 697/2009 & 699/2009 stated that all the accused/appellants have
assaulted him. In paragraph-1 of his statement, he has very categorically stated that deceased Pappu
was beaten by all the accused/appellants.
12. As per the statement of two doctors, namely, PW-5 (Dr. R. Rajiv Kumar) and PW-7 (Dr. Jinesh
Diwakar) and the injuries described by them, there were as many as 18 injuries found all over the
body of the deceased Pappu. Merely because some of the accused were armed with Ballam and
Lohangi and no injury was found to have been caused by those weapons, they cannot be given the
benefit because the offence was tried under Section 302/149 of the IPC and they were part of the
unlawful assembly and caused death of the deceased with common object.
13. From the prosecution story, it is clear that there was a quarrel took place between Pappu
(deceased) and Roop Singh and, therefore, on the date of incident though they assaulted PW-6
(Balram) and PW-8 (Munna), who were injured, but did not inflict any injury dangerous to life.
Although, Pappu was murdered and all of the appellants were present on the spot and caused 18
injuries to him, which clearly indicates that the entire incident was pre-planned and they wanted to
murder the deceased Pappu. As per Section 149 of the IPC, it creates a vicarious liability for doing an
unlawful act pursuant to the common object by every member of the assembly. From the
prosecution story which was found proved, it is clear that the 8 Criminal Appeal Nos.435/2009,
596/2009, 697/2009 & 699/2009 presence of all the accused on the spot has been established and
all of them were fully aware of the object that Pappu had to be murdered on that date. As per the
statement of eyewitnesses even after felling down, the deceased was being beaten by the appellants.
Thus, it is not a case, in which, the offence can be converted into Section 304 (Part-II) of the IPC.
The Supreme Court in case of Parsuram Pandey (supra) dealing with the scope of Section 149 of the
IPC has observed as under:-
"12. By virtue of Section 149 IPC every member of an unlawful assembly at the time of
the commission of the offence is guilty of an offence committed by any member of the
unlawful assembly. The section creates constructive or vicarious liability of the
members of the unlawful assembly for unlawful acts committed pursuant to the
common object by any other member of that assembly. The basis of constructive guilt
under Section 149 is mere membership of an unlawful assembly. In a case under
Section 149 the accused if is a member of the unlawful assembly, the common object
of which is to commit a certain crime and if that crime is committed by one or more
members of that assembly every person who happened to be a member of that
assembly would be liable for that criminal act by virtue of his being a member of it,
irrespective of the fact whether he actually committed the act or not. To attract
Section 149 IPC the prosecution must prove that the commission of the offence was
by any member of an unlawful assembly and such offence must have been committed
in prosecution of the common object of the assembly or must be such that the
members of the assembly knew that it was likely to be committed. Unless these three
elements are satisfied by the prosecution the accused cannot be convicted with the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/136359638/ 4
Moti Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 17 May, 2019
aid of Section 149 IPC.
In view of the facts and circumstances of the present case as has already been
discussed hereinabove that each and every member of unlawful assembly had a
common object to kill the deceased and the same has been corroborated with the
injuries sustained.
14. Likewise, in a case of Deshraj (supra), the
9 Criminal Appeal Nos.435/2009, 596/2009, 697/2009 & 699/2009 Supreme Court has again
reiterated the same analogy that when each and every member of the unlawful assembly has a
common object, then it makes immaterial whether he caused a particular injury or not and
considering the scope of Section 149 which imposes vicarious liability on every member of unlawful
assembly, nothing illegal has been done by the Trial Court convicting the appellants taking shelter of
Section 149 of the IPC.
15. Merely because in the marg intimation and MLC, the name of accused persons have not been
disclosed, the prosecution story cannot be doubted and only on this basis, the statement of eye
witnesses cannot be ignored especially in the circumstance when the defence failed to produce any
cogent evidence in their favour. From perusal of the marg intimation report (Ex.-P/30), it reflects
that the name of the deceased has been mentioned whereas, at the very first instance, it was difficult
to ascertain that the deceased Pappu was murdered or only injured. In the marg intimation, it is
mentioned that Roop Singh alongwith other 12 persons assaulted complainant PW-6 (Balram),
PW-8 (Munna) and deceased Pappu, merely on this basis, the case of prosecution cannot be doubted
and the accused/appellants cannot be acquitted. The contention of the learned counsel for the
appellants that as per the legal requirement, in the MLC, the name of the accused has to be shown
and if it is not there, that would carry the impression that the person is innocent who had not been
named in the MLC, 10 Criminal Appeal Nos.435/2009, 596/2009, 697/2009 & 699/2009 has no
substance for the reason that the lapses on the part of investigating agency should not persuade the
Court to reject prosecution's case, when case is substantiated by reliable evidence. Reliance is placed
on the law laid down by the Supreme Court in case of Sukhwinder Singh Vs. State of Punjab
reported in (2014) 12 SCC 490 and the relevant paragraphs of that judgment are reproduced
hereinbelow:-
"17. Similarly, the overwriting in the inquest report is inconsequential. It could be a
mere inadvertent lapse. It could also be a purposeful lapse.
18. But, if such mistakes or lapses are given undue importance every criminal case
will end in acquittal. While it is true that the police should not involve innocent
persons, fabricate evidence and obtain convictions, it is equally true that cases in
which substratum of the prosecution case is strong and substantiated by reliable
evidence, lapses in investigation should not persuade the court to reject the
prosecution case. The court with its vast experience should be quick to notice
mischief if there is any. Incompetent prosecuting agencies or prosecuting agencies
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/136359638/ 5
Moti Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 17 May, 2019
which are driven by extraneous considerations should not be allowed to take the
court for a ride. Particularly in offences relating to women and children, which are on
the rise, the courts will have to adopt a pragmatic approach. No scope must be given
to absurd and fanciful submissions. It is true that there can be no compromise on
basic legal principles, but, unnecessary weightage should not be given to minor errors
or lapses. If courts get carried away by every mistake or lapse of the investigating
agency, the guilty will have a field day. The submissions relating to alleged
overwriting and discrepancies in timings and dates, therefore, are rejected."
16. As far as the defence taken by some of the accused producing DW-1 (Dr. D.P. Singh) and DW-2
(Dr. Vijay Singh) is concerned, it is clear from their statements that they cannot be relied upon
because they did not produce any document to show that the appellants, namely, Surendra Singh,
Pran Singh, Santosh and Bakhat Singh have ever been admitted in their hospital. But on the
contrary, the certificate issued by them contained an advice of bed rest. Even in absence of any such
11 Criminal Appeal Nos.435/2009, 596/2009, 697/2009 & 699/2009 entry made in the hospital
register, it is not possible to ascertain that any patient is admitted and kept for almost five days in
the hospital. DW-1 (Dr. D.P. Singh) has also admitted in his statement that the fitness certificate
also contains the signature of the patient but the fitness certificate (Ex.P-6) issued by the said doctor
had no such column and hence, it did not contain signature of Pran Singh and Surendra Singh. He
has also admitted that he does not maintain any such register in which entries are made regarding
issuance of medical certificate. It makes his statement suspicious and it can be easily presumed that
he was a planted witness; fabricated just to create a false plea of alibi in favour of the appellants.
17. Likewise, DW-2 (Dr. Vijay Singh) who had issued Ex.D-9 to show that Bakhat Singh got admitted
in his hospital from 22.08.2007 to 26.08.2007 but from Ex.D-9, it is clear that the same relates to
advice for bed rest, whereas in paragraph-4 of the statement, he has stated that Bakhat Singh was
discharged on the date when the certificate got issued. It makes the statement of DW-2 suspicious.
He has also stated that so far as Bakhat Singh and Santosh are concerned, they themselves got the
certificate typed, on which, DW-2 had put his signature. Such a statement of doctor is unacceptable
because no doctor would sign any document which is prepared by a patient showing his illness.
Thus, the trial Court has rightly discarded the defence witnesses produced by some of the appellants
just 12 Criminal Appeal Nos.435/2009, 596/2009, 697/2009 & 699/2009 to prove that on the date
of incident, they were not available on the spot.
18. So far as the cases relied upon by the appellants are concerned, in view of the facts and
circumstances of those cases, the same are not applicable in the present case. In a case of Rewa Ram
(supra) there was no charge against the accused persons with regard to their common object and
that of unlawful assembly of which they were the members, therefore, conviction under Section 302
was converted into Section 326 of the IPC particularly when the charge in respect of their common
object was of assaulting Ram Bharose and committing rioting with deadly weapons, but here in this
case, the appellants have been charged under Section 149 of IPC that they were part of unlawful
assembly with a common object to kill the deceased.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/136359638/ 6
Moti Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 17 May, 2019
19. In a case of Sarman (supra), although the accused have been charged with Section 302/149 and
304 (Part-II)/149 of the IPC but as per the evidence lathi blows inflicted by several persons causing
simple injuries on non-vital parts of the body and also causing a depressed fracture of parietal bone,
but the Supreme Court has found that the injuries inflicted upon caused with lathis were of simple
and on non-vital part showing that there was no object to kill the deceased and, therefore, offence
was converted into Section 304 (Part-II)/149 of the IPC, but here in the present case, as discussed
above, the 13 Criminal Appeal Nos.435/2009, 596/2009, 697/2009 & 699/2009 accused gathered
and formed unlawful assembly with a common object to kill the deceased Pappu as there was
previous enmity between the deceased and appellant Roop Singh. Accordingly, the said case is also
not applicable in the present facts and circumstances.
20. In a case of Sukhdev Singh (supra), as per the facts of the case, the deceased was attacked by
four persons, who surrounded and caused his death. Appellant Sukhdev Singh inflicted the injury
with Gandasa near right ear of the deceased. When he fell down, as a result of assault made by
others and that injury was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. The Court has
found that the deceased was surrounded by four persons, each one armed with weapons, attacked
simultaneously, it is difficult to fix the fatal injury near the right ear to the appellants. Accepting the
evidence of the witnesses, it is found that the appellant did not cause injury with the knowledge that
he was likely by such act to cause death and then conviction was converted into Section 304 (Part-
II) of the IPC, but here in the present case it was planned by each and every appellant and they have
formed unlawful assembly with an object to kill the deceased Pappu and, therefore, even after felling
down they caused injuries on each and every part of the body of the deceased. It clearly indicates
their intention to kill the deceased and simultaneously the other injured persons who are eye
witnesses accompanied with the 14 Criminal Appeal Nos.435/2009, 596/2009, 697/2009 &
699/2009 deceased had not been assaulted by the appellants with grievous hurt because they
wanted to kill only Pappu, the deceased person.
21. In view of the discussion made hereinabove and also after considering the law laid down by the
Supreme Court in the above referred cases, it is not a case in which conviction can be converted to
Section 304 (Part-II)/149 of the IPC. It is abundantly clear from the evidence available on record
that the appellants have committed a crime in a planned manner and were intending to murder the
deceased Pappu.
22. Accordingly, we are of the considered view that the trial Court has not committed any material
irregularity while passing the impugned judgment and awarding the conviction to the present
appellants. The prosecution since proved it's case beyond all reasonable doubts, therefore, the
conviction and sentence imposed upon accused/appellants under Section 302/149 of IPC and
Section 325/149 of IPC is, accordingly, upheld.
23. It is seen from the record that the appellants namely, Niranjan, Roop Singh, Moti Singh, Bakhat
Singh and Pran Singh are in jail, although appellants namely, Raju @ Raja Babu, Arvind Singh,
Sunil Singh, Santosh Rajpoot, Surendra Singh and Bhure Singh are on bail. Their bail bonds stand
cancelled and they are directed to be taken into custody forthwith and to surrender before the Trial
Court for serving 15 Criminal Appeal Nos.435/2009, 596/2009, 697/2009 & 699/2009 their
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/136359638/ 7
Moti Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 17 May, 2019
remaining part of jail sentence.
24. Ex consequentia, all these appeals fail and are hereby dismissed.
