CR.A.-8520-2019
(BANTI GURJAR @ DHARAMVEER SINGH Vs THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH)
Gwalior, Dated :14/10/2019
Shri Abhishek Parasar, learned counsel for the appellant.
Shri Aditya Singh Ghuraiya, learned Public Prosecutor for the
respondent-State.
With consent, heard finally.
Present appeal has been filed under Section 14(A)(2) of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes
(Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (hereinafter would be referred as to `the Act') against the order
dated 27/9/2019 passed by Special Judge, Atrocities, District Morena, whereby the anticipatory bail
application of the appellant under Section 438 of Cr.P.C seeking bail has been rejected.
2. The appellant is apprehending his arrest by Police Station Joura, District Morena (M.P.), in
connection with Crime No.554/2019 registered in relation to the offence punishable u/Ss. 294, 323,
324, 34 of IPC and Section 3(1)(n) , 3(1)(/k), 3(2)(v) of Atrocities Act.
3. It is alleged by Counsel for appellant that he has been falsely implicated in the case. He has not
committed the offence in any manner. It is alleged that there is nothing on record to show the Bar
u/S.18 of SC/ST Act. Counsel for the appellant has relied upon the order passed by Co-ordinate
Bench of this Court in the case of CR.A.-8520-2019 (BANTI GURJAR @ DHARAMVEER SINGH Vs
THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH) Atendra Singh Rawat Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh passed in
Criminal Appeal No.7295/18 vide order dated 11-10-2018 and has argued that the case of present
appellant is identical to the aforesaid case. It is further submitted that the appellant is ready to abide
by all the terms and conditions imposed by this court while considering the bail of the appellant. He
has prayed for disposing the bail application in the light of directions issued by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of Arnesh Kumar Vs. State of Bihar, reported in (2014) 8 SCC 273.
5. Per contra counsel for the State has opposed the bail application and has submitted that there is
specific Bar under Section 18-A of SC/ST Act and the application for grant of anticipatory bail is not
maintainable. He has further submitted that it is a named FIR and the allegations against the
appellant is serious in nature. Therefore, he has prayed for dismissal of the criminal appeal.

6. Learned counsel for the rival parties are heard and Case-diary is perused.
7. From perusal of record, it is seen that Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in the case of Atendra
Singh Rawat (supra) has CR.A.-8520-2019 (BANTI GURJAR @ DHARAMVEER SINGH Vs THE
STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH) considered the object of SC/ST Act and the amendment in terms
of Section 18-A of the Act further the concept of life and liberty has been taken into consideration.
The Bench has considered the judgment passed by Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Siddharam
Satlingappa Mhetre Vs. State of Maharashtra and Others, reported in 2011 SC 312 and has allowed
the appeal and has granted the anticipatory bail.
8. At this juncture, it would be appropriate to refer the recent amendment in the 1989 Act by which
Section 18-A was incorporated to the following extent;
"Section 18A (1) For the purpose of this Act,-
(a) preliminary enquiry shall not be required for registration of a First Information
Report against any person; or
(b) the investigating officer shall not require approval for the arrest, if necessary, of
any person, against whom an accusation of having committed an offence under this
Act has been made and no procedure other than that provided under this Act or the
Code shall apply.
(2) The provision of section 438 of the Code shall not apply to a case under this Act,
notwithstanding any judgment or order or direction of any Court."
9. Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Arnesh Kumar Vs. State of Bihar, reported in (2014) 8 SCC
273 and held as under;
"7.1. From a plain reading of the aforesaid provision u/S.41 Cr.P.C., it is evident that a
person accused of an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term which may be
less than CR.A.-8520-2019 (BANTI GURJAR @ DHARAMVEER SINGH Vs THE
STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH) seven years or which may extend to seven years
with or without fine, cannot be arrested by the police officer only on his satisfaction
that such person had committed the offence punishable as aforesaid. A police officer
before arrest, in such cases has to be further satisfied that such arrest is necessary to
prevent such person from committing any further offence; or for proper investigation
of the case; or to prevent the accused from causing the evidence of the offence to
disappear; or tampering with such evidence in any manner; or to prevent such person
from making any inducement, threat or promise to a witness so as to dissuade him
from disclosing such facts to the court or the police officer; or unless such accused
person is arrested, his presence in the court whenever required cannot be ensured.
These are the conclusions, which one may reach based on facts.

7.2. The law mandates the police officer to state the facts and record the reasons in
writing which led him to come to a conclusion covered by any of the provisions
aforesaid, while making such arrest. The law further requires the police officers to
record the reasons in writing for not making the arrest. 7.3. In pith and core, the
police officer before arrest must put a question to himself, why arrest? Is it really
required ? What purpose it will serve ? What object it will achieve ? It is only after
these questions are addressed and one or the other conditions as enumerated above
is satisfied, the power of arrest needs to be exercised. In fine, before arrest first the
police officers should have reason to believe on the basis of information and material
that the accused has committed the offence. Apart from this, the police officer has to
be satisfied further that the arrest is necessary for one or the more purposes
envisaged by sub-clauses (a) to (e) of clause (1) of Section 41 Cr.P.C."
10. Once it is clear from the very language employed by amended section 18-A(1)(a) that all
provisions relating to arrest CR.A.-8520-2019 (BANTI GURJAR @ DHARAMVEER SINGH Vs THE
STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH) under the Cr.P.C. are applicable then the provision of Chapter V of
Cr.P.C. which relates to arrest of person shall apply with full vigor to regulate the process of arrest
adopted by police officer while deciding the question as to whether a person accused of offence
punishable under the 1989 Act is required to be arrested or not.
11. From the aforesaid analysis and the discussions, the accusation made against the appellants
reveals a prima facie case of offence punishable u/S.3(1)(n), 3(1)(/k), 3(2)(v) and therefore statutory
bar contained in Sec.18 of the 1989 Act comes in way of this court to grant anticipatory bail but the
mandatory procedure prescribed in Sec.41-A, 41-B, 41-C and 41-D Cr.P.C. would apply with full
vigor and the pre-conditions contained in Chapter V Cr.P.C. shall have to be satisfied before the
extreme step of arrest can be taken.
12. In view of above and considering the principles laid down by the Apex Court in the case of
Arnesh Kumar (supra) this court without interfering in the impugned order dated 27/09/2019
passed by the court below is inclined to direct thus: -
(i) that, the police may resort to the extreme step of arrest only when the same is
necessary and the appellant fails to cooperate in the investigation.
(ii) that, the appellant should first be CR.A.-8520-2019 (BANTI GURJAR @
DHARAMVEER SINGH Vs THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH) summoned to
cooperate in the investigation. If the appellant cooperate in the investigation then the
occasion of his arrest should not arise.
13. Subject to above modification in the order of the trial court dated 27/09/2019, the appeal stands
disposed of.
14. A copy of this order be sent to the trial court for necessary compliance.
