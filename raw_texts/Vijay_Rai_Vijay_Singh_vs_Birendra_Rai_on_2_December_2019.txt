CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE VIKASH JAIN
ORAL JUDGMENT
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83373639/ 3
Vijay Rai @ Vijay Singh vs Birendra Rai on 2 December, 2019
Date : 02-12-2019
The present writ petition has been filed "for quashing
of the order dated 17.07.2019 passed in Title Suit No. 149 of 2012 by
learned Sub-Judge-IX, Gopalganj, whereunder and whereby the
petition dated 09.02.2018 filed by the Defendant No. 1 under Section
11 of the Code of Civil Procedure has been rejected."
2. Learned counsel for the Defendants/Petitioners
submits that Title Suit No. 268 of 1991 had earlier been filed
relating to the suit land at the instance of Bunnilal Ram, who had
purchased the suit land from the plaintiffs/respondents (1st Set) of
the present case. The suit was dismissed on 20.06.1996, inter alia,
holding that the sale deed executed in favour of the purchaser
Bunnilal Ram by the present plaintiffs was not valid as the land had
been transferred without title. It is therefore submitted that in view
of the sale of the suit land by the plaintiffs/respondents (1 st Set)
having already been held to be without title, the matter was set at
rest in Title Suit No. 268 of 1991 and the present suit was barred
by the doctrine of res judicata. A petition under Section 11 of the
Code of Civil Procedure was accordingly filed by Vijay Rai
defendant no. 1/petitioner no. 1, for dismissing the suit on such
grounds.
3. Heard learned counsel for the Defendants/Petitioners
and perused the material on record. Neither the plaint of Title Suit
Patna High Court C.Misc. No.1586 of 2019 dt.02-12-2019
5/5
No. 268 of 1991 nor the plaint of the present suit, nor even the
judgment dated 20.06.1996 dismissing the aforesaid title suit, have
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83373639/ 4
Vijay Rai @ Vijay Singh vs Birendra Rai on 2 December, 2019
been enclosed with the present petition. It is however not in
dispute that Title Suit No. 268 of 1991 had been filed by Bunnilal
Ram unlike the present suit which has been filed by the
plaintiffs/respondents (1st Set). The impugned order dated
17.07.2019
specifically states that the two suits are between different parties and the subject matter is also
distinct. Learned counsel for the Defendants/Petitioners has not been able to demonstrate
otherwise.
4. In this view of the matter, therefore, this Court is of the view that the ingredients of Section 11 of
the Code of Civil Procedure are not satisfied. The petition is devoid of merit and stands dismissed.
