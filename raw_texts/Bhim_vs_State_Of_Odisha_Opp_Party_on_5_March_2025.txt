case. He has submitted that one Ankush who had business connections with the petitioner was to
pay him money for investing and assuming that the money had been deposited in his account on

SUBMISSION SON BEHALF OF STATE OF ODISHA
9. Ms. Samapika Mishra, Mr. S.S. Mohapatra, Mr. J.P. Patra and Mr. G.N Rout learned Additional
Standing Counsels appearing for the State of Odisha on different dates, vehemently opposed the
prayer for bail submitting that the petitioners alongwith the co accused Rupali Gupta and Pramada
Valli @ Pramada Valli Ponukumati, have cheated the complainant and her husband of a huge
amount of money in a preplanned manner and they acted conjointly in pre - planned manner. The
two co accused - Rupali Gupta and Pramada Valli @ Pramada Valli Ponukumati who are women
have been granted bail as they are women and therefore, they stand on a different footing than the
present petitioners. As the petitioners do not belong to the State of Odisha and some of them have
similar criminal antecedents, they are likely to commit similar offences and it will be difficult to
secure their presence during trial.
BLAPL 1714 of 2024, BLAPL No. 4272 of 2024, BLAPL No. 4381 of 2024, BLAPL No. 4383 of 2024

accounts of SBI and Kotak Mohindra banks, in the account numbers given by Raghu Anand. He has
taken 25% share of the deposits done by the complainant and purchased gold and silver jewellery for
his four unmarried sisters. He has also repaid some handloans taken by his father using this money.
During interrogation co- accused Rupali Gupta has admitted that she was working along with her
associates Raghu Anand and Bhim. One Rupay credit card has been seized at his instance. As the
petitioner does not belong to Odisha, it will be difficult to secure his attendance in the trial and
investigation if he is released on bail.
YOGENDRA SINGH The learned State counsels have submitted that accused Yogendra Singh has
two bank accounts and on a number of occasions money has been transferred to his two accounts
from that of one Kavya Singh BLAPL 1714 of 2024, BLAPL No. 4272 of 2024, BLAPL No. 4381 of
2024, BLAPL No. 4383 of 2024 and BLAPL which amounts to Rs.11,19,000/- and this money has
been withdrawn by the petitioner. Neither Ankush nor Kavya Singh could be traced. He further
submitted that as accused is a resident of Uttar Pradesh, he is likely to abscond, if he is released on
bail.
ASHISH KUMAR The learned State counsels have submitted that during investigation, it was
ascertained that Kotak Mahindra Bank Account No. 2845322439 stands in the name of the
petitioner Ashish Kumar, PB No. 59 536A, Kitex house, Choorakodu, Kizhakkambalam, Aluva,
Ernakulam-683562, Kerala. Mobile No. 6390073232, Debit Card No. 4280902897202594, and the

RAGHU ANAND The learned State Counsels have opposed the prayer for bail of accused Raghu

down payment of Rs.10 lakhs. He unlocked his mobile and in presence of two Government witnesses
and produced the screenshots of the whatsapp communication with other accused persons which
have been seized on his production. ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSION
10. Almost fifty years ago, in the case of Gudikanti Narasimhulu v. Public Prosecutor, High Court:
(1978) 1 SCC 240, the Supreme Court observed thus:
"What is often forgotten, and therefore warrants reminder, is the object to keep a
person in judicial custody pending trial or disposal of an appeal. Lord Russel, C.J.,
said [R v. Rose, (1898) 18 Cox]:
BLAPL 1714 of 2024, BLAPL No. 4272 of 2024, BLAPL No. 4381 of 2024, BLAPL No.
4383 of 2024 and BLAPL "I observe that in this case bail was refused for the
prisoner. It cannot be too strongly impressed on the, magistracy of the country that
bail is not to be withheld as a punishment, but that the requirements as to bail are
merely to secure the attendance of the prisoner at trial.""
In the case of Manish Sisodia v. Directorate of Enforcement:
2024 SCC OnLine SC 1920, referring to the decision of Gudikanti Narasimhulu (
supra) the Supreme Court has observed as follows : :
"53. The Court further observed that, over a period of time, the trial courts and the
High Courts have forgotten a very well- settled principle of law that bail is not to be
withheld as a punishment. From our experience, we can say that it appears that the
trial courts and the High Courts attempt to play safe in matters of grant of bail. The
principle that bail is a rule and refusal is an exception is, at times, followed in breach.
On account of non-grant of bail even in straight forward open and shut cases, this
Court is flooded with huge number of bail petitions thereby adding to the huge 36
pendency. It is high time that the trial courts and the High Courts should recognize
the principle that "bail is rule and jail is exception".
"55. As observed by this Court in the case of Gudikanti Narasimhulu (supra), the
objective to keep a person in judicial custody pending trial or disposal of an appeal is
to secure the attendance of the prisoner at trial.
56. In the present case, the appellant is having deep roots in the society. There is no
possibility of him fleeing away from the BLAPL 1714 of 2024, BLAPL No. 4272 of
2024, BLAPL No. 4381 of 2024, BLAPL No. 4383 of 2024 and BLAPL country and
not being available for facing the trial. In any case, conditions can be imposed to
address the concern of the State.
57. Insofar as the apprehension given by the learned ASG regarding the possibility of
tampering the evidence is concerned, it is to be noted that the case largely depends
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/42416965/ 7
Bhim vs State Of Odisha ...... Opp. Party on 5 March, 2025
on documentary evidence which is already seized by the prosecution. As such, there is
no possibility of tampering with the evidence. Insofar as the concern with regard to
influencing the witnesses is concerned, the said concern can be addressed by
imposing stringent conditions upon the appellant....."
11. In a catena of decisions, the Supreme Court has laid down the principles to be kept in mind while
considering a prayer for bail.
In the case of in Mahipal vs. Rajesh Kumar: (2020) 2 SCC 118, the Supreme Court has held as
follows:-
"12. The determination of whether a case is fit for the grant of bail involves the balancing of
numerous factors, among which the nature of the offence, the severity of the punishment and a
prima facie view of the involvement of the accused are important. No straight jacket formula exists
for courts to assess an application for the grant or rejection of bail. At the stage of assessing whether
a case is fit for the grant of bail, the court is not required to enter into a detailed analysis of the
evidence on record to establish beyond reasonable doubt the commission of the crime by the
accused. That is a matter for BLAPL 1714 of 2024, BLAPL No. 4272 of 2024, BLAPL No. 4381 of
2024, BLAPL No. 4383 of 2024 and BLAPL trial. However, the Court is required to examine
whether there is a prima facie or reasonable ground to believe that the accused had committed the
offence and on a balance of the considerations involved, the continued custody of the accused
sub-serves the purpose of the criminal justice system.........." In the case of Sanjay Chandra vrs.
C.B.I.: (2012) 1 SCC 40, the Supreme Court has inter alia held as follows: -
" 21. In bail applications, generally, it has been laid down from the earliest times that
the object of bail is to secure the appearance of the accused person at his trial by
reasonable amount of bail. The object of bail is neither punitive nor preventative.
Deprivation of liberty must be considered a punishment ,unless it can be required to
ensure that an accused person will stand his trial when called upon. The courts owe
more than verbal respect to the principle that punishment begins after conviction,
and that every man is deemed to be innocent until duly tried and duly found guilty.
22. From the earliest times, it was appreciated that detention in custody pending
completion of trial could be a cause of great hardship. From time to time, necessity
demands that some un-convicted persons should be held in custody pending trial to
secure their attendance at the trial but in such cases, `necessity' is the operative test.
In this country, it would be quite contrary to the concept of personal liberty
enshrined in the Constitution that any person should be punished in BLAPL 1714 of
2024, BLAPL No. 4272 of 2024, BLAPL No. 4381 of 2024, BLAPL No. 4383 of 2024
and BLAPL respect of any matter, upon which, he has not been convicted or that in
any circumstances, he should be deprived of his liberty upon only the belief that he
will tamper with the witnesses if left at liberty, save in the most extraordinary
circumstances. Apart from the question of prevention being the object of a refusal of
bail, one must not lose sight of the fact that any imprisonment before conviction has
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/42416965/ 8
Bhim vs State Of Odisha ...... Opp. Party on 5 March, 2025
a substantial punitive content and it would be improper for any Court to refuse bail
as a mark of disapproval of former conduct whether the accused has been convicted
for it or not or to refuse bail to an un-convicted person for the purpose of giving him a
taste of imprisonment as a lesson."
xxxxxxx "40. The grant or refusal to grant bail lies within the discretion of the Court. The grant or
denial is regulated, to a large extent, by the facts and circumstances of each particular case. But at
the same time, right to bail is not to be denied merely because of the sentiments of the community
against the accused. The primary purposes of bail in a criminal case are to relieve the accused of
imprisonment, to relieve the State of the burden of keeping him, pending the trial, and at the same
time, to keep the accused constructively in the custody of the Court, whether before or after
conviction, to assure that he will submit to the jurisdiction of the Court and be in attendance
thereon whenever his presence is required. BLAPL 1714 of 2024, BLAPL No. 4272 of 2024, BLAPL
No. 4381 of 2024, BLAPL No. 4383 of 2024 and BLAPL
41. This Court in Gurcharan Singh and Ors. Vs. State AIR 1978 SC 179 observed that two paramount
considerations, while considering petition for grant of bail in non-bailable offence, apart from the
seriousness of the offence, are the likelihood of the accused fleeing from justice and his tampering
with the prosecution witnesses.
42. Both of them relate to ensure of the fair trial of the case. Though, this aspect is dealt by the High
Court in its impugned order, in our view, the same is not convincing.
43. When the undertrial prisoners are detained in jail custody to an indefinite period, Article 21 of
the Constitution is violated. Every person, detained or arrested, is entitled to speedy trial, the
question is: whether the same is possible in the present case. There are seventeen accused persons.
Statement of the witnesses runs to several hundred pages and the documents on which reliance is
placed by the prosecution, is voluminous. The trial may take considerable time and it looks to us
that the appellants, who are in jail, have to remain in jail longer than the period of detention, had
they been convicted. It is not in the interest of justice that accused should be in jail for an indefinite
period. No doubt, the offence alleged against the appellants is a serious one in terms of alleged huge
loss to the State exchequer, that, by itself, should not deter us from enlarging the appellants on bail
when there is no serious contention of the respondent BLAPL 1714 of 2024, BLAPL No. 4272 of
2024, BLAPL No. 4381 of 2024, BLAPL No. 4383 of 2024 and BLAPL that the accused, if released
on bail, would interfere with the trial or tamper with evidence. We do not see any good reason to
detain the accused in custody, that too, after the completion of the investigation and filing of the
charge-sheet..."
12. It is no longer res integra that a person's right to life and liberty, which is guaranteed by Article
21 of the Constitution of India, cannot be curtailed for an indefinite period, merely because the
person is accused of committing an offence . The purpose behind arresting and detaining a person in
jail is mainly for ensuring his presence during trial. Detention of an accused may also be necessary
during investigation, so that he / she does not tamper with evidence or interfere with the
investigation. It is true that the amount the complainant and his wife have been defrauded of, is a

large sum and it prima facie appears that the petitioners have acted in tandem pursuant to well
chalked out plan. But all the offences alleged against the petitioners are triable by a Magistrate. Trial
has not yet started. In view of the nature of allegations against the petitioners, the documents which
are required to be proved and the number of witnesses who are to be examined, it is apparent that
the trial cannot be concluded at an early date. Without the allegations against the petitioners being
proved in the trial, I am of the view that their further detention will amount to pre-trial punishment.

and BLAPL
13. In view of the above discussion and considering the nature of allegations against the petitioners
who have remained in custody for more than fourteen months, the submissions that the petitioners
do not have similar criminal antecedents, I am inclined to allow their prayers for bail, but subject to
stringent conditions as the petitioners are not residents of Odisha, in order to ensure their presence
in the trial Court during trial.
14. It is accordingly directed that the petitioners Bhim, Yogendra Singh, Tej Kumar, Ashish Kumar
and Raghu Anand shall be released on bail on such terms and conditions as the learned court in
seisin over the matter in C.T. case No 1630 of 2023 may consider fit and proper, after verifying that
they do not have similar criminal antecedents, including imposition of appropriate cash surety, as
well as the following conditions:
(i) One of the sureties shall be a blood relation.
(ii) The petitioners should not tamper with prosecution evidence or try to influence
or threaten witnesses.
(iii) The petitioners shall not indulge in any criminal activity.
(iv) The petitioners shall provide the address in Bhubaneswar where they intend to
reside after their release and also provide the details of BLAPL 1714 of 2024, BLAPL
No. 4272 of 2024, BLAPL No. 4381 of 2024, BLAPL No. 4383 of 2024 and BLAPL
their permanent address along with name of the Police Station to the learned trial
Court, so that both addresses can be verified by the I.O. and the latter can establish
contact with the Officer in Charge / Station House Officer of the Police Station before
they are released on bail.
(v) The petitioners shall provide their active mobile number(s) to the learned trial
Court, so that the same can be verified by the I.O., before they are released on bail.
Any change in the mobile number(s) shall be immediately informed to the Court, by
their counsel within two days of the change.
(vi) The petitioners shall not leave the Bhubaneswar U.P.D., without permission of
the learned trial Court.

(vii) The petitioners shall surrender their passports in the learned trial Court. In case
they do not possess passports, they shall submit affidavits to that effect.
(ix) The petitioners shall remain personally present in the learned trial court on each
date of trial and co-operate for early disposal of the trial.
(x) They shall not seek for adjournment on frivolous grounds.
15. In the event of violation of any of these conditions or any other condition that may be imposed
by the learned Court in seisin over the BLAPL 1714 of 2024, BLAPL No. 4272 of 2024, BLAPL No.
4381 of 2024, BLAPL No. 4383 of 2024 and BLAPL matter, this order is liable to be recalled and /
or the bail granted to the petitioners cancelled.
16. Observations in this order have been made for purpose of considering the bail application and
are prima facie views and should not influence the learned trial court which is to try the case strictly
on the basis of evidence led in the case.
17. BLAPL No. 1714 of 2024, BLAPL No. 4272 of 2024, BLAPL No. 4381 of 2024, BLAPL No. 4383
of 2024 and BLAPL No. 4662 of 2024 are accordingly allowed.
18. Urgent certified copy of this order be granted on proper application.
