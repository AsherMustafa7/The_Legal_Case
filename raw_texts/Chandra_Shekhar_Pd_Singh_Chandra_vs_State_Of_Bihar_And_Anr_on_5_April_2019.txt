2. Despite service of notice on opposite party no. 2 and
learned counsel entering appearance and name of learned counsel
also printed in the cause list, nobody appeared when the case was
taken up and heard.
3. The petitioners have moved the Court under Section
482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 for the following
relief:
"That, this is an application for quashing
the order dated 16.5.2015 passed by learned
Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Khagaria in
Complaint Case No. 1199C/12 by which the learned
Magistrate was pleased to hold that a prima facie
case is made out against the petitioner for facing
trial for the offences under sections 435, 427, 379 of
the Indian Penal Code."
4. The opposite party no. 2 had initially filed Complaint
Case No. 357C of 2010 against the petitioners alleging that they
had demanded extortion of Rs. 10,000/- and had forcibly cut and
taken away the paddy crops and had also burnt part of the crops
and while doing so, they had snatched golden chain from the neck
of the opposite party no. 2 worth Rs. 10,000/-, ring worth Rs.
8,000/-, wrist watch worth Rs. 2,500/- and Rs. 5,00/- cash. The
same was sent by the Court to the Police, based on which Mansi
P.S. Case No. 46 of 2010 was instituted on 03.05.2010. The
police, after thorough investigation, submitted final form holding
the allegations to be untrue and also recommended for initiating

proceeding under Sections 182 and 211 of the Indian Penal Code.
The opposite party no. 2 then filed a Protest-cum-Complaint
which was numbered as Complaint Case No. 1199 C of 2012, in
which the Court has taken cognizance against the petitioners
under Sections 435, 427 and 379 of the Indian Penal Code on
16.05.2015.

. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the opposite party no. 2 has filed a patently false
and frivolous case which is actually mischievous, resulting in unnecessary harassment to the
petitioners. It was submitted that in the year 2009, the opposite party no. 2 had filed an application
before the Anchal Adhakari for settlement of the lands in question with him showing them to be
Grirmazarua Aam land. During enquiry, the petitioners/their agnates had objected and finally the
Anchal Adhikari, by a reasoned order dated 07.04.2009, held the lands to be raiyati of the
petitioners and others and dismissed the claim of the opposite party no. 2. Thereafter, again the
opposite party no. 2 filed a petition before the Anchal Adhikari for settlement of part of the same
lands which was sent to the local police station for enquiry and the report submitted by the S.H.O.,
Mansi P.S. to the Anchal Adhikari, Mansi dated 10.06.2009, clearly stated that the lands were
raiyati lands of others and the opposite party no. 2 by Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.33504 of
2015 dt.05-04-2019 changing the boundary of the plots was trying to create disturbance by showing
the lands to be non raiyati lands, for which action was required to be taken. Learned counsel
submitted that once the opposite party no. 2 failed in his design to somehow grab the lands of the
petitioners, he has adopted filing of complaint case, which should not be allowed to proceed.
6. Learned A.P.P. very fairly submitted that from the materials on record, it is clear that the
allegations in the complaint case with regard to forcible cutting and taking away of paddy corp does
not appear to be correct for the lands itself do not belong to the opposite party no. 2.
7. Having considered the facts and circumstances of the case and submissions of learned counsel for
the parties, the Court finds that a case for interference has been made out.
8. As has rightly been submitted by learned counsel for the petitioners, the overall picture which
emerges, based on the records before the Court, it is the opposite party no. 2 who has been
relentlessly trying to grab lands belonging to others somehow or the other. The fact that the
authorities had twice found the lands in question, to be private raiyati lands of the petitioners and
others and not of the opposite party no. 2, any allegation with regard to the petitioners and others
taking away or Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.33504 of 2015 dt.05-04-2019 cutting the paddy

grown on such lands appears to be highly improbable and in fact, patently false. Even if it is
accepted that the petitioners had cut and taken away the paddy, which was grown on their personal
private land, no offence, much less any criminal offence, can be made out against them. In fact,
rightly the police had submitted final form dated 31.05.2010 and recommended for instituting case
against the opposite party no. 2 under Sections 182 and 211 of the Indian Penal Code for making
false allegation. Earlier also such finding by the police has been recorded in the communication by
the Officer Incharge, Mansi to the Anchal Adhikari, Mansi dated 10.06.2009. Thus, repeatedly
efforts were made by the opposite party no. 2 to claim right over the lands in question and findings
recorded by the authorities that they are the personal and private lands of the petitioners and others
and not that of the opposite party no. 2, leaves no doubt in the mind of the Court that the present
case has been instituted only for wreaking vengeance and to harass the petitioners.
9. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in State of Haryana vs. Bhajan Lal reported as 1992 Supp (1) SCC
335, at paragraph no. 102 has enumerated categories where the Court is required to interfere under
its inherent power under Section 482 of the Code. The same reads as under:
Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.33504 of 2015 dt.05-04-2019 "102. In the backdrop
of the interpretation of the various relevant provisions of the Code under Chapter
XIV and of the principles of law enunciated by this Court in a serious of decisions
relating to the exercise of the extraordinary power under Article 226 or the inherent
powers under Section 482 of the Code which we have extracted and reproduced
above, we give the following categories of cases by way of illustration wherein such
power could be exercised either to prevent abuse of the process of any court or
otherwise to secure the ends of justice, though it may not be possible to lay down any
precise, clearly defined and sufficiently channelised and inflexible guidelines or rigid
formulae and to give an exhaustive list of myriad kinds of cases wherein such power
should be exercised.
(1) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the complaint, even
if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie
constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused.
(2) Where the allegations in the first information report and other materials, if any,
accompanying the FIR do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an
investigation by police officers under Section 156 (1) of the Code except under an
order of a Magistrate within the purview of Section 155(2) of the Code.
(3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or complaint and the
evidence collected in support of the same do not disclose the commission of any
offence and make out a case against the accused.
(4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable offence but
constitute only a non-cognizable offence, no investigation is permitted by a police
officer without an order of a Magistrate as contemplated under Section 155(2) of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/175163834/ 4
Chandra Shekhar Pd. Singh @ Chandra ... vs State Of Bihar And Anr on 5 April, 2019
Code.
(5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently
improbable on the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion
that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused.
(6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of the Code
or the Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.33504 of 2015 dt.05-04-2019 concerned Act
(under which a criminal proceeding is instituted) to the institution and continuance
of the proceedings and/or where there is a specific provision in the Code or the
concerned Act, providing efficacious redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party.
(7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and/or where
the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking
vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and personal
grudge."
10. The present case, in the opinion of the Court, is covered under category 7 of the aforesaid
judgment in Bhajan Lal (supra) at paragraph no. 102.
11. Further, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of State of Karnataka v. L. Muniswamy reported
as (1977) 2 SCC 699, at paragraph no. 7, has held as under:
"7. .........In the exercise of this wholesome power, the High Court is entitled to quash
a proceeding if it comes to the conclusion that allowing the proceeding to continue
would be an abuse of the process of the Court or that the ends of justice require that
the proceeding ought to be quashed. The saving of the High Court's inherent powers,
both in civil and criminal matters, is designed to achieve a salutary public purpose
which is that a Court proceeding ought not to be permitted to degenerate into a
weapon of harassment or persecution. In a criminal case, the veiled object behind a
lame prosecution, the very nature of the material on which the structure of the
prosecution rests and the like would justify the High Court in quashing the
proceeding in the interest of justice......"
Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.33504 of 2015 dt.05-04-2019
12. In the aforesaid background, the Court finds that the present complaint case is mala fide and an
abuse of the process of the Court and cannot be allowed to continue.
13. Accordingly, the application is allowed. The entire criminal proceeding arising out of Complaint
Case No. 1199 C of 2012, including the order dated 16.05.2015, by which cognizance has been taken,
stands quashed.
