Date : 16-10-2025
1. The Writ petition is filed for the following reliefs:-
"(i) For issuance of a writ of certiorari to quash the notice as contained in Memo No.
02 Mu/Aa dated 31.07.2019 (Annexure-4) issued by the Sub Divisional Patna High
Court CWJC No.18860 of 2019 dt.16-10-2025 Officer, Lakhisarai whereby and
whereunder, it has been notified that the District Selection Committee, Lakhisarai
has selected one Upendra Kumar in Ward No. 1 of Lakhisarai, Nagar Parishad as Fair
Price Shop Dealer although he was at Sl. No. 2 in the Provisional Merit list of new
P.D.S. Dealers (2017-2018) in a most arbitrary and mechanical manner whereas the
petitioner was at Sl. No. 1 in the said Merit List.

(ii) For issuance of a writ of mandamus commanding/directing the Respondents
especially Respondent No. 2, 4 and 7 to recruit the petitioner as Fair Price Shop
Dealer in Ward No. 1 of Lakhisarai Nagar Parisad.
(iii) For issuance appropriate of any other writ/writs or direction/ directions or
order/orders which is found just and proper under the facts and circumstances of
this case.
2. At this juncture, the Learned counsel for the respondents contended that Section 32(iii) of the
Bihar Targeted Public Distribution System (Control) Order, 2016 provides for the provision of
appeal and Patna High Court CWJC No.18860 of 2019 dt.16-10-2025 Section 32(vi) of the Bihar
Targeted Public Distribution System (Control) Order, 2016 provides for the provision of revision.
Section 32(iii) 32(v) and 32(vi) read as follows:
"32 (iii). Any person aggrieved by an order of the licensing authority denying the
issue or renewal of the license to the fair price shop owner or cancellation of the
license may appeal to the District Officer within thirty days of the date of receipt of
the order and the District Magistrate shall, as far as practicable, dispose the appeal
within a period of sixty days."
32. (v) Till the disposal of appeal pending, the Appellate Authority may direct that the order under
appeal shall not take effect for such period as the authority may consider necessary for giving a
reasonable opportunity to the other party under sub- clause (4) or until the appeal is disposed of,
whichever is earlier.
Patna High Court CWJC No.18860 of 2019 dt.16-10-2025
(vi) Due to non disposal of the appeal within sixty days by the District Officer or against the order
passed in the appeal, a revision may be filed before the Divisional Commissioner. The revision shall
be disposed of within two months.
3. Admittedly, from the reliefs prayed for in the Writ petition, it is evident that the petitioner has an
alternative remedy under the provisions of Bihar Targeted Public Distribution System (Control)
Order, 2016.
4. The remedy available under the Act is to prefer an appeal before the District Magistrate. As the
District Magistrate is the head of the Selection Committee, he cannot review his orders in an appeal.
Therefore, the petitioner is directed to file a complaint/application before the Divisional
Commissioner.
Patna High Court CWJC No.18860 of 2019 dt.16-10-2025
5. The Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that he intends to file a complaint/application
before the concerned authority, but the limitation period for filing the same has lapsed. He prayed

for a direction to the concerned authority to entertain the same in accordance with Section 5 of the
Limitation Act.
6. Taking into consideration that the petitioner has an alternative remedy for filing
complaint/application, the Writ petition is disposed of with a direction to the petitioner to file
complaint/application, raising all his grounds before the concerned authority within two month
from the date of receipt of this order. The delay in filing the complaint/ application shall be
condoned by the authority concerned, and the authority shall dispose of the same within three
months from the date of filing of the same.
7. With the above said observation, the Writ petition is disposed of.
Patna High Court CWJC No.18860 of 2019 dt.16-10-2025
8. Interlocutory Application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
