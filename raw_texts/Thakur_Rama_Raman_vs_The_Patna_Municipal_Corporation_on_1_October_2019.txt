of the petitioner has been forcibly demolished/removed on

, the petitioner has prayed for restoration of the Patna High Court CWJC No.12297 of 2019
dt.01-10-2019 possession of structure of the KIOSK and to allow him such other reliefs to which he
may be entitled to.
2. During pendency of the writ application the petitioner filed Interlocutory Application No. 01 of
2019 with a prayer to add other relief for quashing of the order as contained in Letter No. 7717A
dated 15.06.2019 which was brought on record as Annexure 'PMC/D' with the counter affidavit of
the respondent.
3. The parties have exchanged their affidavits and the matter has been taken for final disposal with
the consent of the parties.
BRIEF FACTS OF THE CASE
4. It is the case of the petitioner that in the year 1988 the then Patna Regional Development
Authority (in short 'PRDA') published a notice inviting the public to make application for allotment
of KIOSK in Mauryalok Commercial Complex. It is not in dispute that the petitioner had applied for
the KIOSK, pursuant thereto the KIOSK was settled in his favour on lease hold basis for a period of
11 years on certain conditions. The letter of settlement/allotment as contained in Annexure '1' to the
writ application shows that on 28.03.1988 settlement had taken place. The premium amount was
fixed at Rs. 41,751/- and 50% of the amount was required to be deposited initially which the
petitioner Patna High Court CWJC No.12297 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 deposited on 23.04.2008 vide
Annexure '2' to the writ application. Thereafter, he paid further amount and it is not in dispute that
though initially the KIOSK was allotted for sale of Books, Newspaper and other Journals, vide letter
dated 27th December, 1995, as contained in Annexure '3' to the writ application, the State Officer of
the 'PRDA' permitted a change of business and permitted the petitioner to do his business of
breakfast etc. Water connection was accordingly provided to the petitioner vide Annexure '4' to the
writ application. No registered sale deed was executed but the petitioner continued as an
allottee/lessee for a period of 11 years without there being any allegation of breach of the terms and
conditions of his allotment.
5. It further appears that by letter dated 25.01.2000 the lease was renewed for a further period of 11
years and the petitioner was directed to deposit a sum of Rs. 46,751/- by 30.01.2000. The petitioner
deposited the same and continued with the KIOSK. On expiry of the renewed period of 11 years,
once again the petitioner applied for renewal on 29.10.2010 which was considered by the State
Officer of the Corporation (since by this time the 'PRDA' has been abolished and these properties
vested with the Corporation) on the similar terms, the lease of the petitioner was renewed for
another period of 11 years on deposit of sum of Rs. Patna High Court CWJC No.12297 of 2019
dt.01-10-2019 52,189/-. He was directed to get the lease deed executed in the prescribed format and
for this purpose he was required to deposit Rs. 52,189/-. The petitioner deposited the said amount
on 30.12.2011 (Annexure '6' to the writ application). After accepting the amount towards renewal,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/110170243/ 2
Thakur Rama Raman vs The Patna Municipal Corporation on 1 October, 2019
the respondent Corporation did not make further correspondence with the petitioner and the
petitioner continued to occupy the KIOSK as an allottee.
6. It is the case of the petitioner that after renewal of the lease, he was running the shop of 'Amul
Parlour'. On 14.06.2019 the petitioner received a notice dated 08.06.2019 issued by the Director,
Town Planning of the Corporation (Annexure '7') by which the petitioner was informed that in
respect of the KIOSK constructed in the set back area of the Mauryalok Commercial Complex, the
lease period has already expired and it is often seen that allottees have encroached upon the vacant
land in front of their allotted KIOSKs and by putting chair and table and other things, they are doing
business which is causing difficulty in movement of vehicles and parking. It further referred to
Section 02 (117) (118) of the Building Byelaws, 2014 to say that no construction may be done in the
set-back of the building, therefore, these KIOSKs are liable to be demolished. Patna High Court
CWJC No.12297 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019
7. Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that Annexure '7' is though addressed to the
petitioner but it does not contain any specific fact against the petitioner and there is no specific
allegation that the petitioner had been using the vacant area in front of his shop and or any way
causing hindrances in free movement of vehicles. According to learned counsel, Annexure '7' is a
general kind of letter without being mentioning any particular instance of encroachment.
8. Be that as it may, learned counsel for the petitioner has drawn attention of this Court towards
Annexure '8' to the writ application saying that the petitioner had submitted a reply immediately on
the same day i.e. on 14.06.2019 when the notice dated 08.06.2019 was made available to him. The
petitioner pointed out to the Director, Urban Project of the Corporation that the settlement of his
KIOSK no. 02 is up to the year 2022 and therefore, notice dated 08.06.2019 be taken back.
9. The response of the petitioner was, however, not considered and on 16.09.2019 on the direction of
the then Commissioner of the Corporation, the KIOSK no. 2 was demolished, therefore, the
petitioner had been dispossessed from the KIOSK in the manner stated hereinabove without
considering Patna High Court CWJC No.12297 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 his submissions and without
giving any opportunity of hearing to him.
10. With the counter affidavit the respondent Corporation has enclosed Annexure 'PMC/D'
contained in letter no. 7717A dated 15.06.2019 which has been signed by the Municipal
Commissioner on 14.06.2019 itself i.e. the date on which the notice dated 08.06.2019 was made
available to the petitioner. The letter no. 7717A dated 15.06.2019 reads as under :-

11. The respondent Corporation has in its counter affidavit relied upon Clause 13 of the deed of lease
(Copy of the lease is not brought on record) and has quoted the same as under:-
Patna High Court CWJC No.12297 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 "13. That the lessee shall
not keep or store any self combustible thing or self inflammable good in the demised
Kiosk which may endanger the Kiosk or surrounding building".
"14. that the lessee shall not use any fire using coal, charcoal or fire wood and shall
not use any other smoke omitting ovens in or around the KIOSK. Only use of LPG
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/110170243/ 4
Thakur Rama Raman vs The Patna Municipal Corporation on 1 October, 2019
Gas and Electric and Solar Oven will be permitted to be used."
"15. That the lessee shall not used the common spaces like Road, Park and Garden of
Maurya Lok Commercial Complex for his personal convenience or business."
"16. That the lessee shall keep the demised KIOSK in neat and clean and in fully
tentable condition and shall not employee or permit to be employed or allow to enter
the Kiosk any person suffering from any virulent, contagious, infectious, loathsome
disease or diseases."
"20. That if subsequently it transpired that the lease of Kiosk has been obtained by
the lessee by misrepresentation or misstatement of facts or by fraud or if there is any
breach of the conditions of lease by the lessee, the lease in favour of lessee in respect
of demised Kiosk shall be forfeited by the lessor and the lessor shall resumed the
re-enter the demised Kiosk and shall take possession thereof and lessee shall not be
entitled to either raise any objection whatsoever in respect thereto nor shall be
entitled to any compensation damaged from the lessor."
12. It is the case of the respondent Corporation that after expiry of the aforesaid lease an order was
passed to extend the period of lease and it is not in dispute that the lease was lastly renewed vide
letter no. 5183 dated 29.11.2011. It is stated that although he amount was deposited by the petitioner
but he did not get the deed of lease executed and continued his business in the Patna High Court
CWJC No.12297 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 said KIOSK. It has been submitted that because the lease
deed was not executed, the petitioner cannot argue that the lease is valid till 2022.
13. The respondents Corporation have come out with a case that the report with regard to the
encroachment of the areas situated at Mauryalok Commercial Complex by the proprietors of 15
KIOSKs have been obtained vide Annexure 'PMC/A' and after the spot inspection of the vacant area
which were being utilized report was submitted to the Estate Officer vide Memo No. 393/C dated
19.04.2018. Accordingly, the petitioner had been served with letter bearing No. 2429 dated
18.02.2019 (Annexure 'PMC/C'). By Annexure 'PMC/C' the petitioner was called upon to pay a sum
of Rs. 6,83,208/- as user charge for the period August 2009 to March 2018 which according to the
Corporation the petitioner had used during the period August, 2009 and March 2018. Here it is
worth taking note of the fact that from Annexure 'PMC/A' it would appear that earlier also a similar
kind of measurement report was obtained by the Corporation and the proprietors of the KIOSKs
have been noticed to pay extra amount as per report. This time again vide Annexure 'PMC/C' the
proprietors of the KIOSKs had been called upon to pay users charge. The petitioner had represented
against the said letter dated 18.02.2019 saying that Patna High Court CWJC No.12297 of 2019
dt.01-10-2019 he had started a Book Stall in the KIOSK and the same had been closed in the year
2015 and only after the permission / modified correction he has changed the business in the KIOSK
and open the shop and he was doing business in the KIOSK of Amul Parlour, therefore, he was not
using any excess area since the year 2009 as was being claimed. He had requested the authorities to
measure the excess area in his presence. He submitted that he had not encroached on any excess
area and there is no obstruction of movement of vehicles for any reason attributable to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/110170243/ 5
Thakur Rama Raman vs The Patna Municipal Corporation on 1 October, 2019
petitioner. He specifically submitted that he had not constructed any 'Chullah', therefore, the
question of pollution also does not arise. The petitioner, further submitted that the Building Byelaws
of 2014 would not be applicable against the petitioner, inasmuch as, the KIOSK of the petitioner was
in the Master Plan of the Mauryalok Complex, therefore, same had been constructed and allotted to
the petitioner in the year 1982.
14. By filing supplementary counter affidavit on behalf of the respondent Corporation it has been
submitted that on 28.01.1989 the deed of lease was executed for the first time and the same was
handed over to the petitioner for presentation for its registration in compliance with the mandatory
provision as contained in Section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act. Relying Patna High Court
CWJC No.12297 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 upon Section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act it has been
submitted that according to this provision, the lease of immovable property for any term exceeding
to one year can be made only by a registered instrument. Answering to the statements made in the
interlocutory application of the petitioner, the respondents have contended that the order dated
15.06.2019 was sent through Dak Peon to the petitioner on the same day but the person present at
the spot after reading the copy of the order dated 15.06.2019 refused to accept the same. In the
supplementary counter affidavit there is a change of stand by the Corporation trying to explain that
because no lease deed was executed and there was no registered lease deed after 29.01.2011, it was
allotment of KIOSK No. 2 which was cancelled with immediate effect. It was submitted in paragraph
'27' of the counter affidavit that the demolition has been done after issuing notice to the petitioner as
contained in Annexure '7' to the writ application.
15. Having heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned counsel for the Corporation as also
upon perusal of the records, this Court finds that the KIOSK in question was constructed by the then
'PRDA', there is no denial that it was in the Master Plan of the Mauryalok Complex and pursuant to
the invitation and offer issued by the then 'PRDA' the petitioner had Patna High Court CWJC
No.12297 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 submitted his application and was allotted the KIOSK no. 2 for sale
of books and journals. It is also not in dispute that in the year 2000 once again the lease period was
renewed by another 11 years and in 2011 once again it was extended for another 11 years i.e. up to
the month of February, 2022. Although the respondent Corporation has quoted some of the
paragraphs from the lease deed said to have been executed in the year 1988-89 but the copy of the
same has not been brought on record. A reading of the statements made in the counter affidavit
particularly paragraph 3(ii) it would appear that the Corporation has taken a stand that the period of
lease was extended by another 11 years. However, the lease as contained in Annexure '5 and '5/1' to
the writ application talk of renewal of the lease deed. Under these circumstances the question arises
as to whether in absence of there being a registered lease deed for the extended period, the
respondent Corporation is justified in saying that no lease was existing in respect of KIOSK No. 02.
In order to thrash out this issue, it would be relevant to quote Section 107 of the Transfer of Property
Act which reads as under:-
"46107. Lease how made.- A lease of immovable property from year to year, or for
any term exceeding one year, or reserving a yearly rent, can be made only by a
registered instrument.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/110170243/ 6
Thakur Rama Raman vs The Patna Municipal Corporation on 1 October, 2019
46. As to limitation to the territorial operation of S. 107, see S. 1, supra, S. 107
extends to every cantonment, see S. 287 of the Cantonments Act, 1924 (2 of 1924)
Patna High Court CWJC No.12297 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 [All other leases of
immovable property may be mad either by a registered instrument or by oral
agreement accompanied by delivery of possession.
[Where a lease of immovable property is made by a registered instrument, such
instrument or, where thre are more instruments than one, each such instrument shall
be executed by both the lessor and the lessee:] Provided that the State Government
49[* * *] from time to time, by notification in the Official Gazette, direct that leases of
immovable property, other than leases from year to year, or for any term exceeding
one year, or reserving a yearly rent, or any class of such leases, may be made by
unregistered instrument or by oral agreement without delivery of possession.]"
16. In the case of Vishal N. Kalsaria vs. Bank of India and others reported in AIR 2016 SC 530 while
considering the case under the Sercuritization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and
Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (hereinafter referred to as the 'SARFAESI Act, 20002')
under which Secured Creditor/Bank was taking action to evict a tenant from the premises of the
secured asset/immovable property and it was contended that the tenant is not in possession of a
registered instrument in his favour by the lessor and the enter play of the provisions of the SARAESI
Act, 2002 and that of the Maharastra Rent Control Act, 1999 came to be considered, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court recorded it's views in paragraph '13 and '25' which are recorded hereunder for ready
reference:-
"13. The learned Senior Counsel contends that it is a settled position of law that in the
absence of a valid document of
47. Substituted by Act 6 of 1904,S. 5, for the original paragraph.
48. Inserted by Act 20 of 1929, S. 55.
49. The words "with the previous sanction of the G.G. in C." omitted by A.O. 1937.
Patna High Court CWJC No.12297 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 lease for more than one
year or in case of an invalid lease deed, the relation of tenancy between a landlord
and the tenant is still created due to delivery of possession to the tenant and payment
of rent to the landlord-owner and such tenancy is deemed to be a tenancy from
month to month in respect of such property. The learned Senior Counsel further
places reliance on a three-Judge Bench decision of this Court in Anthony v. K.C.
Ittoop & Sons & Ors.2, wherein it was held as under:
"... ... so far as the instrument of lease is concerned there is no scope for holding that
appellant is a lessee by virtue of the said instrument. The Court is disabled from using
the instrument as evidence....
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/110170243/ 7
Thakur Rama Raman vs The Patna Municipal Corporation on 1 October, 2019
But this above finding does not exhaust the scope of the issue whether the appellant
is a lessee of the building. A lease of immovable property is defined in Section 105 of
the TP Act. A transfer of a right to enjoy a property in consideration of a price paid or
promised to be rendered periodically or on specified occasions is the basic fabric for a
valid lease. The provision says that such a transfer can be made expressly or by
implication. Once there is such a transfer of right to enjoy the property a lease stands
created. What is mentioned in the three paragraphs of the first part of Section 107 of
the TP Act are only the different modes of how leases are created. ... Thus, de hors the
instrument parties can create a lease as envisaged in the second paragraph of Section
107 which reads thus: All other leases of immovable property may be made either by
a registered instrument or by oral agreement accompanied by delivery of possession.
When lease is a transfer of a right to enjoy the property and such transfer can be
made expressly or by implication, the mere fact that an unregistered instrument
came into existence would not stand in the way of the court to determine whether
there was in fact a lease otherwise than through such deed."
"25.The issue of determination of tenancy is also one which is well settled. While
Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 does provide for registration of
leases which are created on a year
2. (2000) 6 SCC 394:(AIR 2000SC 3523) Patna High Court CWJC No.12297 of 2019
dt.01-10-2019
-to-year basis, what needs to be remembered is the effect of non- registration, or the
creation of tenancy by way of an oral agreement. According to Section 106 of the
Transfer of Property Act, 1882, a monthly tenancy shall be deemed to be a tenancy
from month to month and must be registered if it is reduced into writing. The
Transfer of Property Act, however, remains silent on the position of law in cases
where the agreement is not reduced into writing. If the two parties are executing their
rights and liabilities in the nature of a landlord-tenant relationship and if regular rent
is being paid and accepted, then the mere factum of non-registration of deed will not
make the lease itself nugatory. If no written lease deed exists, then such tenants are
required to prove that they have been in occupation of the premises as tenants by
producing such evidence in the proceedings under Section 14 of the SARFAESI Act
before the learned Magistrate. Further, in terms of Section 55(2) of the special law in
the instant case, which is the Rent Control Act, the onus to get such a deed registered
is on the landlord. In the light of the same, neither can the landlord nor the banks be
permitted to exploit the fact of non-registration of the tenancy deed against the
tenant. Further, the learned counsel for the appellants rightly placed reliance on a
three-Judge Bench decision of this Court in Anthony (AIR 2000 SC 3523) (supra). At
the cost of repetition, in that case it was held as under:

"But the above finding does not exhaust the scope of the issue whether the appellant

has been extracted above and it deals with the mode of creating the particular kinds
of leases mentioned therein. The third paragraph can be read along with the above as
it contains a condition to be complied with if the parties choose to create a lease as
per a registered instrument mentioned Patna High Court CWJC No.12297 of 2019
dt.01-10-2019 therein. All other leases, if created, necessarily fall within the ambit of
the second paragraph. Thus, dehors the instrument parties can create a lease as
envisaged in the second paragraph of Section 107 which reads thus: All other leases
of immovable property may be made either by a registered instrument or by oral
agreement accompanied by delivery of possession."
17. In the case of Anthony v. K.C. Ittoop and Sons and others reported in AIR 2000 SC 3523, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court was considering the case where a lease deed was for a period of 5 years, the
tenant was inducted into the possession of the building by the lessor, the tenant was found paying
monthly rent but the lease deed which was required to be registered was not registered. The Hon'ble
Supreme Court held that mere fact that an unregistered instrument came into existence would not
stand in the way of the Court to determine whether there was in fact a lease otherwise than through
such deed. The lease deed not exceeding one year stood created by conduct of the parties and the
tenant became entitled protection under the Rent Control Act on its commencement. Paragraphs 11,
12, 13 and 14 of the judgment rendered in the case of Anthony (supra) are quoted hereunder for a
ready reference :
"11. The resultant position is insurmountable that so far as the instrument of lease is
concerned there is no scope for holding that the appellant is a lessee by virtue of the
said instrument. The Court is disabled from using the instrument as evidence and
hence it goes out of consideration in this case, hook, line and sinker (vide Smt.
Shantabai v. State of Bombay, AIR 1958 Patna High Court CWJC No.12297 of 2019
dt.01-10-2019 SC 532 : Satish Chand Makhan v. Govardhan Das Byas, (1984) 1 SCC
369: (AIR 1984 SC 143) and Bajaj Auto Ltd. v.
Behari Lal Kohli, AIR 1989 SC 1806)."
12. But the above finding does not exhaust the scope of the issue whether the appellant is a lessee of
the building. A lease of immovable property is defined in Section 105 of the TP Act. A transfer of a
right to enjoy a property in consideration of a price paid or promised to be rendered periodically or
on specified occasions is the basic fabric for a valid lease. The provision says that such a transfer can
be made expressly or by implication. Once there is such a transfer of right to enjoy the property a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/110170243/ 9
Thakur Rama Raman vs The Patna Municipal Corporation on 1 October, 2019
lease stands created. What is mentioned in the three paragraphs of the first part of Section 107 of
the TP Act are only the different modes of how leases are created. The first paragraph has been
extracted above and it deals with the mode of creating the particular kinds of leases mentioned
therein. The third paragraph can be read along with the above as it contains a condition to be
complied with if the parties choose to create a lease as per a registered instrument mentioned
therein. All other leases, if created, necessarily fall within the ambit of the second paragraph. Thus,
dehors the instrument parties can create a lease as envisaged in the second paragraph of Section 107
which reads thus:
"All other leases of immovable property may be made either by a registered
instrument or by oral agreement accompanied by delivery of possession."
"13. When lease is a transfer of a right to enjoy the property and such transfer can be made expressly
or by implication, the mere fact that an unregistered instrument came into existence would not
stand in the way of the court to determine whether there was in fact a lease otherwise than through
such deed." "14. When it is admitted by both sides that the appellant was inducted into the
possession of the building by the owner thereof and that appellant was paying monthly rent or had
Patna High Court CWJC No.12297 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 agreed to pay rent in respect of the
building, the legal character of the appellant's possession has to be attributed to a jural relationship
between the parties. Such a jural relationship, on the fact-situation of this case, cannot be placed
anything different from that of lessor and lessee falling within the purview of the second paragraph
of Section 107 of the TP Act extracted above. From the pleadings of the parties there is no possibility
for holding that the nature of possession of the appellant in respect of the building is anything other
than as a lessee."
18. In view of the laws laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court on the subject, this Court would
have no hesitation in recording that the petitioner in this case has been able to establish a jural
relationship of a lessor and a lessee, he was enjoying the possession of the KIOSK of lessee after
paying the total consideration amount which was reserved as premium for the 11 years.
19. Having reached to the aforesaid conclusion that the petitioner was under a jural relationship and
was in fact a lessee of the KIOSK, this Court also finds that the petitioner was earlier allotted the
KIOSK for book selling and he got the permission to use the KIOSK for breakfast etc. whereafter he
was using the same for 'Amul Parlour'. The petitioner was served with notice that he was using extra
vacant space in front of his KIOSK for which he was liable to pay a sum of Rs. 6,83,208/- vide
Annexure 'PMC/C'. The petitioner had represented against the same and his Patna High Court
CWJC No.12297 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 objection to the demand was still pending with the
Corporation. In these circumstances when the notices dated 08.06.2019 was issued under the
signature of the Director, Urban Project of the Corporation, which contains the following three
general kind of allegations which are as under:-
"(i) The period of lease of the KIOSK constructed in the set back of the commercial
building have lapsed.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/110170243/ 10
Thakur Rama Raman vs The Patna Municipal Corporation on 1 October, 2019
(ii) It is often seen that the allottees of the KIOSK are using the vacant land in front of
their allotted KIOSK and thereby they have encroached upon the same by keeping
table, chair and other materials illegally which is also causing congestion in
movement of vehicles and parking and
(iii) No construction may be done in the set back of the commercial building in terms
of the Building Byelaws 2014, para -02 (117) and (118), therefore, the KIOSKs are
illegal construction which are required to be demolished.
The respondents say that the notice was sent through Dak Peon but the person present there refused
to receive the same. In their counter affidavit, the respondents Corporation further submitted that
when the order dated 15.06.2019 was sent for service, the person present at the spot refused to
accept the same. In the opinion of this Court, these are only vague statements of the respondent
Corporation. Neither the process server report on the back of the notice dated 08.06.2019 shows
that two whom the notice was sought to be served and who had refused the same nor as regards the
letter dated 15.06.2019 any such endorsement has been made."
20. A glance over the entire facts and circumstances show that the notice dated 08.06.2019 was
served upon the petitioner on Patna High Court CWJC No.12297 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 14.06.019
and on the same day the petitioner had submitted his response but as it appears the Commissioner
of the Corporation had already proceeded to pass an order for cancellation of lease /allotment as the
case may be in his own understanding. He had taken a decision on 14.06.2019 which nowhere
mentions the response submitted by the petitioner. The order dated 14.06.2019 did not mention the
show cause notice dated 08.06.2019 and any attempt to serve the same on the petitioner. The order
has been issued vide letter dated 7717A on 15.06.2019. This Court sitting in its writ jurisdiction
would not delve upon the reasons mentioned in the letter dated 15.06.2019 because the Court is not
acting as a fact finding Court and whether the reasons provided therein are true, correct and
justified are the matters which could have been looked into and examined only by a competent
court/body in accordance with law. This Court is, however, examining the decision making process,
the arbitrariness in such decision making process writs large when this Court finds that cancellation
of the allotment of KIOSK and demolition thereof cannot be justified in the manner which has been
sought to be done in haste without giving an appropriate opportunity to the petitioner to defend
himself. The issue was with regard to the encroachment over the vacant area falling in front of the
KIOSK and the encroachment if any on the Patna High Court CWJC No.12297 of 2019
dt.01-10-2019 vacant area of the land could have been removed by the authorities of the Corporation
but cancellation of the allotment and demolition of the KIOSK by the same strokes of pen and action
demonstrate that the Municipal Commissioner and the authorities of the Corporation while
exercising his power had exceeded the same and did not follow the minimum requirement of law to
give an appropriate opportunity of hearing to the petitioner that too when the petitioner and his
staffs whosoever were there were going to have a civil consequence of being deprived of their
business and employment respectively even as a same had potential to evict them and their family in
many ways. Such overnight action of cancellation of KIOSK and demolition by oral order has to be
deprecated as it has happened again due to total unmindful and irresponsible action of a statutory
authority misusing his power whimsically and capriciously.

21. In the case of Bhola Sah and Ors. Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors. reported in 1999 (2) PLJR 851 the
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Aftab Alam (as His Lordship then was) was considering the case of demolition
of houses without taking measurement in presence of the house owner or his representative and
without giving them prior intimation regarding the date and time when the measurements would be
taken. Such demolitions were taking place Patna High Court CWJC No.12297 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019
on the plea being taken by the respondent authorities that they were acting under the orders of this
Court in writ petition being C.W.J.C. No. 2290 of 1990 (Arun Kumar Mukherjee vs. State of Bihar).
This Hon'ble Court having taken note of the facts of those cases and the various orders passed by the
Hon'ble Division Bench in the case of Arun Mukherjee held that the petitioners had perfect title over
the disputed plot of land and the constructions made thereon and the respondent authorities had no
material to assume that the disputed plot of land were portions of road or road flanks. Learned
Single Judge has held that the respondent authorities were acting arbitrarily in the name of order of
this Court. At the relevant time the Court imposed a cost of Rs. 15,000/- against the District
Magistrate, Purnea and Rs. 10,000/- against the District Magistrate, West Champaran at Bettiah. As
regards the compensation and damages the Hon'ble Court found that it would require arriving at
findings of fact in the light of the evidence led by the parties, therefore, it was left for the petitioners
to claim the relief of compensation / damages by filing proper suits before Civil Courts of competent
jurisdiction.
22. In the case of the The Company Bagh Dookandar Sangh & Ors. Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors.
reported in 2007 (2) PLJR 179 the learned Single Judge was considering a Patna High Court CWJC
No.12297 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 challenge to the order dated 18.08.2005 passed by the trial court
rejecting the application of the plaintiff in the court below for a direction to the respondents to
restore status quo. It was found that during the pendency of the injunction petition the respondent
authorities had forcibly removed the plaintiffs and had demolished certain such premises along the
Company Bagh Road Shops. The learned Single Judge relied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Bishan Das vs. State of Punjab reported in AIR 1961 Supreme Court
1570 and recorded in paragraph 7 as under:
"7. Reference may be made to the case of Bishan Das v. State of Punjab AIR 1961 SC
1570 a Constitution Bench judgment and in particular to what is said in paragraphs
12, 13 and 14 thereof:
"...........and has contended that Ramji Das himself admitted that he was a mere
trustee. Be that so; but that does not give the State or its executive officers the right to
take the law into their own hands and remove the trustee by an executive order. We
must, therefore, repeal the argument based on the contention that the petitioners
were trespassers and could be removed by an executive order. The argument is not
only specious but highly dangerous by reason of its implications and impact on law
and order.
It is enough to say that they are bona fide in possession of the constructions in
question and could not be removed except under authority of law. The respondents
clearly violated their fundamental rights by depriving them of possession of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/110170243/ 12
Thakur Rama Raman vs The Patna Municipal Corporation on 1 October, 2019
Dharmsala by executive orders.
Before we part with this case, we feel it is our duty to say that the executive action
taken in this case by the State and its officers is destructive of the basic principle of
the rule of law. Patna High Court CWJC No.12297 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 The facts
and the position in law thus clearly are (1) that the buildings constructed on this piece
of Government land did not belong to Government, (2) that the petitioners were in
possession and occupation of the buildings and (3) that by virtue of enactments
binding on the Government, the petitioners could be dispossessed if at all, only in
pursuance of a decree of a civil Court obtained in proceedings properly initiated. In
these circumstances the action of the Government in taking the law into their hands
and dispossessing the petitioners by the display of force, exhibits a callous disregard
of the normal requirements of the rule of law apart from what might legitimately and
reasonably be expected from a Government functioning in a society governed by a
Constitution which guarantees to its citizens against arbitrary invasion by the
executive of peaceful possession of property. As pointed out by this Court in Wazir
Chand v. State of Himachal Pradesh, 1955 (1) SCR 408 : (AIR 1954 SC 415), the State
or its executive officers cannot interfere with the rights of others unless they can
point to some specific rule of law which authorises their acts. In Ram Prasad Narayan
Sahi v. State of Bihar, 1953 SCR 1129 : (AIR 1953 SC 215), this Court said that nothing
is more likely to drain the vitality from the rule of law than legislation which singles
out a particular individual from his fellow subjects and visits him with a disability
which is not imposed upon the others. We have here a highly discriminatory and
autocratic act which deprives a person of the possession of property without
reference to any law or legal authority. Even if the property was trust property it is
difficult to see how the Municipal Committee, Barnala, can step in as trustee on an
executive determination only. The reasons given for this extra-ordinary action are, to
quote what we said in Sahi's case (supra), remarkable for their disturbing
implications."
23. In the case of M/s Maa Durga Enterprises vs. The State of Bihar & Ors. reported in 2009 (2)
PLJR 1000, learned Patna High Court CWJC No.12297 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 Single Judge of this
court was considering the challenge to the action of respondent BIADA in cancelling the land of
BISCOMAUN, the said order of cancellation had already been set aside by the Court, the question
before the Court was as to what relief, the petitioner was entitled to. Relying upon the judgment of
the Hon'le Supreme Court in the case of Chairman, Railway Board and Others vs. Chandrma Das
(Mrs.) and Others reported in AIR 2000 Supreme Court 988, learned writ Court found that the
Hon'ble Supreme Court had held the Central Government vicariously liable for the tortious acts
committed by its employees in its building. Their Lordships of Hon'ble Supreme Court have held in
paragraph 9 as under:-
"9. ....... Though, initially a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution relating to
contractual matters was held not to lie, the law underwent a change by subsequent
decisions and it was noticed that even though the petition may relate essentially to a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/110170243/ 13
Thakur Rama Raman vs The Patna Municipal Corporation on 1 October, 2019
contractual matter, it would still be amenable to the writ jurisdiction of the High
Court under Article 226 of the Constitution.........".
24. Further the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of SAHELI, a Women's
Resources Centre through Ms. Nalini Bhanot and Others vs. Commission of Police, Delhi and Others
reported in AIR 1990 Supreme Court 513 wherein, their Lordships held referring to the case of
Joginder Kaur vs. The Patna High Court CWJC No.12297 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 Punjab State,
reported in 1968Acc CJ at p. 32: (1969) Lab. C 501 at P. 504 (Punj.) held as under"
"In the matter of liability of the State for the torts committed by its employees, it is
now the settled law that the State is liable for tortious acts committed by its
employees in the course of their employment."
25. Further in the case of State of Rajasthan vs. Mst. Vidhyawati reported in AIR 1962 Supreme
Court 933 it has been held in paragraph 13 of SAHELI (supra) :-
"Viewing the case from the point of view of first principles, there should be no
difficulty in holding that the State should be as much liable for tort in respect of a
tortious act committed by its servant within the scope of his employment and
functioning as such as any other employer. The immunity of the Crown in the United
Kingdom was based on the old feudalistic notions of Justice, namely, that the King
was incapable of doing a wrong, and, therefore, of authorizing or instigating one, and
that he could not be sued in his own courts. In India, ever since the time of the East
India Company, the sovereign has been held liable to be sued in tort or in contract,
and the Common Law immunity never operated in India......"
26. Considering the question as to what would be the consequence on the ground that the officers
were exercising either statutory power or powers akin to statutory powers, the learned Single Judge
held in paragraph 33 of the judgment in the case of M/s Maa Durga Enterprises (supra):-
"33.........In my view, the result would be total anarchy. An Officer could violate and
trample upon the impunity, the rights of citizens and then sit back and say that I may
have acted Patna High Court CWJC No.12297 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 wrongly and
caused the injury, my order can be set aside, but, I am not answerable for my actions.
In a democratic society governed by rule of law, such a position is wholly
unacceptable. An Officer of State is held liable and is answerable for his actions,
because that is the only check on otherwise drastic power capable of causing
irreparable loss to citizens. For example, a Licensing Authority cannot say that I have
wrongly cancelled your licence depriving you of right to do business, earn livelihood
and live in a dignified manner. Court can set aside my order, but, I am not
answerable for the loss caused. If such is permitted then statutory powers would
flagrantly violated to the detriment of the citizen's rights with no safeguard or no
relief to the citizen, who may have suffered irreparable injury, in the meantime till
the orders are set aside. It is to check this utter disregard to rule of law that the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/110170243/ 14
Thakur Rama Raman vs The Patna Municipal Corporation on 1 October, 2019
Courts are holding authorities answerable for their action......."
27. The learned Writ Court relied upon the various judgments of this Court such as Md. Abu
Hasnain vs. State of Bihar & Ors. reported in 2007(1)PLJR 797 ; Mahesh Ram & Ors vs. State of
Bihar reported in 2007 (4)PLJR 250 ; Shishir Kumar Jain vs. The Patna Regional Development
Authority & Ors. reported in 2008 (1) PLJR 707 (DB) ; R.G. Holdings Private Limited vs. The State
of Bihar & Anr. reported in 2008 (2) PLJR 538.
28. In the case of Shishir Kumar Jain (supra) the Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court while holding
that the action of the PRDA was not authorized by law and the same is a malice in law and mala fide
from all angles with an intention to remove the Patna High Court CWJC No.12297 of 2019
dt.01-10-2019 tenant from the old building. The Hon'ble Division Benchof this Court awarded a
compensation of Rs. 5 lakhs. The Hon'ble Division Bench relied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Vannattankandy Ibrayi vs. Kunhabdulla Hajee reported in 2001(1)
SCC 564.
29. The Letters Patent Appeal being L.P.A. No. 1050 of 2009 preferred against the judgment of the
learned co-ordinate Bench in case of M/s Maa Durga Enterprises (supra) has been dismissed and
even the Hon'ble Supreme Court dismissed the Special Leave Petition (Civil) Diary No. 8855/2018
preferred against the order of the Hon'ble Division Bench while hearing the matter with it's
analogous cases.
30. One of the grounds stated in the impugned order dated 15.06.2019, which contains the decision
of the Municipal Commissioner of the Corporation taken on 14.06.2019, is that the KIOSKs situated
in the set-back area is against the Building Byelaws. In this connection, the petitioner has made a
specific statement that the KIOSKs were constructed under the sanction plan of the Mauryalok
Commercial Complex and the then 'PRDA' had made allotment of KIOSKs after inviting the public
at large through notice published in the newspaper. The fact that the KIOSK was constructed under
the Master Plan of the Mauryalok Patna High Court CWJC No.12297 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019
Commercial Complex has not been denied. Neither counter affidavit nor in its supplementary
counter affidavit, the Corporation has brought on record any document to show that these KIOSKs
were situated in the set-back of the building rather the material shows that the KIOSKs had vacant
land in front of it and there were movements of vehicles from the side of KIOSKs. These materials in
fact go a long way to show that the plea that the KIOSK was situated in the set-back has no basis to
stand.
31. Be that as it may, even going by the provisions of the Byelaws of 2014, it is found that in terms of
the Byelaws No. 17, if the authority finds at any stage that the construction is in violation of the any
of the provisions of the Byelaws, it has to notify the owner giving details of deviation and if the
constructions made are not corrected and those are not within condonable limits, the authority may
cancel the building permission and shall cause notice of such cancellation to be pasted upon the said
construction. The notification under sub-bye law no. (2) of Byelaws No. 17 provides for the pasting
of notice on the premises also cast an obligation on the authority to publish the notification as public
notice and also on the website. This procedure has to be followed in case of deviation of layout as
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/110170243/ 15
Thakur Rama Raman vs The Patna Municipal Corporation on 1 October, 2019
well. Under sub-clause no. (5) of Byelaws No. 17, an appeal Patna High Court CWJC No.12297 of
2019 dt.01-10-2019 against the order under sub-bye law no. (2) shall lie with the respective
tribunals under the Act and Municipal Act. Bye Law No. 24 again casts some obligations upon the
authority before carrying the demolition of a building. Bye Law No. 24 reads as under:
"24. Demolition of building.- (1) Before a building is demolished, the owner shall
notify all utilities having service connections within the building, sch as water,
electricity, gas, sewer and other connections. A permit to demolish a building shall
not be issued until a release is obtained from the utilities departments stating that
their 0respective service connections and appurtenant equipment, such as meters
and regulators have been removed or sealed and plugged in a safe manner. (2) The
owner shall take all precautionary measures to avoid noise and dust pollution and
shall not create any inconvenience to the neighboring plot owners."
32. This Court has no difficulty in concluding that the Municipal Commissioner of the Corporation
while directing oral demolition of the KIOSK did not take care of the provisions of the Byelaws of
2014 and the reference of the said Byelaws saying that the KIOSK was situated in the set back is only
a pretext and defence which he has sought to take against his own action which he was very well
knowing that he was taking such action in haste with sole intention not to allow the petitioner to
knock the door of the court of law. Patna High Court CWJC No.12297 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019
33. At this stage, this Court would rely upon the judgment of the learned co-ordinate Bench of this
Court in the case of M/s Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited Vs. The State of Bihar and Ors.
reported in 1996 (2) PLJR 621 which has been affirmed by Hon'ble Division Bench in L.P.A. NO.
1047 of 1996 and a SLP (C) No. 001506 of 1998 preferred agaisnt the same was also dismissed. In
the said case the then 'PRDA' and its officers had demolished a retail petrol outlet of the petitioner
company situated at a plot of land which was given to the petitioner company on lease by Patna
Women's College, Patna. In the said case the petitioner had entered in the premises on the basis of a
registered lease deed but thereafter, though the petitioner company continued to paying the rent in
terms of the lease deed but subsequently fresh lease deed were not created. It was the contention of
the College authorities that they had terminated the lease and had not accepted the rent from 1994.
The then 'PRDA' demolished the entire petrol pump and structure standing there on when the
courts were closed on account of Holidays for 'Holi', no prior notice or intimation or show cause of
anykind was given to the petitioner and no suit was pending against the petitioner for eviction. It
was the contention of the 'PRDA' in the said case that the building was demolished because it had
come up without any Patna High Court CWJC No.12297 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 sanction plan. The
authorities came with a plea that there was a Master Plan approved in the year 1964 and the same
was approved in the year 1967 but in the said Master Plan did not show any Petrol Pump in the area
in question nor does the Master Plan of 1985 show any such Petrol Pump.
34. In the aforementioned background, the learned co- ordinate Bench proceeded to consider the
matter. In paragraphs 31, 33, 39, 40, 41, 54, 55, 57 and 58 in the case of M/s Hindustan Petroleum
(Supra) are quoted hereunder:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/110170243/ 16
Thakur Rama Raman vs The Patna Municipal Corporation on 1 October, 2019
"31. Such a lease is not a mere contract but it constitutes a transfer of interest in land
and creates a right in rem and the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that such a right of
the tenant amounts to a right to property within the meaning of Article 19(1)(f) of the
Constitution. (See the Constitution Bench judgment of the Supreme Court in the case
of Bombay Co-operative v. Lala Panchan, reported in AIR 1965 SC 1005, at paragraph
18, page 1014 of the report). Even though with the deletion of Article 19(1)(f) from the
Constitution of India the property right has ceased to be fundamental, but it has
nonetheless been protected under Article 300-A of the Constitution as a
constitutional right."
"33. Even if it is assumed that the predecessor-in-interest of the petitioner Company
inducted in the plot of land as a sub-lessee in 1958 has subsequently become a tenant
at sufferance, it is settled beyond all controversy that such a tenant cannot be evicted
except in accordance with the procedure established under the law. Learned counsel
for the petitioner Company in support of this proposition has relied on a series of
judgments starting from the decision of the Bombay High Court in the case of
Brigadier K.K. Verma and another vs. Union of India and other, reported in A.I.R.
1954 Bombay 358. Chief Justice Chagla (as His Lordship then was) making a valid
distinction between Indian and English law on the Patna High Court CWJC No.12297
of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 point made the following crisp observations in paragraph 4,
page 360 of the report and they are quoted below:--
"Under the Indian law, the possession of a tenant who has ceased to be a tenant is
protected by law. Although he may not have a right to continue in possession after
the termination of the tenancy, his possession is juridical and that possession is
protected by statute. Under S. 9 of the Specific Relief Act, a tenant who has ceased to
be a tenant may sue for possession against his landlord if the landlord deprives him
of possession otherwise than in due course of law, but a trespasser who has been
thrown out of possession cannot go to Court under S. 9 and claim possession against
the true owner.
Therefore, our law makes a clear and sharp distinction between a trespasser and an
erstwhile tenant. Whereas the trespasser's possession is never juridical and never
protected by law, the possession of an erstwhile tenant is juridical and is protected by
law. Therefore, as far as the Indian law is concerned, an erstwhile tenant can never
become a trespasser."
This is still the law. So the petitioner Company can never be treated as a trespasser."
"39. In the emerging rainbow of the constitutional law one thing is clear that no
executive authority can interfere with the rights of liberty and property of any subject
save and except on the basis of a legal provision authorising him to do so. The dictum
of Lord Atkin in this connection may be remembered. While delivering the leading
judgment in the judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Eshugbavi Eleko v.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/110170243/ 17
Thakur Rama Raman vs The Patna Municipal Corporation on 1 October, 2019
Officers Administering the Government of Nigeria, 1931 A.C. 662, His Lordship
observed as follows:--
"In accordance with British Jurisprudence no member of the executive can interfere
with the liberty or property of a British subject except on the condition that he can
support the legality of his action before a Court of Justice. And it is the tradition of
British Justice that Judges should not shrink from deciding such issues in the face of
the executive."
"40. The same jurisprudence and traditions prevail in this country also. Sitting in a
Constitution Bench, Chief Justice S.R. Das (as His Lordship then was) expressly
approved the above dictum in Patna High Court CWJC No.12297 of 2019
dt.01-10-2019 Basheshar Nath v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Delhi, reported in
A.I.R. 1959 S.C. page 140 at page 158, paragraph 18 of the reports. Even prior to that
in 1956 also in the decision in the case of Bidi Supply Co. v. Union of India, reported
in A.I.R. 1956 S.C. 479, the Supreme Court approved the said approach of Lord Atkin
(in paragraph 9, page 484 of the report)."
"41. With the elegance so natural to him, Lord Denning in his Hamlyn Lectures (First
Series) captioned as "Freedom under the Law" delivered in 1949, made the following
prophetic observations:--
"All power corrupts. Total power corrupts absolutely. And the trouble about it is that
an official who is the possessor of power often does not realise when he is abusing it.
Its influence is so insidious that he may believe that he is acting for the public good
when, in truth, all he is doing is to assert his own brief authority. The Jack-in-office
never realises that he is being a little tyrant."
And those observations admittedly fit in with the situation here."
"54.Demolition of structures can never be used as a handy substitute for eviction of
tenants and lessees. This has precisely been done in this case. These aspects of the
case, if I may say, in the language of Supreme Court are remarkable for their
disturbing implications. (Ram Prasad Narayan Sahi v. The State of Bihar, reported in
A.I.R. 1953 SC page 215). Thus Rule of Law has been circumvented and overreached.
The College authorities knew it very well that in order to evict the petitioner
Company it will have to file a suit. Instead of doing that, the so-called understanding
was reached with P.R.D.A. authorities and by demolishing the structure, the
petitioner Company has been got rid of. This Court strongly condemns this
subversion of Rule of Law by the P.R.D.A. authorities at the instance of the College
authorities."
"55. The law on this point was settled long ago by the Privy Council and also in the
decision of the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in the case of Bishan Das v.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/110170243/ 18
Thakur Rama Raman vs The Patna Municipal Corporation on 1 October, 2019
The State of Punjab, reported in A.I.R. 1961 S.C. page 1570. Here this Court can do no
better than quote from paragraph 14 (page 1575 of the report) the Patna High Court
CWJC No.12297 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 relevant excerpts from the judgment in
Bishan Das's case (supra):
--
"The petitioners could be dispossessed, if at all, only in pursuance of a decree of a
Civil Court obtained in proceedings properly initiated. In these circumstances the
action of the Government in taking the law into their hands and dispossessing the
petitioners by the display of force, exhibits a callous disregard of the normal
requirements of the rule of law apart from what might legitimately and reasonably be
expected from a Government functioning in a society governed by a Constitution
which guarantees to its citizens against arbitrary invasion by the executive of peaceful
possession of property."
"57. The law declared by the Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court in Yar
Mohammad v. Lakshmi Das reported in A.I.R. 1959 Allahabad page 1 was also
approved in Lallu Jaswant Singh (supra). The Full Bench of the Allahabad High
Court observed:
"Law respects possession even if there is no title to support it. It will not permit any
person to take the law in his own hands and to dispossess a person in actual
possession without having recourse to a Court."
58. The ratio of Bishan Das (supra) has been affirmed in State of U.P. v. Maharaja Dharmendar
Prasad Singh reported in A.I.R. 1989 S.C. 997. In paragraph 13 of the report at p. 1004, it has been
held that the possession of the lessee, even after the expiry of the lease or its termination is juridical
in nature and 'forcible dispossession is prohibited' and the 'lessee cannot be dispossessed otherwise
than in due course of law'."
35. In the case of M/s Hindustan Petroleum (Supra), learned co-ordinate Bench while leaving it
open for the petitioner company to seek damages or compensation in accordance with law before a
competent Civil Court imposed a cost of Rs. 50,000/- against the 'PRDA'.
Patna High Court CWJC No.12297 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019
36. In the aforementioned background and the judicial pronouncements on the subject, this Court is
of the considered opinion that in the admitted facts of this case where the action of the respondent
Corporation and its authorities have been found to be wholly arbitrary in cancellation of
lease/allotment and demolition thereof overnight on a holiday in order to deprive the petitioner
from knocking the door of the Court which was going to re-open only on 17th of June, 2019, this
Court would direct that the Municipal Commissioner, Patna shall now examine the matter as to
whether the KIOSK in question was there in the Master Plan of Mauryalok Complex or not ?
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/110170243/ 19
Thakur Rama Raman vs The Patna Municipal Corporation on 1 October, 2019
Whether it could be said to be situated in the set-back of the commercial building ? While
examining, the Municipal Commissioner shall give an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner. If
ultimately it is found that the KIOSK was in the Master Plan of the complex and the same was not in
the set-back of the building, the KIOSK No. 02 shall be reconstructed to its original position and
possession thereof must be handed over to the petitioner for the remaining period of
lease/allotment (after leaving the intervening period of demolition to handing over of possession)
subject to the same terms and conditions on which the petitioner was allowed to continue earlier.
Such examination, decision and if required reconstruction of the Patna High Court CWJC No.12297
of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 KIOSK and handing over possession in accordance with this order be
completed within a period of three months from the date of receipt/production of a copy of this
order.
37. If it is found that the KIOSKs were earlier constructed in violation of the Master Plan of the
complex and were in the set- back of the building then the authorities of the PMC/Corporation will
have to blame themselves for constructing the KIOSK against the Master Plan of the complex and
then offering the same to the public at large by inviting them to apply for allotment of the KIOSK,
allowing them to continue for over three decades and then ousting the allottee abruptly depriving
them of their livelihood. The PMC/Corporation cannot be allowed to take benefit of their own wrong
putting the same as a ground for ousting the petitioner. In such circumstance though the Court will
not direct for construction of the KIOSK against the building bye-laws, this Court deems it just and
proper to exercise its extra ordinary writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India
to award compensation to the petitioner for violation of his constitutional right to property and right
to livelihood which could not have been taken away without following the due process of law. It is
well settled in law that a claim in public law for compensation for contravention of the constitutional
rights guaranteed in the Patna High Court CWJC No.12297 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 constitution is a
remedy available to a citizen of India and for protection of such rights a claim based on strict
liability by taking recourse to a constitutional remedy is distinct from, and in addition to, a remedy
in private law for damages for the tort resulting from the contravention of the fundamental rights.
In the case of Smt. Nilabati Behera @ Lalita Behera Vs. State of Orissa and Others. Reported in AIR
1993 Supreme Court 1960 while considering the case of a custodial death when a question arose as
to whether Hon'ble Supreme Court could have granted compensation to a citizen who was deprived
of his fundamental rights, the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed thus:-
"................ It would, however, be appropriate to spell out clearly the principle on
which the liability of the State arises in such cases for payment of compensation and
the distinction between this liability and the liability in private law for payment of
compensation in an action on tort. It may be mentioned straightway that award of
compensation in a proceeding under Article 32 by this court or by the High Court
under Article 226 of the Constitution is a remedy available in public law, based on
strict liability for contravention of fundamental rights to which the principle of
sovereign immunity does not apply, even though it may be available as a defence in
private law in an action based on tort. This is a distinction between the two remedies
to be borne in mind which also indicates the basis on which compensation is awarded
in such proceedings................"

Thakur Rama Raman vs The Patna Municipal Corporation on 1 October, 2019
Patna High Court CWJC No.12297 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019
38. In the case of Rudal Sah vs. State of Bihar reported in (1983) SCR 508: AIR 1983 SC1086 while
considering the case of violation of the petitioner's right to personal liberty under Article 21 of the
Constitution, Chandrachud, C.J., (as his Lordship then was) observed as under:
"It is true that Article 32 cannot be used as a substitute for the enforcement of rights
and obligations which can be enforced efficaciously through the ordinary processes of
Courts, Civil and Criminal. A money claim has therefore to be agitated in and
adjudicated upon in a suit instituted in a court of lowest grade competent to try it.
But the important question for our consideration is whether in the exercise of its
jurisdiction under Article 32, this Court can pass an order for the payment of money
if such an order is in the nature of compensation consequential upon the deprivation
of a fundamental right. The instant case is illustrative of such cases....... ...........The
petitioner could have been relegated to the ordinary remedy of a suit if his claim to
compensation was factually controversial, in the sense that a civil court may or may
not have upheld his claim. But we have no doubt that if the petitioner files a suit to
recover damages for his illegal detention, a decree for damages would have to be
passed in that suit, though it is not possible to predicate, in the absence of evidence,
the precise amount which would be decreed in his favour. In these circumstances, the
refusal of this Court to pass an order of compensation in favour of the petitioner will
be doing mere lip-service to his fundamental right to liberty which the State
Government has so grossly violated. Article 21 which guarantees the right to life and
liberty will be denuded of its significant content if the power of this Court were
limited to passing orders to release from illegal detention. One of the telling ways in
which the violation of that right can reasonably be prevented and due compliance
with the mandate of Article 21 secured, is to mulct its violators in the payment of
monetary compensation. Administrative sclerosis leading to flagrant infringements
of fundamental rights cannot be corrected by any other method open to the judiciary
to adopt. The right to compensation is some palliative for the unlawful acts of Patna
High Court CWJC No.12297 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 instrumentalities which act in the
name of public interest and which present for their protection the powers of the state
as shield. If Civilisation is not to perish in this country as it has perished in some
others too well-known to suffer mention, it is necessary to educate ourselves into
accepting that, respect for the rights of individuals is the true bastion of democracy.
Therefore, the State must repair the damage done by its officers to the petitioner's
rights. It may have recourse against those officers."
39. In the aforesaid settled proposition of law when this Court considers the present case and it is
found that if the plea of the PMC/Corporation is that the KIOSK in question had been constructed
against the Master Plan of the Mauralok Complex and it was constructed in the set-back of the
commercial building and then it was offered to the public at large by inviting them for allotment of
KIOSK, and ultimately it is found factually correct it is the PMC/Corporation who is to be held liable
for the same and if by taking a plea to that effect the petitioner is being abruptly thrown out during
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/110170243/ 21
Thakur Rama Raman vs The Patna Municipal Corporation on 1 October, 2019
the validity period of the allotment of shop and thereby he is deprived of his constitutional right to
the property in the form of his rights to do business in the said KIOSK and thereby he is being
deprived of the constitutional right to livelihood which is directly linked to Article 21 of the
Constitution of India, there would be no difficulty for any court of law to hold the PMC/Corporation
guilty for brazenly violating the constitutional right of the petitioner. In such circumstance, this
Patna High Court CWJC No.12297 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 Court would come to a conclusion that the
petitioner would be entitled for a compensation and cost assessed together at Rs. 5 lakhs. In the year
1995 in the case of Hindustan Petroleum (supra) the learned co-ordinate Bench had awarded a sum
of Rs. 50,000/- as cost. In many a cases while relying upon the previous case laws, the court of law
have compared the cost awarded previously in a litigation by a court and then by considering the
rise in price index and living cost, the Courts have awarded compensation at a rate which would be
in consonance with the previous compensation awarded by the Court. After 25 years approximately
the amount of Rs. 5 lakhs together as compensation and cost would be reasonable. This amount will
be payable to the petitioner in case of the second situation if the KIOSK cannot be constructed due
to it falling in the set-back area which has been discussed by the court hereinabove. The
compensation and cost shall be payable within three months from the date of decision making by
the PMC/Corporation pursuant to the order of this Court.
40. If the KIOSK is restored to the petitioner pursuant to the order of this Court, the petitioner shall
be at liberty to seek the loss and damages for the alleged loss of business etc. for the intervening
period from the date of demolition till the handing Patna High Court CWJC No.12297 of 2019
dt.01-10-2019 over of possession of the KIOSK again to the petitioner. Such claim for loss and
damages may be brought before the competent Civil Court and the same will be considered by the
Civil Court in accordance with law without taking into the consideration any of the observations of
this Court hereinabove. The petitioner would, however, be entitled for the cost component i.e. the
cost of present litigation alone which is assessed at Rs. 1 lakh, the same will be payable to the
petitioner within the aforesaid period of three months. The PMC/Corporation, Shall, however, be at
liberty to proceed against and realise the compensation and cost amount from the erring officials in
accordance with law.
41. The writ application stands disposed of with the aforesaid observation sand directions.
