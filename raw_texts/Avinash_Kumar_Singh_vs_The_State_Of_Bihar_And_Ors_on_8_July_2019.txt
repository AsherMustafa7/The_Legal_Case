CAV JUDGMENT
Date : 08-07-2019
1. Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
2. The petitioner, who at the relevant time was
posted as Incharge Jail Superintendent, Sitamarhi, has
challenged the order dated 09.11.2017 issued by the General
Administration Department, contained in memo no. 4196,
whereby the petitioner has been awarded the punishment of
censure and stoppage of three increments with cumulative

effect as also for challenging the order dated 29.08.2018,
contained in Memo No. 11623, whereby the review application
Patna High Court CWJC No.5500 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019
2/15
of the petitioner has been rejected and the order of the
disciplinary authority imposing punishment upon him has been
affirmed and upheld.
3. The petitioner has prima facie challenged the
aforesaid orders on the ground that the major punishment was
awarded to him and his review petition was rejected without
the charges being proved against him. The further ground of
challenge is that the entire departmental proceeding is based
on an enquiry report submitted by the SDO and SDPO,
Sitamarhi, who had conducted an inspection of Sitamarhi jail
behind the back of the petitioner and they were not presented
before the disciplinary authority for proving their report or for
the petitioner to subject them to any cross-examination. The
other grounds of challenge are that the whole proceeding is
based on inference, and without specifically denying the
explanation offered by the petitioner. He has been held guilty
for not having discharged an obligation for which he was only
indirectly responsible. Lastly, it has been submitted that the
charges levelled against him are vague, intertwining with each
other and several allegations have been made in one charge

Avinash Kumar Singh vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 8 July, 2019
with an inference from several acts of omissions and
commissions.
4. Before appreciating the contentions of the
petitioner, it would be necessary to refer to the charges
levelled against him in the departmental proceeding. The first
charge relates to the SDO and SDPO having found certain
impermissible articles in the jail at the time of surprise raid. In
the same charge, it has been alleged that a temple was found
to be under construction inside the jail premises and
construction materials were found strewn all over. Those
construction materials could possibly have been used as
weapon of assault in case of any internecine conflict between
the groups of prisoners. The aforesaid charge further indicates
that it was confidentially/reliably learnt that the temple was
being constructed by one Madhav Chaudhary, a prisoner
confined in Ward No. 6 of Sitamarhi Jail. During the month of
Ramjan, another prisoner, namely, Santosh Jha had thrown an
Iftaar party and Madhav Chaudhary had distributed clothes on
the occasion of Ramjan. A generator also was found to be
installed inside the jail at the instance of an NGO, about which
Patna High Court CWJC No.5500 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019
4/15
no enquiry had been made by the petitioner. Several new fans
were also found to have been installed and on enquiry it was
found that those had not been purchased by the jail
administration. It was, thus, found that two of the prisoners,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161848693/ 3
Avinash Kumar Singh vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 8 July, 2019
namely, Santosh Jha and Madhav Chaudhary were using their
money power which led to creation of groups inside the jail,
which had the potency of fomenting conflict. For these reasons,
the aforesaid charge indicates, recommendation was made for
transfer of Santosh Jha and Madhav Chaudhary to another jail.
5. The other charge practically reiterated the
elements of the first charge, namely, a dispute having erupted
on the decision of the government to transfer Madhav
Chaudhary and Santosh Jha from Sitamarhi Jail to another jail.
Had the aforesaid two prisoners been reigned-in, the possibility
of such a situation would not have arisen and, therefore, the
petitioner was responsible for the same as he had the
responsibility to maintain discipline in jail.
6. From the perusal of the charges, it becomes clear
that many grounds have been incorporated in each of the
charges and a departmental proceeding has been initiated
Patna High Court CWJC No.5500 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019
5/15
primarily on the basis of a report submitted by the SDO and
SDPO after a surprise inspection of the jail. The responsibility
of the petitioner for maintaining discipline in the jail and which
function does not seem to have been discharged effectively, is
the charge under both the heads.
7. It has been submitted on behalf of the petitioner
that he filed his reply to the aforesaid charge and also
furnished several documents depicting his innocence and that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161848693/ 4
Avinash Kumar Singh vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 8 July, 2019
he performed his functions to the best of his ability.
8. The sum and substance of the reply of the
petitioner is that apart from being the Incharge Jail
Superintendent, he was also carrying on other responsibilities
of Provident Fund Officer and Nodal Officer for one block. Apart
from this, he was also involved in MGNREGA work and
occasionally had to perform SECC inspection. The other
explanation offered by the petitioner is that the responsibility of
maintaining security of jail is not the exclusive responsibility of
the Superintendent of Jail but of the Superintendent Incharge
of Administration and Security also which is delineated in Rule
800 of the Jail Manual, 2012. All the failings in the jail
Patna High Court CWJC No.5500 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019
6/15
administration was promptly reported by the petitioner to the
IG, Prisons.
9. With respect to the installation of Generators
inside the Jail by NGO, the response of the petitioner is that no
permission was granted at his level. The dispute between two
groups took place on 09.08.2014 because of the decision of
the government to transfer two of the inmates of the Jail and
nothing would have happened if on the request of the
petitioner, sufficient/additional force would have been provided.
The request of the petitioner for providing additional force in
jail was never acceded to.
10. Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161848693/ 5
Avinash Kumar Singh vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 8 July, 2019
that no Presenting Officer was assigned and the Enquiry Officer
merely rested his opinion on the analysis of the enquiry report,
referred to above. The Enquiry Officer has but categorically
stated that whatever unauthorized articles were found in the
jail, the responsibility for that could not have been exclusively
saddled on the petitioner but on others as well. The report of
the Enquiry Officer, therefore, was that the petitioner was not
very alert and responsible and possessed somewhat lesser
Patna High Court CWJC No.5500 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019
7/15
administrative control of the jail. With respect to the second
charge, the enquiry officer has stated that the petitioner is
indirectly responsible for the occurrence which took place in
jail.
11. Relying on the aforesaid report, by resolution
dated 09.11.2017, contained in Memo No. 4196, the petitioner
was subjected to a punishment of censure and stoppage of
three increments with cumulative effect. The revision filed by
the petitioner has also been rejected by the order dated
29.08.2018
contained in memo no. 11623. Both the orders, therefore, have been challenged on the ground that
they do not take note of the explanations offered by the petitioner with respect to the charges and
that they have relied only on the inspection report, whose author was never examined during the
proceeding.
12. The challenge to the aforesaid orders are also on the ground that no second show-cause notice
has been issued to the petitioner.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161848693/ 6
Avinash Kumar Singh vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 8 July, 2019
13. It has also been alleged that the inspection report of jail though was supplied to him but the
documents which Patna High Court CWJC No.5500 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019 were relied upon in the
aforesaid report was never furnished to the petitioner despite his repeated request. On these
grounds, it has been urged, the orders be set aside.
14. As opposed to the aforesaid contentions raised on behalf of the petitioner, the learned counsel
for the State has stated that all the procedural formalities have been complied with and during the
enquiry it has conclusively been found that the petitioner soft-peddled the safety requirements in
the jail premises and, therefore, the orders impugned in the present writ petition ought not to be
disturbed.
15. A deeper probe and analysis of the materials placed before this Court, it appears that a surprise
inspection was made in the jail when the petitioner was not present. There is substance in the
contention of the petitioner that the charges are primarily based on the inspection report which also
finds echo in the enquiry officer's report as also in the order of the disciplinary authority and
revisional authority. What cannot be disputed is that the documents which were relied upon in the
inspection report have not been furnished to the petitioner. The charge memo was prepared in the
year 2014 but the Patna High Court CWJC No.5500 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019 departmental
proceeding was initiated in the year 2016. In the departmental proceeding, no witness has been
examined. The Presenting Officer also has not been examined and the orders are based upon the
joint inspection report and the explanation offered by the petitioner. The Jailor and other persons
ought to have been examined for proving the charge against the petitioner. The charges, though had
been put under two heads, but the ingredients overlapped and several factors have been coalesced in
one charge, making it vague and difficult to answer head-wise.
16. It is no doubt true that this Court in the writ jurisdiction would be slow in interfering with the
findings recorded in departmental enquiry by the disciplinary authority or the enquiry officer;
nonetheless it would only be an empty formality if it is not analyzed properly and in case of
necessity, be not interfered with. There has to be link evidence between the charges and the
conclusions arrived at and only one report cannot be the basis for holding a government servant
guilty. Even though this Court would not like to view the proceedings as if it were sitting in appeal
over such orders; nonetheless the Patna High Court CWJC No.5500 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019 power of
judicial review would lose its efficacy, if no interference in any circumstances is made.
17. In Nand Kishore Prasad Versus State of Bihar [(1979) 3 SCC 366), it has been held that a
disciplinary proceeding is in the nature of a quasi judicial function and therefore it is necessary that
disciplinary authority must arrive at its conclusion on the basis of such evidence which has some
definiteness and points to the guilt of the employee and does not leave the matter in a suspicious
state. Mere suspicion cannot take the place of proof even in domestic inquiries (Also refer to State of

Versus Commissioner of Police & Others [(1999) 2 SCC 10] .

Avinash Kumar Singh vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 8 July, 2019
18. In State of Uttaranchal and Others Versus Kharak Singh [(2008) 8 SCC 236] , the Supreme
Court has held that in an enquiry, the employer / department should take steps first to lead evidence
against the delinquent charged and Patna High Court CWJC No.5500 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019 give an
opportunity to him to cross-examine the witnesses of the employer. Only thereafter, the delinquent
be asked whether he wants to lead any evidence.
19. In Roop Singh Negi Versus Punjab National Bank and Others [(2009) 2 SCC 570], the Supreme
Court has in paragraph 14, 15 and 23 held as follows:
"14. Indisputably, a departmental proceeding is a quasi judicial proceeding. The
Enquiry Officer performs a quasi judicial function. The charges levelled against the
delinquent officer must be found to have been proved. The enquiry officer has a duty
to arrive at a finding upon taking into consideration the materials brought on record
by the parties. The purported evidence collected during investigation by the
Investigating Officer against all the accused by itself could not be treated to be
evidence in the disciplinary proceeding. No witness was examined to prove the said
documents.
The management witnesses merely tendered the documents and did not prove the
contents thereof. Reliance, inter alia, was placed by the Enquiry Officer on the Patna
High Court CWJC No.5500 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019 FIR which could not have been
treated as evidence.
15. We have noticed hereinbefore that the only basic evidence whereupon reliance
has been placed by the Enquiry Officer was the purported confession made by the
appellant before the police. According to the appellant, he was forced to sign on the
said confession, as he was tortured in the police station. The appellant being an
employee of the bank, the said confession should have been proved. Some evidence
should have been brought on record to show that he had indulged in stealing the
bank draft book. Admittedly, there was no direct evidence. Even there was no indirect
evidence. The tenor of the report demonstrates that the Enquiry Officer had made up
his mind to find him guilty as otherwise he would not have proceeded on the basis
that the offence was committed in such a manner that no evidence was left.
23. Furthermore, the order of the disciplinary authority as also the appellate
authority are not supported by Patna High Court CWJC No.5500 of 2019
dt.08-07-2019 any reason. As the orders passed by them have severe civil
consequences, appropriate reasons should have been assigned. If the enquiry officer
had relied upon the confession made by the appellant, there was no reason as to why
the order of discharge passed by the Criminal Court on the basis of self-same
evidence should not have been taken into consideration. The materials brought on
record pointing out the guilt are required to be proved. A decision must be arrived at
on some evidence, which is legally admissible. The provisions of the Evidence Act
may not be applicable in a departmental proceeding but the principles of natural
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/161848693/ 8
Avinash Kumar Singh vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 8 July, 2019
justice are. As the report of the Enquiry Officer was based on merely ipse dixit as also
surmises and conjectures, the same could not have been sustained. The inferences
drawn by the Enquiry Officer apparently were not supported by any evidence.
Suspicion, as is well known, however high may be, can under no circumstances be
held to be a substitute for legal proof."
Patna High Court CWJC No.5500 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019
20. Thus, for the reasons, namely, (a) the documents relied in the inspection report of jail premises
not having been furnished/supplied to the petitioner (b) no second show-cause notice having been
given to the petitioner (c) the Presenting Officer not appointed in the department proceeding (d)
complete reliance on the inspection report without the same having been proved (e) No evidence
having been led on behalf of the department and (f) the explanation offered by the petitioner to the
several heads of charges though categorized under two broad heads not having been taken into
account in correct perspective, the orders impugned in the present writ petition is wholly
unsustainable.
21. The orders impugned therefore are set aside.
22. The matter is remitted to the disciplinary authority to write out a fresh order in accordance with
law, after giving the complete inspection report to the petitioner and giving him an opportunity to
defend his case.
23. The departmental proceeding shall be concluded within a period of four months from the date of
production/communication of a copy of this order.
Patna High Court CWJC No.5500 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019
24. With the aforesaid observation / direction, this petition stands allowed to the extent indicated
above.
