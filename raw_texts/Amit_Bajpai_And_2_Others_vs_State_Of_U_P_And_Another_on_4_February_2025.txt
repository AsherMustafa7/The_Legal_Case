verify the fact as to whether the parties have entered into compromise, hence the
parties may approach the concerned court below and move an application with
respect to compromise between the parties, which will be decided in accordance with
law.
7. Whether a compromise has taken place or not can at best be ascertained by the
court, where the proceedings are pending, after ensuring the presence of the parties
before it.
