(ii) and pass any other reliefs to which the petitioner is entitled under the facts and circumstances of

2. Heard Sri.M.S.Shyam Sundar, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner's
counsel and Sri.B.N.Jagadeesha, learned Additional State Public Prosecutor for the
respondents-State.
3. Case of the petitioner is that Chowk Police, Kalaburagi, registered FIR against the petitioner and
others in Crime No.48/2022 for the offences punishable under Sections 109, 114, 119, 120-B, 201,
202, 204, 212, 409, 411, 420, 465, 468, 471, r/w Sections 34, 36, 37 and 149 of IPC, alleging that the
petitioner is involved in helping the candidates who wrote PSI examinations conducted on
03.10.2021 by receiving huge money and by providing Bluetooth to the candidates and also in
collusion with other accused tampered the OMR sheets and facilitated the candidates to get more
marks in the examination for selecting to the post of PSI. A WhatsApp message was viewed by the
public and the then Government entrusted the matter to one K.H.Dileep Kumar, Police Inspector of
CID, Bengaluru, to make enquiry and accordingly, after conducting enquiry, he has submitted
report stating involvement of the petitioner in helping the candidates for getting more marks.
Accordingly, a case was registered in Crime No.48/2022 before Chowk Police Station, Kalaburagi.
4. The State Government deputed a team consisting 18 persons, for the purpose of investigation and
during the investigation, it was found that this accused has involved in receiving money from
various candidates and helped those candidates in various examinations centers at Kalaburagi,
Bengaluru, Tumkur and Dharwad. Accordingly, 10 more FIRs were registered in various Police
Stations, as stated above, other than the FIR in Crime No.48/2022. Hence, the petitioner has filed
this petition for clubbing all the cases into one case or for merging all the FIRs in Crime
No.48/2022.
5. Learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner contended that the investigation taken up by
the Police against the petitioner is blatantly illegal, malafide and hence, deserves to be quashed and
further, contended that the FIRs registered by the Police against the petitioner is not in consonance
with the spirit of Sections 154 and 156 of Cr.P.C. The law on the point is no more res-integra and
fairly well settled by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of T.T.Antony vs. State of Kerala
reported in 2001 SCC (Cri) 1048. All the case are registered by the Police Officers who are the
Investigating Officers during the investigation of Crime No.48/2022. The allegation against the
petitioner in all the FIRs are regarding malpractice in the PSI examination held on 03.10.2021 and
therefore, the question of registering separate FIRs for the single offence does not arise. Therefore,
all the FIRs shall be merged into Crime No.48/2022 and should be tried as one offence. Filing
different charge sheets for the same offences is in violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/70405609/ 6
Rudragouda Patil vs State Of Karnataka And Ors on 7 December, 2023
under Articles 19 and 21 of the Constitution of India. Hence, he prayed for allowing the petition.
6. Per contra, Sri.B.N.Jagadeesha, learned Additional State Public Prosecutor for the
respondents-State contended that the petitioner has involved in various offences and committed the
offences in different Police Station limits and several accused persons are involved in the offence.
The cases were registered pertaining to the offences committed in the examination centers in
various places and all the offences are distinct offences and different offences. Though it was PSI
exanimation scam, there were three mode of malpractice done, first one is, by helping the
candidates through Bluetooth, second one is, tampering the OMR answer sheets in the examination
centre itself and third one is, tampering the OMR answer sheets in the strong room at Bengaluru.
Various cases were registered at Bengaluru against the Police Officials including the ADGP. The
amount was received by the petitioner-accused from different candidates and helped them in the
examination with the help of various accused persons. Therefore, all the cases cannot be merged
into one case. He further contended that if at all the accused committed similar three offences, in
one year, there can be joint trial permitted under Section 219 of Cr.P.C., and further contended that
almost in all cases the CID Police have filed preliminary charge sheets and in some of the cases,
further investigation is under progress. He contended that the first case i.e., Crime No.48/2022 is
pending before the Principal Sessions Judge, Kalaburagi wherein the provisions of Prevention of
Corruption Act has been invoked by the Police, whereas the other cases are triable by the learned
Magistrate. Therefore, question of merging the FIRs does not arise. There are various accused
persons of Dharwad, Bengaluru and Tumkur and therefore the cases cannot be clubbed and tried at
Kalaburagi, as it will cause inconvenience to those accused persons. Even the witnesses are from
those part of the State. Therefore, it is contended that the FIR cannot be merged into one case/one
FIR.
7. Learned Additional State Public Prosecutor further contended that the petitioner had approached
this Court by filing the petitions which came to be dismissed on 27.09.2022 in Criminal Petition
No.200948/2022 and connected matters. Thereafter, challenging the said order, the petitioner
approached the Hon'ble Supreme Court wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court has directed the
petitioner to approach this Court for reliefs, if it is permissible. Therefore, he prayed for dismissal of
the petition.
8. In support of their arguments both the learned Senior counsel appearing for the petitioner and
the learned Additional State Public Prosecutor relied upon the various judgments of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court.
9. Having heard the arguments of the learned counsel for the parties and on perusal of the records,
the points that would arise for consideration are :
i. Whether the petitioner has made out a case that all the cases registered by various
Police Stations in Kalaburagi, Bengaluru, Tumkur and Dharwad, are all one offence
falls under Crime No.48/2022 of Chowk Police Station?
ii. Whether the petitioner is entitled for the relief as prayed in the petition?
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/70405609/ 7
Rudragouda Patil vs State Of Karnataka And Ors on 7 December, 2023
10. The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner relied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Arnab Ranjan Goswami vs. Union of India and others reported in
(2020) 14 SCC 12 wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that for same cause of action, there
cannot be multiple FIRs and by retaining one FIR, all other FIRs shall be treated as statements and
directed to merge all the FIRs in one case. In the said case, there is one cause of action and multiple
FIRs were registered in various parts of the Country. Hence, the Hon'ble Supreme Court quashed all
the FIRs and ordered to maintain one FIR for investigation.
In the case of C.Muniapaan and others vs. State of Tamil Nadu reported in (2010)9 SCC 567, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the confessional statement of the accused is inadmissible except
for recovery under Section 27 of the Evidence Act.
In the case of Radhe Shyam vs. State of Haryana and others in W.P.(Criminal) No.75/2020 disposed
of on 12.05.2022, the Hon'ble Supreme Court directed to club all the FIRs and to proceed together
for one trial by invoking the power under Article 142 of the Constitution of India.
In the case of Abhishek Singh Chauhan vs. Union of India and others in W.P.(Criminal) No.40/2022
disposed of on 13.07.2022, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has taken similar view where the CBI filed
charge sheet under the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (in Financial
Establishments) Act, 1999, Madhya Pradesh Investor Protection Act, 2000 and Chhattisgarh
Protection of Depositors Interest Act, 2005, and directed to club the matters in each of the States.
In the case of N.V.Sharma vs. Union of India and others in Miscellaneous Application
No.1238/2022 arising out of W.P.(Criminal) No.239/2022 disposed of on 10.08.2022, in respect of
a telecasting of news in a TV channel, various FIRs were registered in different Police Stations in
different States where the Hon'ble Supreme Court directed to consider as one offence.
In the case of Navika Kumar vs. Union of India and others in W.P.(Criminal) No.286/2022,
disposed of on 23.09.2022, the Hon'ble Supreme Court directed the concerned authority to file one
charge sheet arising out of the same incident wherein different FIRs were registered in various
States.
In the case of Vivek Gupta vs. Central Bureau of investigation and another reported in (2003)8 SCC
628, the Hon'ble Supreme Court considered Sections 220 and 223 of Cr.P.C., regarding clubbing of
the cases and trying the offences together.
11. By keeping in mind all the principles laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the above said
cases relied upon by the learned Senior counsel appearing for the petitioner, now coming to the fact
of the case wherein various cases are registered by the Police, in all, 11 FIRs, the details of which are
mentioned below:

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/70405609/ 19
Rudragouda Patil vs State Of Karnataka And Ors on 7 December, 2023
persons, examination centres, amount received by the accused, are all different including the staffs
of the concerned examination centres in various colleges and schools. It is not the case where one
offence is committed and on the same cause of action, various FIRs were registered. The accused
persons have received amount from different persons at different places, conspired with them and
helped the persons for writing examinations by using Bluetooth supplied by him and the Bluetooths
were carried by the candidates into the Examination Hall and the staff of the examination hall took
out the photograph of the question papers, sent to the answering persons by WhatsApp and then,
the answering persons contacted the candidates given options of questions papers and after giving
signal from the candidates, they have given answers and accordingly, the candidates have answered
the OMR sheets by rubbing and got passed the examination and also got selected. Though the
examination of PSI was conducted on 03.10.2021 and the object of the accused for getting money is
one and the same and the offence of helping the candidates through Bluetooth, may be similar, but
it cannot be said that the accused persons committed single offence where the various FIRs are
registered by the Police. The accused persons committed different offences and received money
from various persons, took help from the answering persons by paying money, engaged the staff of
the concerned examination centres by paying money and keept the instrument/mobile in the
examination Centre in the previous day and with the help of the invigilators/college officials got the
copy of the question papers which was received by the answering persons and helped the
candidates. The style of committing offence is similar but the offences were committed by the
petitioner. The beneficiaries and examination centres were altogether different. Therefore, it cannot
be said that it is an one offence wherein the multiple FIRs are registered. The modus operandi or
style of offence may be similar, but it cannot be said to be one offence. On reading of the charge
sheet materials particularly, column No.17 in all the cases, it reflects that there were similar type of
offences committed by the accused in different colleges on the same day of the examination held on
03.10.2021.
24. In this regard, the learned Additional State Public Prosecutor relied upon the judgment of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Rameshchandra Nandlal Pairkh vs. State of Gujarat and
another reported in (2006)1 SCC 732 wherein at paragraphs-13, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has
held that different offences were committed by the accused therefore, it cannot be considered as one
FIR.
The Division Bench of Delhi High Court, has taken similar view in the case of State vs. Khimji Bhai
Jadeja reported in 2019 SCC Online Del 9060 wherein at paragraph-63, it is held that the case of
inducement, allurement, and cheating of large number of investors, public depositors in pursuance
of the criminal conspiracy, each deposit by an investor constitute a separate and individual
transaction and all the FIRs cannot be amalgamated.
In the case of State of Bihar and others vs. Anil Singh alias Anil Kumar Singh and others reported in
2021 SCC Online SC 1294, the Hon'ble Supreme Court set aside the judgment, quashing the FIRs, by
the High Court of Judicature at Patna, holding that for the same offence, multiple FIRs has been
registered.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/70405609/ 20
Rudragouda Patil vs State Of Karnataka And Ors on 7 December, 2023
In the case of State of Karnataka by CID vs. Greenbuds Agro Form Limited Company and others
reported in 2021 SCC Online Kar 12475 this Court has taken similar view that when several FIRs are
registered, single charge sheet cannot be filed and each FIR shall be investigated and separate
charge sheet shall be filed and the Special Court can try the offences by invoking the provisions of
Section 219 of Cr.P.C. The judgment of this Court has been upheld by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
the Special Leave to Appeal (Crl.) No.6052/2022 disposed of on 18.07.2022.
In recent judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has also taken similar view in the case of Amandeep
Singh Saran vs. State of Delhi and others in W.P.(Criminal) No.341/2022 dated 06.11.2023 holding
that the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Pawan Khera vs. State of Assam and
others in W.P.(Criminal) No.74/2023 is not applicable to that case. However, the Hon'ble Supreme
Court directed the parties to approach the concerned High Court of the respective States wherein
different FIRs were registered in different States of the Country.
25. By considering the judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and peculiar facts of the case, I am
of the view that the present case is altogether different from the cases relied upon by the learned
Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner. It is PSI examination scam wherein the petitioner
received crores of money from various candidates and helped them for writing examination in
various centres by engaging different persons. Though it is similar offences, but it cannot be said the
same offence arising out of same transaction to club or try the case as per Section 220 of Cr.P.C.
26. Therefore, all these FIRs cannot be clubbed or merged into one FIR in Crime No.48/2022 of
Chowk Police Station, Kalaburagi. The Police have already filed separate charge sheet in various
cases and further investigation is still under progress. Such being the case, I hold that the petitioner
has not made out a case for merging all 10 FIRs into one FIR as prayed in the petition. Apart from
that the FIR in Crime No.48/2022 is triable by the Special Court as provisions of the Prevention of
Corruption Act is invoked, whereas 07 other cases registered in Kalaburagi District especially,
University Police, Ashok Nagar Police, Station Bazaar Police, shall be tried by the one of the
Magistrate Courts at Kalaburagi who is having jurisdiction. However, three other cases which are
registered at Dharwad, Bengaluru and Tumkur, shall be tried by the concerned jurisdictional Court.
Those cases cannot be transferred to Kalaburagi as it may cause inconvenience to those accused as
well as witnesses in the said case.
27. For the foregoing reasons, I proceed to pass the following:
ORDER The Criminal Petition filed by the petitioner for merging all the FIRs and
charge sheets is hereby dismissed.
However, (i) FIR in Crime No.96/2022 registered by Ashok Nagar Police Station,
Kalaburagi, in C.C.No.18934/2022 (ii) Crime No.97/2022 of Ashok Nagar Police

three cases committed by the accused within a year.
The Special Court, Principal District and Sessions Judge, Kalaburagi, shall conduct
the trial in Special Case (Corruption) No.7/2022 arising out of Crime No.48/2022 of
Chowk Police Station, Kalaburagi, and dispose the case independently.
The remaining cases pending on the file of JMFC, Tumkur; JMFC, Dharwad and
