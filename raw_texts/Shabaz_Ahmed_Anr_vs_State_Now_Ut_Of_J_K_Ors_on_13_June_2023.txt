JUDGMENT
1. Through the medium of this judgment, it is proposed to dispose of these two petitions which have
been filed, invoking inherent jurisdiction, under Section 561-A of the Code of Criminal Procedure
(J&K).
2. The relief sought for by the petitioners in CRMC No.446/2014 is the quashing of FIR No.132 of
2014 dated 19.09.2014 registered at Police Station Thanamandi against the petitioner no.1 for the
commission of offences punishable U/Ss 363/109 RPC, with the 2 CRMC 446/2014 & CRMC
No.74/2017 accusation that he had kidnapped petitioner no.2, on the basis of a written complaint by
her father Mohd Hussain S/O Faqir Mohd R/O Lah Thanamandi.
3. The facts which goad the petitioners to file CRMC No. 446/2014, are that the petitioner No. 1
Shabaz Ahmed and Petitioner No.2 Sayma Kosser, being major, contracted marriage out of their
free will on 23.08.2014 but to the disliking of the relatives of the petitioner No.2, who having got

Shabaz Ahmed & Anr vs State (Now Ut) Of J&K & Ors on 13 June, 2023
infuriated and offended, lodged report which had been registered as FIR No.132/2014 in Police
Station Thanamandi for commission of offences punishable under Sections 363/109 RPC. It is
averred in the petition that since the petitioners have been living as husband and wife since the date
of contracting of the marriage and also for the reason that they are major and have contracted the
marriage out of their sweet will, therefore, in this backdrop of the matter, the police ought not to
have registered the impugned FIR against them and the same may be quashed.
4. The FIR No.132/2014, was initially lodged only for offences U/S 363/109 RPC, however, during
investigation, it was found that the girl was kidnapped by petitioner Shabaz Ahmad with the help of
some other persons and was also subjected to rape by him, as such a chargesheet was laid for the
commission of offences punishable U/Ss 366/376/380 RPC before the jurisdictional Magistrate who
committed 3 CRMC 446/2014 & CRMC No.74/2017 the case to the Sessoins Court vide order dated
19.07.2016, which was entertained as Sessions Trial case No.77/2016 on 10.09.2016.
5. Petitioners through CRMC No.74/2017 have prayed for the following reliefs:
i) Quashing FIR No.132/2014 dated 10.09.2016 alongwith all further investigation
proceedings arising therein.
ii) Quashing: order dated 22.07.2016 passed by Ld. Additional Special Mobile
Magistrate, Thanamandi whereby Challan final report No.66/2016 dated 19.07.2016
has been entertained and committed for trial to Ld. Session Judge, Rajouri and
simultaneously directed issuance of arrest warrants against petitioners u/s 512 CrPC;
iii) For Quashing Challan No.77/session instituted on 10.09.2016 for offences u/s 366, 376, 380, 109
RPC and for quashing order dated 10.09.2016 and all further orders made/proceedings recorded in
aforesaid challan bearing case titled State v. Shahbaz & Ors.
6. CRMC No.74/2017 was filed by the petitioners therein who had been arrayed as accused, pleading
that petitioner no.1 and respondent no.6 (Sayma Koser, who is petitioner no.2 in CRMC
No.446/2014) being major, contracted marriage according to muslim customs on 23.08.2014 much
to the chagrin of respondent no.5, who is the father 4 CRMC 446/2014 & CRMC No.74/2017 of
respondent no.6, who lodged false and frivolous report which came to registered as FIR
No.132/2014 at Police Station, Thanamandi for commission of offences punishable U/S 363/109
RPC. It is averred in the petition that this impugned FIR has been challenged by the petitioner no.1
in CRMC No. 446/2014 wherein this Court vide order dated 21.11.2014 had protected the petitioners
from being harassed at the hands of the relatives of the petitioner no.2 therein. But in the meantime,
the police forced the petitioner no.2 therein (which is now respondent no.6 in CRMC No.74/2017) to
make statement implicating all the petitioners named in this petition.
7. Learned counsel for the parties jointly submitted that the petitioners and the private respondents
have amicably settled their disputes and issues between them, and by way of CrlM No.269/2023,
they seek permission of this court to place the compromise deed on record which is supported by an
affidavit. The same is taken on record.

Shabaz Ahmed & Anr vs State (Now Ut) Of J&K & Ors on 13 June, 2023
8. Heard, considered the submissions and perused the record.
9. A perusal of the compromise deed, executed on 17.02.2022 between the parties, would show that
the parties have entered into a compromise. An affidavit in support of the compromise between the
parties is also annexed with the compromise deed. Also annexed with the compromise are the
photographs of the husband and wife along with their two children evincing that they are a complete
family living 5 CRMC 446/2014 & CRMC No.74/2017 happily in all respects. It is stated in the
compromise deed that respondent nos.5 and 6 i.e. complainant and her daughter agreed to
withdraw the complaint and the case made against the petitioners/accused as both the parties are
residing peacefully without any dispute and they pray that all the pending proceedings pursuant to
FIR No. 132/2014, subsequent Challan and consequential proceedings may be quashed.
10. So far as the facts alleged in petition pertaining to the compromise arrived at between the parties
in terms of compromise deed executed on 17.02.2022, are concerned, the same are not disputed.
However, according to the parties, most of the offences of which accused/petitioners have been
charged are non-compoundable. In the backdrop of this position, the question arises as to whether
this Court has power to quash the proceedings, particularly when some of the offences alleged to
have been committed are non-compoundable in nature. The Supreme Court in the case of Gian
Singh. v. State of Punjab & another, reported in (2012) 10 SCC 303, while considering this aspect,
has observed as under:
"57. The position that emerges from the above discussion can be summarised thus:
the power of the High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint
in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to
a criminal court for compounding the offences under Section 320 of the Code.
Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be
exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz; (i) to secure the
ends of justice or (ii) 6 CRMC 446/2014 & CRMC No.74/2017 to prevent abuse of the
process of any Court. In what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or
complaint or F.I.R may be exercised where the offender and victim have settled their
dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no category
can be prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the High Court must have
due regard to the nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of
mental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. cannot be fittingly
quashed even though the victim or victim's family and the offender have settled the
dispute. Such offences are not private in nature and have serious impact on society.
Similarly, any compromise between the victim and offender in relation to the
offences under special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or the offences
committed by public servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot provide for
any basis for quashing criminal proceedings involving such offences. But the criminal
cases having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different
footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arising from
commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or such like transactions or the
offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc. or the family disputes where
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88341155/ 3
Shabaz Ahmed & Anr vs State (Now Ut) Of J&K & Ors on 13 June, 2023
the wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the parties have resolved
their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may quash criminal
proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise between the offender and
victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal
case would put accused to great oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice
would be caused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full and complete
settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words, the High Court must
consider whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to continue
with the criminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal proceeding would
tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and compromise between
the victim and wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate
that criminal case is put to an end and if the answer to the above question(s) is in 7
CRMC 446/2014 & CRMC No.74/2017 affirmative, the High Court shall be well
within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding.."
11. Similarly, the Supreme Court in the case titled Narinder Singh & Ors. Vs. State of Punjab & anr,
reported in (2014) 6 SCC 466, has laid down guidelines for quashing of criminal proceedings. The
guidelines are reproduced as under:
"31. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we sum up and lay down the following
principles by which the High Court would be guided in giving adequate treatment to
the settlement between c/w the parties and exercising its power under Section 482 of
the Code while accepting the settlement and quashing the proceedings or refusing to
accept the settlement with direction to continue with the criminal proceedings:
(I) Power conferred under Section 482 of the Code is to be distinguished from the
power which lies in the Court to compound the offences under Section 320 of the
Code. No doubt, under Section 482 of the Code, the High Court has inherent power
to quash the criminal proceedings even in those cases which are not compoundable,
where the parties have settled the matter between themselves. However, this power is
to be exercised sparingly and with caution.
(II) When the parties have reached the settlement and on that basis petition for
quashing the criminal proceedings is filed, the guiding factor in such cases would be
to secure:
(i) ends of justice, or
(ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court.
While exercising the power the High Court is to form an opinion on either of the aforesaid two
objectives.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88341155/ 4
Shabaz Ahmed & Anr vs State (Now Ut) Of J&K & Ors on 13 June, 2023
8 CRMC 446/2014 & CRMC No.74/2017 (III) Such a power is not be exercised in those prosecutions
which involve heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or offences like murder, rape,
dacoity, etc. Such offences are not private in nature and have a serious impact on society. Similarly,
for offences alleged to have been committed under special statute like the Prevention of Corruption
Act or the offences committed by Public Servants while working in that capacity are not to be
quashed merely on the basis of compromise between the victim and the offender.
(IV) On the other, those criminal cases having
overwhelmingly and pre-dominantly civil character,
particularly those arising out of commercial transactions or arising out of matrimonial relationship
or family disputes should be quashed when the parties have resolved their entire disputes among
themselves.
(V) While exercising its powers, the High Court is to examine as to whether the possibility of
conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal cases would put the accused to great
oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the
criminal cases. (VI) Offences under Section 307 IPC would fall in the category of heinous and
serious offences and therefore is to be generally treated as crime against the society and not against
the individual alone. However, the High Court would not rest its decision merely because there is a
mention of Section 307 IPC in the FIR or the charge is framed under this provision. It would be
open to the High Court to examine as to whether incorporation of Section 307 IPC is there for the
sake of it or the prosecution has collected sufficient evidence, which if proved, would lead to proving
the charge under Section 307 IPC. For this purpose, it would be open to the High Court to go by the
nature of injury sustained, whether such injury is inflicted on the vital/delegate parts of 9 CRMC
446/2014 & CRMC No.74/2017 the body, nature of weapons used etc. Medical report in respect of
injuries suffered by the victim can generally be the guiding factor. On the basis of this prima facie
analysis, the High Court can examine as to whether there is a strong possibility of conviction or the
chances of conviction are remote and bleak. In the former case it can refuse to accept the settlement
and quash the criminal proceedings whereas in the later case it would be permissible for the High
Court to accept the plea compounding the offence based on complete settlement between the
parties. At this stage, the Court can also be swayed by the fact that the settlement between the
parties is going to result in harmony between them which may improve their future relationship.
(VII) While deciding whether to exercise its power under Section 482 of the Code or not, timings of
settlement play a crucial role. Those cases where the settlement is arrived at immediately after the
alleged commission of offence and the matter is still under investigation, the High Court may be
liberal in accepting the settlement to quash the criminal proceedings/investigation. It is because of
the reason that at this stage the investigation is still on and even the charge sheet has not been filed.
Likewise, those cases where the charge is framed but the evidence is yet to start or the evidence is
still at infancy stage, the High Court can show benevolence in exercising its powers favourably, but
after prima facie assessment of the circumstances/material mentioned above. On the other hand,
where the prosecution evidence is almost complete or after the conclusion of the evidence the matter
is at the stage of argument, normally the High Court should refrain from exercising its power under
Section 482 of the Code, as in such cases the trial court would be in a position to decide the case
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88341155/ 5
Shabaz Ahmed & Anr vs State (Now Ut) Of J&K & Ors on 13 June, 2023
finally on merits and to come a conclusion as to whether the offence under Section 307 IPC is
committed or not. Similarly, in those cases where the conviction is already recorded by the trial
court and the matter is at the appellate stage before the High Court, mere 10 CRMC 446/2014 &
CRMC No.74/2017 compromise between the parties would not be a ground to accept the same
resulting in acquittal of the offender who has already been convicted by the trial court. Here charge
is proved under Section 307 IPC and conviction is already recorded of a heinous crime and,
therefore, there is no question of sparing a convict found guilty of such a crime."
12. From a perusal of the aforesaid observations of the Supreme Court, it is clear that in the cases or
disputes which have predominantly civil flavour and where the wrong is basically private or
personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute, the High Court is well within
its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceedings, if it is known that because of the compromise
arrived at between the parties, there is remote possibility of securing conviction of the accused. In
fact, in such cases, the Supreme Court has clearly observed that it would amount to extreme
injustice if despite settlement having been arrived at by the parties, the criminal proceedings are
allowed to continue.
13. Adverting to the facts of the instant case, it is clear that the parties to the dispute have entered
into a compromise, whereby complainant/victim has decided not to pursue prosecution in the
impugned FIR against the petitioners. Therefore, once the rival parties have arrived at a settlement,
allowing the prosecutions to continue merely because the offences alleged against the accused are
non- compoundable in nature, would amount to great injustice to both the parties and, in fact, it will
amount to frittering away the fruits of 11 CRMC 446/2014 & CRMC No.74/2017 compromise that
has been arrived at between the parties. The continuance of criminal proceedings against the
petitioners, in these circumstances, will be nothing but an abuse of process of law in view of the fact
that the petitioner no.1 and respondent no.6 have been husband and wife since long having two
children leading their lives peacefully, as happily married couple.
14. In view of the aforesaid discussion, FIR No.132/2014 registered at Police Station, Thanamandi
and the chargesheet arising from it and consequential proceedings for offences punishable under
Sections 363/366/380/109 RPC are hereby quashed.
15. All the petitions, alongwith pending application(s) are, accordingly, disposed of.
16. Copy of this Judgment shall be placed on the connected file as well.
