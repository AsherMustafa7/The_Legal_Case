RECORDS PERTAINING TO THE PROCEEDINGS IN MVC
NO.202/2015 ON THE FILE OF THE SENIOR CIVIL JUDGE
AND ADDL. MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENTS CLAIMS
TRIBUNAL AT KUNDAPURA AND ETC.
THESE APPEALS COMING ON FOR ADMISSION THIS
DAY, THE COURT DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING:
JUDGMENT
The Insurance Company has preferred an appeal in MFA No.5902/2017 questioning the quantum
whereas, the claimant has preferred an appeal in MFA No.5333/2017 seeking enhancement of
compensation, being aggrieved by the judgment and award dated 21.03.2017 in M.V.C.No.202/2015
passed by the Senior Civil Judge and Member, Additional Motor Accident Claims Tribunal,
Kundapura ('the Tribunal' for short).
2. The facts leading to the top noted case are as under:-
The case of the claimant is that on 25.12.2014 at about 2.00 p.m. when he was
proceeding on his motor cycle bearing No.KA-20-EC-0252 from Chittur side towards
Kollur side, at that juncture, the driver of the offending Bus bearing
No.KA-20-C-2959 came in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the
claimant's motor cycle. In the said accident, claimant suffered grievous injuries. He
further contended that prior to the accident, he was hale and healthy and was earning
a sum of Rs.15,000/- p.m. by doing agricultural work. On account of accidental
injuries, he has suffered permanent disablement. Hence, filed claim petition claiming
compensation of Rs.20,00,000/-.
3. The insurance company on receipt of notice has filed written statement and stoutly denied the
entire averments made in the claim petition. Insurance Company has specifically contended in the
written statement that the driver of the offending bus was not at all negligent. On the contrary, it is
the specific case of insurance company that accident took place on account of negligence of the
claimant. The insurance company specifically contended that the driver of the offending bus was not
holding valid and effective driving license. It also disputed the age, avocation and income of the
claimant. Hence, it prays for dismissal of claim petition.
4. The Tribunal based on the rival contention has formulated the following issues:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/162681025/ 3
M/S National Insurance Company Ltd vs Mr Anthony @ P S Papachan on 9 March, 2020
1. Whether the petitioner proves that he had sustained injuries in a road traffic
accident alleged to have taken place on 25.12.2011 at about 2.00 p.m., near Gothe
Cross, Idoor Kunjadi Village, Kundapura Taluk, due to the rash and negligent driving
of the driver of the Bus bearing Reg. No.KA-20-C-2959?
2. Whether the respondent No.2 proves that the accident has taken place due to the
contributory negligence of the rider of the Motor cycle bearing
Reg.No.KA-20-EC-0252?
3. Whether the 2nd respondent proves that the driver of the said Bus bearing
Reg.No.KA-20-C-
2959 had no valid and effective driving license at the time of the accident?
4. Whether the petitioner is entitled for compensation? If so, what is the quantum? From whom?
5. What Order and Award?
5. The claimant in support of his contention examined himself as PW-1 and examined the
Orthopedic surgeon as PW-2. The claimant also examined the Neurosurgeon through Court
Commissioner as CW-1. The insurance company by way of rebuttal evidence only produced a copy of
insurance policy and did not choose to lead any oral evidence in support of its contention.
6. The Tribunal having examined the oral and documentary evidence assessed the income of the
claimant at Rs.8,000/- p.m. and by taking disability at 30% to the whole body, the Tribunal has
proceeded to award a sum of Rs.2,59,200/- towards loss of future earning. The Tribunal in all has
awarded a sum of Rs.6,21,460/-.
7. The learned counsel for the insurance company in MFA No.5902/2017 would vehemently argue
and contend before this Court that the finding of the Tribunal on issue No.1 suffers from infirmities
and the same is contrary to evidence on record. While marshalling her arguments, the learned
counsel appearing for the insurance company would vehemently argue and submit to this Court that
claimant in fact has come and dashed against the bus from hind side and this aspect is not at all
considered by the Tribunal. She would urge this Court to reverse the finding of Tribunal. She would
contend before this Court that claimant has lost control and dashed against the bus from the hind
side and in this background, she would submit to this Court that claimant was also equally negligent
in causing the accident.
8. Per contra, learned counsel appearing for the claimant would support the finding of the Tribunal.
He would vehemently argue and contend before this Court that he has placed cogent and clinching
evidence on record to demonstrate that driver of the offending bus was alone negligent and
contributed to the accident.

9. On re-appreciation of oral and documentary evidence, this Court would find that driver of the
offending bus was charge sheeted. The insurance company has not chosen to examine the driver of
the offending bus and in absence of rebuttal evidence, this Court cannot interfere with the finding of
the Tribunal on issue No.1. Accordingly, the contention of the insurance company that claimant has
also contributed to the accident and was equally negligent is not tenable and the said contention is
rejected.
10. The learned counsel appearing for insurance company would vehemently argue and contend
before this Court that the Tribunal was not at all justified in taking the disability of the claimant at
30%. She would vehemently argue and contend before this Court that the Neurosurgeon was
examined as CW-1 who has not at all stated in detail and no explanation is forth coming in his
evidence for having arrived at a conclusion that claimant has suffered 43.75% disability. She would
further vehemently contend before this Court that the Tribunal has not at all assigned any reasons to
come to the conclusion that claimant has suffered 30% disability to the whole body. Hence, she
prays to modify the judgment and award passed by the Tribunal. While marshalling, her arguments
she would submit to this Court that Ex.P.3 wound certificate and treatment certificate at Ex.P.10
does not indicate any injury to the upper limb.
11. Per contra, learned counsel appearing for the claimant would support the finding of the Tribunal.
The learned counsel for the claimant would vehemently argue and contend before this Court that in
fact the Tribunal erred in taking disability at 30% and submitted that medical evidence on record
would demonstrate that the claimant cannot use his left hand and in this context, he would urge this
Court to take permanent disability more than 30%.
12. Having heard the learned counsel for the claimant and respondents on disability and on
reappreciating the oral and documentary evidence, this Court is of the view that the assessment of
disability by the Tribunal is based on clinching medical evidence on record. The relevant portion of
Neurosurgeon who is examined as CW-1 is skulled out for brevity:-
"I have examined the petitioner on 05.03.2016. On examination he had gross weakness of left upper
limb along with significant weakness of left hand grip. He also had numbness on lateral aspect of left
upper limb. Because of this it will be difficult for him to use the left hand for daily activities as well
as manual work. Because of above infirmities I have issued disability of 43.75% applicable to his
whole body and is permanent in nature.
At this juncture, the witness has
produced disability certificate of petitioner
which is received by Court Commissioner. The same is marked as Exhibit C-1 and signature of
witness is marked Exhibit C-1 (a)."
13. If this medical evidence is taken note of, then it is absolutely clear that on account of injury to the
left upper limb, the claimant is virtually unable to use left hand even for daily activities. This is the
opinion of Neurosurgeon and nothing is elicited by the Insurance Company in the
cross-examination and as such, the medical evidence on record is credible and Tribunal has rightly
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/162681025/ 5
M/S National Insurance Company Ltd vs Mr Anthony @ P S Papachan on 9 March, 2020
accepted and proceeded to hold that the claimant has suffered 30% disability. This Court would not
find any justifiable reason to disturb the above said reasoning of the Tribunal in arriving at and
assessing the disability of the claimant to the tune of 30%.
14. The Tribunal in absence of clinching evidence indicating the actual income, however, erred in
assessing the income of the claimant notionally at Rs.8,000/-. This Court is of the view that the
same is on the lower side. This Court by relying on the chart issued by the Legal Services Authority
would take the income of the claimant at Rs.8,500/- and by taking 30% disability, the income of the
claimant is assessed at Rs.2,550/-. Hence, the compensation payable under the head "future loss of
earning" works out to Rs.2,75,400/- (2,550x12x9).
15. The Tribunal while awarding compensation towards laid up period has, however, proceeded to
assess the loss of income for a period of 10 months which does not appear to be just and proper.
This Court would modify the same and on examination of medical evidence, this Court would award
compensation towards laid up period for 5 months by taking notional income at Rs.8,500/-. If the
same is assessed for a period of five months, the same comes to Rs.42,500/- and accordingly, the
same is awarded under the head loss of income during laid up period. Towards attendance,
conveyance and other incidental expenses a sum of Rs.10,000/- is awarded. The compensation
determined under the other heads are in accordance with law and would not warrant any
interference. Hence, the reassessed compensation determined by this Court is as under:
Sl. Heads Amount
No.
1. Pain and Suffering Rs.75,000/-
2. Medical expenses Rs.1,52,260/-
3. Loss of income during laid up Rs.42,500/-
period
4. Loss of future earning Rs.2,75,400/-
5. Loss of amenities Rs.40,000/-
6. Future medical expenses Rs.15,000/-
7. Attendance, conveyance and other Rs.10,000/-
incidental expenses
Total Rs.6,10,160/-
16. On reassessment of oral and documentary evidence, the compensation determined by this Court
comes to Rs.6,10,160/- as against Rs.6,21,460/- awarded by the Tribunal.

17. Accordingly, the appeal filed by the Insurance Company in MFA.No.5902/2017 is allowed in
part. The judgment and award dated 21.03.2017 passed in M.V.C.No.202/2015 by the Senior Civil
Judge and Member, Additional Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Kundapura is modified. The appeal
filed by the appellant in MFA.No.5333/2017 is disposed of and the appellant is entitled to
compensation of Rs.6,10,160/- with interest at the rate of 6% p.a. from the date of petition till the
date of deposit.
The amount in deposit in MFA.No.5902/2017 may be transmitted to the Tribunal to enable the
claimant to withdraw the same.
