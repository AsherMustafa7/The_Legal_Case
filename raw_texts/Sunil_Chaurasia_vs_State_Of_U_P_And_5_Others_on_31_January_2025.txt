Sunil Chaurasia vs State Of U.P. And 5 Others on 31 January, 2025
Versus Ramesh Verma and others) arising out case crime no. 638 of 2022 under
section 147, 323, 325, 302 I.P.C. P.S. Capmeirganj District- Gorakhpur within Some
stipulated period fixed by this Hon'ble Court.
And/or pass such other and further order which this Hon'ble Court may deem fit and
proper, under the facts and circumstances of the case."
4. Record shows that in respect of an incident, which is alleged to have occurred on 25.12.2022, a
delayed FIR dated 26.12.2022 was lodged by first informant-applicant and was registered as Case
Crime No. 0638 of 2022, under Sections 147, 323, 302 IPC, Police Station-Campierganj,
District-Gorakhpur. In the aforesaid FIR, six persons namely (1) Ramesh Verma, (2) Umesh Verma,
(3) Dinesh Verma, (4) Sujeet Verma, (5) Ranjeet Verma and (6) Suraj Verma have been nominated
as named accused.
5. After aforementioned FIR was lodged, Investigating Officer proceeded with statutory
investigation of concerned case crime number in terms of Chaper-XII Cr.P.C. On the basis material
collected by him, during course of investigation, Investigating Officer came to the conclusion that
offence complained of is prima facie established. Consequently, he submitted the charge
sheet/police report dated 06.03.2023 in terms of Section 173(2) Cr.P.C. against five of the named
accused under Sections147, 323, 325, 302 IPC, whereas one of the named accused namely Dinesh
Verma was exculpated.
6. Upon submission of aforementioned police report/charge sheet, cognizance was taken upon same
by the Jurisdictional Magistrate. However, as offence complained of is triable exclusively by the
Court of Sessions, therefore, the Jurisdictional Magistrate, committed the case to the Court of
Sessions. Resultantly, Special Case No. 849 of 2023 (State Vs. Ramesh Verma and Others) came to
be registered. The concerned Sessions Judge proceeded with trial. He framed charges against charge
sheeted accused, vide framing of charge order dated 17.08.2023.
7. Subsequent to above order dated 17.08.2023, the trial procedure commenced. Prosecution in
discharge of it's burden to bring home the charges so framed against charge sheeted accused has
adduced only two witnesses up to this stage.
8. On the above premise, the learned counsel for applicant submits that the trial of charge sheeted
accused commenced in the year, 2023. However, in spite of the fact that a period of more than one
year has rolled by, the trial of the accused has not yet concluded. The trial is not proceeding at the
required pace but to the contrary, at a snail's pace. As per the charge sheet, there are as many as 30
prosecution witnesses nominated therein. In view of the lackadaisical approach of Court below in
conducting the trial, there is no possibility of the trial getting concluded in near future. At this
juncture, the learned counsel for applicant invited the attention of Court to the order sheet and on
basis thereof, he submits that the case has been adjourned repeatedly either on the ground of non
presence of witnesses before Court below or adjournment/stay was prayed on behalf of accused,
which has been readily granted by Court below. On the above premise, it is thus urged by the
learned counsel for applicant that interest of justice shall be served, in case, a positive direction is

issued by this Court to Court below to proceed with aforementioned trial expeditiously without
granting any unnecessary adjournment to either of the parties, exemption to the accused and further
conclude the trial within a time period fixed by this Court.
8. Per contra, the learned A.G.A. for State-opposite party-1 has opposed the present application.
Referring to the observations made by Apex Court in paragraphs 41 and 42 of the Five Judges Bench
judgment in High Court Bar Association, Allahabad Vs. State of U.P. and Others, 2024 SCC Online
SC 207, the learned A.G.A. submits that no direction for time bound disposal of criminal trial can
now be issued by this Court. However, the Apex Court in aforementioned judgment has itself carved
out an exception that in case, exceptional circumstance exits, the Constitutional Court can direct for
time bound disposal of a criminal case. Referring to the affidavit filed in support of this application,
the learned A.G.A. submits that since no exceptional circumstance has emerged on record,
therefore, no indulgence be granted by this Court in present application.
9. Having heard the learned counsel for applicant, the learned A.G.A. for State and upon perusal of
record, this Court finds that no useful purpose shall be served in keeping this application pending.
10. Accordingly, this application is disposed of finally with a direction to Court below to proceed
with aforementioned Sessions Trial expeditiously without granting any unnecessary adjournment to
either of the parties, stay/exemption to accused except in exceptional circumstance and to take such
measure as are available under the Code (i.e. Cr.P.C.) to secure the presence of the witnesses and
further ensure strict compliance of the mandate of law provided in Section 309 Cr.P.C./Section 346
BNSS.
