law.

before it.

along with a certified copy of this order within two weeks from today and be
permitted to file a proper compromise deed. It is expected that the trial court may fix
a date for the verification of the compromise and after ensuring the presence of
parties, pass an appropriate order with respect to the same in accordance with law,
