Smt Lakshmamma vs State Of Karnataka on 2 January, 2018
2. Petitioners submit that in respect of the land in question, which is Sy.No.337 measuring 1 acre of
Hinkal Village, Kasaba Hobli, Mysore Taluk and District, petitioners formed a residential layout
after obtaining permission from Hinkal Mandal Panchayath. Thereafter, house sites have been sold
to respondent Nos.5 to 15.
The petitioners have sought the aforesaid prayers having regard to the fact that respondent Nos.1 to
4 initiated acquisition proceedings in respect of several lands including the land in question by
issuance of Preliminary Notification dated 25.06.1981 under Section 16(1) of the City of Mysore
Improvement Act, 1903 (hereinafter, referred to as "1903 Act", for the sake brevity) and the same
was followed by a Final Notification dated 29.03.1984 under Section 18 (1) and (2) of the said Act.
3. According to the petitioners, general award was passed in respect of the lands sought to be
acquired including the land in question on 21.04.1986, a copy of which is produced as Annexure-G
to the writ petitions. The contention of the petitioners is that no separate award has been passed in
respect of the land in question. In the circumstances, petitioners have sought the aforesaid prayers.
4. I have heard learned counsel for the petitioners and learned AGA appearing for respondent Nos.1
and 4 and perused the material on record.
5. Learned counsel for the petitioners firstly submitted that Section 24(2) of the Right to Fair
Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013
(hereinafter, referred to as "2013 Act" for the sake brevity), is applicable even in respect of
acquisitions initiated under the Act. Secondly, he submitted that under Section 27 of the Karnataka
Urban Development Authorities Act, 1987, (hereinafter, referred to as "KUDA Act" for the sake
brevity), which has substituted 1903 Act, this Court may declare that the acquisition has lapsed as
the scheme for which the land was sought to be acquired has not been substantially implemented.
Thirdly, he submitted that when the award has not been passed in the name of the petitioners,
possession from them could not have been taken from the respondent -
Authorities. Therefore, the acquisition is deemed to have lapsed. In the circumstances, petitioners'
counsel sought for the aforesaid reliefs being granted to them.
6. Per contra, the learned AGA appearing for respondent Nos.1 and 4 on advance notice submitted
that Section 24 of 2013 Act does not apply to acquisition initiated under 1903 Act or even under
KUDA Act, which Act has repealed 1903 Act under which acquisition has taken place. He further
submitted that the petitioners cannot seek a declaration under Section 27 of the KUDA Act at this
belated point of time assuming that it applies. He also drew my attention to the general award at
Annexure-G dated 21.04.1986 and contended that the award has been passed in respect of the land
in question and that the petitioners at this belated stage cannot file these writ petitions and seek the
aforesaid reliefs. In the circumstances, learned AGA sought for dismissal of these writ petitions.
He also drew my attention to the fact that the petitioners in fact have no locus standi to file these
writ petitions as even according to them, they have sold the land in question in the form of sites to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123547061/ 5
Smt Lakshmamma vs State Of Karnataka on 2 January, 2018
respondents No.5 to 15. Therefore, he submitted that these writ petitions may be dismissed on that
basis also.
The contentions raised by learned counsel for the petitioners shall be considered in seriatim.
7. The first contention is with regard to the applicability of Section 24(2) of 2013 Act to an
acquisition initiated under 1903 Act which was in force
- 10 -
prior to the enforcement of KUDA Act and the same is repealed. The object and purpose of the said
Act was for the improvement of City of Mysore and to provide space for its future expansion.
Sections 3 and 4 of Chapter II of the said Act dealt with the constitution of the Board of Trustees for
the Improvement of City of Mysore, which was charged with execution of object and purposes of the
Act. Chapter III of the said Act dealt with Improvements Schemes, under which, for the purpose of
implementation of a scheme, the Trust had the power to acquire land and the same was delineated
under Sections 14 to 18 of the said Act, which read as under:
"Sec.14.(1)- The Board may, subject to the control of the Government,-
(a) draw up detailed schemes (hereinafter referred to as "improvement schemes") for

the local authority concerned.
(4) After the land vests in the Government under section 16 of the Land Acquisition Act, the Deputy
Commissioner shall, upon payment of the cost of the acquisition, and upon the Board agreeing to
pay any further costs which may be incurred on account of the acquisition, transfer the land to the
Board, and the land shall thereupon vest in the Board".
- 30 -
The Notifications in the instant case which are dated 25.06.1981 and 29.03.1984 have been issued
under the said Act.
8. The said Act has been repealed and substituted by KUDA Act, which has been enforced from
16.11.1987 to provide for the establishment of Urban Development Authorities for the planned
development of major and important urban areas in the State and the areas adjacent thereto and for
matters connected therewith. The object and purpose of KUDA Act and Bangalore Development
Authority Act, 1976 (hereinafter referred to as "BDA" Act) are in pari materia. The Hon'ble Supreme
Court in a catena of cases has held that the scheme and object of the BDA Act is distinct and
different from the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (hereinafter, referred to as the "LA Act, 1894", for the
sake brevity).

9. Although, recently this Court in the case of Smt K.M.Chikkathayamma and Others Vs. The State
of Karnataka, Urban Development Department and Others reported in ILR 2016 KAR 1603, has
held that the acquisition initiated under the KUDA Act would come under the scope of Section 24 of
2013 Act, by a more recent judgment of this Court in the case of M/s. Evershine Monuments (earlier
known as M/s. Granite exporters) and Others Vs. The State of Karnataka and Others in
W.P.Nos.17852- 17856/2014 and connected matters disposed of on 14.12.2017, by following the
judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, it has been held that Section 24 would not apply to any
acquisition initiated under the BDA Act. In other words, it has been held that if an acquisition
proceeding has been initiated under the provisions of LA Act, 1894, in such a case only, Section 24
of 2013 Act would be applicable.
- 32 -
10. Section 24 of the 2013 Act is extracted for immediate reference as under:
"24. Land acquisition process under Act No.1 of 1894 shall be deemed to have lapsed
in certain cases: (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, in any case of
land acquisition proceedings initiated under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894:
(a) where no award under section 11 of the said Land Acquisition Act has been made,
then, all provisions of this Act relating to the determination of compensation shall
apply; or
(b) where an award under said section 11 has been made, then such proceedings shall
continue under the provisions of the said Land Acquisition Act, as if the said Act has
not been repealed.
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), in case of land acquisition
proceedings initiated under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, where an award under
the said section 11 has been made five years or more prior to the commencement of
this Act but the physical possession of the land has not been
- 33 -
taken or the compensation has not been paid the said proceedings shall be deemed to have lapsed
and the appropriate Government, if it so chooses, shall initiate the proceedings of such land
acquisition afresh in accordance with the provisions of this Act:
Provided that where an award has been made and compensation in respect of a
majority of land holdings has not been deposited in the account of the beneficiaries,
then, all beneficiaries specified in the notification for acquisition under section 4 of
the said Land Acquisition Act, shall be entitled to compensation in accordance with
the provisions of this Act."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123547061/ 15
Smt Lakshmamma vs State Of Karnataka on 2 January, 2018
The title or preamble to Section 24 reads as "Land acquisition process under Act No.1
of 1894" shall be deemed to have lapsed in certain cases. It is explicit, restricted in its
scope and not expansive in nature. It is only where the acquisition process has been
initiated under LA Act, 1894 that the acquisition would lapse, on the existence of
conditions as stated in sub-section (2)
- 34 -
of Section 24. Same is the case with regard to Clauses
(a) and (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 24.
11. The said Section has been interpreted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Delhi
Development Authority vs. Sukhbir Singh and others [(2016) 16 SCC 258] (Sukbhir Singh). In said
case the acquisition was under the provisions of LA Act, 1894 and not under any other Central or
State enactment. Further, it has been held as under:
"11. Section 24(1) begins with a non- obstante clause and covers situations where
either no award has been made under the Land Acquisition Act, in which case the
more beneficial provisions of the 2013 Act relating to determination of compensation
shall apply, or where an award has been made under Section 11, land acquisition
proceedings shall continue under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act as if the
said Act had not been repealed.
12. To Section 24(1)(b) an important exception is carved out by Section 24(2). The
- 35 -
necessary ingredients of Section 24(2) are as follows:
(a) Section 24(2) begins with a non-
obstante clause keeping sub-section (1) out of harm's way;
(b) For it to apply, land acquisition proceedings should have been initiated under the Land
Acquisition Act;
(c) Also, an award under Section 11 should have been made 5 years or more prior to the
commencement of the 2013 Act;
(d) Physical possession of the land, if not taken, or compensation, if not paid, are fatal to the land
acquisition proceeding that had been initiated under the Land Acquisition Act;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123547061/ 16
Smt Lakshmamma vs State Of Karnataka on 2 January, 2018
(e) The fatality is pronounced by stating that the said proceedings shall be deemed to have lapsed,
and the appropriate Government, if it so chooses, shall, in this game of snakes and ladders, start all
over again."
(underlining by me)
12. Further, in the case of Government (NCT of Delhi) vs. Manav Dharam Trust and another [(2017)
- 36 -
6 SCC 751], (Manav Dharam Trust) referring to Sukhbir Singh, it has been observed as under:
"24. The 2013 Act has made a sea change in the approach on the acquisition of land
and compensation thereof. The only lapse under the 1894 Act was under Section 11-A
where what would lapse is the ... "entire proceedings for the acquisition of land"
whereas under Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act, what gets lapsed is the land acquisition
proceedings initiated under the 1894 Act which has culminated in passing of an
award under Section 11 but where either possession was not taken or compensation
was not paid within five years prior to 1-1-2014. In other words, the land acquisition
proceedings contemplated under Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act would take in both,
payment of compensation and taking of possession within the five year period prior
to 1- 1-2014. If either of them is not satisfied, the entire land acquisition proceedings
would lapse under the deeming provision. The impact of deemed lapse under Section
24(2) is that pervasive. To quote R.F. Nariman, J. in DDA v. Sukbhir Singh: (SCC
p.283, para 26)
- 37 -
"26. ... As is well settled, a deeming fiction is enacted so that a putative state of affairs
must be imagined, the mind not being allowed to boggle at the logical consequence of
such putative state of affairs. ... In fact, Section 24(2) uses the expression "deemed to
have lapsed"
because the Legislature was cognizant of the fact that, in cases where compensation has not been
paid, and physical possession handed over to the State, vesting has taken place, after which land
acquisition proceedings could be said to have been ended."
Thus, on account of the lapse, the encumbrance created in favour of the State comes to an end, and
resultantly, the impediment to encumber the land also comes to an end. Even, according to the
appellants, the transfers were illegal and void for the reason that there was an impediment for the
transfer. Once the acquisition proceedings lapse, all impediments cease to exist."

Smt Lakshmamma vs State Of Karnataka on 2 January, 2018
- 38 -
13. The aforesaid observations have been made by the Hon'ble Supreme Court while considering the
question whether subsequent purchasers/assignees/power of attorney holders etc. have locus standi
to file a petition seeking declaration of lapse of acquisition proceedings under sub-section (2) of
Section 24 of 2013 Act, which, even according to the Hon'ble Supreme Court was the only issue
arising in that case. But, nevertheless, the aforesaid observations have been made in the context of
land acquisition proceedings initiated under LA Act, 1894.
14. Further, in the case of Aligarh Development Authority vs. Meghsingh (AIR 2016 SC 2912), which
is also a case arising under the provisions of LA Act, 1894, at paragraph 6 and 7, it has been held as
under;
"6. Section 24 of the 2013 Act envisages mainly two situations; i) where the land
acquisition proceedings had already been
- 39 -
initiated under the 1894 Act but no award was passed till the date the new Act came
into force.
(ii) where the Award has been passed but neither the owner has been dispossessed
nor has he been paid the compensation. Under the first, where the award had not
been passed, the acquisition proceedings could continue; but the compensation will
have to be determined under the scheme of 2013 Act. Under the second category,
there is a statutory lapse of the proceedings. There is also an incidental third
situation, where award under the 1894 Act had already been passed prior to coming
into force of the 2013 Act, but payment is yet to be made and possession is yet to be
taken. In that case, the further proceedings after the award could continue under the
old Act of 1894; but if either payment or possession has not taken effect in five years
prior to the 2013 Act, then proceedings will lapse.
7. In the case before us, since admittedly the award has not been passed, there arises
no question of lapse. The land acquisition proceedings would continue but with the
rider that the award will have to be passed and
- 40 -
compensation determined under the provisions of 2013 Act."
Thus, by following the observations and interpretation made by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, it
becomes clear that Section 24 of the 2013 Act, [whether it is sub-section (1) or sub-section (2)]
applies only when acquisition proceedings have been initiated under the provisions of the LA Act,
1894. Therefore, on that short ground alone, it could be held that Section 24 of the 2013 Act is not
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123547061/ 18
Smt Lakshmamma vs State Of Karnataka on 2 January, 2018
applicable to an acquisition initiated under the BDA Act.
15. The relevant portion in the said judgment could be conveniently extracted as under:
"33. Next, it is necessary to discuss Smt. K.M. Chikkathayamma and others vs. The
State of Karnataka and others [ILR 2016 KAR 1603], which is a recent judgment
rendered by a learned Single Judge of this Court and which is the sheet-anchor of
learned counsel for the petitioners.
- 41 -
a) The points for determination in the aforesaid case are culled out for immediate
reference as under:
"a) Whether the petitions in WP 38868-70 and WP Nos.38871-74/2015 are
maintainable in view of the acquisition proceedings initiated under the KUDA Act
having been quashed and the same being the subject matter of an appeal before a
Division bench of this Court.
b) Whether the provisions of the LA Act, 1894 or the LA Act, 2013, should be applied
to acquisition proceedings under the provisions of the KUDA Act and the BDA Act, if
the proceedings are not completed as on the date of coming into force of the LA Act,
2013.
c) What order should follow in each of these petitions."
Learned Single judge has culled out the ingredients of the said sub-section which is extracted later.
b) It is necessary to delineate on this case in detail as heavy reliance has been placed on
- 42 -
the said decision by learned counsel for the petitioners. The primary contention canvassed in the
aforesaid case was, as to, whether 2013 Act would be applicable to acquisitions initiated under the
provisions of the Karnataka Urban Development Authorities Act, 1987 (KUDA Act) and BDA Act. If
the answer to the same was in the affirmative, then the acquisition proceeding in the aforesaid case
which concerned BDA Act also was deemed to have lapsed.
c) In that case, the contention of learned Senior Counsel and learned Counsel for the petitioners
was, where a statute is cited by a reference (the cited statute) (LA Act, 1894) into an another statute
(the referring statute) (BDA Act/KUDA Act) any repeal or amendment of the cited statute is
automatically carried over or reflected in the referring statute. This was in contrast, to a case of
legislation by incorporation wherein the repeal or amendment of the incorporated statute does not
automatically affect the incorporating statute. It was further contended in the said case that in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123547061/ 19
Smt Lakshmamma vs State Of Karnataka on 2 January, 2018
Offshore Holdings Private Limited, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held, Section 36 of the BDA Act (a
provision in pari materia with Section 36 of
- 43 -
KUDA Act) to be a case of legislation by incorporation. But, the repeal of LA Act, 1894 and
substitution of 2013 Act created an exception and when the exception applied, the effect would be
one of legislation by reference. It was contended that, if LA Act, 1894, was to be applied to
acquisitions made under the KUDA Act post 01.01.2014, the quantum of compensation to the land
owners in relation to acquisitions under the KUDA Act would be lesser than the compensation
vis-à-vis acquisition made under 2013 Act, even though the purpose of the acquisition is same
(urban or town planning and allotment of house sites). Similarly, the additional benefits in relation
to rehabilitation and resettlement of affected families would also not be available to the land owners
even though the purpose of the acquisition remains the same. It was emphasized in that case that
the provisions of 2013 Act are more beneficial to the land owners and affected families in land
acquisition proceedings. The discriminatory effect as regards compensation and other benefits
would occur because there is a complete change in the legislative approach in relation to land
acquisition, rehabilitation and resettlement
- 44 -
under 2013 Act which is more beneficial to the land owners. It was further contended in the said
case that the land owners would thus be entitled to different rates of compensation and other
resettlement and rehabilitation benefits, depending upon which Act the acquisition is made,
whether under the BDA Act or KUDA Act or the central land acquisition enactments resulting in a
discriminatory effect being in violation of Article 14 of the Constitution.
d) Per contra, the State through learned Advocate General submitted in the said case that the
intention of Section 24 in 2013 Act is different and distinct in that the said section has specific
reference to acquisition proceedings initiated under LA Act, 1894. That the object and purpose of
Section 24 is not only to save acquisition initiated under LA Act, 1894, but also to declare lapse of
acquisition under sub- section (2) of Section 24 and to also give the benefit of the 2013 Act under
certain circumstances. It was further contended that Section 27 of KUDA Act as well as BDA Act
provide for lapse of scheme of development and consequent inoperation of Section 36 of the Act.
That BDA Act being a complete code by itself,
- 45 -
lapse of acquisition has to be considered under that Act only. It was further contended that Section
24 is more in the nature of a transitory provision and an exception and operates as a link between
LA Act, 1894 and 2013 Act.
e) While considering point No.2 extracted above, learned Single Judge in the said case held with
regard to interpretation of sub-section (2) of Section 24 of the 2013 Act as under:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123547061/ 20
Smt Lakshmamma vs State Of Karnataka on 2 January, 2018
"Section 24(2) of the LA Act, 2013 provides for lapse of acquisition proceedings
commenced under the LA Act, 1894, on the satisfaction of certain conditions, which
are as follows:
a. The award of compensation should have been passed five years or more prior to
the commencement of the LA Act, 2013. In that, it should have been passed prior to
01.01.2009;
AND b. Physical possession of the land has not been taken;
OR c. Compensation has not been paid.
- 46 -
The Apex Court has interpreted the requirement of possession being taken under
Section 24(2) of the LA Act, 2013, to mean that actual physical possession has to be
taken and mere symbolic possession would not suffice."
(emphasis by me) Although learned Single Judge has noticed that sub-section (2) of Section 24 of
the 2013 Act applies to acquisition proceedings commenced under the LA Act, 1894, nevertheless
has also held that the "answer to the second point for consideration is that it is the LA Act, 2013 that
shall be applied to acquisition proceedings under the BDA Act and KUDA Act, that have remained
without being completed in all respects as on 1.1.2014, and proceedings that have been initiated
thereafter".
f) Thus, learned Single Judge after referring to Section 24 of 2013 Act, held that it was applicable
even to acquisitions made under the provisions of the BDA Act as well as KUDA Act. Learned Single
Judge however noted that sub-section (2) of Section 24 is a substantive provision of law which saves
acquisition as well as affords the prospect of land sought to be
- 47 -
acquired reverting to the land owner under certain conditions.
34. The said decision was rendered on 10.03.2016. It is stated at the Bar that the said decision has
been appealed against by the BDA and a Division Bench of this Court has stayed the order passed in
the said case.
x x x
37. In my humble opinion, the judgment in Chikkathayamma's case as well as similar judgments in
other cases, in the context of KUDA, 1987 and BDA Act have been rendered without making an
analysis of Section 24 of the 2013 Act, with regard to its applicability to acquisitions initiated under
those Acts as opposed to acquisitions initiated under LA Act, 1894. Further, judgments of Hon'ble
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123547061/ 21
Smt Lakshmamma vs State Of Karnataka on 2 January, 2018
Supreme Court in that regard have not been considered and followed and without bearing in mind
the distinction in the object and scheme of the LA Act, 1894 and the BDA Act, as well as the
decisions rendered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in that regard. Learned Single Judge by his order
has granted relief under sub-section (2) of Section 24 of 2013 Act. While a reference has been made
to the decisions of the Hon'ble
- 48 -
Supreme Court in the case of Bondu Ramaswamy, Munithimmaiah, and Offshore Holdings Pvt.
Ltd., the said reference is not in depth, as a detailed consideration of the aforesaid judgments, which
have been rendered on a detailed comparison of LA Act, 1894 with BDA Act, would have thrown
light on the object and scope of Section 24 of 2013 Act.
38. Reliance placed on the observations made by Hon'ble Supreme Court in the aforesaid decisions
referred to above in detail would clearly indicate that the object and scheme of the LA Act, 1894 and
the BDA Act, being distinct and meant for different purposes, it cannot be construed that acquisition
initiated under the provisions of the BDA Act, is an acquisition initiated under the provisions of the
LA Act, 1894. More significantly, the judgment in Chikkathayamma's case does not take into
consideration the dicta of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Sukhbir Singh and the
subsequent decision in the case of Manav Dharam Trust, which are directly on the issue of
applicability of sub-section (2) of Section 24 of the 2013 Act to only acquisitions initiated under LA
Act, 1894.
- 49 -
39. With respect, the judgment in the case of Chikkathayamma and other judgments which are
similar in nature cannot be considered to be binding precedent as they are contrary to the dicta of
the Hon'ble Supreme Court referred to above as well as the provision of Section 24 of the 2013 Act
and hence cannot be applied to the present cases which deal with acquisition under BDA Act. There
are also additional reasons for holding so.
40. Revisiting the words of Section 24 of the 2013 Act, what is significant to note is the fact that the
said Section expressly refers to land acquisition proceedings initiated under the LA Act, 1894. The
said Section does not incorporate the words "or proceedings initiated under any other enactment".
Therefore, the expression "land acquisition proceedings initiated under the LA Act, 1894"
are significant and must be given its natural and plain meaning and the said
expression cannot be given an expansive interpretation by adding words to the
provision, in the absence of the provision itself giving rise to any such implication. In
this regard, the rules of interpretation of a statute would become
- 50 -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123547061/ 22
Smt Lakshmamma vs State Of Karnataka on 2 January, 2018
relevant and reliance could be placed on guiding principles of interpretation of
statute. One such principle is that the Court is not entitled to read words into a
provision of an Act or Rule for, the meaning is to be found within the four corners of
the provision of an act or rule, as in the instant case. Therefore, while it is not
permissible to add words or to fill in a gap or lacuna, on the other hand, effort should
be made to give meaning to each and every word used by the legislature. Thus, the
golden rule of construction is that the words of a provision of a statute, or rule must
be first understood in the natural, ordinary or popular sense. Phrases and sentences
must be construed according to their grammatical meaning, unless that leads to some
absurdity or unless there is something in the context, or in the object of the statute to
suggest the contrary. In other words, the golden rule is that the words of a statute
prima facie be given an ordinary meaning. Natural and ordinary meaning of words
should not be departed from "unless it can be shown that the legal context in which
the words are used requires a different meaning". Such a meaning cannot be
departed from by the judges "in light of their own views as to policy" unless it is
shown to adopt a purposive
- 51 -
interpretation of the statute, which does not arise in the instant case.
41. In this context, Harbhajan Singh vs. Press Council of India reported in AIR 2002 SC 1351 could
be relied upon wherein, Cross on "Statutory Interpretation" (Third Edition, 1995) has been relied
upon as follows:-
"Thus, an 'ordinary meaning' or 'grammatical meaning' does not imply that the Judge
attributes a meaning to the words of a statute independently of their context or of the
purpose of the statute, but rather that he adopts a meaning which is appropriate in
relation to the immediately obvious and unresearched context and purpose in and for
which they are used."
42. The aforesaid principles being squarely applicable to Section 24 of the 2013 Act, the same must
be interpreted having regard to the intention of the Parliament. In this regard, one cannot lose sight
of the fact that 2013 Act repeals only LA Act, 1894, and not any other Central or State enactment
dealing with acquisition. Therefore, what are sought to be
- 52 -
saved under Section 24 of the 2013 Act, are those acquisitions initiated only under LA Act, 1894 and
not any acquisition initiated under any other Central or State enactment. Therefore, the words
"acquisition proceedings initiated under any other enactment" cannot be added or supplemented by
the Court after the expression "in any case of land acquisition proceedings initiated under the Land
Acquisition Act, 1894"
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123547061/ 23
Smt Lakshmamma vs State Of Karnataka on 2 January, 2018
under both sub-sections 1 and 2 of Section 24 of 2013 Act. Further, the short title of
Section 24 of 2013 Act reads as "Land acquisition process under Act No.1 of 1894
shall be deemed to have lapsed in certain cases." This is another indication that
Section 24 applies only to those acquisition "initiated" under the provisions of LA
Act, 1894.
43. Further, Section 24 creates a new right in favour of land owners in as much as they are entitled
to relief under certain circumstances as stipulated in Section 24 of the Act. One such relief is under
sub-section(2) of Section 24 of the Act, dealing with lapse of acquisition by a fiction. It is a deeming
provision, provided the stipulations therein are complied with or the conditions mentioned
- 53 -
therein exist. One overbearing condition is that the acquisition must have been initiated under the
provisions of LA Act, 1894. Thus, if acquisition is initiated under any other Central or State
enactment, Section 24 does not apply.
44. The reasons as to why Parliament has incorporated Section 24 in the 2013 Act are evident and
not far to see. The said section creates a new right in favour of land owners whose lands have been
acquired under the provisions of LA Act, 1894, which has been repealed and substituted by 2013
Act. The 2013 Act is not a substitution for other Central enactments pertaining to acquisition of land
or for that matter any other State enactment. Therefore, Section 24 uses the expression that the
acquisition must have been initiated under the provisions of LA Act, 1894. But while creating a new
right in favour of land owners under Section 24, Parliament at the same time has intended two
further aspects: first, saving acquisition under LA Act, 1894 and second, not encroaching upon other
Central or State enactments. As far as State enactments dealing with acquisitions are concerned,
Parliament intentionally has not touched upon any State
- 54 -
enactment. The reason being that several State enactments have been made drawing sustenance
from Entry 5, List II or State List of Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, whereas LA Act, 1894 as
well as 2013 Act could be traced to Entry 42 List III (Concurrent List of the Seventh Schedule.
Moreover, as has been explained above, the object and scope of the BDA Act made under Entry 5
List II (State List) are distinct from LA Act, 1894 substituted by 2013 Act.
45. Further, the State enactments have their own provisions concerning lapse of acquisition such as
Section 27 of BDA Act or KUDA Act and Section 24 of 2013 Act cannot trammel upon those
provisions of the State Acts such as BDA Act or KUDA Act. The State enactments may have referred
to certain provisions of LA Act, 1894, particularly with regard to determination of compensation and
such other matters. Reference to LA Act, 1894 in the State enactments for certain purposes does not
imply that the acquisition is initiated under LA Act, 1894. What is of prime importance for Section
24 of 2013 Act to apply is that acquisition proceedings must
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123547061/ 24
Smt Lakshmamma vs State Of Karnataka on 2 January, 2018
- 55 -
have been initiated under LA Act, 1894 and not any other law. Losing sight of this aspect would
create confusion in the applicability of Section 24 of 2013 Act. If the said provision is to apply to
acquisitions initiated under a State enactment, such as, BDA Act or KUDA Act, then Section 27 of
the said Acts which also deal with lapse of acquisition under certain circumstances will be rendered
nugatory, otiose or redundant on prevailing of circumstances mentioned in Section 24 of the 2013
Act. In this regard, it is also observed that when State Acts such as, BDA Act or KUDA Act, have
specific provisions in the form of Section 27 concerning lapse of acquisition, Section 24 of the
Parliamentary enactment i.e., 2013 Act, cannot be applied, when acquisitions are under State
enactments. This is because, the State or Central Laws concerning acquisition are enacted under
different entries and in different Lists of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution and therefore,
they operate in different fields. This is so, although, the State enactments may refer to the provisions
of LA Act, 1894 for certain purposes.
- 56 -
46. At this stage itself, it may be observed that the issue as to whether LA Act, 1894 has been
incorporated into BDA Act by the device of legislation by incorporation or legislation by reference is
wholly foreign and outside the scope of controversy while considering the applicability of Section 24
to acquisition initiated under any law (whether State or Central), de hors LA Act, 1894. The
arguments of learned counsel for the land owners - petitioners in Chikkathayamma's case on the
aforesaid aspect was unwarranted and wholly digressive from the issue to be considered in that case
namely, whether Section 24 of 2013 Act was applicable to acquisitions initiated under any law other
than LA Act, 1894, such as, BDA Act, KUDA Act. The dicta of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in this
regard after comparing the scheme of LA Act, 1894 and BDA Act, are binding and authoritative and
the same cannot be brushed aside or ignored by not applying the same in appropriate cases, such as
the present one.
47. Thus, 2013 Act has not only repealed the LA Act, 1894, but has substituted the said Act. The
2013 Act is a totally distinct enactment and a complete code by itself. Hence, for the
- 57 -
aforesaid reasons, initiation of acquisition under State enactments such as BDA Act is not the same
as initiation of acquisition under LA Act, 1894.
48. Further, it is noted that 2013 Act has, by virtue of Section 114 thereof, repealed LA Act, 1894.
Section 114 reads as under:
"114. Repeal and Saving: (1) The Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (1 of 1894) is hereby
repealed.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123547061/ 25
Smt Lakshmamma vs State Of Karnataka on 2 January, 2018
(2) Save as otherwise provided in this Act the repeal under sub-section (1) shall not
be held to prejudice or affect the general application of section 6 of the General
Clauses Act, 1897 (10 of 1897) with regard to the effect of repeals."
Therefore, what is saved under Section 114 of 2013 Act are only those acts and actions initiated
under the provisions of the LA Act, 1894, which ought to be saved having regard to the provisions of
Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897. Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897, reads as
under:
- 58 -
"6. Effect of repeal.- Where this Act, or any Central Act or Regulation made after the
commencement of this Act, repeals any enactment hitherto made or hereafter to be
made, then, unless a different intention appears, the repeal shall not.-
(a) revive anything not in force or existing at the time at which the repeal takes effect;
or
(b) affect the previous operation of any enactment so repealed or anything duly done
or suffered thereunder; or
(c) affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired accrued or incurred
under any enactment so repealed; or
(d) affect any penalty, forfeiture or punishment incurred in respect of any offence
committed against any enactment so repealed; or
(e) affect any investigation, legal proceeding or remedy in respect of any such right,
privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment as aforesaid;
- 59 -
and any such investigation, legal proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or enforced,
and any such penalty, forfeiture or punishment may be imposed as if the repealing Act or Regulation
had not been passed."
However, Section 6 of the General Clauses Act would apply only when a saving clause as per
sub-section 2 of Section 14 is not expressly provided under 2013 Act. Section 24 of the 2013 Act,
which is in the nature of a saving clause has created new rights in favour of land owners whose lands
had been acquired under LA Act, 1894. Sub-section (1), lays down the conditions when the land
acquisition proceedings initiated under the LA Act, 1894, would be amenable to the provisions of
2013 Act or, continued under the provisions of the LA Act, 1894, on certain conditions or
circumstances prevailing. Under sub-section (2) of Section 24, the Parliament has, by a deeming
provision, intended that if certain conditions are satisfied, the acquisition proceedings initiated
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123547061/ 26
Smt Lakshmamma vs State Of Karnataka on 2 January, 2018
under the LA Act, 1894, shall be deemed to have lapsed.
x x x
- 60 -
50. Therefore, for a declaration of lapse of acquisition, the pre-conditions or conditions precedent
mentioned under sub-section (2) of Section 24 of the 2013 Act must apply. Most importantly the
said conditions must prevail in an acquisition initiated under the provisions of the LA Act, 1894, and
not with regard to acquisition initiated under any other enactment be it Central or State enactment.
Therefore, before land owners could seek relief under sub- section (2) of Section 24 of 2013 Act,
which is a right created in their favour, the basic postulate that must be borne in mind is to
ascertain, in the first instance, as to under which law, acquisition has been initiated; whether under
the provisions of the LA Act, 1894 or any other law. If it is under any other law, then in my view
Section 24 would not be applicable to such acquisitions. The dicta of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
the case of Munithimmaiah, Bondu Ramaswamy, Offshore Holdings Private Limited clearly
enunciate that an acquisition initiated under the provisions of the BDA Act being distinct from an
acquisition initiated under the provisions of the LA Act, 1894, it cannot be held that acquisition
process initiated under the provisions of the LA Act, 1894, would also
- 61 -
encompass acquisition proceedings initiated under any other law such as, the BDA Act. As already
noted, the two enactments being distinct having a different object and scope and acquisition of lands
being only incidental to the main object and scope under the BDA Act, the acquisition proceedings
initiated under the two Acts cannot be considered on par, so as to hold that land acquisition
proceedings initiated under the provisions of the BDA Act is "land acquisition proceedings initiated
under the provisions of the LA Act, 1894."
51. As already observed, Section 24 of the 2013 Act creates a new right in the land owners. For the
exercise of said right, certain conditions have to exist, the most significant of them being, the
initiation of proceedings for acquisition under the provisions of the LA Act, 1894. Therefore, the said
words must be given a natural interpretation and not an expansive or wide interpretation, so as to
extend the right under Section 24 even in respect of land owners whose lands are subjected to
acquisition under any State enactment, such as the BDA Act or KUDA Act. In fact, the Parliament
itself has been conscious of the fact that 2013 Act repeals
- 62 -
and substitutes only LA Act, 1894, and not any other Central enactment or for that matter any other
State enactment dealing with acquisition of lands. This is evident from Section 105 of the 2013 Act,
which reads as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123547061/ 27
Smt Lakshmamma vs State Of Karnataka on 2 January, 2018
"105. Provisions of this Act not to apply in certain cases or to apply with certain
modifications: (1) Subject to sub-section (3), the provisions of this Act shall not apply
to the enactments relating to land acquisition specified in the Fourth Schedule.
(2) Subject to sub-section (2) of Section 106, the Central Government may, by
notification, omit or add to any of the enactments specified in the Fourth Schedule.
(3) The Central Government shall, by notification, within one year from the date of
commencement of this Act, direct that any of the provisions of this Act relating to the
determination of compensation in accordance with the First Schedule and
rehabilitation and resettlement specified in the Second and Third Schedules, being
- 63 -
beneficial to the affected families, shall apply to the cases of land acquisition under the enactments
specified in the Fourth Schedule or shall apply with such exceptions or modifications that do not
reduce the compensation or dilute the provisions of this Act relating to compensation or
rehabilitation and resettlement as may be specified in the notification, as the case may be.
(4) A copy of every notification proposed to be issued under sub-section (3), shall be laid in draft
before each House of Parliament, while it is in session, for a total period of thirty days which may be
comprised in one session or in two or more successive sessions, and if, before the expiry of the
session immediately following the session or the successive sessions aforesaid, both Houses agree in
disapproving the issue of the notification or both Houses agree in making any modification in the
notification, the notification shall not be issued or, as the case may be, shall be issued only in such
- 64 -
modified form as may be agreed upon by both the Houses of Parliament."
The enactments relating to land acquisition specified in the Fourth Schedule referred to in
sub-section (1) of Section 105 consists of the following thirteen Parliamentary enactments, namely:
"THE FOURTH SCHEDULE [See section 105] LIST OF ENACTMENTS
REGULATING LAND ACQUISITION AND REHABILITATION AND
RESETTLEMENT
1. The Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958 (24 of
1958).
2. The Atomic Energy Act, 1962 (33 of 1962).
3. The Damodar Valley Corporation Act, 1948 (14 of 1948).
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123547061/ 28
Smt Lakshmamma vs State Of Karnataka on 2 January, 2018
4. The Indian Tramways Act, 1886 (11 of 1886).
5. The Land Acquisition (Mines) Act, 1885 (18 of 1885).
6. The Metro Railways (Construction of Works) Act, 1978 (33 of 1978).
7. The National Highways Act, 1956 (48 of 1956).
- 65 -
8. The Petroleum and Minerals Pipelines (Acquisition of Right of User in Land) Act, 1962 (50 of
1962).
9. The Requisitioning and Acquisition of Immovable Property Act, 1952 (30 of 1952).
10. The Resettlement of Displaced Persons (Land Acquisition) Act, 1948 (60 of 1948).
11. The Coal Bearing Areas Acquisition and Development Act, 1957 (20 of 1957).
12. The Electricity Act, 2003 (36 of 2003).
13. The Railways Act, 1989 (24 of 1989)."
52. Therefore, Parliament itself has listed the Central enactments to which 2013 Act does not apply.
This is because Parliament was conscious of the fact that LA Act, 1894 was substituted by the 2013
Act, which is distinct and different from the other Central enactments enumerated in the Fourth
Schedule to the 2013 Act or State enactments.
53. In the circumstances, it is concluded and held that Section 24 does not take within its scope nor
does it apply to, acquisitions which have been initiated under the provisions of any
- 66 -
other enactment particularly, State enactment, such as, BDA Act. The said Section is restricted to
only those acquisitions which have been initiated under the provisions of the LA Act, 1894 only.
Subject to compliance of the conditions mentioned under sub-section (2) of Section 24, the land
owner would be entitled to the deeming provision regarding lapse of acquisition and not otherwise.
54. In the result, Point No.(i) is answered by holding that petitioners are not entitled to relief under
sub-section (2) of Section 24 of the 2013 Act, as the acquisitions in these cases were initiated under
the provisions of the BDA Act and not under the LA Act, 1894. It is further held, with respect, that
Chikkathayamma's and other similar decisions, having regard to the dicta of Hon'ble Supreme Court
in the case of Munithimmaiah, Bondu Ramaswamy, Offshore Holdings Private Limited, are not
applicable as binding precedent in the present case. Further, most of the decisions referred to above
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123547061/ 29
Smt Lakshmamma vs State Of Karnataka on 2 January, 2018
have granted relief on the basis of factual determination as per sub-section 2 of Section 24 and
without considering the question of law which arises in these cases. Further, in some
- 67 -
cases, the petitioners have themselves not pressed sub-section (2) of Section 24 of 2013 Act. Even
then, relief has been granted on a determination made on facts and by holding that there has been
abandonment of acquisition/lapse of acquisition.
55. Hence, these writ petitions are liable to be dismissed, as the petitioners are not entitled to relief
under sub-section (2) of Section 24 of the 2013 Act as the said section does not apply to acquisition
initiated under the provisions of BDA Act.
16. The reasoning given on the basis of the dicta of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the aforesaid decision,
which though, are in the context of BDA Act in comparison with LA Act, 1894, the same reasoning
would squarely apply to acquisition initiated under 1903 Act. The said Act has been repealed and
substituted by KUDA. The provisions of KUDA Act are almost in pari materia to the provisions of
the Act, but KUDA has a provision, which is in the nature of Section 27, which is not found in 1903
Act.
- 68 -
17. As already noted KUDA Act is the Act to provide for the establishment of Urban Development
Authorities for the planned development of major and important urban areas in the State and the
areas adjacent thereto and for matters connected therewith.
Chapter II of the KUDA Act deals with the Urban Development Authority. Section 3 of the KUDA
Act deals with the constitution and incorporation of the Authority and other Sections of the said
Chapter are related to the constitution and incorporation of the said Authority.
Section 14 of the KUDA Act deals with object of the Authority, which reads as under:-
"Sec.14- Objects of the Authority.- The objects of the authority shall be planning and
promoting and securing the development of the urban area and for these purposes
the authority shall have the power to acquire, hold, manage and dispose of moveable
and immovable property, whether within or outside the urban area under its
jurisdictions, to carry out building, engineering and other operations and
- 69 -
generally to do all things necessary or expedient for the purpose of such development
and for purposes incidental thereto".
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123547061/ 30
Smt Lakshmamma vs State Of Karnataka on 2 January, 2018
Chapter III of the KUDA Act pertains to Development Schemes. Sections 17 to 19 of Chapter III of
the KUDA Act are relevant, which read as under:
"Sec.17- Procedure on completion of scheme.- (1) When a development scheme has
been prepared, the authority shall draw up a notification stating the fact of a scheme
having been made and the limits of the area comprised therein, and naming a place
where particulars of the scheme, a map of the area comprised therein, a statement
specifying the land which is proposed to be acquired and of the land in regard to
which betterment tax may be levied may be seen at all reasonable hours.
(2) A copy of the said notification shall be sent to the Local Authority, which shall,
within thirty days from the date of receipt thereof, forward to the authority for
transmission to the Government as hereinafter provided, any representation which
the Local Authority may think fit to make with regard to the scheme.
- 70 -
(3) The authority shall also cause a copy of the said notification to be published in two consecutive
issues of a local newspaper having wide circulation in the area and affixed in some conspicuous part
of its own office, the Deputy Commissioner's Office, the Office of the Local Authority and in such
other places as the authority may consider necessary.
(4) If no representation is received from the local authority within the time specified in sub-section
(2), the concurrence of the Local Authority to the scheme shall be deemed to have been given.
(5) During the thirty days next following the day on which such notification is published in the local
newspapers the authority shall serve a notice on every person whose name appears in the
assessment list of the Local Authority or in the land revenue register as being primarily liable to pay
the property tax of land revenue assessment on any building or land which is proposed to be
acquired in executing the scheme or in regard to which the authority proposes to recover betterment
tax requiring such person to show cause within thirty days from the date of
- 71 -
the receipt of the notice why such acquisition of the building or land and the recovery of betterment
tax should not be made.
(6) The notice shall be signed by or by the order of the Commissioner and shall be served.-
(a) by personal delivery of, if such person is absent or cannot be found, on his agent, or if no agent
can be found, then by leaving the same on the land or the building; or
(b) by leaving the same at the usual or last known place of abode or business of such person; or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123547061/ 31
Smt Lakshmamma vs State Of Karnataka on 2 January, 2018
(c) by registered post addressed to the usual or last known place of abode or business of such
person.
Sec.18- Sanction of scheme.- (1) After publication of the scheme and service of notices as provided in
Section 17 and after consideration of representations, if any, received in respect thereof, the
authority shall submit the scheme, making such modifications, therein as it may think fit to the
Government for sanction, furnishing.-
- 72 -
(a) a description with full particulars of the scheme including the reasons for any modification
inserted therein;
(b) complete plans and estimates of the cost of executing the scheme;
(c) a statement specifying the land proposed to be acquired;
(d) any representation received under sub- section (2) of section 17;
(e) a schedule showing the rateable value as entered in the municipal assessment book on the date of
the publication of a notification relating to the land under Section 17 or the land assessment of all
land specified in the statement under clause (c); and
(f) such other particulars, if any, as may be prescribed.
(2) Where any development scheme provides for the construction of houses, the authority shall also
submit to the Government plans and estimates for the construction of the houses.
- 73 -
(3) After considering the proposal submitted to it the Government may, by order, give sanction to
the scheme.
Sec.19- Upon sanction, declaration to be published giving particulars of land to be acquired.- (1)
Upon sanction of the scheme, the Government shall publish in the Official Gazette a declaration
stating the fact of such sanction and that the land proposed to be acquired by the authority for the
purposes of the scheme is required for a public purpose.
(2) The declaration shall state the limits within which the land proposed to be acquired is situate,
the purpose for which it is needed, its approximate area and the place where a plan of the land may
be inspected.
(3) The said declaration shall be conclusive evidence that the land is needed for a public purpose
and the authority shall, upon the publication of the said declaration, proceed to execute the scheme.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123547061/ 32
Smt Lakshmamma vs State Of Karnataka on 2 January, 2018
(4) If at any time it appears to the authority that an improvement can be made in any part of the
scheme, the Authority may alter
- 74 -
the scheme for the said purpose and shall subject to the provisions of sub-sections (5) and (6)
forthwith proceed to execute the scheme as altered.
(5) If the estimated cost of executing the scheme as altered exceeds by a greater sum than five per
cent of the estimated cost of executing the scheme as sanctioned, the authority shall not, without the
previous sanction of the Government, proceed to execute the scheme, as altered.
(6) If the scheme as altered involves the acquisition otherwise than by agreement, of any land other
than the land specified in the schedule referred to in clause (e) of sub-section (1) of Section 18, the
provisions of Sections 17 and 18 and of subsection (1) of this section shall apply to the part of the
scheme so altered in the same manner as if such altered part were the scheme.
(7) The authority shall not denotify or reconvey any land included in the scheme without the specific
orders of the Government.
- 75 -
(8) The authority shall not allot any land to any individual, organisation or authority, the civic
amenity area earmarked in the scheme without the orders of the Government".
Section 25 of the KUDA Act deals with the power of Authority to take up works for further
development.
Section 27 of KUDA Act prescribes that the Authority has to execute the Scheme within five years,
which reads as under:
"Sec.27- Authority to execute the scheme within five years.- Where within a period of
five years from the date of publication in the Official Gazette of the declaration under
sub-section (1) of Section 19, the Authority fails to execute the scheme substantially,
the scheme shall lapse and the provisions of Section 36 shall become in-operative".
Chapter IV deals with the acquisition of land.
Section 35 of KUDA Act states that subject to the provisions of the Act and with the previous
approval of the Government, the Authority may enter into an agreement with the owner of any land
or any interest
- 76 -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123547061/ 33
Smt Lakshmamma vs State Of Karnataka on 2 January, 2018
therein, situated within the urban area for the purchase of the said land. Section 36 of KUDA Act
deals with applicability of the LA Act, 1894, to an acquisition under KUDA Act and the same reads
as under:
"Sec.36- Provisions applicable to the acquisition of land otherwise than by
agreement.- (1) The acquisition of land under this Act otherwise than by agreement
within or without the urban area shall be regulated by the provisions, so far as they
are applicable, of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894.
(2) For the purpose of sub-section (2) of Section 50 of the Land Acquisition Act,
1894, the authority shall be deemed to be the local authority concerned.
(3) After the land vests in the Government under Section 16 of the Land Acquisition
Act, 1894, the Deputy Commissioner shall, upon payment of the cost of the
acquisition, and upon the authority agreeing to pay any further cost which may be
incurred on account of the acquisition, transfer the land to the authority, and the land
shall thereupon vest in the authority".
- 77 -
Further the State Government has a power to transfer the land belonging to it or to the local
authority under Section 37 of KUDA Act.
Be that as it may, having regard to the aforesaid discussion, it is held that the dictum in
K.M.Chikkathayamma's case would not apply to any acquisition initiated under 1903 Act or under
KUDA Act.
18. The next contention of learned counsel for the petitioners is that Section 27 of KUDA Act deals
with lapse of scheme. The said Section which comes under KUDA Act may be applied in the instant
case. As already pointed out by the learned AGA, a provision, in the nature of Section 27 is not found
under 1903 Act.
Therefore, petitioners cannot raise a contention under Section 27 of KUDA Act, insofar as the
acquisition in question is concerned, as the acquisition was made
- 78 -
under 1903 Act, which was a legislation prior to the enforcement of KUDA Act. Assuming for the
sake of argument, the case of the petitioners could be considered under Section 27 of KUDA Act, it is
noted that the Preliminary and Final Notifications in the instant case are of the years 1981 and 1984
respectively. The common award was passed on 21.04.1986. The scheme for which the land was
acquired was for formation of Vijayanagar layout involving 24 acres. Learned AGA submits that the
said scheme has been implemented long ago. But the petitioners have raised the contention under
the KUDA Act which is a subsequent enactment by filing these writ petitions in the year 2014.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123547061/ 34
Smt Lakshmamma vs State Of Karnataka on 2 January, 2018
Therefore, contention of the petitioners under Section 27 of KUDA Act (assuming that it could be
raised by them) has been raised at a very belated stage. Hence, the writ petitions would have to be
dismissed on the ground of delay and laches, insofar as the contention regarding Section 27 of
KUDA
- 79 -
Act is concerned by placing reliance on judgments of Hon'ble Supreme Court.
19. In this context, a plethora of decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court on the issue regarding
delay and as to how a Court of equity exercising jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution
cannot extend its hands to such persons who approach the Court after several years can be relied
upon. In fact, the Apex Court has held in several decisions that stale claims ought not to be
entertained by High Courts exercising writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of
India. The recent decisions in that regard are as follows:-
a) In a recent decision of the Apex Court reported in 2011 AIR SCW 1332 [State of
Orissa & Anr. V. Mamata Mohanty] the consideration of an application where delay
and laches could be attributed against a person who approaches in a writ petition is
discussed by stating that though the Limitation Act, 1963
- 80 -
does not apply to writ jurisdiction, however, the Doctrine of Limitation being based on public policy,
the principles enshrined therein are applicable and writ petitions could be dismissed at the initial
stage on the ground of delay and laches.
b) In the case of Shankar Co-op. Housing Society Ltd. v. M.Prabhakar & Ors. [2011 AIR SCW 3033],
the Apex Court at Para 53 has given the relevant considerations, in determining whether delay or
laches in approaching the writ court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The same reads
as follows:
"53. The relevant considerations, in determining whether delay or laches should be
put against a person who approaches the writ court under Article 226 of the
Constitution is now well settled. They are: (1) there is no inviolable rule of law that
whenever there is a delay, the court must necessarily refuse to entertain the petition;
it is a rule of practice based on sound and proper exercise of discretion, and each case
must be dealt with on its owns facts. (2) The principle on which the court refuses
relief on the ground of laches or
- 81 -
delay is that the rights accrued to others by the delay in filing the petition should not
be disturbed, unless there is a reasonable explanation for the delay, because court
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123547061/ 35
Smt Lakshmamma vs State Of Karnataka on 2 January, 2018
should not harm innocent parties if their rights had emerged by the delay on the part
of the petitioners. (3) The satisfactory way of explaining delay in making an
application under Article 226 is for the petitioner to show that he had been seeking
relief elsewhere in a manner provided by law. If he runs after a remedy not provided
in the Statute or the statutory rules, it is not desirable for the High Court to condone
the delay. It is immaterial what the petitioner chooses to believe in regard to the
remedy. (4) No hard and fast rule, can be laid down in this regard. Every case shall
have to be decided on its own facts. (5) That representations would not be adequate
explanation to take care of the delay."
c) Similarly, the Apex Court in the case of Sawaran Latha and others v. State of Haryana and others
[2010(4) SCC 532] has held that when the notification under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act,
1894 was issued in the year 2001 and the award was passed in the year
- 82 -
2004, writ petitions filed for quashing of the notification in the year 2009 have to be dismissed on
the ground of delay as the litigants who dare to abuse the process of the Court in disregard of the law
of limitation, delay and laches should not be encouraged.
d) In Tamil Nadu Housing Board, Chennai v. M.Meiyappan & Others [2010 AIR SCW 7130], when
the acquisition proceedings were challenged ten years after notifications were issued, the Apex
Court held that the High Courts should not have entertained the writ petition particularly after
passing of the award and that the High Court should have dismissed the writ petition at the
threshold on the ground of delay and laches.
e) In Swaika Properties (P) Limited and another v. State of Rajasthan & others [2008 (4) SCC 695],
the Apex Court has followed its earlier decisions in the case of Municipal Corporation of Greater
Bombay v. The Industrial Development Investment Co. Pvt. Ltd. & others [(1996) 11 SCC 501] by
observing as follows:
- 83 -
"After the award under Section 11 of the Act was made by the Collector he is
empowered under Section 16 to take possession of the land, if the possession was not
already taken, exercising power under Section 17(4). Thereupon, the land shall vest
absolutely in the Government free from all encumbrances. It is well settled law that
taking possession of the land is by means of a memorandum (Panchnama) prepared
by the Land Acquisition Officer and signed by Panch witnesses called for the purpose.
Subsequently, the collector hands over the same to the beneficiary by means of
another memorandum or panchnama, as the case may be. But in this case Section 91
of the BMC Act statutorily comes into play which would indicate that the Land
Acquisition Officer while making award should intimate to the Commissioner,
Municipal Corporation of the amount of compensation determined and all other
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123547061/ 36
Smt Lakshmamma vs State Of Karnataka on 2 January, 2018
expenses. The Corporation shall pay over the same to the Land Acquisition Officer."
It was held that the writ petition had been filed after possession was taken over and the award had
become final and therefore, the writ petition
- 84 -
had to be dismissed on the ground of delay and laches.
f) The order of the High Court dismissing the writ petition was confirmed by the Apex Court in
Banda Development Authority, Banda v. Motilal Agarwal and others [(2011) 5 SCC 394], as the filing
of the writ petition was 9 years after the declaration was issued under Section 6(1) of the Act and the
delay of six years after passing of the award and the delayed filing of the writ petition was a reason
for refusing to entertain the prayer made in the writ petition. It was held that in a challenge made to
the acquisition of land for the purpose of public purpose Courts have consistently held that the delay
in filing the writ petition should be viewed seriously, if the petitioner fails to offer plausible
explanation for the delay.
g) Reference can also be made to another decision of the Apex Court reported in (1996) 6 SCC 445 in
the case of State of Rajasthan & Others v. D.R.Lakshmi & others, wherein it has cautioned the High
Court not to entertain writ petitions where there is inordinate delay,
- 85 -
while exercising jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
h) Similarly, in the case of The Municipal Council, Ahmednagar & anr. v. Shah Hyder Beig & others
[(2002) 2 SCC 48], it has been opined thus:-
"The real test for sound exercise of discretion by the High Court in this regard is not
the physical running of time as such but the test is whether by reason of delay, there
is such negligence on the part of the petitioner so as to infer that he has given up his
claim or where the petitioner has moved the Writ Court, the rights of the third parties
have come into being which should not be allowed to be disturbed unless there is
reasonable explanation for the delay."
i) In fact in S.S.Balu and others v. State of Karnataka [(2009) 2 SCC 479], it has been held that delay
defeats equity and that relief can be denied on the ground of delay alone even though relief is
granted to other similarly situated persons who approach the courts in time.
j) To a similar effect is the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Andhra Pradesh
- 86 -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123547061/ 37
Smt Lakshmamma vs State Of Karnataka on 2 January, 2018
Industrial Infrastructure Corporation Ltd. v. Chinthamaneni Narasimha Rao & others [(2012) 12
SCC 797].
k) In Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board v. T.T. Murali Babu [(2014)4 SCC
109], on the doctrine of delay and laches and approach of the Court in that regard, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court has ruled as under:
"16. Thus, the doctrine of delay and laches should not be lightly brushed aside. A writ
court is required to weigh the explanation offered and the acceptability of the same.
The court should bear in mind that it is exercising an extraordinary and equitable
jurisdiction. As a constitutional court it has a duty to protect the rights of the citizens
but simultaneously it is to keep itself alive to the primary principle that when an
aggrieved person, without adequate reason, approaches the court at his own leisure
or pleasure, the court would be under legal obligation to scrutinise whether the lis at
a belated stage should be entertained or not. Be it noted, delay comes in the way of
equity. In certain circumstances delay and laches may not be fatal but in most
circumstances inordinate
- 87 -
delay would only invite disaster for the litigant who knocks at the doors of the court.
Delay reflects inactivity and inaction on the part of a litigant - a litigant who has
forgotten the basic norms, namely, 'procrastination is the greatest thief of time' and
second, law does not permit one to sleep and rise like a phoenix. Delay does bring in
hazard and causes injury to the lis."
(l) Further, recently in the case of State of Jammu and Kashmir v. R.K. Zalpuri and others [(2015) 15
SCC 602], the Hon'ble Supreme Court has opined that the writ Court while deciding a writ petition
he has to remain alive to the nature of the claim and the unexplained delay on the part of the writ
petitioner. Stale claims are not to be adjudicated unless non-interference would cause grave
injustice.
6. The aforesaid decisions are squarely applicable having regard to the facts of the present cases.
16. The next contention of learned counsel for the petitioners is with regard to the common award
being passed. According to learned counsel, in the
- 88 -
instant case, the common or general award has not been followed by individual award and that in
the absence of any individual award being made in the names of the petitioners, the acquisition
insofar as the land in question has lapsed. The said contention also cannot be considered at this
point of time. The petitioners ought to have raised such a contention, if the same was available, at
the earliest point of time. It is reiterated that the acquisition Notifications are of the years 1981 and

1984 and the common or general award was passed on 21.04.1986, but the writ petitions have been
filed on 19.12.2014 nearly three decades later.
Learned counsel for the petitioners drew my attention to the order passed by the Division Bench of
this Court on 07.09.2012 in W.A.No.15462/2011 and connected matters filed by these petitioners.
The appellants in the said writ appeals challenged order dated 23.06.2009 passed in
W.P.No.23558/2005. The said writ appeals were dismissed on the ground of delay. The judgment
- 89 -
dated 07.09.2012 passed in W.A.No.15462/2011 and connected matters by the Division Bench of
this Court reads as under:
"After arguing the matter at length, the learned counsel for the appellants seeks
permission to withdraw these appeals on the ground that appellants are required to
challenge the proceedings initiated under the provisions of the Urban Land Ceiling
Act.
2. If the appellants can challenge the proceedings initiated under the Urban Land
Ceiling Act, they are entitled to challenge the same.
3. Accordingly, these appeals are dismissed as withdrawn".
20. The Division Bench of this Court has reserved liberty to the appellants therein (petitioners
herein) to assail the proceedings initiated under the Urban Land Ceiling Act, if they are entitled to
do so. On the strength of that liberty, the petitioners could not have initiated these writ petitions.
- 90 -
21. It is also relevant to observe that when the petitioners have alienated the land in question to
respondent Nos.5 to 15 in the form of house sites, they have no locus standi to seek any relief in
respect of the land in question as they have no right, title and interest in the same.
22. In the circumstances, it is held that Section 24 of 2013 Act does not apply to any acquisition
initiated under 1903 Act or KUDA. That Section 27 of KUDA does not apply to the instant
acquisition.
Secondly, the writ petitions have to be dismissed on the ground of delay and laches as well as on the
ground of locus standi.
In the result, these writ petitions are dismissed.
