his possession 32 Nos. of "ANREX-CP" Cough Syrup bottles containing 10 mg codeine phosphate
each in every 5 ml were seized and he was remanded to police custody and later on judicial custody
by a Special Judge, ND & PS, Thoubal. During interrogation in police custody, it was stated that the
petitioner was a member of an organized partnership of trafficking illicit item. He was connected
with other accused arrested in connection with FIR No. 41(06)2022 LIL-PS U/S 21(b)/18(c) ND &
PS Act. It was stated that he would likely to be released on bail in connection with Cril.Misc.(B) Case
No. 348 of 2022 and on release, he would continue in the illicit drug trafficking and he was detained
under Section 3 of the of the NIT-ND & PS Act in order to prevent him from further involvement.
The petitioner was detained while he was in police custody and he was issued the detention order
dated 20.10.2022 under Section 3 (1) of the PIT-ND & PS Act by the Special Secretary (Home),
Government of Manipur. On 24.10.2022, he was given the grounds of detention.
[2] The petitioner submitted 2 (two) similar representations both dated 10.01.2023 through the
Superintendent of Jail, Sajiwa, Imphal to the Chief Secretary, Government of Manipur and to the
Deputy Secretary (PIT- ND & PS), Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue, Government of
India for setting aside the detention and setting liberty. It is stated that he was wrongly detained
without any material and he did not have any past criminal activities especially with respect to the
illicit trafficking of drugs.
WP(Cril.) No. 9 of 2023 Page 2
[3] The main ground in the petition is that the detention order is
based on irrelevant ground and non-application of mind and that the respondent Nos. 1 & 2 have
failed to dispose of the representation till date and the petitioner prayed that the detention may be
set aside. The State Government filed a reply stating that the petitioner was detained in order to
prevent him from further involvement in illicit trafficking of drugs on his release from bail.
[4] The representation dated 10.01.2023 was considered and rejected on 13.01.2023 by the State
Government. It is stated that there is no delay on the part of the State Government. The Central
Government has not filed any reply and during the course of hearing, Mr. S. Kaminikumar, learned
CGC submits that he has no specific instruction from the Central Government in this matter.
[5] Mr. L. Shashibhushan, learned counsel for the petitioner, submits that the Central Government
has failed to dispose of the representation dated 10.01.2023 submitted by the petitioner without
assigning any reason. He prays that the detention order is liable to be side aside on this ground. He
relied upon the order passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Ranbir Singh vs. T. George
Joseph, District Magistrate, Meerut & Anr. reported in 1990 (Suppl.) SCC 54 where it was held that
failure of the authorities to consider the representation made by the petitioner makes his continued
detention is illegal and constitutionally impermissible.
[6] We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the materials available on record.

[7] It is seen that the representation dated 10.01.2023 submitted

by the petitioner through jail authority to the Central Government has not been considered and
disposed of till date. Even para-wise comment was also submitted to the Deputy Secretary (PIT-ND
& PS), Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue, Government of India on 18.01.2023 by the
State Government. This long inaction on the part of the Central Government in considering and
disposing of the representation of the petitioner renders the detention order impermissible and
illegal.
[8] Reference may be made to the judgment passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
Rajammal v. State of T.N. reported in (1999) 1 SCC 417: 1999 SCC (Cri) 93, at page 421 and
Sarabjeet Singh Mokha v. The District Magistrate, Jabalpur reported as MANU/SC/1011/2021
where it was held that unexplained and inordinate delay in disposing the representation vitiates the
detention order. Accordingly, the detention order dated 20.10.2022 passed by the Special Secretary
(Home), Government of Manipur, detaining the petitioner is set aside and the petitioner be released
from detention if not required in any other case.
Accordingly, writ petition is allowed and disposed of. No cost.
