BEFORE
HON'BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. SIDDHARTH MRIDUL

Siddharth Mridul, C.J.:
Mr. N. Ibotombi, learned senior counsel, appears on behalf of the petitioners. Mr. Kh. Samarjit,
learned DSGI, appears on behalf of respondent Nos. 1-4; and Mr. H. Debendra, learned Dy.

The present public interest litigation has been instituted on behalf of Narendra Kumar Sharma,
praying as follows :
"In the light of the above few facts and circumstances, it is therefore, prayed that
Your Lordship be pleased to call upon the respondents to show cause as to why a writ
of mandamus or any appropriate writ or order(s) or direction(s) should be passed:-
i) Issue rule and call for records.

iv) To pass any appropriate order(s) or direction(s) which the Hon'ble Court may
deem fit, proper and just in the nature of the present case.
-call for records make the rule absolute for the ends of justice." It is observed that the present writ
petition has been filed without approaching the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to consider
grant of the reliefs prayed for in this proceeding.
In this behalf, our attention is invited to the affidavit-in-reply filed on behalf of the Income Tax
Department by the Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax, Circle-Imphal, and paragraph 16 of which,
reads as follows :
"16. That without prejudice to above, it is humbly submitted that such taxpayers who
have not been able to file their ITRs for AY 2023-24 which was due on 31.07.2023
within the period which the Broadband was available from 25.07.2023 to 31.07.2023
and have filed after 31.07.2023 may exercise the option of approaching the CBDT u/s
119(2)(b) of the Income-Tax Act, 1961, which could be considered on case-to-case
basis."
In view of the foregoing, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners, seeks leave to
withdraw this PIL, with liberty to approach the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), in the first
instance in relation to the reliefs prayed for in this proceeding.
Leave and liberty granted.
No further prayers are made.
With the above direction, the PIL is disposed of accordingly.
