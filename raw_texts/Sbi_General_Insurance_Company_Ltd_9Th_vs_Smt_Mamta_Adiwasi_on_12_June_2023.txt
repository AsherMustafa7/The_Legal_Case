MOTION HEARING
[COMMON CONDITIONAL ORDERS]
IN MATTERS NOTIFIED AT SERIAL NO. 1001 TO 1057,
1059 to 1071, 1073 TO 1102 AND 1104 TO 1113 ON THE
BOARD DATED 12.06.2023 DUE TO NON-COMPLIANCE
OF COURT ORDER.
The Court proposes to pass a common conditional order to
obviate passing of identical conditional order in these matters
involving similar office objection/default.
In all these matters, due to non-removal of office objection
within the prescribed time as per the Rules, the concerned matter
was placed before the Registrar in the first instance. The
Registrar granted sufficient time to the petitioner(s)/ applicant(s)/
appellant(s) to cure the defect/office objection, however, due to
non-removal of office objection/default within the prescribed
time, the concerned matter was required to be once again listed
before the Court. The Court granted further time, by passing
common order on the earlier occasion.
In spite of repeated opportunity (three times-one under Rules,
second by the Registrar and third by Court), the
petitioner(s)/applicant(s)/appellant(s) has failed to cure the office
objection/default. As a result, by way of indulgence and last
opportunity, in terms of this order, SIX WEEKS' further time is
granted to the petitioner(s)/ applicant(s)/appellant(s) in the
respective matters to remove office objection/default and make
the matter ready for further hearing within that time, failing
which the concerned petition/application/appeal shall stand
dismissed for non-prosecution without further reference to the
Court.
Provided, however, in cases, where the objection/ default is
about non-service of any of the respondent, on expiry of the
extended period, the concerned matter will stand dismissed for non-prosecution only against the
unserved respondent(s), without further reference to the Court. The matter would then proceed
against the remaining respondent(s).
In cases where the office objection/default has already been cured before passing of this order, it
will be open to the concerned party to bring that fact to the notice of the Registrar (Judicial-II) who

may examine the same and proceed with the matter as per the listing scheme, if ready for hearing.
If the office objections are removed within the time extended in terms of this order, the concerned
matter(s) be made returnable on the date notified hereafter.
