2. This Tax Case Appeal has been filed by the Revenue, calling in question the correctness of the
order passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, “A” Bench, by raising the following substantial
question of law:
"Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was right in
holding that the deduction u/s 8OHHC is to be allowed without deducting the
deduction granted u/s 80IA?”
3. When the matter is taken up for hearing, learned Counsel for the appellant brought to our notice
the Circular issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes vide Circular No.17/2019 dated 8 August
2019, wherein, it is stipulated that appeal shall not be filed/ pursued by the Department before the
High Court in cases where the tax effect does not exceed Rs.1,00,00,000/- (Rupees One Crore).
4. In the instant case, the tax effect is said to be less than the monetary limit imposed and therefore,
the Appeal filed by the Revenue is dismissed as withdrawn, keeping open the substantial question of
law for determination in appropriate cases. No costs.
