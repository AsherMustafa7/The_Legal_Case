Government, has sought setting aside of the letter dated
18.02.2019 written by the Registrar General of the High
Court of Judicature at Patna to the Chief Secretary,
Government of Bihar, on the ground of same being
misconceived and factually incorrect.

K. K. Pathak @ Keshav Kumar Pathak vs The High Court Of Judicature At Patna on 8 July, 2019
4. A criminal writ vide Cr.W.J.C. No. 431 of 2016
was filed for quashing of Bikram P.S. Case No. 52 of 2016
dated 18.03.2016 which was registered for offences under
Sections 409, 419 and 420 of the Indian Penal Code.
There was an additional prayer in the aforesaid writ
petition for a direction to the State Government to take
appropriate departmental action against the concerned
person who had directed for the lodging of the FIR. The
aforesaid criminal writ petition was heard along with six
other criminal writ petitions, all of which were disposed of
by a common order dated 28.08.2018.
5. The FIRs which were sought to be quashed
contained allegation that Branch Managers of State Bank
of India of different branches were directed to make
available data/statements showing transfer of money from
the account of the concerned registry office to Government
treasury but the same had not been furnished and as a
result thereof, difficulties were posed in calculation of the
interest. All concerned branches of State Bank of India
were required to transfer the collected amount within a
Patna High Court CWJC No.8836 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019
3/25
period of five days from the date of collection from the
account of concerned registry to the Government treasury.

K. K. Pathak @ Keshav Kumar Pathak vs The High Court Of Judicature At Patna on 8 July, 2019
Because of the non-compliance of the aforesaid
requirement, there had been a loss of interest of a huge
amount. The Branch Managers of the respective Branches
were directed to transfer the aforesaid amount in the
Government account latest by 29.09.2016 and in the
event of non-compliance, FIR was directed to be lodged. In
some of the FIRs which were challenged before this Court,
even the amount of money was not disclosed.
6. It would not be necessary to enter into the
thickets of facts of each case. All that is required to be
noted is that the learned Single Judge while hearing the
aforesaid criminal writ petitions, found that none of the
offences of cheating, criminal breach of trust or
misappropriation, attracting penal provisions, were made
out from the facts of the case.
7. Taking reference of several case laws viz.
Binod Kumar & Ors. vs. State of Bihar & Anr.
reported in (2014) 10 SCC 663; S.W. Palanitkar &
Patna High Court CWJC No.8836 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019

Ors. vs. State of Bihar & Anr. reported in (2002) 1
SCC 241 and Parbatbhai Aahi @ Parbatbhai
Bhimsinhbhai Karmur and Ors. vs. State of Gujarat
& Anr. reported in 2017(9) SCC 641, the Hon'ble Single
Judge took the view that the Principal Secretary,
Government of Bihar had directed the Sub-Registrar to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146872835/ 3
K. K. Pathak @ Keshav Kumar Pathak vs The High Court Of Judicature At Patna on 8 July, 2019
lodge the FIR without application of mind, especially
towards RBI guidelines and instead of following the
procedure for recovery of penal interest, a
peculiar/coercive method was adopted to ensure
compliance of the RBI guidelines. The Hon'ble Judge was
not at all satisfied with the submission on behalf of the
State that such FIRs were lodged in an effort to collect the
interest amount of several crores of rupees.
8. It was further noted that lodging of FIR has
serious consequences and such FIRs ought not to have
been lodged. The subject FIRs therefore were quashed. It
was also directed that the State Government would be
liable to pay a cost of Rs. 25000/- each to the petitioners
as cost of litigation.

9. The Hon'ble Judge further went on to hold as
follows:
34. Time has also come when the
State Government should consider and take
a view on the action of the then Principal
Secretary, Department of Registration,
Excise and Prohibition, Govt. of Bihar and
find out as to why appropriate action be
taken against him for directing such
whimsical prosecution of the Bank Officials,
in haste without following the R.B.I.
guidelines which were well within his
knowledge. The cost which the State
Government is now liable to pay to each of
the petitioner(s) in this batch of writ
application(s) may be recovered from the
then Principal Secretary, Department of
Registration, Excise and Prohibition, Govt. of

K. K. Pathak @ Keshav Kumar Pathak vs The High Court Of Judicature At Patna on 8 July, 2019
Bihar.
35. Since this Court has come to a
conclusion that it is a case of baseless
prosecution, a whimsical act of the then
Principal Secretary of the department and
harassment to these petitioner(s), they will
have liberty to seek their remedies for
Patna High Court CWJC No.8836 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019
6/25
malicious prosecution in accordance with
law.
10. The petitioner preferred a modification
application against the order dated 28.08.2018 vide M.J.C.
Case No. 3928 of 2018 for recalling/modifying/expunging
paragraphs 34 and 35 in the order. The Bench vide order
dated 31.10.2018 sought a response from the State and
the Opposite Party No. 1 and fixed the case for
05.12.2018
. In the meantime, the Bench directed that till the next date, the observations and directions of the
Court shall be kept in abeyance. The aforesaid M.J.C. Case No. 3928 of 2018 was finally disposed of
on 01.02.2019 and the prayer made in the petition for recall of paragraphs 34 and 35 in the order
dated 28.08.2018 was rejected. While rejecting the aforesaid modification, the Court took note of
the fact that against the order dated 28.08.2018, all the SLAs (Cri.) Nos. 10025-10031/2018
preferred by the State of Bihar before the Supreme Court were dismissed on 30.11.2018.
Patna High Court CWJC No.8836 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019
11. It is also relevant here to note that the petitioner preferred a Special Leave to Appeal (Cri.) No.
3566 of 2019 against the order dated 01.02.2019 in M.J.C. Case No. 3928/2018 passed by the
learned Single Judge which too stood dismissed on 26.04.2019.
12. It appears from the records as also from the submissions made on behalf of the petitioner that
the petitioner sent a personal and confidential letter addressed to Hon'ble the Acting Chief Justice
Dr. Ravi Ranjan, as he then was, by speed post on 09.11.2018. Since the Hon'ble the Acting Chief
Justice had been transferred from Patna High Court, the unserved letter was returned to the
petitioner. The aforesaid letter was again sent by the petitioner to the Hon'ble the Chief Justice of
Patna High Court on 29.11.2018.

K. K. Pathak @ Keshav Kumar Pathak vs The High Court Of Judicature At Patna on 8 July, 2019
13. In the personal and confidential letter sent to the Hon'ble the Chief Justice on 29.11.2018, the
petitioner drew the attention of Hon'ble the Chief Justice of paragraphs 33 and 34 of the
judgment/order dated 28.08.2018 and has stated that he expects many more Patna High Court
CWJC No.8836 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019 strictures (personal penalties and perhaps contempt cases)
by the Hon'ble Judge in days to come. In the last part of the letter, it has been stated that the learned
Judge in his hurry to pass strictures against him, did not even hear him or the RBI whose sample
audit was the primary cause of action in the entire matter. It was further averred by him that the
strictures, apart from generating cheap media headlines, has also the potency of scaring other
officers of the Government and discouraging them from taking any legal action against law violators.
The petitioner thereafter went on to state that the learned Judge had been holding bias against him
since his lawyer days and therefore the petitioner expects more strictures and penalties in future.
The letter however ended with an unconditional and sincere apology for anything stated in it as he
has utmost regard for judiciary. The letter though sent on 29.11.2018 appears to have been signed on
08.11.2018.
14. It has been submitted on behalf of the petitioner that thereafter the Registrar General of the
High Court sent a letter to the Chief Secretary of Government Patna High Court CWJC No.8836 of
2019 dt.08-07-2019 of Bihar on 18.02.2019 intimating to him the observations made by Hon'ble the
Chief Justice on the aforesaid personal and confidential letter of the petitioner and asking the Chief
Secretary to take appropriate action in that regard. The observations of Hon'ble the Chief Justice
which has been quoted in the letter dated 18.02.2019, referred to above, is being reproduced below:
"A letter dated 29.11.2018 appears to have been received on 04.12.2018 in the High
Court from one Mr. K.K. Pathak, an IAS Officer who is the Principal Secretary,
Department of Minor Water Resources & Industries, Govt. of Bihar regarding his
personal opinion about the judgment delivered on the judicial side on 28th August,
2018 by a Hon'ble Single Judge of this Court.
The Officer did not tender any information that the Special Leave to Appeal (Cri.)
Nos. 10025-10031/2018 filed by the State of Bihar against the said judgment was
dismissed on 30th November, 2018 (a copy of the order is enclosed herewith) prima
facie, it appears that even though the letter Patna High Court CWJC No.8836 of 2019
dt.08-07-2019 of the Officer is dated 29.11.2018, yet from the envelope the letter
appears to have been dispatched on 30th November, 2018 and received in the High
Court on 04.12.2018. The letter has been dispatched on the same day when the SLPs
were dismissed in the Apex Court.
It appears that after the dismissal of the SLPs an application seeking modification
was filed in CRWJC No. 431 of 2016 that was registered as MJC No. 3928 of 2018.
The said application has been heard and decided on 1st of February, 2019 (a copy
whereof is enclosed herewith). The same also takes notice of the dismissal of the
SLPs. The application has been dismissed declining to expunge and directions with
regard to realization of cost from the concerned Officer or deleting with the
observations made in the judgment of this Court dated 28.08.2018.

K. K. Pathak @ Keshav Kumar Pathak vs The High Court Of Judicature At Patna on 8 July, 2019
The language and tenor of the letter addressed to me prima facie contains scathing
remarks touching contemptuous and expressing disgust like a disgruntled litigant
showing almost complete disrespect Patna High Court CWJC No.8836 of 2019
dt.08-07-2019 to the majesty of Law and to the august office of a Judge of the High
Court which tends to lower the dignity of the Court and malign the image of the
judiciary.
Before the matter is proceeded with any further, these facts be brought to the notice
of Chief Secretary, Govt. of Bihar for dealing with the matter at his end after calling
upon the officer and informing me as to whether any further judicial proceedings are
pending or not and as to whether the Govt. of Bihar has proceeded to comply with the
judgment dated 28.08.2018 as affirmed by the Supreme Court or not.
The information be called for within fifteen days to enable me to take appropriate
steps in the matter. The letter to be dispatched to the Chief Secretary, Govt. of Bihar
should contain Photostat Copies of the entire material as referred to above."
15. The challenge to the aforesaid letter therefore is on the ground that dispatching of such letter
amounted to seeking execution of the order dated 28.08.2018 passed in Cr.W.J.C. No. 431 of 2016
and analogous cases which was not permissible. The petitioner has laid a Patna High Court CWJC
No.8836 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019 grievance that before forming an opinion on his letter, the Hon'ble
Chief Justice ought to have accorded audience to him. It has also been argued that there is an
in-house procedure for enquiry into the conduct of an Hon'ble Judge, which procedure has been
formulated by the Supreme Court and in such in-house procedure, if a complaint is received against
a judge of the High Court by the Chief Justice of the High Court, the same is required to be
examined. If it is found to be frivolous or related to the merits of a substantive decision in a judicial
matter or does not involve any serious complaint of misconduct or impropriety, the same is required
to be filed/consigned. If the complaint is of a serious nature, the response of the respective judge
need be invited, which if found satisfactory, the matter could again be consigned. If the allegations
against a judge require a deeper probe, the response of the concerned judge and the complaint has
to be forwarded to the Chief Justice of India.
16. It was thus argued, while castigating the letter of the Registrar General dated 18.02.2019, that
Patna High Court CWJC No.8836 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019 even in discharge of administrative
functions, if it affects the rights of a person, there is a necessity of adherence to the principle of
natural justice and that any action which is likely to adversely affect a person need not be carried out
behind the back of the concerned person.
17. By way of supplementary affidavit, the petitioner has also brought on record the letter which he
has received from the General Administrative Department, Government of Bihar dated 25.02.2019,
desiring that the petitioner ought to explain and inform within three days whether any appeal or
judicial proceeding preferred by him in his personal capacity against the order dated 28.08.2018 is
pending in any court of law and why the cost paid by the State Government to the bank officials be
not recovered from him immediately and a disciplinary action be taken against him for writing a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146872835/ 7
K. K. Pathak @ Keshav Kumar Pathak vs The High Court Of Judicature At Patna on 8 July, 2019
letter to Hon'ble the Chief Justice, criticizing and adversely commenting upon a judicial order
passed by one of the Hon'ble Judges of the Court and making personal comment against him in an
indignified manner.
Patna High Court CWJC No.8836 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019
18. It has been submitted on behalf of the petitioner that he has already given his explanation to the
General Administration Department. The petitioner has also brought on record a copy of the letter
dated 01.03.2019 issued by the General Administration Department informing the Registrar
General of High Court that the Government has decided to pay the cost of Rs. 1,75,000/- (Rs.
25000/- to each of the bank officials against whom FIR was lodged) and the process of payment is
afoot. The petitioner also has been informed by letter dated 07.03.2019 that his show cause reply
has been rejected and that the Government has decided to recover the aforesaid cost paid to the
bank officials from him.
19. The petitioner has now sought information from the High Court under RTI Act whether the
in-house procedure in cases of complaint against a judge has been followed by the High Court or not
but no information is said to have been provided by the PIO of the High Court and therefore the
petitioner has preferred an appeal before Patna High Court CWJC No.8836 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019
the appellate authority viz. the High Court on 08.05.2019 which is pending.
20. The stand of the High Court is that the writ petition is misconceived and premature and there is
no reason for the petitioner to feel aggrieved by the letter of the Registrar General dated 18.02.2019
which contains observations of Hon'ble the Chief Justice of Patna High Court. In the affidavit of the
High Court, it has been stated that this writ petition was filed simultaneously with the Special Leave
to Appeal No. 3566 of 2019 before the Supreme Court against the order passed in M.J.C. Case No.
3928/2018, which has been dismissed on 26.04.2019. It has further been averred that in the M.J.C.
Case No. 3928 of 2018, preferred by the petitioner for recall of certain paragraphs in the order dated
28.08.2018, the stand of the State was categorical that the directions issued in the order dated
28.08.2018 passed in Cr.W.J.C. No. 431 of 2016 and other analogous matters shall be complied with
promptly.
Patna High Court CWJC No.8836 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019
21. Mr. Mrigank Mauli, learned advocate for the High Court has further submitted that the present
writ petition is premised on the understanding of the petitioner that the communication dated
18.02.2019 made by the Registrar General of the High Court to the Chief Secretary, which has been
impugned in the present petition, will have an adverse bearing on his career as it is stigmatic and
such communication only seeks to have the judicial order complied with through an administrative
action. It was argued by Mr. Mrigank Mauli that the impugned letter dated 18.02.2019 of the
Registrar General of the High Court only records a prima facie view of the matter and is aimed at
seeking further information before proceeding any further in the matter. The information sought by
such letter is relevant in as much as the petitioner has not disclosed that he had challenged the order
rejecting the M.J.C. application dated 01.02.2019 before the Supreme Court of India. There cannot
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146872835/ 8
K. K. Pathak @ Keshav Kumar Pathak vs The High Court Of Judicature At Patna on 8 July, 2019
be any grievance against the Registrar General seeking information whether the State has proceeded
to comply with the judgment passed by the Patna High Court CWJC No.8836 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019
learned Single Judge on 28.08.2018 against which the S.L.P. preferred by the State of Bihar before
the Supreme Court has been dismissed.
22. The personal/confidential letter of the petitioner refers to the merits of a judgment which was
absolutely unwarranted and impermissible, more so when the order has been tested before the
Supreme Court and no interference was made with the order. A serious exception has been taken by
the High Court that the statement of the petitioner in his personal and confidential letter regarding
an Hon'ble Judge of the High Court, holding bias against him since his lawyers days, is not based or
supported on any materials and particulars viz. whether the Hon'ble Judge had ever worked for or
against the petitioner etc.
23. The sum and substance of the submissions made on behalf of the High Court is therefore that
the petitioner is aggrieved by the judicial order dated 28.08.2018 passed in Cr.W.J.C. No. 431 of
2016 and other analogous cases. It has additionally been submitted Patna High Court CWJC
No.8836 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019 that the personal letter dated 29.11.2018 addressed to Hon'ble the
Chief Justice was dispatched on 30.11.2018 only contained the merits of the judicial order apart
from unsubstantiated and scurrilous remarks against an Hon'ble Judge of this Court.
24. From the perusal of the letter dated 18.02.2019 written by the Registrar General of the High
Court to the Chief Secretary of the State of Bihar, it plainly appears that information was sought
from the Government about any challenge to the order dated 28.08.2018 at the behest of the
petitioner and whether the directions in such order after the rejection of the S.L.A in the Supreme
Court has been complied or not. This does not at all mean that the order dated 28.08.2018 was
sought to be complied with. Seeking information and passing an order (administrative or judicial)
for compliance of a judicial order are two different things. The letter impugned does contain the
observations of Hon'ble the Chief Justice, which has prompted such letter to the Chief Secretary by
the Registrar General so that all necessary Patna High Court CWJC No.8836 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019
facts are gathered before any decision is taken over the issue of the petitioner making
contumacious/contemptuous/scurrilous remark against an Hon'ble Judge of the High Court
without there being any foundation or basis for the same. The necessity of seeking further
information arose out of the fact that almost simultaneously with the confidential letter to Hon'ble
the Chief Justice, the petitioner had challenged the order rejecting the M.J.C. application before the
Supreme Court. The prima facie view regarding the statement made by the petitioner having the
potency of adversely commenting upon a judge, without there being any basis, cannot at all be said
to be a formation of an opinion in that regard. Whether the information/comment of the petitioner
is genuine or only a reaction against a judicial order, is required to be confirmed.
25. The in-house procedure which the petitioner has harped upon is to be invoked only when it is
found that the allegations are serious, requiring any probe. So far as the comment on the merits of a
judicial order is Patna High Court CWJC No.8836 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019 concerned, that was not
required to be gone into as the merits of a judicial order is assayed only in a higher judicial forum.
However, while commenting upon the judgment/order of a Court, if a scurrilous and undeserved
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146872835/ 9
K. K. Pathak @ Keshav Kumar Pathak vs The High Court Of Judicature At Patna on 8 July, 2019
remark is made then before initiating any proceeding, it is necessary to know the actual state of
affairs and the stage of the case.
26. I find nothing wrong in such communication which is only an information seeking exercise. The
challenge to the order dated 28.08.2018 passed in Cr.W.J.C. No. 431 of 2016 and analogous cases
has miserably failed. The comments on the author of the judgment therefore cannot be taken lightly,
especially if there is no basis for the same. Whether a letter/complaint like this is consigned or is
acted upon, is in the domain of Hon'ble the Chief Justice who has received the
representation/complaint. There can be no gainsaying that before initiating a contempt proceeding
against any person, much less a senior officer of the Government, all necessary information must be
in hand with respect to the stage of Patna High Court CWJC No.8836 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019 the
case; as after all the anger/ire against an Hon'ble Judge has been generated only after the judgment
and perhaps its impact and fallout. Had there been any material or instance in support of such
statement of the petitioner regarding a judge holding bias against him, the matter would have been
different which may have required a deeper probe. A general complaint and that also after passing
of a judicial order against an officer, is not to be dealt with always by giving a personal audience to
such complainant. It all depends upon specific facts in each instance and no uniform principle could
be laid down for the same.
27. I have gone through the confidential letter of the petitioner which has been annexed with this
petition. I do not deem it necessary to refer to the comments of the petitioner on the rationale and
reasoning in the judgment of the Hon'ble Judge. But the bald allegation of bias of the Hon'ble Judge
against him only reflects that the petitioner has been rather reckless in making such comment
against an Hon'ble Judge without offering any basis or justification Patna High Court CWJC
No.8836 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019 for the same. This is contempt of Court simplicitor, especially when
viewed in the context of the Hon'ble Judge having given a reasoned judgment which adversely
affects him and the challenge to such judgment before the Supreme Court has also failed. This
definitely is required to be viewed and dealt with seriously.
28. In C. Ravichandran Iyer Vs. Justice A.M. Bhattacharjee & Ors. reported in (1995) 5 SCC 457, the
Supreme Court has held that:
In a democracy governed by the rule of law under a written constitution, judiciary is
the sentinel on the qui vive to protect the fundamental rights and to poise even scales
of justice between the citizens and the State or the States inter se. Rule of law and
judicial review are basic features of the Constitution. As its integral constitutional
structure, independence of the judiciary is an essential attribute of rule of law. It is,
therefore, absolutely essential that the judiciary must be free from executive pressure
or influence which has been secured by making elaborate provisions in Patna High
Court CWJC No.8836 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019 the Constitution with details. The
independence of judiciary is not limited only to the independence from the executive
pressure or influence; it is a wider concept which takes within its sweep
independence from any other pressure and prejudices. It has many dimensions, viz.,
fearlessness of other power centres, economic or political, and freedom from
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146872835/ 10
K. K. Pathak @ Keshav Kumar Pathak vs The High Court Of Judicature At Patna on 8 July, 2019
prejudices acquired and nourished by the class to which the Judges belong.
Independent judiciary is, therefore, most essential when liberty of citizen is in
danger. It then becomes the duty of the judiciary to poise the scales of justice
unmoved by the powers (actual or perceived), undisturbed by the clamour of the
multitude. The heart of judicial independence is judicial individualism. The judiciary
is not a disembodied abstraction. It is composed of individual men and women who
work primarily on their own.
29. If a judge is criticized unnecessarily and without any basis, it only amounts to damaging the very
bastion of the independence of judiciary, for a judge under Patna High Court CWJC No.8836 of
2019 dt.08-07-2019 comment has no forum to defend himself. The concept of democracy, liberty
and justice which form the backbone of rule of law gets a serious jolt when a judicial office, which is
more in the nature of a public trust, is adversely commented upon without any reason. There is no
personal interest of a judge in deciding a matter and he does so on his moral conviction and
knowledge of law and always keeps an exacting standard of propriety in his judicial conduct. Such a
diatribe against a judge, that also when a serious view has been taken by him in a case involving the
petitioner surely has the potency of damaging the moral and ethical fabric of judiciary and thereby
lessen public confidence in the justice delivery system. Such action cannot be taken lightly.
30. The letter of the Registrar General seeking information from the Chief Secretary is only aimed at
dealing with this aspect viz. upholding the majesty and independence of judiciary.
31. Since this Court has been called upon to decide whether the letter of the Registrar General dated
Patna High Court CWJC No.8836 of 2019 dt.08-07-2019 18.02.2019 is required to be
quashed/expunged as it is unwarranted, I say no further, but reject the petition as being without any
basis and as a further attempt of the petitioner to deflect the course of justice.
32. The petition is dismissed.
33. It would be for the Registrar General to place the information collected by him from the
Government before Hon'ble the Chief Justice for any further action which he may deem fit in the
facts of the case.
34. Cost easy.
