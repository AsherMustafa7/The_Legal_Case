(cid:12) W.P.No.6033 of 2020
Writ Petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India,
for issuance of a Writ of Declaration to declare the impugned Valuation
Alert Notice dated 08.05.2017 issued in F.No.S/V-Val. Cell-07/2016-
2017 issued by the third respondent with the approval of the second
respondent as illegal and arbitrary.
For Petitioner : Mr.Hari Radhakrishnan
For Respondents : M/s.R.Hemalatha
Senior Standing Counsel
ORDER
The petitioner has challenged the impugned Valuation Alert Notice dated 08.05.2017 bearing
reference F.No.S/V-Val.Cell-07/2016-2017 issued by the third respondent.
2. Appearing on behalf of the petitioner, the learned counsel submits that the impugned Valuation
Alert is contrary to the provisions of Section 14 of Customs, Act, 1962 and unnecessarily interferes
with the assessment by an Assessing Officer.
______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Page No 2 of 19
3. The learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that every time when the petitioner
attempts to file a Bill of Entry, the transaction value declared in the Bill of Entry by the petitioner is
revised by the respondents in the system in terms of the impugned Valuation Alert. It is submitted
that the petitioner is therefore forced to pay higher customs duty on the value imposed by the
respondents. It is submitted that the imported goods being natural products (Apple) and being
perishable in nature, the petitioner is forced to incur higher duty which indirectly affects the profits
of the petitioner.
4. The learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that unless circumstances exist for
countermanding the transaction value declared, the question of invoking the provisions of the
Customs Valuation (Determination of Value of Imported Goods) Rules, 2007 does not arise. The
value can be determined by proceedings sequentially only under Rules 4 to 9 of the aforesaid Rules
if circumstanced warranted. Imposition of Valuation Alert and Benchmark price is not align to the
Customs Act, 1962.

M/S. Ig International Private Limited vs The Deputy Commissioner Of Customs ... on 17 December, 2021
5. It is submitted that fixing higher value as per Benchmark price to assess the import consignment
as per the impugned Valuation Alert Notice is contrary to the method of Valuation prescribed under
Section 14 of the Customs Act, 1962 and Customs Valuation (Determination of Value of Imported
Goods) Rules, 2007.
6. It is further submitted that the impugned Valuation Alert is not binding on the Assessing Officers
for the purpose of assessment of imported consignments to follow the same and thus interfered with
the Assessment of Bill of Entry.
7. The learned counsel for the petitioner has filed copies of their sale contract to show that the
transactions with the foreign sellers are negotiated and that the price is sole consideration and there
is no suppression in the value and therefore the Impugned Valuation Alert cannot be imposed.
______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Page No 4 of 19
8. The learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that earlier the petitioner has also filed
W.P.No.6029 of 2020 for a Mandamus to direct the respondents to follow the order of the Appellate
Commissioner dated 01.05.2014 and 31.10.2014 in Order in Appeal C.Cus.No.763/2014 and in
Order in Appeal C.Cus.II No.89/2014.
9. The learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that the orders of the Appellate
Commissioner are binding on the Assessing Officers in the light of the decision of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in Union of India Vs. Kamalakshi Finance Corporation Ltd., 1991 (55) E.L.T. 433
(S.C.).
10. Appearing on behalf of the respondents, the learned Senior Standing Counsel for the respondent
submits that the Impugned Valuation Alert is only an internal communication between the officers
and was merely served as a guidance for “The Proper Officers” at the time of assessment.
______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Page No 5 of 19
11. It is therefore submitted that there is no merits in the present writ petition. It is submitted that
the present writ petition is not maintainable against the impugned Valuation Alert dated 08.05.2017
of the third respondent.
12. The learned Senior Standing Counsel for the respondents has referred to Paragraph 5 of the
counter affidavit, wherein, it has been stated that the valuation of imported goods is done by the
first respondent by applying Customs (Determination of Price of Imported Goods) Rules, 2007 and
that it is not true to state that the impugned valuation alert dated 08.05.2017 issued by the third
respondent in F.No.S/V-Val.Cell-07/2016- 17 is the basis for the valuation and that the alerts are
meant only for departmental circulation for the guidance of the assessing officers to know the
approximate prices that are prevailing in different export countries for the particular commodity. It
is submitted that this data helps the officers who has to access the correct determination value.

M/S. Ig International Private Limited vs The Deputy Commissioner Of Customs ... on 17 December, 2021
13. It is further submitted that the impugned Valuation Alert has been issued in line with Rule 5 of
the Customs Valuation (Determination of Value of Imported Goods) Rules, 2007 and therefore this
writ petition is devoid any merits. It is therefore submitted that the writ petition filed by the
petitioner is liable to be dismissed.
14. By way of rejoinder, the learned counsel for the petitioner submits that every time the petitioner
had filed a Bill of Entry, there is a pop-up in the dash board of the ICEGATE Web Portal, as a result
of which, the petitioner is constrained to pay Customs Duty in excess and is forced to litigate. It is
submitted that such litigation results not only in waste of time but also in waste of money and
therefore submits that the writ petition filed by the petitioner deserves to be allowed by directing the
second and third respondents who are the jurisdictional proper officers to assess the Assessment Bill
of Entry in accordance with the Provisions of the Customs Act, 1962.
15. I have considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioner and the
learned Senior Standing Counsel for the ______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Page
No 7 of 19 respondents. I have perused the Impugned Valuation Alert of the third respondent. The
relevant portion of the impugned Valuation Alert reads as under:-
“The prices given in the table above are the benchmark prices that are applicable to
the specific variety, grade and count of Fruit per carton/pack. Hence, due care should
be taken to ensure that all parameters are correctly declared in the Bill of Entry.
Accordingly, officers at all Customs House are advised to consider these prices as
benchmarks prices while assessing the Bill of Entry of fresh fruits. As and when
change is notices in the description or value of the goods at this Custom House, the
same may please be informed immediately and assessments may be done at higher
prices as and when such evidence comes to the notice. The assesing groups should do
their due diligence at the time of assessment and the benchmark prices are only for
the reference purpose. This valuation alert is for guidance purpose only and should
not be quoted in adjudication orders.
16. Section 14 of the Customs Act, 1962 reads as under:-
14. Valuation of goods.—(1) For the purposes of the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 (51 of
1975), or any other law for the time being in force, the value of the

price actually paid or payable for the goods when sold for export to India for delivery
at the time and place of importation, or as the case may be, for export from India for
delivery at the time and place of exportation, where the buyer and seller of the goods
are not related and price is the sole consideration for the sale subject to such other
conditions as may be specified in the rules made in this behalf:

(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-
section (1), if the Board is satisfied that it is necessary or expedient so to do, it may, by notification

shall be chargeable with reference to such tariff value.
Explanation.—For the purposes of this section —

M/S. Ig International Private Limited vs The Deputy Commissioner Of Customs ... on 17 December, 2021
17. As per Section 14 of the Customs Act, 1962, for the purposes ______________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Page No 10 of 19 of the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 (51 of 1975), or
any other law for the time being in force, the value of the imported goods and export goods shall be
the “transaction value” of such goods, that is to say, the price actually paid or payable for the goods
when sold for export to India for delivery at the time and place of importation, or as the case may be,
for export from India for delivery at the time and place of exportation, where the buyer and seller of
the goods are not related and price is the sole consideration for the sale subject to such other
conditions as may be specified in the rules made in this behalf.
18. The first proviso to Section 14 of the Customs Act, 1962 clearly states that such transaction value
in the case of imported goods shall include, in addition to the price as aforesaid, any amount paid or
payable for costs and services, including commissions and brokerage, engineering, design work,
royalties and licence fees, costs of transportation to the place of importation, insurance, loading,
unloading and handling charges to the extent and in the manner specified in the rules made in this
behalf.
19. It is for an importer to declare the correct “transaction value” ______________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Page No 11 of 19 which is the negotiated price with the foreign
supplier/seller for the purpose of assessment under the provisions of the Customs Act, 1962 and
have the assessment completed.
20. The Customs Valuation (Determination of Value of Imported Goods) Rules, 2007 spells out the
manner in which the Valuation has to be determined. Rule 3 of the Customs Valuation
(Determination of Value of Imported Goods) Rules, 2007 reads as under:-
3. Determination of the method of valuation.-
(1) Subject to rule 12, the value of imported goods shall be the transaction value
adjusted in accordance with provisions of rule 10;
(2) Value of imported goods under sub-rule (1) shall be accepted:
Provided that -
(a) there are no restrictions as to the disposition or use of the goods by the buyer
other than restrictions which -
(i) are imposed or required by law or by the public authorities in India; or
(ii) limit the geographical area in which the goods may be resold; or
______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Page No 12 of 19
(iii) do not substantially affect the value of the goods;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173909321/ 6
M/S. Ig International Private Limited vs The Deputy Commissioner Of Customs ... on 17 December, 2021
(b) the sale or price is not subject to some condition or consideration for which a
value cannot be determined in respect of the goods being valued;
(c) no part of the proceeds of any subsequent resale, disposal or use of the goods by
the buyer will accrue directly or indirectly to the seller, unless an appropriate
adjustment can be made in accordance with the provisions of rule 10 of these rules;
and
(d) the buyer and seller are not related, or where the buyer and seller are related, that
transaction value is acceptable for customs purposes under the provisions of sub-rule
(3) below.
(3) (a) Where the buyer and seller are related, the transaction value shall be accepted
provided that the examination of the circumstances of the sale of the imported goods
indicate that the relationship did not influence the price.
(b) In a sale between related persons, the transaction value shall be accepted,
whenever the importer demonstrates that the declared value of the goods being
valued, closely approximates to one of the following values ascertained at or about
the same time.
(i) the transaction value of identical goods, or of similar goods, in sales to unrelated
buyers in India;
(ii) the deductive value for identical goods or similar goods;
______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Page No 13 of 19
(iii) the computed value for identical goods or similar goods:
Provided that in applying the values used for comparison, due account shall be taken
of demonstrated difference in commercial levels, quantity levels, adjustments in
accordance with the provisions of rule 10 and cost incurred by the seller in sales in
which he and the buyer are not related;
(c) substitute values shall not be established under the provisions of clause (b) of this
sub-rule.
(4) if the value cannot be determined under the provisions of sub-rule (1), the value
shall be determined by proceeding sequentially through rule 4 to 9.
21. A reading of the above Rules makes it clear that valuation cannot be based on any Benchmark
price. Assessment can be based on the “transaction value” where such value exists and where the
value declared by an importer does not represent the transaction value. The value is to be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173909321/ 7
M/S. Ig International Private Limited vs The Deputy Commissioner Of Customs ... on 17 December, 2021
determined by proceeding sequentially through Rules 4 to 9 of the Customs Valuation
(Determination of Value of Imported Goods) Rules, 2007.
______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Page No 14 of 19
22. An Assessing Officer who is the proper officer is merely required to ascertain the “transaction
value” and unless there are reasons to countermand on the value declared by an importer, the
question of following Rule 4 to Rule 16 sequentially also does not arise.
23. In fact, even the Central Board of Excise and Customs is not empowered to issue any circular
under Section 151A of the Customs Act, 1962 which interferes with the assessment proceeding. Third
respondent who is merely an officer under the Customs Act, 1962 cannot issue such diktats
howsoever innocuous they may appear on an apparent reading.
24. Impugned Valuation Alert published and flashed in the public domain and the official Website
though may appear innocuous, yet they do interfere with the assessment process. It is therefore to
be held that the impugned Valuation Alter is neither binding on the petitioner nor on the Assessing
Officers.
25. Therefore, assessment based on such Valuation Alert would be ______________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Page No 15 of 19 contrary to Section 14 of the Customs Act, 1962.
Issue of such Valuation Alert is also not contemplated under the scheme of the Act. It is therefore
ultra vires the provision of the Customs Act, 1962.
26. This matter has been settled by the Hon'ble Supreme Court long back in the case of Eicher
Tractor Limited Vs. Commissioner of Customs, Mumbai, 2000 (122) ELT 321 (SC).
27. If a assessing officer assessing the goods has any valid reasons to countermand the value
declared by an importer, the assessing officer can do so and impose higher value by invoking the
provisions of the Customs Valuation (Determination of Value of Imported Goods) Rules, 2007.
Alternatively, assessment can be provisional and the imported consignment can be allowed to be
cleared after securing the interest of the revenue by getting adequate security from the importer or
by issuing a notice under Section 28 of the Customs Act, 1962 to recover duty if the assessment is
completed and goods have been allowed to be cleared.
28.The first respondent as an assessing officer is to be only guided ______________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Page No 16 of 19 the provisions in Section 14 of the Customs Act,
1962 read with Customs Valuation (Determination of Value of Imported Goods) Rules, 2007 and the
law declared by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.
29. If the respondents have programmed their ED System/ Website, as a result of which, assessment
is being completed based on Bench Mark Price in the impugned Valuation Alerts, the respondents
shall take suitable steps to remove such feature from the their website/systems forthwith.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/173909321/ 8
M/S. Ig International Private Limited vs The Deputy Commissioner Of Customs ... on 17 December, 2021
30. The information in the impugned Valuation Alter can be exchanged internally for the purpose of
guidance if the value declared by the importers is far below the accepted prevailing international
price and/or in case of any suspicion. The respondents may use their discretion to secure the
interest of the revenue.
31. In the light of the above, this Writ Petition stands disposed by holding that the impugned
Circular is neither binding the petitioner nor the respondents under the provisions of the Customs
Act, 1962. ______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Page No 17 of 19 Respondents are
directed to ensure the impugned Valuation Alerts is removed from the EDI system/Website and
assessment is completed strictly in accordance with the provisions of the Act. No cost.
