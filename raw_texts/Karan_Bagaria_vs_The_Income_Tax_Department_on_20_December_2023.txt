THIS CRIMINAL PETITION IS FILED UNDER SECTION 482 OF
CR.P.C., PRAYING TO QUASH THE PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF
C.C.NO.326/2016 PENDING BEFORE THE SPECIAL COURT
(ECONOMIC OFFENCES), BENGALURU.
THESE CRIMINAL PETITIONS HAVING BEEN HEARD AND
RESERVED FOR ORDERS, COMING ON FOR PRONOUNCEMENT THIS
DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:-
ORDER
Conglomeration of these cases call in question proceedings initiated against the petitioners under
Section 276C of the Income Tax Act, 1961 ('the Act' for short). Since issues raised and facts leading
to registration of crime in every one of these cases are similar, they are taken up together and
considered in this common order.
2. Facts leading to initiation of proceedings have a slight variation from petition to petition.
Therefore, I deem it appropriate to succinctly note the facts in each of the petitions.
3. The petitioners in all these cases are income tax assesses for decades. Criminal Petition Nos.909
and 4590 of 2017 concern one Anurag Bagaria. He claims to be a businessman and is assessed to pay
tax in his individual capacity right from 1977. At the relevant point in time, the petitioner while filing
his returns under Section 139 of the Act, claimed certain deductions under Chapter VI-A and in
particular, deductions under the heads of Long Term Capital Gain/Short Term Capital Loss. Long
after the said deductions, sometime around September, 2015 the Income-Tax Department conducts
search under Section 132 of the Act and later registers a crime on 30-07-2016 which becomes a
crime in C.C.No.221 of 2016 for offence punishable under Section 276C(1) of the Act. Petitioners in
other petitions also belong to the family members of this petitioner. All of them alleged of the same
act of willful evasion of tax and are charged of offence under Section 276C(1) of the Act.
4. Criminal Petition Nos.910 and 4591 of 2017 arise out of C.C.No.222 and 328 of 2016 respectively.
The petitioner therein is the brother of the petitioner in Crl.P.No.909 of 2017. Criminal Petition Nos.
911 and 4592 of 2017 arise out of C.C.Nos. 223 and 327 of 2016 respectively and are filed by one
Kum Kum Bagaria, mother of the petitioner in Crl.P.No.909 of 2017. Criminal Petition Nos. 912 and
4594 of 2017 arise out of C.C. Nos. 224 and 325 of 2016 respectively and are filed by M/s Kemfin
Services Private Limited, a Company which belongs to the petitioner in Crl.P.No.909 of 2017.
Criminal petition Nos. 913 and 4595 of 2017 arise out of C.C.Nos.225 and 326 of 2016 respectively.
These petitions are preferred by M/s Bioworth India Private Limited, again owned by the petitioner
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158937996/ 8
Karan Bagaria vs The Income Tax Department on 20 December, 2023
in Crl.P.No.909 of 2017.
5. One common stream that runs through in all these petitions is willful evasion of tax on claims
made under the head Long Term Capital Gain/Short Term Capital Loss. Against all these petitioners
for filing of income tax returns by claiming Long Term Capital Gain/Short Term Capital Loss
proceedings are initiated by registering a crime invoking Section 200 of the CrPC for offence
punishable under Section 276C of the Act. The infirmities pointed out in the complaints registered
independently against all the members of the family and the Companies succinctly stated are as
follows:
In Criminal Petition Nos. 909 and 4590 of 2017 the allegation is that the petitioner
for the financial year 2012-13 had made a bogus long term capital gain of
`1,42,03,110/- from trading in scripts of JMD Telefilm Industries, Splash Media,
Essar India, Tuni Textiles Limited and Alpha. In Criminal Petition Nos.910 and 4591
of 2017 the allegation is that for the financial year 2012-13 the brother of petitioner in
Crl.P.No.909 of 2017 had made a claim for long term capital gains which is alleged to
be bogus to the tune of `2,78,62,110/- from trading in the aforesaid scripts. In
Criminal Petition Nos. 911 and 4592 of 2017 the allegation is similar. The claim is
also the same as also the scripts. In Criminal Petition Nos.912 and 4594 of 2017 and
Criminal Petition Nos. 913 and 4595 of 2017 which belong to the Companies, the
allegation is the same.
The financial year vary from 2010-11 to 2012-13. Here the Company has claimed
capital gain of `19,22,44,266/- by trading with the same Companies. In Criminal
petition No.913 of 2017, the Company is said to have claimed long term capital gain
of `1,93,02,738/- by trading with the same Company. Therefore, the solitary stream
of allegation that runs qua the petitioners in all these cases is that the petitioners
have registered long term capital gain or short term capital loss and thus the claims
registered are bogus. It appears that all these claims so registered by the respective
income tax assessees for the year 2010-11 which runs through 2012-13, the claims
were accepted by the Income-Tax Department. At a later point in time, it was found
that these claims had some suspicion. Based thereon assessment proceedings were
instituted under the Income Tax Act for levy of penalty and simultaneously search
was conducted under Section 132 of the Act.
Statements of assessees were recorded under sub-section (4) of Section 132 of the Act
and premises were also searched and later on, crimes come to be registered under
Section 276-C of the Act.
Registration of the crime is what has driven the petitioners to this Court in these
petitions.
6. Heard Sri Gautam Bharadwaj, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners in all these cases and
Sri Dilip M., and Sri. E. I. Sanmathi, learned counsel appearing for the respondent/revenue.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158937996/ 9
Karan Bagaria vs The Income Tax Department on 20 December, 2023
7. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioners would at the outset contend that there is no
element of mens rea involved in any of the transactions. It is at best an incorrect claim which would
not amount to willful evasion of tax. He would contend that the moment search was conducted and
the petitioners have been advised, they have waived all the claims and have paid the tax that was
necessary to be paid by filing their revised returns on 26-10-2016. On that basis, the learned counsel
would again contend that there is no willful evasion of tax. It is his submission that criminal
proceedings ought to have awaited conclusion of assessment proceedings under the Act as evasion
itself is yet to be determined in the assessment proceedings. Therefore, criminal prosecution was
initiated in a hurry. He would lastly contend that the order of the learned Magistrate in taking
cognizance of the offences suffer from blatant non-application of mind and, therefore vitiated and
all proceedings taken thereto are to be treated as a nullity in law. In effect, he would seek quashment
of proceedings in all these cases.
8. The learned counsel appearing for the respondent/ revenue would vehemently refute the
submissions to contend that the petitioners did not file revise returns on their own volition. The
search conducted on the premises of the petitioners revealed that they had made certain alleged
bogus claims. It is only after that act, the petitioners have come out and filed their revised returns.
He would submit that it does amount to willful evasion of tax as, if it would have been undetected, it
would pass muster. He would, therefore, submit that the proceedings are appropriately initiated and
since petitioners have by themselves paid tax through revised returns, no assessment determination
would require to await initiation of proceedings under Section 276C of the Act. He would submit
that this Court should not interfere in exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 482 of the CrPC on
any of the grounds in favour of assessees who have willfully evaded payment of tax. Both the counsel
appearing for assessees and revenue have relied on several judgments which would bear
consideration according to their relevance in the course of the order.
9. I have given my anxious consideration to the submissions made by the respective learned counsel
and have perused the material on record.
10. The afore-narrated facts are not in dispute. The petitioners, be it individuals or Companies, now
alleged of similar offences are all income-tax assessees for several decades.
Between the years 2010-11 and 2012-13 individuals and Companies had registered two claims - one
deduction for long term capital gain and the other deduction for short term capital loss while filing
their returns under Section 139 of the Act. All was well up to September, 2015. The Department
conducted search on all the petitioners herein under Section 132 of the Act. Section 132 of the Act
reads as follows:
"132. Search and seizure.--(1) [Where the [Principal Director General or Director
General] or Director or the [Principal Chief Commissioner or Chief Commissioner] or

(4) The authorised officer may, during the course of the search or seizure, examine on oath any
person who is found to be in possession or control of any books of account, documents, money,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158937996/ 13
Karan Bagaria vs The Income Tax Department on 20 December, 2023
bullion, jewellery or other valuable article or thing and any statement made by such person during
such examination may thereafter be used in evidence in any proceeding under the Indian Income
Tax Act, 1922 (11 of 1922), or under this Act.
Explanation.--For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that the examination of any person
under this sub- section may be not merely in respect of any books of account, other documents or
assets found as a result of the search, but also in respect of all matters relevant for the purposes of
any investigation connected with any proceeding under the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922 (11 of
1922), or under this Act.
(4-A) Where any books of account, other documents, money, bullion, jewellery or other valuable
article or thing are or is found in the possession or control of any person in the course of a search, it
may be presumed--
(i) that such books of account, other documents, money, bullion, jewellery or other valuable article
or thing belong or belongs to such person;
(ii) that the contents of such books of account and other documents are true; and
(iii) that the signature and every other part of such books of account and other documents which
purport to be in the handwriting of any particular person or which may reasonably be assumed to
have been signed by, or to be in the handwriting of, any particular person, are in that person's
handwriting, and in the case of a document, stamped, executed or attested, that it was duly stamped
and executed or attested by the person by whom it purports to have been so executed or attested.
[* * *] (8) The books of account or other documents seized under sub-section (1) or sub-section (1-A)
shall not be retained by the authorised officer for a period exceeding [thirty days from the date of the
[order of assessment or reassessment or recomputation under sub-section (3) of section 143 or
section 144 or section 147 or] [ Section 153- A or clause (c) of Section 158-BC]] unless the reasons for
retaining the same are recorded by him in writing and the approval of the [Principal Chief
Commissioner or Chief Commissioner], [Principal Commissioner or Commissioner], [Principal
Director General or Director General] or Director] for such retention is obtained:
Provided that the [Principal Chief Commissioner or Chief Commissioner], [Principal
Commissioner or Commissioner], [Principal Director General or Director General] or
Director] shall not authorise the retention of the books of account and other
documents for a period exceeding thirty days after all the proceedings under the
Indian Income Tax Act, 1922 (11 of 1922), or this Act in respect of the years for which
the books of account or other documents are relevant are completed.
[(8-A) An order under sub-section (3) shall not be in force for a period exceeding
sixty days from the date of the order:] Provided that the [[Principal Director or
Director] or, as the case may be, [Principal Commissioner or Commissioner]] shall
not approve the extension of the period for any period beyond the expiry of thirty
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158937996/ 14
Karan Bagaria vs The Income Tax Department on 20 December, 2023
days after the completion of all the proceedings under this Act in respect of the years
for which the books of account, other documents, money, bullion, jewellery or other
valuable articles or things are relevant.
(9) The person from whose custody any books of account or other documents are
seized under sub-section (1) or sub-section (1-A) may make copies thereof, or take
extracts therefrom, in the presence of the authorised officer or any other person
empowered by him in this behalf, at such place and time as the authorised officer
may appoint in this behalf.
[(9-A) Where the authorised officer has no jurisdiction over the person referred to in clause (a) or
clause (b) or clause (c) of sub-section (1), the books of account or other documents, or any money,
bullion, jewellery or other valuable article or thing (hereafter in this section and in Sections 132-A
and 132-B referred to as the assets) seized under that sub-section shall be handed over by the
authorised officer to the Assessing Officer having jurisdiction over such person within a period of
sixty days from the date on which the last of the authorisations for search was executed and
thereupon the powers exercisable by the authorised officer under sub-section (8) or sub-section (9)
shall be exercisable by such Assessing Officer.] [(9-B) Where, during the course of the search or
seizure or within a period of sixty days from the date on which the last of the authorisations for
search was executed, the authorised officer, for reasons to be recorded in writing, is satisfied that for
the purpose of protecting the interest of revenue, it is necessary so to do, he may with the previous
approval of the Principal Director General or Director General or the Principal Director or Director,
by order in writing, attach provisionally any property belonging to the assessee, and for the said
purposes, the provisions of the Second Schedule shall, mutatis mutandis, apply.
(9-C) Every provisional attachment made under sub- section (9B) shall cease to have effect after the
expiry of a period of six months from the date of the order referred to in sub-section (9B).
[(9-D) The authorised officer may, during the course of the search or seizure or within a period of
sixty days from the date on which the last of the authorisations for search was executed, make a
reference to,--
(i) a Valuation Officer referred to in Section 142-A; or
(ii) any other person or entity or any valuer registered by or under any law for the time being in
force, as may be approved by the Principal Chief Commissioner or the Chief Commissioner or the
Principal Director General or the Director General, in accordance with the procedure, as may be
prescribed, in this regard, who shall estimate the fair market value of the property in the manner as
may be prescribed, and submit a report of the estimate to the authorised officer or the Assessing
Officer, as the case may be, within a period of sixty days from the date of receipt of such reference.]]
(10) If a person legally entitled to the books of account or other documents seized under sub-section
(1) or sub-section (1-A) objects for any reason to the approval given by the [Principal Chief
Commissioner or Chief Commissioner], [Principal Commissioner or Commissioner], [Principal
Director General or Director General] or Director] under sub-section (8), he may make an
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158937996/ 15
Karan Bagaria vs The Income Tax Department on 20 December, 2023
application to the Board stating therein the reasons for such objection and requesting for the return
of the books of account or other documents [and the Board may, after giving the applicant an
opportunity of being heard, pass such orders as it thinks fit].
[* * *] (13) The provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), relating to searches
and seizure shall apply, so far as may be, to searches and seizure under sub- section (1) or
sub-section (1-A).
(14) The Board may make rules in relation to any search or seizure under this section; in particular,
and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power, such rules may provide for the
procedure to be followed by the authorised officer--
(i) for obtaining ingress into any building, place, vessel, vehicle or aircraft to be searched where free
ingress thereto is not available;
(ii) for ensuring safe custody of any books of account or other documents or assets seized.
[Explanation 1.-- For the purposes of sub-sections (9- A), (9-B) and (9-D), the last of authorisation
for search shall be deemed to have been executed,--
(a) in the case of search, on the conclusion of search as recorded in the last panchnama drawn in
relation to any person in whose case the warrant of authorisation has been issued; or
(b) in the case of requisition under Section 132-A, on the actual receipt of the books of account or
other documents or assets by the authorised officer.] Explanation 2.--In this section, the word
"proceeding" means any proceeding in respect of any year, whether under the Indian Income Tax
Act, 1922 (11 of 1922), or this Act, which may be pending on the date on which a search is authorised
under this section or which may have been completed on or before such date and includes also all
proceedings under this Act which may be commenced after such date in respect of any year."
(Emphasis supplied) Section 132 deals with search and seizure. Sub-section (4) of Section 132 deals
with the power of the authorized officer, who shall, during the course of search or seizure, examine
on oath any person who is found to be in possession or control of any books of account, documents
inter alia and record any statement made by such person during the examination. This is
permissible to be used as evidence in any proceeding under the Act. The search results in seizing of
books of account. Seizure leads to discovery of certain payments claimed which according to the
Authorities were bogus.
The moment search was conducted and assessment proceedings commenced, the petitioners filed
their revised returns on 26-10-2016. The revised returns were filed waiving of claims, be it long term
capital gains or short term capital loss. Therefore, the tax stood cleared in the year 2016 through
revised returns. This fact is not in dispute. After the petitioners filed their revised returns
complaints come to be registered against all these petitioners invoking Section 200 of the CrPC
before the learned Magistrate for offences punishable under Section 276-C of the Act. Section 276-C
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158937996/ 16
Karan Bagaria vs The Income Tax Department on 20 December, 2023
of the Act reads as follows:
"276-C. Wilful attempt to evade tax, etc.--(1) If a person wilfully attempts in any
manner whatsoever to evade any tax, penalty or interest chargeable [or imposable, or
under reports his income,] under this Act, he shall, without prejudice to any penalty
that may be imposable on him under any other provision of this Act, be punishable,--
(i) in a case where the [or tax on under-reported income] exceeds [twenty-five
hundred thousand rupees], with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be
less than six months but which may extend to seven years and with fine;
(ii) in any other case, with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less
than three months but which may extend to [two years] and with fine.
(2) If a person wilfully attempts in any manner whatsoever to evade the payment of
any tax, penalty, or interest under this Act, he shall, without prejudice to any penalty
that may be imposable on him under any other provision of this Act, be punishable
with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than three months but
which may extend to [two years] and shall, in the discretion of the court, also be
liable to fine.
Explanation.--For the purposes of this section, a wilful attempt to evade any tax, payable or interest
chargeable or imposable under this Act or the payment thereof shall include a case where any
person--
(i) has in his possession or control any books of account or other documents (being books of account
or other documents relevant to any proceeding under this Act) containing a false entry or statement;
or
(ii) makes or causes to be made any false entry or statement in such books of account or other
documents; or
(iii) wilfully omits or causes to be omitted any relevant entry or statement in such books of account
or other documents; or
(iv) causes any other circumstance to exist which will have the effect of enabling such person to
evade any tax, penalty or interest chargeable or imposable under this Act or the payment thereof."
(Emphasis supplied) Section 276-C makes the person liable for punishment and penalty if one
willfully attempts in any manner whatsoever to evade any tax, penalty or interest chargeable.
Sub-section (2) of Section 276- C also deals with a person who willfully attempts to evade tax. The
proceedings are instituted for offences punishable under Section 276-C of the Act. The submission is
that there is no mens rea as it was a claim based on documents. The claim is not accepted by the
revenue. Mere non-acceptance of the claim by the revenue would not mean that evasion was willful.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158937996/ 17
Karan Bagaria vs The Income Tax Department on 20 December, 2023
On the contrary, the case of the revenue was that evasion was willful and, therefore, it is presumed
to be out of guilty mind i.e., mens rea.
11. Before embarking upon consideration of defence of the petitioners, I deem it appropriate to
notice the law laid down by the Apex Court and that of this Court interpreting Section 276-C of the
Act. The Apex Court in the case of M/s GUJARAT TRAVANCORE AGENCY, COCHIN v.
COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX, KERALA1 has held as follows:
".... .... .... ....
4. ......Indeed, many of them were considered by the High Court and are referred to in the judgment
under appeal. It is sufficient for us to refer to Section 271(1)(a), which provides that a penalty may
be imposed if the Income Tax Officer is satisfied that any person has without reasonable cause failed
to furnish the return of total income, and to Section 276-C which provides that if a person wilfully
fails to furnish in due time the return of income required under Section 139(1), he shall be
punishable with rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year or with fine. It is
clear that in the former case what is intended is a civil obligation while in the latter what is imposed
is a criminal sentence. There can be no dispute that having regard to the provisions of Section
276-C, which speaks of wilful failure on the part of the defaulter and taking into consideration the
nature of the penalty, which is punitive, no sentence can be imposed under that provision unless the
(1989) 3 SCC 52 element of mens rea is established. In most cases of criminal liability, the intention
of the legislature is that the penalty should serve as a deterrent. The creation of an offence by statute
proceeds on the assumption that society suffers injury by the act or omission of the defaulter and
that a deterrent must be imposed to discourage the repetition of the offence. In the case of a
proceeding under Section 271(1)(a), however, it seems that the intention of the legislature is to
emphasise the fact of loss of revenue and to provide a remedy for such loss, although no doubt an
element of coercion is present in the penalty. In this connection the terms in which the penalty falls
to be measured is significant. Unless there is something in the language of the statute indicating the
need to establish the element of mens rea it is generally sufficient to prove that a default in
complying with the statute has occurred. In our opinion, there is nothing in Section 271(1)(a) which
requires that mens rea must be proved before penalty can be levied under that provision. We are
supported by the statement in Corpus Juris Secundum, Vol. 85, p. 580, para 1023:
"A penalty imposed for a tax delinquency is a civil obligation, remedial and coercive
in its nature, and is far different from the penalty for a crime or a fine or forfeiture
provided as punishment for the violation of criminal or penal laws."
5. Accordingly, we hold that the element of mens rea was not required to be proved in the
proceedings taken by the Income Tax Officer under Section 271(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act against
the assessee for the assessment years 1965-1966 and 1966-1967."
(Emphasis supplied) The Apex Court holds that Section 276-C of the Act can be invoked only if a
person willfully fails to furnish in due time the return of income required under Section 139(1) of the
Act. It should be willful and should establish element of mens rea which would be sufficient to prove
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158937996/ 18
Karan Bagaria vs The Income Tax Department on 20 December, 2023
default in complying with the statute. This principle is reiterated in PREM DASS v. INCOME TAX
OFFICER 2 wherein it is held as follows:
"8. Wilful attempt to evade any tax, penalty or interest chargeable or imposable
under the Act under Section 276-C is a positive act on the part of the accused which is
required to be proved to bring home the charge against the accused. Similarly a
statement made by a person in any verification under the Act can be an offence under
Section 277 if the person making the same either knew or believed the same to be
false or did not believe to be true. Necessary mens rea, therefore, is required to be
established by the prosecution to attract the provisions of Section 277. We see
nothing in Section 132(4-A) which would establish the ingredients of the aforesaid
two criminal offences contemplated under Sections 276-C and 277 of the Indian
Income Tax Act. It may be noticed at this point of time that the Tribunal, while
interfering with the penalty imposed under Section 271(1-C) of the Act came to a
positive finding that there is no act of concealment on the part of the assessee and he
had returned the income on estimate basis. The Tribunal further found that it is a
case purely on difference of opinion as to the estimates and not a case of concealment
of income or even furnishing of inaccurate particulars of income."
(Emphasis supplied) The interpretation is to the same effect. The Apex Court holds that willful
attempt to evade tax, penalty or interest chargeable should (1999) 5 SCC 241 be a positive act on the
part of the accused which is required to be proved to bring home the charge against the accused. The
Apex Court in the case of UNION OF INDIA V. DHARAMENDRA TEXTILE PROCESSORS 3 has
held as follows:
".... ....
17. It is of significance to note that the conceptual and contextual difference between
Section 271(1)(c) and Section 276-C of the IT Act was lost sight of in Dilip Shroff case
[(2007) 6 SCC 329 : (2007) 8 Scale 304] .
18. The Explanations appended to Section 271(1)(c) of the IT Act entirely indicates
the element of strict liability on the assessee for concealment or for giving inaccurate
particulars while filing return. The judgment in Dilip N. Shroff case [(2007) 6 SCC
329 : (2007) 8 Scale 304] has not considered the effect and relevance of Section
276-C of the IT Act. Object behind enactment of Section 271(1)(c) read with
Explanations indicate that the said section has been enacted to provide for a remedy
for loss of revenue. The penalty under that provision is a civil liability. Wilful
concealment is not an essential ingredient for attracting civil liability as is the case in
the matter of prosecution under Section 276-C of the IT Act."
(Emphasis supplied) It is also to the same effect. The Apex Court, later, in the case of
COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX, AHMEDABAD v. RELIANCE PETROPRODUCTS PRIVATE
LIMITED 4 has held as follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158937996/ 19
Karan Bagaria vs The Income Tax Department on 20 December, 2023
".... .... .... ....
(2008) 13 SCC 369
(2010) 11 SCC 762
15. It was only on the point of mens rea that the judgment in Dilip N. Shroff v. CIT [(2007) 6 SCC
329] was upset. In Union of India v. Dharamendra Textile Processors [(2008) 13 SCC 369] after
quoting from Section 271 extensively and also considering Section 271(1)(c), the Court came to the
conclusion that since Section 271(1)(c) indicated the element of strict liability on the assessee for the
concealment or for giving inaccurate particulars while filing return, there was no necessity of mens
rea. The Court went on to hold that the objective behind enactment of Section 271(1)(c) read with
the Explanations indicated with the said section was for providing remedy for loss of revenue and
such a penalty was a civil liability and, therefore, wilful concealment is not an essential ingredient
for attracting civil liability as was the case in the matter of prosecution under Section 276-C of the
Act. The basic reason why the decision in Dilip N. Shroff v. CIT [(2007) 6 SCC 329] was overruled by
this Court in Union of India v. Dharamendra Textile Processors [(2008) 13 SCC 369] was that
according to this Court the effect and difference between Section 271(1)(c) and Section 276-C of the
Act was lost sight of in Dilip N. Shroff v. CIT [(2007) 6 SCC 329] .
.... .... .... ....
18. We must hasten to add here that in this case, there is no finding that any details supplied by the
assessee in its return were found to be incorrect or erroneous or false. Such not being the case, there
would be no question of inviting the penalty under Section 271(1)(c) of the Act. A mere making of
the claim, which is not sustainable in law, by itself, will not amount to furnishing inaccurate
particulars regarding the income of the assessee. Such claim made in the return cannot amount to
inaccurate particulars.
19. It was tried to be suggested that Section 14-A of the Act specifically excluded the deductions in
respect of the expenditure incurred by the assessee in relation to income which does not form part of
the total income under the Act. It was further pointed out that the dividends from the shares did not
form part of the total income. It was, therefore, reiterated before us that the assessing officer had
correctly reached the conclusion that since the assessee had claimed excessive deductions knowing
that they are incorrect; it amounted to concealment of income. It was tried to be argued that the
falsehood in accounts can take either of the two forms; (i) an item of receipt may be suppressed
fraudulently; (ii) an item of expenditure may be falsely (or in an exaggerated amount) claimed, and
both types attempt to reduce the taxable income and, therefore, both types amount to concealment
of particulars of one's income as well as furnishing of inaccurate particulars of income.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158937996/ 20
Karan Bagaria vs The Income Tax Department on 20 December, 2023
20. We do not agree, as the assessee had furnished all the details of its expenditure as well as income
in its return, which details, in themselves, were not found to be inaccurate nor could be viewed as
the concealment of income on its part. It was up to the authorities to accept its claim in the return or
not. Merely because the assessee had claimed the expenditure, which claim was not accepted or was
not acceptable to the Revenue, that by itself would not, in our opinion, attract the penalty under
Section 271(1)(c). If we accept the contention of the Revenue then in case of every return where the
claim made is not accepted by the assessing officer for any reason, the assessee will invite penalty
under Section 271(1)(c). That is clearly not the intendment of the legislature."
(Emphasis supplied) The Apex Court again holds that mens rea is an element that is to be present in
a proceeding under Section 271 of the Act. The mere fact of not accurate tax, not exact tax or
erroneous tax would not lead to the proceedings under Section 276 of the Act.
12. Following all the aforesaid judgments, a co-ordinate Bench of this Court in the case of M/S
VYALIKAVAL HOUSE BUILDING CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETY LIMITED v. INCOME TAX
DEPARTMENT5 has held as follows:
"2. The premises of petitioner No.1 was subjected to search and seizure under Section
132 of the Inconie Tax Act, 1961 (hereinafter referred to as the Act. for brevity) on
5.7.2011. Consequent to search, assessment proceedings came to be initiated by the
Assessing Officer by issuing a notice under Section 153A of the Act dated 27.9.2011
calling upon petitioner No.1 to file its returns of income for the assessment years
2006- 07 to 2011-12. Since there was no compliance of the aforesaid notice, the
Assessing Officer issued a show cause notice dated 31.7.2013 calling upon petitioner
No.1 as to why prosecution for the offence punishable under Section 276CC of the Act
could not be initiated. In response to the said show cause notice, petitioner No.1 filed
returns of income on 8.8.2013 for the assessment years 2010-11 and 2011-12. In the
said returns, petitioner No.1 declared the total income of Rs.3,49,93,300/- and the
total tax payable at Rs.10,54,420/- for the assessment year 2010-11 and income of
Rs.3,78,36,508/- and the tax payable thereon at Rs.1,03,88,310/- for the assessment
year 2011-12 respectively. Petitioner No.1 though filed returns, failed to pay the
self-assessment tax along with the return of income under Section 140A of the IT Act.
In the meanwhile, the property owned by petitioner No.1 was attached under Section
281B of the Act. The attachment was later lifted on condition that the sale proceeds of
the attached property would be directly remitted to the Department. Thereafter,
petitioner No.1 sent a cheque for Rs. 1,25,00,000 towards self-assessment tax due for
the assessment years 2010-11 and 2011-12. On the back of the said cheque, it was
instructed that "cheque to be presented at the time of registration of the property". In
view of this Instruction, Department did not encash the said cheque. Contending that
the petitioners have willfully and deliberately made an attempt to create
circumstances to enable them to evade payment of tax, a complaint was lodged before
the Court for Economic Offences, Bengaluru, seeking prosecution of the petitioners
for the offence punishable under Section Crl.P.No.4891 of 2014 c/w Crl.P.No.4892 of
2014 decided on 14-06-2019 276C(2) of the Act. The Special Court took cognizance of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158937996/ 21
Karan Bagaria vs The Income Tax Department on 20 December, 2023
the offence and issued summons to the petitioners. Aggrieved by the impugned
action, the petitioners have invoked the jurisdiction of this Court under Section 482
of Cr.P.C. seeking to quash the impugned proceedings.
.... .... .... ....
8. The gist of the offence under Section 276C(2) of the Act is the willful attempt to
evade any tax, penalty or interest chargeable or imposable under the Act. What is
made punishable under this Section is an "attempt to evade tax penalty or interest"
and not the actual evasion of tax. 'Attempt' is nowhere defined in the Act or in the
Indian Penal Code. In legal echelons 'attempt' is understood as a "movement towards
the commission of the intended crime". It is doing "something in the direction of
commission of offence".
Viewed in that sense, in order to render the accused guilty of "attempt to evade tax" it must be
shown that he has done some positive act with an Intention to evade tax.
9. In the instant case, the only circumstance relied on by the respondent in support of the charge
levelled against the petitioners is that, even though accused filed the returns, yet, it failed to pay the
self- assessment tax along with the returns. This circumstance even if accepted as true, the same
does not constitute the offence under Section 276C (2) of the Act. The act of filing the returns by
itself cannot be construed as an attempt to evade tax, rather the submission of the returns would
suggest that petitioner No.1 had voluntarily declared his intention to pay tax. The act of submitting
returns is not connected with the evasion of tax. It is only an act which is closely connected with the
intended crirne, that can be construed as an act in attempt of the intended offence. In the backdrop
of this legal principle, the Hon'bie Supreme Court in the case of Prem Dass-vs-Income Tax Officer
cited supra, has held that a positive act on the part of the accused is required to be established to
bring home the charge against the accused for the offence under Section 276C(2) of the Act."
(Emphasis supplied) The co-ordinate Bench holds the act of the assessee to evade tax should be
palpable and demonstrable. The intention should be clearly to evade tax. Following the judgment of
the Apex Court in the case of PREM DASS (supra) the co-ordinate Bench holds that there was no
mens rea, as tax was immediately paid. It was a erroneous calculation of tax which cannot be
attracted in a case of the kind. The order in the case of VYALIKAVAL HOUSE BUILDING
CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETY LIMITED has been followed in a subsequent judgment by another
co-ordinate Bench of this Court in the case of M/S CONFIDENT PROJECTS (INDIA) PRIVATE
LIMITED v. INCOME TAX DEPARTMENT6. The issues framed by the co-ordinate Bench which are
germane for consideration of issues raised in the lis are as follows:
"(1) ... ... ...
(3) Whether the delayed payment of income tax would
amount to evasion of tax or not?
... ... ...
(5) Whether the order of cognizance by the Economic
Offences Court is proper and correct?
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158937996/ 22
Karan Bagaria vs The Income Tax Department on 20 December, 2023
... ... ..."
Crl.P.No.5480 of 2016 c/w 5481 of 2016 decided on 28-01-2021 The co-ordinate Bench answers the
said issues as follows:
".... ...
10. Answer to Point No.3: Whether the delayed payment of Income Tax would amount to evasion of
tax or not?
10.1. This question is no longer res integra inasmuch as this Court in Crl.P No.4891/2014
(Vyalikaval's case) has held that delayed payment of income tax would not amount to evasion of tax.
Applying the same principle to the present fact situation, the delay caused by the
petitioner-Company in making payment of the income tax cannot be said to be evasion.
10.2. The fact remains that income tax has been paid and the authorities have received the necessary
taxes. If at all, for the said delay, there could be an interest component which could have been
levied.
10.3. Hence, I answer Point No.3 by holding that delayed payment of Income Tax would not amount
to evasion of tax, so long as there is payment of tax, more so for the reason that in the returns is an
there filed acknowledgement of tax due to be paid."
(Emphasis supplied) What would unmistakably emerge from a coalesce of the judgments rendered
by the Apex Court and that of this Court is that, in such cases what is necessary to be present is mens
rea. Incorrect claim or erroneous claim would not amount to willful evasion. Erroneous claim in
certain circumstances can be erroneous interpretation of law.
13. On the bedrock of the principles laid down in the afore-
quoted judgments, the case at hand requires to be noticed. The offence alleged against each of the
petitioners is as afore-quoted.
The defence of the petitioners is that they had sold certain shares of Tuni Textiles and earned long
term capital gains amounting to certain amounts all through banking transactions with the stock
brokers in relation to the advice the stock brokers had rendered.
The stocks vary from JMD Telefilm Industries, Splash Media, Essar India and Alpha. Trading is
both by the individuals and by the companies. But, the moment it is brought to the notice of all these
petitioners, retracing of steps immediately happen by filing of revised returns. Therefore, it is not a
case where ipso facto evasion of tax can be laid against these petitioners. The facts in the case are
akin to what is considered by the Apex Court and co-ordinate Benches of this Court in the aforesaid
cases. These cases would become cases where it would amount to delayed payment of tax as revised

returns are filed after the search is conducted on the petitioners. The judgments rendered by the
co-ordinate Benches in the cases of M/s VYALIKAVAL HOUSE BUILDING CO-
OPERATIVE SOCIETY LIMITED and M/s CONFIDENT PROJECTS (INDIA) PRIVATE LIMITED
were tossed by the revenue before the Apex Court and both of which have been dismissed. These are
admitted facts. Therefore, in the light of all the issues standing answered by plethora of judgments
quoted hereinabove, the proceedings instituted against the petitioners cannot but be termed to be
an error in law.
14. The other submission is with regard to the order of the learned Magistrate taking cognizance of
the offence. The order taking cognizance reads as follows:
"Complainant present, perused complaint and connected papers, sufficient materials
placed to proceed against the Accused for the offence punishable under Section
276C(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Accordingly "Cognizance is taken". Office is
hereby directed to register the case against Accused in III register and issue A/s to
Accused R/by 6-10-2016".
All that the order reads is complainant present and perused complaint. Sufficient materials are
placed to proceed against the accused for offence punishable under Section 276C(1) of the Act.
Accordingly, cognizance is taken and a criminal case is directed to be registered. Whether this would
be sufficient in law also need not detain this Court for long or delve deep into the matter. The order
of cognizance is trite, that it sets the criminal law in motion and brings the accused under the
umbrella of crime. The co-ordinate Bench in the case of M/s. CONFIDENT PROJECTS (INDIA)
PVT LTD., has framed a specific issue on an identical order of taking of cognizance and has
answered it as follows:
"12. Answer to Point No.5: Whether the order of cognizance by the Economic
Offences Court is proper and correct?
12.1. The order of cognizance in both cases is identical and is extracted below:-
"Perused Complaint and Connected papers, materials placed proceed against the A-1
to 8 to take Cognizance. Hence "Cognizance" taken for the offence P/U/Sec 276c(2)
and 277 R/W/S. 2788 of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Register the case as C.C. in 3
register and issue Accused Summons to accused No.1 to 8 through RPAD If RPAD
charges paid R/by-27-05-2016".
12.2. Shri Vivek Holla, learned counsel for the petitioners has contended that the Court taking
Cognisance is required to apply its mind while taking Cognisance, the above order passed does not
indicate such application of mind as such the order of Cognisance is to be set aside.

Karan Bagaria vs The Income Tax Department on 20 December, 2023
12.3. The Hon'ble Apex Court as also this Court in a catena of decisions has categorically held that
the court taking Cognisance is required to apply its mind to the allegations made and the applicable
statute and thereafter pass a reasoned order in writing taking Cognisance, which should be apparent
from a reading of the order of Cognisance to indicate that the requirement of "sufficient grounds for
proceedings" in terms of Section 204 of the code has been complied with.
12.4. At the time of taking Cognisance, there must be a proper application of judicial mind to the
materials before the said Court either oral or documentary, as well as any other information that
might have been submitted or made available to the Court.
12.5. The test that is required to be applied by the Court while taking Cognisance is as to whether on
the basis of the allegations made in the Complaint or on a police report or on information furnished
by a person other than a police officer, is there a case made out for initiation of criminal
proceedings.
12.6. For the above purpose, there is an assessment of the allegations required to be made applying
the law to the facts and thereby arriving at a conclusion by a process of reasoning that Cognisance is
required to be taken.
12.7. An order of Cognisance cannot be abridged, formatted or formulaic. The said order has to
make out that there is a judicial application of mind. Since without such application, the same may
result in the initiation of criminal proceedings when it was not required to be so done.
12.8. The order of taking Cognisance is a safeguard inbuilt in the criminal justice system as so to
avoid malicious prosecution and/or frivolous complaints.
12.9. When a complaint or a police report or information by a person other than police officer is
placed before the Court, the judicial officer must apply judicious mind coupled with discretion which
is not to be exercised in an arbitrary, capricious, whimsical, fanciful or casual way.
12.10. Any offence alleged being one of commission or omission attracting penal statutes;
Cognisance can be taken only if the allegations made fulfil the basic requirement of the said penal
provision. At this point, it is not required for the Court taking Cognisance to ascertain the truth or
veracity of the allegation but only to appreciate if the allegations taken at face value, would amount
to the offence complained of or not. If Yes, Cognisance could be taken, if No, taking Cognisance
could be refused. The only manner of ascertaining the above is by the manner of recordal made by
the Court in the order taking Cognisance. The order passed by the court taking Cognisance would
therefore reflect such application of mind to the factual situation 12.11. In the above background the
order passed by the Magistrate does not indicate any such consideration by the Magistrate.
12.12. It can be ex facie seen that the order of the Magistrate does not satisfy the requirement of
arriving at a prima facie conclusion to take Cognisance and issue process let alone to the accused
residing outside the Jurisdiction of the said Magistrate.

12.13. Mere reference to the provisions in respect of which offences are alleged to have been
committed would not be in compliance with the aforesaid requirement of the statutes as also the
various decisions of the Honb'le Apex Court extracted hereinabove.
12.14. When there are multiple accused, the order is required to disclose the application of mind by
the Court taking Cognisance as regards each accused.
12.15. The Court taking Cognisance ought to have referred to and recorded the reasons why the said
Court believes that an offence is made out so as to take Cognisance more so on account of the fact
that it is on taking Cognisance that the criminal law is set in motion insofar as accused is concerned
and there may be several cases and instances where if the Court taking Cognisance were to apply its
mind, the Complaint may not even be considered by the said Court taking Cognisance let alone
taking Cognisance and issuance of Summons.
12.16. In view of the above, I am of the considered opinion that the order dated 29.03.2016 taking
Cognisance is not in compilance with applicable law and therefore is set aside.
12.17. I answer Point No.5 by holding that the order of Cognisance dated 29.03.2016 in both matters
is not in compliance with the requirement of Section 191(1)(a) of the Cr.P.C and further does not
indicate the procedure under Section 204 of Cr.P.C having been followed. At the time of taking
Cognisance and issuance of process, the Court taking Cognisance is required to pass a sufficiently
detailed order to support the conclusion to take Cognisance and issue process, in terms of the
discussion above. The judicious application of mind to the law and facts of the matter, should be
apparent on the ex-facie reading of the order of Cognisance."
(Emphasis supplied) In the light of the law so laid down by the co-ordinate Bench, which in fact
follows the earlier judgments of the Apex Court, an identical order of taking cognizance which forms
the fulcrum of cases at hand would also be rendered illegal. As observed hereinabove, the judgment
of the co-ordinate Bench in the case of M/s CONFIDENT PROJECTS (INDIA) PVT LTD., was tossed
before the Apex Court by the revenue unsuccessfully, except in regard to findings under Section 202
of the CrPC. The order of the Apex Court passed in Special Leave to Appeal (Crl.) No.8316 of 2021
dated 13-12-2021 reads as follows:
"In view of the peculiar facts of the present case, we are not inclined to interfere with
the impugned order and hence the special leave petition is dismissed. The dismissal
of the special leave petition would not be construed as approval of the observations
made in the impugned judgment in re. Section 202 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973. Neither the dismissal nor the findings recorded in the impugned
order reflect on other proceedings under the Income Tax Act, 1961."
The Apex Court affirms all the findings in the judgment except with regard to Section 202 of the
CrPC. Section 202 CrPC is not the ground that is set out in the cases at hand. Therefore, even with
regard to the order of taking cognizance suffering from non-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158937996/ 26
Karan Bagaria vs The Income Tax Department on 20 December, 2023
application of mind, the judgment of the co-ordinate Bench would cover the issue.
15. With these issues resulting in annulment of proceedings before the concerned Court, the other
issues raised as to whether the criminal proceedings should await the assessment proceedings or the
other way round, need not be gone into.
16. For the aforesaid reasons, I pass the following:
ORDER
(i) All Criminal Petitions are allowed.
(ii) Proceedings pending before the Special Court (Economic Offences) Bengaluru in
C.C.Nos. 221 to 225 of 2016 and C.C.Nos.324 to 328 of 2016 concerned in these cases
stand quashed.
(iii) It is made clear that the finding rendered herein is only for the purpose of
consideration of the case of the petitioners under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. It will not
influence or bind any other proceedings pending against the petitioners.
