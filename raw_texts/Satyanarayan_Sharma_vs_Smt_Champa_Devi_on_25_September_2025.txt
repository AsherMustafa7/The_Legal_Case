CAV JUDGMENT
Date : 25-09-2025
Heard learned counsel on behalf of petitioners
and learned counsel for the respondents.
2. The present Civil revision has been filed
against the order dated 12.04.2002 passed by learned Court of
Munsif II, Munger in Eviction case No. 01 of 2016 whereby and
where under petition under order 7 rule 11 filed by the

Satyanarayan Sharma vs Smt. Champa Devi on 25 September, 2025
petitioners has been rejected.
3. Learned Counsel for the Petitioners submitted
that the learned trial court committed illegality in refusing the
application for rejection of plaint under order VII rule 11 of
CPC, the impugned order is illegal, improper and against the
mandatory provisions of law and is liable to set aside. The
learned trial court failed to appreciate that plaintiff has got no
valid cause of action for the suit on the basis of averments
contained in the plaint as the plaintiff case is vexatious,
meritless and completely based on irrelevant statements and
frivolous facts thus the plaint ought to have been rejected under
order-VII Rule-II (a) and order VII Rule (a) of code of civil
procedure .
3.i. He further submitted that suit is barred under
Section 54 of Transfer of Property Act, 1882 and Section 17 of
Registration Act, 1908. He relied on the judgment of Apex
Court in the case of Suraj Lamp and Industries Pvt.Ltd v State
of Haryana and anr Air 2012 SC 206
Section 54 of TP Act makes it
clear that a contract of sale, that is, an
agreement of sale does not, of itself, create
any interest in or charge on such property.
This Court in Narandas Karsondas v. S.A.
Kamtam and Anr.
(1977) 3 SCC 247, observed:

Satyanarayan Sharma vs Smt. Champa Devi on 25 September, 2025
A contract of sale does not of
itself create any interest in, or charge on, the
property. This is expressly declared in
Section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act.
See Rambaran Prosad v. Ram Mohit Hazra
[1967]1 SCR
293. The fiduciary character
of the personal obligation created by a
contract for sale is recognised in Section 3
of the Specific Relief Act, 1963, and in
Section 91 of the Trusts Act. The personal
obligation created by a contract of sale is
described in Section 40 of the Transfer of
Property Act as an obligation arising out of
contract and annexed to the ownership of
property, but not amounting to an interest or
easement therein."
In India, the word `transfer'
is defined with reference to the word
`convey'. The word `conveys' in section 5 of
Transfer of Property Act is used in the wider
sense of conveying ownership... ...that only
on execution of conveyance ownership
passes from one party to another...."

only on execution of conveyance ownership

In Rambhau Namdeo
Gajre v. Narayan Bapuji Dhotra [2004 (8)
SCC 614] this Court held:
"Protection provided
Patna High Court C.R. No.35 of 2022 dt.25-09-2025
4/12
under Section 53A of the Act to the proposed
transferee is a shield only against the
transferor. It disentitles the transferor from
disturbing the possession of the proposed
transferee who is put in possession in
pursuance to such an agreement. It has
nothing to do with the ownership of the
proposed transferor who remains full owner
of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146030707/ 3
Satyanarayan Sharma vs Smt. Champa Devi on 25 September, 2025
property till it is legally
conveyed by executing a registered sale deed
in favour of the transferee. Such a right to
protect possession against the proposed
vendor cannot be pressed in service against
a third party."
It is thus clear that a
transfer of immovable property by way of
sale can only be by a deed of conveyance
(sale deed). In the absence of a deed of
conveyance (duly stamped and registered as
required by law), no right, title or interest in
an immoveable property can be transferred.
12. "Any contract of
sale (agreement to sell) which is not a
registered deed of conveyance (deed of sale)
would fall short of the requirements of
sections 54 and 55 of TP Act and will not
confer any title nor transfer any interest in
an immovable property (except to the limited
right granted under section 53A of TP Act).
According to TP Act, an agreement of sale,
whether with possession or without
possession, is not a conveyance. Section 54
of TP Act enacts that sale of immoveable
property can be made only by a registered
instrument and an agreement of sale does
not create any interest or charge on its
subject matter".
3.ii He further submitted that agreement to sale
Patna High Court C.R. No.35 of 2022 dt.25-09-2025
5/12
does not create right title and interest in the immovable property
in the instant case the plaintiffs are neither receiving the rent nor
they are entitled to receive the rent. He further submitted that
the existence of relationship of landlord and tenant is sine qua
non for granting relief under Bihar Building (Lease Rent and
Eviction) Control Act, 1982, for this he relied on the judgment
of Apex Court in the case of Rajendra Tiwary v Basudeo
Prasad and anr AIR 2002 SC 136. He further submitted that the
instant revision application is fit to be allowed and plaint is fit to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146030707/ 4
Satyanarayan Sharma vs Smt. Champa Devi on 25 September, 2025
be rejected.
4. Learned counsel for the Plaintiffs/Opposite
parties submitted that it is an admitted fact that
defendant/petitioner was tenant of the suit premises on monthly
rent of Rs.500/- and defendant/petitioner has paid monthly rent
up to May, 2013 and plaintiff No. 1/Opposite party No.1
appointed to plaintiff No.2/ Opposite party No.2 as attorney on
29.12.2014
for collecting rent from the suit premises and for other different purpose, but defendant evaded to
pay the rent from June, 2013, hence aforesaid eviction suit filed against the petitioner.
4.i He further submitted that in para 8 of Bhau Ram v. Janak Singh, AIR 2012 SC 3023 the Hon'ble
Apex Patna High Court C.R. No.35 of 2022 dt.25-09-2025 Court held that;
The law has been settled by this court in various decisions that while considering an application
under order VII Rule 11 CPC the court has to examine the averments in the plaint and the pleas
taken by the defendant in its written statement would be irrelevant, a cause of action is disclosed or
the averments appear to be such that none of the grounds under Order VII Rule 11 CPC are found
applicable, there can be no question of the rejection of the plaint.
4.ii. He further submitted that a cause of action related to received consideration for land generally
arises when a right to sue first accrues, which is typically the date of receipt of money or when a
right to recover that money is denied or revived, subject to the Limitation Act, 1963. he further
submitted that Learned trial court has rightly passed the order, which is according settled rule, thus
the application under order VII rule 11 is fit to be rejected.
5. The scope of Order VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure has been explained in various
decisions and the legal principles deducible. The material to be considered for rejecting the plaint
has been dealt with in the case of Dahiben vs. Arvind Bhai Kalyanji Bhanusali reported in (2020)
SCC ONLINE 563 The Apex court has settled the principle and made the following observations:
Patna High Court C.R. No.35 of 2022 dt.25-09-2025 "12.6- At this stage, the pleas
taken by the defendant in the written statement and application for rejection of the
plaint on the merits, would be irrelevant, and cannot be adverted to, or taken into
consideration.
12.7- The test for exercising the power under Order VII Rule 11 is that if the
averments made in the plaint are taken entirety, in conjunction with the documents
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146030707/ 5
Satyanarayan Sharma vs Smt. Champa Devi on 25 September, 2025
relied upon, would the same result in a decree being passed".
"23.2. The remedy under Order7 Rule11 is an independent and special remedy,
wherein the Court is empowered to summarily dismiss a suit at the threshold,
without proceeding to record evidence, and conducting a trial, on the basis of the
evidence adduced, if it is satisfied that the action should be terminated on any of the
grounds contained in this provision.
23.3. The underlying object of Order 7 Rule 11 (a) is that if in a suit, no cause of action
is disclosed, or the suit is barred by limitation under Rule 11(d), the Court would not
permit the plaintiff to unnecessarily protract the proceedings in the suit. In such a
case, it would be necessary to put an end to the sham litigation, so that further
judicial time is not wasted.
23.4. In Azhar Hussain v.
Rajiv Gandhi, 1986 Supp. SCC 315 this Court held that the whole purpose of
conferment of powers under this provision is to ensure that a litigation which is
meaningless, and bound to prove abortive, should not be permitted to waste judicial
time of the court, in the following words : Patna High Court C.R. No.35 of 2022
dt.25-09-2025 (SCC p.324, para 12) "12. ...The whole purpose of conferment of such
power is to ensure that a litigation which is meaningless, and bound to prove abortive
should not be permitted to occupy the time of the Court, and exercise the mind of the
respondent. The sword of Damocles need not be kept hanging over his head
unnecessarily without point or purpose. Even if an ordinary civil litigation, the Court
readily exercises the power to reject a plaint, if it does not disclose any cause of
action."
23.5. The power conferred on the court to terminate a civil action is, however, a drastic one, and the
conditions enumerated in Order 7 Rule 11 are required to be strictly adhered to.
23.6. Under Order 7 Rule 11, a duty is cast on the Court to determine whether the plaint discloses a
cause of action by scrutinizing the averments in the plaint [Liverpool & London S.P. & I Assn. Ltd. v.
M.V. Sea Success I, (2004) 9 SCC 512], read in conjunction with the documents relied upon, or
whether the suit is barred by any law.
23.9. In exercise of power under this provision, the Court would determine if the assertions made in
the plaint are contrary to statutory law, or judicial dicta, for deciding whether a case for rejecting the
plaint at the threshold is made out.
23.10. At this stage, the pleas taken by the defendant in the written statement and application for
rejection of the Patna High Court C.R. No.35 of 2022 dt.25-09-2025 plaint [Sopan Sukhdeo Sable
Vs. Charity Commr. (2004) 3 SCC 137] on the merits, would be irrelevant, and cannot be adverted
to, or taken into consideration.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146030707/ 6
Satyanarayan Sharma vs Smt. Champa Devi on 25 September, 2025
23.11. The test for exercising the power under Order VII Rule 11 is that if the averments made in the
plaint are taken in entirety, in conjunction with he documents relied upon, would the same result in
a decree being passed. This test was laid down in Liverpool & London S.P. & I Assn. Ltd. v. M.V. Sea
Success I & Anr., (2004) 9 SCC
512) which reads as:(SCC p.562, para 139) "139. Whether a plaint discloses a cause of action or not is
essentially a question of fact. But whether it does or does not must be found out from reading the
plaint itself. For the said purpose, the averments made in the plaint in their entirety must be held to
be correct. The test is as to whether if the averments made in the plaint are taken to be correct in
their entirety, a decree would be passed."
23.12. In Hardesh Ores (P.) Ltd. v. Hede & Co. (2007) 5 SCC 614 the Court further held that it is not
permissible to cull out a sentence or a passage, and to read it in isolation. It is the substance, and not
merely the form, which has to be looked into. The plaint has to be construed as it stands, without
addition or subtraction of words. If the allegations in the plaint prima facie show a cause of action,
the court cannot embark upon an enquiry whether the allegations are true in fact. D. Ramachandran
v. R.V. Janakiraman [D. Ramachandran v. R.V. Janakiraman, (1999) 3 SCC 267; See also Vijay
Pratap Singh Vs. Patna High Court C.R. No.35 of 2022 dt.25-09-2025 Dukh Haran Nath Singh, AIR
1962 SC 941].
23.13. If on a meaningful reading of the plaint, it is found that the suit is manifestly vexatious and
without any merit, and does not disclose a right to sue, the court would be justified in exercising the
power under Order VII Rule 11 CPC.
23.14. The power under Order VII Rule 11 CPC may be exercised by the Court at any stage of the
suit, either before registering the plaint, or after issuing summons to the defendant, or before
conclusion of the trial, as held by this Court in the judgment of Saleem Bhai v. State of Maharashtra
[Saleem Bhai v. State of Maharashtra, (2003)1 SCC 557]. The plea that once issues are framed, the
matter must necessarily go to trial was repelled by this Court in Azhar Hussain case [Azhar Hussain
v. Rajiv Gandhi ,1986 Supp SCC 315].
23.15. The provision of Order VII Rule 11is mandatory in nature. It states that the plaint "shall" be
rejected if any of the grounds specified in clause (a) to (e) are made out. If the Court finds that the
plaint does not disclose a cause of action, or that the suit is barred by any law, the Court has no
option, but to reject the plaint."
6. Accordingly, the Court must determine whether the plaint discloses a cause of action by
scrutinizing the averments in the plaint, read in conjunction with the documents relied upon, or
whether the suit is barred by any law.
7. The Hon'ble Apex Court in judgment dated 31.10.2023 in Kum. Geetha Vs. Nanjundaswamy &
Ors. Patna High Court C.R. No.35 of 2022 dt.25-09-2025 reported in 2023 SCC OnLine SC 1407
reiterated the aforesaid principle and observed in para 7 that in simple terms, the true test is first to
read the plaint meaningfully and as a whole, taking it to be true. Upon such reading, if the plaint
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146030707/ 7
Satyanarayan Sharma vs Smt. Champa Devi on 25 September, 2025
discloses a cause of action, then the application under Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC must fail. To put
it negatively, where it does not disclose a cause of action, the plaint shall be rejected.
8. In the present case, if the statements in the plaint are taken to be true, it cannot be said that it
does not disclose a cause of action and the plaint shall be rejected. This is a matter of trial, the result
of which would depend upon the evidence adduced by the plaintiff. At this stage, the Court is not
concerned with the correctness of the averments, except to state that the plaintiff has to discharge
the burden of proving his case.
Insofar as the application under Order VII Rule 11 of CPC is concerned, the court will proceed only
that far, to examine whether the plaint discloses a cause of action and no further.
9. From perusal of the plaint, it is clear fact that the petitioners had evaded to pay the rent for rented
premises since june 2013 to the landlord so, this fact itself create cause of action. The fact that
plaintiff / opposite party no.1 holding the title of ownership or not is the matter require deeply
evaluation Patna High Court C.R. No.35 of 2022 dt.25-09-2025 by further evidence which will have
to be adjudicated at the appropriate stage and appropriate forum after the parties adduce oral and
documentary evidence with respect to the particular point. Further the rent must be paid by the
tenant either to the landlord or to the person entitled to receive the rent on the behalf of landlord
but cannot evade his obligation of paying the rent for rented premises. Moreover the plain reading
of plaint suggest that the cause of action exist and the present case is not fit to be rejected as order
VII rule 11 of CPC will not apply.
10. In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances and the law discussed above, this Court does not
find any valid ground for interference in the impugned order of the trial court.
This Civil Revision is devoid of merit and is liable to be dismissed.
11. Accordingly, the present Civil Revision is dismissed.
