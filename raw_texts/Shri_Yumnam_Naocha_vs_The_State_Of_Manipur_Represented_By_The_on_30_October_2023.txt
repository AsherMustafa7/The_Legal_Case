Shri Yumnam Naocha vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 30 October, 2023
This petition has been filed by the petitioner under Section 389 Cr.P.C. praying to suspend the
judgment of conviction MC(Cril.Appeal) No. 2 of 2020(Ref:- Cril. Appeal No. 9 of 2020) Page |2
dated 26.11.2019 and the order of sentence dated 29.11.2019 passed by the learned Special Judge
(POCSO), Imphal East in Special Trial (POCSO) Case No.4 of 2017 and to release the petitioner on
bail during the pendency of the appeal.
2. The petitioner, who has been arrayed as an accused in Special Trial (POCSO) Case No.4 of 2017
on the file of the learned Special Judge (POCSO), Imphal East, was convicted under Section 6 of the
Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (for short, "the POCSO Act") by the judgment
dated 26.11.2019 and listed the case on 29.11.2019 for sentence hearing. On 29.11.2019, the
petitioner was produced before the learned Special Judge, Imphal East and after hearing the
petitioner and his counsel, the petitioner was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a
period of 12 years and to pay fine of Rs.10,000/- under Section 6 of POCSO Act and in default to
undergo three months simple imprisonment. The learned Special Judge also ordered that the said
fine amount if deposited, the same shall be given to the victim girl as compensation. That apart, the
learned Special Judge also recommended for provision of victim compensation to the tune of
Rs.5.00 lakh under Section 33(8) of POCSO Act to the victim. The learned Special Judge also
ordered the period which has already undergone by the MC(Cril.Appeal) No. 2 of 2020(Ref:- Cril.
Appeal No. 9 of 2020) Page |3 petitioner in the judicial custody during the period of investigation as
well as during the trial, if any, shall be set-off from the sentence awarded.
3. Aggrieved by the conviction and sentence imposed on the petitioner, the petitioner has filed
Criminal Appeal No.9 of 2020 before this Court. Along with the appeal, the petitioner has filed
petition seeking to suspend the sentence stating that he has a very good case on merits and is likely
to succeed in the appeal filed by him.
4. Mr. S. Bikash Sharma, the learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that there are lot of
infirmities in the impugned judgment and that the petitioner has got good case on merits to succeed.
He would submit that the petitioner is in jail since the date of arrest on 10.11.2016 which was about
6 years and 11 months and have to spend another about 5 years and 1 month in the jail. He would
submit that spending the time in the jail, there was no criminal record of the petitioner.
5. The learned counsel then submitted that release of the petitioner on bail by suspending the
sentence shall not cause any inconvenience or prejudice to the prosecution. Further, the petitioner's
parents are old aged and needs the assistance of the petitioner and his presence is highly necessary.
MC(Cril.Appeal) No. 2 of 2020(Ref:- Cril. Appeal No. 9 of 2020) Page |4
6. The learned counsel next submitted that the appeal would not be taken up for hearing in the near
future and therefore, the petitioner is entitled to suspension of sentence pending appeal and that the
petitioner undertakes to abide by the conditions imposed by this Court.
7. The learned counsel for the petitioner urged that detention of the petitioner during pendency of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/23529157/ 2
Shri Yumnam Naocha vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 30 October, 2023
the appeal is a severe punishment to all his family members and, thus, prayed for suspension of
sentence pending appeal. In support, the learned counsel placed reliance upon the judgment of the
Delhi High Court in the case of Pankaj Kumar Bhola v. Govt. of NCT of Delhi, 2023 Legal Eagle
(DEL) 91.
8. Per contra, Mr. H. Samarjit, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor submitted that the learned
Special Judge after examination of both sides and taking into consideration the material evidence
came to the conclusion that the prosecution has forced beyond reasonable doubt that the petitioner
had committed penetrative sexual assault to the victim girl and that the accused has failed to prove
even by preponderance of probability that he did not commit penetrative sexual assault and his plea
of alibi.
9. The learned Additional Public Prosecutor further submitted that the petitioner resides near the
victim in the same MC(Cril.Appeal) No. 2 of 2020(Ref:- Cril. Appeal No. 9 of 2020) Page |5 locality
and, if he is released on bail at this stage, the life and safety of the victim cannot be assured. The
objective of the POCSO Act is to protect the innocent young children. Thus, a prayer has been made
to reject the petition for suspension of sentence in the interest of justice and that the interest of the
victim whose life has been scarred and damaged beyond redemption as the stigma of being a victim
of sexual assault will remain for the remainder of her life.
10. This Court considered the rival submissions and also perused the materials available on record.
11. The petitioner was convicted under Section 6 of POCSO Act. Upon hearing the petitioner, the
learned Special Judge sentenced the petitioner to suffer rigorous imprisonment for a period of 12
years and to pay a sum of Rs.10,000/- as fine and in default of payment of fine, the convict shall
undergo simple imprisonment for a period of 3 months. The learned Special Judge also
recommended Rs.5 lakh as victim compensation in terms of "Compensation Scheme for Women
Victims/Survivors of Sexual Assault/other Crimes, 2018". The judgment of the trial Court is dated
26.11.2019 and sentence was imposed on 29.11.2019 and according to the petitioner, he was in jail
since from 10.11.2016 i.e. from the date of arrest.
MC(Cril.Appeal) No. 2 of 2020(Ref:- Cril. Appeal No. 9 of 2020) Page |6
12. As could be seen from the grounds of appeal, the petitioner has challenged the judgment of the
learned Special Judge on various grounds. The petitioner has raised a ground that the learned
Special Judge has failed to appreciate the oral testimony of the prosecution witnesses in proper
perspective and in view of lot of infirmities and lacuna in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses,
the conviction cannot stand.
13. The petitioner also raised a ground that the prosecution has failed to establish that the petitioner
is capable of performing sexual act by his examination by a competent doctor. In the absence of such
evidence, convicting the appellant under the impugned conviction is not called for. The learned
Special Judge failed to take into consideration the evidence of P.W.7- Doctor in proper perspective,
as his evidence is so clear that there is no sign of any sexual intercourse or assault to the victim.

Further, the statement of the victim when accepted as gospel truth does not fulfil the basic
ingredient of penetrative sexual assault as defined in Section 3 of the POCSO Act. When the
ingredient of penetrative sexual assault is not fulfilled, convicting the petitioner under Section 6 of
the Act is not called for.
14. It is settled that when a convicted person is sentenced to a fixed period of sentence and the
appellate Court MC(Cril.Appeal) No. 2 of 2020(Ref:- Cril. Appeal No. 9 of 2020) Page |7 finds that
due to practical reasons the appeal cannot be disposed of expeditiously, it can pass appropriate
orders for suspension of sentence.
15. In Pankaj Kumar Bhola, supra, the Delhi High Court held as under:
"10. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, as adverted to by the
counsel for the appellant where they may have substantial issues to press in their
appeal, but since the appeal is pending before this Court and will take time to be
heard and adjudicated upon; as also the fact that the appellant has already served
more than half of his sentence that too without having taken any interim bail; as also
he has no previous conviction and his jail conduct is satisfactory, in view of the
directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Sonadhar v. The State of Chhattisgarh,
SLP (Crl.) 529/2021 vide order dated 6th October, 2021, as well as Saudan Singh v.
State of Uttar Pradesh, 2021 SCC OnLine SC 3259 (where the Hon'ble Suprem Corut
has observed that in cases other than life sentence cases, the broad parameter of 50
per cent of actual sentence undergone can be the basis of grant of bail), this Court
deems it fir to suspend the sentence of the appellant."
MC(Cril.Appeal) No. 2 of 2020(Ref:- Cril. Appeal No. 9 of 2020) Page |8
16. The aforesaid decision of the Delhi High Court squarely applies to the case on hand, as the
petitioner is in jail from 10.11.2016 i.e. from the date of arrest. In other words, the petitioner is in jail
for a period of 6 years 11 months, which is more than the half of sentence imposed on him.
17. In Bhagwan Rama Shinde Gosai and others v. State of Gujarat, (1999) 4 SCC 421, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court held:
"3. When a convicted person is sentenced to a fixed period of sentence and when he
files an appeal under any statutory right, suspension of sentence can be considered by
the appellate court liberally unless there are exceptional circumstances. Of course, if
there is any statutory restriction against suspension of sentence it is a different
matter. Similarly, when the sentence is life imprisonment the consideration for
suspension of sentence could be of a different approach. But if for any reason the
sentence of a limited duration cannot be suspended every endeavour should be made
to dispose of the appeal on merits more so when a motion for expeditious hearing of
the appeal is made in such cases. Otherwise the very valuable right of appeal would
be an exercise in futility by efflux of time. When the appellate court finds that due to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/23529157/ 4
Shri Yumnam Naocha vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 30 October, 2023
practical reasons such appeals cannot be disposed of expeditiously the appellate
MC(Cril.Appeal) No. 2 of 2020(Ref:- Cril. Appeal No. 9 of 2020) Page |9 court must
bestow special concern in the matter of suspending the sentence, so as to make the
appeal right, meaningful and effective. Of course, appellate courts can impose similar
conditions when bail is granted."
18. In Union of India v. Ram Samujh and another, (1999) 9 SCC 429, the Hon'ble Apex Court held
that the jurisdiction of the Court to grant bail is circumscribed. The bail can be granted and sentence
suspended in a case where there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not guilty
of the offence for which he is convicted and he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail and
during the period of suspension of sentence.
19. In the instant case, the petitioner challenged the judgment of the trial Court on various grounds
as could be seen from the grounds of appeal and prima facie the petitioner has got arguable case.
This Court is not concerned with the merits of the appeal and the concern is only with regard to the
point whether the petitioner is entitled to suspension of sentence pending appeal.
20. As stated supra, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Bhagwan Rama Shinde Gosai (supra),
held that the prayer for suspension of sentence pending appeal should be considered liberally unless
there is any statutory restriction. MC(Cril.Appeal) No. 2 of 2020(Ref:- Cril. Appeal No. 9 of 2020) P
a g e | 10
21. Where an appeal is preferred against the conviction under Section 6 of the POCSO Act before the
High Court, the High Court has ample power and discretion to suspend the sentence. However, that
discretion has to be exercised judiciously depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case.
While considering the suspension of sentence, each case has to be considered on the basis of the
nature of the offence, the manner in which the occurrence had taken place, whether bail granted
earlier had been misused. There is no straitjacket formula which could be applied in exercising
discretion and the facts and circumstances of each case would govern the exercise of judicious
discretion while considering an application filed by a convict under Section 389 Cr.P.C.
22. When this Court analysed the instant case in the light of the settled principles, this Court is of
the view that the appeal is of the year 2020 and due to practical reasons, the appeal cannot be taken
up in the near future and disposed of expeditiously. According to the petitioner, the petitioner is in
jail from 10.11.2016 and the petitioner has spent considerable time in jail.
23. When an appellate Court is in seizin of an application for suspension of sentence with an
assertion that the convict has served half of the sentence, it can take into consideration his
MC(Cril.Appeal) No. 2 of 2020(Ref:- Cril. Appeal No. 9 of 2020) P a g e | 11 criminal antecedents. In
the instant case, no criminal record of the petitioner has been produced by the prosecution. The only
plea of the prosecution is that the petitioner resides near the victim in the same locality and if he is
released on bail, the life of the victim is danger. Merely because the petitioner is residing in the same
locality of the victim, the claim of bail cannot be rejected on the ground that the victim is residing in
the same locality.

24. As stated supra, the petitioner has spent considerable time i.e., nearly 6 years 11 months and
during that period no criminal antecedents has been shown by the prosecution.
25. In the light of the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Bhagwan Rama Shinde
Gosai (supra), and the fact remains that the present appeal would take substantial time to come up
for final hearing, without expressing any opinion on the merits of the appeal, this Court is inclined
to suspend the sentence imposed on the appellant, subject to stringent conditions.
26. Accordingly, the sentence imposed on the petitioner in Special Trial (POCSO) Case No.4 of 2017
dated 29.11.2019 on the file of the learned Special Judge (POCSO), Imphal East alone
MC(Cril.Appeal) No. 2 of 2020(Ref:- Cril. Appeal No. 9 of 2020) P a g e | 12 is suspended, subject to
the compliance of the following conditions by the petitioner:
(a) The petitioner is directed to be released on bail on his furnishing a personal bond
for Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand) with two sureties in the like sum to the
satisfaction of the learned Special Judge (POCSO), Imphal East.
(b) The petitioner shall provide permanent address to the learned Special Judge
(POCSO), Imphal East. The appellant shall intimate the Court by way of an affidavit
and to the Investigating Officer regarding any change in residential address.
(c) The petitioner, on his being enlarged on bail, is directed to report before the
learned Special Judge (POCSO), Imphal East on the first working day of every month
at 10.00 A.M. without fail.
(d) The petitioner is directed to appear before this Court on all hearing dates.
(e) The petitioner shall not indulge in any criminal activities during the period of
suspension of sentence. He shall not communicate with or come in contact with the
victim or any member of the victim's family or tamper with the evidence of the case.
MC(Cril.Appeal) No. 2 of 2020(Ref:- Cril. Appeal No. 9 of 2020) P a g e | 13
(f) The petitioner shall not leave the jurisdiction of the Court and shall ordinarily reside at a place of
his residence.
(g) The petitioner shall provide all mobile numbers to the Investigating Officer concerned which
shall be kept in working condition at all times and shall not switch off or change the mobile number
without prior intimation to the Investigating Officer concerned. The mobile location be kept on at all
times.
(h) In case of violation of any condition, the prosecution may ask for cancellation of bail.

(g) Needless to state, any observation touching the merits of the case is purely for the purposes of
deciding the question of suspension of sentence and shall not be construed as an expression on
merits of the matter.
27. Accordingly, MC (Crl. Appeal) No.2 of 2020 in Criminal Appeal No.9 of 2020 is allowed.
