COMMON ORDER
These writ petitions have been filed challenging the impugned orders dated 15.04.2024 and the
consequential impugned notices dated 15.04.2024 issued by the 1st respondent.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc.
2. Submission made by the learned counsel for the petitioner:
2.1 Ms.G.Vardhini Karthik, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner would
submit that the present writ petitions were filed challenging the jurisdiction of the
Jurisdictional Assessment Officer (JAO) to issue notice under Section 148 of the
Income Tax Act, 1961 (hereinafter called as “IT Act”). Initially, she would submit that
the JAO will not have any power to issue any notice under Section 148 subsequent to
the incorporation of Section 151A of the IT Act and introduction of two Schemes, viz.,
“E-Assessment of Income Escaping Assessment Scheme, 2022, dated 29.03.2022”
and “Faceless Jurisdiction of Income-tax Authorities Scheme, 2022, dated
28.03.2022” (hereinafter called as “Scheme”).
2.2 She would submit that the aforesaid Schemes were brought in, in terms of the
provisions of Section 151A of the IT Act, which enables the Central Government to
bring in a Scheme to conduct assessment, re-
assessment or re-computation in faceless manner. Accordingly, the aforesaid two Schemes were
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/36406891/ 2
Mark Studio India Private Limited vs Income Tax Officer on 20 December, 2024
brought in by the Central Government. Once if https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of
2024 etc. such Scheme was brought in to conduct assessment, re-assessment or re-
computation under Section 147 of the IT Act in faceless manner, the JAO will have no role to play
and all the process has to be carried out only by Faceless Assessment Officer (FAO). In the present
case, Scheme was introduced for conducting assessment, re-assessment or re-computation under
Section 147 of the IT Act and for issuance of notice under Section 148 of the IT Act. Hence, by
referring the Scheme, she would contend that Section 148 or 148A notices shall be issued only by
NaFAC. However, in this case, the impugned notices were issued by JAO, by mentioning his name.
Thus, she would submit that the said impugned notices were issued without any jurisdiction and the
same is liable to be quashed.
2.3 Further, she would submit that the re-assessment procedure would only commence when the
notice under Section 148A/148 of the IT Act is issued calling for the return of income and that is
why, Section 144B of the IT Act does not refer to Section 148 notice. In the Scheme dated
29.03.2022, it has been specifically directed to issue the Section 148 notice in faceless manner.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc. 2.4 After the issuance of Section 148
notice, the Assessee shall be permitted to file their returns. On the other hand, if any assessee had
intended to file the return of income voluntarily upon receipt of show cause notice, it would be
impossible since the portal would not be upon for him to file his returns at that stage.
2.5 By referring the Scheme dated 29.03.2022, she would submit that the said Scheme was issued
only in the nature of guidelines for internal circulation.
2.6 Therefore, she would strongly contend that there is no concurrent jurisdiction for JAO as well as
FAO for issuance of notice under Section 148 or 148A for making assessment under Section 147 of
the IT Act and only the FAO will have the authority to issue such notice in faceless manner.
2.7 She would also submit that she has filed her return submissions and insisted this Court to take
the same into consideration and pass appropriate orders.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc. 2.8 For all these reasons, she would
submit that the show cause notices issued by the respondent are liable to be quashed. In support of
her contentions, she referred the following judgements:
i) the judgment of the Telangana High Court in Kankanala Ravindra Reddy vs.
Income-Tax Officer reported in (2023) 156 taxmann.com 178 (TELANGANA).
ii) the judgment of the Hon'ble Bombay High Court in Hexaware Technologies
Limited vz. Asistant Commissioner of Income Tax and others reported in 2024 SCC
OnLine Bom 1249.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/36406891/ 3
Mark Studio India Private Limited vs Income Tax Officer on 20 December, 2024
iii) the judgment of the Hon'ble Gujarat High Court in Talati and Talati LLP vs. Office
of Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax reported in 2024: GUJHC: 54567-DB.
3. Submissions made by the learned Senior Standing counsel for the respondent:
3.1 Dr.B.Ramaswamy, learned Senior Standing counsel, has strongly opposed the
submissions made by the learned counsel for the petitioner and would submit that
the Scheme as well as the provisions of Section 144B had explicitly provide that the
JAO will have the jurisdiction in the process of issuing the notice under Section 148
and 148A of the IT Act.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc. 3.2 By referring the Scheme, he has
made an elaborate submissions on the aspect of Automated Allocation System based on the risk
management strategy formulated by the Board from time to time to the extent provided in Section
148 of the IT Act and also as to how the notices were sent in faceless manner.
3.3 Further, he referred the impugned notices and would submit that the impugned show cause
notices were not served physically. The cases were selected by the Directorate of Income Tax
(Systems) through Automated Allocation System based on the risk management strategy formulated
under Section 148 of the IT Act and thereafter, the same was forwarded to the JAO based on the
PAN card jurisdiction and the said JAO will have no role to play in selection of cases. Subsequently,
the notices have been sent to the e-mail id of the registered account of the assessee through the web
portal of ITBA. Hence, he would submit that the impugned notices have been sent by the
respondents in faceless manner.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc. 3.4 Further, he would submit that in
terms of the provisions of the Scheme, three requirements have to be complied with for issuance of
notice under Section 148 of the IT Act:
i) Automated Allocation System
ii) Risk management strategy formulated by the Board as referred to in section 148 of
the Act.
iii) Faceless manner.
3.5 In this case, all the aforesaid three requirements have been duly complied with while sending the
impugned notice. Therefore, at no stretch of imagination, one could say that the notices have been
sent in any manner, other than the faceless manner.
3.6 By referring the guidelines dated 24.05.2023, he would submit that in terms of the power
available under Section 144B(2) of the IT Act, the Board has been specifically excluded the cases of
international taxation, central circle charges and also for search and seizure from the purview of the
faceless assessment. Further, he would submit that the said guidelines had prescribed the manner as
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/36406891/ 4
Mark Studio India Private Limited vs Income Tax Officer on 20 December, 2024
to how the JAO has to collect reply, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc.
information and documents subsequent to the issuance of Section 148 notice and upload the same
on the ITBA portal for the access by NaFAC. After uploading the Section 148 notice along with the
relevant documents, which were collected by the JAO, the Directorate of Income Tax (Systems) shall
forward the cases to the NaFAC. Subsequently, the NaFAC shall issue notice, under Section 143(2)
or 142(1) of the IT Act, in appropriate cases in terms of Clause (iii) of Sub-Section (1) of Section 144B
of the IT Act.
3.7 Therefore, he would contend that in the process of assessment, re-
assessment or re-computation under Section 147 of the IT Act by the NaFAC, the FAO would come
into picture only from the stage of issuance of notice under Section 143(2) or 142(1) of the IT Act
and allocation of cases by NaFAC to the assessment unit, subsequent to the receipt of information
from the Directorate of Income Tax (Systems). Therefore, he would contend that the Board had
issued the guidelines within the power available to them under Section 144B(2) of the IT Act.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc. 3.8 Further, by referring Clause (iv)
of Sub-Section (1) of Section 144B of the IT Act, he would submit that if any additional information
is required, after the allotment of Section 148 cases along with the documents to the respective
assessment units by virtue of Automated Allocation System by NaFAC, the concerned assessment
unit shall request the NaFAC to send notice to get additional information from the Assessee. By
referring the word “additional information”, he would submit that at the time of allotment , Section
148 notice and its reply and Section 148A notice and its reply along with all the other documents will
be made available with the concerned assessment unit, by the NaFAC. Therefore, Section 144B
makes it very clear that the proceedings at NaFAC level would commence only from the stage of
issuance of notice under Section 142(1) or 143(2) of the IT Act. Before the said stage, only JAO will
have power to issue Section 148/148A notice. Thereafter, the Directorate of Income Tax (Systems)
shall forward these cases to NaFAC to take further action. The guidelines has been issued by the
Board on this aspect elaborately.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc. 3.9 He would also contend that the
said guidelines had been issued by the Board, within the power available to them under Section
144B of the IT Act, without touching upon the Scheme and issuance of such guidelines will not
amount to making exemptions, modification or alteration in the Scheme.
Hence, he would submit that the power of Central Government to bring any modification and
alteration to the Scheme is entirely different from the notification brought in by the Board through
guidelines, which was issued in terms of the provisions of Section 144B(2) of the IT Act.
3.10 Further, he has filed his written submissions and insisted this Court to take the same into
consideration and pass appropriate orders. All the other learned Standing counsel have adapted the
submissions made by Dr.B.Ramaswamy, learned Senior Standing counsel. In support of their
contentions, they had referred to the following judgements and requests this Court to dismiss these
writ petitions:

i) the judgment of Hon'ble Delhi High Court in T.K.S.Builders Private Limited vs.
Income Tax Officer rendered in W.P.(C).No.1968 of 2023.
ii) the judgment of Hon'ble Calcutta High Court in Dhiraj Lakhotia vs. Union of India
and another rendered in W.P.(A).No.1458 of 2024.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc.
4. I have given my anxious consideration to the submissions made by the respective learned counsel
for the petitioners and the learned Senior Standing counsel for the respondents.
5. The central issue that arises for consideration in these Writ Petitions is, who is the appropriate
authority to issue Notice under Section 148 of the IT Act after the introduction of E-Assessment of
Income Escaping Assessment Scheme, 2022, dated 29.03.2022 and Faceless Jurisdiction of
Income-tax Authorities Scheme, 2022, dated 28.03.2022?
6. Ms.G.Vardhini Karthik, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner would submit that after the
introduction of E-Assessment of Income Escaping Assessment Scheme, 2022 vide notification SO
1466(E) dated 29.03.2022 with effect from 01.04.2022, the assessment, re-
assessment or re-computation under Section 147 of the IT Act shall be made in faceless manner in
terms of the provisions of the Scheme read with Section 144B of the IT Act.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc.
7. On the other hand, Dr.B.Ramaswamy, learned Senior Standing counsel and other learned
Standing counsel appearing for the respondents would submit that the assessment, re-assessment
or re-computation under Section 147 of the IT Act, with regard to the income escaped assessment,
has to be carried out in faceless manner in terms of the provisions of Section 144B of the IT Act.
However, Section 144B of the IT Act shall not enable the National Faceless Assessment Centre
(NaFAC) to issue the notice under Section 148A and 148 of the IT Act in the faceless manner.
8. In reply, the learned counsel for the petitioner had consistently submitted that notice under
Section 148A and 148 shall be issued by the NaFAC in terms of the provisions of Section 144B of the
IT Act read with the Scheme.
9. Now, let me analyze the provisions of Section 144B of the IT Act, which was introduced, vide the
Finance Act, 2022, with effect from 01.04.2022, which is both in substantive and procedural in
nature. For ready reference, Section 144B of the IT Act is reproduced hereunder:

https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc. recording its reasons in writing. refer

(3) to (10)................”
10. A reading of the Sub-Section (1) of Section 144B of the IT Act would show that notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in any other provision of this Act, the assessment, reassessment
or recomputation under sub-section (3) of section 143 or under section 144 or under section 147, in
the cases referred to in Sub-Section (2) shall be made in faceless manner. Therefore, it is clear that
the assessment, re-assessment or re-
computation under Section 147 of the IT Act shall be made in terms of provisions of Section 144B to
the extent provided under Sub-Section (2) of Section 144B of the IT Act.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc.
11. A reading of the Sub-Section (2) of Section 144B would show that for the purpose of making
faceless assessment in terms of Section 144B of the IT Act, the Board (Central Board of Direct Taxes)
can specify territorial area, or persons or class of persons, or income or class of income, or cases or
class of cases. Therefore, Sub-Section (2) enables the Board to specify area or class of cases to be
handled in faceless assessment in terms of Section 144B. Further, this Sub-Section (2) empowers the
Board to include or exclude certain type of cases from the purview of the faceless assessment.
Therefore, based on the circular, guideline or notification issued from time to time, the Authorities
shall conduct the faceless assessment.

12. That apart, Sub-Section (1) of Section 144B further provides the procedure for conducting the
faceless assessment.
12.1 Clause (i)
(a) In terms of Clause (i) of Sub-Section (1) of Section 144B of the IT Act, the NaFAC shall assign the
cases selected for the purpose of faceless assessment to a specific assessment unit through
Automated Allocation System.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc.
(b) Thus, it is clear that the NaFAC is doing the process of selection of cases for faceless assessment
and thereafter, it will be assigned to various assessment unit through Automated Allocation System.
(c) The “Automated Allocation System” has been defined in Explanation to Section 144B, which
reads as follows:
“(a)...
(b)...
(c) “automated allocation system” means an algorithm for randomised allocation of
cases, by using suitable technological tools, including artificial intelligence and
machine learning, with a view to optimise the use of resources”
(d) Therefore, in the manner stated above, the NaFAC will select the cases and
thereafter, assign the same through the Automated Allocation System.
12.2 Clause (ii)
(a) In terms of Clause (ii) of Sub-Section (1) of Section 144B of the IT Act, the NaFAC shall send
intimation/notice to the Assessee stating that https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of
2024 etc. the assessment in his/her case shall be completed in accordance with the procedure laid
down under Section 144B of the IT Act.
12.3 Clause (iii)
(a) In terms of Clause (iii) of the Sub-Section (1) of Section 144B of the IT Act, a notice under
Section 143(2) or 142(1) of the IT Act shall be served on the assessee, through NaFAC and the
assessee shall file his/her response to such notice, within the date specified therein, to the NaFAC
and thereafter, the NaFAC shall forward the same to the respective assessment unit.
(b) Out of the cases selected for the purpose of faceless assessment by the NaFAC, the NaFAC shall
send notice to the respective Assessee under Section 143(2) or 142(1) of the IT Act. After receipt of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/36406891/ 12
Mark Studio India Private Limited vs Income Tax Officer on 20 December, 2024
the responses from the respective Assessees, the said responses along with the notice shall be
forwarded to the respective assessment unit by the NaFAC. Therefore, Clause (iii) of Sub-Section (1)
of Section 144B of the IT Act enables the NaFAC to send notice under Section 143(2) or 142(1) of the
IT Act.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc.
13. Now, let me examine the situation, under which, the notice shall be sent by NaFAC under Section
143(2) or 142(1) of the IT Act. For ready reference, Section 142(1) and 143(2) of IT Act are extracted
hereunder:
“142.-Inquiry before Assessment.
(1) For the purpose of making an assessment under this Act, the [Assessing] Officer
may serve on any person who has made a return under Section 115WD or Section 139
or in whose case the time allowed under sub-section (1) of section 139 for furnishing
the return has expired, a notice requiring him, on a date to be therein specified,-
(i) where such person has not made a return within the time allowed under sub-section (1) of section
139 or before the end of the relevant assessment year, to furnish a return of his income or the
income of any other person in respect of which he is assessable under this Act in the prescribed form
and verified in the prescribed manner and setting forth such other particulars as may be prescribed.
or Provided that where any notice has been served under this sub. section for the purposes of this
clause after the end of the relevant assessment year commencing on or after the Ist day of April,
1990 to a person who has not made a return within the time allowed under sub-section (1) of section
139 or before the end of the relevant assessment year, any such notice issued to him shall be deemed
to have been served in accordance with the provisions of this sub- section:
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc. Provided further that a
notice under this sub- section for the pur poses of this clause may also be served by
the prescribed income-tax authority, [(ii)] to produce, or cause to be produced, such
accounts or documents as the [Assessing] Officer may require, or [(iii)] to furnish in
writing and verified in the prescribed manner informa- tion in such form and on such
points or matters (including a statement of all assets and liabilities of the assessee,
whether included in the accounts or not) as the [Assessing] Officer may require:
143.- Assessment (1)....
(2) Where a return has been furnished under Section 139 or in response to a notice under
sub-section (1) of Section 142, the Assessing Officer or the prescribed income-tax authority, as the
case may be, if, considers it necessary or expedient to ensure that the assessee has not understated
the income or has not computed excessive loss or has not under-paid the tax in any manner, shall
serve on the assessee a notice requiring him, on a date to be specified therein, either to attend the
office of the Assessing Officer or to produce, or cause to be produced before the Assessing Officer

Mark Studio India Private Limited vs Income Tax Officer on 20 December, 2024
any evidence on which the assessee may rely in support of the return”
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc.
14. A reading of the above provisions of Section 142(1) would show that for the purpose of
assessment under this Act, the Assessing Officer may serve on any person, who has made returns
under Section 115WD or Section 139 or in whose case the time allowed under Sub-Section (1) of
Section 139 for furnishing the returns expires a notice requiring him as on the date to be therein
specified in the manner stated in Section 142(1) of the IT Act to the NaFAC.
15. Further, a reading of Section 143(2) of the IT Act would state that where the return has been
furnished under Section 139 or in response to a notice under Section 142(1) of the IT Act, the
NaFAC, if considered it necessary or expedite to ensure that the Assessee has not understated the
income or has not computed excessive loss or has not under-paid taxes in any manner, shall serve
on the assessee a notice requiring him, on a date to be specified therein, either to attend the office of
the Assessing Officer or to produce, or cause to be produced before the Assessing Officer any
evidence on which the assessee may rely in support of the return https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc.
16. Upon reading the provisions of Section 144B of the IT Act, it is clear that Section 144B of the IT
Act would enable the NaFAC alone to send notice under Section 142(1) and Section 143(2) of the IT
Act, to the cases to the extent provided under Sub-Section (2) of Section 144B of the IT Act, by the
Board, for the purpose of assessment, reassessment or re-
computation of profit or loss. The said Sections 142(1) and 143(2) deal with the sending of notices
when the Assessee has not filed returns in time or the Assessee have filed the returns and to ensure
the correctness of the details furnished in the returns.
17. As far as the income escaping assessment is concerned, it is also equally necessary to send notice
under Section 142(1) or 143(2) of the IT Act. This would arise in the following point of time:
i) After serving notice under Section 148 of the IT Act, if no returns has been
furnished in response to the said notice, in such case, the notice will be send under
Section 142(1) of the IT Act.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc.
ii) In cases, where the returns were furnished after the receipt of notice issued under Section 148 of
the Act, in such case, the notice under Section 143(2) of the IT Act will be sent.
18. In the above two cases of income escaping assessment, i.e., whether the return has been filed or
no return has been filed, notice under Section 143(2) or 142(1) of the IT Act as the case may be, shall
be served on the Assessee calling upon information through NaFAC.

19. With regard to the said aspect, the Board had issued guidelines on 24.05.2023 for compulsory
selection of returns for complete scrutiny for the financial year 2023-24. Clause (4) of the said
guidelines deals with the cases, in which, notice under Section 148 of the IT Act has been issued and
the same reads as follows:
S. Parameter Procedure for Compulsory Selection No (4) Cases in which notice under
Section 148 of the Act have been issued Cases where (i) Cases, where notices u/s 148
of the Act return is either have been issued pursuant to search &
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc. S. Parameter
Procedure for Compulsory Selection No furnished or not seizure/survey actions
conducted on or furnished in after the 1 day of April, 2021:
response to These cases shall be selected for notice u/s 148 compulsory scrutiny with
prior administrative of the Act approval of Pr.CIT/Pr.DIT/CIT/DIT concerned who
shall ensure that such cases, if lying outside Central Charges, are transferred to
Central Charges u/s 127 of the Act within 15 days of service of notice u/s
143(2)/142(1) of the Act calling for information by the Jurisdictional Assessing
Officer concerned.
(ii) Cases other than search & seizure/survey:
a) For those cases which are to be completed by NaFAC on or before 31.03.2024,
Jurisdictional Assessing Officers (JAOs) shall upload the underlying documents, on
the basis of which notice u/s 148 was issued, on ITBA, for access by NaFAC.
The Directorate of Income-tax (Systems) shall forward these cases to NaFAC, which
will take further necessary action.
Notice u/s 143(2)/142(1) of the Act calling for information shall be served on the
assessed through NaFAC.
(For Assessing Officers in International Taxation and Central Circle Charges; refer
para 4.1 at page No.06) https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024
etc.
20.Clause (4) of the guidelines dated 24.05.2023:
(a) The Sub-clause (i) of Clause (4) deals with the seizure and survey actions and
hence, the same will not comes under faceless assessment scheme.
(b) The Sub-clause (ii) of Clause (4) deals with cases, other than the search and
seizure, wherein it states that for those cases, which are to be completed by NaFAC on
or before 31.03.2024, the Jurisdictional Assessment Officer (JAO) shall upload
underlying documents, on the basis on which the notice under Section 148 was
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/36406891/ 15
Mark Studio India Private Limited vs Income Tax Officer on 20 December, 2024
issued, on ITBA, for access by NaFAC. Further, it has been stated that the Directorate
of Income Tax (Systems) shall forward these cases to NaFAC, which will take further
necessary action. Thereafter, the notice under Section 143(2) or 142(1) of the IT Act
shall be served against the respective Assessee and called upon the information from
Assessee through NaFAC.
21. The above extraction at paragraph 19 is the guidelines issued by the Board by virtue of the power
available under Sub-Section (2) of Section https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of
2024 etc. 144B of the IT Act. At this juncture, it would be apposite to extract the provisions of
Sub-Section (2) of Section 144B of the IT Act hereunder:
“(2) The faceless assessment under sub-section (1) shall be made in respect of such
territorial area, or persons or class of persons or incomes or class of incomes or cases
or class of cases, as may be specified by the Board.”
a) A reading of the above makes it clear that for the purpose of faceless assessment,
the Board has to specify the territorial area, or persons or class of persons, or
incomes or class of incomes, or cases or class of cases.
b) As far as the territorial area is concerned, in law, the term “territorial area” would
mean under the jurisdiction of Government Authorities. Accordingly, by virtue of
powers available under Section 144B(2) and in accordance with the provisions of
Scheme, the area of JAO and FAO, has been clarified for the purpose of issuance of
148/148A notice and thereafter, the assessment, re-assessment or re-computation
shall be carried out by virtue of FAO in terms of the provisions of Section 144B of the
IT Act.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc.
22. On the other hand, in absence of any such Scheme for issuance of Section 148A notice and with
the limited scope of the Scheme for issuance of Section 148 notice, the cases pertaining to issuance
of Section 148 or 148A notice, has been alloted by the Directorate of Income Tax (Systems) to the
Jurisdictional Assessing Officer based on the PAN jurisdiction by virtue of Automated Allocation
System, whereas, the jurisdiction for issuance notice under Section 142(1) or 143(2) has been
allotted to the NaFAC based on the automated allocation system to the extent as provided under
clause (i) of Sub-Section (1) of Section 144B of the IT Act and subsequent procedure shall be
conducted by the Assessing Officer in the manner referred in Section 144B of the IT Act.
23. Further, the Board has taken into consideration with regard to the aspect of obtaining prior
approval from the higher authority for issuance of notice under Section 148 of the Act. Though
Section 151A mandates the Central Government to bring in a Scheme in this regard, so far, no such
scheme was brought in.

24. An argument was put forward by the learned counsel for the petitioner with regard to the
footnote, wherein it has been mentioned as follows:
(For Assessing Officers in International Taxation and Central Circle Charges; refer
para 4.1 at page No.06)
25. She would submit that the said provisions in the guidelines would apply in the cases of
international taxation and Central circle charges.
However, this Court is of the view that the said interpretation of the learned counsel for the
petitioner is not correct. It is very clear that sub-clause (ii) of Clause (4) not only deals with
international taxation cases but all the cases other than the search and survey, including cases under
Section 148 of the Act, etc.,
26. Further, a reading of Section 144B of the IT Act (extracted supra), it is clear that the Clause (iii)
of Sub-Section (1) of Section 144B of the IT Act empowers the NaFAC to assume its jurisdiction in
Section 148 cases from the stage of issuance of notice under Section 143(2) or 142(1) of the IT Act,
thus, it will not enable them to issue any notice under Section 148A
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc. or 148 of the IT Act. Keeping that in
mind, the Board has issued the aforesaid guidelines on 24.05.2023, which would squarely apply to
the petitioner's case as well.
27. An argument was made by the learned counsel for the petitioner by referring proviso to
Sub-Section (2) of Section 151A of the IT Act, wherein it has been stated that “no direction shall be
issued after the 31st day of March, 2022”. Further, by referring the Sub-Section (2) of Section 151A
of the IT Act, wherein it has been stated that “the Central Government may, for the purpose of giving
effect to the scheme made under sub-section (1), by notification in the Official Gazette, direct that
any of the provisions of this Act shall not apply or shall apply with such exceptions, modifications
and adaptations as may be specified in the notification”, she contended that the Central Government
cannot issue any direction beyond 31.03.2022. Therefore, the guidelines issued by the Board on
24.05.2023 is beyond the scope of Section 151A of the IT Act.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc.
28. Now, let me examine the provisions of Section 151A of the IT Act and the E-Assessment of
Income Escaping Assessment Scheme, 2022, dated 29.03.2022 and the Faceless Jurisdiction of
Income Tax Authorities Scheme, 2022 dated 28.03.2022. For ready reference, the provisions of
Section 151A of the IT Act reads as follows:
“151A. (1) The Central Government may make a scheme, by notification in the Official
Gazette, for the purposes of assessment, reassessment or re-computation under
section 147 or issuance of notice under section 148 or conducting of enquiries or
issuance of show-cause notice or passing of order under section 148A or sanction for
issue of such notice under section 151, so as to impart greater efficiency, transparency
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/36406891/ 17
Mark Studio India Private Limited vs Income Tax Officer on 20 December, 2024
and accountability by-
(a) Eliminating the interface between the income-tax authority and the assessee or
any other person to the extent technologically feasible.
(b) Optimizing utilization of the resources through economies of scale and functional
specialization;
(c) Introducing a team-based assessment, reassessment, re-computation or issuance
or sanction of notice with dynamic jurisdiction. (2) The Central Government may, for
the purpose of giving effect to the scheme made under sub-section (1), by
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc. notification in the
Official Gazette, direct that any of the provisions of this Act shall not apply or shall
apply with such exceptions, modifications and adaptations as may be specified in the
notification:
Provided that no direction shall be issued after the 31st day of March, 2022.
(3) Every notification issued under sub-section (1) and sub-section (2) shall, as soon
as may be after the notification is issued, be laid before each House of Parliament.”
29. This Court is unable to persuade with the submissions of the learned counsel for the petitioners
for the reasons that in Section 151A of the IT Act, it has been stated that the Central Government
cannot issue modification, alteration or adaptation with regard to the notification issued on
28.03.2022 or 29.03.2022. Further, the Sub-Section (2) of Section 151A read with the proviso
mentioned therein states that no direction shall be issued with regard to the provisions of any
exemption, modification or adaptation as may be specified in the Notification. In the present case,
no such exemption, modification or adaptation has been made in the above two notifications issued
by the Central Government, it has also not brought in https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc. any such notification to give effect to the same. On the other hand, the
Board has issued the guidelines in terms of the provisions of Section 144B(2) of the IT Act, which
empowers them to issue such guidelines and the issuance of such guidelines within the scope of
sub-section (2) of 144B will not amount to issuance of any direction by Central Government to make
modifications, exemption or adaptation in the above two notification.
30. In terms of Section 151A of the IT Act, for issuance of Section 148 notice, the prior approval is
require from the Authorities concerned. On the other hand, Section 151A empowers the Central
Government to bring a Scheme for sanction of issuance of notice under Section 151 of the IT Act.
However, so far, no Scheme was brought in by the Central Government. In the absence of any such
Scheme, the provisions of Section 151A has to be complied with, while issuing Section 148 notice, the
prior approval has to be obtained. Accordingly, the Board has issued the above guidelines for the
purpose of implementation of the Act, without any deviation from the Scheme and the provisions of
Section 144B of the IT Act.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/36406891/ 18
Mark Studio India Private Limited vs Income Tax Officer on 20 December, 2024
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc.
31. As stated above, the NaFAC will assume its jurisdiction in Section 148 cases from the stage of
issuance of notice under Section 142(1) or 143(2) of the IT Act, which is subsequent to the stage of
obtaining permission from the higher Authorities concerned under Section 151 of the IT Act for
issuance of notice under Section 148 of the IT Act. Therefore, the NaFAC will have no role to play in
issuance of Section 148 notice and to get prior approval from higher Authorities in terms of Section
151, for which either Section 144B or Scheme issued on 28.03.2022 and 29.03.2022 empowers
them. Therefore, this Court is not is a position to agree with the submissions of the learned counsel
for the petitioner on this aspect.
32.Clause (iv)
(a) Further, Clause (iv) of Sub-Section (1) of Section 144B of the IT Act deals with the aspect, which
enables the assessment unit to obtain such further information or document or evidence from the
Assessee or any other person and may make a request to NaFAC to send appropriate notice with
regard to the same.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc.
(b) Subsequent to the allotment of cases by NaFAC on the basis of Automated Allocation System to
the assessment unit, the assessment unit can request NaFAC for any additional information.
Therefore, as much as possible the information has been furnished, when the matters are selected
and allocated, to the assessment unit.
(c) In terms of Clause (i) of Sub-Section (1) of Section 144B of the IT Act, the NaFAC shall allot the
cases based on the Automated Allocation System. While allotting the cases, if there is any scope for
issuance of notice under Section 142(1) or Section 143(2), the notice will be issued by NaFAC to the
concerned Assesee and after getting response from the Assessee, the NaFAC will provide the same to
the assessment unit. As far as Section 148 notice is concerned, the same will also be forwarded to the
assessment unit along with reply. That is why the Clause (iv) of sub-section (1) of Section 144B,
states that if any further information, documents or evidences from assessee or any other person is
required by the assessment unit, it may https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024
etc. request the same through NaFAC. Therefore, from the above, it is clear that when the cases are
alloted through Automated Allocation System by NaFAC, the cases falling under Section 148 will
also be taken into consideration for the purpose of allocation to the assessment unit.
Accordingly, the notice along with the other documents filed by the assessee will be forwarded to the
assessment unit. In the meantime, the notice under Section 142(1) or 143(2) will be issued in
appropriate cases by NaFAC and after receipt of the response, the said response will also be
forwarded to the concerned assessment unit. The above aspect was made clear vide the guidelines
issued by the Department by virtue of notification dated 24.05.2023.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/36406891/ 19
Mark Studio India Private Limited vs Income Tax Officer on 20 December, 2024
33. Therefore, as far as the income escaped assessment is concerned, the jurisdiction of the NaFAC
would start to conduct Section 147 proceedings in terms of provisions of Section 144B of the IT Act,
only from the stage of issuance of notice under Section 143(2) or 142(1), i.e., subsequent to the
issuance of notice under Section 148 of the IT Act. Thus, the NaFAC assumes the jurisdiction for
assessment, re-
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc. assessment or re-computation in the
cases of income escaping assessment only from the stage of issuing the notice under Section 142(1)
or 143(2) immediately upon the receipt of information from the Directorate of Income Tax
(Systems).
34. From the above discussion, it is clear that the NaFAC will not have any power of issuance of
notice under Section 148 or 148A of the IT Act. As contended by the learned Senior Standing counsel
appearing for the respondents, in cases of income escaping the assessment, the work of NaFAC only
starts from issuance of notice under Section 142(1) and 143(2) of the IT Act.
35. In terms of Sub-Section (2) of Section 151A of the IT Act, the Central Government may, for the
purpose of giving effect to the scheme made under sub-section (1), by notification in the Official
Gazette, direct that any of the provisions of this Act shall not apply or shall apply with such
exceptions, modifications and adaptations as may be specified in the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc. notification, provided that no
direction shall be issued after the 31 st day of March, 2022.
36. Thus, Section 151A of the IT Act enables the Central Government to bring separate scheme for
the purpose of
i) assessment, reassessment or re-computation under section 147 or
ii) issuance of notice under Section 148 or
iii) conducting of inquiry or issuance of show cause notice or passing of order under Section 148A or
iv) sanction for issuance of notice under Section 151.
37. By virtue of the power available under Section 151A of the IT Act, the Central Government has
brought a Scheme called “E-Assessment of Income Escaping Assessment Scheme, 2022”
(hereinafter called as Scheme) vide notification S.O.1466(E) dated 29.03.2022 and the said e-
assessment scheme is extracted hereunder:

an algorithm for randomised allocation of cases, by using suitable technological tools,
including artificial intelligence and machine learning, with a view to optimise the use
of resources.
(ii) The purpose of the Scheme is to make

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/36406891/ 22
Mark Studio India Private Limited vs Income Tax Officer on 20 December, 2024
(iv) There is no quarrel on the aspect that the assessment, re-assessment or re-computation under
Section 147 of the Act shall be made in terms of provision of Section 144B of the IT Act by virtue of
the procedure laid down therein.
(v) Clause 3(b) of the Scheme provides that the issuance of notice under Section 148 of the IT Act
shall be through automated allocation, in accordance with the risk management strategy,
formulated by the Board as referred to in Section 148 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc. of the IT Act for issuance of notice, in a faceless manner to the extent
provided in Section 144B of the Act with reference to making assessment or reassessment or
re-computation of total income or loss of the assessee.
(vi) It was the contention of the Department that already Section 148 notices have been issued
through automated allocation in accordance with risk management strategy formulated by the
Board as referred to in Section 148 of the Act in a faceless manner.
(vii) As per the provisions of E-Assessment Scheme, while issuing notice under Section 148 of the IT
Act, the following three mandatory requirements have to be complied with:
The notice under Section 148 shall be issued
(a) through automated allocation;
(b) in accordance with the risk management strategy formulated by the Board as
referred to in Section 148 of the Act;
(c) in the faceless manner to the extent mentioned in Section 144B of the IT Act.
(a) Automated Allocation System:
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc.
(i) As far as the automated allocation for issuance of notice under Section 148 of the
IT Act is concerned, the Directorate of Income Tax (Systems) will select cases
randomly from ITBA portal based on the PAN card jurisdiction and allocate through
the automated allocation system as defined in the Scheme to the concerned
Jurisdictional Assessing Officer.
(ii) Since the cases are selected randomly by the Directorate of Income Tax (Systems)
and allocated based on the PAN Card jurisdiction to the concerned Jurisdictional
Assessing Officer, the JAO will have no role to play in allocation and selection of
cases. Even the Directorate of Income Tax (Systems) will not have any knowledge,
about the allotment of cases to a particular assessing officer.

Mark Studio India Private Limited vs Income Tax Officer on 20 December, 2024
(iii) As far as the present case is concerned, as contended by the learned Senior
Standing counsel appearing for the respondents, the Directorate of Income Tax
(Systems) has made the allocation through Automated Allocation System to the
respective Assessing Officer based on https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc. the PAN card jurisdiction. Hence, in the case on hand,
the requirement of Automated Allocation System has already been duly complied
with.
(b) Risk Management Strategy:
(i) As far as the risk management strategy is concerned, it was contended by the
respondents that the Income Tax Department developed an integrated platform, i.e.
Income Tax Business Application (ITBA), which is the core application used by the
Income Tax Officer for all operations. In the said portal, all the information gets
uploaded based on the risk management strategy formulated by the Board from time
to time, and once the information is uploaded in the ITBA Portal from various
sources.
Thereafter, the system will classify, select and allot, based on the PAN card jurisdiction, after
classification based on the Software, through the automated allocation system.
(ii) The situation, under which and how the cases, pertaining to income escaping the assessment
under Section 148 of the IT Act, has been selected based on the data analytics and Artificial
Intelligence (AI) and https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc. advance
algorithm to detect the cases based on the risk management strategy formulated by the Board from
time to time, as contended by Dr.B.Ramaswamy, learned Senior Standing counsel, are as follows:
1. Data Integration from Multiple Sources The department consolidates data from
various sources, including:
Annual Information Statement (AIS) Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) returns GST
filings Bank transactions (via SFT - Statement of Financial Transactions) Property
registrations and luxury purchases Investments in shares, mutual funds, or foreign
assets Data from other government departments like the RBI or SEBI.
2. Cross-Verification of Reported Income The system compares the income reported
in the Income Tax Return (ITR) with:
High-value transactions in the AIS.
TDS and Tax Collected at Source (TCS) data. Details of expenses or investments
reported elsewhere (e.g., property purchases, business turnover).
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/36406891/ 24
Mark Studio India Private Limited vs Income Tax Officer on 20 December, 2024
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc. Example: A taxpayer
reports an income of **** but shows a property purchase of ****. This mismatch
triggers an alert.
3. Pattern Recognition and Risk Analysis AI algorithms identify patterns of
underreporting or evasion, such as:
Sudden drops in reported income compared to previous years.
Unusual claims of deductions or exemptions. Non-reporting of foreign income or
assets. Failure to reconcile GST returns with ITR.
4. Identifying Non-Filers The system tracks taxpayers who are:
Liable to file returns but fail to do so, based on TDS data, property transactions, or
business turnover.
Repeat offenders in earlier assessments.
5. Report from High-Value Transactions Transactions exceeding specific thresholds
are reported by entities like banks, credit card companies, and registrars.
Examples: Cash deposits above **** in a financial year. Credit card payments exceeding ***** in a
single transaction. Mutual fund purchases above **** https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc.
6. Information from External Sources Whistleblower reports, media investigations, or third- party
complaints are incorporated into the system for analysis.
7. Automated Risk Scoring Each taxpayer is assigned a risk score based on:
Income consistency over years.
Discrepancies in declarations.
Past compliance behavior.
Complexity of transactions.
High-risk cases are alerted for further review.
8. Alerts for Reassessment (Section 148) If the system identifies significant discrepancies or
undisclosed income, a case is alloted for reassessment under Section 148, subject to approval by
senior tax authorities.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/36406891/ 25
Mark Studio India Private Limited vs Income Tax Officer on 20 December, 2024
This automated and data-driven process minimizes human bias and ensures systematic detection of
income escaping assessment.
The alerts in the Income Tax Department's system are identified through automated processes that
analyze discrepancies, patterns, and inconsistencies in financial data.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc. These alerts are triggered when
specific conditions or anomalies are detected. Here's how they are identified:
a) Mismatch in Reported Income The income reported in the ITR does not align with
financial transactions in the Annual Information Statement (AIS) or Form 26AS.
Example: Reported income: **** : Bank deposits: ****
b) High-Value Transactions Specific thresholds for transactions trigger an alert if not properly
explained in the ITR.
Cash Deposits: Deposits above *** in a savings account. Credit Card Payments: Annual payments
exceeding *** Property Purchases: Real estate transactions above *** Mutual Fund Investments:
Exceeding *** in a financial year.
c) Discrepancy in TDS/TCS Data Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) shown in Form 26AS does not
match the income reported in the ITR.
Example: TDS by employer: ***. Income declared: *** (lower than expected for this TDS amount).
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc.
d) GST and Income Tax Data Mismatch Businesses filing GST returns but reporting significantly
lower income in ITR.
Example: GST turnover: ***.
ITR turnover: **
e) Sudden Changes in Income or Deductions Unusual drops in income or abnormal claims of
exemptions/deductions compared to previous years. Example: Previous income: *** current
income: *** without reasonable justification.
f) Inconsistencies in Capital Gains or Investments Gains from shares, mutual funds, or property are
underreported, or investments exceed known sources of income.
Example: Mutual fund investment: **; reported income: **
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/36406891/ 26
Mark Studio India Private Limited vs Income Tax Officer on 20 December, 2024
g) Non-Filing or Delayed Filing Taxpayers liable to file ITR but failing to do so. Filing after the due
date, especially when associated with high-value transactions.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc.
h) International Transactions and Foreign Assets Non-disclosure of foreign income, investments, or
bank accounts.
Example: Foreign remittance data shows ** transferred abroad, but no corresponding income is
declared.
i) Frequent Cash Transactions Excessive cash deposits or withdrawals not aligned with the
taxpayer's profile or declared income.
Example: Annual cash deposits: **; declared income: **
j) Business Turnover and Profit Mismatch Businesses reporting disproportionate turnover and
profits compared to industry standards.
Example: Turnover: ** profit: ** (significantly lower than sector averages).
k) Non-Reconciliation of AIS/Statement of Financial Transactions (SFT) The data reported by
banks, registrars, or other institutions in the AIS or SFT is not reflected in the taxpayer's ITR.
Example: Bank reports ** in interest income; ITR reports *** https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc.
l) Past Non-Compliance Behavior Taxpayers with a history of underreporting income or penalties in
earlier assessments.
How these transactions are Detected :
1. AI and Machine Learning Models: Analyze patterns and detect anomalies based on
historical data.
2. Risk Profiling: Taxpayers are scored on their likelihood of evasion based on their
profile, transaction history, and compliance behavior.
3. Cross-Verification Tools: Automated systems cross-
check data from multiple sources (e.g., banks, registrars, GST filings).
4. Threshold Alerts: Pre-defined thresholds for transactions trigger system-generated alerts for
review.

Mark Studio India Private Limited vs Income Tax Officer on 20 December, 2024
Once the above criteria have been complied with, the notice under section 148 will be issued for
further scrutiny, after obtaining the prior approval/sanction from the senior Authorities in terms of
provisions of Section 151 of the IT Act.
(iii) From reading the above, it is clear that the Department has been selecting the cases based on
the above procedure and the same is squarely in https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223
of 2024 etc. accordance with the risk management strategy framed by Board referred in Section 148
of the IT Act. Thereafter, based on the Automated Allocation System, the Directorate of Income Tax
(Systems) forwarding the cases based on the PAN jurisdiction. Therefore, the selection and
allotment of cases, will not comes within the purview of the person who send notice based on the
PAN jurisdiction, who is non other then the Jurisdictional Assessing Officer.
(iv) Therefore, the cases were selected based on the risk management strategy framed by the Board
in terms of Section 148 of the IT Act. Hence, the requirement of Scheme, i.e., Section 148 notice
shall be issued in accordance with the risk management strategy formulated by the Board as
referred in Section 148 of the IT Act, has been duly complied with.
(v) Further, it is not in the domain of the concerned jurisdictional Assessing Officer to pick and
choose, but it would be automated allocation of cases based on the risk management strategy as
formulated by the Board from time to time. Therefore, the issuance of notice under Section 148 have
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc. already been duly complied with by
issuing the same by JAO in a faceless manner, through automated allocation system, in accordance
with the risk management strategy as stated above.
(c) Faceless Manner:
(i) The petitioner has referred to Section 144B and contended that it should be in
faceless manner otherwise, the Scheme would become redundant and Clause 3(b) of
the Scheme would be otiose and in this regard, they referred three judgments of the
three High Courts.
(ii) As far as Section 144B is concerned, there is no dispute that the same deals with
faceless assessment and the procedure stated therein would apply for the purpose of
assessment, re-assessment or re-computation to the extent provided therein and
send notice, as referred in Section 144B of the IT Act, by NaFAC. Except the above,
the NaFAC will not have any power to issue any other notice beyond the scope of
Section 144B of the IT Act.
The Scheme only speaks about the issuance of notice in faceless manner.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc.
(iii) Nowhere, either in provisions of IT Act or by virtue of any notification or Scheme, the word
“faceless manner” has been defined. Only the word “faceless assessment” has been defined in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/36406891/ 28
Mark Studio India Private Limited vs Income Tax Officer on 20 December, 2024
Section 144B of the IT Act, which reads as follows:
(2)(1)(k) "faceless assessment" means the assessment proceedings conducted
electronically in 'e-Proceeding' facility through assessee's registered account in
designated portal;
(iv) A reading of the above definition would reveal that the faceless assessment
proceedings is nothing but the e-proceedings conducted electronically in
'e-proceeding' facility through Assessee's registered account in designated portal.
(v) The designated portal means a web portal designated by the Principal Chief
Commissioner or the Principal Director General, in charge of the National Faceless
Assessment Centre. This designated portal is meant for the purpose of making
faceless assessment under Section 144B of the IT Act.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc.
(vi) As far as sending notice in faceless manner is concerned, the Directorate of Income Tax
(Systems) will select the cases based on the risk management strategy formulated by the Board from
time to time. Thereafter, allocating the case through Automated Allocation System as discussed
above to the respective Jurisdictional Assessing Officer based on the PAN card jurisdiction.
(vii) As discussed above, the faceless manner means, sending notice electronically by way of
“e-proceedings” to the assessee's registered account through ITBA portal itself, i.e. web portal which
is designated and controlled by Directorate General of Income Tax (System).
(viii) In the present case, the notice was sent to the Assessee electronically from the web portal of
ITBA through the e-proceeding facilities available with the Department through the Assessee's
registered account from the web portal of the ITBA. There is no quarrel on this aspect also. If it is so,
all the requirements of the Scheme are duly complied with i.e., the notice has been sent under
Section 148 of the IT Act in a faceless manner, through Automated Allocation, in accordance with
the risk https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc. management strategy
formulated by the Board as referred to in Section 148 of the Act.
(ix) At this juncture, it would be apposite to extract the first and last page of the notices issued under
Section 148A and 148 of the IT Act, which reads as follows:
First page of Section 148A notice:
Last page of Section 148A notice:
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc. Section 148 notice:

https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc.
(x) A reading of the above two notices would show that the notice has been signed
digitally and it was sent to the Assessees' registered e-mail account through ITBA web
portal. As contended above, the cases have not been selected by the person, who has
send notice. However, as narrated above, the Directorate of Income Tax (Systems)
selected the cases based on the discrepancies identified by the risk management
system as referred in clause (i) of Explanation (1) to Section 148 of the Act.
42. Except the procedure mentioned above for the purpose of sending notice under Section 148, no
other provision enables any of the Income Tax Officers to send notice in any other mode in faceless
manner. In the present case, as discussed above, notice has been sent in the faceless manner by duly
complying with the conditions and the modalities mentioned in the scheme itself which were
already discussed that in the absence of specific provision empowering the Faceless Assessment
Officer in terms of Section 144B, the power and the Jurisdiction of the Jurisdictional Assessment
Officer cannot be taken away as long as Section 148 notice sent by automated allocation based on
risk management strategy and in a faceless https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of
2024 etc. manner in terms of the provisions of the Scheme.
43. In the present case, all the three ingredients have been duly complied with by the respondents in
issuance of the notice. Therefore, by no stretch of imagination, one can construe that the
respondents have sent the notice through ITBA portal not in the faceless manner. Notices were
already issued in faceless manner.
44. By referring the notices, the learned counsel for the petitioner has agreed that the e-notice was
sent by JAO through e-mail id of the assessee from the web portal of ITBA. However, she would
contend that the Officer name has been mentioned in the notices. As far as this contention is
concerned, this Court is of the view that if all the notices have been send in faceless manner, name of
the Officer should not be mentioned. However, it will only be considered as a procedural error,
which will not vitiate the entire initiation of the proceedings and hence, it will not affect the
jurisdiction to issue the notice by the respondent. But in future cases, the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc. respondent is being advised not to
mention the name of the officer and from where the notices has been sent.
45. Section 130 of the Income Tax Act empowers the Central Government to make a scheme to
exercise powers and performance of certain functions, vesting jurisdiction with the Assessing
Officer, the exercise of power to transfer cases, or exercise of jurisdiction in case of change of
incumbency in a faceless manner.
46. For the purpose of assessment, reassessment or re-computation, the Jurisdictional Assessing
Officer has been vested by virtue of the Faceless Jurisdiction of Income Tax Authorities Scheme,
2022, which was introduced on 28.03.2022.reads as under:

47. A reading of above Clause 3(b) shows that vesting the jurisdiction with the Assessing Officer as
referred to in section 124 of the Act, shall be in a faceless manner, through automated allocation in
accordance with and to the extent provided in section 144B of the Act with reference to making
faceless assessment or reassessment of total income or loss of assessee.

Assessing Officer for the purpose of Section 144B of the Act and those Officers can perform the
duties for assessment alone. When such being the case, they have no power to issue notice under
Section 148 of the Act. What was intended by the Act is only for the purpose of making faceless
assessment through the Assessing Officer referred to in Section 144B of the Act. The Assessing
Officer referred to in Section 144B of the Act cannot perform any other acts than making
assessment, reassessment or re-computation in faceless manner, to the extent provided in
Sub-Section (2) of Section 144B of the IT Act, by the Board.
49. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner has referred the judgment of the Telangana
High Court in Kankanala Ravindra Reddy vs. Income-Tax Officer reported in (2023) 156
taxmann.com 178 (TELANGANA). The relevant paragraphs, viz., paragraph Nos.25, 26 and 27 are
extracted hereunder:
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc. “25. A plain reading of
the aforesaid two notifications issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes dated
28-3-2022 and 29-3-2022, it would clearly indicate that the Central Board of Direct
Taxes was very clear in its mind when it framed the aforesaid two schemes with
respect to the proceedings to be drawn under section 148A, that is to have it in a
faceless manner. There were two mandatory conditions which were required to be
adhered to by the Department, firstly, the allocation being made through the
automated allocation system in accordance with the risk management strategy
formulated by the Board under section 148 of the Act. Secondly, the re- assessment
has to be done in a faceless manner to the extent provided under section 144B of the
Act.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/36406891/ 32
Mark Studio India Private Limited vs Income Tax Officer on 20 December, 2024
26. After the introduction of the above two schemes, it becomes mandatory for the
Revenue to conduct/initiate proceedings pertaining to reassessment under section
147, 148 & 148A of the Act in a faceless manner. Proceedings under section 147 and
section 148 of the Act would now have to be taken as per the procedure legislated by
the Parliament in respect of reopening/re-assessment i.e., proceedings under section
148A of the Act.
27. In the present case, both the proceedings i.e., the impugned proceedings under
section 148A of the Act, as well as the consequential notices under section 148 of the
Act were https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc. issued by the
local jurisdictional officer and not in the prescribed faceless manner. The order under
section 148A(d) of the Act and the notices under section 148 of the Act are issued on
29-4-2022, i.e., after the "Faceless Jurisdiction of the Income-tax Authorities
Scheme, 2022" and the "e-Assessment of Income Escaping Assessment Scheme,
2022" were introduced.
50. In the above case, the Hon'ble Telangana High Court has held that for making
assessment, reassessment or re-computation under Section 147, the notice under
Section 148 or 148A of the IT Act shall be issued in the faceless manner and rendered
the findings that in the above case, the notices were not issued in such faceless
manner. However, in the present case, this Court has already elaborately discussed as
to how the Section 148 or 148A notices have been issued by the respondents in
faceless manner based on the available facts and circumstances.
51. Further, she referred to the judgment of the Hon'ble Bombay High Court in
Hexaware Technologies Limited vz. Asistant Commissioner of Income Tax and others
reported in 2024 SCC OnLine Bom 1249. The https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc. relevant paragraphs, viz., paragraph Nos.33 to 37 are
extracted hereunder:
“33. The guideline dated August 1, 2022 relied upon by the Revenue is not applicable
because these guidelines are internal guidelines as is clear from the endorsement on
the first page of the guideline “Confidential For Departmental Circulation Only”. The
said guidelines are not issued under section 119 of the Act. Any such guideline issued
by the Central Board of Direct Taxes is not binding on the petitioner. Further the said
guideline is also not binding on respondent No. 1 as they are contrary to the
provisions of the Act and the Scheme framed under section 151A of the Act. The effect
of a guideline came up for discussion in Sofitel Realty LLP v. ITO (TDS) [(2023) 457
ITR 18 (Bom); 2023 SCC OnLine Bom 1498; (2023) 153 taxmann.com 496 (Bom).]
wherein this court has held that the guidelines which are contrary to the provisions of
the Act cannot be relied upon by the Revenue to reject an application for
compounding filed by an assessee. The court held that guidelines are subordinate to
the principal Act or Rules, it cannot restrict or override the application of specific
provisions enacted by Legislature. The guidelines cannot travel beyond the scope of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/36406891/ 33
Mark Studio India Private Limited vs Income Tax Officer on 20 December, 2024
the powers conferred by the Act or the Rules.
33.1. The guidelines do not deal with or even refer to the Scheme dated March 29, 2022 ((2022) 442
ITR (Stat) 198) https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc. framed by the
Government under section 151A of the Act. Section 151A(3) of the Act provides that the Scheme so
framed is required to be laid before each House of the Parliament. Therefore, the Scheme dated
March 29, 2022 under section 151A of the Act, which has also been laid before Parliament, would be
binding on the Revenue and the guideline dated August 1, 2022 cannot supersede the Scheme and if
it provides anything to the contrary to the said Scheme, then the same is required to be treated as
invalid and bad in law.
34. As regards Income-tax Business Application step-by- step Document No. 2 regarding issuance of
notice under section 148 of the Act, relied upon by the Revenue, an internal document cannot depart
from the explicit statutory provisions of, or supersede the Scheme framed by the Government under
section 151A of the Act which Scheme is also placed before both the Houses of Parliament as per
section 151A(3) of the Act. This is specially the case when the document does not even consider or
even refer to the Scheme. Further the said document is clearly intended to be a manual/guide as to
how to use the Income-tax Department's portal, and does not even claim to be a statement of the
Revenue's position/stand on the issue in question. Our observations with respect to the guidelines
dated August 1, 2022 relied upon by the Revenue will equally be applicable here.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc.
35. Further, in our view, there is no question of concurrent jurisdiction of the jurisdictional
Assessing Officer and the Faceless Assessing Officer for issuance of notice under section 148 of the
Act or even for passing assessment or reassessment order. When specific jurisdiction has been
assigned to either the jurisdictional Assessing Officer or the Faceless Assessing Officer in the
Scheme dated March 29, 2022, then it is to the exclusion of the other. To take any other view in the
matter, would not only result in chaos but also render the whole faceless proceedings redundant. If
the argument of the Revenue is to be accepted, then even when notices are issued by the Faceless
Assessing Officer, it would be open to an assessee to make submission before the jurisdictional
Assessing Officer and vice versa, which is clearly not contemplated in the Act. Therefore, there is no
question of concurrent jurisdiction of both Faceless Assessing Officer or the jurisdictional Assessing
Officer with respect to the issuance of notice under section 148 of the Act. The Scheme dated March
29, 2022 ((2022) 442 ITR (Stat) 198) in paragraph 3 clearly provides that the issuance of notice
“shall be through automated allocation” which means that the same is mandatory and is required to
be followed by the Department and does not give any discretion to the Department to choose
whether to follow it or not. That automated allocation is defined in https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc. paragraph 2(b) of the Scheme to mean an algorithm for randomised
allocation of cases by using suitable technological tools including artificial intelligence and machine
learning with a view to optimise the use of resources. Therefore, it means that the case can be
allocated randomly to any officer who would then have jurisdiction to issue the notice under section
148 of the Act. It is not the case of respondent No. 1 that respondent No. 1 was the random officer
who had been allocated jurisdiction.

Mark Studio India Private Limited vs Income Tax Officer on 20 December, 2024
36. With respect to the arguments of the Revenue, i.e., the Notification dated March 29, 2022
((2022) 442 ITR (Stat) 198) provides that the Scheme so framed is applicable only -to the extent?
provided in section 144B of the Act and section 144B of the Act does not refer to issuance of notice
under section 148 of the Act and hence, the notice cannot be issued by the Faceless Assessing Officer
as per the said Scheme, we express our view as follows:
36.1 Section 151A of the Act itself contemplates formulation of Scheme for both
assessment, reassessment or recomputation under section 147 as well as for issuance
of notice under section 148 of the Act. Therefore, the Scheme framed by the Central
Board of Direct Taxes, which covers both the aforesaid aspect of the provisions of
section 151A of the Act cannot be said to be applicable only for one aspect, i.e.,
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc. proceedings post the
issue of notice under section 148 of the Act being assessment, reassessment or
recomputation under section 147 of the Act and inapplicable to the issuance of notice
under section 148 of the Act. The Scheme is clearly applicable for issuance of notice
under section 148 of the Act and accordingly, it is only the Faceless Assessing Officer
which can issue the notice under section 148 of the Act and not the jurisdictional
Assessing Officer. The argument advanced by the respondent would render clause
3(b) of the Scheme otiose and to be ignored or contravened, as according to the
respondent, even though the Scheme specifically provides for issuance of notice
under section 148 of the Act in a faceless manner, no notice is required to be issued
under section 148 of the Act in a faceless manner. In such a situation, not only clause
3(b) but also the first two lines below clause 3(b) would be otiose, as it deals with the
aspect of issuance of notice under section 148 of the Act. The respondents, being an
authority subordinate to the Central Board of Direct Taxes, cannot argue that the
Scheme framed by the Central Board of Direct Taxes, and which has been laid before
both Houses of Parliament is partly otiose and inapplicable. The argument advanced
by the respondent expressly makes clause 3(b) otiose and impliedly makes the whole
Scheme otiose. If clause 3(b) of the Scheme is not applicable, then only clause 3(a) of
the Scheme remains. What https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024
etc. is covered in clause 3(a) of the Scheme is already provided in section 144B(1) of
the Act, which section provides for faceless assessment, and covers assessment,
reassessment or recomputation under section 147 of the Act. Therefore, if the
Revenue's arguments are to be accepted, there is no purpose of framing a Scheme
only for clause 3(a) which is in any event already covered under faceless assessment
regime in section 144B of the Act. The argument of the respondent, therefore, renders
the whole Scheme redundant. An argument which renders the whole Scheme otiose
cannot be accepted as correct interpretation of the Scheme. The phrase “to the extent
provided in section 144B of the Act” in the Scheme is with reference to only making
assessment or reassessment or total income or loss of the assessee. Therefore, for the
purposes of making assessment or reassessment, the provisions of section 144B of the
Act would be applicable as no such manner for reassessment is separately provided in
the Scheme. For issuing notice, the term “to the extent provided in section 144B of
the Act” is not relevant. The Scheme provides that the notice under section 148 of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/36406891/ 35
Mark Studio India Private Limited vs Income Tax Officer on 20 December, 2024
Act, shall be issued through automated allocation, in accordance with risk
management strategy formulated by the Board as referred to in section 148 of the Act
and in a faceless manner. Therefore, “to the extent provided in section 144B of the
Act” does not go with issuance of notice https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc. and is applicable only with reference to assessment or
reassessment. The phrase “to the extent provided in section 144B of the Act” would
mean that the restriction provided in section 144B of the Act, such as keeping the
International Tax Jurisdiction or Central Circle Jurisdiction out of the ambit of
section 144B of the Act would also apply under the Scheme.
Further the exceptions provided in sub-sections (7) and (8) of section 144B of the Act would also be
applicable to the Scheme.
37. When an authority acts contrary to law, the said act of the authority is required to be quashed
and set aside as invalid and bad in law and the person seeking to quash such an action is not
required to establish prejudice from the said Act. An act which is done by an authority contrary to
the provisions of the statue, itself causes prejudice to the assessee. All assessees are entitled to be
assessed as per law and by following the procedure prescribed by law. Therefore, when the
Income-tax authority proposes to take action against an assessee without following the due process
of law, the said action itself results in a prejudice to the assessee. Therefore, there is no question of
the petitioner having to prove further prejudice before arguing the invalidity of the notice.”
52. In the above case, the Hon'ble Bombay High Court has also held
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc. that for making assessment,
reassessment or re-computation under Section 147 of the IT Act, the notice under Section 148 of the
IT Act shall be issued in faceless manner. Further, in the above case, it came to conclusion that the
Section 148 notice was not sent by the respondents in faceless manner. On the other hand, as stated
above, in the present case, this Court has already elaborately discussed as to how the Section 148
notice was send in faceless manner in due compliance of the provisions of the Scheme. However, the
Bombay High Court has no occasion deal with the aforesaid aspect since the same was not brought
before the Hon'ble Division Bench of the Bombay High Court.
53. She has also referred to the judgment of the Hon'ble Gujarat High Court in Talati and Talati LLP
vs. Office of Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax reported in 2024: GUJHC: 54567-DB. The
relevant paragraphs, viz., paragraph Nos.22 to 28, 30 and 31 are extracted hereunder:
“(22) From a further reading of Explanation 1 and Explanation 2 attached to Section
148, it is clear that the provisions under Section 148 for issuance of notice before
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc. making assessment,
re-assessment or re-computation under Section 147 operate in two different ways.
For the purpose of Section 148, where Section 148A is applicable, Explanation 1
provides:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/36406891/ 36
Mark Studio India Private Limited vs Income Tax Officer on 20 December, 2024
(23) The provisions contained in Explanation 1 shows that the information with the
Assessing Officer for the purpose of Section 148, which suggests that the income
chargeable to tax has escaped assessment under the Explanation would mean:
(i) any information in the case of the assessee, for the relevant assessment year, in
accordance with the risk management strategy formulated by the Board from time to
time; or
(ii) any audit objection to the effect that the assessment in the case of the assessee for
the relevant assessment year has not been made in accordance with the provisions of
this Act; or
(iii) any information received under an agreement referred to in Section 90 or
Section 90A of the Act; or
(iv) any information made available to the Assessing Officer under the scheme
notified under Section 135A; or
(v) any information which requires action in consequence of the order of a Tribunal
or a Court. On the contrary, Explanation 2 which deals with the information received
during search and seizure operations under Section 132 requires fulfillment of
pre-requisites conditions, noted hereinbefore, in the submission of the learned
counsel appearing for the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024
etc. Revenue.
(24) The concept of Risk Management Strategy formulated by the Board is
incorporated in Clause (i) of Explanation 1, as also specified in Clause 3 of the
notification dated 29.03.2022 issued by the Central Government in accordance with
the provisions of Explanation 1 clause (i) to Section 148, which is not applicable in
the case of information received during the course of search and seizure under
Section (25) From the language employed in the Explanation 1 and Explanation 2 to
Section 148 of the Act' 1961, we reach at an opinion that the method of automated
allocation, i.e. for random allocation of cases through algorithm, or by using suitable
technological tools, including artificial intelligence and machine learning, in
accordance with risk management strategy formulated by the Board, as referred to in
Explanation 1 clause (i) to Section 148 of the Act, for issuance of notice under Section
148 in a faceless manner, as per the scheme framed vide notification dated
29.03.2022, cannot be applied to the case of Search and Seizure under Section 132,
where the Jurisdictional Assessing Officer (JAO) is required to record his satisfaction
on the basis of the material for affirmation of opinion in an honest and bona fide
manner.
(26) We find substance in the submission of the learned https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc. counsel for the Revenue that recording of satisfaction by the Assessing
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/36406891/ 37
Mark Studio India Private Limited vs Income Tax Officer on 20 December, 2024
Officer on a perusal of the information received by him as a result of search and seizure operation
under Section 132 of the Income Tax Act‘ 1961, requires application of human mind, inasmuch as,
reasons affirmed on the part of the Satisfaction Note may also become subject matter of scrutiny by
the Court in a case of challenge, where the Court in exercise of power of judicial review may examine
as to whether they are actuated by mala fides or passed on extraneous or irrelevant considerations.
(27) The decision of the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court in the case of Hexaware
Technologies Ltd. (supra) has been rendered in a case, which falls within the arena of Explanation 1
to Section 148 and not where Explanation 2 to Section 148 of the Income Tax Act' 1961, would be
attracted.
(28) From the above, by reading all the relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act' 1961 as also the
notification dated 29.03.2022 issued by the Central Government framing scheme for "EAssessment
of Income Escaping Assessment"
under sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 151 A of the Act' 1961, we reach at an
irresistible conclusion that the challenge to the notice under Section 148 dated
22.03.2024 for A.Y. 2021
- 2022 on the sole premise that the said notice could have been issued only through
automated allocation in faceless manner https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc. and not by Jurisdictional Assessing Officer (JAO),
cannot be sustained.
(29) .............
(30) Moreover, Section 151A contemplates framing of the scheme by the Central
Government by notification in the official Gazette, even for the purpose of issuance of
notice under Section 148 in the case of re-assessment or sanction for issue of such
notice under Section 151, with the aim to impart greater efficiency, transparency and
accountability by eliminating the interface between the income tax authority and the
assessee or any other person to the extent technologically feasible.
(31) The feasibility of implying technology for the process, therefore, would be
relevant. There may be a situation, where a scheme may be framed by the Central
Government for issuance of the notice under Section 148 even in the case of Search
and Seizure under Section 132 of the Act' 1961, so as to meet out the expectations of
the legislature under Section 151A, to impart greater efficiency, transparency and
accountability by applying artificial intelligence, technological innovations, etc., but
as of now, from a careful reading of the notification dated 29.03.2022, along with the
statutory provisions, we find that the aforesaid notification does not cover a case
where notice under Section 148 is issued by the Jurisdictional
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc. Assessing Officer
(JAO) the information received by him in the matter of Search and Seizure under
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/36406891/ 38
Mark Studio India Private Limited vs Income Tax Officer on 20 December, 2024
Section 132 of the Act' 1961, or requisitioned under Section 132A.”
54. In the above said judgment, it was elaborately discussed with regard to the
making of assessment, re-assessment or re-computation along with issuance of notice
under Section 148 or 148A of the IT Act shall be made by following the procedure laid
down under Section 144B of the IT Act. However, this Court has already elaborately
discussed about the situation, where Section 148 or 148A shall be sent in faceless
manner and also the stage when the assessment, reassessment or re-computation
under Section 144B of the IT Act will commence in detail, but the Hon'ble Division
Bench of Gujarat High Court had no occasion to deal with the same.
55. Dr.B.Ramaswamy, learned Senior Standing counsel has referred the judgment of
Hon'ble Delhi High Court in T.K.S.Builders Private Limited vs. Income Tax Officer
rendered in W.P.(C).No.1968 of 2023. The https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc. relevant paragraphs, viz., paragraph Nos.99 to 103 are
extracted hereunder:
“99. Returning then to the Faceless Reassessment Scheme 2022 itself, we find
sufficient merit in the interpretation of its clauses as has been commended for our
consideration by the respondents. Clause 3 of the said scheme provides that
assessment, reassessment or recomputation under Section 147 of the Act as well as
issuance of notice under Section 148 would be through automated allocation in
accordance with the risk management strategy and in a faceless manner. The
respondents rightly draw our attention to the usage of punctuation at various places
in Clause 3. A careful reading of that clause shows that the draftsman has used a
comma immediately after the phrase “shall be through automated allocation”. Yet
another comma appears after the phrase “for issuance of notice”. It thus appears to
have been the clear intent of the author to separate and segregate the phases of
initiation of action in accordance with RMS, the formation of opinion whether
circumstances warrant action under Section 148 of the Act being undertaken by
issuance of notice and the actual undertaking of assessment itself.
100. Beyond the specific use of punctuation within Clause 3, a comprehensive
reading of the Faceless Reassessment Scheme 2022, supported by the extensive
material presented by the respondents, bolsters the clear intent
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc. underlying each phase
of the faceless assessment process.
101. As we had noticed in the preceding parts of this decision, the RMS and the
Insight Portal pushes information to the JAO and is principally not concerned with
faceless assessment at all. The RMS essentially enables the JAO to firstly examine the
veracity of disclosures made and examine the return against various parameters and
information which has been collated by the Directorate of Systems. It thus provides
the JAO with an insight in respect of various transactions to which the assessee may
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/36406891/ 39
Mark Studio India Private Limited vs Income Tax Officer on 20 December, 2024
be connected as well as data pertaining to that assessee which has otherwise been
aggregated and mapped on the basis of material existing on the system of the
respondents. The respondents would, therefore, appear to be correct in their
submission that when material comes to be placed in the hands of the JAO by the
RMS, it would consequently be entitled to initiate the process of reassessment by
following the procedure prescribed under Section 148A. If after consideration of the
objections that are preferred, it stands firm in its opinion that income was likely to
have escaped assessment, it would transmit the relevant record to the NFAC. It is at
that stage and on receipt of the said material by NFAC that the concepts of automated
allocation and faceless distribution would come into play. The actual assessment
would thus be conducted in a faceless manner and https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc. in accordance with an allocation that the NFAC would
make.
This, in our considered opinion, would be the only legally sustainable construction liable to be
accorded to the scheme. Our conclusion would thus strike a harmonious balance between the
evaluation of information made available to an AO, the preliminary consideration of information for
the purposes of formation of opinion and its ultimate assessment in a faceless manner.
102. We are also, in this regard, guided by the principles of beneficial construction and thus
avoiding an interpretation that would render portions of the Act or the Faceless Assessment Scheme
superfluous or ineffective should be avoided//. To assert that the JAO‘s powers become redundant
under the faceless assessment framework would conflict with beneficial construction, as it would
undermine provisions specifically established to support comprehensive data analysis and informed
decision-making, such as the JAO‘s access to RMS and Insight Portal information.
103. We are fully cognizant of the contrarian view which was expressed in this respect in Hexaware
Technologies and which stands reflected in para 36 of the report which has been extracted
hereinabove. However, for reasons assigned in the preceding parts of this decision, we find
ourselves unable to concur with the interpretation accorded by the Bombay High
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc. Court upon Clause 3 of the Faceless
Reassessment Scheme 2022. As was noted by us earlier, Clause 3 clearly contemplates the initial
enquiry and formation of opinion to reassess being part of one defined process followed by actual
assessment in a faceless manner. It thus divides the process of reassessment into two stages and
when viewed in that light it is manifest that it strikes a just balance between the obligation of the
JAO to scrutinise information and the conduct of assessment itself through a faceless allocation. The
distribution of functions between the JAO and NFAC is complimentary and concurrent as
contemplated under the various schemes and the statutory provisions. This balanced distribution
underscores the legislative intent to create a seamless integration of traditional and faceless
assessment mechanisms within a unified statutory framework. This we so hold and observe since we
have, principally, been unable to countenance a situation where the JAO stands completely deprived
of the jurisdiction to evaluate data and material that may be placed in its hands”

Mark Studio India Private Limited vs Income Tax Officer on 20 December, 2024
56. Upon reading the above judgment, this Court is inclined to follow the above findings of the
Hon'ble Division Bench of the Delhi High Court, since the above findings are in line with the
findings of this Court.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc.
57. Assessment, re-assessment or re-computation:
As far as the assessment, re-assessment or re-computation is concerned, this Court is
of the considered view that both the Faceless Assessment Officer as well as the
Jurisdictional Assessment Officer will have concurrent jurisdiction for the following
reasons:
(a) As far as the international taxation, Central Circle Charges and search and seizure
cases are concerned, it has been specified only for the JAO. In such case, the FAO will
not have any jurisdiction to make assessment, re-assessment or re-computation.
(b) The Scheme provides only with regard to the Automated Allocation System in
accordance with the risk management strategy formulated by the Board from time to
time, which shall be made in faceless manner. At this juncture, it would be apposite
to extract Explanation (1)(i) to (v) to Section 148 of the IT Act, which reads as
follows:
“Explanation 1. For the purposes of this section and section 148A, the information
with the Assessing Officer which https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of
2024 etc. suggests that the income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment means,-
(i) any information in the case of the assessee for the relevant assessment year in
accordance with the risk management strategy formulated by the Board from time to
time;
(ii) any audit objection to the effect that the assessment in the case of the assessee for
the relevant assessment year has not been made in accordance with the provisions of
this Act; or
(iii) any information received under an agreement referred to in section 90 or section
90A of the Act; or
(iv) any information made available to the Assessing Officer under the scheme
notified under section 135A; or
(v) any information which requires action in consequence of the order of a Tribunal
or a Court.”
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/36406891/ 41
Mark Studio India Private Limited vs Income Tax Officer on 20 December, 2024
(c) The Clause (i) of Explanation (1) deals on the aspect of income escaped
assessment, means any information of the assessee for the relevant assessment year
in accordance with the risk management strategy formulated by the Board from time
to time. Therefore, except the clause (i) https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc. of Explanation (1), the Scheme has not mentioned
anything about the faceless assessment of the categories mentioned at Clause (ii) to
(v) of Explanation (1). Hence, all the other categories mentioned in Clause (ii) to
(v) of Explanation (1) of Section 148 of the IT Act shall not be made in accordance
with the Scheme. Therefore, it is clear that the Scheme was framed to cover the
category of information as mentioned in Clause (i) of Explanation (1), for which the
assessment, reassessment or recomputation shall be conducted in faceless manner.
(d) Section 144B(2) of the IT Act has empowered the Board to specify the territorial
area, persons or class of persons, income or class of income, or cases or class of cases,
which shall be made in faceless manner.
In all the other cases, where the Board has not specified anything or specified other than by faceless
manner, the assessment shall be conducted in any manner, other than the faceless manner, by the
concerned JAO.
(e) In terms of Sub-Section 7(a)(ii) and (8) of Section 144B of the IT Act, the Principal Chief
Commissioner or Principal Director General (in-
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc. charge of NaFAC), as the case may
be, at any stage of the assessment, if considered necessary, shall transfer the cases to the Assessing
Officer having jurisdiction over such cases with the prior approval of the Board.
(f) For the aforesaid reasons, this Court has arrived at a conclusion that in terms of the provisions of
the IT Act, the assessment, re-assessment or re-computation shall be conducted by both the FAO as
well as JAO as they have concurrent jurisdiction.
58. In fine, to put it in a nutshell, this Court pass the following orders:
i) As far as the issuance of notice under Section 148 of the IT Act is concerned, only
the JAO will have exclusive jurisdiction.
ii) As far as the assessment, re-assessment or re-
computation in terms of the provisions of Section 147 of the IT Act is concerned, both the FAO as
well as the JAO will have concurrent jurisdiction.
iii) The Directorate of Income Tax (Systems) shall have the power to make allotment of cases,
through Automated Allocation https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.25223 of 2024 etc.

xii) The guidelines issued on 24.05.2023, by the Board, is well within the powers available to them,
in terms of the provisions of Sub-Section (2) of Section 144B of the IT Act and issuance of such
guidelines will not amount of making any modification, granting exemptions or adaptation of the
terms and conditions specified in the Schemes dated 28.03.2022 and 29.03.2022. The Board has
exercised the power only in terms of the provisions of Section 144B(2) of the IT Act and not in terms
of the provisions of Section 151A(2) of the IT Act. The proviso to Sub-Section (2) of Section 151A of
the IT Act deals with the aspect that the Central Government shall not issue any direction after
31.03.2022 to make any exemption, modification and adaptation with regard to the Schemes dated
28.03.2022 and 29.03.2022. In the present case, the guidelines issued in terms of Sub-Section (2) of
Section 144B of the IT Act will not amount to the directions issued by the Central Government in
terms of Sub- Section (2) of Section 151A of the IT Act.

151A of the IT Act read with its proviso, will be entirely different from the issuance of guidelines, by
the Board, with the power available in terms of Sub-Section (2) of Section 144B of the IT Act.
xiv) The provisions of Section 144B of the IT Act is both in the nature of substantive as well as
procedural.
