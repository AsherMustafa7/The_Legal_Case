CORAM: THE HON'BLE MR JUSTICE M.NAGAPRASANNA
CAV ORDER
The petitioners are at the doors of this Court yet again for the
third time seeking interference of this Court in exercise of its
jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1973.
2. Facts adumbrated are as follows:
(a) The petitioners were before this Court in Criminal
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187570074/ 3
Sri. Arjun Anjaneya Reddy vs State Of Karnataka on 25 June, 2025
Petition No.1372/2023. The entire facts are narrated while
disposing the said petition in terms of the order dated 16.06.2023.
I therefore, deem it appropriate to paraphrase the facts as narrated
therein.
"The 2nd respondent is the complainant and petitioners are
accused Nos. 1, 3 to 8. A complaint comes to be registered
against the petitioners and another by the 2nd respondent on
02-01-2023 alleging that the petitioners have all connived,
forged the signatures of the complainant and got several sale
deeds registered. A brief history to the complaint as narrated
is that on 04-12-2014 a Joint Development Agreement
('JDA' for short) comes to be executed between the 2nd
respondent/Ankamma Rao with M/s Mahidhara Projects
Private Limited ('the Company' for short), a Company
registered under the Companies Act. The Company later, on
the strength of JDA develops a layout in the name and style
of 'Mahidhara Fortune City' after obtaining all necessary
5
permissions from Anekal Development Authority. The
complainant further narrates that he along with other owners
of properties subsequently entered into a partition to
partition the remaining sites after the disposal, which fell to
the individual shares under the deed of partition dated
2-03-2021.
3. Thirteen properties are identified to be the
subject matter of the complaint, as in terms of the JDA
and the sharing agreement as well as the partition
deed, the properties ought to have been in the share
of the owner/complainant. The owner in order to
secure loan from SBICAP, by way of depositing of title
deeds, has mortgaged those 13 sites in favour of
SBICAP and has secured finance. After the said act,
the complainant comes to know that sale deeds are
executed of those 13 properties which are the subject
matter of loan that was secured from SBICAP on
depositing of title deeds. The properties were sold by
the Special Power of Attorney Holder one Chikka
Kondappa, an employee of the 1st petitioner without
consent, knowledge, authorization and by forging the
signatures of the owner of the properties and without
even mentioning the mode of payment. It is, therefore,
alleged that the 1st petitioner who is one of the
Directors of Bhoomika Infrabuild Private Limited along
with his children and other accused have all connived
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187570074/ 4
Sri. Arjun Anjaneya Reddy vs State Of Karnataka on 25 June, 2025
and conspired to cheat the complainant. Therefore, the
complainant seeks to register the complaint on 02-01-
2023. The complaint becomes a crime in Crime No.3 of
2023 for the offences aforementioned. Soon after
registration of crime, the petitioners knocked at the
doors of this Court with the present petition and a co-
ordinate Bench of this Court in terms of its order dated
17-02-2023 stayed further investigation into the
matter. The interim order is subsisting even as on
date."
(Emphasis supplied)

(b) Based on the said facts, complaint had been registered
against the petitioners for the offences punishable under Sections
417, 418, 420, 464, 465, 34 of IPC 1860 in Crime No.3/2023 of
Anekal Police Station, pending on the file of the Court of Principal
Civil Judge (Jr.Dn.) and JMFC, Anekal, Bengaluru Rural District. This
Court in terms of its order dated 16.06.2023 dismissed the petition
holding that the investigation in the least on the score of the
offences being prima facie met, the reasons so rendered while
rejecting the petition are as follows:
"8. The afore-narrated facts are not in dispute. The
matter is still at the stage of investigation, as registration of
crime has happened on 03-01-2023 and an interim order is
granted by this Court on 17-02-2023. Therefore, the
investigation has not proceeded any further. The relationship
between the complainant and the petitioners is that the 1st
petitioner is one of the Directors and other petitioners are
Directors of one Bhoomika Infrabuild Private Limited. In the
light of his association with Bhoomika Infrabuild Private
Limited, the complainant executes a Special Power of
Attorney in favour of Chikka Kondappa, accused No.2 who is
not before Court. Sri. Chikka Kondappa, on the strength of
Special Power of Attorney has executed several sale deeds in
favour of the 1st petitioner, one of the Directors of Bhoomika
Infrabuild Private Limited. In turn, accused No.1 has
executed several sale deeds in favour of petitioners 2 and 3/
Accused No.3 and 4 who are the children of petitioner No.1.
9. The history to the said transaction is execution of a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187570074/ 5
Sri. Arjun Anjaneya Reddy vs State Of Karnataka on 25 June, 2025
JDA between the complainant with M/s Mahidhara Projects
Private Limited to jointly develop the lands and share the
developed sites. In terms of the agreement, the complainant
7
and a few neighbouring land owners enter into a sharing
agreement on 04-12-2014. The Company developed the land
and formed layout with sites of various dimensions. Later
the complainant along with other land owners entered into a
partition deed to partition the remaining sites which had
fallen to the exclusive share of the complainant. The
partition deed was entered into on 02-03-2021. After the
JDA executed on 04-12-2014 and in furtherance of any
further transaction since the complainant was a resident of
Andhra Pradesh, the complainant had executed a Special
Power Attorney on 06-05-2015 in favour of accused No.2/Sri.
C.Kondappa who is not before the Court. The entire
submission of the learned counsel for the petitioners hinges
upon a clause in the Special Power of attorney and it reads
as follows:
"Accordingly the sale agreements, sale
deeds, so also Deeds of Rectification,
Supplemental Deeds, Declaratory Deeds etc. are
being drafted as per my instructions and I am
executing the same at all relevant times in the
presence of the purchasers, attesting witnesses
and my Power of Attorney Holder.
Whereas I am pre-occupied with several
commitments and I am unable to present
personally at all relevant times before the Sub-
Registrar, Attibele/Basavanagudi/ Banashankari,
Bangalore to admit execution of the sale deeds
and perform such other act/s or deed/s,
document/s for completion of the conveyance in
favour of the intending purchasers, which
includes execution of any other deeds of
conveyance of sale, so also Deeds, Agreements
granting easementary rights and also deeds of
sale conveying the plots in the lay-out to be
formed. However, I am intend to personally
execute the document and further I deem it fit
and necessary for to authorize my Special
Power of Attorney to represent me before the
Sub-Registrar for the purpose of completion of
registration in the afore-mentioned mattes and
perform all such act/s may be required for
8
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187570074/ 6
Sri. Arjun Anjaneya Reddy vs State Of Karnataka on 25 June, 2025
fulfillment of the aforementioned object and
intent of this POWER OF ATTORNEY."
The afore-quoted clause in the Special Power of Attorney
indicates that the complainant cannot be personally present
to execute any document and, therefore, for the completion
of conveyance in favour of intending purchasers the power of
attorney holder was permitted to execute documents i.e.,
register the same before the concerned Registering
Authority. It is alleged that on the strength of special power
attorney, several transactions have taken place.
10. The 1st petitioner has sold sites that had fallen to
the share of the complainant to petitioners 2 and 3/accused
3 and 4. The sites that are sold, by accused No.1 are
already mortgaged to the Bank/SBICAP for the purpose of
raising of finance by the complainant. Therefore, the title
deeds are all deposited before the Bank. The complainant
comes to know that despite the properties being mortgaged
to the Bank, those very properties are sold by way of several
registered sale deeds and the purchasers are the children of
the 1st petitioner/accused No.1. It is then the complaint
comes to be registered by the complainant. The complaint
insofar as it is necessary to be noticed reads as follows:
"I state that I had executed SPA dated 06th
may 2015 to Mr.Chikka Kondappa, registered in
the office of Sub Registrar of Basavangudi
(Banashankari), Vide Document No. BNG(U)BSK

executed/signed by me before the concerned
authority for registration and granted other

December 2022 at Bangalore and registered in
the office of Sub Registrar of Basavangudi

of Book I in the office of the Sub Registrar,
Anekal, Bengaluru, to which Papaiah
Anjaneya Reddy was a witness. As part of
SBICAP Trustee Company Limited
requirement to check EC annually, I have
checked the same and to my utter shock
and dismay the above-mentioned
properties were sold vide various sale
deeds by the SPA holder Chikka Kondappa
(an employee of Papaiah Anjaneya Reddy)
without my consent, knowledge,
authorization and have used forged
documents (Forged my signatures) to dupe
the concerned authorities. I further looked
at the forged sale deeds and even the
payment mode is not mentioned, no
particulars of how the payment was made
to acquire such sale is not mentioned and
was clearly scripted by simply paying
challan amounts without any sale
considerations, to create a dispute and
legal hassle.
I, B.Ankamma Rao, and Papaiah Anjaneya
Reddy are the Directors of Bhoomika
Infrabuild Private Limited. Articles of
Association attached. Due to my
association in Bhoomika Infrabuild Private

(Emphasis added)
12
It is upon the said complaint, the crime in crime No.3 of
2023 comes to be registered for the afore-quoted offences.
The offences are the ones punishable for cheating and
forgery inter alia.
11. The contention of the petitioners is that the issue is
purely civil in nature and therefore, investigation should not
be permitted to be continued. The allegation of the
complainant is that signatures of the complainant have been
forged which is demonstrable on the very look of the
documents, as also the contents of the sale deeds. As an
illustration, the sale deed alleged to have been executed on
18-03-2022 in favour of the 4th petitioner/accused No.5
requires to be noticed. It reads as follows:
"NOW THIS DEED OF ABSOLUTE SALE
WITHNESSETH AS FOLLOWS:
1. The total sale consideration of Rs.24,20,000/- (Rupees
Twenty-Four Lakhs Twenty Thousand Only) is paid by
the Purchaser/s to the Vendor/s which payment the
Vendor/s hereby jointly admit and acknowledge as
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187570074/ 10
Sri. Arjun Anjaneya Reddy vs State Of Karnataka on 25 June, 2025
proper and sufficient consideration, the Vendor/s
hereby grant, convey, transfer, assign and assure
unto the use of the Purchaser/s herein, the
"Schedule"B"Property" together with all easements
and appurtenances thereto, to the Purchaser/s herein,
to have and hold the same forever."
The total sale consideration of the property mentioned is
`24,20,000/-. It reads that it is paid by the purchaser to the
vendor who is the complainant. The mode of payment and
date of payment are not even mentioned in the sale deed
which are necessary concomitants to be present in a sale
deed to be executed between the parties. Another sale deed
is also appended to the petition which has the same amount
and the same narration. This is executed in favour of
petitioner No.6/accused No.7. Likewise all the sale deeds
contain same contents. There is not an iota of difference in
the disputed sale deeds. This Court in order to consider the
submission of the 2nd respondent/complainant that the sale
deed did not contain any amount, summoned other sale
deeds executed by the complainant which have been
13
produced for perusal by this Court. One of the sale deed
executed by the complainant in favour of the Company reads
as follows:
"NOW THIS DEED OF ABSOLUTE SALE
WITNESSETH AS FOLLOWS:
1. The total sale consideration of Rs.12,00,000/-
(Rupees Twelve Lakhs Only) is paid by the
Purchaser/s to the Vendor/s as under,
i. An amount of Rs.2,00,000/- (Rupees Two Lakhs
only), by way of Cheque bearing No.988829,
Drawn on State Bank of India, Yelahanka
Branch, Bengaluru, in favour of the confirming
party as instructed by the Vendor,
ii. An amount of Rs.4,97,200/- (Rupees Four Lakhs
Ninty Seven Thousands and Two Hundred Only),
by way of Cheque bearing No.988841, Drawn on
State Bank of India, Yelahanka Branch,
Bengaluru, in favour of the Vendor.
iii. The balance amount being the loan amount
sanctioned by AXIS BANK to the Purchaser/s
vide Cheque/DD No.156570, Dated 01.07.2015,
Drawn on AXIS BANK Bank, Branch, at the
request and authorization of the Purchaser/s

and paid this day to the vendor/s at the time of
registration of this Absolute Sale Deed."
(Emphasis added)
If the sale deeds that are the subject matter of the complaint
is juxtaposed with what are produced by the learned senior
counsel for the 2nd respondent, what would unmistakably
emerge is a serious dispute with regard to execution of sale
deeds.
12. The other circumstance that would require a
detailed investigation is that these very properties are
said to be subject matter of mortgage before the Bank
and all the necessary title deeds are deposited before
the Bank. This is a fact, that is not in dispute. If all the
title deeds of the disputed property were deposited
before the Bank, on what strength the sale deed is
executed is yet another factor that requires to be
14
thrashed out. These are all in the realm of seriously
disputed questions of fact. If the complainant had
deposited title deeds with SBICAP, he could not have
sold the properties in favour of several accused after
executing a Special Power of Attorney in favour of
accused No.2. Therefore, these seriously disputed
questions of fact, it is for the petitioners to come out
clean in a full blown proceeding.
13. The submission of the learned counsel appearing for the
petitioners that it is purely a matter which is civil in nature
and, therefore, this Court should not interfere in the light of
plethora of judgments of the Apex Court, holding that civil
proceedings which are given a colour of crime, should be
interfered and the proceedings should be nipped in the bud, is
unacceptable, as those judgments are inapplicable to the
facts of the case. In the light of what is narrated
hereinabove, it is germane to notice the judgment of the
Apex Court in the case of KAMAL SHIVAJI POKARNEKAR
v. STATE OF MAHARASHTRA AND OTHERS, (2019) 14
SCC 350 wherein the Apex Court has held as follows:
"5. Quashing the criminal proceedings is called for
only in a case where the complaint does not disclose
any offence, or is frivolous, vexatious, or oppressive.
If the allegations set out in the complaint do not
constitute the offence of which cognizance has been
taken by the Magistrate, it is open to the High Court
to quash the same. It is not necessary that a
meticulous analysis of the case should be done before
the trial to find out whether the case would end in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187570074/ 12
Sri. Arjun Anjaneya Reddy vs State Of Karnataka on 25 June, 2025
conviction or acquittal. If it appears on a reading of
the complaint and consideration of the allegations
therein, in the light of the statement made on oath
that the ingredients of the offence are disclosed, there
would be no justification for the High Court to
interfere [State of Karnataka v. M. Devendrappa,
(2002) 3 SCC 89 : 2002 SCC (Cri) 539] .
6. Defences that may be available, or facts/aspects
which when established during the trial, may lead to
acquittal, are not grounds for quashing the complaint
at the threshold. At that stage, the only question
relevant is whether the averments in the complaint
spell out the ingredients of a criminal offence or not
15
[Indian Oil Corpn. v. NEPC (India) Ltd., (2006) 6 SCC
736 : (2006) 3 SCC (Cri) 188] .
7. Relying upon the aforementioned judgments of this
Court, Mr M.N. Rao, learned Senior Counsel appearing
for the appellant submitted that the High Court acted
in excess of its jurisdiction in setting aside the order
of the trial court by which process for summoning the
accused was issued. He further submitted that the
evaluation of the merits of the allegations made on
either side cannot be resorted to at this stage.
8. Mr R. Basant, learned Senior Counsel
appearing for Respondents 2 to 6 and 8 to 11
submitted that a proper evaluation of the
material on record would disclose that the
complaint is frivolous. He submitted that the
dispute is essentially of a civil nature and the
ingredients of the offences that are alleged
against the respondent are not made out. By
making the above statement, Mr Basant
commended to this Court that there is no
warrant for interference with the judgment of
the High Court.
9. Having heard the learned Senior Counsel and
examined the material on record, we are of the
considered view that the High Court ought not to
have set aside the order passed by the trial
court issuing summons to the respondents. A
perusal of the complaint discloses prima facie,
offences that are alleged against the
respondents. The correctness or otherwise of
the said allegations has to be decided only in the
trial. At the initial stage of issuance of process it
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187570074/ 13
Sri. Arjun Anjaneya Reddy vs State Of Karnataka on 25 June, 2025
is not open to the courts to stifle the
proceedings by entering into the merits of the
contentions made on behalf of the accused.
Criminal complaints cannot be quashed only on
the ground that the allegations made therein
appear to be of a civil nature. If the ingredients
of the offence alleged against the accused are
prima facie made out in the complaint, the
criminal proceeding shall not be interdicted."
(Emphasis supplied)
16
The Apex Court holds that if prima facie allegations are
made, the Court exercising its jurisdiction under Section 482
of the Cr.P.C., should not interfere merely because what is
projected is that it is a matter which is purely civil in nature.
The said judgment would become applicable to the facts of
the case on all fours, as the complaint registered by the 2nd
respondent gives minute details of the alleged acts of the
accused and those minutes details are supported by
documents produced by the 2nd respondent. Therefore, in the
teeth of the facts being in the realm of seriously disputed
questions of fact, reference being made to the judgment of
the Apex Court in the case of KAPTAN SINGH v. STATE OF
UTTAR PRADESH (2021) 9 SCC 35 becomes apposite,
wherein the Apex Court holds as follows:
"9.1. At the outset, it is required to be
noted that in the present case the High Court in
exercise of powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C.,,
has quashed the criminal proceedings for the
offences under Sections 147, 148, 149, 406, 329
and 386 IPC. It is required to be noted that when
the High Court in exercise of powers under
Section 482 Cr.P.C.,, quashed the criminal
proceedings, by the time the investigating officer
after recording the statement of the witnesses,
statement of the complainant and collecting the
evidence from the incident place and after taking
statement of the independent witnesses and
even statement of the accused persons, has filed
the charge-sheet before the learned Magistrate
for the offences under Sections 147, 148, 149,
406, 329 and 386 IPC and even the learned
Magistrate also took the cognizance. From the
impugned judgment and order [Radhey Shyam
Gupta v. State of U.P., 2020 SCC OnLine All 914]
passed by the High Court, it does not appear that the
High Court took into consideration the material
collected during the investigation/inquiry and even the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187570074/ 14
Sri. Arjun Anjaneya Reddy vs State Of Karnataka on 25 June, 2025
statements recorded. If the petition under Section
482 Cr.P.C.,, was at the stage of FIR in that case
the allegations in the FIR/complaint only are
required to be considered and whether a
cognizable offence is disclosed or not is required
to be considered. However, thereafter when the
statements are recorded, evidence is collected
17
and the charge-sheet is filed after conclusion of
the investigation/inquiry the matter stands on
different footing and the Court is required to
consider the material/evidence collected during
the investigation. Even at this stage also, as
observed and held by this Court in a catena of
decisions, the High Court is not required to go into the
merits of the allegations and/or enter into the merits of
the case as if the High Court is exercising the appellate
jurisdiction and/or conducting the trial. As held by this
Court in Dineshbhai Chandubhai Patel [Dineshbhai
Chandubhai Patel v. State of Gujarat, (2018) 3 SCC
104 : (2018) 1 SCC (Cri) 683] in order to examine as
to whether factual contents of FIR disclose any
cognizable offence or not, the High Court cannot act
like the investigating agency nor can exercise the
powers like an appellate court. It is further observed
and held that that question is required to be examined
keeping in view, the contents of FIR and prima facie
material, if any, requiring no proof. At such stage,
the High Court cannot appreciate evidence nor
can it draw its own inferences from contents of
FIR and material relied on. It is further observed
it is more so, when the material relied on is
disputed. It is further observed that in such a
situation, it becomes the job of the investigating
authority at such stage to probe and then of the
court to examine questions once the charge-
sheet is filed along with such material as to how
far and to what extent reliance can be placed on
such material.
9.2. In Dhruvaram Murlidhar Sonar [Dhruvaram
Murlidhar Sonar v. State of Maharashtra, (2019) 18
SCC 191 : (2020) 3 SCC (Cri) 672] after considering
the decisions of this Court in Bhajan Lal [State of
Haryana v. Bhajan Lal, 1992 Supp (1) SCC 335 : 1992
SCC (Cri) 426] , it is held by this Court that exercise of
powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C.,, to quash the
proceedings is an exception and not a rule. It is further
observed that inherent jurisdiction under Section 482
Cr.P.C.,, though wide is to be exercised sparingly,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187570074/ 15
Sri. Arjun Anjaneya Reddy vs State Of Karnataka on 25 June, 2025
carefully and with caution, only when such exercise is
justified by tests specifically laid down in the section
itself. It is further observed that appreciation of
evidence is not permissible at the stage of quashing of
proceedings in exercise of powers under Section 482
18
Cr.P.C., Similar view has been expressed by this Court
in Arvind Khanna [CBI v. Arvind Khanna, (2019) 10
SCC 686 : (2020) 1 SCC (Cri) 94] , Managipet [State
of Telangana v. Managipet, (2019) 19 SCC 87 : (2020)
3 SCC (Cri) 702] and in XYZ [XYZ v. State of Gujarat,
(2019) 10 SCC 337 : (2020) 1 SCC (Cri) 173] ,
referred to hereinabove.
9.3. Applying the law laid down by this Court in
the aforesaid decisions to the facts of the case on
hand, we are of the opinion that the High Court has
exceeded its jurisdiction in quashing the criminal
proceedings in exercise of powers under Section 482
Cr.P.C.,
10. The High Court has failed to appreciate and
consider the fact that there are very serious triable
issues/allegations which are required to be gone into
and considered at the time of trial. The High Court has
lost sight of crucial aspects which have emerged during
the course of the investigation. The High Court has
failed to appreciate and consider the fact that the
document i.e. a joint notarised affidavit of Mamta
Gupta Accused 2 and Munni Devi under which
according to Accused 2 Ms Mamta Gupta, Rs 25 lakhs
was paid and the possession was transferred to her
itself is seriously disputed. It is required to be noted
that in the registered agreement to sell dated 27-10-
2010, the sale consideration is stated to be Rs 25 lakhs
and with no reference to payment of Rs 25 lakhs to Ms
Munni Devi and no reference to handing over the
possession. However, in the joint notarised affidavit of
the same date i.e. 27-10-2010 sale consideration is
stated to be Rs 35 lakhs out of which Rs 25 lakhs is
alleged to have been paid and there is a reference to
transfer of possession to Accused 2. Whether Rs 25
lakhs has been paid or not the accused have to
establish during the trial, because the accused are
relying upon the said document and payment of Rs 25
lakhs as mentioned in the joint notarised affidavit
dated 27-10-2010. It is also required to be considered
that the first agreement to sell in which Rs 25 lakhs is
stated to be sale consideration and there is reference
to the payment of Rs 10 lakhs by cheques. It is a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187570074/ 16
Sri. Arjun Anjaneya Reddy vs State Of Karnataka on 25 June, 2025
registered document. The aforesaid are all triable
issues/allegations which are required to be considered
19
at the time of trial. The High Court has failed to notice
and/or consider the material collected during the
investigation.
11. Now so far as the finding recorded by the
High Court that no case is made out for the offence
under Section 406 IPC is concerned, it is to be noted
that the High Court itself has noted that the joint
notarised affidavit dated 27-10-2010 is seriously
disputed, however as per the High Court the same is
required to be considered in the civil proceedings.
There the High Court has committed an error. Even the
High Court has failed to notice that another FIR has
been lodged against the accused for the offences under
Sections 467, 468, 471 IPC with respect to the said
alleged joint notarised affidavit. Even according to the
accused the possession was handed over to them.
However, when the payment of Rs 25 lakhs as
mentioned in the joint notarised affidavit is seriously
disputed and even one of the cheques out of 5 cheques
each of Rs 2 lakhs was dishonoured and according to
the accused they were handed over the possession
(which is seriously disputed) it can be said to be
entrustment of property. Therefore, at this stage to
opine that no case is made out for the offence under
Section 406 IPC is premature and the aforesaid aspect
is to be considered during trial. It is also required to be
noted that the first suit was filed by Munni Devi and
thereafter subsequent suit came to be filed by the
accused and that too for permanent injunction only.
Nothing is on record that any suit for specific
performance has been filed. Be that as it may, all the
aforesaid aspects are required to be considered at the
time of trial only.
12. Therefore, the High Court has grossly
erred in quashing the criminal proceedings by
entering into the merits of the allegations as if
the High Court was exercising the appellate
jurisdiction and/or conducting the trial. The High
Court has exceeded its jurisdiction in quashing
the criminal proceedings in exercise of powers
under Section 482 Cr.P.C.,
13. Even the High Court has erred in observing
that original complaint has no locus. The aforesaid
20
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187570074/ 17
Sri. Arjun Anjaneya Reddy vs State Of Karnataka on 25 June, 2025
observation is made on the premise that the
complainant has not placed on record the power of
attorney along with the counter filed before the High
Court. However, when it is specifically stated in the FIR
that Munni Devi has executed the power of attorney
and thereafter the investigating officer has conducted
the investigation and has recorded the statement of
the complainant, accused and the independent
witnesses, thereafter whether the complainant is
having the power of attorney or not is to be considered
during trial.
14. In view of the above and for the reasons
stated above, the impugned judgment and order
[Radhey Shyam Gupta v. State of U.P., 2020 SCC
OnLine All 914] passed by the High Court quashing the
criminal proceedings in exercise of powers under
Section 482 Cr.P.C., is unsustainable and the same
deserves to be quashed and set aside and is
accordingly quashed and set aside. Now, the trial is to
be conducted and proceeded further in accordance with
law and on its own merits. It is made clear that the
observations made by this Court in the present
proceedings are to be treated to be confined to the
proceedings under Section 482 Cr.P.C., only and the
trial court to decide the case in accordance with law
and on its own merits and on the basis of the evidence
to be laid and without being influenced by any of the
observations made by us hereinabove. The present
appeal is accordingly allowed."
(Emphasis supplied)
In the light of the aforesaid judgment, interfering with
further investigation or proceedings would become contrary
to law. There may be scores and scores of criminal cases
being set into motion on issues which are purely civil in
nature, breach of agreements or recovery of money and there
may be scores and scores of cases where the allegation made
is prima facie met in the complaints. Therefore, interference
under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C., would be, on a case to case
basis as the facts obtaining in each case would be different,
for such interference. The facts obtaining in the case at hand
would clearly indicate that it would require a full blown trial
and the investigation in the matter is yet to complete.
21
14. Insofar as the judgments relied on by the learned
counsel for the petitioners, there can be no qualm about the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187570074/ 18
Sri. Arjun Anjaneya Reddy vs State Of Karnataka on 25 June, 2025
principles so laid down by the Apex Court in the case of
VIJAY KUMAR GHAI and even in plethora of cases, but
those are distinguishable on facts obtaining in the case at
hand without much ado. It is not a case where an issue which
is purely civil in nature is given a colour of crime. The case at
hand is an issue which is prima facie criminal in nature
dressed with the same colour of crime. It would require
further proceedings.
15. For the aforesaid reasons, I pass the following:
ORDER
(i) Criminal Petition is dismissed.
(ii) However, it is made clear that the observations made in the course of the order are only for the
purpose of consideration of the case of petitioners under Section 482 of Cr.P.C., and the same shall
not bind or influence the proceedings pending before the trial Court or any other fora.
Consequently, I.A.No.2 of 2023 also stands disposed."
(Emphasis supplied) The dismissal of the said petition has become final.
(c) The petitioners again knocked at the doors of this Court in Criminal Petition No.9078/2024, this
time calling in question an order of the concerned Court by which the Court, takes cognizance of the
afore-quoted offences against the petitioners. This occasion, the contention was that the order of
taking of cognizance suffered from vice of application of mind. This Court accepts the plea, and
passes an order allowing the petition in part. The reasons so rendered to allow the said petition in
part are as follows:
""Here again, the Apex Court considers entire spectrum of law and all the judgments
that the learned senior counsel for the 2nd respondent has placed reliance upon and
would hold that application of judicial mind while taking cognizance and issuing
summons is imperative. The Apex Court was interpreting both cognizance under
Section 190(1)(b) and issuance of process under Section 204 of the Cr.P.C. The said
provisions read as follows:
"190. Cognizance of offences by Magistrates.-- (1) Subject to the provisions of this
Chapter, any Magistrate of the first class, and any Magistrate of the second class
specially empowered in this behalf under sub-section (2), may take cognizance of any
offence--
(a) upon receiving a complaint of facts which constitute such offence;
(b) upon a police report of such facts;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187570074/ 19
Sri. Arjun Anjaneya Reddy vs State Of Karnataka on 25 June, 2025
(c) upon information received from any person other than a police officer, or upon
his own knowledge, that such offence has been committed.
(2) The Chief Judicial Magistrate may empower any Magistrate of the second class to
take cognizance under sub-
section (1) of such offences as are within his competence to inquire into or try.
... ... ....
204. Issue of process.--(1) If in the opinion of a Magistrate taking cognizance of an offence there is
sufficient ground for proceeding, and the case appears to be--
(a) a summons-case, he shall issue his summons for the attendance of the accused, or
(b) a warrant-case, he may issue a warrant, or, if he thinks fit, a summons, for causing the accused to
be brought or to appear at a certain time before such Magistrate or (if he has no jurisdiction himself)
some other Magistrate having jurisdiction.
(2) No summons or warrant shall be issued against the accused under sub-section (1) until a list of
the prosecution witnesses has been filed.
(3) In a proceeding instituted upon a complaint made in writing, every summons or warrant issued
under sub- section (1) shall be accompanied by a copy of such complaint.
(4) When by any law for the time being in force any process-fees or other fees are payable, no
process shall be issued until the fees are paid and, if such fees are not paid within a reasonable time,
the Magistrate may dismiss the complaint.
(5) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to affect the provisions of Section 87."
Section 190(1)(a) deals with cognizance being taken on a complaint, which would be a private
complaint presented before the concerned Court. Section 190(1)(b) deals with cognizance taken on a
police report, which would be a final report/charge sheet filed before the concerned Court.
Therefore, cognizance can be taken only under Section 190 of the Cr.P.C. Section 204 deals with
issue of process.
13. After the concerned Court takes cognizance under Section 190 of the Cr.P.C., process is issued
under Section 204 Cr.P.C. Sub-section (1) thereof mandates that if in the opinion of the Magistrate
taking cognizance of an offence, there is sufficient ground for proceeding, it shall issue process.
Therefore, the words 'there is sufficient ground' assume importance. The necessity of recording
reasons for existence of sufficient ground is thus imperative, and those reasons are discernible only
if they are recorded in writing. It is only then such orders would reflect application of mind, on the
part of the Court, taking cognizance and issuing summons. Therefore, the judgments relied on by
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187570074/ 20
Sri. Arjun Anjaneya Reddy vs State Of Karnataka on 25 June, 2025
the learned senior counsel for the petitioners are all overwhelming, to the judgments relied on by
the learned senior counsel for the 2nd respondent, as all the judgments that are quoted hereinabove,
fallen from the arsenal of the learned senior counsel for the petitioners, are all of 2024 and consider
the very issue as against the judgments, which are little earlier cited by the learned senior counsel
for the 2nd respondent and the law as laid down by the Apex Court is that order of taking cognizance
and issuing summons, must bear application of mind.
14. With the law being thus, I now deem it appropriate to notice the order taking cognizance in the
case at hand. It reads as follows:
"ORDER Perused the charge sheet and all the documents submitted along with the
charge sheet by the investigating agency.
On perusal of the same, this court is satisfied at this stage that prima facie offence has
been committed by the accused as alleged.
The charge sheet and its enclosed papers satisfies that there exists sufficient
materials to proceed against the accused.
Therefore, cognizance is taken under Section 190(1) of CrPC for the offence
punishable under Section 418, 420, 464, 465, 120B r/w 34 IPC against the accused
persons.
Office to register the case as Criminal Cases in Register No.3 against the accused for
the offence punishable under Section 418, 420, 464, 465, 120B r/w 34 IPC and put
up.
Issue summons to accused by 11-07-2024."
The Court observes 'perused the charge sheet and all the documents'. On perusal of the same, the
Court is satisfied that prima facie offence has been committed by the accused as alleged. Therefore,
cognizance is taken under Section 190 (1)(b) and summons issued ostensibly under Section 204 of
the Cr.P.C. The order of taking cognizance and issuing of process does not bear even a semblance of
application of mind. It runs completely counter to the necessity under Section 190(1)(b) or Section
204 of the Cr.P.C. as elucidated by the Apex Court in the aforesaid judgments.
15. The learned senior counsel for the respondents submits that in 80% of cases, the Courts would
take cognizance in the same manner, while that would not impress this Court to dismiss the petition
and permit perpetration of irregularity or illegality by the concerned Court, just because it has
become a habit to take cognizance and issue summons in this manner. Not for nothing is the
elucidation by the Apex Court in regard to existence of sufficient grounds and application of judicial
mind. The Court is expected to record reasons for taking of cognizance. Though the reasons need
not be so elaborate like when it records framing of charges or conviction, nonetheless, it must bear
application of mind to set further proceedings into motion, as taking of cognizance or issuance of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187570074/ 21
Sri. Arjun Anjaneya Reddy vs State Of Karnataka on 25 June, 2025
process has some judicial sanctity. It cannot be a frolicsome act on the part of the learned
Magistrate/concerned Court, which would take cognizance and issue summons.
16. Therefore, it is made clear that the learned Magistrates/concerned Court who take cognizance
and issue process, shall henceforth follow the law laid down by the Apex Court as quoted
hereinabove and pass orders that would bear application of mind, failing which, the learned
Magistrates/concerned Court are contributing docket explosion in this Court, as every order of
taking cognizance and issuance of process is brought before this Court on the score that it does not
bear application of mind. Wherefore, the impugned order of taking cognizance is necessarily to be
obliterated and the matter remitted back to the hands of the learned Magistrate to redo the exercise
bearing in mind the observations made hereinabove.
17. For the aforesaid reasons, the following:
ORDER
(i) Criminal petition is allowed-in-part.
(ii) The order taking cognizance dated 04-04-2024 passed in C.C.No.2600 of 2024 by
the Principal Civil Judge and JMFC, Anekal stands quashed.
(iii) The matter is remitted back to the hands of the Principal Civil Judge and JMFC,
Anekal to redo the exercise of passing an order of taking cognizance and issuing
process, bearing in mind the observations made in the course of the order.
(iv) The aforesaid exercise shall be concluded within a period of four weeks' from the
date of receipt of a copy of this order.
(v) All other contentions except the one considered in the course of the order shall
remain open.
Pending applications, if any, also stand disposed."
(Emphasis supplied)
3. In terms of the afore-quoted order, the matter was remitted to the hands of the concerned Court
to pass necessary orders bearing in mind the observations made in the course of the order. Pursuant
to the order so passed by the Court, the concerned Court now takes cognizance of the offences. The
order of taking of cognizance reads as follows:
"The defacto complainant/CW1 lodged complaint before the SHO of Sarjapura PS
alleging that 13 sites as described in the complaint belongs to him. He mortgaged the
said 13 properties with SBICAP on 07- 10-2021. The accused No.1 was the witness of
said mortgage deed.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187570074/ 22
Sri. Arjun Anjaneya Reddy vs State Of Karnataka on 25 June, 2025
It is further alleged that accused No.3 & 4 are sons of accused No.1. Accused No.5 is
the brother of accused No.1. Accused No.2, 6, 7 & 8 are employees of accused No.1.
with criminal conspiracy and with an intention to cause wrongful loss to the defacto
complainant/CW1 forged the signature of CW1/defacto complainant by creating SPA
as his SPA holder is accused No.2 herein and the accused No.2 executed sale deeds in
respect of said 13 sites in favour of accused No.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and to the said sale
deeds the accused No.1, 5, 6, 7 were subscribed their signatures as witnesses.

Further, the witnesses as described in the charge-sheet are also deposed in support of prosecution
case in their statements recorded by the investigating officer U/s.161 of Cr.P.C. Further, the

accused No.3, 4, 5, 6, 7 & 8 by using alleged forged/created SPA in respect of aforesaid 13 sites and
produced the same along with FSL report in support of prosecution case.
In the circumstance, this court of the firm view that at this stage there are sufficient grounds for
proceeding against the accused for the aforesaid offences. Therefore, this court proceeds to pass the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187570074/ 23
Sri. Arjun Anjaneya Reddy vs State Of Karnataka on 25 June, 2025
following:

(Emphasis added)
4. The petitioners are again at the doors of the Court singing the same Swan song that formed the
fulcrum of the earlier lis that the order of the learned Magistrate suffers from want of application of
mind.
5. The learned Senior Counsel Sri.C.V.Nagesh would contend that the order of cognizance by the
concerned Court does not bear even a semblance of application of mind, as what the concerned
Court would do is copy and paste the summary of the charge sheet, so filed and then, on an
erroneous presumption, takes cognizance of the offences. He would contend that if the order of
cognizance suffers from the vice of non-application of mind, the only consequence would be
obliteration of the said order including the crime so registered as the cognizance is taken upon the
investigation report. Investigation report is filed upon a crime registered.
6. He would in-effect seek the quashment of the order by placing reliance upon two judgments of the
Apex Court which are rendered after the order passed by this Court, the second one in line. He
would seek to place reliance upon the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of S.C. GARG vs.
STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH, 2025 SCC OnLine SC 791 and JM LABORATORIES vs. STATE OF
ANDHRA PRADESH, 2025 SCC OnLine SC 208.
7. Per contra, the learned Senior Counsel Sri.Sandesh J Chouta representing the
respondent-complainant vehemently contend that the order of the learned Magistrate nowhere
suffers from non-application of mind. Petitioners-accused are repeatedly approaching this Court on
the same ground that is urged every time. This Court while dismissing the petition at the stage of
crime had clearly observed with regard to the nature of offences. He would contend that the offence
of forgery is writ large in the case at hand. The Forensic Science Laboratory report is clear that those
documents were not signed by the complainant; who has signed, is a matter of trial. He would also
seek to place reliance upon plethora of judgments rendered by the Apex Court which are as follows:
(i) STATE OF GUJARAT vs. AFROZ MOHAMMED
HASANFATTA, 2019 SCC OnLine SC 132.
(ii) PRADEEP S. WODEYAR vs. STATE OF KARNATAKA,

2021 SCC OnLine SC 1140.
(iii) PRAMILA DEVI AND OTHERS vs. STATE OF
JHARKHAND AND ANOTHER, 2025 SCC OnLine SC 886.
8. I have given my anxious consideration to the submissions made by the learned counsel for the
parties and have perused the material on record.
9. The only issue that is projected before this Court, now lies in a narrow compass, as to whether the
order of cognizance quoted supra suffers from want of application of mind.
10. Before considering the said issue, it is necessary to notice the judgments of the Apex Court which
elucidated the principle of application of mind or otherwise in an order of taking cognizance based
upon the police report and not on a complaint.
The earlier judgments need not be reiterated as it would only result in the bulk of the present order.
It would suffice if the later judgments bear consideration. The learned Senior Counsel for the
petitioners has placed heavy reliance on two judgments noted supra. In the two judgments, the Apex
Court has held as follows:
(i) JM LABORATORIES vs. STATE OF ANDHRA PRADESH, 2025 SCC OnLine SC 208 - para 8:
"8. In the judgment and order of even date in criminal appeal arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 2345 of
2024 titled "INOX Air Products Limited Now Known as INOX Air Products Private Limited v. The
State of Andhra Pradesh", we have observed thus:
"33. It could be seen from the aforesaid order that except recording the submissions
of the complainant, no reasons are recorded for issuing the process against the
accused persons.
34. In this respect, it will be relevant to refer to the following observations of this
Court in the case of Pepsi Foods Ltd. v. Special Judicial Magistrate (1998) 5 SCC 749
(supra):
"28. Summoning of an accused in a criminal case is a serious matter. Criminal law
cannot be set into motion as a matter of course. It is not that the complainant has to
bring only two witnesses to support his allegations in the complaint to have the
criminal law set into motion. The order of the Magistrate summoning the accused
must reflect that he has applied his mind to the facts of the case and the law
applicable thereto. He has to examine the nature of allegations made in the complaint
and the evidence both oral and documentary in support thereof and would that be
sufficient for the complainant to succeed in bringing charge home to the accused. It is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187570074/ 25
Sri. Arjun Anjaneya Reddy vs State Of Karnataka on 25 June, 2025
not that the Magistrate is a silent spectator at the time of recording of preliminary
evidence before summoning of the accused. The Magistrate has to carefully scrutinise
the evidence brought on record and may even himself put questions to the
complainant and his witnesses to elicit answers to find out the truthfulness of the
allegations or otherwise and then examine if any offence is prima facie committed by
all or any of the accused."
35. This Court has clearly held that summoning of an accused in a criminal case is a serious matter.
It has been held that the order of the Magistrate summoning the accused must reflect that he has
applied his mind to the facts of the case and the law applicable thereto. This Court held that the
Magistrate is required to examine the nature of allegations made in the complaint and the evidence,
both oral and documentary in support thereof and as to whether that would be sufficient for
proceeding against the accused. It has been held that the Magistrate is not a silent spectator at the
time of recording of preliminary evidence before summoning the accused.
36. The said law would be consistently following by this Court in a catena of judgments including in
the cases of Sunil Bharti Mittal v. Central Bureau of Investigation (2015) 4 SCC 609, Mehmood Ul
Rehman v. Khazir Mohammad Tunda (2015) 12 SCC 420 and Krishna Lal Chawla v. State of Uttar
Pradesh (2021) 5 SCC 435.
37. Recently, a Bench of this Court to which one of us (Gavai, J.) was a Member, in the case of
Lalankumar Singh v. State of Maharashtra 2022 SCC OnLine SC 1383 (supra), has observed thus:
"38. The order of issuance of process is not an empty formality. The Magistrate is required to apply
his mind as to whether sufficient ground for proceeding exists in the case or not. The formation of
such an opinion is required to be stated in the order itself. The order is liable to be set aside if no
reasons are given therein while coming to the conclusion that there is a prima facie case against the
accused. No doubt, that the order need not contain detailed reasons. A reference in this respect
could be made to the judgment of this Court in the case of Sunil Bharti Mittal v. Central Bureau of
Investigation9, which reads thus:
"51. On the other hand, Section 204 of the Code deals with the issue of process, if in
the opinion of the Magistrate taking cognizance of an offence, there is sufficient
ground for proceeding. This section relates to commencement of a criminal
proceeding. If the Magistrate taking cognizance of a case (it may be the Magistrate
receiving the complaint or to whom it has been transferred under Section 192), upon
a consideration of the materials before him (i.e. the complaint, examination of the
complainant and his witnesses, if present, or report of inquiry, if any), thinks that
there is a prima facie case for proceeding in respect of an offence, he shall issue
process against the accused.
52. A wide discretion has been given as to grant or refusal of process and it must be
judicially exercised. A person ought not to be dragged into court merely because a
complaint has been filed. If a prima facie case has been made out, the Magistrate
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187570074/ 26
Sri. Arjun Anjaneya Reddy vs State Of Karnataka on 25 June, 2025
ought to issue process and it cannot be refused merely because he thinks that it is
unlikely to result in a conviction.
53. However, the words "sufficient ground for proceeding" appearing in Section 204
are of immense importance. It is these words which amply suggest that an opinion is
to be formed only after due application of mind that there is sufficient basis for
proceeding against the said accused and formation of such an opinion is to be stated
in the order itself. The order is liable to be set aside if no reason is given therein while
coming to the conclusion that there is prima facie case against the accused, though
the order need not contain detailed reasons. A fortiori, the order would be bad in law
if the reason given turns out to be ex facie incorrect."
39. A similar view has been taken by this Court in the case of Ashoke Mal Bafna (supra).
40. In the present case, leaving aside there being no reasons in support of the order of the issuance
of process, as a matter of fact, it is clear from the order of the learned Single Judge of the High
Court, that there was no such order passed at all. The learned Single Judge of the High Court, based
on the record, has presumed that there was an order of issuance of process. We find that such an
approach is unsustainable in law. The appeal therefore deserves to be allowed."
(Emphasis supplied)
(ii) S.C. GARG vs. STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH, 2025 SCC OnLine SC 791 - paras 17, 18 and 19:
"17. We shall now have a look at the subsequent matters Devendra (supra) and
Muskan Enterprises (Supra) wherein it is held that principle of res judicata is not
applicable in criminal proceedings. In Devendra (supra) was a case where after
dismissal of first petition under Section 482 Cr. P.C. seeking quashing of the FIR, the
appellants therein preferred another application under Section 482 Cr. P.C., after the
Magistrate took cognizance of the matter, which was dismissed by the High Court. In
this Court, it was argued by the opposite party that the first order of the High Court
dismissing the petition under Section 482 Cr. P.C. would operate as res judicata.
Negating the said argument, a two Judge Bench of this Court held in para 25 as
under:
"25. Mr. Das, furthermore, would contend that the order of the High Court dated
17-10-2005 would operate as res judicata. With respect, we cannot subscribe to the
said view. The principle of res judicata has no application in a criminal proceeding.
The principles of res judicata as adumbrated in Section 11 of the Code of Civil
Procedure or the general principles thereof will have no application in a case of this
nature."
18. In Muskan Enterprises (supra), similar was the position. The first petition under Section 482 Cr.
P.C. was dismissed as withdrawn without liberty obtained to apply afresh, the High Court dismissed
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187570074/ 27
Sri. Arjun Anjaneya Reddy vs State Of Karnataka on 25 June, 2025
the second petition under Section 482 Cr. P.C. as not maintainable. Referring to Devendra (supra), a
two Judge Bench of this Court of which one of us was a member (Prashant Kumar Mishra, J.)
observed thus in para 17:
"17. That the principle of res judicata has no application in a criminal proceeding was
reiterated by this Court in Devendra v. State of U.P."
19. Reading three earlier decisions vis-à-vis the two later decisions parallelly, we do not think that
considering the context and the stage of the proceedings in which the matters stood and agitated
before this Court, there is any diversion in the applicability of the principle of res judicata. While
three earlier decisions in Pritam Singh (Supra), Bhagat Ram (supra) and Tarachand Jain (supra)
were decided basis acquittal in previous trial, the subsequent decision in Devendra (supra) and
Muskan Enterprises (supra) have been decided at the stage of quashing petition under Section 482
Cr. P.C., thus, in both the matters, there was no final adjudication of merits. While in Devendra
(supra), the first petition was for quashing of the FIR and the second petition was preferred after the
Magistrate took cognizance of the matter; in Muskan (supra), the first petition was dismissed as
withdrawn whereas the second petition was held not maintainable due to earlier withdrawal without
any liberty. Thus, these two cases are totally distinguishable.
In addition, it is important to bear that Sambasivam (supra) was decided by Five Judges of the
Judicial Committee and Pritam Singh (supra) was decided by a three Judge Bench, whereas all
subsequent decisions have been rendered by the two Judges Bench. Therefore, Pritam Singh (supra)
is binding insofar as the issue concerning the applicability of principle of res judicata in a criminal
proceeding is concerned."
In JM LABORATORIES v. STATE OF ANDHRA PRADESH supra, the Apex Court was considering a
private complaint being registered and was taking cognizance of a complaint. The issue sprung from
the violation of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. In S.C. GARG vs. STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH
supra, the Apex Court was considering whether the company should be made a party in the criminal
proceedings and whether the subsequent writ petition would be maintainable or the second petition
would be maintainable, not the same cause of action. Both the judgments would not in any way
assist the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners. The issue in the lis is the Court taking
cognizance on a police report. On a police report, what the concerned Court has done now, is not
suffering from non-application of mind but has abundant application of mind.
11. The order of taking of cognizance should undoubtedly bear application of mind, but should not
result in the concerned Court undertaking a roving enquiry at the stage of taking of cognizance. If
the contention of the learned Senior Counsel Sri.C.V.Nagesh is accepted, it would be virtually
directing the concerned Court to conduct a roving enquiry, of the merit of the charges, so laid
against the accused. The order nowhere suffers from non-application of mind. It therefore becomes
apposite to notice the judgments relied by the learned Senior Counsel for the
respondent-Complainant. The Apex Court in STATE OF GUJARAT vs. AFROZ MOHAMMED
HASANFATTA, 2019 SCC OnLine SC 132, has held as follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187570074/ 28
Sri. Arjun Anjaneya Reddy vs State Of Karnataka on 25 June, 2025
"14. The charge-sheet was filed in Criminal Case No. 47715 of 2014 on 18-8-2014
against the accused persons, namely, Sunil Agrawal and Ratan Agrawal. In the first
charge-sheet, the respondent Afroz Mohammad Hasanfatta (Afroz Hasanfatta) was
referred to as a suspect. In the second supplementary charge-sheet filed on
15-11-2014 in Criminal Case No. 62851 of 2014, the respondent Afroz is arraigned as
Accused 1 and Amit alias Bilal Haroon Gilani as Accused 2. In the second
supplementary charge-sheet, prosecution relies upon the statement of witnesses as
well as on certain bank transactions as to flow of money into the account of the
respondent Afroz Hasanfatta and his Company Nile Trading Corporation. The order
of taking cognizance of the second supplementary charge-sheet and issuance of
summons to the respondent Afroz Hasanfatta reads as under:
"I take in consideration charge-sheet/complaint for the offence of Sections 420, 465,
467, 468 IPC, etc. Summons to be issued against the accused."
16. It is well settled that at the stage of issuing process, the Magistrate is mainly concerned with the
allegations made in the complaint or the evidence led in support of the same and the Magistrate is
only to be satisfied that there are sufficient grounds for proceeding against the accused. It is fairly
well settled that when issuing summons, the Magistrate need not explicitly state the reasons for his
satisfaction that there are sufficient grounds for proceeding against the accused. Reliance was placed
upon Bhushan Kumar v. State (NCT of Delhi) [Bhushan Kumar v. State (NCT of Delhi), (2012) 5
SCC 424 :
(2012) 2 SCC (Cri) 872] wherein it was held as under :
(SCC pp. 428-29, paras 11-13) "11. In Chief Enforcement Officer v. Videocon
International Ltd. [Chief Enforcement Officer v. Videocon International Ltd., (2008)
2 SCC 492 : (2008) 1 SCC (Cri) 471] (SCC p. 499, para 19) the expression
"cognizance" was explained by this Court as "it merely means 'become aware of' and
when used with reference to a court or a Judge, it connotes 'to take notice of
judicially'. It indicates the point when a court or a Magistrate takes judicial notice of
an offence with a view to initiating proceedings in respect of such offence said to have
been committed by someone.' It is entirely a different thing from initiation of
proceedings;
rather it is the condition precedent to the initiation of proceedings by the Magistrate or the Judge.
Cognizance is taken of cases and not of persons. Under Section 190 of the Code, it is the application
of judicial mind to the averments in the complaint that constitutes cognizance. At this stage, the
Magistrate has to be satisfied whether there is sufficient ground for proceeding and not whether
there is sufficient ground for conviction. Whether the evidence is adequate for supporting the
conviction can be determined only at the trial and not at the stage of enquiry. If there is sufficient
ground for proceeding then the Magistrate is empowered for issuance of process under Section 204
of the Code.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187570074/ 29
Sri. Arjun Anjaneya Reddy vs State Of Karnataka on 25 June, 2025
12. A "summons" is a process issued by a court calling upon a person to appear before a Magistrate.
It is used for the purpose of notifying an individual of his legal obligation to appear before the
Magistrate as a response to violation of law. In other words, the summons will announce to the
person to whom it is directed that a legal proceeding has been started against that person and the
date and time on which the person must appear in court. A person who is summoned is legally
bound to appear before the court on the given date and time. Wilful disobedience is liable to be
punished under Section 174 IPC. It is a ground for contempt of court.
13. Section 204 of the Code does not mandate the Magistrate to explicitly state the reasons for
issuance of summons. It clearly states that if in the opinion of a Magistrate taking cognizance of an
offence, there is sufficient ground for proceeding, then the summons may be issued. This section
mandates the Magistrate to form an opinion as to whether there exists a sufficient ground for
summons to be issued but it is nowhere mentioned in the section that the explicit narration of the
same is mandatory, meaning thereby that it is not a prerequisite for deciding the validity of the
summons issued."
22. In summoning the accused, it is not necessary for the Magistrate to examine the merits and
demerits of the case and whether the materials collected is adequate for supporting the conviction.
The court is not required to evaluate the evidence and its merits. The standard to be adopted for
summoning the accused under Section 204 CrPC is not the same at the time of framing the charge.
For issuance of summons under Section 204 CrPC, the expression used is "there is sufficient ground
for proceeding..."; whereas for framing the charges, the expression used in Sections 240 and 246
IPC is "there is ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence...". At the stage of
taking cognizance of the offence based upon a police report and for issuance of summons under
Section 204 CrPC, detailed enquiry regarding the merits and demerits of the case is not required.
The fact that after investigation of the case, the police has filed charge-sheet along with the materials
thereon may be considered as sufficient ground for proceeding for issuance of summons under
Section 204 CrPC.
23. Insofar as taking cognizance based on the police report is concerned, the Magistrate has the
advantage of the charge-sheet, statement of witnesses and other evidence collected by the police
during the investigation. Investigating officer/SHO collects the necessary evidence during the
investigation conducted in compliance with the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code and in
accordance with the rules of investigation. Evidence and materials so collected are sifted at the level
of the investigating officer and thereafter, charge-sheet was filed. In appropriate cases, opinion of
the Public Prosecutor is also obtained before filing the charge-sheet. The court thus has the
advantage of the police report along with the materials placed before it by the police. Under Section
190(1)(b) CrPC, where the Magistrate has taken cognizance of an offence upon a police report and
the Magistrate is satisfied that there is sufficient ground for proceeding, the Magistrate directs
issuance of process. In case of taking cognizance of an offence based upon the police report, the
Magistrate is not required to record reasons for issuing the process. In cases instituted on a police
report, the Magistrate is only required to pass an order issuing summons to the accused. Such an
order of issuing summons to the accused is based upon subject to satisfaction of the Magistrate
considering the police report and other documents and satisfying himself that there is sufficient
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187570074/ 30
Sri. Arjun Anjaneya Reddy vs State Of Karnataka on 25 June, 2025
ground for proceeding against the accused. In a case based upon the police report, at the stage of
issuing the summons to the accused, the Magistrate is not required to record any reason. In case, if
the charge-sheet is barred by law or where there is lack of jurisdiction or when the charge- sheet is
rejected or not taken on file, then the Magistrate is required to record his reasons for rejection of the
charge- sheet and for not taking it on file."
(Emphasis supplied) The Apex Court later in PRADEEP S. WODEYAR vs. STATE OF KARNATAKA,
2021 SCC OnLine SC 1140, has held as follows:
"76. The counsel for the appellant has contended that the order of the Special Judge
taking cognizance has not sufficiently demonstrated application of mind to the
material placed before him. To substantiate this contention, the appellant relied on
the decisions in Pepsi Foods Ltd. v. Special Judicial Magistrate [Pepsi Foods Ltd. v.
Special Judicial Magistrate, (1998) 5 SCC 749 : 1998 SCC (Cri) 1400] , Fakhruddin
Ahmad v. State of Uttaranchal [Fakhruddin Ahmad v. State of Uttaranchal, (2008) 17
SCC 157 : (2010) 4 SCC (Cri) 478] , Mehmood Ul Rehman v. Khazir Mohammad
Tunda [Mehmood Ul Rehman v. Khazir Mohammad Tunda, (2015) 12 SCC 420 :
(2016) 1 SCC (Cri) 124] , Sunil Bharti Mittal v. CBI [Sunil Bharti Mittal v. CBI, (2015)
4 SCC 609 : (2015) 2 SCC (Cri) 687] and Ravindranatha Bajpe v. Mangalore Special
Economic Zone Ltd. [Ravindranatha Bajpe v. Mangalore Special Economic Zone Ltd.,
(2022) 15 SCC 430 : 2021 SCC OnLine SC 806] The respondent argued that this
Court has made a distinction on application of mind by the Judge for the purpose of
taking cognizance based on a police report on the one hand and a private complaint
under Section 200CrPC on the other, and that the requirement of a demonstrable
application of mind in the latter case is higher. For this purpose, the counsel relied on
this Court's decisions in Bhushan Kumar v. State (NCT of Delhi) [Bhushan Kumar v.
State (NCT of Delhi), (2012) 5 SCC 424 : (2012) 2 SCC (Cri) 872] and State of Gujarat
v. Afroz Mohammed Hasanfatta [State of Gujarat v. Afroz Mohammed Hasanfatta,
(2019) 20 SCC 539 : (2020) 3 SCC (Cri) 876] .
91. While distinguishing the decision in Pepsi Foods Ltd. [Pepsi Foods Ltd. v. Special Judicial
Magistrate, (1998) 5 SCC 749 : 1998 SCC (Cri) 1400] on the ground that it related to taking of
cognizance in a complaint case, the Court in Afroz Mohammed Hasanfatta case [State of Gujarat v.
Afroz Mohammed Hasanfatta, (2019) 20 SCC 539 : (2020) 3 SCC (Cri) 876] held since in a case of
cognizance based on a police report, the Magistrate has the advantage of perusing the materials, he
is not required to record reasons : (Afroz Mohammed Hasanfatta case [State of Gujarat v. Afroz
Mohammed Hasanfatta, (2019) 20 SCC 539 : (2020) 3 SCC (Cri) 876] , SCC p. 552, para 23) "23.

the Public Prosecutor is also obtained before filing the charge-sheet. The court thus has the
advantage of the police report along with the materials placed before it by the police. Under Section
190(1)(b)CrPC, where the Magistrate has taken cognizance of an offence upon a police report and
the Magistrate is satisfied that there is sufficient ground for proceeding, the Magistrate directs

charge-sheet and for not taking it on file."
(emphasis supplied)"
108. In view of the discussion above, we summarise our findings below:
108.1. The Special Court does not have, in the absence of a specific provision to that
effect, the power to take cognizance of an offence under the MMDR Act without the
case being committed to it by the Magistrate under Section 209CrPC. The order of
the Special Judge dated 30-12-2015 taking cognizance is therefore irregular.
108.2. The objective of Section 465 is to prevent the delay in the commencement and
completion of trial. Section 465CrPC is applicable to interlocutory orders such as an
order taking cognizance and summons order as well.
Therefore, even if the order taking cognizance is irregular, it would not vitiate the proceedings in
view of Section 465CrPC.
108.3. The decision in Gangula Ashok [Gangula Ashok v. State of A.P., (2000) 2 SCC 504 : 2000
SCC (Cri) 488] was distinguished in Rattiram [Rattiram v. State of M.P., (2012) 4 SCC 516 : (2012) 2
SCC (Cri) 481] based on the stage of trial. This differentiation based on the stage of trial must be
read with reference to Section 465(2)CrPC. Section 465(2) does not indicate that it only covers
challenges to pre-trial orders after the conclusion of the trial. The cardinal principle that guides
Section 465(2)CrPC is that the challenge to an irregular order must be urged at the earliest. While
determining if there was a failure of justice, the courts ought to address it with reference to the stage
of challenge, the seriousness of the offence and the apparent intention to prolong proceedings,
among others.
108.4. In the instant case, the cognizance order was challenged by the appellant two years after
cognizance was taken. No reason was given to explain the inordinate delay. Moreover, in view of the
diminished role of the committal court under Section 209 of the Code of 1973 as compared to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187570074/ 32
Sri. Arjun Anjaneya Reddy vs State Of Karnataka on 25 June, 2025
role of the committal court under the erstwhile Code of 1898, the gradation of irregularity in a
cognizance order made in Sections 460 and 461 and the seriousness of the offence, no failure of
justice has been demonstrated.
108.5. It is a settled principle of law that cognizance is taken of the offence and not the offender.
However, the cognizance order indicates that the Special Judge has perused all the relevant material
relating to the case before cognizance was taken. The change in the form of the order would not alter
its effect. Therefore, no "failure of justice"
under Section 465CrPC is proved. This irregularity would thus not vitiate the
proceedings in view of Section 465CrPC.
108.6. The Special Court has the power to take cognizance of offences under the
MMDR Act and conduct a joint trial with other offences if permissible under Section
220CrPC. There is no express provision in the MMDR Act which indicates that
Section 220CrPC does not apply to proceedings under the MMDR Act.
108.7. Section 30-B of the MMDR Act does not impliedly repeal Section 220CrPC.
Both the provisions can be read harmoniously and such an interpretation furthers
justice and prevents hardship since it prevents a multiplicity of proceedings.
108.8. Since cognizance was taken by the Special Judge based on a police report and
not a private complaint, it is not obligatory for the Special Judge to issue a fully
reasoned order if it otherwise appears that the Special Judge has applied his mind to
the material.
108.9. A combined reading of the Notifications dated 29- 5-2014 and 21-1-2014
indicate that the Sub-Inspector of Lokayukta is an authorised person for the purpose
of Section 22 of the MMDR Act. The FIR that was filed to overcome the bar under
Section 22 has been signed by the Sub-Inspector of Lokayukta Police and the
information was given by the SIT. Therefore, the respondent has complied with
Section 22CrPC.
108.10. The question of whether A-1 was in charge of and responsible for the affairs
of the company during the commission of the alleged offence as required under the
proviso to Section 23(1) of the MMDR Act is a matter for trial. There appears to be a
prima facie case against A-1, which is sufficient to arraign him as an accused at this
stage."
(Emphasis supplied) The Apex Court holds the following judgments of STATE OF GUJARAT vs.
AFROZ MOHAMMED HASANFATTA, 2019 SCC OnLine SC 132 supra that on a police report, if the
order of cognizance bears application of mind, that would suffice. The Apex Court in its latest
judgments in the case of PRAMILA DEVI AND OTHERS vs. STATE OF JHARKHAND AND
ANOTHER, 2025 SCC OnLine SC 886, has held as follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187570074/ 33
Sri. Arjun Anjaneya Reddy vs State Of Karnataka on 25 June, 2025
"ANALYSIS, REASONING AND CONCLUSION:
13. We have considered the matter in its entirety. Two basic issues arise for
consideration.
14. Firstly, whether the Additional Judicial Commissioner while taking cognizance
has to record detailed reasons for taking cognizance? Secondly, whether the FIR itself
was instituted with mala fide intention and was liable to be quashed?
15. Coming to the first issue, we have no hesitation to record that the approach of the
High Court was totally erroneous. Perusal of the Order taking cognizance dated
13.06.2019 discloses that the Additional Judicial Commissioner has stated that the
'case diary and case record' have been perused, which disclosed a prima facie case
made out under Sections 498(A), 406 and 420 of the IPC and Section 3 (1)(g) of the
SC/ST Act against the accused including appellants. Further, we find the approach of
the Additional Judicial Commissioner correct inasmuch as while taking cognizance, it
firstly applied its mind to the materials before it to form an opinion as to whether any
offence has been committed and thereafter went into the aspect of identifying the
persons who appeared to have committed the offence. Accordingly, the process
moves to the next stage; of issuance of summons or warrant, as the case may be,
against such persons.
16. In the present case, we find that the Additional Judicial Commissioner has taken
cognizance while recording a finding that - from a perusal of the case diary and case
record, a prima facie case was made out against the accused, including the
Appellants.
In Bhushan Kumar v. State (NCT of Delhi), (2012) 5 SCC 424, this Court held that an order of the
Magistrate taking cognizance cannot be faulted only because it was not a reasoned order; relevant
paragraphs being as under:
'14. Time and again it has been stated by this Court that the summoning order under
Section 204 of the Code requires no explicit reasons to be stated because it is
imperative that the Magistrate must have taken notice of the accusations and applied
his mind to the allegations made in the police report and the materials filed
therewith.
15. In Kanti Bhadra Shah v. State of W.B. [(2000) 1 SCC 722 : 2000 SCC (Cri) 303]
the following passage will be apposite in this context : (SCC p. 726, para 12) "12. If
there is no legal requirement that the trial court should write an order showing the
reasons for framing a charge, why should the already burdened trial courts be further
burdened with such an extra work. The time has reached to adopt all possible
measures to expedite the court procedures and to chalk out measures to avert all
roadblocks causing avoidable delays. If a Magistrate is to write detailed orders at
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187570074/ 34
Sri. Arjun Anjaneya Reddy vs State Of Karnataka on 25 June, 2025
different stages merely because the counsel would address arguments at all stages,
the snail-paced progress of proceedings in trial courts would further be slowed down.
We are coming across interlocutory orders of Magistrates and Sessions Judges
running into several pages. We can appreciate if such a detailed order has been
passed for culminating the proceedings before them. But it is quite unnecessary to
write detailed orders at other stages, such as issuing process, remanding the accused
to custody, framing of charges, passing over to next stages in the trial."
(emphasis supplied)
16. In Nagawwa v. Veeranna Shivalingappa Konjalgi [(1976) 3 SCC 736 : 1976 SCC (Cri) 507] this
Court held that it is not the province of the Magistrate to enter into a detailed discussion on the
merits or demerits of the case. It was further held that in deciding whether a process should be
issued, the Magistrate can take into consideration improbabilities appearing on the face of the
complaint or in the evidence led by the complainant in support of the allegations. The Magistrate
has been given an undoubted discretion in the matter and the discretion has to be judicially
exercised by him. It was further held that : (SCC p. 741, para 5) "5. ... Once the Magistrate has
exercised his discretion it is not for the High Court, or even this Court, to substitute its own
discretion for that of the Magistrate or to examine the case on merits with a view to find out whether
or not the allegations in the complaint, if proved, would ultimately end in conviction of the accused."
17. In Chief Controller of Imports & Exports v. Roshanlal Agarwal [(2003) 4 SCC 139 : 2003 SCC
(Cri) 788] this Court, in para 9, held as under : (SCC pp. 145-46) "9. In determining the question
whether any process is to be issued or not, what the Magistrate has to be satisfied is whether there is
sufficient ground for proceeding and not whether there is sufficient ground for conviction. Whether
the evidence is adequate for supporting the conviction, can be determined only at the trial and not at
the stage of inquiry. At the stage of issuing the process to the accused, the Magistrate is not required
to record reasons. This question was considered recently in U.P. Pollution Control Board v. Mohan
Meakins Ltd. [(2000) 3 SCC 745] and after noticing the law laid down in Kanti Bhadra Shah v. State
of W.B. [(2000) 1 SCC 722 : 2000 SCC (Cri) 303] it was held as follows: (U.P. Pollution case [(2000)
3 SCC 745], SCC p. 749, para 6) '6. The legislature has stressed the need to record reasons in certain
situations such as dismissal of a complaint without issuing process. There is no such legal
requirement imposed on a Magistrate for passing detailed order while issuing summons. The
process issued to the accused cannot be quashed merely on the ground that the Magistrate had not
passed a speaking order.'"
18. In U.P. Pollution Control Board v. Bhupendra Kumar Modi [(2009) 2 SCC 147 :
(2009) 1 SCC (Cri) 679] this Court, in para 23, held as under : (SCC p. 154) "23. It is a
settled legal position that at the stage of issuing process, the Magistrate is mainly
concerned with the allegations made in the complaint or the evidence led in support
of the same and he is only to be prima facie satisfied whether there are sufficient
grounds for proceeding against the accused."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187570074/ 35
Sri. Arjun Anjaneya Reddy vs State Of Karnataka on 25 June, 2025
19. This being the settled legal position, the order passed by the Magistrate could not be faulted with
only on the ground that the summoning order was not a reasoned order.' (emphasis supplied)
17. The view in Bhushan Kumar (supra) was reiterated in Mehmood Ul Rehman v. Khazir
Mohammad Tunda, (2015) 12 SCC 420 and State of Gujarat v. Afroz Mohammed Hasanfatta, (2019)
20 SCC 539. This Court in Rakhi Mishra v. State of Bihar, (2017) 16 SCC 772 restated the settled
proposition of law enunciated in Sonu Gupta v. Deepak Gupta, (2015) 3 SCC 424, as under:
'4. We have heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties. We are of the
considered opinion that the High Court erred in allowing the application filed by
Respondents 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 and quashing the criminal proceedings against
them. A perusal of the FIR would clearly show that the appellant alleged cruelty
against Respondents 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10. This Court in Sonu Gupta v. Deepak
Gupta [Sonu Gupta v. Deepak Gupta, (2015) 3 SCC 424 : (2015) 2 SCC (Cri) 265] held
as follows : (SCC p. 429, para 8) "8. ... At the stage of cognizance and summoning the
Magistrate is required to apply his judicial mind only with a view to take cognizance
of the offence ... to find out whether a prima facie case has been made out for
summoning the accused persons. At this stage, the learned Magistrate is not required
to consider the defence version or materials or arguments nor is he required to
evaluate the merits of the materials or evidence of the complainant, because the
Magistrate must not undertake the exercise to find out at this stage whether the
materials would lead to conviction or not."
5. The order passed by the trial court taking cognizance against R-2 and R-4 to R-9 is
in conformity with the law laid down in the above judgment. It is settled law that the
power under Section 482 CrPC is exercised by the High Court only in exceptional
circumstances only when a prima facie case is not made out against the accused. The
test applied by this Court for interference at the initial stage of a prosecution is
whether the uncontroverted allegations prima facie establish a case.' (emphasis
supplied)
18. Coming to the second point which the Appellants canvassed before this Court viz.
the background of lodging of the FIR to impress that the same is mala fide, an
afterthought and at best, a civil dispute being tried to be settled through criminal
proceedings by way of arm-twisting. On this point, need for a detailed discussion is
obviated in view of our answer on the first point supra and the paragraphs infra.
19. Perusal of the entire gamut of the pleadings of the Appellants does not disclose
any categorical statement to the effect that during investigation by the police, no
evidence has emerged to warrant taking of cognizance, much less against the
Appellants. The only averment which has been made is that the Trial Court had not
recorded the prima facie material against the Appellants because it does not exist.
This is too simplistic an argument and does not shift the burden from the Appellants
of taking a categorical stand that no material whatsoever for taking cognizance is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187570074/ 36
Sri. Arjun Anjaneya Reddy vs State Of Karnataka on 25 June, 2025
available in the police papers/case diary against the Appellants. Be it noted, the State
has argued that sufficient material warranting cognizance has been unearthed during
the course of investigation.
20. Here, the Court would pause to delve on what is the scope of the exercise of
application of mind on the police papers/case diary for deciding as to whether to take
cognizance or not - it has only to be seen whether there is material forthcoming to
indicate commission of the offence(s) alleged. The concerned Court is not empowered
to go into the veracity of the material at that time. That is why, the law provides for a
trial where it is open to both the parties i.e., the prosecution as well as the defence to
lead evidence(s) either to prove the materials which have come against the accused or
to disprove such findings. This Court vide Order dated 13.09.2024 directed the
Appellants to file a translated copy of the chargesheet, as the State filed the
chargesheet in Hindi along with an application seeking exemption from filing official
translation (I.A. No. 198073/2024). As this Court [Coram : Sudhanshu Dhulia and
Ahsanuddin Amanullah, JJ.] is well-conversant with Hindi, the language in which the
chargesheet is and which has been brought on record, we have examined the same.
However, the Appellants failed to comply with the specific direction issued on
13.09.2024. Be that as it may, we find that chargesheet mentions that on the basis of
investigation, site inspection and statements of the complainant, the police has found
the allegations true against all the accused including appellants.
21. For reasons aforesaid and on an overall circumspection of the facts and
circumstances of the case and submissions of learned counsel for the parties, we find
that the Order taking cognizance dated
13.06.2019, being in accordance with law, was not required to be interfered with by the High Court.
22. Though no cross-appeal against the Impugned Judgment has been filed by Respondent No. 2,
yet to render complete justice as also set right the error committed by the High Court, on the legal
issue of requirement of recording detailed grounds/reasons for taking cognizance, the Impugned
Judgment is set aside in toto."
(Emphasis supplied) If the order of taking of cognizance, as quoted supra, is considered on the
bedrock of the principles elucidated by the Apex Court in the cases of AFROZ, PRADEEP
WODEYAR and PRAMILA DEVI supra, unmistakable inference, is that the order impugned does
not suffer from the vice of non-application of mind, but has application of mind in its abundance, to
the stage before it.
Finding no merit in the petition, the petition stands rejected.
