JUDGMENT
Sanjeev Kumar-J
1. This intra court appeal under Clause 12 of the Letters Patent is directed against a judgment dated
25th October, 2016 passed by a learned Single Judge of this Court [―the Writ Court(cid:129)] in OWP
No.733/2013 titled Raj Ali and others v. State of J&K and others, whereby the writ petition filed by
the respondent Nos.1 to 04 (hereinafter referred to as ―the writ petitioners(cid:129), for convenience) has
been allowed and the acquisition proceedings initiated by the appellant No.2 on the request of the
appellant No.1 under the State Land Acquisition Act, Svt. 1990 (1934 A.D.) [―State Land Acquisition
Act(cid:129)] have been quashed and the appellants left free to proceed with the land acquisition
proceedings after complying with the procedure prescribed under Sections 39 to 42 of the State
Land Acquisition Act. OWP Nos. 850/2013 & 1537/2013 titled Puran Singh and others v. State of
J&K and others and Gandharav Singh and others v. State of J&K and others also stand allowed by

J&K Housing Board Through Its Managing ... vs Raj Ali S/O Munshi R/O Meen Charkan ... on 6 October, 2023
the Writ Court in terms of the order passed in OWP No.733/2013 for which the 4 LPAOW
NO.1/2017 c/w LPAOW NOs.2/2017 & 3/2017 appellants have filed two separate writ appeals i.e.
LPAOW Nos.2/2017 & 3/2017. We have taken up all these appeals for disposal together by this
common judgment.
2. Before we take up for consideration the grounds of challenge addressed by the learned counsel for
the appellants to assail the validity and correctness of the impugned judgment, we deem it
appropriate to state few facts, as are relevant for disposal of the controversy raised in these appeals.
For facility of reference facts from LPA No.1/2017 are noted.
3. The writ petitioners are claimably owners in possession of land bearing Khasra Nos. 48
measuring (06 kanals 05 marlas), 49 (05 kanals 10 marlas), 49 min (05 kanals 17 marlas), 50 (01
kanal 13 marlas), 51 (03 kanals 09 marlas, 52 (09 kanals 18 marlas, 53 (02 kanals 03 marlas), 54 (3
kanals 09 marlas), 55 (14 marlas) and Khasra No.56 (02 kanals 03 marlas) situated at village Meen
Charkan Tehsil and District Samba [―subject land(cid:129)]. The appellant No.1 is a statutory authority
constituted under Section 3 of the Jammu & Kashmir Housing Board Act, 1976 [―the Act of 1976(cid:129)]
for taking measures, make schemes and carry out such works as are necessary for the purposes of
dealing with and satisfying the need of housing accommodation, residential and office
accommodations for the public sector. It is in pursuance of this objective and with a view to lay out a
housing colony to 5 LPAOW NO.1/2017 c/w LPAOW NOs.2/2017 & 3/2017 meet the need for
housing accommodation, the appellant-Board placed an indent with the Collector Land Acquisition,
J&K Housing Board, the appellant No.2 herein, for acquiring a chunk of land measuring 3271 kanals
and 6 marlas in village Meen Charkan and village Bari Tehsil and District Samba.
4. The respondent No.2 issued Section 4(1) notification under the State Land Acquisition Act for
acquiring the said land. This was followed by Sections 6, 7, 9 and 17 notifications of the State Land
Acquisition Act. The writ petitioners along with other land owners approached this Court by way of
different writ petitions immediately after notifications under Section 9 and 9A of the State Land
Acquisition Act were issued by the Collector. The writ petition was contested by the appellants
herein by filing their objections. It was contended by the appellants before the Writ Court that the
Collector is proceeding with the process of acquisition by strictly following the procedure laid down
in the State Land Acquisition Act. With respect to applicability of the provisions of Sections 39 to 42
of the State Land Acquisition Act, it was contended by the appellants that the aforesaid provisions
were not attracted to a case of an acquisition by the Jammu & Kashmir Housing Board, a statutory
body constituted under the Act of 1976.
6 LPAOW NO.1/2017 c/w LPAOW NOs.2/2017 & 3/2017
5. The writ petition filed by the writ petitioners herein along with other writ petitions involving
determination of identical questions of fact and law, were considered by the Writ Court and vide its
order and judgment impugned, the writ petitions were allowed primarily on the ground that the
Jammu & Kashmir Housing Board was a ―local authority(cid:129) and, therefore, the Collector was under
an obligation to follow the provisions of Sections 39 to 42 of the State Land Acquisition Act. It is this
judgment of the Writ Court, which is called in question by the J&K Housing Board and the Collector

J&K Housing Board Through Its Managing ... vs Raj Ali S/O Munshi R/O Meen Charkan ... on 6 October, 2023
Land Acquisition of the Board on multiple grounds.
6. Having heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the material on record, we are of the
opinion that the decision of these appeals hinges upon determination of following questions of law:-
i) Whether J&K Housing Board, a statutory body constituted under the Jammu &
Kashmir Housing Board Act, is a ―local authority(cid:129) within the meaning of the term
used in Section 42A of the State Land Acquisition Act and, therefore, Chapter-VII
(Sections 39 to 42 of the State Land Acquisition Act) would be applicable for
acquisition of land for such authority?
7 LPAOW NO.1/2017 c/w LPAOW NOs.2/2017 & 3/2017
ii) What is the impact of repeal of the State Land Acquisition Act and coming into force of ‗The
Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement
Act, 2013' [―RFCTLARR Act(cid:129)] by ‗The Jammu & Kashmir Reorganization Act, 2019' on the
acquisition of land in question which at the relevant point of time was under process but had not
culminated into passing of a final award?
Question No.(i)
7. We take up first issue first for determination.
8. Section 3(i) of the State Land Acquisition Act defines the expression ―local authority(cid:129) in the
following manner:-
―3(i) The expression ―local authority(cid:129) includes a town planning authority (by
whatever name called) set under any law for the time being in force.(cid:129)
9. From a reading of Section 3(i), it is obvious that the definition of the ―local authority(cid:129) given in
the State Land Acquisition Act is inclusive and not conclusive in nature and, therefore, we may have
to look for the definition of the ―local authority(cid:129) found contained in some other legislations. The
concept of ―local authority(cid:129) can be traced to Entry No.5 of List II of the Seventh Schedule of the
Constitution of India. The Entry reads thus:-
8 LPAOW NO.1/2017 c/w LPAOW NOs.2/2017 & 3/2017 ―5. Local government, that
is to say, the constitution and powers of municipal corporations, improvement trusts,
districts boards, mining settlement authorities and other local authorities for the
purpose of local self-government or village administration.(cid:129)
10. The Entry aforesaid confers legislative competence on the States to make law, inter alia, in
relation to ―local authorities(cid:129). The term ―local authorities(cid:129) used in the Entry refers to the local
authorities to be constituted by the Act of State Legislatures for the purposes of local
self-government or village administration. It would clearly mean the authorities like Panchayats,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126490428/ 5
J&K Housing Board Through Its Managing ... vs Raj Ali S/O Munshi R/O Meen Charkan ... on 6 October, 2023
Municipal Committees, Municipal Councils, Municipal Corporations or some of the authorities,
which represent a unit of local self- government.
11. The expression ―local self-government(cid:129) or ―village administration(cid:129) is very significant and
conveys unequivocally that these authorities are, though, constituted under legislative enactments
but are required to be manned by the elected representatives of the people. Statutory authorities,
which are constituted of the officers and officials of the government or its nominees and controlled
and administered by the Government through them, cannot, by any stretch of reasoning, be called
―local self-government units(cid:129). It is because of this distinction, the ―local authorities(cid:129) which are
constituted as local self 9 LPAOW NO.1/2017 c/w LPAOW NOs.2/2017 & 3/2017 government Units
are treated autonomous entities different from the government. As is rightly brought out by the
Supreme Court in the case of Housing Board of Haryana v. Haryana Housing Board Employees
Union, (1996) 1 SCC 95, the word ―other local authority(cid:129) having been placed in the company of
―municipal council, district boards(cid:129) etc is required to be construed Ejusdem Generis and if we
understand the meaning of ―other local authorities(cid:129) in the context of Municipal Corporations,
District Boards, improvement trusts etc, we will come to a definite conclusion that the word ―other
local authority(cid:129) used in Entry No.5 is only in respect of those local authorities, which are constituted
by the Government and are administered by the elected representatives of the people. In short, the
―local authorities(cid:129) would mean only all such authorities which can be termed as local self
government units of administration.
12. The definition of ―local authority(cid:129) can also be found in Section 3 Subsection 22 of the General
Clauses Act, 1977 [―General Clauses Act(cid:129)]. Section 3(22) of the General Clauses Act reads thus:-
―3. Definitions.-- In this Act, and in all enactments now in force or hereafter to be
introduced, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context,-
10 LPAOW NO.1/2017 c/w LPAOW NOs.2/2017 & 3/2017 ................................
.................................
.................................
22) Local authority.--―Local authority(cid:129) shall mean a municipal committee or other authority legally
entitled to, or entrusted by the Government with, the control or management of a municipal or local
fund(cid:129)
13. From the definition of ―local authority(cid:129) set out herein above, it is abundantly clear that the
―local authority(cid:129), as per its definition in General Clauses Act, shall mean a Municipal Committee or
other authority like the Municipal Committee which is legally entitled or is entrusted by
Government with control or management of a municipal or local fund. Here also the word ―other
local authority(cid:129) has to be understood in the light of principle of Ejusdem Generis. Viewed thus, the
―local authority(cid:129) as defined in General Clauses Act needs to be interpreted to mean a body or
authority having and possessing practically all attributes of municipal committee.

J&K Housing Board Through Its Managing ... vs Raj Ali S/O Munshi R/O Meen Charkan ... on 6 October, 2023
14. Having discussed the definition and meaning of ―local authority(cid:129) given in General Clauses Act
and deducible from Entry No.5 of List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India, we 11
LPAOW NO.1/2017 c/w LPAOW NOs.2/2017 & 3/2017 now turn to the Subsection 3 of Section 3 of
the Act of 1976, which lays down as under:-
―3. Incorporation.-- (1) ...................
(2) ........................................
(3) For the purposes of this Act the Board shall be deemed to be a local authority.(cid:129)
15. From a plain reading of Sub Section (3) of Section 3 of the Act of 1976, it is
abundantly clear that Board by its nature and constitution is not a ―local authority(cid:129)
but is by fiction of law declared ―local authority(cid:129) only for the purposes of J&K
Housing Board Act, 1976 and nothing more. If we look to some of the salient
provisions of the Act of 1976, we will find it beyond any cavil of doubt that the J&K
Housing Board, which is constituted under Section 3 of the Act of 1976, is not a ―local
self-
government(cid:129) or a unit of village administration. It is established with sole object of taking out such
measures, making such schemes and to carry out such works as are necessary for the purposes of
dealing with the citizens' need of housing accommodation, residential and office accommodation for
the public sector.
12 LPAOW NO.1/2017 c/w LPAOW NOs.2/2017 & 3/2017
16. The Board, as is apparent from reading of Section-4 shall consist of a Chairman and such other
members not less than three and not more than nine, as the Government may appoint. The
appointment of the members and their removal is, therefore, vested in the Government. In short,
the J&K Housing Board is not constituted of the public representatives selected through any mode
of election. The Board in its functions is assisted by a Managing Director, a Chief Executive officer of
the Board, to be appointed by the Government. Secretary and other officers of the gazetted rank are
provided to be appointed by the Board subject to the approval of the Government.
17. Having regard to the nature and constitution of the Board and the objects it is required to
achieve, we have not even slightest of doubt in our mind that J&K Housing Board does not qualify to
be ―local authority(cid:129) for any purpose other than for the purpose of J&K Housing Board Act, 1976.
18. Viewed thus, we are of the considered opinion that the Writ Court committed an error of law by
declaring the J&K Housing Board as ―local authority(cid:129) for the purpose of Section 42-A of the State
Land Acquisition Act and holding Chapter VII of the State Land Acquisition Act applicable for
acquisitions to be made for the Board. In the view we have taken, we are supported by the 13
LPAOW NO.1/2017 c/w LPAOW NOs.2/2017 & 3/2017 judgment of Supreme Court in Haryana
Housing Board Employees Union case (supra).
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126490428/ 7
J&K Housing Board Through Its Managing ... vs Raj Ali S/O Munshi R/O Meen Charkan ... on 6 October, 2023
19. In the aforesaid case, Hon'ble Supreme court was considering the question ―whether the
Haryana Housing Board is a ―Local Authority(cid:129) within the meaning of Section 32(iv) of the Payment
of Bonus Act, 1965, which did not contain a specific definition of the word ―local authority(cid:129).
Hon'ble Supreme Court, relying upon the definition of ―local authority(cid:129) given in General Clauses
Act, 1897, Haryana Housing Board Act, 1971 and the concept of the words found contained in Entry
5 of List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India, arrived at the conclusion that the
Haryana Housing Board constituted under Haryana Housing Board Act, 1971 was not a ―local
authority(cid:129), a term which mean and is understood as a ‗local self-government unit' or ‗village
administration'. Hon'ble Supreme Court invoked the principle of ejusdem generis to come to such a
conclusion. Hon'ble Supreme Court analyzed various provisions of the Haryana Housing Board Act,
1971 which are almost in pari materia with the provisions of the Act of 1976 and concluded in
paragraph No.29 to 32 as under:-
―29. The above provisions clearly spell out that the Board which is basically and
essentially a creation of the Act of State Legislature consists of persons appointed by
the State Government on salary basis. The Board's personnel are not 14 LPAOW
NO.1/2017 c/w LPAOW NOs.2/2017 & 3/2017 elected by the people and there is no
clement of people's choice being represented in any manner in the constitution of the
Board. The Board functions strictly under the supervision and control of the state
Government and does not hold or possess a ―Local fund(cid:129). What constitutes the fund
of eh Board has already been specified above.
30. These functions as are indicated in a housing scheme are essentially performed
by municipal moards or municipal council which, undoubtedly, are "local authorities"
but on that analogy the Haryana Housing Board cannot be treated to be a "local
authority" as the extent of control of the State Government under which the Board
has to function is so prominently pervasive that it is almost destructive of its
independence which will also be apparent from the fact that in the matter of
settlement of its Annual Programmes, Budget and Establishment Schedule, the Board
has to obtain the sanction of the State Government under Section 24 of the Act. The
supplementary budget and programme, if any, has also to be sanctioned by the State
Government.
31. We need not refer to other provisions as the provisions already referred to above
are sufficient to bring home the point that Haryana Housing Board does not have
even the semblance of independence which are normally possessed by local
self-governments, like Municipal Boards or District Boards etc. The Board also does
not even partially consist of elected representatives of the people.
32. The Board, no doubt, has the power to levy and realise Betterment Charges (See
Section 40 to Section 43 of the Act) and various amount of money due from persons
in possession of the properties of the Board by way of rent etc. are recoverable as
arrears of land revenue but that by itself is not sufficient to clothe the Board with the
status of a "local authority".(cid:129) 15 LPAOW NO.1/2017 c/w LPAOW NOs.2/2017 &
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126490428/ 8
J&K Housing Board Through Its Managing ... vs Raj Ali S/O Munshi R/O Meen Charkan ... on 6 October, 2023
3/2017
20. When we advert to the Act of 1976, we clearly find that under Section 26 thereof Housing Board
has been given power to acquire and dispose of land and for that purpose enter into an agreement
with any person for acquisition from him by purchase, lease or exchange of any land which is
needed for giving effect to any housing scheme framed by it. The Board is, therefore, not dependent
upon the land placed at its disposal by the Government after its acquisition under the Land
Acquisition Act. Subsection 2 of Section 26 makes it further clear that the Housing Board is
competent in law to take steps for compulsory acquisition of any land or any interest therein
required for execution of a housing scheme in the manner provided under the Land Acquisition Act
and the acquisition of any land or interest thereto for the purposes of this Act shall be deemed to be
acquisition for a public purpose within the meaning of the Land Acquisition Act.
21. Such being the provisions contained in the Housing Board Act, 1976, it would be totally
inappropriate and incongruous to hold that the J&K Housing Board is clothed with the status of
―local authority(cid:129) for the purposes of land acquisition under the State Land Acquisition Act.
22. That being the clear position of law emerging from the discussion above, we hold that the J&K
Housing Board 16 LPAOW NO.1/2017 c/w LPAOW NOs.2/2017 & 3/2017 constituted under the Act
of 1976 is not a ―local authority(cid:129) within the meaning of term used in Section 42A of the State Land
Acquisition Act and that the provisions of Sections 39 to 42 contained in Chapter VII of the State
Land Acquisition Act would not apply for any acquisition of land by or on behalf of J&K Housing
Board. J&K Housing Board through its Collector is competent, in terms of Section 26 of the Housing
Board Act, 1976, to acquire any land required by it for the purpose of any housing scheme framed by
it by following procedure laid down in the State Land Acquisition Act.
23. Having held thus, we would also like to point out that Chapter VII of the State Land Acquisition
Act applies to the acquisition of land by the Government for the purpose of transferring it on lease
or otherwise to any Company on such terms and conditions, as the Government may determine after
the said company has executed an agreement mentioned in Chapter VII itself. This is so very clearly
provided under Section 39 of the State Land Acquisition Act.
24. True it is that by Section 42 A of the State Land Acquisition Act, acquisition of land by the State
for transferring it on lease to any corporation or ―local authority(cid:129) is also required to be made by
strictly complying with the provisions of Section 39 to 42 of the State Land Acquisition Act. From a
reading of entire Chapter 17 LPAOW NO.1/2017 c/w LPAOW NOs.2/2017 & 3/2017 VII, particularly
Section 39 and 42- A thereof, it becomes crystal clear that Chapter would be applicable only where
the Government undertakes to acquire land for the purpose of transferring it on lease or otherwise
to a Company, Corporation or ―local authority(cid:129).
25. In the instant case, the acquisition of land by the Government to be transferred to J&K Housing
Board on lease was not contemplated at all. On the indent placed by the J&K Housing Board,
Collector Land Acquisition of the Housing Board initiated the process for acquiring the land to be
vested in the J&K Housing Board after such acquisition. For this reason also, Chapter VII (Section

J&K Housing Board Through Its Managing ... vs Raj Ali S/O Munshi R/O Meen Charkan ... on 6 October, 2023
39 to 42-A) of the State Land Acquisition Act was not attracted to the case of acquisition in question.
Question No.(ii)
26. This brings us to question No.(ii) and while we venture to find out the impact of repeal of the
State Land Acquisition Act by the J&K Reorganization Act, 2019, we find that the issue has been
conclusively determined by the Supreme Court in the case of Bharat Petroleum Corporation
Ltd.(BPCL) and others v. Nisar Ahmed Ganai and others, AIR 2022 SC 5026.
27. It is not in dispute that by coming in force of the J&K Reorganization Act, 2019 w.e.f. 31.10.2019,
the State Land 18 LPAOW NO.1/2017 c/w LPAOW NOs.2/2017 & 3/2017 Acquisition Act, which
finds place at S. No.73 of Table-3 of the Fifth Schedule of the Act, stands repealed. The effect of
repeal of the State Act by the Act of 2019 is provided under Clause 2(13) of The Jammu and Kashmir
Reorganization (Removal of Difficulties) Order, 2019 [―the order of 2019(cid:129)] promulgated by the
President under Section 103 of the Jammu & Kashmir Reorganization Act, 2019, which reads thus:-
―2. Removal of difficulties ......................................

committed against any law so repealed; or
(d) any investigation, legal proceeding or remedy in respect of any such right,
privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment as aforesaid, and any
such investigation, legal proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and any such penalty, forfeiture or punishment may be imposed, as if this
Act had not been passed.(cid:129)

28. To somewhat similar extent is the definition and impact of repeal given in Section 6 of the
General Clauses Act. From a reading Clause 2(13) of the Order of 2019 along with Section 6 of the
General Clauses Act, it is clear that the right, privilege, liability and obligations acquired, accrued or
incurred under the repealed law i.e. the State Land Acquisition Act stand saved and would continue
to be governed under the repealed Act. This aspect has been elaborately discussed by the Supreme
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126490428/ 10
J&K Housing Board Through Its Managing ... vs Raj Ali S/O Munshi R/O Meen Charkan ... on 6 October, 2023
Court in the case of Nissar Ahmed (supra) to come to a conclusion that notwithstanding the repeal
of the State Land Acquisition Act by the Act of 2019, the land acquisition proceedings, which were
pending at the time of its repeal, shall be allowed to continue and be completed under the provision
of the repealed State Land Acquisition Act.
29. A similar argument, as was addressed before us by Mr. V.R.Wazir, learned senior counsel
appearing for the writ petitioners, based upon the provisions of Section 24 of the RFCTLARR Act,
was rejected by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Nissar Ahmed's case (supra) on the ground that
Section 24 of the RFCTLARR Act only repealed the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 and not the State
Land Acquisition Act and, therefore, the provisions of Section 24 of the RFCTLARR Act could not be
invoked to set at nought the acquisition proceedings which at the 20 LPAOW NO.1/2017 c/w
LPAOW NOs.2/2017 & 3/2017 time of commencement of the RFCTLARR Act were pending and
were being carried out under the State Land Acquisition Act.
30. Before we proceed further, we would like to set out the provisions of Section 24 of the
RFCTLARR Act, which read as under:-
24. Land acquisition process under Act No. 1 of 1984 shall be deemed to have lapsed
in certain cases.
(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, in any case of land acquisition
proceedings initiated under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894,--
(a) where no award under section 11 of the said Land Acquisition Act has been made,
then, all provisions of this Act relating to the determination of compensation shall
apply; or
(b) where an award under said section 11 has been made, then such proceedings shall
continue under the provisions of the said Land Acquisition Act, as if the said Act has
not been repealed.
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), in case of land acquisition
proceedings initiated under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (1 of 1894), where an
award under the said section 11 has been made five years or more prior to the
commencement of this Act but the physical possession of the land has not been taken
or the compensation has not been paid the said proceedings shall be deemed to have
lapsed and the appropriate Government, if it so chooses, shall initiate the
proceedings of such land acquisition afresh in accordance with the provisions of this
Act:
Provided that where an award has been made and compensation in respect of a
majority of land holdings has not been deposited in the account of the beneficiaries,
then, all beneficiaries specified in the notification for acquisition under section 4 of
the said Land Acquisition Act, shall be entitled to compensation in accordance with

J&K Housing Board Through Its Managing ... vs Raj Ali S/O Munshi R/O Meen Charkan ... on 6 October, 2023
the provisions of this Act.
21 LPAOW NO.1/2017 c/w LPAOW NOs.2/2017 & 3/2017
31. From a plain reading of Section 24 of the RFCTLARR Act reproduced herein above, it is crystal
clear that it is only the land acquisition process initiated under the Land Acquisition of 1894 i.e.
Central Land Acquisition Act that has been declared to have lapsed under certain situations
provided under the Section itself. The Section provides that where no award under Section 11 of the
said Land Acquisition Act i.e. Act No.1 of 1894 has been passed, then all provisions of the
RFCTLARR Act relating to determination of compensation shall apply. However, where award
under Section 11 has been made then such proceedings shall continue under the repealed Land
Acquisition act i.e. Act No.01 of 1894 as if the said Act has not been repealed. There is no reference
in Section 24 to the State Land Acquisition Act, 1990 (1934 A.D.). As is rightly held by the Supreme
Court that Section 24 of the RFCTLARR Act is not applicable to the acquisitions under the State
Land Acquisition Act, 1990. Paragraph No.5 and 6 of the judgment is relevant for our purpose.
Therefore, relevant portion of paras 5 and 6 is reproduced hereunder:-
―5..........................On fair reading of Section 24(1)(a) of the Act, 2013, it provides that
notwithstanding anything contained in Act, 2013, in any case of land acquisition
proceedings initiated under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, where no award under
Section 11 of the said Land Acquisition Act has been made, then, all provisions of Act,
2013 relating to the determination of the compensation shall 22 LPAOW NO.1/2017
c/w LPAOW NOs.2/2017 & 3/2017 apply. Section 24(1) of the Act, 2013 speaks about
the land acquisition proceedings initiated under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894.
In the present case, the lands in question have been acquired under the provisions of the State Land
Acquisition Act, 1990. Therefore, the acquisition of the lands in question is not under the Land
Acquisition Act, 1894. It cannot be disputed that prior to the enactment of the Jammu & Kashmir
Reorganization Act, 2019 and promulgation of the Jammu & Kashmir (Removal of Difficulties)
Order, 2019, the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 was not applicable at all so as far as the State of Jammu
& Kashmir is concerned. It is only on the enactment of the Jammu & Kashmir Reorganization Act,
2019, Act, 2013 shall be made applicable. It is the case on behalf of the original writ petitioners that
as the provisions of the State Act of 1990 are pari materia to the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 and
therefore, Section 24(1)(a) of the Act, 2013 shall be applicable. The aforesaid cannot be accepted.
The language of Section 24(1)(a) of the Act, 2013 is very clear and unambiguous. It talks about the
land acquisition under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 only and it does not speak
about any other pari materia provision of different statutes. 5.2 At this stage the decision of this
Court in the case of Bangalore Development Authority & Anr. (Supra) is required to be referred to.
In the said decision it is specifically observed and held that the Act, 2013 repeals only the Land
Acquisition Act, 1894 and not any other Central or State enactment dealing with the acquisition and
therefore, what is sought to be saved under the Act, 2013 is only acquisitions which have been
initiated under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 and not those acquisitions which have been initiated
under any other Central or State enactment. In paragraphs 19 and 23, this Court had observed and
held as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126490428/ 12
J&K Housing Board Through Its Managing ... vs Raj Ali S/O Munshi R/O Meen Charkan ... on 6 October, 2023
―19. The 2013 Act repeals only the LA Act and not any other Central or State
enactment dealing with acquisition. Therefore, what is sought to be saved under
Section 24 of the 2013 Act is only acquisitions which had been initiated under the LA
Act and 13 not those acquisitions which had been initiated under any other Central or
State enactment. The expression contained in Section 24 of the LA Act cannot be
given extensive interpretation by adding words into the provision, in the absence of
the provision itself giving rise to any such implication. We are of the view that 2013
Act would not regulate the acquisition proceedings made under the BDA Act.
23. In view of the above, the Learned Judge of the High Court in Sri Sudhakar Hegde
(supra) was not justified in holding that the provisions of LA Act that are made
applicable to the BDA Act are in the nature of legislation by reference. The learned
Judge has also erred in holding that in view of the repeal of LA Act by coming into
force of 2013 Act, the 23 LPAOW NO.1/2017 c/w LPAOW NOs.2/2017 & 3/2017
corresponding provisions of 2013 Act would regulate acquisition proceedings under
the BDA Act and that this would include determination of compensation in
accordance with 2013 Act. It is hereby clarified that since LA Act has been
incorporated into the BDA Act so far as they are applicable, the provisions of 15 2013
Act are not applicable for the acquisitions made under the BDA Act. Therefore, the
judgment of the learned Single Judge of the High Court in Sri Sudhakar Hegde
(supra) and other connected matters is hereby overruled.(cid:129) In view of the above
binding decision of this Court, we are of the firm view that the provisions of the Act,
2013 shall not be applicable with respect to the acquisition under the J & K Act, 1990.
5.3 Even otherwise considering clause 2(13) of the Order, 2019 read with Section 6 of
the General Clauses Act under which the rights, liabilities, privileges, obligations
acquired, accrued, or incurred under the repealed laws stands saved and would be
continued under those Acts (in the present case the Act, 1990), it is to be noted that
Order, 2019 is subsequent to the Act, 2013. Therefore, it is to be presumed that while
enacting the Order, 2019 and providing Clause 2(13) of the Order, 2019, the
legislature was conscious of the provisions of the earlier Act (Act, 2013). Under the
circumstances also, with respect to the lands acquired under the State Act of 1990,
Section 24(1)(a) of the Act, 2013 shall not be applicable at all.
5.4 Even otherwise, it is required to be noted that in some of the writ petitions there
was an order of status quo may be with respect to the possession. It is to be noted
that the notification under Section 4 and declaration under Section 6 of the State Act
of 1990 was a common notification / declaration.
Therefore, there was impediment on the part of the authority in declaring the award. The original
writ petitioners cannot be permitted to take benefit of the order of status quo obtained by some of
the original writ petitioners and thereafter to contend that as the award has not been declared they
shall be entitled to the enhanced amount of compensation under the provisions of the Act, 2013. In
the case of Indore Development Authority Vs. Manoharlal and Ors.; (2020) 8 SCC 129, it is observed
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126490428/ 13
J&K Housing Board Through Its Managing ... vs Raj Ali S/O Munshi R/O Meen Charkan ... on 6 October, 2023
and held by this Court that:
(i) Lapse of acquisition takes place only in case of default by the authorities acquiring
the land, not caused by any other reason or order of the court;
(ii) If it was not possible for the acquiring authorities, for any reason not attributable
to them or the Government, to take requisite steps, the period has to be excluded;
(iii) In case the authorities are prevented by the court's order, obviously, as per the
interpretation of the provisions such period has to be excluded;
24 LPAOW NO.1/2017 c/w LPAOW NOs.2/2017 & 3/2017
(iv) The intent of the Act, 2013 is not to benefit landowners only. The provisions of
Section 24 by itself do not intend to confer benefits on litigating parties as such, while
as per Section 114 of the Act, 2013 and Section 6 of the General Clauses Act the case
has to be litigated as per the provisions of the Act, 1894;
(v) It is not the intendment of the Act, 2013 that those who have assailed the acquisition process
should get benefits of higher compensation as contemplated under Section 24;
(vi) It is not intended by the provisions that in case, the persons, who have litigated and have
obtained interim orders from the Civil Courts by filing suits or from the High Court under Article
226 of the Constitution should have the benefits of the provisions of the Act, 2013 except to the
extent specifically provided under the Act, 2013;
(vii) In cases where some landowners have chosen to take recourse to litigation and have obtained
interim orders restraining taking of possession or orders of status quo, as a matter of practical
reality it is not possible for the authorities or the Government to take possession or to make
payment of compensation to the landowners. In several instances, such interim orders also have
impeded the making of an award;
(viii) The litigation initiated by the landowners has to be decided on its own merits and the benefits
of Section 24(2) should not be available to the litigants in a straightjacket manner. In case there is
no interim order, they can get the benefits they are entitled to, not otherwise. Delays and dilatory
tactics and sometimes wholly frivolous pleas cannot result in benefitting the landowners under
subsection (1) of Section 24 of the Act, 2013;
(ix) Any type of order passed by this Court would inhibit action on the part of the authorities to
proceed further, when a challenge to acquisition is pending;
(x) Interim order of stay granted in one of the matters of the landowners would cause a complete
restraint on the authorities to proceed further to issue declaration;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126490428/ 14
J&K Housing Board Through Its Managing ... vs Raj Ali S/O Munshi R/O Meen Charkan ... on 6 October, 2023
(xi) When the authorities are disabled from performing duties due to impossibility, it would be a
sufficient excuse for them to save them from rigour of provisions of Section 24. A litigant may have a
good or a bad cause, be right or wrong. But he cannot be permitted to take advantage of a situation
created by him by way of an interim order passed in his favour by the Court at his instance.
Although provision of Section 24 does not discriminate between landowners, who are litigants or
nonlitigants and treat them differently with respect to the same acquisition, it is necessary to view
all of 25 LPAOW NO.1/2017 c/w LPAOW NOs.2/2017 & 3/2017 them from the stand point of the
intention of the Parliament. Otherwise, anomalous results may occur and provisions may become
discriminatory in itself;
(xii) The law does not expect the performance of the impossible;
(xiii) An act of the court shall prejudice no man;
(xiv) When there is a disability to perform a part of the law, such a charge has to be excused. When
performance of the formalities prescribed by a statute is rendered impossible by circumstances over
which the persons concerned have no control, it has to be taken as a valid excuse;
(xv) The Court can under its inherent jurisdiction ex debito justitiae has a duty to mitigate the
damage suffered by the defendants by the act of the Court;
(xvi) No person can suffer from the act of Court and an unfair advantage of the interim order must
be neutralised; (xvii) No party can be permitted to take shelter under the cover of Court's order to
put the other party in a disadvantageous position;
(xviii) If one has enjoyed under the Court's cover, that period cannot be included towards inaction of
the authorities to take requisite steps under Section 24 as the State authorities would have acted and
passed an award determining compensation but for the Court's order. Therefore also, the original
writ petitioners - land owners shall not be entitled to enhanced amount of compensation under
Section 24(1)(a) of the Act, 2013 on the ground that as the award has not been declared they shall be
entitled to compensation under the Act, 2013.
6. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above and our specific finding that with respect to
the lands acquired under the provisions of the J & K Act, 1990 Section 24(1)(a) of the Act, 2013 shall
not be applicable and even otherwise as observed hereinabove on merits also as the award could not
be declared due to the pendency of the writ petitions before the High Court and the order of status
quo, the High Court has committed a serious error in directing the appellants to pay the amount of
compensation under the Act, 2013. To that extent the impugned common judgment and order
passed by the High Court is unsustainable, both on facts as well as on law.
..............................................(cid:129) 26 LPAOW NO.1/2017 c/w LPAOW NOs.2/2017 & 3/2017
32. Judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Nissar Ahmed Ganai (supra) is, thus, complete
answer to the second question.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126490428/ 15
J&K Housing Board Through Its Managing ... vs Raj Ali S/O Munshi R/O Meen Charkan ... on 6 October, 2023
33. Having answered both the questions, we are of the firm opinion that the judgment of the Writ
Court is not sustainable and, therefore, deserves to be set aside. We also take note of the fact that the
acquisition proceedings initiated by the appellant No.2 by issuing 4(1) notification followed by
several other notifications under the State Land Acquisition Act could not be taken to logical end
due to the writ petitioners approaching the Court and getting the said proceedings quashed by the
Writ Court. Had the writ petitioners not approached the Writ Court and stalled the process of land
acquisition, the acquisition proceedings could have culminated into passing of an award much
before the commencement of the J&K Reorganization Act, 2019. The writ petitioners cannot be
given the benefit of involving the appellants in litigation and getting the process of land acquisition
stalled.
34. We, however, cannot lose sight of the fact that the process of acquisition in the instant case was
initiated by respondent No.2 by issuing notification under Section 4(1) of the State Land Acquisition
Act on 12.09.2011 and that would be the relevant date in terms of Section 11(1)(a) for determination
of value of the land for the purposes of assessment of compensation. May be 27 LPAOW NO.1/2017
c/w LPAOW NOs.2/2017 & 3/2017 because of litigation, an award of compensation has not been
passed and we are in the year 2023. Allowing the respondent No.2 to acquire land by determining
the value of the land to be acquired as was prevalent on 12.09.2011 and pay the compensation on
such rates to the interested persons would be harsh and highly inequitable. We are aware that we do
not have the powers akin to the powers conferred on the Supreme Court under Article 142 of the
Constitution of India to pass orders to do complete justice between the parties but the powers
conferred upon the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution are also wide enough to
provide substantial justice to the parties before it. Jurisdiction vested in the High Court under
Article 226 is not only extraordinary but is also equitable. While we have upheld the proceedings
initiated by the appellant No.2 under the State Land Acquisition Act and permitted him to go ahead
with such proceedings to culminate them into passing of final award, yet we deem it appropriate and
in the interest of justice to direct respondent No.2 to work out the compensation by reference to the
value of land under acquisition in the year 2023, of course, as per the provisions of State Land
Acquisition Act. This would serve the ends of justice.
35. In view of the discussion made above, all these appeals filed by the appellants are allowed and
the order and judgment dated 28 LPAOW NO.1/2017 c/w LPAOW NOs.2/2017 & 3/2017 25.10.2016
passed in OWP Nos.733/2013, 850/2013 and 1537/2013 is set aside. The respondent No.2-Collector
Land Acquisition, J&K Housing Board shall proceed ahead with the land acquisition proceedings
from the stage at which these were quashed and pass the final award without any further delay and
determine compensation by reference to the value of land under acquisition in the year 2023 by
strictly following the provisions of State Land Acquisition Act.
