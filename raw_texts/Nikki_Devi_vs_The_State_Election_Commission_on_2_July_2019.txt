ORAL JUDGMENT
(Per: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE)
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/125514580/ 1
Nikki Devi vs The State Election Commission ... on 2 July, 2019
Date : 02-07-2019
This appeal arises out of an election dispute to the
office of Mukhiya, Gram Panchayat, Rakiya, Block Sattar
Kataiya, Saharsa governed by the provisions of the Bihar Gram
Panchayat Raj Act, 2006 and the rules framed thereunder.
2. The appellant along with the contesting
respondent Chanda Devi was one of the candidates for the office
of Mukhiya of the Gram Panchayat in question in the 2016
elections. In the Nomination Form the appellant disclosed that
she has completed more than 30 years of age. This Nomination
Form was filled up on 4th of April, 2016. Along with the form
she also submitted a Notary Affidavit and in Column 6 thereof
she disclosed her educational qualification as having passed
Matric from a Sanskrit Madhyamik Vidyalaya, Jagatpur, Supaul.
In the bio-data form which was to be filled up in terms of the
directives of the Election Commission against Column 5 she
indicated her date of birth as 1st of January, 1986 and her
educational qualification as Matric.
3. Her Nomination Form was accepted and she
Patna High Court L.P.A No.301 of 2019 dt.02-07-2019
3/35
contested the elections and was declared elected.
4. The respondent Chanda Devi filed Election
Petition No. 10 of 2016 before the prescribed authority namely
the learned Munsif, Saharsa challenging the election of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/125514580/ 2
Nikki Devi vs The State Election Commission ... on 2 July, 2019
appellant alleging corrupt practice by making false declarations,
particularly with regard to her name, her educational
qualification as well as her date of birth. Since the bone of
contention between the parties was confined to the aforesaid
issues primarily, it would be apt to refer to Paragraphs 10 and 12
of the Election Petition where these allegations have been made
and the denial thereof in Paragraphs 13 and 15 of the written
statement filed by the appellant. Oral evidence and documentary
evidence was filed by both the parties that has been discussed
by the learned Munsif who allowed the Election Petition on the
ground that the appellant had made a false declaration about her
educational qualification as well as about her date of birth which
renders the Nomination Papers unacceptable and, therefore, an
incorrect acceptance of nomination on the basis of a false
information led to the conclusion that the election result stood
vitiated and accordingly the election of the appellant was set
aside. While recording findings, the learned Munsif, however,
did not find the allegation of different names being depicted by
Patna High Court L.P.A No.301 of 2019 dt.02-07-2019
4/35
the appellant to be valid and rejected the said contention of the
election petitioner. However, as noted above, the Election
Petition was allowed on the other two grounds of false
declaration relating to educational qualification and date of
birth.
5. Aggrieved, the appellant filed the writ petition,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/125514580/ 3
Nikki Devi vs The State Election Commission ... on 2 July, 2019
the judgment dated 28.01.2019 whereof has given rise to this
appeal whereby the learned Single Judge has upheld the order of
the learned Munsif setting aside the election of the appellant
categorically recording that since a false declaration would
result in rejection of the nomination of the candidate, therefore,
the findings recorded by the Munsif on the issue of date of birth
and the educational qualification is correct.
6. The learned Single Judge also found that the
judgments cited at the Bar in support of the respondent's
contentions clearly support the stand of the election petitioner.
The learned Single Judge has further held that the appellant had
the opportunity to tender evidence of having either passed the
Matric or Intermediate examination and also about the date of
birth, but since the appellant had failed to do so, the learned
Munsif was justified in setting aside her election.
7. Assailing the aforesaid findings Shri S.B.K.
Patna High Court L.P.A No.301 of 2019 dt.02-07-2019
5/35
Mangalam, learned counsel for the appellant has urged that the
declaration to be made in the Nomination Form is only about
the age of a candidate in order to ensure that the candidate is
above 21 years of age. He submits that there is no requirement
of indicating the date of birth in the Nomination Form. He then
submits that the affidavit filed in support of the nomination also
does not require the indication of date of birth and against the
column of educational qualification, the qualification and the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/125514580/ 4
Nikki Devi vs The State Election Commission ... on 2 July, 2019
name of the school has to be mentioned which has been done by
the appellant correctly. In the description contained in the bio-
data which is a document in the shape of a form provided by the
Election Commission, the date of birth has been indicated as 1 st
of January, 1986. It is the submission of Shri Mangalam that
whatever be the dates of birth which have been indicated in the
impugned judgments, none of them reduces the age of the
appellant to be less than 21 years and, therefore, the appellant
has nowhere furnished a false information in this regard. He
further submits that there is no allegation in the entire Election
Petition that the appellant has not matriculated. In the absence
of any cogent evidence having been led in support of the
Election Petition to substantiate the allegation about the age of
the appellant being less than 21 years, the finding recorded by
Patna High Court L.P.A No.301 of 2019 dt.02-07-2019
6/35
the learned Munsif and accepted by the learned Single Judge
seems to be a finding recorded on erroneous considerations
without adverting to the statutory requirement of only
mentioning the age of a candidate.
8. He further submits that no evidence was filed to
establish that the appellant had not passed the Matriculation
examination from the school as disclosed in the Nomination
Form. Thus, there was neither any specific averment nor was
there any proof to dislodge the declaration made by the
appellant that she had matriculated.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/125514580/ 5
Nikki Devi vs The State Election Commission ... on 2 July, 2019
9. He has further submitted that the mentioning of
the qualification of Intermediate in respect of the elections of
2011 is absolutely irrelevant, inasmuch as, any information
tendered with regard to the previous election cannot be used as
an information in respect of the Nomination Form filled up for
the fresh elections in 2016. It is urged that the learned Munsif
has, therefore, completely erred in placing reliance on the
declaration of the qualification in the documents of the 2011
elections. This misplaced approach has also been accepted by
the learned Single Judge and, therefore, the impugned judgment
is vitiated.
10. Responding to the aforesaid submissions,
Patna High Court L.P.A No.301 of 2019 dt.02-07-2019
7/35
learned counsel for the contesting respondent Chanda Devi has
urged that during the pendency of this appeal fresh elections
have been held in March, 2019 and a certificate to that effect
dated 12th March, 2019 has been issued by the Election Officer
in favour of one Smt. Raj Kumari Devi. A photostat copy of the
said certificate has been placed before the Court. He, therefore,
submits that the appellant cannot succeed so long as the newly
elected person is not made a party.
11. We may put on record that long before we had
called upon the respondents on 26th February, 2019 to file a
counter affidavit and had also directed that any election, if held
in the meantime, shall be subject to the outcome of the appeal.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/125514580/ 6
Nikki Devi vs The State Election Commission ... on 2 July, 2019
Thus, the respondent-State was fully aware of the said order and
it was the duty of the State and its agencies to have informed
this fact to the Commission and that the Election Certificate and
other documents would be subject to the outcome of this appeal.
12. Shri Amit Shrivastava, learned counsel for the
State Election Commission has produced the copies of the
letters dated 28.02.2019 and 10.05.2019 wherein the State
Election Commission has informed the District Election
Officer that the present Special Appeal has been filed and if the
elections are to be held then the same shall be subject to the
Patna High Court L.P.A No.301 of 2019 dt.02-07-2019
8/35
outcome of this appeal. The elections were held in March, 2019
and the elected candidate Raj Kumari Devi has given a
declaration, a copy whereof has also been produced by Shri
Shrivastava indicating therein that she was fully aware of the
pendency of this appeal and that her elections would be subject
to the outcome of this appeal.
13. In the said background any fresh elections
would survive in the event the present appeal fails and not
otherwise. The election held during the intervening period of the
pendency of this appeal, therefore, has either to sustain itself or
fall through on the outcome of the present appeal. We, therefore,
do not find it necessary at this stage to adjourn the matter and
issue fresh notices to the newly elected candidate, the elections
whereof are by operation of law subject to the outcome of this
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/125514580/ 7
Nikki Devi vs The State Election Commission ... on 2 July, 2019
appeal as indicated in the order dated 26.02.2019.
14. Learned counsel for the contesting respondent
has then urged that the inconsistent declaration of educational
qualification by the appellant namely Intermediate in the
election documents of the 2011 elections and Matriculation in
the documents of 2016 elections clearly establishes the
tendering of false information, and with no proof being tendered
before the Election Tribunal with regard to any of the
Patna High Court L.P.A No.301 of 2019 dt.02-07-2019
9/35
qualifications, has rightly resulted in the setting aside of the
election. He then submits that there are four dates of birth of the
appellant, 26.10.1987 in the election papers of the year 2011, 1 st
of January, 1986 in the election papers of 2016, 12 th of October,
1986 in one of the exhibits and 2 nd of November, 1989 in her
Life Insurance Corporation documents. This inconsistency could
not be denied or even explained by the appellant before the
Election Tribunal or even before the learned Single Judge and,
therefore, the only inference that has been rightly drawn is that
the appellant had tendered false information which clearly
resulted in an improper acceptance of nomination that has
materially affected the results arising out of a corrupt practice
and, therefore, the election has rightly been set aside. No
evidence was led forth on behalf of the appellant to substantiate
her claim and, therefore, the learned Munsif and the learned
Single Judge have not committed any error in arriving at the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/125514580/ 8
Nikki Devi vs The State Election Commission ... on 2 July, 2019
conclusions setting aside the election of the appellant.
15. Shri Amit Shrivastava, learned counsel for the
State Election Commission and the learned Standing Counsel
for the State have also been heard. They have pointed out the
various provisions under the 2006 Act read with the rules
framed thereunder and have also handed over a copy of the
Patna High Court L.P.A No.301 of 2019 dt.02-07-2019
10/35
instructions issued on 8th February, 2016 by the State Election
Commission of Bihar which contains all the documents
requiring the furnishing of information by a candidate proposing
to contest elections. Sri Shrivastava has also produced the letters
of the Election Commission dated 28.02.2019 and 10.05.2019 as
well as the declaration and undertaking by Raj Kumari Devi as
noted above.
16. Having heard learned counsel for the parties, it
would be appropriate to commence with the statutory provisions
involved in the present controversy. Section 125-A (1) (v), (2)

23. A perusal of the said pro forma would indicate
that the only declaration to be made in the Nomination Paper is
about the completion of the minimum age of the candidate
which is to ensure that the candidate is above 21 years of age. In
the instant case, the appellant has disclosed her age to be about
30 years.

Nikki Devi vs The State Election Commission ... on 2 July, 2019
24. At this very stage, we may put on record that
no evidence was led by the Election Petitioner to establish that
the appellant was less than 21 years of age. The only contention
raised was about the reflection of incorrect dates of birth and on
that basis it is alleged that the declaration was false.
25. The election-petitioner filed a document that
was labeled as Exhibit-3 which is an information obtained
under the R.T.I. regarding date of birth from a school Madhya
Vidyalaya, Parsauni, District- Supaul. It is alleged that the date
of birth mentioned in the said document is 12 th of October
1986. The contents of this certificate was not proved before the
Tribunal by any oral evidence except that it was used to
demonstrate a contradiction in the dates of birth. This does not
advance the cause of the election-petitioner in any way,
inasmuch as, the year of birth i.e. 1986 remains the same. We
are surprised that the Tribunal has culled out an admission on
the part of the appellant in her written statement about false
declaration. The Tribunal has recorded that the appellant has
admitted the fact of her age being depicted on the basis of
estimation. It is well settled that an admission has to be a clear
admission and not a mere ambiguous statement. In the instant
case, the written statement nowhere admits of a false
Patna High Court L.P.A No.301 of 2019 dt.02-07-2019
23/35
declaration. It is the Tribunal which has inferred that since the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/125514580/ 19
Nikki Devi vs The State Election Commission ... on 2 July, 2019
appellant has admitted the date of birth having been given on
estimation would amount to a false declaration. There is no
evidence which may indicate that the appellant was less than
21 years as on the date of her filing of her nomination. Had
there been any such evidence led by the election-petitioner and
not denied by the appellant, it is only then it could have been
inferred that the appellant's nomination papers were
improperly accepted. This being not the case of the election-
petitioner, the finding recorded by the Election Tribunal on this
count is erroneous as it has treated its own inference as an
admission of the appellant. The said logic, therefore, is
unacceptable and the finding of the Tribunal is, therefore,
vitiated. We may add that the burden to prove the fact that the
appellant was less than 21 years of age lay on the election-
petitioner. This burden could not be discharged by any
substantial evidence and, therefore, the ingredients of Section
101 of the Indian Evidence Act were not satisfied. The date of
birth becomes material only if it reflects that the candidate
could be less than 21 years of age as on the date of nomination
all the four dates of birth that were pleaded by the election-
petitioner included two dates of 1986, one date of 1987 and the
Patna High Court L.P.A No.301 of 2019 dt.02-07-2019
24/35
3rd date reflected in the evidence was of 1989. None of the
aforesaid in any way could prove that the appellant was less
than 21 years of age. Thus, the results of the election were not
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/125514580/ 20
Nikki Devi vs The State Election Commission ... on 2 July, 2019
materially affected nor such contradictory information as
alleged was proved to have resulted in any wrong opinion
being formed by the voters. The voters do have the right to
know but that is about the minimum age required to contest the
elections and not the exact date of birth of the candidate. A
voter can form a wrong opinion if the date of birth reflected by
the candidate reduces his age to be less than 21 years and then
it will definitely be an improper acceptance of a nomination
form that would materially affect the result of the election. This
is not the case here and as noted above, all the dates of birth
clearly establish that in the year 2016 the appellant was more
than 21 years of age. She was, therefore, eligible and not
disqualified.
26. To say that she adopted some corrupt practice
to advance her cause of elections by spreading false
information about her age was, therefore, not established by the
election-petitioner. We are emphasizing this, inasmuch as, by
applying the law the Tribunal as well as the learned Single
Judge have both not traversed the facts in the right perspective
Patna High Court L.P.A No.301 of 2019 dt.02-07-2019
25/35
in the present case. What appears to have been working in the
mind of the Tribunal as well as the learned Single Judge is that
any contradictory depiction of date would automatically result
in it being a false information that would automatically
crystallize in the rejection of the Nomination Paper. We do not
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/125514580/ 21
Nikki Devi vs The State Election Commission ... on 2 July, 2019
find this logic to be correct, inasmuch as, a Nomination Paper
can be rejected only if the depiction of an incorrect date of
birth results in establishing that the candidate was less than 21
years of age which is the material fact relevant for the purpose
of arriving at the conclusion on the issue of the results of the
election having been affected materially. The factum of the
appellant being less than 21 years could not be proved in terms
of Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act, whereas the assertion
of the appellant about her age remained uncontroverted either
in the pleadings of the Election Petition or in the oral evidence
led by the election-petitioner.
27. The judgments, therefore, relied on by the
learned counsel for the respondent and by the learned Single
Judge would not apply on the peculiar facts of the present case.
The judgment cited by Shri Shrivastava in the case of Joshna
Gouda Vs. Brundaban Gouda and another, reported in
(2012) 5 SCC 634 is closer to the contention raised by the
Patna High Court L.P.A No.301 of 2019 dt.02-07-2019
26/35
appellant on this issue.
28. The Supreme Court in the case of Mangani
Lal Mandal Vs. Bishnu Deo Bhandari, reported in A.I.R.
2012 SC 1094 has after recording the earlier precedents in this
regard held that it is for the election-petitioner to establish that
the results of the election has been materially affected and then
only can election be annulled. As held in the said case, the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/125514580/ 22
Nikki Devi vs The State Election Commission ... on 2 July, 2019
Tribunal was under an obligation to have framed an issue and
answer it accordingly. We do not find any such issue out of the
10 issues framed by the Tribunal relating to the results having
been materially affected. This also vitiates the order of the
Tribunal and which aspect has also been not dealt with by the
learned Single Judge.
29. Having said so, we find that the different dates
of birth as disclosed does not materially affect the result of the
election, inasmuch as, the declaration of her age as being above
21 years has not been controverted or dislodged by any evidence
led by the election-petitioner. The election petitioner did not
lead any evidence to demonstrate that the results had been
materially affected. Thus, by way of an inference on the strength
of the documents of 2011 elections, there was no evidence to
dislodge the educational qualification of Matriculate and
Patna High Court L.P.A No.301 of 2019 dt.02-07-2019
27/35
consequently the same cannot be held to be a false declaration.
The declaration of age as 30 years also does not materially
affect the elections, inasmuch as, the declaration only depicted
that the appellant was eligible and of the minimum age as
prescribed under the Act and Rules that entitled her to contest
the elections. As noted above, no evidence was led to dislodge
the same by the election-petitioner and, therefore, no adverse
inference can be drawn on that count.
30. The requirements of the Election Commission
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/125514580/ 23
Nikki Devi vs The State Election Commission ... on 2 July, 2019
to fill up a form indicating the date of birth is a document that is
required by the Election Commission where the date of birth
was indicated as 01.01.1986. This was, therefore, a necessary
information as provided for under Rule 39. However, again
coming back to the point, the said information does not
materially affect the election so long as the appellant's age
above 21 years is not disputed.
31. On a close scrutiny of Section 125-A, we find
that certain information which is essential for the candidates to
be furnished apart from the information contained in the
Nomination Papers also includes the educational qualifications
of the candidate. As pointed out above, the appellant in the
Nomination Papers has mentioned to be possessed of a
Patna High Court L.P.A No.301 of 2019 dt.02-07-2019
28/35
Matriculate certificate from an Institution in Supaul. This fact
could not be dislodged by the appellant by leading any cogent
evidence even though he had made an allegation about the false
information having been tendered. In our considered opinion,
since there was no evidence to the contrary to contradict the
claim of the appellant having passed the Matriculation
examination from a Sanskrit Madhyamik School and having
obtained Matriculation, the same had to be accepted as the only
declaration made by the appellant. Once this is accepted, then
any declaration of having passed the Intermediate examination
in the previous election of 2011 is absolutely irrelevant,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/125514580/ 24
Nikki Devi vs The State Election Commission ... on 2 July, 2019
inasmuch as, the mentioning of that qualification in the papers
of the previous election cannot be a declaration in respect of the
elections of 2016. Thus, it is the declaration in the documents
made pertaining to the 2016 elections which could form the
basis of any challenge. The election-petitioner, as noted above,
has nowhere stated that the appellant is not a Matriculate or has
not passed the Matriculate examination. The election-petitioner
did not take any pains to obtain any information either under the
Right to Information Act or otherwise from the institution
concerned to dispute the fact of the appellant having passed her
Matriculation examination from the Sanskrit Madhyamik
Patna High Court L.P.A No.301 of 2019 dt.02-07-2019
29/35
Vidyalaya, Jagatpur at Supaul. In our opinion, it was the duty of
the election-petitioner to have discharged the burden by leading
positive evidence to dislodge the declaration made by the
appellant and, therefore, the election-petitioner having failed to
do so, the depiction of having passed Intermediate examination
in the documents of 2011 election cannot be a ground to
dislodge the declaration made by the appellant in 2016 that she
is only a Matriculate. We may also refer to the law laid down by
the Apex Court about the standard of proof that is required to be
established in election disputes. The Apex Court way back in the
case of D. Venkata Reddy Vs. R. Sultan and others, reported
in A.I.R. 1976 Supreme Court 1599 has held that all material
particulars with specific details have to be pleaded and then
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/125514580/ 25
Nikki Devi vs The State Election Commission ... on 2 July, 2019
proved. The burden, therefore, is heavy on the election-
petitioner and the standard of proof that is required to be
established is that which is required for establishing a criminal
charge.
32. This was again explained in the case of Joseph
M. Puthussery Vs. T.S. John and Ors., reported in A.I.R.
2011 Supreme Court 906 Paragraph 8 and Paragraph 12 of the
said judgment lays down the law that an election trial based on
the charge of corrupt practice has to be conducted as a criminal
Patna High Court L.P.A No.301 of 2019 dt.02-07-2019
30/35
trial. Not only this, oral evidence in the shape of hear-say
evidence which is easily procurable cannot be made the basis of
substantiating any charge.
33. The Tribunal has also referred to a document
which was exhibited by the election-petitioner as Exhibit-6. This
letter is stated to be an attested copy of a letter dispatched by the
Secretary, State Election Commission to the District Election
Officer indicating that an allegation of concealing facts has been
proved and, therefore, the appellant would be guilty for an
action to be taken under Section 125.
34. We may mention that while scrutinizing the
Nomination Form, if the Election Officer finds the information
to be such which is a failure on its part to provide as required
therein or gives false information knowingly or has reason to
believe to be false or conceals any information then a penalty is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/125514580/ 26
Nikki Devi vs The State Election Commission ... on 2 July, 2019
provided under sub-section (3) of Section 125-A. This is at the
stage of the filing of the nomination by a candidate. In the
instant case, the Nomination Papers were accepted and no action
is alleged to have been taken against the appellant pursuant to
any such declaration. The aforesaid letter Exhibit-6 and its
contents were not proved by the author of the said letter during
trial and, therefore, its admissibility had to be examined which
Patna High Court L.P.A No.301 of 2019 dt.02-07-2019
31/35
was not done by the Tribunal. Any reliance, therefore, placed by
the Tribunal on the said document was subject to any evidence
during the trial of the Election Petition itself. There is no
material indicated in the judgment of the Tribunal that the said
document was proved and that it led to a proof beyond
reasonable doubt to establish any concealment of material fact
so as to affect the results of the election. The Tribunal, therefore,
fell in error on that count as well.
35. There is another finding by the Tribunal which
requires notice namely the purpose of disclosure of educational
qualification to enable the electorate to make a choice between a
candidate with higher qualification and another with a lesser
qualification. The Tribunal has concluded that it is possible that
the electorate in their wisdom may prefer a candidate with a
lesser educational qualification. We are unable to gather any
logic to support this speculative assumption by the Tribunal.
We fail to see as to how the electorate knew in the year 2016
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/125514580/ 27
Nikki Devi vs The State Election Commission ... on 2 July, 2019
that the appellant had a higher qualification of Intermediate
when she had declared that she was only a Matriculate. The
election-petitioner has on the strength of this declaration made
in the year 2011 by the candidate taken it as a proof of false
information. We are surprised at the inference drawn by the
Patna High Court L.P.A No.301 of 2019 dt.02-07-2019
32/35
Tribunal, inasmuch as, there was no pleading nor any proof
adduced to establish that the electorate had been informed by
the appellant or any other person about her dual qualifications.
The availability of a documentary evidence said to have been in
the Nomination Paper of 2011 in our opinion has been stretched
too far by the trial court that too even erroneously to prove a
fact of dissemination of false information. The existence of a
false information is one thing and its dissemination to gain
advantage on the strength of such false information is another.
The election-petitioner could not establish that by depicting her
qualification as Matriculate the appellant had been able to woo
the voters and obtain a sympathetic opinion in her favour. The
finding of the Tribunal, therefore, does not stand to reason and,
therefore, the impugned judgment of the Tribunal is clearly
vitiated. The learned Single Judge also did not enter into this
aspect and simply concluded that this depiction of inconsistent
dates of birth is a defect of substantial character that would have
necessarily resulted in the rejection of the nomination of the
appellant. For this, the learned Single Judge has relied on the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/125514580/ 28
Nikki Devi vs The State Election Commission ... on 2 July, 2019
judgment in the case of Harikrishna Lal Vs. Babu Lal
Marandi, reported in (2003) 8 SCC 613. We have gone through
the entire judgment in the case of Harikrishna Lal (supra) and
Patna High Court L.P.A No.301 of 2019 dt.02-07-2019
33/35
we do not find any such ratio culled out therein relating to the
educational qualification of a candidate. The facts of the case do
not indicate even remotely that it was a case arising out of
educational qualification but was rather a case with regard to the
inconsequential description of the name of the elected candidate
where a challenge raised to the election had failed. The learned
Single Judge, therefore, appears to have incorrectly applied the
ratio of the said decision on the facts of the present case and the
impugned judgment dated 28.01.2019 is, therefore, vitiated for
the same reasons as the impugned order of the Tribunal dated
11.10.2018
that are both liable to be set aside.
36. We may also clarify that corrupt practice is a commission or an omission as understood under
Section 141 of the 2006 Act, whereas the incorrect acceptance of a Nomination Form is governed by
the other provisions, particularly Rules 38 and 39 of the 2006 Rules. A distinction, therefore, has to
be made between a corrupt practice as indicated above and that of an alleged false declaration as
understood under the 2006 Rule or even under Section 125-A.
37. On the issue of change of name, the finding has been returned in favour of the appellant and,
therefore, we need not go into the same as the said finding has not been challenged Patna High
Court L.P.A No.301 of 2019 dt.02-07-2019 by the other side.
38. Thus, on all counts, in our opinion, there was no cogent evidence so as to dislodge an elected
Mukhiya namely the appellant herein and, therefore, the learned Munsif committed an error in
recording findings contrary to the requirement thereby setting aside the election of the appellant.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/125514580/ 29
Nikki Devi vs The State Election Commission ... on 2 July, 2019
39. Similarly, the learned Single Judge also did not appreciate the contention raised and does not
appear to have examined the peculiar facts of the present case in the light of the statutory provisions
quoted hereinabove where an incorrect mentioning of date did not necessarily amount to a false
declaration resulting in an improper acceptance of the Nomination Paper so as to materially affect
the elections. The same cannot be said to be a corrupt practice which in any way would have possibly
influenced the voters to take a decision in favour of the appellant and vote for her. Consequently,
none of the two grounds on the basis whereof the election has been set aside were established.
40. The appeal for all the aforesaid reasons is allowed. The impugned judgment dated 28th January,
2019 in C.W.J.C. No. 21697 of 2018 and the order of the Tribunal dated 11.10.2018 in Election
Petition No. 10/2016 are set aside.
Patna High Court L.P.A No.301 of 2019 dt.02-07-2019 Election of the appellant to the office of
Mukhiya for the Gram Panchayat in question is upheld. The consequential election as informed by
the learned counsel of Smt. Raj Kumari Devi being directly governed by the order dated 26.02.2019
that had been passed prior to the elections also stands annulled being consequential in nature. The
respondent authorities including District Election Officer, Panchayat Saharsa and the District
Panchayatraj Officer, Saharsa are directed to restore the appellant to the office of Mukhiya of Gram
Panchayat, Rakiya.
