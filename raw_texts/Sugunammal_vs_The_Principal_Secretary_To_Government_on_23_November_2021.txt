dated 22.09.2011, No.11(2)/EGY/404(c)/2011 and to quash the same in respect of the

2. The Government of India by the communication dated 20.10.2009 accorded prior
approval for supplementary transmission system associated with Vallur Termal
Power Station for establishment of Tiruvalam 765/400 KV Sub-Station to facilitate
import of power to Southern Region especially to Tamil Nadu. In pursuance thereto,
the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board identified lands measuring to an extent of 150 acres
at Elayanallur Village for establishment of 765/400 KV Sub-Station by the fifth
respondent and 400/230 KV by the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board. In this regard, on
27.03.2010 the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board addressed a letter to the

the petitioners, no proper enquiry was conducted in determining the proper value. However, the
third respondent passed an award dated 29.03.2012 thereby determined the compensation. On
receipt of the said proceedings of the third respondent, the petitioners came to understand about the
acquisition proceedings.
5. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that all the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.No.14644 of 2012 etc. batch petitioners challenged G.O. Ms. No.77, Energy (C-1) Department,
dated 22.09.2011 and declaration under Section 6 of the Act on the ground that as per Section 17 of
the Act, the enquiry under Section 5-A of the Act can be dispensed in the cases as provided under
the said section and Section 17(2) enumerates the cases in which the urgency provisions can be
invoked and the possession of the land taken immediately and as per sub-section (b) immediate
possession is necessary for library or any educational institution, for construction of any building for
common use of the inhabitants of such village, or godown for any society or any dwelling house for
the poor, or any irrigation tank drainage channel or well, or any road. The present acquisition is not
for the above enumerated purpose. Therefore, the invocation of Section 17(4) in the present case is
without jurisdiction of the first respondent. He further submitted that the first respondent failed to
publish the notice under Sections 4(1) and 6 of the Act which are mandatory by law and the same
would prejudice to the petitioners.
5.1. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioners further submitted that when the provision
under Section 17(2) of the Act invoked, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.No.14644 of 2012 etc.
batch the first respondent must be satisfied that the acquisition of land is very urgent to invoke the
emergency provision. There must be material before the first respondent to invoke the emergency
provision. The requisition has been made on 19.05.2010 and the administrative sanction accorded
on 30.08.2011. Only after one year, the emergency provision was invoked, followed by the
declaration under Section 22.09.2011. Further the compensation was determined unilaterally on
23.09.2012. It would clearly show that the right of the petitioners under Section 5(A) of the Act is
arbitratively deprived and the entire acquisition proceeding is liable to be set aside.
5.2. He vehemently contended that though emergency provision was invoked by the first
respondent, there was no real and substantive urgency warranting invocation of urgency clause,
much less urgency warranting dispensing with enquiry under Section 5(A) of the Act. The
dispensing with the enquiry as contemplated under Section 5(A) of the Act is only directory in
nature and the owners of the land may dispense with enquiry under Section 5(A) of the Act, even as
per the provisions. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.No.14644 of 2012 etc. batch 5.3. In
support of his contention, he relied upon the judgement reported in 2011 (5) SCC 553 in the case of
Radhyshyam & ors Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh & ors., in which the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India
held that the property of a citizen cannot be acquired by the State or its agencies without complying
with the mandate provisions under Sections 4, 5A and 6 of the Act. A public purpose, however,
laudable it because the same have the effect of depriving the owner of his right to property without
being heard. Only in a case or real urgency, the State can invoke the urgency provisions and
dispense with the requirement of hearing the land owners or other interested person. The urgency
clause can be invoked only for the purpose of acquisition cannot brook the delay of even a few weeks
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/116356204/ 6
Sugunammal vs The Principal Secretary To Government on 23 November, 2021
or months. Therefore, before excluding the application of Section 5(A) of the Act, the authority
concerned must be fully satisfied that time of few weeks or months likely to be taken in conducting
inquiry under Section 5(A) of the Act will in all probability, frustrate the public purpose for which
the land is proposed to be acquired. Further held that if planned industrial development of the
district is treated as public purpose within the meaning of Section 4 of
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.No.14644 of 2012 etc. batch the Act, there was no urgency
which could justify the exercise of power by the State Government under Sections 17(1) and 17(4) of
the Act. Therefore, time required for ensuring compliance with the provisions contained in Section
5(A) of the Act, cannot by any stretch of imagination, be portrayed as delay which will frustrate the
purpose of acquisition.
5.4. He also relied upon the judgement reported in 2011 (4) MLJ 78 in the case of
S.Muthuvenkataseshan Vs. State of Tamil Nadu & ors., in which this Court held that the emergency
provision contained in Section 17 of the Act can be invoked if only the emergency is one of grave. In
the said case, the project was originally proposed in the year 1999, whereas the notification was
issued only in the year 2001 i.e., after two years. Thus, the Government itself allowed the proposal to
be kept pending for two years. The right to own property, though not a fundamental right, is now a
constitutional right under Article 300A of the Constitution of India and the same cannot be deprived
without following due process of law. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.No.14644 of 2012 etc.
batch 5.5. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioners also relied upon another judgment
reported in 2011 (4) SCC 769 in the case of Dev Sharan & ors Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh & ors., in
which the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India held that the concept of public purpose on this broad
horizon must also be read into the provisions of emergency power under Section 17 of the Act, with
the consequential dispensation of right of hearing under Section 5(A) of the Act. The Courts must
examine these questions very carefully when little Indians lose their small property in the name of
mindless acquisition at the instance of the State.
5.6. He also relied upon the judgment reported in 2012 (12) SCC 675 in the case of Bharat Sewak
Samaj Vs. Lieutenant Governor and ors., in which the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India held that the
authority must have subjective satisfaction of the need for invoking urgency clause under Section 17
of the Act keeping in mind the nature of the public purpose, real urgency that the situated demands
and the time facts., i.e., whether taking possession of the property can wait for a minimum period
within which the objections could be received from the landowners and the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.No.14644 of 2012 etc. batch inquiry under Section 5(A) of the
Act could be completed. Therefore, the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners in all the Writ
Petition submitted that though entire project has been completed and the sub-station is functioning
there on, the entire land acquisition proceedings lapsed and the respondent ought to have initiated
the proceedings afresh and liable to pay compensation under the new Act.
6. Per contra, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the fifth respondent submitted that the
entire procedure are duly followed and he has also produced the records to prove the same. In fact,
the entire project has been completed and now 765/400 KV Power Grid Station is functioning in the
lands which were acquired. The notification under Section 4(1) of the Act was published in the
Government Gazette No.309 dated 07.09.2011 and the same was published in local dailies viz.,

6.1. He further submitted that the land acquisition proposals approved by the Principal Secretary
and Commissioner of Land Administration on 02.02.2012. On 06.03.2012, direction under Section
7 of the Act was issued to the Land Acquisition Officer and Revenue Divisional Officer, Vellore. On
08.03.2012, the Public Notice under Section 9(1) of the Act was issued by the Land Acquisition
Officer. Therefore, the Land Acquisition Officer called upon the land owners including all the

Power, Government of India by the communication dated 20.10.2009 accorded prior approval for
supplementary transmission system associated with Vallur Thermal Power Station for
establishment of Tiruvalam 765/400 kv sub-station. In pursuant thereto, the Tamil Nadu Electricity

17 of the Act.
9. On 28.08.2010, the fourth respondent convened a public meeting at Elayanallur Village to
appraise the public the importance of the project. Taking into consideration of the urgency of the
project, the fifth respondent has initiated land acquisition process individually without reference to
the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board. In that regard, on 07.09.2010, the fifth respondent addressed a
