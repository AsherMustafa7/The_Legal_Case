case is pending against him. The Show Cause Notice dated 25.11.2016 was served on the petitioner
to explain why he be not removed from the service for furnishing false information and suppressing

Attestation Form. Learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that without holding any
enquiry the authority concerned has passed the impugned order dated 13.02.2017 removal from
service was passed for concealment of the facts and giving false information in the Attestation form
in column No. 12(1) (a) to (k) and on verification, the same was found to be false.
4. Learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that the petitioner submitted his
representation against impugned order dated 13.02.2017 and the same was rejected vide impugned

CWJC No.11838 of 2025 dt.15-10-2025 concealed the information and furnishing false information
with respect to criminal cases pending against him.
5. Learned counsel for the respondent-Railway submits that the younger brother of the petitioner
has made a complaint on 25.11. 2015 that the petitioner was in custody for last four years in offence
related to Section 302 of the IPC in FIR No. 125/2006. The authority has written a letter to the
Superintendent of Police with regard to the aforesaid case whether the same is pending against the
petitioner or not. The office of the Superintendent of Police, Buxar has informed the authority
concerned that the petitioner is named as one of the accused in the aforesaid FIR and petitioner had
already been convicted by the Fast Track Court -III, Buxar in Sessions Trial Case Number 10 of 2007
vide judgment of conviction dated 26.03.2010 and sentence order dated 30.03.2010. Learned

order of conviction and sentence Criminal Appeal (DB) No. 707 of 2010 before Hon'ble High Court
Patna and at the time of his initial appointment the criminal appeal was pending and he was on bail
and the petitioner has deliberately suppressed the material information in column number 12(1)(a)
to (k) in the Attestation Form and fraudulently obtained appointment on the basis of concealment of
the facts and Patna High Court CWJC No.11838 of 2025 dt.15-10-2025 he cannot be reinstated on
the post in question on the ground of acquittal. The termination of service of the petitioner was on
the factum of giving wrong information and the petitioner has never informed the authority
concerned about his involvement in any criminal cases so he has not deserved any sympathy and
petitioner was given proper opportunity of hearing and thereafter competent authority has passed
the speaking order after due compliance of principles of natural justice. Learned counsel for the
respondent- Railway further submits that in accordance with the terms and Conditions No.11 of the
initial appointment order dated 13.05.2015 the petitioner is not entitled to continue in service and
from a bare perusal of the appointment order/letter dated 13.05.2016, as the applicant was holding
purely temporary offer of appointment under two years period of probation in Railway. The
Condition No.11 of the conditional appointment order dated 13.05.2015 is reproduced hereinbelow:-

Jhabu Kumar Ram vs The Union Of India on 15 October, 2025
"The applicant submitted attestation form on 25.03.2015 and abovementioned
criminal case was quashed only vide judgment dated 23.03.2018 in CRA (DB) No.707
of 2010. Thus there can be no denial of the fact that applicant did conceal the
registration of a Criminal case against him. The Patna High Court CWJC No.11838 of
2025 dt.15-10-2025 suppression of Criminal antecedents inn the column 12(1) (a)to
(k) of the attestation form dated 25.03.2015 is deliberate act to procure fraudulently,
appointment and accordance with the terms and Conditions No.11 of the initial
appointment Order dated 13.05.2015 not entitled to continue in service."
6. Learned counsel for the respondent-Railway submits that the show cause notice dated 25.11.2016
was issued to the petitioner for breach of the condition of offer of appointment and furnishing
wrong information and from a bare perusal of the attestation form of the petitioner which suggests
that the petitioner has furnished wrong information and it is a clear cut case that the petitioner has
concealed the material information had not mentioned the criminal cases and he has been convicted
in the year 2010 and he has been appointed in the year 2015 which suggests that on the date of
furnishing attestation form he was convicted in criminal case and he had not disclosed the same in
his attestation form and learned Central Administration Tribunal has rightly rejected the claim of
the petitioner.
7. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties at length and perused of the material available
on the record, the Patna High Court CWJC No.11838 of 2025 dt.15-10-2025 petitioner has been
removed from the service on the ground of suppression of material facts in the attestation form and
the learned Central Administration Tribunal has rightly rejected the claim of the petitioner.
8. There is no merit in the writ application. Accordingly, it is dismissed.
9. Interlocutory application, if any, is pending, also stands disposed of.
(Sudhir Singh, J) I agree.
