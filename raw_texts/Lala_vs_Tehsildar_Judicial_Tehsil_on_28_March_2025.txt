think proper wise this Hon'ble Court."
Considering the fact that the case in issue relates to mutation and as per Rule 34(7) of U.P. Revenue
Code Rules, 2016 made under the U.P. Revenue Code, 2006, the mutation proceedings, being
summary in nature, ought to have been decided within 45 days if there is no dispute and if there is
dispute, then the same should preferably be decided within 90 days, however, in the instant case,
the proceedings for mutation are pending since 2024, this Court is of the view that no gainful
purpose will be served in keeping the present petition pending.
In view of above, the present petition is disposed of with a direction to the respondent
No.1/Tehsildar (Judicial), Tehsil Haidergarh, Barabanki to consider and decide the Mutation Case
No. T202404120500527 (Lala Vs. Brajlal) most expeditiously after affording full opportunity of
hearing to the parties to the litigation and without granting unnecessary adjournment to either party
preferably within a period of three months from the next date fixed in the case, if there is no other
legal impediment in this regard.
It is made clear that the Court has not examined the case of either party on merits and the Authority
concerned shall be free to decide the matter strictly in accordance with law.
With the aforesaid, the petition is disposed of.
