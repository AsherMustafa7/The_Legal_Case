M.Cr.C. No. 16278/2017
13/10/2017
Shri R.K. Dubey, learned counsel for the petitioners.
Shri Yogesh Dhande, learned Deputy Govt. Advocate
for respondent/State.
This is a petition under Section 482 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short 'the Code') prays for
staying the proceedings of order dated 18/08/2017 in S.T.
No. 236/2015 pending before Additional Sessions Judge,
Banda District-Sagar till the disposal of application
preferred by the petitioners under Section 323 of 'the Code'
in Criminal Case No. 183/2015, pending before learned
Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Banda District-Sagar.
It is submitted by the learned counsel for the
petitioners that on the basis of FIR dated 25/02/2015 lodged
by complainant-B.S. Dangi a Crime No. 77/2015 was
registered at Police Station-Banda, District-Sagar against
petitioners-Indraraj Singh, Parvat Singh, Brijesh Singh and
Chhatrapal Singh, thereafter, charge-sheet has been filed
against the petitioners for offence under Sections 294,324
and 307/34 of the IPC and subsequently S.T. No. 236/2015
has been registered against the petitioners, which is pending
before the Court of Additional Sessions Judge, Banda
District-Sagar at the stage of prosecution evidence. The
further submission is that regarding the same incident
another FIR was lodged by the petitioners against Rajaram,
Jogendra and Bhai Sahab Dangi on the same day and at the
same time at Police-Station Banda, Sagar, on the basis of
which Criminal Case No. 183/2015 has been registered
against aforsaid persons. The further submission is that
petitioners moved an application under Section 323 of 'the
Code' in Criminal Case No. 183/2015 making prayer that as
both the cases are regarding the same incident, therefore,
they may be committed to the same Court. The further
submission is that the Court of Judicial Magistrate First
Class, Banda is lying vacant, therefore, order could not
have been passed on this application, therefore, the
petitioners pray for stayingh the proceedings of order dated
18/08/2017 passed in S.T. No. 236/2015 pending before
Additional Sessions Judge, Banda District-Sagar till the
pendency of this application.
Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the
record.
From perusal of the record, it transpires that two FIR
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185206737/ 1
Smt. Guddo Bai Pandey vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 13 October, 2017
have been lodged by petitiners and complainant against
each other regarding the same incident. On the basis of FIR,
S.T. No. 236/2015 has been registered against petitioners
which is pending before learned Additional Sessions Judge,
Banda District-Sagar, while on the basis of second FIR
Criminal Case No. 183/2015 has been registered against
complainant party, which is pending before learned Judicial
Magistrate, First Class, Banda District-Sagar.
As both the cases are registered regarding the same
incident, therefore, they may be committed to the same
Court and as the Court of Judicial Magistrate First Class,
Banda is lying vacant, therefore, order could not have been
passed on application filed by the petitioners in Criminal
Case No. 183/2015 under Section 323 of 'the Code'.
Considering the facts and circumstances of the case,
learned Sessions Judge, Sagar is requested to transfer both
the cases to some another Court, where learned Sitting
Judge is available for hearing, so that they can be heard and
decided by the same Bench. So far as the stay of
proceedings in S.T. No. 236/2015 is concerned, this Court
does not find any ground for grant of stay as both the cases
are tried separately.
With the aforesaid terms this petition stands disposed
of.

ORDER
This is a petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short 'the Code')
challenging order dated 27/02/2016 passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Panna in Criminal
Revision No. 35/2015, whereby order dated 22/04/2015 passed by learned Judicial Magistrate, First
Class, Panna in MJC No. 64/2012 for enhancing the maintenance amount from Rs.700/- per month
to Rs.2,000/- per month has been affirmed.
Admittedly, the respondent is the daughter of the petitioner and is presently residing with her
mother . A petition under Section 125 of 'the Code' for grant of maintenance was filed on behalf of
respondent-Shivani Chourasiya in the year 2003, in which maintenance @ Rs.400/- per month was
awarded to her, vide order dated 29/02/2004 passed in MJC No. 148/2003. Later on a petition was
preferred under Section 127 of 'the Code' for enhancement of maintenance amount, in which learned
Magistrate, vide order dated 24/08/2007 passed in MJC No. 77/2006 enhanced the maintenance
amount from Rs. 400/- to Rs.700/- per month. Subsequently, another petition was filed under
Section 127 of 'the Code' for further enhancement in the maintenance amount. The learned
Magistrate, vide order dated 22/04/2015 passed in MJC No. 64/2012 enhanced the maintenance
amount from Rs. 700/- to Rs. 2,000/- per month. The order passed by the learned Magistrate was
unsuccessfully challenged by the petitioner before learned revisional Court. Feeling aggrieved with
the order of learned revisional Court, invoking extra-ordinary jurisdiction under Section 482 of 'the
Code' petitioner has come before this Court .
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185206737/ 11
Smt. Guddo Bai Pandey vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 13 October, 2017
The impugned order is challenged on the ground that respondent has attained majority and that the
petitioner is a low salaried person, therefore, he is not in a position to pay maintenance @
Rs.2,000/- per month .
As regards plea raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the respondent has attained
majority, no material was placed on record before learned Magistrate or before the learned
revisional Court that the respondent, who is studying in class 12th has attained majority. As regards
capacity of the petitioner to pay the maintenance, it is submitted at bar that the petitioner is earning
about Rs.13,000/- per month as a Govt. employee. In the prevailing inflationary situation, an
amount of Rs.2000/- p.m., as maintenance allowance for respondent-daughter cannot be said to be
excessive or unreasonable nor the petitioner can escape away from his liability to pay reasonable
amount of maintenance simply on the ground that he has a low income, therefore, it cannot be said
that impugned order suffers from any illegality, incorrectness and impropriety.
In view of the aforesaid, this petition sans merits, deserves to be and is accordingly, hereby
dismissed.
CC as per rules.

in Criminal Case No. SC-NIA/368/2013, whereby learned Magistrate has dismissed the complaint
preferred under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 on the ground that signatures
of the accused on the disputed cheque do not match with the signatures maintained by the Bank.

Smt. Guddo Bai Pandey vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 13 October, 2017
From the aforesaid it transpires that the learned Magistrate relying on the decision of apex Court in
the case of Vinod Tanna Vs. Zaheer Siddiqui & Ors. 2003(1) MPLJ 373 (SC); wrongly cited in the
judgment as Rajkumar Shukla Vs. Subodh Agnihotri 2003(1) MPLJ 373 (SC) has dismissed the
complaint holding that there is no match between the signatures on the disputed cheque and
signatures maintained by the Bank. The decision rendered by the apex Court in Vinod Tanna (supra)
has been later on, overruled by the apex Court in the case of Laxmi Dyechem Vs. State of Gujrat &
Ors, (2012) 13 SCC 375, therefore, learned Magistrate has committed an apparent error in
dismissing the complaint on the ground that signatures of the accused do not match with the
signatures maintained by the Bank.
In view of the aforesaid this petition deserves to be and is accordingly hereby allowed and impugned
order is hereby set aside, consequently, the matter is remanded back to the learned trial Court for
deciding the same afresh in accordance with law.

Shri Sanjay Sharma, learned counsel for the respondents.
This is a petition under Section 378(3) Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short 'The Code')
seeking leave to appeal against judgment and order dated 07/10/2015 rendered by Judicial
Magistrate, First Class, Seonimalwa, District-Hoshangabad in Criminal Case No. 555/2012 whereby
respondents have been acquitted with regard to offences under Section 294, 323, 325 and
506(II)/34 of the IPC.
Inviting the attention of this Court to the testimony of complainant-Radheshyam (P.W.1), it is
submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that testimony of the complainant was duly
corroborated by F.I.R. (Ex. P/8) lodged by the complainant after the incident so also by medical

Smt. Guddo Bai Pandey vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 13 October, 2017
testimony of Dr. A.K. Verma (P.W. 6), who has examined the complainant after the incident. It is
submitted that learned trial Court has recorded the acquittal on the ground that no independent
witness was examined in the matter and there are certain discrepancies in the testimony of
prosecution witnesses. It is further submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner/State that
learned trial Court has not properly appreciated the evidence on record. The contention is that
learned trial Court on the basis of trifling contradictions and anomalies available in the statement of
prosecution witnesses has recorded the acquittal against respondents.
On due consideration of the submission made by the learned counsel for the petitioner so also of the
perusal of record, it is found to be a fit case for grant of leave to appeal.
Accordingly this petition is allowed. Office to register the matter as a criminal appeal and list in due

First application of the petitioner came to be dismissed as withdrawn, vide order dated 18/07/2016
passed in M.Cr.C. No. 5346/2016.
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that trial against the petitioner commenced on
20/08/2016 and that in a period of more than one year not a single prosecution witness has been
examined in the matter. It is further submitted Police has not been able to execute the arrest
warrant on prosecution witnesses Arjun and Gautam despite multiple opportunities granted in this
regard by the Court. The submission is that considering the custodial period of the petitioner, he
deserves to be released on bail.
Though prayer for bail is opposed by the learned Govt. Advocate, however, considering the custodial
period of the petitioner so also the fact that prosecution has failed to produce its witnesses before
the Court, it would be appropriate to enlarge the petitioners on bail.
Accordingly, the petition is hereby allowed and it is directed that on furnishing personal bond by the
petitioner in the sum of Rs.40,000/- (Rupees Forty Thousand Only), with one solvent surety in the
like amount to the satisfaction of the concerned Chief Judicial Magistrate/Judicial Magistrate First
Class, he shall be released on bail, subject to the condition that he shall make himself available to

The allegations against the petitioners are that they were involved in theft of motorcycle.
It is submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioners that no motorcycle has been recovered
from the possession of the petitioners. It is also submitted that the petitioners have been implicated
in this case only on the basis of recovery of small cash amount from their possession, however, that
cannot be said to be an incriminating piece of material to connect the petitioners with the alleged

crime. Lastly, it is submitted that there is no apprehension of the petitioners running away from the
course of justice, if released on bail.
Though prayer for bail is opposed by the learned Govt. Advocate on the ground that petitioners are
having criminal antecedents, however, considering the nature of allegations made against the
petitioners so also the quality of material to support the same, it would be appropriate to enlarge the
petitioners on bail.
Accordingly, the petition is hereby allowed and it is directed that on furnishing personal bond by
each of the petitioners in the sum of Rs.40,000/- (Rupees Forty Thousand Only), with one solvent
surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the concerned Chief Judicial Magistrate/Judicial

Irshad,Islamuddin, Salim, Surendra Singh and six other persons hatched the conspiracy to loot the
property.
As per prosecution during investigation 26 tons copper wire cut into small pieces and kept in 550
gunny bags was recovered pursuant to disclosure said to have been made by co- accused Irfan. The
allegation against the petitioner is that he was a member of the gang who committed robbery of the
copper wire, however, the only material to connect him with the alleged crime is the disclosure
statements said to have been made by co-accused Irfan, Irshad and Sabir and recovery of a truck
bearing registration No. RJ-05-GA-4867, in which alleged stolen copper wire was transferred and
transported to Delhi.
It is submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that there is no material on record to
indicate that truck bearing registration No. RJ-05-GA-4867 was used for transporation of stolen
copper wire. It is further submitted that no fact as such has been discovered on the basis of the

Smt. Guddo Bai Pandey vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 13 October, 2017
disclosure statements said to have been made by co-accused Irfan, Irshad and Sabir. Lastly, it is
submitted that co-accused Islamuddin and Sabir have already been granted bail by this Court, vide
order dated 28/02/2017 and 31/07/2017 respectively passed in M.Cr.C. Nos. 2108/2017 and
8029/2017.
Though, prayer for grant of bail is strongly opposed by the learned Deputy Govt. Advocate, however,
considering the nature of allegations made against the petitioner so also the quality of material to
support the same, it would be appropriate to admit the petitioner to bail.
Accordingly, the petition is hereby allowed and it is directed that on furnishing personal bond by
petitioner in the sum of Rs.40,000/- (Rupees Forty Thousand Only), with one solvent surety in the
like amount to the satisfaction of the concerned Chief Judicial Magistrate/Judicial Magistrate First
Class, he shall be released on bail, subject to the condition that he shall make himself available to
the Police, as and when required during the investigation and will also remain present before the
trial Court as and when directed in that behalf.
CC as per rules.

This revision petition by the petitioner-husband calls in question the legality, propriety and
correctness of order dated 28/03/2017 rendered by 15th Additional Sessional Judge, Indore in
Criminal Appeal 727/2016, whereby the learned Judge partly allowed the petitioner's appeal under
Section 29 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (for short 'the Act') by
reducing interim maintenance to be paid to respondent-wife under Section 23 of 'the Act' from Rs.
3,000/- per month to Rs.2,000/- per month.

Smt. Guddo Bai Pandey vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 13 October, 2017
Learned counsel for the petitioner has invited the attention of this Court to Annexure A/6, which is
said to be certificate of petitioner's income. It is submitted that the petitioner's monthly income is
Rs.6,000/- and he is already paying maintenance to the respondent under Section 125 of the Code
of Criminal Procedure @ Rs.2,500/- per month, therefore, quantam of interim maintenance of
Rs.2,000/- per month is excessive and requires to be reduced appropriately.
Per contra learned counsel for the respondent-wife has invited the attention of this Court to para 19
of the of the impugned order, wherein learned appellate Court has found that the income of the
petitioner cannot be taken to be less than Rs.10,000/- per month, therefore, he can very well pay Rs.
2,000/- under Section 23 of 'the Act' and Rs.2,500/-under Section 125 of the Cr.P.C. It is also
submitted that annexure A/6 on its very face appears to have been prepared by the petitioner and
has thus no evedential value.
Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.
The appellant is a young able bodied person, therefore, the view taken by the learned appellate
Court that he can earn Rs.10,000/- per month cannot be said to be unreasonable or against the
record. An amount of Rs.4,500/- for maintenance cannot be said to be excessive or unreasonable
particularly looking to the prevailing trend of inflation and price-rise so also the standard of living of
the parties to the lis.
Keeping in view of the aforesaid, in the considered opinion of this Court, impugned judgment does
not suffer from any illegality or perversity, therefore, this petition is hereby dismissed in limine.
