case proceeded ex parte against him.
6. On the basis of pleadings of the parties, the Claim Tribunal framed seven issues. In support of
their claim case three witnesses were examined. A.W. 1 is Satish Chandra Singh, Claimant. A.W. 2
Sujata Singh Claimant and A.W. 3 who is eye witness has deposed that deceased Subhash Chandra

death report, Exhibit-5 photocopy of R.C. Book, Exhibit-6 is Insurance Policy, Exhibit-7 is driving
licence of deceased and Exhibit-8 is salary certificate of deceased.
8. The Tribunal held that accident took place as deceased lost control at the time of driving due to
sudden arrival of Nilgay. The tribunal held that vehicle at the time of accident was insured with
opposite party No. 2 appellant National Insurance Company Ltd. and opposite party No. 1 was the
owner of the vehicle and deceased was driving the vehicle having a valid driving licence, as such
opposite party No. 2 Insurance Company is liable to pay the compensation amount as vehicle was
insured by it. Tribunal has found the age of deceased to be 22 years and he was unmarried and has
taken the age of mother for purpose of multiplier and her age being 43 years has held appropriate
multiplier to be 15 as per second schedule of the M.V. Act. Income of deceased was Rs. 16,184/- and
has deducted 50% as personal expenses and has assessed Patna High Court MA No.145 of 2014
dt.26.07.2019 loss of dependency to be 14,56,560/- and thereafter under conventional head has
awarded Rs. 5000/- for loss of love and affection. Rs. 2000/- for funeral expenses and Rs. 2,500/-
for loss of estate and since 50,000/- has already been paid as interim award has directed Insurance
Company to pay compensation amount Rs. 14,160,60/- alongwith 6% interest per annun from the
date of filing of the claim petition till payment within one month from the date of judgment and
award and aggrieved from said order appellant National Insurance Company as well as claimant has
preferred two separate appeals.
9. It has been submitted on behalf of appellant Insurance Company that deceased cannot be treated
as a 3rd party as he himself was driving the car and stepped into the shoes of owner, as such his
dependents are not entitled for compensation. In an accident in which the vehicle was driven by the
deceased he cannot be considered as 3 rd party. It has been further submitted that in terms of
Insurance policy claimants could only be considered for grant of compensation in terms of
Insurance Policy of sum assured and premium paid for personal accident.
10. The counsel for the Insurance company has relied upon a judgment and order passed by this
Court dated Patna High Court MA No.145 of 2014 dt.26.07.2019 29.01.2019 passed in
Miscellaneous Appeal No. 674 of 2013 which is based upon judgment of Apex Court and the relevant
paragraph Nos. 4 is quoted below:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/135103712/ 3
Divisional Manager, National ... vs Sujata Singh And Ors on 26 July, 2019
"Learned counsel for the claimant/respondent does not dispute the aforesaid factual
position. In National Insurance Company Ltd Vs. Ashalata Bhowmik and Ors,
reported in Supreme Today 2018 0 Supreme (SC) 858, the Hon'ble Supreme Court
held that when the accident is caused due to negligence of the owner-cum- driver,
wherein the driver died, the insurer shall be liable to the extent of sum assured for
personal accident."
11. Although in the present case, accident did not take place due to any negligent or rash act of the
deceased but he lost control over the vehicle as all of a sudden a Nilgay came on the road resulting in
the accident causing his death. However, in such circumstances also the Insurance Company is
liable to pay to the extent of sum assured for personal accident which according to counsel for the
appellant is Rs. 2 Lacs.
12. Accordingly, the impugned award is not sustainable and is set aside and it is directed that the
insurance company shall pay only Rs. 2 Lacs alongwith 8% interest which is sum assured and
premium paid for personal accident from the date of filing of the claim petition. Since, 50,000/- has
already been paid as interim maintenance, Rs. 1,50,000/- remains to be paid Patna High Court MA
No.145 of 2014 dt.26.07.2019 to the claimant along with interest @ 8 per cent per annum.
13. For the reasons as stated above, M.A. 145 of 2014 filed by appellant Insurance Company is partly
allowed and judgment and award passed by the Tribunal is set aside. M.A. 789 of 2014 filed on
behalf of claimant is dismissed.
14. Statutory amount of Rs. 25,000/- which was deposited by the appellant at the time of filing of
appeal, a cheque of which be prepared by the Office in the name of claimant no. 1 be sent to the
concerned Tribunal for its payment to the claimant no. 1 and such payment is adjustable in the
compensation amount to be paid to the claimant by the insurance Company.
Both miscellaneous appeals are disposed of.
