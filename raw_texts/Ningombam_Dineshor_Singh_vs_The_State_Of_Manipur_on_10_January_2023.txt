Ningombam Dineshor Singh vs The State Of Manipur on 10 January, 2023
.... Private Respondents B E F O R E HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE AHANTHEM BIMOL SINGH For the
Petitioners :: Mr. S. Biswajit, Advocate For the respondents :: Mr. Lenin Hijam, Advocate General
asstd. by Ms. Caroline, Advocate; & Mr. A. Mohendro, Advocate Date of Hearing :: 23-11-2022 Date
of Judgment & Order :: 10-01-2023 JUDGMENT & ORDER [1] Heard Mr. S. Biswajit, learned
counsel appearing for the petitioners, Mr. Lenin Hijam, learned Advocate General assisted by Ms.
Caroline, learned counsel appearing for the respondents No. 1, 2 and 3 and Mr. A. Mohendro,
learned counsel appearing for some of the private respondents.
The issue involved in the present writ petition is about fixation of Inter-se-Seniority between
employees appointed under the Die-in- Harness Scheme and direct recruit/ promotees. [2] The
petitioners, 12 (twelve) in number, were all appointed as Office Assistants (LDA) in the General
Administration Department under the Die-in-Harness Scheme during the period between
18-02-2016 to 21-11-2016 and they have been serving as regular Government employees for the last
about six years. On the other hand, all the private respondents were appointed as Office Assistants
(LDA) as direct recruit WP(C) No. 948 of 2021 Contd.../-
candidates on 01-12-2016. Accordingly, the petitioners were appointed earlier than the private
respondents.
By an order dated 19-09-2019 issued by the Under Secretary (GAD), Government of Manipur, the
posts of Office Assistant and Senior Office Assistant were re-designated as Secretariat Assistant and
Senior Secretariat Assistant respectively with effect from the date of issue of the said order.
[3] The next promotional post from the post of Office Assistant (now Secretariat Assistant) is the
post of Senior Office Assistant (now Senior Secretariat Assistant) and according to the petitioners,
they are all eligible and qualified for promotion to the next higher post in terms of the relevant rules.
It is the case of the petitioners that there is at present more than 100 vacant posts of Senior
Secretariat Assistant available in the General Administration Department and as a measure for
filling up the vacant posts, the authorities issued a Tentative Inter-se-Seniority List of Secretariat
Assistants of Manipur Secretariat by issuing a Notification dated 05-11-2020 calling for claims and
objections to the fixation of the Inter-se-Seniority. In the said Tentative Inter-se-Seniority List, the
names of the petitioners are placed above the names of the private respondents. [4] On publication
of the said Tentative Seniority List, some of the private respondents submitted a joint objection to
the said Tentative Inter- se-Seniority List stating, inter alia, that indicating Die-in-Harness
appointees as direct recruit is not appropriate as they were appointed without undergoing any
recruitment process and that placing all the Die- in-Harness appointees of 2016 above the direct
recruit and promotees of WP(C) No. 948 of 2021 Contd.../-
2016 batch gave them undue advantage. It has also been stated that under the Office Memorandum
dated 11-11-2010 issued by the Government of India, it is provided under para 4.8 that persons
appointed on compassionate ground in a particular year may be placed at the bottom of all the
candidates recruited/appointed through direct recruit, promotion, etc. in that year irrespective of
the date of joining of the candidates on compassionate ground.

[5] Under para 4.8 of the said Office Memorandum dated 11-11-2010 issued by the Ministry of
Personnel, Public Grievances and Pension (DPT), Government of India, certain guidelines had been
laid down with regard to fixation of seniority of persons appointed on compassionate ground to the
extent that persons appointed on compassionate ground in a particular year may be placed at the
bottom of all the candidates recruited/appointed through direct recruitment/promotion, etc., in that
year, irrespective of the date of joining of the candidate on compassionate ground. The said
guidelines were reiterated under para 16 of the Office Memorandum dated 16-01-2013 issued by the
Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pension (DPT), Government of India for information,
guidance and necessary action by all concerned. Para 16 of the said Office Memorandum are
reproduced hereunder for ready reference:-
"16. Seniority -
A person appointed on compassionate ground in a particular year may be placed at
the bottom of all the candidates recruited/ appointed through direct recruitment/
promotion, etc. in that year, irrespective of the date of joining of the candidate on
compassionate ground".
WP(C) No. 948 of 2021 Contd.../-
[6] It is the case of the official respondents that under the Manipur
Secretariat Sub-ordinate Services Rules, 1982, there is no provisions for fixation of
seniority of an employee appointed under the Die-in-Harness Scheme. In order the
supplement the lacuna in the relevant service rules, the State Government issued an
Office Memorandum dated 06-03-2021 adopting to follow the guidelines under para
16 of the aforesaid O.M. dated 16-01-2013 issued by the Government of India with
regard to fixation of seniority of a person appointed on compassionate ground.
However, in para 2 of the said O.M., it is provided that the adoption shall be with
prospective effect for new appointment and no retrospective effect will be allowed.
Subsequently, the State Government issued another Office Memorandum dated
13-07-2021 amending para 2 of the earlier O.M. dated 06-03-2021. The amended
para 2 reads as under:-
"Para 2. Henceforth, the O.M. shall be applied in fixing Inter- se-Seniority List for
group of employees which include Die-in- Harness appointee whose Final Seniority
List has not yet been finalized. Seniority List already finalized shall not be reopened".
[7] After notification of the aforesaid Office Memorandums dated 06-03-2021 and 13-07-2021, the
Under Secretary (GAD), Government of Manipur, issued a Notification dated 06-10-2021 publishing
a Tentative Inter-se-Seniority List of Secretariat Assistants of Manipur Secretariat and inviting
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130468781/ 8
Ningombam Dineshor Singh vs The State Of Manipur on 10 January, 2023
objections to the fixation of the inter-se-seniority. In the new Tentative Inter-se-Seniority List, the
names of the private respondents are placed above the names of the petitioners in terms of the
guidelines for fixing of seniority between persons appointed on compassionate ground and
candidates appointed through direct recruitment/ promotion, etc. as contained in the aforesaid
O.M. dated 06-03-2021 and 13-07-2021.
WP(C) No. 948 of 2021 Contd.../-
Despite the written objections submitted by the petitioners to the Tentative Inter-se-Seniority List,
the authorities issued a Notification dated 16-12-2021 publishing the Final Inter-se-Seniority List of
Secretariat Assistants (formerly Office Assistants) of Manipur Secretariat. In the said Final
Inter-se-Seniority List, the private respondents are placed above the petitioners. Having been
aggrieved, the petitioners approached this court by filing the present writ petition with the prayer
for quashing and setting aside the Office Memorandum dated 13-07-2021 issued by the Department
of Personnel and Administrative Reforms as well as the Final Inter se Seniority List of Secretariat
Assistants dated 16-12-2021. [8] Mr. S. Biswajit, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners
submitted that the O.M. dated 06-03-2021 of the State of Manipur has already created a lawful legal
rights to the petitioners and the said O.M. cannot be amended behind their back without following
the principle of natural justice and without giving an opportunity of being heard. The act of the
official respondents in amending the earlier O.M. dated 06-03-2021 by issuing the subsequent O.M.
dated 13-07-2021 unilaterally and without complying with the principle of natural justice amounts
to bias, arbitrary and mala fide in nature and the same is not tenable in the eye of law. It has also
been submitted that the second clause of the impugned O.M. itself clearly demonstrated the mala
fide intention of the concerned authority to do away with the seniority of the Die-in-Harness
appointees, whose seniority could have been finalized long back and the same was delayed
intentionally by the concerned authority waiting for the private respondents to be qualified for
WP(C) No. 948 of 2021 Contd.../-
promotion to the next higher posts. It has also been submitted that the amendment of the earlier
O.M. dated 06-03-2021 was not necessary at all as the same had already been finalized, clarified and
settled. The dispute regarding inter-se-seniority between the compassionate appointees and other
appointees and that the conduct of the concerned authority clearly shows that they have just wanted
to favour the normal direct recruits/ private respondents and promotees by neglecting the essence
of the O.M. of the Government of India as well as the State Government.
[9] The learned counsel also submitted that once the State Government accepted the fact that there
is no rule for determining seniority of the employees appointed under Die-in-Harness Scheme, than
the O.M. on which the determination of the Seniority List is based on cannot be changed / amended
arbitrarily and that in the absence of any statutory rule governing the field in a particular
Department, seniority would be reckoned from the date of appointment and the same cannot be
affected retrospectively by adopting an O.M. It has further been submitted that an amendment
having retrospective operation which has the effect of taking away a benefit already available/
accrued to an employee under the existing rules/ O.M./ regulation, etc. is arbitrary and
discriminatory and violates the fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 14 and 16 of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130468781/ 9
Ningombam Dineshor Singh vs The State Of Manipur on 10 January, 2023
Constitution of India and that a administrative/ executive order cannot have retrospective effect so
as to take away the right accrued to an employee as per the earlier Circular. The learned counsel also
submitted that the Tentative Seniority List dated 05-11-2020, even though a final of the same was
WP(C) No. 948 of 2021 Contd.../-
not published, can be assumed to be finalized as the first four incumbents in the said Seniority List
have been promoted to the higher posts on 18-08-2021 in order of merit by acting upon the earlier
Tentative Seniority List and much before the publication of the impugned Final Seniority List dated
16-12-2021.
In support of his contentions, the learned counsel cited the following case laws:-
1. "S.K. Ghosh and anr. Vs. Union of India "
(1968 AIR 1385) Page 8. "..........It is thus, clear that the revision of seniority in the
grade of Directors of Postal Services by the order dated 17th January, 1966 was not
based on any rule r appropriate principle applicable to determination of seniority in
that grade, and must, therefore, be held to be totally arbitrary. Such an arbitrary
order, which affects the civil rights of the petitioners in respect of future promotion,
must, therefore, be stuck down as violating Art. 16 of the Constitution. Once this
order dated 17th January, 1966 is quashed, the petitioners will no longer be affected
in future by the revision of their seniority in the time scale of the service by the order
dated 5th June, 1965 and, ........
....... We allow this petition and quashed the order dated 17 th January, 1966 revising
the seniority of the petitioners and respondents Nos. 3 to 7 in the grade of Directors
of Postal Services......"
2. "Ajit Singh and ors. (II) Vs. State of Punjab & ors. "
(1977) 7 SCC 209 Para 22. "Article 14 and Article 16(1) are closely connected. They
deal with the individual rights of the person Article 14 demands that the "State shall
not deny to any person equality before he law and equal protection of the laws".
Article 16(1) issues a positive command that WP(C) No. 948 of 2021 Contd.../-
"shall be equality of opportunity for all the citizens in matters relating to employment
or appointment to any office under the State".
It has been held repeatedly by this court that clause (1) of Article 16 is a facet of Article 14 and that it
takes its roots from Article 14. The said clause particularizes the generality in Article 14 and
identifies, in a constitutional sense "equality of opportunity"
in matters of employment and appointment to any office under the State. The word
"employment" being wider, there is no dispute that it takes within its fold, the aspect
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130468781/ 10
Ningombam Dineshor Singh vs The State Of Manipur on 10 January, 2023
of promotions to posts above the stage of initial level of recruitment. Article 16(1)
provides to every employee eligible for promotion or who comes within the zone of
consideration, a fundamental right to be 'considered' for promotion. Equal
opportunity here means the right to be 'considered' for promotion. If a person
satisfied the eligibility and zone criteria but is not considered for promotion, then
there will be a clear infraction of his fundamental right to be "considered" for
promotion, which is his personal right.
"Promotion" based on equal opportunity and "seniority"
attached to such promotion are facets of fundamental right under Article 16(1)."
3. (2007) 5 SCC 447 "Southern Petrochemical Industries Co. Ltd. Vs. Electricity Inspector & Etio
and ors."
Para 118. "It is in the aforementioned context, that the doctrine of promissory estoppel is sought to
be invoked. We will notice hereinafter that even a right can be preserved by reason of invocation of
doctrine of promissory estoppel." Para 130. "We therefore, of the opinion that doctrine of
promissory estoppel also preserves a right. A right would be preserved when it is not expressly taken
a way but in fact has expressly been preserved".

4. (2006) 13 SCC 542
"Union of India & ors. Vs. Asian Food Industries"
Para 48. "The Delhi High Court, however, in our view correctly opined that the
Notification dated 4-7-2006 could not have been taken into consideration on the
basis of the purported publicity made in the proposed change in the export policy in
electronic or print media. Prohibition promulgated by a statutory order in terms of
section 5 read with the relevant provisions of the policy decision in the light of
sub-section (2) of section 3 of the 1992 Act can only have a prospective effect. By
reasons of a policy, a vested or accrues right cannot be taken away. Such a right,
therefore, cannot a fortiori be taken away by an amendment thereof."
5. (1997) 6 SCC 623 "Chairman Railway Board & ors. Vs. C.R. Rangdhamaiah & ors." Para 24. "In
many of these decisions the expressions "vested rights' or "accrues rights" have been used while
striking down the impugned provisions which had been retrospective operation so as to have an
adverse effect in the matter of promotion, seniority, substantive appointment, etc., of the employees.
The said expressions have been used in the context of a right flowing under the relevant rule which
was sought to be altered with effect from an anterior date and thereby taking away the benefits
available under the rule in force at that time. It has been held that such an amendment having
retrospective operation which has the effect of taking away a benefit already available to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130468781/ 11
Ningombam Dineshor Singh vs The State Of Manipur on 10 January, 2023
employees under the existing rule is arbitrary, discriminatory and violative of the rights guaranteed
under Article 14 & 16 of the Constitution. We are unable to hold that these decisions are not in
consonance with the decisions in Roshan Lal Tandon, B.S. Yadav and Raman Lal Soni."
6. (2010) 2 SCC 422 "Union of India & anr. Vs. Kartick Chandra Mondal & anr." Para 12. "It was also
submitted that neither CAT nor the High Court has any power to direct absorption of the
respondents when WP(C) No. 948 of 2021 Contd.../-
they have worked only for two years and on the date when OA No. 285 of 1990 was filed before CAT
they were not even working as casual workers. The further submission of the counsel appearing for
the appellant was that the office memorandum which was issued in 1985 could not have been relied
upon or made the basis for issuing orders in favour of the respondents, particularly, in view of the
fact that on the date when the aforesaid office memorandum was issued the respondents had
already been disengaged from service and were not working with the appellant 2.
Para 14. "In the light of the aforesaid submission of the counsel appearing for the parties we have
considered the entire records. So far as the Office Memorandum dated 7.5.1985 is concerned, the
same was issued by way of relaxation of the condition of recruitment of casual workers. But the fact
remains that the respondents working with the appellants only for two years i.e., from 1981 to 1983
and admittedly on the date when the aforesaid office memorandum which would indicate that there
was an intention to give a retrospective effect to the contents of the said notification. Instead, the
language used in the aforesaid notification clearly shows that the same was intended to be
prospective in nature and not retrospective. Para 16. "As has been noted earlier, the said Office
Memorandum stated that the same would apply only to those persons who might have been
continuing as casual workers for a number of years and who were not eligible for regular
appointment and whose services might be terminated at any time. Therefore, it envisaged and could
be made applicable to only those persons who were in service on the date when the aforesaid office
memorandum was issued. Unless and until there is a clear intention expressed in the notification
that it would also apply retrospectively, the same cannot be given a retrospective effect and could
always operate prospectively."

7. (2015) 7 SCC 412
"Canara Bank Vs. M. Mahesh Kumar"
Para 17. "Applying these principles to the case in hand, as discussed earlier, the respondent's father
died on 10-10-1998 while he was serving as a clerk in the appellant Bank and the resident applied
timely for compassionate appointment as per the scheme" Dying in Harness Scheme" dated
8.5.1993 claim on 30.6.1999 recording that there are no indigent circumstances for providing
employment to the respondent. Again on 7.11.2001, the appellant bank sought for particular in
connection with the issue of the respondent's employment. In the light of the principles laid down in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130468781/ 12
Ningombam Dineshor Singh vs The State Of Manipur on 10 January, 2023
the above decisions, the cause of action to be considered for compassionate appointment arose when
circular No. 154 of 1993 dated 8.5.1993 was in force. Thus as per the judgment referred in Jaspal
Kaur Case, the claim cannot be decided as per 2005 scheme providing for ex-gratia payment. The
circular dated 14.2.2005 being an administrative or executive order cannot have retrospective effect
so as to take away the right accrued to the respondent as per Circular of 1993."
8. (2004) 3 SCC 723 "Pramod K. Pankaj Vs. State of Bihar & ors."
Para 12. "The policy decision of the State as contained in the resolution of the State Government
dated 17.1`.1979 is not in question. It is accepted that the said resolution was adopted in the special
situation that 20% quota which was earlier reserve for graduate engineers was abolished, as a result
whereof they suffered immense prejudice. Clause (cha) of he said circular stats that the promotion
on the vacant posts of Assistant Engineers under the quota, mention in Clause (ka) i.e., 3% would be
made on the basis of seniority. In absence of any statutory provision or rules made thereunder or
under the proviso appended to Article 309 of the Constitution of India, it is trite that once an
incumbent is appointed to a post according to rules, his seniority has to be counted from the date of

"Uday Pratap Singh & ors. Vs. State of Bihar & ors." Para 6. "By a catena of decisions of this Court, it
is now well- settled that by an executive order the statutory rules cannot be whittled down nor can
any retrospective effect be given to such executive order so as to destroy any right which become
crystallized. In this connection, it is profitable to refer a decision of this court in T.R. Kapur V. State
of Haryana wherein it is held that rules framed under Article 309 of the Constitution cannot affect
or impair vested rights, unless it is specifically so provided in the stator rules concerned. It is
obvious that an executive direction stands even on a much weaker footing. It is true, as laid down in
Bishan Sarup Gupta V. Union of India, that effect of upgradation of a post is to make the incumbent
occupy the upgraded post with all logical benefits flowing therefrom and can be treated as promoted
to the post still it cannot be gainsaid that no retrospective effect could be given to any merger or
erstwhile lower branch into higher branch in the cadre so as to effect the vested rights of incumbents
already occupying posts in the erstwhile lower branch into higher branch of the cadre......" [10] Mr.
Lenin Hijam, learned Advocate General submitted that there is no provision under the Manipur
Secretariat Sub-ordinate Services Rules, 1982 for fixation of Inter-se-Seniority between the
employees appointed under the Die-in-Harness Scheme and employees appointed by way of direct
recruitment/ promotion in the same year and accordingly, the guidelines/ instructions issued by the
Government of India in its Office Memorandum dated 16-01-2013 with regard to fixation of
Seniority of compassionate appointees were adopted by the State Government by issuing Office
Memorandum dated 06-03-2001 in pursuance of the Cabinet decision taken on 09-12-2020 and the
subsequent amendment dated 13-07-2021 was issued as per Cabinet decision taken on WP(C) No.

06-07-2021. It has been submitted that the said Office Memorandum was adopted to bring clarity in
fixing of Inter-se-seniority amongst the direct recruit, promotees and employees appointed on
compassionate ground, who were appointed in the same year and that the Office Memorandum is
limited to those cases only where seniority has not yet been finalized as reconsidering seniority list
already finalized on the basis of the new Office Memorandum would be unjustified. It has further
been submitted that the adoption of the aforesaid Office Memorandums was a policy decision taken
by the Government and the Government has the power and authority to issue such guidelines/
instructions for fixation of the seniority and the petitioners have failed to point out that the said
Office Memorandums have been issued in violation of any statutory act/rules. [11] The learned
Advocate General strenuously submitted that the petitioners have neither pleaded in their writ
petition that the impugned Office Memorandum violated any of their Fundamental Right nor have
they denied the stand taken by the respondents in their counter affidavit and accordingly, the
petitioners have failed to make out a case for interfering with the impugned Office Memorandum
and the impugned seniority list and as such, the present writ petition is liable to be dismissed as
being devoid of merit. In support of his contentions, the learned Advocate General cited the
following case laws:-
1. (2013) 16 SCC 147, "Union of India and anr. Vs. Ashok Kumar Aggarwal"
"58. A Constitution Bench of this Court while dealing with a similar issue in respect
of executive instructions in Sant Ram Sharma v. State of Rajasthan, held: (AIR 1967
SC 1914, Para 7) WP(C) No. 948 of 2021 Contd.../-
"7. ....."It is true that the Government cannot amend or supersede statutory rules by
administrative instruction, but if the rules are silent on any particular point, the
Government can fill- up the gap and supplement the rule and issue instructions not
inconsistent with the Rules already framed."
"59. The law laid down above has consistently been followed and it is a settled
proposition of law that an authority cannot issue orders/office memorandum/
executive instructions in contravention of the statutory rules. However, instructions
can be issued only to supplement the statutory rules but not to supplant it. Such
instructions should be subservient to the statutory provisions. (Vide: Union of India
v. Majji Jangamayya; P.D. Aggarwal v. State of U.P.; Paluru Ramkrishnaiah v. Union
of India; C. Rangaswamaiah v. Karnataka Lokayukta and Joint Action Committee of
Air Line Pilots' Assn. of India v. DG of Civil Aviation)."
"60. Similarly, a Constitution Bench of this Court, in Naga People's Movement of
Human Rights v. Union of India, held that the executive instructions have binding
force provided the same have been issued to fill up the gap between the statutory
provisions and are not inconsistent with the said provisions."
"61. In Nagaraj Shivarao Karjagi v. Syndicate Bank, this Court has explained the
scope of circulars issued by the Ministry observing that it is binding on the officers of

"62. In State of U.P. & Ors. v. Maharaja Dharmander Prasad Singh, this Court held
that the order must be passed by the authority after due application of mind
uninfluenced by and without surrendering to the dictates of an extraneous body or an
authority.

2. (1988) 2 SCC 233
"R. Prabha Devi & ors. Vs. Government of India & ors."
"16. It has also been observed:
"In any event, the appropriate rule-making authority is the best judge in this regard.
The rule-making authority is certainly competent to amend the Rule and extend the
period from six years to eight years so as to make the direct recruits more
experienced and suitable for the higher post. That is a matter for the rule- making
authority; the Tribunal cannot sit in judgment over the opinion of the rule-making
authority. No court or Tribunal can substitute its own view in a matter such as this.
Such a rule framed by a competent authority cannot be struck down unless it is
shown to be violative of any Fundamental Right guaranteed to a citizen under the
Constitution."
[12] I have heard the arguments advanced by the learned counsel appearing for the parties at length
and carefully examined the materials available on record. The impugned Final Inter-se-Seniority
List dated 16-12-2021 was prepared on the basis of the Office Memorandums dated 06-03-2021 and
14-07-2021 issued by the Department of Personnel and Administrative Reforms (PD), Government
of Manipur. The petitioners only assailed the subsequent Office Memorandum dated 13-07-2021 in
the present writ petition. Under the first Office Memorandum dated 06-03-2021, it is provided that
a person appointed on compassionate ground in a particular year may be placed at the bottom of all
the candidates recruited/appointed through direct recruitment, promotion, etc., in that year,
irrespective of the date of joining of the candidate on compassionate ground. In para 2 of the said
Office Memorandum, it is provided that the said Office Memorandum shall be with prospective
effect for new appointment and no retrospective effect will be allowed. By WP(C) No. 948 of 2021
Contd.../-
the second Office Memorandum dated 13-07-2021, para 2 of the earlier Office Memorandum dated
06-03-2021 was amended as under:-
"2. Henceforth, the O.M. shall be applied in fixing Inter-se- Seniority List for group of
employees which include Die-in- Harness appointee whose Final Seniority List has
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130468781/ 15
Ningombam Dineshor Singh vs The State Of Manipur on 10 January, 2023
not yet been finalized. Seniority List already finalized shall not be reopened".
The said amendment was with prospective effect as no retrospective effect was given.
[13] The petitioners assailed the subsequent Office Memorandum dated 13-07-2021 basically on the
ground that they have accrued a right under the Office Memorandum dated 06-03-2021 with regard
to fixation of their seniority vis-a-vis direct recruit/ promotees and that such a right cannot be
denied or curtailed by the authorities by making the amendment under the second Office
Memorandum dated 13-07-2021 retrospectively. According to the petitioners, if the authorities
published the Final Seniority List before issuing the second Office Memorandum dated 13-07-2021,
the provisions under the first Office Memorandum dated 06-03-2021 would not have been
applicable in their case in view of para 2 of the said Office Memorandum and their names would
have been placed above the private respondents in the Final Seniority List.
It is the case of the petitioners that authorities have deliberately delayed the publication of the Final
Seniority List and published the same only after issuance of the second Office Memorandum dated
13-07-2021 which amended the beneficial provisions under para 2 of the first Office Memorandum
dated 06-03-2021, thereby depriving the valuable right of the petitioners with regard to fixation of
their seniority position. It is also WP(C) No. 948 of 2021 Contd.../-
the case of the petitioners that the authorities cannot retrospectively amend the beneficial
provisions under para 2 of the first Office Memorandum dated 06-03-2021.
[14] As noted herein above, while making the amendment under the second Office Memorandum
dated 13-07-2021, no retrospective effect was given and accordingly, this court is the considered
view that the amendment brought about under the second Office Memorandum dated 13-07-2021
will have only prospective effect. Accordingly, the arguments advanced by the learned counsel
appearing for the petitioners that the accrued right of the petitioners had been denied or curtailed
retrospectively by the authorities by bringing in the amendment under the second Office
Memorandum dated 13-07-2021 are misconceive and baseless.
[15] This court is also of the considered view that no Government employee, including the present
petitioners, can claim to have any Fundamental Right with regard to fixation of their seniority even
though they might have a legal right. The Inter-se-Seniority between the petitioners and the private
respondents was fixed for the first time by the Government under the impugned Final Seniority List
dated 16-12-2021 and prior to issuance of the said impugned Seniority List, there was no
Inter-se-Seniority between the petitioners and the private respondents. In view of the above, this
court is of the considered view that the Office Memorandum dated 06-03-2021 read with the
subsequent amendment made under the Second Office Memorandum dated 13-07-2021 are
applicable in the case of the petitioners and the private respondents in the matter of fixation of their
Inter-se-Seniority and this court did not find WP(C) No. 948 of 2021 Contd.../-
any irregularity or illegality being committed by the authorities in issuing the impugned Final
Seniority List. The seniority of Government employees have to be fixed as per the relevant and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130468781/ 16
Ningombam Dineshor Singh vs The State Of Manipur on 10 January, 2023
applicable rules and in the absence of such rules, their seniority have to be fixed as per applicable
guidelines/ instructions issued in that regard. As the Inter-se- Seniority of the petitioners and the
private respondents have not been fixed prior to issuance of the second Office Memorandum dated
13-07-2021, this court is of the view that the applicable rules for fixing of their seniority is the
provision under the first Office Memorandum dated 06-03-2021 read with the subsequent
amendment bought in the second Office Memorandum dated 13-07-2021 and that the petitioners
cannot claim that they have a right to have their seniority fixed vis-a-vis the private respondents
solely on the basis of the first Office Memorandum dated 06-03-2021.
I have also carefully perused all the case laws cited by the learned counsel for the petitioner and in
my considered view, none of the case laws are applicable in the facts and circumstances of the
present case. [16] In the affidavit-in-opposition filed by the respondent No. 2 and some of the
private respondents, it is clearly stated that the Final Seniority position of the persons appearing at
Sl. Nos. 1 to 4 in the Tentative Seniority List dated 05-11-2020 have already been fixed by the
Government under the Final Seniority List of Office Assistants (now Secretariat Assistants) notified
on 13-04-2018 and that on the basis of the said Final Seniority List, the said four incumbents were
promoted to the next higher posts. It has also been categorically stated that the WP(C) No. 948 of
2021 Contd.../-
Government has never acted on the basis of the said Tentative Seniority List dated 05-11-2020. The
petitioners have not controverted or denied such categorical statement made by the respondents
and accordingly, this court is not inclined to accept the contentions made on behalf of the
petitioners that the Tentative Seniority List dated 05-11-2020 had already been acted upon by the
Government before publication of the impugned Final Seniority List and that the said Tentative
Seniority List can be assumed to be finalized.
[17] In the present case, the petitioners have failed to make out a case that the impugned Office
Memorandum dated 13-07-2021 had been issued in violation of any statutory provisions or that by
issuance of the said Office Memorandum, any of their Fundamental Rights have been violated. In
such view of the matter, this court did not find any ground for interfering with the impugned Office
Memorandum dated 13-07-2021 and accordingly, the present writ petition fails and the same is
hereby dismissed as being devoid of merit. The parties are to bear their own costs.
