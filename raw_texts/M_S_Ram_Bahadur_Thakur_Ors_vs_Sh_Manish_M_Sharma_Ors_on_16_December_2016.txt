order the Company Law Board (CLB) while disposing of the Company
Application directed the appellants herein (respondents in the
application), inter alia, to pay the compensation amount of Rs. 15,84,

49,410.38 to the petitioners (respondents herein) within 60 days of the
receipt of the order.
The facts leading to the present matter may be
considered in some detail. Appellant No. 1 Ram Bahadur Thakur
Limited (hereinafter referred to as „RBT(cid:129)) was incorporated as a
company with its registered office in Bihar on 19.09.1974 by both the
appellant side family (the CBS Group) as also the respondents side
family (MMS Group) holding approximately 50% share each. After its
incorporation and until his death in 1992, Shri Madan Mohan Sharma,
the grand father of the two respondents was Chairman and Managing
Director of the Company. During 1975-1976 negotiations were
initiated between the Company and M/s. Travancore Tea Estates
Company Ltd.(TTE) for purchase of 9 Tea Estates. It is not in dispute
that the father of the two respondents, namely, Shri B.M. Sharma who
was residing in London at that time and continues to do so, was
involved in the negotiations, actively according to the appellants and
only to a limited extent according to the respondents. While the
negotiations were going on, ceiling proceedings under the Kerala Land
Reforms Act, 1963 (hereinafter referred to as the „KLR Act(cid:129) ), which
had the notified date as 1.1.1970, for the purpose of prohibition from
holding land in excess of ceiling area, even prior to the negotiations
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/168473195/ 2
M/S Ram Bahadur Thakur & Ors vs Sh. Manish M. Sharma & Ors on 16 December, 2016
were initiated against TTE. The TTE filed a statement before the Taluk
Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016
3/72
Land Board on 14.4.1970 containing declaration as to excess land and
therafter under the provisions of the KLR Act on 30.1.1972 a report
was prepared by the Assistant Collector, Devikulam indicating the
excess land held by TTE.
On 9.2.1976 an agreement for sale was entered into
between TTE and RBT with respect to 9 Tea Estates belonging to TTE.
On 26.2.1976 a draft statement was issued by the Taluk Land Board
(TLB) with respect to the excess land held by TTE against which
objection was filed by TTE on 23.6.1976. On 17.9.1976 TTE executed
a Sale Deed in favour of the appellant No. 1 with regard to 9 Tea
Estates which contained a clear recital that the assets are being handed
over free from all liens, charges and encumbrances save as expressly
disclosed to RBT. The schedule to the sale deed contained all the
survey numbers and the area which also included the excess land under
the KLR Act. Immediately after the sale deed on 9.10.1976 the TLB
submitted report regarding the excess land held by TTE and thereafter
on 13.11.1976 the TLB passed an order declaring 1444.36 acres of land
held by TTE to be in excess of the ceiling provided under the KLR Act
and directed TTE to surrender the said excess land. Certain excess land,
360.46 hectares, was surrendered to the TLB on 30.10.1984 for which
the declaration was filed by one Mr. P.P.Machiah, Senior Group
Manager of RBT about whom it is admitted that he subsequently

joined the MMS group. The annual report and the balance sheet for the
year ending 31.12.1985 also mentioned the fact that the company had
to surrender 1016.21 acres of land to the Government of Kerala.
On the death of Shri Madan Mohan Sharma in 1992 Shri
Chaturbhuj Sharma, father of the appellant Nos. 2 and 3, took over as
the Chairman and Managing Director of RBT whereas Shri B.M.
Sharma and respondent No. 1 Manish Mohan Sharma were also made
Directors of RBT. The dispute having arisen relating to the
management and control of the Company, the respondent No. 1 filed
Company Petition (CP) No. 56 of 1996 (from which the present matter
also arises) before the CLB, Principal Bench, New Delhi under
Sections 397 and 398 of the Companies Act alleging oppression and
mismanagement by the CBS Group seeking, inter alia, removal of the
CBS group from the management of the company and to put MMS
group in management and control of the same. By order dated 9.1.1997
of the CLB the then Board of Directors of RBT was dissolved and a
fresh Board was constituted with Justice A.N.Verma (retired) as the
Chairman and two Directors each from the MMS Group and CBS
group. The CLB directed the parties to make efforts for arriving at an
amicable settlement.
On 2.3.1998 the CLB passed an order that the affairs of
RBT shall be jointly managed by the CBS Group and MMS group.

M/S Ram Bahadur Thakur & Ors vs Sh. Manish M. Sharma & Ors on 16 December, 2016
Thereafter, a notice was received from the Kerala Land Ceiling
authorities by RBT on 25.4.1998 regarding surrender of excess land.
After taking advice from its lawyers, RBT sent a letter on 12.5.1998 to
the Tahsildar stating that excess land has already been surrendered and
therefore, there was no need for a fresh survey. It is the stand of the
CBS group that these communications took place when affairs of RBT
were being jointly managed by both the Groups and everyone was fully
aware of these communications.
Pursuant to the order of the CLB dated 2.3.1998 a Joint
Management Agreement (JMA) dated 1.6.1998 was entered into
between the CBS Group and MMS group under which 5 estates were to
be managed by MMS group and 4 estates were to be managed by the
CBS group which was to come into effect from 1.6.1998 and was
approved by the Board of Directors in its meeting dated 29.6.1998. As
per the JMA, MMS Group was to pay 55% of the office expenses of
RBT in Kochi whereas CBS Group was to pay the remaining 45%. The
communications, in the meantime continued between the parties for
arriving at a family arrangement so as to divide the assets and liabilities
of the two Groups and the company in order to end the dispute between
them. On 28.4.1999 a draft Memorandum of Family Arrangement
(MOFA) along with a transfer deed (TD) was prepared under which as
per the TD, RBT was to sell 5 estates to MMS group on their paying

M/S Ram Bahadur Thakur & Ors vs Sh. Manish M. Sharma & Ors on 16 December, 2016
Rs. 7.23 crores towards their share of the liabilities of RBT subject to
certain conditions mentioned in the TD. By order dated 19.8.1999 the
CLB passed a consent order on the basis of the said MOFA and TD
after making the following observations in para 4, relevant part of para-
5 and paras 7 and 8 which are quoted below:
"4. During the course of 1998, discussions were
held between the parties with Shri Justice Varma
playing a crucial role and with the benefit of his
advice and guidance both sides were soon able to
reach a verbal family settlement agreement to settle
their overall disputes and their verbal family
settlement agreement has now been reduced in
writing, for the purposes of record, in the form of a
Memorandum of Family Arrangement which is
annexed hereto as Appendix „A(cid:129). The differences
between the two sides on the details of the terms of
settlement in respect of the Respondent No. 1
Company however continued to be a hurdle that
proved difficult to overcome. Despite the best
efforts of Shri Justice Varma, over a period of some
12 months, agreement between the two sides in
respect of the respondent No. 1 Company could not
be reached and it was noted in the minutes of the
meeting of the Interim Board of Directors, held on
12.4.99
, that fundamental differences still existed between the two groups.
5. The matter was heard by us over various sittings Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010
dt.16-12-2016 in the past five months (19.4.99 to 21.4.99, 28.4.99, 6,5,99, 24.5.99, 2.6.99, 21.6.99,
28.7.99 and 9.8.99). From the very outset we have been of the opinion that not only would an
amicable settlement be in the interests of both groups, who are after all family members closely
related to each other, but it would also be in the best interests of the company, it(cid:129)s workers,
business associates and creditors as well as other Companies where they are common shareholders.
We do not at this time propose to adjudicate on the merits of any allegations made during the course
of the proceedings. In the course of the above mentioned hearings we asked both sides to explain to
us the reasons why an amicable settlement could not be reached and what were the areas of
differences. After hearing counsel for both sides we also gave one Director representing each group
the opportunity to explain the issues to us. After hearing them, we found that a settlement could be
reached since, in our view, the differences though substantial were not insurmountable. We
expressed our firm opinion that the only way which the disputes could be put an end to was the
division of assets and liabilities of the company between the two groups. It is our opinion, in order to
achieve a fair and equitable settlement, five tea estates together with certain other assets should vest
in the petitioner group. Accordingly, we directed the parties to identify the tea estates to be given to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/168473195/ 6
M/S Ram Bahadur Thakur & Ors vs Sh. Manish M. Sharma & Ors on 16 December, 2016
the petitioners(cid:129) group and also details of sharing of the Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of
2010 dt.16-12-2016 assets and liabilities of the company. We also directed to put in writing
necessary terms and conditions of the division of the properties of the company as suggested by us.
Accordingly, they have identified the tea estates and other assets to be given to the petitioners(cid:129)
group and have also quantified the share of the liabilities of the company to be paid by the
petitioners(cid:129) group which comes to Rs. 7,24,67,708.90 (Rupees seven crores twenty four lacs sixty
seven thousand seven hundred and eight and paise ninety only). The detailed terms on which this
settlement is to be elected is more fully set out in the form of a "Transfer Document Relating to the
assets of Ram Bahadur Thakur Ltd." which is attached hereto and marked as Appendix "B" and
forms an integral part of this Order. ..... .
7. We accordingly direct, pursuant to the powers vested in us under Section 402 of the Companies
Act, 1956 that;
(a) both parties fill up and complete Schedules 1,4,7,8,11 and 12 in the Transfer Document Relating
to the Assets of Ram Bahadur Thakur Ltd. (which are currently blank/incomplete), by mutual
agreement and following the completion of the said Schedules the parties shall forthwith execute the
Transfer Document Relating to the Assets of Ram Bahadur Thakur Ltd. ;
(b) both parties fill up and complete Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016
Schedules 1,4 (part B), 5,6,7,8 and 9 in the Memorandum of Family Arrangement (which are
currently blank/incomplete), by mutual agreement and following the completion of the said
Schedules the parties shall forthwith execute the Memorandum of Family Arrangement. And both
parties shall take all necessary steps to implement the settlement contemplated under the said
document which must be completed by 30th September, 1999.
The Memorandum of Family Arrangement and the Transfer Document Relating to the Assets of
Ram Bahadur Thakur Ltd. set out the entire agreement the parties and there are no understandings
and/or arrangements other than expressly stated in these documents.
(8) Time shall be of the essence in effecting the settlement if either party fails to perform it(cid:129)s
obligations undertaken pursuant to the Memorandum of Family Arrangement or the Transfer
Document Relating to the Assets of Ram Bahadur Thakur Ltd., within the time specified therein, the
aggrieved party shall be at liberty to approach us for appropriate orders/directions and for
expediting the final disposal of the Petition and the various interim Applications. After the
completion of all the transactions both sides shall appear before us for the final disposal of the
Petition and the various Interim Applications. In the Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of
2010 dt.16-12-2016 event of any further difficulties in the implementation of this Order the parties
shall be at liberty to apply to us for implementation of this Order."
The origin of the present dispute arises from the form in which the division of Assets and Liabilities
were made. Para 3.6 of the MOFA stated that it will take into its fold and include the Transfer
Document Relating to the Assets of RBT executed as per the directions of the CLB annexed therein
and marked as Schedule 5 which is in implementation of it and forms an integral part of the MOFA.

M/S Ram Bahadur Thakur & Ors vs Sh. Manish M. Sharma & Ors on 16 December, 2016
The Transfer Document, on the other hand, was in the form of a Sale Deed in which the appellant
No. 1 was the vendor the purchasers being the Travancore Tea Estates Pvt. Ltd. (not to be confused
with TTE) and Madan Mohan Sharma and Sons Pvt. Ltd., both the companies belonging to the MMS
Group, and it was provided in the TD that the vendor as beneficial owner shall convey to the
Purchasers and the purchasers shall purchase the Assets with effect from the date of completion 5 of
the Tea Estates fully under the management of the MMS group in the assets to be transferred by the
RBT to the Purchaser Company. During the interregnum the affairs of the company were to be
managed by the two groups as per the Joint Management Agreement. The dispute in the present
matter arises from the description of the 5 sale estates which were contained in Schedule 9 of Patna
High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 the TD and the share in the Tea Estates
which were managed by the MMS group but the area indicated in Schedule-9 was the same as in the
sale deed of 1976 of TTE to RBT, without excluding therefrom the lands surrendered to the Kerala
Government under the KLR Act. Schedule 10 of the TD contained warrantees which provided that
the facts set out in the document, recitals and schedules to the agreement were true and accurate in
all respect and each of the representatives undertook that the documents provided to the purchaser
shall be complete, genuine, fully valid and fully effective in achieving its purpose and further that the
assets were free from all liens, charges and encumbrances save as expressly disclosed to the other
party. Clause 13.6 of the TD provided that if at any time any term or provision in the document shall
be held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable in whole or part under any rule of law or enactment
such term or provision or part shall to that extent be deemed not to form part of that document but
the enforceability of the remainder of the document shall not be affected.
As contemplated by the TD, on 17.1.2000 the CBS Group issued a notice to the MMS Group that the
CBS Group has complied with their obligations under the TD. The same was contested by the MMS
Group by filing an application before the CLB on 7.2.2000. Thereafter the CBS Group filed an
application on 5.7.2000 Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 for recalling
the orders of the CLB in CP No. 56 of 1996 including the order dated 19.8.1999. On 22.12.2000 the
CLB dismissed both the applications. An appeal against the same was dismissed by this Court by
order dated 14.2.2003. The MMS Group thereafter filed SLP before the Supreme Court which was
allowed by order dated 21.3.2006 directing the CLB to execute the order dated 19.8.1999 with the
following observations as reported in (2006) 4 SCC 416 in paras 25 to 28, 31 to 33, the relevant part
of para 35 and para 38 :-
"25. The order dated 19.08.1999 was in fact a preliminary decree. Final disposal of
the matter or the final decree would be after full implementation of the terms of the
MOFA and Transfer Document.
The interim orders passed relating to joint
management were therefore directed to be
continued until such time.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/168473195/ 8
M/S Ram Bahadur Thakur & Ors vs Sh. Manish M. Sharma & Ors on 16 December, 2016
26. Significantly, the Company Law Board in the order dated 19.08.1999 had itself
recorded that if there was any difficulty in the implementation of the order "the
parties shall be at liberty to apply to us for implementation of this order". Yet when
the application was made for such implementation, the Company Law Board did not
abide by its own Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016
direction.
27. Since the Company Law Board when it deals with an application u/s. 643A sits as
an executing court it is subject to all the limitations to which a Court executing a
decree is subject. It is well settled that an executing court cannot go behind the
decree, unless the decree sought to be executed is a nullity for a lack of inherent
jurisdiction. A decree is without jurisdiction if the court passing the decree usurps a
jurisdiction which it did not have and which could not be waived by the parties. The
last two decisions have also held that the lack of jurisdiction must be patent on the
face of the decree in order to enable the executing court to come to the conclusion
that the decree is a nullity.
28. Furthermore, the order dated 19.08.1999 was a consent order. Its terms and
conditions were contained in the MOFA and the Transfer Document which expressly
formed an integral part of the order itself. A consent decree has been held to be a
contract with the imprimatur of the court superadded. It is something more than a
mere Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 contract and has
the elements of both a command and a contract. As was said by the Privy Council as
early as 1929,"The only difference in this respect between an order made by consent
and one not so made is that the first stands unless and until it is discharged by
mutual agreement or is set aside by another order of the Court; the second stands
until and unless it is discharged on an appeal.
31. The effort of the executing court must be to see that the parties are given the fruits
of the decree. The mandate is reinforced when it is a consent decree and doubly
reinforced when the consent decree is a family settlement. Clauses 3.1 and 3.6 of the
MOFA make it clear that the agreements were arrived at between the parties to
resolve finally long pending disputes between the family members relating to jointly
owned assets. The clauses read as follows:-
"For the sake of resolving the disputes of the Sharma Family and the companies
owned by them and to regain the harmony, peace, love and affection amongst the two
groups and for Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 the
welfare and prosperity of the Sharma Family and the companies owned by them; The
Memorandum of Family Arrangement will also take into its fold and include the
Transfer Document Relating to the Assets of Ram Bahadur Thakur Ltd. (RBTL),
executed as per the directions of the CLB, Annexed hereto and marked as Schedule 5.
The above mentioned Transfer Document Relating to the Assets of Ram Bahadur
Thakur Ltd. is in implementation of and forms an integral part of this Memorandum
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/168473195/ 9
M/S Ram Bahadur Thakur & Ors vs Sh. Manish M. Sharma & Ors on 16 December, 2016
of Family Arrangement."
32. It has been repeatedly emphasized in several decisions that family settlements are governed by a
special equity and are to be enforced if honestly made. This would be so "even if the terms may have
been agreed to on the basis of an error of the parties or originate in a mistake or ignorance of fact as
to what the rights of the parties actually are, or of the points on which their rights actually depend".
This is because the object of an arrangement is to protect Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of
2010 dt.16-12-2016 the family from long drawn out litigation, and to bring about harmony and
goodwill in the family.
The courts lean heavily in favour of family arrangements and, "matters which would be fatal to the
validity of similar transaction between strangers are not objections to the binding effect of family
arrangements". This view has been reiterated recently in Amteshwar Anand V/s Virendra Mohan
Singh & Ors.
33. In our opinion both the Company Law Board and the High Court erred in refusing to execute the
order dated 19.08.1999 u/s 643A of the Companies Act. They have thereby failed to exercise the
jurisdiction with which they were vested. The failure is heightened given the nature of the order
which they were bound to execute. They have erroneously proceeded upon principles applicable to
contracts alone and have ignored the fact that the agreement between the parties had culminated in
a consent order of the Company Law Board. The plea of the respondents that this Court should not
interfere in the matter under Art. 136 by reason of Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010
dt.16-12-2016 any alleged misconduct on the part of the appellants in managing the 5 estates is
unacceptable. The appellant(cid:129)s alleged lack of efficiency in running of the five tea estates is not a
material consideration for deciding whether the order dated 19.08.1999 should be enforced.
35. ........ The Company Law Board and the High Court have proceeded on the basis that the only
dispute between the parties was as to the interpretation of Cl. 4.1.1.11. Elaborate arguments have
however been addressed to us on the merits of the four contentions noted by us earlier by both the
parties. We were initially of the view that the dispute should be resolved by us finally. However, on a
reconsideration, we deem it fit to remand this issues for determination by the Company Law Board
if it is satisfied that the issues could be said to have been fairly raised by the parties before it. We
make it clear that whatever interpretation may be put by the Company Law Board on the clauses of
the MOFA and Transfer Document, the Board must implement the clauses as interpreted.
Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016
38. We note that the MOFA and Transfer Document were the outcome of the commendable and
determined efforts on the part of the Company Law Board to bring to an end disputes between the
parties in a manner which would have been in the interest of the respondent no. 1 given the impasse
between the two blocks of shareholders and saved the parties a lot of unnecessary harassment,
expenditure and acrimony. We also sought to bring an end to the dispute by proposing measures
which might be acceptable to both. However, such resolution does not appear to be possible.
Therefore it must be left to the Company Law Board to execute its order dated 19.08.1999 in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/168473195/ 10
M/S Ram Bahadur Thakur & Ors vs Sh. Manish M. Sharma & Ors on 16 December, 2016
accordance with the settled principles of law and in terms of the opinion expressed by us in this
judgment. The impugned decisions of the Company Law Board and the High Court are for the
reasons earlier stated set aside. The appeals are allowed and the matter remanded to the Company
Law Board for completing the implementation of the order dated 19.08.1999 by executing the
same."
Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 Various disputes even thereafter
continued to be raised by the parties against each other on different issues regarding the
implementation of the MOFA and TD. Finally, on 19.3.2009 the respondents filed an interim
application being I.A. No. 136/2009 in CA No. 645/2008 alleging that on the facts and documents
coming to the knowledge recently that the RBT as per its own submissions had agreed to surrender
lands from survey numbers located in the Sale Estates i.e., the estates to be transferred to the
petitioners alone covering an extent of 1366.72 acres but withheld material facts not only from the
petitioners but also from the CLB and are guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation which action is not
only in breach of the warranties from the time the MOFA and TD were signed, but are also in breach
of Clause 9.5 of the TD by failing to notify the petitioners about the inaccuracies in the warranties.
Accordingly, the provision of Clause 9.6 of the TD was sought to be invoked to rectify the breach of
the warranties so as to entitle MMS Group to receive the loss suffered due to shortfall of the area of
land a sum equivalent to 100% of all or any losses incurred by the petitioner as a result of any
misrepresentation or breach of the warranties. It was further stated therein that the similar Estates
in the area are conservatively valued at Rs. 1,20,000/- per acre.
In the course of arguments before the CLB, however, the Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of
2010 dt.16-12-2016 appellants stated that an area of 716.80 acres has already been surrendered and
further 206.12 acres is to be surrendered, i.e., total 922.92 acres shortfall is there in the Sale Estates.
The appellants herein also resisted the claim of compensation stating that they are not liable under
the terms of the TD. The CLB held that the intention of the parties is to be ascertained by the
Executing Court only from the decree and where the decree is clear, no further evidence can be
adduced to come to a conclusion that is contrary to the express provision of the decree and that is
liable to render inoperative provisions of the decree and that it was bound to execute the consent
order in terms of the direction of the Supreme Court dated 21.3.2006 and the respondents plea not
to enforce the terms of the Warranty and in particular clause 9.6.1.1 is the prayer to render the
warranty provisions of the TD inoperative and to rewrite Schedule 9 of the TD which cannot be
entertained by the Executing Court.
The CLB further did not accept the contention of the appellants regarding the involvement and
knowledge of Mr. B.M. Sharma in respect of the negotiation and purchase of the Estates from TTE
holding that in terms of Schedule 2 of the TD Mr. B.M. Sharma was never a part of the MMS group
and thus the respondents are attempting to make inference in direct opposition to the settled
decree. It further held that the sale deed of TTE Company to RBT does not Patna High Court COMP.
APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 have any qualifications/caveats with regard to KLR Act
proceedings or any surrendered area and there is no evidence to show that TTE made any disclosure
to Mr. B.M. Sharma about any possible surrender of land. Moreover, when the area to be
surrendered was determined by the Taluk Land Board (TLB) after the sale deed, it would be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/168473195/ 11
M/S Ram Bahadur Thakur & Ors vs Sh. Manish M. Sharma & Ors on 16 December, 2016
impossible for TTE to make any disclosure of details of the land surrendered. The CLB further held
that the mention in the Annual Report of 1984 of RBT regarding the reduced area cannot be treated
as evidence of universal knowledge of KLR surrender proceedings. It further held that in terms of
Clause 9.8 of the TD, which provides that it shall not be a defence to any claim under the Warranties
that the Purchaser or any member of the MMS Group ought to have known about the matter which
is the subject of the claim, any alleged knowledge on the part of the petitioners cannot provide a
defence against the claim. With regard to the severability Clause 13.6 of the TD, it was held that the
question is not if the land is beneficially owned by the Company, rather the appellants falsely
warranted and that any such warranty was clearly a fraudulent misrepresentation which was beyond
doubt. Therefore, the MMS Group was found entitled to be compensated for the loss as a result of
misrepresentation as provided in the TD. It further held that even if it was presumed that the
transfer was never valid in view of the provisions of KLR Act still the appellants were in violation of
the Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 warranties and, in any case, they
have knowingly misrepresented the facts by falsely claiming that the land was beneficially owned by
the Company and not subject to any rights to acquire and the provisions of Clause 9.6.11 have to be
enforced.
The CLB also rejected the contention of the respondents regarding division of assets/liabilities being
on 55%/45% basis between the petitioners and the appellants as an attempt to prevent enforcement
of the terms of Clause 9.6.11 stating that there was no provision of any such 55/45 division in its
order dated 19.8.1999 or in the MOFA and TD that form integral part of the same and, therefore, the
terms of the TD had to be implemented as they were.
With regard to the valuation of the land also the CLB disagreed with the stand of the appellants that
the same would be valued only at Rs. 10,000/- per acre and further held that 716.80 acres should be
valued at Rs. 1,50,353.49 per acre and remaining 206.12 acres at Rs. 2,45,961.25 per acre.
The CLB also made several remarks on the conduct of the appellants herein and ultimately by its
impugned order dated 29.11.2010 directed the appellants to pay the compensation as stated above
within 60 days.
Learned counsel for the appellants has raised several propositions in support of the appeal. It is
firstly submitted that the Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 MOFA and
TD should be read conjointly as part of the division of the assets and liabilities of the family and not
as a sale of the properties of the company. To support the said submission, it is submitted that both
the groups had almost equal share holding of the assets mentioned in the schedule to the TD and
MOFA belonging to the RBT. Further, the document is in fact a settlement of dispute among
members of the family, all of whom had a right towards the asset of the company and the MMS
Group had equal right upon the properties and assets of RBT, including the five tea estates sought to
be given to the share of MMS Group under the TD and it is not a case where the right is acquired
over the said estates by virtue of MOFA and TD. Thus irrespective of the form of the agreement
between the parties, what is contemplated is a division of assets and liabilities and not a sale in any
real sense as there is no transfer of any property or asset in favour of a 3rd party.

M/S Ram Bahadur Thakur & Ors vs Sh. Manish M. Sharma & Ors on 16 December, 2016
The next submission of learned counsel for the appellant is that inclusion of the surrendered lands
under the KLR Act in Schedule-9 of the TD is a common mistake by both the Groups and in such
circumstances the agreement itself would be rendered void and unenforceable by virtue of Section
20 of the Contract Act, in so far as it relates to the surplus land under the KLR Act. It is submitted
that Schedule-9 of the TD verbatim reproduces the survey numbers and acreage as mentioned in the
sale deed of TTE to RBT. This itself goes Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010
dt.16-12-2016 to show that it could not be a case of fraudulent misrepresentation by one of the
co-owners of the company to the other co-owners. It is submitted that the excess area of 1444 acres
were distributed among all the nine estates whereas the division of assets estatewise is to one or the
other of the groups. Hence, in the course of negotiation and settlement it did not occur to either of
the parties to remove from the five sale estates survey numbers of the properties which had been
taken over by the State as excess lands but non-deletion of those areas was a clear mistake
committed by both the sides which is a common mistake under the purview of Section 20 of the
Contract Act.
It is further contended that neither 923 acres surplus land falling within the sale estates allotted to
the MMS group nor the balance 522 acres of excess land surrendered from the share of the CBS
Group were available to be divided and thus their mere inclusion in the TD can only be a mutual
mistake of the parties as there was no contemplation in the two documents for transfer of any land
that had already vested in the State and for the said reasons the agreement to that extent would be
void ab nitio.
In support of the aforesaid proposition learned counsel for the appellants relies upon a decision of
the Supreme Court in the case of Tarsem Singh Vs. Sukhbinder Singh: (1998) 3 SCC 471 in paras
21,22 and 24 of which it has been held as follows:
Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016
21. This section provides that an agreement would be void if both the parties to the
agreement were under a mistake as to a matter of fact essential to the agreement. The
mistake has to be mutual and in order that the agreement be treated as void, both the
parties must be shown to be suffering from mistake of fact. Unilateral mistake is
outside the scope of this section.
22. The other requirement is that the mistake, apart from being mutual, should be in
respect of a matter which is essential to the agreement.
24. "Bigha" and "kanal" are different units of measurement. In the northern part of
the country, the land is measured in some States either in terms of "bighas" or in
terms of "kanals". Both convey different impressions regarding area of the land. The
finding of the lower appellate court is to the effect that the parties were not ad idem
with respect to the unit of measurement. While the defendant intended to sell it in
terms of "kanals", the plaintiff intended to purchase it in terms of "bighas".
Therefore, the Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 dispute
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/168473195/ 13
M/S Ram Bahadur Thakur & Ors vs Sh. Manish M. Sharma & Ors on 16 December, 2016
was not with regard to the unit of measurement only. Since these units relate to the
area of the land, it was really a dispute with regard to the area of the land which was
the subject-matter of agreement for sale, or, to put it differently, how much area of
the land was agreed to be sold, was in dispute between the parties and it was with
regard to the area of the land that the parties were suffering from a mutual mistake.
The area of the land was as much essential to the agreement as the price which,
incidentally, was to be calculated on the basis of the area. The contention of the
learned counsel that the "mistake" with which the parties were suffering did not
relate to a matter essential to the agreement cannot be accepted."
In this regard learned counsel also places reliance on other decisions in the case of Sheikh Brothers
Ltd. Vs. Arnold Julius Ochsner: (1957) AC 136; Bibee Solomon Vs. Abdool Azeez: ILR 1881 Bombay
68; EC Eyre Walker Vs. Henry Earnest Meaney: AIR 1947 Allahabad 332; Ananda Chandra Das Vs.
Kali Das Bepari: 51 Indian Cases 955; Nursing Dass Kothari Vs. Chuttoo Lall Misser: AIR 1923
Calcutta 641; Mt. Rani Kunwar Vs. Mahbub Baksh: AIR 1930 Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ)
No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 Allahabad 252; and the Orissa State Electricity Board Vs. M/s. Indian
Metals & Ferro Alloys Ltd. : AIR 1991 Orissa 59.
The next submission of learned counsel for the appellants is that the MMS Group had actual
knowledge of the fact that proceedings had been initiated against RBT under the KLR Act and that
lands had been declared as excess which was not available for division among the two Groups and,
therefore, the non-deletion of the revenue survey nos. with respect to such lands from the sale estate
in Schedule 9 was clearly on account of common mistake by both the Groups for which the MMS
Group cannot derive any advantage over the CBS Group. This proposition, in fact, is in many ways
the sheet anchor of the case of the appellants for which a large number of evidence already on the
record were cited before this Court and in addition strength was also sought to be derived from the
documents brought on the record by way of an interlocutory application, with the permission of the
Court, regarding the sale made by MMS Group in the year 2001.
It is firstly urged that even in the order of the TLB dated 13.11.1976 reference had been clearly made
to the ceiling return filed by the TTE and associated proceedings prior to the sale deed executed by
TTE in favour of RBT. In the order dated 15.12.1976, the TLB also reflected the acceptance of the
opinion given by TTE. Thereafter the Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016
actual surrender of land to an extent of 360.46 hectares equivalent to 1016.21 acres was effected by
one P.P. Machiah on 30.10.1984 who was subsequently re-employed by MMS Group in the course of
Board meeting of the RBT dated 29.6.1998 to assist in the operation of the estate that was handed
over to the MMS Group, which request was made by Mr. B.M. Sharma. The annual report of the
Company for the year ending on 31.12.1985 clearly shows a surrender of 1016.21 acres.
Reference is also made to the letter dated 5.10.1994 written by Mr. B.M.Sharma of MMS Group to
Mr. S.M. Sharma of CBS Group in which he categorically stated that he had analysed the accounts of
the Company since 1977 to 1993 including Schedules G and H which were part of the balance sheets,
which clearly shows that the factum of surrender of 1016 acres of land mentioned in the annual
report dated 31.12.1985 could not have been missed by him.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/168473195/ 14
M/S Ram Bahadur Thakur & Ors vs Sh. Manish M. Sharma & Ors on 16 December, 2016
Reference is also made to the agreement dated 13.8.2001 between respondent Manish Mohan
Sharma and one Panchami Vasudevan in which a portion of the Sale Estates was agreed to be sold
and in one of the boundaries of the said land, the land surrendered to the Government was shown as
land surrendered to the Government, which shows that a palpably false case was made by MMS
Group before the CLB that they had no knowledge about surrender till the year 2009. This is the
document which was permitted Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 to be
filed by this Court in view of its relevance by order dated 28.9.2012.
The active role of Mr. B.M. Sharma in the negotiation and at every other stage including drafting of
TD and MOFA have also been relied upon by the appellants to show that he had a major role to play
in negotiating the clauses of the sale deed of TTE to RBT. In support of the same learned counsel
relies upon an affidavit dated 5.1.1997 of James Nigel Arden, Eighth Lord Norton, who was Director
of TTE when the sale took place, in which he had stated that major role was played by Mr. B.M.
Sharma in negotiating the clauses of Sale Deed between TTE and RBT which was held mostly in
London between the Directors of TTE including himself and Mr. M.M.Sharma and Mr. B.M. Sharma
of the RBT. It is clearly stated therein that the major part of the clause details of the contract was
negotiated between B.M. Sharma and himself over a period that initially was thought would be
weeks but in fact turned into months.
It is further urged that Shri Madan Mohan Sharma, father of Shri B.M. Sharma and grand father of
Manish Mohan Sharma, was actually in effective control of the affairs of the company till November,
1991 which is admitted by the respondents. It is further asserted that active involvement of Mr. B.M.
Sharma on behalf of the MMS Group and moreover in the negotiations leading up to the final Patna
High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 MOFA and TD showed that it was he who
was active on behalf of the MMS Group. It is further alleged that it is Mr. B.M. Sharma who had
handed over the draft TD & MOFA to Shri S.M. Sharma on 28.4.1999 in which Schedule 9 had been
duly filled up with all the survey numbers, including the survey numbers that had vested in the State
as excess lands.
It is contended by learned counsel that under the Joint Management Agreement (JMA) the 5 estates
which ultimately became the Sale Estates came to be exclusively managed by the MMS Group with
effect from 1.6.1998, during the course of which a report was also prepared in consultation with Mr.
Manish Mohan Sharma by the Tea Board showing the details of the actual extent of the lands
comprised within the Sale Estates.
Reliance has also been made on the payment of basic land tax for the five estates of the MMS Group,
which is payable on the actual land available with the assessee, on 12.1.1999 before the MOFA and
TD were finalized.
Reference is also made to the attachment made by the Provident Fund Department with regard to
the 9 estates from time to time indicating the correct area of the land in question.
It is also the submission of learned counsel for the appellants that if the MOFA and TD are
construed as providing for Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 transfer
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/168473195/ 15
M/S Ram Bahadur Thakur & Ors vs Sh. Manish M. Sharma & Ors on 16 December, 2016
of land which is already vested in the Government by the provisions of KLR Act, it would involve
transferring the lands vested in the State making the agreement unlawful under Section 23 of the
Contract Act which agreement would be void and unenforceable. It is stated that under Sections 84
and 86 of the KLR Act read with Sections 5 and 7 of the Kerala Land Conservancy Act, it is an
offence and infraction of law to possess Government land. It is thus argued that if the TD is read as
involving transfer of Government land and the transferee to be put in possession thereof, the object
of the said agreement would become unlawful and the agreement would become void under Section
23 of the Contract Act. In this regard learned counsel cites the decision of the Supreme Court in the
case of Mannalal Khetan & Ors. Vs. Kedar Nath Khetan & Ors.: (1977) 2 SCC 424.
It is contended by learned counsel for the appellants that in the case between the parties which is
reported in (2006) 4 SCC 416 it was held by the Apex Court that the order dated 19.8.1999 of the
CLB which has adopted the MOFA and TD, is treated as akin to consent decree and under Section
634 A of the Companies Act, the CLB functions as an executing Court having powers to enforce its
own decrees. It was held by the Apex Court that if the CLB found that the decree or any of its terms
called for interpretation, it was within its jurisdiction to interpret that particular term and to execute
the decree on Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 the basis of such
interpretation and if the decree was ambiguous, it was the duty of the executing court to construe
the decree. It is thus, submitted that when the clause of the agreement providing for transfer of land
along with the warranty clause with regard to non-fulfillment of the said clause relating to transfer is
called in question, then the contention regarding the validity and enforceability of the clause is a
matter which was required to be adjudicated by the executing Court, namely, the CLB in the present
matter. Reliance in this regard is placed upon the decisions of the Supreme Court and various High
Courts in the cases of Lakshmanaswami Naidu Vs. Rangamma: ILR 26 Madras 31; Raja of
Vizianagaram Vs. Dantivada Chelliah: ILR 26 Madras 84; Katwari Vs. Sita Ram Tewari: AIR 1921
Allahabad 118; Uchi Lal Misser Vs. Raghunandan Tewari: AIR 1934 Patna 666 (Full Bench); Jai
Narain Ram Lundia Vs. Kedar Nath Khetan: AIR 1956 Supreme Court 359; Mohan Ram Vs. T.L.
Sundararamier: AIR 1960 Madras 377 (Full Bench); Bhavan Vaja & Ors. Vs. Solanki Hanuji Khodaji
Mansang: AIR 1972 Supreme Court 1371; Vidya Sagar Vs. Sudesh Kumari: (1976) 1 SCC 115;
Chandan Mall Vs. Abdul Gani: AIR 1976 Gauhati 54; and Dhurandhar Prasad Singh Vs. Jai Prakash
University & Ors: (2001) 6 SCC 534.
Reliance is also placed upon Clause 13.6 of the TD by learned counsel for the appellants to submit
that the function of the Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 CLB in the
present matter is not merely that of an execution Court per se. It also partakes the characteristic of a
Court of the first instance, so far as it relates to the adjudication of the disputes between the parties
emanating and arising from implementation of the agreement and relatable to resolution of disputes
arising under the agreement, since the said clause provides for severability of any term or provision
which may be held to be illegal and unenforceable in whole or part so as to not affect the
enforceability of the remainder of the document. It is submitted that in view of the declaration by
the Supreme Court the CLB is the proper forum to adjudicate upon such matters.
Carrying the argument on the basis of Clause 13.6 of the TD further, learned counsel submits that
the validity of the provision regarding the transfer of land already vested in the State Government
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/168473195/ 16
M/S Ram Bahadur Thakur & Ors vs Sh. Manish M. Sharma & Ors on 16 December, 2016
will not render the entire agreement null and void but only that part, since it is not the case of either
of the parties that the entire agreement is vitiated for any valid reason.
It is urged by learned counsel for the appellants that the respondents had knowledge about the
actual state of affairs with regard to the lands vested under the KLR Act and, therefore, the warranty
clause in the agreement relating to division of the estates of the company, even assuming the same
to be transfer of assets of the company, cannot be invoked by them to claim any injury. It is Patna
High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 submitted that the defects known to the
purchasers cannot form the basis of a claim for compensation, whatever be the nature of warranty
pleaded in that regard. In support of the same, learned counsel relies upon a decision of the
Supreme Court of Minnesota (USA) in Mccormick & Ors. Vs. Kelly, in which it has been held as
follows:-
"It has always been held that a general warranty should not be considered as applying
to or giving a cause of action for defects known to the parties at the time of making
the warranty, and both the weight of authorities and reason authorize this
proposition, viz; that for representations in the terms or form of a warranty of
personal property no action will lie on account of defects actually known and
understood by the purchaser at the time of the bargain.
In the nature of things one cannot rely upon the truth of that which he knows to be
untrue, and to a purchaser fully knowing the fact in respect of the property,
misrepresentation cannot have been an inducement or consideration to the making
of the purchase, and hence could have been no part of the contract."
Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 It is also the contention of learned
counsel for the appellants that the warranty clause contained in Schedule-X of the TD is not a
standalone clause but will have to be treated part of the clause relating to transfer of the land and
where the agreement in so far as it relates to transfer of excess land is invalid and unenforceable or
null and void either by virtue of Section 23 of the Contract Act or by reason of Section 20 thereof
then the warranty clause alone cannot survive such invalidity. It is urged that the warranty clause is
akin to clause of forfeiture or penalty and will sink with the agreement if the latter is found to be
unenforceable and invalid, for which reliance is placed on the decision of the Supreme Court in
Tarsem Singh(cid:129)s case (supra).
It is further submitted by learned counsel that where an agreement is found to be invalid even the
execution Court will have the equitable jurisdiction to relieve the parties of forfeiture or penal
clauses. In support of the same learned counsel relies upon a decision of a learned single Judge of
Mysore High Court in the case of Abdul Ghanisab Vs. Alampalli Nanjunda Shetty: AIR 1962 Mysore
9, in para- 6 of which it has been held as follows:
" I am not disposed to agree with the view taken by the lower appellate Court in this
case. The principle applicable to cases like the present one is that if a creditor agrees
to reduce the amount of his claim on Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/168473195/ 17
M/S Ram Bahadur Thakur & Ors vs Sh. Manish M. Sharma & Ors on 16 December, 2016
dt.16-12-2016 certain conditions but the agreement provides that, on the failure of
the debtor to fulfill any of those conditions, the original claim shall revive, it is clear
that the revival of the original claim is not in the nature of a penalty. But, if, on the
contrary, a debtor agrees to pay a sum of money over and above his original liability,
he is entitled to be relieved against what undoubtedly has to be regarded as a penalty.
The same principle applies to a consent decree made by a Court."
Reliance is also placed upon a Division Bench judgment of the Calcutta High Court in the case of
Bishwanath Kundu Vs. Subala Dassi: AIR 1962 Calcutta 272, in the relevant part of para-11 and para
12 of which it has been held as follows:
"11. On the main question, however, namely, that the stipulation for payment of
double the amount in case of default for three consecutive months was a stipulation
by way of penalty and that, although the same forms part of a decree of Court, as the
said term was really incorporated under a compromise, it cannot be regarded except
as part of a compromise decree, so as to be subject to relief even in the Patna High
Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 executing court, Mr. Sen(cid:129)s client
ought to succeed. The appellant, therefore, would be entitled to relief in respect of the
same as part of a contract, providing for penalty, even though the said contract has
been incorporated in a decree of Court. This indeed, is clear from the series of
decisions, starting from Surendra Nath V. Secretary of State, 24 Cal WN 545........
12. In the present case, the term of double payment was, undoubtedly, a term of
penalty. The appellant, therefore, would be entitled to relief under Section 74 of the
Indian Contract Act. The respondent, however, even under that section, would be
entitled to reasonable compensation even in the absence of proof of special damage."
Support is also sought in this regard from the two decisions, namely, Deepchand Mini Vs.
Ticamchand Mini: AIR 1974 Calcutta 222 and Shyam Sundar Padhi Vs. Indramoni Das: AIR 1951
Orissa 46 which lay down the similar propositions.
Lastly, it is submitted by learned counsel for the appellants that even assuming without admitting
that the warranty clause is enforceable in spite of the invalidity affecting the TD with Patna High
Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 regard to excess lands already vested in the
State, the compensation that MMS Group is entitled to cannot be 100% of the market value of the
lands as if what was contemplated in the agreement was a transfer by the owner of the property to a
person who had no pre-existing right over the same, whereas in the present matter the MOFA and
TD provided for division of assets, and compensation, if any, should be determined on the basis that
RBT can divide amongst its shareholders only such of the assets that were available to it, on the date
of the MOFA and TD.
The stand of learned counsel for the respondents, on the other hand is that several new points have
been raised by the appellants in the appeal which has not been urged before the CLB. It is submitted
that no submissions had been made earlier relying upon Section 20 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/168473195/ 18
M/S Ram Bahadur Thakur & Ors vs Sh. Manish M. Sharma & Ors on 16 December, 2016
Further, it is alleged that no submission had been made over warranty clause and penal clause and
the execution court to relieve a party from said penal clauses and no such plea has been taken even
in the memo of appeal.
It is urged that it is settled law that an executing Court cannot go behind the decree. Reliance is also
made to the circumstances leading up to the passing of the consent decree dated 19.8.1999 by the
CLB to show that, contrary to the appellants assertions, the TD forms integral part of the consent
decree and was Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 arrived at after 14
months intensive negotiations between the parties assisted by their counsels and with the active
involvement of the CLB which had clearly applied its mind while passing the consent decree and
thus the comprehensive special warranties clause contained in the TD which did not exist in the
initial draft forms, came to be the basis of the agreement between the parties. In the said
circumstances, it is alleged that the appellants cannot be permitted now to escape their obligations
by rewriting or rendering nugatory large parts of the warranties and Schedules of the TD.
It is submitted that the argument of the appellants based on the provisions of the KLR Act is clearly
misconceived as the direction issued by the CLB does not contravene the provisions of the KLR Act
since there is no direction to transfer the land which has vested in the State, rather compensation
has been allowed to the respondents upon failure of the appellants to adhere to the representations
made by them in the TD. In fact, it is asserted by learned counsel that till the date of transfer by TTE
to RBT on 17.9.1976 there was no determination of surplus lands under the KLR Act by the TLB
which was made on 13.11.1976 and thereafter on 15.12.1976 the option was given to the company
with respect to the land to be surrendered and thus, it is submitted that no such relief was sought by
the respondents seeking to enforce transfer of land by Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of
2010 dt.16-12-2016 appellants which had been surrendered or required to be surrendered under the
provisions of the KLR Act rather only the compensation for loss suffered due to misrepresentation
with regard to the surrender of the land comprised in the 5 Tea Estates having been made as
mentioned in Schedule-9 of the TD. It is submitted that consideration for the respondents in signing
the transfer document were the warranties given by the vendor relating to the subject-matter of the
TD and thus the failure of the appellants to transfer the entire land mentioned in Schedule-9 of the
TD has rightly been held by the CLB as entitling the respondents to compensation for such loss.
It is submitted that what was before the CLB was not the contract but a consent decree and to such a
decree there can be no applicability of the provisions of Section 20 of the Indian Contract Act.
Moreover, it is submitted that Section 20 applies only in a case where both the parties are under a
mistake as to a matter of fact essential to the agreement whereas the contention of the appellants is
that both the parties were fully aware of the surrender of the land to the State Government and there
would consequently be no mistake in the minds of both the parties as to the facts of the case. Thus,
while Section 20 assumes ignorance, the appellants are pleading knowledge with respect to
surrender of lands under the KLR Act. It is submitted by learned counsel for the respondents that
the same is clearly Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 misconceived.
It is urged that Mr. B.M. Sharma who was resident of U.K. was involved in the initial negotiation
which took place in London whereas the conveyance deed was signed by C.B.Sharma on behalf of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/168473195/ 19
M/S Ram Bahadur Thakur & Ors vs Sh. Manish M. Sharma & Ors on 16 December, 2016
the RBT and there is no reference to the KLR proceedings in the Sale Deed dated 17.9.1976.
Moreover, Mr. B.M. Sharma was never a shareholder of RBT and only became Director in 1992 after
15 years of the conveyance. He is also not part of MMS Group as defined in the TD and has been
separately defined therein. Therefore, any alleged knowledge of B.M. Sharma is wholly irrelevant.
It is argued that the appellants are, in any event, barred from taking such pleas in view of the terms
of Transfer Document as per Clauses 9.8, 13.3 and 13.5 and even the consent order dated 19.8.1999
records that there is no understanding and/or arrangements other than those expressly stated in the
TD.
With regard to the knowledge of Mr. M.M.Sharma, it is submitted that since he had passed away in
1992 and is not part of the MMS Group, his knowledge cannot be attributed to the MMS Group.
With regard to Shri Manish Mohan Sharma it is stated that in January, 1992 he was only 20 years
old and soon thereafter from the year 1992- 94 the disputes started. It is stated that even from the
order dated 2.3.1998 passed by the CLB, it is evident that the respondents were not Patna High
Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 involved in day to day management.
With regard to Joint Management Agreement, it is stated that it only dealt with the administration
and work allocation between the two groups in compliance with the CLB order dated 2.3.1998 and
the decision regarding transfer of assets of RBT to the respondents was not even started when JMA
was put into effect from 1.6.1998 and even the TD provides that the records are to be given to MMS
Group which is evident from Clause 2.1.26 read with Clause 7.3.11.
The respondents have also sought to brush aside the agreement for sale dated 13.8.2001 by Shri
Manish Mohan Sharma, in which reference was made to waste land surrendered to the Government
forming the boundary, which according to them cannot lead to inference that 922 acres of land
surrendered from the respondents(cid:129) side was not available to be transferred to the respondents nor
is the report of the Tea Board of any consequence as no action was taken pursuant to the same by
the Government and the respondents have never accepted the report.
With regard to the letter of Mr. B.M. Sharma regarding perusal of the balance sheet from 1977 to
1996, it is stated that the same had been done by his London office and cannot lead to inference of
his having also looked at the statement relating to land surrendered Patna High Court COMP.
APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 in the annual report of 1985.
The respondents have also sought to draw the attention of the Court to a large number of documents
from the year 1990-91 to June, 1999, immediately preceding the date of signing of the transfer
documents including the annual report of RBT in the year 1991, the valuation report of the
company(cid:129)s estates of the year 1994-95, due diligence review report of the company carried out by
KPMG, copy of various mortgage documents, the letters exchanged between the parties to show that
the entire extent of land was available with RBT as per the said documents and no explanation has
been given by the appellants as to how the aforesaid document reflect the entire acreage. It is thus
submitted that even factually the respondents had no knowledge about the KLR proceedings. It is
further submitted that the agreement does not require the appellants to do an act which is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/168473195/ 20
M/S Ram Bahadur Thakur & Ors vs Sh. Manish M. Sharma & Ors on 16 December, 2016
impossible rather Clause 9 dealing with warranties clearly stipulated that in the event of any
misrepresentation or non-fulfillment of any of the representations contained in or any breach of any
of the warranties then the CBS Group and the vendor shall be liable to pay to the purchasers or the
MMS Group, as the case may be, a sum equal to 100% of all and any losses, damages or expenses
suffered by the purchasers or any member of the MMS Group.
The respondents have also controverted the stand of the Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of
2010 dt.16-12-2016 appellants with regard to the division of assets in the ratio of 55:45 submitting
that there is no such reference in the TD which only refers to the estates which has to be transferred
to the respondents and not to those which are to be retained by the company.
It is also submitted that factually also the lands which had been surrendered or have to be
surrendered from the respondents(cid:129) estate is 922 acres whereas from the appellants estate it is only
522 acres and if the said area is reduced from the respective total lands, the balance with MMS
Group comes to 4169.36 acres as opposed to 3651.59 acres with the CBS Group, the ratio thus
becomes 53.33% vis- a-vis 46.6% and therefore it is not correct for the appellants to say that the
ratio would be maintained.
With regard to the warranties, it is submitted that they are special warranties in view of the
background history of the disputes and litigations between the parties and in fact, consideration for
the respondents in signing the MOFA and TD. It is submitted that the judgments relied upon by the
respondents to submit that executing Court has power to rely upon the penal clauses are not tenable
and seek to rely upon decisions of the Apex Court in the case of Deepa Bhargava and another Vs.
Mahesh Bhargav and others: (2009) 2 SCC 294, in para 11 of which it has been held as follows:
"11. Even assuming that the term stipulating Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3
of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 payment of interest in the event the entire amount was not
paid within a period of 6 months is penal in nature, the executing court was bound by
the terms of the decree......."
The respondents also rely upon a decision of the Apex Court in the case of Haryana Vidyut Prasaran
Nigam Limited and another Vs. Gulshan Lal and Ors.: 2009(13) SCC 354, in para-22 of which it is
observed as follows:
"22. We are not oblivious of the fact that the respondents legally would not have been
entitled to the reliefs prayed for by them. However, as a decree has been passed, we
do not intend to go behind the same. The Executing Court shall, it goes without
saying, execute the decree strictly in terms thereof."
It is also submitted by learned counsel that the decision of the Supreme Court of Minnesota in
Mccormick & Ors. Vs. Kelly case (supra) is also not applicable as that was not a case relating to
execution proceedings of a decree which had attained finality but one where a contract was being
sought to be enforced.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/168473195/ 21
M/S Ram Bahadur Thakur & Ors vs Sh. Manish M. Sharma & Ors on 16 December, 2016
Moreover, it is submitted that it is not a case of general warranties but special warranties which
were given in the wake of Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 serious
disputes and differences between the parties resolved by lengthy, detailed and difficult negotiations
which ultimately culminated in the form of MOFA and TD.
Reference is also made by learned counsel on various paragraphs of the Supreme Court judgment in
the inter party decision reported in (2006) 4 SCC 416 wherein it was held that the order dated
19.8.1999 was not an interim order, the issues resolved cannot be reopened or re-argued and further
that the CLB while dealing with an application under Section 634-A sits as an Executing Court and
subject to all the limitations to which a Court executing a decree is subject and cannot go behind the
decree unless the decree is a nullity for a lack of inherent jurisdiction which would happen if the
Court passing the decree usurps a jurisdiction which it did not have and which could not be waived
by the parties.
Reference is also made to the observations in the said judgment that family settlement is governed
by special equity and is to be enforced if honestly made and this would be so even if the terms may
have been agreed to on the basis of an error of the parties or originate in a mistake or ignorance of
fact as to what the rights of the parties actually are. It was further observed therein that the CLB and
the High Court had erroneously proceeded on principles applicable to contracts alone and have
ignored the fact that the agreement between Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010
dt.16-12-2016 the parties had culminated in a consent order of the CLB.
It is further submitted that reliance upon decisions of this Court and other High Courts with regard
to the proposition that Executing Court can decline to execute a decree if it is contrary to law is of no
avail since the order passed by the CLB is on account of failure or non-fulfillment of obligations on
the part of the appellants in view of Clause 9 of the TD.
It is also submitted that acceptance of the plea of knowledge of surrender would amount to rewriting
the terms of the consent decree with regard to the definition of sale estates and Schedules 9 and 10
of the MOFA and Clauses 9.8 and 13.5 of the TD.
It is submitted that a consent decree of Court can only be modified by consent of parties and
judgment by consent is an as effective estoppel between the parties as a judgment where court
exercises its mind on a contested case. The decree on the basis of compromise is something more
than a contract. Reliance for the said proposition is made to the decisions in the cases of Govind
Waman Vs. Murlidhar Shrinivas & Ors.: AIR1953 Bombay 412; C.F.Angadi Vs. Y.S. Hirannayya:
(1972) 1 SCC 191; Sailendra Narayan Bhanja Deo Vs. State of Orissa: AIR 1956 SC 346; Katikara
Chintamani Dora Vs. Guntreddj Annamanaj 4: (1974) 1 SCC 567; and the inter party decision of the
Apex Court of the year 2006.
Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 It is also submitted by learned
counsel that in an appeal under Section 10F of the Companies Act the jurisdiction is limited to
question of law alone and not a pure question of fact and the plea of alleged knowledge of the MMS
Group with respect to KLR proceedings is a pure question of fact and in the absence of any
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/168473195/ 22
M/S Ram Bahadur Thakur & Ors vs Sh. Manish M. Sharma & Ors on 16 December, 2016
perversity in the finding recorded by CLB, the same cannot be gone into in an appeal under Section
10F. Reference is also made in this regard to the decision of the Karnataka High Court in the case of
Reserve Bank of India Vs. Kirloskar Investments and Finance Ltd.:
(2001) 107 Comp. Cases 63.
I have considered the submissions of learned counsels for the parties and perused the voluminous
records placed before this Court. At the outset it would be appropriate to deal with the submission of
learned counsel for the respondents that the present appeal being under Section 10F of the
Companies Act, is maintainable only on the question of law and, therefore, the finding of fact
rendered by the CLB with regard to the MMS Group having no knowledge of surrender of excess
land prior to 1998-99 cannot be agitated before this Court and in the absence of any plea or any
allegation of perversity in the finding recorded by the CLB. The proposition that an appeal under
Section 10F is only on a question of law can hardly be challenged by any one. But to state that the
findings regarding MMS Group having no knowledge Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of
2010 dt.16-12-2016 of the surrender of excess land prior to 1998-99 being a finding of fact and not
open to re-agitation before this Court because of the absence of plea of perversity, does not appear
to be made out on a broad consideration of the grounds taken in the memo of appeal. The principal
thrust of the memo of appeal is assailment of the said finding of fact with regard to the lack of
awareness of the MMS Group regarding the surrender or required to be surrendered surplus land
which has been sought to be done not only by challenging the finding regarding misrepresentation
by the appellants but also with regard to the finding that Mr. B.M. Sharma has never been part of
MMS Group. The findings have been assailed in an appeal which relates only to question of law. It is
evident that such proposition can be supported only on the ground of perversity and not otherwise.
Thus, it cannot be said that the appellants are excluded from assailing the said findings. Right from
the stage before the CLB in the written statement as also before this Court the submission of the
appellants has been that the MMS Group had actual knowledge of surrender of land much before
1998-99 and that Mr. B.M. Sharma was at all stages involved right from the inception when the sale
of the Tea Estates was negotiated with TTE. In the said background the contention of learned
counsel for the respondents that it is not open to the appellants to urge the said ground tantamounts
to saying that the appellants have no right to argue their Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of
2010 dt.16-12-2016 appeal under Section 10F of the Companies Act. The said objection of learned
counsel for the respondents is, accordingly, rejected.
At the outset it would be important to remember what the Supreme Court had stated by its order
dated 21.3.2006 in the case between the present parties. First of all, it was held that the order dated
19.8.1999 of the CLB was in fact a preliminary decree and the final disposal of the matter or the final
decree would be after full implementation of the terms of the MOFA & TD. It was also pointed out
that the CLB itself had recorded that if there was any difficulty in the implementation of the order,
the parties shall be at liberty to apply to it for implementation of the said order dated 19.8.1999 and
it was further made clear that the CLB, while dealing with an application under Section 634A, sits as
an executing Court and subject to all the limitations of such a Court. It was also observed that if the
Board found that the decree or any of its terms called for interpretation, it was within its jurisdiction
to interpret that particular term and to execute the decree on the basis of such interpretation; and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/168473195/ 23
M/S Ram Bahadur Thakur & Ors vs Sh. Manish M. Sharma & Ors on 16 December, 2016
further that if a decree is ambiguous, it is the duty of the executing court to construe the decree and
the decree must be executed as interpreted.
The Supreme Court also pointed out that Clauses 3.1 and 3.6 of the MOFA make it clear that the
agreements were arrived at between the parties to resolve finally long pending disputes between
Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 the family members relating to
jointly owned assets. It also emphasized that family settlements are governed by a special equity and
must be enforced if honestly made and that even if the terms may have been agreed to on the basis
of an error of the parties or originate in a mistake or ignorance of fact as to what the rights of the
parties actually are, or of the points on which their rights actually depend, since the object of an
arrangement is to protect the family from long drawn out litigation and matters which would be
fatal to the validity of similar transactions between strangers may not be objections to the binding
effect of family arrangements. It had also taken note of the fact that the MOFA and TD were the
outcome of the commendable and determined efforts on the part of the Company Law Board to
bring to an end disputes between the parties in a manner which would have been in the interest of
the two blocks of shareholders and saved the parties of a lot of unnecessary harassment, expenditure
and acrimony. It was with the said observations that the matter was remanded to the CLB for
implementing the order dated 19.8.1999 by executing the same. Thus, the order dated 19.8.1999 is
to be considered as a contract with the imprimatur of the Court superadded and the MOFA & TD
from an integral part of the order itself.
In the said circumstances, when the IA No. 136 of 2009 was filed in the said matter, the CLB ought
to have kept in mind the Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 fact that it
was not merely an agreement between the parties rather by protracted negotiations for quite some
time, in which process the CLB itself played an active role by suggesting that the five estates which
had been given under the Joint Management Agreement dated 1.6.1998 to the MMS Group may be
handed over to them as part of the family arrangement and the no less important role played by the
Board Chairman Justice A.N.Verma appointed by the CLB in the matter for bringing the parties
together.
In the said backdrop when the matter was first of all raised before the CLB ten years after the
consent decree dated 19.8.1999 passed by it, it ought to have examined the matter keeping in view
all the aforesaid factual positions and not decided the same on mere technicality. The Company
itself had taken over the Tea estates of TTE as long back as in the year 1976. It is evident from the
materials on the record that Mr. B.M. Sharma being resident of London at the relevant time had
played not only an initial role but the most important role along with his father Mr. Madan Mohan
Sharma in the course of negotiations to bring about the sale of TTE as is evident from the affidavit
filed by one of the then Directors of TTE which is on the record. Even otherwise, it would be in the
normal course of things to presume that a person in London would have played a substantial role in
the matter of such a sale, particularly keeping in view the fact the Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ)
No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 conditions prevailing in 1975-76 when there were a lot of controls and
permissions to be obtained from the Government as is evident even from the affidavit of the said
Director of TTE that the negotiations were protracted much beyond the time in contemplation of the
parties. Once this basic fact is accepted then it has to be presumed that the question of ceiling
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/168473195/ 24
M/S Ram Bahadur Thakur & Ors vs Sh. Manish M. Sharma & Ors on 16 December, 2016
proceedings under the KLR Act, which had already been initiated against the TTE as far back as in
the year 1970 itself and with respect to which it had also filed return and the matter was then under
the consideration of the TLB, would have necessarily come up for discussions between the parties.
The agreement for sale entered into between TTE and RBT without specifically referring to such
proceedings had, in fact, provided for the lands being sold subject to right and title as were in
existence. Even the sale deed dated 17.9.1976 clearly stated that the assets were being handed over
free from all liens, charges and encumbrances save as expressly disclosed to RBT; the last part
would clearly mean reference to the pending ceiling proceedings. Thus, to rely upon the technicality
that there is no specific mention of the proceedings under the KLR Act in the Sale Deed and thus
there would be no knowledge about the same to Mr. B.M. Sharma would be a hyper technicality and
not borne out by the common course of conduct of human beings that too astute businessmen, in
the matter of such a substantial purchase of property like the 9 tea estates, Patna High Court COMP.
APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 specially when the final order in ceiling proceedings was
passed within two months of the said sale deed holding 1444 acres of land to be surrendered to the
TLB followed by further actions immediately thereafter. The same goes to show that at the very least
Mr. B.M. Sharma was fully aware of the said matter having been involved in the purchase of the 9
Tea Estates from TTE.
Moreover, since the proceedings under the KLR Act resulted in final order immediately after the
purchase of the company by RBT, it would be an important matter known to all the members of the
family interested in the company considering the fact that they are hard-headed urban, even NRI,
businessmen. The ceiling proceedings have continued over a period of time and there was actual
surrender of substantial area of land in 1984, and it is difficult to believe that such things would
have happened in a surreptitious manner and known only to one of the family groups which was not
even in control of the management of the company at that time. It has thus be assumed that all
members of the family who mattered, including Mr. B.M. Sharma, were aware about these basic
facts.
The next stage in the affairs of the company was when Shri Madan Mohan Sharma was succeeded by
his cousin of the CBS Group as Chairman and Managing Director of the Company in the year 1992 at
which stage Mr. B.M. Sharma along with respondent Manish Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ)
No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 Mohan Sharma were both made Directors of the Company. Sometime
thereafter disputes between the two branches of the family started and quitely assumed virulent
position so as to lead to the MMS branch to approach the CLB under Sections 397 and 398 of the
Companies Act regarding oppression and mismanagement by the CBS Group. Mr. B.M. Sharma,
although not a shareholder of the company, but being the head of his branch of the family after the
death of his father and considering that his family members, including his wife and children, were
holding nearly half the shares of the company had been playing a most active role, whether he was
looking into the balance sheet and annual reports of the company and sending reports and
complaints in this regard to the other Directors regarding the state of affairs of the Company, which
according to him was not being run in a proper manner. Again at this stage it would be difficult to
presume that any person with such high stake in the company through his family members would be
unaware while examining, or getting the accounts examined as has been sought to be argued by
learned counsel for the respondents, regarding the factum of surrender of lands made in the year
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/168473195/ 25
M/S Ram Bahadur Thakur & Ors vs Sh. Manish M. Sharma & Ors on 16 December, 2016
1984, duly reiterated in the Company(cid:129)s Annual Report of 1985. As stated earlier, even without such
report it is unbelievable that the respondents would remain blissfully unaware of such matter
regarding acquisition in ceiling proceedings of 1523 acres of land of the Patna High Court COMP.
APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 company, which is almost 10% of its total land. The Court can
also take judicial notice of the fact that when there is acrimony and bitterness in the matter of
running the business then both sides would be more aware of all dealings and affairs in relation to
the company, particularly with respect to assets and liability than in a case where the company
would be running with a sense of trust by both sides. Thus, it is difficult to accept that during the
long years the company was in operation, only one of the two Branches, namely the CBS Group, was
aware with regard to surrender of the land under the KLR Act and the other Branch, namely the
MMS Group was ignorant of the same.
After that there was re-constitution of the Board of Directors of the RBT by order of the CLB on
9.1.1997 and the entry of Justice A.N.Verma as Chairman of the RBT and two Directors each from
the two Groups, with further directions to the parties by the CLB to reach an amicable settlement.
This was followed by the order dated 2.3.1998 directing that the affairs of the RBT shall be jointly
managed by the two Groups. This was further followed by the Joint Management Agreement dated
1.6.1998 approved in the Board meeting dated 9.6.1998. In between the said period also letters had
been received from the Taluk Surveyor which had been responded to by the company after obtaining
advice of the lawyers of the RBT clearly stating that the land was surrendered long ago and the
action of the Taluk Surveyor Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 was
uncalled for. Since RBT was not being managed by the CBS Group alone at the relevant time rather
was under the management team headed by Justice A.N.Verma, it would be difficult to assume that
the other Group could have been totally kept out of the loop for sending such replies, that too
without any rhyme or reason for the same as it cannot be argued that any benefit could have accrued
to the CBS Group in keeping the other Group in ignorance about the surrender of lands made under
the KLR Act. Then there is the fact of Mr. P.P.Machaiya being re-employed by the Board of Directors
of RBT at the request of Mr. B.M. Sharma for MMS Group, who had signed the declaration dated
30.1.1984 by which a large portion of the land was surrendered.
From 1.6.1998 under the Joint Management Agreement, five tea estates were given to the
management of MMS Group although it has been sought to be argued on behalf of the MMS Group
that certain administrative work alone was handed over to it, which does not appear to be acceptable
as otherwise there would be no sense in stating that five estates were to be managed by the MMS
Group under the JMA. The said plea appears to be completely false. While under the joint
management the land tax was also paid by MMS Group by receipt dated 4.3.1999 on the basis of
actual acreage.
The above stand of the MMS Group has also to be considered in the light of the statement made in
the I.A. No. 136/2009 Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 that for the
first time they became aware of the land being surrendered with regard to five estates under the
KLR Act in 2009 which, on the basis of the evidence brought on the record with regard to the
agreement for sale dated 13.8.2001 executed by respondent M.M. Sharma by which the lands agreed
to be sold showed that one of the boundaries thereof was land surrendered to the Government
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/168473195/ 26
M/S Ram Bahadur Thakur & Ors vs Sh. Manish M. Sharma & Ors on 16 December, 2016
appears to be a false assertion and in this regard the explanation sought to be given by the
respondents appears to be completely unacceptable and further goes to show that a false stand was
taken in the I.A. that the MMS Group had no knowledge about the surrender of land prior to 2009.
The next issue which has serious bearing in the present matter relates to the position of Mr. B.M.
Sharma and whether his knowledge can be attributed as knowledge of the MMS Group. As pointed
out earlier the MMS Group is nothing but the family members of Mr. B.M. Sharma and he had
throughout acted on its behalf even during the course of negotiations with the CBS Group for
arriving at the family arrangement. It is Mr. B.M. Sharma who had played the lead role on behalf of
the MMS Group, which aspect of the matter has been completely overlooked by the CLB in the
impugned order dated 29.11.2010 relying upon the technicality of the description of the MMS
Group, which does not include his name and the fact that he has been Patna High Court COMP.
APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 separately defined in Clause 2.1.4 of the TD. This Court is
surprised at the hyper-technicality invoked by the CLB in the impugned order to hold that he was
never part of MMS Group. Moreover, merely because the final order of Taluk Land Board was
passed on 13.11.1976 it has been held by the CLB that it would be impossible for Mr. BM Sharma to
know details of the land surrendered in 1975. The issue is not as to which particular area had been
surrendered before the sale deed but the fact that the area of land to be surrendered was almost 10%
of the total sale area and was going to be surplus immediately after the sale deed which fact could
not have been unknown to Mr. B.M. Sharma who was the key negotiator in London on behalf of the
Company.
It has also to be remembered that Mr. B.M. Sharma has not only signed the TD on behalf of the
respondents of the MMS Group but he continued to file various petitions, affidavits, etc. on behalf of
the said Group including the Interim Application No. 136 of 2009 as power of Attorney holder on
behalf of Mr. Manish Mohan Sharma out of which the present appeal arises. Thus to assert that the
knowledge of Mr. B.M. Sharma is not the knowledge of the MMS Group would be a travesty of fact
and the finding to the contrary by the CLB has to be construed as perverse.
Much has been said about the fact that several annual reports and other documents from 1991
onwards had continued Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 showing
area of land of 9 tea estates as they were in the original sale deed and thus the respondents would
have no knowledge about surrender of land made earlier. The same does not appear to be acceptable
for the reason that those reports merely show the usual carelessness and negligence in such matters
which has continued right till the mentioning of the schedule of the TD as no one took care to
remove the survey numbers from the original areas of the sale deed and certainly does not lead to
any conclusion that this gave any wrong impression to the respondents. It can only show that no one
really bothered to check about such details even when all such reports were being filed or even when
the Schedule of the TD was being prepared. The same cannot in any way show that this was the
prevailing state of affairs as known to everyone because it would be unusual for any one to closely
look at each of the revenue survey numbers in such annual reports and nothing would really turn
upon it. It is unusual to argue that such reports were noticed but the actual statement regarding
surrender made in the year 1985 in the Annual Report of more than 1000 acres of land remained
unnoticed which appears to be unbelievable.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/168473195/ 27
M/S Ram Bahadur Thakur & Ors vs Sh. Manish M. Sharma & Ors on 16 December, 2016
More than anything else the respondents cannot show as to how during the long period from 1976
till 1999 when the sale of the tea estates was made till the MOFA and TD were signed, one group
alone of the two owning the company remained unaware about Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ)
No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 surrender of lands under the KLR Act and only the other group had
remained aware and it thus played fraud and misrepresentation, which stand of the respondents has
been curiously enough believed by the CLB also.
As rightly emphasized by learned counsel for the appellants it was not a case of sale by RBT and CBS
Groups of part of the company to a 3rd party and stranger to the family, rather it was a division of
the family assets in the form of a sale by the Transfer Deed; nonetheless the said transfer is a part of
the Memorandum of Family Arrangement in order to equitably divide the assets by the two Groups
in the said Company.
This Court is thus of the view that the finding of the CLB regarding the lack of knowledge of MMS
Group about the land surrendered and to be surrendered by the company under the KLR Act is not
borne out by and is contrary to the facts and materials on the record and is therefore perverse, and
in this regard it has to be held that the MMS Group equally with the CBS Group was aware that a
huge chunk of land, i.e., 1523 acres had been surrendered and were to be surrendered by the
company under the provisions of the KLR Act.
Once the aforesaid issue of knowledge of the MMS Group with regard to the surrender of land is
accepted then the next question which arises would be as to how there can be finding of Patna High
Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 fraudulent misrepresentation on behalf of the
CBS Group to the MMS Group as has been held by the CLB in its impugned order. A fraudulent
misrepresentation is only possible if the party making such representation is aware of certain facts
whereas the other party to whom misrepresentation is made is not aware of the same. Since the
materials on the record lead to the unequivocal conclusion that both the Groups were equally aware
about the fact of surrender, it cannot be said that there was any fraudulent misrepresentation about
the area of land. This would also be clear from the fact that what was being divided were the assets
of RBT belonging to the two Groups, even if it was ultimately given the shape of a Transfer
Document by RBT to the MMS Group. Further it is stated in the order dated 19.08.1999 of the CLB
that even the suggestion, that the five estates already under the management of the MMS Group
under the Joint Management Agreement should be given to the said group as its share on division,
had been made by the CLB, and thus it could not be said that deliberately an attempt was made to
hand over those very tea estates which had suffered maximum amount of lands being surrendered.
As a matter of fact, the issue of area comprising the said estates does not appear to have been
expressly brought out in the course of negotiation of more than 14 months by any of the parties and
both sides were simply talking in terms of five tea estates regarding which it was Patna High Court
COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 evidently known to the parties managing them under
the Joint Management Agreement that the five tea estates comprised approximately 55% of the over
all 9 tea estates and accordingly, the JMA provided for 55% cost of the expenditure of Kochi office to
be borne by the MMS Group and remaining 45% to be borne by the CBS Group.

M/S Ram Bahadur Thakur & Ors vs Sh. Manish M. Sharma & Ors on 16 December, 2016
This is also the admitted position as per the arguments of learned counsel for the respondents that
even after excluding the surrendered estates the share of MMS Group would be to the tune of 53.33
percent vis-à-vis 46.6% share of the CBS Group. This is broadly the proportion in which expenditure
was sought to be shared of the Kochi office in terms of the JMA dated 1.6.1998. Thus the finding
regarding fraud and misrepresentation by the CLB in the aforesaid circumstances appears to be
completely uncalled for and contrary to the materials on the record and its own previous order dated
19.08.1999 and, therefore, perverse.
The aforesaid two findings would broadly take care of what has been decided by the CLB in the
impugned order rendering it fit to be set aside. However since several other propositions have been
raised by learned counsels, I may briefly deal with them.
So far as the submission of learned counsel that the MOFA and TD have to be read conjointly as part
of the scheme for division of the assets and liability of RBT and not a sale, there can Patna High
Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 hardly be any doubt that the said proposition
reflects the correct state of affairs, shorn of the technicality that has been brought about in the form
of Transfer Document to effect the division of the property of the Company which aspect has also
been noted by the Supreme Court in its order dated 21.3.2006 in the inter party case.
So far as the submission of learned counsel based upon Section 20 of the Contract Act is concerned,
the same does not appear to be acceptable as Section 20 speaks about both the parties to the
agreement being mistaken as to a matter of fact essential to the agreement, which makes the
agreement void. It does not appear that the parties in the present matter were mistaken as to a
matter of fact essential to agreement rather it was division of Tea Estates in the ratio of 5:4 between
the two Groups and since it was in the form of Transfer Document, hence the sale of those five
estates to the MMS Group, without referring to 4 Tea Estates to be retained by the CBS Group. The
description of the lands in Schedule 9 to the TD is really a case of negligence on the part of the
parties to correctly refer to the area which remained within the 5 Tea Estates by not excluding from
the area what had been surrendered or were required to be surrendered under the KLR Act.
From the course of dealing of the parties as has been discussed above, it is evident that there could
be no intention of the Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 parties to
include surrendered lands in the Transfer Documents and it is on account of sheer negligence in
preparing the documents that the areas surrendered and to be surrendered had not been excluded
therein. As pointed out earlier the sale was not really in relation to the actual area of land rather the
sale was of the 5 Tea Estates and there was merely careless misdescription of the actual position of
the land comprised in the 5 Tea Estates which has occurred in the Transfer Document. Section 20 of
the Contract Act talks of a mistake as to a matter of fact essential to an agreement and where there is
such mistake, the agreement would be void. If the submission of learned counsel for the appellants
regarding application of Section 20 is accepted then mere presence of the severability clause 13.6
would not save the agreement and the entire agreement would have to be struck down as void under
the law and not voidable in which latter situation alone such a clause can operate. It is not the case
of either of the parties that the entire agreement is void. What is involved herein is really a question
of interpreting the agreement as the parties intended it to be, which has to be seen not only from the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/168473195/ 29
M/S Ram Bahadur Thakur & Ors vs Sh. Manish M. Sharma & Ors on 16 December, 2016
Clause of the TD which would have been seen in quite a different light had it been a case of sale by
the company to a third party stranger and not as in the present matter where both the parties were
in full knowledge of the affairs and proceeded to enter into the agreement. Thus there was no
mistake as a Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 matter of fact, essential
to agreement; rather it is negligence in incorporating the correct areas. In view of the fact that those
areas have been surrendered or were required to be surrendered by operation of law to the State
Government under the KLR Act, there can be no question of those areas being shown in the Tea
Estates and at least in the eyes of the parties they had entered into the agreement and were entitled
only to the Tea Estates as then remaining and not any land which had been surrendered to the
Government. Thus, Section 20 of the Contract Act can have no application in the present matter. For
the said reasons the arguments based upon Section 20 of the Contract Act will also have to be held
as not valid in the facts and circumstances of the case.
For the same reason, the argument that the operation of Sections 20 and 23 of the Contract Act is
available to be urged before the Execution Court like the CLB would also lose its relevance, on the
findings recorded above.
So far as the submission of the appellants upon clause 13.6 of the TD is concerned, as has already
been held by the Apex Court in the 2006 judgment in the dispute between the parties and it is also
the view of this Court that the CLB had the powers to adjudicate on the enforceability of the clauses
of the TD; and while doing so it had to take into consideration the entire history of the dispute
between the Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 parties including the
fact of joint management and negotiations under the aegis of the CLB and it ought not to have
decided the issue on mere technicalities.
So far as the submission that the invalidity of the TD would affect only the transfer of land already
vested in the State by virtue of KLR Act and not the entire agreement as a void one on account of
Clause 13.6 of the TD, the same has to be accepted as parties themselves had provided that if at any
time any term or provision of the document shall be held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable in
whole or in part under any rule of law or enactment, such term or provision or part shall to that
extent be deemed not to form part of the document but the enforceability of the remainder of the
document shall not be affected. It is the view of this Court that there can be no agreement between
the parties to the family arrangement to transfer any land which did not belong to the company and
had vested in the State much prior to that date almost at the time when the Tea estates vested in the
company and thus that part of the TD cannot be enforced but the same will not make the entire
document invalid.
This Court is also in agreement with the observations made in the decision of the Supreme Court of
Minnesota in Mccormick case (supra) in which it was held that a party cannot rely upon the truth of
that which he knows to be untrue and once the purchaser has full Patna High Court COMP.
APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 knowledge in respect of the property, misrepresentation
cannot be said to be an inducement or consideration to the making of the purchase and hence could
not have been part of the contract in the present matter.

M/S Ram Bahadur Thakur & Ors vs Sh. Manish M. Sharma & Ors on 16 December, 2016
Further in this case there is no real purchaser, although the division of assets of the family has been
expressed in the form of Transfer Document and it is the property of the company held in almost
equal shares by the two Groups which has been sought to be divided between them.
For the same reasons, the warranty with regard to the said lands cannot have any application to the
lands which as held earlier, were known to the parties to have been surrendered or were required to
be surrendered to the State Government under the KLR Act, and it cannot cover that part of the
agreement. In this regard the reasonable view of the matter, considering the insistence by the MMS
Group during the course of negotiations for the existence of warranty clause, would be that which
they had knowledge with regard to the area of land, about which they were already aware as held
earlier, but the fact that since 1992 the CBS Group had been in control and management of the
Company, therefore the MMS Group may not be aware of the various actions that may have been
taken by the CBS group during that period of nearly 5-6 years with respect to various amounts and
assets of the company including any mortgage or charge Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of
2010 dt.16-12-2016 or some such transfer or any such action on their part which would have any
adverse effect on the right and title over the 5 Tea Estates which had come to them. It is to be
presumed that it was for such purposes that the CBS Group was required under the warranty clause
to compensate the MMS Group with 100% compensation for the loss to be incurred by them on
account of any such actions that they may have taken during that interregnum with regard to the
assets and properties in question. Such warranty was certainly not in the contemplation of the
parties with regard to the area of land, because had that been so then at the very least when Manish
Mohan Sharma had entered into the agreement for sale with a private person in the year 2001 and
was fully aware about the surrender of land to the State Government in the boundary of the land for
which he had entered into the agreement for sale, such a plea would have been taken in 2001 itself
and not come nearly 10 years after the MOFA and TD were executed.
On the question of power of the Execution Court exercising its equitable jurisdiction with regard to
forfeiture or penal clauses, it cannot be said that such power does not exist in the Execution Court in
an appropriate case. However, the said issue is not arising in the present matter in view of the fact
that it has already been held that there is no misrepresentation on the part of the appellants, and
there could not have been any, as the respondents were fully aware of Patna High Court COMP.
APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 the state of affairs in respect of the land.
Lastly, it is the stand of the appellants that even if it is admitted that warranty clause is enforceable,
the compensation could not be 100% of the market value of the lands as it was a division of assets
between the two groups. However, I have already held that in the given facts and circumstances the
warranty clause per se would not be enforceable. Moreover, this Court finds that the respondents
having themselves in their application claimed compensation at the rate of Rs. 1.20 lac per acre,
there could have been no justification for the CLB to have further enhanced the said amount.
This Court is further not in agreement with the submission of learned counsel for the respondents
that acceptance of the plea of knowledge would amount to re-writing the terms of the consent
decree. The said proposition completely overlooks the fact that the consent decree was with respect
to the division of the assets of the family in the Tea Estates of the company, RBT and the order of the

CLB itself depends upon the ground of fraud and misrepresentation, whereas it has been found that
there was no fraud and misrepresentation.
In the said circumstances, it is the duty of the court to see that the decree is enforced in the form and
manner in which it was actually intended to by the parties and ensure that any error or omission
Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016 inadvertently which has crept in the
compromise of the parties, is dealt in an equitable manner. In this regard, this Court would consider
the repeated plea of the appellants themselves both before the CLB and this Court that the division
of estates was meant in the ratio of 55:45 %. It is not in dispute that after the transfer of 923 acres
from the share of the MMS Group and 522 acres from the share of the appellants, the MMS Group
has been admittedly left with balance of 4169.36 acres whereas the appellant CBS Group with
3651.59 acres which makes the ratio 53.33% for MMS Group vis a vis 46.6% with the CBS Group.
Thus the greater loss has been occasioned in the said matter to the MMS Group.
In view of the strong stand by the appellants throughout before the CLB and before this Court that
division of estates was meant to be in the ratio of 55:45, this Court is of the view that considering the
fact that the division of family assets had been agreed to by the CBS Group to be in the form of
Transfer Document, the appellants should on the basis of their own stand be directed to monetarily
compensate the respondents so that the respondents may be restored to the position of 55% of the
total remaining area of the acreage legally belonging to the nine Tea Estates. It would thus be fair
and equitable on the part of the appellants to compensate the respondents by paying them the
equivalent of the shortfall they would have obtained if 55% of the Tea Estates had gone to them as
compared to what they have now. Patna High Court COMP. APP.(SJ) No.3 of 2010 dt.16-12-2016
However, the compensation for the same cannot exceed what had been claimed by the respondents
in their interlocutory application, i.e., at the rate of Rs. 1.20 lacs per acre. The CLB (or its successor
under the new Act) is directed to calculate the loss caused to the respondents on account of their
share of the total acreage remaining after the acquisition under the KLR Act having come down from
55 to 53.33 % and for the said area alone the respondents shall be given compensation at the rate
which they have claimed.
The impugned order dated 29.11.2010 is, accordingly, set aside to the extent indicated above and the
appeal is partly allowed with the aforesaid observations and directions.
