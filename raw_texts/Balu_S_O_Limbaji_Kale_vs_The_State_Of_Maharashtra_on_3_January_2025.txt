2. Criminal Appeals No.224/2017, 767/2018, 768/2018, 769/2018 and 770/2018
have been preferred by the convicts. The State was granted leave to appeal against
acquittal. It is the Criminal Appeal No.994/2024. The original complainant
Bhausaheb Limbaji Surwase, brother of the deceased preferred appeal against
acquittal (Criminal Appeal No.1040/2024).
3. For the sake of convenience, the appellants/ convicts are referred to as per their
serial numbers in the Charge (Exh.52).
4. The case of the prosecution, in brief, was as follows:-
The First Information Report (F.I.R. - Exh.129) was lodged by P.W.13 Vinod by 10.45
p.m. on 20/3/2013. Vinod is the son-in-law of real brother of Uddhav Limbaji
Surwase (deceased). In the year 2012, Gram Panchayat elections of the village
Kumbhari were held. All the seats were won by the panel headed by Uddhav
(deceased).
Cri.Appeal No.224/2017 with Connected Appeals :: 12 ::
On 20 March 2013, Vinod went to the petrol pump of Uddhav. Both of them then
went to Beed. They did their official works at the offices of Public Works Department
and Zilla Parishad as well. Uddhav parked his motorbike at the house of one of his
relations. Both Vinod and Uddhav started from Beed to Neknoor on the motorbike of
Vinod. Vinod was riding the same. Uddhav was riding pillion. They reached near
Gawari Pati by 5.45 p.m. A white Indigo Car approaching from behind knocked down
their motorbike. As a result, both Vinod and Uddhav fell off the motorbike, away
from each other. 3/4 persons alighted the car. They were armed with Kattis
(instrument of harvesting sugarcane) like weapon and sword as well. They rained
blows on the person of Uddhav with those weapons. The assailants were stated to be
in the age group of 35-40 years. It was alleged in the F.I.R. that the assault was made
in pursuance of a conspiracy hatched by Chadrasen Surwase, Popat Kokate, Prakash
Kokate, Bhaskar Surwase and others.
5. Based on the F.I.R. (Exh.129), a crime vide C.R. No.34/2013 was registered at
Neknoor Police Station for the Cri.Appeal No.224/2017 with Connected Appeals :: 13

Balu S/O. Limbaji Kale vs The State Of Maharashtra on 3 January, 2025
offences punishable under Sections 302, 307, 120-B read with Section 34 of the
Indian Penal Code, since Uddhav had succumbed to the injuries.
6. During the investigation, it was found that there was a larger conspiracy to eliminate Uddhav. The
main motive was said to be victory of his panel in Panchayat elections of the Village Kumbhari.
Some other motives have also been attributed.
7. During the investigation, a crime scene panchanama (Exh.72) was drawn. Inquest (Exh.74) and
autopsy (Exh.151) on the mortal remains of Uddhav were conducted. P.W.13 Vinod was admitted to
the hospital. His injury certificate was obtained. Clothes of both Vinod and the deceased were
seized. It was found that the incident was witnessed by two more persons namely P.W.14 Sandipan
and one Shri Karande Sir (not examined). Their statements were recorded. The appellants and the
respondents came to be arrested one after the other. On arrest of the assailants/ appellants, a test
identification parade was held. Statements Cri.Appeal No.224/2017 with Connected Appeals :: 14 ::
of persons acquainted with the facts and circumstances of the case were recorded. All
the seized articles were forwarded to the Regional Forensic Laboratory, Aurangabad.
Upon completion of the investigation, a charge sheet was filed against the appellants
and the respondents in these appeals.
8. The Trial Court framed the Charge (Exh.52). The appellants and the respondents pleaded not
guilty. Their defence was of false implication. According to them, the deceased had very many
enemies. There was dispute between him on one hand and his neighbouring landholders over a right
of way.
9. The prosecution, to bring home the charge, examined 34 witnesses. The defence examined 2
witnesses. Some documents were also produced in evidence by the prosecution. On appreciation of
the evidence in the case, the Trial Court passed the order impugned herein (referred hereinbove).
10. Heard. Learned Advocates representing the appellants would submit that, the case had political
overtures.
Cri.Appeal No.224/2017 with Connected Appeals :: 15 ::
The deceased was a follower of the head of Shiv Sangram Sanghatana. The head of
the Sanghatana was a Sitting M.L.A. Although the incident was said to have taken
place by 5.45 p.m., the F.I.R. was lodged after 5 hours of the incident.
The F.I.R. was the outcome of deliberation. The informant in fact suffered a minor injury. He could
have been treated at OPD. There was no reason for him to have himself admitted to the hospital for
2 days. Our attention was drawn to certain medical papers to indicate that, in spite of his alleged
admission to the hospital soon after the incident, no Medico Legal Case was made. The Police
Outpost on the premises of Civil Hospital, Beed was even not informed. The learned Advocate meant
to say that the police machinery consciously gave time to the informant and his colleagues to think
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72310340/ 10
Balu S/O. Limbaji Kale vs The State Of Maharashtra on 3 January, 2025
over, deliberate and lodge a concocted F.I.R. According to the learned Advocate, the supplementary
statement of the informant was recorded very late. Moreover, his statement under Section 164 of the
Cr.P.C. was recorded even thereafter. Same is the case about the so called eye witness (P.W.14)
Sandipan. According to learned Advocate, all the witnesses Cri.Appeal No.224/2017 with Connected
Appeals :: 16 ::
examined by the prosecution were either close relations of the deceased or his
friends. No independent witness from the vicinity of the crime scene was examined.
The crime scene panchanama was drawn on the following day. No explanation for
delay has been offered. The so called eye witness namely Shri Karande Sir has not
been examined. The same caused prejudice to the appellants in their defence. A
written notes of submissions/ arguments along with a host of authorities (21 in

11. The learned Advocate would further submit that, the test identification parade was held
belatedly. The convicts were not kept in veil on their arrest until the test identification parade was
held. The Superintendent of Police held a Press Cri.Appeal No.224/2017 with Connected Appeals ::
18 ::
Conference on the next day of the incident. Names of the alleged suspects along with
their photographs were published in the local dailies. All the canons of holding a valid
test identification parade were thrown to wind by the Executive Magistrate who
conducted the same. The informant had not given description of the assailants. One
and the same set of dummies were there for three rounds of test identification parade
held for identification of the appellants separately. The so called dummies were not of
the complexion, height and description in all respects including the age were
(compatible) with the suspects. A host of authorities have been relied on so as to urge
for discarding such test identification parade and evidence in relation thereto.
12. On the question of recovery of Kattis pursuant to a disclosure statement made by the appellants
Sudhakar Bhalerao (original accused No.10), the learned advocate would submit that, it was an open
place. The photographs of the so called disclosure statement and recovery pursuant thereto were
digitally snapped. Although the photographer was examined in proof of the photographs, no
certificate under Cri.Appeal No.224/2017 with Connected Appeals :: 19 ::
Section 65-B of the Evidence Act was produced since the photographs were obtained
from the camera in the CD, and then in a pen drive for being produced as evidence
before the Court. The learned Advocate would further submit that, the Medical
Officer did not give the exact time of death of the deceased. Instead of reiterating the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72310340/ 12
Balu S/O. Limbaji Kale vs The State Of Maharashtra on 3 January, 2025
submissions made by the learned Advocate, we would prefer to deal with the same
while appreciating the evidence in the case.
13. So far as regards reliance on the 21 authorities relied on are concerned, we have closely perused
the same. Needless to mention, the Head Notes of most of the cases indicate that the observations
made therein were based on the facts and circumstances therein. It is reiterated that, there can
hardly be a precedent to be relied on for deciding a criminal case since no two cases are similar in
facts. A difference of a fact herein and there makes all the difference. With all humility at our
command, the authorities relied and the propositions therein are on our mind while deciding the
present appeals.
Cri.Appeal No.224/2017 with Connected Appeals :: 20 ::
14. The learned A.P.P. would, on the other hand, submit that, the case was based on eye witness
account. One of them was an injured eye witness. Evidence of an injured eye witness carries more
weight. The witnesses have no reason to falsely implicate the appellants and the respondents,
leaving the actual culprits. According to learned A.P.P., the suggestions given to the prosecution
witnesses indicate admission as to presence of the eye witness at the crime scene. He relied on the
following two authorities :-
(1) Balu Sudam Khalde & anr. Vs. The State of Maharashtra 2023 LiveLaw (SC) 279
(2) Birbal Nath Vs. The State of Rajasthan & ors.
(Criminal Appeal No.1587/2008, decided on 30/10/2023)
15. According to learned A.P.P., no two persons could have a photographic memory. Reaction of
every person to one and the same incident may differ in very many respects. The evidence of the eye
witnesses are consistent in material particulars. He, therefore, urged for dismissal of the appeals
against conviction and urged for allowing the appeal against acquittal.
Cri.Appeal No.224/2017 with Connected Appeals :: 21 ::
16. The learned Advocate for the victim made submissions on the lines of the submissions made by
the learned A.P.P. He took us through certain observations made by the Trial Court. According to
him, it was a brutal murder. The theory of conspiracy too has been duly proved.
17. Let us now turn to the evidence on record and appreciate the same.
The incident took place by little past 5.30 p.m. at Gawari Pati. Uddhav Surwase suffered 22 injuries.
Most of them were incised wounds. The same indicates the assailants to have used sharp weapons.
The number of injuries suggest that the assailants must be more than one. P.W.24 Dr. Upendra
conducted autopsy on the mortal remains of Uddhav. In his opinion, Uddhav died of haemorrhagic
shock due to bleeding due to multiple injuries in the neck organs and major vessels. The post
mortem report finds place at Exh.151. True, neither the post mortem report nor the oral evidence of

Balu S/O. Limbaji Kale vs The State Of Maharashtra on 3 January, 2025
P.W.24 suggests the exact time of death. The fact, however, remains that, Uddhav was rushed to the
Civil Hospital, Beed. The Cri.Appeal No.224/2017 with Connected Appeals :: 22 ::
distance between the crime scene and Beed was about 25 Kms. We have no reason to
doubt the oral evidence of the informant, victim and the witness that soon after the
incident both of them were rushed to the Civil Hospital and admitted thereto.
18. Uddhav Surwase met with homicidal death is a fact not in dispute before us. The question is,
whether the crime is committed by the appellants and respondents pursuant to a conspiracy hatched
in that regard. According to the prosecution, the assailants were Rajendra Ghige and Sudhakar
Bhalerao (original accused Nos.5 and 10).
19. P.W.13 Vinod is an injured eye witness. He testified that, deceased Uddahv was his cousin
father-in-law. On the given day i.e. on 20/3/2012, he had been to Beed along with Uddhav. After
having completed their works, they were on their way back to Neknoor on his (P.W.13) motorbike.
While they were near Gawari Pati on Manjarsumba to Neknoor Road, a white car came from behind
and dashed his motorbike. As a result of the dash, both of them fell off the motorbike. He got
Cri.Appeal No.224/2017 with Connected Appeals :: 23 ::
frightened. He witnessed two persons were assaulting Uddhav with Kattis. Third one
was standing with a Khanjar and the other was having a packet containing chilly
powder. These last two persons were facilitating the assault. Meaning thereby, they
were guarding the assailants if anyone intervenes. P.W.13 further testified that the
driver of the car took it ahead and then turned the car suggesting blocking of their
way. He further testified that, appellant Sudhakar Bhalerao said, "Chandrasen
Surwase and Popat Kokate be informed that as decided Uddhav is finished". He
further testified that the said persons then boarded the car. The car proceeded
towards Manjarsumba. The evidence of P.W.13 Vinod further indicates that Karande
Sir and Sandipan Ghallal (P.W.14) had witnessed the incident. Both of them were
passing by on their respective motorbikes. Karande Sir informed him that he was not
keeping well. He (P.W.13), therefore, made a phone call to Neknoor Police Station.
10-15 persons had gathered on the spot. In the meanwhile, jeep of Uddhav Surwase
arrived. They took Uddhav to Civil Hospital, Beed. He too (P.W.13) had suffered
injuries to his hand and blunt trauma as well. He Cri.Appeal No.224/2017 with
Connected Appeals :: 24 ::
too was admitted to the hospital. Uddhav breathed his last. P.W.13 went on to state
that, he was indoor patient for 2-3 days. The police had come to the hospital. The
police recorded his statement-cum-F.I.R. (Exh.129) in the hospital. He referred to the
same.
20. P.W.13 Vinod went on to state that, after his discharge from the hospital, he had been to the
Central Prison for test identification parade. He identified the assailants, those two others and the
driver of the car as well. In the first round of the test identification parade, he identified the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72310340/ 14
Balu S/O. Limbaji Kale vs The State Of Maharashtra on 3 January, 2025
assailants, Rajendra Ghige and Sudhakar Bhalerao (original accused Nos.5 and 10). P.W.13 then
referred to his statement recorded under Section 164 of the Cr.P.C.
21. He was subjected to a searching cross- examination by different Advocates representing their
respective clients/ appellants/ respondents. It was suggested to him that, he suffered injury to his
hand on account of a fall from motorbike. He explained that he gave the history of 'assault' since the
car had knocked down them and thereafter Cri.Appeal No.224/2017 with Connected Appeals :: 25 ::
the assault was mounted. According to him, the incident lasted for 4-5 minutes. He
admitted that his relations had come to the hospital to see him. He was then shifted
to Ward No.5. He admitted to have had not stated to the police that the assault was
made with sword. His attention was, therefore, adverted to the F.I.R. and particularly
the word 'sword'. Then he was further confronted with the F.I.R. which was silent to
record that, "Chandrasen Surwase and Popat Kokate be informed that as decided
Uddhav Surwase is finished". He then testified that he did not run away from the
spot. His attention was, therefore, drawn to his supplementary statement, wherein
such sentence has been recorded. He could not state who admitted him to the
hospital. He denied that he left the hospital against medical advice, but it was
suggested to him that he left the hospital for attending funeral and then returned to
the hospital as an indoor patient. He was also confronted to bring on record that the
F.I.R. is silent to record therein that P.W.14 Sandipan and Karande Sir had witnessed
the incident. The tenor of further cross-examination indicate that the appellants and
the respondents were followers of late Vinayak Cri.Appeal No.224/2017 with
Connected Appeals :: 26 ::
Mete, the then Head of Shiv Sangram Party. He denied to have had worked as a P.A.
of late Vinayak Mete. A reference to a murder case that dates back to 1994 was made
in his cross-examination so as to indicate a motive to eliminate Uddhav. The said
suggestion indicates that none of the parties to these appeals were privy to the said
incident of murder of one Mahaveer Surwase. In short, according to the defence, the
incident might have been a fall out of the murder that took place way back in 1994.
Some other motives have also been sought to be brought on record through the
evidence of the real brother of the deceased. Without referring thereto, we are of the
view that the appellants could not make out their defence of some other motive
behind the incident for commission of the crime by someone else. Needless to
mention, in a case based on direct evidence, motive plays insignificant role.
22. The fact is that, a few months before the incident, Village Panchayat elections were held. A panel
set up by deceased Uddhav won all the seats. The appellants and the respondents belonged to other
side. It is true that, Cri.Appeal No.224/2017 with Connected Appeals :: 27 ::
investigating machinery did not place on record station diary entry relating to the
phone call made by P.W.13 regarding the incident. The appellants have, therefore,
every reason to contend that the informant and his colleagues had deliberations and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72310340/ 15
Balu S/O. Limbaji Kale vs The State Of Maharashtra on 3 January, 2025
the F.I.R. was the outcome thereof. Needless to mention that the informant did not
name the names of the assailants in the F.I.R. As such, the F.I.R. was lodged as
against unknown assailants. Those who have been named in the F.I.R. were said to
have got Uddhav killed in pursuance of a larger conspiracy. We have, therefore, no
reason not to rely on the testimony of P.W.13 who himself had suffered injury in the
incident. The motorbike that was knocked down by the white car belonged to P.W.13.
It is, therefore, but natural for us to infer that it was he and none else who was riding
the motorbike and the deceased was riding pillion. The assailants had an intention to
kill Uddhav and not the informant. The informant was therefore spared. True, the
informant in his statement under Section 164 of Cr.P.C. stated that he ran away in the
field, but it was after having witnessed the incident.
Cri.Appeal No.224/2017 with Connected Appeals :: 28 ::
23. Then our attention was adverted to the documents (Exhs.184 and 185). Exh.184 is the injury
certificate of P.W.13. The same indicates that he suffered C.L.W. over his left forearm. The nature of
injury was simple and the age was within 24 hours. There was a remark in the last column that the
patient absconded on 22/3/2012 from the ward. It was P.W.30 Dr. Minakshi who had attended to
P.W.13 in the hospital. She was not confronted with the said remark. Instead, it was shown to the
investigating officer. The author of the said document is P.W.30 Dr. Meenakshi to whom it should
have been confronted. It is true that, the certificate was issued on 4/7/2013 i.e. long after the
incident. The learned Advocate representing the assailants Rajendra Ghige and Sudhakar Bhalerao
(original accused Nos.5 and 10), however, suggested P.W.13 Vinod that the injury certificate
(Exh.184) was issued on the basis of original medical record. The said suggestion helps the
prosecution a lot. P.W.30 Dr. Meenakshi being an independent witness and there being nothing to
indicate that she had any reason to fabricate false medical papers putting her service at risk. It is
reiterated that, the injury certificate was Cri.Appeal No.224/2017 with Connected Appeals :: 29 ::
admitted to have been issued on the basis of the entries in the original record/ case
papers.
24. Then our attention was adverted to Exhs.185 and
186. Both these documents were in the nature of information to the Police Station, Beed regarding
admission of P.W.13 Vinod and deceased Uddhav to the hospital. The document was referred by the
defence itself. Perusal of those documents indicates that the intimation was given on the very day
with a history of assault. The timing of admission of both of them to the hospital was 6.45 p.m. Both
these documents came into being in the official course of business. It is true that the Medical Officer
on duty appears to have not reported the matter to the Police Outpost located on the premises of the
Civil Hospital itself as a Medico Legal Case. The appellants had examined D.W.2 Shankar Rathod,
Police Constable attached to the said Outpost. According to him, he was not on duty at the relevant
time. The fact remains that, the Medical Officer reported admission of both P.W.13 Vinod and
deceased Uddhav to the hospital, directly to the Beed Police Station.

Cri.Appeal No.224/2017 with Connected Appeals :: 30 ::
25. The test identification parade was held by the Executive Magistrate (P.W.31)
Abhay Maske on 12/4/2013 i.e. about 23 days after the incident. He was examined as
a witness in the case. His evidence indicates that the same set of dummy persons
were used for three rounds of test identification parade. On this ground alone, the
subsequent two rounds of test identification parade got vitiated. More so, when it was
only P.W.13 Vinod who was to identify the culprits.
The same suggests that he knew after the first round that the same dummy to whom he did not
identify the assailants were there in the subsequent two test identification parade rounds. In the first
round he identified both the assailants. Rajendra Ghige and Sudhakar Bhalerao (original accused
Nos.5 and
10).
26. P.W.34 Abhay Dongare, the investigating officer in his cross-examination admitted that on the
next day of the incident, the Superintendent of Police had held Press Conference. It was informed
that 4 suspects were held. He went on to admit that, the photographs of the arrestees were
published in the next day dailies with their names. There is Cri.Appeal No.224/2017 with Connected
Appeals :: 31 ::
also no evidence to indicate that the dummies were of the same age group and
somewhat similar in appearance, height etc. to those to be identified in the test
identification parade. We have perused the judgments of the Apex Court in case of
Budhsen, Ramana Reddy, Rajesh Jagesha, Ravi @ Ravichandran etc., relied on in
relation to discarding of test identification parade evidence.
27. In case of Munna Kumar Vs. State of Andhra Pradesh (AIR 2012 SC 2470), it was held that, even
test identification parade was held long after photographs of the accused were published, veracity of
the test identification parade did not stand impaired. In paragraph 46 of the judgment, the Apex
Court held :
"46. However, we hasten to clarify that it is always appropriate for the investigating
agency to hold identification parade at the earliest, in accordance with law, so that
the accused does not face prejudice on that count. We may refer to the judgment of
this Court in a more recent judgment in the case of Sidhartha Vashisht alias Manu
Sharma Vs. State (NCT of Delhi) [(2010) 6 SCC 1] : (AIR 2010 SC 2352 : 2010 AIR
SCW 4302), where law in relation to purpose of holding an identification parade, the
effect of delay and its evidentiary value were Cri.Appeal No.224/2017 with Connected
Appeals :: 32 ::
discussed. The Court held as under (Paras 115 and 117 of AIR, AIR SCW) :-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72310340/ 17
Balu S/O. Limbaji Kale vs The State Of Maharashtra on 3 January, 2025
"256. The law as it stands today is set out in the following decisions of this Court
which are reproduced as hereinunder:
Munshi Singh Gautam v. State of M.P.: (AIR 2005 SC 402 : 2004 AIR SCW 6537) :
SCC pp.
642-45, paras 16-17 & 19) "16. As was observed by this Court in Matru v.
State of U.P. (AIR 1971 SC 1050) identification tests do not constitute substantive evidence. They are
primarily meant for the purpose of helping the investigating agency with an assurance that their
progress with the investigation into the offence is proceeding on the right lines. The identification
can only be used as corroborative of the statement in court. (See Santokh Singh v. Izhar Hussain.
(AIR 1973 SC 2190). The necessity for holding an identification parade can arise only when the
accused are not previously known to the witnesses. The whole idea of a test identification parade is
that witnesses who claim to have seen the culprits at the time of occurrence are to identify them
from the midst of other persons without any aid or any other source. The test is done to check upon
their veracity. In other words, the main object of holding an identification parade, during the
investigation stage, is to test the memory of the witnesses based upon first impression and also to
enable the prosecution to decide whether all or any of them could be cited as eyewitnesses of the
crime. The identification proceedings are in the nature of tests and significantly, therefore, there is
no provision for it in the Code and the Evidence Act. It is desirable that a test identification parade
should be conducted as Cri.Appeal No.224/2017 with Connected Appeals :: 33 ::
soon as after the arrest of the accused. This becomes necessary to eliminate the
possibility of the accused being shown to the witnesses prior to the test identification
parade. This is a very common plea of the accused and, therefore, the prosecution has
to be cautious to ensure that there is no scope for making such an allegation. If,
however, circumstances are beyond control and there is some delay, it cannot be said
to be fatal to the prosecution.
17. It is trite to say that the substantive evidence is the evidence of identification in
court. Apart from the clear provisions of Section 9 of the Evidence Act, the position in
law is well settled by a catena of decisions of this Court. The facts, which establish the
identity of the accused persons, are relevant under Section 9 of the Evidence Act. As a
general rule, the substantive evidence of a witness is the statement made in court.
The evidence of mere identification of the accused person at the trial for the first time
is from its very nature inherently of a weak character. The purpose of a prior test
identification, therefore, is to test and strengthen the trustworthiness of that
evidence. It is, accordingly, considered a safe rule of prudence to generally look for
corroboration of the sworn testimony of witnesses in court as to the identity of the
accused who are strangers to them, in the form of earlier identification proceedings.
This rule of prudence, however, is subject to exceptions, when, for example, the court
is impressed by a particular witness on whose testimony it can safely rely, without
such or other corroboration. The identification parades belong to the stage of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72310340/ 18
Balu S/O. Limbaji Kale vs The State Of Maharashtra on 3 January, 2025
investigation, and there is no provision in the Code which obliges the investigating
agency to hold or confers a right upon the accused to claim a test identification
Cri.Appeal No.224/2017 with Connected Appeals :: 34 ::
parade. They do not constitute substantive evidence and these parades are essentially
governed by Section 162 of the Code. Failure to hold a test identification parade
would not make inadmissible the evidence of identification in court. The weight to be
attached to such identification should be a matter for the courts of fact. In
appropriate cases it may accept the evidence of identification even without insisting
on corroboration. (See Kanta Prashad v. Delhi Admn. (AIR 1958 SC 350), Vaikuntam
Chandrappa v. State of A.P. (AIR 1960 SC 1340), Budhsen v. State of U.P. (AIR 1970
SC 1321) and Rameshwar Singh v. State of J&K. (AIR 1972 SC 102).
19. In Harbajan Singh v. State of J & K, (AIR 1975 SC 1814), though a test identification parade was
not held, this Court upheld the conviction on the basis of the identification in court corroborated by
other circumstantial evidence. In that case it was found that the appellant and one Gurmukh Singh
were absent at the time of roll call and when they were arrested on the night of 16-12-1971 their rifles
smelt of fresh gunpowder and that the empty cartridge case which was found at the scene of offence
bore distinctive markings showing that the bullet which killed the deceased was fired from the rifle
of the appellant. Noticing these circumstances this Court held: (SCC p. 481, para
4) '4. In view of this corroborative evidence we find no substance in the argument urged on behalf of
the appellant that the investigating officer ought to have held an identification parade and that the
failure of Munshi Ram to mention the names of the two accused to the neighbours who came to the
scene Cri.Appeal No.224/2017 with Connected Appeals :: 35 ::
immediately after the occurrence shows that his story cannot be true. As observed by
this Court in Jadunath Singh v. State of U.P. (air 1971 sc 363)absence of test
identification is not necessarily fatal. The fact that Munshi Ram did not disclose the
names of the two accused to the villagers only shows that the accused were not
previously known to him and the story that the accused referred to each other by
their respective names during the course of the incident contains an element of
exaggeration. The case does not rest on the evidence of Munshi Ram alone and the
corroborative circumstances to which we have referred to above lend enough
assurance to the implication of the appellant."
28. Since P.W.13 Vinod did not give the description of the appellants/ assailants and
two others in the F.I.R., besides the delay in test identification parade with manifest
errors in holding the same, we propose to discard the evidence of P.W.13 Vinod so far
as regards the identification of the appellant by him before the Court for the first
time. The matter however, does not rest at that.
29. As stated earlier, the case is based on eye witness account. He is none other than
P.W.14 Sandipan. True, he is cousin of the deceased (son of maternal uncle). His
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72310340/ 19
Balu S/O. Limbaji Kale vs The State Of Maharashtra on 3 January, 2025
conduct Cri.Appeal No.224/2017 with Connected Appeals :: 36 ::
post incident also appeared somewhat unnatural. The fact is, however, that, his
presence at or around the crime scene has been impliedly admitted by the appellants
during his cross- examination. His police statement too was recorded before 24 hours
of the incident.
30. P.W.14 Sandipan testified that he had been to Beed on 20/3/2013. He was on his
way back towards Neknoor. He was riding the motorbike. He happened to meet both,
P.W.13 Vinod and deceased Uddhav, who were proceeding in the same direction on
another motorbike. According to him, Uddhav was riding pillion. P.W.14 Sandipan
went on to testify that, on the way, just before Gawari Pati was approached, a white
Indigo car gave dash to the motorbike from behind. As a result thereof, both Vinod
and Uddhav fell off. He thought that it was a vehicular accident. He further testified
that, Sudhakar and Tuljiram (appellant - original accused Nos.10 and 7 respectively)
alighted from the car. They were armed with Kattis. Both of them assaulted Uddhav
with Kattis. He went on to state further that the appellant Vinod was standing with a
dagger in his hand and appellant Rajendra was armed with a Cri.Appeal No.224/2017
with Connected Appeals :: 37 ::
packet of chilly powder. He further testified that, when the vehicle took turn, he saw
appellant Babu Kale was at the driver's seat of the car. He claimed to have seen even
the number plate in broken condition. He gave the number of the car MH-14-CH-172.
He further testified that, Karande Sir also arrived there. All of them lifted Uddhav
and took him to Civil Hospital, Beed. On having seen the incident, he was frightened.
He required medical attention to himself. He, therefore, went to a private hospital at
Neknoor. Later on he learnt Uddhav to have passed away. He further testified that,
on the following day, he on his own went to the Police and gave his statement.
31. During his cross-examination on behalf of original accused Nos.1 to 4, it was
suggested to him, "It is correct to say that, when the Car had given dash to the
motorcycle of Vinod Kawade, I reached the spot on my motorcycle". It is true that, I
was going towards eastern side of the road, therefore, I parked my motorcycle on left
side of the road near the spot."
According to him, Vinod did not run away in the field from the spot. He was therefore confronted
with his police statement, Cri.Appeal No.224/2017 with Connected Appeals :: 38 ::
wherein such matter finds place. It was further suggested to him, "It would be correct
that as soon as I reached the spot on motorcycle, immediately Karade Sir came on his
motorcycle." There was no discussion amongst himself, Vinod and Karande Sir about
the assailants. The witness volunteered that he was frightened. It was further
suggested, "It will be correct to say that, the assailants had whisked away from the
spot within 3 to 4 minutes after the incident." He did not disclose the names of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72310340/ 20
Balu S/O. Limbaji Kale vs The State Of Maharashtra on 3 January, 2025
appellants. He further testified that he had been to Civil Hospital while in his
examination-in-chief he testified that he directly went to a private clinic.
32. The learned Advocate representing the appellants/ assailants Rajendra Ghige and
Sudhakar Bhalerao (original accused Nos.5 and 10) in the cross-examination of this
witness, suggested to him that, "It will be correct to say that I was knowing Sudhakar
Bhalerao as resident of village Kumbhari prior to the incident. Till today I have no
enmity or dispute with Sudhakar Bjhalerao. I was on talking terms with Sudhakar
Bhalerao before the incident. Before 15 to 20 days of the incident I had seen
Sudhakar Bhalerao in a field. It is Cri.Appeal No.224/2017 with Connected Appeals ::
39 ::
correct to say that at the time of incident Sudhakar Bhalerao did not assault me,
abused me or threatened me because I have no enmity with him. Immediately after
the assault, the assailants left the place of incident. When the assailants left the place
of incident, I, Vinod Kawade and Karande Sir were present there. The assailants did
not do anything to Vinod Kawade and Karande Sir." The further suggestion merits
reproduction. The suggestion was to the effect "It will be correct to say that when
Vinod Kawade and Uddhav Survase had overtaken my motorcycle, it was our first
meeting on that day." The aforesaid suggestion amounts to implied admission of
about P.W.13 Vinod and the deceased having been together. They met P.W.14
Sandipan. Karande Sir was also on his motorbike. He too met them. Appellant
Sudhakar did not assault him (P.W.14) as he had no enmity with him. This goes a
long way to infer that the assailants' target was Uddhav (deceased) and none else.
33. Although this witness had not disclosed the incident immediately to anyone, the
incident was so ghastly, his evidence that he was frightened and was required to take
Cri.Appeal No.224/2017 with Connected Appeals :: 40 ::
medical treatment could not be doubted. More so, in view of the aforesaid implied
admission in the form of suggestion. He even gave the name of the hospital/ clinic to
which he had been to take treatment soon after the incident. It was Dr. Shirsath's
hospital.
34. In view of suggestions admitting this witness to have witnessed the incident, his
somewhat unnatural conduct post incident would be of little consequence. The case
is, therefore, distinguishable with the authorities relied on namely, Shankarlal,
Naseem Khan and Amar Singh (supra). Nothing has been brought on record during
the cross-examination of this witness to lead us to infer that he had an axe to grind
against the appellants and save the actual culprits.
35. On arrest of the appellant Sudhakar, he expressed desire to make a disclosure
statement. P.W.12 Parmeshwar is a witness to the disclosure statement. Most of the
part of the statement was inadmissible since the appellant Sudhakar took the police
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72310340/ 21
Balu S/O. Limbaji Kale vs The State Of Maharashtra on 3 January, 2025
and the panchas to the places wherefrom nothing could be recovered. P.W.12
Parmeshwar testified that, Cri.Appeal No.224/2017 with Connected Appeals :: 41 ::
appellant Sudhakar made a statement that he would produce weapon which he had
hidden under ground at Bhoom. He had further disclosed that he would produce
Katti like weapon. The police officer recorded the said statement, he signed the same
as a witness. The appellant too signed the same. It is at Exh.119. The appellant then
took them to one place in agricultural field. It was known as "Bamanpatti". The
cameraman had accompanied them. There were 6 rows of heaps of mud. Sudhakar
removed two Kattis, one each from under two different heaps. The police seized the
same under panchanama (Exh.120). He signed the same. On the same lines is the
evidence of the investigating officer who recorded the disclosure statement made by
appellant Sudhakar. Then there is evidence of P.W.32 Vikas who had accompanied
them to snap the photographs. The evidence of this witness is consistent with the
evidence of P.W.12 and the investigating officer. Although the photographs tendered
in the evidence by him were not supported by Certificate under Section 65-B of the
Evidence Act, his oral testimony would reinforce the prosecution case. During the
investigation, both the seized Cri.Appeal No.224/2017 with Connected Appeals :: 42
::
Kattis were shown to the Medical Officer Dr. Upendra Kulkarni (P.W.24), who
opined that the injuries on the person of the deceased were possible by such weapon.
The C.A. report (Exh.282) indicates that there was human blood on one of the Kattis.
This fact further reinforce the prosecution case. Since the evidence of the witnesses
was recorded about three years after the incident, there was bound to be some
inconsistency inter-se the evidence of the prosecution witnesses. It was as regards the
number of police vehicles which had been to the spot for recovery of Kattis pursuant
to the disclosure statement etc. The disclosure statement made by the appellant
would further be relevant as conduct under Section 8 of the Evidence Act.
36. We, therefore, find that the evidence of P.W.14 Sandipan as regards appellant
Sudhakar to have assaulted the deceased with Katti gets reinforced.
37. During the investigation, the car was found abandoned in a Ghat Section. It was
seized under the panchanama (Exh.85). P.W.6 Shrikrishna testified that the car
Cri.Appeal No.224/2017 with Connected Appeals :: 43 ::
was found abandoned within the limits of Bhoom village. He described the car as - it
was white colour Indigo Car. The radiator thereof was crumbled. Front side number
plate was missing. Rear side number plate was intact. It was yellow colour plate with
figures thereon written in black colour. The same indicates that it was a public
transport vehicle. He gave the car number. The front side parking lamp was
damaged. Some documents were seized from the car, particularly diary wherein
name of appellant Balu Limbaji Kale was written. A PAN Card of Babu Kale was also
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72310340/ 22
Balu S/O. Limbaji Kale vs The State Of Maharashtra on 3 January, 2025
found in the car besides his election/ voter's card. Two blank stamp papers were also
seized under the panchanama.
38. Nothing fruitful can be brought on record through his cross-examination.
39. P.W.23 Odin testified that, the said car had belonged to him. His wife was
proprietor of a firm, "Peace Tours and Travels". She had purchased the said car. It
was registered in the name of the very firm. He further testified that, the appellant
Babu Limbaji Kale was a driver on a car in a Cri.Appeal No.224/2017 with Connected

year 2012 for one year period. He used to drop him at his work place. On appellant
Babu's request, he delivered the said car to him. It was in fact the sale transaction.
For purchase of the car a loan was raised from Finance Company. The loan was
outstanding. The car, therefore, could not be transferred in the name of the appellant
Babu with R.T.O. record. The appellant Babu paid him Rs.84,500/- as against
delivery of the car in his favour.
40. During cross-examination, the witness testified that the transaction was oral one.
No writing was effected. It needs no mention that the sale of a motor vehicle is
governed by the Sale of Goods Act. Delivery of possession and receipt of
consideration amount completes the sale transaction.
Property in the goods sold is transferred when intended to be transferred. It may, therefore, be a
case of out and out sale or agreement for sale since the entire consideration amount was not paid
and the loan of Finance Company was still outstanding. The fact remains that the car changed hands
from P.W.23's wife to appellant Babu. There is evidence of P.W.20 Bhausaheb to the effect that
Babu and some of the Cri.Appeal No.224/2017 with Connected Appeals :: 45 ::
respondents would roam in the same car in the village. Babu in his examination
under Section 313 of the Cr.P.C. did not offer any explanation except the denial. He
also did not offer any explanation about he having been seen at the driver's seat while
the car knocked down the motorcycle. As such, his role in the crime has been duly
proved. Although it may appear that he had no intention to kill the motorbike rider
since he gave push to the motorbike with the car from behind, so as to facilitate
appellant (original accused Nos.5 and 10) to commit murder of Uddhav, the said act
is an offence of abetment to commit murder in view of Section 107 of the Indian
Penal Code. Moreover, there were break marks trail up to 75 ft. noticed at the crime
scene. When the abettor is present at the crime scene, his criminal liability is equal to
that of the actual culprit. (Section 114 I.P.C.). He would, therefore, be equally liable
for the punishment provided for the offence of murder under Section 302 of the
Indian Penal Code.

41. Although very many witnesses were examined, the evidence of most of them is not
of much relevance. A passing reference would, however, be made to the same. P.W.1

Babaso is a witness to the crime scene panchanama (Exh.72). it was drawn on the
following early morning. The investigating officer had on the given day to
Aurangabad in connection with some other matter. His evidence indicates that, after
having been informed about the incident, he reached Civil Hospital by 8.30 p.m.
Then he recorded the F.I.R. and registered the crime late in the night. His evidence
further indicates that the crime scene was guarded by the Police Constable on his
direction. We, therefore, find no fault with him in drawing the spot panchanama after
a few hours. At the crime scene a piece of cut human finger was found besides other
articles.
42. P.W.2 Raosaheb Tipale is a witness to the inquest panchanama (Exh.74). P.W.3
Raichand, P.W.4 Ashok and P.W.5 Laxman are witnesses to the seizure of clothes.
P.W.7 Keshav was a witness to a demo panchanama suggesting that both the vehicles
namely the motorbike and the car involved in the incident were brought together.
How much relevance is there to such kind of exercise is doubtful. The fact, however,
remains that, his evidence indicates that, both the vehicles had received dent and
damage at the relevant part thereof.
Cri.Appeal No.224/2017 with Connected Appeals :: 47 ::
43. P.W.9 Raosaheb Sapkal is a witness to the disclosure statement by Sudhakar
Bhalerao (appellant in Criminal Appeal No.770/2018). The same is not relevant since
the appellant took them to various place where he had been post incident and the
place whereat the conspiracy was hatched. The evidence of P.W.10 Ajay, P.W.16
Hanumant and P.W.17 Rajesh was skipped by the learned Advocates representing the
appellants. P.W.18 Vasant has testified to have had seen P.W.13 Vinod and Uddhav
proceeding on a motorbike. We do not propose to record his evidence in extenso
since the said fact has been admitted during cross-
examination of P.W.14. P.W.19 Vitthal is a witness who had carried 5 persons (appellants) in his car
to Pune soon after the incident. He could only identify the appellant Babu Kale as one of those 5.
P.W.11 Ramdas is a witness relating to seizure of cell phone from appellant Sunil Surwase
(panchanama Exh.111).
44. From the appreciation of the evidence so far referred to above, we come to the conclusion that,
on the given day, that both P.W.13 Vinod and deceased were proceeding on Cri.Appeal No.224/2017

motorbike from Beed to Neknoor. At Gawari Pati, a white Indigo Car knocked down
the motorbike. The incident was witnessed by P.W.14 Sandipan. He saw appellant
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72310340/ 24
Balu S/O. Limbaji Kale vs The State Of Maharashtra on 3 January, 2025
Babu Kale at the driver seat. He also saw the appellants (original accused Nos.5 and
10) assaulting the deceased with sharp weapons. The presence of P.W.14 Sandipan
has been admitted. Admittedly, one witness by name Karande Sir was also there. His
statement under Section 161 of the Cr.P.C. was recorded. He has not been examined
as a prosecution witness. The investigating officer Sayed Asef (P.W.33) who recorded
his statement has admitted that, Karande Sir has stated in his statement that two
persons had alighted from the car. He meant to say that those two persons had
assaulted the deceased. While Karande Sir was not examined as prosecution witness
in this case, the Trial Court ought not to have allowed to refer to his police statement.
Since the same has already been brought on record and the evidence indicates that
there is inconsistency inter-se the prosecution witnesses namely informant, testified
that, three persons alighted from the car. According to P.W.14 Sandipan, they
Cri.Appeal No.224/2017 with Connected Appeals :: 49 ::
were 4 in number while the investigating officer testified that Karande Sir told him
that those were 2 in number. At the cost of repetition, it is observed that, the learned
Advocate for the appellants (original accused Nos.5 and 10) has impliedly admitted
the presence of P.W.14 Sandipan and further suggested that the appellant Sudhakar
did not assault the said witness since he had no enmity with him. Meaning thereby,
the presence of appellant Sudhakar has also been impliedly admitted.
45. As already observed above, the evidence indicates that, the car originally belonged to a firm
owned by wife of P.W.23 Odin. He knew appellant Babu Kale. The car involved in the incident was
sold to appellant Babu Kale. The appellant was seen with the car for many a days preceding the
incidence. P.W.14 identified him as the person who was in the driver seat of the car which knocked
down the motorcycle. As such, he facilitated the commission of the crime. In view of the
inconsistency as to the number of persons alighting from the car, two appellants namely Rajendra
alias Raju Murlidhar Ghige and Vinod Madhukar Ghige, deserve to be extended the Cri.Appeal
No.224/2017 with Connected Appeals :: 50 ::
benefit of doubt. Admittedly, both of them were not involved in mounting an assault
on the deceased. In our view, therefore, their appeals deserves to be allowed.
APPEALS AGAINST ACQUITTAL :
46. The State and brother of the deceased preferred these two appeals and urged for setting aside
the acquittal of the respondents therein. Admittedly, these respondents were not present at the
crime scene. None of them played any overt act. They are sought to be fastened with criminal
liability on the ground of privy to conspiracy to commit the murder. Section 120-A defines the
offence of criminal conspiracy. It reads thus :
"120A. Definition of criminal conspiracy.-- When two or more persons agree to do, or
cause to be done (1) an illegal act, or (2) an act which is not illegal by illegal means,
such an agreement is designated a criminal conspiracy:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72310340/ 25
Balu S/O. Limbaji Kale vs The State Of Maharashtra on 3 January, 2025
Provided that no agreement except an agreement to commit an offence shall amount
to a criminal Cri.Appeal No.224/2017 with Connected Appeals :: 51 ::
conspiracy unless some act besides the agreement is done by one or more parties to
such agreement in pursuance thereof.
Explanation.-- It is immaterial whether the illegal act is the ultimate object of such
agreement, or is merely incidental to that object."
47. It is said that it is very easy to allege a case of conspiracy but difficult to prove it. According to
the prosecution case, the panel of deceased Uddhav set up for Gram Panchayat election in 2012 won
all the seats. The respondents were, therefore, envy of Uddhav's progress. They, therefore, conspired
to do away with him. In proof of conspiracy, the prosecution examined P.W.20 Bhasusaheb Survase,
P.W.21 Mohan, P.W.22 Digambar Hade, P.W.25 Ganesh and P.W.26 Chandrakant Survase.
48. P.W.20 Bhausaheb Survase, brother of the deceased, who was not an eye witness to the incident,
testified that the respondent Chandrasen Surwase left their group 10 years prior to the incident and
started working against them. He joined the group of the respondents namely Prakash Kokate,
Popat Kokate, Bhaskar Surwase, Pintu Bhagwan Cri.Appeal No.224/2017 with Connected Appeals ::
52 ::
Bhalerao, Prashant Bajirao Survase, Balu Madhukar survase, Pappu Madhukar
Survase, Babu Limbaji Kale, Tulshiram Ashok Vidyagar, Satish Rajesaheb Survase,
Balu Vyankat Survase, Sunil Gangaram Survase, Sachin alias Mahadeo Survase etc.
He further testified that, there were other instances as well besides of dispute over a
right of way. This witness was examined to make out a case of motive as well. This
witness testified that, the car involved in the incident was driven by appellant Babu in
the village and other respondents used to sit therein and roam in the village by
rotation. His evidence as regards conspiracy i.e. meeting held by these respondents at
Veterinary Hospital at Neknoor is based on hear-say. He had learnt the same from
witness Digambar Hade (P.W.22). It, therefore, cannot be said that the evidence of
this witness furthered the prosecution case to make out an offence of conspiracy to
commit murder.
49. P.W.21 Mohan testified that, on 12/3/2013, i.e. about a week before the incident, he had been to
Swagat Beer Bar to dine. In the neighbouring cabin in the hotel, some people were sitting and
talking loudly under the influence of Cri.Appeal No.224/2017 with Connected Appeals :: 53 ::
liquor. He further testified that, those persons were saying that there was no
alternative than to eliminate Uddhav Surwase. He further testified that, one of those
persons took a responsibility of everything i.e. defend in the Court of law to the one
who would eliminate Uddhav. He then testified that, he peeped in the cabin to see
that those were the respondents namely Prakash, Popat, Sugriv, Chandrasen,
Bhaskar and some others. He even identified them before the Court. On behalf of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72310340/ 26
Balu S/O. Limbaji Kale vs The State Of Maharashtra on 3 January, 2025
some of the respondents, the presence of this witness in the hotel and even in the
cabin (No.10) has been admitted during cross-examination. This witness was,
however, confronted with his police statement, which is silent to record therein that
he peeped in the neighbouring cabin. This is vital omission amounts to contradiction.
Needless to mention, all the contradictions or omissions have been duly proved by
the defence by confronting the concerned witnesses and the investigating officer who
has recorded the statements.
50. The conduct of this witness, however, indicates that, although he informed the same to Uddhav,
who laughed it off, he did not prefer to intimate the same to the police nor did Cri.Appeal
No.224/2017 with Connected Appeals :: 54 ::
Uddhav feel to do so. The statement of this witness was recorded on 8/4/2013 i.e. 19
days after the incident.
51. Then comes P.W.22 Digambar Hade. It is in his evidence that, before the incident, he had been
to weekly market at village Neknoor. According to him, he witnessed a meeting held under a Neem
Tree towards left side of Veterinary Hospital and discussion was going on. As those persons were
from village Kumbhari, he went there. In the said meeting, Sachin Survase, Balu Survase, Popat
Kokate, Sugriv Survase, Chandu Survase, Sunil Survase, Satish Survase etc. were present. Some
other persons were also present. He, however, could not name them. After taking a pause, he
pointed out towards the person sitting in the last row in the east corner and said that Prakash
Kokate was also present. All these persons were sitting together. According to him, Chndu
(Chandrakant) said, "Unless Uddhav is finished, the villagers will not be happy. Respondents Popat,
Prakash and Bandu took the responsibility to defend in Courts of law the one who would come
forward and eliminate Uddhav.
Cri.Appeal No.224/2017 with Connected Appeals :: 55 ::
52. This witness could not give the day, date and time by which he had seen these respondents
sitting at Neem Tree near Veterinary Hospital at Neknoor on weekly bazar day. He did not approach
the police on his own immediately after having heard about the conspiracy. His statement was
recorded on 25 March (Hade to check) i.e. 5 days after the incident and number of days after alleged
conspiracy was hatched.
53. P.W.25 Ganesh testified that, a month before the incident in question, another incident took
place. That time he was proceeding on his motorbike. It was about 5.00 p.m. He was passing
through the field of Dr. Kalyankar. He saw some persons from village Kumbhari had gathered at a
mango tree. Those persons were Popat Kokate, Bhaskar Survase, Sunil Survase, Satish Survase,
Sachin survase and another 10 to 12 persons which include Bappa Vidyagar, Sudhakar Bhalerao.
However, he did not remember names of all other persons. He identified them before the Court.
Cri.Appeal No.224/2017 with Connected Appeals :: 56 ::
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72310340/ 27
Balu S/O. Limbaji Kale vs The State Of Maharashtra on 3 January, 2025
54. This witness only speaks about having seen these respondents together at a particular place. He
did not claim to have heard anything being discussed by these persons as a plan to eliminate
Uddhav. P.W.26 Chandrakant is a last witness on the point of conspiracy. He testified that, one day
before the incident i.e. on19 March, a party was held in the field of one Babruwan Surwase. He was
proceeding from that field. It was 6.00 p.m. he saw respondents Chandrasen, Popat, Prakash and
Sachin besides 7 others sitting together there.
55. This witness too did not claim to have heard talk among these persons with regard to eliminating
Uddhav. As such, nothing was deposed to by P.W.25 and P.W.26 regarding alleged hatching of
conspiracy. Section 10 of the Evidence Act, therefore, could not be invoked.
56. As observed above, that it is very easy to allege a case of conspiracy but difficult to prove the
same. in the case in hand, appreciation of the evidence of the witnesses referred to hereinabove lead
us to infer the prosecution to have failed to Cri.Appeal No.224/2017 with Connected Appeals :: 57 ::
make out an offence of conspiracy to commit murder and the murder to be the
fall-out thereof.
57. In the case of Ganesh Bhavan Patel (supra), it has been observed :
"Although in an appeal form an order of acquittal the powers of the High Court to
reassess the evidence and reach its own conclusions are as extensive as in an appeal
against an order of conviction, yet, as a rule of prudence, it should always give proper
weight and consideration to such matters as (1) the views of the trial Judge as to the
credibility of the witnesses; (2) the presumption of innocence in favour of the
accused, a presumption certainly not weakened by the fact that he has been acquitted
at the trial; (3) the right of the accused to the benefit of any doubt; and (4) the
slowness of an appellate Court in disturbing a finding of fact arrived at by a Judge
who had the advantage of seeing the witnesses. Where two reasonable conclusions
can be drawn on the evidence on record, the High Court should, as a matter of
judicial caution, refrain from interfering with the order of acquittal recorded by the
Court below. In other words, if the main grounds on which the Court below has based
its order acquitting accused, are reasonable and plausible, and cannot be entirely and
effectively dislodged, or demolished, the High Court should not disturb the
acquittal.".
58. In the sequel, the appeals against acquittal fail. With this, the following order is passed.
Cri.Appeal No.224/2017 with Connected Appeals :: 58 ::
