3. Attention has been drawn towards the para nos. 10 and 11 of the impugned order dated 23.7.2024
passed by the District Magistrate, Amethi whereby the grounds which have been taken by the High
Court in the order dated 9.8.2000 have been indicated and in para no. 11, it has been specifically
indicated that the order of the High Court dated 9.8.2000 is erroneous.
4. Further attention has been drawn towards annexure-14 which is a judgement and order dated
29.8.2014 passed by the Division Bench of this Court in Special Appeal No. 83 of 2001 (State of U.P.
vs. Kanhaiya Lal and others) dismissing the appeal of the State wherein the order dated 9.8.2000

5. Therefore, it is clear that the order of the High Court dated 9.8.2000 had attained finality on
5.5.2023, more particularly, before passing the impugned order dated 23.7.2024 and in that
situation, the observation of the District Magistrate, Amethi to the effect that the order dated
9.8.2000 of the High Court is erroneous, is prima facie a contemptuous observation.
6. Therefore, the District Magistrate, Amethi is directed to file a personal affidavit by the next date
of listing and shall appear in person on the next date to explain the aforesaid observation being
given in the impugned order dated 23.7.2024.
7. An appropriate order may be passed on the next date after considering the personal affidavit of
the District Magistrate, Amethi.
8. List this case on 27.09.2024 as fresh.
9. Learned Standing Counsel shall intimate this order to the District Magistrate, Amethi
telephonically, e-mode or any other speedier options available within three working days for its
strict compliance."
3. Today, Ms. Nisha Anant, District Magistrate, Amethi is present in person along with her personal
affidavit, same is taken on record.
4. In the aforesaid personal affidavit the authority has tendered unconditional apology by
submitting that it was not her intention to make any observation undermining the Majesty of the
Court or to flout any direction being issued by the constitutional Court but due to inadvertence the
aforesaid observation has been made.
5. She has submitted that she will revisit the order and pass fresh order, therefore, her apology may
be accepted.
6. Considering the personal affidavit and submission of District Magistrate, Amethi, her apology is
accepted and no order would be passed against her which may affect her in future, having
expectation that a fresh order strictly in accordance with law shall be passed in conformity with the
orders being passed by the Apex Court and this Court.
7. List this case in the week commencing 21.10.2024.
8. By the next date of listing a supplementary counter affidavit shall be filed by the opposite parties
enclosing therewith the order, if any, passed in compliance of the aforesaid order.
9. The District Magistrate, who is present in person need not appear again."

Dargahi Singh vs State Of U.P. Thru. Addl. Chief Secy. ... on 4 February, 2025
of the order dated 27.09.2024, an order has been passed on 17.10.2024.
4. Learned Standing Counsel has submitted that the said order has also been placed before the Court
in Writ - A No.7881 of 2024. Now the order dated 17.10.2024 which has been passed in compliance
of orders passed in Writ - A No.7881 of 2024, is challenged in the present writ petition. Since the
earlier petition is pending and by earlier order, this Court has directed that the order be produced
before the Court in Writ - A No.78781 of 2024. The proper course for the petitioner was to amend
the pleading of the Writ - A No.7881 of 2024 and challenge the order which has been passed now
and not by means of the present writ petition since the Court has taken cognizance of the matter in
earlier writ petition.
5. In view of this, the writ petition is disposed of with liberty to the petitioner to challenge the order
in pending Writ - A No.7881 of 2024.
