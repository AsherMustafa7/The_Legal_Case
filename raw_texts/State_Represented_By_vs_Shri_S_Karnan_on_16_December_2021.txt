7. The incriminating materials are put to the accused under Sec.313 Cr.P.C. and they denied the
same. The accused have not examined any of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis witnesses or marked
any of documents. Considering all those materials, the trial court acquitted all the accused from all
the charges. Challenging the order of acquittal, the present appeal has been filed before this Court.
8. Heard submissions of both the learned counsel appearing for appellant and respondents and
perused the material carefully.
9. A1, in this case was the Sub-Inspector of Police, in Koovathur Police Station, who has conducted
the investigation about the accident. A2 is father of deceased. A3 is brother of deceased. P.W.1
Mariappan, who turned as approver, is the owner-cum-driver of the lorry bearing Regn. No.TN-04
B-1656. It is the case of prosecution that the deceased riding IN a two wheeler, dashed against
stationery lorry, bearing Regn. No.MSV-8007 and died. Thereafter, all the accused conspired
together and in furtherance of the conspiracy, they have approached P.W.1, and convinced him to
falsely implicate himself as accused in the said road accident as if his lorry was involved in the
accident, enabling him to gt compensation. Accepting their request, PW.1 has admitted his guilt and
paid fine. Thereafter, he https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis appeared before the Judicial Magistrate
and given a statement under Sec.164(1) Cr.P.C., wherein he has stated that, his lorry was not
involved in the accident, and he was compelled to implicate himself as accused in this case, pardon
was granted to him and he was treated as approver.
10. The prosecution mainly relying upon the statement of P.W.1 (approver) and implicated all the
accused for the above said offence. The accident was taken place on 21.12.2001. Immediately A1
rushed to scene of occurrence, and commenced investigation, and conducted inquest, in which,
registration number of P.W.1's lorry has been mentioned, and clearly stated that while deceased
overtaking a stationery lorry, P.W.1's lorry came in the opposite direction and dashed against the
deceased. According to P.W.1, A2 and A3 approached him in the month of January 2002, during
Pongal festival and asked him to implicate himself in the accident. Only thereafter, he admitted his
guilt and paid the fine. Even though some of the witnesses present during the inquest, disowned
their signature, the trial court has held that the prosecution did not conduct any investigation to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/159480730/ 4
State Represented By vs Shri S.Karnan on 16 December, 2021
compare their signature by sending it to the expert. That apart, it is not the case of
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis prosecution that fine amount has been paid by A2 and A3, it is
only P.W.1, who has paid the fine amount on his own, which creates some suspicion. The Trial
Court, considering all those materials, came to a conclusion that, the evidence of P.W.1, approver is
not trustworthy and it cannot be relied upon.
11. So far as other witnesses are concerned, P.W.2 and 3, who are said to be the eye-witnesses to the
occurrence. Even though both of them were available at the time of accident, from their evidence, it
could be seen that they are not eye-witnesses to the occurrence and both of them have admitted that
after hearing the noise, they came out and saw that bike was lying under the stationery lorry. In the
said circumstances, the trial court come to a conclusion that P.W.2 and 3 are not eye-witnesses to
the occurrence, and their evidence cannot be considered to hold that the deceased dashed against
stationery lorry. Even though P.W.2 and 3 have stated that at the time of accident, there was no
other vehicle plying in that road, to substantiate the same, the prosecution has not taken any steps
to collect the particulars regarding vehicle passing through the scene of
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis occurrence at the time of accident. So far as conspiracy theory is
concerned, absolutely there is no materials available on record to show that A1, who is Inspector of
Police has conspired with A2 and A3 and created false records, thereby committed the offence.
Apart from that, the trial court after considering materials, has held that the prosecution has failed
to establish how the accident has taken place. The Trial Court after considering all those materials
extensively came to a conclusion that, the prosecution had failed to prove the charges levelled
against the accused and consequently acquitted all the accused.
12. It is settled principal of law that, after securing an order of acquittal, there is double presumption
occurred in favour of the accused. Firstly, the fundamental principle of criminal justice delivery
system that, every person, accused of committing an offence shall be presumed to be innocent,
unless their guilt is proved by a competent Court of law. Secondly if the accused has secured an
order of acquittal, the presumption of their innocence is reaffirmed and strengthened by the trial
Court. Even if two reasonable conclusions are possible on the basis of evidence on record, the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis appellate Court should not disturb the finding of the acquittal
recorded by the trial Court.
13. The Trial Court after considering the entire evidence, both oral and documentary extensively,
came to a conclusion that the prosecution failed to prove the charges and acquitted the accused. In
the above circumstances, I find no illegality or perversity in the judgment of the trial Court and there
is no reason to interfere with the order of acquittal passed by the trial Court. Hence, the appeal fails
and the same is deserves to be dismissed.
14. In the result, the Criminal Appeal is dismissed. The judgment of the trial Court in C.C.No.3 of
2008 dated 17.05.2012 is hereby confirmed.
