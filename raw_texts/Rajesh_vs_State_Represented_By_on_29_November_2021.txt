12. This Court enquired PWs 1 to 3, the injured victims and they have submitted that in order to
effect peace and harmony in the village, at the instance of elders and well wishers of both the
communities, they had entered into the compromise and now they are living peacefully in the
village.
13. This Court is aware that the appellants are convicted for offences which are non-compoundable
and in such circumstance it would not be proper to compound the offences which are non-
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis compoundable ignoring the statutory provisions. However, in
several matters, the Hon'ble Apex Court as well as this Court had held that the voluntarily
compromise entered into between the parties can be taken as the relevant factor for consideration of
quantum of sentence.
14. The Hon'ble Apex Court in a recent decision in Shankar and Others v. State of Maharashtra and
Another MANU/SC/0334/2019 : (2019) 5 SCC 166 : LNINDU 2019 SC 73, by referring to various
earlier decisions, taking into consideration the compromise between the parties in non
compoundable offences and had reduced the sentences. It would be relevant to refer to the following
paragraphs of the above judgment:
"9. The appellants have filed a memo of compromise stating therein that they have
compromised the matter with the second respondent Namdeo (complainant). Mr.
Shakul R. Ghatole, learned counsel appearing for the second respondent has stated
that the second respondent Namdeo (complainant) is an aged person and he has
reconciled with his brother Appellant 1, Shankar Harale and voluntarily entered into
compromise and submitted that the said compromise be taken into consideration.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 1 0 . In Ishwar Singh v. State of M.P. [Ishwar Singh
v. State of M.P. MANU/SC/8126/2008 : (2008) 15 SCC 667 : (2009) 3 SCC (Cri)
1153], this Court held that in a non-compoundable offence the compromise between
the parties is a relevant factor to be taken into consideration in considering the
quantum of sentence. In paras 13 and 14 of Ishwar Singh [Ishwar Singh v. State of
M.P., MANU/SC/8126/2008 : (2008) 15 SCC 667 : (2009) 3 SCC (Cri) 1153] it was
held as under:
(SCC p. 670)
13. In Jetha Ram v. State of Rajasthan [Jetha Ram v.
State of Rajasthan MANU/SC/2586/2005 : (2006) 9 SCC 255 : (2006) 2 SCC (Cri) 561], Murugesan
v. Ganapathy Velar [Murugesan v. Ganapathy Velar MANU/SC/2358/2000 : (2001) 10 SCC 504 :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/36700579/ 6
Rajesh vs State Represented By on 29 November, 2021
2003 SCC (Cri) 1032] and Ishwarlal v. State of M.P. [Ishwarlal v. State of M.P. (2008) 15 SCC 671 :
(2009) 3 SCC (Cri) 1156] this Court, while taking into account the fact of compromise between the
parties, reduced sentence imposed on the appellant-accused to already undergone, though the
offences were not compound- https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis able. But it was also stated that in
Mahesh Chand v. State of Rajasthan [Mahesh Chand v. State of Rajasthan MANU/SC/0268/1988 :
1990 Supp SCC 681 : 1991 SCC (Cri) 159] such offence was ordered to be compounded."
14. In our considered opinion, it would not be appropriate to order compounding of an offence not
compoundable under the Code ignoring and keeping aside statutory provisions. In our judgment,
however, limited submission of the learned counsel for the appellant deserves consideration that
while imposing substantive sentence, the factum of compromise between the parties is indeed a
relevant circumstance which the Court may keep in mind."
15. In the recent decision in Murali vs. State (2021) 1 SCC 726, the Apex Court has held that the fact
of amicable settlement/compromise between the parties can be a relevant factor for the purpose of
reduction in quantum of sentence of convicts even in serious non-compoundable offences.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
16. In view of the above, the Criminal Appeal is partly allowed and while the conviction and the
sentences of fine imposed on the appellants for the above said offences are confirmed, the sentence
of imprisonment imposed upon them for the said offence alone is modified and reduced to the
period already undergone. The appellants need not surrender. The fine amount shall be paid to the
Legal Services Authority of the Court concerned. The connected Miscellaneous Petition is closed.
