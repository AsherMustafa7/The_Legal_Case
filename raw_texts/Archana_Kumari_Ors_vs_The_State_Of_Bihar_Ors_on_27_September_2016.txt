JUDGMENT & ORDER
C.A.V.
(Per: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE CHAKRADHARI
SHARAN SINGH)
Date: 27-09-2016
Since all these appeals, under Clause 10 of the
Letters Patent of this Court, arise out of the same selection
process, held by the Central Selection Board (Constable
Recruitment) (hereinafter referred to as "the Selection
Board"), pursuant to Advertisement No. 01 of 2014, for
appointments to 11,783 posts of Constables, which is under
challenge on common grounds, all these appeals have been
heard together, with the consent of the parties, and are being
disposed of by the present common judgment and order.
2. By the judgment and order, under challenge,
Patna High Court LPA No.92 of 2016 26
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76290793/ 18
Archana Kumari & Ors vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 27 September, 2016
dated 03.11.2015, passed in C.W.J.C. No. 9918 of 2015, the
learned single Judge has dismissed the writ application, filed
under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, refusing to
interfere with the selection process, in question. Challenge to
the selection process was made on the ground of several
irregularities and large scale bunglings, which, according to
the petitioners, rendered the entire selection process illegal
and void.
3. L.P.A. No. 157 of 2016 has been preferred
against the judgment and order, dated 03.11.2015, passed in
C.W.J.C. No. 9918 of 2015. The other appeals arise out of
various orders, passed by the learned single Judge,
dismissing other writ applications, filed under Article 226 of
the Constitution of India, referring to the main judgment and
order, dated 03.11.2015, aforementioned passed in C.W.J.C.
No. 9918 of 2015.
4. This is in brief, the reason why the matters
have been taken up together and are being disposed of by
the present common judgment and order.
5. Shorn of unnecessary details, the facts,
which are relevant for the present adjudication, are that in
response to a requisition made by the State police
headquarter, for the purpose of filling up of 11,783
Constables in the District Force and Bihar Military Police

Archana Kumari & Ors vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 27 September, 2016
(B.M.P.) Batalians and other Units of Bihar Police, the
Selection Board came out, with Advertisement No. 01 of
2014, inviting applications from the suitable and desirous
candidates. The said advertisement stipulated, inter alia,
that the merit-list of the selected candidates would be
prepared on the basis of performance in the written
examination. It prescribed that the candidates, five times of
the number of vacancies advertised, shall be called for
Physical Test and Measurement and, in the final merit list,
only such candidates shall be included, who were found
successful in the said Physical Test and Measurement. It
clearly indicated that Physical Test and Measurement shall
carry no weightage for preparation of merit list and marks
obtained in the written examination will be the basis for
preparation of merit-list.
6. In the written examination, held on
19.10.2014
, 75,77,63 candidates had participated. The result of written test was published, on 04.02.2015, in
the ratio of 1/5th category-wise vacancies, for appearing in the Screening Test and Physical
Evaluation Test (PET). In this process, 52,715 candidates were declared successful and were called
to appear in the Screening and Physical Evaluation Test.
7. The petitioners of C.W.J.C. No. 10854 of 2015 were declared successful in the written examination
and were, accordingly, called for the Screening and Physical Evaluation Test.
8. On 23.06.2015, 11,464 candidates were declared successful against 11,783 vacancies. The writ
petitioners, who are appellants herein, did not qualify. It appears from the materials available on the
record that in course of examination, some of the candidates were found indulging in unfair means,
who were apprehended. A First Information Report was registered against such candidates alleging
commission of offences punishable under Sections 417, 419 and 420 read with Section 34 of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76290793/ 20
Archana Kumari & Ors vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 27 September, 2016
Indian Penal Code.
9. The appellants approached this Court by filing writ applications, including C.W.J.C. No. 10854 of
2015, questioning the validity of the process of selection, on the following grounds, which are being
taken from the pleadings in the writ application in C.W.J.C. No. 10854 of 2015, paragraph Nos. 16
and 17 of which read thus:-
"16. That, it is stated, in this regard, that the authorities, before publication of result,
didn't care on many essential/important aspects, without which entire conduct of
authorities during the entire selection process appear arbitrary, of which :
iii. No cut-off marks nor any merit-list as referred to in the result dated 23.06.2015
has been published;
iv. Neither the marks obtained by the successful/selected candidates nor that of the
unsuccessful candidates, including the petitioners, have anywhere been published or
supplied.
v. As such, the petitioners till date are not even aware as to what was the minimum
cut-off marks for preparing the merit-list of their respective categories and what is
the marks obtained by them.
vi. Moreover, before issuance of appointment letter, no medical check-up has been
made mandatory, which in itself is arbitrary.
17. That, moreover, the selection process, in its entirety, suffered with various
discrepancies at different stages viz. Written Examiantion, Screening Test and
Physical Efficiency Test (PET), which are as follows:
i. At the time of written examination, several candidates, who were indulged in
malpractice, were arrested. Moreover, some of the newspapers have also reported
that question paper of Written Examination was leaked.
ii. At the time of Screening Test, about 5000 candidates were detected to have been
indulged in unfair practices/means as also some didn't sit in the examination rather
scholars/experts appeared at their place. Some FIRs are also reported to have been
lodged against such candidates.
iii. Even, in the Physical Efficiency Test (PET), some of the experts/athletes were
arrested, who were found running in place of some of the candidates.
iv. This was not all and immediately prior to the publication of result, an First Information Report
bearing Gardanibagh P.S. Case No. 226 of 2015 dated 22.06.2015 against 811 candidates, punishable
u/s. 417/419/420/34 of the Indian Penal Code have also been lodged.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76290793/ 21
Archana Kumari & Ors vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 27 September, 2016
Therefore, before publication of result, admittedly, large number of bungling had taken place but
proper enquiry/investigation, in this regard, has not been held."
10. As has been noticed above, learned single Judge dismissed the writ application by judgment and
order, dated 03.11.2015, passed in C.W.J.C. No. 9918 of 2015, upon arriving at a conclusion that the
allegations, levelled in the writ application, could not be made out and the respondent-authorities
have been able to identify and weed out the candidates, who had indulged in adopting unfair means,
in one way or the other.
11. Almost identical grounds were taken in other writ applications, which met the same fate and
their claims also came to be rejected by judgments and orders, which are under appeal.
12. We have heard Mr. Rajendra Prasad Singh, learned Senior Counsel, appearing on behalf of the
appellants, and Mr. Lalit Kishore, learned Principal Additional Advocate General No.-I, appearing
on behalf of the respondents-State of Bihar.
13. Mr. Rajendra Prasad Singh, learned Senior Counsel, appearing on behalf of the appellants, while
making his leading arguments on their behalf, has submitted that considering large scale
irregularities, detected by the Selection Board in the course of holding written examination, the
selection process lost its sanctity and, therefore, the entire selection process deserves to be declared
illegal and void. He has placed strong reliance on Supreme Court's decision, in case of Veerendra Kr.
Gautam & Ors. Vs. Karuna Nidhan Upadhyay & Ors., reported in JT 2016 (7) SC 367, and has
contended that since the entire process of selection is apparently tainted with mala fide, large scale
bunglings and manipulations in different shapes, which have been detected in the course of written
examination, the selection process should be set aside. He has also submitted that once the selection
procedure has been found to be tainted, as is evident from the facts of the present cases, the entire
selection process deserved to be declared illegal and unsustainable.
14. Mr. Lalit Kishore, learned Principal Additional Advocate General No.-I, countering the attack
made on behalf of the appellants, has straightway taken us to a Division Bench decision of this
Court, in case of Moni & Ors. Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors., reported in 2016 (2) PLJR 598, to
contend that the same process of selection was put to challenge on almost identical grounds in a
Public Interest Litigation and this Court, while dismissing the writ applications, on the ground of
being not maintainable by way of Public Interest Litigation, observed, in paragraph 10 of the said
decision, thus:-
"10. Upon perusal of the materials on record and considering the submissions
advanced on behalf of the parties, we have noticed that the petitioners are seeking
cancellation of the selection process mainly on the plea that the State-respondents
have taken various action against many of the candidates, who were found using
unfairmeans in the process of selection. This, in our considered view, cannot be a
ground for interference with the process of selection;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76290793/ 22
Archana Kumari & Ors vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 27 September, 2016
rather, it shows that the authorities were vigilant, because of which the discrepancies
and malpractices could be detected."
15. Mr. Lalit Kishore, learned Principal Additional Advocate General No.-I, has next relied on a
Supreme Court's decision, in case of Sadananda Halo & Ors. Vs. Momtaz Ali Sheikh and Ors.,
reported in (2008) 4 Supreme Court Cases 619, and has submitted that learned single Judge by the
judgment and order, under appeal, has rightly dismissed the writ applications as there is no material
irregularity or illegality, which can be said to have been committed in the process of selection,
rendering entire selection process illegal. It is his submission that there is no allegation of any mala
fide against the Members of the Selection Board nor agaisnt the persons involved in the process of
selection. He has, accordingly, submitted that it is not the case of the appellants that any candidate,
who secured marks less than what the appellants had secured in the written examination, has been
selected.
16. In the background of the facts, as recorded above and the submissions advanced on behalf of the
parties, which have been taken note of, we are required to consider as to whether there exists
sufficient reason, on the basis of pleadings on record, that because of the irregularities as alleged by
the appellants in the process of selection, the selection process should be held to be, as a whole,
illegal and the entire process of selection should be set aside on that ground.
17. Be it noted that the allegations relate to irregularities committed during the written examination.
The written examination was held on 09.10.2014. None of the appellants/writ-petitioners raised any
objection over the alleged irregularities committed in the course of the written examination. The
result of the written test was published on 04.02.2015. Only after they found themselves
unsuccessful in the said written test that they challenged the said result on the ground of
illegalities/irregularities committed during the written test. They apparently waited for the final
result of the written test to be published and once the result was published, they approached this
Court, under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, seeking quashing of the entire result.
18. We are of the view that the appellants, having failed to raise any objection before publication of
the result and having taken a chance by waiting till publication of the result under the hope that they
might be successful, they cannot, now, be allowed to turn around and challenge the process of
selection itself.
19. Secondly, Mr. Lalit Kishore, learned Principal Additional Advocate General No.-I, has rightly
referred to our decision in case of Moni (supra), wherein we have held that the process of selection
cannot be cancelled on the plea that the State-respondents had taken various action against many of
the candidates, who were found using unfair means in the process of selection. We held in the said
decision that such actions, taken by the State-respodnents, were indicative of the fact that the
authorities were vigilant and it was because of such vigilance that the discrepancies and
malpractices could be detected. We reiterate that the said decision is in respect of the same selection
process conducted by the Selection Board.

Archana Kumari & Ors vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 27 September, 2016
20. The decision of the Supreme Court in case of Veerendra Kr. Gautam (supra) has no application
in the facts and circumstances of the present batch of cases and is clearly distinguishable for the
simple reason that in Veerendra Kr. Gautam (supra), there were specific allegations made against
selected candidates showing palpable irregularities and illegalities committed by them. In the
present batch of cases, more than 7,00,000 candidates had participated in the process of the
selection and, finally, more than 11,000 candidates have been declared successful;
yet there is no allegation or whishper of mala fide or bias against the Members of the Selection
Board or the persons involved otherwise in the process of selection.
21. There always exists presumption in regard to correctness of an official act and in the absence of
any allegation of favouritism, mala fide or bias, the selection process cannot be held to be
unsustainable on the basis that several candidates were detected to be involved in adopting unfair
means, while appearing at the written examination.
22. We, accordingly, do not find any legal or factual infirmity in the judgments and orders, under
appeal.
23. These appeals are, accordingly, dismissed being devoid of any merit.
24. Parties shall bear their own costs.
