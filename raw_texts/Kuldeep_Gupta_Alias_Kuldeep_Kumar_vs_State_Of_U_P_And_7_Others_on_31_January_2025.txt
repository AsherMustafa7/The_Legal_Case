3. It has been submitted by learned counsel for the applicant that impugned order is against facts
and law and thus liable to be set aside. The private opposite parties were summoned by the learned
Magistrate vide summoning order dated 22.03.2021. The private opposite parties have filed an
application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. against that order, which was allowed vide order dated
27.09.2022 and the summoning order was quashed and matter was remanded back to the learned
Magistrate. Thereafter, the complaint was dismissed under Section 203 CrPC vide impugned order
dated 19.07.2024. It was submitted that the private opposite parties have filed an application for
discharge before the trial Court on 17.08.2022 and the aforesaid application under Section 482
Cr.P.C. No.31223 of 2022 was filed by concealing that fact. Referring to facts of the matter, it was
submitted that a prima-facie case is made out against the applicants.
4. Learned A.G.A. has opposed the application and submitted that there is no illegality or perversity
in the impugned order.
5. I have considered the rival submissions and perused the record.
6. Before proceeding further, it would be expedient to go through the provisions as enunciated
under Sections 203 and 204 Cr.P.C., which reads as under :-
Section 203 Cr.P.C.
"Dismissal of complaint- If, after considering the statements on oath (if any) of the
complainant and of the witnesses and the result of the inquiry or investigation (if
any) under section 202, the Magistrate is of opinion that there is no sufficient ground
for proceeding, he shall dismiss the complaint, and in every such case he shall briefly
record his reasons for so doing,"
Section 204 Cr.P.C.
"204.Issue of process. (1) If in the opinion of a Magistrate taking cognizance of an
offence there is sufficient ground for proceeding, and the case appears to be-
(a) a summons-case, he shall issue his summons for the attendance of the accused, or
(b) a warrant-case, he may issue a warrant, or, if he thinks fit, a summons, for
causing the accused to be brought or to appear at a certain time before such
Magistrate or (if he has no jurisdiction himself) some other Magistrate having
jurisdiction."
7. Thus, it is clear that as per the procedure prescribed for proceedings with regard to the complaint
case after recording the statements of the complainant and witnesses and the result of the inquiry or
investigation (if any) under section 202 Cr.P.C., if the Magistrate is of the opinion that there is no
sufficient ground for proceeding exist and he may dismiss the complaint. It is well settled that if a
bare perusal of a complaint or the evidence led in support of it shows that essential ingredients of

the offence alleged are absent or that the dispute is only a civil nature or that there are such patent
absurdities in evidence produced that it would be a waste of time to proceed further, the complaint
could be properly dismissed under Section 203, Criminal Procedure Code.
8. What the Magistrate had to determine at the stage of issue of process was not the correctness of
the probability or improbability of individual items of evidence on disputable grounds, but the
existence or otherwise of a prima facie case on the assumption that what was stated could be true
unless the prosecution allegations were so fantastic that they could not reasonably be held to be
true.
9. In S.N. Palanitkar v. State of Bihar and another, AIR 2001 SC 12960 while examining the scope of
section 203 of Code of Criminal Procedure Code, the Hon'ble Apex Court in paragraphs 15, 16 and 17
has held as under :
"15. In case of a complaint under Section 200, Cr.P.C. or IPC a Magistrate can take
cognizance of the offence made out and then has to examine the complainant and the
witnesses, if any, to ascertain whether a prima facie case is made out against the
accused to issue process so that the issue of process is prevented on a complaint
which is either false or vexatious or intended only to harass. Such examination is
provided in order to find out whether there is or not sufficient ground for proceeding.
The words 'sufficient ground' used under Section 202 have to be construed to mean
the satisfaction that a prima facie case is made out against the accused and not
sufficient ground for the purpose of conviction.
16. This Court in Nirmaljit Singh Hoon v. The State of West Bengal and others,
(1993)(3)SCC 753), in para 22, referring to scheme of Sections 200-203 of Cr.P.C. has
explained that "The section does not say that a regular trial of adjudging truth or
otherwise of the person complained against should take place at that stage, for, such
a person can be called upon to answer the accusation made against him only when a
process has been issued and he is on trial. Section 203 consists of two parts. The first
part lays down the materials which the Magistrate must consider, and the second
part says that if after considering those materials there is in his judgment not
sufficient ground for proceeding, he may dismiss the complaint. In Chandra Deo
Singh v. Prakash Chandra Bose (1964 (1)SCR 639) where dismissal of a complaint by
the Magistrate at the stage of Section 2092 inquiry was set aside, this Court laid down
that the test was whether there was sufficient ground for proceeding and not whether
there was sufficient ground for conviction, and observed (p.653) that where there was
prima facie evidence, even though the person charged of an offence in the complaint
might have a defence, the matter had to be left to be decided by the appropriate
forum at the appropriate stage and issue a process could not be refused. Unless,
therefore, the Magistrate finds that the evidence led before him is self-contradictory,
or intrinsically untrustworthy, process cannot be refused if that evidence makes out a
prima facie case."

17. In Smt. Nagawwa v. Veeranna Shivalingappa Kongalgi (1976(3) SCC 736) this Court dealing with
the scope of inquiry under Section 202 has stated that it is extremely limited only to the
ascertainment of the truth or falsehood of the allegations made in the complaint (a) on the materials
placed by the complainant before the Court (b) for the limited purpose of finding out whether a
prima facie case for issue of process has been made out; (C) for deciding the question purely from
the point of view of the complainant without at all adverting to any defence that the accused may
have. It is also indicated by way of illustration in which cases an order of the Magistrate issuing
process can be quashed on such case being "where the allegations made in the complaint or the
statements of the witnesses recorded in support of the same taken at their face value make out
absolutely no case against the accused or the complaint does not disclose the essential ingredients of
an offence which is alleged against the accused."
10. Considering above-stated position of law, in the instant case perusal of record shows that
applicant is husband of opposite party no.2 and remaining private opposite parties are family
members of opposite party no.2. Thus, the impugned complaint has been lodged by the applicant
against his wife, brother-in-law and other family members of his wife. The allegations made in the
complaint are that on 21.04.2018 on the occasion of birthday of complainant, the said opposite
parties have committed theft of jewellery and cash of Rs.42,000/- from the house of applicant.
Apparently, the allegations are suffering from vice of improbability and it can not be believed that
the wife of applicant along with her entire family members would indulge in commission of such
incident of theft. It appears that there is matrimonial dispute between the parties and the complaint
was filed by the applicant in order to settle score in matrimonial dispute. The complaint has been
dismissed by the learned Magistrate by following the observations made by this Court vide order
dated 27.09.2022 passed in Application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. No.31223 of 2022. Considering
allegations of complaint and statement of complainant and of witnesses and all attending facts, this
Court does not find any such material illegality or abuse of process in the impugned order so as to
require any interference by this Court by invoking extraordinary power under Section 482 Cr.P.C.
The application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. lacks merits and thus, liable to be dismissed.
11. Accordingly, the application u/s 482 Cr.P.C. is dismissed.
