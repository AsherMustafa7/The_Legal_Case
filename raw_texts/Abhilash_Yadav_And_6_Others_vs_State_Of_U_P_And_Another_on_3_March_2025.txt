3. It is submitted by learned counsel for the applicants that matter relates to matrimonial dispute
between the parties. The applicant no. 1 is husband of opposite party no. 2 and applicant nos. 2 and
7 are family members of applicant no. 1. The opposite party no. 2 has lodged one more case vide
complaint Case No. 3162 of 2019, under Sections 427, 323, 354(Kha) I.P.C. and in that case, matter
was referred for mediation by this Court vide order dated 18.09.2019 passed in Application under
Section 482 No.- 33966 of 2019. During mediation proceedings, both the parties have amicably
settled their all disputes and agreed to withdraw the cases lodged against each other. Learned
counsel has referred mediation report, wherein it has been mentioned that both the parties shall
withdraw the cases, including the present case crime no. 0841 of 2019.
4. It was submitted that in view of the aforesaid facts, no useful purpose would be served by keeping
the impugned proceedings pending and thus, the impugned proceedings may be quashed on the
basis of compromise arrived at between the parties.
5. Learned A.G.A. has no objection if parties compromise the matter.
6. I have considered the submissions and perused the record.
7. It is well settled that in appropriate cases criminal proceedings may be quashed on the basis of
compromise. In the instant case, it appears that matter relates to matrimonial dispute, which is
private in nature. During mediation proceedings, both the parties have amicably settled the dispute
and compromised the matter. If parties compromise the matter, it would not have adverse impact
on society. There is nothing to indicate that parties have any criminal antecedents. Considering the
law laid down in the case of State of Madhya Pradesh Vs. Laxmi Narayan and others, AIR 2019 SC
1296 and the facts of the matter, it would be in the interest of justice that the impugned proceedings
be quashed.
8. In view of the aforesaid, the impugned charge sheet, cognizance order and entire proceedings of
the aforesaid case against applicants, namely, Abhilash Yadav, Smt. Maya Devi, Smt. Nisha @ Priya
Yadav, Smt. Neetu, Chandra Prakash, Smt. Gunjan Yadav and Pankaj Yadav are, hereby, quashed.
9. The application u/s 482 Cr.P.C. is allowed.
