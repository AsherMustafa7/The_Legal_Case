the Director of the Company when the offence was committed as per the particulars filed in the
office of the complainant and he is an 'officer in default' within the meaning of the Sec.2(60) of the
Act 2013, for the reason that the complainant has received a complaint dated 12.12.20217 from Shri
R.Narayanan, Shri S.Rajarathinam and Shri T.S.Raghavan against M/S/Viswapriya (India) Ltd for
non-filing of DIR-12, which is in contravention of the provisions of Section 168 of the Companies
Act 2013. In pursuance of the said complaint, he issued notice on 27.12.2017 under Section 206(1) of
the Companies Act and sought explanation from the Company along with supporting documents.

the non-receipt of reply from the company, the complainant issued another notice dated 19.01.2018
under Section206(3) of the Act to the company to furnish an explanation. For that also though
notice was received, no reply was received from the accused and therefore, the said matter was
reported to https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.No.21245 of The Regional Director by the
complainant, vide its letter dated 27.02.2018. In response to this The Regional Director launched
prosecution under section 206(1) and 206(3) of Companies Act, 2013 for non-compliance.

proceedings, on the ground that the Economic Offence Court-1 has mechanically taken cognizance
of the complaint without any application of mind and without even the documents set-out in the
complaints being appeared by the complainant, as there is nothing on record to make our even a
prima facie evidence, The lower Court has also failed to note that the case in the complaint itself sets
out that the alleged resignation of the three persons who are Directors of Viswapriaya (India)
Limited was in the year 2013 whereas the provisions of Section 206(1) of the Companies Act, 2013
were not attract and as such no offence thereunder can at all arise in respect of offence claimed
thereof in the year 2013 and the Court in the intrans case was not notified as a
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.No.21245 of Special Court under Section 435 of
Companies Act 2013 and as such it had no jurisdiction whatsoever to try any offence under
Companies Act, 2013.
