ORDER
This writ petition has been filed seeking for declaration to declare that the proceedings of the
Deputy Superintendent of Police, Melur Sub Division, Madurai District, dated 16.04.2013 in
C.No.67/Pro./SDO.MLR/13 in ordering the opening of a History Sheet against the petitioner and its
retention till date, is illegal and issue a consequential direction to remove the name of the petitioner
from the history sheet on the file of Melavalavu Police Station, Melur Taluk.
2.The petitioner is an Agriculturist and he has also participated in the Farmers' Grievance Day
meeting conducted by the District Administration. He was also awarded Best Farming Practices in
cultivating Papaya. He was also appointed as a Member of the Fertilizer Vigilance Committee for
Kottampatti Region and also a Member of the Paddy Direct Procurement Centre for the same
region. Apart from this, he is also doing social activities. He also filed several writ petitions before
this court as detailed in the petition concerning and touching upon the public issue, which involved
in reclamation of water bodies and there is continuous fight by this petitioner against one
Kusalavan, who https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis involved in converting the water body and
damaging the water bodies. So because of the continuous fight by this petitioner against the said
Kusalavan, to wreck vengeance, he was falsely implicated in illegal activities. At one time, the
petitioner was also given personal police security. In the meantime, the impugned order has been
initiated against this petitioner by referring to various cases, that have been registered as against
him as set out in the proceedings.
3.The petitioner is not a convict under PSO.748 and for the purpose of retaining the history sheet,
the order of the Superintendent of Police is required. In the meantime, the order has been initiated
by the Deputy Superintendent of Police, which is not valid under law. Similarly for the purpose of
retaining the history sheet, proceedings in PSO.748 must also be followed. Since the history sheet
has been opened in the year 2013, for the purpose of retaining or extending the same also, two years
can be done only under the order of the Officer above the Rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police.
But no such order has been obtained. Challenging the impugned proceedings, this writ petition is
filed for declaration that the proceedings of the Deputy Superintendent of
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Police, Melur, Sub Division, Madurai District, dated 16.04.2013
made in C.No.67/Pro./SDO.MLR/13 by ordering, the opening of a history sheet against the
petitioner and its retention till date is illegal and consequently, directing to remove the name of the
petitioner from the history sheet on the file of Melavalavu Police Station.
4.A counter affidavit has been filed by the respondents.
5.Heard both sides.

6.The petitioner claims that he is a social activist engaged in continuously fight against the persons,
who are involved in damaging the water bodies and etc., as set out in the petition. He has also given
a list of appointments, that have been made by the membership of various Departments, inducting
in the committees. We are not concerned here with regard to those matters.
7.It is a simple matter, which involves legal issue, need not go into the factual issue that has arisen
between the petitioner and the said Kusalavan and various petitions that have been filed seeking
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis various reliefs. Suffice to say that this petition can be entertained,
we can go into the limited point of legality and opening and retaining the history sheet, that has
been opened against the petitioner in 2013.
8.In the counter, it has been stated that the case that has been registered against the petitioner as
detailed and those allegations have been objected by the petitioner. So for the purpose of clarifying
the same, the petitioner was directed to give the particulars of the cases filed against him and the
present stage of the cases, in a tabulation format. That was also filed by the petitioner. So we can
straightway referred to the tabulation filed by the petitioner.
9.The case Crime No.42 of 2012 was registered under sections 147, 294(b), 506(ii) IPC and section 4
of TNWH Act and it was quashed by this court in Crl.OP(MD)No.5440 of 2015, dated 25.03.2015.
The case in Crime No.6 of 2013 was registered under sections 147, 148, 294(b), 323, 324 and 506(ii)
IPC and the matter has been compromised between the parties. The case Crime Nos.13 of 2013, 153
of 2014 and 166 of 2014 have been registered under section 107 of Cr.P.C and due to efflux of time,
they became https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis infructuous. Crime No.34 of 2013, which was
registered for the offence under sections 147, 148, 294(b), 341, 323, 324 and 506(ii) IPC has been
closed as 'Mistake of Fact'. Crime No.11 of 2014 was also closed as 'Mistake of Fact'. The case in
Crime No.62 of 2015, which has been initiated under Section 145 of Cr.P.C was also closed after
RDO enquiry. In the case of Crime No.93 of 2013, even though the petitioner was not arrayed as an
accused, final report has been quashed by this court in Crl.OP(MD)No.21965 of 2013, dated
22.01.2015. Similarly, Crime No.122 of 2013 was registered for the offence under sections 147, 148,
341, 294(b), 323, 324, 506(ii) IPC and Section 4 of TNWH Act, and it has been quashed by this court
in Crl.OP(MD)No.21965 of 2013, dated 22.01.2015. So also Crime No.164 of 2012 has also been
quashed by this court in Crl.OP(MD)No.21965 of 2013, dated 22.01.2015. So these matters have
been disposed of. So far as Crime No.93 of 2013 is concerned, which was initiated under section 107
Cr.P.C, the petitioner name has not been mentioned. But due to efflux of time, it is automatically
terminated. So far as the Crime No.4 of 2013 is concerned, the petitioner is not an accused person
and the Crime No.238 of 2016, which was registered under sections 323, 324 and 506(ii) IPC is
pending on the file of the Sub Court, Melur, in SC No. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 627 of 2017.
10.According to the petitioner, it is a case and counter case. Crime No.39 of 2020 was registered
under sections 147, 148, 294(b), 307, 323, 324, 341, 379, 447 IPC and section 3(2)(v)(a) of SC/ST
Act and now it is pending in Spl. SC No.25 of 2021 before which court is not clear on record.
11.According to the prosecution, Spl.SC No.25 of 2021 is now pending before the III Additional
District Judge, Madurai. Now according to the respondents, the petitioner is also involved in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/27989667/ 3
M.Gopalakrishnan vs The Superintendent Of Police on 29 November, 2021
breaching the public peace and tranquility and caused disturbance to the law and order problem. He
has also involved in filing Public Interest Limitation one after another to mask his anti-social
activities. According to the respondents, most of the cases have been filed against one Kusalavan
and his people. So only for the purpose of maintaining peace, history sheet has been opened against
the petitioner and his movements have been monitored periodically. If the name has been removed
from the history sheet, the public interest will be affected.
12.So in the light of the above contention on the part of the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 3rd
respondent, it narrows down to a single point, whether the continuation of the history sheet that has
been opened against this petitioner is valid under law and supported by proper procedures. Hence,
we need not go into the graduation of the petition in detail. The petitioner straightway relied upon
the order passed in WP(MD)No.2104 of 2018 and WP(MD)No.7546 of 2019, dated 03.07.2020. This
court went into the issue of opening and retaining the history sheet in a detailed manner, by
referring to the earlier order that has been passed by this court, which gave series of instructions
and guidelines to be followed by the police while opening and retaining, extending the history sheet.
Additional guidelines have also been issued. In the impugned proceedings, after a lapse of 8 years
opening of the history sheet questioned in this petition. The order is, dated 16.04.2013 passed by the
Deputy Superintendent of Police, Melur Sub Division, wherein it has been mentioned that this
petitioner is involved in six criminal cases and because of his involvement in the above said six
criminal cases, his activities should be watched closely by opening the history sheet. So the Sub
Inspector of Police, attached to Melavalavu Police Station was directed to open the history sheet
immediately and watching the activities for two years.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
13.It appears that in pursuance of the above said direction, history sheet has been opened in
No.86/2013 on 16.04.2013. Now according to the learned counsel for the petitioner, opening of
history sheet that has been passed by the Deputy Superintendent of Police is without any
jurisdiction and continuation of the same is also without jurisdiction.
14.PSO 748 reads as under:-
“(1)History Sheets shall be closed by the definite orders of an officer of and above the
rank of Assistant Superintendent of Police/Deputy Superintendent of Police and shall
be filed in the Station. The History Sheets of persons who have died shall be
destroyed under orders of an officer of and above the rak of Assistant Superintendent
of Police/Deputy Superintendent of Police. The Superintendent of Police may order
the closure of a History Sheet at any time but a Divisional Officer may only do so on
the expired of the period named above.
(G.O.Ms.No.3929, Home, 5th Sept. 1950) https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis (2)Where
retention of a History Sheet is considered necessary after two years of registration,
orders of an officer of and above the rank of Assistant Superintendent of
Police/Deputy Superintendent of Police must be taken for the extension in the first

instance upto the end of the next December and further annual extensions from
January to December.
(3)The above orders shall apply to Rowdy Sheets also.
15.Reading of the above said PSO shows that for purpose of opening or continuing and extending
the history sheet, proper orders should be obtained from the concerned Superintendent of Police.
But here absolutely there is no record to show that proper orders have been obtained from the
Superintendent of Police concerned. So, I am of the considered view that since there is a violation of
the Police Standing Order, opening and continuing of the history sheet as against this petitioner is
illegal and accordingly, the impugned proceedings is liable to be set aside and it is hereby set aside.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
16.In fine, the writ petition stands allowed. The impugned proceedings of the 2nd respondent, dated
16.04.2013 is hereby set aside. No costs.
