Guruputrappa Sangappa Angadi vs The Special Land Acquisition Officer on 19 November, 2020
This MFA is filed under Section 54(1) of the Land
Acquisition Act against the judgment and award dated
02.06.2012 passed in LAC No.389/2011 on the file of
the Principal Senior Civil Judge, Saundatti, partly
allowing the reference petition under Section 18(1) of
the Land Acquisition Act.
This MFA coming on for Orders this day, the Court
delivered the following:
JUDGMENT
This appeal is filed against the judgment and award dated 02.06.2012 passed by the Principal Senior
Civil Judge, Saundatti, in LAC No.389 of 2011.
2. Land belonging to the appellants, bearing R.S.No.154 situated in Hittanagi village of Saundatti
Taluk, measuring 1 acre 6 guntas was acquired for the purpose of Malaprabha Project by issuing a
preliminary notification dated 05.08.2010 issued under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act (for
short, 'the Act'). The Special Land Acquisition Officer fixed the market value of the land in question
at Rs.42,308/- per acre. The appellants filed a petition under Section 18(1) of the Act for
enhancement of the compensation.
3. The Reference Court fixed the market value of the land in question at Rs.1,80,000/- per acre with
all statutory benefits and interest. Being aggrieved by the same, the claimants have filed this appeal
seeking for enhancement of the compensation.
4. Learned counsel for the appellants submits that the Division Bench of this Court in M.F.A.
No.103439 of 2016, disposed of on 08.01.2018, in respect of the land involved in the said appeal
which is situated in the same village and acquired for the very same purpose under the very same
notification, has fixed the market value at Rs.5,08,000/- per acre with all statutory benefits, interest
and costs. Hence, he prays for fixing the market value of the land involved in this appeal in terms of
the judgment passed in M.F.A. No.103439 of 2016. Learned counsel for the second respondent does
not dispute the same. Therefore, the market value of the land involved in this appeal also requires to
be fixed in terms of the judgment passed by this Court in M.F.A. No.103439 of 2016.
5. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed. The impugned judgment and award of the Reference Court is
modified. The market value of the land in question is fixed at Rs.5,08,000/- per acre with all
statutory benefits, interest and costs. However, the appellants are not entitled to interest for the
delay period of 1894 days in filing the appeal.
The enhanced compensation shall be deposited by the second respondent within six months from
the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
