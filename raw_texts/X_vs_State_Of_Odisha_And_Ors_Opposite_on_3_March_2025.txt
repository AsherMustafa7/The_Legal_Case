X vs State Of Odisha And Ors. .... Opposite ... on 3 March, 2025
2. The brief facts of the case are as follows:
Designation: AR-CUM-SR. SECRETARY Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date:
03-Mar-2025 15:04:42
(i) X was born on 12.06.2011 and is currently a 13-year-old studying in the 7th standard. She belongs
to the Scheduled Tribe community. She suffers from Sickle Cell Anaemia and Epilepsy, both of
which are specified disabilities under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016.
(ii) In August 2024, X was repeatedly raped by one Dinesh Pradhan, son of Dhanurjaya Pradhan,
from village Takinajum Kanbageri, P.S. G Udaygiri, District Kandhamal. Due to threats from the
accused, she did not disclose the assault to her parents or anyone else.
(iii) Her health deteriorated, and she experienced irregular menstrual cycles, body pain, and
abdominal pain. Her mother took her to a doctor, who upon examination, found that she was six
months pregnant. The pregnancy was discovered at a late stage, beyond the 24-week limit
prescribed under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971 ("MTP Act").
(iv) On 11.02.2025, X's mother reported the matter to the police, and an FIR (PS Case No. 28 of
2025) was registered at G. Udaygiri Police Station, Kandhamal, under Section(s)
64(2)(m)/65(1)/351(2) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 read with Section 6 of the POCSO Act,
2012.
(v) A medico-legal examination was conducted on 11.02.2025 by the Medical Officer, PHC(N)
Kalinga, District Kandhamal. The report confirmed X's Sickle Cell Anaemia and Epilepsy.
(vi) On 13.02.2025, X was examined at DHH, Phulbani, where it was confirmed that the pregnancy
had gestated beyond 24 weeks. X is currently admitted at MKCG Medical College, Berhampur,
undergoing Designation: AR-CUM-SR. SECRETARY Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK
Date: 03-Mar-2025 15:04:42 treatment for her pregnancy and disabilities. There, it was advised that
carrying the pregnancy to full term and giving birth would pose a serious risk to X's life due to her:
a) Young age (13 years).
b) Sickle Cell Anaemia and Epilepsy.
c) Physical and mental trauma resulting from the rape.
(vii) In the light of the abovementioned circumstances, the petitioner filed this Writ
Petition seeking a direction from this Court to refer X to a Medical Board constituted
at MKCG Medical College & Hospital, Berhampur, to assess her condition and the
risks associated with the pregnancy and allow the termination of her pregnancy,
despite it being beyond 24 weeks.

(viii) On 25.02.2025, this Court passed an order directing the Medical
Superintendent, MKCG Medical College and Hospital, Berhampur, to convene a
Medical Board within 3 days to examine the case of X and submit a detailed
prognosis regarding the status of her pregnancy.
(ix) In compliance with the Court's order, Medical Board was convened.
After a thorough examination, the Board rendered a unanimous opinion, unequivocally stating that
the continuation of the pregnancy poses a risk of life-threatening complications for X and carrying
the pregnancy to full term would severely impact her physical and mental well-being. The Board
concluded that immediate medical intervention is necessary to safeguard X's health and life.

03-Mar-2025 15:04:42 II. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER:
3. Learned counsel for the Petitioner earnestly made the following submissions in support of his
contentions:
(i) The continuation of the pregnancy poses a threat to X's life, thereby violating her
fundamental right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution of
India.
(ii) Due to her young age and lack of understanding, X was unaware of her pregnancy
until a very late stage. The pregnancy resulted from rape, and X did not disclose the
assault earlier due to threats from the accused. Consequently, the pregnancy was
discovered only after it had progressed beyond the 24-week limit prescribed under
the MTP Act.
(iii) Carrying the pregnancy to full term and giving birth would endanger X's life, as
provided under Section 5 of the MTP Act, 1971. It would also cause grave injury to her
physical and mental health as outlined under Section 3(2)(b)(i) of the Act. The
petitioner emphasizes that Explanation 2 of the MTP Act presumes that pregnancies
resulting from rape cause grave mental anguish and trauma to the survivor.
(iv) The petitioner submits that there is a greater likelihood of substantial fetal abnormalities due to
X's hereditary conditions of Sickle Cell Anaemia and Epilepsy, as contemplated under Section 3(2B)
of the MTP Act.
(v) The petitioner relies on the Supreme Court's judgment in X v. Union of India,1 which clarified
that termination of pregnancy beyond 24 weeks 1 2023 SCC OnLine SC 1338.

X vs State Of Odisha And Ors. .... Opposite ... on 3 March, 2025
(vi) The petitioner also places reliance on the decision of the Chhattisgarh High Court in ABC v.
State of Chhattisgarh & Anr., 2 wherein the Court allowed the termination of a 28-week pregnancy
in the case of a 14-year- old rape survivor suffering from Sickle Cell Anaemia. The petitioner submits
that the present case is squarely covered by the principles laid down in the said judgment.
(vii) In light of the above, the petitioner urges this Court to grant the relief sought for, ensuring that
X's fundamental rights are protected and that she receives the necessary medical intervention
without further delay. III. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE OPPOSITE PARTIES:
4. The Learned Counsel for the Opposite Parties earnestly made the following
submissions in support of his contentions:
(i) The State Government of Odisha, in full compliance with the statutory mandate
under Section 3(2C) of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Act,
2021, constituted a Medical Board through its Notification dated 22.12.2022, issued
by the Commissioner-cum-
Secretary to the Government of Odisha.
(ii) In compliance with the directions of this Court dated 25.02.2025, the Medical Board conducted
a thorough examination of the minor victim, ensuring a meticulous assessment of her medical
condition.
Designation: AR-CUM-SR. SECRETARY Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date:
03-Mar-2025 15:04:42
(iii) The Board rendered a unanimous opinion, unequivocally affirming that the continuation of the
pregnancy poses a risk of life-threatening complications and would severely impact the minor's
physical and mental well-being, thereby justifying the necessity for immediate medical intervention.
(iv) The State, therefore, has no objection to the grant of relief sought by the Petitioner, as denial
would amount to subjecting the minor to severe physical and psychological trauma, contrary to
constitutional principles and established judicial precedents. Accordingly, the Opp. Parties pray that
this Court may be pleased to allow the writ petition and direct the medical termination of pregnancy
of the minor victim forthwith.
IV. COURT'S REASONING AND ANALYSIS:
5. Heard Learned Counsel for parties and perused the documents placed before this Court.
6. At the heart of this dispute lies a profoundly sensitive and urgent intervention of this Court. This
petition was filed by a father seeking permission for the termination of his daughter's pregnancy.
The petitioner's daughter, a 13-year-old minor, was subjected to a grievous sexual assault resulting
in her agonizing pregnancy. The petition implores this Court to refer her case to the Medical Board
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169172115/ 4
X vs State Of Odisha And Ors. .... Opposite ... on 3 March, 2025
at MKCG Medical College and Hospital, Berhampur, and to issue a direction permitting the medical
termination of her pregnancy.
7. In response to this plea, this Court, on 25.12.2025, passed an order directing the constitution of a
Medical Board to assess the minor's Designation: AR-CUM-SR. SECRETARY Location: ORISSA
HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date: 03-Mar-2025 15:04:42 condition. The Board, comprising
experienced medical professionals, conducted a meticulous evaluation. Their unanimous and
unequivocal opinion concluded that the continuation of the pregnancy poses a grave risk of
life-threatening complications and would severely impair the minor's physical and mental
well-being. The Board further emphasized the necessity of immediate medical intervention to
safeguard her health and life. Now, it falls upon this Court to determine whether the pregnancy
ought to be permitted to proceed or terminated.
8. Now, before delving into the intricacies of the case, this Court must first turn to the relevant
provisions of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971. Section 3 of the Act lays down the
conditions under which termination is permissible, prescribing both the requisite medical opinion
and the legal framework that must be strictly adhered to. The relevant excerpts of the said provision
are produced below:
"3. When Pregnancies may be terminated by registered medical practitioners.--
(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), a
registered medical practitioner shall not be guilty of any offence under that Code or
under any other law for the time being in force, if any pregnancy is terminated by him
in accordance with the provisions of this Act.
(2) Subject to the provisions of subsection (4), a pregnancy may be terminated by a
registered medical practitioner,-
(a) where the length of the pregnancy does not exceed twelve weeks if such medical
practitioner is, or
(b) where the length of the pregnancy exceeds twelve weeks but does not exceed
twenty weeks, if not less Designation: AR-CUM-SR. SECRETARY Location: ORISSA
HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date: 03-Mar-2025 15:04:42 than two registered medical
practitioners are, of opinion, formed in good faith, that,-
(i) the continuance of the pregnancy would involve a risk to the life of the pregnant
woman or of grave injury to her physical or mental health; or
(ii) there is a substantial risk that if the child were born, it would suffer from such
physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169172115/ 5
X vs State Of Odisha And Ors. .... Opposite ... on 3 March, 2025
Explanation 1.-Where any, pregnancy is alleged by the pregnant woman to have been caused by
rape, the anguish caused by such pregnancy shall be presumed to constitute a grave injury to the
mental health of the pregnant woman.
Explanation 2.-Where any pregnancy occurs as a result of failure of any device or method used by
any married woman or her husband for the purpose of limiting the number of children, the anguish
caused by such unwanted pregnancy may be presumed to constitute a grave injury to the mental
health of the pregnant woman.
(3) In determining whether the continuance of pregnancy would involve such risk of injury to the
health as is mentioned in subsection (2), account may be taken to the pregnant woman's actual or
reasonable foreseeable environment. (4) (a) No pregnancy of a woman, who has not attained the age
of eighteen years, or, who, having attained the age of eighteen years, is a [mentally ill person], shall
be terminated except with the consent in writing of her guardian.
(b) Save as otherwise provided in clause (a), no pregnancy shall be terminated except with the
consent of the pregnant woman."(Emphasis Supplied) Designation: AR-CUM-SR. SECRETARY
Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date: 03-Mar-2025 15:04:42
9. The abovementioned provisions need to be considered with the guidelines set by the Supreme
Court in X v. Union of India (supra) regarding the prerequisites for the termination of pregnancy.
The relevant excerpt is produced below:
Length of the pregnancy Requirement for termination Up to twenty weeks Opinion of
one RMP3 in terms of Section 3(2) Between twenty and twenty-four Opinion of two
RMPs in terms of weeks Section 3(2) read with Rule 3B.
Beyond twenty-four weeks If the termination is required to save the life of the
pregnant woman, the opinion of one RMP in terms of Section 5.
If there are substantial foetal abnormalities, with the approval of the Medical Board
in terms of Section 3(2B) read with Rule 3A(a)(i)
10. In light of Section 3 of the MTP Act and the requirements provided in the aforementioned
judicial precedent, it is clear that the present case squarely falls within the ambit of permissible
termination. The continuation of X's pregnancy poses a grave risk to her life and would cause severe
injury to her physical and mental health, as confirmed by the unanimous opinion of the Medical
Board. Additionally, the pregnancy is a result of rape, which, under Explanation 1 to Section 3(2), is
presumed to cause grave mental anguish to the survivor. 3 Read: Registered Medical Practitioner

11. The principles of law, the weight of precedent, and the dictates of reason admit no uncertainty
and there is no infirmity, whether in medicine or in law, that bars the medical termination of
pregnancy for X. Yet the case before this Court is not one to be resolved with mere legal formalism
or clinical detachment, for it strikes at the very heart of human dignity and demands not only the
measured reasoning of the law but the moral clarity of a society unwilling to turn away from its most
vulnerable.
12. A society that views abortion solely through the lens of regulation, fails to grasp its deeper
significance. It is, above all, a matter of individual conscience of personal liberty, the kind of liberty
that a just and democratic state must not only recognize but actively protect. The right to make
decisions about one's own body is not a privilege to be granted at the state's discretion. It is a
fundamental aspect of human dignity, one that no authority should presume to deny.
13. In a case such as this, the ultimate authority rests with the individual whose body and future
hang in the balance. It is she who must bear the weight of the decision and it is she who must be
afforded the dignity of choice. It is a fact that in the present case, the individual in question is a
minor, hence, her rights is being exercised by the guardian major. The role of the medical profession
is not to dictate but to guide, to offer counsel where health is at stake, to intervene where risk arises,
but Designation: AR-CUM-SR. SECRETARY Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date:
03-Mar-2025 15:04:42 never to stand as an obstacle between a person and their right to bodily
autonomy.
14. In the momentous pronouncement of K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India,4 the Supreme Court
declared with unwavering clarity that the right to make reproductive choices finds firm footing
within the constitutionally enshrined guarantees of life and personal liberty under Article 21.
Writing for the plurality, Justice D.Y. Chandrachud observed as follows:
"72. The decision in Suchita Srivastava dwells on the statutory right of a woman
under the MTP Act to decide whether or not to consent to a termination of pregnancy
and to have that right respected where she does not consent to termination. The
statutory recognition of the right is relatable to the constitutional right to make
reproductive choices which has been held to be an ingredient of personal liberty
under Article 21. The Court deduced the existence of such a right from a woman's
right to privacy, dignity and bodily integrity."
15. Justice Chandrachud proceeded to expound upon the principle of decisional autonomy,
intrinsically bound to the rights of privacy and self-determination, and held as follows:
"The family, marriage, procreation and sexual orientation are all integral to the
dignity of the individual. Above all, the privacy of the individual recognises an
inviolable right to determine how freedom shall be exercised."
16. The Court further noted that decisional autonomy encompasses deeply personal choices,
including those concerning reproduction and the right 4 (2017) 10 SCC 1.

Designation: AR-CUM-SR. SECRETARY Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date:
03-Mar-2025 15:04:42 to determine one's sexual or procreative identity. In a similar vein, Justice
Chelameshwar, in his opinion, asserted with unmistakable clarity that a "woman's freedom of choice
whether to bear a child or abort her pregnancy are areas which fall in the realm of privacy."
17. The question of reproductive rights and abortion is far from uncharted in the landscape of
international jurisprudence. In R v. Morgentaler,5 the Supreme Court of Canada struck down the
nation's federal abortion law, dismantling the legal barriers that once stood between women and
their right to bodily autonomy. In doing so, the Court not only decriminalized abortion but placed
the responsibility of regulation in the hands of provinces and medical professionals, where scientific
expertise and individual agency, not punitive statutes, would shape reproductive healthcare.
Framing bodily autonomy as an inalienable right woven into the fabric of democratic principles, the
Court held as follows:
"It should also be noted, however, that an emphasis on individual conscience and
individual judgment also lies at the heart of our democratic political tradition. The
ability of each citizen to make free and informed decisions is the absolute
prerequisite for the legitimacy, acceptability, and efficacy of our system of
self-government. It is because of the centrality of the rights associated with freedom
of individual conscience both to basic beliefs about human worth and dignity and to a
free and democratic political system that American jurisprudence has emphasized
the primacy or "firstness" of the First Amendment."

Designation: AR-CUM-SR. SECRETARY Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date:
03-Mar-2025 15:04:42
18. The abovementioned precedents make it clear that the principle of bodily autonomy is
foundational to the constitutional guarantee of personal liberty and human dignity. At its core,
respect for bodily autonomy necessitates minimal state interference in decisions concerning an
individual's body, particularly in matters as intimate and consequential as pregnancy. This principle
is not diminished in the case of a minor; rather, it is safeguarded through the role of her legal
guardians, who are best positioned to make decisions in her best interests. In the present case, the
parents of the minor girl, as her natural guardians and well-wishers, bear the legal and moral
responsibility to act in a manner that ensures her well-being.
19. Ultimately, the role of the court, in cases of pregnancies resulting from rape, is to intervene in a
way that empowers the victim by granting them the authority to make decisions regarding their own
body and future. In this case, there is a risk of complications in both termination and delivery. But
when the law is faced with two difficult choices, it must take the path of the lesser evil. Forcing a
thirteen-year-old to carry a pregnancy to term would place an unbearable burden on her body and
mind, one that she is neither prepared for nor capable of bearing. While termination is not without
risk, it prevents the far graver consequences of childbirth and forced motherhood at an age where
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169172115/ 8
X vs State Of Odisha And Ors. .... Opposite ... on 3 March, 2025
such responsibilities are unthinkable.
20. Although the Court has intervened to render a decision in this case, it cannot overlook the
deeply troubling aspect inherent in cases of this nature, the unwarranted reliance on judicial
intervention where the law Designation: AR-CUM-SR. SECRETARY Location: ORISSA HIGH
COURT, CUTTACK Date: 03-Mar-2025 15:04:42 itself provides a clear and unambiguous course of
action. The consequence is an undue burden placed upon those in crisis, forcing them to navigate
legal complexities where none should exist. The urgency inherent in the termination of pregnancy,
particularly in the case of a sexual assault victim, brooks no unnecessary delay. Here, time is not a
passive measure but an active force and each moment lost bears its own weight in consequence.
21. The report confirming X's pregnancy was issued on 13.02.2025; today, we stand at 03.03.2025.
A delay of more than two weeks in a matter, where time is the arbiter of both possibility and peril, is
unwarranted. This delay did not arise from the natural course of justice but from a failure to direct
the case immediately to the Medical Board. Only upon the order of this Court was the Board
apprised of the issue, and only then was the requisite report submitted.
22. The Supreme Court, in X v. Union of India (Supra), has laid down clear precepts: where the
gestational period surpasses 24 weeks, the matter must be referred to the Medical Board. The
necessity of approaching this Court could have been obviated had the matter been referred to the
Medical Board at the outset, rather than awaiting judicial intervention to set the process in motion.
23. The seriousness of the matter before this Court is undeniably profound.
Whether driven by fear of reprisal or an abundance of caution in the face of potential criminal
liability, many health service providers hesitate to act within the bounds of their professional and
legal authority. Instead, they force patients to seek court approval for what is Designation:
AR-CUM-SR. SECRETARY Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date: 03-Mar-2025
15:04:42 fundamentally a medical decision, one that should be guided by expertise and necessity,
not burdened by procedural uncertainty.
24. The issue at hand found fitting adjudication in X v. State of Maharashtra,6 where the Bombay
High Court was confronted with a case in which the petitioner's pregnancy had advanced beyond 24
weeks. The Court, in its deliberation, noted with concern that rather than directing the matter to the
Medical Board for an opinion grounded in medical examination, the District General Hospital,
whether through oversight or ignorance, counselled the petitioner to seek recourse before the
judiciary. In light of these considerations, the Court deemed it necessary to direct the Department of
Public Health and the Department of Medical to establish a comprehensive Standard Operating
Procedure. The relevant excerpts of this judgment are produced below:
"10. It appears that the petitioner approached the General Hospital, Wardha where
the doctor who attended the petitioner was of the tentative opinion that though the
petitioner is carrying pregnancy beyond twenty-four weeks, but there is risk to the
child, if born. In such circumstances, in accordance with the legal provisions as
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169172115/ 9
X vs State Of Odisha And Ors. .... Opposite ... on 3 March, 2025
discussed above, the matter/case ought to have been referred to such Medical Board
instead of suggesting her to approach this Court for seeking permission for
termination of her pregnancy.
11. The aforesaid facts call upon us to direct the Department of Public Health and the
Department of Medical Education and Drugs of the State of Maharashtra to a
formulate Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) which shall be issued to all 6 2024
SCC OnLine Bom 1663.

in the State of Maharashtra. The said Standard Operating Procedure shall be
prepared by the experts in the field and shall accordingly be notified and circulated
amongst all concerned."
25. To subject a victim and her family to prolonged legal formalities is to impose a burden that
extends beyond the courtroom, adding to their distress rather than alleviating it. When legal
processes become unnecessarily complex and unyielding, they risk creating additional hardship for
those already in a vulnerable position. The law, at its best, serves as a shield of protection, but when
applied without sensitivity, it can become an obstacle rather than a source of relief. At its core, this
is not merely a question of policy or procedural compliance but one of principle.
26. A working paper titled Legal Barriers to Accessing Safe Abortion Services in India: A
Fact-Finding Study7 published by the NLSIU, Bengaluru, offers a compelling insight into the ground
realities faced by women seeking access to abortion services. Chapter 4 of the working paper titled
"Consent and Documentation Requirements as Barriers to Abortion Services"
examines the unwarranted imposition of judicial authorization on patients,
highlighting how such requirements create unnecessary obstacles to accessing
abortion services.
27. In the paper, they have highlighted the case of R, an adult woman whose pregnancy was a result
of rape. She had a severe developmental 7A. Chandra, M. Satish, S. Shree, M. Saxena, 'Legal Barriers

know of her pregnancy. Both R and her family expressed their unequivocal desire to terminate the
pregnancy. However, the service providers at a major government hospital in Chennai declined to
proceed with the termination without judicial authorization, insisting on a "certificate" from a court.
The lawyer representing R before the Madras High Court submitted that the service providers
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169172115/ 10
X vs State Of Odisha And Ors. .... Opposite ... on 3 March, 2025
maintained their stance despite the absence of any medical impediment to the procedure. The
service providers stated that:
"[The doctors] said that, 'there is no medical reason but we always want a judicial
confirmation of some kind. In most of these cases, even if it is rape, later the families
will do some kind of compromise get victim married off to the perpetrator then they
will come and ask us why did you abort. We will be answerable."
28. It was further submitted that the doctors harboured apprehensions of being subjected to
reprisals or facing questions from external parties regarding the termination of pregnancy. The
lawyer representing R made assurance to the service providers that there existed a clear consent
form and that no liability would attach to them. However, the service providers expressed
reluctance, citing social pressures from families. As stated, "They were just being risk averse".
29. The case of R is not an isolated occurrence but part of a discernible pattern that manifests in
numerous instances, including the present one. The apprehension harboured by service providers is
not born of legal necessity but of an unspoken anxiety, a spectre of liability that looms larger in
perception than in law. This fear stems from an incomplete Designation: AR-CUM-SR. SECRETARY
Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date: 03-Mar-2025 15:04:42 understanding of the
law, a gap in knowledge that turns discretion into inaction and duty into doubt. Shedding light on
this issue, the paper made the following observation:
"Section 3 (2) (b) (ii) of the MTP Act presumes that rape causes "grave injury" to the
mental health of the pregnant woman, and consequently permits termination on that
ground. However, providers seek judicial authorisation prior to terminating a
pregnancy out of a fear of backlash from the pregnant woman's partner or family.
They are also apprehensive of being dragged into criminal proceedings if the woman
is a rape victim. A senior gynaecologist in Chennai stated that "a court order [was]
required for all MTP cases where the pregnancy [was] an outcome of rape." Judicial
authorisation may also be insisted on in "special cases" such as those where the
woman is "psychologically" unstable. .....
Although in such cases a permission for termination of pregnancy is usually granted
the extralegal requirement of judicial authorisation, and the consequent delay in
termination of a pregnancy, causes significant physical and mental agony to women.
For rape victims, this prolongs the trauma of sexual violence."
(Emphasis Supplied)
30. The case before this Court is no different from the one mentioned above. Here, a
thirteen-year-old child, still developing her understanding of the world, has endured the
unimaginable; the violation of her body, the crushing of her spirit, and the burden of an unwanted
pregnancy she never chose. It is a tragedy that defies comprehension, a failure of protection so
profound that it must awaken the conscience of all who encounter it. Having failed to prevent this

03-Mar-2025 15:04:42 calamity, the system must now rise to the occasion with both compassion
and efficiency.
31. Where time is of the essence, the machinery of justice must recognize its own limits. The courts
exist to correct injustice, not to impose delays where none are warranted. Intervention is justified
only when a failure of the system threatens to deny what should be freely granted. To insist upon
judicial oversight in every instance is to misunderstand the very purpose of the law. It is not meant
to stand in the way of fundamental rights but to clear the path for them.
32. In such circumstances, the duty of the State is both evident and imperative. It must close the gap
in legal understanding that renders healthcare providers hesitant, uncertain, and reluctant in the
fulfilment of their obligations. The fear of backlash must not be allowed to dictate the course of
medical care. It is not enough to offer assurances; what is required is a deliberate and unwavering
commitment to legal clarity and institutional confidence. The Patients and the healthcare providers
cannot be left to navigate a maze of red tape that serves no purpose but to obstruct, delay, and deter.
In the domain of essential reproductive healthcare, neither the fear of litigation nor the burdens of
cumbersome formalities may cast doubt upon the rights and the law, in its reasoned justice, has
affirmed.
33. In light of the foregoing, this Court issues the following directions to the Health and Family
Welfare Department, Government of Odisha, for the formulation and implementation of a Standard
Operating Procedure concerning the medical termination of pregnancy:

any kind of legal assistance can be easily provided to the victims of rape who bear the

expertise on this issue.
V. CONCLUSION
34. In light of the legal framework, the medical opinion, and the fundamental rights at stake, this
Court finds no justification to deny the Petitioner's plea. The law is not meant to stand in the way of
dignity and justice but to uphold them. The medical termination of pregnancy in this case is not only
legally permissible but also morally imperative.
35. Accordingly, this Writ Petition is allowed, and the concerned authorities are directed to ensure
the procedure is carried out without further delay or obstruction.
36. The concerned Department is further directed to take necessary steps for the formulation of the
aforementioned SOP, ensuring its completion within six months from the date of this judgment.
37. Interim order, if any, passed earlier stands vacated.
