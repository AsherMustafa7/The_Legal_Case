CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE ASHWANI KUMAR SINGH
ORAL JUDGMENT
Date : 19-04-2019
This application under Article 227 of the Constitution
of India has been filed by the petitioners challenging the order
dated 18.12.2018 passed by learned Sub-Judge-VIII, Civil Court,
Kaimur (Bhabhua) in Title Suit No. 213 of 2006 whereby learned
Sub-Judge-VIII has allowed the defendants-respondents to file
written statement.
2. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted
that the court below has travelled beyond its jurisdiction and
modified the order of this Court without leave of the court by
allowing filing of the written statement beyond the stipulated time.
Thus, it has made an error of procedural law. Hence, it is a fit case
to invoke supervisory jurisdiction under Article 227 of the
Constitution of India and set aside the order impugned.
3. The facts of the case, in brief, are that the
respondents 1st set here are plaintiffs of the Title Suit No. 213 of
2006. Respondents 2nd set and respondents 3rd set are defendants of

the aforesaid title suit. The respondents 3rd set have been added
Patna High Court C.Misc. No.250 of 2019 dt.19-04-2019
3/5
party as defendants in the title suit by the order of this Court dated
11.09.2017
passed in CWJC No. 17620 of 2012.
4. The operative part of the order dated 11.09.2017 passed in CWJC No. 17620 of 2012 reads as
under :
"In the result, this writ application is allowed. The impugned order is set aside. The
intervention application filed by the petitioners is allowed and they are made
party-defendant in the suit.
The learned counsel, Mr. Mahesh Prasad No.2 appearing on behalf of the petitioners
submitted that he will file written statement within one month from the date of
receipt of a copy of this order by the court below."
5. In this background, respondent 3rd set filed written statement on 04.12.2017.
6. The petitioners are aggrieved because of the filing of the written statement, which has been
accepted by the trial court beyond one month from the date of the order passed in CWJC No. 17620
of 2012.
7. It is true that the written statement has not been filed within one month from the date of receipt
of a copy of the order dated 11.09.2017 passed in CWJC No. 17620 of 2012. However, the same alone
would not make the order passed by the Patna High Court C.Misc. No.250 of 2019 dt.19-04-2019
trial court bad in law. This Court vide order dated 11.09.2017 passed in CWJC No. 17620 of 2012
had not issued any direction to the respondents 3rd set to file written statement within one month
from the date of receipt of a copy of the order by the court below rather it was one of the
submissions of the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners in that case.
8. The written statement is filed by a party in suit under Order 8 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil
Procedure, which provides that the defendant shall, within thirty days from the date of service of
summons on him, present a written statement of his defence and the proviso to Order 8 Rule 1
provides that where the defendant fails to file the written statement within the said period of thirty
days, he shall be allowed to file the same on such other day, as may be specified by the court, for
reasons to be recorded in writing, but which shall not be later than 90 days from the date of service
of summons.

9. Thus, it would be evident that proviso to Order 8 Rule 1 confers jurisdiction upon the court to
entertain a written statement filed by the defendant after 30 days, but the same should not be later
than 90 days from the date of service of summon.
10. Here, in the present case, after the defendants- respondents 3rd set were impleaded as party
pursuant to the order Patna High Court C.Misc. No.250 of 2019 dt.19-04-2019 passed by this Court
in CWJC No. 17620 of 2012, the written statement has been filed within 90 days and the trial court
has assigned specific reasons in its order for allowing the defendants- respondents 3rd set to file
written statement. It has also imposed cost of Rs.500/-while allowing the defendants-respondents
3rd set to file written statement.
11. Under the circumstances, I see no reason to interfere with the order impugned under the
supervisory jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
12. Accordingly, the application is dismissed.
