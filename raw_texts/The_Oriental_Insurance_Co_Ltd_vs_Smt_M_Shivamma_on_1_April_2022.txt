THIS M.F.A. COMING ON FOR FINAL HEARING THIS
DAY, THE COURT DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING:
JUDGMENT
This appeal is filed under Section-173(1) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 ('MV Act' for brevity) by the
appellant - insurance company, challenging the judgment and award dated 05.09.2011, passed in
MVC No.1612/2010, on the file of Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, at Bangalore.
Brief facts:
2. On 28.03.2009, at about 3.30 p.m., when the deceased Malla Reddy was walking
on the extreme left side of the road in front of Manjunath Estate, on Kolar Bangalore
Road (NH-4) at that time the driver of the Tata Ace bearing registration No.AP 03 X
0472 came in a rash and negligent manner with high speed and dashed against the
deceased. Due to the impact, he fell down and sustained grievous injuries and died on

the way to the Hospital. It is stated that the deceased was aged 63 years, and was
working as a Watchman in Manjunatha Farm House and earning Rs.10,000/- per
month. On service of summons, respondent Nos.1 and 2 before the Tribunal
appeared through their respective counsel. Respondent No.3 remained absent and
hence placed exparte.
3. Hence, a claim petition was filed by the dependants-claimants under Section-166
of the M.V. Act, before the Tribunal claiming compensation. The Tribunal on
appreciating the materials on record, allowed the petition in part, and awarded a
compensation of Rs.1,97,500/- along with interest at 6% per annum, from the date of
petition till the date of deposit. The Tribunal held respondent Nos.1 to 3 are jointly
and severally liable to pay the compensation.
4. The learned counsel for the appellant -
insurance company submitted that the driver of the offending vehicle was holding Driving License
to drive non- transport vehicle, but was driving goods vehicle (transport vehicle). Therefore, there is
a violation of the condition of the insurance policy. Hence, the Tribunal without considering that
there is a breach of condition of the policy, had erroneously fastened the liability on the appellant.
Therefore, the appeal is liable to be allowed by exonerating the appellant-insurance company from
the liability to pay the compensation.
5. On the other hand, the learned counsel for respondent Nos.1 to 4 - claimants submitted that the
Tribunal has correctly applied the legal principles and put the burden on the appellant - insurance
company to pay compensation, which needs no interference. Therefore, prays to dismiss the appeal.
6. Heard the learned counsel and perused the material on record.
7. In the present case, the offending vehicle is Tata Ace, which is a goods vehicle (transport vehicle).
Exhibit-R2 is the Driving License of the driver, which shows the driver was having driving license to
drive LMV (Non- Transport Vehicle). Therefore, the learned counsel for the appellant - insurance
company contends that the driver was holding driving license to drive non-transport vehicle and
hence cannot drive transport vehicle. This legal position is clarified by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
the judgment in the case of MUKUND DEWANGAN VS. ORIENTAL INSURANCE COMPANY
LIMITED, reported in AIR 2017 SC 3668, wherein at para-10 it was held as follows:
"45. Transport vehicle has been defined in section 2(47) of the Act, to mean a public
service vehicle, a goods carriage, an educational institution bus or a private service
vehicle. Public service vehicle has been defined in section 2(35) to mean any motor
vehicle used or adapted to be used for the carriage of passengers for hire or reward
and includes a maxicab, a motor cab, contract marriage, and stage carriage. Goods
carriage which is also a transport vehicle is defined in section 2(14) to mean a motor
vehicle constructed or adapted for use solely for the carriage of goods, or any motor
vehicle not so constructed or adapted when used for the carriage of goods. It was

The Oriental Insurance Co Ltd vs Smt M Shivamma on 1 April, 2022
rightly submitted that a person holding licence to drive light motor vehicle registered
for private use, who is driving a similar vehicle which is registered or insured, for the
purpose of carrying passengers for hire or reward, would not require an endorsement
as to drive a transport vehicle, as the same is not contemplated by the provisions of
the Act. It was also rightly contended that there are several vehicles which can be
used for private use as well as for carrying passengers for hire or reward. When a
driver is authorised to drive a vehicle, he can drive it irrespective of the fact whether
it is used for a private purpose or for purpose of hire or reward or for carrying the
goods in the said vehicle. It is what is intended by the provision of the Act, and the
Amendment Act 54/1994.
46. Section 10 of the Act requires a driver to hold a licence with respect to the class of
vehicles and not with respect to the type of vehicles. In one class of vehicles, there
may be different kinds of vehicles. If they fall in the same class of vehicles, no
separate endorsement is required to drive such vehicles. As light motor vehicle
includes transport vehicle also, a holder of light motor vehicle licence can drive all the
vehicles of the class including transport vehicles. It was pre- amended position as
well the post-amended position of Form 4 as amended on 28.3.2001. Any other
interpretation would be repugnant to the definition of "light motor vehicle" in section
2(21) and the provisions of section 10(2)(d), Rule
8 of the Rules of 1989, other provisions and also the forms which are in tune with the provisions.
Even otherwise the forms never intended to
exclude transport vehicles from the
category of 'light motor vehicles' and for light motor vehicle, the validity period of such licence hold
good and apply for the transport vehicle of such class also and the expression in Section 10(2)(e) of
the Act 'Transport Vehicle' would include medium goods vehicle, medium passenger motor vehicle,
heavy goods vehicle, heavy passenger motor vehicle which earlier found place in section 10(2)(e) to
(h) and our conclusion is fortified by the syllabus and rules which we have discussed. Thus we
answer the questions which are referred to us thus:
(i) 'Light motor vehicle' as defined in section 2(21) of the Act would include a
transport vehicle as per the weight prescribed in section 2(21) read with section 2(15)
and 2(48). Such transport vehicles are not excluded from the definition of the light
motor vehicle by virtue of Amendment Act No.54/1994.
(ii) A transport vehicle and omnibus, the gross vehicle weight of either of which does
not exceed 7500 kg. would be a light motor vehicle and also motor car or tractor or a
road roller, 'unladen weight' of which does not exceed 7500 kg. and holder of a
driving licence to drive class of "light motor vehicle" as provided in section 10(2)(d) is
competent to drive a transport vehicle or omnibus, the gross vehicle weight of which
does not exceed 7500 kg. or a motor car or tractor or road-roller, the "unladen
weight" of which does not exceed 7500 kg. That is to say, no separate endorsement on

the licence is required to drive a transport vehicle of light motor vehicle class as
enumerated above. A licence issued under section 10(2)(d) continues to be valid after
Amendment Act 54/1994 and 28.3.2001 in the form.
(iii) The effect of the amendment made by virtue of Act No.54/1994 w.e.f. 14.11.1994
while substituting clauses (e) to (h) of section 10(2) which contained "medium goods
vehicle" in section 10(2)(e), medium passenger motor vehicle in section 10(2)(f),
heavy goods vehicle in section 10(2)(g) and "heavy passenger motor vehicle" in
section 10(2)(h) with expression 'transport vehicle' as substituted in section 10(2)(e)
related only to the aforesaid substituted classes only. It does not exclude transport
vehicle, from the purview of section 10(2)(d) and section 2(41) of the Act i.e. light
motor vehicle.
(iv) The effect of amendment of Form 4 by insertion of "transport vehicle" is related
only to the categories which were substituted in the year 1994 and the procedure to
obtain driving licence for transport vehicle of class of "light motor vehicle" continues
to be the same as it was and has not been changed and there is no requirement to
obtain separate endorsement to drive transport vehicle, and if a driver is holding
licence to drive light motor vehicle, he can drive transport vehicle of such class
without any endorsement to that effect."
8. Therefore, just because there is an endorsement of non-transport in the driving license and if the
driver drives transport vehicle, that cannot be a fundamental breach of the insurance policy so as to
avoid the liability of the insurance company. Therefore, the Tribunal has correctly fastened the
liability on the appellant-insurance company to pay the compensation. Hence the judgment and
award passed by the Tribunal is justified one which needs no interference. Therefore, the appeal is
devoid of merit and liable to be dismissed. Accordingly, I proceed to pass the following:
ORDER i. The appeal is dismissed.
ii. The judgment and award dated 05.09.2011, passed in MVC No.1612/2010, on the
file of Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, at Bangalore is hereby confirmed.
iii. The amount in deposit is ordered to be transferred to the Tribunal forthwith,
along with TCR and a certified copy of this order.
iii. Draw award accordingly.
