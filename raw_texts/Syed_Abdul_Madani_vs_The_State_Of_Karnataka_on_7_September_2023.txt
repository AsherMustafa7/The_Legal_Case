Syed Abdul Madani vs The State Of Karnataka on 7 September, 2023
e. Any other order or direction may be issued as consequential orders, in the interest of justice.
2. Various grounds are urged in the writ petition seeking the said reliefs.
3. We have heard the arguments of learned senior counsel Sri. Kiran S.Javali on behalf of petitioner
and learned HCGP.
NC: 2023:KHC:32320-DB
4. The learned Senior Counsel has submitted that the order of detention was passed by the Deputy
Commissioner and District Magistrate, Udupi District in Order No.MAG (2) CR/168/2023, E 111120
dated 11.04.2023 as per Annexure - A. On that basis issued detention order on the same day as per
Annexure - B. The Annexure - A1 was submitted to the State Government by the District Magistrate
for confirmation in accordance with the Karnataka Prevention of Dangerous Activities of
Bootleggers, Drug Offenders, Gamblers, Goodas, Immortal Traffic Offenders, Slum Grabbers and
video or Audio pirates Act, 1985 (hereinafter for short referred as 'Act'). The State Government had
passed the orders as per Section 3(1) of the Act as per Annexure - C dated 19.04.2023, confirming
detention order passed by District Magistrate
5. The learned Senior Counsel further submits that in Annexure - A, which is ordered by District
Magistrate under Section 3(2) of the Act, he had to intimate "the NC: 2023:KHC:32320-DB detenue
that the detenue has right of giving representation to the District Magistrate, who passed detention
order for reviewing the order of detention, before the order passed by him is approved by the State
Government. However, in Annexure - A, the District Magistrate has referred that the detenue can
file a representation to the State Government or Advisory Board through Superintendent of Central
Prison, Belagavi." Therefore, the learned District Magistrate has not complied with the mandatory
requirement of the Act to inform the detenue about his right to give the representation to him for
reviewing the order of detention.
6. He has further submitted that in the case of State of Maharashtra and others Vs. Santosh Shankar
Acharya1, wherein it is held that if the detaining authority, who passed detention order under
Section 3(2) of the Act, failed to inform the detenue about his right to make a representation to him,
until detention order passed by him (2000) 7 SCC 463 NC: 2023:KHC:32320-DB is approved by
State Government within 12 days and non- communication there of would vitiate the detention
order. The law laid down in the said judgment by the Hon'ble Apex court is applicable to the facts in
the present case. Hence, prayed to quash the order of detention passed at Annexure - A, C and E.
7. The learned HCGP vehemently contended that the District Magistrate while passing the orders as
per Annexure - A has followed all the requirement of the law. It is mentioned in the said order that a
detenue can submit his representation to the State Government or Advisory Board through
Superintendent of Police, Central Prison, Belagavi. It was informed to the detenue that he had right
of giving representation to re-consider his detention order, which is sufficient compliance of the
provisions of the Act and on that ground the detention order cannot be quashed.

NC: 2023:KHC:32320-DB
8. The learned HCGP further submits that, the aforesaid ground is not taken in the writ petition and
such contention is taken surprisingly during the argument. Therefore, the said submission cannot be
considered and prays to dismiss the writ petition.
9. Per contra, the learned Senior Counsel submits that the State Government has wrongfully
detained the detenue without following the procedures of law. It is for the competent authority to
justify its action and prove before the Court that it had taken all the necessary action in accordance
with law, to protect the interest of residents of this Country under Article 22 of the Constitution of
India. Merely, no such ground is taken in the petition does not affect rights of the detenue; It is
sufficient for the detenue to show that mandatory provisions of law are not followed. In support of
his submission, he relied on the judgment rendered by Apex Court in the case of SMT. ICCHU DEVI
CHORARIA VS. UNION OF INDIA AND NC: 2023:KHC:32320-DB OTHERS2 and submitted that
there is no need to follow strict rules of pleadings in the writ of Habeas corpus. Therefore, the said
reason do not answer to the grounds, urged by the detenue and prayed to allow the writ petition.
10. We anxiously gone through the records and considered the submission of learned counsel
appearing for both the sides.
11. Brief facts of the case are that, the detenue by name Saiffudin @ Saif S/o Abdul Khader resident
of Athrady Village, Udupi District is said to be an habitual offender and involved in several criminal
offences like murder, attempt to murder, extortion, assault, attacking the people with dangerous
weapon etc., since 1995. Four criminal cases have been registered against him in the police station of
Hiriyadka, Piriyadka, Manipal, Kundapura and Udupi town for various offences mentioned above.
In Cr.No.71/2022 of Manipal Police Station, he was acquitted AIR 1980 SC 1983 NC:
2023:KHC:32320-DB since material witnesses have turned hostile to the case of the prosecution.
Similarly, in Cr.No.38/2022 of Kundapur Police Station, the matter was compromised with the
victim. The said acquittal and compromise were due to threat of detenue. Witnesses were scared to
give true evidence before the Court. Considering his antecedents and criminal background, his name
is registered in Rowdy
- B registrar of Hiriyadka Police Station. Considering these facts and the information received by the
concerned, the District Magistrate, Udupi came to conclusion that the detenue is menace to the
society. To prevent the illegal acts of the detenue and also to protect the interest of the society at
large, the District Magistrate decided to detain the detenue under Section 3 of the Act. Accordingly,
acting under Section 3 (2) of the Act, the learned District Magistrate, Udupi issued impugned order
dated 11.04.2023 bearing No. MAG(2) (CR)/168/2023/E111120 as per Annexure - A.

Syed Abdul Madani vs The State Of Karnataka on 7 September, 2023
12. In terms of Annexure - A, the learned District Magistrate, issued detention order of even number
dated 11.04.2023 as per Annexure - B.
13. It appears that the learned District Magistrate submitted the orders passed by him as per
Annexure - A & B, to the State Government; The State Government after considering the orders of
Advisory Board and materials placed with the report, passed impugned orders under Section 3(1) of
the Act, bearing No.HD208SST2023, Bengaluru 19.04.2023, ordering to detain the detenue for a
period of one year (Preventive Detention) and approved the orders made by learned District
Magistrate as per Annexure - A. The same are challenged by the Detenue.
14. Though several grounds are urged in the writ petition but the learned Senior counsel during the
course of the argument, restricted the contention in respect of intimation to the detenue about his
right to submit representation to the District Magistrate to review or
- 11 -
NC: 2023:KHC:32320-DB reconsider his detention order before it is approved by the State
Government as referred supra.
15. To consider the submission of the learned counsel appearing for both the sides, it is necessary to
read the relevant provisions of Act. Section 3 of the Act, reads as under:
3. Power to make orders detaining certain persons:- (1) The State Government may, if
satisfied with respect to any bootlegger or drug-offender or gambler or goonda
or(Immoral Traffic Offender or Slum-Grabber or Video or Audio Pirate) that with a
view to prevent him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of
public order, it is necessary so to do, make an order directing that such persons be
detained.
(2) If, having regard to the circumstances prevailing or likely to prevail in any area within the local
limits of the jurisdiction of a District Magistrate or a Commissioner of Police, the State Government
is satisfied that it is necessary so to do, it may, by order in writing, direct that during such period as
may be specified in the order, such District Magistrate or Commissioner of Police may also, if
satisfied as provided in sub-
- 12 -
NC: 2023:KHC:32320-DB section(1), exercise the powers conferred by the sub-section:
Provided that the period specified in the order made by the State Government under
this sub-section shall not, in the first instance, exceed three months, but the State
Government may, if satisfied as aforesaid that it is necessary so to do, amend such
order to extend such period from time to time by any period not exceeding three
months at any one time. (3) When any order is made under this Section by an officer
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109339452/ 5
Syed Abdul Madani vs The State Of Karnataka on 7 September, 2023
mentioned in sub-
section(2), he shall, forthwith report the fact to the State Government together with the grounds on
which the order has been made and such other particulars as, in his opinion, have a bearing on the
matter and no such order shall remain in force for more than twelve days after the making thereof,
unless, in the meantime, it has been approved by the State Government.
Section 8 : Grounds of order of detention to be disclosed to persons affected by the order:
(1) When a person is detained in pursuance of a detention order, the authority
making the order shall, as soon as may be, but not later than five days from the date
of detention, communicate to him the grounds on which the order has been mae and
shall afford him the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order
to the State Government.
- 13 -
NC: 2023:KHC:32320-DB (2) Nothing in sub-section (1) shall require the authority to disclose facts
which it considers to be against the public interest to disclose.
Section 14: Revocation of detention orders: -
(1) Without prejudice to the provisions of Section 21 of the Karnataka General
Clauses Act, 1899, a detention order may, at any time, be revoked or modified by the
State Government, notwithstanding that the order has been made by an officer
mentioned in sub-section (2) of Section 3.
(2) The revocation or expiry of a detention order (hereinafter in this sub-section
referred to as the earlier detention order) shall not, whether such earlier detention
order has been made before or after the commencement of the Karnataka Prevention
of Dangerous Activities of Boot-leggers, Drug-offenders, Goondas, Immoral traffic
offenders and slum-grabbers(Amendment) Act, 1987, bar the making of another
detention order (hereinafter in this sub-
section referred to as the subsequent detention order) under Section 3 against the same person:
Provided that in a case where no fresh facts have arisen after the revocation or expiry
of the earlier detention order made against such person, the maximum period for
which such person may be detained in pursuance of the subsequent detention order
- 14 -
NC: 2023:KHC:32320-DB shall in no case, extend beyond the expiry of a period of
twelve months, from the date of detention under the earlier detention order.

Syed Abdul Madani vs The State Of Karnataka on 7 September, 2023
16. It is also necessary to refer Article 22 of Indian Constitution, which reads as under:
22. Protection against arrest and detention in certain cases-
(1) No person who is arrested shall be detained in custody without being informed, as
soon as may be, of the grounds for such arrest nor shall he be denied the right to
consult, and to be defended by, a legal practitioner of his choice.
(2) .....
(3).......
(4)........
(5) When any person is detained in pursuance of an order made under any law
providing for preventive detention, the authority making the order shall, as soon as
may be, communicate to such person the grounds on which the order has been made
and shall afford him the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the
order.
- 15 -
NC: 2023:KHC:32320-DB
17. On going through the above said provisions, it is clear that as per Section 8 of the Act, it is
mandatory duty of the District Magistrate, if he passes orders under Section 3(2) of the Act, to serve
the copy of the detention order passed by him to the detenue and also inform him of his right to
make representation to him to revise/reconsider his order of detention before it is approved by the
State Government. Once the State Government approves as provided under Section 9 of the Act and
passes order under Section 3(1), then the representation shall be given to the Advisory Board or
State Government as the case may be. Admittedly, in this case, the District Magistrate has not
followed mandatory provision of intimating the detenue of his right to give the representation to
him before detention order passed by him was approved by the State Government. Learned District
Magistrate had passed the orders on 11.04.2023 and after following the procedures, the State
Government had passed/approved the order of the learned District Magistrate on 19.04.2023. Till
passing of the orders of
- 16 -
NC: 2023:KHC:32320-DB approval by the State Government at Annexure - C, learned District
Magistrate had jurisdiction to receive the representation and re-consider his detention order.
Therefore, valuable right given to the detenue under Article 22(5) of the Indian Constitution has
been violated by the learned District Magistrate and it vitiates the detention order.

Syed Abdul Madani vs The State Of Karnataka on 7 September, 2023
18. In the case of Santhosh Acharya (referred supra), the Hon'ble Apex Court held as under:
The District Magistrate or Commissioner of Police on being authorised by the State
Government could issue an order of detention under Sub- section (2) of Section.3.
When an officer exercises power and issues orders of detention under sub- section (2)
then he is duty-bound to report forthwith the facts of detention and the grounds on
which the order of detention is made and/or other particulars to the State
Government. On receipt of the report, the grounds and the particulars from the
officer concerned the State Government is required to approve the order of detention
within 12 days, and if it is not approved within 12 days then it automatically lapses.
Section 8(1) casts mandatory obligation both on the authority which passes an order
of detention either under sub-section (1) or under sub-section
- 17 -
NC: 2023:KHC:32320-DB (2) i.e., if the State Government issues an order of
detention under sub-section (1), or if the officer empowered issues an order of
detention under sub-section (2) that the same must be communicated to the detenu
not later than 5 days from the date of detention. Although in the latter part of
sub-section (1) of Section 8 it has been categorically mentioned that an earliest
opportunity of making a representation against the order to the State Government
should be afforded, but that does not make the State Government the detaining
authority as soon as the factum of detention is communicated by the person
concerned exercising power under sub-
section (2) as provided under sub-section (3) thereof nor does it take away the power of entertaining
a representation from a detenu so long as the order of detention has not been approved by the State
Government. In a case where an officer other than the State Government issues an order of
detention under sub-section (2) of Section 3 his powers as the detaining authority to deal with the
representation under the provisions of Section 21 of the Bombay General Clauses Act, 1904, cannot
be said to be taken away merely because Section 8(1) specifically provides for making a
representation to the State Government. Such failure would make the order of detention invalid. As
such the ratio of the constitution Bench decision of this Court in Kamleshkumar case would apply
notwithstanding that in Kamleshkumar case the Court was dealing with an order of detention issued
under the provisions of the COFEPOSA Act.
- 18 -
NC: 2023:KHC:32320-DB
19. The facts in the above said case are similar to the facts in the present case. However, detention
order was issued in the above said case was under Maharastra Prevention of Dangerous Activities of
Slumlords, Bootleggers, Drug Offenders and Dangerous Persons Act, 1981, which appears to be in
paramateria with the Act. therefore, the law laid down in the above said judgment is aptly applicable
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/109339452/ 8
Syed Abdul Madani vs The State Of Karnataka on 7 September, 2023
to facts of the present case.
20. There is no convincing arguments by learned HCGP in respect of failure to mention the
mandatory information in the detention order by learned District Magistrate. therefore, the
impugned detention order passed by the detaining authority as per Annexure - A, C & E are invalid.
21. The submission of learned HCGP that no such grounds are taken in the writ petition is suitably
answered in the case of Smt. Icchu Devi Choraria (referred supra) by the Hon'ble Supreme Court,
wherein it is held that: (we quote)
- 19 -
NC: 2023:KHC:32320-DB In case of an application for a writ of habeas corpus, the practice evolved
by Supreme Court is not to follow strict rules of pleading nor place undue emphasis on the question
as to on whom the burden of proof lies. Even a postcard written by a detenu from jail has been
sufficient to activise the Court into examining the legality of detention. The Supreme Court has
consistently shown great anxiety for personal liberty and refused to throw out a petition merely on
the ground that it does not disclose a prima facie case invalidating the order of detention. Whenever
a petition for a writ of habeas corpus has come up before the Supreme Court it has almost invariably
issued a rule calling upon the detaining authority to justify the detention. Once the rule is issued it is
the bounden duty of the Court to satisfy itself that all the safeguards by the law have been
scrupulously observed and the citizen is not deprived of his personal liberty otherwise than in
accordance with law. Where large masses of people are poor, illiterate and ignorant and access to
the courts is not easy on account of lack of financial resources, it would be most unreasonable to
insist that the petitioner should set out clearly and specifically the grounds on which he challenges
the order of detention and make out a prima facie case in support of those grounds before a rule is
issued or to hold that the detaining authority should not be able to do anything more than just meet
the specific grounds of challenge put forward by the petitioner in the petition. The burden of
showing that the detention is in accordance with the procedure established by law has always been
placed by the Court on the detaining authority because Article 21 of the
- 20 -
NC: 2023:KHC:32320-DB Constitution provides in clear and explicit terms that no one shall be
deprived of his life or personal liberty except in accordance with procedure established by law.
22. The detaining authority that is learned District Magistrate, Udupi, did not strictly follow the
procedures prescribed under Section 8 of the Act, while issuing detention order under Section 3(2)
of the Act, for the reasons narrated above. Hence, the said detention order and correspondingly
approval order passed by State Government, are not in accordance with law and needs to be
quashed.
23. Accordingly, we pass the following:
