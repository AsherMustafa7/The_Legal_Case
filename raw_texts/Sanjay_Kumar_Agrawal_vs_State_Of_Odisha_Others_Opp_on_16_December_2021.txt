ORDER
16.12.2021 Order No.
01.
1. This matter is taken up through Hybrid Arrangement (Virtual/Physical Mode).
2. Heard.
3. Tender notice was floated by the Chief Engineer (Buildings), Works Department-Opp. Party No.3
for construction of Multi Purposed Hall at Khariar Road. The petitioner submitted his bid in
response to tender call notice along with others. The petitioner is stated to have been disqualified in
the evaluation by the Technical Committee on the ground that, he had no previous experience of the
work for which the tender had been floated.
4. Taking us through Clause 48 of the tender documents, Mr. Acharya, learned counsel for the
petitioner submits that Clause-48 does not whisper a word about the previous experience of the
petitioner, so far as the project is concerned. But going through the eligibility criteria in Clause-G,
we find that such a condition is there in the eligibility criteria. The petitioner has some other
grievances also regarding his disqualification by the Technical Committee.
