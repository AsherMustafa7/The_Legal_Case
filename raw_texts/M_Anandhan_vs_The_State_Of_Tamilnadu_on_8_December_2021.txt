Government Advocate appearing for the respondents 1 and 3 and Mr.M.Baskar, learned Standing
Counsel appearing for the second respondent.
3. The first respondent proposed to acquire certain lands in Sevvapet Village, including the land
owned by the petitioners comprised in Survey No.62/1 to an extent of 71 cents and the land
comprised in Survey No.64/1 to an extent of 67 cents in total 1.38 acres vide the Tamil Nadu
Government Gazette Extraordinary Notification No.529 dated 20.08.1987 for the formation of

contemplated under Section 9(3) and 10 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, dated 09.01.1989. The
first petitioner appeared before the third respondent on 02.02.1989 and submitted a representation.
Though some of the lands were exempted from the acquisition, the objections raised by the
petitioners were not considered and as such the petitioners https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
approached this Court challenging the acquisition proceedings in W.P.No.6751 of 1990. Because of
the pendency of the writ petition, neither the compensation amount was deposited in the Court nor
any reference was made to the Court for the determination of the quantum of compensation.

However, the said writ petition was dismissed on 04.04.1996. Therefore, the petitioners made
representation to re-convey the subject land. Since, no action was taken on the representation
submitted by the petitioners, the petitioners approached this Court in W.P.No.2929 of 2003 and
this Court directed the respondents to consider their representation by an order dated 30.01.2003.
By an order dated 23.05.2003, the first respondent rejected the request made by the petitioners.
Though, the petitioners did not challenge the rejection of re-conveyance request, the petitioners
repeatedly made representations to consider their request, since, the petitioners are in possession
and enjoyment of the subject property.
4. The learned counsel for the petitioners would submit that the compensation amount admittedly
deposited only on 29.02.2012. As per Section 24(2) of the Right to Fair Compensation and
Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, the petitioners are
entitled for compensation under the 24(2) of the Right to Fair Compensation
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and
Resettlement Act, 2013, in respect of the subject property which were acquired by the respondents.

case of Indore Development Authority Vs. Manoharlal and ors etc.,
6. The second respondent filed counter and revealed that the proposal for acquisition of patta lands
to an extent of 147.16 acres in Sevvapettai Village, for the formation of Sevvapettai Railway Station

Act, 1894 was approved by the Government in G.O.No.605, dated 02.08.1984 and published on
22.08.1984. After completion of the acquisition proceedings, the award was passed by the Land
Acquisition Officer in Award No.8 of 1989 on 19.08.1989. After acquisition of the subject land and
Award dated 19.08.1989, the notice as contemplated under Section 12(2) of the Land Acquisition
Act, 1894 was served to the previous land owner thereby called upon them to receive compensation
at Rs.42,304/- (Rupees Forty Two Thousand Three Hundred and Four only).

7. Thereafter, the entire revenue records were mutated in the name of the Tamil Nadu Housing
Board and patta was also issued in Patta No.2259. Therefore, the compensation amount in respect
of the subject land is kept under the Revenue Deposit and the petitioners are at liberty to receive the
compensation from the Land Acquisition Officer on production of Documentary evidences. In fact,
the entire land which was acquired including the land comprised by the DTCP vide LP/DTCP

8. Therefore, the question of re-conveyance does not arise. In fact, already the petitioners' request
was rejected and they failed to challenge the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis same. Insofar as the
compensation in respect of the subject property is concerned, it was deposited under the Revenue
Deposit on 29.02.2012 only, though, the award was passed on 19.08.1989. The respondents also
produced the receipt for the deposit of compensation amount by the Challan No.712, dated

"4. The expression 'paid' in the main part of Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 does not
include a deposit of compensation in court. The consequence of non-deposit is
provided in proviso to Section 24(2) in case it has not been deposited with respect to
majority of land holdings then all beneficiaries (landowners) as on the date of
notification for land acquisition under Section 4 of the Act of 1894 shall be entitled to
compensation in accordance with the provisions of the Act of 2013. In case the
obligation under Section 31 of the Land Acquisition Act of 1894 has not been fulfilled,
interest under Section 34 of the said Act can be granted. Non-deposit of
compensation (in court) does not result in the lapse of land acquisition proceedings.
In case of non-deposit with respect to the majority of holdings for five years or more,
compensation under the Act of 2013 has to be paid to the "landowners" as on the date
of notification for land acquisition under Section 4 of the Act of 1894."
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
10. Accordingly, if the compensation has not been deposited, the land owners as on the date of
notification for land acquisition under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, shall be entitled
for compensation in accordance with the provisions of the 24(2) of the Right to Fair Compensation
and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013. Therefore, the
petitioners are entitled for compensation under the 24(2) of the Right to Fair Compensation and
Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, for the subject land
acquired from the petitioners.
11. In view of the above, the third respondent is directed to award compensation under the 24(2) of
the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and
Resettlement Act, 2013 for the subject property comprised in Survey No.64/1, to an extent of 0.71
