Vikramaditya Singh vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 8 July, 2019
3. The petitioner while serving as Block Development Officer, Sonahula Block in the district of
Bhagalpur was made accused in a Vigilance case vide Vigilance P. S. Case No. 71 of 2013 for the
offences under Sections 467, 468, 471, 420, 409 and 120(B) of the Indian Penal Code and Section
13(2) read with Section 13(1)(C)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. The aforesaid F.I.R.
was filed on the basis of a complaint regarding misappropriation in distribution of grants for diesel.
4. The petitioner was suspended and a departmental proceeding was initiated against him. The
Enquiry Officer submitted his report dated 29.03.2014. On the basis of the aforesaid enquiry report,
a second show-cause notice was issued to the petitioner, to which he replied in detail.
5. The Labour Commissioner, Bihar vide order dated 11.06.2014, referred to above, dismissed the
petitioner from service with immediate effect.
6. It further appears from the records that the petitioner thereafter preferred an appeal under Rule
23 of the CCA Rules of 2005 before the Departmental Secretary. On Patna High Court CWJC
No.1012 of 2017 dt.08-07-2019 22.08.2016, the petitioner was informed that the regular service
appeal preferred by him had been treated as revision under rule 28 of the CCA Rules, 2005 and was
directed to present his case before the Labour Commissioner. Consequently, the petitioner appeared
before the Labour Commissioner and pleaded his case. But the Labour Commissioner vide order
dated 01.12.2016 rejected all the submissions of the petitioner and concurred with the order of
dismissal passed by the erstwhile Labour Commissioner.
7. The orders impugned in the present petition have been challenged on several grounds. It has been
urged on behalf of the petitioner that the enquiry report was inconclusive as it did not record any
finding on the charge levelled against the petitioner. All that the enquiry report says is that the
petitioner acted in a negligent manner and therefore could be held responsible for the irregularity
only indirectly. It was therefore argued that the Enquiry Officer, who is a quasi- judicial authority
had to apply his mind independently on the basis of evidence produced in support of the charges.
Patna High Court CWJC No.1012 of 2017 dt.08-07-2019
8. It has been pointed out by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the Presenting Officer never
made himself available before the Enquiry Officer and the Enquiry Officer assumed the role of
prosecutor as well. Thus, in the event of the statutory requirements as provided under rule 17(3) to
17(6) of the 2005 Rules not having been complied with, the entire required report stands vitiated.
9. It has further been argued that the disciplinary authority came to a totally different conclusion
which is not based on the findings of the Enquiry Officer. The only evidence before the disciplinary
authority was the F.I.R. and the report of the Vigilance, which were treated as conclusive evidence
for establishing the guilt of the petitioner. Similar grounds have been raised while challenging the
order passed in appeal / revision.
10. The learned counsel for the petitioner has referred to the decisions rendered in Uday Pratap
Singh Versus State of Bihar [2017 (4) PLJR 195]; Roop Singh Negi Versus Punjab National Bank
[(2009) 2 SCC 570]; and Sharda Devi Versus The Patliputra Central Cooperative Bank [2017 (1)

PLJR Patna High Court CWJC No.1012 of 2017 dt.08-07-2019 859] and has submitted that the
enquiry report is unsustainable in the eyes of law.
11. It has further been submitted that the reply of the petitioner / delinquent has not at all been
considered by the disciplinary authority and the only basis of the disciplinary authority punishing
the petitioner is the Vigilance Case.
12. On the aforesaid grounds, it has been urged that the order of dismissal and its confirmation in
appeal / revision is bad in law and facts, and, therefore, be set aside.
13. From the perusal of the records as also the orders impugned, it appears that though the
Presenting Officer did not present himself before the Enquiry Officer; nonetheless the Enquiry
Officer analysed the materials before him and submitted his report. The impugned orders do refer to
the materials available in the record that the amount of grant for diesel has been misappropriated.
Only one beneficiary was found to be genuine of Sonahula village whereas 18 of the beneficiaries
were found to be of different locality. An amount of Rs. 9,33,348/- has been shown to have been
disbursed to persons who did not have the entitlement of receiving such Patna High Court CWJC
No.1012 of 2017 dt.08-07-2019 grant. Twenty two of the beneficiaries were found to be landless but
against their names also, it was fraudulently shown that they own lands and the grant money was
shown to be distributed to them. The persons having very small plot of land were shown to have
bigger plot of land and money was shown to be given to him. One such instance is the case of the
brother of Mukhiya who owned only 0.8 dismals of land but was shown to possess 2.40 acres.
14. The reply of the petitioner that confirmation of the beneficiaries being genuine persons was the
responsibility of Vigilance Committee of the Panchayat and not of the Block Development Officer,
was not accepted by the Enquiry Officer as also by the disciplinary and appellate authority. The
orders impugned indicate that because the Block Development Officer is the main Administrative
Officer at block level, it is squarely his responsibility to ensure that the grants-in-aid is properly
distributed. The work of supervision is of the Block Development Officer. It was also held by the
disciplinary as well as the appellate authority that in all the Vigilance Committee of the Panchayat,
the Block Development Patna High Court CWJC No.1012 of 2017 dt.08-07-2019 Officer/the
petitioner is also a Member and therefore he could not be absolved of such responsibilities. D.C. Bill
for disbursement of grant is prepared by the Block Development Officer only.
15. No doubt, there were some lapses in the proceedings before the Enquiry Officer, namely, the
Presenting Officer not showing up during the enquiry and the department not leading any evidence
to prove the charges; nonetheless the entire material on records was analyzed and it was found by
the Enquiry Officer that the petitioner was responsible for such misappropriation / irregularity
indirectly.
16. The wordings of the enquiry report have not been properly framed / drafted but the fact remains
that the Enquiry Officer, on analyzing the duties of Block Development Officer and the irregularities
which were apparent and writ large in the records, came to the conclusion that the reply of the
petitioner that he was not responsible for any misappropriation or disbursement of government

Vikramaditya Singh vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 8 July, 2019
money to undeserving persons or fraudulent withdrawal and misappropriation of government Patna
High Court CWJC No.1012 of 2017 dt.08-07-2019 money was not correct and that the petitioner was
responsible for such irregularities and misappropriation.
17. In Roop Singh Negi (supra), emphasis has been laid on the proof of the material before the
Enquiry Officer as the Enquiry Officer performs a quasi-judicial function. For proving charge, it is
not necessary that any evidence be compulsorily led. If the materials are available which could be
the basis for coming to a definite conclusion, then only because witnesses were not examined, the
entire enquiry report could not be thrown out as being bad in facts and law.
18. The submissions of the learned counsel for the petitioner is that the enquiry report and the
impugned orders are based on the vigilance case is not correct. In none of the orders is there any
reference of the vigilance case. The facts have been gleaned from the records and it has been found
that the maximum amount of grant for diesel has been shown to be given to the persons who are not
the residents of the locality or did not own land or own very small piece of land, but have been
shown to own big plots of land.
Patna High Court CWJC No.1012 of 2017 dt.08-07-2019
19. The enquiry report as well as the impugned orders take note of the aforesaid materials against
the petitioner and reflects a proper application of mind on their part. A departmental proceeding is
a quasi-judicial function in which provisions of Evidence Act are not applicable. A Court exercising
power of judicial review is no doubt entitled to consider whether the inference of misconduct of a
delinquent is on the basis of relevant piece of evidence or not but it cannot substitute its own
opinion. The Enquiry Officer as well as the disciplinary and appellate authority are required to
arrive at their own conclusion on the basis of materials which could be said to point towards the
guilt of the employee in its entirety.
20. On preponderance of probability, the Enquiry Officer has found the petitioner to be responsible
for the misappropriation, which opinion finds echo in the orders impugned.
Since the misappropriation of public money is a grave misconduct, even the quantum of punishment
cannot be said to be strikingly disproportionate on any score.
Patna High Court CWJC No.1012 of 2017 dt.08-07-2019
21. On perusal of the entire records, this Court is of the view that the Enquiry Officer has not based
his report on any extraneous materials; the enquiry has been conducted with reasonable fairness of
procedure; principles of natural justice have been followed substantially; and the order of
punishment is absolutely proportionate to the guilt. There could be no clear evidence of
misappropriation when fictitious persons are shown to be the beneficiaries of any scheme.
22. For the aforesaid reasons, no interference is required with the impugned orders.
