2. The case of the petitioner is that the properties involved in the occurrence are the ancestral
properties, that belonged to one Kumara Goundar., who is the husband of the first petitioner herein.
The properties in Survey No.350/1B, 350/1C, 350/1D, 350/1E and 350/1F were settled
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.(MD)No.20033 of 2021 in favour of the first petitioner by
her husband, through Document No. 2307/1999. With an intention to grab the property, her son -
the fifth respondent herein-Muthusamy and her grandson - the seventh respondent herein-
Selvakumar have created a settlement deed in the year 2012.
3. The first petitioner instituted a criminal case, as against the respondents 5, 7 and 8 herein, before

punishable under Sections 120B, 419, 465, 468, 471, 379 (NP) and 420 of I.P.C and the investigation
is pending. This Court in Crl.O.P.No. 15413 of 2017 has directed the police to complete the

4. The fourth petitioner - Mayilathal filed a suit for partition in O.S.No.11 of 2013, on the file of the
Sub court, Palani and that suit is still pending. The third petitioner - Srimathi filed a suit in
O.S.No.410 of 2014 before the Sub Court, Palani, for partition of the properties. An injunction order
was granted in I.A.No.563 of 2014 in O.S.No.410 of 2014, dated 20.10.2014, restricting the fifth
respondent from selling, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.(MD)No.20033 of 2021
mortgaging, leasing or creating any encumbrance in the property. Against the injunction order, the
fifth respondent settled a portion of the property, in which the third respondent and his
mother-Chellammal were residing, in favour of his son. The third respondent tried to coerce the first
petitioner to settle or sell the property. Hence, the first petitioner

2020. The petitioners herein have filed an Appeal on 23.09.2020 before the District Collector

https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.(MD)No.20033 of 2021
6. Pending investigation in Crime No.120 of 2013, by using the thumb impression of the first

name, but, without her knowledge.
7. The first petitioner filed a suit before the Additional District Court, Palani, in O.S.No.213 of 2020

8. As the respondents 3 and 4 tried to dispossess the petitioner and tried to trespass into the
undivided property, the first petitioner made an online complaint, the servant of the third
respondent was warned not to interfere in the property dispute. However, the third respondent
instigated his servant-Ramesh to file a case under the P.C.R Act, on 14.09.2020 and that case is
pending, before the Special PCR Court, Dindigul. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
Crl.O.P.(MD)No.20033 of 2021
9. The third petitioner issued a contempt notice on 28.07.2021 against the respondents 3 to 6 for
violating the injunction order in I.A.No.563 of 2014 in O.S.No.410 of 2014, on the file of the Sub
court, Palani. Suppressing all these facts, the fourth respondent filed a complaint on 22.06.2021

filed a complaint before the Collector on 09.07.2021 and on 12.07.2021 under Rule 20 of the

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/96630666/ 3
K.Chellammal vs The Revenue Divisional Officer on 2 December, 2021
of 2021 and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act. The complaint was numbered as 43 of 2021.
11. It is further stated that F.I.R in Crime No.370 of 2021 was registered under Section 145 of Cr.P.C
against the petitioners and their family members and that the second respondent referred the
matter to the first respondent under Section 145 Cr.P.C.
12. On the side of the petitioners, it is stated that without taking cognizance and without considering
the petitioners' complaint and the pendency of the civil suits and other cases, the Revenue
Divisional Officer summoned all the parties for enquiry and that the respondents 3 to 8 were
abusing the process of law, by suppressing all the documents and the injunction orders, which are
still in force. The first respondent conducted the proceedings under Section 145 Cr.P.C, in an
arbitrary manner, and she passed an order in Na.Ka.No.4456/21/A7, dated 02.12.2021, which is
contrary to law and the same is to be quashed.
13. On the side of the petitioners, it is stated that the Revenue Divisional Officer, failed to consider
that there was an injunction order in https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.(MD)No.20033 of
2021 I.A.No.563 of 2014. The Revenue Divisional Officer failed to consider that the Court has
granted injunction order against the respondents 3 and 4 and that the respondents 3 to 8 cannot
encumber the property and that they cannot take forcible possession from the first respondent and
that a false case was registered on the complaint filed by the third respondent.
14. The report of the Tahsildar was not a fully perfect report and that the report ought to have been
rejected. Copy of the report filed by the Village Administrative Officer was not furnished to the
petitioner. When a civil case is pending and when an interim order is there, there cannot be a
parallel criminal proceeding under 145 Cr.P.C. The revenue divisional officer failed to give any
findings as to the possession of the parties on the date of order. Under Section 52 of the transfer of
property Act, alienation will be hit by the doctrine of of lis pendens and that except the family
members third parties cannot participate in a partition suit. The respondents 3 and 4 as third party
purchasers cannot claim title or possession. The Revenue Divisional Officer exceeded her
jurisdiction in directing the petitioner not to interfere in the right of the third party purchasers
pending the suit.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.(MD)No.20033 of 2021
15. On the side of the petitioners, a judgment of this Court made in Crl.R.C.No.1032 of 2013, dated
25.03.2014, is cited, wherein, it is stated as follows:-
“The learned Brother Judge of our High court, in 2002-2-LW (Crl) 695 by following
the same view, held that when once the civil court had taken note of the dispute
between the parties with reference to the declaration or possession, then it is not
open to the Executive Authority to entertain any application and to invoke Section
145 Cr.P.C. Even otherwise there should be a report from the competent police officer
alleging that there was any threat to law and order or there is any possibility of
breach of peace in that area, where the immovable property is located.”

K.Chellammal vs The Revenue Divisional Officer on 2 December, 2021
16. On the side of the prosecution, it is stated that both the parties are continuously quarrelling with
each other and that resulted in law and order problems. Hence, the police referred the matter to the
R.D.O under Section 145 Cr.P.C. Both the parties were filing somany complaints against each other.
In this situation, to maintain peace and to avoid law and order problems, the R.D.O after due

added in the suit and the same cannot be taken as a ground for denying the possession of the first
petitioner.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.(MD)No.20033 of 2021
27. It is seen that the first petitioner's husband – Kumara Gounder was the original owner of the

4456/2021/A7, dated 02.12.2021, has not given any findings regarding the validity of the document
or the right of ownership or title. Considering the pendency of the civil courts, it is decided that this
Court need not go into the question of title or the validity of the title deeds.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.(MD)No.20033 of 2021
38. A Criminal case under the P.C.R. Act and Two F.I.Rs in Crime Nos.1008 of 2020 and 370 of

petitioners on 07.07.2021, 08.07.2021 and on 10.07.2021, regarding this dispute, hence, it is clear

the name of the respondents 3 and 4. Since civil cases are pending, The R.D.O has not given any
decision as to the title or possession, which is reasonable. Copies of the revenue records were filed in
the typed set. From the records it is clear that multi number of civil cases and criminal complaints
filed by the petitioners and the respondents against each other are pending and hence to maintain
law and order the steps taken by the R.D.O. is reasonable.
40. Considering that the residence of the respondents 3 and 4 as mentioned in O.S.No.213 of 2020
and considering the prayer for https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.(MD)No.20033 of 2021

respondents 3 and 4, without prejudice to the civil cases, it is decided that the decision of the R.D.O
is reasonable.
