Thangjam Mohendro Singh vs Thokchom Lokeshwar Singh on 27 September, 2024
[2] Heard Mr. A. Mohendro, learned counsel for the applicant/election petiitoner and Mr. N.
Ibotombi, learned senior counsel assisted by Ms. N. Savitri, learned counsel for the respondent
No.1/returned candidate.
[3] In the application it is stated that respondent No.1 has filed written statement to the Election
Petition No.29 of 2022 and after perusal of the contentions made in the written statement, it has
been noticed that certain plea has been taken by Respondent No.1 for establishing his contentions
and for negating the case set up by the Applicant/Election Petitioner and the same need to be
replied and clarified by way of filing subsequent pleading for determining the issues in the Election
Petition No.29 of 2022.
[4] Respondent No.1 filed written objection to the instant application. The provision under which
the present application is filed is not applicable and as such, the application is not maintainable and
liable to be dismissed. It is also stated that if the application is allowed, it may amount to
introducing new facts and the same is not permissible by law.
[5] In support of his argument, Mr. A. Mohendro, learned counsel for the applicant relied on the
decisions of Rajasthan High Court in the case of (1) Gurjant Singh Vs Krishan Chander & Ors:
(2000) AIHC 3848, (2) Kalyan Mal Mina Vs Ratan Lal Tambi: (1981) AIR (Raj) 249 to emphasise
the point that the provisions of CPC including the provisions of Order 8 Rule 9 will be applicable in
an election petition in terms of provisions of Section 87 of RP Act.
[6] Mr. N. Ibotombi, learned senior counsel for the respondent also placed his reliance on the
decision of this Court in the case of Thangjam Mohendro Singh Vs Thokchom Lokeshwar Singh in
MC (E.P.) No.23 of 2017 Ref: Election Petition 3 of 2017 [Judgment Dated 05.07.2019]. Referring to
various case laws of the Hon'ble Apex Court, it was held that the application under Order 8 Rule 9
CPC cannot be treated as one under Order 6 Rule 17 CPC. In the guise of filing subsequent pleading,
incorporation of new plea cannot be introduced so as to change the nature of the case.
[7] Learned senior counsel draws the attention of this Court to the proposed replication/subsequent
pleading of the election petitioner specially the contents of para 5 to 9 where the petitioner has
disputed the settled fact of adoption in earlier judicial proceeding for the first time in the replication.
It is pointed such a plea has been mentioned in the election petition. This amounts to amendment of
the election petition by introducing new plea of disputing the adoption of the returned candidate.
The election result of the returned candidate was declared on 10.03.2022 and the replication was
filed on 25.11.2022, ie, after 200 days of the declaration of the result. It is submitted that such as
application is barred by combined reading of the provisions of Sections 87, 81 and 83 of RP Act and
Order 8 Rule 9 CPC. Any amendment of election petition beyond 45 days is not permissible that too
introducing new material facts. It is reiterated that the application under Order 8 Rule 9 CPC is
nothing but an application under Order 6 Rule 17. It is prayed that the application be rejected with
heavy cost. [8] It is the settled principle of law that new plea to change the nature of the case cannot
be introduced by way of amendment or in form of subsequent plea. The salutary provisions of Order
8 Rule 9 and Order 6 Rule 17 are aimed to facilitate in arriving a correct decision based on relevant
facts. However, such provisions cannot introduce altogether new facts to change the nature of

Thangjam Mohendro Singh vs Thokchom Lokeshwar Singh on 27 September, 2024
dispute. In election petition, any introduction of new material facts is to be made within 45 days'
time limit fixed by Section 81 of RP Act, if the same is permissible. [9] On perusal of contents of para
5 to 9 of the replication proposed to be filed by the election petition, it is seen that new material facts
disputing the adoption of the returned candidate have been raised for the first time. Such facts have
not been averred in the petition. Moreover, this Court, as election tribunal, has no jurisdiction to
examine the factum of adoption of the returned candidate which fact that has already been accepted
in earlier judicial proceedings. By the present replication, the election petitioner has introduced new
material facts in the petition and the same is not permissible in view of the clear provisions of
Sections 81, 83 and 87 of RP Act read with Order 8 Rule 9 and Order 6 Rule 17 CPC.
[10] Accordingly, the application being MC(EP) No. 208 of 2022 is rejected with a cost of Rs.
10,000/- (Rupees ten thousand) only to be deposited in favour of High Court Legal Services
Committee. Election petitioner is to submit proof of deposit of the cost before the next date.
[11] List election petition No. 29 of 2022 along with the pending applications on 10.10.2024 for
further proceedings.
