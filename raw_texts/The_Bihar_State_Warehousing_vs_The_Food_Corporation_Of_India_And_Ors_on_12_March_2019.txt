CORAM: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE

HONOURABLE JUSTICE SMT. ANJANA MISHRA
ORAL JUDGMENT
(Per: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE) Date : 12-03-2019 The appellant- Bihar State
Warehousing Corporation has questioned the impugned judgement of the learned Single Judge
dated 2nd of July, 2018 contending that the learned Single Judge has erroneously allowed the writ
petition for making payment to Patna High Court L.P.A No.1071 of 2018 dt.12-03-2019 the
respondents-petitioners-contractors whereas no such liability can be fixed on the appellant-

Corporation as it is only a facilitator under an agreement to enable the transportation to be carried
out for handling the essential commodities of the Food Corporation of India. The payment for such
handling has to be made by the Food Corporation of India and the appellant-Corporation for such
negotiation and settlement is entitled for a certain amount of percentage as commission thereon.
The Contractors in case of any non-payment have to claim their liability against the Food
Corporation of India under the terms of the agreement.
It is admitted that the agreement is between the appellant- Corporation and the Contractors to
which the Food Corporation of India is not a party. Any dispute arising between the Contractors and
the appellant-Corporation arising out of the terms of the agreement has to be referred to an
Arbitrator, but in the present case, it appears that in the absence of any available Contractor, no
formal agreement could be executed and it was by way of a negotiation that the Contractors were
allowed to do the work at the rates that were permissible in relation to the center at Giridih.
The Food Corporation of India filed a counter affidavit in the writ petition and it came up with a plea
that it had agreed to Patna High Court L.P.A No.1071 of 2018 dt.12-03-2019 pay the new rates only
up till 7th of May, 2011 or till a new Contractor is appointed, whichever is earlier. This letter dated
26 th April, 2011 was filed as Annexure-J to the third supplementary counter affidavit of the Food
Corporation of India filed before the Writ Court. It is thus evident that the payment at new rates was
available from the Food Corporation of India only up to 7 th of May, 2011 and not beyond that. The
said letter dated 26th April, 2011 was nowhere questioned either by the appellants or by the
Contractors. In that view of the matter, we are of the considered opinion that there was no liability
on the Food Corporation of India to make any such payment at the new rates.
The respondents-petitioners-Contractors filed the writ petition taking their claim against the
appellant-Corporation. We fail to understand that if the payments have not to be made by the Food
Corporation of India, then under what capacity or liability will the appellants be liable to make any
such deficit good as claimed by the appellants. We are apprehensive that it is quite possible that the
appellants and the respondents-petitioners were in hands-in-gloves with each other in generating
this litigation in order to claim higher rates as both of them would be benefited, the
respondents-Contractors by getting higher payments and the appellant-Corporation getting more
commission out of the Patna High Court L.P.A No.1071 of 2018 dt.12-03-2019 enhanced amount.
This, therefore, is more in the nature of a proxy litigation and consequently, we do not find this to be
a bonafide claim of interest raised by the respondents-petitioners in the background aforesaid.
Apart from this, such a money claim which becomes highly disputed keeping in view the letter dated
26 th April, 2011 has completely escaped the notice of the learned Single Judge who has allowed the
writ petition as if there was no dispute about the payments. The controversy, therefore, does not
appear to have been construed and appreciated in the background of the aforesaid facts as a result
whereof the impugned judgment erroneously proceeds to allow the claim of the
respondents-petitioners.
We are, therefore, of the considered opinion that the impugned judgement cannot be sustained and
accordingly, the judgement and order dated 2nd of July, 2018 is set aside. The appeal is accordingly

allowed and the writ petition bearing Civil Writ Jurisdiction Case No.6891 of 2013 stands dismissed.
However, the appellants contend that if the respondents- petitioners are entitled for any such claim
against the appellants, it is open to them to raise an arbitration dispute or raise a claim in
accordance with law. In the event, any such claim is raised against Patna High Court L.P.A No.1071
of 2018 dt.12-03-2019 the appellants, the dismissal of the writ petition and allowing of this appeal
would not be an impediment.
