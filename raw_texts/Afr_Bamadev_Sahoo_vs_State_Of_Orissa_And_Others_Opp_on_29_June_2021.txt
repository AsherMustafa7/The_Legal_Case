P R E S E N T:
THE HONOURABLE DR. JUSTICE B.R.SARANGI DECIDED ON : 29.06.2021 DR. B.R. SARANGI,
J. The petitioner, who was working as Asst.
Teacher, by means of this writ petition, seeks direction to the opposite parties for inclusion of his
name in the draft gradation list dated 01.09.2012, which was // 2 // prepared by opposite party
no.3-District Inspector of Schools, Angul with a further prayer to quash the said draft gradation list.
2. The factual matrix of the case, in brief, is that the petitioner, by following due procedure of
selection, was appointed as Asst. Teacher by the District Selection Committee and posted in
Gopinathpur Lower Primary School, vide letter dated 22.09.1981 issued by the District Inspector of
Schools, Angul-opposite party no.3, pursuant to which he joined on 26.09.1981. While so
continuing, he acquired B.Ed. qualification on 1985 and became Trained Graduate from the date of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122320007/ 1
Afr Bamadev Sahoo vs State Of Orissa And Others ..... Opp. ... on 29 June, 2021
acquisition of such qualification. By office order dated 21.01.1989 issued by the District Inspector of
Schools, Dhenkanal, the petitioner was placed on deputation to Samal Barrage U.P. School under
Angul Education District. Pursuant to such order, the petitioner was relived from the control of
District Inspector of Schools, // 3 // Dhenkanal and joined in Samal Barrage U.P. School on
01.02.1989 under the District Inspector of Schools, Angul, Orissa.
2.1 In order to regulate the method of recruitment and conditions of service of Teachers of
Elementary Education, a set of Rule was framed in exercise of power conferred by the proviso to
Article 309 of the Constitution of India, which came into force with effect from 18.12.1997 called as
"The Orissa Elementary Education (Method of Recruitment and Conditions of Service of Teachers
and Officers) Rules, 1997 (hereinafter referred to as "Rules, 1997"). As per the said Rules, 1997, the
post of Asst. Teachers of Govt. Primary and Upper Primary Schools belonged to Level-V. As the
petitioner was working as Asst. Teacher in a Govt. Primary School, he was to be encadred in Level-V
of Elementary Education Service. Rule-15 of the Rules, 1997 deals with seniority and preparation of
gradation // 4 // lists. All Asst. Teachers of Government Primary and Upper Primary Schools shall
be treated as Level-V from the date of commencement of the said Rules, as per Explanation-I to
Rule-15, and the seniority of such Asst. Teachers shall be determined with reference to the date of
their appointment as such.
2.2 The opposite party no.2-Director, Elementary Education, Odisha, on 01.09.2012, published a
draft gradation list of Level-V teachers having B.Ed. qualification as on that date. But, in the said
draft gradation list, the petitioner's name was not enlisted, taking into consideration his date of
joining as 26.09.1981. Therefore, he submitted an objection on 11.09.2012 specifically indicating
therein that he having appointed as regular Asst. Teacher in Government Primary School on
22.09.1981 pursuant to which he joined on 26.09.1981, as per the stipulation made in Rule-15 of the
Rules, 1997, his seniority ought to have // 5 // been taken into account treating his date of
appointment as 22.09.1981. On receipt of such objection dated 11.09.2012, the Director of
Elementary Education, Odisha, vide his office order dated 24.09.2012 directed the District Inspector
of Schools, Angul to furnish a detailed report along with the specific views and all supporting
documents within a fortnight for further course of action. As no action was taken at his end, the
Director, Elementary Education, Odisha-opposite party no.2, vide its letter dated 30.11.2012,
directed the District Inspector Schools, Angul-opposite party no.3 to send a clear report in detail
informing that the petitioner's name was included in the gradation list or not. But, without
responding to the same, the opposite party no.3-District Inspector of Schools, Angul proceeded to
effect promotions from Level-V to Level-IV from out of the said draft gradation list causing
prejudice to the petitioner. Aggrieved thereby, the petitioner filed O.A. No. 4118(C) of 2012 before
the Orissa Administrative // 6 // Tribunal, Cuttack Bench, Cuttack, but on the abolition of the
tribunal, the said original application has been transferred to this Court, pursuant to order dated
03.01.2020 passed by a Division Bench of this Court in W.P.(C) No. 26976 of 2019, and registered
as writ petition.
3. Mr. H.P. Rath, learned counsel for the petitioner did not press the second limb of the prayer with
regard to quashing of draft gradation list prepared by opposite party no.3-District Inspector of
Schools, Angul, and contended that the authorities, by not considering the objection raised by the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122320007/ 2
Afr Bamadev Sahoo vs State Of Orissa And Others ..... Opp. ... on 29 June, 2021
petitioner in proper perspective, have acted arbitrarily and unreasonably, and that on the basis of
the draft gradation list, if promotions are effected from Level-V to Level-IV to the prejudice of the
petitioner, the same cannot sustain in the eye of law. It is further contended that if the statutory
rules prescribed a thing to be done // 7 // in a particular manner, the same has to be adhered to in
the same manner. When Explanation-I to Rule-15 of the Rules, 1997, unambiguously prescribes that
the seniority of the petitioner shall be determined with reference to the date of his appointment, the
petitioner, having been appointed as Asst. Teacher on 22.09.1981, his seniority should have been
fixed accordingly. This position has been settled by this Court in W.P.(C) No. 14979 of 2010 and
batch disposed of on 23.12.20211 and while interpreting the provisions of Exaplanation-1 to Rule-15
of Rules, 1997, this Court held that on the basis of initial date of appointment seniority is to be fixed.
In view of the ratio decided in the said case, since the petitioner's date of appointment was
22.09.1981, his name should have found place in the gradation list prepared by the authority.
Non-inclusion of his name in the draft gradation list prepared by the authority is arbitrary,
unreasonable and contrary to the provisions of law.
// 8 //
4. Mr. S. Jena, learned Standing Counsel for School and Mass Education Department contended
that the petitioner has not filed the draft gradation list dated 01.09.2012 along with the writ petition
and, as such, in absence of the draft gradation list, the present case cannot be decided.
Consequentially, the writ petition is not maintainable and has to be dismissed in limine. It is further
contended that the petitioner was appointed as Asst. Teacher and posted in Gopinathpur Lower
Primary School, pursuant to the office order dated 22.09.1981 passed by the District Inspector of
Schools, Angul and at that time the teachers of Primary Schools were not being treated as Govt.
Servants and their services were only taken over by the Government in the year 1989. Therefore, the
petitioner's claim for inclusion of his name in the draft gradation list from the date of his
appointment in the service, w.e.f. 22.09.1981 cannot sustain in the eye of law and, as such, the writ
petition is liable to be dismissed.
// 9 //
5. This Court heard Mr. A.K. Behra, learned counsel for the petitioner and Mr. S. Jena, learned
Standing Counsel for School and Mass Education Department through virtual mode, and perused
the record. Pleadings having been exchanged between the parties and with the consent of the
learned counsel for the parties, this writ petition is being disposed of finally at the stage of
admission.
6. For just and proper adjudication of the case, Rule-3 (1), (2)(i)(ii) and Rule-15(1)(a),(b) and (c) and
Explanation-I of Rules, 1997, are quoted below:
"3. Constitution of Service- (1) The Service shall comprise of the following levels,
namely,
(i) The Odisha Elementary Education Service, Level-V;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122320007/ 3
Afr Bamadev Sahoo vs State Of Orissa And Others ..... Opp. ... on 29 June, 2021
(ii) The Odisha Elementary Education Service, Level-IV;
(iii) The Odisha Elementary Education Service, Level-III;
(iv) The Odisha Elementary Education Service, Level-II;
(v) The Odisha Elementary Education Service, Level-I
(vi) The Odisha Elementary Education Service, Level-l (Senior) (2) (i) The Odisha
Elementary Education Service, Level-V shall consist of the Post of Assistant Teachers
of Government Primary Schools and // 10 // Assistant Teachers of Government
Upper Primary Schools.
(ii) The Odisha Elementary Education Service, Level-V shall consist of the posts of
Headmasters/Headmistress of Government Primary Schools.
xx xx xx
15. Seniority and gradation list - (1)(a) The District Education Officer of the
concerned Education Districts shall maintain gradating list separately for the posts
belonging to Level-V, Level-IV and Level-III of the Service strictly on the basis of
Seniority.
(b) The gradation list of incumbents of the above mentioned levels shall be updated
by 15th July of every year.
(c) The District Education Officer shall invite objections by the 15th June before
finalization of the gradation list and thereafter final gradation list shall be published
by the 15th July of every year."
xx xx xx Explanation-I- All persons now working as regular Assistant Teachers of
Government Primary and Upper Primary Schools shall be treated as Members of
Level-V of the Service from the date of commencement of these Rules.
The seniority of such persons shall be determined with reference to the date of their appointment as
such.
xx xx xx On perusal of the above mentioned rules, it is made clear that the Odisha Elementary
Education Service Level-V consists of the posts of Assistant Teachers of Government // 11 //
Primary Schools and Assistant Teachers of Government Upper Primary Schools. For the purpose of
implementation of Rule-15, the District Inspector of Schools of the concerned Education District
shall maintain gradation list separately for the posts belonging to Level-V, Level-IV and Level-III of
the Service strictly on the basis of seniority. As per Explanation-I, the persons those who are regular
Assistant Teachers of Government Primary and Upper Primary Schools shall be treated as Members
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122320007/ 4
Afr Bamadev Sahoo vs State Of Orissa And Others ..... Opp. ... on 29 June, 2021
of Level-V of the service from the date of commencement of the rules and the seniority of such
persons shall be determined with reference to the date of their appointment as such. Thereby, the
rule is very clear that the seniority has to be determined with reference to the date of appointment.
7. On the basis of the factual matrix delineated above, there is no dispute that the petitioner has
been issued with an appointment letter on // 12 // 22.09.1981, by following due procedure of
selection, by the District Selection Committee. In pursuance thereof, the petitioner joined on
26.09.1981. As such, he was appointed as an Assistant Teacher giving posting in Gopinathpur Lower
Primary School. Therefore, applying the rules applicable to the petitioner, as an Asst. Teacher, his
seniority should have been fixed in Level-V category on the basis of the Explanation-I to Rule-15 of
the Rules, 1997 from the date of his initial appointment, i.e. from 22.09.1981. This fact is evident
from the service book of the petitioner, which has been annexed as Annexure-2 to the writ petition,
wherein it has been specifically mentioned that "Appointed as primary school teacher vide order no.
3752 dt.22.09.81 of the D.I. of Schools, Angul." and the same has been duly endorsed by the
competent authority. While so continuing, pursuant to letter dated 18.01.1989 of the Director of
Elementary Education, Odisha, which was communicated vide letter dated 21.01.1989 of the
Inspector of Schools, Dhenkanal // 13 // Circle, he was deputed to Samal Barrage U.P. School to act
as such in the old scale of pay without deputation allowance. Therefore, lien of the petitioner was
continuing in his original post subject to deputation to new place of posting at Samal Barrage UP
School. When the draft gradation list was prepared by the Director Elementary Education, Odisha
and the name of the petitioner did not find place in the same, he filed objection vide Annexure-4
series enclosing the relevant documents. The same was attended to and the Deputy Director of
Elementary Education, Odisha called upon the District Inspector of Schools, Angul to furnish a
detailed report along with his specific views and all supporting documents to the Directorate within
fortnight through a special messenger for taking further course of action at their end, but the same
was not acted upon. Again, the Executive Engineer, Head Works Division, Samal Barrage provided
the original service book of the petitioner to the District Inspector of Schools, Angul.
// 14 // Thereafter, on 30.11.2012, the Deputy Director, Elementary Education, Odisha again issued
a letter to the District Inspector of Schools, Angul to furnish a report as to whether the name of the
petitioner has been included in the gradation list or not, if not, the reasons along with his specific
views in the matter be furnished to the Directorate by 03.12.2012. In response to same, the District
Inspector of Schools, Angul furnished a report to the Director, Elementary Education, Odisha,
Bhubaneswar stating inter alia that the petitioner, who was working as Asst. Teacher in
Chhendipada Primary School under Angul Education District, was deputed to Samal Barrage U.P.
School vide order dated 18.01.1989 of the Director, Elementary, Education, Odisha, Bhubaneswar,
which was communicated vide memo no.1353 dated 21.01.1989 of the Inspector of Schools,
Dhenkanal Circle, Dhenkanal. The Block Development Officer, Angul was informed, vide office
memo no. 588 dated 28.01.1989, to relieve the petitioner. Being relieved // 15 // by the B.D.O.,
Angul, the petitioner was working at Samal Barrage UP School on deputation. After his joining, he
has not applied to any authority for cancellation of his deputation and also provided the original
service book to the Director. This clearly indicates that the petitioner was continuing as Asst.
Teacher in Chhendipada Primary School and his services were placed on deputation to Samal
Barrage U.P. School. Therefore, the question of his application for cancellation of deputation, as
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122320007/ 5
Afr Bamadev Sahoo vs State Of Orissa And Others ..... Opp. ... on 29 June, 2021
stated by the District Inspector of Schools, was not required. But that does not mean, his lien from
Chhendipada Primary School to Samal Barrage School on deputation has been ceased.
8. In paragraphs-5 and 6 of the counter affidavit filed by opposite party no.3, it has been specifically
stated as follows:
"5. That while the applicant was working as such, he was deputed the Samal Barrage
U.P. School vide Order No. 1695 dtd.18.01.1989 of the Director of Elementary
Education, Orissa, Bhubaneswar communicated vide Memo No. // 16 // 1353
dtd.21.01.1989 of the Inspector of Schools, Dhenkanal Circle, Dhenkanal, the B.D.O.,
Angul was informed to leave the Teacher vide Memo No.588 dtd.28.01.1989 and
being relieved by the B.D.O. has been working at Samal Barrage School and after his
joining he should have applied the authority for cancellation of his deputation and
when he was deputed to the Samal Barrage UP School the statute of the School was a
Non-Govt. Primary School.
6. That, after the services of the teachers of Primary Schools were taken over by the
Govt. in the year 1989 such teachers are being treated as Govt. Servants w.e.f. the
date of such taken over for all purposes. But the present applicant continued in the
Samal Barrage UP School which is under the administrative Control of Executive
Engineer, Head Works Division, Samal Barrage and he did not opt to come back to
his parent school before services of such teachers working in non Govt. Primary
Schools were taken over the Govt. and even after such taken over the Govt,. the
present petitioner did not take any steps for coming back to his parent post and after
a hiatus of more than 23 years he approached portals of this Hon'ble Tribunal for
inclusion of his name in the gradation list prepared by the D.I. of Schools, Angul of
Level-V teachers which is gross barred by limitation and the applicant without
coming back to the Department again prayed for inclusion in the gradation list which
is only consequential to his return to the department."
So far as contention raised, that the petitioner, whose services were placed on deputation, should
have applied for cancellation of the same, no where it has been provided for. When the authority
required his services to // 17 // be placed on deputation to Samal Barrage School and he was
continuing there with the knowledge of the authority concerned, if the services of the petitioner were
required, the authority could have brought him to the original cadre, and accordingly when the draft
gradation list was prepared his lien with the original circle being continued, his name should have
been placed in the draft gradation list, even though his services were placed on deputation to the
borrowing authority.
9. In response to the counter affidavit filed by the opposite party no.3, the petitioner filed rejoinder
affidavit, in paragraph-4 whereof it has been stated as follows:
"4. That, in reply to the Paragraph -5 and 6 of the counter affidavit filed by the
opposite party no.3 are not correct. It is humbly submitted that by virtue of the order
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122320007/ 6
Afr Bamadev Sahoo vs State Of Orissa And Others ..... Opp. ... on 29 June, 2021
of the then Inspector of Schools, Dhenkanal the petitioner was deputed to Samal
Barrage Upper Primary School and at no point of time he was permanently absorbed
in Samal Barrage U.P. school not his lien in Angul District Education Cadre was
suspended // 18 // and as such while on deputation till retain lien in his parent
cadre. As a matter of act after filing of Original Application the Block Education
Officer cancel the deputation of the petitioner vide dated 09.09.2014 and consonance
there of the petitioner has been relieved w.e.f. 15.10.2014 from Samal Barrage U.P.
School by the Executive Engineer Samal by virtue of office order dated 12.09.2014
and accordingly the petitioner has joined in Chhendiapada Primary School under
Block Education Officer Angul on 16.10.2014. This proves that the petitioner has lien
in his cadre of Angul Education District throughout and there was no reason why his
name shall not find place in gradation list of Level-V teachers of erstwhile Deputy
Inspector of Schools, Angul. Thus, the name of the petitioner is liable to be included
in the gradation list of Level-V teachers of Angul Education District prepared and
published on 01.09.2012 at appropriate place treating the initial date of joining as
26.09.1981 for all purposes with consequential service benefit of promotion from the
date of promotion of his juniors."
On perusal of the above, it is made clear that though the petitioner was deputed to Samal Barrage
UP School, he had never been permanently absorbed in the said school and his lien had been
continuing with Angul District Education Cadre. But fact remains, after filing the original
application, the Block Education Officer // 19 // cancelled the deputation of the petitioner on
09.09.2014, pursuant to which he was relieved w.e.f. 15.10.2015 from Samal Barrage UP School by
the Executive Engineer, Samal Barrage, by virtue of the office order dated 12.09.2015. Accordingly,
the petitioner joined in Chhendipada Primary School under Block Education Officer, Angul on
16.09.2014. Thereby, it is made clear that his lien with parent education district was continuing,
pursuant to which he had been allowed to join in Chhendipada Primary School, wherefrom he was
placed on deputation to Samal Barrage UP School. Therefore, the petitioner's name should have
been included in the draft gradation list prepared by opposite party no. 3 with all consequential
benefits.
10. In Triveni Shankar Saxena v State of U.P., 1992 Supp (1) SCC 524: AIR 1992 SC 496, the apex
Court held that the word "lien" originally means "binding"
// 20 // from the latin "ligament" and its lexical meaning was "right to retain".
11. While considering Rule-9(13) of the Fundamental Rules, it provides as follows:
"Lien means the title of a Government servant to hold substantively, either
immediately or on the termination of a period or periods of absence, a permanent
post, including a tenure post, to which he has been appointed substantively."
12. The apex Court in Parshotam Lal Dhingra v. Union of India, AIR 1958 SC 36, the apex Court held
as follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122320007/ 7
Afr Bamadev Sahoo vs State Of Orissa And Others ..... Opp. ... on 29 June, 2021
"A substantive appointment to a permanent post in public service confers normally
on the servant so appointed a substantive right to the post and he becomes entitled to
hold a "lien" on the post. This "lien" is defined in Fundamental Rules, section III, Ch
II, Rule 9(13) as the title of a Government servant to hold substantively a permanent
post, including a tenure post, to which he has been appointed substantively."
Therefore, the apex Court in Ramal Khurana v. State of Punjab, (1989) 4 SCC 99, held that "Lien"
connotes the right of a civil servant to hold the post substantively to which he is appointed. It is an
incident of substantive // 21 // appointment to a post. It is basically a singular concept since in
public services substantive appointment is made against a particular post.
13. In Haribans Misra v. Railway Board, (1989) 2 SCC 84, the apex Court pointed out that only when
a person was appointed on a permanent basis could he claim lien on the post to which he is so
appointed.
14. Applying the principles of "lien", as discussed above, there is no dispute that the petitioner had
been appointed against the permanent post and his services had been placed on deputation to Samal
Barrage U.P. School. Thereby, his "lien" was continuing against substantive post at Chhendipada
Upper Primary School and when he had been withdrawn from deputation, his services were placed
at the very same School. In view of this, the petitioner's name should have been included in the
gradation list as per Explanation-I to Rule-15 of // 22 // Rules, 1997 taking into account his date of
appointment as 22.09.1981.
15. It is apt to refer here the legal maxim "Expressio Unius est exclusion alterius" i.e. if a statute
provides for a thing to be done in a particular manner, then it has to be done in that manner and any
other manner are barred.
16. In Nazir Ahmed v. King Emperor, AIR 1936 PC 253, law is well settled "where a power is given to
do a certain thing in a certain way the thing must be done in that way or not at all. Other methods of
performance are necessarily forbidden." The said principles have been followed subsequently in
State of Uttar Pradesh v. Singhara Singh, AIR 1964 SC 358, Dhananjay Reddy v. State of Karnataka,
AIR 2001 SC 1512, Chandra Kishore Jha v. Mahabir Prasad, AIR 1999 SC 3558, Gujrat Urja Vikas
Nigam Ltd. v. Essar Power Ltd., // 23 // AIR 2008 SC 1921, Ram Deen Maurya v. State of U.P.,
(2009) 6 SCC 735.
17. In Subash Chandra Nayak v. Union of India, 2016 (I) OLR 922, similar question had come up for
consideration before this Court and this Court in paragraph-8 observed as follows:
".............the statute prescribed a thing to be done in a particular manner, the same
has to adhered to in the same manner or not at all. The origin of the Rule is traceable
to the decision in Taylor v. Tailor, (1875) LR I Ch D 426, which was subsequently
followed by Lord Roche in Nazir Ahmad v. King Emperor, AIR 1936 PC 253(2). But
the said principle has been well recognized and holds the field till today in Babu
Verghese v. Bar Council of Kerala (1999) 3 SCC 422, and Zuari Cement Limited v.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/122320007/ 8
Afr Bamadev Sahoo vs State Of Orissa And Others ..... Opp. ... on 29 June, 2021
Regional Director, Employees' State insurance Corporation, Hyderabad and others,
(2015) 7 SCC 690 and the said principles has been referred to by this Court in
Manguli Behera v. State of Odisha and others (W.P.(C) No. 21999 of 2014 disposed of
on 10.03.2016)".
This view has also been taken in Rudra Prasad Sarangi v. State of Orissa and others, 2021 (I) OLR
844.
// 24 //
18. Keeping in view the factual scenario and propositions of law, as discussed above, the opposite
parties no. 2 and 3 are directed to fix seniority of the petitioner, as per Explanation-I to Rule-15 of
Rules, 1997, in the draft gradation list dated 01.09.2012 published by opposite party no.3, taking
into account his date of appointment as 22.09.1981, and extend all consequential benefits, as due
and admissible to him in accordance with law as expeditiously as possible, preferably within a
period of three months from the date of communication of this judgment.
19. In the result, the writ petition is allowed. However, there shall be no order as to costs.
As the restrictions due to resurgence of COVID-19 situation are continuing, learned counsel for the
parties may utilize a printout of the judgment available in the High Court's website, at par with
certified copy, subject to attestation by the concerned advocate, in // 25 // the manner prescribed
