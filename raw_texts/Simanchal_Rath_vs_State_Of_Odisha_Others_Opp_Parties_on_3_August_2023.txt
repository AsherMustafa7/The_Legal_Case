A.K. Mohapatra, J. :
1. Heard Mr. S. Senapati, learned counsel for the Petitioner as well as Mr. S. Das, learned Addl.
Government Advocate for the State-Opposite Parties and Mr. A.R. Mishra, learned counsel for the
O.P. Nos.3 & 4. Perused the pleadings of the parties as well as documents annexed thereto.
2. The present writ application has been filed by the petitioner with the following prayer:-
"It is, therefore, humbly prayed that this Hon'ble Court may graciously be pleased to
issue Rule NISI // 2 // calling upon the Opp. Parties to show cause as to why
appropriate writ/writs shall not be issued directing them to allow the petitioner to
change his option from CPF to Pension Scheme in view of the Statute-289 and the

pass any appropriate order as deemed just and proper."
3. It is submitted by learned counsel for the Petitioner that the Odisha University First Statute, 1990
was introduced for the first time in the year 1990 and in view of Rule 288 of the said Rules, the
employees retiring on or after the 1st April, 1990 shall be entitled either to the benefit of the pension
scheme as applicable to the State Govt. employees as amended from time to time or to the benefits
of the Contributory Provident Fund (CPF) of the University in the event the employee concerned
opts for the same. Statute 289 (1) provides that the existing employees who have not already
exercised their option under the First Statute shall exercise their option in writing either for the
pension scheme or for the Contributory Provident Fund under Statute 288 within a period of six
months from the date the first statute of the university came into force.
4. It was also contended by learned counsel for the Petitioner that the employees recruited
thereafter to the University service shall exercise their option either for the pension (GPF) or for // 3
// Contributory Provident Fund (CPF) scheme within six months from the date of their
appointment. Drawing attention to the Statute 289(3), learned counsel for the petitioner further
contended that the same provides if any employee fails to exercise the option as required under the
aforesaid statute within the prescribed time limit, the employee shall be deemed to have opted for
the pension scheme. Thus, it was argued before this Court that in the event the employee fails to opt
for the CPF Scheme it will be presumed the employee has opted for the pension scheme and
accordingly his claims shall be processed.
5. Learned counsel for the Petitioner at this juncture also contended that so far the present
petitioner is concerned it is his admitted case that he has not opted for either the CPF or GPF
Scheme within the stipulated period of time i.e. from 01.01.1990 to 30.06.1990. In the said context,
learned counsel for the Petitioner refers to the letter of the Berhampur University dated 22.03.2016
under Annexure-14 which has been obtained under the provisions of the RTI Act.
6. Learned counsel appearing for the Berhampur University, on the other hand, submitted that the
petitioner had opted for CPF Scheme on 18.04.1989 prior to the university first statute came into
force in the year 1990. He further submitted that on the basis of // 4 // such exercise option by the
petitioner, the university had already processed the files and the petitioner was kept under the CPF
Scheme. Therefore, it was submitted that since the petitioner has already opted for the CPF Scheme
there was no scope on the part of the university to change option and bring the petitioner under the
pension scheme. He also referred to the letter of the State Government filed as Annexure-D/2 by
way of additional affidavit. Referring to the context of the letter under Annexure-D/2, learned
counsel for the Berhampur University submitted that the State Government has taken a decision
that the decision of the syndicate of the University dated 30.08.1997 is beyond the scope of the first
statute. Further, on perusal of the said letter dated 23.03.2011 under Annexure-D/3 to the affidavit
of the Opposite Party Nos.3 and 4, it appears that the State Government has opined that the change
of option from CPF to Pension scheme be carried out as per the provisions contained in statute
289(1) of the Odisha University first statute, 1990.

7. It is further contended by learned counsel for the Berhampur University that a new chapter was
added to the Berhampur University statute 1966 on 28.05.1985 providing for an opportunity to the
employees to exercise their option to either opt for the CPF scheme or for the pension scheme. He
further // 5 // contended that once such an option is exercised the same shall be finally.
Accordingly, he also submitted that such option shall be exercised within six months from the date
of the First Statute of the university was amended, failing which it will be deemed that the petitioner
has opted for the CPF scheme. Learned counsel for the University further contended that the
petitioner having not exercised any option within the prescribed period of six months in view of the
amendment to the University statute in 1985, it was deemed that he had exercised the option to
remain under CPF scheme. He further contended that the prior to 28.05.1985 there was no
provision for pension scheme for the employees of the University.
8. It was also contended by learned counsel for the University that on 19.11.1988 the Odisha
University employees condition of service statute, 1988 came into force. The said statute governs the
service condition of university employees including that of the Berhampur University. Under Statute
36 (1) (2) of the aforesaid statute, it is provided that an employee is to exercise option as to whether
he desires to remain under CPF scheme or pension scheme and such exercise of option by the
employee shall be final. He further contended that accordingly the petitioner exercise his option on
18.04.1989 thereby choosing to remain under CPF scheme and // 6 // on the exercise such option,
the university has accepted the petitioner's option and accordingly the same has been recorded in
the service book of the petitioner. It was contended by learned counsel for the University that after
the first statute of odisha university, 1990 came into force, the petitioner had also exercise his option
on 10.11.1993 to remain under the CPF scheme and such exercise of option was also accepted by the
University and the same has been recorded in his service book.
9. Learned Addl. Government Advocate appearing on behalf of the State-Opposite Parties adopted
the argument advanced by learned counsel appearing for the Opposite Party Nos.3 and 4-
University. He further contended that having exercised the option once, further exercise of option to
remain under the CPF scheme it is no more available to the petitioner to opt for the pension scheme.
He further contended that the University is the authority before whom the petitioner is required to
submit his option and accordingly on the basis of the option exercise by the petitioner, the university
concerned has made an entry in the service book of the Petitioner and accordingly, the case of the
petitioner has been processed on that basis.
10. Learned Addl. Government Advocate drawing attention of this Court to para-6 of the counter
affidavit filed on behalf of the // 7 // Opposite Party No.1 submits before this Court that the Odisha
University Statute shall apply to the facts of the petitioner's case. He also referred to the provisions
contained in Statute 289 (1), (2) & (3) as has been quoted in para-6 of the counter affidavit.
Referring to statute 289(1), Mr. Das, learned Addl. Government Advocate submitted that existing
employees who have not yet exercised their option under the statute shall exercise their option in
writing either for pension scheme or for CPF under statute 288 within a period of six months from
the date of the said statute came into force.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/117874664/ 3

11. There is no dispute with regard to the coming into force of the statute i.e. w.e.f. 1.1.1990. He
further contended that in view of the 289 (3), which is a deeming fiction, the employees who fail to
exercise their option as required under the Statute, 1990 within the prescribed time limit, he or she
shall be deemed to have opted for the pension scheme. Accordingly, it was submitted by learned
Addl. Government Advocate that the case of the petitioner is to be considered strictly in the light of
the provisions contained in statute 289 of the Odisha University first statute 1990. It was also
contended that the petitioner having exercised his option in the year 1993 which is an admitted fact,
the petitioner is legally estopped to change his stand and opt for the pension scheme at a belated
stage.
// 8 // Accordingly, it was also contended that the petitioner's case is to be covered under the CPF
scheme and not under pension scheme.
12. Having heard the learned counsels appearing for the respective parties and on a careful scrutiny
of the background facts of the present cases as well as the pleadings of the respective parties, this
Court is of the view that the case of the petitioner is to be considered in the light of the first Statute
University, 1990. Therefore, for better appreciation, the provisions contained under Statute 288 as
well as 289 are quoted hereinbelow:-
Pension of 288. Every employee retiring on or after the 1st day of April, 1985 be
entitled Contributory either to the benefit of the Pension Scheme as applicable to the
State Government Provident employees as amended from time to time, or to the
benefit of the Contributory Fund Provident Fund of the University provided in this
Chapter, as he may opt:
Provided however, that for the purpose of Contributory Provident Fund, the term
"employee" shall be as defined in Chapter VII of this Part. Option 289. (1) The
existing employees who have not already exercised their option under the Statutes
shall exercise their option in writing either for the Pension Scheme or the
Contributory Provident Fund Scheme under Statute 288 within a period of six
months from the date these Statutes come into force. The employees recruited
thereafter to the service of the University shall exercise their option either for the
Pension or Contributory Provident Fund Scheme within a period of six months of
their appointment:
Option once Provided that the employees who have crossed the age of 58 years but
exercised be have not attained the age of 60 years shall also have the right to exercise
their final option as aforesaid within a period of six months from the date these
statutes come into force, but not later than one month prior to the date they attain
the age of 60 years.
(2) The option as provided above, shall be exercisable once only in respect of either
Scheme which shall be final irrespective of any change that may be made in any such
scheme from time to time. The fact of exercising such option shall be recorded in the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/117874664/ 4
Simanchal Rath vs State Of Odisha & Others . Opp. Parties on 3 August, 2023
service book of the employee by the Registrar or such other office nominated by him.
Pension and (3) If any employee fails to exercise the option required under these gratuity Statutes
within the prescribed time limit, he/ she shall be deemed to have opted for the Pension Scheme.
// 9 //
13. On perusal of Statute 289 (1) it appears that the existing employees who have not already
exercised their option under the Statute (Odisha University first Statute, 1990) shall exercise their
option in writing either for pension scheme or for CPF scheme under Statute 288 within a period of
six months from the date these statutes came into force (admittedly with effect from 01.01.1990). On
further, careful scrutiny of statute 289 (3), this Court is of the view that the said provision is in the
nature of a deeming fiction applicable to the employees who fail to exercise their option as required
under these statutes within the prescribed time limit. Statute 289 (3) further provides that in case
the University employees fail to exercise their option within the prescribed time limit i.e. from
1.1.1990 to 30.06.1990, they shall be deemed to have opted for the pension scheme. This Court is
also of the considered view that there is no ambiguity so far the provisions contained in the first
statute, 1990are concerned. Therefore, the case of the petitioner needs to be considered in view of
the provisions contained in the Statute 289 of the First Statute, 1990.
14. On perusal of the record and documents annexed to the writ application, this Court came across
the letter dated 23.03.2011 under Annexure-D/3. The said letter has been introduced at the instance
of the O.P. Nos.3 & 4 by filing an affidavit. Letter dated // 10 // 23.03.2011 has been issued by the
F.A.-cum-Additional Secretary to Govt. to the Registrar, Berhampur University. Under the aforesaid
letter, the Govt. of Odisha has taken a specific stand that the change of option from CPF scheme to
Pension scheme is to be carried out as per the provisions contained in Statute 289 (1) of Odisha
University first Statute 1990. Accordingly, it was held in the aforesaid letter that the resolution dated
30.08.1997 of the Syndicate of the University is beyond the scope of the aforesaid Statute. On a plain
reading of the aforesaid letter of the Government to the Registrar gives an impression that the
Government has rightly pointed out that the change of option shall be governed by the provisions of
the first statute, more specifically, statute 289. Thus any decision or action taken contrary to the
provisions contained in Statute 289 would be contrary to the first Statute 1990 and the same would
be invalid in law.
15. Reverting back to the facts of the present case, this Court is required to determine the issue as to
whether the petitioner has exercised his option at all in terms of the first statute 1990 or not? it was
contended by learned counsel for the University that the prior to the first statute came into force, the
petitioner had opted for the CPF scheme on dtd.18.04.1989. It was also contended by learned
counsel appearing for the Opposite Parties that the petitioner had // 11 // once again opted for CPF
scheme on 10.11.1993. Therefore, the petitioner had twice exercised his option to come under the
CPF scheme. This court on a careful analysis of the dates, is of the considered view that the same is
either prior to 1.1.1990 or after 30.06.1990. The relevant time for the purpose of statute 289 of the
first statute 1990 is the time period between 1.1.1990 and 30.06.1990. It is also the admitted
position of the parties, that the petitioner had not opted for any specific scheme within the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/117874664/ 5
Simanchal Rath vs State Of Odisha & Others . Opp. Parties on 3 August, 2023
prescribed time limit as has been prescribed under statute 289 (1) of the first statute 1990. This fact
is evident from the letter dated 22.03.2016 under Annexure-14. On perusal of the aforesaid letter it
appears that the same has been issued under the signature of the Deputy Registrar of Berhampur
University to the first appellate authority and the Registrar, Berhampur University under the RTI
Act.
16. The information vide letter dated 22.03.2016 was provided on an application being filed by the
petitioner under the RTI Act. Letter dated 22.03.2016 under Annexure-14 to the writ application
clearly reveals that the Deputy Registrar on verification of the record informed that the petitioner
has not opted for either the CPF or GPF during the period from 1.1.1990 to 30.06.1990. Further, on
perusal of the letter under Annexure-3 series, it appears that the // 12 // petitioner while admitting
that earlier he had opted for the CPF had subsequently made a request to change over to the pension
scheme vide his letter dated 04.02.2005 as well as the letter dated 18.04.2006. On further scrutiny
of the record it appears that a group of employees of the Berhampur University have also
represented to the Commissioner-cum-Secretary to the Chancellor of the University with a prayer
for change of option from CPF to pension scheme vide their representation dated 20.03.2003 under
Annexure-
4.
17. The relevant consideration in the present case, is whether the petitioner has opted for any
specific scheme in terms of the statute 289 or not? No doubt the petitioner had initially opted for
CPF scheme i.e. prior to the statute 1990 came into force and thereafter after the cut off date in the
year 1993. However, so far the facts of the present case is concerned, it is an admitted fact that the
petitioner had not opted for any specific scheme be it CPF or the pension scheme. Therefore, the law
is to be analysed keeping in view the aforesaid facts while applying the provision of the Statute 289
to the facts of the present case. On an analysis of facts, this Court is of the considered view that 289
(1) of the first statute 1990 provides that the petitioner should have opted for any specific scheme
within the prescribed time i.e. from 1.1.1990 to 30.06.1990.
// 13 // However, the petitioner has not opted for any specific scheme within the aforesaid
stipulated time as provided in statute 289(1) of the Statute, 1990. Therefore, irrespective of the fact
that the petitioner had opted for any particular scheme either prior to the first statute came into
force or after the prescribed time limit, the case of the petitioner is to be treated as a case where the
employee of the University has not specifically opted for either the CPF or the pension scheme
within the prescribed time limit as provided under statute 289 (1) of the first statute 1990.
18. Therefore, keeping in view the provision of statute 289, the case of the petitioner is to be
governed under statute 289 (3), that is, the deeming provision in a case where the employee of the
university has not opted for any specific scheme within the prescribed time limit as provided under
Statute 289 (1).
19. Since, statute 289 (3) of the first statute, as has been quoted hereinabove, provides that in a case
where the university employee fails to exercise the option as required under these statute (as
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/117874664/ 6
Simanchal Rath vs State Of Odisha & Others . Opp. Parties on 3 August, 2023
provided under Statute 289 (1)) within the prescribed time limit again (as prescribed in Statute 289)
he or she shall be deemed to have opted for the pension scheme. Therefore, in the facts and
circumstances of the present case, where it is clear that the petitioner has not opted for any specific
scheme under statute 289 // 14 // (1) his case shall be governed under Statute 289 (3) and by
applying deeming provision the case of the petitioner is to be considered under the pension scheme
irrespective of the fact that the petitioner had exercised his option contrary to the provision
contained in statute 289 (1). Such exercise of option contrary to the statute 289 (1) is stated to be
non est in the eye of law and the same will not have any bearing so far the claim of the petitioner has
involved in the present writ application is concerned.
20. In course of his argument, learned counsel for the petitioner referred to the judgment of this
Court in Sarat Behera vs. State of Odisha & others as well as batch of other matters decided on
31.03.2022. Referring to the aforesaid judgment, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the
very same statute 289 was under
consideration by this Court. While deciding the above referred case this Court has
also taken note of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Union of India &
Anr. vs. S.L. Verma and others, reported in (2006) 12 SCC 53. Further, this Court has
also referred to a judgment of this Court by a coordinate bench in Dr. Dibakar
Panigrahy & others vs. Berhampur University and others in W.P.(C) No.13757 of 2015
decided on 03.07.2020. Finally, a batch of writ application had been disposed of with
a direction to the Opposite Parties to consider the case of the petitioner afresh in //
15 // the light of the judgment in Dr. Dibarkar Panigrahy's case (supra) and to take a
final decision within a period of three months from the date of communication of
copy of the judgment in Sarat Behera's case. Learned counsel for the Petitioner
further referred to the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in University of Delhi
vs. Shashi Kiran and others and a batch of similar other civil appeals reported in
2022 SCC Online SC 594.
21. On perusal of the judgment in Sashi Kiran's case (supra), it is seen that the
Hon'ble Supreme Court observed that the same involves adjudication at the question
relating to the employee of Delhi University by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.
The issue involved in the said case was whether the employees of the University were
to be governed under the CPF scheme or they will be considered under the GPF and
pension scheme. In the above reported case, the Central Government issued a
notification with respect to change of the employees from CPF to GPF scheme. Such
notification was issued on 1.5.1987 contemplating that all the CPF beneficiaries who
were in service on 1.1.1986 and were still in service will be deemed to have come over
to GPF unless a contrary was exercised by them in writing by 30.09.1987 to continue
to be governed under CPF. After detail analyzed of the facts, the Hon'ble Supreme
Court crystallized the fact by creating a legal fiction that // 16 // thus were different
categories of employees. So far the facts of the present case is concerned, the same
would be governed by the scenario-B and the case of the N.C. Bakshi and batch of
other cases.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/117874664/ 7
Simanchal Rath vs State Of Odisha & Others . Opp. Parties on 3 August, 2023
22. In N.C. Bakshi's case the factual scenario was that the University employees who
had not exercised the option by the cutoff date contemplated under the notification
dated 1.5.1987 and were thus deemed to have come over to GPF, however, such
employees had exercised the option to remain under the CPF scheme during first two
extensions granted by the University between 1.10.1987 to 29.02.1988 and were now
praying that they will be allowed to continue under GPF. Such cases were decided in
N.C. Bakshi and batch of other cases and the factual position of the aforesaid are
somewhat identical to the facts of the present writ application. In N.C. Bakshi and
batch of other cases the learned Single Judge of the High Court while deciding the
batch of cases placed reliance on R.N. Virmani and batch of other cases to come to a
conclusion that the option to remain under CPF was exercised by the petitioner after
the cutoff date and only during the extension granted by the University which
extension were without any authority.
23. Accordingly, learned Single Judge of the High Court had come to a conclusion
that in view of the law laid down by the // 17 // Hon'ble Supreme Court in S.L.
Verma's case (supra) that when employee is required to exercise his option in view of
the notification of the Central Government dated 1.5.1987 and if such option is a
positive option to be given only if an employee was desirous of continuing under the
CPF scheme and that too by 30.09.1987 and in the event no positive option was
received from an employee expressing his or her desire to continue with the CPF
scheme then the employee would automatically be covered by the pension scheme by
virtue of deeming legal fiction created under the provisions of notification dated
1.5.1987. The aforesaid judgment of the learned Single Judge Bench was affirmed by
the Division Bench of the High Court thereafter the Delhi University made an appeal
to the Supreme Court.
24. The Hon'ble Supreme Court while deciding the issue which is reported in 2022
SCC Online SC 594 has affirmed the judgment of the High Court both by the Hon'ble
Single Judge as well as the Division Bench and accordingly disposed of the appeal
preferred by Delhi University. While dispose of the appeal in terms of the order
passed in the aforesaid case and on perusal of the aforesaid judgment in Sashi Kiran's
case (supra) and batch of other cases, this Court deems it relevant to quote
hereinbelow the para-20 and 21 of the Judgment:-
// 18 //
20. According to the notification dated 01.05.1987 two situations were contemplated.
First, the deeming provision in terms of which the concerned employee was taken to
have come over to GPF. The second situation being where a conscious option was
exercised before the cut-off date to continue to be under CPF. R.N. Virmani Division
Bench of the High Court, as no conscious option was exercised by the cut-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/117874664/ 8
Simanchal Rath vs State Of Odisha & Others . Opp. Parties on 3 August, 2023
off date. Consequently, the concerned employees must be deemed to have come over to GPF.
Logically, it would be immaterial whether the concerned employee continued to make contribution
assuming himself to be covered under CPF, even though contributions were made by the concerned
authorities. The benefit was therefore rightly granted in favor of the employees and the entire
contribution was directed to be refunded. The University has chosen not to appeal against that
decision and thus the matter has attained finality.
21. Theoretically, extension of the same principle would be that if no option was exercised before the
cut-off date, but an option was exercised after the cut-off date was extended; and if no switchover
could be allowed after the cutoff date, the decisions rendered by the learned Single Judge and the
Division Bench in the N.C. Bakshi batch of cases wre also quite correct. Consequently, irrespective of
the fact that the concerned employees had exercised the option to continue to be under CPF, such
exercise of option would be non est in the eyes of law. That in fact is the ratio of the decision in S.L.
Verma's case. Thus, both these batches of cases were rightly decided by the learned Single Judge and
the Division Bench. We, therefore, dismiss the appeal in N.C. Bakshi batch of cases.
25. The view expressed by this Court in the present case gets ample support from the view expressed
by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in para-20 and 21 of the judgment in Sashi Kiran's case (supra).
Therefore, this Court is of the considered view that since the petitioner has not exercised any option
under Statute 289 of the // 19 // first statute 1990 within the time prescribed in statute 289 (1)
specifically, therefore, the case of the petitioner is to be considered in terms of statute 289 (3) that is
by applying the deeming legal fiction provided under the first statute 1990.
26. In view of the aforesaid analysis of law and facts further keeping in view the provisions
contained in Statute 288 and 289 of the Odisha University First Statute, 1990, this Court directs the
Opposite Parties to consider the cases of the petitioner in view of the legal position as has been
discussed hereinabove as well as keeping in view the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
Sashi Kiran's case (supra) reported in 2022 SCC Online SC 594. Further it is directed that in the
event the Opposite Parties come to a conclusion that the petitioner has not exercised any option
under the Odisha University first Statute, 1990 as prescribed under Statute 289 within the
prescribed time limit then the case of the petitioner is bound to be considered under statute 289 (3).
Accordingly, the case of the petitioner is to be considered under statute 289 (3). It is needless to
mention that the opposite parties are bound to extend the benefits accruing in favour of the
petitioner by applying the said provision to the facts of the petitioner's case. It is further directed
that the Opposite Parties shall do well to consider the case of the petitioner in the light of the
aforesaid direction within a period of // 20 // two months from the date of communication of a
certified copy of this judgment by the Petitioner.
27. Accordingly, the writ petition is disposed of in terms of the aforesaid observations. However,
there shall be no order as to cost.
