5.The petitioner acquired the qualification of B.A., M.A., and B.Ed and she was appointed as
Secondary Grade Teacher on 23.02.2011. As per G.O.Ms.No.181, dated 15.11.2011, the Secondary
Grade Teacher was supposed to complete the TET qualification. But this Court in a number
http://www.judis.nic.in of judgments held that only those persons, who are appointed as Secondary
Grade Teachers on or after 27.09.2011, are required to acquire the TET qualification and those
persons who have been appointed prior to that, need not acquire the TET qualification. This Court
has already passed an order in W.P(MD) Nos.8313, 8317 and 8319 of 2020 dated 30.07.2020,
wherein it has held as follows:-
12. In this context, the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners has relied upon a
decision of the learned Judge of this Court exactly on the same point made in a batch
of writ petitions in W.P(MD).Nos.5626 to 5630 of 2017 etc., dated 08.03.2019 in the
matter of M.Maharani Vs. State of Tamil Nadu rep., by its Secretary, Department of
School Education and others. In the said order, the learned counsel for the petitioner
relied upon para No.10, which reads thus.
“10.However, there is no cut off date specified in the said G.O.Ms.No.181, with regard to acquiring
the qualification of pass TET to continue in service as B.T.Assistants/Secondary Grade Teachers,
who are working as such in the respondent Schools. In this regard, a cursory glance at Clause (5) of
the notification dated 23.08.2010 and its amended notification dated 29.07.2011 issued by the
NCTE, the contents of which are reproduced at paragraph Nos. 8.2 and 8.4 above, would reveal that
if the process of appointment of teachers was initiated prior to the date http://www.judis.nic.in of
notification by issuing advertisement, such appointments have to be made in accordance with NCTE
(Determination of Minimum Qualifications for Recruitment of Teachers in Schools) Regulations
2001, there is no qualification prescribed with regard to possession of TET certificate, for
appointment to the post of B.T.Assistant and Secondary Grade Teachers. The qualification of
passing TET was first introduced by the notification dated 23.08.2010 and it was amended vide
notification dated 27.09.2011 and the teachers, who were appointed prior to that date need not pass
TET and even in the case of the teachers who were appointed after that date, if the advertisement to
initiate the process of appointment of teachers was made prior to that date, then, their
appointments also can be in accordance with the NCTE Regulations 2001 and they need not acquire
the TET qualification.“
13. From the reading of the said judgment, it has become clear that the NCTE prescribed the
qualification of TET originally from 23.08.2010 and subsequently from 27.09.2011 by way of
notification. Therefore, the actual date, on which, the said qualification become mandatory is
27.09.2011. Therefore, those teachers, who were appointed prior to 27.09.2011 cannot be put against
the said prescription of the NCTE and this has been exactly decided by the learned Judge in the said
judgement, referred to above.

6.In view of the above, this Court is of the view that the petitioner was appointed as Secondary
Grade Teacher on 23.02.2011 and she does not require to acquire the TET qualification. Therefore,
