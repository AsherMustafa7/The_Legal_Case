PRODUCED AS ANNEXURE-A.
THESE PETITIONS HAVING BEEN HEARD AND RESERVED FOR
ORDERS, COMING ON FOR PRONOUNCEMENT THIS DAY, THE
COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:-
8
ORDER
Criminal Petition No.6632 of 2020 is preferred by accused Nos. 1, 2, 4 and 5 in P.C.R.No.9076 of
2019; Writ Petition No.3201 of 2021 is preferred by accused No.3; Criminal Petition Nos. 6969 of
2021 and 7366 of 2021 are preferred by accused No.6 and Criminal Petition No.10125 of 2021 is
preferred by the complainant.
Since these petitions have sprung from all the accused and the complainant in a solitary criminal
case in C.C. No.23541 of 2019, the same are taken up and considered by this common order.
2. The facts adumbrated in each of the petitions are as follows:-
Criminal Petition No.6632 of 2020:
The petitioners in this case are accused Nos. 1, 2, 4 and 5 and the 2nd respondent is
the complainant who would register a private complaint before the VIII Additional
Chief Metropolitan Magistrate at Bangalore City in P.C.R.No.9076 of 2019 under
Section 200 of the Cr.P.C., which comes to be referred for investigation to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154509779/ 6
Vinoth Kumar vs State Of Karnataka on 20 December, 2023
jurisdictional Police under Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C., It is then a crime comes to
be registered in Crime No.137 of 2019 against these petitioners along with others for
offences punishable under Sections 120B, 420, 201, 423, 465, 468, 471, 149 and 506
of the IPC. It is the case of the complainant that accused No.2 and the complainant
have started a Company called Norte Technologies India Private Limited with paid
up capital of ` 5/- lakhs and accused No.2 and the complainant were 50% stake
holders in the said Company. In July 2015, car service software was launched by the
petitioners which helped in marketing while working with M/s OPC Asset Solutions
Private Limited. The further allegation is that the Company was doing well up to
October, 2015 after which, Car Dekho made an offer for investment which was valued
at 3 million US dollars. It is the allegation that during that point in time, the
petitioners along with other accused hatched a conspiracy to throw the 2nd
respondent out of the Company by forging the signature of the complainant and
creating a letter of resignation dated 31-12-2015. After that, on 29-01-2016, all the
petitioners were appointed as Directors and accused No.3 was appointed as
Additional Director without the consent of the complainant. It is the further
allegation that accused Nos.1 and 3 had threatened the complainant with dire
consequences for life, when he confronted them with the alleged forgery. The
complaint then goes on to narrate that the shares of the complainant were illegally
transferred and uploaded with the Registrar of Companies and it is at that point in
time, only when his Chartered Accountant downloaded the latest balance sheet, the
complainant comes to know the fraud or forgery committed by the petitioners. It is
further alleged that certain signatures were taken by coercion and huge investments
were made after the resignation of the complainant.
The ultimate crux is that the petitioners and other accused have eaten away ` 4/- crores of the
complainant in the aforesaid acts.
After registration of the crime in Crime No.137 of 2019 against all these petitioners and others, the
Police conduct investigation. The investigation leads to filing of a charge sheet before the concerned
Court against the petitioners for the aforesaid offences. The learned Magistrate, then takes
cognizance of the offences and registers C.C.No.23541 of 2019. On taking of cognizance, registering
criminal case and issuing summons to the petitioners, the petitioners have knocked at the doors of
this Court in the subject petitions.
Writ Petition No.3201 of 2021:
This Writ petition is preferred by accused No.3. The facts that led to registration of
private complaint in P.C.R.No.9076 of 2019, investigation conducted, order of the
learned Magistrate taking cognizance of the offence and registering C.C.No.23541 of
2019 are all common. Therefore, facts as narrated in the petition would not require to
be reiterated.
Criminal Petition Nos. 6969 and 7366 of 2021:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154509779/ 7
Vinoth Kumar vs State Of Karnataka on 20 December, 2023
The subject petitions are preferred by accused No.6. The facts narrated with regard to
what led to the filing of private complaint remains common even in these petitions.
At the time of registration of complaint, the petitioner was not arrayed as an accused.
The complaint was referred to investigation by the learned Magistrate. The charge
sheet comes to be filed. At the time of filing of the charge sheet, the petitioner was not
an accused. A supplementary charge sheet is filed after conduct of further
investigation. It is then the petitioner gets arrayed as accused No.6. After arraigning
of the petitioner as accused No.6, a remand order was sought by the Police to hand
over accused No.6 to the Police custody. The remand order is questioned in Criminal
Petition No.7366 of 2021 and all the proceedings in Criminal Petition No.6969 of
2021. The two give rise to two different causes of action. But, today Criminal Petition
No.6969 of 2021 assumes significance, as the entire proceedings in C.C.No.23541 of
2019 are challenged.
Criminal Petition No.10125 of 2021:
This petition is preferred by the complainant against certain actions of accused No.6.
Therefore, the facts that are obtaining in Criminal Petition No.6969 of 2021 and
Criminal Petition No.7366 of 2021 would become the facts of the case at hand as well.
Therefore, they are not reiterated.
3. Heard Sri D.R.Ravishankar, learned senior counsel appearing for petitioner in Crl.P.No.6632 of
2020, 6969 of 2021 and 7366 of 2021, Sri.A.S.Ponnanna, learned senior counsel appearing for
respondent No.2 in Crl.P.No.6632 of 2020 and Sri Atmaram S Nadkarni, learned senior counsel
appearing for respondent No.2 in Crl.P.Nos.6969 of 2021 and 7366 of 2021; Sri Sunil Kumar Patel,
learned counsel appearing for petitioner in Crl.P.No.10125 of 2021 and respondent No.2 in
W.P.No.3201 of 2021; Sri Gautam Shreedhar Bharadwaj learned counsel appearing for petitioner in
W.P.No.3201 of 2021 and respondent No.2 in Crl.P.No.10125 of 2021 and Smt.K.P.Yashodha, High
Court Government Pleader appearing for respondent No.1 in all the petitions.
4. The learned senior counsel appearing for accused Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 would vehemently contend
that the complaint so registered is hit by various illegalities. He would submit that it is contrary to
the judgment rendered by the Apex Court in the case of PRIYANKA SRIVASTAVA v. STATE OF U.P.
- (2015) 6 SCC 287, as the learned Magistrate has entertained the complaint without it being
accompanied by an affidavit and, therefore, the complaint reference and all further proceedings
taken thereto, would get vitiated; the learned Magistrate has not applied his mind, while referring
the complaint to investigation under Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C., and, therefore, the proceedings
are vitiated; a case which is purely contractual in nature is sought to be given a colour of crime and
the complainant voluntarily tendered his resignation, wakes up after three years and registers a
complaint which ought not to have been entertained by the learned Magistrate. There is no forgery
as is alleged in the case at hand and if it were to be a forged document, the complainant ought to
have, without any loss of time registered the crime. Having not done so, it is not open to the
complainant now to contend that the documents are forged and loss of ` 4/- crores has happened
due to acts of the accused. He would seek quashment of entire proceedings.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154509779/ 8
Vinoth Kumar vs State Of Karnataka on 20 December, 2023
5. Per-contra, the learned counsel representing the complainant would vehemently refute the
submissions by seeking to contend that the issue in the case involves seriously disputed questions of
fact. If there are seriously disputed questions of fact, this Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under
Section 482 of the Cr.P.C., should not interfere, as it would become a matter of trial.
He would submit that the case is at the stage of framing of charges.
At the stage of framing of charges, this Court would not enter into the evidence that has led to filing
of the charge sheet and annul entire proceedings. He would submit that the petitioners have not
madeout any case for interference.
6. The learned High Court Government Pleader representing the State would also toe the lines of the
learned counsel representing the complainant to contend that it is a matter of trial for the
petitioners to come out clean, as the charges would be framed and trial would be conducted by the
concerned Court. If the petitioners are able to establish their innocence, they would be acquitted and
it is not the stage where this Court should interfere under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.
7. I have given my anxious consideration to the submissions made by the respective learned counsel
and have perused the material on record.
8. The afore-narrated facts that led to registration of crime are a matter of record. What triggered
registration of crime is the complaint so registered by the 2nd respondent/complainant.
Therefore, I deem it appropriate to notice certain paragraphs of the complaint so registered and it
reads as follows:
"MEMORANDUM OF COMPLAINT FILED U/SEC.200 OF CODE OF CRIMINAL
PROCEDURE, 1973.

16. The said activities of Accused 1 to 5 indicates that A1/ Praveen Surendiran, A5/Madhu Jindal
and A3/Sandeep Gururaj were the Directors, beneficiary of the forgery committed by the accused,
for cheating the complainant, using the forged documents as geuine.
17. A1/Praveen Surendiran. A2/Sreekumar Sundaramoorthy, A5/Madhu Jindal and A3/Sandeep
Gururaj kept ignoring the complainant's repeated mails, messages and phone calls. The complainant
was very disappointed, distressed and went into depression. The complainant also reported the
issue to their CA A7/Nagaraju A and CS A6/Jyotika Kamath as they were responsible for the
compliance, as this was very serious non-compliance and fraud on their part too, but all efforts went
in vain. The copy of the same is herewith produced as Annexure-15.
18. All the accused, including A3/Sandeep Gururaj, A1/Praveen Surendiran, A5/Madhu Jindal,
A7/Nagaraju A & A6/Jyotika Kamath forced, coerced and threatened the complainant to sign a
document (which was not read over to the complainant or not allowed him to read), take part of the
money, the complainant had invested or to face dire consequences of the complainant's life, if he
comes to Bengaluru again.
19. The complainant refused to sign such a document as he was suspicious about the activities of
accused and their planned investment deal with M/s Europ Assistance, French Company, having
office at Mumbai, India at a much higher valuation. Hence, the complainant demanded the
proportionate share in the upcoming transaction with M/s Europ Assistance, French Company,
having office at Mumbai, India. They/Accused continued to refuse the complainant's demand, so the
complainant called and spoke to A3/Sandeep Gururaj in the month of May 2017, As A3/Sandeep
Gururaj was actively involved in the company - M/s Norte Technologies India Pvt.Ltd., to respect
the complainant's legitimate demand. A3/Sandeep Gururaj then asked the complainant to sign the
no objection agreement and take back complainant's investment money and also threatened the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154509779/ 12
Vinoth Kumar vs State Of Karnataka on 20 December, 2023
complainant with dire consequences to the complainant's life, if he do not sign the agreement. Also,
A3/Sandeep Gururaj even refused to return the complainant's initial investment without signing the
document. The complainant was scared and felt threatened, so he agreed to their demand
unwillingly. A4/Nitin Mehra reached Delhi and the complainant met him on 3rd August 2017 at
Nehru Palace, Delhi. The complainant signed the no objection agreement there only, under threat
and coercion. Subsequently, A1/ Praveen Surendiran online transferred Rs.20/- lakhs on the same
day to Bank account of complainant, from his personal account to cover up their crime.
20. Later the complainant learnt from Neswspaper and other sources that accused transferred all
rights of M/s NTI Private Limited, Bengaluru to M/s Europ Assistance through M/s ONB
Technologies, India, at Bengaluru and all shareholders/Directors got benefitted of USD 1.00 million
(equivalent to `7.00 crore) at least. They formed another company namely M/s ONB Technologies
Pte, Singapore.
At this point of time, A1/Praveen Surendiran & A2/ Sreekumar Sundaramoorthy were Directors of
M/s ONB Technologies Pte.Ltd., Singapore and A5/Madhu Jindal & A4/Nitin Mehra are Directors
in M/s ONB Technologies, India. M/s ONB Technologies Pre, Singapore holds 99.99% share in M/s
ONB Technologies India and A4/Nitin Mehra is representing M/s ONG Technologies, Singapore in
its Indian subsidiary.
21. This activities of Accused traumatized the complainant completely and the complainant suffered
depression for several months and lost hope in life. With the support of complainant's family &
friends, somehow the complainant got encouraged and re-started his life from the scratch. During
all these days, the complainant could not get enough courage to report the crime committed by all
the accused.
22. Recently after coming to know about the misdeeds of A3/Sandeep Gururaj from Newspaper, the
complainant got some courage to file complaint and requested to take appropriate legal action
against A1/Praveen Surendiran, A2/Sreekumar Sundaramoorthy, A3/Sandeep Gururaj, A4/Nitin
Mehra, A5/Madhu Jindal, A6/Jyotika Kamath and A7/Nagaraju A, for the misdeeds committed by
them, by filing a complaint, dated 16.07.2019, before Cubbon Park Police Station, Bengaluru.
No serious action has been taken by the said Police Station. It was brought to the notice of
jurisdictional SP/DCP. Hence, this complaint. The copy of the complaint dated 16-07-2019 and the
acknowledgements are herewith produced as Anenxures-16.
23. Consequently, due to the offences committed by all the accused, the complainant has suffered
loss of `50/- lakhs, initial funding to M/s NTI Pvt.Ltd., Bengaluru, 50%of amount from proceeds of
transfer of all rights of M/s NTI Pvt.Ltd., Bengaluru to M/s Europ Assistance, as stated earlier, for
`7/- crores, i.e., `3.5 crores and in total `4/- crores. Hence, this complaint.

(Emphasis added) The charge sheet was initially filed and additional charge sheets have been filed
in the case at hand. The entire issue revolves around maize of facts which are seriously disputed.
There are opinions of Foreign Science Laboratories, one of which forms part of original charge sheet
and the other which forms part of additional charge sheet, both of which indicate that there appears
to be forgery of the signature of the complainant qua the letter of resignation. The opinion of the
Foreign Science Laboratory which forms part of the charge sheet initially filed against A1 to A5 is
opinionated as follows:
"OPINION In view of the above noted observations and considering them
cumulatively, the following is my opinion:-
The Disputed signature marked Q-1 on the letter addressed to the Board of Directors
Norte Technologies India private limited dated 31-12-2015 provides a strong prima
facie evidence of not having been written by the author of the standard signature
marked S-series.
RECOMMENDATION At the present report is based on the examination of the
signatures (disputed and standard) available on the Xerox copies, it is necessary and
desirable to examine their originals extensively at an appropriate stage.
Sd/- (ASHOK KASHYAP) EXAMINER OF QUESTIONED DOCUMENTS.
Dated: 29-08-2019."

Vinoth Kumar vs State Of Karnataka on 20 December, 2023
The opinion is secured by the prosecution from a particular laboratory by name Kashyap's
International Forgery Detection Bureau. A second opinion is also taken from Truth Labs which also
confirms the disputed signature as observed hereinabove. What would unmistakably emerge is that,
if there is a doubt with regard to the signature of the foundational document to the entire
proceedings i.e., the letter of resignation said to have been tendered by the complainant, it requires
evidence in the least. It is always open to the concerned criminal Court to draw a further forensic
examination of documents in the event of need arising at the time of conduct of further proceedings.
Voluminous papers as charge sheet and additional charge sheets are filed against the petitioners in
all these cases barring writ petition which is filed by the complainant. Therefore, in these
circumstances of seriously disputed questions of fact, whether this Court could interfere on the plea
set up by the petitioners is required to be considered. The consideration of which need not detain
this Court for long, as the Apex Court from time to time has observed that when the High Court
exercising its jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C., is posed with seriously disputed
questions of fact, it should be loathe to interfere to quash the proceedings. The case at hand has
travelled a little further, as charge sheet and additional charge sheets are filed and the matter is set
down for trial.
9. It is not a case where this Court can indulge in a rowing enquiry of examination of each of the
documents and consider the case of the petitioners and obliterate the crime. Therefore, I deem it
appropriate to notice the line of law as observed by the Apex Court which directs non-interference in
the cases of the kind at hand, which involve offences of forgery and cheating and those being prima
facie made qua plethora of documents which form part of the charge sheet or additional charge
sheet.
10. The Apex Court in the case of M.VISWANATHAN v. S.K. TILES AND POTTERIES PRIVATE
LIMITED1 has held as follows:
"12. "8. Exercise of power under Section 482 of the Code in a case of this nature is the
exception and not the rule. The section does not confer any new powers on the High
Court. It only saves the inherent power which the Court possessed before the
enactment of the Code. It envisages three circumstances under which the inherent
jurisdiction may be exercised, namely, (i) to give effect to an order (2008) 16 SCC
390 under the Code, (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of court, and (iii) to
otherwise secure the ends of justice.
It is neither possible nor desirable to lay down any inflexible rule which would govern the exercise of
inherent jurisdiction. No legislative enactment dealing with procedure can provide for all cases that
may possibly arise. Courts, therefore, have inherent powers apart from express provisions of law
which are necessary for proper discharge of functions and duties imposed upon them by law. That is
the doctrine which finds expression in the section which merely recognises and preserves inherent
powers of the High Courts. All courts, whether civil or criminal possess, in the absence of any
express provision, as inherent in their constitution, all such powers as are necessary to do the right
and to undo a wrong in course of administration of justice on the principle 'quando lex aliquid alicui
concedit, concedere videtur et id sine quo res ipsae esse non potest' (when the law gives a person
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154509779/ 16
Vinoth Kumar vs State Of Karnataka on 20 December, 2023
anything it gives him that without which it cannot exist). While exercising powers under the section,
the court does not function as a court of appeal or revision. Inherent jurisdiction under the section
though wide has to be exercised sparingly, carefully and with caution and only when such exercise is
justified by the tests specifically laid down in the section itself. It is to be exercised ex debito justitiae
to do real and substantial justice for the administration of which alone courts exist. Authority of the
court exists for advancement of justice and if any attempt is made to abuse that authority so as to
produce injustice, the court has power to prevent abuse. It would be an abuse of process of the court
to allow any action which would result in injustice and prevent promotion of justice. In exercise of
the powers, court would be justified to quash any proceeding if it finds that initiation/continuance
of it amounts to abuse of the process of court or quashing of these proceedings would otherwise
serve the ends of justice. When no offence is disclosed by the complaint, the court may examine the
question of fact. When a complaint is sought to be quashed, it is permissible to look into the
materials to assess what the complainant has alleged and whether any offence is made out even if
the allegations are accepted in toto.
9. In R.P. Kapur v. State of Punjab [AIR 1960 SC 866] this Court summarised some categories of
cases where inherent power can and should be exercised to quash the proceedings: (AIR p. 869,
para 6)
(i) where it manifestly appears that there is a legal bar against the institution or continuance e.g.
want of sanction;
(ii) where the allegations in the first information report or complaint taken at its face value and
accepted in their entirety do not constitute the offence alleged;
(iii) where the allegations constitute an offence, but there is no legal evidence adduced or the
evidence adduced clearly or manifestly fails to prove the charge.
10. In dealing with the last case, it is important to bear in mind the distinction between a case where
there is no legal evidence or where there is evidence which is clearly inconsistent with the
accusations made, and a case where there is legal evidence which, on appreciation, may or may not
support the accusations. When exercising jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code, the High
Court would not ordinarily embark upon an enquiry whether the evidence in question is reliable or
not or whether on a reasonable appreciation of it accusation would not be sustained. That is the
function of the trial Judge. Judicial process should not be an instrument of oppression, or, needless
harassment. Court should be circumspect and judicious in exercising discretion and should take all
relevant facts and circumstances into consideration before issuing process, lest it would be an
instrument in the hands of a private complainant to unleash vendetta to harass any person
needlessly. At the same time the section is not an instrument handed over to an accused to
short-circuit a prosecution and bring about its sudden death.
11. The scope of exercise of power under Section 482 of the Code and the categories of cases where
the High Court may exercise its power under it relating to cognizable offences to prevent abuse of
process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice were set out in some detail by this
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154509779/ 17
Vinoth Kumar vs State Of Karnataka on 20 December, 2023
Court in State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal [1992 Supp (1) SCC 335: 1992 SCC (Cri) 426]. A note of
caution was, however, added that the power should be exercised sparingly and that too in rarest of
rare cases. The illustrative categories indicated by this Court are as follows: (SCC pp. 378-79, para
102) '(1) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the complaint, even if they are
taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or
make out a case against the accused.
(2) Where the allegations in the first information report and other materials, if any, accompanying
the FIR do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an investigation by police officers under
Section 156(1) of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within the purview of Section
155(2) of the Code.
(3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or complaint and the evidence collected
in support of the same do not disclose the commission of any offence and make out a case against
the accused.
(4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable offence but constitute only a
non-cognizable offence, no investigation is permitted by a police officer without an order of a
Magistrate as contemplated under Section 155(2) of the Code.
(5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently improbable on
the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground
for proceeding against the accused.
(6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of the Code or the Act
concerned (under which a criminal proceeding is instituted) to the institution and continuance of
the proceedings and/or where there is a specific provision in the Code or the Act concerned,
providing efficacious redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party.
(7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fides and/or where the
proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused
and with a view to spite him due to private and personal grudge.' As noted above, the powers
possessed by the High Court under Section 482 of the Code are very wide and the very plenitude of
the power requires great caution in its exercise. Court must be careful to see that its decision in
exercise of this power is based on sound principles. The inherent power should not be exercised to
stifle a legitimate prosecution. The High Court being the highest court of a State should normally
refrain from giving a prima facie decision in a case where the entire facts are incomplete and hazy,
more so when the evidence has not been collected and produced before the court and the issues
involved, whether factual or legal, are of magnitude and cannot be seen in their true perspective
without sufficient material. Of course, no hard- and-fast rule can be laid down in regard to cases in
which the High Court will exercise its extraordinary jurisdiction of quashing the proceeding at any
stage. [See Janata Dal v. H.S. Chowdhary [(1992) 4 SCC 305: 1993 SCC (Cri) 36] and Raghubir
Saran (Dr.) v. State of Bihar [AIR 1964 SC 1].] It would not be proper for the High Court to analyse
the case of the complainant in the light of all probabilities in order to determine whether a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154509779/ 18
Vinoth Kumar vs State Of Karnataka on 20 December, 2023
conviction would be sustainable and on such premises arrive at a conclusion that the proceedings
are to be quashed. It would be erroneous to assess the material before it and conclude that the
complaint cannot be proceeded with. In a proceeding instituted on complaint, exercise of the
inherent powers to quash the proceedings is called for only in a case where the complaint does not
disclose any offence or is frivolous, vexatious or oppressive. If the allegations set out in the
complaint do not constitute the offence of which cognizance has been taken by the Magistrate, it is
open to the High Court to quash the same in exercise of the inherent powers under Section 482 of
the Code. It is not, however, necessary that there should be meticulous analysis of the case before
the trial to find out whether the case would end in conviction or acquittal. The complaint has to be
read as a whole. If it appears that on consideration of the allegations in the light of the statement
made on oath of the complainant that the ingredients of the offence or offences are disclosed and
there is no material to show that the complaint is mala fide, frivolous or vexatious, in that event
there would be no justification for interference by the High Court. When an information is lodged at
the police station and an offence is registered, then the mala fides of the informant would be of
secondary importance. It is the material collected during the investigation and evidence led in court
which decides the fate of the accused person. The allegations of mala fides against the informant are
of no consequence and cannot by themselves be the basis for quashing the proceedings. [See
Dhanalakshmi v. R. Prasanna Kumar [1990 Supp SCC 686: 1991 SCC (Cri) 142], State of Bihar v.
P.P. Sharma [1992 Supp (1) SCC 222: 1992 SCC (Cri) 192: AIR 1991 SC 1260], Rupan Deol Bajaj v.

1503: AIR 1999 SC 3596] and Rajesh Bajaj v. State (NCT of Delhi) [(1999) 3 SCC 259 : 1999 SCC
(Cri) 401] .]"
The above position was recently highlighted in Zandu Pharmaceutical Works Ltd. v.
Mohd. Sharaful Haque [(2005) 1 SCC 122: 2005 SCC (Cri) 283] , at SCC pp. 127-30,
paras 8-11.
13. In the instant case, the only conclusion arrived at by the High Court is in para 23
of the judgment which has been quoted above. The High Court has wrongly come to
the conclusion that the matter in issue has to be decided by a civil court or the
Company Law Board. The High Court had referred to four types of allegations. Some
of the allegations are certainly not adjudicable by the civil court or the Company Law
Board. That being so the exercise of jurisdiction by the High Court in terms of Section
482 CrPC cannot be maintained. The impugned order is indefensible and is set
aside."
(Emphasis supplied) The Apex Court in the case of CHIRAG M.PATHAK v. DOLLYBEN KANTILAL
PATEL2 has held as follows:
"22. In our view, such issues and many more, namely, the nature and manner of
conspiracy, whether it was confined to each society or there was one or larger
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154509779/ 19
Vinoth Kumar vs State Of Karnataka on 20 December, 2023
conspiracy, how and in what manner it was accomplished, who were parties to it, who
were those persons who secured financial benefits, what was the modus operandi for
misappropriation of the funds of each society and how the funds were siphoned off
from each society, etc., need detailed investigation with respect to each cooperative
society. Once the investigation is complete in relation to each society, the same would
form part of the separate charge- sheet for being proved with the aid of evidence in a
competent court against each society and persons involved in the scam. It is for the
court to examine the factual issues arising in every case by appreciating the evidence
once adduced in support thereof and pass appropriate orders in accordance with law.
23. The High Court, in exercise of its powers under Section 482 of the Code, cannot
undertake a detailed examination of the facts contained in the FIRs by acting as an
appellate court and draw its own (2018) 1 SCC 330 conclusion. It is more so when
investigation in other societies is not yet complete."
(Emphasis supplied) Later, the Apex Court in the case of DR. LAKSHMAN v. STATE OF
KARNATAKA3 has held as follows:
"9. The learned Senior Counsel Shri R. Basant appearing for the accused, in support
of his case, relied on the judgment of this Court in S.W. Palanitkar v. State of Bihar
[S.W. Palanitkar v. State of Bihar, (2002) 1 SCC 241: 2002 SCC (Cri) 129] and
submitted that every breach of contract may not result in a penal offence, but in the
very same judgment, this Court has held that breach of trust with mens rea gives rise
to a criminal prosecution as well. In a given case, whether there is any mens rea on
the part of the accused or not is a matter which is required to be considered having
regard to the facts and circumstances of the case and contents of the complaint, etc.
In the case on hand, it is clearly alleged that even before entering into the agreement
dated 26-9-2012, lands were already sold to third party, which were agreed to be
procured in favour of the appellant. Not only that, it is the specific allegation of the
complainant that the cheques were issued towards security from the account which
was also closed much earlier to the date of agreement itself.
10. The learned counsel also relied on the judgment in Anil Mahajan v. Bhor
Industries Ltd. [Anil Mahajan v. Bhor Industries Ltd., (2005) 10 SCC 228: (2006) 1
SCC (Cri) 746] but in the very same judgment it is also held that where there exists a
fraudulent and dishonest intention at the time of the commission of the offence, law
permits the victim to proceed against the wrongdoer for having committed an offence
of criminal breach of trust or cheating. In another case relied on by the learned
counsel viz. Inder Mohan (2019) 9 SCC 677 Goswami v. State of Uttaranchal [Inder
Mohan Goswami v. State of Uttaranchal, (2007) 12 SCC 1: (2008) 1 SCC (Cri) 259]
this Court has reiterated the scope of power of the High Court under Section 482
CrPC. Having regard to the facts of the case, we are of the view that the said
judgments relied on by the learned counsel would not support the case of the
respondents. It is also to be noticed that in the complaint filed in PCR No. 14420 of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154509779/ 20
Vinoth Kumar vs State Of Karnataka on 20 December, 2023
2015, investigation has been completed and charge-sheet was also filed on
22-12-2015."
(Emphasis supplied) After all the afore-quoted judgments, the Apex Court in the case of KAPTAN
SINGH v. STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH4 has held as follows:-
"9.1. At the outset, it is required to be noted that in the present case the High Court in
exercise of powers under Section 482 CrPC has quashed the criminal proceedings for
the offences under Sections 147, 148, 149, 406, 329 and 386 IPC. It is required to be
noted that when the High Court in exercise of powers under Section 482 CrPC
quashed the criminal proceedings, by the time the investigating officer after
recording the statement of the witnesses, statement of the complainant and collecting
the evidence from the incident place and after taking statement of the independent
witnesses and even statement of the accused persons, has filed the charge-sheet
before the learned Magistrate for the offences under Sections 147, 148, 149, 406, 329
and 386 IPC and even the learned Magistrate also took the cognizance. From the
impugned judgment and order [Radhey Shyam Gupta v. State of U.P., 2020 SCC
OnLine All 914] passed by the High Court, it does not appear that the High Court
took into consideration the material collected during the investigation/inquiry and
even the statements recorded. If the petition under Section 482 (2021)9 SCC 35
CrPC was at the stage of FIR in that case the allegations in the FIR/complaint only
are required to be considered and whether a cognizable offence is disclosed or not is
required to be considered. However, thereafter when the statements are recorded,
evidence is collected and the charge-sheet is filed after conclusion of the
investigation/inquiry the matter stands on different footing and the Court is required
to consider the material/evidence collected during the investigation.
Even at this stage also, as observed and held by this Court in a catena of decisions, the High Court is
not required to go into the merits of the allegations and/or enter into the merits of the case as if the
High Court is exercising the appellate jurisdiction and/or conducting the trial. As held by this Court
in Dineshbhai Chandubhai Patel [Dineshbhai Chandubhai Patel v. State of Gujarat, (2018) 3 SCC
104 : (2018) 1 SCC (Cri) 683] in order to examine as to whether factual contents of FIR disclose any
cognizable offence or not, the High Court cannot act like the investigating agency nor can exercise
the powers like an appellate court. It is further observed and held that that question is required to be
examined keeping in view, the contents of FIR and prima facie material, if any, requiring no proof.
At such stage, the High Court cannot appreciate evidence nor can it draw its own inferences from
contents of FIR and material relied on. It is further observed it is more so, when the material relied
on is disputed. It is further observed that in such a situation, it becomes the job of the investigating
authority at such stage to probe and then of the court to examine questions once the charge-sheet is
filed along with such material as to how far and to what extent reliance can be placed on such
material.
9.2. In Dhruvaram Murlidhar Sonar [Dhruvaram Murlidhar Sonar v. State of Maharashtra, (2019)
18 SCC 191 :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154509779/ 21
Vinoth Kumar vs State Of Karnataka on 20 December, 2023
(2020) 3 SCC (Cri) 672] after considering the decisions of this Court in Bhajan Lal
[State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal, 1992 Supp (1) SCC 335 : 1992 SCC (Cri) 426] , it is
held by this Court that exercise of powers under Section 482 CrPC to quash the
proceedings is an exception and not a rule. It is further observed that inherent
jurisdiction under Section 482 CrPC though wide is to be exercised sparingly,
carefully and with caution, only when such exercise is justified by tests specifically
laid down in the section itself. It is further observed that appreciation of evidence is
not permissible at the stage of quashing of proceedings in exercise of powers under
Section 482 CrPC. Similar view has been expressed by this Court in Arvind Khanna
[CBI v. Arvind Khanna, (2019) 10 SCC 686 : (2020) 1 SCC (Cri) 94] , Managipet
[State of Telangana v. Managipet, (2019) 19 SCC 87 : (2020) 3 SCC (Cri) 702] and in
XYZ [XYZ v. State of Gujarat, (2019) 10 SCC 337 : (2020) 1 SCC (Cri) 173] , referred
to hereinabove.
9.3. Applying the law laid down by this Court in the aforesaid decisions to the facts of the case on
hand, we are of the opinion that the High Court has exceeded its jurisdiction in quashing the
criminal proceedings in exercise of powers under Section 482 CrPC.
10. The High Court has failed to appreciate and consider the fact that there are very serious triable
issues/allegations which are required to be gone into and considered at the time of trial. The High
Court has lost sight of crucial aspects which have emerged during the course of the investigation.
The High Court has failed to appreciate and consider the fact that the document i.e. a joint notarised
affidavit of Mamta Gupta Accused 2 and Munni Devi under which according to Accused 2 Ms
Mamta Gupta, Rs 25 lakhs was paid and the possession was transferred to her itself is seriously
disputed. It is required to be noted that in the registered agreement to sell dated 27- 10-2010, the
sale consideration is stated to be Rs 25 lakhs and with no reference to payment of Rs 25 lakhs to Ms
Munni Devi and no reference to handing over the possession. However, in the joint notarised
affidavit of the same date i.e. 27-10-2010 sale consideration is stated to be Rs 35 lakhs out of which
Rs 25 lakhs is alleged to have been paid and there is a reference to transfer of possession to Accused
2. Whether Rs 25 lakhs has been paid or not the accused have to establish during the trial, because
the accused are relying upon the said document and payment of Rs 25 lakhs as mentioned in the
joint notarised affidavit dated 27-10-2010. It is also required to be considered that the first
agreement to sell in which Rs 25 lakhs is stated to be sale consideration and there is reference to the
payment of Rs 10 lakhs by cheques. It is a registered document. The aforesaid are all triable
issues/allegations which are required to be considered at the time of trial. The High Court has failed
to notice and/or consider the material collected during the investigation.
11. Now so far as the finding recorded by the High Court that no case is made out for the offence
under Section 406 IPC is concerned, it is to be noted that the High Court itself has noted that the
joint notarised affidavit dated 27-10-2010 is seriously disputed, however as per the High Court the
same is required to be considered in the civil proceedings. There the High Court has committed an
error. Even the High Court has failed to notice that another FIR has been lodged against the accused
for the offences under Sections 467, 468, 471 IPC with respect to the said alleged joint notarised
affidavit. Even according to the accused the possession was handed over to them. However, when
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154509779/ 22
Vinoth Kumar vs State Of Karnataka on 20 December, 2023
the payment of Rs 25 lakhs as mentioned in the joint notarised affidavit is seriously disputed and
even one of the cheques out of 5 cheques each of Rs 2 lakhs was dishonoured and according to the
accused they were handed over the possession (which is seriously disputed) it can be said to be
entrustment of property. Therefore, at this stage to opine that no case is made out for the offence
under Section 406 IPC is premature and the aforesaid aspect is to be considered during trial. It is
also required to be noted that the first suit was filed by Munni Devi and thereafter subsequent suit
came to be filed by the accused and that too for permanent injunction only. Nothing is on record
that any suit for specific performance has been filed. Be that as it may, all the aforesaid aspects are
required to be considered at the time of trial only.
12. Therefore, the High Court has grossly erred in quashing the criminal proceedings by entering
into the merits of the allegations as if the High Court was exercising the appellate jurisdiction
and/or conducting the trial. The High Court has exceeded its jurisdiction in quashing the criminal
proceedings in exercise of powers under Section 482 CrPC.
13. Even the High Court has erred in observing that original complaint has no locus. The aforesaid
observation is made on the premise that the complainant has not placed on record the power of
attorney along with the counter filed before the High Court. However, when it is specifically stated
in the FIR that Munni Devi has executed the power of attorney and thereafter the investigating
officer has conducted the investigation and has recorded the statement of the complainant, accused
and the independent witnesses, thereafter whether the complainant is having the power of attorney
or not is to be considered during trial.
14. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the impugned judgment and order
[Radhey Shyam Gupta v. State of U.P., 2020 SCC OnLine All 914] passed by the High Court
quashing the criminal proceedings in exercise of powers under Section 482 CrPC is unsustainable
and the same deserves to be quashed and set aside and is accordingly quashed and set aside. Now,
the trial is to be conducted and proceeded further in accordance with law and on its own merits. It is
made clear that the observations made by this Court in the present proceedings are to be treated to
be confined to the proceedings under Section 482 CrPC only and the trial court to decide the case in
accordance with law and on its own merits and on the basis of the evidence to be laid and without
being influenced by any of the observations made by us hereinabove. The present appeal is
accordingly allowed."
(Emphasis supplied) On a coalesce of the judgments rendered by the Apex Court, what would
unmistakably emerge is that, this Court should display hands off when the issue that is brought
before it involves maize of facts which are seriously disputed. It is not as simple as projection of the
petitioners qua the issues, they involve cheating, forgery and conspiracy, all of which require a full
blown trial for the petitioners to come out clean.
11. Particularly in the cases involving forgery, the Apex Court in the case of STATE OF MADHYA
PRADESH v. YOGENDRA SINGH JADON5 has held as follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154509779/ 23
Vinoth Kumar vs State Of Karnataka on 20 December, 2023
"5. We find that the High Court has examined the entire issue as to whether the
offence under Sections 420 and 120-B IPC is made out or not at pre-trial stage. The
respondents are beneficiary of the grant of cash credit limit when their father was the
President of the Bank. The power under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 cannot be exercised where the allegations are required to be proved
in court of law. The manner in which loan was advanced without any proper
documents and the fact that the respondents are beneficiary of benevolence of their
father prima facie disclose an offence under Sections 420 and 120-B IPC. It may be
stated that other officials of the Bank have been charge-sheeted for an offence under
Sections 13(1)(d) and 13(2) of the Act. The charge under Section 420 IPC is not an
isolated offence but it has to be read along with the offences under the Act to which
the respondents may be liable with the aid of Section 120-B IPC.
6. Consequently, we find that the order [Yogendra Singh Jadon v. State of M.P., CRR
No. 260 of 2014, order dated 2-5-2016 (MP)] of the High Court quashing the charges
against the respondents is not sustainable in law and the same is set aside. The
appeal is allowed. It shall be open to the respondents to take such other action as may
be available to them in accordance with law."
(2020) 12 SCC 588 The Apex Court sets aside the order of the High Court which had quashed the
charge sheet so filed in an offence involving Sections 420 and 120-B of the IPC. The Apex Court
holds that if there is prima facie material, this Court would not interfere under Section 482 of the
CrPC. Again the Apex Court in the case of RAJEEV KOURAV v. BAISAHAB6 has held as follows:
"8. It is no more res integra that exercise of power under Section 482 CrPC to quash a
criminal proceeding is only when an allegation made in the FIR or the charge-sheet
constitutes the ingredients of the offence/offences alleged. Interference by the High
Court under Section 482 CrPC is to prevent the abuse of process of any court or
otherwise to secure the ends of justice. It is settled law that the evidence produced by
the accused in his defence cannot be looked into by the court, except in very
exceptional circumstances, at the initial stage of the criminal proceedings. It is trite
law that the High Court cannot embark upon the appreciation of evidence while
considering the petition filed under Section 482 CrPC for quashing criminal
proceedings. It is clear from the law laid down by this Court that if a prima facie case
is made out disclosing the ingredients of the offence alleged against the accused, the
Court cannot quash a criminal proceeding.
... ... ...
10. We do not agree with the submissions made on behalf of Respondents 1 to 3. The
conclusion of the High Court to quash the criminal proceedings is on the basis of its
assessment of the statements recorded under Section 161 CrPC. Statements of
witnesses recorded under Section 161 (2020) 3 SCC 317 CrPC being wholly
inadmissible in evidence cannot be taken into consideration by the Court, while
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154509779/ 24
Vinoth Kumar vs State Of Karnataka on 20 December, 2023
adjudicating a petition filed under Section 482 CrPC [Rajendra Singh v. State of U.P.,
(2007) 7 SCC 378: (2007) 3 SCC (Cri) 375] .
11. Moreover, the High Court was aware that one of the witnesses mentioned that the
deceased informed him about the harassment meted out by Respondents 1 to 3 which
she was not able to bear and hence wanted to commit suicide. The High Court
committed an error in quashing criminal proceedings by assessing the statements
under Section 161 CrPC."
(Emphasis supplied) The Apex Court holds that the statements relied on by the accused in his
defence cannot be looked into in the event they would require evidence and the facts therein are
seriously disputed. These are few of the judgments which are rendered by the Apex Court which
direct non-interference. The Apex Court, has further, in plethora of judgments has followed the very
principle. Referring to them would only result in the bulk of the present order, as they are all settled
principles of law. Interference by this Court under Section 482 of the CrPC cannot be a blanket
sweeping exercise. It has to be on a case to case basis.
12. In the light of the judgments rendered by the Apex Court, the considered view of this Court is
that, the matter would not require any interference at this stage, as it is shrouded with seriously
disputed questions of fact. The only legal contention that merit consideration to be answered is, the
order of reference by the learned Magistrate to the jurisdictional Police Station for investigation, as
the contention is that it bears no application of mind and is contrary to the judgment of the Apex
Court in the case of PRIYANKA SRIVASTAVA v. STATE OF U.P. (supra). Both these submissions do
not hold water, as the order of reference by the learned Magistrate under Section 156(3) does bear
application of mind, though it is wrongly worded as order of taking cognizance.
The order reads as follows:
"ORDER OF TAKING COGNIZANCE This is a private complaint filed by the
complainant against the accused persons u/s 200 of CrPC praying to refer the matter
for investigation to SHO of Cubbon Park Police Station.
2. Perused the case papers available on record along with the affidavit submitted by
the complainant. On perusal of the affidavit and documents it is evident that the
complainant has approached the SHO, Cubbon Park Police Station and DCP, Central
Zone, Cubbon Park, Bangalore to take action against the accused persons but they
have not taken any action.
3. On perusal of the offences made out in the complaint it can be seen that the alleged
offences are cognizable offences and cheating and forgery are involved.
As such, in order to find out the truth it is just and necessary to refer the matter to
SHO, Cubbon Park Police Station for investigation and submit the report.
Accordingly, by invoking provisions of Section 156(3) CrPC the matter is hereby
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154509779/ 25
Vinoth Kumar vs State Of Karnataka on 20 December, 2023
referred to SHO, Cubbon Park Police Station for investigation and submit report.
Await report. Call on 20-08-2019."
The aforementioned order cannot be dubbed as one that suffer from non-application of mind. For
reference to investigation what is recorded by the concerned Court on 22-07-2019, in the considered
view of the Court, would suffice.
13. The other submission with regard to non-compliance with the judgment of the Apex Court in the
case of PRIYANKA SRIVASTAVA (supra) would again tumble down, as the complaint clearly
narrated the efforts that the complainant has made while seeking to register the complaint before
the jurisdictional Police and also to the higher authorities as is necessary under Section 154(1) and
154(3) of the CrPC.
14. The other ground is with regard to delay in registering the private complaint. The complaint
narrates the reason for such delay and it is not the law that delay in all cases would vitiate the
proceedings. It is only unexplained delay that would vitiate the proceedings. The complainant
narrates as to when the complainant comes to know of the act of transfer of shares standing in his
name and that fact becomes a triggering point for registration of the complaint, initially before the
jurisdictional police and later a private complaint before the learned Magistrate. All these factors
would require evidence for the petitioners to come out clean. The case does not come within the
postulates laid down by the Apex Court in the case of STATE OF HARYANA v. BHAJAN LAL - 1992
Supp (1) SCC 335 as followed in NEEHARIKA INFRASTRUCTURE PRIVATE LIMITED v. STATE
OF MAHARASHTRA7 wherein the Apex Court has held as follows:
"Conclusions:
80. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, our final conclusions on the
principal/core issue, whether the High Court would be justified in passing an interim
order of stay of investigation and/or "no coercive steps to be adopted", during the
pendency of the quashing petition under Section 482 Cr. P.C. and/or under Article
226 of the Constitution of India and in what circumstances and whether the High
Court would be justified in passing the order of not to arrest the accused or "no
coercive steps to be adopted" during the investigation or till the final
report/chargesheet is filed under Section 173 Cr.
2021 SCC OnLine SC 315 P.C., while dismissing/disposing of/not entertaining/not quashing the
criminal proceedings/ complaint/FIR in exercise of powers under Section 482 Cr. P.C. and/or under
Article 226 of the Constitution of India, our final conclusions are as under:
i) Police has the statutory right and duty under the relevant provisions of the Code of
Criminal Procedure contained in Chapter XIV of the Code to investigate into a
cognizable offence;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154509779/ 26
Vinoth Kumar vs State Of Karnataka on 20 December, 2023
ii) Courts would not thwart any investigation into the cognizable offences;
iii) It is only in cases where no cognizable offence or offence of any kind is disclosed
in the first information report that the Court will not permit an investigation to go on;
iv) The power of quashing should be exercised sparingly with circumspection, as it
has been observed, in the 'rarest of rare cases (not to be confused with the formation
in the context of death penalty).
v) While examining an FIR/complaint, quashing of which is sought, the court cannot
embark upon an enquiry as to the reliability or genuineness or otherwise of the
allegations made in the FIR/complaint;
vi) Criminal proceedings ought not to be scuttled at the initial stage;
vii) Quashing of a complaint/FIR should be an exception rather than an ordinary
rule;
viii) Ordinarily, the courts are barred from usurping the jurisdiction of the police,
since the two organs of the State operate in two specific spheres of activities and one
ought not to tread over the other sphere;
ix) The functions of the judiciary and the police are complementary, not overlapping;
x) Save in exceptional cases where non-
interference would result in miscarriage of justice, the Court and the judicial process
should not interfere at the stage of investigation of offences;
xi) Extraordinary and inherent powers of the Court do not confer an arbitrary
jurisdiction on the Court to act according to its whims or caprice;
xii) The first information report is not an encyclopaedia which must disclose all facts
and details relating to the offence reported.
Therefore, when the investigation by the police is in progress, the court should not go into the merits
of the allegations in the FIR. Police must be permitted to complete the investigation. It would be
premature to pronounce the conclusion based on hazy facts that the complaint/FIR does not
deserve to be investigated or that it amounts to abuse of process of law. After investigation, if the
investigating officer finds that there is no substance in the application made by the complainant, the
investigating officer may file an appropriate report/summary before the learned Magistrate which
may be considered by the learned Magistrate in accordance with the known procedure;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154509779/ 27
Vinoth Kumar vs State Of Karnataka on 20 December, 2023
xiii) The power under Section 482 Cr. P.C. is very wide, but conferment of wide power requires the
court to be more cautious. It casts an onerous and more diligent duty on the court;
xiv) However, at the same time, the court, if it thinks fit, regard being had to the parameters of
quashing and the self-restraint imposed by law, more particularly the parameters laid down by this
Court in the cases of R.P. Kapur (supra) and Bhajan Lal (supra), has the jurisdiction to quash the
FIR/complaint;
xv) When a prayer for quashing the FIR is made by the alleged accused and the court when it
exercises the power under Section 482 Cr. P.C., only has to consider whether the allegations in the
FIR disclose commission of a cognizable offence or not. The court is not required to consider on
merits whether or not the merits of the allegations make out a cognizable offence and the court has
to permit the investigating agency/police to investigate the allegations in the FIR;
xvi) The aforesaid parameters would be applicable and/or the aforesaid aspects are required to be
considered by the High Court while passing an interim order in a quashing petition in exercise of
powers under Section 482 Cr. P.C. and/or under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
However, an interim order of stay of
investigation during the pendency of the
quashing petition can be passed with
circumspection. Such an interim order should not require to be passed routinely, casually and/or
mechanically. Normally, when the investigation is in progress and the facts are hazy and the entire
evidence/material is not before the High Court, the High Court should restrain itself from passing
the interim order of not to arrest or "no coercive steps to be adopted" and the accused should be
relegated to apply for anticipatory bail under Section 438 Cr. P.C. before the competent court. The
High Court shall not and as such is not justified in passing the order of not to arrest and/or "no
coercive steps" either during the investigation or till the investigation is completed and/or till the
final report/charge sheet is filed under Section 173 Cr. P.C., while dismissing/disposing of the
quashing petition under Section 482 Cr. P.C. and/or under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
xvii) Even in a case where the High Court is prima facie of the opinion that an exceptional case is
made out for grant of interim stay of further investigation, after considering the broad parameters
while exercising the powers under Section 482 Cr. P.C. and/or under Article 226 of the Constitution
of India referred to hereinabove, the High Court has to give brief reasons why such an interim order
is warranted and/or is required to be passed so that it can demonstrate the application of mind by
the Court and the higher forum can consider what was weighed with the High Court while passing
such an interim order.
xviii) Whenever an interim order is passed by the High Court of "no coercive steps to be adopted"
within the aforesaid parameters, the High Court must clarify what does it mean by "no coercive
steps to be adopted" as the term "no coercive steps to be adopted" can be said to be too vague and/or
broad which can be misunder-stood and/or misapplied."

15. Insofar as Criminal Petition preferred by the complainant in Criminal Petition No.10125 of 2021
is concerned, the same need not be considered in the light of non-entertainment of petitions
preferred by the accused. Therefore, the same would also merit rejection.
16. Therefore, in the light of the facts obtaining in the cases at hand and the judgments rendered by
the Apex Court noticed supra, I do not find any warrant to interfere with the impugned proceedings
and accordingly all the petitions are dismissed.
Consequently, pending applications if any, also stand disposed.
It is made clear that the observations made in the course of the order are only for the purpose of
consideration of the case of the petitioners under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. and the same would not
bind or influence the pending proceedings against any other accused including the petitioners.
