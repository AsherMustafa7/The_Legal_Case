V.K.Senthilkumaran vs M/S.Shriram Transport Finance Company ... on 1 December, 2021
Arbitrator appointed, vide Reference, dated 30.12.2019 in Arbitration
Agreement, dated 19.03.2013.
For petitioner : M/s.Sharath Chandran in O.P.No.360 of 2021
For respondents: Mr.B.Logesh for R-1 in O.P.No.360 of 2021
COMMON ORDER
In all the above Original Petitions (O.Ps), appointment of Arbitrator, vide reference dated
30.12.2019 by the first respondent, is put to challenge on two grounds, that, one the same is illegal
and void in terms of the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, and also in view of
the law laid down by the Honourable Supreme Court of India on the subject matter. According to
the petitioner, the arbitration clause in the agreement is against the principles laid down by the
Supreme Court of India in the cases reported in 2019 SCC OnLine SC 1517 (Parkins Eastman
Architects DPC and another Vs. HSCC (India) Limited) and 2021 (5) SCC 738 (Bharat Sanchar
Nigam Limited Vs. Nortel Networks India Private Limited). Hence, unilateral appointment of
arbitrator P.Rosaiah, is in https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis O.P.Nos.360 to 362 of 2021
contravention of the provisions of the said Act and also the said decisions of the Supreme Court.
2. Short facts which gave rise to the filing of the present Original Petitions (O.Ps) are that the
petitioner has approached the first respondent-
Company for the vehicle loan facility which was executed by them on 19.03.2013 (in O.P.No.360 of
2021), 16.03.2013 (in O.P.No.361 of 2021) and 20.03.2013 (in O.P.No.362 of 2021) and loans were
advanced and be repaid in instalments as stipulated in the agreement. Dispute arose under the
agreement and therefore, the first respondent-Company unilaterally invoked the arbitration clause
and issued notice on 30.12.2019, calling upon the petitioner for payment of the outstanding
amount(s) due to them and in case of any default of the payment, the dispute will be referred to sole
arbitrator and accordingly, Mr.P.Rosaish, a retired District Judge was appointed as Arbitrator.
3. The present O.Ps. are filed challenging the said agreement and also notice dated 30.12.2019
unilaterally appointing the Arbitrator on the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis O.P.Nos.360 to 362
of 2021 ground that the first respondent-Company cannot unilaterally appoint the Arbitrator and
that the reference to arbitration is beyond the period of limitation.
4. The learned counsel for the petitioner(s) submitted that the present appointment of Arbitrator is
almost a paid employee of the first respondent-Company and he cannot conduct impartial
arbitration proceedings. According to the learned counsel, cyclo-styled format is being followed by
the said Arbitrator and the very same Arbitrator had conducted numerous proceedings without
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151000047/ 2
V.K.Senthilkumaran vs M/S.Shriram Transport Finance Company ... on 1 December, 2021
following any due process of law and illegally helping the first respondent-Company to recover the
monies which were clearly time-barred and not due to them.
5. In the conduct of the arbitration proceedings, no semblance of principles of natural justice is
being followed and many a time, the Arbitrator operates from the first respondent-Company's
address. As a matter of fact, it is imperative on the part of the learned Arbitrator to disclose his past
and present relationship with the interested parties. The https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
O.P.Nos.360 to 362 of 2021 learned counsel also cited a decision of the Bombay High Court in the
case of Sawarmal Gadodia Vs. Tata Capital Financial Services Limited, in Arb.P.No.562 of 2019, in
which, by order dated 15.05.2019, the Award was set aside on the ground that non-disclosure of
relationship, was fatal.
6. In the above circumstances, the borrower cannot expect impartial consideration of his or her
defence against the claim. Moreover, the Courts have frowned upon such unilateral appointment of
Arbitrator and held that such appointment cannot be countenanced in law. Apart from the same, the
proceedings are also hit by law of limitation, since the agreement was entered into in 2013 and the
arbitration notice was issued only in 2019, much after the expiry of limitation. There is nothing on
record to show that the limitation was extended by the act of the parties.
7. On the above significant grounds, the learned counsel for the petitioner assailed the notice
appointing the Arbitrator.
8. The learned counsel while referring to the above decision of the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
O.P.Nos.360 to 362 of 2021 Supreme Court reported in 2019 SCC OnLine SC 1517 (Perkins Eastman
Architects DPC and another Vs. HSCC (India) Ltd) in regard to the first legal objection with regard
to the unilateral appointment of the Arbitrator, has particularly referred to paragraphs 21, 24 and 25
therein, which are extracted hereunder:
"21. But, in our view that has to be the logical deduction from TRF Limited (TRF
Limited Vs. Energo Engineering Projects Limited = 2017 (8) SCC 377). Paragraph 50
of the decision shows that this Court was concerned with the issue, “whether the
Managing Director, after becoming ineligible by operation of law, is he still eligible to
nominate an Arbitrator” The ineligibility referred to therein, was as a result of
operation of law, in that a person having an interest in the dispute or in the outcome
or decision thereof, must not only be ineligible to act as an arbitrator but must also
not be eligible to appoint anyone else as an arbitrator and that such person cannot
and should not have any role in charting out any course to the dispute resolution by
having the power to appoint an arbitrator. The next sentences in the paragraph,
further show that cases where both the parties could nominate respective arbitrators
of their choice were found to be completely a different situation.
The reason is clear that whatever advantage a party may derive by nominating an arbitrator of its
choice would get counter balanced by equal power with the other party. But, in a case where only
one party has a right to appoint a sole arbitrator, its choice will always have an element of exclusivity
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151000047/ 3
V.K.Senthilkumaran vs M/S.Shriram Transport Finance Company ... on 1 December, 2021
in https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis O.P.Nos.360 to 362 of 2021 determining or charting the course
for dispute resolution. Naturally, the person who has an interest in the outcome or decision of the
dispute must not have the power to appoint a sole arbitrator. That has to be taken as the essence of
the amendments brought in by the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015 (Act 3 of
2016) and recognised by the decision of this Court in TRF Limited (TRF Limited Vs. Energo
Engineering Projects Limited = 2017 (8) SCC
377).
24. In Voestalpine (Voestalpine Schienen Gmbh Vs. Delhi Metro Rail Corpn. Ltd. - 2017 (4) SCC
665), this Court dealt with independence and impartiality of the arbitrator as under:
“20. Independence and impartiality of the arbitrator are the hallmarks of any arbitration
proceedings. Rule against bias is one of the fundamental principles of natural justice which applied
to all judicial and quasi- judicial proceedings. It is for this reason that notwithstanding the fact that
relationship between the parties to the arbitration and the arbitrators themselves are contractual in
nature and the source of an arbitrator's appointment is deduced from the agreement entered into
between the parties, notwithstanding the same non- independence and nonimpartiality of such
arbitrator (though contractually agreed upon) would render him ineligible to conduct the
arbitration. The genesis behind this rational is that even when an https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
O.P.Nos.360 to 362 of 2021 arbitrator is appointed in terms of contract and by the parties to the
contract, he is independent of the parties. Functions and duties require him to rise above the
partisan interest of the parties and not to act in, or so as to further, the particular interest of either
parties. After all, the arbitrator has adjudicatory role to perform and, therefore, he must be
independent of parties as well as impartial. The United Kingdom Supreme Court has beautifully
highlighted this aspect in Hashwani vs. Jivraj (2011 (1) WLR 1872 : 2011 UKSC 40) in the following
words : (WLR p. 1889, para 45) “45. … the dominant purpose of appointing an arbitrator or
arbitrators is the impartial resolution of the dispute between the parties in accordance with the
terms of the agreement and, although the contract between the parties and the arbitrators would be
a contract for the provision of personal services, they were not personal services under the direction
of the parties.”
21. Similarly, Cour de Cassation, France, in a judgment delivered in 1972 in Consorts Ury,
underlined that:
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis O.P.Nos.360 to 362 of 2021 “an independent mind
is indispensable in the exercise of judicial power, whatever the source of that power
may be, and it is one of the essential qualities of an arbitrator.”
22. Independence and impartiality are two different concepts. An arbitrator may be independent
and yet, lack impartiality, or vice versa.
Impartiality, as is well accepted, is a more subjective concept as compared to independence.
Independence, which is more an objective concept, may, thus, be more straightforwardly
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151000047/ 4
V.K.Senthilkumaran vs M/S.Shriram Transport Finance Company ... on 1 December, 2021
ascertained by the parties at the outset of the arbitration proceedings in light of the circumstances
disclosed by the arbitrator, while partiality will more likely surface during the arbitration
proceedings.
…….…..……
30. Time has come to send positive signals to the international business community, in order to
create healthy arbitration environment and conducive arbitration culture in this country. Further, as
highlighted by the Law Commission also in its report, duty becomes more onerous in government
contracts, where one of the parties to the dispute is the Government or public sector undertaking
itself and the authority to appoint the arbitrator rests with it. In the instant case also, though choice
is given by DMRC to the opposite party but it is limited to choose an
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis O.P.Nos.360 to 362 of 2021 arbitrator from the panel prepared by
DMRC. It, therefore, becomes imperative to have a much broadbased panel, so that there is no
misapprehension that principle of impartiality and independence would be discarded at any stage of
the proceedings, specially at the stage of constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal. We, therefore, direct
that DMRC shall prepare a broadbased panel on the aforesaid lines, within a period of two months
from today.”
25. In the light of the aforestated principles, the report of the Law Commission and the decision in
Voestalpine Schienen Gmbh (Voestalpine Schienen Gmbh Vs. Delhi Metro Rail Corpn. Ltd - 2017
(4) SCC 665), the imperatives of creating healthy arbitration environment demand that the instant
application deserves acceptance."
9. The learned counsel for the petitioner, in regard to the aspect of limitation, referred to the
following decisions:
(i) 2021 (5) SCC 738 (Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited Vs. Nortel Networks India
Private Limited):
"45. ...
45.1. ...
..... At the referral stage, the Court can interfere https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
O.P.Nos.360 to 362 of 2021 "only" when it is "manifest" that the claims are ex face
time-barred and dead, or there is no subsisting dispute. ......
...
"48. Applying the law to the facts of the present case, it is clear that this is a case
where the claims are ex facie time-barred by over 5½ years, since Nortel did not take
any action whatsoever after the rejection of its claim by BSNL on 4-8- 2014. The
notice of arbitration was invoked on 29- 4-2020. There is not even an averment
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151000047/ 5
V.K.Senthilkumaran vs M/S.Shriram Transport Finance Company ... on 1 December, 2021
either in the notice of arbitration, or the petition filed under Section 11, or before this
Court, of any intervening facts which may have occurred, which would extend the
period of limitation falling within Sections 5 to 20 of the Limitation Act. Unless, there
is a pleaded case specifically adverting to the applicable section, and how it extends
the limitation from the date on which the cause of action originally arose, there can
be no basis to save the time of limitation.
49. The present case is a case of deadwood/no subsisting dispute since the cause of
action arose on 4-8-2014, when the claims made by Nortel were rejected by BSNL.
The respondent has not stated any event which would extend the period of limitation,
which commenced as per Article 55 of the Schedule of the Limitation Act (which
provides the limitation for cases pertaining to breach of contract) immediately after
the rejection of the final bill by making deductions.
50. In the notice invoking arbitration dated 29-4-2020, it has been averred that:
“Various communications have been https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis O.P.Nos.360
to 362 of 2021 exchanged between the petitioner and the respondents ever since and
a dispute has arisen between the petitioner and the respondents, regarding
non-payment of the amounts due under the tender document.”
51. The period of limitation for issuing notice of arbitration would not get extended
by mere exchange of letters, [S.S. Rathore v. State of M.P., (1989) 4 SCC 582 : 1990
SCC (L&S) 50; Union of India v. Har Dayal, (2010) 1 SCC 394; CLP (India) (P) Ltd. v.
Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd., (2020) 5 SCC 185] or mere settlement discussions,
where a final bill is rejected by making deductions or otherwise. Sections 5 to 20 of
the Limitation Act do not exclude the time taken on account of settlement
discussions. Section 9 of the Limitation Act makes it clear that:“where once the time
has begun to run, no subsequent disability or inability to institute a suit or make an
application stops it.” There must be a clear notice invoking arbitration setting out the
“particular dispute” [ Section 21 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.]
(including claims/amounts) which must be received by the other party within a
period of 3 years from the rejection of a final bill, failing which, the time bar would
prevail.
52. In the present case, the notice invoking arbitration was issued 5½ years after
rejection of the claims on 4-8-2014. Consequently, the notice invoking arbitration is
ex facie time- barred, and the disputes between the parties cannot be referred to
arbitration in the facts of this case.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis O.P.Nos.360 to 362 of 2021 Conclusion
53. Accordingly, we hold that:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151000047/ 6
V.K.Senthilkumaran vs M/S.Shriram Transport Finance Company ... on 1 December, 2021
53.1. The period of limitation for filing an application under Section 11 would be
governed by Article 137 of the First Schedule of the Limitation Act, 1963. The period
of limitation will begin to run from the date when there is failure to appoint the
arbitrator. It has been suggested that Parliament may consider amending Section 11
of the 1996 Act to provide a period of limitation for filing an application under this
provision, which is in consonance with the object of expeditious disposal of
arbitration proceedings.
53.2. In rare and exceptional cases, where the claims are ex facie time-barred, and it
is manifest that there is no subsisting dispute, the Court may refuse to make the
reference.
... ... "
(ii) The learned counsel for the petitioner also relied on Order dated 29.09.2020 passed by this
Court in O.P.No.758 of 2015 (P.Kothai and another Vs. Shiram Transport Finance Company Ltd.
and two others), wherein, he relied on paragraphs 12 to 15 and 22, which are extracted hereunder:
"12. This Court having set out the rival submissions, now proceeds to discuss the rival
submissions, give its dispositive reasoning for https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
O.P.Nos.360 to 362 of 2021 arriving at a conclusion and giving its verdict. As already
delineated and alluded to supra, learned counsel for petitioners chose to argue the
captioned OP on one point notwithstanding very many averments in the OP and that
one point is limitation. This Court is clear in its mind that the provisions of
Limitation Act will apply to arbitration proceedings owing to Section 43 of A and C
Act, which reads as follows:
"43. Limitations. (1) The Limitation Act, 1963 (36 of 1963), shall apply to arbitrations
as it applies to proceedings in Court.
(2) For the purposes of this section and the Limitation Act, 1963 (36 of 1963), an
arbitration shall be deemed to have commenced on the date referred in section 21.
(3) Where an arbitration agreement to submit future disputes to arbitration provides
that any claim to which the agreement applies shall be barred unless some step to
commence arbitral proceedings is taken within a time fixed by the agreement, and a
dispute arises to which the agreement applies, the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
O.P.Nos.360 to 362 of 2021 Court, if it is of opinion that in the circumstances of the
case undue hardship would otherwise be caused, and notwithstanding that the time
so fixed has expired, may on such terms, if any, as the justice of the case may require,
extend the time for such period as it thinks proper.
(4)Where the Court orders that an arbitral award be set aside, the period between the
commencement of the arbitration and the date of the order of the Court shall be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151000047/ 7
V.K.Senthilkumaran vs M/S.Shriram Transport Finance Company ... on 1 December, 2021
excluded in computing the time prescribed by the Limitation Act, 1963 (36 of 1963),
for the commencement of the proceedings (including arbitration) with respect to the
dispute so submitted'.
13. As Limitation Act is applicable to arbitration proceedings, it is certainly open to the petitioner in
a Section 34 application to argue that arbitration proceedings are barred by limitation. The next
limb which needs to be looked into is, limitation being founded on public policy is terra firma in a
ocean of laws / legal principles and this is https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis O.P.Nos.360 to 362 of
2021 because, limitation has to be examined even in cases where it is not set up as a defence by the
defendant. This principle is ingrained in Section 3 of the Limitation Act. As limitation is terra firma
founded on public policy, there is no doubt that limitation can certainly be raised as a point to say
that an arbitral award is vitiated for being in conflict with public policy.
14. With regard to the case on hand, what is of utmost relevance is, even according to the impugned
award and according to the undisputed submissions made by both sides, default commenced from
first EMI. The first EMI, as mentioned supra, is payable on 16.03.2007. On a extreme demurrer
even if the 36th EMI is considered as the reckoning date, 36th EMI fell due on 16.03.2010 and
therefore, Ex.C4 legal notice dated 29.08.2014, which is the only communication referred to in the
impugned award, is clearly beyond three years from the date of cause of action.
15. With regard to the submission of learned counsel for NBFC that there was some correspondence
prior to 2014 i.e, sometime in 2010, the same is not before this Court. In any event, it
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis O.P.Nos.360 to 362 of 2021 cannot be placed before this Court in
the light of Canara Nidhi Limited principle laid down by Hon- ble Supreme Court in Canara Nidhi
Limited vs M. Shashikala reported in 2019 SCC Online SC 1244, wherein it has been made clear that
only those documents which were part of the arbitral proceedings can be placed before a Court in
Section 34 proceedings and if any other document is to be introduced, the same has to be done only
by taking leave of the Court. There is nothing of that sort or in other words no application in this
regard in the instant case on hand.
22. A perusal of Appendix of Evidence reveals that the only notice post said contract i.e., loan
agreement dated 16.02.2007, which was before the AT, is legal notice from NBFC dated 29.08.2014,
which has been marked as Ex.C4. It is also to be noticed that there is no other document before the
AT. This makes it clear that the trigger notice is clearly barred by limitation and therefore, the
impugned award is vitiated for entertaining arbitral proceedings which are barred by limitation and
not examining limitation though Section 3 of Limitation Act read with Section 43 of A and C Act
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis O.P.Nos.360 to 362 of 2021 makes it statutorily imperative to do
so even if it is not set up as a defence. ...
10. According to the learned counsel, in terms of Section 43 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,
the limitation shall apply to arbitration, as it applies to the regular proceedings in Court.
11. In the above decision of this Court, a learned Judge had dealt with the issue in detail and held
that the limitation is applicable to the arbitration proceedings. Further, the learned Judge factually
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151000047/ 8
V.K.Senthilkumaran vs M/S.Shriram Transport Finance Company ... on 1 December, 2021
held in that case that the claim made therein was time-barred in respect of the very same first
respondent herein under similar circumstances.
12. Therefore, learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that on both the above legal submissions,
he is entitled to succeed in these O.Ps.
13. On behalf of the first respondent-Company, a learned counsel https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
O.P.Nos.360 to 362 of 2021 is present and he made his submissions. He perfunctorily reiterated the
facts that led to the initiation of the arbitral proceedings and the questionable appointment of the
arbitrator by the first respondent-Company. However, as an effective response to the legal objection
raised on behalf of the petitioners, there has been no plausible submission forthcoming, except
contending that there is nothing wrong with the appointment of the Arbitrator.
14. In regard to the first legal objection, this Court finds that what flows from the ratio laid down by
the Honourable Supreme Court in the above referred decision is that, it is legally no more open to a
person or entity to appoint an arbitrator who has an interest in the outcome or decision of the
arbitration. Such unilateral appointment would take away the concept of independence and
impartiality of the arbitration, which are held to be the hallmarks of arbitration proceedings.
15. In these cases, it could be seen that multitude of arbitration proceedings had been concluded in
favour of the first respondent-Company, mechanically or without any pretension of impartial
adjudication. The https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis O.P.Nos.360 to 362 of 2021 arbitrator has gone
about discharging his duties dutifully as a paid employee and servant of the first
respondent-Company. Such arbitral exercise is a mockery of a dispute resolution
mechanism/regime created under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
16. This Court, as a matter of fact, has witnessed several cliched/templated awards put to challenge
by the aggrieved parties passed by the same learned Arbitrator. In all the cases, the learned
Arbitrator has gone through the motion summarily, treating the proceedings as an empty ritual.
Such arbitration proceedings are nothing but a charade and cannot be countenanced in law.
17. The awards fashioned on such shoddy and sham proceeding in the name of the arbitral exercise
in terms of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, without a modicum of judicious application,
amounted to caricaturing of dispute resolution mechanism. Stereotyping justice dispensation
favouring one party alone, notwithstanding any possible legal defence against the recovery of claim,
is a violative of the letter and spirit of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis O.P.Nos.360 to 362 of 2021
the Act, 1996.
18. Moreover, in terms of Section 12(1) of the Amended Act, 2015 (3 of 2016) (of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act), read with Clauses 22 and 24 of the Fifth Schedule, if the appointment of the
Arbitrator herein gives rise to a justifiable doubt as to the independence or impartiality, the
mandate of the Arbitrator is liable to be terminated. The relevant Clauses as aforementioned are
extracted hereunder:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151000047/ 9
V.K.Senthilkumaran vs M/S.Shriram Transport Finance Company ... on 1 December, 2021
"Fifth Schedule (Refer Section 12(1)(b)) The following grounds give rise to justifiable
doubts as to the independence or impartiality of arbitrators:
.. ..
Previous services for one of the parties or other involvement in the case ...
22. The arbitrator has within the past three years been appointed as arbitrator on two
or more occasions by one of the parties or an affiliate of one of the parties.
.. ...
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis O.P.Nos.360 to 362 of 2021
24. The arbitrator currently serves, or has served within the past three years, as arbitrator in another
arbitration on a related issue involving one of the parties or an affiliate of one of the parties.
..."
The scheme of the Act, 1996, thus place paramountcy on the independence and impartiality in the
appointment of the Arbitrator.
19. No doubt, the claimants cannot be denied of their right to recover the monies due to them, but it
does not mean that the claimants are entitled to resort to unfair, unjust and ignoble means towards
realisation of their outstanding dues.
20. On facts, in these cases, loan agreement was entered into in the year 2013. The agreement is said
to have expired on 20.09.2015. The default in payments of EMDs appeared to have occurred from
the year 2013 onwards. However, the notice of appointment of Arbitrator is dated 30.12.2019. In the
notice, nothing has been stated or explained as to any https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
O.P.Nos.360 to 362 of 2021 action taken by the first respondent during the loan period from 2013 to
2019. In the circumstances, the claim is ex-facie barred by limitation. The Courts have held that
dead-woods needed to be weeded out at the threshold.
This is one such case where the claims for recovery is barred by limitation and on this ground alone,
the prayer in the O.Ps. is liable to be allowed.
21. This Court is in agreement with the submissions made on behalf of the learned counsel for the
petitioner. By applying the above cited legal principles laid down by the Honourable Supreme Court
and this Court, both on the appointment of Arbitrator and on non-enforceability of the claim, as the
same being hit by limitation, the O.Ps. are liable to be allowed.
22. Accordingly, the present O.Ps. are allowed. Consequently, A.Nos.1846 to 1848 of 2021 are
closed. No costs.
