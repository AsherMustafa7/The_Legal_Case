2. This revision is filed by the petitioner under Section 19(1) of the Family Courts Act, 1984 against
the order dated 6.8.2016 passed by the learned Judge, Family Court, Manipur in Judl. Misc. Case
No.64 of 2016 in Mat. (G&W) Case No.24 of 2015.
3. The husband has filed Judl. Misc. Case No.64 of 2016 challenging the territorial jurisdiction of the
Family Court, Manipur to entertain Mat. (G&W) Case No.24 of 2015 and sought direction to return
Mat. (G&W) Case No.24 of 2015 to file a suit before the Court at Kamrup District having jurisdiction
where the minor children ordinarily resides.
4. Mat. (G&W) Case No.24 of 2015 has been filed by the wife under Section 25 of the Guardians &
Wards Act, 1890 praying for declaration to declare that the wife as guardian for the custody of three
minor children.
5. Mr. Kh. Santa, the learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that three minor children were
brought forcibly on 27.2.2012 by the respondent from the custody of the petitioner from her
residential place Kongba Kshetri Leikai, Imphal East, without her consent and against the wish of
the minor children and then left Imphal separating the mother-child relationship inhumane. The
learned counsel would submit that after residing for some months at Dimapur, Nagaland and after
the incident of rescuing the minor RP (FAM. CT) No. 2 of 2016 (Ref :- Judl. Misc. Case No. 64 of
2016,Mat. (G&W) Case No. 24 of 2015 Page |3 children by the petitioner from the respondent, the
place of residence of the respondent has been shifted and settled at Guwahati keeping three children
at the hostel of their respective school at Guwahati.
6. The learned counsel further submitted that the marriage between the petitioner and the
respondent was dissolved on 21.7.2015 by the Court of law. However, the incident of taking over the
minor children from the custody of the petitioner was made much prior to the passing of the order
dated 21.7.2015.
7. The learned counsel for the petitioner urged that the learned Judge of the Family Court erred in
observing that the minor children are permanently settled at Guwahati at the time of filing the
petition by the petitioner for appointment as guardian of the person. The learned Judge also erred in
observing that when the petition was filed by the petitioner, the minors had already been living at
Guwahati and the Court at Kamrup District would have jurisdiction to entertain the petition as laid
down under Section 9(1) of the Guardians & Wards Act, 1984. The learned Judge also erred in
allowing the petition filed by the respondent and returned the petition to the petitioner thereby
directing her to present the same before the Court at Kamrup District.

Smt. Telem Robita Devi vs Shri Ramesh Kumar Gupta on 30 October, 2023
8. According to the learned counsel, the learned Judge ought to have allowed the petition filed by
the respondent and the Family Court, Manipur is having territorial jurisdiction over the claim made
by the petitioner in Mat. (G&W) Case No.24 of 2015. Thus, a prayer has been made to set aside the
order dated 6.8.2016 passed by the learned Judge of the Family Court in Judl. Misc. Case No.64 of
2016. In support, the learned counsel for the petitioner placed reliance upon the following decisions:
(i) K.C.Sashidhar v. Roopa, AIR 1993
Karnataka 120.
(ii) Order dated 9.8.2017 passed in MAT App.
No.1 of 2017 on the file of the High Court of
Manipur.
9. Per contra, Mr. P. Tomcha, the learned counsel for the respondent submitted that on the
allegation of threats to the life of the respondent while staying in Manipur, he has been settled at
Guwahati and he is not in a position to come to Manipur and appear before the Family Court,
Manipur. As such, his counsel, filed Judl. Misc. Case No.64 of 2016 by putting his signature on
behalf of the respondent without disclosing the details of the factum of the alleged charges and
particulars of persons, if any threats received by him. Taking into consideration that since the minor
children are RP (FAM. CT) No. 2 of 2016 (Ref :- Judl. Misc. Case No. 64 of 2016,Mat. (G&W) Case
No. 24 of 2015 Page |5 living with the respondent within Kamrup District and are studying within
the territorial jurisdiction of Kamrup District and the respondent is taking care of the minors, the
learned Judge rightly came to the conclusion that the minors had already been living at Guwahati
and the Family Court, Manipur has no jurisdiction to entertain the case or declaration of guardian of
the minors and the learned Judge has rightly ordered return of the petition to the petitioner for
presentation before the Court at Kamrup District. Since the order of the learned Judge, Family
Court is well considered one, there is no need to interfere with the same and thus, a prayer is made
to dismiss the present petition.
10. This Court considered the rival submissions and also perused the materials available on record.
11. The plea of the respondent herein is that due to certain facts in the life of the respondent while
living in Manipur, he along with his minor children were compelled to leave Manipur and settle at
Guwahati and for the past 10 years, they are residing at Guwahati. According to the respondent, the
ordinary place of residence of the respondent and the minors is at Dona Presidency D-1, six Mile
V.I.P. Road Chachal, Guwahati, Assam. The said fact has not been disputed by the petitioner.

Smt. Telem Robita Devi vs Shri Ramesh Kumar Gupta on 30 October, 2023
12. Judl. Misc. Case No.64 of 2016 has been filed by the learned conducting counsel for the
respondent based on authorisation given by the respondent and accordingly sworn before the
Family Court stating that under Section 9(1) of the Guardian and Wards Act, 1890, if the application
is with respect of the guardianship of the person of the minor, it shall be made to the District Court
having jurisdiction in the place where the minor ordinarily resides.
13. Opposing Judl. Misc. Case No.64 of 2016, the petitioner contended that no document in support
of authorisation of the learned counsel to file the petition has been produced and, as such, the
conducting counsel has no authority and power to file Judl. Misc. Case No.64 of 2016. The said
aspect has been duly considered by the learned Judge and this Court does not wish to interfere with
the same.
14. According to the petitioner, while living together at Imphal along with their three minor
children, the respondent betrayed the petitioner and left Manipur by taking the three minor children
without the consent and knowledge of the petitioner. After a search, the petitioner came to know
that the respondent temporarily shifted his place of residence at Guwahati and her minor children
are now studying at Guwahati.
RP (FAM. CT) No. 2 of 2016 (Ref :- Judl. Misc. Case No. 64 of 2016,Mat. (G&W) Case No. 24 of 2015

15. Drawing this Court's attention to the provisions of Section 6 and 7 of the Guardian and Wards
Act, 1890, the learned counsel for the petitioner argued that the petition, namely Mat. (G&W) Case
No.24 of 2015 filed by the petitioner is well maintainable before the Family Court and the learned
Judge, Family Court, ought not to have allowed the prayer of the respondent in Judl. Misc. Case
No.64 of 2016.
16. As rightly held by the learned Judge, Family Court, the respondent never raised any objection
regarding the jurisdiction of Family Court to entertain the proceeding in relation to guardianship of
the person or custody of the minor. In view of the above, this Court is of the view that there is no
need to further elaborate upon the issue qua jurisdiction of the Family Court.
17. The marriage between the petitioner and the respondent was dissolved by a decree of divorce on
21.7.2015. The forcible taking of the minor children alleged by the petitioner is on 27.2.2012. If
really, the respondent without the consent of the petitioner took the minor children with him and is
residing somewhere away from Manipur, the petitioner would have raised an objection about the
forcible custody of the minor children by the respondent. Admittedly, in the case on hand, the
petitioner has not raised any such objection at the relevant point of time. In fact, while RP (FAM.
CT) No. 2 of 2016 (Ref :- Judl. Misc. Case No. 64 of 2016,Mat. (G&W) Case No. 24 of 2015 Page |8
delivering the order in Mat. (Divorce) Suit No.59 of 2012, the learned Judge of Family Court,
extracted the terms and conditions arrived at between the parties and the same reads thus:
"1. The petitioner and the respondent mutually agreed to dissolve their marriage
which was performed on 3.11.1999 by a decree of divorce.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190865348/ 4
Smt. Telem Robita Devi vs Shri Ramesh Kumar Gupta on 30 October, 2023
2. The petitioner Ramesh Kumar Gupta agreed to pay a sum of Rs.5,00,000/-
(Rupees five lacs) only to his wife, the respondent, Smt. Telem Robita Devi as her
permanent alimony in respect of the dissolution of their marriage and the respondent
also had no objection to receive the said amount of alimony at the time of dissolution
of their marriage.
3. The respondent agreed that she will not claim any amount of her maintenance
allowance and any other movable/immovable property/properties from the
petitioner after the dissolution of the marriage."
18. Admittedly, the terms and conditions of the mutual agreement are silent about the custody of the
minor children, which implied that the minor children are in the custody of the respondent father at
time of arriving at settlement. Therefore, it cannot be contended that against the wishes of the
minors, the respondent took them forcibly from the custody of the petitioner mother and is RP
(FAM. CT) No. 2 of 2016 (Ref :- Judl. Misc. Case No. 64 of 2016,Mat. (G&W) Case No. 24 of 2015
Page |9 living at Guwahati. Further, the said aspect is not a matter of discussion in the present
petition. Since the petitioner has raised the plea that the respondent has taken the minors forcibly
from her custody, this Court discussed the same in this order. This will not in any way affect the
merits of Mat. (G&W) Case No.24 of 2015.
19. The point that arises for consideration in the present petition is whether the Family Court,
Manipur has jurisdiction to entertain Mat. (G&W) Case No.24 of 2015 or to return it to the
petitioner for presentation before the Court at Kamrup District where the minor children ordinarily
resides.
20. There is no dispute qua the power of the Family Court to entertain the case relating to
declaration of the guardianship of the minor.
21. According to the petitioner, the Family Court, Manipur has jurisdiction to try Mat. (G&W) Case
No.24 of 2015 filed by the petitioner. According to the petitioner, the Court at the place of residence
of mother would have jurisdiction to try suit. In support, the learned counsel placed reliance upon
the decision of the Karnataka High Court in the case of K.C.Sashidhar, supra, wherein the Karnataka
High Court held thus:
RP (FAM. CT) No. 2 of 2016 (Ref :- Judl. Misc. Case No. 64 of 2016,Mat. (G&W) Case
No. 24 of 2015 P a g e | 10 "5. In the instant case, since the chid is of tender age, the
legal guardian would be the mother and the place of her residence, on the date of the
presentation of the petition, is the place where it is to be construed as the minor
ordinarily resided" and as such the finding arrived at by the Court-below does not
suffer from any legal infirmities. Hence, the circumstances do not warrant
interference of this Court in exercise of its power under S.115 of the C.P.C.
Accordingly, this C.R.P. is dismissed. No costs."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/190865348/ 5
Smt. Telem Robita Devi vs Shri Ramesh Kumar Gupta on 30 October, 2023
22. On a thorough reading of the judgment of the Karnataka High Court, this Court is of the view
that the factual aspects involved in the said case are entirely different from that of the instant case.
Therefore, decision of the Karnataka High Court relied upon by the petitioner is not helpful to the
case of the petitioner as on the date of presentation of Mat. (G&W) Case No.24 of 2015, the minors
are residing away from the petitioner. In fact, in paragraph 5 of her petition, namely Mat. (G&W)
Case No.24 of 2015, the petitioner averred that "the respondent instead of bringing her three
children to her custody, left Imphal on the same day and later on learnt that the respondent was
staying at Dimapur along with her three children". Subsequently, in the objection filed in Judl. Misc.
Case No.64 of 2016, the petitioner has stated that "presently, the respondent has been residing at his
present temporary place of RP (FAM. CT) No. 2 of 2016 (Ref :- Judl. Misc. Case No. 64 of 2016,Mat.
(G&W) Case No. 24 of 2015 P a g e | 11 residence at Guwahati". The aforesaid averments of the
petitioner would clearly indicate that the minor children are residing with their father at Guwahati.
In view of the above, the Court at Kamrup District would have jurisdiction to entertain the petition
of the petitioner".
23. The learned counsel for the petitioner, by placing reliance upon the order dated 9.8.2017 of this
Court passed in MAT App. No.1 of 2017, submitted that without conducting any enquiry, the learned
Judge, Family Court, Manipur allowed the prayer of the respondent. As stated supra, since the
petitioner herself admitted that now the minors are residing along with the respondent at Guwahati,
the order in MAT App. No.1 of 2017, dated 9.8.2017 is not helpful to the case of the petitioner.
24. It is admitted by the parties that, now the minors are aged 22 years and 17 years respectively.
Therefore, this Court is of the considered view that the learned Judge, Family Court, Manipur, was
right in allowing the prayer of the respondent in Judl. Misc. Case No.64 of 2016 and, as such, rightly
ordered to return the petition of the petitioner, namely Mat. (G&W) Case No.24 of 2015, to present
the same before the Court at Kamrup District having appropriate jurisdiction. The said direction of
the learned Judge, Family Court cannot be find faulted. No valid grounds have been RP (FAM. CT)
No. 2 of 2016 (Ref :- Judl. Misc. Case No. 64 of 2016,Mat. (G&W) Case No. 24 of 2015 P a g e | 12
made out to interfere with the impugned order of the learned Judge, Family Court, Manipur.
25. In the result,
(i) RP (FAM.C.T.) No.2 of 2016 is dismissed.
(ii) No costs.
