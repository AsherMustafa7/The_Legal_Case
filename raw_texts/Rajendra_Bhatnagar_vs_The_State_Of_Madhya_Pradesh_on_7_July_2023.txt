Rajendra Bhatnagar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 7 July, 2023
punishable under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471, 477-A of IPC read with Section 120 of IPC.
Prosecution case, in brief, is that applicant along with co-accused Atul Awasthi being employee of
M/s Ambika Polymer, obtained a blank cheque of the Proprietor of the aforesaid company and made
manipulation therein and thereafter submitted the same for withdrawal of Rs.4.00 lacs.
Learned counsel for the applicant submits that the applicant himself submitted a criminal complaint
under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act against the Proprietor of M/s Ambika Polymers,
respondent No. 2, wherein parties have entered into an agreement, in pursuance of which, applicant
withdrew the criminal complaint filed under Section 138 of Negotiable Instrument Act, while
respondent No 2 did not withdraw the complaint filed against the applicant, wherein non-bailable
warrant was issued against the applicant. The applicant moved an application for bail before the
Trial Court wherein respondent No. 2 has submitted no objection, even then his application for bail
was rejected. The parties have already resolved their disputes and the applicant's custodial
interrogation is not required, therefore, considering the nature of dispute, he is entitled for
anticipatory bail.
Learned counsel for the respondent/State has vehemently opposed the prayer, while learned
counsel for the complainant has not opposed the prayer.
Heard the learned counsel for both the parties and perused the case diary. Upon perusal of the
record, it is apparent that this criminal case relates to criminal complaint filed by respondent No. 2
against the applicant and co- accused Atul Awasthi, wherein after recording of statement of the
complainant, case has been registered for offence punishable under Sections 420, 467,468, 471,
477-A r/w 120 of IPC.
Considering the nature of allegations alleged against the applicant and also considering the fact that
the parties have resolved their disputes and the complainant has no objection if the bail is granted to
the applicant, without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, the application is allowed.
It is directed that the applicant be released on bail upon furnishing personal bond in the sum of
Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand only) with a solvent surety in the like amount to the
satisfaction of the concerned Court for his appearance before the Trial Court on all such dates as
may be fixed in this behalf by the Trial Court during the pendency of trial. It is further directed that
applicant shall comply with the provisions of Section 437 (3) of Cr. P. C. This application is allowed
and stands disposed of.
Certified copy as per rules.
