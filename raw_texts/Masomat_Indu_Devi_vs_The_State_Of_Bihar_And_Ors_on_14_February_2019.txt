ORAL JUDGMENT & ORDER
Date : 14-02-2019
The petitioner, who is the wife of a late
employee, viz., Shyam Kishore Jha, has approached this
Court for a direction to the respondents to consider and
grant benefits of the Assured Career Progression Scheme to
Patna High Court CWJC No.15647 of 2017 dt.14-02-2019
2/18

Masomat Indu Devi vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 14 February, 2019
her late husband and to also give him time bond promotion
and only thereafter, fix the retirement benefit which would
be given to the petitioner.
2. The late employee, i.e., the husband of
the petitioner, joined service in a work-charged
establishment as a Gauze Reader on 22.10.1968, but was
regularized in the regular establishment in the Irrigation
Department as Accounts Clerk on 09.07.1981 on the pay-
scale of Rs. 730-1080 in the light of 4th Pay Revision
Report.
3. It is to be noted that in the light of 4th
Pay Revision Committee Report, the concept of time bond
promotion was introduced, entitling an employee to get the
1st time bond promotion after completion of 10 years of
service and the 2nd time bond promotion after completion of
25 years of service, in case such employee was not allowed
any regular promotion. The aforesaid scheme was dropped
with effect from 01.01.1996. Thereafter, the Bihar State
Employees Service Condition (Assured Career Progression
Scheme) Rules, 2003 (in short the A.C.P. Rules of 2003)
Patna High Court CWJC No.15647 of 2017 dt.14-02-2019
3/18
was brought about which also primarily aimed towards
diluting the effect of stagnation in service.
4. The contention of the petitioner is that the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/93531383/ 2
Masomat Indu Devi vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 14 February, 2019
late employee was entitled to get 1st time bond promotion
after 10 years of service with effect from 10.07.1991, but
the same was never given to him for which he was entitled.
During the service tenure of the late employee, the A.C.P.
Rules of 2003, as referred to above, was implemented. The
benefits of the aforesaid rules were also not given to the late
employee who died, while in service, on 04.09.2009. It is
under such circumstances that the petitioner, who is the
widow of aforesaid late employee, made a prayer before the
respondents for giving to her late husband the benefits of
the 1st A.C.P. and the 2nd A.C.P. with effect from
09.08.1999
and 10.07.2005 respectively.
5. It appears that the claim of the petitioner was rejected by the respondents on the ground that the
late employee had not passed the departmental examination and, therefore, he had not been
accorded the benefits of the Assured Career Progression Scheme.
Patna High Court CWJC No.15647 of 2017 dt.14-02-2019
6. The aforesaid stand of the respondents is sought to be challenged by the petitioner on the ground
that grant of financial progression under the A.C.P. Rules of 2003 is not a vertical promotion on any
higher post, but only financial up-gradation and the requirement of passing departmental
examination would not be applicable to the case of the late husband of the petitioner for grant of
time bond promotion and A.C.P.
7. The learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that a Bench of this Court in the case of
Bishwanath Prasad Vs. The State of Bihar, reported in 2011(2) PLJR 136, has held that there is no
requirement of an employee to undergo any examination for confirmation of time bond promotion.
Even for grant of benefits of A.C.P., passing of departmental examination would not be necessary, as
has been held in the case of Avinash Chandra Singh Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors. , reported in
2012(1) PLJR 663.
8. The learned counsel appearing for the State, with reference to the counter affidavit, has opposed
Patna High Court CWJC No.15647 of 2017 dt.14-02-2019 the aforesaid contention of the petitioner
on the ground that the late employee would have only been given the benefits of 1st time bond
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/93531383/ 3
Masomat Indu Devi vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 14 February, 2019
promotion on his passing Departmental Accounts Examination, which has been made an essential
condition by a guideline issued by the Finance Department, Govt. of Bihar. Even for the late
employee being eligible for the benefits of A.C.P., he was required to pass the Departmental
Accounts Examination, which was not done. The aforesaid argument has been advanced on the
strength of sub-Clause (5) of Rule 4 of the A.C.P. Rules of 2003, which contemplates that any
employee claiming benefits of A.C.P. must fulfill all the requirements which are needed for
substantive promotion.
9. For the sake of convenience, sub-Clause (5) of Rule 4 of the A.C.P. Rules, 2003 is extracted
hereinbelow:-

10. The learned counsel for the State has also drawn the attention of this Court to the provisions
contained in Rules 156 and 157 of the Bihar Boards Miscellaneous Rules, 1958 and the Finance
Department Circular, bearing No. 4685 dated 25.06.2003, which requires an employee to pass the
Departmental Accounts Examination mandatorily, which is uniformly applicable to all clerical cadre
employees for any regular promotion as also for getting the benefits of A.C.P./M.A.C.P.
11. By way of a supplementary counter affidavit, the learned counsel for the State has also brought
on record the Field Accounts Clerk Cadre Rules, 2014 (in short the Cadre Rules of 2014) framed by
the Bihar Water Resources Department, Govt. of Bihar. The aforesaid Cadre Rules of 2014 defines
the Cadre as comprising Accounts Clerk working in the Department of Water Resources
Department, Govt. of Bihar. Rule 3 of the Cadre Rules of Patna High Court CWJC No.15647 of 2017
dt.14-02-2019 2014 provides for three-tiers in the Cadre of Clerks, viz., (A) Junior Accounts Clerk
(Basic Category); (B) Senior Accounts Clerk (First Promotion Level) and (C) Head Accountant
(Second Promotion Level). Rule 16 of the Cadre Rules of 2014 further indicates that promotions
against vacancies for Senior Accounts Clerk shall be given after the recommendation of the
Departmental Promotion Committee on the basis of passing of Departmental Accounts
Examination.
12. The learned counsel for the petitioner, however, has stated that the aforesaid Cadre Rules of
2014 have come in the year 2014, which would definitely not be applicable to the case of the late
employee of whom the petitioner is the widow.
13. In order to appreciate the contentions advanced on behalf of the parties, it would be necessary to
refer to the two decisions passed by two Division Benches of this Court, which, more often than not
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/93531383/ 4
Masomat Indu Devi vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 14 February, 2019
is cited as depicting two different viewpoints, leading to confusion with the Employer/State
regarding the implementation of the A.C.P. Patna High Court CWJC No.15647 of 2017
dt.14-02-2019 Rule of 2003.
14. The provision of sub-Clause (5) of Rule 4 of the A.C.P. Rules of 2003 was considered in both the
aforesaid decisions decided on 03.07.2017 in L.P.A. No. 1871 of 2016 in the case of Uday Shankar
Prasad Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors. [reported in 2017(3) PLJR 824] and in L.P.A. No. 332 of 2017,
decided on 04.05.2018, in the case of The State of Bihar & Ors. Vs. Mahendra Baitha. Apart from the
aforesaid two decisions, a reference of another decision by a Division Bench of this Court has been
made, viz., L.P.A. No. 599 of 2015, decided on 19.03.2018, in the case of Ramadhar Thakur Vs. The
State of Bihar & Ors. , wherein the provisions of the A.C.P. Rules of 2003 and the relevant rules of
the Bihar Boards Miscellaneous Rules, 1958 were also referred to and the respective scope has been
discussed.
15. In the case of Uday Shankar Prasad Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors. (supra), the petitioner, who was
a Compilation Clerk in the Road Construction Department, Govt. of Bihar, was granted the benefits
of the A.C.P. Rules Patna High Court CWJC No.15647 of 2017 dt.14-02-2019 of 2003, but later the
aforesaid benefits were sought to be withdrawn and the amount paid to him was directed to be
recovered giving rise to the litigation. The Division Bench of this Court in the aforesaid case, after
perusing the scheme, particularly sub-Clause (5) of Rule 4 thereof of the A.C.P. Rules of 2003 held
as follows:-
8. A perusal of the aforesaid rules clearly stipulates that the prescribed requirement
and mode of sanction of financial progression under the scheme shall be the same
which are prescribed under the Recruitment/Service Rule for regular promotion
against the vacancy. It is, therefore, clear that for getting benefit under the scheme in
question, an employee has to fulfill all the conditions stipulated in the Recruitment or
the Service Rules which is prescribed for regular promotion from the post held to the
next higher post. Admittedly, in the case in hand, for further promotion from the post
of Compilation clerk to a higher post, no Service Rules are prescribed as there is no
further avenue for promotion from post of Compilation clerk to any other higher
post.
That being so, sub rule 5 of Rule 4 and its interpretation would clearly show that for Patna High
Court CWJC No.15647 of 2017 dt.14-02-2019 grant of ACP from the post of Compilation Clerk no
rules of promotion or recruitment being prescribed, this rule will not apply, i.e. 4(5). Thus, there are
no prescribed statutory rules for recruitment or promotion from the post of compilation clerk to any
other post. That apart, we find that the rules of 2003 are the rules framed under Article 309 of the
Constitution of India and there is no stipulation in these rules that the rules contemplated under the
Bihar Board Miscellaneous Rules, 1958 would be applicable for grant of ACP. That being the
position, the contention of the respondents that the appellant is not entitled to the benefit under the
scheme, is wholly misconceived and while rejecting the claim of the appellant the learned Writ Court
has not taken note of this factual or legal aspect of the matter. On going through the judgment
referred to by the State in the case of Kusheshwar Nath Pandey (supra), we find that it was a case
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/93531383/ 5
Masomat Indu Devi vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 14 February, 2019
pertaining to grant of time bound promotion under a particular scheme and the said case was
pertaining to promotion of a Tracer to some higher post and is not applicable to this appellant.
9. A perusal of the Rule, which is reproduced in para 10 of the judgment in the Patna High Court
CWJC No.15647 of 2017 dt.14-02-2019 case of Kusheswar Nath Pandey (supra), goes to show that
the rule is applicable for the purpose of crossing the efficiency bar, confirmation and for promotion
to the selection grade. There is nothing in the said rule to show that it pertains to promotion of
Compilation Clerk to any other higher post. Rules of 2003 is the rule framed under Article 309 of
the constitution and the aims and objects of the scheme is to grant higher pay scale or grade to the
employees who stagnate in particular post without any promotion, may be because no promotional
posts are available or vacancies are not available and the scheme has been envisaged to grant only
benefit of higher pay scale or grade to an employee who stagnates for 12 years or 24 years. Once we
are convinced that there are no rules for promotion from the post of Compilation Clerk and the
Boards Miscellaneous Rules of 1958 are not applicable, in the case in hand, there is no reason why
the benefit claimed by the appellant cannot be granted. That being the position, the benefit of ACP
was rightly granted to the appellant and there was no justification in withdrawing the same.
(emphasis supplied)
16. What the aforesaid judgment clearly lays Patna High Court CWJC No.15647 of 2017
dt.14-02-2019 down is that the A.C.P. Rules of 2003 has been framed under Article 309 of the
Constitution of India and the said rules clearly prescribe that financial progression shall be given to
a person who is otherwise fit for promotion. The requirement of passing any Departmental or
Accounts Examination for being eligible for promotion or payment of A.C.P. occurs only when there
are statutory/departmental/service rules prescribed for passing any examination for promotion to
the higher post. The judgment further takes note of the fact that the provisions of the Bihar Boards
Miscellaneous Rules, 1958 are only applicable for the purposes of crossing the efficiency bar,
confirmation and for promotion to the selection grade. If there are no rules for promotion, the Bihar
Boards Miscellaneous Rules, 1958 would not be applicable to the case of an employee and in the
present case, to the late employee.
17. In the case of Ramadhar Thakur Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors. (supra), the provisions of Rule
157(3) (J) of the Bihar Boards Miscellaneous Rules, 1958 and sub- Patna High Court CWJC
No.15647 of 2017 dt.14-02-2019 Clause (5) of Rule 4 of the A.C.P. Rules of 2003 were analyzed and
discussed. It was conclusively held by the Bench, after referring to the various judgments, viz.,
Mithilesh Kumar Sinha Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors. [2006(1) PLJR 282]; Syed Mozammil Ashraf
Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors. [2007(1) PLJR 438]; Shashi Shekhar Ambasta Vs. The State of Bihar &
Ors. [2011(3) PLJR 474]; Maheshwar Prasad Singh & Ors. Vs. The State of Bihar [2000(4) PLJR
262]; Rameshwar Roy Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors. [2017(2) PLJR 127]; Daya Shankar Singh Vs.
The State of Bihar & Ors. [2010(3) PLJR 220] and Md. Shamsuddin & Ors. Vs. The State of Bihar
[1983 PLJR 347] , that Rule 157(3)(J) of the Bihar Boards Miscellaneous Rules, 1958 makes the
passing of the Departmental Accounts Examination a condition precedent for promotion to the
selection grade, but not for general promotion and for not passing such exam, the benefits of the
A.C.P. Rules of 2003 also cannot be withheld, unless there is a Departmental Rule for promotion. In
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/93531383/ 6
Masomat Indu Devi vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 14 February, 2019
other words, the Bench held that passing of Departmental Accounts Examination is not a condition
Patna High Court CWJC No.15647 of 2017 dt.14-02-2019 precedent for grant of Assured Career
Progression under the A.C.P. Rules nor does Rule 157(3)(J) of the Bihar Boards Miscellaneous
Rules, 1958 conceive of such a requirement.
18. In the case of The State of Bihar & Ors. Vs. Mahendra Baitha (supra), the issues were almost
similar. The petitioner therein was not given the benefit of the financial progression scheme on the
ground that he had never passed the Departmental Examination. After taking note the judgment
delivered in the case of Uday Shankar Prasad Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors. (supra) and holding that
the sum-essence of the A.C.P. Rules of 2003 was anti- stagnation measure, but in accordance with
sub-Clause (5) of Rule 4 thereof, the benefits would only accrue if an employee fulfills all the
requirements which are needed for substantive promotion which includes passing of certain
Departmental Examinations etc.
19. While coming to operative portion of the judgment in the case of The State of Bihar & Ors. Vs.
Mahendra Baitha (supra), the Bench declared as follows in paragraph 11 of its decision:-
Patna High Court CWJC No.15647 of 2017 dt.14-02-2019
11. This Court does not want to burden this order by relying on one too many
decisions on the principle and requirements in relation to grant of benefit of A.C.P.
Let it be clarified that if a claim is made by any employee as to his entitlement under
the A.C.P. Rules, such claim will have to be considered in the entirety of the scheme
of the Rule and not on the mere object behind the Rules. Since the conditions laid
down in sub-
rule (5) of rule 4 of the 2003 A.C.P. rules are integral to the Rules, which has been notified under
Article 309 of the Constitution of India, therefore, the Rule cannot be truncated and directions
cannot be issued for grant of benefit of A.C.P., merely because of passage of time, ignoring what is
otherwise a must, in terms of fulfilling the eligibility.
20. A bare reading of the three judgments, referred to above, makes the following propositions
absolutely clear, leaving no scope of any confusion, unless the judgments are viewed and analyzed
with a myopic vision. The common thread running in all the three judgments, referred to above, is
as follows:-
(A) The A.C.P. Rules of 2003 do not provide an avenue of promotion, but only Patna
High Court CWJC No.15647 of 2017 dt.14-02-2019 financial progression in case of no
promotion having been given to an employee;
(B) The recipient/beneficiary of such scheme has to be an employee who is otherwise
eligible for being promoted to the higher post;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/93531383/ 7
Masomat Indu Devi vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 14 February, 2019
(C) Passing of Accounts Examination or Departmental Examination, as the case may
be, under the Bihar Boards Miscellaneous Rules, 1958 would be necessary for
crossing efficiency bar, confirmation and for promotion to selection grade, but not
general promotion;
(D) The requirement of passing the exam can only be thrust upon and made
applicable to an employee in view of the Service Rules of the Department.
21. A further condition can be gleaned from the aforesaid judgments for being eligible for getting the
benefits of financial progression under the A.C.P. Rules of 2003, which is that, if there are no
promotional avenues available in the Cadre.
22. Applying the aforesaid principles in the case of the late employee, it can safely be stated that he
Patna High Court CWJC No.15647 of 2017 dt.14-02-2019 was absorbed and regularized in
government service on 09.07.1981 on the post of Accounts Clerk in the Irrigation Department on
which, he joined on 10.07.1981 at a pay- scale of Rs. 730-1080. Admittedly, he has not been paid the
1st time bond promotion and the benefits of A.C.P. Rules of 2003. The late employee died in harness
on 04.09.2009, while was posted as Accounts Clerk. The Departmental Rules, framed only in the
year 2014, has provided for 3-tier in the Cadre of Accounts Clerk and the requirement of passing the
Departmental Accounts Examination and attaining computer knowledge for confirmation and
promotion. The petitioner died much before the aforesaid rules came into effect.
23. Under such circumstances, in the considered opinion of this Court, the respondents are not
justified in withholding the benefits of 1 st time bond promotion and financial progression under the
A.C.P. Rules of 2003 to the late husband (employee) of the petitioner.
24. Under the aforesaid circumstances, the petitioner is directed to make a representation before the
Patna High Court CWJC No.15647 of 2017 dt.14-02-2019 Principal Secretary, Water Resources
Department, Govt. of Bihar, Patna (respondent No. 2) within a period of four weeks from the date of
receipt/production of a copy of this order. On receipt of such representation, the Principal Secretary,
Water Resources Department, Govt. of Bihar, Patna (respondent No. 2) shall dispose off such
representation within a period of eight weeks thereafter, taking into account the position of law as
has been discussed in the present order. If the dues of the late husband (employee) of the petitioner
is found to be tenable, necessary sequel orders shall be or directed to be passed within the aforesaid
stipulated period.
25. With the aforesaid observation and direction, the writ petition stands disposed off.
