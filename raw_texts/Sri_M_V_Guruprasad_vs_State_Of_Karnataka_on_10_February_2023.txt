THIS WRIT PETITION IS FILED UNDER ARTICLE 226 OF
THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA, PRAYING TO QUASH THE
NOTIFICATION DATED 09.01.2007 PUBLISHED IN THE
KARNATAKA GAZETTE ON 10.01.2007 R/W THE CORRIGENDUM

ARE CONCERNED.
THIS PETITION HAVING BEEN HEARD AND RESERVED
FOR ORDER, THIS DAY, THE COURT PRONOUNCED THE
FOLLOWING:
ORDER
The tone for this judgment can be set by adverting to the words of Saint Augustine (354 - 430 A.D.)
in his book, The City of God, Volume 1 (426 A.D):
"Without justice, what else is the State but a great band of robbers ...?"
2. Petitioners being the owners of lands in question are knocking at the doors of Writ Court grieving
against their acquisition vide Preliminary Notification dated 09.01.2007 issued under Section 28(1)
followed by the Final Notification dated 17.05.2007 issued under Section 28(4) of the Karnataka
Industrial Areas Development Act, 1966.
3. Learned counsel for the Petitioners seeks voiding of the acquisition on the following grounds that:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/69746599/ 2
Sri M V Guruprasad vs State Of Karnataka on 10 February, 2023
(i) His clients were already owners of the subject lands and therefore, their names
ought to have figured in the acquisition notifications;
(ii) Petitioners vide Letter dated 09.01.2013 had requested the KIADB to pass the
award and pay compensation; there has been a stony silence; payment of
compensation is a precondition for sustaining acquisition;
(iii) Alternatively, the compensation should be paid to his clients under the Right to
Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation, and
Resettlement Act 2013 (hereafter 2013 Act), especially when the KIADB has allotted
the subject lands by charging a huge sum of Rs.7.5 Crore or so, that too after giving a
rebate of 50% to the allotees;
(v) There is enormous delay unjustifiably brooked in making the payment of
compensation, that militates against the spirit of Article 300A of the Constitution
which guarantees right to property; till date no payment is made and nothing is
stated about the same in the Statement of Objections filed by the KIADB.
4. After service of notice, the State has entered appearance through the learned AGA and the KIADB
is represented by its Sr. Panel Counsel who has filed the Statement of Objections opposing the
acquisition. Learned Panel Counsel contends that the acquisition having been completed by
issuance of Final Notification on 17.05.2007, the lands have vested in the State and therefore, the
same cannot be restored to the Petitioners. After the land owners notified the change of khatha
pursuant to subject Sale Deeds, the Government has issued Corrigendum Notification on
05.06.2014 mentioning their names and because of the protocol process, there is some delay and
now the payment of compensation will be made. So contending, they seek dismissal of Writ Petition.
5. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and having perused the Petition papers, although
this Court rejects challenge to acquisition of lands, it is inclined to grant indulgence in so far as non
payment of compensation, following being the reasons:
(a) The 1st Petitioner bought 05 Acres & 01 Gunta of land in Sy.No.132 of Jonnahalli
in Devanahalli Taluka by three registered Sale Deeds all dated 27.01.2007 and his
name is mutated in the Revenue Records vide M.R. Nos.48, 49 & 50 of 2006-07
dated 22.03.2007. The 2nd Petitioner bought only 38 Guntas of land in Sy.No.66/6
of the same village vide two Sale Deeds both dated 23.12.2006 and his name came to
be mutated in the Revenue Records vide M.R.No.43/2006-07 dated 14.04.2007 &
M.R.No.60/2006-07 dated 21.04.2007.
Thus, as on the date of Preliminary Notification i.e., 09.01.2007, names of the Petitioners had not
figured as khatedars in the Revenue Records and therefore, the KIADB was justified in notifying the
acquisition in the names of their vendors then, who were the Khatedars.

(b) The vendors had not filed Objections to the acquisition since they had lost ownership over the
lands, by virtue of registered sale deeds, is true. However, Petitioners along with other land owners
had filed their Objections on 15.02.2007 vide Annexure - Q1, pursuant to the Notice dated
11.01.2007 issued by the SLAO himself under Section 28(2) of the 1966 Act. They had informed the
KIADB about the land being adjacent to the village and also close to flying zone of International
Airport at Devanahalli. No records are shown by the answering Respondents as to due and objective
consideration of their Objections. Be that as it may.
(c) Petitioners by their Representation dated 09.01.2013 had requested the KIADB at least to pay
the compensation for having taken their lands; a copy of this is produced by the KIADB itself as
Annexure-R1 to its Statement of Objections. They had also sent the reminder dated 01.07.2014 &
03.07.2014. In fact, the Government issued a Corrigendum Notification dated 05.06.2014
mentioning their names and thereby entitling them to payment of compensation. However,
compensation has not been paid even to this day. There is no plausible explanation as to why the
payment of compensation is withheld for decade and a half. It hardly needs to be stated that
payment of compensation is essential when private property is acquired for public purpose; this
mandate is 'in-built' in Article 300A vide K.T PLANTATION vs. STATE OF KARNATAKA (2011) 9
SCC 1. The following observations in STATE OF BIHAR vs. MAHARAJADHIRAJA SIR
KAMESHWAR SINGH (1952) SCR 889 succinctly elucidate upon the jurisprudential basis for
payment of compensation as a sine qua non for the acquisition as under:
"...obligation to pay compensation for the property so compulsorily acquired, is not
an essential ingredient of the connotation of the term, eminent domain, but is an
essential element for the valid exercise of that power payment. The obligation to pay
compensation arises from the natural right of the individual who is deprived of his
property by such acquisition as against the power of the Sovereign to take the
property in exercise of its Sovereignty..."
In his 1792 essay on Property, published in the National Gazette, Madison, Chief Architect of the 5th
Amendment, i.e., 'takings clause' of the U.S. Constitution, wrote:
"Government is instituted to protect property of every sort; as well that which lies in
the various rights of individuals, as that which the term particularly expresses. This
being the end of government, that alone is a just government, which impartially
secures to every man, whatever is his own."
(d) Petitioners property has vested in the State vide Final Notification dated 17.05.2007.The
Government issued the Corrigendum notification dated 05.06.2014. They have filed the Writ
Petition on 28.11.2016 and a Coordinate Bench directed issuance of notice on 16.01.2017. At least,
after service of notice, the Respondent - KIADB ought to have woken up and arranged for payment
of the payment of compensation. However, strangely it has filed its Statement of Objections dated
09.04.2021 seeking dismissal of the Writ Petition contending that they have already developed the
land and allotted the same to several entrepreneurs, the Allotment Letters dated 09.05.2019,
18.05.2019 & 10.06.2019 have also been produced. Except saying that there are rival claimants for
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/69746599/ 4
Sri M V Guruprasad vs State Of Karnataka on 10 February, 2023
compensation, there is absolutely no justification whatsoever for withholding the payment even
when the Corrigendum Notification dated 05.06.2014 itself mentioned the names of Petitioners and
not the Objectors. The lands of the Petitioners have been allotted to the entrepreneurs at a price of
Rs.2.5 Crore per acre, that too after giving a rebate of 50% of the Market Value. This Court is
bewildered as to how the compensation lawfully payable has been withheld when it was obviously
due for payment to the Petitioners.
(e) The government cannot act as a robber of citizens lands; taking away private lands for the
purported public purpose sans compensation militates against the spirit of constitutional guarantee
enacted u/a 300A, the fundamental right to property no longer being on the statute book,
notwithstanding. It hardly needs to be stated that the State and its instrumentalities are
constitutionally expected to conduct themselves with fairness & reasonableness in all their actions
vide RAMANA DAYARAM SHETTY vs. INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT AUTHOITY AIR 1979 SC
1628. The conduct of
- 10 -
the Respondent - KIADB and its officials who answer the description of 'State' under Article 12 of
the Constitution falls militantly short of the fairness standards expected of them.
(f) Lands of the Petitioners have been taken by acquisition process way back in the year 2007, is not
in dispute; with Herculean task, the Petitioners got their names entered by virtue of Corrigendum
Notification dated 5.6.2014. Preceding this & post this, several representations were given for
payment of compensation. The sites formed in Petitioners lands on allotment have fetched Rs.7.5
Crore to the KIADB, that too, with the rebate of 50% of the market value; otherwise, it would been
Rs.15 Crore, as already mentioned above. If there was a rival claim, compensation amount could
have been parked in some interest earning deposits, relegating the parties to litigate. In the entire
Statement of Objections, neither the State nor the KIADB has said anything about the compensation
being payable to the Petitioners. The
- 11 -
KIADB and its officials being what they are, this did not happen; such a conduct reinforces the
shackles of a feudalistic attitude from which the transformative character of our constitution seeks
to liberate. Their action in not paying the compensation is not only grossly violative of property
rights constitutionally guaranteed under Article 300A but gnaws at overarching objectives of a
Welfare State ordained under the Constitution.
(g) The Apex Court in RADHEY SHYAM vs. STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH, (2011) 5 SCC 545 has
observed as under:
"...while examining the land owner's challenge to the acquisition of land in a petition
filed under Article 226 of the Constitution, the High Court should not adopt a
pedantic approach, but decide the matter keeping in view the constitutional goals of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/69746599/ 5
Sri M V Guruprasad vs State Of Karnataka on 10 February, 2023
social and economic justice and the fact that even though the right to property is no
longer a fundamental right, the same continues to be an important constitutional
right and in terms of Article 300-A, no person can be deprived of his property except
by authority of law..."
This Court cannot deny justice that is eminently due to the aggrieved citizens by quoting some
constitutional theories.
- 12 -
Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes in DAVIS vs. MILLS, 194 U.S. 451 (1904) had observed:
"Constitutions are intended to preserve practical and substantial rights, not to maintain theories ...".
(h) There is force in the submission of learned counsel for the Petitioners that the compensation
should be fixed on the principles broadly enacted in 2013 Act, because of the enormity of delay &
callousness of the Respondents in unjustifiably withholding the payment of compensation for about
a decade & a half despite receiving about Rs.7.5 Crore from the allottees of the sites with a rebate of
50% Market Value; otherwise, arithmetically speaking, it would have been Rs.15 Crore. He banks
upon a Coordinate Bench decision in W.P.Nos. 108802/2016 c/w 107748/2014, 100762/2017
between SHEENAPPA vs. STATE OF KARNATAKA disposed off on 18.07.2022 directing payment
of compensation under the 2013 Act. However, it is told at the Bar that this decision has been stayed
by a Division Bench in W.A. No.100393/2022. Be
- 13 -
that as it may. Justice of the case warrants that the Petitioners be paid at least 50% of the
compensation to be computed under the provisions of 2013 Act, along with solatium, interest & such
other things. This Court hastens to add that, in special circumstances of the case and because of the
stay of Coordinate Bench decision, the provisions of the 2013 Act are taken only for the purpose of
determining/re-fixing the compensation amount on a normative basis till after & subject to decision
in the Writ Appeal. It hardly needs to be stated that the Writ Courts being the custodians of
Constitutional Rights of the citizens, have to individualize justice taking into account the facts &
circumstances of the case at hands.
In the above circumstances, this Court makes the following directions:
(i) This Writ Petition succeeds in part. Although challenge to the acquisition of the
subject lands is negatived, a Writ of Mandamus issues to the Respondent Nos. 2 to 4
to determine/re-fix the compensation at the rate of 50% to be computed under the
provisions of Section 77 of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land
- 14 -

Sri M V Guruprasad vs State Of Karnataka on 10 February, 2023
Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 along with solatium, interest & such other
benefits.
(ii) The Respondent Nos.2 to 4 are directed to pay to the Petitioners within eight weeks the amount
of compensation to be determined as per the direction issued in the immediately preceding
paragraph (i) with additional interest at the rate of 12% per annum to be computed from the date,
the possession of subject lands was taken away from the Petitioners; and
(iii) In the event, the Writ Appeal No.100393/2022 is dismissed, upholding the judgment of the
Coordinate Bench in W.P.Nos.108802/2016 c/w 107748/2014, 100762/2017 between SHEENAPPA
vs. STATE OF KARNATAKA disposed off on 18.07.2022, Petitioners shall be paid the compensation
to be determined under the provisions of 2013 Act minus what is paid in terms of the above
directions.
(iv) The Respondent-KIADB shall pay to the Petitioners, the cost to be computed at the rate of
Rs.25,000/- per Acre.
Time for compliance of all the above directions is three months. Should delay be brooked,
Petitioners shall be paid an additional interest at the rate of 2% per mensum which may be
recovered from the erring officials of the State/KIADB, in accordance with law.
- 15 -
This Court places on record its deep appreciation for the able research & assistance rendered by its
official Law Clerk cum Research Assistant, Mr.Faiz Afsar Sait.
Before parting with this case, this Court expresses its deep anguish against the culpable action of
Respondent- KIADB & its officials in putting the petitioner-land-losers to a great hardship & misery.
