Yog Narayan Yadav vs The State Of Bihar on 7 October, 2025
under Sections 498(A)/504 of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 3, 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act.
3. The allegation is of subjecting the daughter of the opposite party no.2 to various sorts of torture
due to non- fulfillment of the demand of the dowry.
4. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners submitted that the entire family members
of the husband of the victim (daughter of opposite party no.2 ) have been made accused. He further
submitted that after investigation, the police, having found no evidence against the present
petitioners, who are family members of the daughter of the opposite party no. 2, who got married
with one Shyam Narayan Yadav, have submitted charge-sheet only against the son-in-law of the
opposite party no. 2 and exonerated the petitioners from the charges levelled against them. In
support of his submission, learned counsel has relied upon a recent judgment passed by the Apex
Court in the case of Mange Ram Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh & Another (Special Leave Petition
(Criminal) No.10817 of 2024). He further submitted Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.33031 of 2019
dt.07-10-2025 that learned Magistrate after deferring with the police report took cognizance against
the petitioners under Sections 498(A)/504 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 3/4 of the Dowry
Prohibition Act and seeks quashing of the entire proceeding pending against the petitioners.
5. Per contra, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the opposite party no. 2 submitted that no
interference can be made by this Court in view of the cognizable offence made against the
petitioners, who have subjected the daughter of the opposite party no. 2 to cruelty of various sorts
for non fulfillment of demand of dowry and had also kicked her out from her matrimonial house.
Learned counsel further submitted that the husband of the petitioner has restrained himself because
of illegal act committed by the petitioners by interfering in the matrimonial relationship between the
daughter of the informant leading to lodging of the FIR in connection with Babubarhi P.S. Case No.
73 of 2017. He submitted that in view of the fact that prima facie case is made out against the
petitioners, the present quashing application is fit to be dismissed.
6. Heard the parties.
7. Having considered the rival submissions made on behalf of the parties, as well as, the fact that
aggrieved by the Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.33031 of 2019 dt.07-10-2025 criminal act of the
petitioners, the father of the victim has lodged a criminal case against the petitioners including his
son- in-law, who is not the petitioner in the present case. However, no information regarding
relationship of the petitioners with the son-in-law of the opposite party no. 2 has been given in the
present application.
8. I find that the present is one of the cases, in which, petitioners being the family members have
been dragged to face the present criminal prosecution. Recently, the Hon'ble Supreme Court, in the
case of Mange Ram (supra) has found it to be vexatious in nature and has pleased to quash the
entire proceeding. I find it appropriate to reproduce the paragraphs no. 25, 31 and 32, which, inter
alia are as follows:

Yog Narayan Yadav vs The State Of Bihar on 7 October, 2025
"25. This Court, in Dara Lakshmi Narayana vs. State of Telangana, (2025) 3 SCC 735,
has made it clear that family members of the husband ought not to be unnecessarily
roped into criminal proceedings arising out of matrimonial discord. The Court
observed that it has become a recurring tendency to implicate every member of the
husband's family, irrespective of their role or actual involvement, merely because a
dispute has arisen between the spouses. It was further held that where the allegations
are bereft of specific particulars, and particularly where the relatives sought to be
prosecuted are residing separately or have had no connection with the matrimonial
home, allowing the prosecution to proceed would amount to an abuse of the process
of law. The Court noted that criminal law is not to be deployed as an instrument of
harassment, and that judicial scrutiny must be exercised to guard against such
misuse.
31. We also refer to Gian Singh vs. State of Punjab, (2012) 10 SCC 303 wherein this
Court observed that where the High Court quashes a criminal proceeding having
regard to the fact that the dispute between the offender and the victim has been
settled, although the Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.33031 of 2019 dt.07-10-2025
offences are not compoundable, it does so as in its opinion, continuation of criminal
proceedings will be an exercise in futility and justice in the case demands that the
dispute between the parties is put to an end and peace is restored, securing the ends
of justice being the ultimate guiding factor. In this regard, a specific reference was
made to offences arising out of matrimony, particularly relating to dowry, etc. or a
family dispute, where the wrong is basically to the victim but the offender and the
victim have settled all disputes between them amicably, irrespective of the fact that
such offences have not been made compoundable. The High Court may, within the
framework of its inherent power, quash the criminal proceeding or criminal
complaint or FIR if it is satisfied that on the face of such settlement, there is hardly
any likelihood of the offender being convicted and by not quashing the criminal
proceedings, justice shall be casualty and ends of justice shall be defeated.
32. In Naushey Ali vs. State of U.P., (2025) 4 SCC 78, one of us (Viswanathan, J.)
observed in paragraph 32 that proceeding with the trial, when the parties have
amicably resolved the dispute, would be futile and the ends of justice require that the
settlement be given effect to by quashing the proceedings. It would be a grave abuse
of process particularly when the dispute is settled and resolved."
9. The facts of the present case is also not different as also in view of the oral information given by
the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner, on instruction of his client that the
daughter of the opposite party no. 2 has already solemnized marriage with another gentleman. That
being the case, I find that the petitioners are facing prosecution in absence of any evidence and
continuation of proceeding would amount to abuse of process of law leading to vexatious proceeding
against the petitioners. Accordingly, the order taking cognizance dated 08.01.2018 and the entire
criminal proceeding are hereby set-aside and quashed to the extent it relates to the Patna High
Court CR. MISC. No.33031 of 2019 dt.07-10-2025 petitioners.
