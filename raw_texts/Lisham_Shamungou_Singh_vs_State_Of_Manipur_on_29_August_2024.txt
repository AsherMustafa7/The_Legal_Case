[3] Vide order dated 31.08.31.08.2-13 issued by the Under Secretary, (GAD), Government of

three years. Vide order dated 31.08.2020, service of the petitioner was terminated on
superannuation w.e.f. 31.08.2020. Petitioner is aggrieved by the third condition in the impugned
termination order dated 10.12.2021 stating that payment of retirement benefits will be considered
only after the conclusion of High Powered Committee. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits
that there is no proceeding of the High Powered Committee and this condition is illegal.
On the other hand, Ms.Emily, learned Dy. Government Advocate submits that name of the
petitioner has not been cleared by the High Powered Committee as well as in the Vigilance case and
as such, he is not entitled to receive normal pension in terms of Rule 69 of the CCS (Pension) Rules.
[4] Mr.Athoi, learned counsel for the petitioner draws attention of this Court to the provisions of
Rule 9 of the CCS (Pension) Rules, which contemplates that pensionary benefit of a retired
Government employee cannot be withheld unless he is found guilty in a Judicial or Departmental
proceedings. Learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that petitioner has not been found
guilty in a Departmental or Judicial Proceedings and as such, State Government cannot withhold
pensionary benefits of the petitioner.

and relevant provisions of law. Admittedly, petitioner was kept under suspension for his
involvement in an FIR case and suspension order was later on revoked. Further, there is no

violation of provisions of Rule 9 of the CCS (Pension) Rules. No material is placed before this Court
as to the status of the High Powered Committee, within the ambit of Rule 9 CCS (Pension) Rules.
For ready reference, impugned order dated 10.12.2021 is reproduced below:
