11. The issue that was considered by this Court in Jagjit Singh [State of Punjab v.
Jagjit Singh, (2017) 1 SCC 148 : (2017) 1 SCC (L&S) 1] is whether temporary
employees (daily-wage employees, ad hoc appointees, employees appointed on casual
basis, contractual employees and likewise) are entitled to the minimum of the regular
pay scales on account of their performing the same duties which are discharged by
those engaged on regular basis against the sanctioned posts. After considering several
judgments including the judgments of this Court in Tilak Raj [State of Haryana v.
Tilak Raj, (2003) 6 SCC 123 : 2003 SCC (L&S) 828] and Surjit Singh [State of Punjab
v. Surjit Singh, (2009) 9 SCC 514 : (2009) 2 SCC (L&S) 696] , this Court held that
temporary employees are entitled to draw wages at the minimum of the pay scales
which are applicable to the regular employees holding the same post.
12 [Ed.: Para 12 corrected vide Official Corrigendum No. F.3/Ed.B.J./111/2018 dated
4-7-2019.] . In view of the judgment in Jagjit Singh [State of Punjab v. Jagjit Singh,
(2017) 1 SCC 148 : (2017) 1 SCC (L&S) 1] , we are unable to uphold the view of the
High Court that the appellants herein are not entitled to be paid the minimum of the
pay scales. We are not called upon to adjudicate on the rights of the appellants
relating to the regularisation of their services. We are concerned only with the
principle laid down by this Court initially in Putti Lal [State of U.P. v. Putti Lal,
(2006) 9 SCC 337 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 1819] relating to persons who are similarly
situated to the appellants and later affirmed in Jagjit Singh [State of Punjab v. Jagjit
Singh, (2017) 1 SCC 148 : (2017) 1 SCC (L&S) 1] that temporary employees are
entitled to minimum of the pay scales as long as they continue in service.
13. .....
14. For the aforementioned reasons, we allow these appeals and set aside the
judgments of the High Court holding that the appellants are entitled to be paid the
minimum of the pay scales applicable to regular employees working on the same
posts. The State of Uttar Pradesh is directed to make payment of the minimum of pay
scales to the appellants with effect from 1-12-2018."
Notice on behalf of all the respondents is accepted by Mr. Jitendra Prasad, learned Standing
Counsel. He is granted three weeks' time to file a counter affidavit.
To be taken up in the additional cause list for admission, along with a report regarding status of
pleadings.
An interim mandamus is issued to the Principal Secretary, Forest Department, Government of U.P.,
Lucknow and the Divisional Forest Officer, Firozabad Forest Division, Firozabad to ensure amongst
themselves payment of minimum pay-scale to the petitioner in accordance with the Seventh Pay
Commission, that is to say, Rs. 18,000 or show cause by filing counter affidavits, why this interim
mandamus be not made absolute.
