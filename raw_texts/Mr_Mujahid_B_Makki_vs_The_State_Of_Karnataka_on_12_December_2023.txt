COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:
12
ORDER
This writ petition is filed seeking following reliefs;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/28418575/ 9
Mr. Mujahid B Makki vs The State Of Karnataka on 12 December, 2023
(a) quash of orders produced at Annexures-V to V11 all dated 07.11.2019 passed by the Special Land
Acquisition Officer-respondent No.5 in declining the claim of the respondents without referring the
matter for adjudication.
(b) setting aside the compensation award and package fixed by Metro Rail Corporation as per
Annexures-AA to AA11;
(c) direction to the respondent Nos.5 and 6 to pass fresh award as per Section 30 of the Karnataka
Industrial Areas Development Act, 1966 (for short 'KIAD Act') in respect of land in Sy.No.30/3 of
Naagavara village as per final notification issued under Section 28(4) of the KIAD Act as per
Annexure-J
(d) direction to respondent Nos.12 and 13 to conduct enquiry by filing FIR on the complaint filed by
the petitioners as per Annexure-AC;
(e) direction to the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board (for short KIADB) and the
Secretary of the Revenue Department to conduct disciplinary enquiry against the respondent Nos. 9
and 10 for fraud and abuse of power, collusion, corrupt practice, conspiracy committed by them.
2. Facts of the case leading to filing of this petition briefly stated are;
(a)That one Mohammed Ishaq was the original kathedar of land bearing Sy.No.30/3 totally
measuring 3 acres 10 guntas situated at Nagavara village, Bangalore North Taluk, which was subject
matter of an acquisition by the Bangalore Development Authority during the year 1977. That an
award had been passed on 18.02.1988 as per Annexure-C in respect of 2 acres 30 guntas out of said
3 acres 10 guntas of land and an extent of 20 guntas of land had been excluded as the same
consisted of buildings. That in all these proceedings said Late Mohammed Ishaq has been referred
to as the Kathedar.
(b) that the petitioners are the decedents of said Late Mohammed Ishaq. That a suit in
O.S.No.5220/1992 was filed for partition of the aforesaid property, and the said suit was dismissed
solely on the ground that the land had been acquired by BDA and was not available for partition.
Aggrieved by the same a regular first appeal in RFA No.670/2005 was filed before this Court which
was partly allowed modifying the judgment and decree passed in O.S.No.5220/1992, in terms of
which petitioners were held to be entitled to 3/4th share in the suit properties and remitted the
matter for fresh consideration on the findings recorded by the trial court. That after the remand of
matter the parties entered into a compromise and a compromise decree was passed in the said suit
on 28.02.2020.
(c) That during the pendency of the above suit, KIADB had issued a preliminary notification dated
29.08.2018 followed by a final notification dated 17.01.2019 seeking to acquire the aforesaid land in
Sy.No.30/3 for Metro Rail Corporation. That immediately on learning about the same, petitioners
and other legal heirs of Mohammed Ishaq approached the authorities and submitted
representations along with relevant records to consider them as the owners, kathedars for the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/28418575/ 10
Mr. Mujahid B Makki vs The State Of Karnataka on 12 December, 2023
purpose of acquisition proceedings and benefits thereof.
(d) The petitioners also approached this Court by filing a W.P.Nos.7797-98/2019 seeking direction
to the respondent-authorities to consider their objection statements while disbursing compensation
amount.
(e) That without considering the representations and claim made by the petitioners and without
even considering the orders passed in the RFA No.670/2005, the pendency of suit in O.S.No.
5220/1992 and the order passed in W.P.No.7797-98/2019 and without even the consent of the
petitioners, the respondent-authorities mentioning the names of certain strangers as kathedars of
various pieces of land carved out in land in Sy.No.30/3 arbitrarily forwarded the alleged consent
award for disbursal of the compensation.
(f) That in the circumstances the respondent- authorities ought to have referred the matter to the
Civil Court for adjudication of right, title and interest of persons claiming various pieces of land as
mentioned in the acquisition notification and instead without even affording sufficient opportunity,
in collusion and on the basis of concocted documents passed the impugned orders on 07.11.2019
and disbursed the compensation on 08.11.2019.
(g) That the petitioners and their representatives approached KIADB seeking relevant records
pertaining to aforesaid acquisition proceedings. Taking advantage of Covid-19 pandemic the
respondent-authorities mislead the petitioners and did not disclose about passing of the impugned
order or disbursement of the amount, constraining the petitioners to approach this Court.
(h) That in furtherance to conspiracy between the officers of KIADB and the middlemen, stamp
papers were purchased in the month of July and August, 2019 i.e., even before determination of
compensation. Documents were fabricated in anticipation of the award amount. Thus, there is
fraud, collusion, conspiracy and misuse of power vitiating the entire process of acquisition of
property. Hence the writ petition.
3. Statement of objections has been filed by respondents 5, 6 and 11 contending inter alia that:
(a) properties notified included sites of various dimensions mentioned at Sl.Nos.131
to 162 carved out of Sy.No.30/3 of Nagavara Village within the boundaries specified
in the notification. That admittedly the said property measured 3 acres 10 guntas out
of which 2 acres 30 guntas had already been acquired by BDA and the notification
was only in respect of 20 guntas.
(b) Referring to the details of the names of the persons notified and the other particulars of the land
it is contended that notification for acquisition of land was issued on the basis of entries made in the
revenue records of the BBMP. That since names of none of the petitioners are found in the relevant
revenue records, names of the private respondents 14 to 50 were notified as Khathedars and
Anubhavadars based on their names in the revenue records. That the petitioners have not produced
any records showing their names having been entered in the revenue records even in the writ
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/28418575/ 11
Mr. Mujahid B Makki vs The State Of Karnataka on 12 December, 2023
petition.
(c) That on issuance of final notification under Section 28(4) of the Act the land stood vested with
the State free from all encumbrances in terms of Section 28(5) of the Act.
(d) That though by order dated 04.09.2012 passed in RFA No.670/2005 this Court had remitted the
matter for consideration afresh on the additional issue Nos.1 and 7, the parties to the suit did not
pursue the proceedings before the Civil Court, as such there has been no decision on their rights. All
of a sudden in the month of February, 2020 parties have filed a compromise memo and have
obtained a compromise decree on 28.02.2020. Though the said compromise decree refers to sharing
pattern, it does not refer to the particulars of the properties to which it relates. No description of the
properties are given in the schedule to the compromise. However, there are two schedules given in
the compromise. Schedule A relates to entire extent of 3 acres 10 guntas while Schedule B relates to
20 guntas in Sy.No.30/3. KIADB and BMRCL were not parties to the suit. By the time the
compromise was arrived at the acquisition proceedings had attained finality.
(e) That the KIAD Act being a special enactment provides for settlement of compensation by
agreement. In the instant case compensation package was sent on 22.07.2019 by BMRCL in respect
of all the properties acquired. A notice in terms of Section 29(2) was issued to the
owners/khathedars asking them to submit documents as stated in the notice for payment of
compensation. Accordingly they submitted the documents after accepting the package
compensation and requested to pay the compensation.
(f) That the land acquisition officer has acted in accordance with law in acquiring the land and
following the provisions of law. That the objections of the petitioners have been considered before
disbursement of the compensation vide detailed orders as per Annexure-B series.
(g) As regards the allegation of purchasing the stamp papers in the month of July and August, 2019
foreseeing the result of conspiracy and grabbing of compensation amount it is contended that as
soon as the compensation package was received from the Committee, notices as per Annexure-R-1
series were issued under Section 29(2) of the KIAD Act notifying the khathedars about receipt of the
package and asking them if they were agreeable to receive the same. They were also asked to submit
the documents to facilitate the payment of compensation. One such document as per Sl.No.7 is
requirement of submitting three stamp papers of Rs.100/- each for executing agreement and
indemnity bond. It is in furtherance to this requirement stamp papers were furnished. Thus, the
allegation of fraud in obtaining stamp papers in the months of July and August is denied.
(h) That the Land Acquisition Officer had received objection from the petitioners on 25.04.2019 and
23.07.2019 and in order to provide opportunity to them had issued notices on 26.07.2019 requiring
them to appear for enquiry on 01.08.2019. In response the petitioners appeared and took time to
submit documents and the matter was posted to 05.08.2019 in which some of the petitioners

Mr. Mujahid B Makki vs The State Of Karnataka on 12 December, 2023
(i) That though in the order dated 08.03.2019 passed in W.P.Nos.7797-98/2019 petitioners were
directed to seek appropriate direction by filing applications in O.S.No.5220/1992, no such
applications were filed and no orders have been obtained by the petitioners from the Court against
payment of compensation to the notified khathedars or orders restraining the authorities from
making the payment. In the circumstances, the officers after conducting the enquiry and hearing the
petitioners/objectors came to the conclusion that there was no justification to withhold the
compensation as notified khathedars had placed the valid documents in support of their claim and
passed the orders on 07.11.2019 as per Annexure-B series for disbursement of compensation.
(j) That keeping the time schedule fixed for implementation of the project the SLAO had made the
payment of compensation to take possession and hand over the same to the project agencies.
Statement showing disbursement of amount is produced at Annexure-R-2 and R-3.
(k) That a complaint was filed before the Lokayuktha by the petitioners on the same set of
allegations and the same has been closed as it was found to be not a fit case for probing.
Endorsement issued by Karnataka Lokayuktha in this regard has been produced at Annexure-R-4.
Hence, sought for dismissal of the petition.
4. Respondents 14 to 22, 35, 38, 42 and 43 in their statement of objections have contended that;
(a) originally the subject property belong to Mohammed Ishaq Saheb who died in the year 1928
leaving behind three sons and five daughters namely (1) Abdul Baqui Ansari (2) Mohammad Abdul
Wasai Ansari (3) Amtul Rasheed (4)Amtul Hadi (5) Amtul Musawari (6) Mariam Bi (7) Amtul
Samad and (8) Abdul Aleem Ansari. Out of them, two sons and five daughters had executed a
registered Release Deed dated 21.11.1945 in favour of Abdul Wasai Ansari by receiving the
consideration relinquishing their rights in the subject property.
(b) That the said Abdul Wasai Ansari remained a bachelor during his life time and he died on
03.08.1980. That during his life time he had entered into an agreement with one Sri.Samiulla, S/o
Mohammed Hanif by receiving consideration for development of the subject land by forming a
residential layout and to dispose of the sites.
(c) That the said land has been acquired by BDA. At the instance of said Sri.Samiulla the State
Government and the authorities dropped the acquisition proceedings on 13.12.1984 and denotified
from acquisition. Before the said Samiulla could obtain a registered conveyance said Sri.Abdul
Wasai passed away. As such, Samiulla again entered into agreement to sell in respect of the subject
land with the legal heirs of Mohammed Ishaq Sahib and obtained general power of attorney and
special power of attorney and formed layout consisting of 54 sites in the said land by obtaining
necessary permission from the concerned authorities.
(d) That the said Sri.Samiulla had acquired the right over the entire land in Sy.No.30/3 which was
owned by late Abdul Wasai Ansari. That the petitioners claiming the land in question through Abdul
Baqui Ansari as grand children of brother of said Abdul Wasai. That in view of execution of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/28418575/ 13
Mr. Mujahid B Makki vs The State Of Karnataka on 12 December, 2023
relinquishment deed they had no right over the property. It is submitted that the compensation had
been paid based on the right, title and interest of the private respondents who have acquired the
property in accordance with law and the petitioners have no claim over the same. Hence, sought for
dismissal of the writ petition.
5. Professor Sri.Ravi Verma Kumar, learned Senior counsel appearing for Sri.Nithyanand V Naik,
learned counsel for petitioners reiterating the grounds urged in the writ petition submitted that;
(a) Petitioner No.8 Sri.Abdul Raheem filed statement of objections before the BMRCL on 15.10.2018
bringing to their notice the pendency of suit in O.S.No.5220/1992 and also the order passed in RFA
No.670/2005 by this Court determining the rights of the petitioners in the subject property. He
further refers to statement of objections filed by petitioner No.1 on 03.12.2018 as per Annexure-L
wherein it is claimed that Sri.Mohammed Ishaq was the owner of the property and that after his
demise Mohammad Abdul Wasai Ansari the maternal uncle of the petitioner was the owner and that
after his death the schedule property has been inherited by the petitioners and others. That a suit in
O.S.No.5220/1992 filed for partition was pending consideration that during the pendency of the suit
acquisition was made for Metro Rail Project and illegal claims were made by several persons for
compensation. That the said petitioner No.1 had again filed a representation on 27.03.2019 again
requesting the respondent authorities to consider their rights and claims while awarding the
compensation. That the petitioners No.2, 3, 5, 6, 7 had also filed detailed statement of objections
along with documents in the nature of family tree, release deed, death certificate of Abdul Wasai,
plaint, written statement and order sheet in O.S.No.5220/1992. That petitioner No.8 once again
filed the representation on 23.07.2019. Thus, referring to representations at Annexures-K to S filed
by the petitioners referred to above, learned Senior counsel submitted that none of the contentions
raised in these representations/objections have been considered by the respondent No.6-SLAO.
(b) That since there is no consent given by the petitioners who were the rightful claimants, the
respondent authorities could not have passed the award under Section 29(2) of KIAD Act.
(c) That the award amount of Rs.62 Crores has been disbursed to the private respondents within 24
hours signifying the collusion between the private Respondents and respondent authorities.
(d) That perusal of stamp papers produced by the private claimants would indicate the same had
been brought in anticipation of the collusive award.
(e) That the fraud has been perpetrated which vitiates the entire process of acquisition.
(f) That some of the purchasers had purchased portion of subject property during the pendency of
suit in O.S.No.5220/1992.
(g) That One Samiulla who claimed to have entered into agreement with Abdul Wasai Ansari and
having obtained power of attorney had filed an application in I.A.No.3 in O.S.No.5220/1992 seeking
to implead himself as additional defendant No.10 and that the trial Court by a detailed order dated
02.09.1994 rejected the said application holding that upon the death of said Abdul Wasai Ansari
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/28418575/ 14
Mr. Mujahid B Makki vs The State Of Karnataka on 12 December, 2023
said Samiulla had no right to claim or act on behalf of the owner. Thus, learned Senior counsel
submit that the said Samiulla cannot claim to have any right, claim and interest over the property.
(h) Learned Senior counsel referring to impugned award dated 07.11.2019 submitted that there is no
reference to the representations made by the petitioners indicating application of mind by the
respondent-SLAO in determining the objections raised by the petitioners. He submitted that
non-consideration of the objections raised by the petitioners had rendered the award process illegal
and unsustainable. In support of this contention learned Senior counsel relied upon Judgment of
this Court in the case of SADASHIVA AND OTHERS VS. STATE OF KARNATAKA AND OTHERS
reported in ILR 2003 Kar
588.
(i) As regards delay in approaching this Court, learned Senior counsel submitted that no notice
regarding conclusion of proceedings were issued to the petitioners. That there was COVID 19
Lockdown during the said period. That on learning about passing of the award and immediately on
relaxation of the lockdown, the petitioner filed RTI application on 31.08.2020 as per Annexure-AB
and obtained the relevant copies and thereafter filed the present writ petition.
(j) That due to COVID 19 pandemic petitioners could not file application under Section 18 of the
Land Acquisition Act seeking reference of the matter.
Hence, seeks for allowing of the petition.
6. Sri.Basavaraj V. Sabarad, learned Senior counsel appearing for Sri.H.L.Pradeep Kumar, learned
counsel for respondent-KIADB submitted that;
(a) petitioners had earlier approached this Court in W.P.Nos.7797-98/2018 wherein by order dated
08.03.2019 the Co-ordinate Bench of this Court taking into consideration the pendency of the suit in
O.S.No.5220/1992 while declining to interfere in the process, had disposed of the writ petition
reserving liberty to the petitioners to seek appropriate direction with regard to compensation
amount to be determined by respondent authorities by filing application. He submitted that no such
application was filed by the petitioners.
(b) He referred to the Judgment and decree passed in said O.S.No.5220/1992 and submitted that
the trial Court has observed the contentions of defendants 1 to 3 therein with regard to execution of
power of attorney by Abdul Wasai Ansari in favour of Samiulla and the burden of proving the
agreement of purchase and the power of attorney was casted on defendants 1 to 3 and the trial Court
has held the execution of the said agreement and power of attorney in the affirmative. That the
petitioners not having challenged the said finding cannot now be permitted to dispute the same.
(c) Referring to compromise decree produced at Annexure-G learned Senior counsel submit that the
said compromise decree has been obtained subsequent to passing of the award and disbursement of
the award. He submits though plaintiffs and the defendants have divided their share of properties
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/28418575/ 15
Mr. Mujahid B Makki vs The State Of Karnataka on 12 December, 2023
but have not given particulars as to which of the properties the division pertains to.
(d) Referring to impugned awards learned Senior counsel submit that the respondent-Special Land
Acquisition Officer indeed has adverted to suit in O.S.No.5220/1992, order in RFA No.670/2005
and order dated 08.03.2019 passed in W.P.Nos.7797-98/2019. That the SLAO has also referred to
the rights of the parties and the subsequent transactions between Abdul Wasai Ansari and
Mohammad Samiulla and also deeds of sale executed in favour of the private respondents. That
after considering these materials placed on record the respondent-SLAO has passed the impugned
award. But since there is no serious dispute with regard to title the respondent authority passed the
impugned award which is well within the purview of his jurisdiction. That there is no requirement of
conducting a rowing enquiry into the matter.
(e) In support of his submissions learned Senior counsel relied upon the following citations:
(i) S.Venkatashamappa Vs State of Karnataka and others reported in ILR 2003 Kar
4496.
(ii) Afzal Bee Vs Special Deputy Collector and others reported in AIR 1978 AP 463.
(iii) State of UP and others Vs Kashi Prasad reported in (2007) 15 SCC 205.
(iv) N.Somashekar and others Vs State of Karnataka and others reported in (1997) 7
KLJ
410.
Hence, seeks for dismissal of the petition.
7. Sri.Krishnamurthy, learned Senior counsel appearing for the private respondents 14 to 22
submitted that;
(a) The award amount has been disbursed on 17.11.2019, where as present writ petition has been
filed on 17.11.2020, i.e., after lapse of over 1 year from the date of disbursement of the award.
(b) that the preliminary notification had been issued on 20.09.2018 and all the petitioners had
appeared before the respondent-SLAO. That after consideration of the objections final notification
had been issued on 17.01.2019. That the petitioners herein had filed the writ petition in
W.P.Nos.7797-98/2019. On 08.03.2019, the said writ petitions was disposed of directing the
petitioners to file necessary applications in the suit in O.S.No.5220/1992 seeking direction to the
authorities for compensation and no such applications were filed.
(c)That the land acquisition officer has passed detailed orders taking into consideration of all the
points raised by the petitioners.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/28418575/ 16
Mr. Mujahid B Makki vs The State Of Karnataka on 12 December, 2023
(d) that there is no challenge to the final notification till date.
(e) that since there was alternate and efficacious remedy available to the petitioners by way of
seeking reference, only to overcome the point of delay the petitioners have approached this court by
filing the present writ petition.
(f) Learned counsel relied upon;
(i) the order of the Division Bench of this court in the case of R.Sethuram and others vs. State of
Karnataka and Others in W.A.No.1065/2021 disposed of on 10.03.2022 and
(ii) Swaika Properties (private) Limited and another vs. State of Rajasthan and another reported in
(2008)4 SCC 695.
8. Sri. Naveed Ahmed, learned counsel appearing for the private respondents 29,31 to 33, 48 and 50
submitted that these respondents have nothing to do with the subject property as their land falls
part of survey No.30/2 and not 30/3. Thus, he submitted that these respondents have been made
parties without any basis and they may be deleted from the array of parties.
9. Heard. Perused the records.
10. Apex court in the case of AFZAL BEE. VS. SPECIAL DEPUTY COLLECTOR AND OTHERS
reported in AIR 1978 A.P. 463 at para 6 has held as under;
"6. If Sections 11, 29, 30 and 18 are read together, it becomes obvious that the Land
Acquisition Officer has the jurisdiction to apportion the compensation among the
persons interested while making an award. That necessarily means that he has the
jurisdiction to decide questions of title if such questions are raised before him. But
instead of deciding the question of title himself, he has the option to refer such
questions to the Court under S. 30 of the Act. Naturally, where complicated questions
of title arise, the Land Acquisition Officer will be expected to refer the questions for
the decision of the Court under S. 30. But where the questions raised are simple, the
Land Acquisition Officer may himself deal with them and incorporate his decision in
the award. If he does not and if a party is aggrieved by the apportionment of
compensation, such party may seek a reference under S. 18 of the Act. In the present
case, the Land Acquisition Officer on the basis of the revenue records came to the
conclusion that the petitioner was not entitled to any share in certain survey
numbers. He noticed that the petitioner did not choose to adduce any evidence in
support of her claim in regard to her share in those survey numbers. The entire
amount of compensation in regard to those survey numbers was awarded to
respondents 2, 3 and 4. It does not appear that the Land Acquisition Officer has
exceeded his jurisdiction in making such award".
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/28418575/ 17
Mr. Mujahid B Makki vs The State Of Karnataka on 12 December, 2023
11. The aforesaid law laid by the Apex Court with regard to jurisdiction of the land acquisition officer
has been followed by this Court in the case of SRI. VENKATARAMANAPPA VS. STATE OF
KARNATAKA reported in ILR 2003 Kar. 4496 wherein at para 9 it has been held as under;
"9. Thus, by a conjoined reading of Section 29 of the Development Act and Section 11
of the Act, the Deputy Commissioner has to hold an enquiry regarding the
entitlement of a person to claim and receive compensation. In the process of
conducting an enquiry regarding the entitlement as held by the decision of the
Andhra Pradesh High Court by Justice Chinnappa Reddy, as he then was, cited by the
learned Counsel for the contesting respondent in AFZAL BEE vs SPL. DEPUTY
COLLECTOR AND OTHERS (supra), the Land Acquisition Officer has jurisdiction to
decide even the question of title if it is raised before him. But, if he feels that the
'question of title' is a complicated one, he may refer the matter to a Civil Court. The
process of deciding the claim of the claimant necessarily carries with if the obligation
of applying his mind to the material produced or available on record in a fair manner,
fairness means that if the land Acquisition Officer wants to use any adverse material
or document adverse to the interest of claimant, it can only be done after drawing the
attention of the claimant to the adverse material and soliciting his comments or
objections, etc. By not doing so, he would be violating the elementary principles of
natural justice. Similarly, while conducting the enquiry as stated above, the Land
Acquisition Officer will be performing statutory functions and therefore, has to
independently take a decision on the basis of records available before him and cannot
act on the dictates of any authority however superior he may be."
12. Learned Senior counsel for the petitioner relied upon the judgment of Coordinate Bench of this
Court in the case of SADASHIVA AND OTHERS VS. STATE OF KARNATAKA AND OTHERS
reported in ILR 2003 KAR.5088, wherein at paragraph 17, 18, 20 has held as under;
17. Re.Point No. (ii):- By the impugned orders the Land Acquisition Officer has not only rejected the
claim for compensation by the petitioners but also has declared that the petitioners have no title to
the property acquired and it is the Government which is the lawful owner of the property, as such
the petitioners are not entitled to any compensation. In other words in a proceedings initiated under
the Land Acquisition Act, the Land Acquisition Officer has gone into the question of title of the
parties and has declared that the petitioners have no title to the property acquired and the title of
the property vests with the Government. Therefore, it becomes necessary to decide whether the
Land Acquisition Officer under the Act has been vested with such power to declare the title of the
parties to the land acquired.
Learned Counsel for the respondent relied on two judgments of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in
the case of AFZAL BEE vs THE SPECIAL DEPUTY COLLECTOR AND OTHERS and in the case of
GOVINDU VENKATA REDDY vs K. KRISHNA RAO AND ANOTHER where it has been held after
noticing Section 11,18, 29, 30, 31 and 32 that the LAO had the jurisdiction to go into the disputed
questions of time. Therefore, it was contended that the impugned order passed by the LAO is valid
and legal and the aggrieved person has a remedy by way of a reference under Section 18 of the Act,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/28418575/ 18
Mr. Mujahid B Makki vs The State Of Karnataka on 12 December, 2023
as such these Writ Petitions are not maintainable.
18. The judgment of the Supreme Court in Raja Harish Chandra Raj Singh's case makes it
abundantly clear that the award to be passed by the LAO is a tender or an offer made by the
Collector on behalf of the Government to the owner of the property for his acceptance. In deciding
the amount of compensation payable the collector holds an enquiry and the said enquiry is confined
to the valuation of the property, i.e, to ascertain the market value of the property before an offer
could be made to the owner of the land. The said valuation is made by the LAO as an agent of the
Government and not as a judicial officer. It is an administrative decision taken by the Collector in
the matter of the valuation of the property sought to be acquired. If that is the correct legal
possession it cannot be said that while making an administrative decision the Collector could decide
the dispute regarding title to the property and that he has the power to decide the complicated
question of title. Infact the enquiry referred to in Section 11 is confined only to enquiry into the
objections which any person interested has stated pursuant to a notice given under Section 9 to the
measurements made under Section 8 and into the value of the land at the date of publication of the
notification under Section 4 sub-section (1) and into the respective interests of the persons claiming
the compensation. In other words in the enquiry what the Land Acquisition Officer is expected to
enquire into is the true area of the land for which he has to pay compensation and bearing in mind
Sections 23 and 24 of the Act, the value of the land acquired and further if there are more than one
claimant claiming compensation incidentally he has to go into the question of their respective
interests in the land for apportionment of the compensation payable. Even for the limited purpose
of apportioning the compensation payable he has to enquire into the respective interests of the
claims it cannot be said in such an enquiry he should go into the question of dispute regarding title
of the respective claimants and more so he can go into the question of title between the claimants
and the Government when the Government is not claiming any apportionment of the compensation.
Having regard to the scheme of the Land Acquisition Act after the LAO decides the true area of the
land and the compensation which is payable for the said land in regard to the apportionment of the
compensation if several persons interested in the said compensation agree for the apportionment of
the compensation, the particulars of such apportionment shall be specified in the award and as
between such persons the award shall be conclusive evidence of the correctness of the
apportionment. In other words when the parties claiming compensation by agreement decides to
receive the compensation in a specified manner all that the Land Acquisition Officer is expected to
indicate in the award is the agreement entered into between such persons. Therefore, the question
of Land Acquisition Officer deciding the title of the parties for the purpose of apportionment of the
land would not arise in such circumstances. However, if the parties do not agree for the
apportionment of compensation, the LAO has the jurisdiction to apportion the said compensation
among all the persons known or believed to be interested in the land of whom or of whose claim he
has information, whether or not they have respectively appeared before him. Having regard to the
language employed in Section 11, the enquiry by the LAO is to enquire into their respective interests
of the persons claiming the compensation, it presupposes that every person who is claiming
compensation has title or interest to the property acquired and it is only the extent of such interest
or title which is in dispute. But in such an enquiry, the Land Acquisition Officer is not called upon to
decide the title of the persons claiming compensation at all. Therefore, in an enquiry to be held
under Section 11, the status does not contemplate the LAO enquiring into the existence or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/28418575/ 19
Mr. Mujahid B Makki vs The State Of Karnataka on 12 December, 2023
non-existence of title of the claimants to the property acquired or to decide in whom else the title of
the property vest.
20. It is equally possible a person interested in the land and the compensation may not have notice
of the acquisition proceedings or after the passing of the award one may acquire title to the property
which is acquired. It is open to such a person to put forth a claim before the Land Acquisition Officer
claiming the amount of compensation and contending that the amount of compensation awarded by
him should not be paid to the persons to whom the said award sets his title. In such circumstances,
it is open to the Collector to refer such dispute to the decision of the Court. There is no period
prescribed in such circumstances either for making an application by the claimant to the LAO
seeking a reference or for the LAO to refer the mater to the Civil Court. It is also open to the LAO not
to make any reference at all. It is left to his discretion. In which event it is for the claimant to
approach Civil Court for appropriate reliefs. Section 31 of the Act deals with a situation where on
making of the award under Section 11 when the collector tenders payment of the compensation
awarded by him to the persons Interested entitled thereto according to the award and if such
persons do not consent to receive it or if there be no person competent to alienate the land, or if
there be any dispute as to the title to receive compensation or as to the apportionment of it, then the
Collector shall deposit the amount of the compensation in the Court to which a reference under
Section 18 would be submitted. Therefore, this provision makes it clear the Land Acquisition Officer
has the absolute power to award compensation and also to apportion the compensation awarded.
But once there is a dispute regarding title to receive the compensation or as to the apportionment of
it and the persons to whom compensation is awarded are not prepared to receive it then his hands
are tied. He cannot make any payment to any one of them named in the award. He shall deposit the
amount of compensation awarded in the Civil Court to which a reference under Section 18 would be
submitted. Therefore, the entire scheme of Sections 11, 18, 30 and 31 of the Act read together makes
it abundantly clear that the Land Acquisition Officer has not been vested with the power to go into
the title of the claimants or go into the question of title of the property acquired. The limited
jurisdiction vested in him is to enquire into the respective interests of the persons claiming the
compensation so as to apportion the said compensation among all the persons known or believed to
be interested in the land. Therefore, such an enquiry cannot be equated to an enquiry to going to the
question of title to the property in dispute and he is not empowered to declare the title of any of the
persons. Therefore, with great respect to the views expressed by the learned Judges of the Andhra
Pradesh High Court, I am of the opinion that in the scheme of the Act, the LAO is not empowered to
going to the question of complicated question of title of the property sought to be acquired".
13. Reading of the aforesaid judgments of the Apex court and of the Coordinate Benches of this
Court reveal that the land acquisition officer though has power and authority to look into the issue
with regard to title of the parties to the land acquired, he cannot decide upon the complicated
questions of title. The said decisions also make it clear the land acquisition officer has option in the
case of complicated question of title to make a reference under Section 18 of the Land Acquisition
Act, 1894.
14. The Coordinate Bench of this Court in the case of CHINNASWAMY LINGAPPA VS. STATE OF
KARNATAKA 2017(2) K.L.J 185 while dealing with the question of enquiry to be held by the land
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/28418575/ 20
Mr. Mujahid B Makki vs The State Of Karnataka on 12 December, 2023
acquisition officer under Section 28(2) of the KIAD Act, 1966 referring to the judgments of the Apex
Court on the subject at paragraphs 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 has held as under;
7. Sub-section (2) of Section 28 of the Act states, on publication of a notification under sub-section
(1), the State Government shall serve notice upon the owner or where the owner is not the occupier
on the occupier of the land and on all such persons known or believed to be interested therein to
show-cause, within thirty days from the date of service of the netics, why the land should not be
acquired. Sub- section (3) of Section 28 of the Act states, after considering the cause, if any, shown
by the owner of the land and by any other person interested therein, and after giving such owner
and person an opportunity of being heard, the State Government may pass such orders as it deems
fit.
8.In The Barum Chemicals Ltd. and another v. A.J. Rana and others, MANU/SC/0488/1971 AIR
1972 SC 591, the Apex Court was considering the meaning of the word "consider". It has been held
thus:
"The words 'considers it necessary' postulate that the authority concerned has
thought over the matter deliberately and with care and it has been found necessary as
a result of such thinking to pass the order. The dictionary meaning of the word
consider is to view attentively, to survey, examine, inspect (arch), to look attentively,
to contemplate mentally to think over, meditate on, give need to, take note of, to
think deliberately bethink oneself, to reflect (vide Shorter Oxford Dictionary).
According to Words and Phrases Permanent Edn: Vol.8-A to consider means to think
with care. It is also mentioned that to 'consider is to fix the mind upon with a view to
careful examination; to ponder; study meditate upon, think or reflect with care. It is
therefore, manifest that careful thinking or due application of the mind regarding the
necessity to obtain and examine the documents in question in since que non for the
making of the order. If the Impugned order were to show that there has been no
careful thinking or proper application of the mind as to the necessity of obtaining and
examining the documents specified in the order, the essential requisite to the making
of the order would be held to be non- existent."
9. This Court to the case of D. Hemachandra Sagar and another v. State of Karnataka and others,
1999 (1) KLJ 510 was considering the case relating to consideration of objections by the Bangalore
Development Authority under Section 17(5) of the Act. It has been held as under:
"A statutory Authority like BDA evolves its own procedure to consider the
representations filed by the owners in respect of the proposed acquisition. There is no
hard and fast rule that the Authority itself should consider each of the
representations before making appropriate orders. However, it is settled that the
consideration of the representation by any Authority should be in the manner
recognised by law. 'Consideration of representation' postulates that the Authority
concerned has thought over the matter by applying its mind to the relevant portion of
the representations and may make its recommendation assigning reasons for such
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/28418575/ 21
Mr. Mujahid B Makki vs The State Of Karnataka on 12 December, 2023
recommendation. Mere extracting the nature of objections and his remarks without
assigning reasons is no consideration at all."
10. The Apex Court in the case of Hindustan Petroleum Corpn. Ltd., v. Darius Shapur Chenal and
others, MANU/SC/0610/2005: 2005 (7) SCC 627 (AIR 2005 SC 3520) was considering the scope of
Section 5-A of the Land Acquisition Act, which is in pari materia with Section 28(3) of the Act. It has
been held as under:
"The Land Acquisition Act is an expropriatory legislation. In such a case the
provisions of the statute should be strictly construed as it deprives a person of his
land without consent. Section SA of the Act confers a valuable and Important right in
favour of a person whose lands are sought to be acquired and having regard to the
provisions contained in Article 300-A of the Constitution it has been held to be akin
to a fundamental right. The State in exercise of its power of "eminent domain"
may interfere with the right of property of a person by acquiring the same but the same must be for
a public purpose and reasonable compensation therefor must be paid".
It has been further held as under:
"The conclusiveness contained in Section 6 of the Act indisputably is attached to a
need as also the purpose and in this regard ordinarily, the jurisdiction of the Court is
limited but it is equally true that when an opportunity of being heard has expressly
been conferred by a statute, the same must scrupulously be complied with. For the
said purpose, Sections 4, 5 and 6 of the Act must be read conjointly. The Court in a
case, where there has been total non-
compliance or substantial non-compliance of the provisions of Section 5-A of the Act
cannot fold its hands and refuse to grant a relief to the writ petitioner. Section 6(3) of
the Act renders a declaration to be a conclusive evidence. But when the decision
making process itself is in question, the power of judicial review can be exercised by
the Court in the event the order impugned suffers from well- known principles, viz.,
legality, Irrationality and procedural impropriety. Moreover, when a statutory
authority exercises such enormous power, it must be done in a fair and reasonable
manner,
11. In Raghbir Singh Sehrawat v. State of Haryana and others (MANU/SC/1429/2011 AIR 2012 SC
468): (2012) 1 SCC 792, the Apex Court has held as under:
42. It is difficult, if not impossible, to appreciate as to why the State and its
instrumentalities resort to massive acquisition of land and that too without
complying with the mandate of the statute. As noted by the National Commission on
Farmers, the acquisition of agricultural land in the name of planned development or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/28418575/ 22
Mr. Mujahid B Makki vs The State Of Karnataka on 12 December, 2023
industrial growth would seriously affect the availability. of food in future.
After independence, the administrative apparatus of the State has not spent enough investment in
the rural areas and those who have been doing agriculture have not been educated and empowered
to adopt alternative sources of livelihood. If land of such persons is acquired, not only the current
but the future generations are ruined and this is one of the reasons why the farmers who are
deprived of their holdings commit suicide.
(Emphasis supplied by me)"
15. The instant case and the issue raised by the learned counsel for the parties are
require to be determined in the light of the aforesaid principles of law.
16. In the Writ Petition the petitioners claim to be the descendent of on Mohammed
Ishaq Sahib who was the owner of subject land. However, from the perusal of
objections/ representation dated: 15.10.2018 & 23.07.2019 at Annexures K & P made
by Abdul Rehaman the petitioner no.8, it is seen that, he is claiming that the subject
property belonged to Abdul Wasai Ansari, who died issue less as on 03.08.1980 and
after his death, his cousin was in possession of the said property and since she
refused to give the share, he and his brothers & sisters files a suit in O.S.
NO.5220/1992 and that the said suit was dismissed on 24.02.2005 and in RFA
NO.670/2005, this court held they were entitled for 3/4th share, hence sought of
payment of compensation. Similar is the representation made by other petitioners on
03.12.2018, 27.03.2019 and 20.05.2019 as per Annexures L, M & N respectively.
17. It is further contended that the Abdul Wasai Ansari had not created any interest
in favour of any person in respect of the subject property. That the out of 3 acres 20
guntas subject property an extent of 2 acres 30 guntas had been acquired by BDA and
award in terms of Annexure-C had been passed by the BDA.
18. A note in Annexure-C reads that "Out of 3 -10 guntas of land notified for
acquisition an extent of 0.20 guntas of land is found to be built during inspection of
the spot on 26.11.1987". Hence, the award is passed for remaining extent of 2 acre 20
guntas of land which is adjacent to the main road.
19. Thus it is the contention of the petitioners that the 20 guntas of land had been
excluded and during the inspection it was found that there existed buildings on the
said 20 guntas of land even as in the year 1987.
Therefore, it was contended on behalf of the petitioners that there is no question of
any third party acquiring title as sought to be contended by the private respondents
in the instant petition. A reference to rejection of application filed by Sri. S.Samiulla,
in O.S.No.5220/1992 seeking to implead there as a party defendant on the premise of
he having entered into an agreement of sale is also made in support of this
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/28418575/ 23
Mr. Mujahid B Makki vs The State Of Karnataka on 12 December, 2023
contention.
20. Respondents have produced a copy of registered release deed dated 21.11.1945 in
terms of which M. Abdul Wasai Ansari had acquired exclusive right in respect of the
land in Sy.No.30/3. Respondents have also claimed that said Abdul Wasai Ansari had
executed an agreement of sale and power of attorney in favour of said Sri. S.Samiulla.
21. It is necessary to note that name of said S.Samiulla finds mention even in the said
award dated 18.02.1988 produced at Annexure-C wherein at page 8 and 9 name of
said S.Samiulla has been referred to as a claimant. Further, perusal of Annexure-B a
communication issued in the office of Commissioner and Secretary, Housing and
Urban Development Department to the Commissioner-BDA would reveal that the
said S.Samiulla had made representation for re-allotment of acquired land.
The said S.Samiulla had indeed filed an application seeking to implead himself as
party in the original Suit in O.S.No.5220/1992 which application was rejected by
order dated 2.9.1994. Even in the judgment and decree passed in the said
O.S.No.5220/1992 on 24.02.2005 while dealing with issue No. 5 the trial court had
held in affirmative the said issue by holding that said S.Samiulla had entered into
agreement to purchase the share of defendants 1 to 3.
22. Thus, from the above facts, it is clear that the petitioners are aware of the claim
being made by said S. Samiulla being agreement holder and power of attorney holder
of said Abdul Wasai Ansari at an undisputed point in time. Except filing a suit for
partition, the petitioners have not taken any steps with regard to determination of
their right, title and interest in respect of their purported undivided share in the
subject property that too claiming to be the decedents of late Abdul Wasai Ansari.
23. As rightly pointed out by learned Senior counsel appearing for the respondents
the petitioners who had approached this court after passing of judgment and order in
RFA No.607/2005 wherein this court though had held petitioners being entitled for
3/4th share had remitted the matter for re-determination of issue nos. 1 and 7,
namely, whether the plaintiffs prove that they are the only heirs and successor of
Smt. Amthul Samad? and whether the plaintiffs are entitled to partition and separate
possession of their share as prayed for?.
24. The petitioners even before the determination of the said issues had entered into
a compromise petition as per Annexure-G, wherein the plaintiffs have been
purportedly allotted 50% of the share in the suit schedule property and the
defendants have been allotted 40% and 2 others i.e., Mohammed Fahidduni, Makki
and Mujahid Barkathula Makki (petitioner No.1 herein) have been allotted 10%. It is
not clear in the compromise petition as to in which of the schedule properties they
has been allotted the shares as noted above.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/28418575/ 24
Mr. Mujahid B Makki vs The State Of Karnataka on 12 December, 2023
25. It is pertinent to refer to contents at paragraphs 11 and 13 of the said compromise
memo which are extracted hereunder;
"11. The parties shall put committed and collective effort and to defend their action,
to claim, for disbursement compensation amount and to get the benefits in respect of
the remaining portion of the land (other than the land acquired by the KIADB). The
parties shall approach the competent authorities, forums, courts of law, to safeguard
and protect their interest over the remaining portion of the land and further to
negotiate among themselves, third parties, legal entities to get maximum benefit,
utilization and the above mentioned apportionment of shares holds good in this
regard. In the event of collective and committed effort by the parties, the expenses,
cost incurred shall be born in the same proportion true to the aforesaid shares".
13. All the parties solemnly affirm, declare concede that they have no objection whatsoever for
distribution of compensation by KIADB being the acquisition authority specifically as per the above
mutually agreed shares which are irrevocable".
26. The date of the compromise is 28.02.2020. As per the averments made at paragraph 5 and 6 of
the writ petition, the petitioners had approached KIAD and had sought for relevant records
pertaining to acquisition and the authorities had failed to furnish the same. That taking advantage of
COVID-19 crisis officers had mislead the petitioners about passing of the impugned orders or
disbursement of the amount. It is further assessed that the petitioners had applied under Right to
Information Act and had obtained the information on 31.08.2020 as per Annexure-AB and learnt
about the impugned order having been passed and amount having been disbursed.
27. In this context it is also necessary to note that the petitioners had approached this Court
immediately after the final notification in W.P.No.7790-98/2019 seeking direction to the
respondents 3 and 4 to consider their representations dated:03.12.2018. Co-ordinate Bench of this
Court taking note of pendency of the above suit in O.S.No.5220/1992 had passed the following
order;
"2.Having regard to the fact that O.S.No.5220/1992 is pending before the City Civil
Court, Bengaluru, which is a suit for partition, petitioners who are the defendants in
the said suit have sought for further proceedings being stopped by the acquisition
authorities - KIADB (Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board) and not to pass
any award in the matter. Having regard to the fact that there is a suit for partition
filed by the plaintiffs who are also not arrayed as respondents in these petitions and
the subject matter of the suit is also the subject matter of acquisition, this Court does
not deem it proper to interfere at this stage of the matter.
3. In the circumstances, the writ petitions are disposed of by reserving liberty to the
petitioners herein to seek appropriate directions with regard to the compensation
amount to be determined by the respondents - authorities by filing an application in
O.S.No.5220/1992. It is needless to observe that if any such application is filed by the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/28418575/ 25
Mr. Mujahid B Makki vs The State Of Karnataka on 12 December, 2023
petitioners herein, the trial Court shall consider the same in accordance with law and
pass a speaking order thereon".
28. When the Coordinate Bench of this Court, had disposed of the said writ petition reserving the
liberty to the petitioners to seek appropriate directions with regard to compensation amount to be
determined by the respondent-authority by filing an application in the said suit in
O.S.No.5220/1992 and with a further direction to the trial Court to consider the same in accordance
with law and to pass to speaking order thereon as noted above, there is no justification of any nature
whatsoever provided by the petitioners for they not opting this course of action. The contentions
that COVID-19 Pandemic had kept them under dark also cannot be countenanced as the aforesaid
writ petition was disposed of on 08.03.2019, while the petitioners filed their representations as per
Annexure-K to S on 05.10.2018, 3.12.2018, 27.03.2019, 28.05.2019, 23.07.2019, 08.08.2019,
30.09.2019 and 08.03.2020. Thus the petitioners instead of filing the applications before the trial
Court as observed by this Court went on filing the applications as noted above, and thereafter have
filed compromise petition as per Annexure-G and have obtained compromise decree on 28.02.2020.
Thus, the petitioners cannot plead that they were prevented from the COVID-19 pandemic in taking
effective measures while they have been consistently filing representations even during the
COVID-19 period.
29. As the Apex Court has settled the legal proposition that the land acquisition officer has
jurisdiction to look into the issues pertaining to title barring complicated issues of title, perusal of
the impugned award reveal that the respondent No.6-SLAO apart from taking note of orders,
judgment and decree passed in O.S.No.5220/1992, RFA No.670/2005, W.P.Nos.7797- 98/2019 and
also taking note of the deeds of sale, revenue records furnished by private respondents has come to
the conclusion that the private respondents had established their right over the properties
purchased by them. The narration of facts and reasons assigned by the respondent 6- SLAO in the
impugned awards cannot be said to be the one without application of mind. There is indeed
reference to the details of the objections raised by the petitioners and determination of the same.
30. As already noted above, petitioners who are aware of claim being made by S.Samiulla of he
having entered into agreement of sale and obtaining general power of attorney not only from Abdul
Wasai Ansari but also from his other legal heirs after his demise, have not taken any steps to
challenge the said transactions and establishing their rights. More so, when those issues had come
up for consideration in the very suit in O.S.No.5220/1992.
31. Least that the petitioners were expected to do was to seek reference of the matter under Section
18 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. That not having been done, the petitioners approaching this
Court after lapse of more than one year citing reasons of COVID-19 pandemic under the facts
situation narrated hereinabove cannot be accepted.
32. The Division Bench of this Court in its order dated 10.03.2022 passed in W.A.No.1065/2021 at
para 11 has held as under;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/28418575/ 26
Mr. Mujahid B Makki vs The State Of Karnataka on 12 December, 2023
"11. In the backdrop of aforesaid principles, the facts of this case in hand may be
adverted to. It is also pertinent to mention here that the writ petition was filed on or
about 20.01.2017, whereas the award was passed on 26.11.2015. Though the
petitioners were aware about the acquisition proceedings, yet they waited for the
award to be passed and thereafter, filed a writ petition after a period of one year and
two months. Thus, the writ petition suffers from delay and laches and therefore,
belated challenge to the land acquisition proceedings cannot be entertained. For yet
another reason, no relief can be granted to the petitioner as the petitioner has not
assailed the award dated 26.11.2015 in the writ petition".
33. The Apex Court in the case of R.Sethuram and others vs. State of Karnataka and another- (2008)
4 SCC 695 at para 16 and 18 has held as under;
"16. Another important aspect which is required to be noticed by this Court is that the
Sewage Treatment Plants cannot be established anywhere and everywhere. The
underground drainages have to be linked and vantage point where there is a natural
gradient allowing free water flow have to be identified for establishment of wet wells
and filtration plants. Therefore, having regard to such a technical requirement, the
submission of the learned counsel for the petitioners that any other land could be
identified or that government lands could be identified for the establishment of
Sewage Treatment Plants, cannot be accepted.
18. Therefore, while rejecting the prayers made by the petitioners in this writ petition,
this writ petition stands disposed of permitting the petitioners to file an application
before the Special Land Acquisition Officer within a period of 30 days from the date
of receipt of a certified copy of this order. As and when the application is filed before
the Special Land Acquisition Officer, the Special Land Acquisition Officer shall make
a reference to the authority in terms of Section 64 of the Act without going into the
question of limitation".
34. As regards the allegation of collusion, fraud and fabrication of documents, as rightly submitted
by learned Senior counsel for the KIADB, the stamp papers of the months of July and August, 2019
were submitted by the private respondents in response to the notices dated 26.07.2019 issued by the
authorities calling upon them to submit the documents. The plea of pre-dated documents therefore
cannot be sustained. That apart, the proceedings initiated by the Lokayukta at the instance of the
petitioners have been closed as the matter was found not fit for probe as evidenced by the
preliminary scrutiny note dated 14.09.2020 enclosed with endorsement dated 22.09.2020 at
Annexure-R10.
35. For the aforesaid analysis and the reasons, more particularly of the inaction on the part of the
petitioners in not taking effective measures despite having sufficient opportunity and even as
directed by the Co- Ordinate Bench of this Court, cannot be heard to say that the petitioners were
not given sufficient opportunity to put forth their case and that the respondents -authorities acted
arbitrarily in rejecting their claim.

Mr. Mujahid B Makki vs The State Of Karnataka on 12 December, 2023
36. The petitioners in the above facts and circumstances of the matter, have not made out any
grouse warranting interference by this Court with the award passed by respondent No.6-SLAO.
Hence, writ petition is dismissed.
The assistance rendered by Mr.Siddiq Hussain Khan Shah, Law Clerk cum Research Assistant is
placed on record.
