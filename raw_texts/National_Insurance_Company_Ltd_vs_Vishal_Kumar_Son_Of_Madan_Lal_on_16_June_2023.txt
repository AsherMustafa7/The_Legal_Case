JUDGMENT
1. Appellant under the provisions of Section 173 of the Motor Vehicles Act 1988 has preferred instant
appeal against judgment/award dated 31.01.2022 passed by MACT Jammu in file No. 566/claim
titled Vishal Kumar Versus Ajeet Singh and Ors., whereby the Tribunal has directed the appellant to
pay an amount of Rs. 16,01,330/- (Rupees Sixteen lacs one thousand three hundred and thirty) to
respondent No.1 which as per the appellant is too excessive.
2. Being aggrieved of and dissatisfied with the impugned award/judgment, appellant has assailed
it(cid:128)s legality, propriety and correctness and has sought its setting aside on the following grounds:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/57625998/ 1
National Insurance Company Ltd. ... vs Vishal Kumar Son Of Madan Lal on 16 June, 2023
(i) that the respondent No. 1 (claimant) filed an application/petition under section
166 of Motor Vehicles Act 1988 against appellant and respondents 2 & 3 as
owner-cum-driver for alleged accident with offending vehicle bearing registration No.
JK21/9839 and claimed compensation of Rs. 40 lakhs on account of disability
suffered by him to the extent of 40 percent due to fracture of lateral condoyle of
femur;
(ii) that the learned Tribunal after conclusion of the proceedings passed the amount
award of Rs. 16,01,330/- with interest at the rate 7.5 percent per annum by assessing
the income of injured claimant as Rs. 15,000/- per month only on the basis of guess
work otherwise there was no record regarding his income as per his own statement
that he was pursuing M.A in Jammu University;
(iii) that the learned tribunal ought to have determined the loss of future earnings only on the basis
of notional income of Rs. 5000/- per month in terms of Hon(cid:128)ble Supreme Court judgment rendered
in a case titled "S.R Krishna Murthy v New India Assurance Co Ltd. Reported in 2019 ACJ 1291",
wherein the compensation was assessed on the basis of notional income of Rs. 5000/- per month;
(iv) that the Hon(cid:128)ble Supreme Court in a case titled" Kajal v Jagdish" reported in 2020 AIR (SC)
776 has considered the monthly income of victim aged 12 years as Rs. 4846/- per month, it was not
proved that the academic career of the claimant was affected in any manner with the disability he
suffered, it is not the case of the claimant (respondent No. 1) that due to injury/disability he has
been completely impaired or deprived to any occupation or income as a result of such disability and
also respondent No. 1 was not involved in any skilled or unskilled labour or he was a bright student
having excellent academic career, therefore, compensation determined for loss of earnings/income
is apparently much on higher side; it is admitted fact that the claimant (respondent No. 1) was
student at the time of alleged accident and even after the accident he is pursuing studies and his
income as assessed by the Tribunal is not proved, hence the principles laid down by the Apex Court
in Pranay Sethi's judgment is not applicable, therefore, the award amount is not sustainable and
liable to be set aside.
3. On the pleadings of the parties, learned Tribunal framed the following issues in the claim
petition:-
(i) Whether an offending vehicle (Maruti Car Ritz) bearing registration
No.JK21-9839 on 27-12-2016 on its way from R.S.Pura towards Chakroi was being
driven rashly and negligently by respondent No. 1, as a result of which on reaching
Dongrian enroute, it hit a motorcycle bearing registration No.JK02AW-5374 coming
from opposite direction and being driven by petitioner causing accident and grievous
injuries to petitioner leading to his disablement to the extent shown in the disability
certificate?.....OPP
(ii) If issue No. 1 is proved in affirmative, whether petitioner is entitled to
compensation, if yes, to what amount and from whom? OPP
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/57625998/ 2
National Insurance Company Ltd. ... vs Vishal Kumar Son Of Madan Lal on 16 June, 2023
(iii) Whether the offending vehicle was being driven at the time of accident in
contravention of terms and conditions of insurance policy and the driver was not
holding a valid driving license at the time of accident, as such, the respondent
insurance company is not liable to pay compensation to the petitioner? ... OPR-1
(iv) Relief...? O.P.Parties.
4. Learned counsel for the parties noted down the issue before the tribunal.
Petitioner (respondent No.1) was directed to lead evidence first. To prove the averments of the claim
petition, petitioner (respondent No. 1) examined himself along with his two witnesses namely PW
Vikram Singh and PW Dr. Kanav Padha.
5. Before rendering findings on the issues framed by the learned tribunal, it is pertinent to give a
brief resume of the evidence led by the petitioner (respondent No. 1 before the tribunal).
Petitioner Vishal Kumar in his affidavit has reiterated the averments made in his claim petition. In
cross examination by the counsel for the respondent company he born on 04.02.2000 and taken
admission in MA Hindi. It is wrong that at the time of accident he was driving motorcycle however,
was seated as pillion rider and the name of the motorcyclist is Pardeep Kumar. He does not know
whether Pardeep Kumar has driving licence or not. It is wrong that the ill-fated motorcycle and
offending vehicle collided in the middle of the road however; the offending vehicle hit the ill-fated
motorcycle on side of the road. He has noted the registration number of the vehicle on the spot. It is
true that FIR was lodged by his parents one month after the accident through court order. The name
of the driver of the offending vehicle is Ajit Singh. He neither knows as to what name of driver is
mentioned in the FIR as well as in Charge sheet. There was no vehicle on the road ahead of place of
accident.
PW: Vikram Singh in his affidavit has deposed that he knows the petitioner since the day of accident
as he was present on the spot when he met with an accident. Petitioner met with an accident on
27.12.2016 at about 08.15 a.m at Dhangray R.S.Pura, Jammu while he was going from Chakroi
towards Dangrain on motor-cycle bearing No.JK02AW- 5374 as pillion rider and he was hit by
offending Maruti Ritz Car No.JK21-9839 coming from R.S.Pura side. Mr. Vishal Kumar was hit by
offending Maruti Ritz Car No.JK21-9839 and the accident was caused due to the rash and negligent
driving of the driver of the offending Maruti Ritz Car No.JK21-9839. As a result of said accident,
petitioner sustained serious injuries on his body in the accident due to which his right leg was
fractured. He was immediately shifted to GMC, Bakshi Nagar, Jammu in the same offending vehicle.
He has seen the accident with own eyes from a distance of merely 15 to 20 meters and it was caused
due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the offending Maruti Ritz Car No.JK21-9839.
In cross examination by the counsel for the respondent company stated that he knows the
injured/petitioner Vishal Kumar from the day of accident and that has shop of car repairing at
Dogra Hall. He has not informed the police about the accident. However, was present on the place of
accident. He does not know the registration number of the offending vehicle and also that police had
not recorded his statement. He has neither gone with injured to hospital nor knows as to where the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/57625998/ 3
National Insurance Company Ltd. ... vs Vishal Kumar Son Of Madan Lal on 16 June, 2023
injured remained under treatment. It is wrong that on the day of accident he was present at his car
repairing workshop however; had gone village Dongre situated ahead of R.S. Pura in order to repair
the car. He was at a distance of 20 meters at the time of accident and today has come to depose on
the request of petitioner. He has seen the driver of the offending vehicle but not knows his name.
PW-Dr.Kanav Padha, in examination in chief by the learned counsel for petitioner has stated that on
11.05.2018, he was posted at Govt. Hospital Gandhi Nagar, Jammu and a medical board was
constituted by Chief Medical Officer, Jammu to assess the disability of Vishal Kumar, S/o Mohan
Lal, R/o Badyal Qazian, R.S.Pura, Jammu Age:18 Yrs. As per the record annexed with the court file
the alleged history of road traffic accident registered under the MLC No.477, Emergency Slip
No.0082231 dt: 25.01.2017 registered at GMC, Jammu. The MLC number is given as per the
direction of CJM, Jammu. The patient has subsequently suffered post traumatic stiffness of right
knee with fibrous alkalosis with common perennial palsy of the right lower limb. His permanent
disability was assessed by the board as 40%, which is permanent in nature. The disability certificate
on the court file bears his seal and signatures along with other board members. The contents of the
same are true and correct, which is exhibited as EXPW-KP. The patient may require special diet and
physiotherapy. The petitioner cannot apply for any kind of belt force service like Army, Para military
force or police etc. In cross examination by the counsel for the respondent company has stated that
he has not seen the patient today in the court. It is true that he has not treated the petitioner. He has
only examined the petitioner while assessing his permanent disability. It is true that the disability
assessed to the certificate pertains to a particular limb i.e., right lower limb and not of the whole
body. It is true that the disability shall be decrease when compare to whole body, but he cannot
quantify the decrease of percentage of disability as compare to whole body. It is true that treatment
given to the petitioner and the reference of MLC is not recorded in the certificate. On the basis of
diagnoses mentioned in the certificate the cumulative disability was assessed to be 40%. The exact
scientific calculations including stability component, range of motion, pain, any neurovascular
deficit etc. to assess the disability are not usually mentioned on the disability certificate. With this
disability petitioner can continue with the studies. Stiffness of the right knee may or may not
improve with physiotherapy. Petitioner can apply for any civil or government/private job.
6. Respondents before the tribunal have not led any evidence to disapprove the case pleaded by the
petitioner(respondent no. 1). Therefore, the evidence led by the petitioner is to be considered in
regard to his claim averred in the claim petition.
7. Respondent No. 1 (petitioner/claimant before the Tribunal) has filed cross-objections to the
appeal for enhancement of the award passed by MACT Jammu dated 31.01.2022 in claim petition
file No. 566/Claim dated 24.10.2018 titled Vishal Kumar v/s Ajeet Singh & Ors. It is averred, that
the learned Tribunal vide impugned award/judgment dated 31.01.2022 has awarded compensation
to the petitioner/claimant in the sum of Rs.16,01,330/- along with interest @ 7.5% P.A from the date
of institution of claim petition, though till date not a single penny has been received, however, the
award amount granted by the Tribunal is less. It is stated, that the Presiding Officer of the MACT
Jammu has taken the monthly income of the claimant to be Rs. 15,000/- P.M only despite the fact
that he was pursuing his graduation, doing his masters at the time he made statement before the
Tribunal, therefore, the Tribunal could have assessed Rs. 25,000/- P.M as monthly income of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/57625998/ 4
National Insurance Company Ltd. ... vs Vishal Kumar Son Of Madan Lal on 16 June, 2023
claimant in view of his qualification and loss of the opportunities because of the permanent
disability of 40% suffered by him, even if his notional income was taken into consideration, then the
annual loss of income could have been, Rs 25,000x12=Rs 3,00,000/- and as per the latest law of the
Apex Court of India annual income was to be enhanced @ 40% as the age of the claimant was below
40 years and after calculation it comes to Rs. 4,20,000/-, the claimant had suffered 40% disability
of a particular limb and the Tribunal had rightly slashed it down to 30% of the whole body therefore,
the annual loss of income of the claimant could be 30% of 4,20,000/- i.e. Rs 1,26,000/- and
applying the multiplier of 18 the loss of future earnings i.e. Pecuniary Damages (special damages)
could be, 1,26,000x18=Rs 22,68,000/-. It is averred, that the claimant/respondent No. 1 is also
entitled a sum of Rs. 2,00,000/- for initial hospitalization, Rs 85,534/- for medical bills, Rs
1,00,000/- for attendant charges, diet and transport expenses, Rs. 2,00,000/- for pain sufferings
and trauma for life, Rs 2,00,000/- for loss of amenities of life and loss/shortening of normal
longevity of life, therefore, total compensation of Rs. 30,53,534/- only with 7.5% P.A could be the
reasonable compensation to the petitioner.
8. I have heard learned counsel for parties and perused the entire material available on record and
considered the respective submissions made by learned counsel.
9. Issue No. 1: This issue is to the effect, "whether an offending vehicle (Maruti Car Ritz) bearing
registration No.JK21-9839 on 27.12.2016 on its way from R.S.Pura, towards Chakroi was being
driven rashly and negligently by respondent no.1, as a result of which on reaching Dongrian enroute,
it hit a motor-cycle bearing registration No.JK02AW- 5374 coming from opposite direction and
being driven by petitioner causing accident and grievous injuries to petitioner leading to his
disablementto the extent shown in the disability certificate"?......OPP The burden of proof of issue
no. 1 lies on the petitioner/respondent No. 1. Petitioner in the claim petition has alleged that on
27/12/2016 petitioner he while driving motorcycle bearing registration No. JK02AW/5374 coming
from opposite direction was hit by offending vehicle Maruti Car Ritz bearing registration No.
JK21/9839 on its way from R.S Pura towards Chakroi and being driven rashly and negligently by its
driver (respondent No. 2) as a result offending vehicle on reaching Dongrain enroute caused
accident whereby petitioner sustained grievous injuries leading to his disablement. Petitioner Vishal
Kumar has corroborated the contents of claim petition. PW Vikram Singh in his affidavit has
categorically deposed that petitioner met an accident on 27/12/2016 at 08.15 AM while driving his
motorcycle bearing registration No. JK02AW/5374 which was hit by offending vehicle Maruti Car
Ritz bearing registration No. JK21/9839 coming from R.S Pura whereby petitioner Vishal Kumar
sustained grievous injuries in his body and got his right leg fractured. The depositions of petitioner
Vishal Kumar and PW Vikram Singh have proved the fact that offending vehicle Maruti Car Ritz
bearing registration No. JK21/9839 on 27/12/2016 hit the motorcycle of petitioner bearing
registration No. JK02AW/5374 whereby petitioner sustained grievous injuries and got disabled.
Issue No. 1, therefore, has been rightly decided and proved by the Tribunal in favour of the
petitioner/respondent No. 1. I, therefore, do not find any reason to interfere with the finding
recorded by the Tribunal to the said extent, therefore, the finding of Issue No. 1 is affirmed.
10. Issue No.2: - This issue is to the effect, "if issue No. 1 is proved in affirmative whether petitioner
is entitled to compensation, if yes, to what amount and from whom?......... OPP Burden of proof of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/57625998/ 5
National Insurance Company Ltd. ... vs Vishal Kumar Son Of Madan Lal on 16 June, 2023
this issue lies on the petitioner. Issue No. 1 has been proved and decided in favour of the petitioner
as against respondents. Before returning finding on issue No. 2, it is pertinent to discuss the law
regarding assessment of compensation to a victim of an accident. In this regard law has been settled
by an authoritative pronouncement rendered by Hon(cid:128)ble Supreme Court of India in a case reported
in [AIR 1995 Supreme Court 755 (R.D Hattangadi V. M/s Pest Control (India) Pvt. Ltd & Ors],
wherein, the Hon(cid:128)ble Supreme court held as under: -
(A) Motor Vehicles Act (4 of 1939), Sec 110-B-Accident-
Compensaiton -Pecuniary and non-Pecuniary damages-What constitute.
"While fixing an amount of compensation payable to a victim of an accident, the
damages have to be assessed separately as pecuniary damages and special damages.
Pecuniary damages are those which the victim has actually incurred and which is
capable of being calculated in terms of money; whereas non-pecuniary damages are
those which are incapable of being assessed by arithmetical calculations. In order to
appreciate two concepts, pecuniary damages may include expenses incurred by the
claimant;
(i) medical attendance; (ii) loss of earning of profit up to the date of trial; (iii) other
material loss. So far non-pecuniary damages are concerned, they may include: (i)
damages for mental and physical shock, pain suffering, already suffered or likely to
be suffered in future; (ii) damages to compensate for the loss of amenities of life
which may include a variety of matters i.e on account of injury the claimant may not
be able to work, run or sit; (iii) damages for the loss of expectation of life, i.e., on
account of injury the „normal longevity of the person concerned is shortened; (iv)
inconvenience, hardship, discomfort, disappointment, frustration and mental stress
in life." (para 9) (B) Motor vehicles act (4 of 1939), S.110B-Compensation-
Determination-Some guess work is involved.
"In its very nature whenever a tribunal or a court is required to fix the amount of
compensation in cases of accident, it involves some guess work, some hypothetical
consideration, some amount of sympathy linked with the nature of the disability
caused. But all the aforesaid elements have to be viewed with objective standards".
(para12) In the backdrop of the law laid down in the case law (supra), for assessment of
compensation to a victim of an accident, the compensation in favour of appellant in the case in
hand, is to be assessed and awarded on the strength of evidence on record under the following
heads: -
(A) P E C U N I A R Y DAMAGES: -
(B) NON-PECUNIARY DAMAGES: -

National Insurance Company Ltd. ... vs Vishal Kumar Son Of Madan Lal on 16 June, 2023
(A) P E C U N I A R Y D A M A G E S: -
Pecuniary damages can be classified under the following heads.
(i) Compensation on account of total loss of future earning: It is settled law that for
awarding compensation the Tribunal has to fix the monthly income of the
petitioner/injured at the time of accident, the % of his disablement and its effect on
the future income and age of the victim/injured for calculating appropriate
multiplier. Petitioner (respondent No. 1) in this claim petition filed before MACT
Jammu has categorically stated that he was student of B.A Part I of Degree College
R.S Pura aged 19 years and on 27/12/2016 at about 08.15 a.m he was going from
Chakroi towards Dangrian on motorcycle bearing registration No. JK02AW/5371
whereas offending vehicle Maruti Car Ritz bearing registration No. JK21/9839 driven
by its driver in a rash and negligent manner hit his motorcycle whereby he sustained
multiple fractures on right leg whereby he is unable to put weight on the said leg and
got permanently disabled up to 40%. Learned Tribunal while passing the impugned
award has observed that petitioner was pursuing his graduation at the time of
accident, so his monthly income on notional basis cannot be considered less than
given under minimum payment of Wages Act in terms of notification dated
26/10/2017 issued by Government of Jammu and Kashmir Labour and Employment
Department wherein skilled worker as per minimum Wages Act will be given wages
at the rate of Rs. 350/- per day, and therefore, learned Tribunal calculated the initial
monthly salary of petitioner as Rs.
15,000/- per month upon which annual income was calculated as Rs 1,80,000/-, and taking into
consideration 40% of the disability suffered by the petitioner and applying the ratio of the judgment
of Pranay Sethi and Ors. (2017) 13 SCALE 12 and as the petitioner was below 40 years of age, the
total annual loss of income was calculated at Rs. 2,52,000/-. Learned counsel for appellant while
relying upon the judgments, viz;
"S.R Krishna Murthy v New India Assurance Co Ltd. Reported in 2019 ACJ 1291" and
"Kajal v Jagdish" reported in 2020 AIR (SC) 776" has vehemently argued, that even
in case of injured/claimant who were pursuing studies as in the cases (supra)
Hon(cid:128)ble Supreme Court assessed the notional income at Rs. 5,000/- or at Rs. 4846/-
P.M for assessing the compensation on the head "loss of future income".
In AIR 2019 Supreme Court 5625 (Appellants: M.R.Krishna Murthi Vs.Respondent: The New India
Assurance Co.Ltd and Ors), Hon(cid:128)ble Supreme Court while assessing the monthly income of a
student age 18 years and studying in Modern School Delhi at the time of accident on 26-05-1988
whereby his entire leg got crushed, in Para 25 & 26 held as under:
25. From the judgment of the MACT, we find that, on this aspect, it has followed
judgment of Arun Sondhi v. Delhi Transport Corporation, MANDU/DE/0339/2001:
(2201) ACJ 1779 and has awarded the compensation at Rs. 408000/-. It has also
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/57625998/ 7
National Insurance Company Ltd. ... vs Vishal Kumar Son Of Madan Lal on 16 June, 2023
added Rs.
75000/- on account of 40% permanent disability on the ground that apart from resulting in loss of
income, it has severe impact on the life of the Appellant as a whole. The figure of Rs. 408000/- is
calculated in the following manner:
42. Learned counsel for Petitioner has argued at length that a substantial amount of
compensation is required to be awarded to the Petitioner on account of loss of
earning capacity in future. It has been stated that on account of injuries suffered in
the accident the income of the Petitioner has reduced to 60% of what he could have
earned otherwise. I consider that this argument raised by learned counsel for the
Petitioner cannot be accepted. The Petitioner was student at the time of accident. He
started his career after around 5 years of accident.
I do not say that the injuries did not have an adverse impact on the Petitioner, but to quantify the
same in the manner claimed by the Petitioner may not be just. In this regard, I consider that the
guidance can be taken from the case of Arun Sondhi v. Delhi Transport Corporation,
MANU/DE/0339/2001 : 2001 ACJ 1779. In this case, the injured was a student of 21 years and he
had suffered disability of 100%. In L.P.A the loss of future earning was assessed at Rs. 5000/- p.m.
and after adopting multiplier of 16 compensation of Rs. 1080000/- was allowed. If the same
principle is adopted and future earning is taken at Rs. 5000/- p.m. and the disability of 40%, the
monthly loss of income comes to Rs. 2000/- p.m. or Rs. 24000/- p.a. It is settled proposition that in
the case of permanent disability the multiplier is to be adopted according to the age at the time of
trial. In this case adopting this principle if the multiplier of 17 is adopted the compensation on
account of loss of future income comes to Rs. 4,08,000/-.
26. As can be seen from the above, loss of future earning is assessed at Rs.2,000/- per month or
Rs.24,000/- per annum. In the process, the MACT has not considered future prospects having
regard to the relevant facts pointed out above which should have been taken into consideration. At
the same time, it is the functional disability which has to be kept in mind. Though, not very
seriously, the functional capacity has been impaired because of the disability suffered by the
appellant as the appellant cannot run around like other young advocates of his age. Going by the
overall circumstances, we are of the opinion that in case of the appellant, loss of future earning can
be fixed at Rs.5,000/- per month i.e. Rs.60,000/- per annum on which multiplier of 18 is to be
applied. Calculated in this manner, the loss future earning comes to Rs.10,80,000/-. The appellant,
thus, would be paid another sum of Rs.6,54,000/- under this head along with interest as awarded by
the Court below. We may place on record the statement of Mr. Arun Mohan that the appellant has
volunteered to give this amount to any Government or public charitable organization working
towards road safety. We appreciate this gesture of the appellant. We leave it to the appellant to
donate the amount to any particular organization of his choice. Alternatively, it can also be given for
MAMC project by the appellant. Choice would entirely be that the appellant.
Ratio of the judgment (supra) settles the legal controversy at rest that in case of injured student the
future earning is to be assessed at Rs. 5000 per month.

National Insurance Company Ltd. ... vs Vishal Kumar Son Of Madan Lal on 16 June, 2023
In AIR 2020 Supreme Court 776 (Kajal Vs. Jagdish Chand and Ors), Hon(cid:128)ble Supreme Court while
fixing the monthly income of young child/girl of 12 years as Rs. 4846/- P.M as per minimum wages
of a skilled workman who suffered grievous injury in Para 20 of the judgment held as under.
20. Both the courts below have held that since the girl was a young child of 12 years only notional
income of Rs.15,000/ per annum can be taken into consideration. We do not think this is a proper
way of assessing the future loss of income. This young girl after studying could have worked and
would have earned much more than Rs.15,000/ per annum. Each case has to be decided on its own
evidence but taking notional income to be Rs.15,000/ per annum is not at all justified. The appellant
has placed before us material to show that the minimum wages payable to a skilled workman is
Rs.4846/ per month. In our opinion this would be the minimum amount which she would have
earned on becoming a major. Adding 40% for the future prospects, it works to be Rs.6784.40/ per
month, i.e., 81,412.80 per annum. Applying the multiplier of 18 it works out to Rs.14,65,430.40,
which is rounded off to Rs.14,66,000/.
Ratio of the judgment (supra) further makes the legal propositions manifestly clear, that in case of
child/student the notional income of Rs. 15000/-P.A is not a proper way of assessing the future loss
of income of the injured/claimant, and the monthly future loss of income has to be assessed on the
minimum wages payable to a skilled workman per month with addition of 40% of monthly income
for future prospects. Ratios of the judgments (supra) squarely apply to the facts of the case in hand.
In the case in hand, the monthly income of respondent No. 1 (petitioner before the Tribunal) has to
be fixed at Rs. 5,000/- P.M. Adding 40% of the monthly income for the future prospects of the
claimant/respondent No. 1/petitioner, it works out to be Rs. 5,000+Rs. 2000(40% of the monthly
income of Rs. 5000/-)= Rs. 7000/- per month i.e. Rs 84000 per annum (7000x12). Applying
multiplier of 18 on the age of the petitioner at the time of accident as 18/19 years, the total future
loss of income of the respondent No. 1 (petitioner/claimant) works out to Rs. 84000x18=Rs
15,12,000/-.
(II) MEDICAL EXPENSES:
As per the impugned judgment of the learned Tribunal, petitioner has claimed an amount of Rs.
5,00,000/- as medical expenses, but he has placed on record the medical bills in the sum of Rs.
85,534/-. Nothing has been placed on record by respondent No. 1 (claimant) which could prove the
expenses incurred by him for transport charges and money spent for special diet. The respondent
No. 1, therefore, is entitled only to the medical expenses incurred by him in the sum of Rs. 85,534/-.
(B) N O N -P E C U N I A R Y D A M A G E S: -
Non-pecuniary damages can be classified under the following heads:-
(I) Damages for mental & physical shock, pain, sufferings already suffered or likely to

National Insurance Company Ltd. ... vs Vishal Kumar Son Of Madan Lal on 16 June, 2023
It is profitable to reiterate here, that on account of accident met by respondent 1 on 27.12.2016 with
offending vehicle Maruti car Ritz bearing registration No. JK21-9839, he suffered post traumatic
stiffness of right knee with fibrous alkalosis with common perennial palsy of the right lower limb
with permanent disability of 40%. Respondent No. 1 by the vehicular accident has suffered mental
shock, physical pain and sufferings already and even throughout his life he is likely to suffer same
mental shock, physical pain and sufferings in future, and therefore, needs to be compensated for the
said injuries. Applying the guess work and having sympathy linked with the nature of disablement
suffered by respondent No. 1, Rs. 40,000/- (Forty thousand) is awarded as compensation on
account of mental and physical shock, pain and sufferings to respondent No. 1.
(II) Damages to compensate for loss of amenities of life: -
Respondent No. 1 (petitioner/claimant) and PW Dr. Kanav Padah have unequivocally
put forth, cogent, trustworthy, inspiring and credible evidence that the petitioner by
the vehicular accident on 27.12.2016 has suffered grievous injuries and the degree of
disability is 40% which has lowered the working capacity of the petitioner. Human
life is valuable, and therefore, pleasantness in life is the desire and dream of every
individual. Every human being desires to spend his life free from inconvenience,
hardships, discomfort, disappointment, frustration and mental stress. Pleasure of life
is the most invaluable asset of a human being. While awarding compensation to the
claimant/petitioner/respondent No. 1 for loss of amenities and pleasure of life, the
Tribunal has to keep in view the long span of the life the claimant has to go through
as a disabled person depending upon others for his sustenance.
In the case law of Oriental Insurance Company Vs. Mukhteshwar Chib, [2008 (ii) SLJ
709], Hon(cid:128)ble Mr Justice J.P Singh [His Lordships the then was Hon(cid:128)ble Judge of
J&K High Court] while appreciating the role of a tribunal or Court to fix the amount
of compensation in cases of accident, at page 713, in para 22 held as under:
Para 22 "It was further held by Hon(cid:128)ble Supreme Court of India that whenever a
Tribunal or a Court is to fix the amount of compensation in cases of accident, it
involves some guess work, some hypothetical consideration and some amount of
sympathy linked with the nature of the disability causes. All these elements one,
however, required to be viewed with objective standards." The test of law and the
ratio of the judgment (supra) fully applies to the facts of the case in hand. Applying
the guess work, having sympathy linked with the nature of permanent disablement of
40% suffered by respondent No. 1 (petitioner) which has rendered whole of the life of
respondent No. 1 unpleasant, an amount of Rs. 40,000/- (Forty thousand) is further
awarded to respondent No. 1 (petitioner before the Tribunal) as compensation for
loss of amenities and pleasure of his life. It is pertinent to mention here, that in
regard to issue No. 2, the amount of compensation under the heads "pain and
sufferings and "loss of amenities of life" granted by the learned Tribunal in the sum of
Rs. 40,000/- each being to my mind is not on higher side, the finding of the learned
Tribunal to the said extent is accordingly upheld.

This issue is to the effect, "Whether the offending vehicle was being driven at the time
of accident in contravention of terms and conditions of insurance policy and the
driver was not holding a valid driving license at the time of accident, as such, the
respondent insurance company is not liable to pay compensation to the petitioner? ...
OPR-3 Onus of proof of this issue lies on appellant (respondent No.3 before the
Tribunal). Despite opportunities offered to the respondent No. 3, no evidence has
been led to prove issue No. 3. Therefore, issue no 3 has been rightly decided by the
Tribunal against appellant (respondent No.3) and in favour of respondent No. 1
(petitioner before the Tribunal). I, therefore, do not find any reason to upset the
finding rendered by the Tribunal in regard to issue No. 3 which stands affirmed.
