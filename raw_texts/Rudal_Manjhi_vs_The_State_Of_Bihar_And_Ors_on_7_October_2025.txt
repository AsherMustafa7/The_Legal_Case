Patna High Court CWJC No.23568 of 2012 dt.15-10-2025
2/25
Man Inquiry Committee of Hon'ble Mr Justice Uday Sinha in
Case no.218 of 2010 (arising out of LPA no. 694 of 2010)
wherein it was held that the appointment of the petitioner was
illegal and the order of termination was valid. Further prayer has
been made for quashing the order of termination contained in
memo no. 227 dated 11.3.2005 issued on the orders of the
District Magistrate, Siwan under the signature of Civil Surgeon-
cum-Chief Medical Officer, Siwan.
3. The case of the petitioner in brief is that he
belongs to the Scheduled Caste category and is a holder of a
valid driving license bearing no. 1769/85 which has been
renewed from time to time. Pursuant to an advertisement put up
on the notice board in the office of the Civil Surgeon-cum-Chief
Medical Officer, Siwan (respondent no.5), the petitioner applied
for appointment and by order dated 19.8.1989 was appointed on
a temporary basis on the sanctioned and vacant post of a Jeep
driver. The appointment had taken place as a result of a driving
test and interview by a Selection Committee and the petitioner
was posted at Primary Health Centre, Hussainganj, Siwan.
4. The respondents came out with an order dated
11.3.2005
terminating the petitioner with immediate effect which was challenged by filing CWJC no. 4920 of
2005. The Patna High Court CWJC No.23568 of 2012 dt.15-10-2025 writ application filed by the
petitioner was disposed of by order dated 26.6.2006 in a batch of 820 writ applications being LPA
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88486758/ 2
Rudal Manjhi vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 7 October, 2025
no. 946 of 2003 and others (State of Bihar versus Purendra Sulan Kit); 2006 (3) PLJR 386 directing
the respondent authorities of the Health Department, Government of Bihar to reconsider the case of
all the affected employees in view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of State
of Karnataka versus Uma Devi [2006 (2) PLJR (SC) 363] as to which of the employees are fit for
regularization in terms of paragraph no. 44 of the said judgment.
5. The matter was considered by a 5 Member Committee which in its inquiry report dated 10.9.2007
opined with respect to the case of the petitioner at serial no. 215 that the petitioner's appointment is
illegal on the ground that he has been regularised from daily wages in 1989 without following the
procedure.
6. The petitioner challenged the order of termination on the basis of a report submitted by the 5
Man Committee by filing CWJC no. 5044 of 2008 which was heard with the batch of cases being
CWJC no.6575 of 2009 and analogous cases (Om Prakash versus the State of Bihar). By judgment
dated 6.10.2009 (Annexure-22) the learned Single Patna High Court CWJC No.23568 of 2012
dt.15-10-2025 Judge was pleased to quash the order of termination and ordered for reinstatement of
the petitioner on the post that he was working with all consequential benefits.
7. The State of Bihar preferred an appeal being State of Bihar versus Sohan Roy [2010 (2) PLJR 397]
which along with a batch of cases was disposed of by a common judgment dated 11.2.2010
constituting a One Man Committee of Hon'ble Mr. Justice Uday Sinha, a retired Judge of this Court
to recommend the various facets of nature of appointments given to the writ petitioners with a view
to adjudicate the legality of their appointments and continuance in service.
8. The State of Bihar preferred LPA no. 694 of 2010 in the case of the petitioner herein and the same
was disposed of in terms of the Division Bench judgment in the case of State of Bihar versus Sohan
Roy (supra). It was pursuant thereto that the one man inquiry committee having heard the
petitioner and the respondents passed the judgment dated 20.7.2011 holding the appointment of the
petitioner to be illegal and the order of his termination to be valid. It is against this order as also the
order of termination dated 11.3.2005 that the present application has been filed.
9. It is submitted by learned counsel for the Patna High Court CWJC No.23568 of 2012
dt.15-10-2025 petitioner that the petitioner was appointed pursuant to an application filed by him in
response to an advertisement displayed on the notice board in the office of the Civil Surgeon- cum-
Chief Medical Officer, Siwan. It was submitted in reference to the orders brought on record as
Annexure-28 series that the LPAs filed by the State in several cases have been dismissed after the
matters had been remanded by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. Referring to paragraph no. 8(j) in the
case of State of Bihar versus Sohan Roy (supra) it is submitted that liberty had been granted by this
Court to demonstrate before the one man committee that the petitioner's case was similar to those
persons who had been retained or reinstated in service, however, the learned Committee did not
take the same into consideration. It was further submitted that the so called 5 man committee report
was not even signed by all the 5 members and by order dated 20.9.2007 (Annexure-21) ninety one
persons had been regularised.

Rudal Manjhi vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 7 October, 2025
10. In response, it was submitted by learned counsel for the respondents that so far as the petitioner
is concerned, it is clear from the records of the case that there was no advertisement at the time of
his appointment, no selection committee was constituted, no roster was followed nor did the Patna
High Court CWJC No.23568 of 2012 dt.15-10-2025 so called appointment take place following any
rules. It was submitted that it is for this reason that no notice alleged to have been put up on the
board in the office of the Civil Surgeon-cum- Chief Medical Officer has been brought on record.
Further in reference to the initial order of appointment it is submitted that the same was pursuant
to an application filed by the petitioner, a procedure not known to law. The appointment not having
been done on the recommendation of a Selection Committee and being contrary to the Rules
contained in Circular no. 16441 dated 3.12.1980 the process to weed out illegal appointments was
initiated pursuant to the order dated 19.6.1999 of the Chief Secretary ie before the petitioner had
completed 10 years of service. In view of these facts together with the so called appointment of the
petitioner being purely temporary, the petitioner was terminated vide order dated 11.3.2005.
11. It was further submitted by learned counsel for the respondents that though the order of
termination of the petitioner was set aside by this Court by order dated 6.10.2009 (Annexure-2)
passed in CWJC no. 6575 of 2009 and analogous cases, however, the said order of the learned Single
Judge was nullified by the Division Bench of this Court in State of Bihar versus Sohan Roy (supra).
LPA no. 694 of 2010 preferred by Patna High Court CWJC No.23568 of 2012 dt.15-10-2025 State of
Bihar in the case of the petitioner was also disposed of in terms of State of Bihar versus Sohan Roy
(supra).
12. Learned counsel for the respondents further submitted that as directed by the Division Bench in
State of Bihar versus Sohan Roy (supra) the petitioner as also the respondents appeared before the
one man committee of Hon'ble Mr. Justice Uday Sinha who having considered the case of the
parties, by his judgment dated 20.7.2011 was pleased to hold the appointment of the petitioner to be
illegal and further held the termination to be valid. It is thus submitted by learned counsel for the
respondents that there being no dispute with respect to the facts that there was no advertisement at
the time of appointment of the petitioner, no evidence of any notice having been put up on the
notice board in the office of the Civil Surgeon, no selection committee having been constituted for
the process of selection, neither any roster nor any rules having been followed, the order of
termination of the petitioner is clearly not valid. There is no illegality in the order impugned and
thus the instant application be dismissed.
13. Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned counsel for the State of Bihar. Perused the
material on record.
Patna High Court CWJC No.23568 of 2012 dt.15-10-2025
14. The facts in brief as per the petitioner's case are that pursuant to an advertisement displayed on
the notice board in the office of the Civil Surgeon-cum-Chief Medical Officer the petitioner applied
for appointment on the post of Jeep driver and after a driving test and interview having been
conducted by a Selection Committee, he was selected on the sanctioned and vacant post of Jeep
driver vide order no. 1932 dated 19.8.1989 issued under the signature of the Civil
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88486758/ 4
Rudal Manjhi vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 7 October, 2025
Surgeon-cum-Chief Medical Officer, Siwan.
15. It would be relevant to observe here itself that perusal of the said order/letter would show that it
neither talks of any advertisement nor any notice having been put up on the notice board nor any
process of selection having been carried out but only mentions about the appointment having been
made on a purely temporary basis on an application having been filed by the petitioner. It further
states that the appointment/service which is purely temporary may be brought to an end anytime
without any prior notice.
16. It further transpires that pursuant to an order dated 19.6.1999 of the Chief Secretary the
respondents having taken up the initiative to weed out illegal appointments, on the orders of the
District Magistrate, finding the appointment of the Patna High Court CWJC No.23568 of 2012
dt.15-10-2025 petitioner to be irregular on the ground that no advertisement had been published, no
roster clearance had been followed and that pursuant to the order contained in letter 1.1.1986 of the
Personnel and Administrative Reforms Department, Government of Bihar, the appointment on
daily wages could not have been made, the petitioner was terminated vide order dated 11.3.2005
(Annexure-14) passed by the Civil Surgeon-cum- Chief Medical Officer,Siwan on the orders of the
District Magistrate.
17. The said order of termination was challenged by the petitioner by filing CWJC no. 4920 of 2005
which was allowed by a Division Bench of this Court by judgment dated 26.6.2006 in State of Bihar
and others versus Purandara Sulan Kit (supra). The relevant paragraph nos. 10, 11 and 12 of the
judgment are reproduced herein below for ready reference:-
"10. All the Letters Patent Appeals whether preferred by the State or by affected
employees and all the Writ Petitions preferred by the affected employees are hereby
disposed of by this common judgment and order with a direction to the authorities of
the Health Department, Government of Bihar to reconsider the cases of all the
affected employees with a view to find out on the basis of relevant facts and law as
settled by the Constitution Bench in the case of Patna High Court CWJC No.23568 of
2012 dt.15-10-2025 Secretary, State of Karnataka vs. Uma Devi (supra) as to which of
such affected employees are fit for regularisation in terms of that judgment,
particularly in terms of paragraph 44 of the judgment. Such exercise should be
completed within a period of six months from today. If for any good reason, the time
period is required to be extended then the respondent State must file an application
for that purpose and seek extension from this Court. Till the process is completed, the
State of Bihar and its authorities shall maintain status quo in respect of services of
the affected employees as existing on date. The status quo shall get revised by the
orders that may be passed by the authorities in respect of affected employees as a
result of the exercise to be undertaken by them and their final decision in the light of
this judgment and order.
11. Before parting with this judgment and order, it is considered relevant to observe
that recently a writ petition bearing CWJC No. 3349 of 2000 (Yogendra Singh & Ors.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88486758/ 5
Rudal Manjhi vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 7 October, 2025
vs. The State of Bihar & Ors.) was disposed of by judgment dated 9.5.2006 rendered
by one of us, Shiva Kirti Singh, J. in which reliance was placed upon the aforesaid
Constitution Bench judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Secretary, State of
Karnataka vs. Uma Devi for directing the State Government to consider the cases of
petitioners of that case for regularisation as a one time Patna High Court CWJC
No.23568 of 2012 dt.15-10-2025 measure, if their cases meet the requirements laid
down in the aforesaid judgment. As observed in that judgment, here also it is clarified
that the authorities of Health Department, Government of Bihar while considering
the cases of affected employees in these cases, may consider and take decision as per
law in respect of similarly situated other employees of the Department, if any, and for
that category of similar situated employees, the Department may issue public notice
etc. if it is so advised. But they must be conscious of the judgment of the Apex Court,
as noticed above, that the exercise of regularisation is only a one time measure for the
whole Department and no such further exercise will be permissible after the one time
measure is resorted to and completed within a reasonable period.
Thereafter, the vacancies must be filled up as per requirement of the Department in regular manner
as per direction of the Apex Court.
12. All the matters shall stand disposed of. There shall be no order as to costs."
18. Pursuant to the direction of this Court the case of the petitioner was examined by a committee of
the respondents who came to the conclusion that the appointment of the petitioner is illegal, the
regularisation from daily wages in Patna High Court CWJC No.23568 of 2012 dt.15-10-2025 1989
having been done without following the procedure. It would also be relevant to mention that the
aforesaid Division Bench judgment dated 26.6.2006 (Annexure-16) in LPA no. 946 of 2003 and
analogous cases which also disposed of the writ application filed by the petitioner directing the State
Government to consider the case of the petitioners for regularisation as a one time measure was not
challenged by the petitioner in any appeal and attained finality. By this judgment while the order of
termination of the petitioner(s) were not set aside, the respondents were directed and required to
consider as to whether the case of the petitioner(s) was fit for regularisation in terms of the
judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Secretary versus State of Karnataka versus
Uma Devi (supra). The respondents examined the case of the petitioner and the Committee
constituted came to the conclusion that on account of regularisation from daily wage in 1989
without following the procedure the appointment of the petitioner was illegal.
19. The petitioner challenged the said order of the 5 Men Committee in CWJC no. 5044 of 2008
which came to be allowed by judgment dated 6.10.2009 (Annexure-22) in CWJC no. 6575 of 2009
and analogous cases whereby the learned Patna High Court CWJC No.23568 of 2012 dt.15-10-2025
Single Judge quashed the termination orders directing for reinstatement of the petitioner and others
with effect from the date of their termination with all consequential benefits.
20. A number of appeals were preferred by the State of Bihar, LPA no. 694 of 2010 being in the case
of the petitioner herein. The batch of cases were disposed of vide order dated 11.2.2010 passed in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88486758/ 6
Rudal Manjhi vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 7 October, 2025
State of Bihar versus Sohan Roy(supra). Relevant part of the judgment is reproduced herein below
for ready reference:-
"7........................................When debate was on, certain suggestions and counter
suggestions cropped up and eventually a consensus was arrived at, which we also find
it to be appropriate, apposite and apt in existing factual matrix.
8. Regard being had to the concession given by Mr. P.K. Shahi, learned Advocate
General after obtaining instructions from the competent authorities of the State and
the concession given by the learned counsel for the respondents- writ petitioners, we
proceed to record the terms and conditions which would form spine of the present
order. The terms and conditions in seriatim are as follows:-
(a) The directions contained in the order passed by the learned Single Judge against
Patna High Court CWJC No.23568 of 2012 dt.15-10-2025 which the present appeals
are prefered would stand nullified.
(b) A one man committee of Hon'ble Mr. Justice Uday Sinha, a retired Judge of this
Court shall look into the various facets of nature of appointments that were given to
the writ petitioners with a view to adjudicate the legality of their appointments and
continuance in service. ...................................................
(j) It would also be open to the employee-
writ petitioners to demonstrate and
establish before the said one man
committee that his/her case is similar to those of the persons who have been retained
and/or reinstated in service in the wake of the report of the screening committee
headed by the Director-in-Chief of Health Department constituted in terms of the
earlier directions of this court in the order dated 26.6.2006 in L.P.A. No. of 946 of
2003 (State of Bihar vs. Purendra Sulan Kit) and its analogous cases, reported in
2006(3) PLJR 386.
....................................................
9. The appeals are accordingly disposed of on the aforesaid agreed terms."
21. So far as the appeal (LPA no. 694 of 2010) filed by the State of Bihar in the case of petitioner
herein is concerned, the same was disposed of by order 16.4.2010 in the Patna High Court CWJC
No.23568 of 2012 dt.15-10-2025 following terms:
"Admit.
As all the parties have been represented, no further notice need be issued.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88486758/ 7
Rudal Manjhi vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 7 October, 2025
On consent of learned counsel for the parties, the appeal is finally heard.
It is submitted at the Bar that the controversies raised in the present appeal are
covered by the decision rendered in L.P.A. No. 1623 of 2009 and other connected
matter decided on 11.2.2010.
Recording such concession the appeal stands disposed of. There shall be no order as
to costs.
A free copy of the order be handed over to Mr. A.K.Chongdar, learned counsel for the
State to communicate it to the Chairman of the Committee."
22. Thereafter as directed by this Court the petitioner approached the one man committee of
Hon'ble Mr Justice Uday Sinha who having considered the case of the parties was pleased to decide
the same by judgment dated 20.7.2011 in Case no. 218 of 2010 (Rudal Manjhi versus State of Bihar
and others).
23. A bare perusal of the order would show that the learned Committee took note of the facts that
the appointment of the petitioner did not have support of any selection committee Patna High Court
CWJC No.23568 of 2012 dt.15-10-2025 recommendation, the rules of appointment contained in
circular no.16441 dated 3.12.1980 had not been followed, steps had been taken by the respondents
to weed out the illegal appointees prior to the petitioner having completed 10 years in service and
the letter of appointment of the petitioner clearly spelt out that his appointment was purely adhoc.
The committee was of the opinion that for all these reasons the appointment could not be termed as
irregular but must be held to be illegal and the petitioner could not be given the benefit of the
directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of State of Karnataka versus Uma Devi (supra).
24. Besides the above, the Committee of Hon'ble Mr. Justice Uday Sinha also referred to and relied
upon the judgments of the order of Supreme Court in the case of Md. Asif versus State of Bihar
[(2010) 5 SCC 475] and State of U.P. versus Desh Raj [(2007) 1 SCC 257].
25. So far as the case of the petitioner herein is concerned, from the letter of appointment or first
engagement of the petitioner on 19.8.1989 (Annexure-4) it would clearly be evident that the same
had been made pursuant to an application filed by the petitioner. The letter does not speak of any
advertisement nor any process of selection having been carried Patna High Court CWJC No.23568
of 2012 dt.15-10-2025 out pursuant to which the said appointment had been made. It is for this
reason that the letter clearly states that the appointment is purely temporary and the same can be
brought to an end at anytime without any notice.
26. It would further transpire that stating the aforesaid shortcomings/illegalities of there being no
advertisement, no roster clearance and the directions contained in the letter dated 1.1.1986 of the
Personnel and Administrative Reforms Department that no further appointment on daily wage can
be made not having been followed the respondents came out with an order dated 11.3.2005
terminating the petitioner from service.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88486758/ 8
Rudal Manjhi vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 7 October, 2025
27. On the order of termination having been challenged by the petitioner in CWJC no.4920 of 2005
the same came to be decided in a batch of cases by order dated 26.6.2006 (Annexure-16) in State of
Bihar versus Purendra Sulan Kit (supra). This judgment of the learned Division Bench did not did
not set aside the order of termination of the petitioner but only disposed of the cases/letters patent
appeals/writ petitions with the directions to the respondent Health Department to consider whether
the case of the affected employees (including that of the petitioner herein) was fit for regularisation
in terms Patna High Court CWJC No.23568 of 2012 dt.15-10-2025 of the judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in State of Karnataka versus Uma Devi (supra).
28. The Committee of the respondents found the appointment of the petitioner to be illegal for good
reasons. Though the order of the Committee was set aside by the learned Single Judge in a batch of
cases by judgment dated 6.10.2009 (Annexure-22) in paragraph no.8 of the appeal preferred in the
case of State of Bihar versus Sohan Roy (supra) the learned Division Bench of this Court held that
the order passed by the learned Single Judge would stand nullified. The LPA 694 of 2010 preferred
by the State of Bihar in the case of the petitioner also stood disposed of in terms of the aforesaid
judgment in State of Bihar versus Sohan Roy (supra).
29. From the facts stated as also the discussions made herein above it would clearly be evident that
so far as the order of termination of the petitioner is concerned, the same was not interfered with by
this Court and only a direction was given to the respondents to examine as to whether the case of the
petitioner was fit for regularisation in terms of the judgment in the case of State of Karnataka versus
Uma Devi (supra).
30. At this stage, it would be relevant to consider the two judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court
in the case of Patna High Court CWJC No.23568 of 2012 dt.15-10-2025 a State of U.P. versus Desh
Raj (supra) and Md. Ashif versus State of Bihar (supra) referred to by the one man committee in the
judgment impugned.
31. In the case of State of U.P. versus Desh Raj (supra) the the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as
follows:
"10. The observations made in the said paragraph must be read in the light of the
observations made in paras 15 and 16 of the judgment. The Constitution Bench
referred to the decisions of this Court in State of Mysore v. S.V. Narayanappa², R.N.
Nanjundappa v. T. Thimmiah³ and B.Ν. Nagarajan v. State of Karnataka. B.N.
Nagarajan is a decision rendered by a three-Judge Bench of this Court in which it has
clearly been held that the regularisation does not mean permanence. A distinction
has clearly been made in those decisions between "irregularity" and "illegality".
An appointment which was made throwing all constitutional obligations and statutory rules to the
winds would render the same illegal whereas irregularity presupposes substantial compliance with
the rules.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88486758/ 9
Rudal Manjhi vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 7 October, 2025
11. Distinction between irregularity and illegality is explicit. It has been so pointed out in National
Fertilizers Ltd. v. Somvir Singh in the following terms: (SCC pp. 500-01, paras 23-25) "23. The
contention of the learned Patna High Court CWJC No.23568 of 2012 dt.15-10-2025 counsel
appearing on behalf of the respondents that the appointments were irregular and not illegal, cannot
be accepted for more than one reason. They were appointed only on the basis of their applications.
The Recruitment Rules were not followed. Even the Selection Committee had not been properly
constituted. In view of the ban on employment, no recruitment was permissible in law. The
reservation policy adopted by the appellant had not been maintained. Even cases of minorities had
not been given due consideration.
24. The Constitution Bench thought of directing regularisation of the services only of those
employees whose appointments were irregular as explained in State of Mysore v. S.V.
Narayanappa², R.N. Nanjundappa v. T. Thimmiah³ and B.N. Nagarajan v. State of Karnataka
wherein this Court observed: [Umadevi (3) case¹, SCC p. 24, para16] '16. In B.N. Nagarajan v. State
of Karnataka this Court clearly held that the words 'regular' or 'regularisation' do not connote
permanence and cannot be construed so as to convey an idea of the nature of tenure of
appointments. They are terms calculated to condone any procedural irregularities and are meant to
cure only Patna High Court CWJC No.23568 of 2012 dt.15-10-2025 such defects as are attributable
to methodology followed in making the appointments.'
25. Judged by the standards laid down by this Court in the aforementioned decisions, the
appointments of the respondents are illegal. They do not, thus, have any legal right to continue in
service."
(Emphasis supplied)
32. In the case of Md. Asif versus State of Bihar (supra) the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as follows:
"9. The law regarding regularisation of employees was on a comprehensive review
authoritatively declared by a Constitution Bench of this Court in State of Karnataka v.
Umadevi (3)6. This Court in that case drew a distinction between an irregularity and
an illegality in the making of an appointment and declared that where the due
process of appointment has been deviated from, the Court can regularise the same. In
cases where the process itself is completely violative of the constitutional scheme
underlying public employment and no procedure has been followed while granting
such appointments the Court cannot allow such an illegality to continue irrespective
of the length of time for which it has continued. Relying upon the decision of this
Court in Ashwani Kumar case³ Patna High Court CWJC No.23568 of 2012
dt.15-10-2025 this Court in Umadevi (3) case6 observed: (SCC pp. 36-37, para43 )
"43. Thus, it is clear that adherence to the rule of equality in public employment is a
basic feature of our Constitution and since the rule of law is the core of our
Constitution, a court would certainly be disabled from passing an order upholding a
violation of Article 14 or in ordering the overlooking of the need to comply with the
requirements of Article 14 read with Article 16 of the Constitution. Therefore,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88486758/ 10
Rudal Manjhi vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 7 October, 2025
consistent with the scheme for public employment, this Court while laying down the
law, has necessarily to hold that unless the appointment is in terms of the relevant
rules and after a proper competition among qualified persons, the same would not
confer any right on the appointee. If it is a contractual appointment, the appointment
comes to an end at the end of the contract, if it were an engagement or appointment
on daily wages or casual basis, the same would come to an end when it is
discontinued.
Similarly, a temporary employee could not claim to be made permanent on the expiry of his term of
appointment. It has also to be clarified that merely because a temporary employee or a casual wage
worker is Patna High Court CWJC No.23568 of 2012 dt.15-10-2025 continued for a time beyond the
term of his appointment, he would not be entitled to be absorbed in regular service or made
permanent, merely on the strength of such continuance, if the original appointment was not made
by following a due process of selection as envisaged by the relevant rules. It is not open to the court
to prevent regular recruitment at the instance of temporary employees whose period of employment
has come to an end or of ad hoc employees who by the very nature of their appointment, do not
acquire any right. The High Courts acting under Article 226 of the Constitution, should not
ordinarily issue directions for absorption, regularisation, or permanent continuance unless the
recruitment itself was made regularly and in terms of the constitutional scheme.
Merely because an employee had continued under cover of an order of the court, which, we have
described as 'litigious employment' in the earlier part of the judgment, he would not be entitled to
any right to be absorbed or made permanent in the service. In fact, in such cases, the High Court
may not be justified in issuing interim directions, since, after all, if ultimately the employee
approaching it is found entitled to relief,it Patna High Court CWJC No.23568 of 2012 dt.15-10-2025
may be possible for it to mould the relief in such a manner that ultimately no prejudice will be
caused to him, whereas an interim direction to continue his employment would hold up the regular
procedure for selection or impose on the State the burden of paying an employee who is really not
required. The courts must be careful in ensuring that they do not interfere unduly with the economic
arrangement of its affairs by the State or its instrumentalities or lend themselves the instruments to
facilitate the by passing of the constitutional and statutory mandates." (Emphasis supplied)
33. Having heard learned counsels for the parties, in the facts and circumstances stated herein
above, the appointment of the petitioner having been made without advertisement, without any
selection committee constituted and no roster nor any Rules having been followed, the petitioner
was rightly terminated from service also for the reason that from the letter of appointment of the
petitioner it is clear that his engagement was purely temporary/adhoc in nature.
34. In the facts of the case the Court finds no illegality in the order impugned and no merit in the
case of the writ petitioner.
