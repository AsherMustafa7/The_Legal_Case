arising out of Case Crime No-381/2007, under section 376/511, 323, 504 I.P.C. & 3(1) (xii) SC/ST
Act of P.S.- Sirsiya, District Shravasti.
12. It is stated that the second petition i.e. Application U/S No.8332 of 2023 is based on the facts
that parties have settled the dispute, which in fact was a petty dispute and the said dispute was
informed to the concerned police station and taking benefit of criminal cases pending against the
applicants, the police officer with ulterior motive lodged the FIR aforesaid in the said sections.
13. It is further stated that immediately after coming to know about the FIR registered as Case
Crime No.0381 of 2007 dated 07.10.2007, the informant submitted an application dated 19.11.2007
before the Superintendent of Police, Shravasti and an affidavit dated 11.10.2007 before the D.I.G.,
Devi Patan, Gonda and and a conjoint perusal of the same would indicate that the entire story of the
prosecution is completely false as according to these documents i.e. application and affidavit of the
informant, no such incident took place on 01.10.2007. The affidavit of the informant indicates that
on plane paper thumb impression of the informant was taken and with ulterior motive on the same
a false story was narrated to attract the offence indicated in the FIR, which lodged on the basis of the
same.
14. It is further stated that the statement of victim was not recorded in terms of Section 164 Cr.P.C.
