3. According to fardbeyan recorded on 16.12.2013 at Uday Narain Nursing Home, the informant
stated that on 15.12.2013, he was sitting in the rented premise of landlord Sachida Nand Singh. The
damaged garage which was causing inconvenience in movement of the vehicles was being repaired
and slop was being made by the labourers. Wife of Sachida Nand Singh, namely, Veena Devi was
monitoring the work. At the same time, the neighbours, who are petitioners herein, came thereat
and started abuse and thereafter they caught Veena Devi. Then the informant and his elder brother
Rajesh Kumar ran for rescue. Thereafter, petitioner Navin thrashed to Rajesh Kumar and petitioner
Sonu and Nigam caught the informant and on the order of Navin, Dr. Manish Shankar assaulted
with Khanti (a weapon of cutting) at the head of the informant causing injury at the face and nose.
After investigation, the police submitted charge sheet and cognizance was taken accordingly.
4. The challenge is on the ground that the criminal proceeding is abuse of the process of the Court as
the same has been lodged, just to pressurize in civil dispute between the parties.
5. Submission is that Title Suit No. 668 of 2013 is going on between Devnagar Devi, wife of Surya
Narain Thakur versus Vina Devi, wife of Sachida Nand Singh. Further contention is that the
informant had got treatment at the Advanced Neuro Diagnostic Patna High Court CR. MISC.
No.3437 of 2016 dt.24-07-2019 Centre where he disclosed that he sustained injury by fall from
moving bike. The injury report is at Annexure-3.
6. Learned counsel for the opposite party no. 2 submits that opposite party has no knowledge of the
said injury report, rather the same appears to be a fabricated one. The petitioners never produced
the same before the police during investigation of the case so that the police could have investigated
the genuineness of the same, rather the case diary would reveal that real injury report of treatment
of the informant is already there. Only pendency of civil suit would not absolve the petitioners from
criminal liability, if the ingredients of commission of cognizable offence are apparently made out.
7. Learned counsel for the petitioners has referred the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
Rajiv Thapar and Others Versus Madan Lal Kapoor reported in 2013(3)SCC 330, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in Rajiv Thapar's case (supra) reiterated the legal principle that at this stage, neither
truthfulness of the allegations levelled by complainant can be evaluated, nor can weight of defence
evidence be determined. Where allegations bring out all ingredients of the charge/charges levelled,
and material placed before the Court prima facie shows truthfulness of the allegations, the trial must
proceed even when accused is successful in raising some suspicion or Patna High Court CR. MISC.
No.3437 of 2016 dt.24-07-2019 doubt in the allegations levelled. This is so because it would result in
giving finality to the accusations levelled by the prosecution.
8. Learned counsel has placed reliance on case of All Cargo Movers (1) Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. vs. Dhanesh
Badamal Jain & Anr. reported in 2008(1) PLJR SC 51 for his submission that criminal proceedings
should not be encouraged, when it is found to be mala fide or otherwise an abuse of the process of
the Court. It is easy to allege mala fides and difficult to prove. The civil dispute may give rise to
criminal act or even false criminal prosecution.

9. At this stage, this Court cannot evaluate as to whether the allegations of criminal offence, which
have been supported by other evidences, are true or not and acceptable or not in view of the civil
dispute between the parties. Hence, I do not find any merit in this application. Accordingly, it stands
dismissed.
