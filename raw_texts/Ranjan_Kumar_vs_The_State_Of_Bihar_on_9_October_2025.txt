468, 471 and 34 of the IPC against the informant and her husband, who is informant of Brahmpur
P.S. Case No.399 of 2019 and others alleging therein that the petitioner on the invitation of Nirbhay
Singh (husband of informant) in the Year, 2017 the petitioner visited at his house (Jharsa, Gurgaon)
where Mithilesh Singh (informant) was available alongwith him and he ensured to arrange a job to
him in District Court of Haryana, and they demanded Rs.5,00,000/- for the same on 05.03.2017.
Informant and her husband visited at the house of the petitioner, where the petitioner had given
Rs.2,50,000/- and on 12.05.2017, the petitioner was called by Patna High Court CR. MISC.
No.87458 of 2024 dt.09-10-2025 them to their house for giving the offer letter issued by the District
& Sessions Judge, Gurgaon, Haryana, and demanded rest amount of Rs.2,50,000/-. The petitioner
assured that he will make payment when he will come for joining. Before joining the petitioner
verified the genuineness of the offer letter and found that it to be fake. Being cheated, the petitioner
went to the house of Nirbhay Singh where the petitioner was abused by accused persons on
05.04.2018 and Nirbhay Singh gave a cheque of Rs.2,50,000/-, which got dishonored.

6. It is lastly submitted by the learned counsel that first to teach lesson to the petitioner and out of
vengeance, the present FIR has been lodged. The petitioner has relied upon para no. 102 of State of
Haryana vs. Bhajan Lal reported in 1992 Supp(1) SCC 335, case to the content that from the bare
perusal of the FIR, it appears that in absence of any essential ingredients, no case is made out
against the petitioner under Sections 420, 465, 468, 471, 793 and 120(B) of Indian Penal Patna High
Court CR. MISC. No.87458 of 2024 dt.09-10-2025 Code.
7. Heard the Parties.
8. Considering the submissions made on behalf of the parties, as well as, the facts and circumstances
of the case, I find it apt to refer a judgment passed by Apex Court, while considering the contents of
ingredients of Sections 419, 420, 467, 468 and 471 of IPC in the case of Suresh C. Singhal & Ors. vs
State of Gujarat & Ors. reported in Criminal Appeal No. 3862 of 2024 has observed in para 18 as
under:
"The insistence on the part of the CBI to prosecute the Appellants appears to be
primarily on the assumption that offences under Sections 420, 419, 467, 468 and 471
of IPC have been committed. The said offences and the proceedings arising
therefrom, when seen, some of those offences are compoundable and with the matter
having been amicably resolved, the Court ought to have proceeded to quash the
same."
9. Considering the facts of the case, submissions of the parties and the law laid down by the Apex
Court in case of Suresh C. Singhal (supra) and in absence of any entrustment of the property by the
informant to the petitioner, the learned Magistrate without considering that the the petitioner has
also lodged a case under Sections 406, 420, 467, 468, 471 and 34 of IPC against the opposite party
