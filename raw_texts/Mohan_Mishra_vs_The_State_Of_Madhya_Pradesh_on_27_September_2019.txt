As per: B.K.Shrivastava, J.
This revision petition has been filed on 1.7.2019 under section 397/401 of CrPC against the order of
framing the charges dated 29.4.2019 passed by the Special Judge (Prevention of Corruption Act,
1988), Panna in Special Case No.4/2019.
2. By the impugned order, the learned Court framed the charges against the petitioner under
sections 7 and 13(1)(d) read with section 13(2) of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.
3. The learned lower Court framed the charges as under:-

4. It is submitted by the petitioner that the Court below framed the charges only upon the basis of
surmises and conjecture, therefore, the charges are bad in the eye of law. The Court failed to
appreciate the material, which was collected during the investigation. The Court has to apply its
independent mind on the allegation. But in the present case, the learned Court has failed to
appreciate that the prosecution has not collected any legal admissible evidence even to prima facie
bring home the charges under sections 7(1)(d) and 13(2) of Prevention of Corruption Act. The Court
has also failed to give due opportunity to the petitioner. No reason has been assigned by the learned
lower court and the charges have been framed in mechanical manner. The documents of the
prosecution show that the petitioner was transferred from the DEO office to Manhar Higher
Secondary School on 18.7.2017. The charge was already taken from him on 24.7.2017 and was given
to Mahendar Kumar Sahu on 18.9.2017 and, therefore, there is documentary proof showing that
there was no occasion for the petitioner to remain on the aforesaid post where he could have
impressed or materialized to get the work done from the senior officer. The document of affiliation
with the signature of the concerned DEO is a forged
-:- 3 -:-
document. On the contrary, the prosecution has filed the aforesaid document on Page
no.71 of chargesheet in which the signatures were already available as on 11.8.2017
and, therefore, it is an apparent case where the complainant has made a false story.
Therefore, it is requested to set aside the impugned order dated 29.4.2019 and
subsequent criminal proceedings.
5. On the other side, the State strongly supported the order passed by the trial court. It is submitted
by the State that prima facie demand and acceptance both are proved from the evidence collected
during the investigation. The defence of the accused cannot be seen at the stage of framing of
charges. Sufficient material is available on the record to proceed against the petitioner. He placed
reliance upon the judgment dated 11.9.2019 passed by this Division Bench in Criminal Revision
No.2405/2019 (Santosh Marskole Vs. State of M.P. through the Superintendent of Police (SPE),
Lokayukt, Sagar).
6. It appears from the perusal of the documents submitted before the challan that the complainant
Anand Kumar Patel is the resident of Village Dhanokhar, Police Station Devendra Nagar, District
Panna. The complainant is running a school in the name of "Sarman State Public School" at Panna.
The government recognized the school for the period w.e.f. 1.4.2017 to 31.3.2002. DISE code was
also given to the complainant, but the complainant found that the DISE code is not visible online.
Therefore, before 2 or 3 days from 22.9.2017, he contacted to the petitioner, who was the Clerk in
the Office of District Education Officer. When the complainant told the petitioner that his DISE code
is not visible online, then the accused/petitioner took the copy of the certification of recognition and

Mohan Mishra vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 27 September, 2019
said that he will obtain the seal and signature from the District Education Officer, but the
complainant should give Rs.3,000/- for this work. The complainant submitted a written application
before the Lokayukt office, Sagar on 22.9.2017 saying that he is not willing to give the bribe of
Rs.3000/- to the accused. Thereafter, the Police (Lokayukt) gave a voice-
-:- 4 -:-
recorder to the complainant with the instructions to record the conversation of
demanding the money by the accused. All necessary formalities were also completed
by the Lokayukt. The complainant met the accused between 1:30 to 2:00 p.m. on
23.9.2017 and recorded the conversation with the accused. Transcription of the
aforesaid conversation is also filed along with the challan, which shows the demand
of money. On 25.9.2017 the trap was conducted. The complainant handover the
amount of Rs.3000/- to the accused in his office. The accused received the money in
his hand and put it in the pocket of jeans, worn by him. The amount was recovered
from the pocket of the accused and, thereafter, the police completed all formalities.
After investigation, the Lokayukt filed challan before the Competent Court, who
framed the aforesaid charges.
7. In the order dated 11.9.2019 passed in Criminal Revision No.2405/2019 (Santosh Marskole Vs.
State), this Court mentioned the various case laws in this regard. It is the settled position of law that
at the stage of framing the charge, the Court has to apply its mind to the question whether or not
there is any ground for presuming the commission of offence by the accused. Court is not required
to see whether there is sufficient ground for conviction of the accused or whether the trial is sure to
end in his conviction? The standard test proved and judgment, which is to be applied finally before
finding the accused guilty or otherwise is not exactly to be applied at the state of framing the
charges. T he Court is required to evaluate the material and documents on record with a view to
finding out if the facts emerging there from taken at their face value disclose the existence of all the
ingredients constituting the alleged offence. At the stage of framing the charges, the Court has to
consider the material produced by prosecution with a view to find out if there is ground for
presuming that the accused has committed the offence or that there is no sufficient ground for
proceeding against him. At this stage, Court is not required to marshal materials on record but only
has to prima facie consider whether there is sufficient material is available against the accused. The
Revisional Court cannot interfere at the initial stage of framing the charges; merely on
-:- 5 -:-
hypothesis, imagination and far-fetched reasons. The charges can also be framed on
the basis of strong suspicion. It is not open to the Court framing charges to analyse all
the materials including pros and cons, reliability or acceptability. Therefore, it can be
said that the charge has to be framed, if Court feels that there is strong suspicion that
accused has committed offence. In the series of judgments, it has been said that
according to the provision of sections 227 and 228 of CrPC, it is for the trial court to
consider the material available on record with the object that if it is not rebutted,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10729524/ 3
Mohan Mishra vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 27 September, 2019
then whether the accused can be convicted for a particular offence or not? The Court
must proceed on the assumption that the material, which has been brought on record
by the prosecution is true and evaluate the material in order to determine whether
the facts emerging from the material, taken on its face value, disclose the existence of
the ingredients necessary to constitute the offence. Defence of accused cannot be seen
at the stage of charge.
8. In the present case, the demand of illegal gratification is found in the transcript and the prima
facie, it appears that the accused took the money from the complainant and at that time, he caught
hold red-handed, therefore, prima facie sufficient material is available to proceed against the
accused. Hence, the trial court has not committed any mistake by framing the aforesaid charges
under sections 7 and 13(1)(d) read with section 13(2) of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.
9. Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.
