Commissioner Of Income Tax-I vs M/S.Ip Rings Limited on 28 January, 2020
1690/Mds/2010, for the Assessment Years 1999-2000, 2003-2004, 2004-2005 and 2005-2006, by
raising the following substantial questions of law:
"(i) Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Income Tax
Appellate Tribunal was right in holding that the Commissioner of Income-Tax
(Appeals) was justified in restricting the disallowance of royalty payment to the
foreign company to 25% only as capital expenditure and allowing 75% of the royalty
as revenue expenditure without appreciating that the terms of the agreement
conferred an enduring advantage to the assessee and therefore the entire payment
fell in the capital field?
(ii) Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Income Tax
Appellate Tribunal was right in not adjudicating the grounds raised by the Revenue
to the effect that from the assessment year 1999-2000 the Income Tax Act had been
amended by granting depreciation on intangible assets treated as a separate "block of
assets" and therefore the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
Southern http://www.judis.nic.in Judgt. dt. 28.1.2020 in T.C.A.359 to 362/2011
CIT-I v. IP Rings Ltd.
Switchgear Ltd. (232 ITR 539) was not applicable in the facts of the instant case?"
2. When the matters are taken up for hearing, learned Senior Standing Counsel
brought to our notice the Circular instruction issued by the Central Board of Direct
Taxes vide Circular No.17/2019 dated 8th August 2019, wherein, it is stipulated that
appeals shall not be filed/pursued by the Department before the High Court in cases
where the tax effect does not exceed Rs.1,00,00,000/- (Rupees One Crore).
3. In the instant cases, the tax effect is said to be less than the monetary limit
imposed and therefore, the Appeals filed by the Revenue are dismissed, as
withdrawn, keeping open the substantial questions of law for determination in
appropriate cases. No costs.
