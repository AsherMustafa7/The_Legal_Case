e-mail for cancelling the registration under the UPGST Act on 02.01.2023 and the registration was
suspended with immediate effect.
4. He further submits that without mentioning any date and time for personal hearing in the
aforesaid notice, the impugned order dated 23.01.2023 was passed whereby cancelling the
registration of the petitioner within twenty one days. He further submits that due to being fell ill, the
petitioner could not aware about passing of such order and the time of filing revocation application
got passed over. However, as soon as he came to know about the said order, approached his local
counsel and got an appeal filed against the impugned order dated 23.01.2023, which has been
rejected without adverting to the grounds mentioned in the appeal. Hence, the present writ petition.
5. He further submits that the order of cancellation of the registration has been passed without any
application of mind whatsoever and the same is clear from the first two lines of the cancellation
orderdated 23.01.2023 itself where the first line thereof says that reply has been filed, and the
second line says that no reply has been submitted.
6. This Court on an identical sets of fact was pleased to allow the petitioner and the order impugned
therein were quashed.

M/S Deepak Singh Contractor And General ... vs State Of Up And 2 Others on 3 March, 2025
"This has reference to your reply dated 11.01.2023 in response to show cause dated
02.01.2023 whereas no reply to notice to show cause has been submitted;
The effective date of cancellation of your registration is 23.01.2023"
11. The order of cancellation itself says that the authorities have passed the order without
application of mind as whereof first line says that 'with reference to the reply dated 11.01.2023', and
the second line says that no reply has been submitted.
12. The Division Bench of this Court on an identical sets of fact in the case of Surendra Bahadur Vs.
State of U.P. and others (Writ Tax No.172 of 2023), has quashed the order. The said judgment was
followed by the Single Bench of this Court in the case ofVirpratap (supra). The relevant paragraph of
the said judgment is quoted as below:-
"4. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner submits that in the first
line, the order states that a reply was filed by the petitioner on May 11, 2022 whereas
second line records that no reply was submitted. He relies upon a Division Bench
judgment of this Court in Writ Tax No.172 of 2023 titled as Surendra Bahadur Singh
v. State of U.P. and others decided on August 23, 2023, wherein the Division Bench
has held as follows:
"6. Learned counsel for the petitioner argues that although no fault can be found with
the appellate order dismissing the appeal as Appellate Authority does not have the
power to condone the delay in terms of the scheme of the Act, however, he argues
that the order cancelling the registration is without application of mind; he draws my
attention to the impugned order dated 07.01.2023, which does not disclose any
application of mind. He, thus, argues that the quasi judicial order which has an
adverse effect on the right of the petitioner to run business as guaranteed under
Article 19 of the Constitution of India, the same has been done without any
application of mind which is neither the intent of the Act nor can it be held to be in
compliance of the mandate of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. He further
argues that as the appeal has not been decided on merit, the doctrine of merger will
have no application and it is only the order dated 07.01.2023 which affects the
petitioner and as the same is devoid of any reasons, the same can be challenged
before this Court as decided by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Whirlpool
Corporation v. Registrar of Trademarks, Mumbai and Ors. - (1998) 8 SCC 1.
7. He further places reliance on the judgment of this Court in the case of Om Prakash
Mishra v. State of U.P. & Ors.; Writ Tax No.100 of 2022 decided on 06.09.2022
wherein this Court had recorded that every administrative authority or a quasi
judicial authority should necessarily indicate reasons as reasons are heart and soul of
any judicial or administrative order.

8. In the present case from the perusal of the order dated 07.01.2023, clearly there is
no reason ascribed to take such a harsh action of cancellation of registration. In view
of the order being without any application of mind, the same does not satisfy the test
of Article 14 of the Constitution of India, as such, the impugned order dated
07.01.2023 (Annexure - 2) is set aside. The petition is accordingly allowed.
9. It is, however, directed that the petitioner shall file reply to the show-cause notice
within a period of three weeks from today. The Adjudicating Authority i.e. Assistant
Commissioner, Gonda shall proceed to pass fresh order after giving an opportunity of
hearing to the petitioner and after considering whatever defence he may take."
5. Learned counsel for the petitioner further relies upon a coordinate Bench judgment of this Court
in Writ Tax No.1476 of 2022 titled as M/s Namo Narayan Singh v. State of U.P. and others decided
on October 10, 2023 to emphasis the point that providing of reasons in order is of essence in judicial
proceedings.
6. In the present case, the facts are similar to one in Surendra Bahadur Singh's case (supra), wherein
the appeal was barred by time under Section 107 of the Act. However, the Division Bench in
Surendra Bahadur Singh's case (supra) took into consideration the original order and set aside the
same being non-reasoned and allowed the petitioner therein to file reply to the show cause notice.
7. In light of the above, I am of the view that the orders impugned herein are liable to be set aside.
Accordingly, the order in original dated May 11, 2022 and the order dated February 8, 2024 are
quashed and set aside. The petitioner is directed to file its reply to the show cause notice within
three weeks from date and the adjudicating authority is directed to proceed de-novo and pass order
after granting opportunity of hearing to the petitioner."
13. In view of the above facts as stated as well as in the light of the aforesaid judgment, the
impugned orders cannot be sustained in the eyes of law and the same are hereby quashed.
14. Accordingly, the writ petition is allowed with cost of Rs. 5,000/- to be paid to the petitioner. The
matter is remanded to the authority concerned for deciding the same de novo after affording an
opportunity of hearing to all the stakeholder, within a period of two months in case the petitioner
submits reply within two weeks from today along with certified copy of this order.
15. Amount, if any, deposited by the petitioner pursuant to the impugned orders, shall be refunded
to him within a month from the date of production of certified copy of this order.
16. List in Chamber after being filed an affidavit of compliance on behalf of the respondent no.3.
17. Registrar (Compliance) of this Court is directed to communicate this order to the respondent
no.3 within 72 Hours.
