Mrs.D.Raja Malar vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 30 July, 2020
2. Heard Mr.D.Vijayakumar, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners and Mrs.S.Srimathy,
learned Special Government Pleader appearing for the respondents 1 to 3 and
Mr.V.R.Shanmuganathan, learned Standing Counsel appearing for the fourth respondent.
3.Since the facts of the case in all the writ petitions and the issue raised therein are common, with
the consent of both sides, these writ http://www.judis.nic.in petitions are being disposed of at the
admission stage itself, by this common order.
4.The short facts leading to filing of this writ petition are that, the petitioners were appointed at the
Sarah Tucker Girls Higher Secondary School, Tirunelveli as B.T.Assistant (English) on 17.09.2010,
Tamil Pandit on 20.06.2011 and Tamil Pandit on 20.06.2011 respectively. On such appointment, the
School had sent a proposal for approval of such appointments and on considering the said
proposals, the third respondent vide proceedings dated 02.01.2012, 15.11.2011 and 15.11.2011
respectively has given approval to such appointments.
5.By the said approval orders, the third respondent approved the appointment of the petitioners as
B.T., Assistant and Tamil Pandit at the Sarah Tucker Girls Higher Secondary School, Tirunelveli
from the date of their appointment. Thereafter, the petitioners have been continuously working in
that School.
http://www.judis.nic.in
6.However, the present grievance of the petitioners is that, the petitioners even though have been
working in the approved post from the date of their appointment, they have not been given the
annual increment, for which, they are entitled. When such request was made to the respondents to
grant the annual increment of pay to the petitioners, the same has now been rejected through the
impugned orders, dated 11.06.2020, 11.06.2020 and 16.06.2020 respectively, by the third
respondent. Challenging the said orders, the present writ petitions have been filed.
7. Mr.D.Vijayakumar, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners has brought to the notice of this
Court that, the one and only reason cited in the impugned order for denying such annual increment
to the petitioners is that, the petitioners have not completed the 'Teacher Eligibility Test' (for brevity
'TET') qualification and without TET qualification since the petitioners were appointed and they
were approved, in order to give the annual increment, was there any Government order issued in
that effect, they asked that should be produced.
http://www.judis.nic.in
8.In this context, the learned counsel would further submit that, the very reason cited in the
impugned order does not hold good, because, the TET qualification itself was prescribed by the
National Council for Teacher Education (for brevity NCTE) originally on 23.08.2010 and
subsequently, by amendment, as per NCTE (Determination of Minimum Qualifications for
Recruitment of Teachers in Schools) Amendment Regulations 2011, by way of notification, dated
27.09.2011. Therefore, from that date only the said qualification of TET prescribed by NCTE has
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64917630/ 4
Mrs.D.Raja Malar vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 30 July, 2020
become a mandatory one. In other words, the Teachers, who are appointed on or after 27.09.2011
should have the qualification of TET, without which, their appointment cannot be approved and
they will not be entitled to get service benefits. However, according to the learned counsel appearing
for the petitioner, the petitioners admittedly were appointed on 17.09.2010, 20.06.2011 and
20.06.2011 respectively and the same having been approved by the third respondent vide his
proceedings dated 28.12.2011, 15.11.2011 and 15.11.2011 respectively such appointments obviously
are prior to the cut-off date i.e., 27.09.2011. Therefore, the said reason of having the qualification of
TET as prescribed by the NCTE insofar as the petitioners are concerned, may not
http://www.judis.nic.in be applicable and therefore, citing the said reason since the impugned
orders have been passed, it cannot be sustained. Hence, the learned counsel seeks indulgence of this
Court.
9. I have heard Mrs.S.Srimathy, learned Special Government Pleader appearing for the official
respondents, who would submit that, the TET have become the necessary and mandatory
qualification for every Teacher to be appointed both in Government as well as the Government
Aided Schools and without such qualification, no appointment of Teacher can be made and if at all,
any appointment is already made, those Teachers have been given time to complete the TET
qualification and without having qualified with the TET qualification, the petitioners cannot seek for
any additional service benefits like the annual increment. Therefore, it has rightly been rejected by
the third respondent through the impugned orders. Therefore, the said order may not be interfered
with by this Court.
10. I have considered the said submissions made by the learned counsel appearing for the parties
and perused the materials placed before this Court.
http://www.judis.nic.in
11.The only controversy which arises in this writ petition is, whether the reason cited in the
impugned order that, the petitioners should have qualified with TET qualification, even though they
were appointed on 17.09.2010, 20.06.2011 and 20.06.2011 respectively and from that date, their
appointments have also been approved by the 3rd respondent, for getting the benefit like the annual
increment, is hold good or not.
12. In this context, the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners has relied upon a decision of
the learned Judge of this Court exactly on the same point made in a batch of writ petitions in
W.P(MD).Nos.5626 to 5630 of 2017 etc., dated 08.03.2019 in the matter of M.Maharani Vs. State of
Tamil Nadu rep., by its Secretary, Department of School Education and others. In the said order, the
learned counsel for the petitioner relied upon para No.10, which reads thus.
“10.However, there is no cut off date specified in the said G.O.Ms.No.181, with regard to acquiring
the qualification of pass TET to continue in service as B.T.Assistants/Secondary Grade Teachers,
who are working http://www.judis.nic.in as such in the respondent Schools. In this regard, a
cursory glance at Clause (5) of the notification dated 23.08.2010 and its amended notification dated
29.07.2011 issued by the NCTE, the contents of which are reproduced at paragraph Nos.8.2 and 8.4
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64917630/ 5
Mrs.D.Raja Malar vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 30 July, 2020
above, would reveal that if the http://www.judis.nic.in process of appointment of teachers was
initiated prior to the date of notification by issuing advertisement, such appointments have to be
made in accordance with NCTE (Determination of Minimum Qualifications for Recruitment of
Teachers in Schools) Regulations 2001, there is no qualification prescribed with regard to
possession of TET certificate, for appointment to the post of B.T.Assistant and Secondary Grade
Teachers. The qualification of passing TET was first introduced by the notification dated 23.08.2010
and it was amended vide notification dated 27.09.2011 and the teachers, who were appointed prior
to that date need not pass TET and even in the case of the teachers who were appointed after that
date, if the advertisement to initiate the process of appointment of teachers was made prior to that
date, then, their appointments also can be in accordance with the NCTE Regulations 2001 and they
need not acquire the TET qualification.“
13. From the reading of the said judgment, it has become clear that the NCTE prescribed the
qualification of TET originally from 23.08.2010 and subsequently from 27.09.2011 by way of
notification. http://www.judis.nic.in Therefore, the actual date, on which, the said qualification
become mandatory is 27.09.2011. Therefore, those teachers, who were appointed prior to 27.09.2011
cannot be put against the said prescription of the NCTE and this has been exactly decided by the
learned Judge in the said judgement, referred to above.
14. In the case of the petitioners, they were appointed on 17.09.2010, 20.06.2011 and 20.06.2011
respectively in the sanctioned vacancy as B.T.Assistant and Tamil Pandit at the fifth respondent
School and the said appointments, having been considered, was approved by the third respondent
vide his proceedings, dated 28.12.2011, 15.11.2011 and 15.11.2011 respectively, where it has been
specifically stated that, the petitioners were appointed on 17.09.2010, 20.06.2011 and 20.06.2011
and approval was also given from the date of their appointment.
15.Therefore, it has become quite clear that, the appointment of the petitioners as on 17.09.2010,
20.06.2011 and 20.06.2011 having been approved by the third respondent through the said approval
order, the applicability of the prescription made by NCTE to have such http://www.judis.nic.in
qualification, insofar as the petitioners are concerned, cannot be made or applied. Therefore, the
said reason cited in the impugned order by the third respondent, in the considered opinion of this
Court, may not hold good. Therefore, on that reason, the petitioners service benefit like annual
increment cannot be denied.
16.Moreover, once the appointments are approved by the authority and the same still holds good,
the petitioners have been brought under regular time scale of pay. When that being the position, the
annual increment is part and parcel of the time scale of pay system being adopted for permanent
employees/Teachers of the Government is concerned and when such is the position, the third
respondent cannot insist upon any Government Order, which cannot be created by the petitioners.
17.More over, if at all, any such request is made by the petitioners for annual increment, that should
have been decided by the respondents by taking into account the relevant Rule position, Service Law
and the Government order, if any available with the respondents, instead, off
http://www.judis.nic.in late, it has become a practice that some of the officials/authorities would
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64917630/ 6
Mrs.D.Raja Malar vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 30 July, 2020
raise a question stating that, in order to get the benefit sought for by the
employees/Teacher/incumbent, whether any Government order is available in their favour .
18.Whether any Government order is available in their favour or not, whether they are entitled to
have such a benefit or not, can be decided only by the authority and not by the person, who seeks it.
Therefore, that kind of questions being raised by the authorities would show that, they abdicate
their responsibility on the very employee or Teacher concerned, which kind of practice cannot be
approved by this Court.
19.Therefore, this Court is of the considered view that, the reason cited in the impugned orders
cannot be sustained in the eye of law. Hence, it is liable to be interfered with.
20.In the result, the impugned orders are quashed and the respondents are directed to reconsider
the request of the petitioners with http://www.judis.nic.in regard to their plea for grant of annual
increment as their appointment dated 17.09.2010, 20.06.2011 and 20.06.2011 respectively having
been approved by the third respondent vide his proceedings dated 28.12.2011, 15.11.2011 and
15.11.2011 respectively, this Court feels that, there can be no further impediment for the petitioners
to get such benefits. Therefore, suitable order to that effect shall be passed by the official
respondents within a period of eight (8) weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
21.With these directions, these Writ Petitions are ordered accordingly. No costs. Consequently,
connected Miscellaneous Petitions are closed.
