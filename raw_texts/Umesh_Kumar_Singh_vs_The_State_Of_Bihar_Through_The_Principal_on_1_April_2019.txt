4. In order to appreciate the rival stands of the parties, it
would be necessary to notice the background facts of these cases
in a little detail.
5. Mushahari P. S. Case No. 100 of 1996 was
instituted on the basis of oral statement of one Satish Chaudhary,
which was recorded by one A. K. Mishra, Sub-Inspector of
Mushahari Police Station at 1.30 am in the night intervening
between 3/4.11.1996.
6. In his oral statement made to the police, Mr. Satish
Chaudhary stated that the office of Salaha Branch of Vaishali
Regional Rural Bank, Vaishali runs on the first floor of his house
and he with his family resides on the ground floor. In the night
intervening between 3/4.11.1996, he was sleeping in his house
after taking dinner. At about 12 midnight, he suddenly saw smoke
emanating from upper side ventilator of the house. Thereafter, he
came out making noise and many villagers came on hearing his
noise. In the meantime, police patrolling party of Musahari Police
Station and local mukhiya also came. Fire in the bank was brought
under control by spraying water by the police and the villagers.
He saw that the main gate was unlocked and the key was also
attached to it. Likewise, locks of the east and the west room of the
bank were also open and keys were attached to them too. In those

rooms, some papers were found lying burnt. There was also a
plastic jerrycan from which smell of petrol was coming out. There
was also a torch. The Branch Manager was transferred on
03.11.1996
and a new Branch Manager was likely to join on 04.11.1996.
7. On the basis of the above incidents, he claimed that unknown persons have burnt papers of the
bank upon entering the premise, after opening locks of its main gate.
8. On the basis of aforestated statements, the Officer-in-
charge of Mushahari Police Station, namely, Awadhesh Kumar Singh drew a first information report
(for short 'FIR') of Mushahari P. S. Case No. 100 of 1996 under Section 436 of the IPC against
unknown accused persons and took up investigation himself.
9. On completion of investigation, a police report under Section 173 (2) of the Code of Criminal
Procedure ( for short 'CrPC') was submitted vide charge sheet no. 56 of 1999 dated 12.07.1999 under
Section 435 of the IPC against the petitioner whereas one Umesh Kumar Verma was shown
absconding. The petitioner had surrendered before the court on 25.06.1999. On perusal of the
charge sheet, it would be manifest that prosecution intends to examine 10 witnesses in support of
charge. Patna High Court CR. WJC No.107 of 2019 dt.01-04-2019
10. The learned Jurisdictional Magistrate took cognizance of the offence after going through the
materials collected by the police during investigation and the police report submitted under Section
173(2) of the CrPC on 06.08.1999.
Subsequently, charge was framed and summons were issued to the prosecution witnesses.
11. P.W. 1 Satish Chaudhary was examined during trial on 27.08.2007. After lapse of more than 8
years, P.W. 2 Arun Kumar Chaudhary was examined on 05.04.2016, P. W. 3 Ved Prakash
Shrivastava was examined on 04.05.2016 and P.W. 4 Nand Kishor Singh was examined on
07.06.2016.
12. Mushahari P. S. Case No. 4 of 1997 was instituted on the basis of written report submitted by
Shri Awadh Kishor Sinha to the Officer-in-charge of Mushahari Police Station on 30.01.1997 under
Sections 409, 419 and 420 of the IPC. In his written report, he has stated that the FIR was instituted
in respect of mischief by fire caused on 03.11.1996 in Salaha Branch of Vaishali Regional Rural
Bank. From the action taken so far in connection with the case, it appears that the persons
responsible for causing mischief have not yet been arrested. The circumstantial evidence reveals that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184414465/ 4
Umesh Kumar Singh vs The State Of Bihar Through The Principal ... on 1 April, 2019
the motive for causing mischief by fire was to conceal and destroy the evidence in Patna High Court
CR. WJC No.107 of 2019 dt.01-04-2019 respect of scam/misappropriation committed by the
employee of the bank. The officers and employees posted in the bank were suspected to be involved
in commission of the offence. An auditor was appointed for inquiry after the said incident in order
to find out the probability of scam/misappropriation in the bank. From the audit's report based on
documents, it transpired that the petitioner, a Branch Manager and the cashier Umesh Kumar
Verma, while they were posted in the said branch have misappropriated the amount to the tune of
twenty lakh fifty thousand four hundred eighty one rupees and fifty paise.
13. On completion of investigation, the investigating officer submitted a report under Section 173(2)
of the CrPC vide charge sheet no. 7 of 1999 dated 12.07.1999 under Sections 419, 420 and 409 of the
IPC. In the said charge sheet, the petitioner and Umesh Kumar Verma were sent up for trial. On
perusal of the charge-sheet, it would appear that the petitioner has already surrendered in the court
whereas another accused Umesh Kumar Verma was shown as absconding. It would also be pertinent
to note here that in column 13 of the charge sheet, name of nine witnesses have been given whom
the prosecution intends to examine in support of the charges.
Patna High Court CR. WJC No.107 of 2019 dt.01-04-2019
14. On perusal of the said report, the learned Jurisdictional Magistrate took cognizance of the
offence on 13.12.1999. Subsequently, charges were framed against the petitioner under Sections
409, 419 and 420 of the IPC on 19.03.2002 to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.
Hence, the trial commenced.
15. In course of trial, P.W. 1 Lalan Baitha was examined on 20.10.2014, P.W.2 Awadh Kishor Prasad
was examined on 22.11.2014 and P.W. 3 Rajeshwar Prasad was examined on 12.12.2014.
16. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner submitted that though a period of about
20 years has elapsed since the institution of the FIRs in question giving rise to two criminal
proceedings, trials have not been completed and there is no likelihood of their completion in near
future. Thus, the petitioner has been deprived of his constitutional right to speedy trial flowing from
Article 21 of the Constitution of India. He has drawn my attention towards the order sheet of the
court below in the aforestated two cases in order to corroborate his contention that for no fault on
the part of the petitioner, the trial has remained inconclusive in spite of all possible efforts taken by
the court. He has submitted that delay in trial of the aforesaid cases is not Patna High Court CR.
WJC No.107 of 2019 dt.01-04-2019 attributable to the petitioner. Inordinately delay is proof of
prejudice caused to the petitioner. He has submitted that the prosecution has failed to show
exceptional circumstance which could possibly be taken into consideration for condoning a callous
and inordinate delay of more than two decades in completion of trials against the petitioner.
17. According to him, it is bounden duty of the trial courts to ascertain that cases are disposed of
speedily. The State being the protector of fundamental rights of its people has bounden duty to
ensure speedy trial and avoid any excessive delay in trial of criminal cases in order to prevent grave
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184414465/ 5
Umesh Kumar Singh vs The State Of Bihar Through The Principal ... on 1 April, 2019
miscarriage of justice. He contended that till date, the prosecution has failed to prove any credible
evidence on the basis of which the petitioner can be convicted in the remotest way. Under such
circumstances, there is no adequate reason why the prosecution should be allowed to continue the
trial any more. In support of his contention, he has submitted that the Supreme Court has
repeatedly expressed its concern about the problem in completion of trial. According to him, entire
criminal prosecution is liable to be quashed on the basis of law laid down by the Supreme Court in
Abdul Rehman Antuley & Ors. v. R. S. Nayak & Anr. reported in (1992) 1 SCC 225, P. Ramachandra
Rao v. State of Karnataka Patna High Court CR. WJC No.107 of 2019 dt.01-04-2019 reported in
(2002) 4 SCC 578 and Vakil Prasad Singh v. State of Bihar, reported in (2009) 3 SCC 355.
18. Per contra, learned counsel appearing for the State contended that in view of seriousness of the
offences alleged against the petitioner, these writ petitions are liable to be dismissed. He submitted
that though there is some delay on behalf of the prosecution in the completion of trial, the same
alone cannot be a ground for terminating the criminal trials against the petitioner which relate to
misappropriation of public money. He contended that there is no outer limit for conclusion of
criminal proceedings. Hence, the petitioner does not have any vested right.
He further contended that the delay in trial was also attributable to the petitioner.
19. Before adverting to the core issue whether under the given circumstances, the petitioner is
entitled for getting the entire criminal proceeding against him quashed, it would be appropriate to
notice the manner in which the trial in the aforestated two cases proceeded in some detail.
20. Firstly, I would like to deal with Mushahari P. S. Case No. 4 of 1997 corresponding to Trial No.
1733 of 2018.
21. In Mushahari P. S. Case No. 4 of 1997, it is reiterated that in the FIR instituted on 30.01.1997,
charge-sheet Patna High Court CR. WJC No.107 of 2019 dt.01-04-2019 was submitted on
12.07.1999 whereafter cognizance was taken on 13.12.1999 and charges were framed against the
petitioner on 19.03.2002. In the charge sheet prosecution has named 9 witnesses to be examined. In
course of trial, out of whom, P.W. 1 Lalan Baitha, P.W.2 Awadh Kishor Prasad and P.W. 3 Rajeshwar
Prasad were examined on 20.10.2014, 22.11.2014 and 12.12.2014 respectively. After framing of
charges, the trial proceeded against the petitioner in Mushahari P. S. Case No. 4 of 1997 in the

Patna High Court CR. WJC No.107 of 2019 dt.01-04-2019
22. From the aforesaid tabular chart, it would be evident that since the date of framing of charge, the
petitioner is regularly attending the court but the prosecution has conducted the case in the most
casual manner. Though charges were framed in March, 2002, till 11.08.2014 more than 70
adjournments were granted to the prosecution to produce witnesses, no witness was examined
meaning thereby that after framing of charges for more than 12 years the prosecution did not
examine a single witness in support of its case.
23. First witness was examined on 20.10.2014, second witness was examined on 22.11.2014 and the
third witness was examined on 12.12.2014. Thereafter, again, the prosecution has forgotten to
examine any witness. After 12.12.2014, till 15.10.2018 more than 35 adjournments were granted to
the prosecution to produce witnesses and repeated directions were given by the trial magistrate that
in case the prosecution fails to produce witnesses the evidence would be closed, no witness has been
examined by the prosecution.
24. Let me now consider the manner in which the trial proceeded in Mushahari P. S. Case No. 100 of
1996, which was registered on 04.11.1996 and on completion of investigation, Patna High Court CR.
WJC No.107 of 2019 dt.01-04-2019 charge-sheet was submitted on 12.07.1999. In the said case,
charge was framed under Section 435 of the IPC against the petitioner on 02.04.2007 and,
thereafter, the trial proceeded in the following manner:-

25. From the above tabular chart, it is evident that after framing of charges, the petitioner regularly
attended the court. It can also be inferred that the prosecution has conducted the case in the most
casual manner. After examination of P.W. 1 on 27.08.2007, the prosecution completely forgot to
prosecute the case. Having examined the P.W.1 in August, 2007, no efforts were made by the
prosecution to examine other witnesses for a long period of 9 years. On 05.03.2006, the concerned
Magistrate directed the prosecution to produce witnesses and a failure to comply with the same
would lead to the closure of the prosecution evidence. Thereafter, P.W. 2, P.W. 3 and P.W. 4 were
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184414465/ 21
Umesh Kumar Singh vs The State Of Bihar Through The Principal ... on 1 April, 2019
examined on 05.04.2016, 04.05.2016 and 07.06.2016 respectively.
26. Having considered the manner in which the trial has proceeded in the court below in the two
criminal proceedings, one thing is clear that the petitioner is not responsible for causing Patna High
Court CR. WJC No.107 of 2019 dt.01-04-2019 delay in the completion of trial. It is also not a case of
systematic delay. The delay is solely on account of the callous attitude of the prosecution. It has
failed to produce its witnesses despite more than 100 adjournments spanning over a period of more
than 20 years from the date of institution of the FIR and 17 years from the date of framing of charge
in one of the cases.
27. The mandate of law is not only that guilty of an offence should not escape punishment but it is
also necessary that the accused persons in a criminal case facing trial should not be harassed
indefinitely.
28. Fair and speedy trial are the cornerstones of an efficient justice system which in turn is a
linchpin of a robust democratic regime. The right to speedy trial envisions greater respect for the
due process of law. An evaluation of the origins of the right to speedy trial is essential in order to
understand its evaluation into a hallmark of the criminal justice system. This right traces its origin
back to the Assize of Clarendon dating back to 1166 and Magna Carta of 1215. Darren Allen in his
article 'The Constitutional Floor Doctrine and the Right to a Speedy Trial, 26 CAMPBELL L. REV.
101, 103 (2004) observes as follows:
"In the midst of a civil war, English barons cornered King John on the meadows of
Runnymede in 1215 and forced the desperate Patna High Court CR. WJC No.107 of
2019 dt.01-04-2019 monarch to relinquish some powers of his throne. Affixing his
seal to this "Great Charter,"
King John ceded that some rights are protected against the authority of the sovereign. By the terms
of this historic parchment, even the king was subject to a rule of law. Of the many limitations on the
power of the sovereign, the Magana Carta required that he respect the right of all "freemen" to a
speedy disposition of trials. Over the course of the following centuries, this right took on increasing
importance as the steady march of progress expanded that pool of "free" men."
29. It is important to note that with time, the right to speedy trial traversed boundaries and
eventually defined the aspirations of the people of America. First, it applied only to the Federal
Government [Barron v. Baltimore, 32 U.S. 243 (1833)].
However, the U. S. Supreme Court in 1967 widened the scope of this right holding it as one of the
most basic rights preserved by the Constitution, gradually making it binding on the States [Klopfer
v. North Carolina, 386 U.S. 213 (1967)]. The journey of this right from England to colonial America
has been documented by Darren Allen. In his words:
"The speedy trial right eventually migrated to America with the first ships of English settlers. Before
the Revolutionary War, Patna High Court CR. WJC No.107 of 2019 dt.01-04-2019 American

colonists heralded the Magna Carta and its provisions as natural law, inalienable by any act of the
king or Parliament. Even after disagreement over this principle compelled the American colonies to
divorce themselves from the British Empire, the speedy trial right attached itself to the emerging
American legal system. George Mason borrowed the speedy trial guarantee from the Magna Carta
while authorising the Virginia Declaration of Rights in the early stages of the American Revolution.
Almost fourteen years later, James Madison proposed the speedy trial right among a "Bill of Rights",
a list of amendments designed to quell concerns about the expansive power of the new post-Articles
government. When Madison's proposals passed Congress and survived ratification, the right to a
speedy trial was memorialized as constitutional doctrine in the Sixth Amendment."
30. A concerted effort by the Indian judiciary to uphold the constitutional ethos of justice i.e. social,
economic and political as laid down in the Preamble in order to remedy the perils facing undertrials
has been seen in various judicial decisions. However, the dismal state of criminal justice system in
the present time runs counter to the fundamental right to life and liberty enshrined in Article 21.
Patna High Court CR. WJC No.107 of 2019 dt.01-04-2019
31. Article 38 of the Constitution of India visualizes an affirmative state action for bringing about a
new social order based on justice, social, economic and political. Moreover, the Constitution
envisages a justice delivery system that is based on distributive equality and rule of law. Article 39A
is based on the twin principles of equality in providing justice and free legal aid.
The main thrust of these provisions is to deliver prompt and inexpensive justice to the people at
large without compromising with the quality of justice. This position of law has been well charted
out in the decision of Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, reported in (1978) 1 SCC 248. The Court
opined that Article 21 confers a fundamental right on every person not to be deprived of his life and
liberty except according to procedure established by law, that such procedure is not some semblance
of a procedure but the procedure should be 'reasonable, fair and just'; and therefrom flows, without
doubt, the right to speedy trial. It was also observed that no procedure which does not ensure a
reasonably quick trial can be regarded as 'reasonable, fair or just' and it would fall foul of Article 21.
The Court clarified that speedy trial means reasonably expeditious trial which is an integral and
essential part of the fundamental right to life and liberty enshrined in Article 21.
Patna High Court CR. WJC No.107 of 2019 dt.01-04-2019
32. While tracing the history of Indian legislation on this issue, the Supreme Court of India observed
that speedy trial is a fundamental right of an accused and State Governments should prevent any
unreasonable delay in disposal of cases. The beacon of justice glares and speaks through the
authoritative voice of Justice P. N. Bhagwati in Husssainara Khatoon (1) & Ors. v.
Home Secretary, State of Bihar reported in (1980) 1 SCC 81 :
"5. There is also one other infirmity of the legal and judicial system which is
responsible for this gross denial of justice to the undertrial prisoners and that is the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184414465/ 23
Umesh Kumar Singh vs The State Of Bihar Through The Principal ... on 1 April, 2019
notorious delay in disposal of cases. It is a sad reflection on the legal and judicial
system that the trial of an accused should not even commence for a long number of
years. Even a delay of one year in the commencement of the trial is bad enough: how
much worse could it be when the delay is as long as 3 or 5 or 7 or even 10 years.
Speedy trial is of the essence of criminal justice and there can be no doubt that delay
in trial by itself constitutes denial of justice. It is interesting to note that in the United
States, speedy trial is one of the constitutionally guaranteed rights. ..."
33. Speedy trial is the essence of criminal justice and it protects both the State and the accused
because it is based on Patna High Court CR. WJC No.107 of 2019 dt.01-04-2019 the principle that
governments prosecute, not persecute those whom it accuses of crime. In the fourth Hussainara
Khatoon & Ors. v. Home Secretary, State of Bihar, reported in (1980) 1 SCC 98, Justice Bhawati,
speaking for the Bench, held that it is the State's obligation to uphold the constitutional right to
provide speedy trial, he ruled :
"... The State cannot avoid its constitutional obligation to provide speedy trial to the accused by
pleading financial or administrative inability. The State is under a constitutional mandate to ensure
speedy trial and whatever is necessary for this purpose has to be done by the State. It is also the
constitutional obligation of this Court, as the guardian of the fundamental rights of the people, as a
sentinel on the qui vive, to enforce the fundamental right of the accused to speedy trial by issuing
the necessary directions to the State which may include taking of positive action, such as
augmenting and strengthening the investigative machinery, setting up new courts, building new
court houses, providing more staff and equipment to the courts, appointment of additional Judges
and other measures calculated to ensure speedy trial...."
34. In State of Bihar v. Uma Shankar Ketriwal reported in (1981) I SCC 75, a report was lodged with
the police in April, Patna High Court CR. WJC No.107 of 2019 dt.01-04-2019 1960 that the
respondents' firm misappropriated large quantity of G.C. sheets meant for distribution of quota
holders. After investigation a police report was submitted in 1962 to the Magistrate who took
cognizance of the case in January, 1963.
Charges were framed against the respondents in September, 1967.
Thereafter, the progress of the case was very slow. In 1979, the respondents applied to the High
Court for quashing proceeding initiated against them. The High Court quashed the proceedings on
the ground that the police report did not disclose any evidence against the respondent. The Court
observed that the commencement of the prosecution in the year 1963 and its ongoing nature in the
year 1979 is an abuse of the process and should not be allowed. The State appealed against the order
of the High Court to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court was in agreement with the State that
the first ground given by the High Court may not be sustainable, but it affirmed the decision of the
High Court on the second ground. The Supreme Court observed:
"...we cannot lose sight of the fact that the trial has not made much headway even
though no less than 20 years have gone by. Such protraction itself means
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184414465/ 24
Umesh Kumar Singh vs The State Of Bihar Through The Principal ... on 1 April, 2019
considerable harassment to the accused not only monetarily but also by way of
constant attention to the case and repeated appearances in Court, apart from Patna
High Court CR. WJC No.107 of 2019 dt.01-04-2019 anxiety. It may well be said that
the respondents themselves were responsible in a large measure for the slow pace of
the case in as much as quite a few orders made by the trial Magistrate were
challenged in higher Courts, but then there has to be a limit to the period for which
criminal litigation is allowed to go on at the trial stage..."
35. In State of Maharashtra v. Champalal Punjaji Shah, reported in (1981) 3 SCC 610, the Supreme
Court while deciding the question whether there has been a denial of the right to a speedy trial
observed that the Court is entitled to take into consideration whether the delay was unintentional,
caused by over-crowding of the court's docket or under-staffing of the prosecutors and whether the
accused contributed a fair part to the time taken.
36. In Kadra Pahadiya v. State of Bihar reported in (1983) 2 SCC 104, the Supreme Court reiterated
the position of law laid down in Maneka Gandhi (Supra) and Hussainara Khatoon (Supra). The
Court declared that :
" .....any accused who is denied this right of speedy trial is entitled to approach this
Court for the purpose of enforcing such right and this court in discharge of its
constitutional obligation has the power to give necessary Patna High Court CR. WJC
No.107 of 2019 dt.01-04-2019 directions to the State Governments and other
appropriate authorities for securing this right to the accused."
37. The bench of Justice Chinappa Reddy and Justice M M. Dutt in the decision of Raghubir Singh v.
State of Bihar reported in (1986) 4 SCC 481 held that right to speedy trial is one of the dimensions of
the fundamental right to life and liberty guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution. They
observed as follows :
"... Several questions arise for consideration. Was there delay? How long was the delay? Was the
delay inevitable having regard to the nature of the case, the sparse availability of legal services and
other relevant circumstances? Was the delay unreasonable? Was any part of the delay caused by the
wilfulness or the negligence of the prosecuting agency? Was any part of the delay caused by the
tactics of the defence? Was the delay due to causes beyond the control of the prosecuting and
defending agencies? Did the accused have the ability and the opportunity to assert his right to a
speedy trial? Was there a likelihood of the accused being prejudiced in his defence? Irrespective of
any likelihood of prejudice in the conduct of his defence, was the very length of the delay sufficiently
prejudicial to the accused? Patna High Court CR. WJC No.107 of 2019 dt.01-04-2019 Some of these
factors have been identified in Barker v. Wingo. A host of other questions may arise which we may
not be able to readily visualise just now. The question whether the right to a speedy trial which
forms part of the fundamental right to life and liberty guaranteed by Article 21 has been infringed is
ultimately a question of fairness in the administration of criminal justice even as 'acting fairly' is of
the essence of the principles of natural justice [In re K.(H.) an infant] and a 'fair and reasonable
procedure' is what is contemplated by the expression 'procedure established by law' in Article 21
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184414465/ 25
Umesh Kumar Singh vs The State Of Bihar Through The Principal ... on 1 April, 2019
(Maneka Gandhi)."
38. In Rakesh Saxena v. State through C.B.I reported in AIR 1987 SC 740 the Supreme Court
quashed the proceedings on the ground that any further continuance of the prosecution after lapse
of more than six years is uncalled for.
39. In Madhu Mehta v. Union of India reported in (1989) 4 SCC 62, the Supreme Court held that :
"...Article 21 is relevant in all stages. Speedy trial in criminal cases though may not be
a fundamental right, is implicit in the broad sweep and content of Article 21. Speedy
trial is part of one's fundamental right to life and personal liberty".
Patna High Court CR. WJC No.107 of 2019 dt.01-04-2019
40. In Mihir Kumar Ghosh v. State of West Bengal reported in 1990 Cr.L.J. 26, where a criminal
proceeding had been pending for 15 years from the date of the offence, the Supreme Court held that
it amounted to violation of the constitutional right to speedy trial of a 'fair, just and reasonable'
procedure, hence the accused was entitled to be set free.
41. In Santosh De v. Archana Guha reported in AIR 1994 SC 1229, the Supreme Court quashed the
prosecution on the ground of inordinate delay as the trial for corruption of a government servant
was kept pending for 14 years noting that the long delay was caused entirely and exclusively because
of the default of the prosecution. The Court held that the unexplained long delay in commencing
trial by itself infringed the right of the accused to speedy trial.
42. In Kartar Singh v. State of Punjab reported in (1994) 3 SCC 569, the Supreme Court has
observed:
"The concept of speedy trial is read into Article 21 as an essential part of the
Fundamental Right to Life and Liberty guaranteed and preserved under our
Constitution. The right to speedy trial begins with the actual restraint imposed by
arrest and consequent incarceration and continues at all the stages, namely, the stage
of investigation, Patna High Court CR. WJC No.107 of 2019 dt.01-04-2019 enquiry,
trial, appeal and revision so that any possible prejudice that may result from
impermissible and avoidable delay from the time of the commission of the offence till
it consummates into a finality, can be averted."
43. In Anil Rai v. State of Bihar reported in (2001) 7 SCC 318, the Supreme Court observed that the
justice should not only be done but should also appear to have been done. Similarly whereas justice
delayed is justice denied, justice withheld is even worse than that.
44. In Machander v. State of Hyderabad reported in AIR (1955) SC 792, the Supreme Court
observed that while it is incumbent on the Court to see that no guilty person escapes, it is still more
its duty to see that justice is not delayed and accused persons are not indefinitely harassed. In order
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184414465/ 26
Umesh Kumar Singh vs The State Of Bihar Through The Principal ... on 1 April, 2019
to understand the scope and expanse of the right to speedy trial under Article 21, the Supreme Court
in Abdul Rehman Antulay v. R. S. Nayak (Supra) held that this right encompasses all the stages i.e.,
the stage of investigation, inquiry, trial, appeal, revision and retrial.
45. The delay in disposal of cases has put immense strain on the working of the judicial system and
has also shaken the faith of the people in the judiciary. In order to protect the individual defendant
from prejudicial delay while at the same time Patna High Court CR. WJC No.107 of 2019
dt.01-04-2019 preserving society's interest in holding the guilty accountable for their crimes, Justice
Jeevan Reddy, speaking for the Bench, laid down a set of non-exhaustive guidelines that can be
taken into consideration while deciding future cases arising out of the same issue:
"(1) Fair, just and reasonable procedure implicit in Article 21 of the Constitution
creates a right in the accused to be tried speedily. Right to speedy trial is the right of
the accused. The fact that a speedy trial is also in public interest or that it serves the
social interest also, does not make it any the less the right of the accused. It is in the
interest of all concerned that the guilt or innocence of the accused is determined as
quickly as possible in the circumstances.
(2) Right to speedy trial flowing from Article 21 encompasses all the stages, namely
the stage of investigation, inquiry, trial, appeal, revision and re-trial. That is how, this
Court has understood this right and there is no reason to take a restricted view.
(3) The concerns underlying the right to speedy trial from the point of view of the
accused are:
(a) the period of remand and pre-conviction detention should be as short as possible.
In other words, the accused should not be Patna High Court CR. WJC No.107 of 2019 dt.01-04-2019
subjected to unnecessary or unduly long incarceration prior to his conviction;
(b) the worry, anxiety, expense and disturbance to his vocation and peace, resulting from an unduly
prolonged investigation, inquiry or trial should be minimal; and
(c) undue delay may well result in impairment of the ability of the accused to defend himself,
whether on account of death, disappearance or non-availability of witnesses or otherwise.
(4) At the same time, one cannot ignore the fact that it is usually the accused who is interested in
delaying the proceedings. As is often pointed out, "delay is a known defence tactic". Since the burden
of proving the guilt of the accused lies upon the prosecution, delay ordinarily prejudices the
prosecution. Non- availability of witnesses, disappearance of evidence by lapse of time really work
against the interest of the prosecution. Of course, there may be cases where the prosecution, for
whatever reason, also delays the proceedings. Therefore, in every case, where the right to speedy
trial is alleged to have been infringed, the first question to be put and answered is -- who is
responsible for the delay? Proceedings taken by either party in good faith, to vindicate Patna High
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184414465/ 27
Umesh Kumar Singh vs The State Of Bihar Through The Principal ... on 1 April, 2019
Court CR. WJC No.107 of 2019 dt.01-04-2019 their rights and interest, as perceived by them, cannot
be treated as delaying tactics nor can the time taken in pursuing such proceedings be counted
towards delay. It goes without saying that frivolous proceedings or proceedings taken merely for
delaying the day of reckoning cannot be treated as proceedings taken in good faith. The mere fact
that an application/petition is admitted and an order of stay granted by a superior court is by itself
no proof that the proceeding is not frivolous. Very often these stays are obtained on ex parte
representation.
(5) While determining whether undue delay has occurred (resulting in violation of Right to Speedy
Trial) one must have regard to all the attendant circumstances, including nature of offence, number
of accused and witnesses, the workload of the court concerned, prevailing local conditions and so on
-- what is called, the systemic delays. It is true that it is the obligation of the State to ensure a speedy
trial and State includes judiciary as well, but a realistic and practical approach should be adopted in
such matters instead of a pedantic one.
(6) Each and every delay does not necessarily prejudice the accused. Some delays may indeed work
to his advantage. As has been observed by Powell, J. in Barker 'it cannot be Patna High Court CR.
WJC No.107 of 2019 dt.01-04-2019 said how long a delay is too long in a system where justice is
supposed to be swift but deliberate'. The same idea has been stated by White, J. in U.S. v. Ewell, in
the following words:
'... the Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial is necessarily relative, is consistent
with delays, and has orderly expedition, rather than mere speed, as its essential
ingredients; and whether delay in completing a prosecution amounts to an
unconstitutional deprivation of rights depends upon all the circumstances.' However,
inordinately long delay may be taken as presumptive proof of prejudice. In this
context, the fact of incarceration of accused will also be a relevant fact. The
prosecution should not be allowed to become a persecution. But when does the
prosecution become persecution, again depends upon the facts of a given case.
(7) We cannot recognize or give effect to, what is called the 'demand' rule. An accused
cannot try himself; he is tried by the court at the behest of the prosecution. Hence, an
accused's plea of denial of speedy trial cannot be defeated by saying that the accused
did at no time demand a speedy trial. If in a given case, he did make such a demand
and yet he was not tried speedily, it would be a plus point in his favour, but the mere
non-asking for a speedy trial Patna High Court CR. WJC No.107 of 2019
dt.01-04-2019 cannot be put against the accused. Even in USA, the relevance of
demand rule has been substantially watered down in Barker and other succeeding
cases.
(8) Ultimately, the court has to balance and weigh the several relevant factors --
'balancing test' or 'balancing process' -- and determine in each case whether the right to speedy trial
has been denied in a given case.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184414465/ 28
Umesh Kumar Singh vs The State Of Bihar Through The Principal ... on 1 April, 2019
(9) Ordinarily speaking, where the court comes to the conclusion that right to speedy trial of an
accused has been infringed the charges or the conviction, as the case may be, shall be quashed. But
this is not the only course open. The nature of the offence and other circumstances in a given case
may be such that quashing of proceedings may not be in the interest of justice. In such a case, it is
open to the court to make such other appropriate order
-- including an order to conclude the trial within a fixed time where the trial is not concluded or
reducing the sentence where the trial has concluded -- as may be deemed just and equitable in the
circumstances of the case.
(10) It is neither advisable nor practicable to fix any time-limit for trial of offences. Any such rule is
bound to be qualified one. Such rule cannot also be evolved merely to shift the burden of proving
justification on to Patna High Court CR. WJC No.107 of 2019 dt.01-04-2019 the shoulders of the
prosecution. In every case of complaint of denial of right to speedy trial, it is primarily for the
prosecution to justify and explain the delay. At the same time, it is the duty of the court to weigh all
the circumstances of a given case before pronouncing upon the complaint. The Supreme Court of
USA too has repeatedly refused to fix any such outer time- limit in spite of the Sixth Amendment.
Nor do we think that not fixing any such outer limit ineffectuates the guarantee of right to speedy
trial.
(11) An objection based on denial of right to speedy trial and for relief on that account, should first
be addressed to the High Court. Even if the High Court entertains such a plea, ordinarily it should
not stay the proceedings, except in a case of grave and exceptional nature. Such proceedings in High
Court must, however, be disposed of on a priority basis."
46. Having established that the right to speedy trial, though not enumerated as one of the
fundamental rights in the Constitution of India, is implicit in Article 21. Justice R. C. Lahoti,
speaking for the Supreme Court in P. Ramachandra Rao v. State of Karnataka (Supra) held that:
"... Life and liberty, the words employed in shaping Article 21, by the founding fathers
of Patna High Court CR. WJC No.107 of 2019 dt.01-04-2019 the Constitution, are not
to be read narrowly in the sense drearily dictated by dictionaries; they are organic
terms to be construed meaningfully. Embarking upon the interpretation thereof,
feeling the heart-throb of the preamble, deriving strength from the directive
principles of State policy and alive to their constitutional obligation, the courts have
allowed Article 21 to stretch its arms as wide as it legitimately can. The mental agony,
expense and strain which a person proceeded against in criminal law has to undergo
and which, coupled with delay, may result in impairing the capability or ability of the
accused to defend himself have persuaded the constitutional courts of the country in
holding the right to speedy trial a manifestation of fair, just and reasonable procedure
enshrined in Article 21. ..."
47. The Court in P. Ramachandra Rao (Supra) dealt with the question of the need to prescribe an
outer limit for conclusion of criminal proceedings, so as to uphold the constitutional right of speedy
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184414465/ 29
Umesh Kumar Singh vs The State Of Bihar Through The Principal ... on 1 April, 2019
trial. The correctness of the decision in two Raj Deo Sharma's cases i.e. Raj Deo Sharma v. State of
Bihar reported in (1998) 7 SCC 507 and (1999) 7 SCC 604 and that of "Common Cause" a Registered
Society v. Union of India & Ors. reported in (1996) 6 SCC 775 and (1996) 4 SCC 33 was Patna High
Court CR. WJC No.107 of 2019 dt.01-04-2019 considered by a seven judge Bench in P.
Ramachandra Rao v.
State of Karnataka (Supra). The order of the Constitution Bench reads thus:
"... Having placed on record the exposition of law as to right to speedy trial flowing from Article 21 of
the Constitution, this Court held that it was necessary to leave the rule as elastic and not to fix it in
the frame of defined and rigid rules. It must be left to the judicious discretion of the court seized of
an individual case to find out from the totality of circumstances of a given case if the quantum of
time consumed up to a given point of time amounted to violation of Article 21, and if so, then to
terminate the particular proceedings, and if not, then to proceed ahead. The test is whether the
proceedings or trial has remained pending for such a length of time that the inordinate delay can
legitimately be called oppressive and unwarranted, as suggested in A.R. Antulay. ...
For all the foregoing reasons, we are of the opinion that in Common Cause case (I) [as modified in
Common Cause (II)] and Raj Deo Sharma (I) and (II) the Court could not have prescribed periods of
limitation beyond which the trial of a criminal case or a criminal proceeding cannot continue and
must mandatorily be closed followed by an order Patna High Court CR. WJC No.107 of 2019
dt.01-04-2019 acquitting or discharging the accused. In conclusion we hold:
(1) The dictum in A.R. Antulay case is correct and still holds the field.
(2) The propositions emerging from Article 21 of the Constitution and expounding
the right to speedy trial laid down as guidelines in A.R. Antulay case adequately take
care of right to speedy trial. We uphold and reaffirm the said propositions.
(3) The guidelines laid down in A.R. Antulay case are not exhaustive but only
illustrative. They are not intended to operate as hard-and-fast rules or to be applied
like a straitjacket formula. Their applicability would depend on the fact situation of
each case. It is difficult to foresee all situations and no generalization can be made.
(4) It is neither advisable, nor feasible, nor judicially permissible to draw or prescribe
an outer limit for conclusion of all criminal proceedings. The time-limits or bars of
limitation prescribed in the several directions made in Common Cause (I), Raj Deo
Sharma (I) and Raj Deo Sharma (II) could not have been so prescribed or drawn and
are not good law. The criminal courts are not obliged to terminate trial or criminal
proceedings merely on account of lapse of time, as prescribed by the directions Patna
High Court CR. WJC No.107 of 2019 dt.01-04-2019 made in Common Cause case (I),
Raj Deo Sharma case (I) and (II). At the most the periods of time prescribed in those
decisions can be taken by the courts seized of the trial or proceedings to act as
reminders when they may be persuaded to apply their judicial mind to the facts and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184414465/ 30
Umesh Kumar Singh vs The State Of Bihar Through The Principal ... on 1 April, 2019
circumstances of the case before them and determine by taking into consideration the
several relevant factors as pointed out in A.R. Antulay case and decide whether the
trial or proceedings have become so inordinately delayed as to be called oppressive
and unwarranted. Such time-limits cannot and will not by themselves be treated by
any court as a bar to further continuance of the trial or proceedings and as
mandatorily obliging the court to terminate the same and acquit or discharge the
accused.
(5) The criminal courts should exercise their available powers, such as those under
Sections 309, 311 and 258 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to effectuate the right to
speedy trial. A watchful and diligent trial Judge can prove to be a better protector of
such right than any guidelines. In appropriate cases, jurisdiction of the High Court
under Section 482 CrPC and Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution can be invoked
seeking appropriate relief or suitable directions.
Patna High Court CR. WJC No.107 of 2019 dt.01-04-2019 (6) This is an appropriate occasion to
remind the Union of India and the State Governments of their constitutional obligation to
strengthen the judiciary -- quantitatively and qualitatively -- by providing requisite funds,
manpower and infrastructure. We hope and trust that the Governments shall act."
48. In Vakil Prasad Singh v. State of Bihar (Supra), the Supreme Court emphasized the need of
speedy investigation and trial as under :-
"Time and again this Court has emphasised the need for speedy investigations and trial as both are
mandated by the letter and spirit of the provisions of CrPC [in particular, Sections 197, 173, 309,
437(6) and 468, etc.] and the constitutional protection enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution.
Inspired by the broad sweep and content of Article 21 as interpreted by a seven-Judge Bench of this
Court in Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India and in Hussainara Khatoon (1) v. State of Bihar this
Court had observed that Article 21 confers a fundamental right on every person not to be deprived of
his life or liberty except according to procedure established by law; that such procedure is not some
semblance of a procedure but the procedure should be 'reasonable, fair and just'; and therefrom
flows, without doubt, the right to speedy trial. It was also observed Patna High Court CR. WJC
No.107 of 2019 dt.01-04-2019 that: (Hussainara Khatoon (1) case, SCC p.89, para 5] "5. ... No
procedure which does not ensure a reasonably quick trial can be regarded as 'reasonable, fair or just'
and it would fall foul of Article 21."
The Court clarified that speedy trial means reasonably expeditious trial which is an integral and
essential part of the fundamental right to life and liberty enshrined in Article 21."
49. The Court held that right to speedy trial is an inalienable right under Article 21 of the
Constitution of India and is not only applicable to the actual proceedings but also includes within its
sweep proceedings at the stage of investigation. It held as under :-

Umesh Kumar Singh vs The State Of Bihar Through The Principal ... on 1 April, 2019
"It is, therefore, well settled that the right to speedy trial in all criminal persecutions
(sic prosecutions) is an inalienable right under Article 21 of the Constitution. This
right is applicable not only to the actual proceedings in court but also includes within
its sweep the preceding police investigations as well. The right to speedy trial extends
equally to all criminal prosecutions and is not confined to any particular category of
cases. In every case, where the right to speedy trial is alleged to have Patna High
Court CR. WJC No.107 of 2019 dt.01-04-2019 been infringed, the court has to
perform the balancing act upon taking into consideration all the attendant
circumstances, enumerated above, and determine in each case whether the right to
speedy trial has been denied in a given case.
Where the court comes to the conclusion that the right to speedy trial of an accused
has been infringed, the charges or the conviction, as the case may be, may be quashed
unless the court feels that having regard to the nature of offence and other relevant
circumstances, quashing of proceedings may not be in the interest of justice. In such
a situation, it is open to the court to make an appropriate order as it may deem just
and equitable including fixation of time-frame for conclusion of trial."
50. Tested on the touchstone of the broad principles enumerated above in the pronouncements
made by the Supreme Court, I think that in the present case, the petitioner's constitutional right
recognized under Article 21 of the Constitution has been violated. Both the cases relate to an offence
alleged to have taken place in the night of 3/4.11.1996. In spite of giving sufficient opportunity to the
prosecution to produce its witnesses, the prosecution is not in a position to say when it will be able
to produce its remaining witnesses. The cases are Patna High Court CR. WJC No.107 of 2019
dt.01-04-2019 prolonging for more than two decades. They cannot be allowed to linger further and
that too for an indefinite period. The direction issued by the trial court for producing witnesses in
support of its charge seems to have had no effect on the prosecution. The manner in which the two
trials have proceeded in the court of Magistrate gives an impression that the prosecution is totally
insensitive and uncommitted in holding the trial. It has failed to show that the delay in trials was in
any way attributable to the petitioner. Thus, on the facts in hand, in my considered opinion, the
delay caused in completion of the trials has clearly violated the constitutional guarantee of speedy
trial under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. Thus, further proceedings in Mushahari P. S. Case
No. 100 of 1996 corresponding to Trial No. 429 of 2017 pending before the learned Additional Chief
Judicial Magistrate-
cum-Sub-Judge-XII, Muzaffarpur and Mushahari P. S. Case No. 4 of 1997 corresponding to Trial
No. 1733 of 2018 pending before the learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate-cum-Sub-Judge-
VIII, Muzaffarpur cannot be allowed to continue. They deserve to be quashed.
51. Consequently, these applications are allowed and the proceedings pending against the petitioner
in Mushahari P. S. Case No. 100 of 1996 corresponding to Trial No. 429 of 2017 Patna High Court
CR. WJC No.107 of 2019 dt.01-04-2019 pending before the learned Additional Chief Judicial
Magistrate-
