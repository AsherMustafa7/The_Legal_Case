Amar Kumar vs State Of Bihar And Anr on 23 September, 2025
would not be proper to proceed with the prosecution.
10. Learned APP for the State has supported the allegations alleged against the petitioner under
Sections 406, 420, 467, 468 and 471 of the Indian Penal Code is prima facie made out, therefore, no
interference is required.
11. Heard the parties.
12. Having considered the rival submissions made on behalf of the parties, as well as, having
perused the allegations made in the FIR dated 16.10.2012 and the order taking cognizance dated
07.03.2018 under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471 and 406 of the Indian Penal Code, I have also perused
the case diary in which the Investigating Officer has taken note of the forensic science examination
report, in which the opinion is as under : -
"Opinion"
The documents of the case have been carefully and thorough examined.
Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.51237 of 2018 dt.23-09-2025
2. The examination under VSC 3000 reveals that in the red enclosed portions stamped and marked
Q-1 to Q- 4, there are marks of mechanical erasure at places as indicated by the disturbance of paper
fibers and security printing, but due to excessive disturbance of paper fibers, it has not been possible
to decipher the original writings"
13. The said opinion of the Forensic Science Laboratory was given to the Investigating
Officer by the wife of the complainant, as has been informed by the Investigating
Officer on the basis of the materials collected in course of the investigation.
14. In course of enquiry, the Investigating Officer has recorded that there is no report
of the Expert from the Forensic Science Laboratory or the cheque has been found to
be forged one.
15. Section 191 of IPC deals with the fact that any extra material having been
produced by the complainant or on behalf of the accused or any person, the entire
investigation shall be vitiated. Section 191 of IPC is reproduced hereinafter as follows
: -
"191. Giving false evidence. -Whoever, being legally bound by an oath or by an
express provision of law to state the truth, or being bound by law to make a
declaration upon any subject, makes any statement which is false, and which he
either knows or believes to be false or does not believe to be true, is said to give false
evidence."

Amar Kumar vs State Of Bihar And Anr on 23 September, 2025
16. Now question arises, in such circumstances, in absence of any complaint made by the Director of
the Company Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.51237 of 2018 dt.23-09-2025 (Mr. Vijay Bundela)
and the Assistant Director for the aforesaid reason has been made accused in the present FIR after
having been found his complaint to be false, can further proceeding against the petitioner be
allowed ?
17.The intention to cheat and commit fraud whether right from its inception which was equally
shared between both the parties i.e. the petitioner and the Director of the Company having issued
the cheque.
18. The ingredients of cheating, fraud, deceiving or inducement is contained in Section 415 of IPC,
the same is reproduced herein after:-
"Section 415-. Whoever, by deceiving any person, fraudulently or dishonestly induces
the person so deceived to deliver any property to any person, or to consent that any
person shall retain any property, or intentionally induces the person so deceived to
do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit if he were not so deceived,
and which act or omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person
in body, mind, reputation or property, is said to "cheat".
19. Now the question which arises at this junction, when after receiving complaint from the
Assistant Director (co- accused), the bank immediately freezed the account and thereafter the
account was de-freezed could be construed as amounting to fraud committed by the petitioner. In
absence of any complaint made by the drawer whether crime under Section 420 is made out? The
Hon'ble Supreme Court in Paragraph Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.51237 of 2018 dt.23-09-2025
no.13 of the case of Ram Preeti Yadav vs U.P. Board Of High School and Ors. reported in (2003) 8
SCC 311 has held as follows :
"13. Fraud is a conduct either by letter or words, which induces the other person, or
authority to take a definite determinative stand as a response to the conduct of
former either by words or letter. Although negligence is not fraud but it can be
evidence on fraud."
20. Section 17 of Indian Contract Act, 1872 defines 'Fraud' as -
17. "Fraud" defined.-- "Fraud" means and includes any of the following acts committed by a party to
a contract, or with his connivance, or by his agent2, with intent to deceive another party thereto of
his agent, or to induce him to enter into the contract:--(1) the suggestion, as a fact, of that which is
not true, by one who does not believe it to be true;(2) the active concealment of a fact by one having
knowledge or belief of the fact;(3)a promise made without any intention of performing it;(4) any
other act fitted to deceive;(5) any such act or omission as the law specially declares to be
fraudulent."

21. The Apex Court while consiering the contents of ingredients of Sections 467 and 468 of IPC in
the case of Suresh C. Singhal & Ors. vs State of Gujarat & Ors. reported in CRIMINAL APPEAL NO.
3862 OF 2024 has observed in para 18 as under:
"The insistence on the part of the CBI to prosecute the Appellants appears to be
primarily on the assumption that offences under Sections 420, 419, 467, 468 and 471
of IPC have been committed. The said offences and the proceedings arising
therefrom, when seen, some of those offences are compoundable and with the matter
having been amicably resolved, the Court ought to have proceeded to quash the
same."
Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.51237 of 2018 dt.23-09-2025
22. This Court observes that there is a distinction between criminal breach of trust and cheating. For
cheating, criminal intention is necessary at the time of making false or misleading representation i.e.
since inception. In criminal breach of trust, mere proof of entrustment is sufficient. Thus, in case of
criminal breach of trust, the offender is lawfully entrusted with the property, and he dishonestly
misappropriates the same. Whereas, in case of cheating, the offender fraudulently or dishonestly
induces a person by deceiving him to deliver a property. In such a situation, both offences cannot
co-exist simultaneously. Consequently, the complaint cannot contain both the offences that are
independent and distinct. The said offences cannot co-exist simultaneously in the same set of facts
as they are antithetical to each other. The Apex Court while considering the content of ingredients of
Sections 406 and 420 of the Indian Penal Code in the case of Delhi Race Club (1940) Ltd. & Ors. vs.
State of Uttar Pradesh & Anr. in Criminal Appeal No. 3114 of 2024, after discussing the earlier law
laid down in several cases, has observed in paragraphs no. 35, 36 and 37 inter alia as follows:
Difference between criminal breach of trust and cheating
35. This Court in its decision in S.W. Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.51237 of 2018
dt.23-09-2025 Palanitkar v. State of Bihar S.W. Palanitkar v. State of Bihar, (2002) 1
SCC 241 expounded the difference in the ingredients required for constituting of an
offence of criminal breach of trust (Section 406 IPC) vis-à-vis the offence of cheating
(Section 420). The relevant observations read as under :
"9. The ingredients in order to constitute a criminal breach of trust are : (i) entrusting
a person with property or with any dominion over property; (ii) that person entrusted
: (a) dishonestly misappropriating or converting that property to his own use; or (b)
dishonestly using or disposing of that property or wilfully suffering any other person
so to do in violation (i) of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such
trust is to be discharged, (ii) of any legal contract made, touching the discharge of
such trust.
10. The ingredients of an offence of cheating are : (i) there should be fraudulent or
dishonest inducement of a person by deceiving him, (ii)(a) the person so deceived
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/147579962/ 5
Amar Kumar vs State Of Bihar And Anr on 23 September, 2025
should be induced to deliver any property to any person, or to consent that any
person shall retain any property; or (b) the person so deceived should be
intentionally induced to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit if
he were not so deceived; and (iii) in cases covered by (ii)
(b), the act of omission should be one which causes or is likely to cause damage or
harm to the person induced in body, mind, reputation or property."
36. What can be discerned from the above is that the offences of criminal breach of trust (Section
406 IPC) and cheating (Section 420 IPC) have specific ingredients:
In order to constitute a criminal breach of trust (Section 406 IPC) (1) There must be
entrustment with person for property or dominion over the property, and (2) The
person entrusted:
(a) Dishonestly misappropriated or converted property to his own use, or
(b) Dishonestly used or disposed of the property or wilfully suffers any other person
so to do in violation of:
(i) Any direction of law prescribing the method in which the trust is discharged; or
(ii) Legal contract touching the discharge of trust (see : S.W. Palanitkar [S.W.
Palanitkar v. State of Bihar, (2002) 1 SCC 241.
Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.51237 of 2018 dt.23-09-2025 Similarly, in respect of an offence
under Section 420IPC, the essential ingredients are:
(1) Deception of any person, either by making a false or misleading representation or
by other action or by omission;
(2) Fraudulently or dishonestly inducing any person to deliver any property, or (3)
The consent that any person shall retain any property and finally intentionally
inducing that person to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit (see
: Harmanpreet Singh Ahluwalia v. State of Punjab [Harmanpreet Singh Ahluwalia v.
State of Punjab, (2009) 7 SCC 712.
37. Further, in both the aforesaid sections, mens rea i.e. intention to defraud or the dishonest
intention must be present, and in the case of cheating it must be there from the very beginning or
inception."
23. Thereafter, the Apex Court finally concluded in paragraph no. 39 as follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/147579962/ 6
Amar Kumar vs State Of Bihar And Anr on 23 September, 2025
"39. Every act of breach of trust may not result in a penal offence of criminal breach
of trust unless there is evidence of manipulating act of fraudulent misappropriation.
An act of breach of trust involves a civil wrong in respect of which the person may
seek his remedy for damages in civil courts but, any breach of trust with a mens rea,
gives rise to a criminal prosecution as well. It has been held in Hari Prasad Chamaria
v. Bishun Kumar Surekha [Hari Prasad Chamaria v. Bishun Kumar Surekha, (1973) 2
SCC 823 "4. We have heard Mr Maheshwari on behalf of the appellant and are of the
opinion that no case has been made out against the respondents under Section 420 of
the Penal Code, 1860. For the purpose of the present appeal, we would assume that
the various allegations of fact which have been made in the complaint by the
appellant are correct. Even after making that allowance, we find that the complaint
does not disclose the commission of any offence on the part of the respondents under
Section 420 of the Penal Code, 1860. There is nothing in the complaint to show that
the respondent had dishonest or fraudulent intention at the time the appellant parted
with Rs 35,000. There is also nothing to indicate that the respondents induced the
appellant to pay them Rs 35,000 by deceiving him. It is further not the case of the
appellant that a representation was made by the respondents to him at or before the
time he paid the money to them and that at the time the representation was made,
the respondents knew the Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.51237 of 2018
dt.23-09-2025 same to be false. The fact that the respondents subsequently did not
abide by their commitment that they would show the appellant to be the proprietor of
Drang Transport Corporation and would also render accounts to him in the month of
December might create civil liability for them, but this fact would not be sufficient to
fasten criminal liability on the respondents for the offence of cheating."
24. In absence of criminality and considering the facts and circumstance of the case it appears that
the matter is purely civil in nature and further proceeding against the petitioner will be abuse of
process of law. The obvious caveat being that the allegations, even if having a civil flavour to them,
must prima facie disclose an overwhelming element of criminality. In the absence of the element of
criminality, if both civil and criminal cases are allowed to continue, it will definitely amount to abuse
of the process of the Court, which the Courts have always tried to prevent by putting a stop to any
such criminal proceeding, where civil proceedings have already been instituted with regard to the
same issue, and the element of criminality is absent. If such element is absent, the prosecution in
question would have to be quashed.
25. Law in this regard is well settled by the Apex Court in the case of Paramjeet Batra v. State of
Uttarakhand reported in (2013) 11 SCC 673, in which, the Apex Court in paragraph no. 12 has held
as follows:
"12. While exercising its jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code the High Court
has to Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.51237 of 2018 dt.23-09-2025 be cautious.
This power is to be used sparingly and only for the purpose of preventing abuse of the
process of any court or otherwise to secure ends of justice. Whether a complaint
discloses a criminal offence or not depends upon the nature of facts alleged therein.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/147579962/ 7
Amar Kumar vs State Of Bihar And Anr on 23 September, 2025
Whether essential ingredients of criminal offence are present or not has to be judged
by the High Court. A complaint disclosing civil transactions may also have a criminal
texture. But the High Court must see whether a dispute which is essentially of a civil
nature is given a cloak of criminal offence. In such a situation, if a civil remedy is
available and is, in fact, adopted as has happened in this case, the High Court should
not hesitate to quash the criminal proceedings to prevent abuse of process of the
court."
26. The Apex has reiterated the aforesaid preposition in recent judgment of S.N.Vijayalakshmi &
Ors. vrs. The State of Karnataka and Anr. reported in (2025) SCC Online SC 1575.
26. The Apex Court has cautioned that the inherent power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. should be
exercised sparingly and with great caution, and that the power should not be used as an alternative
to the statutory remedies available to the parties. The Apex Court has also held that the inherent
powers should be used to interfere with the jurisdiction of the lower courts or to scuttle a fair
investigation or prosecution. The Apex Court in the case of State of Haryana v Bhajan Lal, reported
in, 1992 Supp (1) SCC 335, in paragraph no. 102, has laid down conditions for quashing court
proceedings in relation to criminal cases.
102. In the backdrop of the interpretation of the various relevant provisions of the Code under
Chapter XIV and of the principles Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.51237 of 2018 dt.23-09-2025 of
law enunciated by this Court in a series of decisions relating to the exercise of the extraordinary
power under Article 226 or the inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code which we have
extracted and reproduced above, we have given the following categories of cases by way of
illustration wherein such power could be exercised either to prevent abuse of the process of any
court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice, though it may not be possible to lay down any
precise, clearly defined and sufficiently channelised and inflexible guidelines or rigid formulae and
to give an exhaustive list of myriad kinds of cases wherein such power should be exercised.
(1) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the complaint, even if they are
taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or
make out a case against the accused.
(2) Where the allegations in the first information report and other materials, if any, accompanying
the FIR do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an investigation by police officers under
Section 156(1) of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within the purview of Section
155(2) of the Code.
(3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or complaint and the evidence collected
in support of the same do not disclose the commission of any offence and make out a case against
the accused.
(4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable offence but constitute only a
non-cognizable offence, no investigation is permitted by a police officer without an order of a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/147579962/ 8
Amar Kumar vs State Of Bihar And Anr on 23 September, 2025
Magistrate as contemplated under Section 155(2) of the Code.
(5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently improbable on
the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground
for proceeding against the accused.
(6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of the Code or the
concerned Act (under which a criminal proceeding is instituted) to the institution and continuance
of the proceedings and/or where there is a specific provision in the Code or the concerned Act,
providing efficacious redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party.
(7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and/or where the proceeding
is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a
view to spite him due to private and personal grudge.
27. The record reveals that the FIR has been lodged Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.51237 of 2018
dt.23-09-2025 by the Branch Manager of the Bank concerned and he has given instruction to the
learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Bank that the Bank has not suffered any loss and the
account holder has not complained of any loss. In such circumstances, the FIR instituted on the
basis of the complaint of the Assistant Director of the Company with an ulterior motive for wreaking
vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and personal grudge.
28. Accordingly, entire proceeding in connection with Barauni (ROP) P.S.Case No.359 of 2012 and
also the order cognizance order dated 07.03.2018 passed by the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate
are set aside and quashed.
29. Accordingly, the present quashing application stands disposed of.
