F.I.R., charge-sheet and paragraphs 5, 6, 7, 19, 20, 21, 22, 63 & 64 of the case diary, a prima facie

(Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The concerned court after applying its judicious mind and after
considering the materials available on record, has taken cognizance against respondent nos. 10 to 14
and further has dropped the proceeding against the remaining respondents. In this way, the order
passed by the concerned Court is justified Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.1484 of 2024
dt.07-10-2025 and legal and there is no reason to differ from the findings of the concerned Court
recorded while passing the impugned order.
