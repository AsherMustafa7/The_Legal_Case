a/w connected matters
6) CIMA No. 207/2008 arises out of the award dated 15.07.2006, passed by the Tribunal, whereby
claimant/respondent was held entitled to compensation of Rs. 35,000/- alongwith interest @ 7.5%

while he was travelling in a Truck bearing registration No. JKP- 137 that met with an accident on
account of rash and negligent driving of the Truck by its driver.
8) The only ground on which the appellant-Insurance Company has challenged all the aforesaid
awards is that the deceased/injured in all these cases were travelling as gratuitous passengers in the
offending load carrier (Truck) and as such, risk to their lives was not covered under the policy of
insurance. On this basis, it is contended that the learned Tribunal has fallen into an error in
saddling the liability to satisfy the award upon the appellant- Insurance Company.
9) I have heard learned counsel for the appellant and perused record of the Tribunal.

a/w connected matters
10) Learned counsel for the appellant has reiterated the contentions raised in the memo of appeal.
On the other hand, learned counsel appearing the respondents/claimants has submitted that the
deceased/injured were initially travelling in a bus, but in the midway they were made to de-board
the bus by the Army personnel, as they needed the bus for their own purpose. It has been submitted
that the deceased/injured were forcibly made to board the Truck and as such, there was no fault on
their part. On this ground, it is urged that the Insurance Company is liable to pay compensation to
the claimants or at least the appellant-Insurance Company should be asked to satisfy the award with
a right to recover the same from owner of the offending Truck.
11) Before determining the contentions raised by the rival parties, it would be pertinent to note here
that case of the claimant in CIMA No. 174/2008 stands on a different footing, inasmuch as, in the
said case, it has come in the evidence on record that the deceased, Mohd Sharief was working as a
labourer with the said Truck for loading and unloading. The said case would be discussed separately
hereafter.
12) So far as the other appeals are concerned, it is not in dispute that the deceased/injured were
travelling in the offending truck as un-authorised passengers and that the Truck in question was
insured with the appellant- Insurance Company at the relevant time. The question arises as to
whether the appellant-Insurance Company can be saddled with the liability to satisfy an award on
account of death or bodily injuries of an unauthorised passenger or in the alternative whether order
of "pay and recover" can be made against the a/w connected matters insurer in such a case. The
learned Tribunal has in fact framed an issue on this aspect of the matter, which reads as under:
"Whether the claim petition is not maintainable as the offending vehicle was load
carrier not authorised to carry the passenger? OPR-1"
13) The learned Tribunal has, after relying upon the judgment of the Karnataka High Court passed
in Madras Motor and General Insurance Co. Ltd. and anr. Vs. Nagamma and others, AIR 1977
Karnataka 46, judgments of the Supreme Court in Keesavan Nair vs. State Insurance Officer, 1972
ACJ 219 and B. V. Nagaraju vs. Oriental Insurance Co. ltd., 1996, ACJ 1178, come to the conclusion
that the appellant-Insurance Company is liable to pay the compensation to claimants.
14) It appears that reliance placed upon the ratio laid down in the aforesaid cases is misplaced
because Nagama's case (supra) involved over loading of a Taxi, whereas in Keesavan Nair's case
(supra), there was violation of conditions of permit. In B. V. Nagaraju's case (supra), it appears that
the offending vehicle was carrying more passengers than what was permitted under the policy of the
insurance. In the present appeals, the situation is quite different. Although the offending vehicle was
insured with the appellant- Insurance Company, yet risk to the lives of passengers in the offending
vehicle, which is a load carrier, was not covered. This is clear from the terms of the insurance policy,
a copy whereof has been placed on record by the claimants themselves before the trial court.

National Insurance Co. Ltd vs Mursa Begum And Ors on 10 March, 2023
15) Learned counsel for the claimants has contended that unless terms of the policy of insurance are
proved by the insurer, violation thereof cannot be established. The argument is without any merit
for the reason that the claimants have themselves placed on record a copy of policy of insurance and
they have relied upon the same. They cannot be now heard to contend that the terms of the policy
are not proved. A perusal of the terms of the policy of insurance clearly show that risk to the life of
the passengers travelling in the offending truck was not covered.
16) So far as the contention of the learned counsel for the claimants/respondents that the
deceased/injured had boarded the truck not because of their choice but because they were made to
do so forcibly by the Army personnel is concerned, the same does not make any difference,
especially to the liability of the Insurance Company. If at all the deceased/injured were forcibly
made to board the offending vehicle, they may have the grievance against the Army personnel but
they cannot have a cause of action against the appellant-Insurance Company, as it had nothing to do
with the alleged forcible boarding of the deceased/injured in the truck in question.
17) So far as contention regarding order of "pay and recover" is concerned, the same, in respect of an
unauthorised passenger, has been a matter discussion in a number of cases. This Court in the case of
United India Company ltd. Vs. Kalyan Singh and ors. ( MA No. 220/2008, decided on 16.02.2023)
while analysing this aspect of the matter has taken note of various judgments of Supreme Court on
the issue and observed as under:
a/w connected matters "8.The concept of pay and recover has been discussed by the
Supreme Court in the cases of National Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Swaran Singh, (2004)
3 SCC 297, Mangla Ram vs. Oriental Insurance Co. ltd., (2018) 5 SCC 656, Rani vs.
National Insurance Co. Ltd., (2018) 8 SCC 492 and Manuara Khatun vs. Rajesh
Kumar Singh, (2017) 4 SCC 796. The Supreme Court in all these cases has recognized
the power of the Tribunal to direct that the award in the first instance be satisfied by
the insurer with a right to recover the same from the insured.
However, in all these cases, the question regarding liability of the Insurance Company to pay the
compensation in respect of an unauthorised passenger travelling in a goods carriage vehicle did not
arise for consideration. Therefore, position of law on the subject in the cases of unauthorised
passengers needs to be noticed.
9.In New India Assurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Asha Rani and others, 2003 (2) SCC 223, the Supreme Court,
while explaining the difference between the definition of "goods vehicle" under the Motor Vehicles
Act, 1939 and the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, held that under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939, goods
vehicle would mean even a carriage of goods solely or in addition to passengers, whereas under the
Act of 1988, good vehicle means a carriage solely used for carriage of goods. It was observed that in
1939 Act, the requirement of policies and limits of liability have been provided in Section 95, which
unequivocally stated that the policy shall not be required in case of a goods vehicle for the
passengers being carried in the said vehicle. The Court went on to notice that after the amendment
of 1994, it is necessary for the insurer to insure the owner of the goods or his authorised
representatives being carried in a goods vehicle. It was held by the Supreme Court that provisions of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/67581874/ 4
National Insurance Co. Ltd vs Mursa Begum And Ors on 10 March, 2023
1988 Act do not enjoin any statutory liability on the owner of the vehicle to get his vehicle insured
for any passenger travelling in a goods vehicle and as such, insurer would not be liable there for.
10. In National Insurance Co. ltd. Vs. Baljit Kour and other, 2004(2) SCC 1, a three Judge Bench of
the Supreme Court has taken a similar view and has held that although the owner of the goods or his
authorized representative would now be covered by the policy of insurance in respect of a goods
vehicle, after the amendment of 1994 in the Motor Vehicles Act, yet it was not the intention of the
legislature to provide for the liability of the insurer with respect to passengers, especially gratuitous
passengers. The Court went on to hold that in such cases instead of the insurer, the owner of the
vehicle shall be liable for the decree. The Court further clarified that the said legal position would
have prospective effect.
11. From the foregoing enunciation of law on the subject, it is clear that after declaration of law by
the Supreme Court in Baljit Kour's case (supra), in the cases of claims awarded in favour of
gratuitous passengers travelling in goods vehicles, the Insurance Company is not liable to satisfy the
award but it is the owner only, who has to satisfy the award. Thus, no direction can be issued by any
Tribunal to the Insurance Company to pay and a/w connected matters recover the award in respect
of the passengers travelling in a goods vehicle after the decision in Baljit Kour's case (supra).
12. The legal position that emerges is that in the case of liability in respect of a passenger travelling
in a goods vehicle, which is not required to be covered under section 147 of the Act, the Insurance
Company cannot be asked to satisfy the award and then recover the same from the owner. However,
where insurance policy covers the wider risks, the situation would be different.
13. It is only in the circumstances envisaged and enumerated in Sections 149(4) and 149(5) of the
Motor Vehicle Act that even after being successful in its defence, the Insurance company can be
asked to pay the amount to the claimant and thereafter recover the same from the owner. Thus, the
principle of "pay and recover" as statutorily recognized in Sections 149(4) and Section 149(5) of the
Act, is not applicable ipso facto to the cases of gratuitous passengers travelling in a goods carriage
vehicle. "
18) In view of the aforesaid legal position, once it is shown that deceased/injured in
afore noted five appeals were travelling as unauthorised passengers in the offending
truck, their risk was not covered under the terms of policy of insurance. Thus, the
direction for pay and recover can also not be passed against the appellant-Insurance
Company in these cases.
19) That takes us to the appeal, CIMA No. 174/2008. It has been established in the
evidence led before the Tribunal that deceased Mohd Shafi was working as a labourer
with the offending truck. As per the terms of the policy of the insurance, legal liability
of the labourer is covered and in fact, Section 147 of the Motor Vehicle Act prescribes
compulsory coverage on death/bodily injury sustained by an employee. Therefore,
risk to the life of deceased Mohd Shafi was covered under the policy of insurance. To
that extent, the award impugned in CIMA No. 174/2008 does not call for any

interference by this Court.
a/w connected matters
20) For what has been discussed herein before, all the afore-titled appeals except CIMA No.
174/2008, are allowed and the appellant-Insurance Company is exonerated from its liability to
satisfy the awards impugned in all cases except in the case which is subject matter of CIMA No.
174/2008. In these cases, the amount of award shall be payable by the owner of the offending truck
and the claimants shall be at liberty to execute the award against the owner of the offending truck.
So far as CIMA No. 174/2008 is concerned, the same is dismissed.
