Th is revision coming on for hearing this day, th e court passed the
following:
ORDER
Being aggrieved by the order of framing charges, dated 03-11-2016 passed by Fifth Additional
Sessions Judge, Morena in Special Dacoity Case No.11/2016 for offences under Sections 148, 307,
307/149, 225, 225/149, 353, 332, 332/149, 393, 398/149 of IPC and Section 11/13 of MPDVPK Act,
the applicants have preferred the present criminal revision under Section 397 of CrPC.
In brief, the facts giving rise to present revision are that on 09-05-2012 at around 08:25 am,
complainant Sandeep Pawar, Sub-Inspector of Great Kailash, New Delhi came to Morena for
execution of warrant of arrest of accused Sanjeev Singh son of Shri Pancham Singh in connection
with Crime No. 01/2012 for offence under Section 420, 34 of IPC. When he tried to catch hold of
accused with the help of local police of Morena, near about 20-25 persons assaulted on him and took
away the warranty and thereafter a fire took place. They took away the accused from the custody of
the police and tried to rob the pistol of the police and committed marpeet due to which said SI had

sustained injuries. On the basis of report, Crime No. 318 of 2012 for the aforesaid offences was
registered against present applicants. The applicants were arrested. After completion of
investigation and other formalities, charge sheet has been filed.
Learned counsel for the applicants submits that initially charges were framed by the trial Court
against the accused Sanjeev Singh for commission of kidnapping and FIR and other criminal
proceedings were quashed by Delhi High Court vide order dated 08-10-2022. So far as offence
under Section 307 of IPC in the present matter is concerned, there is no allegation of causing any
gunshot injury either to the complainant or any other person and there is no intention to commit
murder. Petitioners were not involved in commission of theft or robbery, therefore, provisions of
Section 398/149 of IPC are not attracted and also also offence under Section 11/13 of MPDVPK Act
is not made out against the petitioners. It is further submitted that the police personnel from Delhi
had come in civil uniform to catch hold of accused Sanjeev Singh. So far as the earlier petitions filed
by the present petitioners is concerned, the same were dismissed by this Court vide order dated
23-02-2016 and at that the investigation was pending but in the present matter the investigation is
complete and the charges were framed against the petitioners. In support of his contention, the
learned counsel for the petitioners has drawn attention to a newspaper cuttings wherein DGP of MP
has given an opinion in regard to adopting wrong process by Delhi Police for catching hold of
accused Sanjeev Singh. Hence, prayed for setting aside the impugned order of framing charges.
Learned counsel for State as well as respondent No.2 opposed the contentions of the petitioners and
prayed for dismissal of this revision. In support of his contention, the counsel for the respondent
no.2 has relied on the judgment of Apex Court in the case of Sonu Gupta vs. Deepak Gupta and
Others, 2015(3) SCC 424, State of Rajasthan vs. Fatehkaran Mehdu passed in Criminal Appeal No.
216 of 2017 arising out of SLP (Crl) No.3998 of 2011 as well as judgment passed by this High Court
in the case of Vikram Singh vs. State of MP on 3rd August, 2018 in CRR No. 1289 of 2018.
Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the documents available on record.
So far as framing of charges and quashing of charges is concerned, law is well-settled. In the case of
Union of India Vs. Prafulla Kumar Samal and another [(1979) 3 SCC 4], it is held by the Apex Court
as under:-
''10. Thus, on a consideration of the authorities mentioned above, the following
principles emerge:
(1) That the Judge while considering the question of framing the charges under
Section 227 of the Code has the undoubted power to sift and weigh the evidence for
the limited purpose of finding out whether or not a prima facie case against the
accused has been made out.
(2) Where the materials placed before the Court disclose grave suspicion against the accused which
has not been properly explained the Court will be fully justified in framing a charge and proceeding
with the trial.

Ramveer Singh Gurjar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh Thr on 2 March, 2023
(3) The test to determine a prima facie case would naturally depend upon the facts of each case and
it is difficult to lay down a rule of universal application. By and large however if two views are
equally possible and the Judge is satisfied that the evidence produced before him while giving rise to
some suspicion but not grave suspicion against the accused, he will be fully within his right to
discharge the accused. (4) That in exercising his jurisdiction under Section 227 of the Code the
Judge which under the present Code is a senior and experienced court cannot act merely as a post
office or a mouthpiece of the prosecution, but has to consider the broad probabilities of the case, the
total effect of the evidence and the documents produced before the Court, any basic infirmities
appearing in the case and so on. This however does not mean that the judge should make a roving
enquiry into the pros and cons of the matter and weigh the evidence as if he was conducting a trial.''
In the case of Dilawar Balu Kurane Vs. State of Maharashtra [(2002) 2 SCC 135], it is held by the
Apex Court as under:-
''12. Now the next question is whether a prima facie case has been made out against
the appellant. In exercising powers under Section 227 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, the settled position of law is that the Judge while considering the question
of framing the charges under the said section has the undoubted power to sift and
weigh the evidence for the limited purpose of finding out whether or not a prima facie
case against the accused has been made out; where the materials placed before the
court disclose grave suspicion against the accused which has not been properly
explained the court will be fully justified in framing a charge and proceeding with the
trial; by and large if two views are equally possible and the Judge is satisfied that the
evidence produced before him while giving rise to some suspicion but not grave
suspicion against the accused, he will be fully justified to discharge the accused, and
in exercising jurisdiction under Section 227 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the
Judge cannot act merely as a post office or a mouthpiece of the prosecution, but has
to consider the broad probabilities of the case, the total effect of the evidence and the
documents produced before the court but should not make a roving enquiry into the
pros and cons of the matter and weigh the evidence as if he was conducting a trial
[See Prafulla Kumar Samal (supra)].
In the case of Sajjan Kumar Vs. Central Bureau of Investigation [(2010) 9 SCC 368], it is held by the
Apex Court as under:-
''21. On consideration of the authorities about the scope of Sections 227 and 228 of
the Code, the following principles emerge:-
(i) The Judge while considering the question of framing the charges under Section
227 Cr.P.C.
has the undoubted power to sift and weigh the evidence for the limited purpose of finding out
whether or not a prima facie case against the accused has been made out. The test to determine
prima facie case would depend upon the facts of each case.

(ii) Where the materials placed before the court disclose grave suspicion against the accused which
has not been properly explained, the court will be fully justified in framing a charge and proceeding
with the trial.
(iii) The court cannot act merely as a post office or a mouthpiece of the prosecution but has to
consider the broad probabilities of the case, the total effect of the evidence and the documents
produced before the court, any basic infirmities, etc. However, at this stage, there cannot be a roving
enquiry into the pros and cons of the matter and weigh the evidence as if he was conducting a trial.
(iv) If on the basis of the material on record, the Court could form an opinion that the accused might
have committed offence, it can frame the charge, though for conviction the conclusion is required to
be proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused has committed the offence.
(v) At the time of framing of the charges, the probative value of the material on record cannot be
gone into but before framing a charge the court must apply its judicial mind on the material placed
on record and must be satisfied that the commission of offence by the accused was possible.
(vi) At the stage of Sections 227 and 228, the court is required to evaluate the material and
documents on record with a view to find out if the facts emerging therefrom taken at their face value
discloses the existence of all the ingredients constituting the alleged offence. For this limited
purpose, sift the evidence as it cannot be expected even at that initial stage to accept all that the
prosecution states as gospel truth even if it is opposed to common sense or the broad probabilities of
the case.
(vii) If two views are possible and one of them gives rise to suspicion only, as distinguished from
grave suspicion, the trial Judge will be empowered to discharge the accused and at this stage, he is
not to see whether the trial will end in conviction or acquittal.'' In the case of State through Central
Bureau of Investigation Vs. Dr. Anup Kumar Srivastava [AIR 2017 SC 3698], it is held by the Apex
Court as under:-
''23.... The legal position is well-settled that at the stage of framing of charge the trial
court is not to examine and assess in detail the materials placed on record by the
prosecution nor is it for the court to consider the sufficiency of the materials to
establish the offence alleged against the accused persons. At the stage of charge the
court is to examine the materials only with a view to be satisfied that a prima facie
case of commission of offence alleged has been made out against the accused persons.
It is also well settled that when the petition is filed by the accused under Section 482
of the Code seeking for the quashing of charge framed against him the court should
not interfere with the order unless there are strong reasons to hold that in the
interest of justice and to avoid abuse of the process of the court a charge framed
against the accused needs to be quashed. Such an order can be passed only in
exceptional cases and on rare occasions. The court is required to consider the
Ã¢Â€Âœrecord of the caseÃ¢Â€Â and documents submitted therewith and, after
hearing the parties, may either discharge the accused or where it appears to the court

Ramveer Singh Gurjar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh Thr on 2 March, 2023
and in its opinion there is ground for presuming that the accused has committed an
offence, it shall frame the charge. Once the facts and ingredients of the section exists,
then the court would be right in presuming that there is ground to proceed against
the accused and frame the charge accordingly. This presumption is not a
presumption of law as such. The satisfaction of the court in relation to the existence
of constituents of an offence and the facts leading to that offence is a sine qua non for
exercise of such jurisdiction. It may even be weaker than a prima facie case.''
Similarly, in the case of Soma Chakravarti Vs. State, reported in (2007) 5 SCC 403], it
is held by the Hon'ble Apex Court that at the time of framing of charges, the
probative value of material on record cannot be gone into, and the material brought
on record by the prosecution has to be accepted as true.
Before framing a charge, the Court must apply its judicial mind on the material placed on record and
must be satisfied that the commission of offence by the accused was possible. Whether the accused
committed the offence or not, can only be decided in the trial. The charge may although be directed
to frame when there exists the strong suspicion but it is also trite that the Court must come to a
prima facie finding that there exists some material therefor.
In view of aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case as well as the law laid down by Hon'ble Apex
Court and this Court, it is crystal clear that whether the accused have committed an offence or not,
can only be decided in the trial. I find no perversity or illegality in the order impugned passed by
learned Court below warranting any interference by this Court at the stage of framing of charges.
Revision fails and is hereby dismissed.
