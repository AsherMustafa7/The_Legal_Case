SECTION 21(1) OF THE MMDR ACT, REGISTERED BY
HARIHARA RURAL POLICE STATION, DAVANAGERE
DISTRICT, WHICH IS PENDING ON THE FILE OF THE
PRINCIPAL CIVIL JUDGE (JR.DN) AND JMFC, HARIHARA,
DAVANAGERE DISTRICT.
THIS CRL.P COMING ON FOR ADMISSION THIS
DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:
ORDER
The present petition is filed seeking quashing of the registration of a case in Crime No. 63/2018
under Section 154 of Cr.P.C. by the 1st respondent-Police for the offence punishable under section
379 of IPC r/w. Section 21(1) of Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957.
2. I have heard the arguments of the learned counsel for the petitioner and as well as the learned
HCGP. Perused the records.
3. The factual aspects of the case reveal that on the FIR lodged by one Mr. Praksh D., son of
Devendrappa, the Revenue Inspector, Kurubarahalli Village, Harihar Taluk, Davanagere, making
allegations that the accused persons were involved in committing theft of sand from Tungabhadra
River by using their Tipper lorries etc. On the basis of such information, the Police have registered a
case in Crime No. 63/2018 exercising powers under Section 154 of Cr.P.C. and they are investigating
the matter.
4. Learned counsel submitted that, the registration of the case under Section 154 of Cr.P.C. itself is
not contemplated and the Police have no jurisdiction to register any case under Section 154 Cr.P.C.
and consequently investigate the matter. Therefore, the said FIR and all further proceedings in
connection with that case are required to be quashed.
5. This court had an occasion to deal with the above said aspects in detail in a case reported in ILR
2018 KAR 1497 between Sri Vivek and Another Vs. The State of Karnataka by Kunigal Police Station,
Tumkur District and Another.
HELD,-
a) In order to empower the Court to take cognizance of the offences under MMDR
Act and Rules, a private complaint is required to be filed by the competent authority
for the offences punishable under the MMDR Act or Rules thereunder. (Para 17)
b) The Special Court constituted under the MMDR Act, has no jurisdiction to directly
take cognizance of the offence under the MMDR Act and KMMC Rules, even along
with any other penal offences unless the case is committed by the jurisdictional
Magistrate. It I s made clear that the Special Court has no jurisdiction to receive a
final report from the Police under Section 173 of Cr.P.C., or to receive any private
complaint under the MMDR Act, directly from the authorized officer and take

Saiyed Jiyaulla vs State Of Karnataka on 28 June, 2018
cognizance of the offences either under the MMDR Act or any other penal laws. If any
such complaint is erroneously received and pending, the Special Court has to follow
the procedure as contemplated under Section 201 of Cr.P.C., and return the
complaint for presentation to the proper Court with an endorsement to that effect.
Likewise if any Police report is received the same has to be transferred to the
jurisdictional Magistrate invoking the provisions under Section 228(1)(a) of Cr.P.C.,
for appropriate action. (Para 37(1))
c) The Police cannot file a final report under Section 173 of Cr.P.C., for the offences
under the MMDR Act and KMMC Rules either to the jurisdictional JMFC Court or to
the Special Court. However, they can file the report for the offences under the Indian
Penal Code or any other penal law for the time being in force before the jurisdictional
Magistrate.
(Para 37(2))
d) The jurisdictional Magistrate has no jurisdiction or power to take cognizance for the offence
punishable under the MMDR Act and KMMC Rules on the basis of any police report under Section
173 of Cr.P.C. However, if any penal provisions under the IPC or any other penal laws are available
in the final report of the Police, if there is no other legal bar; the Magistrate can take cognizance of
such offences under the IPC or other penal laws for which he is empowered, except the offences
under MMDR Act and KMMC Rules.
(Para 37(3))
e) A private complaint is only contemplated under the MMDR Act and KMMC Rules and thus it has
to be filed under Section 22 of the Act by the competent authorized officer under the MMDR Act and
KMMC Rules. Even if other offences under any other penal laws, are also included along with
offences under MMDR Act and Rules, the jurisdictional Magistrate, has to take cognizance of the
offences under MMDR Act and KMMC Rules only on the basis of the private complaint even though
other penal laws are also invoked by the authorized officer and after compliance of relevant
provisions of Cr.P.C., the Magistrate has to commit the entire case to the Special Court for trial.
(Para 37(4))
f) The Special Court gets jurisdiction to try the offences under the MMDR Act and KMMC Rules
thereunder including any other offences under any other penal laws for the time being in force only
after the case is committed to it for trial by the jurisdictional Magistrate.
(Para 37(5))
6. In view of the above guildelines laid down by this court, it is clear that the Police would not get
any jurisdiction to register a case under Section 154 Cr.P.C. and investigate the matter, and to file
any report under Section 173 of Cr.P.C., nor the courts have jurisdiction to receive such reports
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72091016/ 4
Saiyed Jiyaulla vs State Of Karnataka on 28 June, 2018
under Section 173 Cr.P.C. and to take cognizance for the offences punishable under Section MMDR
Act, in view of the specific bar under Section 22 of MMDR Act, which contemplates a private
complaint by the competent officer notified by the State Government or the Central Government.
Therefore, in this particular case, registration of the case under the provisions of MMDR Act is bad
in law. However, in the above said decision itself, it is made clear that the Police have got power and
jurisdiction to investigate the offence under Section 379 of IPC. Therefore, to that extent, in my
opinion, the registration of the FIR and investigation by the Police are valid. Therefore, except that,
all investigation pertaining to Section 21(1) of MMDR Act is required to be quashed giving liberty to
the competent officers to file a complaint under Section 22 of MMDR Act, before the competent
Court. In the above circumstances of the case, the following order is passed:
ORDER The petition is partly allowed. Consequently, registration of case in Crime
No. 63/2018 by Harihara Rural Police and all further investigation sofaras the
offence under Section 21(1) of MMDR Act concerned, is hereby quashed. However,
the Police are at liberty to proceed to investigate the offence under Section 379 of IPC
and file appropriate report to the jurisdictional court.
