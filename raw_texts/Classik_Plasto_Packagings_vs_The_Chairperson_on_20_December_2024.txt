JUDGMENT
(Judgment of the Court was delivered by R.SUBRAMANIAN, J.) The appellant was visited with an
award passed by the Facilitation Council constituted under the Micro, Small and Medium
Enterprises Development Act, 2006.
2. Section 18 of the said Act which provides for mediation as well as arbitration of disputes reads as
follows:-
18. Reference to Micro and Small Enterprises Facilitation Council.-
(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force,
any party to a dispute may, with regard to any amount due under section 17, make a
reference to the Micro and Small Enterprises Facilitation Council.
(2) On receipt of a reference under sub-section (1), the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Council shall either itself conduct conciliation in
the matter or seek the assistance of any institution or centre providing alternate
dispute resolution services by making a reference to such an institution or centre, for
conducting conciliation and the provisions of sections 65 to 81 of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996) shall apply to such a dispute as if the conciliation
was initiated under Part III of that Act.
(3) Where the conciliation initiated under sub-section (2) is not successful and stands
terminated without any settlement between the parties, the Council shall either itself
take up the dispute for arbitration or refer it to any institution or centre providing
alternate dispute resolution services for such arbitration and the provisions of the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996) shall then apply to the disputes as
if the arbitration was in pursuance of an arbitration agreement referred to in
sub-section (1) of section 7 of that Act.
(4) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, the Micro and
Small Enterprises Facilitation Council or the centre providing alternate dispute resolution services
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76172442/ 2

shall have jurisdiction to act as an Arbitrator or Conciliator under this section in a dispute between
the supplier located within its jurisdiction and a buyer located anywhere in India.
(5) Every reference made under this section shall be https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis decided
within a period of ninety days from the date of making such a reference.
This clause seeks to provide for the jurisdiction of the Micro and Small Enterprises Facilitation
Council for acting as an arbitrator or conciliator in respect of the matters referred to in clause 17.
(Notes on Clauses). 19. Application for setting aside decree
3. The effect of Section 18 of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 is,
an award passed by the Council becomes an award under the provisions of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996, thus making it subject to challenge under Section 34 of the said enactment
before the competent Court.
4. Section 19 of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 provides for,
challenge to the award should not be entertained by the Court unless the person who has been
directed to pay any amount under the award, deposits with it 75% of the said amount.
5. In order to overcome this difficulty of pre-deposit, the appellant chose to challenge the award
before this Court in W.P.No.24410 of 2023.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis The appellant however chose to withdraw the writ petition and
this Court allowed withdrawal with liberty to move the appropriate Court under Section 34 of the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act. The operative portion of the order of this Court in W.P.No.24410
of 2023 reads as follows:-
2. When it was pointed out that the petitioner cannot invoke the discretionary
jurisdiction of this Court under Article 226 of the Constitution to challenge the order
dated 30.12.2022 in Case No.MSEFC/TRY/18/202 passed by the first respondent
under Section 18 of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act,
2006, in view of the effective alternative remedy available under Section 34 of the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, before the jurisdictional Court as held by the
Hon-ble Supreme Court of India in India Glycols Limited ~Vs~ Micro and Small
Enterprises Facilitation Council, Medchal~Malkajgiri (Order dated 06.11.2023 in
Civil Appeal No.7491 of 2023), Learned Counsel for the petitioner seeks permission
of the Court to withdraw the writ petition with liberty to resort to the aforesaid
procedure, and he has made an endorsement to that effect in the Court record.
In such circumstances, the writ petition is dismissed as withdrawn granting such liberty. It is made
clear that for the purpose of reckoning limitation for availing the aforesaid remedy, the period from
the date of filing of the writ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis petition, viz., 27.04.2023, till the date
on which the certified copy of this order is made ready by the Registry, shall be excluded.
Consequently, the connected miscellaneous petition is closed. No costs.

6. Thereafter, without availing the remedy under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,
the appellant again chose to rush to this Court raising a completely new set of grounds, particularly
one relating to jurisdiction of the Facilitation Council to pass an award.
7. This Court rejected the challenge on the ground that having not raised the issue in the earlier Writ
Petition and having chosen to withdraw it, the appellant cannot re-agitate the issue again before this
Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. Aggrieved the instant appeal.
8. Mr.Ravi Kannan, learned counsel appearing for the appellant would vehemently contend that the
issue relating to inherent lack of jurisdiction can be raised at any time and availability of alternative
remedy by itself cannot bar this Court from entertaining the Writ Petition, particularly when the
issue of jurisdiction is raised.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
9. Though the said submission is very attractive, we do not think we can entertain the said
submission at this stage. The principles of res judicata would apply to proceedings under Article 226
of the Constitution of India also. Explanation IV of Section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure
prevents the Court from dealing with an issue which ought to have been raised in an earlier
proceeding. The fact that the issue relating to jurisdiction was not raised in the earlier Writ Petition
by itself would not enable the appellant to invoke the writ jurisdiction again in view of Explanation
IV to Section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which reads as follows:-
Explanation IV.- Any matter which might and ought to have been made ground of
defence or attack in such former suit shall be deemed to have been a matter directly
and substantially in issue in such suit.
10. The issue of jurisdiction should be deemed to have been matter directly and substantially in
issue in the earlier Writ Petition. Having chosen to withdraw the Writ Petition, the appellant cannot
be allowed to agitate the issue again before us.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
11. Hence, the Writ Appeal fails and it is accordingly dismissed. No costs. Consequently, the
connected miscellaneous petition is closed.
