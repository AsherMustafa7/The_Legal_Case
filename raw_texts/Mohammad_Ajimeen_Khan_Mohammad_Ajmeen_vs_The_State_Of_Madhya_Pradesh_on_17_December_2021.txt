HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
M.Cr.C. No.45223/2021
(Mohammad Ajimeen Khan @ Moh. Ajmeen @ Mubeen Vs. State of M.P. )
Gwalior, Dated:17.12.2021
Shri Sameer Shrivastava, learned counsel for the applicant.
Shri PPS Bajita, learned PP for the respondent/State.
The applicant has filed this first bail application u/S.439 Cr.P.C for grant of bail. Applicant has been
arrested on 17.10.2020 by Police Station Kolaras, District Shivpuri in connection with Crime
No.117/2018 registered for offence under Sections 307, 394, 397, 398, 353, 332 of IPC and Section
11/13 of MPDVPK Act.
It is the submission of learned counsel for the applicant that applicant is suffering confinement since
17.10.2020 and charge- sheet has been filed therefore, chance of tampering with evidence/witness is
remote. It is further submitted that at the relevant point of time, applicant was suffering
incarceration in District Jail Gurugram, Haryana (on alleged date of incident i.e. 23.03.2018) and
therefore, his presence at the place of incident i.e. Kolaras, District Shivpuri is highly improbable.
Confinement amounts to pretrial detention. He undertakes to cooperate in trial. He further
undertakes not to be a source of harassment and embarrassment to the complainant party in any
manner. On these grounds, prayer for bail has been made.
Learned counsel for the State opposed the prayer but fairly submitted that on the basis of status
report dated 28.11.2021 received from Police Station Kolaras, District Shivpuri, in which fact
regarding confinement of applicant for relevant period has been mentioned. On the basis of
aforesaid report which is available on record, counsel for the State fairly informs this Court about
the period of confinement of applicant.
Heard learned counsel for the parties at length and considered the arguments advanced by them.
Considering the submissions and the arguments advanced by counsel for the parties, without
commenting on the merits of the case, this Court intends to allow the present application and it is
hereby directed that the applicant shall be released on bail on his furnishing personal bond of
