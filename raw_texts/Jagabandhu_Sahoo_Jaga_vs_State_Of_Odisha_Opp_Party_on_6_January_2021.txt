omnibus in nature and the materials available on record
indicate that when it was detected that the deceased
attempted to commit suicide by hanging herself, she was
immediately shifted to the hospital, where she was
declared dead by the doctor. It is further submitted that
even though charge sheet has been submitted under
section 302 of the Indian Penal Code, there is no
clinching material in that respect and therefore, the
petitioner's bail application may be favourably
considered.
As per order dated 09.10.2020, learned counsel for
the State was asked to obtain the viscera report as well
as final opinion relating to the cause of death from the
concerned doctor, who conducted post mortem
examination and the reason for which charge sheet has
been submitted under section 302 of the Indian Penal
Code.
Today, learned counsel for the State on instruction
submitted that he has received the viscera report, which
indicates that no poison was detected in the viscera. He
further submitted that a ligature mark around the neck of
the deceased was noticed at the time of post mortem
examination and except such ligature mark, no other
external injury was noticed on the person of the
deceased. He placed the statement of one Pitamber Jena,
the neighbour of the petitioner, who stated about shifting
of the deceased to the hospital.

Considering the submissions of the learned counsel
for the respective parties, nature of accusation against
the petitioner, the surrounding circumstances under
which the deceased died, post mortem report findings,
viscera report and taking into account the period of
detention of the petitioner in judicial custody, I am
inclined to release the petitioner on bail.
Let the petitioner be released on bail in the
aforesaid case on furnishing bail bond of Rs.50,000/-
(rupees fifty thousand) with two local solvent sureties
each for the like amount to the satisfaction of the learned
Court in seisin over the matter with such other conditions
as the learned Court may deem just and proper.
BLAPL is accordingly disposed of.
Issue urgent certified copy as per Rules.
