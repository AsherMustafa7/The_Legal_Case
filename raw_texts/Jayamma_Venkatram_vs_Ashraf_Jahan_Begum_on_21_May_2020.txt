This RFA is filed under Section 96 of CPC against the
judgment and decree dated 02.12.2004 passed in
O.S.No.271/88 on the file of the I Additional City Civil &
Sessions Judge, Bengaluru, CCH No.2, decreeing the suit for

These Regular First Appeals coming on for hearing
this day, the court delivered the following:
JUDGMENT
These two appeals arise from a common judgment dated 2.12.2004 in the original suits 271/1988
and 1281/1989, on the file of first Additional City Civil and Sessions Judge, Bengaluru City.

2. The appellants in both the appeals are the legal representatives of plaintiff No. 2 in O.S.271/1988
and defendant No. 3 in O.S.1281/1989. In O.S.271/1988, originally there were three plaintiffs. After
the death of the first plaintiff, Krishna Murthy, the plaintiffs 2 and 3 continued the suit.
3. Briefly stated, the pleadings in O.S. 271/1988 are as follows : -
The suit property is a bit of land measuring 55 Â½ + 55 ft/2 x 50 + 42/2 feet situate in
20 guntas of land in Sy. No. 6/1 of Mavalli Village, Bengaluru North Taluk, with
boundaries as mentioned in plaint schedule. The plaintiffs claim to be its absolute
owners. The total measurement of land was 3.06 acres. After acquisition of lands on
three occasions for formation of Krumbigal Road, extension of Lalbagh and
formation of the link roads, ultimately there remained 20 guntas of land. The entire
land earlier belonged to plaintiffs' father and after his demise, their mother held the
katha till her death in the year 1947. She let out 1/3 portion of the land in favour of
father of third plaintiff. The plaintiffs 2 and 3 succeeded to the property after their
mother's death and they leased the entire property to the third plaintiff. The plaintiffs
pleaded that the defendants asserted their right over the suit property and tried to
interfere with their possession on 25.6.1987 and 9.1.1988. Therefore they brought the
suit against the defendants claiming declaration of their title and permanent
injunction to restrain the defendants from interfering with their possession.
4. Defendants 1 to 3 did not appear, they were placed ex-parte. Fourth defendant was deleted from
the suit. The fifth defendant contested the suit. She denied the very existence of land in S.No.6/1 of
Mavalli Village and also the identity of the suit property. Besides the pleas with regard to limitation
and suit being bad for non-joinder of necessary parties and misjoinder, she stated that she is the
absolute owner of suit property having purchased it from defendants 1 and 2. The third defendant
being the power of attorney holder of the first and the second defendants executed the sale deed in
her favour. Tracing the title, she stated that the original owner was Ahmed Hussain Sahib. On
23.7.1943, he sold the suit property to a partnership firm called M/s C.M.Jaffer Khan and Brothers.
On 1.6.1947, the said firm was dissolved, and thereafter the suit property was allotted to C.M.Jaffar
Khan. He settled the property in favour of his daughters, i.e., defendants 1 and 2 by executing a
settlement deed on 13.12.1952. She denied to have interfered with plaintiffs possession as she was
actually in possession of suit property.
5. The plaint and the written statement in O.S.1281/1989 are replica of the written statement and
the plaint respectively in O.S.271/1988, but in this suit, only relief claimed was permanent
injunction.
6. There is no need to extract all the issues here, the suit O.S.271/1988 being one for declaration of
title, necessarily, the plaintiffs in the suit have to establish their title apart from holding possession.
The trial court, after examining the oral and documentary evidence, dismissed the suit O.S.271/1988
and decreed O.S.1281/1989. Hence, these two appeals.

7. I have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the appellants and the respondents in both the
appeals. The points that the counsel argued will be contextually referred to in the course of
discussion, however their arguments give rise to following main points for discussion :-
(i) Whether the trial court has correctly held that the title of the plaintiffs 1 and 2 in
O.S.271/1988 is not established?
(ii) Whether the conclusion of the trial court that possession of the suit property is
with the plaintiffs in O.S.1281/1989, is correct?
(iii) Are there grounds to interfere with judgment of the trial court?
Point No. (i)
8. For the sake of convenience, the parties are referred to with respect to their rank in O.S.271/1988.
9. Obviously, the plaintiffs have to establish their title, they cannot depend on weakness of the
defendants. Before examining whether the trial court's findings on the issue relating to title over the
suit property is correct or not, it is necessary to examine its findings on identity of the suit property,
i.e., on issue No.2 in O.S.271/1988.
10. The trial court's conclusion is that identity of suit property is not established. It is held by the
trial court that the plaintiffs describe the suit property to be a revenue land in S.No.6 or 6/1, that
they do not claim the suit property to be a left out bit after acquisition, that the evidence of PW1
shows that the land in S.No.6 of Mavalli was not converted for non-agricultural purposes, that they
do not claim the property to be situated within corporation limits in the form of a site and that no
document is produced to show that there exists 8 guntas of land.
11. Commenting on these findings, it is argued by the appellants/plaintiffs counsel that the trial
court has discussed identity issue without considering the acquisition notification. Applying for
conversion did not arise because of extension of Corporation Limits to include Mavalli Village. He
refers to Ex.P30 and Ex.P37 to argue that the suit property exists. Per contra, the respondents
counsel argued that no property as described by the plaintiffs exists. There is no survey No.6 at all
and therefore identity of suit property is not established at all.
12. It is not possible to accept that identity of suit property is not established. It may be that the
plaintiffs have described the suit property as a revenue land in Sy No.6/1 of Mavalli Village. What
they have stated is that after acquisition of the land in Sy. No.6 on three occasions, there remained
20 guntas of land, and the suit property is a part of it. They might have given survey numbers, but
PW1 who adduced evidence on behalf of plaintiffs admits in the cross-examination that on the date
of suit, the property had come under corporation limits. In the plaint, the property number assigned
by the corporation ought to have been mentioned, but, that itself cannot be a reason for disputing
the identity of the suit property. Ex.P29 is a special note issued by the Corporation of City of
Bengaluru under section 145 of the Corporation Act, 1949 accepting the katha in the name of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/145192023/ 5
Jayamma Venkatram vs Ashraf Jahan Begum on 21 May, 2020
deceased first plaintiff, M.Krishnamurthy in respect of vacant bits of land left over in S.No.6 of
Mavalli Village after acquisition. Suit property is a part of this land. The note as per Ex.P29 was
issued after spot inspection by the Engineer and the Revenue Officer of the Corporation as
evidenced by Ex.P28. PW1 has stated in his examination in chief that the Corporation of the City of
Bengaluru, at the time of enquiry on the application made by the plaintiffs 1 and 2 for change of
katha, gave five numbers A, B, C, D and E to the five sites existing in the remaining land in S. No. 6
and a portion of a site marked 'B' was assigned the number 23 which is the suit property. He has
given its measurement which is as given in the plaint schedule. The evidence of PW1 to this effect
has not been assailed in the cross examination. The contesting defendants claim the very same
property giving another number, enquiry into correctness of which is altogether on a different
footing. But, my conclusion is that the trial court's finding that identity of the suit property is not
established, is not correct.
13. The next question is about title, the entire burden of proving it is on the plaintiffs. The main
documents that PW1 has produced are Ex.P2 to P15, P17, P17A and Ex.P18. Exs. P2 to P4 are the
certified copies of the judgments in a suit and an appeal, and they will be considered little later.
Ex.P5 is the certified extract of 'Khetwar Patrike' of S.No.6/1 a revenue document of the year
1919-1920 which stands in the names of Narayanappa and Nagamma. Ex.P6 is the 'Patta Book'
which stands in the name of M..Krishnappa @ M.Krishnamurthy. In page No.3 of this document, it
is clearly mentioned that there remained 20 guntas of land after acquisition. In the same document
there are entries showing payment of land revenue by the second plaintiff. Ex.P7 indicates that
Kyalanoor Muniswamappa and his wife, Muniyamma @ Tayamma and then M.Krishnappa @
M.Krishnamurthy were the Hakkudars, and also the acquisition of some extent of land.
M.Krishnappa @ M.Krishnamurthy is none other than the deceased first plaintiff. Ex.P8 is the
certified extract of Record of Rights which shows the name of Kyalanoor Muniswamappa, i.e., the
father of plaintiffs 1 and 2 as Hakkudar. There is also an endorsement that Kyalanoor
Muniswamappa obtained possession of the land on the basis of a decree of the court and had held
possession for 10-15 years, and after his death, his wife Muniyamma took over possession. Then
Ex.P17 and Ex.P17A are the documents pertaining to acquisition of lands of Mavalli Village
including Sy. No. 6. These two documents show the name of Kyalanoor Muniswamappa as the
owner. Exs. P9 to P16 appear to be the receipts issued for the land revenue being paid by Kyalanoor
Muniswamappa, his wife and the plaintiffs 1 and 2. If these documents are considered, the prima
facie impression emerging is that the land in S.No.6 belongs to the plaintiffs 1 and 2.
14. The fifth defendant contends that she purchased the property from defendants 1 to 3, who are
the daughters of C.M.Jaffer Khan. They assert that the plaintiffs are laying claim on their property
which bears the number 9/B. DW1 is the sixth defendant who claims to be a purchaser from fifth
defendant. Exs. D1 to D10 are the documents that he has produced to prove his title. Exs.D1 and D2
are the sale deeds executed by defendants 1 to 3 in favour of the fifth defendant. It is stated in the
written statement that C.M.Jaffer Khan settled the property that he got to his share after dissolution
of the partnership firm, in favour of his daughters i.e., defendants 1 to 3 by executing a settlement
deed on 13.12.1952. It is also pleaded in the written statement that one Ahmed Hussain Sahib sold
the property to the firm M/s C.M.Jaffer Khan on 23.7.1943. DW1 has deposed so in the examination
in chief.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/145192023/ 6
Jayamma Venkatram vs Ashraf Jahan Begum on 21 May, 2020
15. It is to be seen whether the documentary evidence produced by DW1 displaces title of the
plaintiffs or not. But before that, if the findings of the trial court are seen, it has held as below : -
Exs. P2, P3, P4 and Exs.P9 to P15 do not help establish existence of plaint schedule
property as also title of second plaintiff over suit property. As to when and how the
katha from the name of the first plaintiff was changed to the name of second plaintiff
is not forthcoming. PW1 has stated in the cross-examination that suit property was
brought under corporation limits and that it was given property No.23. This
admission shows that no revenue land exists. Merely because the eastern boundary of
the suit property is shown as 'Krumbigal road', it is not a conclusive evidence to hold
that suit property is a revenue land. The judgments and decrees in O.S.438/1975 and
RFA 68/1980 do not come to the aid of the plaintiffs and that other documents Exs.
P27 to P29 and Exs. P32 to P34 do not help them. The plaintiffs have tried to prove
their title circumstantially by relying upon previous litigations and old revenue
documents prior to acquisition. It has also assigned some other reasons, but ultimate
conclusion is that title of plaintiffs is not established.
16. The learned counsel for appellants assails these findings by arguing that the trial court has lost
sight of importance of revenue documents that show suit property being owned by plaintiffs 1 and 2,
and earlier to them by their father. He argued that if the documents produced by the plaintiffs are
assessed in juxtaposition with documents relied upon by defendants 5 and 6, it can be inferred
firstly that defendants 5 and 6 are claiming plaintiffs' suit property and secondly that they have not
established their title. The defendants trace their title through a exchange deed said to have been
executed by the corporation in favour of one Y.H.Venkataramanappa, but the judgment in
O.S.438/1975 clearly holds that the corporation had no title over the property that it gave to
Y.H.Venkataramanappa, therefore, any subsequent sale made by Y.H.Venkataramanappa did not
confer good title on his buyer and thus C.M.Jaffer Khan also did not derive any right, title or
interest. The trial court's finding that the judgment in O.S.438/1975 does not bind the fifth
defendant is wrong.
17. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondents argued that the trial court has
correctly appreciated the evidence, its conclusion that the judgment in O.S.438/1975 does not bind
the fifth defendant is correct, as she was a party to that suit. Nobody challenged the exchange deed
executed by the corporation. The exchange deed has not been cancelled, the finding in O.S.438/1975
did not affect the right, title and interest of the fifth defendant. He argued that the plaintiffs have
tried to prove their title based on revenue documents, and it is settled law that the revenue records
do not confer title.
18. On a re-assessment of evidence it is possible to draw certain inferences. It is true that the
plaintiffs have not produced any document like a sale deed or a gift deed, or a exchange deed, etc.,
which establishes transfer intervivos. They have only relied upon revenue documents and
acquisition notifications, reference to which has already been made. The documents very much
denote the land in S.No. 6/1 of Mavalli being in the lineage of plaintiffs family, and nobody
questioned the mutation of revenue records in succession up to second plaintiff. If the Government
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/145192023/ 7
Jayamma Venkatram vs Ashraf Jahan Begum on 21 May, 2020
issued acquisition notifications showing the name of Kyalanoor Muniswamappa as the owner of
land in Sy. No. 6/1, he should be the owner of the land. Issuance of notification for acquisition of
land under the Land Acquisition Act is an official act which gives added weightage to the
presumption available as regards correctness of the revenue entries.
19. Now if the proof made available by the defendants is seen, they seek to rebut the plaintiffs' title
by relying upon sale made in favour of a firm, M/s C.M.Jaffar Khan and Brothers, a settlement deed
executed by C.M.Jaffer Khan and sale deeds executed by defendants 1 to 3 in favour of fifth
defendant. In this context Exs. P2 to P4 assume importance.
20. Ex.P2 is the certified copy of the judgment in O.S.438/1975, a suit filed by Smt. Zahirunnissa
Rafia Begum, against Sri Raju and Others for declaration of her title over and possession of property
No. 9/B of Krumbigal Road, Bengaluru City. This Zahirunnisa @ Rafia Begum is the first defendant
in O.S.271/1988. In her suit she stated that her father C.M.Jaffer Khan executed a settlement deed
on 15.12.1952 in her favour and her sister's favour. She traced the title of the property No. 9/B to one
Y.H.Venkataramanappa and Y.H.Kempanna. Her plea was that the City Corporation exchanged its
property i.e., 9/B with Y.H.Venkataramanappa and thus he became its absolute owner. The court
held that the corporation had no right over property No.9/B in order to exchange it with
Y.H.Venkataramanappa and therefore all subsequent transactions were bad. In para 13 of Ex.P2,
there is a clear finding that property which was towards the West of Krumbigal Road was part of S.
No. 6/1 of Mavalli Village belonging to predecessor in title of defendants 1 to 3, who are plaintiffs 1
and 2 in O.S.271/1988. Since the suit O.S.438/1975 was dismissed, Zahirunnissa @ Rafia Begum
appealed to this court in RFA 68/1980. This court by order dated 19.11.1991, framed an additional
issue and directed the trial court to record evidence on the additional issue and give its finding. The
suit O.S.438/1975 was renumbered as O.S.7367/1991 after its transfer to the City Civil Court, and
the Principal City Civil Judge, who gave his findings on the additional issue as per Ex.P3 held that
the City Corporation had no right over the property that it gave in exchange to
Y.H.Venkataramanappa. As Ex.P4 shows, this court, in RFA 68/1980, accepted the finding on the
additional issue and further found that after dissolution of the firm M/s Jaffer Khan and Brothers,
the property 9/B was actually allotted to C.M.Abdul Gaffer Khan, and not C.M.Jaffer Khan. There is
a clear observation in para 25 of Ex.P4 that the counsel for the appellant in RFA 68/1980 very fairly
conceded that the plaintiffs (appellants in RFA 68/1980) had failed to establish their title.
Ultimately this court dismissed the said appeal. This judgment has become final.
21. The trial court has held that the judgment in O.S.438/1975 and RFA 68/1980 do not bind the
defendants 5 and 6 as they were not parties to those proceedings. This finding is incorrect. For, the
defendant No.5 is a purchaser from the plaintiff in O.S.438/1975. One of the defendants in this suit,
M.Raju, is a purchaser of a site formed in 8 guntas of land in S.No.6/1 from the second plaintiff in
the case on hand. Therefore, the fifth defendant, being the successor in interest of Zahirunnisa @
Rafia Begum is bound by the judgment in O.S.438/1975 and RFA 68/1980. Thus P2 and P4 assume
relevancy according to section 40 of the Indian Evidence Act which is akin to section 11 of the Civil
Procedure Code. Therefore what ultimately transpires is that the fifth defendant derived no title over
a property which according to her bears No. 9/B, and consequently the sixth defendant who
happens to be a purchaser pendente lite, derives no right. In fact, the sixth defendant adduced
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/145192023/ 8
Jayamma Venkatram vs Ashraf Jahan Begum on 21 May, 2020
evidence as DW1 and one answer given by him in the cross examination shows that after he came to
know about pendency of litigation, he asked his vendor to return sale consideration money to him.
From this answer an inference is possible to be drawn that he might have entertained doubt with
regard to title of his vendor. Actually his evidence is of no use. The conclusion is that the defendants
have failed to rebut the evidence placed by the plaintiffs in proof of their title.
22. The next question is, whether based on revenue documents, title of the plaintiffs can be
declared? It is no doubt a settled position that revenue documents do not confer any title. But here is
a case where the plaintiffs can produce no document other than revenue records to prove their title.
As has been observed already, the Government issued acquisition notification showing Kyalanoor
Muniswamappa as the owner of S. No. 6/1 which adds weightage to the presumptive value
attachable to revenue entries. Therefore, I am of the opinion that whenever a person has been in
possession of an immovable property, especially ancestral in character, for quite a long time, and
revenue entries stand in the lineage of his family continuously without any challenge to it, or if
challenged, the same being overruled or rejected; and being not in a position to produce any
document conferring title other than revenue records, there is no impediment to declare title based
on possession which is otherwise called possessory title. If this kind of interpretation is not given,
the title over a property will remain in vacuum, which should not be allowed to happen. Thus
looked, the possessory title of plaintiffs 1 and 2 can be declared. The trial court's findings are not at
all acceptable; its approach appears to be perverse; it has just proceeded on identity of the property
without evaluating the intricacies. Therefore, point (i) is answered in the negative.
Point No. (ii)
23. The trial court has held that possession is not with the plaintiffs. As plaintiff No.3 who is said to
be tenant of plaintiffs 1 and 2 is not examined as a witness, possession of suit property cannot be
inferred to be with them. Another finding is that according to plaintiffs 1 and 2, there is a cow shed,
but the suit property is vacant land. There is no document evidencing suit property being leased to
plaintiff No.3.
24. Again it is a wrong finding. It may be that the plaintiffs 1 and 2 pleaded that they had leased the
suit property to plaintiff No.3. Non-examination of plaintiff No.3 as a witness has no consequence as
what is important, when title is sought to be declared, in the background of circumstances made out,
is dejure possession. Exs.P76 and P78 are the rent agreements which the trial court has ignored to
consider. Perusal of these two documents show that the third plaintiff was allowed to have a shed in
a portion of suit land, and he was also entrusted with the responsibility of supervising the remaining
vacant land. PW1 asserts in his cross- examination that suit property is vacant. The photographs
marked Exs.P50 to P52 with their negatives show that there is temporary shed like structure where
cows are tethered and the remaining land being vacant. Therefore, possession was with the plaintiffs
1 and 2 when suit was filed. PW1 has spoken about interference by the defendants. In fact the tenor
indicates their intention to interfere with plaintiffs' possession. Therefore, the trial court ought to
have held that the possession of suit property was with plaintiffs and that there was interference
with their possession. Point No. (ii) is answered in negative.

Jayamma Venkatram vs Ashraf Jahan Begum on 21 May, 2020
25. Having answered points (i) and (ii), I find that section 110 of the Indian Evidence Act may be
referred to here to give ultimate conclusion as regards title over the suit property. Section 110 reads :
-
"110. Burden of proof as to ownership.--When the question is whether any person is
owner of anything of which he is shown to be in possession, the burden of proving
that he is not the owner is on the person who affirms that he is not the owner".
26. The possession of the suit property is found to be with the plaintiffs. The question is as regards
their ownership. Though I began the discussion on point No.
(i) holding that the initial burden was on the plaintiffs to prove their title, ultimately the possession
was found to be with the plaintiffs and therefore the actual burden, if Section 110 of the Evidence
Act is applied, was on the defendants to prove that the plaintiffs are not the owners of the suit
property. The foregoing discussion shows on one hand that they have failed to prove it, and on the
other hand to establish their title also. Hence as between the plaintiffs and the defendants, the
former's title would get established, but it is not so as against a person who may be having better
title than the plaintiffs. In this context reference to a judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of
Somanath Burman vs Dr.S.P.Raju and Another [(1969) 3 SCC 129] may be made. It is held : -
"9. .... Possessory title is a good title as against everybody other than the lawful
owner. In Ismail Arriff v. Mahomed Ghouse [ILR 20 IA 99], the Judicial Committee
came to the conclusion that a person having possessary title can get a declaration that
he was the owner of the land in suit and an injunction restraining the defendant from
interfering with his possession. Therein it was observed that the possession of the
plaintiff was a sufficient evidence of title as owner against the defendant."
27. Following what the Supreme Court has held, it can be said that there is no impediment for
declaring the title of the plaintiffs in the facts and circumstances.
28. There are three more points to be adverted to. The trial court has observed that after the death of
plaintiff No.1, his legal representatives were not brought on record and that plaintiff No.2 alone
could not have prosecuted the suit. PW1 while deposing stated that the plaintiff had executed a
family arrangement deed on 1.11.1973 confirming entire management of suit property on second
plaintiff. But he stated in the cross- examination that the said family arrangement had no bearing on
the suit. This is the reason for the trial court holding that the legal representatives of the first
plaintiff should have been brought on record. This reason appears to be not correct, for whether or
not there was any family arrangement, if one of the plaintiffs dies and his legal representatives do
not come on record, the surviving plaintiff can prosecute according to Order XXII Rule 3 of CPC. If
the first plaintiff died leaving behind him legal representatives, they would have made an
application to come on record in the suit. But nobody made any application. This reason alone
cannot jeopardize the right of other plaintiffs. In this case PW1 speaks about family arrangement
dated 1.11.1973, and if it is in force, the legal representatives of the first plaintiff may not get any
right; if not, they can still assert their right. Therefore, death of first plaintiff has no effect of abating

the entire suit.
29. Learned counsel for the respondents argued that the suit was time barred. He referred to Ex.P62
dated 2.3.1964 which indicates that the applicant, i.e., the first plaintiff might seek redress in a court
of law for registration of katha in respect of two plots. The appellants' counsel argued that the suit
was within time, the suit for declaration has to be filed within three years from the date when the
right to sue first accrues. He has relied upon a judgment of Division Bench of this court in the case
of State of Karnataka vs Mohammed Kunhi [ILR 1991 KAR 1500].
30. In O.S.271/1988, there is no issue with regard to limitation, however it is urged for the first time
at the appellate stage. It is true that Ex.P62 shows such an observation as referred to above. In the
plaint, the cause of action is stated to have arisen on 18.10.1985, 25.6.1987 and 8.1.1988. What is
stated in the plaint is that the defendants 1 to 3 attempted to enter upon the schedule property in the
year 1985 and there were similar attempts on 25.6.1987 and 8.1.1988. Ex.P62 does not indicate
whether any objection had been raised by defendants 1 to 3 for entering katha in the name of
plaintiffs, and if any objection had been taken by them, as argued by counsel for respondents, it can
be said that the cause of action arose on the date of Ex.P62. Since nothing is forthcoming, the cause
of action can be taken to have arisen first on 18.10.1985. The possession has been with the plaintiffs;
suit for declaration may be filed when there is real threat to plaintiffs right. In the case of
Mohammed Kunhi (supra), the Division Bench has extracted what the Supreme Court has held in
the case of Mst. Rukhmabai vs Lala Laxminarayan and Others [AIR 1960 SC 335].
"The legal position may be briefly stated thus : The right to sue under Article 120 of
the Limitation Act accrues when the defendant has clearly and unequivocally
threatened to infringe the right asserted by the plaintiff in the suit. Every threat by a
party to such a right, however ineffective and innocuous it may be, cannot be
considered to be a clear and unequivocal threat so as to compel him to file a suit.
Whether a particular threat gives rise to a compulsory cause of action depends upon
the question whether the threat effectively invades or jeopardizes the said right".
31. Here in this case, the plaintiffs state that cause of action arose when the defendants 1 to 3
invaded on the rights of plaintiffs. The suit was filed within three years from that date.
32. The plaintiffs appear to have not valued the suit correctly. They valued the suit property applying
section 7 of the Karnataka Court Fee and Suits Valuation Act treating it as an agricultural land. But
by the time suit was filed, the suit property was no more an agricultural land and it had been
brought under corporation limits. Therefore, court fee should have been paid on actual market
value. The appellants counsel also submitted that the plaintiffs are ready to pay the court fee. For
this reason, the plaintiffs may be directed to value the suit as also these appeals properly and make
good the deficit court fee.
Point No. (iii)

Jayamma Venkatram vs Ashraf Jahan Begum on 21 May, 2020
33. From the foregoing discussion, I hold that the trial court's findings are unacceptable. Its
approach appears to be perfunctory; there is no proper appreciation of evidence and application of
mind to the facts and circumstances. Therefore, the judgments in both the suits are to be set aside.
Hence, the following order:-
(i) RFA 170/2005 is allowed, the judgment and decree in O.S.1281/1989 is set aside,
the suit is dismissed.
(ii) RFA 171/2005 is allowed, the judgment and decree in O.S.271/1988 is set aside.
The suit is decreed in terms of the first and second reliefs claimed in the plaint.
(iii) The appellants are directed to make good the deficit court fee within four weeks
from today by valuing the suit O.S.271/1988 on the actual market value of the suit
property as on the date of filing of the suit. The subject matter of the appeal, RFA
171/2005 shall also be revalued and the deficit court fee shall be paid within four
weeks from today. Decree shall be drawn only after payment of deficit court fee.
(iv) The appellants are entitled to costs throughout.
