Smt. K L Susheela vs Ksrtc on 1 December, 2020
JUDGMENT
This appeal is filed by the claimants seeking enhancement of compensation awarded by the Court of
the District Judge, Additional Motor Accident Claims Tribunal II (hereinafter referred to as 'the
Tribunal'), I Fast Track Court, Shimoga, in MVC No.132/2010.
2. The parties shall henceforth be referred to as they were arrayed before the Tribunal.
3. The records of the Tribunal reveal that on 10.04.2004, Sri K.S. Laxmana, who was working as a
Constable in Karnataka State Reserve Police, was riding his motorcycle bearing registration
No.KA-14-R-7021 with his colleague, Sri Siddaraju, riding pillion from Malavagoppa to Shimoga
City. At about 11:45 a.m., a bus bearing registration No.KA-09-D-7227 (hereinafter referred to as
'the offending bus'), which was driven in a rash and negligent manner, came from the opposite
direction and dashed against the motorcycle. As a result, the said K.S.Laxmana sustained grievous
injuries and died at the spot. The claimants are the legal representatives of the deceased
K.S.Laxmana, who filed a claim petition under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 claiming
compensation of Rs.15,00,000/-. They claimed that as a result of the death of the said K.S.
Laxmana, they were deprived of the emotional and financial support and claimant No.1 lost
consortium of K.S. Laxmana. They further stated that the said Mr. K.S. Laxmana was drawing a
monthly salary of Rs.6,456/-.
4. Respondent No.1, who was the owner of the offending bus, contested the claim petition by
denying the averments made therein. Respondent No.1 stated that a Firm by name Lakshmi Carriers
(R), Mysore, was the owner of the offending bus and it was a necessary party to the claim petition. It
referred to an agreement dated 25.11.2002 entered into between respondent No.1 and the said Firm
by which it had taken the offending bus on lease. It thus claimed that it was neither the owner nor
insurer of the offending bus. However, it accused the deceased K.S.Laxman of negligence in driving
the motorcycle.
5. Respondent No.4, who is the insurer of the offending bus, also contested the claim petition by
denying the averments of the claim petition. It contended that respondent No.2 had leased the
offending bus from respondent No.1 as on the date of the accident and as the offending bus was in
exclusive control of respondent No.1, it was the owner of the offending Bus under Section 2(30) of
the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. It contended that it was not a party to the contract between
respondent No.1 - KSRTC and the owner of the offending bus and therefore, it was not liable to pay
the compensation to claimants.
6. Based on the aforesaid rival contentions, the claim petition was set down for trial. The claimant
was examined as PW.1 and she marked Exs.P1 to P8 and the insurer examined its officer as RW.1
and another witness as RW.2 and they marked Exs.R1 to R4.
7. The Tribunal found support from Exs.P2, P3, P4, P5 and P6 which indicated that the complaint
was lodged against the driver of the offending bus and held that the driver of the offending bus was
rash and negligent in driving the bus and causing the accident.

8. In so far as the claim for compensation is concerned, the Tribunal on the basis of Ex.P8 - salary
certificate noticed that the deceased was drawing a salary of Rs.6,456/- and after deducting the
professional tax, his monthly income was Rs.6,396/-. The Tribunal deducted 1/3rd of the said
amount towards living expenses of the deceased and applied the appropriate multiplier of 15 and
awarded a sum of Rs.7,67,520/- towards loss of dependency and additional sum of Rs.35,000/-
under the conventional heads as follows:
Heads under which Amount
compensation is awarded (In Rupees)
a. Loss of annual dependency 7,67,520/-
b. For loss of consortium 10,000/-
c. Loss of estate 10,000/-
d. Loss of love and affection to 10,000/-
petitioners 2 and 3 at Rs.5,000/-
each
e. Funeral expenses and transportation 5,000/-
of dead body
TOTAL 8,02,520/-
The Tribunal awarded the aforesaid compensation with interest at 6% per annum from the date of
the petition till the date of payment. In so far as the liability to pay the compensation is concerned,
the Tribunal held that it was respondent No.1, who was liable to pay the compensation and
dismissed the case against the insurer.
9. Feeling aggrieved by the quantum of compensation awarded by the Tribunal, the claimants have
filed this appeal.
10. Learned counsel for appellants contends that the Tribunal ought to have awarded loss of future
prospects as the deceased was a Government servant and there was proof of the income in the form
of Ex.P8, which was the salary certificate. He also contended that the Tribunal ought to have
considered the deduction of 1/4th of the income of the deceased towards his personal expenses
instead of 1/3rd. Learned counsel brought to the notice of the Court the Judgment dated 09.04.2012
passed in the appeals arising out of claim petitions filed by injured travelling in the offending bus
i.e., in MFA No.8473/2010 and companion matters and MFA No.10709/2010 filed by respondent
No.1 herein challenging the Judgment and Award impugned in the present appeal, wherein this
Court had directed that the insurer of the offending bus should pay the compensation.
11. The learned counsel for the insurer of the offending bus (respondent No.4 herein) did not dispute
the fact that in view of the Judgment dated 09.04.2012 passed by this Court in MFA
No.10709/2010, the liability to pay the compensation awarded by the Tribunal was fastened on it.
This Judgment passed in MFA No.10709/2010 has attained finality and therefore, it is imperative
that in this appeal too, the liability to pay the compensation that may be determined by this Court, is
fixed on the insurer - respondent No.4 in this appeal.

12. In so far as the claim for enhancement of compensation is concerned, as rightly contended by the
claimants, the Tribunal has not awarded compensation towards loss of future prospects. Having
regard to the fact that the deceased was 38 years and had a clear 22 years of remaining service
during which time, the income of the deceased would have increased, addition of future prospects to
the income of the deceased should have been made by the Tribunal while computing the
compensation towards loss of dependency. Therefore, having regard to the judgment of the Apex
Court in the case of National Insurance Company Limited vs. Pranay Sethi reported in (2017) 16
SCC 680, claimants are entitled to loss of future prospects of the income of the deceased. If the loss
of future prospects is granted to the deceased, then the compensation awarded by the Tribunal
deserves to be reconsidered and recalculated as follows:
Heads under which compensation Amount is awarded (In Rupees) Loss of
dependency 11,51,280/- (Rs.6396 + future prospects at 50% = Rs.9594/-; after
deducting 1/3rd, Rs.9594 - Rs.3198 = Rs.6396/-) (Rs.6396 x 12 x 15) Loss of
consortium for claimant No.1 25,000/-
Loss of estate 25,000/-
Loss of love and affection for claimant 20,000/-
Nos.2 and 3 at Rs.10,000/- each
Funeral expenses and transportation 5,000/-
of dead body
TOTAL 12,26,280/-
13. In view of the above, this Appeal is allowed in part. The impugned Judgment and
Award passed by the Tribunal is modified and the compensation awarded to the
claimants is enhanced from Rs.8,02,520/- to Rs.12,26,280/-, which is payable by the
insurer -
respondent No.4 herein along with interest at 6% per annum from the date of the claim petition till
the date of realization.
14. Respondent No.4 - insurer is directed to deposit the enhanced compensation with interest as
stated above within one month from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this Judgment.
15. Upon deposit, 50% of the compensation shall be kept in a fixed deposit in the names of claimant
Nos.2 and 3 in a nationalized Bank for a period of three years and the remaining 50% shall be
released to claimant No.1.
