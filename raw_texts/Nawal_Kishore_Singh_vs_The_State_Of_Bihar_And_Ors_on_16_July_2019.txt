subsistence allowance. One Judicial Officer has been
appointed as an Inquiry Officer and another Judicial
Officer has been made a Presenting Officer. The venue
and timing of enquiry has also been indicated in the
aforesaid order.
2. The further prayer of the petitioner is for his
reinstatement on the post of Clerk in the Judgeship of
Nalanda.
3. The major challenge to the aforesaid order is
on the ground that the learned District Judge, Nalanda,
who is the Disciplinary Authority has exceeded the brief
in as much as the Appellate Authority i.e. the High Court
had directed him to conclude the enquiry from the stage
of Inquiry Report and had not directed him to initiate a
de novo enquiry.
4. The other ground of challenge is that such de
novo enquiry is not permissible in the eyes of law.
5. The petitioner was appointed as an Assistant in
the Judgeship of Nalanda at Biharsharif on 21.03.1985

and his services were confirmed on 19.04.1999. While
the petitioner was posted as Office Clerk with 2 nd

Nawal Kishore Singh vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 16 July, 2019
Additional Sessions Judge, Nalanda, a memo dated
05.12.1997
was received in the Court of the learned 2 nd Additional Sessions Judge, Nalanda, containing an
order dated 30.11.1997 passed by the High Court in Cr. Appeal No. 582 of 1987. In the light of the
aforesaid order of the High Court, the Presiding Officer dictated the order of bail to an accused and
on the same day, the bail bonds of that accused was also filed and accepted. The matter rested there.
At the time of final hearing of Criminal Appeal No. 582 of 1987 on 31.07.2002, the High Court was
informed that one of the accused/appellant/Ramashish Singh had been released on bail in the year
1988. A report, thus was called for from the 2nd Additional Sessions Judge, Nalanda as to under
what circumstances, the aforesaid accused/ appellant/Ramashish Singh was released on bail when
his bail had been earlier rejected.
Patna High Court CWJC No.5581 of 2017 dt.16-07-2019
6. It transpired that a fraud was played with the Court and an effort was made to identity the office
Clerk.
7. It is in this background that a departmental proceeding was initiated against the petitioner who
was served with a memo of charge on 06.08.2002.
8. It has been urged on behalf of the petitioner that with the memo of charge, no document or list of
witnesses or evidence in support of the charge was ever served upon him. The petitioner was asked
to reply to the show cause and an Inquiry Officer was appointed. No Presenting Officer however was
named.
9. During the enquiry, only some of the documents which were asked by the petitioner to be
furnished to him were supplied and the request for the other documents was rejected. In the
enquiry, no oral evidence was taken.
10. The Inquiry Officer submitted his report on 03.10.2002 holding the petitioner guilty of the
charge. The aforesaid report was accepted by the Disciplinary Patna High Court CWJC No.5581 of
2017 dt.16-07-2019 Authority, who vide order dated 08.10.2002 dismissed the petitioner from
service.
11. It has been argued on behalf of the petitioner that neither the copy of the Inquiry Report was
supplied to him nor was he asked to show cause on any proposed punishment. The appeal of the
petitioner was also rejected on 12.07.2005.
12. The petitioner thereafter approached this Court vide C.W.J.C. No. 9369 of 2005 against the
order of dismissal and rejection of appeal. The aforesaid writ petition was disposed of by judgment
dated 19.09.2014 holding as follows:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/175552415/ 3
Nawal Kishore Singh vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 16 July, 2019
"In the circumstances, this Court is of the opinion that the matter requires
reconsideration by the Appellate Authority in the light of the pleadings and grounds
taken by the petitioner in his memo of appeal in respect of procedural irregularities
etc. and the submissions made by the learned counsel in support of them before the
Court and noticed above. Since in his memo of appeal, petitioner has specifically
raised the Patna High Court CWJC No.5581 of 2017 dt.16-07-2019 issue that enquiry
report was not supplied to him and he was not given opportunity to meet the findings
in the report against him before he was awarded punishment on that basis, about
which admittedly no attention was drawn of the Appellate Authority by the District &
Sessions Judge in his parawise comments, this Court is of the opinion that it must be
considered by the Appellate Authority at the first instance, before any plea of the
respondents under 'no prejudice' theory, propounded by the Apex Court in ECIL
(supra), should be considered by this Court. This Court is of the opinion that, had the
petitioner not raised that issue in his memo of appeal and would have raised it for the
first time before this Court, then only this Court, in terms of the said judgment of the
Apex Court, was required to apply 'no prejudice' theory and confront the petitioner
with the enquiry report and call upon him to establish prejudice caused to him. But
once he raised this plea before the Appellate Authority, it was under legal obligation
to consider it first.
15. As a result, this application is allowed. Order of the Appellate Authority, as Patna
High Court CWJC No.5581 of 2017 dt.16-07-2019 communicated to the petitioner
through the letter of the District & Sessions Judge, Nalanda dated 12.07.2005,
contained in Annexure-15, is set aside and the matter is remitted back to the
Appellate Authority for reconsideration of the appeal of the petitioner afresh."
13. Thereafter, the petitioner filed a representation before the Registrar General, Patna High Court
on 14.10.2014 for his reinstatement in service which was rejected vide order dated 18.09.2015 and
communicated to him by the order of the District Judge, Nalanda on 24.09.2015.
14. The petitioner again challenged the aforesaid rejection of his representation for reinstatement
vide C.W.J.C. No. 19762 of 2015 in which a Bench of this Court directed for filing of counter
affidavit. The aforesaid writ petition is still pending.
15. It has been submitted by the petitioner that he was never informed about the result of the appeal
preferred by him against the order dated 19.09.2014 Patna High Court CWJC No.5581 of 2017
dt.16-07-2019 passed in C.W.J.C. No. 9369 of 2005. However, the petitioner was communicated
vide letter dated 14.09.2016 contained in memo No. 6469 that a copy of the Inquiry Report along
with the order dated 12.09.2016 is being sent to him.
16. The petitioner received the Inquiry Report as also the order dated 12.09.2016 passed by the
learned District Judge, Nalanda.

Nawal Kishore Singh vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 16 July, 2019
17. The order dated 12.09.2016 indicates that the case of the petitioner has been remanded to the
Disciplinary Authority with a direction to complete the enquiry against the petitioner from the stage
of submission of the Inquiry Report i.e. for supplying copy of the Inquiry Report and supply of the
second show cause notice. The petitioner thereafter submitted his second show cause reply.
18. The Disciplinary Authority, vide order dated 04.04.2017 (impugned order) found that the entire
departmental proceeding against the petitioner was Patna High Court CWJC No.5581 of 2017
dt.16-07-2019 conducted without following the rules of domestic enquiry and therefore rejected the
Inquiry Report as unsustainable in the eyes of law and directed for de novo enquiry with a new
Inquiry Officer and a Presenting Officer.
19. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner has argued that the Disciplinary Authority did
not consider the second show cause reply of the petitioner and directed for a de novo enquiry which
was neither permissible nor desirable. It has further been submitted that the Disciplinary Authority
exceeded his jurisdiction and directed for a de novo enquiry in teeth of the decision of the High
Court in appeal to continue the departmental proceeding from the stage of the Inquiry Report and
giving of opportunity of the petitioner to file his reply to the second show cause.
20. In support of the aforesaid contention, learned counsel for the petitioner cited Vijay Shankar
Pandey versus Union of India & Another AIR 215 Patna High Court CWJC No.5581 of 2017
dt.16-07-2019 SC 326; Jammu & Kashmir Bank versus B.R.Gupta AIR 1994 SC 1515; State of Gujrat
versus Shantilal Mangaldas & Others AIR 1969 SC 634; Union of India versus K.D. Pandey &
Another (2002) 10 SCC 471.
21. On behalf of the respondents, it has been submitted that in obedience to the order passed by the
High Court for starting a disciplinary proceeding from the stage of the Inquiry Report and
furnishing of second show cause notice to the petitioner, the same was done by the Disciplinary
Authority. Admittedly, the Inquiry Report was furnished to the petitioner and he was asked to
submit his show cause reply, which he replied. The Disciplinary Authority thereafter was of the view
that the enquiry was not conducted properly and that the petitioner did not get a fair deal and
therefore set aside such Inquiry Report and directed for a de novo enquiry with a new Inquiry
Officer and a Presenting Officer. Be it noted that in the earlier enquiry, there was no Presenting
Patna High Court CWJC No.5581 of 2017 dt.16-07-2019 Officer and no oral evidence was led.
22. It has further been submitted that ordering for de novo enquiry is not prohibited in all
circumstances and if it is found that the Inquiry Report is defective to the marrow, there is no
complete proscription in directing for a de novo/fresh enquiry.
23. It has also been submitted that the Inquiry Report did not exonerate the petitioner for him to
raise the grievance of harassment. In fact, the order by which the Inquiry Report has been set aside,
is heavily loaded in favour of the petitioner.
24. Lastly, it has been submitted that the Disciplinary Authority did not exceed his jurisdiction and
only after observing and following the order of the Appellate Authority i.e. the High Court, the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/175552415/ 5
Nawal Kishore Singh vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 16 July, 2019
proceeding began from the stage of Inquiry Report but the Inquiry Report was not found to be
satisfactory and therefore the same was quashed.
25. The learned counsel appearing for the Patna High Court CWJC No.5581 of 2017 dt.16-07-2019
respondents has drawn the attention of this Court to the decisions rendered in Anant R. Kulkarni
versus Y.P. Education Society & Others (2013) 6 SCC 515 and Nand Kumar Verma versus State of
Jharkhand & Others (2012) 3 SCC 580, which lay down that there is no complete bar to any second/
de novo enquiry. If a proceeding is quashed on technical ground, fresh enquiry is permissible.
26. From the perusal of the documents and the submissions advanced on behalf of the parties, I am
of the view that no fault could be found with the order of the Disciplinary Authority in setting aside
the Inquiry Report and directing for a de novo enquiry.
27. In the case in hand, the Inquiry Report was based on no material. The procedural formalities
were also not found to have been complied with. Basing opinion on such Inquiry Report would have
been prejudicial to the interest of the petitioner and the entire process would have had to be
undergone again. Patna High Court CWJC No.5581 of 2017 dt.16-07-2019
28. There is no reason why any grievance should be raised by the petitioner with the aforesaid de
novo enquiry when the earlier Inquiry Report is against the petitioner.
29. On general principle of law, only one enquiry is conceived of with respect to a charge of a
particular misconduct.
30. In Union of India versus K.D. Pandey (supra), the Inquiry Report was found to have contained
specific findings in favour of the employee and the Disciplinary Authority, only on finding that in the
Inquiry Report, the employer did not have the opportunity of leading evidence and that the findings
were perverse, remitted the matter for a further enquiry. This was found to be unjustified as it
amounted to a second enquiry on the same set of charges resulting in an abuse of process. It was in
this context that it was held that the Disciplinary Authority was not justified in rejecting the Inquiry
Report as it did not appeal to it as being Patna High Court CWJC No.5581 of 2017 dt.16-07-2019
unjustified. However, in later pronouncements of the Supreme Court (refer to Bhupinder Pal Singh
versus D.G. Civil Aviation (2003) 3 SCC 636; UP Cooperative Federation Limited versus L.P. Rai
(2007) 7 SCC 81, State of Assam versus J.N. Rao Viswas AIR 1975 SC 2277 and Anand Narayan
Shukla versus State of MP AIR 1975 SC 1923 ), it has been held that where the enquiry is found to be
defective, the employer has a right to hold a fresh enquiry, particularly in view of seriousness of the
charge. If for some technical, procedural or some other reasons, the enquiry is found to be bad,
there is no principle of law that a second enquiry cannot be launched.
31. The rule of law therefore is that a disciplinary proceeding can be initiated from the stage where
the infirmity in the proceedings creeps in.
32. In Anant R Kulkarni (supra), the Supreme Court in paragraphs 13 and 14 held as follows:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/175552415/ 6
Nawal Kishore Singh vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 16 July, 2019
"13. It is settled legal proposition that Patna High Court CWJC No.5581 of 2017
dt.16-07-2019 once the court sets aside an order of punishment on the ground that
the enquiry was not properly conducted, the court should not severely preclude the
employer from holding the inquiry in accordance with law. It must remit the case
concerned to the disciplinary authority to conduct the enquiry from the point that it
stood vitiated, and to conclude the same in accordance with law. However, resorting
to such a course depends upon the gravity of delinquency involved. Thus, the court
must examine the magnitude of misconduct alleged against the delinquent employee.
It is in view of this that courts/tribunals are not competent to quash the charge-sheet
and related disciplinary proceedings before the same are concluded on the
aforementioned grounds. (Vide ECIL v. B. Karunakar Hiran Mayee Bhattacharyya v.
S.M. School for Girls, U.P. State Spg. Co. Ltd. v. R.S. Pandey and Union of India v.
Y.S. Sadhu.)
14. The court/tribunal should not generally set aside the departmental enquiry, and
quash the charges on the ground of delay in initiation of disciplinary Patna High
Court CWJC No.5581 of 2017 dt.16-07-2019 proceedings, as such a power if dehors
the limits of judicial review. In the event that the court/tribunal exercises such
power, it exceeds its power of judicial review at the very threshold. Therefore, a
charge-sheet or show-cause notice, issued in the course of disciplinary proceedings,
cannot ordinarily be quashed by the court. The same principle is applicable in
relation to there being a delay in conclusion of disciplinary proceedings. The facts
and circumstances of the case in question must be carefully examined taking into
consideration the gravity/magnitude of the charges involved therein. The Court has
to consider the seriousness and magnitude the charges and while doing so the court
must weigh all the facts, both for and against the delinquent officers and come to the
conclusion which is just and proper considering the circumstances involved. The
essence of the matter is that the court must take into consideration all relevant facts,
and balance and weigh the same, so as to determine, if it is in fact in the interest of
clean and honest administration that the said proceedings are allowed to be Patna
High Court CWJC No.5581 of 2017 dt.16-07-2019 terminated only on the ground of
delay in their conclusion. (Vide State of U.P. v. Brahm Datt Sharma, State of M.P. v.
Bani Singh, State of Punjab v. Chaman Lal Goyal, State of A.P. v. N. Radhakishan,
M.V. Bijlani v. Union of India, Union of India v. Kunisetty Satyanarayan, Ministry of
Defence v. Prabhash Chandra Mirdha and LIC v. A. Masilamani.)"
33. Similar views have been expressed by the Supreme Court in Nand Kumar Verma (supra) in
paragraph 26:
"26. In our opinion, having accepted the explanations and having communicated the
same to the appellant, the High Court could not have proceeded to pass the order of
initiating departmental proceedings and reverting the appellant from the post of
Chief Judicial Magistrate to the post of Munsif. On general principles, there can be
only one enquiry in respect of a charge for a particular misconduct and that is also
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/175552415/ 7
Nawal Kishore Singh vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 16 July, 2019
what the rules usually provide. If, for some technical or other good ground,
procedural or otherwise, the first enquiry or punishment or exoneration is found bad
in Patna High Court CWJC No.5581 of 2017 dt.16-07-2019 law, there is no principle
that a second enquiry cannot be initiated. Therefore, when a completed enquiry
proceedings is set aside by a competent forum on a technical or on the ground of
procedural infirmity, fresh proceedings on the same charge is permissible."
34. From the facts of this case, there cannot be any doubt that the charge against the petitioner is
very serious and therefore every opportunity must be given to the petitioner to bring forth materials
in his defence.
35. This Court further finds that the infirmity had crept in the departmental proceedings at the stage
of enquiry and therefore a fresh/de novo enquiry only serves the interest of the petitioner as also of
the organization.
36. There is no prejudice to the petitioner as the quashed Inquiry Report did not exonerate him but
held him guilty.
37. I also find that the Disciplinary Authority has not exceeded his jurisdiction in expanding the
scope of Patna High Court CWJC No.5581 of 2017 dt.16-07-2019 the limited remand of the
Appellate Authority i.e. the High Court. The Disciplinary Authority began the proceedings from the
stage from where it was directed by the High Court but since he has a discretion in the matter, he
found that the Inquiry Report itself is vitiated and therefore set aside the same and directed for a
fresh enquiry.
38. No fault could be found with the aforesaid order of the Disciplinary Authority under challenge.
39. The writ petition as also I.A. No. 7616 of 2018 seeking stay of the continuation of the
departmental proceeding against the petitioner, are hereby dismissed.
