2. At this juncture, the Learned counsel for the respondents contended that Section 32 (vi) of the
Bihar Targeted Public Distribution System (Control) Order, 2016 provides for the provision of
revision. Section 32(v) and (vi) read as follows:
"32. (v) Till the disposal of appeal pending, the Appellate Authority may direct that
the order under appeal shall not take effect for such period as the authority may
consider necessary for giving a reasonable opportunity to the other party under sub-
clause (4) or until the appeal is disposed of, whichever is earlier.
(vi) Due to non disposal of the appeal within sixty days by the District Officer or
against the order passed in the appeal, a revision may be filed before the Divisional
Commissioner. The revision shall be disposed of within two months."
Patna High Court CWJC No.14066 of 2019 dt.15-10-2025
3. Admittedly, the present case is filed against the order dated 13.10.2017, passed by the Sub
Divisional Officer, Aurangabad and the order dated 25.05.2018 passed by the District Magistrate-
cum-Collector, Aurangabad in PDS Appeal No. 57 of 2017.
4. The Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that he intends to file a revision before the
Divisional Commissioner, but the limitation period for filing the revision has lapsed. He prayed for a
direction to the concerned Divisional Commissioner to entertain the revision petition in accordance
with Section 5 of the Limitation Act.
5. Taking into consideration that the petitioner has an alternative remedy for filing a revision, the
writ petition is disposed of with a direction to the petitioner to file the revision petition within a
period of two months from the date of receipt of this order before the Divisional Commissioner. The
delay in filing the revision shall be condoned by the Divisional Commissioner, and the authority
shall dispose of the revision within Patna High Court CWJC No.14066 of 2019 dt.15-10-2025 three
months from the date of filing of the revision petition.
6. With the above said observation, the Writ petition is disposed of.
7. Interlocutory Application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
