Patna High Court L.P.A No.1189 of 2024 dt.25-09-2025
2/9
22.05.2023
issued by respondent no.4,
whereby and where under on wrong
assumption of facts, it has cancelled the
candidature of the petitioner for RO
Dealership.
ii. For quashing the letter dated
26.05.2023 by which the candidature of the petitioner was moved from Group-1 to Group-
iii. For commanding the respondents to award the RO dealership to the petitioner.
iv. For any other appropriate relief or reliefs may be granted in favor of the petitioner as your
Lordship may deem fit and proper."
3. Learned counsel appearing for the appellant submitted that the rejection of his candidature was
arbitrary, hyper-technical, and contrary to law. It was urged that the appellant had furnished a valid
registered lease deed dated 22.12.2018 executed by Md. Sultan, one of the recorded co-sharers of the
land (Annexure-5). Subsequently, Md. Nisarul Haq, the other co-sharer, executed his affidavit dated
19.12.2022 expressly affirming and consenting to the said lease (Annexure-9). The Circle Officer,
Khajauli, in his report dated 17.12.2022, also confirmed the land particulars and dimensions and
raised no objection to the appellant's claim Patna High Court L.P.A No.1189 of 2024 dt.25-09-2025
(Annexure-8). It was contended that in view of these documents, the appellant had fully complied
with the eligibility requirements prescribed under the dealership guidelines, and the objections
taken by the respondents for declaring him ineligible were untenable, inconsistent, and
unsustainable in law.
4. It was further urged that during pendency of the writ proceedings the respondents illegally
proceeded to select respondent no. 5, thereby rendering the writ infructuous and causing irreparable
prejudice.
5. Per contra, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents, including the Indian Oil
Corporation and respondent no. 5, submitted that the writ petition itself was devoid of merit. It was
contended that the dealership guidelines prescribe strict eligibility conditions relating to
ownership/leasehold rights of the offered land, which are statutory in nature and require strict
adherence. The appellant, upon scrutiny, failed to furnish consistent and valid documents in
support of his claim. The registered lease deed dated 22.12.2018 (Annexure-5), though executed by
Md. Sultan, was signed only by one co-sharer and therefore did not represent complete title at the
time of application. The subsequent affidavit of Md. Nisarul Haq dated 19.12.2022 (Annexure-9),

obtained much later, could not retrospectively cure Patna High Court L.P.A No.1189 of 2024
dt.25-09-2025 the initial defect. It was further argued that eligibility has to be determined with
reference to the documents available as on the date of application, and later improvements or
subsequent consents cannot be taken into account. The communications dated 22.05.2023 and
26.05.2023 (Annexures-10 and 11) clearly recorded that the land offered did not meet the prescribed
criteria, and such decision cannot be faulted.
6. Learned counsel also submitted that once the appellant was rightly held ineligible, respondent no.
5, being next in the order of merit and otherwise fully eligible, was duly considered and selected.
Respondent no. 5 has since deposited the requisite security amount (Annexure-14), and steps have
already been taken to operationalise the dealership. It was therefore urged that no illegality,
arbitrariness, or mala fides can be attributed to the respondents, and the learned Single Judge
rightly dismissed the writ petition.
ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION:
Having considered the rival submissions, this Court finds that the issues arising for
determination are:
Whether the appellant was wrongly declared ineligible for the RO dealership despite
fulfilling eligibility conditions?
Patna High Court L.P.A No.1189 of 2024 dt.25-09-2025 Whether the selection of
respondent no. 5 suffers from any arbitrariness or illegality so as to warrant
interference in Letters Patent jurisdiction?
FINDINGS:
Issue(i): Whether the appellant was wrongly declared ineligible for the RO dealership
despite fulfilling eligibility conditions?
Upon consideration of the pleadings, annexures, and submissions, this Court finds
that the appellant failed to establish that his land documents satisfied the eligibility
norms prescribed under the dealership brochure.
The Brochure (IOCL, 24.11.2018) under Clause 4(v)
(a)prescribes that:
"The land should be available with the applicant as on the date of application and
should have minimum lease of 19 years 11 months (as advertised by the Oil Company)
... but not later than the date of application."

[Emphasis Supplied] In the present case, the appellant placed reliance upon a lease deed dated
22.12.2018 executed solely by Md. Sultan, one of the co-sharers (Annexure-3). The other co-sharer,
Md. Nisarul Haq, gave his consent only much later by way of affidavit dated 19.12.2022
(Annexure-7). On the date of application, therefore, the Patna High Court L.P.A No.1189 of 2024
dt.25-09-2025 appellant did not hold a valid and subsisting lease from all co- owners as mandated
by Clause 4(v)(a).
The rejection letters dated 22.05.2023and 26.05.2023 (Annexures-5 & 6) specifically recorded such
deficiencies. Thus, the subsequent affidavit of the co-sharer could not cure the defect, since
eligibility has to be assessed strictly as on the last date of application. In the event of consent
affidavit of Md. Nisarul Haque is accepted it amounts to extending the last date for submission of
application which the Court cannot extend.
This principle is firmly settled in Chandrashekhar Vaishnav v. Indian Oil Corporation Ltd., WPC No.
2853/2024, decided on 18.07.2024 (Chhattisgarh High Court), the Court observed (para 14):
"As per terms of the brochure and the guidelines, the eligibility of petitioner had to be
established on the date of submission of application for allotment of retail outlet
dealership. ... Submission of affidavit (Appendix-III) of a date later than the date of
application is a non-rectifiable deficiency ... It is a well-settled proposition of law that
in contractual matters, the parties are bound by terms and conditions of
advertisement/brochure. The Court cannot ask any party to act contrary to terms and
conditions of the advertisement/Brochure."
[Emphasis Supplied] Patna High Court L.P.A No.1189 of 2024 dt.25-09-2025 Applying these settled
principles, it is evident that the appellant's candidature suffered from a fatal defect at the very
inception. The lease deed (Annexure-3) not being executed by all co-sharers rendered the land
documents invalid under Clause 4(v)
(a). The subsequent consent affidavit (Annexure-7), filed nearly four years later, could not
retrospectively validate the application.
Accordingly, this Court holds that the decision of the respondent-Corporation in declaring the
appellant ineligible was lawful and justified. This issue is, therefore, decided against the appellant.
Issue (ii)Whether the selection of respondent no. 5 suffers from any arbitrariness or illegality so as
to warrant interference in Letters Patent jurisdiction?
Upon consideration of the material on record, this Court finds that the appellant was duly informed
of the precise deficiencies in his candidature through communications dated 22.05.2023 and
26.05.2023 (Annexures-7 and 10). The appellant was thus afforded an opportunity to meet the
objections, but the deficiencies being of a non-rectifiable nature under the Brochure, his candidature
was rightly declared ineligible. Once the appellant was held ineligible, the Corporation was bound to
proceed with the Patna High Court L.P.A No.1189 of 2024 dt.25-09-2025 next candidate in order of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/70459332/ 4

merit. Respondent no. 5, being next in line, was considered and found eligible. He has complied
with the requisite conditions, including deposit of the prescribed security (Annexure-11), and further
steps for operationalisation of dealership have already been taken.
This Court, thus finds that the respondents acted in strict conformity with the Brochure and
principles of fairness. The appellant was duly notified of the grounds of ineligibility, but his defects
were incurable under the scheme. No arbitrariness, mala fide, or extraneous consideration is shown
in the subsequent selection of respondent no. 5.
Thus, Issue (ii) is also decided against the appellant.
7. Having considered the submissions made by both the parties and the relevant records, this Court
finds no infirmity in the judgment of the learned Single Judge. The dealership guidelines are
statutory and binding. The appellant, having failed to fulfil those eligibility norms at the relevant
stage (application stage), cannot claim entitlement to dealership. The respondents have acted in
accordance with law and no arbitrariness or mala fides is established.
Patna High Court L.P.A No.1189 of 2024 dt.25-09-2025
8. Accordingly, the Letters Patent Appeal stands dismissed, affirming the judgment and order dated
3.10.2024 passed in C.W.J.C. No. 9875 of 2023 with no order as to costs.
