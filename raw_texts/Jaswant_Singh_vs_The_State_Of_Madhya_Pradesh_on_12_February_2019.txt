offence under Sections 376(2)(N) of IPC and under Section
3(2)(5), 3(2)(5-A) of SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act,
1989.
Arguments heard with the help of case-diary.
As per the prosecution, the prosecutrix was an
employee of the present appellant. The prosecutrix was a
widow having two children. It was alleged that the present
appellant gave false impression that his wife and children
were not living with him and under a false promise of
marriage, he continuously exploited her sexually. It was also
said that she went pregnant, and thereafter,t he matter was
reported. It was also said that the present appellant threatened
the prosecutrix and her two minor children.
First appeal/application was dismissed by coordinate
Bench of this Court with liberty to repeat the prayer after
statement of the prosecutrix. Now the appellant has filed
21
statement of the prosecutrix recorded before the Court. In his
Court statement prosecutrix has not made any allegation
against the appellant. She has only deposed on oath before
the Court that the appellant was living with her. One day
suddenly he left the house without her knowledge and
without informing her. As she could not find his
whereabouts, therefore, she informed the police about his
missing. Nothing has been stated in the report.
Learned public prosecutor for the respondent/State has
opposed the prayer for bail.
I have gone through the record.
In view of the statement of the prosecutrix, the appeal is
allowed. Impugned order dated 22.12.2017 is hereby set
aside.
Accordingly, without expressing any opinion on the
merits of the case, it is directed that on furnishing personal
bond by the appellant in the sum of Rs.30,000/- (Rupees
Thirty Thousand Only), with one solvent surety in the like
amount to the satisfaction of the concerned Chief Judicial
Magistrate, he shall be released on bail, subject to the
following conditions that:-
(i)The appellant shall co-operate in the trial and

(ii)The appellant shall not directly or indirectly

Shri Nilesh Dave, learned counsel for the petitioner. Shri R. Joshi, learned Public

Heard with the aid of case diary.
ORDER This is an application under section 438 Cr.P.C seeking anticipatory bail in
connection with Crime No.227/2017 registered at Police Station -Javad, district -
Neemuch for the offence punishable under section 8/15 & 29 of Narcotic Drugs and
Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985.
As per information given by the accused, no other bail application is either filed or
pending or has been decided by any co-ordinate Bench of this Court or by Hon'ble the
Apex Court in connection with the present crime number.
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that petitioner is innocent and he has
been falsely implicated in the offence, hence prayed for anticipatory bail in the
matter.
Learned counsel further submits that under identical circumstances, co-accused
Lalsingh has been granted anticipatory bail by the coordinate Bench of this Court in
M.Cr.C. No.21672/2017 on 07/12/2017 and on the ground of parity, the present
petitioner is entitled to the same.
Though the learned Public Prosecutor has opposed the application, however, he has
fairly admitted that the case of the present petitioner is identical to the case of
co-accused Lalsingh, who has been granted anticipatory bail by the co- ordinate
Bench of this Court.
According to the prosecution case, on 01/08/2017 a TVS motorcycle without number
plate has been intercepted and during search, 28 kg poppy straw was recovered from

(VIRENDER SINGH) JUDGE soumya 30/10/2017:-
Shri Vivek Singh, learned counsel for the appellant. Shri R.Joshi, learned counsel for
the respondent/State. Heard on the question of admission.
Admit.
Also heard on IA No.5410/2018, which is second application for suspension of
sentence under Section 389 (1) of Cr.P.C. His first application was dismissed as
withdrawn vide order dated 24.04.2018.
Appellant is convicted for the offence under Section 420/34, 467/34, 468/34 and
473/34 of the IPC and sentenced to undergo 4-10-4-10 years RI respectively and fine
of Rs.1000/--2000/--1000/--2000/- respectively with default stipulation for
identifying Narmada Prasad as Nathuram.
Learned counsel for the appellant submit that during the trial appellant was on bail.
Final hearing of the appeal is likely to take time. The appellant has a good case in
appeal, hence jail sentence be suspended during pendency of the appeal.
He further submits that complainant Sumer Singh in his statement has stated
nothing against the present appellant and learned public prosecutor has declared him
hostile and even after cross-examination, nothing could be brought on record against
the present appellant and in cross-examination the complainant has clearly denied
the involvement of the present appellant in the crime. He has stated that he himself
brought the appellant for his own identification.
Per contra, learned public prosecutor has drew my attention towards para no. 24 of
the impugned judgment, in which learned Trial Court has held that the present
appellant has identified Narmada Prasad as Nathuram at the time of execution of sale
deed, therefore, the learned Trial Court was of the opinion that the appellant is also
involved in the crime and convicted him.
I have considered the submissions of learned counsel for the parties.

Peyush Jain, learned Public Prosecutor for the respondent/State. Heard learned
counsel for the parties on I.A. No.9536/2016, an application under Section 389(1)
Cr.P.C. for suspension of custodial sentence.
The appellant has been convicted for offence under Section 363 IPC and has been
sentenced to 3 years RI with fine of Rs.500/-.
Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the learned trial Court has recorded
the conviction without properly appreciating the evidence on record and that
material omissions, contradictions and anomalies present in the prosecution
evidence have been overlooked. It is also submitted that the appellant was on bail
during trial and the liberty so granted was not misused by him. It is further submitted
that the appeal is likely to take sufficiently long time in its final disposal and if the
sentence is not suspended then, it shall be rendered infructuous.
Though the prayer for suspension is opposed by learned Public Prosecutor, however,
looking to the aforesaid, without further commenting on the merits of the case, it
would be appropriate to suspend the custodial sentence of the appellant.
Accordingly, I.A. No. 8357/16 is allowed and it is directed that on execution of
personal bond by the appellant in the sum of Rs.40,000/- with a solvent surety in the
like amount to the satisfaction of the learned trial Court for his appearance before
this Court, the execution of custodial sentence imposed against him shall remain
suspended, till the final disposal of this appeal.
The appellant after being enlarged on bail, shall mark his presence before the
Registry of this Court on 21.12.2016 and on all such subsequent dates, which are fixed
in this regard by the Registry.
