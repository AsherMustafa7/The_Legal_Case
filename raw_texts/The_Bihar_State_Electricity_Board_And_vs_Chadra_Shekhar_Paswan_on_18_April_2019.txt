CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE ASHWANI KUMAR SINGH
and
HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE BIRENDRA KUMAR
and
HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE ANIL KUMAR UPADHYAY
CAV JUDGMENT
Patna High Court L.P.A No.1305 of 2013 dt.18-04-2019
3/54
(Per: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE ASHWANI KUMAR SINGH)
Date : 18-04-2019
Since common question of law is involved in these
cases, this order shall dispose of all these cases.
2. Under Clause 10 of the Letters Patent, LPA No. 1305
of 2013 has been preferred by the erstwhile Bihar State Electricity
Board (for short 'the Board') against the order dated 13.08.2012
passed by the learned Single Judge in the writ petition bearing
CWJC No. 9329 of 2012.
3. Under Clause 10 of the Letters Patent, LPA No. 1608
of 2014 has been filed by the State of Bihar challenging the
aforestated order dated 13.08.2012 passed by the learned Single
Judge in CWJC No. 9329 of 2012 to the extent whereby circular
no.937 dated 23.06.2005 issued under the signature of the Joint
Secretary, Personnel and Administrative Reforms Department,
Government of Bihar by which a decision had been taken that if a
government servant marries while earlier marriage is subsisting
without the permission of the government, then such spouse and
the ward of such spouse would be disentitled for appointment on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/96363548/ 3
The Bihar State Electricity Board And ... vs Chadra Shekhar Paswan on 18 April, 2019
compassionate ground.
4. Under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, CWJC
No. 11445 of 2010 has been filed by the petitioner, a minor, under
Patna High Court L.P.A No.1305 of 2013 dt.18-04-2019
4/54
the guardianship of his mother Nanhki Devi for directing the
respondents to appoint him on compassionate ground on the post
of Child Police (Bal Arakshi) since his father, namely, Ganesh Rai
died in harness on 23.02.2008. By way of an interlocutory
application, vide I.A. No. 1924 of 2011, he has prayed for adding
further relief challenging the aforesaid circular no. 937, dated
23.06.2005
,
5. Facts giving rise to LPA No. 1305 of 2013 will serve the purpose for deciding all these cases. One
Mote Mal Paswan, while working as a line man, Electric Supply Sub-Division, Phulparas,
Madhubani died on 12.01.2007 due to cardiac arrest. He was initially married to one Jeevachi Devi,
who gave birth to two sons. During subsistence of the first marriage, he entered into marriage with
another lady Badamia Devi from whom he had four sons and two daughters. Since one of his sons
Chandra Shekhar Paswan had passed Class-8 examination, all the heirs of Mote Mal Paswan
collectively took a decision that he should apply for appointment on compassionate ground. In view
of no objection certificate granted by all the heirs, Chandra Shekhar Paswan submitted his
application for appointment on compassionate ground. He was informed vide letter no. 1023 dated
22.07.2011 issued by the Board that the Central Compassionate Committee in Patna High Court
L.P.A No.1305 of 2013 dt.18-04-2019 its meeting dated 08.04.2011 rejected his candidature for
compassionate appointment in view of circular no. 937 dated 23.06.2005 issued by the Personnel
and Administrative Reforms Department, Government of Bihar, Patna by which a decision had been
taken that if a government servant gets married again during the life time of spouse without prior
permission of the government then such spouse and off-spring of such spouse would be disentitled
for appointment on compassionate ground.
6. Being aggrieved by the aforestated order dated 22.07.2011 Chandra Shekhar Paswan filed a writ
petition vide CWJC No. 9329 of 2012 praying therein for setting aside the same as also for directing
the respondents to consider his case afresh and appoint him without any further delay.

The Bihar State Electricity Board And ... vs Chadra Shekhar Paswan on 18 April, 2019
7. By way of an interlocutory application vide I.A. No. 4922 of 2012 in CWJC No. 9329 of 2012, he
prayed for adding a further relief challenging the aforestated circular no. 937 dated 23.06.2005. He
filed another interlocutory application vide I.A. No. 4610 of 2012 for adding the Joint Secretary
Personnel and Administrative Reforms Department, Government of Bihar, Patna, as respondent
no.9. Both the interlocutory applications were allowed by the learned Single Judge vide order dated
08.08.2012.
8. After hearing the parties, vide order dated Patna High Court L.P.A No.1305 of 2013 dt.18-04-2019
13.08.2012, the learned Single Judge allowed the writ petition bearing CWJC No.9329 of 2012. The
operative portion of the order reads as under :-
"In the said circumstances, the impugned circular/letter dated 23.06.2005 issued by
the Government is contrary to the directions given by the High Court in the aforesaid
decision. No doubt, the second marriage of a Government employee during the life
time of the earlier spouse is prohibited under the rules and regulations of the
concerned department and the Board and a second marriage of a Hindu male in the
life time of first wife is also prohibited under the personal law and hence it is a settled
law that such a spouse will not be entitled to any claim or benefits whatsoever
accruing from service of the deceased employee, but the equally settled law is that the
children from such spouse shall be entitled to inheritance and benefits, which accrues
from his father even if the marriage of the father and mother of such children was not
legal as aforesaid. In this connection, reference may be made to a decision of a
Division Bench of this Court in case of Purushottam Kumar alias Purooshottam
Kumar vrs. State of Bihar and others, reported in 2005(3) P.L.J.R. 458. Apart from
the aforesaid propositions of Patna High Court L.P.A No.1305 of 2013 dt.18-04-2019
law, it is not in dispute that the first wife of the deceased employee, namely, Jeevachi
Devi died on 20.05.2006 and, thereafter, the mother of the petitioner Badamia Devi
was the only wife of the deceased employee till his death on 12.01.2007 and all the
children of the said deceased employee from both his wives were together suffering
hardship due to the early demise of the bread -earner of the family and hence they
jointly approached the authority concerned for appointment of the petitioner on
compassionate ground. Considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances, it is quite
apparent that the claim of the petitioner for compassionate appointment is legal and
justified and he has been wrongly denied the benefit to which he was legally entitled
for five long years. Accordingly, this writ petition is allowed, the impugned
circular/letter dated 23.06.2005 (Annexure 7) is hereby quashed and consequently
the impugned order of the authority dated 22.07.2011 (Annexure 6) is also quashed
and the respondents are directed to appoint the petitioner on compassionate ground
on the post, to which he is entitled, expeditiously preferably within a period of three
months from the date of receipt/production of this order."

The Bihar State Electricity Board And ... vs Chadra Shekhar Paswan on 18 April, 2019
9. Being aggrieved by the aforestated order dated 13.08.2012 passed by the learned Single Judge,
the Board has filed an intra-court appeal before the Division Bench vide LPA No. 1305 of 2013.
10. The Division Bench vide order dated 09.12.2013 noticing conflicting judgments of this Court,
referred the Letters Patent to a larger Bench pursuant to which LPA No. 1305 of 2013 has been
placed before us for consideration.
11. For the sake of clarity and convenience, we would like to reproduce the relevant portion of the
reference made by the Division Bench in its order dated 09.12.2013 hereunder :-
"The respondent is stated to be the son born to the deceased employee from the
second marriage solemnized by him during subsistence of the first marriage. The
deceased did not take permission under Rule 23 of the Bihar Government Servant
Conduct Rules, 1976 before solemnizing the second marriage during subsistence of
the first. It therefore constituted a misconduct. The claim for compassionate
appointment by the son born from this second marriage has been denied under a
policy decision 23.6.2005 referring to Rule 23 that the personal law had no
relationship with the claim for compassionate appointment.
Patna High Court L.P.A No.1305 of 2013 dt.18-04-2019 Learned Single judge opined
that the policy dated 23.6.2005 was contrary to a Bench decision reported in 2004(4)
PLJR 366 (Mustaque Ahmad Vs. State Of Bihar) which primarily directed the State to
form a policy only.
Counsel for the Appellants submitted that the claim could not have been allowed in
view of the policy dated 23.6.2005 as compassionate appointment was not a matter
of right. There is no finding that the policy was arbitrary or irrational before striking
it down.
Counsel for the Respondent has relied upon a Division Bench judgment reported in
2005(3) PLJR 458 (Purushottam Kumar @ Purooshattam Kumar Vs. State Of Bihar).
Service jurisprudence mandates by a plethora of precedence that compassionate appointment is an
exception to the general rule for appointment in accordance with Article 14 preceded by an
advertisement and open merit selection considering that all employment under the State constitutes
a national wealth and there must be equal opportunity for all. A compassionate appointee escapes
the rigors of selection because of which a more genuine candidate may have to be denied
consideration because Patna High Court L.P.A No.1305 of 2013 dt.18-04-2019 the post had been
filled up. But, compassionate appointment has been considered as an exception to the same where
the particular facts and circumstances of a case may reveal it to be a compelling necessity. It has
therefore been held repeatedly that any such appointment has to be strictly and only in accordance
with the policy decision of the State and no direction for compassionate appointment can be given
de hors the policy. A policy decision can be struck down only if it is arbitrary or irrational based on
no cogent justification or classification.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/96363548/ 6
The Bihar State Electricity Board And ... vs Chadra Shekhar Paswan on 18 April, 2019
Purushottam Kumar (supra) notices Rule 23 of the Bihar Government Servant Conduct Rules and
holds that a marriage solemnized by a government servant in violation of the same constitutes a
misconduct. It then holds that in absence of any objection during life time of the deceased it was not
relevant for decision of the controversy. Invoking the personal law under the Hindu Marriage Act it
grants relief relying on AIR 2000 SC 735 (Rameshwari Devi vs. State of Bihar & Ors) relating to
pension claim holding that child born from such second marriage was not illegitimate.
In 2002 (2) PLJR 253 (Sanjeev Kumar Yadav Vs. State of Bihar) the learned Patna High Court L.P.A
No.1305 of 2013 dt.18-04-2019 Single Judge was considering a similar claim for compassionate
appointment denied under a like policy decision under Rule 23 vide Government Circular No. 13293
dated 5.10.1991 holding that it would be anomalous if the claim for compassionate appointment
could originate from the misconduct committed in service by the deceased. This has been followed
in another Bench decision reported in 2010 (3) BBCJ 258 (Sarjan Singh vs. State of Bihar). Similar
view has been taken in 2004(1) PLJR 37 (Vinod Kumar vs. State of Bihar). Purushottam Kumar
(supra) does not consider these pronouncements. In (2008) 8 SCC 475 (State Bank of India vs. Anju
Jain), it was held that misconduct in service can be valid justification to deny compassionate
appointment.
Judicial discipline, in our opinion, requires that we do not attempt to distinguish Purushottam
Kumar (supra) on basis of para 5 of that judgment.
An important element in judicial pronouncements is certainty of the legal position where both the
litigant and the State authorities as also the lawyers are made aware of the clear exposition of the
law so that no confusion prevails on any aspect for all concerned.
We, therefore, consider it Patna High Court L.P.A No.1305 of 2013 dt.18-04-2019 appropriate that
the records be laid before Hon'ble the Chief Justice for the desirability of constituting a larger Bench
to lay down the correct law on the issue.
In the meantime operation of the order under appeal shall remain stayed."
12. At this juncture, it would be pertinent to note that subsequently the State of Bihar also
challenged the aforestated order dated 13.08.2012 passed by the learned Single Judge in CWJC No.
9329 of 2012 to the extent whereby the aforesaid circular no. 937 dated 23.06.2005 was quashed in
LPA No. 1608 of 2014. The said appeal came up for hearing before a Division Bench on 02.02.2015.
The Division Bench, vide its order dated 02.02.2015, admitted the appeal and directed the same to
be heard along with LPA No. 1305 of 2013.
13. In CWJC No. 11445 of 2010, vide order dated 23.11.2010, the learned Single Judge referred the
writ petition to the Division Bench doubting the correctness of the ratio laid down in Purushottam
Kumar @ Purooshattam Kumar Vs. State of Bihar, since reported in 2005(3) PLJR 458 whereby
after taking into consideration rule 23 of the Bihar Government Servant Conduct Rules, 1976 (for
short '1976 Rules'), it was held that though second marriage during lifetime of the first wife is void,
Patna High Court L.P.A No.1305 of 2013 dt.18-04-2019 the child of second marriage is legitimate
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/96363548/ 7
The Bihar State Electricity Board And ... vs Chadra Shekhar Paswan on 18 April, 2019
and cannot be denied consideration. Subsequently, the Division Bench, vide order, dated
01.04.2011, referred the writ petition to the Full Bench for consideration of the decision in
Purushottam Kumar (Supra). The reference made by the Division Bench vide order dated
01.04.2011 reads as under:-
"In view of the law laid down by the Division Bench in the case of Purushottam
Kumar @ Purooshattam Kumar Vrs. The State of Bihar & Ors. (Supra), we are of the
opinion that the matter has to be considered by the Full Bench on the question as to
whether the children borne out from the second wife of the deceased employee on
violation of Rule -23 of the Government Servant Conduct Rules, 1976 are also entitled
for such claim of compassionate appointment. Hence the matter has to be referred to
the Full Bench for re- consideration of the aforesaid decision.
In that view of the matter, let this matter be placed before Hon'ble the Chief Justice
for passing an appropriate order."
14. In these factual backgrounds, these cases have been placed before us.
15. As seen above, in LPA No. 1305 of 2013, the Division Bench while referring the appeal to a larger
Bench Patna High Court L.P.A No.1305 of 2013 dt.18-04-2019 noticed the judgment passed by the
Supreme Court in General Manager, State Bank of India Vs. Anju Jain, since reported in (2008) 8
SCC 475 wherein it was held that misconduct in service can be held valid justification to deny
compassionate appointment. It also noticed that though rule 23 of the 1976 Rules, which puts
restrictions on a government servant to enter into or contract a marriage with a person having a
spouse living and violation of the same constitutes misconduct, the learned Single Judge in CWJC
No. 9329 of 2012 allowed the writ petition relying on the Division Bench judgment in Purushottam
Kumar (Supra) whereas in Purushottam Kumar (Supra) pronouncements made in Sanjeev Kumar
Yadav Vs. State of Bihar, since reported in 2002 (2) PLJR 253, Sarjan Singh vs. State of Bihar, since
reported in 2010 (3) BBCJ 258 and Vinod Kumar vs. State of Bihar, since reported in 2004(1) PLJR
37 holding that it would be anomalous if the claim for compassionate appointment could originate
from misconduct committed in service by the deceased were not considered.
16. Thus, on the facts and in the circumstances noted above, the seminal issues for consideration
before us are as under:-
(a) Whether the condition imposed by the circular no.
937 dated 23.06.2005 issued under the signature of Patna High Court L.P.A No.1305 of 2013
dt.18-04-2019 the Joint Secretary, Personnel and Administrative Reforms Department, Government
of Bihar, Patna which bars compassionate appointment to the children born from the second
marriage of deceased employee is legal and justified?
(b) Whether the condition of prior approval of employer before second marriage becomes sine qua
non for grant of compassionate appointment to the children born of second marriage to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/96363548/ 8
The Bihar State Electricity Board And ... vs Chadra Shekhar Paswan on 18 April, 2019
deceased employee?
(c) Whether the claim for compassionate appointment can originate from the misconduct
committed in service by the deceased employee?
17. Mr. Anand Kumar Ojha, learned counsel appearing for the appellants in LPA No. 1305 of 2013
has submitted that the learned Single Judge while passing the impugned order dated 13.08.2012 in
CWJC No. 9329 of 2012 has failed to appreciate that the circular no. 937 dated 23.06.2005, which
has been adopted by the Board, prohibits children born out of second marriage without prior
permission of the government from employment on compassionate ground. He has contended that
the learned Single Judge has failed to appreciate that the circular dated 23.06.2005 was issued in
compliance of the order passed in Patna High Court L.P.A No.1305 of 2013 dt.18-04-2019 Mustaque
Ahmad Vs. State of Bihar, since reported in 2004 (4) PLJR 366. He has pleaded that the misconduct
of the deceased employee by opting for second marriage during the lifetime of the first wife was
bound to have its legal consequences in law. The learned Single Judge, however, failed to appreciate
that compassionate appointment being not a fundamental and legal right is open to rejection on the
grounds valid and sustainable in the eyes of law. He has submitted that the Full Bench of this Court
in Union of India through Secretary, Ministry of Railways and Ors. Vs. Sanjay Kumar, since
reported in 2018 (2) PLJR 107 has denied compassionate appointment to the children born out of
second wife of the deceased employee relying upon a similar circular of the Railway Board relating
to appointment on compassionate grounds. He has, however, conceded that the Supreme Court in
Union of India Vs. V.R. Tripathi, since reported in 2019(1) Scale 302 has held contrary to the Full
Bench of this Court in Union of India Vs. Sanjay Kumar (Supra).
18. Mr. Chitranjan Sinha, learned senior counsel appearing for the State of Bihar in LPA No. 1608 of
2014 has submitted that the learned Single Judge while passing impugned order has failed to
consider that marrying second spouse in the lifetime of earlier spouse without prior permission is
regarded as Patna High Court L.P.A No.1305 of 2013 dt.18-04-2019 misconduct by the government
servant. To provide compassionate appointment to such second spouse or such children will be
against the spirit of rule 23 (1) and 23 (2) of the 1976 Rules. He has contended that past conduct of
such employee is of much relevance. In this regard, he has placed reliance on the decision of the
Supreme Court in State Bank of India Vs. Anju Jain (Supra). He has pleaded that the learned Single
Judge failed to appreciate that the law of inheritance is general rule whereas compassionate
appointment is only for the government servant, which cannot be equated with inheritance rule.
According to him, circular no. 937 dated 23.06.2005 cannot be said to be violative of any direction
of this Court. He has pleaded that the recent decision of the Supreme Court in Union of India Vs.
V.R. Tripathi (Supra) has also given liberty to the employer to consider other requirements. The past
conduct of an employee is of paramount consideration. He has placed reliance in this regard on the
decision of the Full Bench of this Court in Union of India Vs. Sanjay Kumar (Supra).
19. Mr. Ajey Kumar, learned counsel appearing for the respondent Chandra Shekhar Paswan has
submitted that there is no illegality in the impugned order passed by the learned Single Judge in
CWJC No. 9329 of 2012. He has contended that the learned Single Judge while passing the order
under challenge has Patna High Court L.P.A No.1305 of 2013 dt.18-04-2019 placed reliance on a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/96363548/ 9
The Bihar State Electricity Board And ... vs Chadra Shekhar Paswan on 18 April, 2019
Division Bench judgment of this Court in Purushottam Kumar (Supra) wherein it was held that child
of second marriage is entitled for compassionate appointment. The Division Bench, in Purushottan
Kumar (Supra) had based its decision on the decision of the Supreme Court in Rameshwari Devi Vs.
State of Bihar, since reported in AIR 2000 SC 735. He has contended that the Division Bench, while
referring the matter to a Larger Bench, has referred the case of Sanjeev Kumar Yadav (Supra), which
was with regard to misconduct when bigamy was committed. The facts of the judgments in Sarjan
Singh (Supra) and Vinod Kumar (Supra) were not identical to the facts of the case in CWJC No.
9329 of 2012.
20. He has submitted that in Sanjeev Kumar Yadav (Supra), the issue was with regard to misconduct
when bigamy was committed. In Sarjan Singh (Supra), the appellant (the applicant for
compassionate appointment) himself had entered into two marriages. Similarly, in Vinod Kumar
(Supra), the misconduct was by contracting second marriage by the applicant, who was seeking
compassionate appointment. He has pleaded that in the State Bank of India vs. Anju Jain (Supra),
the case was with respect to proved misconduct of bigamy. Thus, he has pleaded that all the
decisions referred by the Division Bench in its Patna High Court L.P.A No.1305 of 2013
dt.18-04-2019 order of reference have no bearing on the facts of the instant case. He has further
contended that the Full Bench judgment of this Court in Union of India Vs. Sanjay Kumar (Supra)
has denied the right to compassionate appointment to the second wife/ off-spring of second wife
placing reliance on the Railway Board's Circular No. 01 of 1992 dated 24.01.1992, which had already
been quashed by the Calcutta High Court in Namita Goldar and Anr. Vs. Union of India and Anr.
reported in 2010 (1) Cal.L.J 464. It was no more in existence as the Railway Board has never
challenged the order of the High Court at Calcutta in Namita Goldar (Supra). As such, it had
attained finality. The said judgment in the case of Namita Goldar (Supra) was not brought to the
notice of the Full Bench either by the Union of India or by the respondents. Thus, the decision of the
Full Bench was in ignorance of the relevant case as also in ignorance of the fact that the circular, in
question, itself was not in existence. Hence, the said decision of the Full Bench is of no consequence.
Lastly, he has argued that the issues involved in the present case are no more res integra. Recently,
the Supreme Court, in the Union of the India Vs. V.R. Tripathi (Supra) has clearly held that the
children born out of void marriage are legitimate and compassionate appointment cannot be denied
to them.
Patna High Court L.P.A No.1305 of 2013 dt.18-04-2019
21. Having heard learned counsel for the parties and carefully perused the materials on record, first
of all, let us examine the background in which circular no.937 dated 23.06.2005 was issued by the
State Government.
22. Prior to the issuance of the aforestated circular no. 937 dated 23.06.2005 the Government of
Bihar had come out with a policy decision, as contained in Memo No. 13293 dated 05.10.1991,
providing employment in Class-III and Class-IV posts in case of death of government servant during
service period. The said memo laid down the categories/persons entitled to appointment on
compassionate ground and other procedure for the same. According to the circular dated
05.10.1991, only dependents were to be given appointment on compassionate ground. The
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/96363548/ 10
The Bihar State Electricity Board And ... vs Chadra Shekhar Paswan on 18 April, 2019
dependents were defined as widow of the deceased employee, son, unmarried daughter and widow
of pre-deceased son. The order of preference stipulated in the circular was widow of the deceased,
son, unmarried daughter and the widow of pre-deceased son.
23. In Mustaque Ahmad (Supra), a Muslim employee marrying second time during the life time of
the first wife died in harness. The son from the first wife, namely, Mustaque Ahmad made an
application for his appointment on compassionate ground Patna High Court L.P.A No.1305 of 2013
dt.18-04-2019 but, before anything could be done, the second wife Mosamat Jahanara Begum made
a written complaint that since she along with her children have been ousted from the house, said
Mustaque Ahmad is not entitled to appointment on compassionate ground. In view of the dispute
raised, the District Compassionate Appointment Committee directed the District Education Officer
to make an inquiry and submit his report. After the inquiry, report was submitted and considered
whereafter, the District Magistrate, Muzaffarpur had sought clarification from the Secretary,
Personnel and Administrative Reforms Department asking the authority as to whether second wife
and her children would be entitled to appointment on compassionate ground. It was under
this circumstance, the writ petition was filed by Mustaque Ahmad and, after hearing
the parties, this Court disposed of the writ petition on the following terms:-
"Instead of entering into the controversy or considering the entitlement of the
parties, I dispose of the writ application with a direction to the Secretary, Personnel &
Administrative Reforms Department to issue proper directions in a matter like this.
The directions should not be issued only to the District Magistrate, Muzaffarpur but
should be issued to all concerned in form of a policy decision because such matters
are seeing the light of the day Patna High Court L.P.A No.1305 of 2013 dt.18-04-2019
many times. In case of a Mohammadan, who marries second time during the life time
of the first wife, on one side the Government says that the Government servant is not
entitled to marry second time while claimants say that under the personal law such a
person is entitled to marry and in any case his wards or dependents cannot be
refused the appointment on compassionate ground. Let necessary policy be framed
and orders be issued within a period of four months from the date of submission of
this order."
24. In the background of the directions given in Mustaque Ahmad (Supra), circular No. 937 dated
23.06.2005 was issued under the signature of the Joint Secretary, Personnel and Administrative
Reforms Department, Government of Bihar, Patna, which reads as under:-

25. A reading of the aforesaid circular would make it manifest that by the said circular
compassionate appointment cannot be granted to the children born from the second marriage of a
deceased employee except where the marriage was permitted by the Government taking into
account personal law etc.
26. The said circular had been issued by the State Government keeping in mind rule 23 of the 1976
Rules, which puts restriction upon marriage by the government servant having spouse living during
life time.
27. Rule 23 of 1976 Rules reads as under:-
"Restrictions regarding marriage:- (1) No Government servant shall enter into, or
contract, a marriage with a person having a spouse living and (2) No Government
servant, having a spouse Patna High Court L.P.A No.1305 of 2013 dt.18-04-2019
living shall enter into, or contract a marriage with any person:
Provided that Government may permit a Government servant to enter into or
contract, any such marriage as is referred to in clause(1) or clause(2) if it is satisfied
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/96363548/ 12
The Bihar State Electricity Board And ... vs Chadra Shekhar Paswan on 18 April, 2019
that:-
(a) such marriage is permissible under the personal law applicable to such
Government servant and the other party to the marriage; and
(b) there are other grounds for so doing. (3) A Government servant who has married
or marries a person other than of Indian Nationality shall forthwith intimate the fact
to the Government."
28. Having noticed the relevant circular and rule 23 of the 1976 Rules, let us now consider the facts
of the cases noticed by the Division Bench while passing its reference order in LPA No. 1305 of 2013.
29. In Vinod Kumar (Supra), the claim of the appellant, son of a Class-IV employee, who died in
harness, for compassionate appointment was rejected by the government on the ground that he had
married twice and under government regulations he would immediately come within the
misconduct under 1976 Rules. He challenged the said decisions by way of Patna High Court L.P.A
No.1305 of 2013 dt.18-04-2019 filing a writ petition. The learned Single Judge dismissed the writ
petition where after he filed an appeal before the Division Bench. The Division Bench dismissed the
appeal finding no illegality in the decision of the government or of the learned Single Judge.
30. In Purushottam Kumar (Supra), the question, which fell for consideration before the Division
Bench was whether a son of the second wife, whose marriage is void in terms of Section 5 read with
Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act is entitled to compassionate appointment in terms of the State
Government Memo No. 13293 dated 05.10.1991. In that case, the appellant's case was rejected by
the District Compassionate Committee on the ground that the deceased employee had two wives
and as the second marriage was performed while the first marriage was subsisting, the claim of the
appellant, the son of the second wife, cannot be considered for compassionate appointment. The
appellant preferred writ petition challenging the said decision, which was dismissed by the learned
Single Judge vide order dated 28.02.2005 whereafter an appeal was filed before the Division Bench.
The Division Bench, after considering the provisions of law prescribed in Sections 5, 11 and 16 of the
Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, rule 23 of the 1976 Rules as also the government policy decision
contained in Memo No. 13293 dated 05.10.1991 Patna High Court L.P.A No.1305 of 2013
dt.18-04-2019 and the ratio laid down by the Supreme Court in Rameshwari Devi (Supra), set aside
the order passed by the learned Single Judge and the decision of the Compassionate Appointment
Committee and remitted the matter to the authorities concerned to consider the question of
appointment of the appellant on compassionate ground.
31. While passing the order, the Division Bench, in Purushottam Kumar (Supra), came to the
conclusion that since policy of the State Government refers to son and son of the second wife is also
legitimate, he would be entitled to be appointed on compassionate ground and his claim cannot be
rejected on the ground of being off-spring of void marriage.
32. In General Manager, S.B.I. & Ors. Vs. Anju Jain (Supra), the respondent husband was an
employee of the appellant bank. In 1996, he was found guilty of embezzlement for which major
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/96363548/ 13
The Bihar State Electricity Board And ... vs Chadra Shekhar Paswan on 18 April, 2019
punishment of reduction of his basic pay by two stages and stoppage of five annual increments with
cumulative effect was imposed on him. He died on 25.01.2000. Thereafter, in March, 2000, the
respondent made a request for compassionate appointment. The request was rejected by the
appellant bank on the ground that punishment had been imposed on the respondent's husband on
account of serious misconduct. Subsequently, another Patna High Court L.P.A No.1305 of 2013
dt.18-04-2019 representation by the respondent was also rejected on 16.07.2001. Upon challenge,
the learned Single Judge of the High Court of Allahabad allowed the petition filed by the
respondents and directed the State Government to provide her appointment on compassionate
ground from the date of death of her husband. In intra-court appeal, the Division Bench of the High
Court of Allahabad, confirmed the order passed by the learned Single Judge and dismissed the
appeal. Upon challenge, the Supreme Court set aside the order passed by the learned Single Judge,
which was confirmed by the Division Bench of the High Court and allowed the appeal filed by the
bank. While passing the order, the Supreme Court observed :-
"In our opinion, therefore, if disciplinary proceedings have been initiated against an
employee and the charges levelled against such employee are proved and he is
punished, it is indeed a relevant consideration for not extending the benefit to
dependent of such employee on the ground that he was punished. To us, it cannot be
said that it is a case of double jeopardy or a dual punishment.
Compassionate appointment is really a concession in favour of dependents of
deceased employee. If during his carrier, he had committed illegalities and the
misconduct is proved and he is punished, obviously his Patna High Court L.P.A
No.1305 of 2013 dt.18-04-2019 dependents cannot claim right to the employment.
With respect, the learned Single Judge was wholly wrong in observing that such an
action would be violative of principles of natural justice.
To us, the observation of the learned Single Judge that "no past acts of misconduct of
the employee who dies in harness can be taken into account while considering the
case of a family member for employment on compassionate ground" is not in
consonance with law. Past conduct of an employee is undoubtedly an important
consideration. We are also of the view that the State Bank was right in rejecting the
prayer of the wife of the deceased employee vide its letter dated January 29, 2001
observing therein that "unblemished service record is implicit".
33. In Sanjiv Kumar Yadav (Supra), the father of the petitioner, an Assistant Teacher, in a
government girls' primary school, died in harness on 6.2.1997. Following his death, the petitioner
made an application for appointment on compassionate ground. His request for appointment was
considered by the District Compassionate Committee, Sitamarhi in its meeting held on 8-9-1997
and having regard to the fact that the petitioner had two wives, it was decided to seek guidance in
the matter from the Patna High Court L.P.A No.1305 of 2013 dt.18-04-2019 department of
Administrative and Personnel Reforms. The Deputy Secretary of the Department vide his letter
dated 10.7.1998 gave the direction that the petitioner's appointment would not be valid because of
his two marriages. At that stage, the mother of the petitioner, the widow of the deceased government
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/96363548/ 14
The Bihar State Electricity Board And ... vs Chadra Shekhar Paswan on 18 April, 2019
employee made a detailed application protesting against the decision not to give appointment to her
son on the ground of bigamy. She explained that the first wife of the petitioner was not being able to
bear a child and it was she who had forced and persuaded him to take a second wife. After the
second marriage, however, the first wife of the petitioner bore a child. On the basis of the application
received from the mother of the petitioner, the District Compassionate Committee requested the
Deputy Secretary in the government to reconsider the matter, in reply to which the District
Compassionate Committee was directed to take a decision on the question of petitioner's
appointment on compassionate grounds in the light of the departmental memo No. 13293 dated
5.10.1991. Finally, the case of the petitioner was turned down on the ground of his having two wives.
The petitioner challenged the decision of the District Compassionate Committee taken in its meeting
dated 18.07.2000 by way of filing a writ petition. The writ petition was dismissed taking into
consideration that commission of bigamy is Patna High Court L.P.A No.1305 of 2013 dt.18-04-2019
a misconduct by a government employee. That being the position, it was held that the impugned
decision was unexceptionable because it would appear quite anomalous to induct into government
employment someone, who even before his appointment is in a position, which is a misconduct for a
government employee.
34. In Sarjan Singh (Supra), the petitioner had preferred writ petition seeking a direction upon the
respondent authorities for his appointment on compassionate ground. His father was a Class IV
employee, who had died on 17.01.2005. Thereafter, he had filed his application for appointment on
compassionate ground. On 27.04.2005, his claim was rejected by the District Compassionate
Committee, Muzaffarpur on 05.10.2007, on the ground that he had two wives. This Court, in view of
the settled legal position in the case of Sanjiv Kumar Yadav (Supra), dismissed the writ petition.
35. As seen above, the cases of Sanjiv Kumar Yadav (Supra), Vinod Kumar (Supra) and Sarjan Singh
(Supra) are identical in one aspect. They had approached this Court seeking a direction upon the
respondent authorities for their appointment on compassionate ground upon death of their
respective fathers, who had died in harness. Their respective claims for appointment on Patna High
Court L.P.A No.1305 of 2013 dt.18-04-2019 compassionate ground were negated by the State
Government on the ground that they all were bigamous husband and had no regard for the law and
that the public policy being strongly opposed to bigamy, the Courts should take a view discouraging
the practice of bigamy. Compassionate appointment is not a reservation and the employer can
refuse compassionate appointment if it is against the public policy or law of the land.
36. In the case of General Manager, State Bank of India Vs. Anju Singh (Supra), the claim for
compassionate appointment to the wife of the deceased employee had been rejected by the bank on
the ground that punishment had been imposed on the respondent's husband on account of serious
misconduct while he was still in service. The decision taken by the bank was set aside by the High
Court. On appeal, the Supreme Court set aside the order of the High Court taking into consideration
the fact that the disciplinary proceeding had been initiated against the employee and the charges
leveled against him was proved and he was punished. It is in this background the Supreme Court
observed that if during his career the employee had committed illegalities and his misconduct is
proved and he is punished, the dependents cannot claim right to compassionate employment.

The Bihar State Electricity Board And ... vs Chadra Shekhar Paswan on 18 April, 2019
Patna High Court L.P.A No.1305 of 2013 dt.18-04-2019
37. In the present case, the issues are quite different and distinguishable. It is not the case of the
Board that the father of the respondent Chandra Shekhar Paswan was ever charged or proceeded
against for any misconduct while in service. It is also not the case of the appellant that the
respondent Chandra Shekhar Paswan is guilty of commission of bigamy or otherwise ineligible for
appointment on account of public policy or breach of law. His application for appointment on
compassionate ground was rejected by the Board on the ground that he being the son from the
second wife of the deceased employee, whose marriage was void, cannot be appointed on
compassionate ground. Hence, the ratio laid down in the cases of General Manager, State Bank of
India Vs. Anju Jain (Supra), Sanjiv Kumar Yadav (Supra), Vinod Kumar (Supra) and Sarjan Singh
(Supra) are not applicable to the facts of the present case.
38. Let us now consider the applicability of the ratio laid down in Union of India Vs. Sanjay Kumar
(Supra) upon which the State has placed reliance in order to assail the judgment of the learned
single Judge in CWJC No. 9329 of 2017. In the said case, the petitioner had invoked the writ
jurisdiction claiming appointment on compassionate grounds after death of his father on 18th
March, 1991. The application for appointment on Patna High Court L.P.A No.1305 of 2013
dt.18-04-2019 compassionate grounds was filed on 7th April, 1992 after he had attained majority.
The learned Single Judge had allowed the writ application for the reason that his application could
not be rejected simply on the ground that he is son from the second wife of the deceased. In appeal,
the Union of India through Ministry of Railways relied upon an order of a Division Bench to contend
that the compassionate appointment can be sought and granted only in terms of the policies framed
from time to time. Since the policy of the Railways specifically excluded compassionate appointment
to the second widow and her children, the writ-applicant would not be entitled to compassionate
appointment even if he is treated to be legitimate child for the purposes of Hindu Marriage Act,
1955. Moreover, the Division Bench, hearing the writ petition, doubting the correctness of the earlier
Division Bench judgment relied upon by the appellant Union of India wherein it was held that the
children born out of the second wife without permissions of the Railway authorities are not entitled
to seek compassionate appointment in terms of the circular issued by the Railways, referred the
matter to the Full Bench. The Full Bench, after hearing the parties, ruled as under:-
"We have heard learned counsel for the parties and find that right to seek
compassionate appointment emanates from Patna High Court L.P.A No.1305 of 2013
dt.18-04-2019 the policy of the employer. In the absence of policy of compassionate
appointment, there is no inherent right with the family members of the deceased to
seek compassionate appointment. If the policy of compassionate appointment does
not permit the second wife and/or her children for appointment on compassionate
grounds, this Court on the basis of right of inheritance will not confer the right to
seek compassionate appointment...."
39. Since the judgment of the Full Bench of this Court in Union of India Vs. Sanjay Kumar (Supra)
was with reference to the Railway Board's circular dated 02.01.1992, it is apposite to reproduce the
said circular hereunder :-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/96363548/ 16
The Bihar State Electricity Board And ... vs Chadra Shekhar Paswan on 18 April, 2019
"The General Manager (P) C.Rly. And others Sub:- Appointment on compassionate
grounds cases of second widow and her wards.
It is clarified that in the case of railway employees dying in harness etc. leaving more
than one widow along with children born to the 2nd wife, while settlement dues may
be shared by both the widows due to Court orders or otherwise on merits of each
case, appointments on compassionate grounds to the second widow and her children
are not to be Patna High Court L.P.A No.1305 of 2013 dt.18-04-2019 considered
unless the administration has permitted the second marriage, in special
circumstances, taking into account the persons law etc.
2. The fact that the second marriage is not permissible is invariably clarified in the
terms and conditions advised to the offer of initial appointment.
3. This may be kept in view and the case for compassionate appointment to the
second widow or her wards need not be forwarded to Railway Board.
4. Kindly acknowledge receipt.
Sd/-
(P.L.N. Sharma) Deputy Director, Estt. (N) Railway Board"
40. The legality of the aforesaid circular of the Railway Board was questioned in Namita Goldar
(Supra) before the Calcutta High Court in which the deceased employee had married for the second
time during the life time of his first wife as there was no issue with the first wife. The employee had
died in harness leaving behind two widows and four children. The first wife had died after the death
of the deceased employee and the family pension and other benefits were disbursed to the second
wife and her children. The compassionate appointment was claimed by the Patna High Court L.P.A
No.1305 of 2013 dt.18-04-2019 eldest son of the second wife as the first wife was issueless.
Following the decision in Rameshwari Devi (Supra), the Calcutta High Court allowed the claim
observing as under:-
"In view of the decision of the Apex Court in the case of Rameshwari Devi (supra), the
children of the second wife cannot be treated as illegitimate and referring to section
16 of the Hindu Marriage Act specifically held that children of a void marriage are
legitimate.
In view of the law as settled by the Supreme Court no distinction can be made amongst the children
of the first and second wife of a deceased employee. In the present case, however, first wife was
issueless and died shortly after the death of the employee concerned.
Therefore, the eldest son of the second wife, namely the petitioner No. 2 herein is entitled to claim
appointment of compassionate ground on account of the sudden death of the employee concerned.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/96363548/ 17
The Bihar State Electricity Board And ... vs Chadra Shekhar Paswan on 18 April, 2019
The learned Tribunal, in our opinion, has rightly held that the claim of the petitioner No. 2 herein
for compassionate appointment cannot be turned down on the ground it was done although the
learned Tribunal did not issue any mandatory direction on the Patna High Court L.P.A No.1305 of
2013 dt.18-04-2019 respondents authorities for granting compassionate appointment to the said
son of herein and directed the General Manager, Eastern Railway to refer the matter to the Railway
Board for taking decision. We are, however, of the opinion that the circular issued by the Railway
Board on 2nd January, 1992 preventing the children of the second wife from being considered for
appointments on compassionate ground cannot be sustained in the eye of law in view of the specific
provision of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and pursuant to the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of Rameshwari Devi (supra).
In the aforesaid circumstances, the aforesaid circular issued by the Railway Board on 2nd January,
1992 stands quashed to the extent it prevents the children of the second wife from being considered
for appointments on compassionate ground."
41. Since the Calcutta High Court, in Namita Goldar (Supra) had set aside the Railway Board's
circular dated 02.01.1992 to the extent the same prevented the children of the second wife from
being considered for appointment on compassionate ground, the same had lost its existence to that
extent. The concerned Railway Board had never challenged the Patna High Court L.P.A No.1305 of
2013 dt.18-04-2019 order of the Calcutta High Court passed in the case of Namita Goldar (Supra)
before the Apex Court. Thus, it had attained finality. It was desirable from the appellant Union of
India, East Central Railway and others to have brought this fact to the notice of the Full Bench of
this Court in Union of India Vs. Sanjay Kumar (Supra). Unfortunately, neither the appellant nor the
respondent apprised the Full Bench of this Court, the judgment of the Division Bench of the Calcutta
High Court in the case of Namita Goldar (Supra) in which Railway Board's Circular, dated
02.01.1992, was quashed to the extent it prevented the second wife or her children to compassionate
appointment. In absence of the material fact having been brought to the notice of this Court, the Full
Bench of this Court held that if the policy of the Railway Board of compassionate appointment does
not permit the second wife and/or her children for appointment on compassionate ground, on the
basis of right of inheritance, right to compassionate appointment cannot be conferred. The said
finding of the Full Bench is based on the circular of the Railway Board, which was not in existence. It
had become lifeless circular after the same was held ultra vires by the Calcutta High Court in Namita
Goldar (Supra).
42. At this stage, it would be apposite to refer to the Patna High Court L.P.A No.1305 of 2013
dt.18-04-2019 Division Bench decision of the Delhi High Court in Union of India Vs. Pankaj Kumar
Sharma [W.P.(C) 9008 of 2014] wherein challenge was made to the decision of the Central
Administrative Tribunal whereby the Tribunal had quashed the petitioner's communication dated
09.05.2012 rejecting the respondent's application for compassionate appointment and directed the
petitioner to consider his case for grant of compassionate appointment under the scheme. A
Division Bench of Delhi High Court dismissed the writ petition vide its judgment dated 19.12.2014
holding as under :-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/96363548/ 18
The Bihar State Electricity Board And ... vs Chadra Shekhar Paswan on 18 April, 2019
"The decision in Namita Goldar (supra) squarely applies in the facts of the present
case. The Calcutta High Court has held that the circular of the Railways - relied upon
by the petitioner in the present case as well, cannot be sustained in the light of the
provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1956. That decision, apparently, has attained
finality and binds the petitioner. The petitioner is precluded from re- agitating the
same issue again and again."
43. It further held :
"Once the law declares children born out of a void or illegitimate marriage to be
legitimate, no policy or circular of the State can seek to Patna High Court L.P.A
No.1305 of 2013 dt.18-04-2019 create a distinction or discriminate on the basis of the
status of the wedlock (i.e. valid or invalid), out of which a child is born. To permit the
same would be to bring in distinction and discrimination through the backdoor, and
nullify the effect of Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act."
44. Again the Madras High Court considered an identical issue in Union of India Vs. M.
Karumbayee (WP. No. 36981 of 2015) in which it had held that the children born out of void
marriages are legitimate. That case related to appointment on compassionate ground in Southern
Railway of a deceased employee's son born to his second wife as he did not have any issue from his
first wife. The claim was rejected by the Southern Railway Board on the ground that the children
born to the second wife were not recognized and the second wife was not entitled to any benefits as
per Railway Board's circular dated 02.01.1992. Upon challenge, the Central Administrative Tribunal,
Madras Bench allowed the original application on the basis of judgment rendered by the Division
Bench of Calcutta High Court in the case of Namita Goldar (Supra), which followed the decision of
the Supreme Court in the case of Rameshwari Devi (Supra), which specifically held that second
marriage during subsistence of first Patna High Court L.P.A No.1305 of 2013 dt.18-04-2019
marriage is illegitimate but the children born out of second wife are legitimate and are entitled to
the estate of the father. The Central Administrative Tribunal, therefore, held that no distinction can
be made amongst the children of the first and the second wife of a deceased employee. The Central
Administrative Tribunal, thus, quashed the 1992 circular issued by the Railway Board to the extent
it prevented the children of the second wife from being considered for appointment on
compassionate ground.
45. Upon challenge, in the writ petition filed by the Union of India against the order of the Central
Administrative Tribunal, the Division Bench of the Madras High Court held as under :-
"We have given our anxious consideration to the materials placed on record and the pleadings of the
parties.
We do not find any infirmity in the order passed by the learned Tribunal as the same was on the
basis of the Division Bench judgment of the Kolkatta High Court, which had followed the decision of
the Hon'ble Supreme Court. We also do not have any quarrel with the proposition of law laid down
by the Kolkatta High Court as the children born out of second marriage, cannot be treated as

illegitimate in the eye of law.
Patna High Court L.P.A No.1305 of 2013 dt.18-04-2019 In such view of the matter, the Writ Petition
is dismissed as devoid of merits and substance. No costs."
46. Being aggrieved by the order passed by the Madras High Court in the case of Union of India Vs.
M. Karumbayee (Supra), the Union of India and others preferred Special Leave Petition before the
Supreme Court, vide Diary No. 27352 of 2017, but the same was dismissed vide order dated
18.09.2017.
47. Recently in Union of India Vs. V.R.Tripathi (Supra), the Supreme Court has ruled as under :-
"Children do not choose their parents. To deny compassionate appointment though
the law treats a child of a void marriage as legitimate is deeply offensive to their
dignity and is offensive to the constitutional guarantee against discrimination."
48. It was a case in which the father of the respondent was employed as a Technician, Grade-I in
Central Railways at Mumbai. He died in harness on 28 November 2009. He had contracted a second
marriage during the subsistence of his first marriage. The respondent was the son born from the
second marriage of the employee, which was contracted in 1987. The respondent had applied Patna
High Court L.P.A No.1305 of 2013 dt.18-04-2019 for compassionate appointment on the death of
his father. His application was rejected on 6 March 2012 by the Railway authorities. Aggrieved by
the denial of compassionate appointment, the respondent had moved an Original Application before
the Central Administrative Tribunal. The Tribunal having held in favour of the respondent and upon
the dismissal of a petition seeking review, the Union of India and the Railway authorities instituted
writ proceedings before the Bombay High Court. In support of the writ petition, the appellants
relied upon the circular of the Board dated 02.01.1992 whereby the second widow and her children
were not to be considered for compassionate appointment unless the administration had permitted
the second marriage, in special circumstances, taking into account personal law etc.
49. After hearing the parties, the Bombay High Court had found no reason to differ with the view of
the Central Administrative Tribunal. Hence, the appellants assailed the judgment of the High Court
before the Supreme Court.
50. Having heard the parties, the Supreme Court, in Union of India Vs. V.R.Tripathi (Supra), while
dealing with the circular issued by the Railway Board, observed as under :-
Patna High Court L.P.A No.1305 of 2013 dt.18-04-2019 "The issue essentially is
whether it is open to an employer, who is amenable to Part III of the Constitution to
deny the benefit of compassionate appointment which is available to other legitimate
children. Undoubtedly, while designing a policy of compassionate appointment, the
State can prescribe the terms on which it can be granted. However, it is not open to
the State, while making the scheme or rules, to lay down a condition which is
inconsistent with Article 14 of the Constitution. The purpose of compassionate
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/96363548/ 20
The Bihar State Electricity Board And ... vs Chadra Shekhar Paswan on 18 April, 2019
appointment is to prevent destitution and penury in the family of a deceased
employee. The effect of the circular is that irrespective of the destitution which a child
born from a second marriage of a deceased employee may face, compassionate
appointment is to be refused unless the second marriage was contracted with the
permission of the administration. Once Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955
regards a child born from a marriage entered into while the earlier marriage is
subsisting to be legitimate, it would not be open to the State, consistent with Article
14 to exclude such a child from seeking the benefit of compassionate appointment.
Such a condition of exclusion is arbitrary and ultra vires."
(emphasis supplied) Patna High Court L.P.A No.1305 of 2013 dt.18-04-2019
51. While holding that the circular of the Railway Board creates two categories between one class of
legitimate children, The Supreme Court observed:-
"Though the law has regarded a child born from a second marriage as legitimate, a
child born from the first marriage of a deceased employee is alone made entitled to
the benefit of compassionate appointment.
The salutary purpose underlying the grant of compassionate appointment, which is to
prevent destitution and penury in the family of a deceased employee requires that
any stipulation or condition which is imposed must have or bear a reasonable nexus
to the object which is sought to be achieved."
52. In answer to the argument advanced on behalf of the appellants that it is open to the State, as
part of its policy of discouraging bigamy to restrict compassionate appointment, only to the spouse
and children of the first marriage and to deny spouse of the second marriage and the children, the
Supreme Court observed:-
"We are here concerned with the exclusion of children born from a second marriage.
By excluding a class of beneficiaries who have been deemed legitimate by the
operation of law, the condition imposed is Patna High Court L.P.A No.1305 of 2013
dt.18-04-2019 disproportionate to the object sought to be achieved. Having regard to
the purpose and object of a scheme of compassionate appointment, once the law has
treated such children as legitimate, it would be impermissible to exclude them from
being considered for compassionate appointment."
(emphasis supplied)
53. The Supreme Court also noticed the Division Bench judgment of Calcutta High Court in Namita
Goldar (Supra) whereby circular of the Railway Board dated 02.01.1992 to the extent that it
prevented the children of second wife from being considered for appointment on compassionate
ground was quashed. Its attention was also drawn to the judgment of the Division Bench of the
Madras High Court in Union of India Vs. M Karumbayee (Supra), which had followed Namita
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/96363548/ 21
The Bihar State Electricity Board And ... vs Chadra Shekhar Paswan on 18 April, 2019
Goldar (Supra). The Supreme Court noticed that Special Leave Petition filed against the judgment of
the Division Bench was dismissed by the Supreme Court on 18.09.2017.
54. Having noticed the aforesaid judgments, the Supreme Court observed:-
"Finally, it would be necessary to dwell on the submission which was urged on behalf
of the respondent that once the circular dated 2 Patna High Court L.P.A No.1305 of
2013 dt.18-04-2019 January 1992 was struck down by the Division Bench of the
Calcutta High Court in Namita Goldar (supra) and which was accepted and has been
implemented, it was not thereafter open to the railway authorities to rely upon the
same circular which has all India force and effect. There is merit in the submission.
Hence, we find it improper on the part of the Railway Board to issue a fresh circular
on 3 April 2013, reiterating the terms of the earlier circular dated 2 January, 1992
even after the decision in Namita Goldar (supra), which attained finality."
55. Apparently, the judgment passed in Union of India Vs. V.R. Tripathi (Supra) by the Supreme
Court is contrary to the Full Bench of this Court in Union of India Vs. Sanjay Kumar (Supra) as it
has acknowledged the right to the child of the second marriage and has also held that while
designing a policy of compassionate appointment, the State can prescribe the terms on which it can
be granted. However, it is not open to the State, while making the scheme or rules to lay down a
condition, which is inconsistent with Article 14 of the Constitution. It has acknowledged the right to
compassionate appointment to the child of second marriage under Section 16(1) and 16(3) of the
Hindu Marriage Act. The principle laid down by the Supreme Court Patna High Court L.P.A
No.1305 of 2013 dt.18-04-2019 supersedes those taken by the Full Bench of this Court in Union of
India Vs. Sanjay Kumar (Supra). The said principle having enunciated by the highest Court of the
land has a binding force. The authoritative pronouncement of apex court on the point of
compassionate appointment in V.R.Tripathi (Supra) eclipses the decision of the Full Bench of this
Court in Union of India Vs. Sanjay Kumar (Supra), which was even based on misconstruction of
Railway Board's circular dated 02.01.1992 as the said circular was not in existence after Namita
Goldar's case.
56. In the light of the authoritative pronouncement of the Supreme Court in Union of India Vs. V.R.
Tripathi (Supra), we find that the condition imposed by the circular no. 937 dated 23.06.2005
issued under the signature of Joint Secretary Personnel and Administrative Reforms Department,
Government of Bihar, Patna, which inter alia bars compassionate appointment to the children born
from second marriage of the deceased employee cannot be held to be legal and justified. Once
Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 regards a child born from a marriage entered into while
the earlier marriage is subsisting to be legitimate, the State cannot exclude such a child by issuing
circular or letter from seeking the benefit of compassionate appointment. Such a condition of
exclusion is arbitrary and ultra Patna High Court L.P.A No.1305 of 2013 dt.18-04-2019 vires.
57. We are also of the opinion that in view of the ratio laid down by the Supreme Court in Union of
India Vs. V.R.Tripathi (Supra), an employer, who is amenable to Part III of the Constitution cannot
deny the benefit of compassionate appointment, which is available to the other legitimate children.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/96363548/ 22
The Bihar State Electricity Board And ... vs Chadra Shekhar Paswan on 18 April, 2019
The State cannot lay down a condition while making the scheme or rules inconsistent with Article 14
of the Constitution. In view of Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, which regards a child
born from a marriage entered into while the earlier marriage is subsisting to be legitimate, the
condition of prior approval of the employer before the second marriage of the deceased employee
cannot be sine qua non to the children born out of second marriage. Such a condition of exclusion
would be arbitrary and ultra vires as it would bring out unconstitutional discrimination between
legitimate children, who form one class.
58. In view of rule 23 of the 1976 Rules as also the decisions of this Court and the decision of the
Supreme Court discussed above, we are of the opinion that if the second marriage was performed by
the government servant while in service, the same would amount to misconduct committed in
service. In case, an employee is proceeded against for such misconduct while in Patna High Court
L.P.A No.1305 of 2013 dt.18-04-2019 service and misconduct is proved, the government may be free
to take any action against such employee. In case of punishment awarded to the government
employee, the same may be a relevant consideration for denying the prayer for compassionate
appointment of dependents of the deceased employee. However, if no disciplinary proceeding is
initiated for any misconduct against an employee while in service, after his death, his dependents
cannot be denied compassionate appointment on the ground that while in service the employee had
been guilty of misconduct. In other words, the claim for compassionate appointment to the
dependents of the deceased employee can be denied only if the employee had committed illegalities
and misconduct is proved and he is punished during his service career.
59. Having held so, when we look to the order dated 13.08.2012 passed by the learned Single Judge
in CWJC No. 9329 of 2012, we find that while allowing the writ petition the learned Single Judge
has quashed the circular no. 937 dated 23.06.2005 issued under the signature of the Joint Secretary,
Personnel and Administrative Reforms Department, Government of Bihar, Patna and directed the
respondents to appoint the petitioner on compassionate ground on the post to which he is entitled.
60. We are of the opinion that the aforesaid circular dated Patna High Court L.P.A No.1305 of 2013
dt.18-04-2019 23.06.2005 should not have been quashed in its entirety. We are also of the opinion
that no direction could have been given by the learned Single Judge to the respondents to appoint
the petitioner on compassionate ground on the post to which he is entitled. The learned Single
Judge ought to have quashed the circular to the extent it prevented the children of the second wife
from being considered for appointment on compassionate ground. Similarly, instead of issuing
direction to the respondents to appoint the petitioner on compassionate ground, the learned Single
Judge ought to have directed the respondents to consider the case of the petitioner for appointment
on compassionate ground as it is well settled position in law that appointment on compassionate
ground is not a source of recruitment. It is exception to the general rule. The purpose of
compassionate appointment is to prevent destitution and penury in the family of a deceased
employee. The person seeking appointment on compassionate ground under a scheme has a right to
be considered for appointment, which needs to be decided on the facts of each individual case
keeping in mind as to whether the applicant needs all stipulations of the scheme including financial
need and other requirements.
