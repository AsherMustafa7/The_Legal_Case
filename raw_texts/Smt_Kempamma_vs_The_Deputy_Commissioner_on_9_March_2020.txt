This writ petition is filed under Articles 226 & 227 of the
Constitution of India praying to call for the entire records
pertaining to order of the 1st respondent in PTCL Appeal
No.32/2002-03 dated:24.09.2010 under Annexure-A & etc.,
This writ petition, coming on for hearing, this day, the
Court, made the following:
ORDER
This writ petition is directed against the order dated 24.09.2010 passed by the Deputy
Commissioner vide Annexure- A and the order dated 28.11.2002 passed by the Assistant
Commissioner vide Annexure-B whereby the authorities have resumed the land in favour of the
legal representatives of the original grantees under Sections 4 and 5 of the Karnataka Scheduled
Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prohibition of Transfer of Certain Lands) Act, 1978 (for short, 'the
PTCL Act').
2. The brief facts of the case are that the land bearing Sy.No.64 measuring 3 acres situated at
Mallenahally Village, Dabbeghatta Hobli, Turuvekere Taluk, Tumkur District was originally granted
in favour of one Thopina Thimmaiah under Darkasth Rules on 25.02.1955. The legal representatives
of the original grantee sold the land in favour of one Patel Linge Gowda by a sale deed dated
16.12.1964. After the PTCL Act came into force, the legal representatives of the original grantee
Thimmaiah have filed an application under Sections 4 and 5 of the PTCL Act before the Assistant
Commissioner for resumption of land in the year 1979. The Assistant Commissioner by order dated
12.04.1982 resumed the land in favour of the legal representatives of the original grantee.
3. In the aforesaid survey number, another 3 acres of land was granted in favour of one Venkataiah,
S/o.Thimmaiah on 25.02.1955. The legal representatives of the original grantee sold 2 acres to Patel
Linge Gowda on 30.06.1967 and remaining 1 acre has been sold in favour of one Boregowda,
S/o.Lingegowda on 17.04.1972 and 21.09.1974. The legal representatives of the original grantee have
filed an application for resumption of land before the Assistant Commissioner under Sections 4 and
5 of the PTCL Act in the year 1992. The Assistant Commissioner by order dated 08.12.1992 resumed
the land in favour of the legal representatives of the original grantee.
4. In the aforesaid survey number 64, the competent authority has granted 4 acres of land in favour
of one Thimmaiah @ Dadithimmaiah on 25.02.1955. The legal representatives of the original
grantee one Javaregowda sold the land in favour of Patel Lingegowda on 22.11.1960. After the PTCL
Act came into force, the legal representatives of the original grantee have filed an application before
the Assistant Commissioner for resumption of the land in the year 1992. The Assistant
Commissioner has allowed the application and resumed the land in favour of the legal
representatives of the original grantee on 25.02.1993.

5. Against the order passed by the Assistant Commissioner in all the aforesaid cases the petitioners
have filed an appeal before the Deputy Commissioner under Section 5A of the PTCL Act. The Deputy
Commissioner by order dated 31.03.1999 allowed the appeal and remanded the matter to the
Assistant Commissioner for fresh consideration in accordance with the law laid down by this Court
in the case of PEDDAREDDY vs. STATE OF KARNATAKA reported in ILR 1993 Kar.551. After the
matter has been remanded to the Assistant Commissioner, the Assistant Commissioner has
re-numbered the petition as PTCL No.12/1999-2000. The Assistant Commissioner by order dated
28.11.2002 allowed the applications and resumed the land in favour of the legal representatives of
the original grantee. Being aggrieved by the same, petitioners filed an appeal before the Deputy
Commissioner under Section 5A of the PTCL Act. The Deput4y Commissioner by order dated
24.09.2010 dismissed the appeal confirming the order passed by the Assistant Commissioner. Being
aggrieved by the same, the petitioners are before this Court.
6. Sri H.P.Leeladhar, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners submitted that the land has been
granted in all cases on 25.02.1955 in Sy.No.64 situated in Mallenahally Village, Dabbeghatta Hobli,
Turuvekere Taluk, tumkur District. The total extent of the land of 10 acres was purchased by the
predecessors of the petitioners by different sale deeds and they are in peaceful possession and
enjoyment of the property. The PTCL Act came into force on 01.01.10979. The legal representatives
of the original grantees have filed applications before the Assistant Commissioner under Sections 4
and 5 of the PTCL Act after a long delay. The applications are not maintainable. In support of his
case, he has relied on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of NEKKANTI
RAMALAKSHMI vs. STATE OF KARNATAKA AND ANOTHER reported in 2017 SCC Online SC
1862. Hence, he sought for allowing the writ petition.
7. Per contra, Smt.Savitramma, learned Government Pleader appearing for respondent Nos. 1 and 2
and Sri N.Surendra Kumar, learned counsel appearing for respondent No.4 contended that the land
In dispute has been granted in favour of the grantees under Darkhast Rules on 25.02.1955 with a
condition of non-alienation for a period of 20 years. By violating the condition the legal
representatives of the original grantees have sold the land in favour of the petitioners. Therefore, the
authorities have rightly passed an order resuming the land in favour of the legal representatives of
the original grantees. They further contended that in respect of the land granted in favour of
Thimmaiah, S/o. Kariyappa, the application filed is in time, i.e., in the year 1979-80. Therefore,
there is no delay in invoking the provisions of Sections 4 and 5 of the PTCL Act. In respect of that
land is concerned, the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in NEKKANTI RAMALAKSHMI (supra)
is not applicable. Hence, they sought for dismissal of the writ petition.
8. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the writ papers.
9. It is not in dispute that the land bearing Sy.No.64 situated in Mallenahally Village, Dabbeghatta
Hobli, Turuvekere Taluk, Tumkur District totally measuring 10 acres has been granted to different
persons under Darkasth Rules on 25.02.1955. The legal representatives of the original grantees have
sold the land in favour of petitioners' predecessors by different sale deeds. The aforesaid land has
been alienated contrary to the Land Grant Rules by violating the conditions. The PTCL Act came
into force on 01.01.1979. Since there is violation of condition of the land grant the legal

Smt. Kempamma vs The Deputy Commissioner on 9 March, 2020
representatives of the original grantees have filed an application for resumption of the land under
Sections 4 and 5 of the PTCL Act before the Assistant Commissioner. In respect of the land granted
in favour of Thimmaiah, S/o.Kariyappa to the extent of 3 acres is concerned, the application filed is
in time. Therefore, the contention of the petitioners that in view of the law laid down by the Hon'ble
Apex Court in the case of NEKKANTI RAMALAKSHMI (supra) the application is not maintainable
is unsustainable. Therefore, the impugned order in respect of the land granted in favour of one
Thimmaiah, S/o.Kariyappa to the extent of 3 acres is confirmed.
10. In respect of the land granted in favour of one Venkatappa to the extent of 3 acres and to one
Thimmaiah, S/o.Javaraiah to the extent of 4 acres are concerned, they have filed the application for
resumption of the land in the year 1992 after a lapse of 13 years from the date the Act came into
force. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of NEKKANTI RAMALAKSHMI (supra) has held as
hereinbelow:
"8. However, the question that arises is with regard to terms of Section 5 of the Act
which enables any interested person to make an application for having the transfer
annulled as void under Section 4 of the Act. This Section does not prescribe any
period within which such an application can be made. Neither does it prescribe the
period within which suo motu action may be taken. This Court in the case of Chhedi
Lal Yadav & Ors. vs. Hari Kishore Yadav (D) Thr. Lrs. & Ors., 2017(6) SCALE 459 and
also in the case of Ningappa vs. Dy. Commissioner & Ors. (C.A. No. 3131 of 2007,
decided on 14.07.2011) reiterated a settled position in law that whether Statute
provided for a period of limitation, provisions of the Statute must be invoked within a
reasonable time. It is held that action whether on an application of the parties, or suo
motu, must be taken within a reasonable time. That action arose under the provisions
of a similar Act which provided for restoration of certain lands to farmers which were
sold for arrears of rent or from which they were ejected for arrears of land from 1st
January, 1939 to 31st December, 1950. This relief was granted to the farmers due to
flood in the Kosi 2River which make agricultural operations impossible. An
application for restoration was made after 24 years and was allowed. It is in that
background that this Court upheld that it was unreasonable to do so. We have no
hesitation in upholding that the present application for restoration of land made by
respondent-Rajappa was made after an unreasonably long period and was liable to be
dismissed on that ground. Accordingly, the judgments of the Karnataka High Court,
namely, R. Rudrappa vs. Deputy Commissioner, 2000 (1) Karnataka Law Journal,
523, Maddurappa vs. State of Karnataka, 2006 (4) Karnataka Law Journal, 303 and
G. Maregouda vs. The Deputy Commissioner, Chitradurga District, Chitradurga and
Ors, 2000(2) Kr. L.J.Sh. N.4B holding that there is no limitation provided by Section
5 of the Act and, therefore, an application can be made at any time, are overruled.
Order accordingly."
11. A Division Bench of this Court in the case of NINGAMMA vs. THE TIBETIAN CHILDREN'S
VILLAGE HQRS: DHARMASHALA & OTHERS (W.A.No.4092/2017 disposed of on 09.04.2019)has
held that if the application for resumption of land is filed after a lapse of 12 years, it is unreasonable
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/113076439/ 5
Smt. Kempamma vs The Deputy Commissioner on 9 March, 2020
delay and the application is not maintainable.
12. In the case on hand, the land measuring 3 acres granted in favour of Venkatappa and 4 acres in
favour of Thimmaiah, S/o.Javaraiah were sold in the years 1960, 1967, 1972 and 1974 and the PTCL
Act came into force on 01.01.1979 and the application for resumption of the land has been filed in
the year 1992 after a lapse of 13 years from the date the Act came into force. In view of the law laid
down by the Hon'ble Apex Court and of this Court in the aforesaid judgments, the applications filed
by the legal representatives of the original grantees itself are not maintainable. Hence, the impugned
order in respect of these two extents are liable to be quashed.
13. Accordingly, the writ petition is allowed in part. The order passed by the Assistant Commissioner
dated 28.11.2002 vide Annexure-B and the order passed by the Deputy Commissioner dated
24.09.2010 vide Annexure-A, in so far as the grant of land in favour of Venkatappa to the extent of 3
acres and in favour of Thimmaiah, S/o.Javaraiah to the extent of 4 acres are quashed. In so far as
the land to the extent of 3 acres which was granted in favour of one Thimmaiah, S/o.Kariyappa is
concerned, the orders of both the authorities are confirmed.
