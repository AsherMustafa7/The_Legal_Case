JAISWAL
ORAL JUDGMENT
Date : 16-01-2019 Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned counsel for O.P. No. 1 on the
aforesaid review petition.
The petitioner has filed this review petition to review the judgment dated 11.05.2018 passed by this
Court in Miscellaneous Appeal No. 17 of 2012, whereby this Court finding appellant/O.P. No. 1
United India Insurance Company Limited not liable to pay compensation to the claimant
indemnifying the owner of the vehicle exonerated it from the liability of payment of compensation to
the claimant and set aside the judgment and award passed by the learned Tribunal. Patna High
Court C. REV. No.279 of 2018 dt.16-01-2019 It is submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner
that the deceased was travelling on the trailor, which is hailing to Sri. P.K. Jha, brother of the
deceased and there has been partition between the deceased and his brother preceding to his death
in accident and the deceased was travelling on the said vehicle in his separate status and entity as a

labourer, so he had not stepped into the shoe of the owner of the vehicle rather he happens to be a
third party of the case. It is further submitted that as the offending vehicle was insured and the
insurance policy was valid and enforceable at the time of accident, hence the Insurance Company is
liable to pay compensation to the claimant, in case of death of the deceased hence the impugned
judgment passed by this Court is liable to be reviewed, holding the insurance company liable for the
payment of compensation.
Per contra, it is submitted by the learned counsel for the O.P. No. 1 that the tractor and trailor both
were hailing to father of the deceased, who happens to be its registered owner. The petitioner has
neither taken any such case that the aforesaid trailor is hailing to brother of the deceased nor has
adduced any evidence either in this Court or before the learned Tribunal and finding the deceased to
have stepped Patna High Court C. REV. No.279 of 2018 dt.16-01-2019 into shoe of his father by
travelling on the said trailor, who has died in accident during the course of travelling, this Court has
rightly found Insurancy Company not liable to pay compensation as the owner of the vehicle and
claimant both cannot be one and the same person. It is further submitted that even if the trailor is
hailing to brother of the deceased, in that case also, the deceased would be considered to have
stepped into the shoe of his brother and he does not happen to be a third party rather owner of the
trailor. Hence, in that case also, Insurance company is not liable to pay compensation to the
claimant. It is further submitted that the aforesaid tractor and trailor was insured by the appellant
under the Act only policy. As the vehicle was insured only under the Act only policy, it has not
covered the risk of the owner of the vehicle in question. It is also submitted that there is no error
apparent on the face of the record in passing the impugned judgment. The petitioner has virtually
filed appeal assailing the impugned judgment of this Court in the guise of review which is not
maintainable and is liable to be dismissed.
From perusal of record, it appears that deceased was travelling on the trailor at the time of accident
and sustained injury during the course of travelling which proved fatal. As Patna High Court C. REV.
No.279 of 2018 dt.16-01-2019 per the material available on record, the aforesaid trailor was hailing
to his father, who happens to be its registered owner and as deceased happened to be the son of the
registered owner of the trailor, he stepped into the shoe of the owner of the vehicle i.e. insured and
became the owner of the vehicle. Though the petitioner has taken the case that there has been
partition between the father and the deceased and in buttress of his aforesaid case, he has filed rent
receipts and report of the Amin on the mutation petition indicating that there has been partition
amongst the sons of raiyat of land and rent receipts are being issued in the name of the insured and
his sons separately. But he has not brought on record any evidence regarding any partition amongst
the deceased and the insured by metes and bounds either through the Court or by way of deed of
partition. Mere issuance of rents receipts separately in the name of the deceased and the insured, in
my considered opinion, is not sufficient to establish the partition between the deceased and the
insured. Rent receipt is mainly for the revenue purposes and it does not decide the right and title of
the parties over the property.
The claimant has not filed any document either before the Tribunal or before this Court in buttress
of her case Patna High Court C. REV. No.279 of 2018 dt.16-01-2019 that the aforesaid trailor was
hailing to brother of deceased, namely, P.K. Jha. Even if the case of the claimant is taken to be true

in that case also as the deceased happened to be the brother of the said P.K. Jha, he stepped into the
shoe of the alleged owner of the vehicle i.e. insured and became owner of said trailor, so in either
way, the deceased became the owner of the vehicle. The insurance company is not liable to
indemnify the owner of the vehicle. It would be liable to cover all the risk of third party. It is settled
principle of law that if the insured cannot be fastened with any liability under the provisions of
Motor Vehicle Act, the question of insurer being liable to indemnify the insured, therefore, does not
arise. Record further indicates that the vehicle in question was insured only under the Act only
policy. It has not covered the risk of the owner so on all count Insurance Company is not liable to
pay compensation to the claimant.
Having considered all aspects of the case, this Court by the impugned judgment has set aside the
judgment and award passed by the learned Tribunal exonerating the Insurance Company from
liability of payment of compensation to the claimant. This Court finds no error apparent on the face
of the record in the said judgment.
Patna High Court C. REV. No.279 of 2018 dt.16-01-2019 Virtually the petitioner seems to have
assailed the aforesaid judgment of this Court in the guise of the review petition which is not
permissible in the eye of law. Hence, finding no substance in the aforesaid petition, it is hereby
dismissed.
