[4] Mr. N. Mahendra, learned counsel for the petitioner,
relies on the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Ajay Kumar Choudhary Vs. Union
of India (UOI) & Anr. reported as (2015) 7 SCC 291 where in para 13 & 14 it was held that
suspension of an employee in violation of Rule 10 of CCS (CCA) Rule is not justified even if the case
was pending against an employee. Reliance was also placed in the case of Union of India (UOI) &
Ors. vs. Dipak Mali reported as (2010) 2 SCC 222 in para 11 it was held that the suspension order in
violation of Sub-Rule (6) of Rule 10 of the CCS (CCA) is invalid and the period of suspension has to
be reviewed before the expiry of the period of suspension. [5] Mr. Shyam Sharma, learned G.A. for

(iii) 97(05)2022 LPS U/S 465/466/468/471/420/120-B IPC, are pending before the petitioner.

180 days with effect from 12.11.2023. It is submitted that the subsequent extension order has not
been challenged and the petitioner cannot get the benefit of technicalities of Rule 10 in view of the
pendency of the multiple FIRs for his alleged involvement.
WP(C) No. 35 of 2023 Page 2
[7] Mr. Shyam Sharma, learned G.A. for the State
respondent, also refers to a decision of the Hon'ble Supreme court reported as (1997) 4 SCC 1 to the
effect that in case of serious offence the suspension for a period of 10 (ten) years is also permissible.
[8] This Court has considered the submissions made at the bar, perused the materials on record and
the relevant statutes and the law in this regard.
[9] On perusal of the order dated 23.01.2021, it is seen that the suspension of the petitioner is in
contemplation of the disciplinary proceeding in connection with manipulation of land record along
with NH-02 extension project. There is no material on record for extension of the suspension order
dated 23.01.2021 before the expiry of 90 days as contemplated under Sub-Rule (6) of Rule 10 of CCS
(CCA) Rules, 1965.
[10] In the counter affidavit filed by the State respondent at Annexure - R/1, the order dated
12.11.2023 wherein the original suspension order dated 23.01.2021 was further extended for another
period of 180 days with effect from 12.11.2023. It is not on record that anything regarding the
extension of the initial suspension order dated 23.10.2021 after 24.01.2021 and also 180 days after
second extension expires on 11.05.2024. It is in contravention of Sub-Rule (6) of Rule 10 that
extension or review of the period of suspension should be before the expiry of the period of
suspension.
WP(C) No. 35 of 2023 Page 3
[11] In the present case, the first extension order was after
two and half years of the earlier extension order and there is no extension of the second order.
[12] This Court is of the view that the extension orders are not done as stipulated in Sub-Rule (6) of
Rule 10 and hence, are invalid in terms of Sub-Rule (7) of Rule 10 of the CCS (CCA) Pension Rules.
Accordingly, the suspension order dated 23.01.2021 of the petitioner is set aside and the petitioner
be re-instated in his service with immediate effect along with due salary and allowances, if any.
However, it is made clear that this Court does not express any opinion on merit on the pending of
the FIR cases against the petitioner and the State respondent may pursue the same as per law. [13]
With these observations and directions, writ petition is allowed.
