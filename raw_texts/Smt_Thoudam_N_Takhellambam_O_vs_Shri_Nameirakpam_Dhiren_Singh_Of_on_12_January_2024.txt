Smt. Thoudam (N) Takhellambam (O) ... vs Shri Nameirakpam Dhiren Singh Of ... on 12 January, 2024
(ii) The facts leading to the filing of the present civil Revision Petition succinctly
stated that the present petitioner instituted the original money suit being M. S. No.
66 of 2020 before the Ld. Civil Judge (Senior Division), Imphal West praying for;
(a) a decree for recovery of Rs. 5,00000/- (Rupees dive lakhs) only;
(b) a decree for the cost of litigation;
(c) any other relief or reliefs which the Hon'ble Court deems fit to be awarded, be
awarded in the nature of the suit in the ends of justice.
(iii) Thereafter, the Respondents file an application under Order XXXVII Rule 3(5)
read with section 151 of C.P.C. 1908 before the Civil Judge (Senior Division) Imphal
West praying for granting leave to defend and the same is registered as Judicial Misc.
Case No. 46 of 2021.
(iv) The Ld. Civil Judge (Senior Division) Imphal West vide its order dated
09-12-2022 passed in Judicial Misc. Case No. 46 of 2021 allowed the leave to defend
filed by the Respondent.
(v) The petitioner had given a legal notice to both the Respondents and in reply to it
the Respondents had accepted the debt of Rs. 5,00,000/- (Rupees five lakhs) only
and further stated that she Page 2|7 had already paid Rs. 1,00,000/- (Rupees one
lakh) only and Rs.
4,00,000/- (Rupees four lakhs) only are indebted.
(vi) The Respondents on 10-06-2018 undertake to repay the said amount of Rs. 5,00,000/- (Rupees
five lakhs) only to the petitioner by executing a written undertaking in Manipuri language.
(vii) Inspite of existence of all these documents the Ld. Civil Court erred in allowing the J.M. Case
No. 46 of 2021 (Leave to defend) which amounts to gross injustice.
(ix) Being aggrieved by the order dated 09.12.2022 passed in Judicial Misc. Case No. 46 of 2021 the
petitioner begs to prefer this Civil Revision Petition on the grounds herein below:-
(i) The Ld. Civil Judge (Sr. Divn.), Impha; West failed to appreciate the existence of
the reply legal notice sent by the counsel of the Respondent wherein it is accepted
that the Appellant have hander over a sum of Rs.
5,00,000/- (Rupees five lakhs) only to the Respondents and further accepted that the Respondents
are yet to pay an amount of Rs. 4,00,000/- (Rupees four lakhs) only to the Appellant as the
Respondents have already gave an amount of Rs. 1,00,000/- (Rupees one lakhs) only during the
month of December, 2019.

Smt. Thoudam (N) Takhellambam (O) ... vs Shri Nameirakpam Dhiren Singh Of ... on 12 January, 2024
(ii) The Ld. Civil Judge (Sr. Divn.), Imphal West failed to appreciated the fact that the Respondents
have put their signature in the said undertaking dated 10.06.2018 executed in the Non-Judicial
Stamp paper which they have admitted in their reply legal notice.
In view of the facts and circumstances as stated above, the petitioner prayed for;
"(i) to admit this Revision;
Page 3|7
(ii) to call for the records of the case;
(iii) to set aside the impugned order dated 09-12-2022 passed by the Hon'ble Civil
Judge (Sr. Divn.), Imphal West in Judicial Misc. Case No. 46 of 2021;
(iv) to pass any order or orders as your Honour Lordship may deem fit and proper in
the facts and circumstances of the case."
[3] On perusal of the Judgment and order dated 09.12.2022, it is seen that the Ld. Civil Judge (Sr.
Divn.), Imphal West minutely discussed about the facts put up by both parties and further on careful
perusal of the aforementioned impugned order, it is found that the present respondent in the
present Civil Revision Petition (petitioner in Judl. Misc. Case No. 46 of 2021) denied the factum of
execution of the promissory note and receiving of any consideration of the promissory note, while
the petitioner and the respondent are pleaded to be involved in business together, the present
respondent pleaded that the promissory note was obtained by way of fraud i.e the promissory note
was a fraud document. Further, the respondents have averred that the signature in the promissory
note dated 10.06.2018 are not theirs and that they have never executed the promissory note.
[4] The Hon'ble Supreme Court observed in the para 16 of the [(2017) 1 Supreme Court Cases 568 -
IDBI Trusteeship Services Limited Vs. Hubtown Limited] that:-
"(16) It is thus clear that Order 37 has suffered a change in 1976, and that change has
made a difference in the law laid down. First and foremost, it is important to
remember that Milkhiram case6 is a direct authority on the amended Order 37
provision, as the amended provision in Order 37 Rule 3 is the same as the Bombay
amendment which this Court was considering in the aforesaid judgment. We must
hasten to add Page 4|7 that the two provisos to sub-rule (3) were not, however, there
in the Bombay amendment. These are new, and the effect to be given to them is
something that we will have to decide. The position in law now is that the trial Judge
is vested with a discretion which has to result in justice being done on the facts of
each case. But Justice, like Equality, another cardinal constitutional value, on the one
hand, and arbitrariness on the other, are sworn enemies. The discretion that Judge

Smt. Thoudam (N) Takhellambam (O) ... vs Shri Nameirakpam Dhiren Singh Of ... on 12 January, 2024
exercises under Order 37 to refuse leave to defend or to grant conditional or
unconditional leave to defend is a discretion akin to Joseph's multi-coloured coat - a
large number of baffling alternatives present themselves. The life of the law not being
logic but the experience of the trial Judge, is what comes to the rescue in these cases;
but at the same time informed by guidelines or principles that we propose to lay
down to obviate exercise of judicial discretion in an arbitrary manner. At one end of
the spectrum is unconditional leave to defend, granted in all cases which present a
substantial defence. At the other end of the spectrum are frivolous or vexatious
defences, leading to refusal of leave to defend. In between these two extremes are
various kinds of defences raised which yield conditional leave to defend in most
cases. It is these defences that have to be guided by broad principles which are
ultimately applied by the trial Judge so that justice is done on the facts of each given
case.
(17) Accordingly, the principles stated in para 8 of Mechelec case4 will now stand
superseded, given the amendment of Order 37 Rule 3 and the binding decision of
four Judges in Milkhiram case6, as follows:
(17.1) If the defendant satisfies the court that he has a substantial defence, that is, a
defence that is likely to succeed, the plaintiff is not entitled to leave to sign judgment,
and the defendant is entitled to unconditional leave to defend the suit."
Page 5|7 [5] And again in para 15 of [(2010) 9 Supreme Court Cases 385 - Jai Sing and others Vs.
Municipal Corporation of Delhi and Another] :-
"15. We have anxiously considered the submissions of the learned counsel. Before we
consider the factual and legal issues involved herein, we may notice certain well-
recognised principles governing the exercise of jurisdiction by the High Court under
Article 227 of the Constitution of India. Undoubtedly the High Court, under this
article, has the jurisdiction to ensure that all subordinate courts as well as statutory
or quasi-judicial tribunals, exercise the powers vested in them, within the bounds of
their authority. The High Court has the power and the jurisdiction to ensure that they
act in accordance with the well-established principles of law. The High Court is
vested with the powers of superintendence and /or judicial revision, even in matters
where no revision or appeal lies to the High Court. The jurisdiction under this article
is, in some ways, wider than the power and jurisdiction under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India. It is, however, well to remember the well-known adage that
greater the power, greater the care and caution in exercise thereof. The High Court is,
therefore, expected to exercise such wide powers with great care, caution and
circumspection. The exercise of jurisdiction must be within the well-recognised
constraints. It can not be exercised like a "bull in a china shop", to correct all errors of
judgment of a court, or tribunal, acting within the limits of its jurisdiction. This
correctional jurisdiction can be exercised in cases where orders have been passed in
grave dereliction of duty or in flagrant abuse of fundamental principles of law or

justice".
[6] In view of the facts and circumstances herein above discussed and on the observations made in
the above 2(two) Hon'ble Supreme Court cases, it is decided that there is no room for Page 6|7
interference of the order passed by the Ld. Civil Judge (Sr. Divn.), Imphal West in Judicial Misc.
Case No. 46 of 2021 as the defendants satisfies the court that they have a substantial defence, that is,
a defence that is likely to succeed and the defendant is entitled to unconditional leave to defend the
suit.
[7] Accordingly, the present Civil Revision Petition No. 3 of 2023 is dismissed and disposed of
without costs. However, the petitioner is given liberty to file a fresh application on other grounds, if
desired.
