JUDGMENT & ORDER
(CAV)
This writ petition has been filed by the petitioner to quash the impugned letter dated 13.11.2020 and
to uphold the order of SDM/Sadar Hills, dated 18.6.1971 passed in Misc. Case No.23/71.
2. Brief facts are as follows:
Purum Khullen village was established since the time of their forefathers and in 1612,
during the period of Maharaja Khagemba, the settlement of Purum Khullen village
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/85743930/ 2
Shri David Purum vs The State Of Manipur on 27 February, 2023
was declared and recorded on stone tablet. Again, in 1723 during the period of
Maharaja Pamheiba, the settlement of Purum Khullen village was also recorded on
stone tablet during the tenure of Telheiba, the then Chief of Purum Khullen and again
in 1748. The villagers have been paying their hill house tax through the Deputy
Commissioner even before the establishment of the State and subsequently under the
Manipur Hill Areas (House Tax) Act, 1966 without any break till date for the land
they use.
3. Purum Khullen village was recognized under the Manipur State Hill Peoples (Administration)
Regulation, 1947 and subsequently, by the State Government and the village constituted their own
Village Authorities under the Manipur (Village Authorities in Hill Areas) Act, 1956. Purum Khullen
village has its own distinct and independent boundaries as the title is perfected and it has two
colonies, namely Happy Valley towards the north, P. Gelyang towards the south and Purum Khullen
in the middle and the aforesaid two colonies were form within the land of Purum Khullen village
since 1969.The Court of SDM/Sadar Hills, by an order dated 18.6.1971 in Misc. Case No.23/71,
recognized the settlement land area of Purum Khullen demarcated and issued a Map in recognition
of the said land.
4. In continuation of the State's developmental project, construction for Manipur International
University at Purum Khullen has been underway. As such, on 17.11.2020, the villagers employed
workers for leveling of land. However, some officials alleged to be from DFO, Central Range,
Mantripukhri, intervened and forcefully stopped the ongoing construction work saying that the said
land is situated within Sambei Purum Reserve Forest and not to continue any activity without their
permission. Aggrieved by the same, the petitioner submitted a representation to the Hon'ble
Minister (Forest) on 24.10.2020 for upholding the order passed by the SDM/Sadar dated 18.6.1971.
However, surprisingly, the Chief Conservator showed the impugned letter dated 13.11.2020 with
Map cancelling the order passed by the SDM/Sadar dated 18.6.1971. Challenging the order dated
13.11.2020, the petitioner has filed the writ petition.
5. The fifth respondent raising preliminary objection as to the maintainability of the writ petition
has filed affidavit-in-opposition stating that Sambei Purum Reserved Forest came into effect in the
year 1936 after a resolution of the Manipur State Darbar being Resolution No.4(A) dated 7.10.1936.
The said Darbar Resolution spelt out clearly the boundary of Sambei Purum Reserved Forest. Since
7.10.1936, Sambei Purum Hill Range has been a full-fledged Reserved Forest owned by the then
Princely State of Manipur under British Rule. Later, after Manipur was merged into the Union of
India, the Reserved Forest has been legally protected under the Indian Forest Act, 1927 through the
Manipur Administration Order, 1949, the Merged States (Laws) Act, 1949 and the Part C State's Act,
1950. Now, the Sembei Purum Reserved Forest is under the control and regulations of the Forest
Department, Government of Manipur. Purum Khullen village is made in the Darbar Resolution
No.4(A) dated 7.10.1936 on one hand and on the other, Purum Khullen is a very old village which
came into being during the olden Kings time.
6. It is stated that no mention is made of Purum Khullen village in the Darbar Resolution, which
confirms that Puurum Khullen village is outside the boundary limit of the Sambei Purum Reserved

Shri David Purum vs The State Of Manipur on 27 February, 2023
Forest. Present day, Purum Khullen village barring few households in the nearby hills is situated at
the foothills away from the boundary of the Sambei Purum Reserved Forest. The area presently
occupied by the main Purum Khullen village is covered by the cadastral survey map of 1960.
7. It is stated that the order of the SDM, Sadar Hills dated 18.6.1971 passed in Misc. Case No.23/71
recognizing settlement land area of Purum Khullen within the Sambei Purum Reserved Forest is
unfortunate if it were done so. The subsequent map prepared by the Sub Deputy Collector, Saikul
from the description of boundary by the SDM in his order dated 18.6.1971 shall cease to stand as it
violates the provisions of the Indian Forest Act, 1927.
8. It is stated that the attempt to construct and establish the Manipur International University
within the Sambei Purum Reserved Forest near Purum Khullen is clearly in violation of Section 26
of the Indian Forest Act, 1927. The Chief of Purum Khullen village, in deliberate disobedience,
started excavating huge amount of hill earth by felling the slope of the hills and removing the hill
earth without authority and violating Section 26 of the Act.
9. It is stated that there are few households of Purum Khullen village in the Reserved Forest Area
near the site where the Chief had tried to construct and establish the Manipur International
University. The vesting rights of the households shall be only after the fulfillment of the provisions
of the Act and the villagers residing within the Reserved Forest should apply in the prescribed
methods as given in the Indian Forest Act. Hence, it is prayed for dismissal of the writ petition.
10. Assailing the impugned letter, the learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the
petitioner who is the Chief of Purum Khullen village has established and occupied the land in
question since the time of his forefathers till date without any interference and the village has its
own distinct and independent boundaries. He would submit that at present the housing settlement
of Purum Khullen village is described north by Sagolmang Lingpikhong and Lok; south by Geijang
Khongjaiching; east by Iril river and west by Purum Khuman Chingsang. As such the villagers are
the absolute land owners of the land in question, as it has been inherited from their forefathers and
has been settling upon the said land peacefully.
11. The learned counsel further submitted that the villagers have been paying hill house tax even
before establishment of the State and after becoming State, they are paying tax under the Manipur
Hill Areas (House Tax) Act, 1966 to the State through the Chief/Headman without any break till
date for the land they use. The villagers have been enjoying the products of the land by way of
planting paddy fields, growing seasonal crops openly without any interference from any quarter.
12. The learned counsel then submitted that during the administration in the Union Territory of
Manipur, the Chief Commissioner, Manipur bifurcated the territory of Manipur into Districts and
Administrative Units on 12.11.1969. As such, the village of Purum Khullen was included as Serial
No.40 of the Sadar Hills Sub-Division, Manipur North District. He would submit that in the Court of
SDM/Sadar Hills, an order dated 18.6.1971 was passed in Misc. Case No.23 of 1971 recognizing the
settlement land area of Purum Khullen thereby demarcating the land and issued map in recognition
of the said land.

13. The leaned counsel next submitted that with the support of the State Government, the village
authorities have also undertaken different developmental projects in the village such as Government
Primary Schools, Anganwadi Centres, Water Supply Scheme, Plantation of Trees etc. In
continuation of the State's developmental project, the construction for Manipur International
University at Purum Khullen has been underway and, as such, on 17.9.2020, the villagers employed
workers for levelling of land. However, the officials alleged to be from DFO, Central Range,
Mantripukhri intervened and forcefully stopped the ongoing construction work saying that the said
land is situated within Sambei Purum Reserve Forest and not to continue any activity without their
permission.
14. The learned counsel further submitted that when the petitioner went to the Forest Office to
enquire about the matter, the Chief Conservator showed the impugned letter dated 13.11.2020
addressed to the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests & HoFF with regard to cancellation of the
order dated 18.6.1971 passed by the SDM/Sadar. Aggrieved by the said letter dated 13.11.2020, the
petitioner submitted a representation on 5.4.2021 to the DFO, Central Forest Division for
cancellation of the impugned letter. However, no action was taken till date.
15. The learned counsel urged that the villagers have been settled since the time of forefathers and
depended on the forest products for their daily livelihood and, as usual, on 12.6.2022, when some of
the villagers were cutting the firewood for their daily consumption, the officials from RO, Pangei
came over and stopped the villagers from such activity and, thereafter, also some officials entered
the village without any prior notice and stopped the villagers from taking up any activity accusing
the villagers stating that they are residing within Sambei Reserve Forest and threatened with dire
consequences.
16. The learned counsel for the petitioner contended that with respect to the creation of Sambei
Purum Reserved Forest, no letter specifying land area or land schedule was issued to the petitioner
or his forefathers with respect to declaring the land of the petitioner as Reserved Forest which is in
clear violation of Sections 4 and 6 of the Indian Forest Act, 1927. The act of the respondents has
caused apprehension to the villagers that they might be evicted anytime from the land they are
presently residing without due process of law. Hence, the petitioner has been advised to file the
present writ petition.
17. Raising a preliminary objection as to the maintainability of the writ petition, the learned
Advocate General submitted that Sembei Purum Reserved Forest came into existence in the year
1936 after a resolution of the Manipur State Darbar being Resolution No.4(A) dated 7.10.1936. The
said Darbar resolution clearly shows the boundary of Sembei Purum Reserved Forest and since
7.10.1936, Sambei Purum Hill Range has been a full-fledged Reserved Forest owned by the then
Princely State of Manipur under the British Rule. He would submit that after Manipur was merged
into the Union of India, the Reserved Forest has been legally protected under the Indian Forest Act,
1927 and no mention of the Purum Khullen village is made in the Darbar Resolution No.4(A) dated
7.10.1936.

18. The learned Advocate General further submitted that Purum Khullen village, barring few
households in the nearby hills, is situated at the foothills away from the boundary of Sambei Purum
Reserved Forest and the area currently occupied by the main Purum Khullen village is covered by
the cadastral survey map of 1960. In fact, the land of Purum Khullen village claimed by the
petitioner corresponds the Reserved Forest area covered by Compartment No.1 and 3 of the Sambei
Purum Reserved Forest.
19. The learned Advocate General urged that the attempt to construct the Manipur International
University within the Sambei Purum Reserved Forest near Purum Khullen is clear violation of
Section 26 of the Indian Forest Act, 1927, Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 and also
the decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court as well as this Court in PIL No.25 of 2017. Arguing so,
the learned Advocate General submitted that the writ petition is not maintainable and the same is
liable to be dismissed.
20. In reply, the learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the question of
non-maintainability of the writ petition as preliminary objection does not arise, in view of the fact
that on the strength of the impugned letter, the Conservator of Forest or its officials has no power to
stop the ongoing construction work alleging that the land in question is situated within the Sambei
Purum Reserve Forest. In fact, Purum Khullen does not fall within the Sambei Purum Reserve
Forest. Further, the villagers are not residing within the Purum Reserved Forest area alleged by the
respondents. In fact, the Purum Khullen village has its own boundaries as per the Darbar Resolution
No.4(A) dated 7.10.1936 and, as such, there is no violation of Section 26 of the Act.
21. This Court considered the rival submissions and also perused the materials available on record.
22. The grievance of the petitioner is that Purum Khullen village was established since the time of
their forefathers and the village was also recognized under the Manipur State Hill Peoples
(Administration) Regulation, 1947 and subsequently by the State Government. The village
constituted their own Village Authorities under the Manipur (Village Authorities in Hill Areas) Act,
1956 and the Purum Khullen village has its own distinct and independent boundaries and the title is
perfected. In fact, in the Court of SDM/Sadar Hills, an order dated 18.6.1971 was passed in Misc.
Case No.23 of 1971 recognizing the settlement land area of Purum Khullen demarcated under the
Land Schedule B and issued a map in recognition of the said land. Therefore, the forest officials have
no right to prevent the villagers from doing the developmental project at Purum Khullen.
23. The petitioner challenged the impugned letter dated 13.11.2020 stating that the Conservator of
Forest, Central Forest Circle, Government of Manipur has no authority to cancel the order dated
18.6.1971 and maps issued by the SDM. It would be appropriate to quote the impugned letter for
ready reference:
"I have to honor to forward herewith letter No.4/11/2020-21/DFO/CFD dt.
16.10.2020 of the DFO, Central Division on the above subject requesting for
cancellation of order dated 18.06.1971 and maps issued by the SDM/SDC, Sadar
Hills, Saikul allotting/demarcating land in Sambei Purum RF in favour of the Chief of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/85743930/ 6
Shri David Purum vs The State Of Manipur on 27 February, 2023
Purum Khullen village.
The Sambei Purum Reserved Forest was notified as a reserved forest vide Darbar
Resolution No.4(A) dated 07.10.1936 of the then President of Manipur State Darbar
and the said resolution was also published vide Notice No.23 dt. 25.03.1937 of the
Forest Member, Manipur State Darbar. Copy of the Darbar Resolution dt. 07.10.1937
and Notice dt. 25.03.1937 are also enclosed for ready reference. The SDM/SDC,
Saikul has no authority to issue such order and maps within the reserved forest land
and the same is in gross violation of the provision of Section 2 of the Forest
(Conservation) Act, 1980, Section 20 and 26 of the Indian Forest Act, 1927 and
Hon'ble Supreme Court Order dated 12.12.1996 in WP(C) 202 of 1995. The said order
is also null and void in view of the state Government's standing order
No.55/12/8-For dt. 31.05.1994.
It is, therefore, requested to cancel the order dated 18.06.1971 and maps issued by the
SDC/SDM as the same violates Act, Rules and Hon'ble Supreme Court order and also
to avoid legal complicacies."
24. The petitioner claims right over the land in question based on the order dated 18.6.1971 passed
in Misc. Case No.23/1971 by the SDM/Sadar Hills, Saikul. The respondents claim that the land
claimed by the petitioner relates to Reserved Forest area covered by Compartment No.1 and 3 of
Sambei Purum Reserved Forest and Sambei Purum Reserved Forest came into effect in the year
1936 after a resolution of the Manipur State Darbar being Resolution No.4(A) dated 07.10.1936.
25. Prima facie, there appears to be dispute qua right over the land in question between the parties.
As stated supra, the petitioner claims right over the land in question based on the order dated
18.6.1971 passed in Misc. Case No.23 of 1971. On the other hand, the respondents claim that the land
in question is a Reserved Forest. Nothing has been produced by the petitioner to establish that
Purum Khullen village is outside the boundary limits of Sambei Purum Reserved Forest. When the
petitioner claims that Purum Khullen village is not coming under the Reserved Forest, it is his
bounden duty to prove the same and the onus is heavily on the petitioner. Admittedly, there are no
documents to substantiate the case of the petitioner.
26. The learned counsel for the petitioner argued that the fact regarding existence of Purum Khullen
village within the existing boundary for over four centuries had been deliberately overlooked and
some regulations which were introduced in the 20th Centuries are being applied and they can in no
way apply the Purum Khullen village. Further submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner is
that Sambei is a settlement which came up a century ago i.e. about 300 years after Purum Khullen
was established and the so called Reserved Forest, namely Sambei Purum Forest after the
settlement. Since the village had existed much earlier, the name itself is derived from this village.
27. Though the petitioner contended that all the forests in the hill areas are unclassed forests owned
by village communities and held in the name of Chief or Khullakpa and that is the reason why MLR
Act could not apply to hill areas, nothing has been produced by the petitioner to prove the said
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/85743930/ 7
Shri David Purum vs The State Of Manipur on 27 February, 2023
contention.
28. The existence of order dated 18.6.1971 passed by the SDM/SDC, Sadar Hills has not been
disputed by the respondents. The learned Advocate General contended that when Sambei Purum
Reserved Forest was notified as a Reserved Forest vide Darbar Resolution No.4(A) on 7.10.1936 of
the then President of Manipur State Darbar and the said resolution was also published vide Notice
No.23 dated 25.3.1937, the SDM has no authority to issue the order dated 18.6.1971 within the
Reserved Forest area. This Court finds some force in the submission made by learned Advocate
General.
29. The provisions of the Indian Forest Act, 1927 clearly provides that de- reservation of any portion
or whole of a Reserved Forest shall be possible only through a decision of the State Government and
not by any other authority. Section 27 of the Act was valid upto 15.10.1980 and thereafter, the power
to de- reserve a portion or whole of a Reserved Forest shall lie with the Central Government under
Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. In view of the above, the SDM did not enjoy the
power to issue such order to give away portion of Sambei Purum Reserved Forest to Purum Khullen
village.
30. The petitioner claims that the villagers are the absolute land owners of the land in question, as it
has been inherited from their forefathers and has been settling upon the said land peacefully. The
respondents denied the claim made by the petitioner by stating that the land in question is Reserved
Forest land. Since disputed question of fact involved, exercising jurisdiction under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India, such disputed question cannot be decided in this writ petition.
31. On a reading of the averments set out in the writ petition, this Court finds that though the
petitioner is the Chief of Purum Khullen village, he has not filed the instant writ petition under
representative capacity. There is no whisper about the filing of the present writ petition for himself
and on behalf of the villagers of Purum Khullen.
32. The way in which the instant writ petition filed by the petitioner is not maintainable. Since the
villagers of Purum Khullen are tribals, their life has been interconnected with the land and forest.
That apart, tribal and their forest are inseparable and the social custom of tribals is guaranteed
under the Constitution of India in respect of their possession upon the land and forest in question.
When the aforesaid is the position, this Court in a writ petition cannot decide and declare the rights
of the villagers of Purum Khullen over the land in question in their favour. It is the appropriate
Government to decide taking note of the existing law and the ground situation. It is also the duty of
the Government to safeguard the tribals who are living in the Forest land or nearby the Forest land.
The Government ought to ensure right to life enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution of India
and also the peaceful co-existence of the poor villagers who are settling since time immemorial not
to be disturbed, as the villagers/tribals are history of the State.
33. For all the reasons stated above,
(a) The writ petition is not maintainable and, accordingly, the same is dismissed.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/85743930/ 8
Shri David Purum vs The State Of Manipur on 27 February, 2023
(b) However, liberty is given to the villagers of Purum Khullen to work out their remedy before the
competent authority/government for redressal of their grievance either for compensation or
alternative place.
(c) On receipt of any representation from the villagers, the respondents are directed to consider the
same sympathetically and pass appropriate speaking order.
(d) There will be no order as to costs.
