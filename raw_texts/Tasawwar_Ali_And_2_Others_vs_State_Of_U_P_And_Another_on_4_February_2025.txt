"16. On the basis of above analysis, this Court is also summarising the law regarding
effect of repealing the IPC and Cr.P.C. by BNS and BNSS respectively and same is
being mentioned as below:
(i) If an FIR is registered on or after 1.7.2024 for the offence committed prior to
1.7.2024, then FIR would be registered under the provisions of IPC but the
investigation will continue as per BNSS.
(ii) In the pending investigation on 01.07.2024 (on the date of commencement of
New Criminal Laws), investigation will continue as per the Cr.P.C. till the cognizance
is taken on the police report and if any direction is made for further investigation by
the competent Court then same will continue as per the Cr.P.C.
(iii) The cognizance on the pending investigation on or after 01.07.2024 would be
taken as per the BNSS and all the subsequent proceeding including enquiry, trial or
appeal would be conducted as per the procedure of BNSS.
(iv) Section 531(2)(a) of BNSS saved only pending investigation, trial, appeal,
application and enquiry, therefore, if any trial, appeal, revision or application is
commenced after 01.07.2024, the same will be proceeded as per the procedure of
BNSS.
(v) The pending trial on 01.07.2024, if concluded on or after 01.07.2024 then appeal
or revision against the judgement passed in such a trial will be as per the BNSS.
However, if any application is filed in appeal, which was pending on 01.07.2024 then
the procedure of Cr.P.C. will apply.
(vi) If the criminal proceeding or chargesheet is challenged before the High Court on
or after 01.07.2024, where the investigation was conducted as per Cr.P.C. then same
will be filed u/s 528 of BNSS not u/s 482 Cr.P.C."

implementation of New Criminal Law, High Court, Allahabad for seeking guidance for

S.No. Agenda Resolutions
1.
To outline the procedure to be followed with respect to the reporting of criminal cases i.e. appeals,
bails and applications u/s 482 Cr.P.C. etc. being instituted in the High Court after the enactment of
Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 in view of the order dated 06.08.2024 of the Hon'ble
Court.
The Committee perused the note dated 20.08.2024 of the Stamp Reporter (Criminal) section &
order dated 06.08.2024 of the Court passed in Criminal Misc. Writ Petition No. 12287/2024 titled
as Deepu and 4 others vs. State of U.P. and 3 others and discussed the matter at length.
In light of the discussions held, the Committee resolved as under :-
1. The Stamp Reporter (Criminal) section is directed to comply with the order dated
06.08.2024 passed in Criminal Misc. Writ Petition No. 12287/2024.
2. In case, while reporting, there is any deviance with the order dated
06.08.2024,then the case shall not be withheld but shall be placed before concerned
Court alongwith a note.
5. In pursuance of resolution dated 22.08.2024 of the Hon'ble Committee for implementation of
New Criminal Laws, Registrar (J)(Criminal) section directed to Stamp Reporter (Criminal) to
comply the resolution dated 22.08.2024 of the Hon'ble Committee. Thereafter from 01.09.2024, the
Stamp Reporter (Criminal) Section High Court, Allahabad started making a note in applications u/s
482 Cr.P.C. which were filed in deviation of the judgement dated 06.08.2024 passed in Deepu's case
(supra).
6. The Hon'ble Committee passed a resolution dated 22.08.2024 for not withholding the
applications u/s 482 Cr.P.C. considering the huge backlog of cases presented before the Stamp
Reporter (Criminal) for reporting. But that does not mean that Committee has permitted to file
application u/s 482 Cr.P.C. in deviation of judgement passed in Deepu's case (supra), even after its
resolution dated 22.08.2024 which was communicated to Stamp Reporter (Criminal) on
29.08.2024. Even then the applications u/s 482 Cr.P.C. have been continuously filed, even in the
year 2025 taking advantage of the resolution dated 22.08.2024 of the Hon'ble Committee which has
resulted the placing of application u/s 528 of BNSS below the application filed u/s 482 Cr.P.C.,
despite being filed earlier in time.
7. Therefore, Stamp Reporter (Criminal) Section is directed not to clear any application filed u/s 482
Cr.P.C. w.e.f. 10.02.2025 and in case any application is filed u/s 482 Cr.P.C. which is in deviation of
the order dated 06.08.2024 passed in Deepu's case (supra), defect of non-maintainability be
reported.

implementation of New Criminal Law, therefore, present application u/s 482 Cr.P.C. challenging the
impugned proceeding is not maintainable. Accordingly, the same is dismissed with liberty to the

for the applicants, after retaining the photocopy of the same.
