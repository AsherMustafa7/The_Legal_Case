Sushil Kumar Jain And Another vs State Of U.P. And Another on 1 May, 2025
Opposite Party :- State of U.P. and Another
Counsel for Applicant :- Kabeer Tiwari
Counsel for Opposite Party :- G.A.,Manvendra Nath Singh
Hon'ble Vikas Budhwar,J.
1. Heard Sri Kabeer Tiwari, learned counsel for the applicants in the leading connected C1 and
connected C2 applications, Sri S.K. Singh, learned AGA for the State and Sri Manvendra Nath Singh,
learned counsel for the opposite party no.2 in all the three applications.
2. A joint statement has been made by the learned counsel for the parties in all the applications that
they do not propose to file any affidavit and the application be decided on the basis of the
documents available on record. With the consent of the parties, the application is being decided at
the fresh stage.
3. The case of the applicants in the leading application is that on 05.08.2023, the opposite party
no.2 lodged a complaint against the applicants under Section 138 of the NI Act relatable to
dishonouring of three cheques of an amount of Rs.2,34,000/- each. A statutory demand notice is
stated to have been issued by the opposite party no.2 to the applicants and thereafter, the complaint
was lodged on 05.08.2023. On 26.02.2024, the trial court summoned the applicants under Section
138 of the NI Act. The applicants, thereafter, approached the court below for bail. Aggrieved against
the summoning order, the applicants approached this Court while filing application u/s482
No.13942 of 2024 (Sushil Kumar Jain vs. State of U.P.) which came to be disposed of on 21.05.2024
granting liberty to the applicants to surrender and move an application for bail. Thereafter, the
applicants were enlarged on bail with certain conditions which was subject matter of challenge at
the instance of the applicants in application u/s482 No.22773 of 2024, which came to be disposed of
on 11.09.2024, wherein also the order dated 20.06.2024 passed under Section 143-A of the N.I. Act
for grant of interim compensation at the instance of the opposite party no.2 was challenged. The
said application came to be disposed of on 11.09.2024 holding as under :
"9. The main submission is that Since the 143A N.I. application cannot be decided till
the accused pleaded 'not guilty' in accordance with the provisions of Section 251
Cr.P.C, therefore, even if the applicant has agreed and has given no objection to the
application under Section 143A of the N.I. Act, the same could not be decided.
However, it is apparent that from the order dated 20.06.2024 the trial court has not
decided the application under Section 143A of the N.I. Act, and no order has been
passed on application under Section 143A of the N.I. Act and the same is still pending
before the trial court. However, on his own undertaking the condition was imposed
by the trial court.

10. Therefore, since an objection has been raised that 'no objection' was given by the
counsel for the applicant without any authorization, therefore, the order dated
20.06.2024, passed in the Complaint Case No. 7311 of 2023 (Krishna Pratap Singh
vs. Sushil Kumar Jain and Other) is hereby set-aside and the bail granted to the
applicant is hereby cancelled and the applicant is directed to surrender before the
trial court within one week and apply for bail in accordance with law. The trial court
shall proceed in the matter as if the non-bailable warrants are still continuing against
the applicant and it is further submitted that the now stage of 251 Cr.P.C. is already
over, therefore, the trial court after deciding the bail applications shall also decide the
application under Section 143A of the N.I. Act., of the complainant in accordance
with law.
11. With the aforesaid observations the instant application is disposed of. "
4. As per the records, another application came to be preferred by the complainant under Section
143-A of the N.I. Act for grant of interim compensation which came to be objected by the applicants
on 21.10.2024. The said application has been allowed by the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate,
Lalitpur in Complaint Case No.7311 of 2023 (Krishna Pratap Singh vs. Sushil Kumar Jain) on
17.12.2024.
5. As regards, the connected application is concerned, the same is also between the same parties as
in the case of the leading application. However, here, the complaint is with regard to dishonour of a
cheque of an amount of Rs.1 lac post issuance of the statutory notice the complaints would filed
thereafter, the applicants herein approached this Court questioning the summoning order dated
26.02.2024 followed by filing of an application under Section 482 No.13939 of 2024 (Sushil Kumar
Jain and others vs. State of UP) questioning the summoning order, wherein the applicants were
directed to surrender and an order came to be passed on 20.06.2024 in Case No.12253 of 2023
under Section 143-A on an application for grant of interim compensation by the opposite party no.2,
whereby interim compensation to the tune of 20 per cent was accorded and the applicants were
enlarged on bail with certain conditions which led to filing of an application under Section 482
No.23438 of 2024, which came to be disposed of by this Court on 11.09.2024 with the same
observations as was in the case in the leading application. Thereafter, the opposite party no.2 came
to have preferred the application u/s143-A which was objected by the applicants on 21.10.2024 and
the said application culminated into an order dated 17.12.2024 passed in Complaint Case No.12253
of 2023, whereby interim compensation to the tune of 20 per cent have been granted to the opposite
party no.2.
6. With respect to the connected C2 application, the same is between the same parties, which are
slight distinction that total amount of Rs.25 lacs bifurcated into five amounting to five lacs each is
alleged to have been dishonoured followed by issuance of a statutory demand notice and the
complaint under Section 138, summoning of the applicants on 26.02.2024 filing of an application
under Section 482 No.13939 of 2024 decision whereof granting liberty to the applicants to obtain
bail. Filing of an application under Section 143-A by the opposite party no.2, allowing of the same on

Sushil Kumar Jain And Another vs State Of U.P. And Another on 1 May, 2025
application under Section 482 No.22760 of 2024, decision whereof dated 11.09.2024 on the same
lines as in the leading and the connected C1 application filing of another application under Section
143-A of the NI Act, objection preferred by the applicants to the same on 21.10.2024 followed by
order dated 17.12.2024 in Complaint Case No.6930 of 2023 (Krishna Pratap Singh vs. Sushil Kumar
Jain) passed by Chief Judicial Magistrate, Lalitpur according interim compensation to the tune of
20 per cent under Section 143-A.
7. Questioning the order dated 17.12.2024, granting interim compensation under Section 143-A of
the N.I. Act, the leading, connected C1 and connected C2 applications have been preferred by the
applicants.
8. Learned counsel has submitted that the order dated 17.12.2024 passed by the court below
allowing the applications under Section 143-A cannot be sustained even for a single moment.
Elaborating the said submissions, it is submitted that the issue with regard to the manner under
which the applications under Section 143-A of the NI Act is to be decided is no more res integra as
the Hon'ble Apex Court in Rakesh Ranjan Srivastava vs. State of Jharkhand and others (2024) 4
SCC 419 had laid down certain broad parameters which were to be in all eventualities taken into
consideration while taking the decision for according interim compensation or not. He submits that
in the present case, the order impugned cannot be sustained for more than one reason. Firstly, the
court below has taken note of and placed reliance and based its consideration upon Section 139 of
the NI Act which could not have been done as the question of presumption is not to be a one of the
criteria for grant or non-grant of interim compensation. Secondly, the financial distress of the
applicant has not been taken into consideration which was specifically pleaded in the objection and
the same required adjudication at least on a prima facie basis whether it is tenable or not but only
the financial condition of the complainant has been seen. Thirdly, though the court below once
comes to the conclusion that interim compensation is to be accorded then to the court is not
expected to shrink its responsibility on the question of quantum as that is a factor which ought to
have been considered which has been conveniently overlooked. He thus submits that the orders
dated 17.12.2024 be set aside and the matter be remitted back to the court below to pass a fresh
order.
9. Sri Manvendra Nath Singh, while countering the submission of the learned counsel for the
applicants has submitted that this is virtually the second time adjudication is being sought to be
made in the proceedings under section 143 A of the NI Act. He further submits that the excuse so
sought to be taken by the applicants about their financial distress is a lame excuse, which is
commonly available as there is nothing on record to show that the case of the applicants comes
under the exception and rightly the court below has not considered the same. He further submits
that reference to Section 139 of the NI Act was though made in the order but the same was not made
the basis for awarding the compensation and lastly he submits that the statute itself provides for
20% minimum compensation and the court below had accorded 20% minimum compensation.
Thus, the order cannot be said to be bad.
10. Sri S.K. Singh, learned AGA has supported the orders and adopted the arguments of the counsel
for the opposite party no.2.

Sushil Kumar Jain And Another vs State Of U.P. And Another on 1 May, 2025
11. I have heard the submissions so made across the bar and perused the record carefully.
12. Apparently, the Court at the instance of the applicants is confronted with an orders dated
17.12.2024, whereby the application under Section 143A of the NI Act preferred by the complainant
has been allowed. It is noteworthy to mention that the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Rakesh
Ranjan Srivastava had laid down certain broad parameters which needs to be noticed. The following
was observed:
27. Subject to what is held earlier, the main conclusions can be summarised as
follows:
27.1. The exercise of power under sub-section (1) of Section 143A is discretionary.
The provision is directory and not mandatory. The word ?may? used in the provision
cannot be construed as ?shall.?
27.2. While deciding the prayer made under Section 143A, the Court must record
brief reasons indicating consideration of all relevant factors.
27.3. The broad parameters for exercising the discretion under Section 143A are as
follows:
27.3.1. The Court will have to prima facie evaluate the merits of the case made out by
the complainant and the merits of the defence pleaded by the accused in the reply to
the application. The financial distress of the accused can also be a consideration.
27.3.2. A direction to pay interim compensation can be issued, only if the
complainant makes out a prima facie case.
27.3.3. If the defence of the accused is found to be prima facie plausible, the Court
may exercise discretion in refusing to grant interim compensation.
27.3.4. If the Court concludes that a case is made out to grant interim compensation,
it will also have to apply its mind to the quantum of interim compensation to be
granted.Crl. Appeal No. 741 of 2024 Page 18 of 18 consider several factors such as the
nature of the transaction, the relationship, if any, between the accused and the
complainant, etc. 27.3.5. There could be several other relevant factors in the peculiar
facts of a given case, which cannot beexhaustively stated. The parameters stated
above are not exhaustive.
13. Applying the principles of law as culled out in the abovenoted decision in the facts of the case, it
is more than evident that though the Court has discussed the financial distress of the complainant
but there is no word about the financial distress of the applicants/accused. It may be that the ground
taken by the applicants/accused showing their financial distress may be flimsy or frivolous but the
court below was required to accord satisfaction and reason in that regard, which is not appearing in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77396077/ 5
Sushil Kumar Jain And Another vs State Of U.P. And Another on 1 May, 2025
the order impugned. Likewise, a consideration ought to have been made upon the issue of the
quantum of compensation if prima facie the court below was of the view that the compensation was
to be accorded but the court finds that the said consideration is lacking. Moreover, as a matter of
fact, as held by the Hon'ble Apex Court in Rakesh Ranjan Srivastava (supra), the applicability of
Section 139 would have no role to play in the proceedings under Section 143A of the NI Act, thus,
the same is not to be taken as a factor either to deny or to grant interim compensation. On a pointed
query being raised to Sri Manvendra Singh, who appears for opposite party no.2 in all the
applications, submits that since there appears to be certain infirmities in the order, the order dated
17.12.2024 is set aside the matters be remitted back to the court below to pass a fresh order.
14. Accordingly, keeping in view the mandate in case of Rakesh Ranjan Srivastava (supra) viz-a-viz,
the orders subject matter of challenge herein, the orders dated 17.12.2024 passed in Complaint Case
No.7311 of 2023, 12253 of 2023 and 6390 of 2023 of court below are set aside.
15. Matter is remitted back to the court below to pass fresh orders strictly in accordance with law.
16. For the expeditious disposal of the proceedings under Section 143-A, the parties shall furnish the
certified copies of the orders passed today by 09.05.2025, the court below shall decide the same with
most expedition.
17. Learned counsel for the applicants and the counsel for the opposite party no.2 submits that their
clients being the applicants and opposite party no.2 shall not take any adjournment and that they
shall extend their full cooperation for disposal of the application under Section 143A of the NI Act.
18. With the said observation, the application stands disposed of.
