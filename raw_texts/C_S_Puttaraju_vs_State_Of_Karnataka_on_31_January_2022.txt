9. On 01.11.2013, Mandya West Police Station registered the F.I.R. for the offences punishable under
Sections 406, 409 and 420 read with Section 34 of IPC in Crime No.370/2013. On 09.01.2014, the
State Government has issued an order transferring the above case to C.B.I. for investigation and the
State Government has ordered for entrustment of investigation to the C.B.I. The C.B.I. re-registered
the FIR in RC No.21(A)/2014 as against Mr.Upendra Naik and others for the offences punishable
under Sections 406, 409 and 420 read with Section 120-B of I.P.C. and Section 13(2) read with
Section 13(1) (c) &
(d) of P.C. Act. The charge sheet came to be filed before the Court of XLVI Additional City Civil &
Sessions Judge and Spl. Judge for CBI Cases at Bengaluru on 03.02.2016.
10. It is further made out from the facts that on 28.09.2016 in Crl.P.No.6993/2016 as regards
Accused No.8, stay of proceedings before the trial Court was granted. Pursuant to which, there was
deferment of proceedings before the trial Court awaiting the orders from the High Court and
eventually the proceedings against Accused No.8 was quashed by order dated 19.01.2017.
11. On 25.04.2017, this Court stayed the proceedings in Crl.P.No.3578/2017 in respect of Accused
No.2.
12. The setting aside of proceedings as against Accused No.8 was assailed before the Apex Court in
S.L.P. (Crl.) No.6971/2017, which set aside the judgment of the High Court quashing the
proceedings as against Accused No.8, while observing that the question raised by Accused No.8 is a
matter for trial.
13. On 25.11.2020, this Court vacated the interim order granted in Crl.P.No.3578/2017 instituted by
Accused No.2. Finally on 29.03.2021, the learned Spl. Judge took cognizance of the offences
punishable under Sections 120-B, 409, and 420 of IPC and Section 13(1)(c) & (d) read with Section
13(2) of the P.C. Act and the case was registered in Spl.CC.No.577/2021 and an order was passed for
issuance of summons to the accused after which the present petition has been filed.
Submissions of the petitioner:-
14. The MUDA, which was stated to be facing financial crunch, in its meeting on 08.09.2009
resolved to allot 107 sites which remained unallotted to interested persons by collecting Guidance
Value and the petitioner was allotted Site No.562.
15. Though there was no stay as regards the petitioner, cognizance of offence was not taken as
regards the petitioner till 29.03.2021, as on which date the sanction for prosecution was required in
terms of Section 19(1)(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act as amended by Act 16 of 2018 (the Act
as amended prescribed sanction as being necessary where the accused was at the time of
commission of the alleged offence employed).
16. In light of petitioner being appointed as Member of MUDA in terms of Section 3(3)(d) and
Section 4 of the Karnataka Urban Development Authorities Act, 1987 and as the State Government
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154562475/ 4
C S Puttaraju vs State Of Karnataka on 31 January, 2022
was empowered to remove them, sanction ought to have been obtained in terms of Section 19(1)(c)
from the State Government.
17. It is contended that sanction of prosecution ought to have preceded taking of cognizance, that
amendment to the Prevention of Corruption Act was by way of substitution and accordingly, it
would have retrospective effect and is deemed to have been part of the Act since its inception and
accordingly, the sanction was required.
18. The finding of trial Court that Accused No.5, who was an elected Member of Legislative
Assembly not being appointed could not be removed even by the Speaker and accordingly no
sanction was necessary, was a finding contrary to law and was required to be set aside.
19. As the C.B.I. itself had made efforts to obtain sanction from the Speaker instead of Government,
which if taken note of, the taking of cognizance without sanction was illegal.
Contentions of the respondents:-
20. The Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act, 2018 created new offences punishable under
Sections 7 to 13 and the procedure for obtaining sanction was made necessary even as regards the
retired public servants. Such amendment could not be given effect to retrospectively.
21. Section 6(e) of the General Clauses Act, 1897 saves pending investigation or legal proceedings
which are to be proceeded with as if the Amendment Act 2018 has not been passed.
22. Mere use of the word 'substitution' would not result in amendment being effective with
retrospective effect. The Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act, 2018 coming into force by way
of Gazette Notification on 26.07.2018 would by itself indicate that the Amendment Act was to be
effective prospectively. The amendment related to substantive provisions of the Act and accordingly
are to be treated as prospective in application.
23. The offence was committed in the year 2009 and investigation was completed and charge sheet
was filed in 2016 and accordingly, the question of applying the Amendment Act, 2018 which casts an
additional burden on the C.B.I. to obtain sanction for prosecution could not be made applicable.
Reliance is placed on the judgment of Kerala High Court in the case of K.R.Ramesh v. Central
Bureau of Investigation and Another1.
24. As per the un-amended provisions of Section 19 of P.C. Act, the sanction was not required in
case of prosecution of public servants after retirement, as held by Apex Court in the case of Station
House Officer, CBI/ACB/Bangalore v. B.A.Srinivasan and Another2.
25. The investigation being completed as on 31.12.2015 and the charge sheet being placed before the
trial Court on 03.02.2016 for the purpose of taking cognizance, the non-taking of cognizance
thereafter was beyond the control of respondent and accordingly, the additional burden by way of
Amendment Act, 2018 cannot be imposed.

26. The delay caused by the Court in taking cognizance ought not to deny justice to a diligent 2020
SCC Online Ker 2529.
(2020) 2 SCC 153 complainant and reliance is placed on the judgment of Apex Court in the case of
Sarah Mathew v. Institute of Cardio Vascular Diseases by its Director K.M.Cherian and Others .
27. Sanction under Section 197 of Cr.P.C. as regards offences as per the I.P.C. is not required insofar
as the offences relating to criminal breach of trust cannot be construed to be an act done in
discharge of official duties of the petitioner. Accordingly, dismissal of the petition is sought for.
CONSIDERATION:-
I. Sanction under Section 197 of Cr.P.C.
28. While the validity of the proceedings is challenged on the ground of absence of sanction, the
sanction as required under Section 197 of Cr.P.C. for proceedings relating to I.P.C. offences, is
required to be considered as a distinct issue.
(2014) 2 SCC 62 The petitioner-Accused No.5 was a Member of Legislative Assembly from 2008 to
2013 and came to be appointed as Member of "Mysuru Urban Development Authority", which
membership is co-terminus with his tenure as a Member of Legislative Assembly.
29. The case has been registered as regards tenure of the petitioner when he was a Member of
MUDA. It is alleged that he had got allotted a stray site to himself though he was ineligible, as his
wife was already an allottee of a site from the same Authority.
30. It has been alleged that, in the application the petitioner had declared that neither he nor his
family had been allotted any site by any Urban Development Authority, which was a false
declaration.
31. After investigation, the imputation made in the charge sheet by the Central Bureau of
Investigation is as follows:-
"52. Shri.C.S.Puttaraju (A-5), S/o Late Sannathamme Gowda is a resident of
Chinakuruli Village, Pandavapura Taluk, Mandya District. He was the MLA of the
assembly Constituency of Melukote for the period from 2009 to 2014 representing
the political party Janatha Dal (Secular) and was the Member, MUDA, Mandya
during the said tenure. Shri.C.S.Puttaraju (A-5) conspired with A-1 and other
members of MUDA and allotted with MUDA site through the MUDA meeting held on
08.09.2009 knowing very well that, stray sites are to be auctioned and that he is not
eligible to get the site allotted to himself. He has concealed his marital status in the
MUDA application form submitted for site allotment. He also concealed the details of
MUDA site already allotted in the name of his wife with an intention to get allot the
MUDA site in his name."

C S Puttaraju vs State Of Karnataka on 31 January, 2022
32. Under Section 197 of Cr.P.C., sanction is required where the accused who is not removable from
the office save with the sanction of Government "is accused of any offence alleged to have been
committed by him while acting or purporting to act in discharge of his official duty." Section 197
provides that cognizance shall not be taken except with the previous sanction.
33. The Court while insisting for sanction before taking cognizance is required to arrive at a finding
that the alleged acts constituting the offence is to be treated to be an act in discharge of his official
duty. This would be a sine qua non for insistence of sanction. The observations of Apex Court in the
case of Rajib Ranjan and Others v. R.Vijaykumar4 at paragraph Nos.15 to 18 which are of relevance
are extracted below:-
"15. The sanction, however, is necessary if the offence alleged against the public
servant is committed by him "while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his
official duties". In order to find out as to whether the alleged offence is committed
while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty, the following
yardstick is provided by this Court in Budhikota Subbarao [State of Maharashtra v.
Budhikota Subbarao, (1993) 3 SCC 339 : 1993 SCC (Cri) 901 : (1993) 2 SCR 311] in
the following words: (SCC p. 347, para 6).
6. ... If on facts, therefore, it is prima facie found that the act or omission for which
the accused was charged had reasonable connection with discharge of his duty then it
must be held (2015) 1 SCC 513 to be official to which applicability of Section 197 of
the Code cannot be disputed."
16. This principle was explained in some more detail in Raghunath Anant Govilkar v. State of
Maharashtra [(2008) 11 SCC 289 : (2009) 1 SCC (Cri) 130] , which was decided by this Court on
8-2-2008 in SLP (Crl.) No. 5453 of 2007, in the following manner: (SCC pp. 298-99, para 11) "11.7.
... "66. ... On the question of the applicability of Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the
principle laid down in two cases, namely, Shreekantiah Ramayya Munipalli v. State of Bombay [AIR
1955 SC 287 : 1955 Cri LJ 857] and Amrik Singh v. State of Pepsu [AIR 1955 SC 309 : 1955 Cri LJ
865] was as follows: (Amrik Singh case [AIR 1955 SC 309 : 1955 Cri LJ 865] , AIR p. 312, para
8) '8. ... It is not every offence committed by a public servant that requires sanction for prosecution
under Section 197(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code; nor even every act done by him while he is
actually engaged in the performance of his official duties; but if the act complained of is directly
concerned with his official duties so that, if questioned, it could be claimed to have been done by
virtue of the office, then sanction would be necessary....' The real question therefore, is whether the
acts complained of in the present case were directly concerned with the official duties of the three
public servants. As far as the offence of criminal conspiracy punishable under Section 120-B read
with Section 409 of the Penal Code is concerned and also Section 5(2) of the Prevention of
Corruption Act, are concerned they cannot be said to be of the nature mentioned in Section 197 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure. To put it shortly, it is no part of the duty of a public servant, while
discharging his official duties, to enter into a criminal conspiracy or to indulge in criminal
misconduct. Want of sanction under Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is, therefore, no

bar." [Ed.: As observed in Harihar Prasad v. State of Bihar, (1972) 3 SCC 89, 115, para 66 : 1972 SCC
(Cri) 409.] ' [Ed.:
Quoted from State of Kerala v. V. Padmanabhan Nair, (1999) 5 SCC 690, 692, para 7 : 1999 SCC
(Cri) 1031.] "
17. Likewise, in Shambhoo Nath Misra v. State of U.P. [(1997) 5 SCC 326 : 1997 SCC
(Cri) 676 :
AIR 1997 SC 2102], the Court dealt with the subject in the following manner: (SCC p.
328, para 5) "5. The question is when the public servant is alleged to have committed
the offence of fabrication of record or misappropriation of public fund, etc. can he be
said to have acted in discharge of his official duties? It is not the official duty of the
public servant to fabricate the false record and misappropriate the public funds, etc.
in furtherance of or in the discharge of his official duties. The official capacity only
enables him to fabricate the record or misappropriate the public fund, etc. It does not
mean that it is integrally connected or inseparably interlinked with the crime
committed in the course of same transaction, as was believed by the learned Judge.
Under these circumstances, we are of the opinion that the view expressed by the High
Court as well as by the trial court on the question of sanction is clearly illegal and
cannot be sustained."
18. The ratio of the aforesaid cases, which is clearly discernible, is that even while discharging his
official duties, if a public servant enters into a criminal conspiracy or indulges in criminal
misconduct, such misdemeanour on his part is not to be treated as an act in discharge of his official
duties and, therefore, provisions of Section 197 of the Code will not be attracted. In fact, the High
Court has dismissed the petitions filed by the appellant precisely with these observations, namely,
the allegations pertain to fabricating the false records which cannot be treated as part of the
appellants' normal official duties. The High Court has, thus, correctly spelt out the proposition of
law. The only question is as to whether on the facts of the present case, the same has been correctly
applied."
34. Keeping in mind the above legal framework whether the acts constituting the offence has been
committed "by him while acting or purporting to act in discharge of his official duty..." would
require evaluation of the material and evidence produced in support of the charge sheet. Depending
on such conclusion, the question of requirement of sanction is to be decided. Such exercise involving
appreciation of quality of evidence is a matter best left to the trial Court at the appropriate stage in
the trial. The trial Court when deciding such question would keep in mind the legal framework as
detailed above while recording a finding on the factual matrix.
35. Accordingly, the contention relating to the aspect of sanction under Section 197 of Cr.P.C. as
raised by the petitioner is rejected.
II. Sanction for Prosecution under Section 19 of the Prevention of Corruption Act:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154562475/ 8
C S Puttaraju vs State Of Karnataka on 31 January, 2022
36. The petitioner was appointed as the Member of MUDA by virtue of being a Member of the
Legislative Assembly in terms of Section 3(3)(d) and Section 4 of the Karnataka Urban Development
Authorities Act, 1987. It is also undisputed that the petitioner was a Member of Legislative Assembly
for the term 2008-2013 and during such term was appointed as Member of the Authority. The facts
as are made out would reveal that offence is alleged to have been committed by the petitioner during
his tenure as the Member of MUDA when he was a Member of the Legislative Assembly from
2008-2013.
37. The FIR has been lodged by the Mandya West Police Station in 2013 and by the C.B.I. in 2014.
The charge sheet has been filed before the Spl. Judge on 03.02.2016 and cognizance thereafter was
required to be taken.
38. Section 19 of the Prevention of Corruption Act prior to the amendment in 2018 required
previous sanction for the purpose of taking cognizance where the person "is employed". It is only by
virtue of amendment in 2018 that Section 19 has been amended which provides for sanction where
offence is committed by a person "who is employed, or as the case may be, was at the time of
commission of the alleged offence employed". Further, the Explanation to Section 19(1) inserted by
way of amendment stipulates that the term 'public servant' in sub-section (1) of Section 19 would
include a person who has ceased to hold the office during which the alleged offence is stated to have
been committed or is holding an office other than the office during which the offence is alleged to
have been committed. Accordingly, in terms of the provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act, till
the amendment was effected as per Act 16 of 2018, sanction was required only if the person
concerned was 'in employment' at the time when cognizance is taken.
39. Another aspect that has received judicial attention is that the person accused must be holding
that very office during the tenure of which the alleged offence has been committed as per the
provisions of the Act, prior to the amendment in 2018. The Apex Court in the case of Abhay Singh
Chautala v. CBI5 has clarified the position as follows:-
"54. The learned Senior Counsel tried to support their argument on the basis of the
theory of "legal fiction". We do not see as to how the theory of "legal fiction" can work
in this case. It may be that the appellants in this case held more than one offices
during the check period which they are alleged to have abused; however, there will be
no question of any doubt if on the date when the cognizance is taken, they are not
continuing to hold that very office. The relevant time, as held in S.A. Venkataraman v.
State [AIR 1958 SC 107 : 1958 Cri LJ 254] , is the date on which the cognizance is
taken. If on that date, the appellant is not a public servant, there will be no question
of any sanction. If (2011) 7 SCC 141 he continues to be a public servant but in a
different capacity or holding a different office than the one which is alleged to have
been abused, still there will be no question of sanction and in that case, there will also
be no question of any doubt arising because the doubt can arise only when the
sanction is necessary. In case of the present appellants, there was no question of
there being any doubt because basically there was no question of the appellants'
getting any protection by a sanction."

C S Puttaraju vs State Of Karnataka on 31 January, 2022
The facts of the said case were that the MLAs were charged under the P.C. Act as regards wrong
committed during their earlier tenure as elected representatives. As the charges did not pertain to
their current tenure as MLAs and as the charge sheet did not contain any allegation that the accused
had abused the current office as MLA, it was held that sanction was not necessary.
40. Accordingly, as long as the person concerned is not holding "that very office", which is "alleged
to have been abused as on the date of taking cognizance", the question of requirement of sanction
for the purpose of Section 19 (prior to the amendment in 2018) of the P.C. Act does not arise.
41. In the present case, though the petitioner at present is a Member of Legislative Assembly for the
term commencing from 2018, as the alleged offence relates to the period of his office as Member of
the Authority by virtue of his being a Member of Legislative Assembly from the year 2008 to 2013
with respect to such tenure, the question of sanction for prosecution for the charge sheet filed in the
year 2016 would not be required in terms of the Act, as it stood prior to 2018 Amendment.
Cognizance sought to be taken post 2018 Amendment with respect to charge sheet filed on
03.02.2016:-
42. It must be noted that the charge sheet dated 31.12.2015 admittedly came to be filed before the
Spl. Judge on 03.02.2016. If orders were passed for taking cognizance at any time before
26.07.2018, which is the date from which Act 16 of 2018 was brought into effect, the question of
applicability of amended provision would not have been an issue at all. As cognizance came to be
taken by order of the Special Judge only on 29.03.2021, taking note of the charge sheet dated
31.12.2015 filed on 03.02.2016, the question as regards to the applicability of amended provision of
Section 19 of the P.C. Act has arisen.
43. It is to be noticed that, with the filing of charge sheet on 03.02.2016 before the Special Judge,
the Investigating Agencies have completed their investigation and nothing more remained to be
done from their end as regards investigation.
44. The intervening circumstances between 03.02.2016 and 29.03.2021 which may have constituted
a legal impediment upon the Special Judge to pass an order taking cognizance are not within the
control of the Investigation Agency.
45. In the facts of the present case, it cannot be stated that during the aforesaid period till the
Amendment Act 16 of 2018 dated 26.07.2018 which provided for obtaining sanction, there was no
occasion for taking cognizance.
46. The order of stay of proceedings as regards Accused No.8 was only made on 28.09.2016 in
Crl.P.No.6993/2016. The order reads as follows:-
"stay of further proceedings in so far as the petitioner is concerned."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154562475/ 10
C S Puttaraju vs State Of Karnataka on 31 January, 2022
Though the petition came to be allowed quashing the proceedings as against Accused No.8 by order
dated 19.01.2017, there was legally no impediment to have proceeded against the other accused.
47. Crl.P.No.3578/2017 was filed by Accused No.2 and an order of stay came to be granted only on
25.04.2017. The sanction orders were produced before the Special Judge as regards Accused Nos.2,
3, 8 and 15. The Prosecutor had also filed an application with sanction orders of Accused No.9 and
10 and stated that the Speaker had rejected sanction as regards Accused Nos.4 to 6.
48. The Special Judge has observed in the order dated 01.07.2017 as follows:-
"P.P. submitted that as per the charge sheet, sanction order is required only to
prosecute against accused No.7 K.M.Nagaraj, accused no.8 Muralidhar, accused no.9
S.Satish, accused no.10 Venkataiah, accused no.14 Kalegowda and accused no.15,
A.G.Mahalingegowda and the same have been produced before this Court and
sanction order to prosecute accused no.4 to 6 is not necessary and prays to take
cognizance of the offence against the accused persons.
It is made from the order sheet dated 21-10-2016 that the proceedings stayed in
Crl.Petition no.6993/2016 dt.28-09-2016. Subsequently on 19-01-2017 the Hon'ble
High Court of Karnataka allowed the said petition and quashed the FIR and charge
sheet filed against accused no.8.
Further the matter is stayed in Crl.P.No.3578/2017 by Hon'ble High Court of
Karnataka dated 25.04.2017.
Hence, await orders by 11.12.2017."
The order dated 11.12.2017 by the Special Judge reads as follows:
"The Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka has stayed the matter in Crl.P.No.3578/2017
against accused no.2.
Await orders by 05.03.2018."
Accordingly, it is clear from the above orders that sanction orders as against some of the accused
had been produced and it was the stand of the prosecution that as regards some of the other accused
sanction was not required. By then, the proceedings stood quashed as against accused no.8 in
Crl.P.No.6993/2016 and there was an order of stay as regards accused no.2 in Crl.P.No.3578/2017.
Thus, as on 11.12.2017 the Special Judge was in a position to pass orders on taking of cognizance as
regards the petitioner and there was no legal impediment to do so.
49. It would be appropriate to take note of the observations of Apex Court in the case of Sarah
Mathew (supra) at paras-37 and 39, which read as follows:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154562475/ 11
C S Puttaraju vs State Of Karnataka on 31 January, 2022
"37. We are inclined to take this view also because there has to be some amount of
certainty or definiteness in matters of limitation relating to criminal offences. If, as
stated by this Court, taking cognizance is application of mind by the Magistrate to the
suspected offence, the subjective element comes in. Whether a Magistrate has taken
cognizance or not will depend on facts and circumstances of each case. A diligent
complainant or the prosecuting agency which promptly files the complaint or
initiates prosecution would be severely prejudiced if it is held that the relevant point
for computing limitation would be the date on which the Magistrate takes
cognizance. The complainant or the prosecuting agency would be entirely left at the
mercy of the Magistrate, who may take cognizance after the limitation period because
of several reasons; systemic or otherwise. It cannot be the intention of the legislature
to throw a diligent complainant out of the court in this manner. Besides, it must be
noted that the complainant approaches the court for redressal of his grievance. He
wants action to be taken against the perpetrators of crime. The courts functioning
under the criminal justice system are created for this purpose. It would be
unreasonable to take a view that delay caused by the court in taking cognizance of a
case would deny justice to a diligent complainant.
39....The provision is, therefore, made for condonation of delay. Treating date of
filing of complaint or date of initiation of proceedings as the relevant date for
computing limitation under Section 468 of the Code is supported by the legal maxim
actus curiae neminem gravabit which means that the act of court shall prejudice no
man. It bears repetition to state that the court's inaction in taking cognizance i.e.
court's inaction in applying mind to the suspected offence should not be allowed to
cause prejudice to a diligent complainant. Chapter XXXVI thus presents the interplay
of these three legal maxims. The provisions of this Chapter, however, are not
interpreted solely on the basis of these maxims. They only serve as guiding
principles."
(emphasis supplied)
50. The above observations would also fortify adopting of an interpretation that the delay or
deferment of taking cognizance by the Special Judge when there was no legal impediment to do so
ought not to prejudice the investigation. Keeping in mind the principle that the 'act of the court shall
prejudice no man', it could be concluded that the final report filed prior to amendment in 2018 of
the Act ought to have been considered and is deemed to have been considered and cognizance taken
as per the law prevailing when the charge sheet was ripe for consideration.
51. The delay in passing the order and coming into force of amendment requiring sanction in the
interregnum ought not to saddle the prosecution with any further obligation of obtaining sanction.
52. Another aspect that needs to be considered is as to which law would be applicable while taking
cognizance, i.e. Act as amended by 2018 amendment or the pre-amended provisions.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154562475/ 12
C S Puttaraju vs State Of Karnataka on 31 January, 2022
53. It must be noted that the final report was filed as on 03.02.2016. The provisions of Prevention of
Corruption Act prior to amendment in 2018 specified that sanction was required to be taken only if
the person 'is employed'. Section 19 as it stood prior to the amendment reads as follows:
"19. Previous sanction necessary for prosecution.-
(1) No court shall take cognizance of an offence punishable under sections 7, 10, 11, 13
and 15 alleged to have been committed by a public servant, except with the previous
sanction save as otherwise provided in the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013.-
(a) in the case of a person who is employed in connection with the affairs of the
Union and is not removable from his office save by or with the sanction of the Central
Government, of that Government;
(b) in the case of a person who is employed in connection with the affairs of a State
and is not removable from his office save by or with the sanction of the State
Government, of that Government;
(c) in the case of any other person, of the authority competent to remove him from
his office.
54. The amendment by Act 16 of 2018, published in the Gazette on 26.07.2018 brought about a
change and sanction was required to be obtained before taking cognizance for the offences where
the person "is employed, or as the case may be, was at the time of commission of the alleged offence
employed." Accordingly, sanction was required to be taken not only where he is in employment but
also when he was employed at the time of commission of the offence. The amended provision of
Section 19 of the Prevention of Corruption Act is as follows:-
"19. Previous sanction necessary for prosecution.-
(1) No court shall take cognizance of an offence punishable under Sections 7, 11, 13
and 15 alleged to have been committed by a public servant, except with the previous
sanction save as otherwise provided in the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013.
(a) in the case of a person who is employed, or as the case may be, was at the time of
commission of the alleged offence employed in connection with the affairs of the
Union and is not removable from his office save by or with the sanction of the Central
Government, of that Government;
(b) in the case of a person who is employed, or as the case may be, was at the time of
commission of the alleged offence employed in connection with the affairs of a State
and is not removable from his office save by or with the sanction of the State
Government, of that Government;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154562475/ 13
C S Puttaraju vs State Of Karnataka on 31 January, 2022
(c) in the case of any other person, of the authority competent to remove him from
his office.
Explanation.- For the purposes of sub-
section (1), the expression "public servant"
includes such person -
(a) who has ceased to hold the office during which the offence is alleged to have been
committed; or
(b) who has ceased to hold the office during which the offence is alleged to have been
committed and is holding an office other than the office during which the offence is
alleged to have been committed."
55. By virtue of the Amendment Act, the amended provision substituted the earlier provision. No
doubt, the Amendment Act does not contain a saving clause and accordingly, recourse to Section 6
of the General Clauses Act, 1897 is to be made. The relevant extract of the provision of the General
Clauses Act is as follows:-
"6. Effect of Repeal - Where this Act, or any Central Act or Regulation made after the
commencement of this Act, repeals any enactment hitherto made or hereafter to be
made, then, unless a different intention appears, the repeal shall not -
(a) xxx
(b) affect the previous operation of
any enactment so repealed or anything duly done or suffered thereunder;
(c) xxx
(d) xxx
(e) affect any investigation, legal
proceeding or remedy in respect of any such right, privilege, obligation, liability,
penalty, forfeiture or punishment as aforesaid, and any such investigation, legal
proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or enforced, and any such
penalty, forfeiture or punishment may be imposed as if the repealing Act or
Regulation had not been passed."
56. In the present case, by virtue of Amendment Act 2018, there has been a substitution. The
principle laid down in Section 6(b) and (e) of the General Clauses Act extracted hereinabove may be
kept in mind as a guiding principle while construing the effect of substitution of a clause in an
enactment wherein change is sought to be brought in by virtue of the substituted provision.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154562475/ 14
C S Puttaraju vs State Of Karnataka on 31 January, 2022
57. Merely use of the word, 'substitution' to replace the old provision will not have the effect of
making the amendment effective with retrospective effect, in the sense, that the substituted
provision will have to be made applicable even as regards the acts already done as per the existing
law and accordingly, such acts are required to be reworked in terms of the substituted provision.
58. What would also be of relevance is the language employed in the Amendment Act of 2018 as
regards to coming into force of the amended provision.
"An Act further to amend the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.
Be it enacted by Parliament in the Sixty-ninth Year of the Republic of India as
follows:-
1. (1) This Act may be called the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act, 2018.
(2) It shall come into force on such date as the Central Government may, by notification in the
Official Gazette, appoint.
59. The Amendment Act 16 of 2018 provides that it would come into force on such date as the
Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette appoint. It is to be further noticed
that the Amendment Act has come into force on 26.07.2018 vide SO.3664 (E) dated 26.07.2018.
60. The observations of Division Bench of this Court in the case of Govardhan. M v. State of
Karnataka6 would offer some guidance to the interpretation to be resorted to. Para-29 of the said
judgment reads as follows:-
29. It is well-settled rule of construction that every statute or statutory rule is
prospective unless it is expressly or by necessary implication made to have
retrospective effect. The principle is also well-
settled that statutes should not be construed so as to (2013) 1 Kant.J.J.437 create new disabilities or
obligations or impose new duties in respect of transactions which were complete at the time the
Amending Act came into force. When the Legislature amends an existing provision in a statute by
way of substitution, the effect is the substituted provision stands repealed and the amended
provision is substituted in the place of earlier provision in the earlier Act, as if the substituted
provision is there in the earlier act from the inception. By express provision or by implication if it is
not made clear that it is prospective in nature the said amended provision comes into effect from the
date of the earlier Act. But it is not an invariable Rule. If such an interpretation is given, if it leads to
repugnancy, inconsistency or absurdity, then the said general rule is not followed. In certain
situations, the Court having regard to the purport and object sought to be achieved by the
Legislature may construe the word "substitution" as an "amendment" having a prospective effect. If
the amendment Act expressly states that the substituted provision shall come into force from the
date the amendment comes into force, the said provision is prospective in nature. Then it is not
open to the Court by way of interpretation to give retrospective effect to such provision. Ultimately
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154562475/ 15
C S Puttaraju vs State Of Karnataka on 31 January, 2022
to decide whether these provisions are prospective or retrospective, it is the intention of the
legislature which is the sole guide. If the procedure adopted for amendment is substitution and in
the Amended Act it is specifically stated that the substituted provisions come into effect from the
date the amended Rules or Act came into force, the intention of the legislature is clear. On the
pretext that it is the case of substitution, the effect cannot be given to that substituted provision
from the date of the earlier statute. It has to be necessarily from the date the amended rules came
into force.
(emphasis supplied)
61. Accordingly, taking note that the amendment by way of substitution would come into force as
the Central Government would appoint, which is 26.07.2018, it would be appropriate to construe
that the substitution would be effective prospectively.
62. The observations of Apex Court in the case of Hitendra Vishnu Thakur v. State of Maharashtra7
at para- 26 would read as follows:-
"26. ... From the law settled by this Court in various cases the illustrative though not
exhaustive principles which emerge with regard to the ambit and (1994) 4 SCC 602
scope of an Amending Act and its retrospective operation may be culled out as
follows:
(i) A statute which affects substantive rights is presumed to be prospective in
operation unless made retrospective, either expressly or by necessary intendment,
whereas a statute which merely affects procedure, unless such a construction is
textually impossible, is presumed to be retrospective in its application, should not be
given an extended meaning and should be strictly confined to its clearly defined
limits.
(ii) Law relating to forum and limitation is procedural in nature, whereas law relating
to right of action and right of appeal even though remedial is substantive in nature.
(iii) Every litigant has a vested right in substantive law but no such right exists in
procedural law.
(iv) A procedural statute should not generally speaking be applied retrospectively
where the result would be to create new disabilities or obligations or to impose new
duties in respect of transactions already accomplished.
(v) A statute which not only changes the procedure but also creates new rights and
liabilities shall be construed to be prospective in operation, unless otherwise
provided, either expressly or by necessary implication."
(emphasis supplied)
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154562475/ 16
C S Puttaraju vs State Of Karnataka on 31 January, 2022
63. Accordingly, even if it is considered that the provision regarding sanction while taking
cognizance is a procedural aspect of law insofar as proposed amendment casts an obligation that
sanction must be obtained even in the case of "a person who at the time of commission of the alleged
offence is employed" and in terms of the explanation of 'Public Servant' introduced by way of 2018
amendment which includes a person who has ceased to hold office or is holding an office other than
an office during which an offence is alleged to have been committed; such requirement was absent
when the final report came to be filed and is an additional obligation sought to be created, which
interpretation cannot be accepted. This would be the conclusion if the principle laid in the case of
Hitendra Vishnu Thakur (supra) is to be applied.
64. Insofar as applicability of the amended provision under Section 19 to the pending proceedings,
the High Court of Telangana in the case of Katti Nagaseshanna v. State of Andhra Pradesh,
Represented by the Deputy Superintendent of Police and Another8 has also concluded that the
Amendment Act 16 of 2018 imposes a new obligation and duty on the prosecution to obtain sanction
even after retirement of the petitioner from service and that, it is not the intention of the legislation
to defeat all prosecutions pending against retired Government Servants. It was also held that the
intention of legislation to prevent bribery among public servants needs to be taken note of and it is
observed as follows:-
"Coming to the present facts of the case, Section 19(1) of the P.C.Act relates to
procedure to be followed for prosecuting a public servant. When such amendment
imposes new obligation or creating disability, in the absence of any provision giving
retrospective effect, the same cannot be given retrospective effect to defeat all
pending prosecutions against the retired Government order dt. 16.11.2018 in
Crl.P.No.9044/2018 Servants. If such interpretation is given to explanation to
Section 19(1) of P.C.Act by Act 16 of 2018, it will have devastating effect on the
pending prosecutions and it amounts to paving path to the accused persons, who are
retired public servants to sneak away from prosecutions though they committed
serious offences, and such interpretation is against the intendment of the Act itself as
observed in "M.Narayanan Nambiar v. State of Kerala" (referred supra). Therefore, it
is difficult to accept the contention of the learned counsel for petitioner to give
retrospective effect to the amended provision i.e. Section 19(1) of the P.C.Act, which
permits the petitioner to escape from the prosecution. The point is held against the
petitioner and in favour of the respondent."
65. Similar stand is taken by High Court of Kerala in the case of K.R.Ramesh (supra) wherein at
para-44 it is held as hereunder:-
"44. Hence, the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act 2018 has to be held to be
prospective and has no application to cases registered prior to amendment and
pending under various stages of investigation and to cases in which investigation has
been completed and are pending trial. This seems to be in consonance with the
decisions in Syam Sunder's Case (supra) and other similar cases and the view
expressed by this Court in M.C. Chandrasekaran Nair v. State of Kerala (2015 (4) KLJ
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154562475/ 17
C S Puttaraju vs State Of Karnataka on 31 January, 2022
603), wherein the retrospective operation of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988
came up for consideration. Similar view was expressed by a learned Single Judge of
Madras High Court, in Crl.
Appeal. No. 488 of 2018 wherein scope of application of Amendment Act 2018 came up for
consideration. It was held to be not retrospective. Delhi High Court in Madhu Koda's case (Supra)
also, shared the same view. I agree with those views."
66. The conclusion of the Kerala High Court is also required to be accepted by taking note of the
principle that investigation which is completed ought to be saved if conducted under the law then
prevailing, taking note of the principle under Section 6(e) of the General Clauses Act as also the
principle laid down by the Apex Court in the case of Hitendra Vishnu Thakur (supra).
III. To prevent abuse of process of any Court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice:-
67. The trial Court has recorded a finding that the question of granting sanction for prosecution of
accused Nos.4 to 6 which includes the present petitioner does not arise on the following grounds,
viz.,
(a) That the elected representative is elected by the people and not appointed by any person and
accordingly, no person including the Speaker is competent to remove the MLA / MP from his office
and therefore, the question of granting sanction for prosecution of accused Nos.4 to 6 does not arise
at all.
(b) That accused Nos.4 to 6 were the then Members of MUDA and no sanction to prosecute them is
required under the provisions of pre-amended Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.
68. The trial Court has further proceeded to take note of the charge sheet and enclosures and has
opined that prima facie there are sufficient material to take cognizance of the offences alleged and
has ordered to proceed against accused Nos.1 to 24 and while taking cognizance of the offence, has
directed issuance of summons to accused Nos.1 to 24.
69. Insofar as the conclusion that no sanction is required as against the petitioner, the conclusion of
trial Court is indeed correct and could be supported by virtue of the reasoning as made by this Court
in the present order.
70. The conclusion arrived at is correct and it would 'secure the ends of justice' to leave the order of
the trial Court undisturbed. However, the observation made as noticed at point (a) above may not be
correct, as it is the settled position of law that the Speaker would be the competent Authority to
grant sanction for prosecution as regards the elected representatives.
71. The conclusion at point (b) arrived at is a correct conclusion. The said conclusion reflects the
position of law regarding obtaining of sanction as per the provisions of the Act prior to the 2018
Amendment. Though reasons are not assigned to arrive at such conclusion as per the discussion
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154562475/ 18
C S Puttaraju vs State Of Karnataka on 31 January, 2022
made herein, it is the pre-amendment law that would be applicable.
72. The affirmation of the conclusion arrived at by the trial Court which is in accordance with law
despite its reasoning being faulty partially would be an order that would 'secure the ends of justice'
and thereby permitting continuance of the prosecution which in the present case at the least
warrants a full trial.
73. The upholding of the order of the trial Court would also be justified by taking recourse to the
principle (also referred to "Tipsy Coachman Doctrine") evolved by the Supreme Court of Georgia in
the case of Lee v. Porter, 63 Ga. 345 (1879) "..... It may be that we would draw very different
inferences, and these differences might go to uphold the judgment; for many steps in the reasoning
of the court below might be defective, and still its ultimate conclusion be correct. It not infrequently
happens that a judgment is affirmed upon a theory of the case which did not to the court that
rendered it, or which did occur and was expressly repudiated. The human mind is so constituted
that in many instances it finds the truth when wholly unable to find the way that leads to it, "the
pupil of impulse, it forc'd him along, His conduct still right, with his argument wrong; Still aiming at
honor, yet fearing to roam. The coachman was tipsy, the chariot drove home."
Writ dismissed."
Section 482 of Cr.P.C. provides that inherent power can be exercised to prevent abuse of process of
any Court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice.
74. It is clear that the conclusion arrived at by the trial Court is correct. The defect in reasoning in
arriving at such conclusion is liable to be ignored and would require to be so done in order to secure
the ends of justice, which would be consistent with the exercise of jurisdiction under Section 482 of
Cr.P.C.
Accordingly, no interference with the order of trial Court is called for. Petition is dismissed.
