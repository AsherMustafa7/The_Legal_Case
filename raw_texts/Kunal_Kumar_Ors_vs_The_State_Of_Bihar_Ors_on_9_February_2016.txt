CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE AJAY KUMAR TRIPATHI
ORAL JUDGMENT
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/31680409/ 35
Kunal Kumar & Ors vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 9 February, 2016
Date: 09-02-2016 A batch of writ applications got clubbed and heard together because all the writ
applications have a common grievance. The relief is for quashing notification dated 14.09.2015,
issued under the signature of the Secretary (Expenditure), Department of Finance, Government of
Bihar. In the first writ application the said Annexure is Annexure-10. By virtue of the impugned
order, the benefit extended to the petitioners of a pay-scale vide notification dated 16.07.2015,
contained in Annexure-9, issued under the signature of one Sri Dayanidhan Pandey, Addl.
Secretary, Department of Finance, was withdrawn and even steps for recovery was initiated.
Petitioners have rushed to the Court for protection.
Patna High Court CWJC No.17796 of 2015 dt.09-02-2016 34
2. This Court had the privilege of being addressed by several senior counsels and competent
counsels on the diverse questions of law, which emerges for consideration. Effort was made to show
that there was a sound basis for issuance of Anneuxre-9, keeping in mind the benefit which was
extended by the State Government in the Works Department relating to Accounts Clerk. The
notification dated 25.03.2015 is Annexure-7 to the first writ application which provides the details.
3. Looking at the nature of the order which is being passed, the Court intentionally does not want to
apply itself on the expanded submissions or the grounds which, according to the counsels for the
petitioners, can help them to hold on the benefit notified in terms of Annexure-9. The reason is that
the counsels for the petitioners have agreed in unison that the matter may require reconsideration
by the competent and proper authorities on the claim of the petitioners.
4. The Court had directed the Principal AAG to produce original file when a submission was made
on behalf of the State that Annexure-9 was not an order passed by the Government and no proper
deliberation and decision-making at a particular level was done in the Department of Finance. The
Court wanted to be satisfied on this count and, therefore, went through the files. Since it supports
the stand of the Principal AAG, the matter is required to be returned back Patna High Court CWJC
No.17796 of 2015 dt.09-02-2016 35 to the State Government for a fresh consideration of the claim
or the representation of the petitioners, which culminated into issuance of Annexure-9.
5. Since the benefit of Annexure-9 has already been derived by the petitioners across the board on
the basis of the notification, issued by the functionaries of the State Government, therefore, it will be
inequitable to allow them to effect any recovery of the payment already made to the petitioners or
persons similarly placed across the State of Bihar. The Court makes it absolutely clear that there will
be no occasion for effecting recovery of the payment already made so far. If any recovery has been
effected then they have to be refunded to the petitioners or the persons from whom such recovery
has been made. It should be done within a period of one month.
6. A prayer is made on behalf of the petitioners that Annexure-10 should be quashed. The Court is
not inclined to quash Annexure-10 as such but it surely declares that Annexure-10 will be
inoperative till a final decision is taken and notified by the competent authority of the State
Government, which must be done on a fresh application being filed by the association or
representatives of the petitioners before the Principal Secretary, Finance, Government of Bihar, who
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/31680409/ 36
Kunal Kumar & Ors vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 9 February, 2016
has liberty not only to hear the representatives of the Patna High Court CWJC No.17796 of 2015
dt.09-02-2016 36 petitioners but also draw inputs from the departments concerned including the
Secretary (Expenditure), Department of Finance, Government of Bihar, to come to a considered
opinion on the issue.
7. Let a decision on this aspect of the matter be taken within a period of eight weeks from the date of
filing of such an application/representation on behalf of the petitioners with regard to the kind of
pay-scale or parity, which they want to draw in terms of Annexure-7.
8. The Court makes it clear that it has to be a fresh and independent exercise of decision-making,
not influenced by what was notified in Annexure-10.
9. Petitioners will draw salary on the basis of pre Annexure-9 notification from the date of the order.
10. All the writ applications now stands disposed of with above direction.
11. The original files are being returned to the Principal AAG.
