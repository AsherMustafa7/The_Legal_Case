(cid:12) Crl.R.C.No.1443 of 2024
ORDER
Challenging the order of dismissal dated 27.05.2024 in Crl.M.P.No.2712 of 2024, passed by the
learned Principal Special Judge under EC & NDPS Act, Chennai, the Revision Petitioner is before
this Court with the present Revision.
2.Mr.M.Suresh, the learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner is a vehicle
financier. The 2nd respondent is the owner of the Lorry, bearing Reg.No.TN-74-AB-6786, had
approached and availed finance for the Lorry, which was earlier financed by M/s.Equitas Small
Finance Bank Limited. Now, the Lorry seized by the respondent for transporting Ganja of
commercial quantity. The petitioner as financier filed return of property petition, which was
dismissed, against which the present Revision.
3. Mr.N.P.Kumar, the learned Special Public Prosecutor vehemently opposed the petition
submitting that return of property in the NDPS Act Cases cannot be entertained invoking Sections
457 and 451 of Cr.P.C., and it is liable for confiscation under Section 52-A, 60, 61 and 63 of NDPS
Act., unless the owner of the conveyance proves https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis that the
conveyance was used without his knowledge and connivance, he has taken all reasonable precaution
against such use. In support of his contention, the learned Special Public Prosecutor relied on the
Judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Suresh Nanda Vs. Central Bureau of
Investigation reported in (2008) 3 SCC 674 to stress the point that, where there is a special Act
dealing with subject, resort should be to that Act instead of general Act providing for the matter
connected with the specific Act. He stressed his argument mainly on Union of India Vs. Mohanlal
and Another reported in (2016) 3 SCC 379, wherein the Apex Court has given directions for storage,
seizure and sampling, handling and disposal of seized narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.
Considering the piquant situation in which accumulation of huge quantities of seized drugs and
narcotics increased the chances of their pilferage for re-circulation in the market and also finding
that despite Central Government Standing Order No.1/1989 and two subsequent Standing Orders,
dated 10.05.2007 and 16.01.2015 giving directions, directing that no sooner seizure of any narcotic
and psychotropic and controlled substances and conveyances is effected, the same shall be
forwarded to the officer in-charge of the nearest police station or to the officer empowered under
Section 53 of the Act and Section 52-A(2) of the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Act. The sampling
shall be done under the supervision of the Magistrate and the Central and State Government and its
agencies within six months from the date of the order take appropriate steps to set up storage
facilities for the exclusive storage of seized narcotic and psychotropic substances and conveyances,
duly equipped with vaults and double-locking system to prevent theft, pilferage or replacement of
the seized drugs. Further, the Apex Court given direction to constitute Drug Disposal Committee
and disposal of seized drugs lying in the Police Malkhanas and other places used for storage of drugs

P.Vinodh Kumar Surana vs Union Of India on 20 December, 2024
and psychotropic substances.
4. The learned Special Public Prosecutor would further submit that this Court in Crl.R.C(MD)No.41
of 2019 in the case of Nahoorkani Vs. The State of Tamil Nadu on 16.06.2023 held that when the
conveyance is seized under NDPS Act, the return of property does not arise as contemplated under
Sections 451 and 457 of Cr.P.C., and it is liable to be confiscated under Section 63 of the NDPS Act in
the light of special procedure under Section 52-A of the Act. Any person claiming the ownership or
right of the conveyance may approach the concerned Drug Disposal Committee directly and make
claim and the Drug Disposal Committee before taking a decision https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
on disposal of the vehicle, shall grant opportunity of hearing to the parties and pass appropriate
orders on the representation made by the party in accordance with law, as expeditiously as possible,
within a period of two months. Further, if any persons approach the trial Court for release of vehicle,
the property already produced before the trial Court and assigned R.P.Number then such court shall
conduct enquiry and pass suitable orders, as contemplated under Section 63 of the NDPS Act or if
the vehicle not produced before the Court then competent Court shall pass appropriate order by
directing the petitioner to approach concerned Drug Disposal Committee for getting suitable relief.
Further, in the event of trial Court / Special Court for NDPS release the vehicle under Section 451
Cr.P.C., shall initiate the confiscation proceedings and dispose the vehicle as contemplated under
Section 63 of the NDPS Act.
5. Further, he relied on the order of this this Court in Crl.R.C.(MD)No.116 of 2024, dated
08.02.2024 wherein this Court, following the order passed in Nahoorkani's case (cited supra) held
that whenever a return of property is filed, the petitioner has to satisfy Sections 60, 61 and 62 of
NDPS Act. In yet another case, in Crl.R.C(MD)No.1395 of 2023, Gomathi Vs. State, dated
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 27.02.2024, this Court passed orders on the similar line of
Nahoorkani's case. Further, he referred Crl.R.C.No.675 of 2023 in the case of Salimrajan @ Salimraj
Vs. State dated 12.07.2023 wherein this Court again followed the Nahoorkani's case. In sum and
substance, he argued that any property say conveyance seized in NDPS Act cases cannot be returned
as a matter of routine and it is only after satisfying Sections 60, 61, 62, and 63 of the said Act.
6. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner opposed the contention of the learned Special
Public Prosecutor and submitted that Mohanlal's case, refers to Section 52-A primarily with regard
to not following the Standing Order No.1/1989 and the subsequent Standing Orders, dated
10.05.2007 and 16.01.2015, which prescribed procedures to be followed while conducting seizure of
contraband, sampling, safe custody and disposal finding that there is no uniform procedures
followed in seizure, sampling and storing the narcotic in safe vaults and handling and disposal of
seized narcotics, lying in the malkhanas or any other storage place without proper storage facility,
thereby, the danger of recirculation of seized contraband into system is very much likely, hence
issued directions to the Investigation Agency, Magistrate and Governments to follow guidelines.
Further, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis submitted that this Court, following the Apex Court
Judgment in Sainaba Vs. State of Kerala and Anr in Crl.A.No.2005/2022, reported in 2022 (7) KHC
2731, wherein the Apex Court released the vehicle involved in the NDPS Act well after Mohanlals'
case. Hence, it cannot be said that Mohanlal's case places restrictions on release of vehicle. The
Sainaba's case, being the Judgment of the Apex Court this Court finding, it is binding under Article
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/89399137/ 3
P.Vinodh Kumar Surana vs Union Of India on 20 December, 2024
144 of the Constitution of India entertained and allowed the return of property petition filed under
Sections 451 and 457. The citations referred by the Special Public Prosecutor is no more res integra
on the point of return of property. He further added that this Court in Crl.R.C.(MD)No.41 of 2019,
Crl.R.C.(MD)No.116 of 2024 and Crl.R.C.(MD)No.1395 of 2023 and in Crl.R.C.(MD)No.675 of 2022,
the Sainaba's case was not considered. In view of the Apex Court Judgment in Sainaba's case, the
confiscation proceedings cannot be an embargo to consider the return of property petition, but of
course, the return of property petition to be considered on its own merits and hence, there is no
impediment to entertain the above petition.
7. In reply, Mr.N.P.Kumar, the learned Special Public Prosecutor submitted that on specific
information NCB official seized 308 Kgs of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Ganja transported in
the vehicle viz., Lorry, bearing Reg.No.TN-74-AB- 6786 on 25.02.2020 near Karamadai Toll Plaza.
Thereafter, Maruthu Pandi of Madurai and Aandi from Madurai both were arrested. Maruthu Pandi
in his confession, stated that he purchased the old Lorry, bearing Reg.No.TN-74-AB-6786, three
months prior to 25.02.2020. The ownership of the vehicle ascertained from RTO North Madurai. It
was found the vehicle still stands in the name of Maruthu Pandi and not in the petitioner's name.
Hence, opposed for release of vehicle.
8. I have heard the learned counsels appearing on either side and perused the materials available on
record.
9. On perusal of the records it is seen that in Mohanlal's case, the Apex Court finding is that, despite
issuance of the Standing Order No.1/1989 and the subsequent Standing Orders, dated 10.05.2007
and 16.01.2015, no uniform practice and procedures followed by State or Central Agencies in the
matter of drawing of samples at the time of seizure, storage of drugs in safes and vaults, not placed
in double- locking system and piquant situation arose by which accumulation of huge quantities of
the seized drugs and narcotics increased and the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis chances of their
pilferage for re-circulation in the market, hence put in place certain procedures and guidelines to the
Investigation Agency, Magistrate, Central and State Governments, and ordered formation of Drug
Disposal Committee to monitor the same. No direction with regard to the conveyance considered
and issued. Further, the Notification No.G.S.R.899(E), dated 23.12.2022 issued in terms of Section
52-A of the NDPS Act. The question whether there is any legal embargo in view of confiscation
proceedings under Sections 60 to 63 of the NDPS Act and whether petition seeking return of
property under Sections 451 and 457 can be entertained and decided has been dealt in detail by the
Karnataka High Court Division Bench in Rathnamma v. State rep., by PSI, Channagiri Police
Station, Davabagere District in CRL.P.No.3571/2021, which was in conflict to the Division Bench
Judgement of the Kerala High Court in Shajahan Vs. Inspector of Excise and Others reported in
2019 SCC Online Ker 3685, hence the matter was referred to a Larger Bench by the Kerala High
Court and the Kerala High Court in the case of Pradeep B. Vs. The District Drug Disposal Committee
represented by its Chairman, Kasargod and Others in WA No.1304 of 2022, dated 19.02.2024 dealt
in detail, referring to Section 52-A, guidelines given in the Mohanlal's case and held that
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis jurisdictional Special Court under the NDPS Act has power to
consider the grant of interim custody of the vehicle under the Act by invoking powers under Section
457 of Cr.P.C., and answered the reference accordingly. It had also referred to the orders passed by
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/89399137/ 4
P.Vinodh Kumar Surana vs Union Of India on 20 December, 2024
Allahabad High Court in Shams Tavrej v. Union of India reported in 2023 SCC OnLine AII 1154 and
Rajdhari Yadav v. State of U.P. Reported in 2022 SCC OnLine AII 583 and Union of India v.
Tejinder Singh reported in 2023 SCC OnLine Gau 729 and following Sainaba Vs. State of Kerala
(2022 (7) KHC 273) held interim custody of a vehicle involved under the NDPS Act could be
ordered. In Sainaba's case, the procedures contemplated and applicable in NDPS Act in consonace
with Cr.P.C., are dealt in detail. The Apex Court considering both NDPS Act and Cr.P.C., held as
follows:-
“5. It has been opined by the High Court that the Court is not empowered to exercise
the jurisdiction under Section 451 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to release a
vehicle involved under NDPS Act in interim custody.
6.The appellant has urged inter alia that as per Section 36-C read with Section 51 of
the NDPS Act, Criminal Procedure Code would be application for proceedings by a
Special Court under NDPS https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Act and Section 451 has
an inbuilt provision to impose any specific condition on the appellant while releasing
the vehicle. The appellant is undoubtedly the registered owner of the vehicle but had
not participated in the offence as alleged by the prosecution nor had knowledge of the
alleged transaction.
7. Learned counsel seeks to rely on the judgment of this Court in Sunderbhai Ambalal
Desai Vs. State of Gujarat – 2003 (2) KLT 1089 (SC) = (2002) 10 SCC 283 opining
that it is no use to keep such seized vehicles at police station for a long period and it is
open to the Magistrate to pass appropriate orders immediately by taking a bond and
a guarantee as well as security for return of the said vehicle, if required any any point
of time.
8. On hearing learned counsel for parties and in the conspectus of the facts and
circumstances of the case, and the legal provisions referred aforesaid, we are of the
view that this is a appropriate case for release of the vehicle on terms and conditions
to be determined by the Special Court.” https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
10. On perusal of the records it is seen that the petitioner a financier, who financed
for purchase of the vehicle to one A.David Nallathambi, who earlier had hire
purchase agreement with M/s.Equitas Small Finance Bank Limited. Thereafter, the
petitioner financed for purchasing of vehicle viz., Lorry bearing Reg.No.TN-74-
AB-6786. The petitioner and the 2nd respondent entered into a Hire Purchase Agreement on
16.10.2019 for a sum of Rs.6,00,000/-. The petitioner issued a cheque for a sum of Rs.5,82,000/-,
bearing No.681382, drawn on Indian Overseas Bank Wall Tax Road Branch, in favour of Equitas
Small Finance Bank Limited and the same was also encashed by the Equitas. Thereafter, Equitas
Small Finance Bank removed the hypothecation endorsement of the vehicle. After proper transfer of
ownership of the vehicle, the Hire Purchase Agreement holder name could be recorded. On
02.11.2019, the petitioner applied through online RTO Madurai to register his name as Hire
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/89399137/ 5
P.Vinodh Kumar Surana vs Union Of India on 20 December, 2024
Purchase Agreement holder of the vehicle. The 2nd respondent failed to repay the loan amount, as
per the schedule of hire purchase agreement. The 2nd respondent failed to produce the vehicle
before the Madurai RTO for inspection. Hence, hire purchase endorsement could not be made in the
Registration Certificate. In the meanwhile, the 2nd respondent was arrested for transportation of
308 Kgs Ganja https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis and the lorry was seized. Hence the petitioner filed
Return Of Property petition before the lower Court and the same was dismissed finding that lorry is
in the name of the 2nd respondent / Maruthupandi and the petitioner's hypothecation not recorded
and registered in the registration certificate of the vehicle, the petition for return of property not
considered.
11. The petitioner a vehicle financier. Along with the petition, he produced Hire Purchase
Agreement, dated 16.10.2019. As per the hire purchase agreement, the 2nd respondent / Maruthu
Pandi to pay the EMI from 16.11.2019 to 16.10.2022. The hire purchase agreement is for a period of
36 months. The hire purchase agreement signed by Maruthu Pandi as well as the petitioner. The
petitioner discharging the earlier finance availed for the vehicle with Equitas has been proved by the
petitioner making payment to Equitas on 22.10.2019 by Cheque No.681382 for sum of
Rs.5,82,000/-. The petitioner financed for purchase of the vehicle and the vehicle was seized on
25.02.2020 that is within four months of the petitioner financing a sum of Rs.6,00,000/- for the
2nd respondent to purchase the vehicle is confirmed.
12. The petitioner is not an accused. He is a hire purchase https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
financier. The vehicle viz., Lorry bearing Reg.No.TN-74-AB-6786, availed hire purchase finance by
the 2nd respondent. In view of the same, the petitioner, a financier and hirer of the vehicle, has right
to repossess the vehicle. Further, if the vehicle is kept in open yard exposed to sunlight and rain, the
condition of the said vehicle will be deteriorating day-by-day and the value of the vehicle will get
diminished.
13. Hence, following the Supreme Court Judgment, in Sainaba's case, and the Full Bench of Kerala
High Court in Pradeep's case, this Court finds the objection of the learned Public Prosecutor that
there is total embargo in entertaining the petition for return of property under the relevant
provision of Cr.P.C., is no more res intergra. In view of the same, this Court is inclined to entertain
and consider the grant of interim custody of vehicles seized under the NDPS by invoking the power
under Sections 451 and 457 of Cr.P.C consequently under Section 497 and 503 BNSS.
14. The lower Court following the guidelines given in Sunderbhai Ambalal Desai case of the Apex
Court, take photographs, record the features of the vehicle, prepare a proceeding to be used as proof
in the trial.
15. In view of the foregoing reasons, this Criminal Revision https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Stands
allowed with a direction to the learned Principal Special Judge under EC & NDPS Act, Chennai, to
release the petitioner's vehicle viz., Lorry, bearing Reg.No.TN-74-AB-6786, in favour of the
petitioner on the petitioner submitting an undertaking on the following terms and conditions:-
