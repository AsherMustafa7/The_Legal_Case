JUDGMENT
As per Nandita Dubey, J.:
Criminal appeal Nos. 1552/2005, 1569/2005 and 1605/2005 arise out of the same
incident and, therefore, heard and decided concomitantly.
2. These three appeals arise out of judgment dated 29.07.2005 passed by Fourth Additional Sessions
Judge (Fast Track), Sidhi in S.T. No.164/2004, whereby the appellant Kishan Singh @ Krishnapal
Singh has been found guilty of an offence punishable under Section 302 read with Section 120-B of
the Indian Penal Code and has been sentenced to life imprisonment with fine of Rs. 500/- in default
rigorous imprisonment for one month and appellants Manish @ Bablu and Vikas @ Pinku have
been found guilty of an offence punishable under Sections 302 read with 1569/2005 & 1605/2005
Section 120-B and 201 of the Indian Penal Code and have been sentenced to life imprisonment with
fine of Rs. 500/- and rigorous imprisonment for 7 years and fine of Rs.200/- respectively and in
default further rigorous imprisonment for one month for each offence.
3. Prosecution case, in short, is that the appellants committed the murder of Promod Singh @ Dadu,
by drowning him in Gopal Das Dam and thereafter with the intention of disposing the body, hid it in
a paddy field.
4. According to prosecution, on 05.09.2004, at about 3.00 A.M., P.W.-3 Mahesh Prasad Gupta
lodged a report to the effect that he had been robbed of his pickup truck. During the investigation,
appellants Manish and Vikas were taken into custody on suspicion. On interrogation,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13015369/ 2
Vikas @ Pinku vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 November, 2017
accused/appellants Manish and Vikas disclosed about the commission of murder of Promod Singh
by drowning him in Gopal Das Dam with the help of appellant Kishan and expressed their
willingness to show the place where they had committed the murder of Pramod Singh. According to
the prosecution, appellants Manish and Vikas were 1569/2005 & 1605/2005 going in NE car to
dispose of the body, but on account of the fact that there was no fuel in the car, they hid the body of
the deceased in a paddy field near the Sidhi-Rewa main road.
5. On the basis of memorandum (Ex. P-9 & Ex. P-10) of appellants Manish and Vikas, body of the
deceased was recovered from open paddy field, next to the Sidhi-Rewa road. Dehati Merg (Ex.P.-40)
and panchnama was recorded and spot map (Ex.P-12) was made. Body of the deceased was sent to
mortuary. The police party thereafter proceeded to Gopal Das Dam, from where they recovered a
piece of shirt pocket and a white button (Ex.P-13) and thereafter proceeded to the house of appellant
Kishan, from where a shirt with missing pocket was seized.
6. Body of the deceased was sent for postmortem. The postmortem report indicates that the body
was in an advanced stage of decomposition. Dr. K.S. Nigam (P.W.-4), who conducted the
postmortem has opined that death was homicidal in nature and occurred due to asphyxia but could
not determine the actual cause for asphyxia due to the 1569/2005 & 1605/2005 decomposed stage.
7. The accused/appellants were put to trial. The prosecution examined as many as 15 witnesses. The
statement of the accused persons under Section 313 of the Cr.P.C. were recorded. The defence
examined 3 witnesses in support of their case.
8. The learned trial Court found the appellants guilty of committing the offence as aforesaid, on the
basis of statement/evidence of P.W.-1 Dr. Chandra Kant Mishra, P.W.-4 Dr. K.S. Nigam and on the
basis of documentary evidence Ex.P-1 and Ex.P-2 postmortem report and on this basis held that
death of deceased Promod was homicidal. The trial Court has reached to a conclusion that the death
of deceased was the result of "dry drowning" relying on page 164 of 20 th edition of Medical
Jurisprudence and Toxicology by Dr. Modi. The trial Court further relying on the evidence of P.W.-6
Snehlata Singh and P.W.-8 Jitendra Singh held that the accused/appellants were the persons, last
seen with the deceased. The trial Court on the basis of aforesaid evidence found the chain of
circumstances to be complete and held that the prosecution has proved the 1569/2005 & 1605/2005
guilt of the appellants beyond reasonable doubt and convicted them as aforesaid.
9. Shri Surendra Singh, learned senior counsel appearing for appellant Kishan and Shri Prakash
Upadhyay and Shri Jai Shukla, learned counsel respectively appearing for the appellants Vikas and
Manish have raised the following submissions in support of the appeals :-
(i) There is no proof of homicidal death.
Medical evidence negate the death by drowning.
(ii) There were no eye witnesses of the events. Circumstantial link was not proved beyond doubt.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13015369/ 3
Vikas @ Pinku vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 November, 2017
(iii) Recovery of Shirt pocket and button from Gopal Das Dam would not lead to the conclusion that
it was appellant Kishan, who had committed the murder.
(iv) The memorandum and seizure
were fabricated.
10. Shri Ajay Shukla and Shri Anubhav Jain, learned Govt. Advocates appearing for the
respondent/State have supported the judgment. It 1569/2005 & 1605/2005 was contended that
finding and conclusion arrived at by the Court below was based on cogent evidence and the
circumstantial evidence brought on record by the prosecution were sufficient to convict the accused
persons.
11. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties at length and on meticulous perusal of record, it
is clear that there is no direct evidence to establish that the appellants murdered the deceased
Pramod by drowning him in Gopal Das Dam and the evidence regarding the murder is purely
circumstantial.
12. First of all, we may deal with the argument advanced on behalf of the appellants that the cause of
death is not evident from the postmortem report and there is no proof that death was homicidal.
According to learned Senior Counsel, once the cause of death is not proved, the appellants would be
entitled to an order of acquittal.
13. Postmortem report is exhibited as Ex.P-2 and the relevant part thereof reads as under :-
1569/2005 & 1605/2005 "Naked body wearing underwear lying flat with extended
arms and legs with partial flexon at knee joint, i n stage of advanced decomposition of
body. Vesicles present all over the body.
Skin pealed off specially face,
abdomen, neck, back. Maggot's
present over both eyeballs and rectal area. Rigor mortis passed off. Foul smelling
present. Both eyes open and protruded. Mouth open, tongue lied between the teeth.
Tip of tongue protruded, crushed between tooth and tip of tongue cyanosed. Both
pupils dilated and fixed. Whole body was swollen. Face cyanosed. Nails cyanosed.
Conjunctiva congested.
Abdomen was distended. Neck
cyanosed. Scrotum and penis was
oedematus."
"On knees following injuries were present :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13015369/ 4
Vikas @ Pinku vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 November, 2017
1. Abrasion on the front of right knee 2 x 1 inch in size, dry blood clot and oedema
was present (Ante mortem in nature).
2. Abrasion present over front of left knee, 3x1 inch in size, dry blood clot present."
Postmortem lividity present over chest and upper part of abdomen.
No water was present over both middle ear cavity."
1569/2005 & 1605/2005 Opinion of the doctor.
"In our opinion, deceased died of asphyxia. Actual cause of Asphyxia could not detected due to
advance decomposition of the body. Police may investigate the cause. Viscera's, cloth's and trachea
preserved. Time lapsed was between 24 to 36 hours.
Homicidal in nature."
14. The doctor was examined as P.W.-4. The doctor has opined that the death could be due to
asphyxia, but did not say as to how he reached to that conclusion in absence of any marks/injury on
the body. The doctor has categorically deposed that no water was present over both middle ear
cavity of the deceased and the death has not occurred due to drowning. The FSL report brought on
record is also inconclusive as regard to the death by drowning. Moreover, there is no evidence or eye
witnesses to the effect that deceased was taken to the Gopal Das Dam and murdered by drowning. It
is also evident from the evidence of P.W.-1 Dr. C.K. Mishra, Sr. Scientist and P.W.-11 Ramendra
Singh that the body of deceased was found lying face down in an open paddy field, next 1569/2005
& 1605/2005 to the main road, visible to all. Body was found lying flat with extended arms and legs
with partial flex on at knee joint. The photographs (Ex.P-17 to P-25) clearly show that the deceased
was wearing only underpants which were drawn half down to his knees. One hand of the body was
extended in air as if tying to break the fall. As per the evidence that has come on record that
deceased and appellants were under the influence of alcohol and intoxicated. There were abrasions
on both the knees and according to P.W.-4 K.S. Nigam, the same could have been the result of
accidental fall. Under these circumstances, looking to the position of the body recovered, the
possibility that the deceased fell face down while sitting in the field to ease himself and accidentally
suffocated himself cannot be ruled out.
15. The trial Court on the basis of Modi's Medical Jurisprudence had arrived on the conclusion that
it was a case of "dry drowning". However, the trial Court has totally ignored the fact that Modi's
Medical Jurisprudence also says that even an adult can accidentally suffocate himself under the
influence of 1569/2005 & 1605/2005 alcohol or epileptic by falling face down (page 580, 23rd
edition). From a perusal of Ex.P-36, it is evident that for determining the cause of death or to form
an opinion that the death was caused by drowning, it was essential to perform "diatom test",
however the same was not asked for by the police or the team of doctors, who conducted the
postmortem. From the evidence on record, it is clear that there is no other evidence or proof to
prove that it was a case of homicidal death.

Vikas @ Pinku vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 November, 2017
16. Similar issue as to whether the death is homicidal, came up for consideration in the case State of
Punjab Vs. Bhajan Singh AIR 1975 SC 258, where the Supreme Court after considering the
testimony of the doctor has held :-
"Question then arises as to whether the death of the two persons whose dead bodies
were recovered was homicidal. So far as this aspect is concerned, we find that Dr.
Saluja has deposed that he found no marks of ligature on either of the two dead
bodies. According further to the doctor, he could not find the cause of death because
the two dead bodies were in a de- composed state. In the face of the above evidence of
the doctor, it is not possible to hold that the death of the two persons, whose bodies
were recovered, 1569/2005 & 1605/2005 was homicidal.
17. In Madho Singh Vs. State of Rajasthan (2010) 15 SCC 588, the Supreme Court has held :-
"The primary, if not solitary basis of the conviction of the appellants is on the theory
of last seen as the deceased left his house with the appellants at about 11.00p.m. on
the 1st May, 1999. In order to convict the appellants for an offence under section 302
the first and foremost aspect to be proved by the prosecution is the homicidal death.
The evidence on record produced by the prosecution falls short of the proof of
homicidal death of Om Singh. According to PW11 Dr. Lakhan Lal, his face had been
crushed. According to testimony of PW15 Dr. Disaniya, the injuries received by the
deceased could be sustained in the accident. Besides these two witnesses, there is no
evidence to prove that it was a case of homicidal death."
18. Apart from the aforesaid, the alleged NE car said to have been used in the incident has not been
subjected to chemical examination so as to determine whether the body of the deceased was infact
carried into it, nor investigated as regard the ownership of the car. Moreover, recovery of shirt
pocket and button from Gopal Das Dam in absence of any other 1569/2005 & 1605/2005
corroborative evidence will have no direct bearing on the death of deceased and would not lead to
the conclusion that it was appellant Kishan, who committed the murder.
19. As per P.W-1 Dr. C.K Mishra and P.W.-4 Dr. K.S. Nigam, the body of the deceased was in an
advanced stage of decomposition as described in the preceding paragraphs. According to Modi's
Jurisprudence, page 342, the duration of rigor mortis is 24 to 48 hours in winter and 18 to 36 hours
in summer. The maggots are normally formed after an average of 39 hours of the death. In the
instant case, from the condition of the body as described above, it is evident that the death of the
deceased has occurred much prior to the time as alleged by the prosecution.
20. It is settled law that inferences drawn by the Court have to be on the basis of established case
and not on conjectures. The prosecution came out with a specific case that deceased Promod was
murdered by drowning him in Gopal Das Dam, however, the same is not established from the
medical evidence that has come on record. Hence, the 1569/2005 & 1605/2005 inferences drawn by
the trial Court that deceased Pramod Singh was murdered by drowning in Gopal Das Dam and
thereafter his body was carried in the NE car and disposed of in the paddy field is perverse and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13015369/ 6
Vikas @ Pinku vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 November, 2017
cannot be sustained.
21. The prosecution has relied on the testimony of P.W.-6 Snehlata and P.W.-8 Jitendra Singh to
prove that the appellants were last seen together with the deceased. It is settled law that the
circumstances of last seen together cannot by itself form the basis of holding the accused guilty of
the offence.
22. The principles of circumstantial evidence is reiterated in Nizam and another Vs. State of
Rajasthan (2016) 1 SCC 550, the Supreme Court has held :-
8. Case of the prosecution is entirely based on the circumstantial evidence. In a case
based on circumstantial evidence, settled law is that the circumstances from which
the conclusion of guilt is drawn should be fully proved and such circumstances must
be conclusive in nature. Moreover, all the circumstances should be complete, forming
a chain and there should be no gap left in the chain 1569/2005 & 1605/2005 of
evidence. Further, the proved circumstances must be consistent only with the
hypothesis of the guilt of the accused totally inconsistent with his innocence.
23. In State of Uttar Pradesh Vs. Shyam Behari and another (2009) 15 SCC 548, referring to the case
of Gambhir Vs State of Maharashtra (1982) 2 SCC 351, the Supreme Court has held:-
"The law regarding circumstantial evidence is well settled. When a case rests upon
the circumstantial evidence, such evidence must satisfy three tests:
(1) the circumstances from which an inference of guilt is sought to be drawn must be
cogently and firmly established: (2) those circumstances should be of a definite
tendency unerringly pointing towards guilt of the accused; (3) the circumstances,
taken cumulatively, should form a chain so complete that there is no escape from the
conclusion that within all human probabilities the crime was committed by the
accused and none else. 4. The circumstantial evidence in order to sustain conviction
must be complete and incapable of explanation of any order hypothesis than that of
the guilt of the accused. The circumstantial evidence should not only be consistent
with the guilt of the 1569/2005 & 1605/2005 accused but should be inconsistent with
his innocence. (See Gambhir v. State of Maharashtra, AIR 1982 SC, 1157)
24. In the instant case, the trial Court has relied on the testimony of P.W.-6 Smt. Snehlata Singh and
P.W.-8 Jitendra Singh. According to these witnesses, the deceased was seen with the appellants
between 6 P.M. to 11 P.M. on 04.09.2004 roaming around in NE car at different places. According
to P.W.-6 Snehlata, the deceased went out with the appellants in their NE car on 04.09.2004 at 6.00
P.M to visit one Vivek at Rewa. According to P.W.-6, she and her father were informed about the
death of Pramod on 05.09.2004 by one Inspector Baghel, but despite knowing about the murder of
her brother, she did not disclose the fact of her brother going with the appellant to the police. It is
only after 20-25 days of the incident, when for the first time she made a statement to this effect.
According to P.W.-5 Harikeshav Singh and P.W.-6 Snehlata, the deceased and the appellants were
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13015369/ 7
Vikas @ Pinku vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 November, 2017
good friends.
25. P.W.-8 Jitendra Singh claimed to have seen the appellants and deceased together at 11 P.M. at a
1569/2005 & 1605/2005 liquor shop near the bus stand. The statement of P.W.- 8 Jitendra Singh is
also doubtful for the fact that he claimed to have seen the dead body at 9.00 P.M. on 5.09.2004,
whereas, according to prosecution the memorandum of appellants (Ex.P-9 & P-10) regarding the
place where body of deceased was hidden was taken at 9.10 P.M. and the body was recovered at
around 10.00 P.M. (Ex.P-11). This witness admits his presence at the spot from where the dead body
was recovered but surprisingly did not disclose the fact of having seen the deceased with appellants
on the previous night, i.e., on 04.09.2004 at 11.00 P.M. as claimed by him.
26. From the evidence on record, it is clear that there is unexplained delay in recording the
statement of P.W.-6 Snehlata and P.W.-8 Jitendra and on their part in disclosing the fact of last seen
to the police. The delay in recording of statement and the conduct of these witnesses in not
disclosing the fact to police or to anyone else for the matter renders their story doubtful and
unreliable.
1569/2005 & 1605/2005
27. In Harbeer Singh Vs. Sheeshpal and others (2016) 16 SCC 418 the Supreme Court has held:
17. However, Ganesh Bhavan Patel Vs. State Of Maharashtra, (1978) 4 SCC 371, is an
authority for the proposition that delay in recording of statements of the prosecution
witnesses under Section 161 Cr.P.C., although those witnesses were or could be
available for examination when the Investigating Officer visited the scene of
occurrence or soon thereafter, would cast a doubt upon the prosecution case. [See
also Balakrushna Swain Vs. State Of Orissa, (1971) 3 SCC 192;
Maruti Rama Naik Vs. State of Mahrashtra, (2003) 10 SCC 670 and Jagjit Singh Vs.
State of Punjab, (2005) 3 SCC 68]. Thus, we see no reason to interfere with the
observations of the High Court on the point of delay and its corresponding impact on
the prosecution case.
28. In Madho Singh Vs. State of Rajasthan (2010) 15 SCC 588, the Supreme Court has held:
8. In the absence of proof of homicidal death the appellants cannot be convicted
merely on the theory of last seen - 'they having gone with the deceased in the manner
noticed hereinbefore. The appellants' conviction cannot be maintained merely on
1569/2005 & 1605/2005 suspicion, however strong it may be, or on their conduct.
These facts assume further importance on account of absence of proof of motive
particularly when it is proved that all the three were good friends for over a decade.
29. In the case of circumstantial evidence, not only the various links in the chain of evidence should
be clearly established but the complete chain must be such as to rule out the likelihood of innocence
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13015369/ 8
Vikas @ Pinku vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 November, 2017
of the accused. In the present case, even if the evidence of appellants having been seen last seen
together with deceased is accepted, it would at best amount to be evidence of last seen together with
the deceased, but in absence any other satisfactory link connecting the appellants to the crime and
pointing to the guilt of the appellants, the only circumstance of last seen together cannot be made
basis of the conviction.
30. Apart from the aforesaid, it is clear from the record that there are major discrepancies and
contradictions, embellishment in the prosecution story. There is major contradictions in the
evidence of P.W.-1 Dr. C.K. Mishra and P.W.-11 Ramendra Singh. According to P.W.-1 Dr. C.K.
Mishra, he got the 1569/2005 & 1605/2005 information to inspect the spot at 12 O'Clock in the mid
night of 5.09.2004 and conducted the inspection on 6.09.2004 (Ex.P-1) at 8.00 A.M. He found the
body lying face down in open field next to road, in the condition as described in the preceding
paragraphs. Whereas, according to P.W.-11 Ramendra Singh, the body was removed from the spot
after taking photographs on 5.09.2004 and kept in mortuary at 12 O'Clock in the night and sent for
postmortem at 8.00 A.M. in the morning of 06.09.2004. This fact is also corroborated by P.W.-4 Dr.
K.S. Nigam, who conducted the postmortem at 8.00 A.M. on 06.09.2004.
31. Apart from the aforesaid, the time entered on the memorandum does not found corroboration
from the statement of other witnesses. The prosecution claimed to have recorded the memorandum
at 9.00 and 9.10 P.M. and recovered the body at 10.00 P.M. However, P.W.-9 Krishnapratap Singh,
witness of memorandum has stated that memorandum was recorded at 7.15 P.M. and thereafter the
body of deceased was recovered at 7.30 P.M. These vital contradictions in the evidence of
1569/2005 & 1605/2005 prosecution witnesses makes the entire prosecution story doubtful and
given strength to the claim of appellants that the memorandum and seizure documents were made
up and fabricated.
32. In Kali Ram Vs. State of Himachal Pradesh AIR 1973 SC 2773, the Supreme Court has observed
as under:
"Another golden thread which runs through the web of the administration of justice
in criminal cases is that if two views are possible on the evidence adduced in the case
one pointing to the guilt of the accused and the other to his innocence, the view which
is favourable to the accused should be adopted. This principle has a special relevance
in cases where in the guilt of the accused is sought to be established by circumstantial
evidence."
33. In Sharad Birdhichand Sarda Vs. State of Maharashtra AIR 1984 SC 1622, the Supreme Court
has held as under:
"The facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of
the accused. There should not be explainable on any other hypothesis except that the
accused is guilty. The 1569/2005 & 1605/2005 circumstances should be of a
conclusive nature and tendency. There must be a chain of evidence so complete as
not to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13015369/ 9
Vikas @ Pinku vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 20 November, 2017
of the accused and must show that in all human probability the act must have been
done by the accused.
Graver the crime, greater should be the standard of proof. An accused may appear to
be guilty on the basis of suspicion but that cannot amount to legal proof. When on the
evidence two possibilities are available or open, one which goes in the favour of the
prosecution and the other benefits an accused, the accused is undoubtedly entitled to
the benefit of doubt. The principle has special relevance where the guilt or the
accused is sought to be established by circumstantial evidence."
34. In view of the medical evidence on record, the death of deceased Pramod Singh could not be
termed as homicidal and in absence of the proof of homicidal death, the appellants cannot be
convicted merely on the theory of last seen. In view of the aforesaid circumstances, there is nothing
on record to conclusively establish that the appellants were the author of the crime. The
circumstances on the record do not rule out every other hypothesis except the guilt 1569/2005 &
1605/2005 of the appellants and in our view, the prosecution has filed to establish the guilt of the
appellants beyond reasonable doubt. Under the circumstances, the appellants are entitled to the
benefit of doubt.
35. In view of the above, it is clear that the prosecution has failed to prove the case against the
appellants beyond reasonable doubt. Thus, the appeals succeed and are hereby allowed. The
conviction and sentence imposed on the appellants is set aside. The appellants, who are on bail shall
be discharged of their bail bonds.
36. A copy of this judgment be also kept in the record of Cr.A. Nos. 1569/2005 and 1605/2005.
