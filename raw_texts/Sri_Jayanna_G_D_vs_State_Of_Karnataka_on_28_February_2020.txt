THIS WRIT PETITION COMING ON FOR ORDERS THIS DAY,
THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:
ORDER
Learned Additional Government Advocate is directed to take notice for respondent No.1.
Sri P.V.Chandrashekar, learned counsel takes notice for respondent Nos.2 and 3.
2. The grievance of the petitioners is that the respondents have passed a general award, while the
petitioners seek payment of compensation by way of a consent award under Section 29(2) of the
Karnataka Industrial Area Development Act, 1996 (for short, 'KIAD Act'). Learned counsel for the
petitioners brings to the notice of this Court a decision of a co-ordinate Bench in the case of
Smt.Kariyamma and another Vs. State of Karnataka and others, which was decided on 19th March,
2018 in W.P.Nos.45731 and 46444/2017 and connected matters. In the said matters, the co-ordinate
bench, while noticing a decision of this Court in Smt.Ningamma Vs. The State of Karnataka and
others, which was decided on 25.08.2015, in W.P.No.6198/2015 held that a similar consideration is
necessarily to be made in the instant petitions.
3. The portion extracted in Smt.Ningamma's case is extracted herein below for better
understanding.
"Petitioner is assailing the General Award dated 30th December 2013, Annexure-A,
of the 3rd respondent-Karnataka Industrial Area Development board (for short
KIADB) insofar as it relates to 1 acre 39 guntas in Sy.No.444 of Cheeluru village,
Maralavadi Hobli, Kanakapura Taluk, Ramanagara District, on the premise that her
claim for determination of compensation ought to be by way of an agreement under
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166958232/ 2
Sri Jayanna G D vs State Of Karnataka on 28 February, 2020
Sub-section (2) of Section 29 of the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Act,
1966 (for short 'KIAD Act') since willing to the enter into an agreement after having
obtained a compromise decree dated 6.12.2014 in O.S.126/2013 whereunder the
property in question is declared to be the absolute property of the petitioner.
2. Sub-section (2) of Section 29 of the 'KIAD Act' provides for determination of compensation by an
agreement and in the light of the compromise decree whereunder, the property in question has
fallen to the exclusive share of the petitioner, is entitled to such a consideration, since it is stated
that by such an agreement, petitioner would be entitled to a better price as compensation instead of
determination under a general award, while acquisition proceeding would attain a finality
disentitling petitioner to challenge the same in this petition. In the circumstances, there is a need to
interfere with General Award Annexure-A insofar as it relates to petitioner's land.
3. In the result, this petition is allowed. General Award Annexure-A insofar as it relates to petitioner
is concerned is quashed. A direction shall ensue to respondent-KIADB to consider the case of the
petitioner for determination of compensation by way of an agreement under Section 29(2) of the
'KIAD Act' to be complied with as expeditiously as possible within an outer limit of 31st October
2015. It is made clear that this order is applicable only if there is any dispute to title in the
immovable property acquired and if there is one, the General Award in respect of petitioner is
concerned shall stand restored until the dispute is resolved."
4. In Smt.Kariyamma's case, the General award was set aside insofar of the petitioners therein were
concerned and directions were issued to the respondents to consider the case of the petitioners for
determination of compensation in terms of Section 29(2) of the KIAD Act.
5. In view of the above, the petition is allowed. The General Award made in the instant petition at
Annexure-J, insofar as the petitioners are concerned are set aside. The respondents are directed to
consider the case of the petitioners for determination of compensation in terms of Section 29(2) of
the KIAD Act. The consideration shall be made as expeditiously as possible and in any case, within a
period of three months from the date of receipt of certified copy of this order.
It is made clear that in the event of there being any dispute with regard to title, the observation as
contained in the above extracted portion shall become applicable to the present case as well.
Respondent No.3 is permitted to withdraw the compensation, if any, is already deposited, in order
to enable respondent No.3 to reconsider the compensation in terms of the directions issued by this
Court. It is ordered accordingly.
Learned counsels appearing for the respondents are permitted to file Memo of
Appearance/Vakalath, as the case may be, within a period of two weeks from today.
