quashing the first information report (for short 'FIR') of

Suchit Kumar vs The State Of Bihar Through The Directer ... on 26 March, 2019
Gaurichak P.S. Case No. 256 of 2018 registered under Sections
279 and 427 of the Indian Penal Code (for short 'IPC') and
Patna High Court CR. WJC No.526 of 2019 dt.26-03-2019
2/8
Section 139 of the Electricity Act, 2003.
3. Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner has
submitted that even if the entire allegations made in the FIR are
believed to be true, no case for investigation by the police is
made out. He has submitted that on the admitted facts of the
case, the essential ingredients to constitute an offence under
Section 279 of the IPC are not attracted. Apart from Section 279
of the IPC, Section 427 of the IPC and Section 139 of the
Electricity Act, 2003 are non-cognizable offences. In view of the
statutory bar provided under sub-section (2) of Section 155 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure (for short 'CrPC'), the police
have no authority to institute an FIR and investigate into the
same when the offences alleged are non-cognizable.
4. Per contra, learned counsel appearing for the State
has submitted that it is true that the offences punishable under
Section 427 of the IPC and Section 139 of the Electricity Act,
2003 are non-cognizable, but the offence under Section 279 of
the IPC is a cognizable one. In case, the allegations made in the
FIR constitute both cognizable and non-cognizable offences, the
police would have jurisdiction to institute an FIR and
investigate into the same. He has further contended that the
allegations made in the FIR would certainly attract the

ingredients of the offence punishable under Section 279 of the
IPC.
5. Learned counsel appearing for respondent no. 6 has
supported the contentions advanced on behalf of the State. He
has submitted that from the allegations made in the FIR, it
would be evident that on 28.07.2018, in the night, at about 02.35
a.m., the truck belonging to the petitioner was being driven in a
rash and negligent manner and it had badly damaged 11KV
electric pole, as a result of which the supply of power was
interrupted in the entire Gaurichak village for about 18 hours.
He has contended that since the investigation is going on, it
would not be proper for this Court to interdict the FIR on the
basis of defence taken by the petitioner at this stage.
6. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and
carefully perused the allegations made in the FIR of Gaurichak
P.S. Case No. 256 of 2018, as contained in Annexure-1 to this
application.
7. In order to appreciate the rival submissions made
on behalf of the parties, it would be proper to look into the
allegations made in the FIR.
8. The FIR has been instituted on the basis of the
written report submitted by one Pradeep Kumar Rai, a Junior
Patna High Court CR. WJC No.526 of 2019 dt.26-03-2019

Suchit Kumar vs The State Of Bihar Through The Directer ... on 26 March, 2019
Electrical Engineer, Sampatchak, Patna wherein he has stated
that on 28.07.2018, in the night, at about 02.35 am, a truck
bearing registration no. BR11 GB-0329 collided with 11KV
electric pole near Upgraded Middle School, Ajimchak as a result
of which power supply in the Gaurichak village was interrupted
for nearly 18 hours depriving 1500 consumers from
consumption of Electricity. The said act of the driver of the
vehicle has resulted into a loss of Rs. 71,000/- to the South
Bihar Power Distribution Company Ltd.
9. On the basis of the aforesaid written report, the
informant Pradeep Kumar Rai alleged that an FIR under Section
135 and other relevant provisions of the Electricity Act, 2003 be
registered against the owner of the truck in question.
10. On the basis of the aforesaid written report,
Gaurichak P.S. Case No. 256 of 2018 was registered on
28.07.2018
under Sections 279 and 427 of the IPC and Section 139 of the Electricity Act, 2003.
11. In view of the submissions made on behalf of the petitioner that the allegations made in the FIR
would not attract the ingredients of any cognizable offence, at this stage, it would be apt to extract
the provision prescribed under Section 279 of the IPC hereunder:
Patna High Court CR. WJC No.526 of 2019 dt.26-03-2019 "279. Rash driving or
riding on a public way.--Whoever drives any vehicle, or rides, on any public way in a
manner so rash or negligent as to endanger human life, or to be likely to cause hurt or
injury to any other person, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description
for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine which may extend to one
thousand rupees, or with both."
12. From a reading of the aforesaid provision, it would be manifest that in order to constitute an
offence under Section 279 of the IPC there must be an allegation of driving of a vehicle, or riding on
a public way and such driving or riding must be so rash and negligent as to endanger human life or
to be likely to cause hurt or injury to any other person.

13. In the instant case, there is no allegation that the truck in question was being driven rashly and
negligently as to endanger human life. There is also no allegation that the alleged act of the driver of
the truck in question was likely to cause hurt or injury to any other person. In absence of the
aforesaid allegations in the written report, it can safely be said that the essential ingredients for
constituting the offence punishable under Section 279 of the IPC was not attracted even on admitted
facts.
Patna High Court CR. WJC No.526 of 2019 dt.26-03-2019
14. As far as Section 427 of the IPC is concerned, the same is admittedly a non-cognizable offence.
15. The only other offence alleged in the FIR is Section 139 of the Electricity Act, 2003, which
provides that whoever, negligently breaks, injures, throws down or damage any material concerned
with the supply of electricity, shall be punishable with fine which may extent to ten thousand rupees.
16. The Electricity Act, 2003 is a special Act under which Section 139 has not been classified as a
cognizable offence.
17. In regard to offences under the IPC in the first schedule of the CrPC classification as to whether a
particular offence is cognizable or non-cognizable has been made. Schedule II of the CrPC classifies
the offences against other laws. Schedule II stipulates that if offence is punishable with
imprisonment for less than three years or with fine only, the same would be a non-cognizable
offence.
18. Since 139 of the Electricity Act, 2003 prescribes fine only, as per Schedule II of the CrPC, it will
be deemed to be a non-cognizable offence.
19. Non-cognizable offence has been defined under Section 2(l) of the CrPC as an offence for which,
a police officer Patna High Court CR. WJC No.526 of 2019 dt.26-03-2019 has no authority to arrest
without warrant.
20. Sub-section (1) of Section 155 of the CrPC provides that when information is given to an officer
in charge of a police station of the commission within the limits of such station of a non-cognizable
offence, he shall enter or cause to be entered the substance of the information in a book to be kept
by such officer in such form as the State Government may prescribe in this behalf, and refer the
informant to the Magistrate.
21. Sub-section (2) of Section 155 of the CrPC provides that no police officer shall investigate a
non-cognizable offence without the order of a Magistrate having power to try such case or commit
the case for trial.
22. In view of the statutory bar sub-section (2) of Section 155 of the CrPC, as no case is made out
under Section 279 of the IPC even on admitted facts and the other offences alleged under the IPC
and the Electricity Act, 2003 in the FIR are non-cognizable, in my considered opinion, the police

Suchit Kumar vs The State Of Bihar Through The Directer ... on 26 March, 2019
authority had no jurisdiction to institute an FIR on the basis of the written complaint and proceed
with the investigation without the order of a Magistrate.
23. Accordingly, the FIR of Gaurichak P.S. Case No. 256 of 2018 as also investigation conducted
pursuant to the Patna High Court CR. WJC No.526 of 2019 dt.26-03-2019 institution of the said FIR
is hereby quashed.
24. This application stands allowed.
