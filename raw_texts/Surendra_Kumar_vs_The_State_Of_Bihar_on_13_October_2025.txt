10. Section 12 of the Juvenile Justice (Care & Protection of Children) Act, 2015 reads as follows:-
"12. Bail to a person who is apparently a child alleged to be in conflict with law. (1)
When any person, who is apparently a child and is alleged to have committed a
bailable or non-bailable offence, is apprehended or detained by the police or appears
or brought before a Board, such person shall, notwithstanding anything contained in
the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) or in any other law for the time
being in force, be released on bail with or without surety or placed under the
supervision of a probation officer or under the care of any fit person:
Provided that such person shall not be so released if there appears reasonable
grounds for believing that the release is likely to bring that person into association
with any known criminal or expose the said person to moral, physical or
psychological danger or the persons release would defeat the ends of justice, and the
Board shall record the reasons for denying the bail and circumstances that led to such
a decision.
(2) When such person having been apprehended is not released on bail under
sub-section (1) by the officer-in-charge of the police station, such officer shall cause
the person to be kept only in an observation home 1[or a place of safety, as the case
may be] in Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2255 of 2025 dt.13-10-2025 such
manner as may be prescribed until the person can be brought before a Board.

Surendra Kumar vs The State Of Bihar on 13 October, 2025
(3) When such person is not released on bail under sub-section (1) by the Board, it
shall make an order sending him to an observation home or a place of safety, as the
case may be, for such period during the pendency of the inquiry regarding the person,
as may be specified in the order.
(4) When a child in conflict with law is unable to fulfil the conditions of bail order
within seven days of the bail order, such child shall be produced before the Board for
modification of the conditions of bail."
11. This Court is of the view that the provision of Section 12 of the said Act relating to bail shall be
taken into consideration, notwithstanding anything contained in the of the Bharatiya Nagarik
Suraksha Sanhita, 2023, in the touchstone of the principle of presumption of innocence of the child.
Thus, granting bail to a child in conflict with law is the rule and refusal is an exception.
12. This Court finds that in the case of Lalu Kumar @ Lal Babu @ Lallu vs The State of Bihar
reported in 2019 (4) PLJR 833, the Court has held that the gravity and nature of the offence are
immaterial for consideration of bail under the Act of 2015 and general principles as stated under
Section 3 of the Act of 2015 have to be followed.
13. Having heard the submissions made by the Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2255 of 2025
dt.13-10-2025 learned counsel for the parties and having perused the materials available on record
and considering the undertaking filed by the father of the appellant coupled with the fact that the
present case is not covered by the proviso of Section 12 of the J.J. Act, it appears that the order
dated 03.05.2025 is not justified in law.
14. Considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case and the period of custody
undergone by the appellant, this Court is inclined to allow this appeal.
15. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and order dated 03.05.2025 passed by learned District and
Additional Session Judge First-cum- Special Judge (Children's Court), Araria, is hereby set aside.
16. Let the appellant be released on bail on furnishing bail bonds of Rs. 15,000/- (Rupees Fifteen
Thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of Court below/concerned
Court in connection with Juvenile Justice Board Case No. 133 of 2024 arising out of Jogbani P.S.
Case No. 233 of 2024, subject to the following conditions:
(I) The first bailor must be the father of the appellant.
(II) The second bailor would be the recognized member of the Panchayat or the
reputed person of the village.
(III) The appellant shall remain present before the Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ)
No.2255 of 2025 dt.13-10-2025 appellate court as well as the J.J. Board as and when
required.
