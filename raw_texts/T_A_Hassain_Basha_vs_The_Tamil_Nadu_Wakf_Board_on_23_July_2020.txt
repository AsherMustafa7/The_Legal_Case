5. It is settled position that the District Registrar cannot decide the title of the property. However, to
ascertain whether the property is Wakf property or not he can conduct an enquiry. In such view of
the matter, I direct the 2nd respondent to conduct an enquiry to find out whether the property
sought to be registered by the 5th respondent is a Wakf property and in the case of the 2nd
respondent comes to the conclusion that the property is a Wakf property, in such case, the remedy
open to the petitioner is to approach the Wakf Tribunal. In the case of the District Registrar finding
that the property sought to be registered is not a Wakf property, in such case, he may register the
document, if it is otherwise in order. http://www.judis.nic.in With these observations, the Writ
Petition is disposed of. No costs. Consequently, the connected Miscellaneous Petition is closed.
