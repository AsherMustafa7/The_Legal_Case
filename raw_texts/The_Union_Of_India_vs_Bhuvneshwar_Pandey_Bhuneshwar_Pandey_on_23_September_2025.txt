2. The brief facts giving rise to the present writ
application is that on 05.04.1983 the respondent was engaged as
casual labour in the Postal Department at Saran Division and
Patna High Court CWJC No.12532 of 2024 dt.23-09-2025
2/8
was granted temporary status w.e.f. 29.11.1989, vide memo
dated 28.11.1991. After completion of three years in temporary
status, vide memo dated 12.05.1993 he was ordered to be
treated at par with Temporary Group-D employee w.e.f.
01.12.1992
. The Government of India (Ministry of Communication) took a policy decision vide notification
dated 23.01.2002 that 25% of sanctioned vacancy of Group D cadre will be filled from Temporary
Status Casual Labour on seniority basis and a seniority list of Temporary Status Casual Labour of
Saran Division was accordingly prepared. The temporary status casual labourers were to be
regularised on the recommendation of the Departmental Promotion Committee (DPC) against 25%
of approved vacancy of Group D cadre as per the prepared seniority list. On the basis of the seniority
list the DPC had regularised some of the temporary workers, however the respondent herein was
never regularised. On 31.01.2010, the respondent superannuated on attaining the age of 60 years
without regularisation of his services, and did not receive any pension or retiral benefits.
3. The learned Central Administrative Tribunal on the basis of the materials available on record and
considering the facts and circumstances of the case, allowed the OA filed by the Patna High Court
CWJC No.12532 of 2024 dt.23-09-2025 respondent and held that denial of pension and all
pensionary benefits to the respondent only for the reason of non- regularisation is not justifiable
and directed the authorities to pay the respondent pension and all other pensionary and retiral
benefits as per pay-scale, basic pay drawn preceding superannuation and calculating the qualifying
service as per Rules / norms. The learned tribunal relied on the G.1. Dept. of Posts, Lr
No.66-9/91-SPB, I, dated the 30th November, 1992, where the benefits which a casual labourer is
entitled to on completion of three years of service is stated, which included the pension and other
retirement benefits.
4. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that since the respondent herein had retired
before regularisation of his service, he was not entitled for retiral benefits except CGEGIS as per the
rules. And the said CGEGIS amount has already been sanctioned and paid to him along with his
GPF contribution with admissible interest.

5. The respondent was working in the Department of Posts continuously since the year 1983, and
was granted temporary status by the department in the year 1991 with effect from the year 1989.
After the respondent was given temporary status, he was to be regularised and given benefits as
prescribed Patna High Court CWJC No.12532 of 2024 dt.23-09-2025 in the G.1. Dept. of Posts, Lr
No.66-9/91-SPB, I, dated the 30th November, 1992. The relevant clause of the said letter is
reproduced as under:
"(iii) Benefits to casual labourers on completion of three years' service in temporary
status - In their judgment, dated 29-11-1989, the Hon'ble Supreme Court have held
that after rendering three years of continuous service with temporary status, the
casual labourers shall be treated at par with temporary Group 'D' employees of the
Department of Posts and would thereby be entitled to such benefits as are admissible
to Group 'D' employees on regular basis.
2. In compliance with the above-said directive of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, it has been decided
that the casual labourers of this department conferred with temporary status as per the scheme
circulated in the above-said circular No. 45-95/87-SPB. I, dated 12-4- 1991, be treated at par with
temporary Group 'D' employees with effect from the date they complete three years of service in the
newly acquired temporary status as per the above-said scheme. From that date, they will be entitled
to benefits admissible to temporary Group 'D' employees such as-
(1) All kinds of leave admissible to temporary employees;
(2) Holidays as admissible to regular employees; (3) Counting of service for the
purpose of pension and terminal benefits as in the case of temporary employees
appointed on regular basis for those temporary employees who are given temporary
status and who Patna High Court CWJC No.12532 of 2024 dt.23-09-2025 complete
three years of service in that status while granting them pension and retirement
benefits after their regularization;
(4) Central Government Employees' Insurance Scheme; (5) General Provident Fund;
(6) Medical Aid;
(7) Leave Travel Concession;
(8) All advances admissible to temporary Group 'D' employees;
(9) Bonus.
3. Further action may be taken accordingly and proper service record of such employees may also be
maintained.
[G.1. Dept. of Posts, Lr No.66-9-91-SPB, I, dated the 30th November, 1992]"

6. The letter referred above dated 30.11.1992, clearly mentions that in compliance of
the directives of Hon'ble Supreme Court, the Department took a conscious decision
that casual labourers conferred with temporary status to be treated at par with the
temporary would be employees w.e.f. the date they complete 3 years of service in the
temporary status and further to be entitled for all such benefits admissible to the
temporary Group-D employees. The said clause of the above referred letter further
mentions about the nature of service benefits to be extended to such employees,
which includes pension and Patna High Court CWJC No.12532 of 2024
dt.23-09-2025 retirement benefits besides leave, insurance scheme, GPF, etc.
7. It could be further relevant to clarify, the said letter no where says that order of
regularisation is a condition precedent for extending such benefits, including
pensionary and retirement benefits. By virtue of clause 2 of the said letter, such
casual labourers conferred with temporary status necessarily acquires status of
temporary Group-D employees after completion of qualifying period of service, i.e.,
three years and to be entitled for all such service benefits admissible to temporary
Group D employees. Therefore, once they acquire status at par with temporary
Group-D employees, by virtue of policy decision of the Department itself, the formal
order of regularisation in respect to such employees, if not issued cannot create any
such impediment, in respect of entitlement of getting pensionary and other
retirement benefits.
8. In terms of the above referred letter, entitlement of pension and other retirement
benefits is to be guided by acquiring the temporary status, and completion of three
years of service, therefore, the formal order of regularisation does not have any
element of decision to be taken by the administrative department which might have
any bearing upon the entitlement of such employees like the respondent.
Patna High Court CWJC No.12532 of 2024 dt.23-09-2025
9. In the given set of facts, if order of regularisation has not been issued in respect of
the respondent, it is nothing but inaction on the part of petitioners, for which the
respondent should not be allowed to suffer. At no point of time either before the
learned Central Administrative Tribunal or this court, the petitioners have disputed
the fact that the respondent was initially engaged as casual labourer, and was
subsequently granted temporary status of Grade D employee, and had completed
three years of service in the newly acquired temporary status as per the scheme of the
Department.
10. The respondent has been serving in the department since the year 1983, was
given temporary status w.e.f. 1989, and was treated on par with Group D employees,
from the year 1992 vide memo dated 12.05.1993. For almost twenty years, no
decision was taken on his regularisation by the concerned authorities. Clearly, the
respondent continued to give his uninterrupted services to the department, however,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127263160/ 4
The Union Of India vs Bhuvneshwar Pandey @ Bhuneshwar Pandey on 23 September, 2025
the department failed to take a decision on his regularisation. The respondent ought
to have been regularised as per the G.1. Dept. of Posts, Lr No.66-9/91-SPB, I, dated
the 30th November, 1992. As such, the regularisation was not done at fault of the
Department of Posts, and the respondent could not be asked to Patna High Court
CWJC No.12532 of 2024 dt.23-09-2025 face consequences of the inaction of the
department.
11. Therefore, after almost 27 years of uninterrupted service, which includes almost
20 years on temporary status, the respondent is entitled for pensionary and retiral
benefits, and the learned tribunal had rightly allowed the application of the
respondents.
12. In light of the facts and materials available on record, and the discussions made
above, we find that the order passed by the learned Tribunal does not suffer from any
illegality or perversity.
13. The impugned order of the Central Administrative Tribunal dated 08.02.2024 is
affirmed.
14. Accordingly, the writ application stands dismissed.
15. Interlocutory application, if any, shall also stand disposed of.
