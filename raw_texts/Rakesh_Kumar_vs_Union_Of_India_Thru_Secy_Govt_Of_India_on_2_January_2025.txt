3. Briefly stated, the facts of the case are that on 27.03.2009, the petitioner was dispatched by
Artillery Centre, Nasik Road, Camp to 133 Medium Regiment but he did not report for duty to unit
till 11.02.2011. A Court of Inquiry was held on 25.10.2011 in which the following tentative charge
was framed against the petitioner: -
"TENTATIVE CHARGE SHEET The accused No. 15165704Y Gunner (General Duty)
Rakesh Kumar Ramnagina of 333/133 Medium Regiment is charged with: -
DESERTING THE SERVICE ARMY ACT SECTION 38(1) In that he, at Nasik, on 27

Regiment did not report for duty to the unit (133 Medium Regiment) but absented
himself without leave till he voluntarily reported to the unit on 18 February 2011 at
1430h."
4. The charge against the petitioner was readout and explained to him. Three prosecution witnesses
were examined on support of the charges. On 20.04.2012, a notice was issued to the petitioner
stating that based on the summary of evidence recorded in his case, it had been decided to hold
Summary Court Martial. The petitioner was directed to give the name of a person of his choice who
would act as friend of the accused (petitioner). A charge-sheet containing the following two charges
was prepared on the same day: -

Ramnagina of 133 Medium Regiment is charged with: -
First Charge DESERTING THE SERVICE ARMY ACT SECTION 38(1) In that he at

despatched by Artillery Centre to report to 133 Medium Regiment, absented himself

hours."
5. On 20.04.2012 itself, the petitioner named Captain K. Surender to act as his friend in the
Summary Court Martial in his case. On 21.04.2012, a notice was issued regarding proceedings of
Summary Court Martial to be held on 27.04.2012. The petitioner was medically examined and was
found medically fit to undergo Summary Court Martial on 27.04.2012. A copy of the charge-sheet
dated 20.04.2012 was provided to the petitioner on 23.04.2012. During the court martial
proceedings held on 27.04.2012, the petitioner was accompanied by his friend Captain K. Surender.
The summary court martial was held by Colonel Sanjay Ahuja who also acted as interpreter for the
petitioner. The charge-sheet was read, translated and explained to the petitioner by Colonel Sanjay
Ahuja. The petitioner pleaded guilty of both the charges. The interpreter Colonel Sanjay Ahuja as
well as the petitioner himself certified that before recording the plea of guilty, the court explained to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/50686082/ 2
Rakesh Kumar vs Union Of India Thru. Secy. Govt. Of India ... on 2 January, 2025
the petitioner the charges leveled against him to which he had pleaded guilty and ascertained that
the petitioner understood the nature of the charges to which he had pleaded guilty. The court also
informed the petitioner the general effect of the plea of guilt and the difference in procedure which
will be followed consequent to the said plea. The court had satisfied itself that the petitioner
understood the charges and the effect of his pleading guilty. Thus the provisions of Army Rule 115(2)
were complied with. The summary of evidence was also read (translated) and explained to the
petitioner. The petitioner stated that he had committed a mistake and he wanted to serve in the
Army. He stated that he did not want to call any witness.
6. Taking all the aforesaid maters into consideration, the court martial sentenced the petitioner to
be dismissed from service by means of an order passed on 27.04.2012 itself.
7. The petitioner filed an appeal against the order of dismissal on the following grounds :-
(a) That no Court of Inquiry (C of 1) was held in accordance with the provisions of
Army Act Section 106, immediately after thirty days.
(b) That the provisions of Army Rules 22 and 23 were not complied with. The
Commanding Officer (CO) though heard the charges in his presence, he was not
given liberty to cross-examine any witness against him and to call such witness and to
make such statement as was necessary for his defence. The CO did not record any
statement given by the petitioner and the witnesses.
(c) That when the petitioner surrendered voluntarily on 18 Feb 2011, the CO gave him
charge-sheet under Army Act Section 38(1). Since the petitioner had surrendered
voluntarily, the absence between 27 March 2009 to 18 February 2011 should have
been treated as 'Absent without Leave' under Army Act Section 39(a), as held by AFT
(PB), Delhi in the case of Pradeep Kumar Singh.
(d) That the petitioner was not given charge-sheet and Summary of Evidence (S of E).
His signatures were forcibly obtained on blank papers and thereafter the contents of
certificates and SCM proceedings were drafted on same. He was not informed why he
was made to sign on blank papers. Provisions of Army Rules 33(7) and 34 were not
complied with.
(e) That the provision of Army Rule 129 was not complied with as he was not
provided with services of 'Friend of the Accused' of his choice. The Captain K.
Surender given by the CO as his friend of accused to defend his case, did not help
him.
(f) That the provisions of Army Rule 115(2) were not complied with.
(g) That the petitioner was forced to give a confessional statement under duress.
Therefore, the same was not admissible.

8. The appellate authority i.e. Chief of the Army Staff dealt with each of the grounds raised by the
petitioner in his appeal and dismissed the appeal by means of an order dated 27.01.2017. The
petitioner challenged the punishment order and the appellate order by filing an Original Application
before Armed Forces Tribunal which too has been dismissed. All the aforesaid orders are under
challenge before this Court.
9. Assailing validity of the aforesaid orders, the learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that
a copy of the charge-sheet was not provided to the petitioner and the petitioner was made to put his
signatures on blank papers in acknowledgment of the charge-sheet. This contention made on behalf
of the petitioner appears to be based on a blatant lie, as the proceedings of the summary court
martial are recorded on a number of pages and the petitioner has signed on all the pages at the
appropriate designated places. His signatures in acknowledgment of receipt of a copy of the
charge-sheet and the summary of evidence, are also made at the appropriate designated place. The
signatures do not appear to have been obtained on a blank paper.
10. Section 114 of the Evidence Act provides that "the Court may presume the existence of any fact
which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural event,
human conduct and public and private business, in their relation to the facts and particular case'.
Illustration (e) appended to Section 114 of the Evidence Act specifically provides that the court may
presume that the judicial and official Acts have been regularly performed. Therefore, there is a legal
presumption in favour of the correctness of the acknowledgment of the receipt of charge-sheet and
summary of evidence made by the petitioner. The petitioner cannot be allowed to assail correctness
of the acknowledgment of the receipt made by himself.
11. Even otherwise, while exercising the power of judicial review, this Court cannot entertain the
factual disputes raised by the petitioner which cannot be decided on the basis of material available
on record. Therefore, the aforesaid submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner lacks merit
and the same is turned down.
12. The learned counsel for the petitioner next submitted that the order of punishment was passed
in violation of the mandatory provision contained in Rule 34(1) of the Army Rules, 1954. In support
of this contention, learned counsel for the petitioner has relied upon a decision of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Union of India and others versus A.K. Pandey: 2009 (10) SCC 552.
13. Rule 34(1) of the Army Rules, 1954 provides as follows :-
"34. Warning of accused for trial.--(1) The accused before he is arraigned shall be
informed by an officer of every charge for which he is to be tried and also that, on his
giving the names of witnesses or whom he desired to call in his defence, reasonable
steps will be taken for procuring their attendance, and those steps shall be taken
accordingly.
The interval between his being so informed and his arraignment shall not be less than
ninety-six hours or where the accused person is on active service less than

Rakesh Kumar vs Union Of India Thru. Secy. Govt. Of India ... on 2 January, 2025
twenty-four hours.
(2) The officer at the time of so informing the accused shall give him a copy of the
charge-sheet and shall if necessary, read and explain to him the charges brought
against him. If the accused desires to have it in a language which he understands, a
translation thereof shall also be given to him.
(3) The officer shall also deliver to the accused a list of the names, rank and corps (if
any), of the officers who are to form the court, and where officers in waiting are
named, also of those officers in courts-martial other than summary courts-martial.
(4) If it appears to the court that the accused is liable to be prejudiced at his trial by
any non-compliance with this rule, the court shall take steps and, if necessary,
adjourn to avoid the accused being so prejudiced."
14. As per the material placed on record by the petitioner himself, a copy of the charge-sheet was
supplied to him on 23.04.2012. He was given opportunity to produce the witnesses but he declined
to produce any witness. He pleaded guilty of both the charges leveled against him and he was
arraigned on 27.04.2012. Therefore, the punishment order was passed not earlier than 96 hours
since a copy of the charge-sheet was supplied to the petitioner. There is no violation of the
provisions of Rule 34(1) in the present case and the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme court in
A.K. Pandey (Supra) has been followed while passing the punishment order.
15. No other point was pressed by learned counsel for the petitioner.
16. In view of the foregoing discussion, we are of the considered opinion that the punishment order,
the appellate order and the order passed by the Armed Forces Tribunal affirming those orders, do
not suffer from any illegality warranting interference by this Court.
17. The writ petition lacks merit and the same is dismissed.
