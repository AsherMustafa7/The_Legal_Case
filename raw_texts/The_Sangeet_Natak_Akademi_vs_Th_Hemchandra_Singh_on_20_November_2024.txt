HON'BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. SIDDHARTH MRIDUL HON'BLE MRS. JUSTICE GOLMEI
GAIPHULSHILLU KABUI For the appellants : Mr. Sarvan Kumar, Advocate For the respondents :
Mr. HS. Paonam, Sr. Advocate Date of hearing : 23.10.2024 Date of order : 20.11.2024 JUDGMENT
& ORDER (CAV) (Golmei Gaiphullshilu, J) [1] Heard Mr. Sarvan Kumar, learned counsel appearing
on behalf of the appellants and Mr. HS. Paonam, learned sr. counsel appearing on behalf of the
respondents.
[2] The present writ appeal has been filed by the State Appellants under Rule 3(2) of Chapter IV-A
read with Chapter-VII of the Manipur High Court Rules, 2019 against the impugned Judgment and
Order dated 07.07.2023 passed in WP(C) No. 372 of 2022 by the Hon'ble Single Judge with the
following prayer:
(i) to allow this Writ Appeal and set aside, reverse or revise the impugned judgment
dated 07.07.2023;
(ii) to grant interim stay on the impugned judgment dated 07.07.2023 in WP(C) No.
372 of 2022.
(iii) to pass any other or further order or direction as may be deemed fit and proper
on the facts and in the circumstances of this case in the interest of justice.
Writ Appeal no. 117 of 2023 Page 2
[3] The above referred to W.P.(C) No. 372 of 2022 was
filed by the respondents/petitioners to quash the impugned order dated 17.05.2022
passed by the second respondent/appellant no. 2 and to direct the appellants to
consider the case of the respondents/petitioners for regularization against the
available vacancy of Dancer in the Jawaharlal Nehru Manipur Dance Academy
(JNMDA).
[4] The case of the respondents/petitioners is that they were initially engaged as
Artiste/Guru/Dancer in JNMDA on consolidated pay and thereafter, they were engaged as contract
Dancer on the recommendation of the Selection Committee with the prescribed pay scale of Dancer.
The respondents have been associated with the JNMDA for more than 20 years. However, without
considering the factual position, the second appellant issued the impugned order rejecting the claim
of the respondents for regularization to the post of Dancer. Challenging the same, the respondents
filed the above referred WP(C) No. 372 of 2022.
[5] According to the learned counsel for the respondents, they have been engaged in JNMDA for the
last about more than 20 years as Artiste/Guru/Dancer in the JNMDA without any break and
admittedly possess the requisite qualification for the said post. Even though the
respondents/petitioners were engaged on contract basis, they were during the entire relevant period
rendering service of regular Writ Appeal no. 117 of 2023 Page 3 Dancers in JNMDA. In recognition
of their service, the respondents have been allowed to enjoy the regular pay scale and not
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/197331511/ 2
The Sangeet Natak Akademi vs Th. Hemchandra Singh on 20 November, 2024
consolidated pay, on the recommendation of the Selection Committee since February, 2010 with the
approval of the competent authority. The respondents are continuing against the vacant post
without any complaint from any quarter. It is further submitted that when the term of the contract
engagement of the respondents was about to expire and owing to non- availability of Chairman of
the Academy and the Advisory Board which was not functional at the time and also apprehending
that there may be an issue in the extension of the contract engagement, the respondents filed WP(C)
No. 74 of 2022 before this Court, seeking a direction to consider their case for regularization against
the available vacancy of Dancer coupled with a prayer not to oust them from service. It would
further be submitted that vide order dated 31.01.2022, this Court disposed of the said writ petition
with a direction to the respondents to consider upon receipt of the representation the respondents'
case and further the appellants were directed to dispose of the said representation by giving
personal opportunity. In the said order, it was also directed not to oust the respondents from service
pending consideration of the representation.
Operative portion of the order dated 31.01.2022 passed in WP(C) No. 74 of 2022 reads as follows;
Writ Appeal no. 117 of 2023 Page 4 "[7] .... Therefore, without going into the merits and demerits of
the petitioners' case, I am inclined to pass the following orders:
(a) This writ petition is disposed of.
(b) The petitioners are directed to give appropriate representation to the respondents
within a period of 2(two) weeks from the date of receipt of this order and on receipt
of the said representation, within the stipulated period of time, the respondent Nos. 1
& 2 are directed to dipose of the representation by giving personal opportunity and to
pass appropriate speaking orders.
(c) The said exercise shall be done within a period of 8 (eight) weeks from the date of
receipt of a copy of this order thereafter.
(d) Till such time, the respondents are directed not to oust the petitioners from their
service."
[6] The learned senior counsel for the respondents further submitted that pursuant to the direction
of this Court, on 04.03.2022, the respondents/petitioners have submitted a representation for
affording regularization to the post of Dancer. While so, without considering the factual position, the
second appellant issued the impugned order rejecting the claim of the petitioners. Drawing this
Court's attention to the orders dated 22.06.2028 in respect of some of the similarly situated
persons, the learned senior counsel submitted that in the case of some similarly situated persons,
who entered into service as Artists on consolidated basis and subsequently engaged on contract
basis with pay scale, were given regularization to the post of Dancer in the Academy. He further
submits that the respondents/petitioners are in great hope that their services will be regularized as
Dancer and the respondents have rendered half of their prime life in the role of
Artiste/Guru/Dancer in the Academy. Therefore, the case of the Writ Appeal no. 117 of 2023 Page 5
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/197331511/ 3
The Sangeet Natak Akademi vs Th. Hemchandra Singh on 20 November, 2024
respondents may be considered for regularization against the post held by them and such
consideration of the respondents would not involve any extra financial implication as they were
already enjoying the prescribed pay scale for the post. While stating that there is necessity of service
of the respondents in their letter addressed to the Secretary, Sangeet Natak Akademi, New Delhi, the
appellants have not extended the service of the respondents after 17.05.2022 for the reason of
approaching this Court seeking for regularization of their service in mala fide exercise of service. He
further submits that non-consideration of the respondents against the existing vacancy of Dancer
held by them while considering the case of other four Dancers would amount to violation of the
rights guaranteed under Article 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India and the non-regularization of
the respondents' service after rendering more than 20 years of service would be inhuman and the
same may amount to exploitation. [7] However, the learned counsel for the appellants submitted
that the duty of the Dancer is to perform on the stage and the performer has to be full of energy so
that he/she can give his/her best. As per the Recruitment Rules, the posts are filled up through
contractual engagement and their engagement is upto the age of 40 years, which can be extended
upto 6 years. In the above referred case, the respondents were engaged according to the provisions
of the Writ Appeal no. 117 of 2023 Page 6 Recruitment Rules and their contractual engagement
should have been discontinued as soon as they attain the age of prescribed in the Recruitment Rules,
but due to ongoing dance/drama productions, their contractual period extended from time to time.
He further submits that as per the provisions of the Recruitment Rules of Dancers, respondent
authorities cannot appoint a regular incumbent against the posts. Hence, the prayer of the
respondents for regularization of their services will be in violation of the provisions of the
Recruitment Rules and the judgment of Apex Court in the case of State of Karnataka v. Umadevi (3)
report in (2006) 4 SCC 1. Thus, a prayer to dismiss the writ petition was made.
[8] The grievances of the respondents is that the second appellant issued the impugned order
without considering the fact that the respondents are continuing in the post and enjoying the
prescribed pay scale for the post and have rendered half of their prime life in the role of
Artiste/Dancer in JNMDA. Therefore, it would be just and proper to consider the case of the
respondents for regularization against the post held by them at present. On the other hand, the plea
of the appellants is that the engagement of respondents was purely on contract basis and for a
specific period. As per the provisions of the Recruitment Rules, the appellant authorities cannot
appoint a regular incumbent against the post. Therefore, the prayer of the respondents Writ Appeal
no. 117 of 2023 Page 7 for regularization of their services will be in violation of the provisions of the
Recruitment Rules and the Judgment of the Apex Court in the case of State of Karnataka vs
Umadevi (3) reported in (2006) 4 SCC
1. It is also the say of the appellants that there is no rule to regularize the services of the respondents
and if the respondents are regularized, then the other employees will also claim the same benefit.
Therefore, the respondents are not entitled to regularization. [9] Pursuant to the direction of this
Court in W.P. (C) No.74 of 2022, the petitioners have submitted their representation on 4.3.2022 to
the Director, JNMDA, Imphal. Thereafter, on 28.3.2022, the Director, JNMDA, Imphal addressed a
letter to the Deputy Secretary, Sangeet Natak Akademi, New Delhi, requesting to intimate further
action to be taken up for compliance of the order of this Court for issuance of speaking order and
approval for extension of their contract service from 1.2.2022 till the date of issuance of speaking

The Sangeet Natak Akademi vs Th. Hemchandra Singh on 20 November, 2024
order. On 17.5.2022, the second appellant issued the impugned order rejecting the claim of the
respondents by referring the decision of the Apex Court in Umadevi (3), supra, wherein it has been
held that when a person enters a temporary employment or gets engagement as a contractual or
casual worker and the engagement is not based on a proper selection as recognized by the relevant
rules or procedure, he is aware of the consequences of the appointment being temporary, casual
Writ Appeal no. 117 of 2023 Page 8 or contractual in nature. Such a person cannot invoke the theory
of legitimate expectation for being confirmed in the post. [10] The plea of the respondents is that
similarly situated persons, who entered service as Artiste on consolidated basis and subsequently
engaged on contract basis with pay scale, were given regularization to the post of Dancer in the
JNMDA. In support, the learned senior counsel for the respondents drew the attention of the Court
to the orders dated 22.6.2018 passed by the Director, JNMDA in respect of O. Debola Devi; P. Bilash
Singh; Thounaojam Parul Devi and Oinam Jiten Singh.
Operative portions of order dated 22.06.2018 are as follows;

Writ Appeal no. 117 of 2023 Page 10
[11] The learned senior counsel for the respondents submits
that there are adequate numbers of vacancies in the grade of Dancer/Artiste in
JNMDA, Imphal and, thus, consideration of the respondents against such vacancies
would be an act of fairness which also would redress the grievances of the
respondents. Further, there is no legal impediment in any manner for excluding the
respondents from such consideration, but rather would be just, proper and
considerate judicious decision where the interest of any third party would not be
prejudiced.
[12] On 12.06.2024, learned counsel for the respondents submitted his written
argument/brief note of the case contending that as per the recruitment rules of
Dancer, a Dancer may be retained till the age of 40 years unless with the specific
approval of the Advisory Committee and the term of contract should be maximum for
a period of 6 years. However, all the respondents/petitioners were allowed to be
continued beyond 40 years of age and they have been serving as Dancer for more
than 20 years thereby showing that the said recruitment rules is not strictly enforced
in JNMDA. He further mentioned that it is the stand of the Appellants that there are
no regular sanctioned post of Dancer in JNMDA and all the posts of Dancers are
contractual posts. However, as per the decision of the Advisory Committee meeting
held on 11.12.20217, the service of 1) Writ Appeal no. 117 of 2023 Page 11 Smt. Oinam
Debola Devi, Dancer; Shri P. Bilash Singh, Dancer; 3) Thounaojam Parul Devi,
Dancer; and 4) Oinam Jiten were regularized w.e.f 10.05.20218 vide order dated
22.06.2018. Thus, it is seen that Dancers are given regularization in JNMDA with the
approval of the Advisory Committee. However, in the case of the
respondents/petitioners, Appellants are adopting a different yardstick which is
discriminatory in nature and thus liable to be interfered with from the ends of justice.
This factum is also admitted by the Appellants at para 27(v) of the Memo of Appeal
that "order dated 22.06.2018 was passed and the employees were regularized against
the vacant regular post not regularized on the post of contractual Dancers". Thus, it is
very clear that there are sanctioned post of Dancers in JNMDA against which the case
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/197331511/ 6
The Sangeet Natak Akademi vs Th. Hemchandra Singh on 20 November, 2024
of the respondents/petitioners can be considered for regularization as have been
done in the case of other similarly situation person vide order dated 22.06.2018.
Further, in reply to a RTI Application dated 05.04.2024 filed by the counsel for the
respondents/petitioners, the JNMDA has given information to the effect that there
are 14 no. of sanctioned posts of Dancer in JNMDA and 13 of the said posts are
presently occupied including by the present 4(four) respondents/petitioners. In
response to the query regarding whether there has been any instance where Dancer
in JNMDA continued till their respective superannuation from Writ Appeal no. 117 of
2023 Page 12 service, the JNMDA provided the names of A. Lakshmi Devi, S.
Noyonshakhi Devi and K. Binakumari Devi, N. Ajit Singh and R.K. Jayatisana Devi
meaning thereby they have retired as Dancer upon attaining the age of
superannuation and were given retirement benefits for the post of Dancer.
From the above facts and circumstances, it is clear that there are Dancers serving in
JNMDA beyond 40 years of age and they are allowed to continue till the age of
superannuation. Further, 4(four) persons who are similarly situated with the
respondents/petitioners and beyond 40 years of age were also regularized as Dancer
in JNMDA against the sanctioned post of Dancer. Therefore, the claim of the
Appellants that there is no sanctioned post of Dancer in JNMDA against which the
respondents/petitioners could be considered for regularization is not sustainable.
Further mentioned that present petitioners are enjoying pay scale of Dancer even
though they are working on contract basis and upon regularization there may not be
any financial burden on the Appellant.
[13] On 15.10.2024, the learned counsel for the appellant submitted affidavit of the
Appellant against the brief note/written submission filed by the
respondents/petitioners stating that during the hearing on 21.08.2024 the
Respondent's Ld. counsel handed over the brief notes containing the reply to the RTI
application furnished by the Writ Appeal no. 117 of 2023 Page 13 JNMDA which is
not on record. The information provided in response to the RTI request by one of the
CPIOs of the appellants has led to some confusion for the Hon'ble Court.
Additionally, it appears to be inconsistent with the provisions of the appellant
department, and it contradicts the stance taken by the appellant in their arguments.
Further submitted that in the interest of justice, this Hon'ble court granted an
opportunity to the appellant counsel to take instructions and clarify on the contrary
view taken in the appeal with the RTI reply, for the same matter was adjourned.
Thereafter, the learned counsel for the appellant brought to the attention of the
concerned authority of the appellants the information furnished in RTI reply dated
30.04.2024. However, the concerned authority was surprised and unaware of this
response. As a result, they have decided to issue a show cause notice dated
28.08.2024 to the CPIO responsible for providing incomplete and inaccurate
information in the RTI reply dated 20.04.2024. He further submitted that the
Hon'ble Single Judge overlooked the critical submission made by the appellant that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/197331511/ 7
The Sangeet Natak Akademi vs Th. Hemchandra Singh on 20 November, 2024
the respondents/petitioners were engaged on a purely contractual basis or a specified
period. Granting the respondents/petitioners prayer for regularization would
constitute a breach of the Recruitment Rules (RRs) and contravene the binding
precedent established by the Apex court.

[14] After perusal of all the materials on record and after
hearing both the parties, Ld. Single Judge passed the impugned order dated
07.07.2023 in WP(C) No. 372 of 2022, relevant portion of the order reads as follows;
"26. In the result,
(a) The writ petition is disposed of.
(b) The impugned order dated 17.5.2022 passed by the first respondent is set aside.
(c) The respondent authorities are directed to consider the case of the petitioners for
regularization against the available vacancies of Dancer in the JNMDA in the light of
the orders dated 22.6.2018 issued by the Director, JNMDA and as per the relevant
rules.
(d) The aforesaid exercise is directed to be completed within a period of twelve weeks
from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
(e) There will be no order as to costs."
[15] Being aggrieved by the order dated 07.07.2023, the appellants has preferred the present appeal.
The appellants contended that the impugned decisions of the Single Judge was passed without
proper deliberation and without arguments, without reference to the Writ Appeal no. 117 of 2023
Page 16 crucial words of the rule and any citation of authority on law applicable to Autonomous
bodies like SNA and JNMDA and the Single Judge has committed a grave error in allowing the writ
petition, quashing the order dated 17.05.2022 and directed the appellant authorities to consider the
case of the respondents for regularization against the available vacancies of Dancer in the JNMDA,
whereas there is no regular post are available for the dancer in the light of the orders dated
22.06.2018 issued by the Director, JNMDA and as per the relevant rules; however, the order dated
22.06.2018 was passed to consider regularization for another available vacancy instead of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/197331511/ 9
The Sangeet Natak Akademi vs Th. Hemchandra Singh on 20 November, 2024
regularization for dancer available post and the aforesaid exercise is directed to be completed within
a period of twelve weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of the order and there will be no order as
to costs. [16] The learned counsel for the appellant further submits that JNMDA is a constituent unit
of Sangeet Natak Akademi (SNA), and SNA is an autonomous body under Ministry of Culture
Government of India, and 100% financed by the GOI through Grant-in-Aid from Public Fund. Pay &
Allowances and terminal/retirement/pensionary benefits to the staff of SNA and its constituent
units who are working against the regular sanction posts are being paid from the fund released from
the Ministry of Culture. Contractual Posts like contractual post of Dancer in JNMDA do not come
under regular sanctioned posts and no fund is Writ Appeal no. 117 of 2023 Page 17 released from the
Ministry of Culture Government of India for such posts on account of
terminal/retirement/pensioner benefits. Hence, the directions of the Hon'ble High Court for
consideration of their regularization on contractual basis cannot be acceded.
In support of his case, the appellant relied upon the following judgment:
1. (2015) 5 SCC 333 - [T.M. Sampath & Ors Vs. Secretary, M/O Water Resources &
Ors]
2. Municipal Corporation of Delhi Vs Gurnam Kaur.
3. A-One Granites Vs State of UP and Ors.
[17] It is seen and emerged that the initial engagement of the respondents/petitioners on
consolidated pay as Dancer was in the years of 1998, 2000 and 2002 respectively and thereafter in
the year 2010, they have been appointed as contract Dancer against the vacant post in the scale of
pay of Rs. 9300-34800 with GP Rs. 4200/- and other admissible allowances. Now the
respondents/petitioners are aged 52, 50, 44 and 53 respectively and under the hope that their
services will be regularized as Dancer in JNMDA, the petitioners have been performing their duties
to the satisfaction of all concerned. It is not the case of the appellants that the
respondents/petitioners are irregular and have not been performing their duties well. The
respondents/petitioners Writ Appeal no. 117 of 2023 Page 18 have rendered half of their prime life
in the role of Artiste/Dancer in the JNMDA.
[18] Further, it is also seen and emerged that similarly situated persons, who entered service as
Artiste on consolidated basis and subsequently engaged on contract basis with pay scale, were given
regularization to the post of Dancer in the JNMDA. In support, the learned senior counsel for the
respondents/petitioners drew the attention of the Court to the orders dated 22.06.2018 passed by
the Director, JNMDA in respect of O. Debola Devi; P. Bilash Singh; Thounaojam Parul Devi and
Oinam Jiten Singh.
[19] On perusal of the aforesaid four orders, it is seen and evident that the Director of JNMDA,
Imphal, had issued an order regularizing the services of O. Debola; P. Bilash Singh; Thounaojam
Parul Devi and Oinam Jiten Singh with effect from 10.05.2018 based on the decisions of the
Advisory Committee meeting held on 11.12.2027. [20] After going through the pleadings of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/197331511/ 10
The Sangeet Natak Akademi vs Th. Hemchandra Singh on 20 November, 2024
parties and after hearing both the learned counsel for the parties it is seen that the following are the
admitted position of fact and the same is extracted herein below;
1. The respondents/petitioners were initially engaged as Artiste/Guru/Dancer in JNMDA on
consolidated pay in the years 1998, 2000, 2001 and 2002;
Writ Appeal no. 117 of 2023 Page 19
2. Thereafter in the year 2010 on recommendation of the Selection Committee, they have been
appointed as contract Dancer against the vacant post in the scale of pay of Rs. 9300-34800 with GP
Rs. 4200/- and other admissible allowances;

[20] The Apex Court in the case of Umadevi (3) supra, held as under.
"53. One aspect needs to be clarified. There may be cases where Irregular
appointments (not illegal appointments) as explained In S.V.Narayanapa [(1967 2
SCR 128 AIR 1967 SC 1071], R.N.Nanjundappa [(1972) 1 SCC 409: (1972) 2 SCR 799]
and B.N.Nagarajan ((1979) 4 SCC 507: 1980 SCC (L&S) 4:
(1979) 3 SCR 937) and referred to in para 15 above, of duly qualified persons in duly
sanctioned vacant posts might have been made and the employees have continued to
work for t en years or more but without the intervention of orders of the courts or of
tribunals. The question of regularization of the services of such employees may have
to be considered on merits in the light of the principles settled by this Court in the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/197331511/ 11
The Sangeet Natak Akademi vs Th. Hemchandra Singh on 20 November, 2024
cases above referred to and in the light of this judgment.
Writ Appeal no. 117 of 2023 Page 21 In that context, the Union of India, the State
Governments and their instrumentalities should take steps to regularise as a one-
time measure, the services of such irregularly appointed, who have worked for ten years or more in
duly sanctioned posts but not under cover of orders of the courts or of tribunals and should further
ensure that regular recruitments are undertaken to fill those vacant sanctioned posts that require to
be filled up, in cases where temporary employees or daily wagers are being now employed. The
process must be set in motion within six months from this date. We also clarify that regularization,
if any already made, but not sub judice, need not be reopened based on this judgment, but there
should be no further bypassing of the constitutional requirement and regularising or making
permanent, those not duly appointed as per the constitutional scheme."
[21] In 2018 SCC Online SC 3860 [Ravi Verma & Ors vs Union of India & Ors] "13. In view of the
aforesaid decision, the circulars and regularization of the similarly situated employees at other
places and various recommendation that were made the services of the appellants ought to have
been regularized in the year 2006; discriminatory treatment have been meted out to them. As per
the decision of Uma Devi (Supra), they were entitled to regularization of services; they did not serve
under the cover of court's order. Illegality has been committed by not directing regularization of
services.
14. We direct that the services of the appellants be regularized w.e.f 1st July 2006 they are entitled to
consequential benefit also let the respondents comply with the order in a period of three months
from today."
[22] In 92024) SCC Online SC 2277 - [Ushaben Joshi vs Union of India & Ors] "17......... Keeping in
view the fact that an employee similarly placed but inducted in service after nearly six years from the
date of employment of the appellant with the respondent- Department has been conferred the
benefits of confirmation in service by way of appointment to the post of MTS, the appellant is
entitled to claim the same benefits."
Writ Appeal no. 117 of 2023 Page 22
[23] With due consideration to the facts and circumstances set
out by the parties and the admitted position of fact and law as has been highlighted and narrated
above and applying the ratio of the Apex Court as reproduced above, we are of the view that the case
of the appellants' contentions have no legs to stand on and instead the appellant authorities ought to
take steps to regularize the service of the respondents/petitioners.
[24] In the result there is no scope to interfere with the impugned order of the learned Single Judge
and appellants are directed to comply with the direction given by the learned Single Judge and to
take steps to comply with the direction made by the learned Single Judge within a period of 6 (six)
weeks.
