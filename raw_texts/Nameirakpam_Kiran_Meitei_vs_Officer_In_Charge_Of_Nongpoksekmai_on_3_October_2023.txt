Officer-in-charge of Nongpoksekmai Police Station and Another
...Respondents
With MC(Cril. Rev. P.) No. 11 of 2023 BEFORE HON'BLE THE ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE M.V.
MURALIDARAN 03.10.2023 [1] Heard Mr. Juno Rahman, learned counsel for the petitioner; Mr.
H. Samarjit, learned PP for the respondent No. 1 and Mr. W. Darakishwor, learned Sr. PCCG for the
respondent No. 2. [2] When the matter is taken up today, Mr. Juno Rahman, learned counsel for the
petitioner represented that when the petitioner/accused persons were surrendered before the
learned Court of Special Judge (SC& ST) POA, Thoubal, they have filed Cril. Misc. (B) Case No. 267
of 2023 under Section 437 Cr.P.C. seeking for bail. The said application was transferred to the
learned Special Judge (SC& ST) POA, Thoubal since the offences were registered under Section
153-A/398/427/436/448/302/354/364/326/376/34 & 376-D IPC, Section 25 (1-C) Arms Act and
Section 3(1)d, 3(1)e, 3(1)g, 3(1)w(i), 3(1)z, 3(2)(iii), 3(2)(iv) & 3 (2)(v) of SC & ST (PoA) Act, 1989;
Sec: 67 and 67-A IT Act (added) and particularly, under Section 3(1)d Page |2 of the SC & ST (PoA)
Act, 1989 has been registered. Therefore, it was transferred to learned Special Judge (SC& ST) POA,
Thoubal. [3] Considering his case under Section 439 Cr.P.C., the learned Judge by order dated
04.09.2023 dismissed the bail applications. Challenging the said bail application, the petitioner has
filed this Criminal Revision Petition by invoking the provision under Section 482 and 439 of Cr.P.C.
[4] On filing the said petition, the Registry numbered this Criminal Revision Petition as Criminal
Revision Petition No. 15 of 2023. Pending the Criminal Revision Petition No. 15 of 2023, MC(Cril.
Rev. P.) No. 11 of 2023 has been filed seeking bail for the petitioner. Therefore, he prayed this Court
to consider the bail application and grant bail to the petitioner.
[5] Mr. H. Samarjit, learned PP for the respondent No. 1 and Mr. W. Darakishwor, learned Sr.PCCG

for the respondent No. 2 CBI have represented that the respondent No. 2 has filed counter affidavit
and they are objecting for granting bail to the petitioner. [6] When the matter is taken up for
consideration, this Court came to know that when the petitioner filed the bail application U/S 439
Cr.P.C. in Cril. Misc. (B) Case No 271 of 2022 before the Learned Sessions Judge, Thoubal and the
same was dismissed, they ought to have filed bail application by invoking only 439 Cr.P.C. before
this Court. Instead of that, they filed the petition under section 482 Cr.P.C.
Page |3 and 439 Cr.P.C. in Criminal Revision Petition No. 15 of 2023 which is not at all
maintainable.
[7] The Registry also without looking into the case and the provisions has simply numbered the
Criminal Revision Petition No. 15 of 2023 filed by the petitioner under Section 482 and 439 Cr.P.C.
[8] It is an admitted fact that when the petitioner has filed Cril. Misc. (B) Case No 271 of 2022 before
the Learned Sessions Judge, Thoubal and when the same was transferred to the Court of Special
Judge (SC&ST), PoA, Thoubal and the learned Special Judge (SC&ST), PoA, Thoubal dismissed the
bail application on 04.09.2023, the petitioner ought to have filed bail application instead of filing
the Criminal Revision Petition. The provision under section 439 Cr.P.C. has given special power to
both the Learned Sessions Judge and the High Court to grant bail to the accused person. Therefore,
the petitioner ought to have filed the bail application under Section 439 Cr.P.C. Since the Criminal
Review Petition has been filed under Section 482 and 439 Cr.P.C., I am inclined to direct the
Registry to convert the Criminal Revision Petition No. 15 of 2023 into the regular bail application
under Section 439 Cr.P.C. and number the same and post the matter for Motion on 05.10.2023.
