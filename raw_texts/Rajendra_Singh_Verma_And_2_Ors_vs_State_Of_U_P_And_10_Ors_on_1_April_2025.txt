Rajendra Singh Verma And 2 Ors. vs State Of U.P. And 10 Ors. on 1 April, 2025
8. It appears that respondent Nos. 7 and 8 filed PIL No. 55998 of 2017 (Dharamvir
Singh and 11 others v. State of U.P. and 06 Others) alleging therein that Plot Nos. 160
and 161/1 belong to the Nagar Nigam Ghaziabad and have been illegally encroached
by petitioner Nos. 1 and 2.
9. The PIL aforesaid was disposed of by the order dated 1.12.2016, the relevant
portion of the said order is quoted hereinbelow:-
"Heard Mr. Anil Kumar Rai, learned counsel for the petitioners, Mr. Mahendra
Pratap, learned counsel for respondent no. 2, Mr. Ashok Kumar, learned Additional
Chief Standing Counsel for respondent nos. 1 and 3, and Mr. Anil Tiwari, learned
counsel for respondent nos. 4 and 5.
The petitioners, in the instant PIL, seek a direction to the respondent authorities to
take all steps for protecting the plots/land in question, owned by the Nagar Nigam,
Ghaziabad. Counsel appearing for respondent nos. 4 and 5, on instructions, submits
that if the concerned revenue authorities measure and demarcate the plots/land,
respondent nos. 4 and 5 are ready to remove the encroachments, if any, on the land
in question and, if necessary, with the help of police force. Counsel for respondent
nos. 1 and 3, on instructions, submits that respondent no.3 shall make the concerned
revenue staff available for measurement and demarcation of the land in question and
shall complete the work of measurement and demarcation within a period of four
weeks from the date of receipt of this order. The petitioners undertake to
communicate this order along with a copy of the writ petition and its annexures to
the District Magistrate, Ghaziabad within ten days from today. Counsel for
respondent nos. 4 and 5 submits that, after the work of demarcation is completed, the
said respondents shall remove the encroachment, if any, and, if necessary, with the
help of police force, within a period of four weeks therefrom. The submissions made
by learned counsel for the parties are recorded and accepted. In view thereof, we
direct the concerned authorities to act on the basis of the statements made by learned
counsel appearing on their behalf.
It is needless to mention that the concerned authorities shall issue notice to
respondent nos. 6 and 7 while carrying out the work of demarcation.
With these observations, the petition is disposed of."
10. It is the case of the petitioners that consequent to the directions in the PIL, a demarcation was
conducted and on the basis of demarcation report dated 28.08.2017 which report was incorrect and
illegal, the constructions of the petitioners were demolished. The demolitions were carried out on
16.10.2017 despite numerous objections having been filed by the petitioners.
11. It is vehemently submitted by learned counsel for the petitioners that the demarcation has been
conducted without any fixed points having been identified. The demarcation itself is stated to have
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/32062790/ 4
Rajendra Singh Verma And 2 Ors. vs State Of U.P. And 10 Ors. on 1 April, 2025
been done through "Total Station Survey Machine" which does not have any sanction of law.
12. After hearing learned counsel for the parties, this Court on 23.7.2024 passed the following order.
"1. Heard Shri Hari Om, for the petitioner, Shri P. K. Singh, learned counsel
appearing for respondent nos. 2, 5 and 6 as well Mr. Vinayak Ranjan (Advocate Roll
No. A/V 2137/23) holding brief of Mr. Kartikeya Saran, learned counsel for the
respondent no.3 and Mr. Ashok Pandey (Advocate Roll No. A/A 1369/12) holding
brief of Mr. Vishnu Singh, learned counsel for the respondent no.4.
2. Shri P. K. Singh, learned counsel appearing for respondent nos. 2, 5 and 6 seeks
time to obtain instructions and to file supplementary counter-affidavit addressing
therein some queries that have been raised by the Court during the course of hearing
namely as to the area over which constructions have been demolished consequent to
certain directions issued in a PIL and the total ownership of the respondents over
portion of plot nos. 161/1 and 161/2 and its area; the actual location of the
constructions in plot no. 161/1 and 161/2 which have been demolished. The status of
the balance area of the aforesaid plots, apart from the area claimed by the petitioners
shall also be specified.
3. Learned Standing Counsel is also directed to obtain instructions as regards the
manner of operation of a "Total Station Survey Machine" whereby demarcation is
alleged to having been carried out prior to demolition have been effected by the
respondents.
4. For the aforenoted purposes two weeks' time is granted to the respondents with
the stipulation that no further time shall be granted therefor.
5. List this petition for further hearing after two weeks, peremptorily, at the top of
list."
13. In pursuance of the order aforesaid, an affidavit has been filed by fourth respondent explaining
procedure for conducting the survey on the basis of "Total Station Survey Machine". Paragraph 9 of
this affidavit is extremely relevant. The same is quoted hereinbelow:-
"9. That in the present case, for demarcation of Khasra No. 160 and 161 of Village
Sihani, the Lekhpal informed about the boundary of Khasra No. 166 and Khasra No.
173 as fixed point and upon the basis of the same, the digitalized map was prepared
and super imposed and a survey sheet was prepared accordingly. A true photostate
copy of digital map is being annexed herewith and marked as Annexure No. A-4 to
this affidavit."
14. The stand of the respondents in the petition is that petitioners being encroachers and after
conducting a proper demarcation consequent to the directions issued in PIL No. 5598 of 2017, the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/32062790/ 5
Rajendra Singh Verma And 2 Ors. vs State Of U.P. And 10 Ors. on 1 April, 2025
offending constructions belonging to the petitioners who are encroachers were demolished and that
the demarcation have been carried out through Total Station Survey Machine.
15. From the averment quoted above, it is clear that the survey had been conducted taking the
boundary of two plots as fixed point. This is totally wrong, illegal and contrary to law in this regard.
The boundary between two plots can never be taken as fixed point. For this reason alone, the survey
on the basis of which demolition has been carried out consequent to the directions in the public
interest litigation is vitiated.
5. According and since, the demolition has been made on the basis of a survey which cannot be
accepted, this writ petition is liable to be allowed and is allowed with the following directions:
(a) The respondents are directed to deliver possession of plot nos. 161/1, 161/2 to the
petitioners in these petitions within a period of two weeks from today;
(b) It shall, however, be open to the respondents to proceed, afresh, against the
petitioners in case they so desire, after conducting a fresh survey to be conducted on
the basis of valid fixed points.
(c) Additionally, the relief in the writ petition is for payment of compensation for the
demolition effected against the petitioners. Since, the question of compensation
necessarily involves questions of fact, we do not deem it appropriate to pass any
orders in that regard, leaving it open to the petitioners to sue for damages in case so
advised.
6. This order shall also apply insofar as the petitioner in Writ C No. 8915 of 2018 is concerned, who
had purchased a portion of plot No. 161/2 from Duli Chand, its recorded tenure-holder.
