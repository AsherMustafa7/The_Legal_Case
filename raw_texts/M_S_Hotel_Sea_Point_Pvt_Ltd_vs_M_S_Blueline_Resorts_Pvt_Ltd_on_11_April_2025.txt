M/S Hotel Sea Point Pvt. Ltd vs M/S Blueline Resorts Pvt. Ltd on 11 April, 2025
the Respondent on the basis of breach of the Lease Agreement dated 01.05.2012.
Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK I. FACTUAL MATRIX OF THE CASE:
2. The Petitioner is a company which has taken on lease the land from one, Mr. Durga Charan
Rautray on which the hotel premises are located. The Opposite Party was desirous of taking the
hotel premises on lease and therefore, Lease Agreement dated 1.5.2012 was entered into between
the Petitioner and the Opposite Party. The Agreement dated 1.5.2012 was valid for a period of 10
years, further extendable by 10 years which would commence from 1.5.2012. Accordingly, monthly
rental was provided for in the Agreement dated 1.5.2012 itself which was payable during the entire
duration of the lease period. It is pertinent to mention here that the Lease Agreement was signed by
the parties on a Rs.100 stamp paper, and was not registered.
3. Disputes arose over non-payment of the rent as prescribed in the Agreement and therefore, the
Petitioner approached this Court for appointment of an Arbitrator u/s 11 of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act.
4. During the pendency of the Section 11 application, the Opposite Party filed C.S No. 598/2015
before the Civil Judge at Puri claiming specific performance and damages with respect to alleged
breach of Agreement dated 1.5.2012.
5. Meanwhile, vide order dated 5.11.2015, this Court was pleased to appoint the Ld. Sole Arbitrator
for adjudication of the dispute between the parties. Accordingly, the parties appeared before the Ld.
Arbitrator and filed their respective claim and counter claim.
Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK
6. At this juncture, the Petitioner filed an application before the Ld. Arbitrator praying for impound
of the Agreement dated 1.5.2012 and abeyance of proceedings as the said Agreement was not
sufficiently stamped nor registered as required in law.
7. The Ld. Arbitrator vide order dated 13.4.2017, rejected the prayer of impounding the Agreement
as prayed for by the Petitioner. Aggrieved, the Petitioner approached this Court in W.P.(C) No.
7893/2017 challenging the refusal order of the Ld. Arbitrator. This Court vide order dated 8.5.2017
in W.P.(C) No. 7893/2017 was pleased to direct the Ld. Arbitrator to impound the Agreement in line
with the Supreme Court's judgment in SMS Tea Estates (P) Ltd. v. Chandmari Tea Co. (P) Ltd1.
8. In compliance with this Court's order dated 8.5.2017 in W.P.(C) No. 7893/2017, the Ld.
Arbitrator vide order dated 20.7.2017 was pleased to impound the Agreement. However, the order
was passed ex-parte without hearing the Petitioner and the onus of payment of the deficit stamp
duty was placed on the Petitioner. This was challenged by the Petitioner before this Court, where it
was prayed that the onus be shifted to the Respondent who was liable to bear the same in terms of
the Agreement.

M/S Hotel Sea Point Pvt. Ltd vs M/S Blueline Resorts Pvt. Ltd on 11 April, 2025
9. Here, now, the litigation gets even more chequered. The Opposite Party did not bring the orders
of this Court with regards to the impounding to the attention of this Court and managed to secure an
order directing the Ld. Arbitrator to conclude the arbitration proceedings within 3 (2011) 14 SCC 66
Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK months. This was then challenged by the Petitioner,
and the same was stayed vide this Court's order dated 11.8.2017.
10.In the meanwhile, it is pertinent to note that the Petitioner had filed C.S. No. 462/2017 seeking
recovery of possession, mesne profits and damages from the Respondent alleging breach of the
Agreement dated 1.5.2012.
11.While the arbitration proceeding had hit a pause, the Parties were pursuing their respective Civil
Suits. Then, the Respondent filed an application under Section 8 of the A&C Act for reference of the
matter to the arbitrator even though its own Civil Suit was pending on 20.11.2017. Thereafter, the
Respondent sought to withdraw its C.S. No. 598/2018 seeking pursuing the arbitration under Order
23 Rule 1 CPC on 16.2.2018.
12.Pursuant to the order dated 15.1.2018, both the Civil Suits are directed to be heard analogously by
the Ld. Civil Judge, Sr. Div., Puri with the consent of both Parties. The application under Section 8
of the A&C Act is rejected by the Ld. Civil Judge, Sr. Div. ,Puri vide its order dated 17.5.2018.
13.Aggrieved, the Opposite Party approached this Court in W.P.(C) No.13136/2018 challenging the
rejection of its application under Section 8 of the A&C Act.
14.On 5.12.2019, the Opposite Party was permitted to withdraw its Civil Suit upon payment of cost
of Rs.500/- to the Petitioner.
15.In all this, the Opposite Party has consistently approached either this Court or the Ld. District
Judge seeking extension of time for passing an award in favour of the Ld. Sole Arbitrator. These
efforts culminated Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK finally in the Opposite Party's
application under Section 29A of the A&C Act in ARBP No.123/2017 which was rejected by the Ld.
District Judge, Puri for suppression of facts and forum hunting vide order dated 27.12.2021.
16.The same was challenged by the Opposite Party in W.P.(C) No. 3203/2022 before this Court.
However, this Court deemed it appropriate to decline to allow the application under Section 29A of
the A&C Act, it appears vide order dated 6.7.2022, this Court directed the Ld. Arbitrator to continue
the arbitration expeditiously.
17.Thereafter, the Ld. Arbitrator passed the impugned order purported to be an Award on 1.8.2022.
18.Aggrieved by the Impugned Order, the instant Petition has been preferred. As the facts leading
up to the instant Petition have been laid down, this Court shall endeavour to summarise the
contentions of the Parties and the broad grounds that have been raised to seek the exercise of this
Court's writ jurisdiction.

II. PETITIONER'S SUBMISSIONS:
19.The Ld. Counsel for the Petitioner Mr. Surendra Routray contends that there has been a complete
failure by the Ld. Sole Arbitrator in rendering the impugned order as the Lease Agreement on the
basis of which the impugned order was passed, or the arbitration was kickstarted still remained
unstamped and unregistered despite this Court's direction. Not to mention that the Ld. Arbitrator
had himself impounded the Agreement for being insufficiently stamped, and without the defect
Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK being cured, had surprisingly proceeded to pass the
Impugned Order. Insofar as the maintainability of the petition is concerned, it is urged by him that
the provisions of the Act cannot oust the jurisdiction of the High Courts and under Article 226 and
227. While the said power ought to be exercised sparingly, the jurisdiction of High Courts can not to
be ousted especially when there is a manifest error by the Arbitral Tribunal in which case, the High
Courts ought to exercise jurisdiction under Article 227.
20.Ld. Counsel for the Petitioner Mr. Routray referred to the judgments in Deep Industries Ltd. v.
Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd.2 and Bhaven Construction through Authorised Signatory
Premjibhai K. Shah v. Executive Engineer Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd.3. Relying upon the
judgment in Deep Industries (supra) his submission was that in the said case, also, the Supreme
Court categorically held that the jurisdiction of the writ court under Article 227 cannot be ousted.
III. OPPOSITE PARTY'S SUBMISSIONS:
21.On the other hand, Ld. Sr. Counsel Mr. D.P. Nanda appearing for the Opposite Party, submits
that the orders of an Arbitral Tribunal are not amenable to writ jurisdiction. It is further submitted
that if the parties have entered into an agreement to arbitrate their disputes, the court must decline
to exercise its extraordinary jurisdiction under the Constitution and leave the parties to avail the
remedies under the 2019 SCC OnLine SC 1602 (2022) 1 SCC 75 Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT,
CUTTACK special enactment which in itself is a self-contained code. The object of minimal judicial
intervention under the 1996 Act, will be defeated at the High Court exercises its jurisdiction under
Article 226 or 227 with any orders of the arbitral tribunal.
IV. ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION:
22.Having heard the parties and perused the materials available on record, this Court has identified
herein the following issues to be determined:
A. Whether this Court can exercise its writ jurisdiction to interfere with the
Impugned Order passed by the Ld. Sole Arbitrator?
B. Whether this Court ought to interfere with the Impugned Order?
V. ISSUE A: WHETHER THIS COURT CAN EXERCISE ITS' WRIT JURISDICTION
TO INTERFERE WITH THE IMPUGNED ORDER PASSED BY THE LD. SOLE
ARBITRATOR?

M/S Hotel Sea Point Pvt. Ltd vs M/S Blueline Resorts Pvt. Ltd on 11 April, 2025
23.In India, the maintainability of writ petitions in respect of arbitration matters presents a nuanced
legal challenge, requiring the balancing of the extraordinary powers of High Courts under Articles
226 and 227 of the Constitution of India with the objectives of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,
1996 (Arbitration Act). Section 5 of the Arbitration Act minimises judicial interference in arbitral
proceedings, confining intervention strictly to the circumstances outlined within the statute.
However, courts have frequently grappled with situations where exercising the writ powers was
deemed necessary to preserve the purity of justice. Over the years, landmark judgments have
delineated the scope of judicial intervention, affirming two fundamental principles: (i) Location:
ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK the writ jurisdiction of High Courts remains intact despite
Section 5 of the Arbitration Act; and (ii) its exercise must be limited to rare and exceptional cases,
such as those involving a manifest lack of jurisdiction, bad faith, or violations of natural justice
principles.
24.This question assumes greater importance as arbitration continues to gain prominence as an
alternative dispute resolution mechanism in India. While Arbitral Tribunals are afforded significant
autonomy to adjudicate disputes, judicial scrutiny is sometimes required to prevent the misuse of
arbitration proceedings or a miscarriage of justice. Recent rulings of the Apex Court have further
clarified the contours of this balance, emphasising that writ petitions should be entertained
sparingly and in line with the objective of the Arbitration Act and its quest for an efficient and
independent dispute resolution.
25.The extraordinary jurisdiction of High Courts in India, enshrined in Articles 226 and 227 of the
Constitution, serves as a foundation for protecting fundamental rights and administering justice.
Article 226 empowers High Courts to issue writs for the enforcement of fundamental rights, offering
a remedy against both legislative and executive actions. Article 227, on the other hand, confers every
High Court with supervisory powers over all courts and tribunals within the jurisdiction of such
High Court. Together, these articles establish a robust framework for judicial review, reinforcing the
rule of law and providing a mechanism to check the misuse of power.
26.The Arbitration Act establishes a robust legal framework designed to facilitate efficient dispute
resolution mechanism through arbitration.
Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK This landmark legislation was crafted to minimise
judicial intervention and enhance party autonomy, thereby aligning Indian arbitration practices
with international norms and expectations. Section 5 of the Arbitration Act embodies a fundamental
principle: courts are expressly prohibited from interfering in matters governed by the Arbitration
Act, except as explicitly stipulated within its framework. Through this provision, the legislature aims
to preserve the integrity of arbitration as a preferred dispute resolution mechanism, ensuring that
Arbitral Tribunals operate with the requisite independence to deliver fair and impartial awards. In
addition to defining the limits of judicial oversight, the Act encompasses provisions that further
reinforce the principle of minimal intervention. It grants arbitrators substantial discretion to
determine procedural issues and the scope of their jurisdiction.

27.In Fuerst Day Lawson Ltd. v. Jindal Exports Ltd.4, the Supreme Court of India characterised the
Arbitration Act as a comprehensive and specialised law designed to facilitate quick and efficient
dispute resolution through arbitration while reducing judicial interference.
28.One of the main objectives of the Arbitration Act is to minimise the supervisory role of Courts in
the arbitral process. Party autonomy and settlement of disputes by an Arbitral Tribunal are the
hallmarks of arbitration law. Section 5 gives effect to the true intention of the parties to have their
disputes resolved through arbitration in a quick, efficient and effective manner by minimising
judicial interference in the arbitral (2011) 8 SCC 333 Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK
proceedings5. Parliament enacted Section 5 to minimise the supervisory role of Courts in the
arbitral process to the bare minimum, and only to the extent "so provided" under the Part I of the
Arbitration Act. In doing so, the legislature did not altogether exclude the role of Courts or judicial
authorities in arbitral proceedings, but limited it to circumstances where the support of judicial
authorities is required for the successful implementation and enforcement of the arbitral process67.
The Arbitration Act in fact, envisages the role of Courts to "support arbitration process"8 by
providing necessary aid and assistance when required by law in certain situations.
29.Section 5 begins with the expression "notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for
the time being in force." The non obstante clause is Parliament's addition to Article 5 of the Model
Law. This is of a wide amplitude and sets forth the legislative intent of limiting judicial intervention
during the arbitral process. In the context of Section 5, this means that the provisions contained in
Part I of the Arbitration Act ought to be given full effect and operation irrespective of any other law
for the time being in force. It is now an established proposition of law that the legislature uses non
obstante clauses to remove all obstructions which might arise out of the provisions of any other law,
which stand in Food Corpn. of India v. Indian Council of Arbitration, (2003) 6 SCC 564. Union of
India v. Popular Construction Co., (2001) 8 SCC 470 P. Anand Gajapathi Raju v. P.V.G. Raju,
(2000) 4 SCC 539 Swiss Timing Ltd. v. Commonwealth Games 2010 Organising Committee, (2014)
6 SCC 677 Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK the way of the operation of the legislation
which incorporates the non obstante clause.9
30.In Chandavarkar Sita Ratna Rao v. Ashalata S. Guram10, Sabyasachi Mukharji, J. explained the
purport of non obstante clause in the following terms :
"67. A clause beginning with the expression "notwithstanding anything contained in
this Act or in some particular provision in the Act or in some particular Act or in any
law for the time being in force, or in any contract" is more often than not appended to
a section in the beginning with a view to give the enacting part of the section in case
of conflict an overriding effect over the provision of the act or the contract mentioned
in the non obstante clause. It is equivalent to saying that in spite of the provision of
the Act or any other Act mentioned in the non obstante clause or any contract or
document mentioned the enactment following it will have its full operation or that
the provisions embraced in the non obstante clause would not be an impediment for
an operation of the enactment."

M/S Hotel Sea Point Pvt. Ltd vs M/S Blueline Resorts Pvt. Ltd on 11 April, 2025
31.Although a non obstante clause must be allowed to operate with full vigour, its effect is limited to
the extent intended by the legislature. In ICICI Bank Ltd. v. Sidco Leathers Ltd.11 the Court held
that a non obstante clause must be interpreted by confining it to the legislative policy. Thus, even if
a non obstante clause has wide amplitude, the extent of its impact has to be measured in view of the
legislative intention and State of Bihar v. Bihar Rajya M.S.E.S.K.K. Mahasangh, (2005) 9 SCC 129
(1986) 4 SCC 447 (2006) 10 SCC 452 Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK legislative policy.
In view of this settled legal position, the issue that arises for our consideration is the scope of the
non obstante clause contained in Section 5 of the Arbitration Act.
32.Section 5 has two facets -- positive and negative. The positive facet vests judicial authorities with
jurisdiction over arbitral proceedings in matters expressly allowed in or dealt with under Part I of
the Arbitration Act. The flip side to this approach is that judicial authorities are prohibited from
intervening in arbitral proceedings in situations where the Arbitral Tribunal has been bestowed with
exclusive jurisdiction. This is the negative facet of Section 5. The non obstante clause limits the
extent of judicial intervention in respect of matters expressly provided under the Arbitration Act. In
Bhaven Construction v. Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd. (supra), the Apex Court observed that
the:
"12. ... non obstante clause is provided to uphold the intention of the legislature as
provided in the Preamble to adopt Uncitral Model Law and Rules, to reduce excessive
judicial interference which is not contemplated under the Arbitration Act."
33.The interplay between the legislative framework under the Arbitration Act and the constitutional
powers of the High Courts under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution has been discussed in
several cases. These rulings have not only elucidated the parameters within which High Courts may
exercise their writ powers but have Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK also reinforced the
fundamental principles underlining the Arbitration Act.
34. In Union of India v. R. Gandhi, President Madras Bar Association12 the Supreme Court
observed on the question as to what constitutes 'Courts' and 'Tribunals' as under:
"38. The term 'Courts' refers to places where justice is administered or refers to
Judges who exercise judicial functions. Courts are established by the state for
administration of justice that is for exercise of the judicial power of the state to
maintain and uphold the rights, to punish wrongs and to adjudicate upon disputes.
Tribunals on the other hand are special alternative institutional mechanisms, usually
brought into existence by or under a statute to decide disputes arising with reference
to that particular statute, or to determine controversies arising out of any
administrative law. Courts refer to Civil Courts, Criminal Courts and High Courts.
Tribunals can be either private Tribunals (Arbitral Tribunals), or Tribunals
constituted under the Constitution (Speaker or the Chairman acting under Para 6(1)
of the Tenth Schedule) or Tribunals authorized by the Constitution (Administrative
Tribunals under Article 323A and Tribunals for other matters under Article 323B) or
Statutory Tribunals which are created under a statute (Motor Accident Claims
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198505074/ 7
M/S Hotel Sea Point Pvt. Ltd vs M/S Blueline Resorts Pvt. Ltd on 11 April, 2025
Tribunal, Debt Recovery Tribunals and consumer fora). Some Tribunals are manned
exclusively by Judicial Officers (Rent Tribunals, Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal,
Labour Courts and Industrial Tribunals). Other statutory Tribunals have Judicial and
Technical Members (Administrative Tribunals, TDSAT, Competition (2010) 11 SCC 1
Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Appellate Tribunal, Consumer fora,
Cyber Appellate Tribunal, etc)." (emphasis is ours)
35. Similar observations were made by the Supreme Court in Srei Infrastructure Finance Ltd. v. Tuff
Drilling (P) Ltd.13,as under:
"14. Arbitration is a quasi judicial proceeding, equitable in nature or character which
differs from a litigation in a Court. The power and functions of arbitral tribunal are
statutorily regulated. The tribunals are special arbitration with institutional
mechanism brought into existence by or under statute to decide dispute arising with
reference to that particular statute or to determine controversy referred to it. The
tribunal may be a statutory tribunal or tribunal constituted under the provisions of
the Constitution of India. Section 9 of the Civil Procedure Code vests into the Civil
Court jurisdiction to entertain and determine any civil dispute. The constitution of
tribunals has been with intent and purpose to take out different categories of
litigation into the special tribunal for speedy and effective determination of disputes
in the interest of the society. Whenever, by a legislative enactment jurisdiction
exercised by ordinary civil court is transferred or entrusted to tribunals such
tribunals are entrusted with statutory power. The arbitral tribunals in the statute of
1996 are no different, they decide the lis between the parties, follows Rules and
procedure conforming to the principle of natural justice, the adjudication has finality
subject to remedy provided under the 1996 Act. Section 8 of the 1996 Act obliges a
judicial authority in a matter which is a subject of an agreement to refer the parties to
arbitration. The reference to arbitral tribunal thus can be made by judicial authority
or an arbitrator can be appointed in accordance (2018) 11 SCC 470 Location: ORISSA
HIGH COURT, CUTTACK with the arbitration agreement under Section 11 of the
1996 Act." (emphasis is ours)
36.Thus, the Supreme Court has time and again held that arbitral tribunals are private tribunals
unlike those tribunals set up under the statute or specialized tribunals under the Constitution of
India. Thus, a Petition under Article 227 challenging orders of an Arbitral Tribunal would be
maintainable.
Scope and extent of interference
37.Coming now to the question as to what would be the scope of interference under Article 226/227
against orders passed by the Arbitral Tribunals, though, a number of judgments have been cited by
both parties, recent decisions of the Supreme Court and of this Court have settled the issue.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198505074/ 8
M/S Hotel Sea Point Pvt. Ltd vs M/S Blueline Resorts Pvt. Ltd on 11 April, 2025
38.In 2019, a Three Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in a judgement authored by Justice R.F
Nariman in the case of M/S Deep Industries Ltd. v Oil And Natural Gas Corporation (supra) held
that it is possible to challenge such a dismissal order through a writ at a High Court under Articles
226 and 227 of the Constitution of India, but the same laid down some stringent terms to challenge
a Section 16 dismissal order.
39.In Deep Industries (supra) decided on 28th November, 2019, the Supreme Court considered
S.B.P. & Company v. Patel Engineering Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Ltd.14 and
Fuerst Day Lawson Limited v. Jindal Exports Limited15 and observed as under:
"15. Given the aforesaid statutory provision and given the fact that the 1996 Act
repealed three previous enactments in order that there be speedy disposal of all
matters covered by it, it is clear that the statutory policy of the Act is that not only are
time limits set down for disposal of the arbitral proceedings themselves but time
limits have also been set down for Section 34 references to be decided. Equally, in
Union of India v. Varindera Const. Ltd., dated 17.09.2018, disposing of SLP (C) No.
23155/2013, this Court has imposed the self-same limitation on first appeals Under
Section 37 so that there be a timely resolution of all matters which are covered by
arbitration awards.
16. Most significant of all is the non-obstante Clause contained in Section 5 which
states that notwithstanding anything contained in any other law, in matters that arise
under Part I of the Arbitration Act, no judicial authority shall intervene except where
so provided in this Part. Section 37 grants a constricted right of first appeal against
certain judgments and orders and no others. Further, the statutory mandate also
provides for one bite at the cherry, and interdicts a second appeal being filed (See
Section 37(2) of the Act).
17. This being the case, there is no doubt whatsoever that if petitions were to be filed
Under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution against orders passed in appeals Under
Section 37, the entire arbitral process would be derailed and would not come to
fruition for many years. At the same time, we cannot forget that Article 227 is a
(2005) 8 SCC 618 (2011) 8 SCC 333 Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK
constitutional provision which remains untouched by the non-obstante Clause of
Section 5 of the Act. In these circumstances, what is important to note is that though
petitions can be filed Under Article 227 against judgments allowing or dismissing
first appeals Under Section 37 of the Act, yet the High Court would be extremely
circumspect in interfering with the same, taking into account the statutory policy as
adumbrated by us herein above so that interference is restricted to orders that are
passed which are patently lacking in inherent jurisdiction." (emphasis is ours)
40.It is, therefore, prudent for a Judge not to exercise discretion to allow judicial interference
beyond the procedure established under the enactment. This power needs to be exercised in
exceptional rarity, wherein one party is left remediless under the statute or a clear 'bad faith' shown
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198505074/ 9
M/S Hotel Sea Point Pvt. Ltd vs M/S Blueline Resorts Pvt. Ltd on 11 April, 2025
by one of the parties or in case which allowed to go unchecked would result in a situation of patent
illegality being perpetuated. This high standard set by the Apex Court is in terms of the legislative
intention to make the arbitration fair and efficient.
41. In this context, a reference may be made to Deep Industries (supra) wherein interplay of Section
5 of the Arbitration Act and Article 227 of the Constitution was analyzed very succinctly:
"15. Most significant of all is the nonobstante clause contained in Section 5 which
states that notwithstanding anything contained in any other law, in matters that arise
under Part I of the Arbitration Act, no judicial authority shall intervene except where
so provided in this Part. Section 37 grants a constricted right of first appeal against
certain judgments and orders and no others. Further, the statutory mandate also
provides for one bite Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK at the cherry, and
interdicts a second appeal being filed (See Section 37(2) of the Act)
16. This being the case, there is no doubt whatsoever that if petitions were to be filed
under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution against orders passed in appeals under
Section 37, the entire arbitral process would be derailed and would not come to
fruition for many years. At the same time, we cannot forget that Article 227 is a
constitutional provision which remains untouched by the non-obstante clause of
Section 5 of the Act. In these circumstances, what is important to note is that though
petitions can be filed under Article 227 against judgments allowing or dismissing first
appeals under Section 37 of the Act, yet the High Court would be extremely
circumspect in interfering with the same, taking into account the statutory policy as
adumbrated by us herein above so that interference is restricted to orders that are
passed which are patently lacking in inherent jurisdiction."
42.Furthermore, the Apex Court in Estralla Rubber v. Dass Estate (P) Ltd.16, has observed that:
"6. The scope and ambit of exercise of power and jurisdiction by a High Court under
Article 227 of the Constitution of India is examined and explained in a number of
decisions of this Court. The exercise of power under this article involves a duty on the
High Court to keep inferior courts and tribunals within the bounds of their authority
and to see that they do the duty expected or required of them in a legal manner. The
High Court is not vested with any unlimited prerogative to correct all kinds of
hardship or wrong decisions made within the limits of the jurisdiction of the
subordinate courts or (2001) 8 SCC 97 Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK
tribunals. Exercise of this power and interfering with the orders of the courts or
tribunals is restricted to cases of serious dereliction of duty and flagrant violation of
fundamental principles of law or justice, where if the High Court does not interfere, a
grave injustice remains uncorrected. It is also well settled that the High Court while
acting under this article cannot exercise its power as an appellate court or substitute
its own judgment in place of that of the subordinate court to correct an error, which
is not apparent on the face of the record. The High Court can set aside or ignore the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198505074/ 10
M/S Hotel Sea Point Pvt. Ltd vs M/S Blueline Resorts Pvt. Ltd on 11 April, 2025
findings of facts of an inferior court or tribunal, if there is no evidence at all to justify
or the finding is so perverse, that no reasonable person can possibly come to such a
conclusion, which the court or tribunal has come to.
7. This Court in Ahmedabad Mfg. & Calico Ptg. Co.
Ltd. v. Ram Tahel Ramnand [(1972) 1 SCC 898 : AIR 1972 SC 1598] in AIR para 12 has stated that
the power under Article 227 of the Constitution is intended to be used sparingly and only in
appropriate cases, for the purpose of keeping the subordinate courts and tribunals within the
bounds of their authority and, not for correcting mere errors. Reference also has been made in this
regard to the case Waryam Singh v. Amarnath [AIR 1954 SC 215 : 1954 SCR 565] . This Court in
Bathutmal Raichand Oswal v. Laxmibai R. Tarte [(1975) 1 SCC 858 : AIR 1975 SC 1297] has
observed that the power of superintendence under Article 227 cannot be invoked to correct an error
of fact which only a superior court can do in exercise of its statutory power as a court of appeal and
that the High Court in exercising its jurisdiction under Article 227 cannot convert itself into a court
of appeal when the legislature has not conferred a right of appeal. Judged by these pronounced
principles, the High Court clearly exceeded its jurisdiction under Article 227 in passing the
impugned order."

43.A perusal of the above-mentioned decisions, shows that the following principles are well settled,
in respect of the scope of interference under Article 226/227 in challenges to orders by an arbitral
tribunal including orders passed under Section 16 of the Act:
(i) An arbitral tribunal is a tribunal against which a petition under Article 226/227
would be maintainable;
(ii) The non-obstante clause in section 5 of the Act does not apply in respect of
exercise of powers under Article 227 which is a Constitutional provision;
(iii) For interference under Article 226/227, there have to be 'exceptional
circumstances';
(iv) Though interference is permissible, unless and until the order is so perverse that
it is patently lacking in inherent jurisdiction, the writ court would not interfere;
(v) Interference is permissible only if the order is completely perverse i.e., that the
perversity must stare in the face;
(vi) High Courts ought to discourage litigation which necessarily interfere with the
arbitral process;
(vii) Excessive judicial interference in the arbitral process is not encouraged;

(viii) It is prudent not to exercise jurisdiction under Article 226/227;
(ix) The power should be exercised in 'exceptional rarity' or if there is 'bad faith' which is shown;
(x) Efficiency of the arbitral process ought not to be allowed to diminish and hence interdicting the
arbitral process should be completely avoided.
44.The Supreme Court, while acknowledging that the hierarchy in our legal framework mandates
that a legislative enactment cannot curtail a Constitutional right and has observed that it is settled
law that when a statutory forum is created by law for redressal of grievances, a Writ Petition would
not 'ordinarily' be entertained ignoring the statutory dispensation. This power needs to be exercised
in exceptional rarity, wherein the illegality or perversity in the order of the Ld. Sole Arbitrator stares
one in the face.
45.Furthermore, it is also well settled that availability of an alternative remedy does not prohibit the
High Courts from entertaining a writ petition in an appropriate case. The High Courts may entertain
a writ petition, notwithstanding the availability of an alternative remedy, particularly (i) where the
writ petition seeks enforcement of a fundamental right, (ii) where there is failure of principles of
natural justice, (iii) where the impugned orders or proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction or
(iv) the vires of an act is under challenge.
Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK
46.This Court concludes that the High Court "can" exercise its powers under writ jurisdiction in
spite of Section 5 of the A&C Act, but whether it "ought" to exercise in this present case remains to
be seen. VI. ISSUE B: WHETHER THIS COURT OUGHT TO INTERFERE WITH THE IMPUGNED
ORDER?
47.The majority judgment of the Apex Court in N.N. Global (2)17 summed up its holding in the
following terms:
"109. ... An agreement which is unstamped or insufficiently stamped is not
enforceable, as long as it remains in the said condition. Such an instrument would be
void as being not enforceable [see Section 2(g) of the Contract Act]."
The above observation conflates the distinction between enforceability and admissibility.
48.Section 35 of the Stamp Act is unambiguous. It stipulates, "No instrument chargeable with duty
shall be admitted in evidence..." The term "admitted in evidence" refers to the admissibility of the
instrument. Sub-section (2) of Section 42, too, states that an instrument in respect of which stamp
duty is paid and which is endorsed as such will be "admissible in evidence". The effect of not paying
duty or paying an inadequate amount renders an instrument inadmissible and not void.

M/S Hotel Sea Point Pvt. Ltd vs M/S Blueline Resorts Pvt. Ltd on 11 April, 2025
Non-stamping or improper stamping does not result in the instrument becoming invalid. The Stamp
Act does not render such an instrument void. The non-payment of stamp duty is accurately
characterised as a curable defect. The Stamp Act itself provides for the N.N. Global Mercantile (P)
Ltd. v. Indo Unique Flame Ltd., (2023) 7 SCC 1 Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK
manner in which the defect may be cured and sets out a detailed procedure for it. It bears
mentioning that there is no procedure by which a void agreement can be "cured".
49.In N.N. Global (2) (supra), the Apex Court has held that the failure to stamp an arbitration
agreement is not a "curable defect". Relying on the provisions of the Contract Act as well as Section
11(6-A) of the Arbitration Act, it has held that an unstamped arbitration agreement is void. The
relevant paragraphs of the judgment of the majority are extracted below :
"103. ... It may not be apposite to merely describe an unstamped arbitration
agreement as a "curable defect".
As long it remains an unstamped instrument, it cannot be taken notice of for any purpose, as
contemplated in Section 35 of the Stamp Act. It remains unenforceable. ... It is "not enforceable in
law". In the said sense, it also cannot exist in law. It would be void. Our view in this regard that
voidness is conflated to unenforceability receives fortification from Section 2(j) of the Contract Act
which renders a contract which ceases to be enforceable void."
50.However, the above observation of the Apex Court in N.N. Global (2) was held to be incorrect by
the Apex Court in Interplay Between Arbitration Agreements under Arbitration, 1996 & Stamp Act,
1899, In re (supra).
51.The Stamp Act is a fiscal legislation which is intended to raise revenue for the Government. It is a
mandatory statute. In Hindustan Steel Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Ltd. v. Dilip
Construction Co.18, Supreme Court dealt with the import of Sections 35, 36 and 42 of the Stamp Act
very succinctly. One of the parties relied on the difference in the phraseology between Sections 35
and 36 to argue that an instrument which was insufficiently stamped or not stamped could be
admitted in evidence upon the payment of duty and a penalty (if any) but that it could not be acted
upon, once admitted. It was argued that Section 35 operates as a bar in two respects, namely, the
admission of an instrument into evidence as well as acting upon that instrument. It was argued that
Section 36, in contrast to Section 35, removed the bar in one respect alone -- the admissibility of the
instrument into evidence. The Supreme Court rejected this argument and has held that the
provisions of the Stamp Act clearly provide that an instrument could be admitted into evidence as
well as it can be acted upon once the appropriate duty has been paid and the instrument is endorse.
The Apex Court held that:
"6. ... The argument ignores the true import of Section
36. By that section an instrument once admitted in evidence shall not be called in
question at any stage of the same suit or proceeding on the ground that it has not
been duly stamped. Section 36 does not prohibit a challenge against an instrument

M/S Hotel Sea Point Pvt. Ltd vs M/S Blueline Resorts Pvt. Ltd on 11 April, 2025
that it shall not be acted upon because it is not duly stamped, but on that account
there is no bar against an instrument not duly stamped being acted upon after
payment of the stamp duty and penalty according to the procedure prescribed by the
Act. The doubt, if any, is removed by the terms of Section 42(2) which enact, in terms
unmistakable, that every (1969) 1 SCC 597 Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT,
CUTTACK instrument endorsed by the Collector under Section 42(1) shall be
admissible in evidence and may be acted upon as if it has been duly stamped."
52.In so holding, the Supreme Court made a significant observation about the purpose of the Stamp
Act and the manner in which it is to be interpreted by courts when it observed that the Stamp Act is
a fiscal measure enacted to secure revenue for the State on certain classes of instruments. It is not
enacted to arm a litigant with a weapon of technicality to meet the case of his opponent. The
stringent provisions of the Act are conceived in the interest of the revenue once that object is
secured according to law, the party staking his claim on the instrument will not be defeated on the
ground of the initial defect in the instrument.
53.The Stamp Act is a legislation which is enacted in the interest of the revenue. The statute must be
interpreted with due regard to its purpose.
54.Now this Court refers to the Agreement in question. The Agreement as produced before us is
signed by the Parties on Rs.100 stamp paper. Clause 19 of the Agreement reads as follows:
"19. Registration and Payment of Stamp Duty - The Lessee shall have the present
lease duly registered at its own cost and pay the stamp duty applicable for the same.
It shall be open to the Lessor to pay the stamp duty or the deficiency of the same and
recover the same from the Lessee."
It is very apparent that the Parties were aware that their Lease Agreement was insufficiently
stamped and that stamp duty would be payable on the same. In fact, the Parties had also gone so far
in order to Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK ascribe who would bear the cost of the
same, the answer to which is - the present Opposite Party.
55.The Petitioner filed an application before the Ld. Arbitrator praying for impound of the
Agreement dated 1.5.2012 and abeyance of proceedings as the said Agreement was not sufficiently
stamped nor registered as required in law. The Ld. Arbitrator vide order dated 13.4.2017, rejected
the prayer of impounding the Agreement as prayed for by the Petitioner. Aggrieved, the Petitioner
approached this Court in W.P.(C) No. 7893/2017 challenging the refusal order of the Ld. Arbitrator.
This Court vide order dated 8.5.2017 in W.P.(C) No. 7893/2017 was pleased to direct the Ld.
Arbitrator to impound the Agreement in line with the Apex Court's judgment in SMS Tea Estates (P)
Ltd. v. Chandmari Tea Co. (P) Ltd19.
56.In compliance with this Court's order dated 8.5.2017 in W.P.(C) No. 7893/2017, the Ld.
Arbitrator vide order dated 20.7.2017 was pleased to impound the Agreement. However, the order
was passed ex-parte without hearing the Petitioner and the onus of payment of the deficit stamp
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198505074/ 14
M/S Hotel Sea Point Pvt. Ltd vs M/S Blueline Resorts Pvt. Ltd on 11 April, 2025
duty was placed on the Petitioner which is in direct contravention of the terms of the Agreement
itself.
57.In any case, the Ld. Arbitrator itself held that "since it is found that the said lease deed in serial
number 1 is compulsory, registerable requiring stamp duty and has not been properly stamped nor
registered, the said lease deed is liable to be impounded". Without any Court's order altering this
status, (2011) 14 SCC 66 Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK how could the Ld. Arbitrator
proceed to deliver an 'award' when the status of the Agreement was impounded.
58.It shocks the conscience of this Court, that this material fact was not brought to the conscious
attention of this Court in W.P.(C) No. 3203 of 2022. Suppression or concealment of material facts is
not advocacy. It is a jugglery, manipulation, manoeuvring or misrepresentation, which has no place
in equitable and prerogative jurisdiction. If the Parties do not disclose all the material facts fairly
and truly but state them in a distorted manner and mislead the court to obtain relief, the same
tantamounts to an egregious abuse of process of this Court.
59.This Court is not a laboratory where parties come to experiment. Where the litigants will mix one
document with one fact and wait with bated breath praying that the Court does not ask too many
questions. This Court generally will never suspect things to be amiss, because this court would like
to believe that "satya" & "dharma" are a society's guiding principles, but it is also equally true that
time is changing. Apart from doing justice to the parties, Courts will have to remain on guard that
justice is being done to this Court by those present before us.
60.Casting such disappointment aside, it is pertinent to note that in view of the law enunciated by
the 7 Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in Interplay Between Arbitration Agreements under
Arbitration, 1996 & Stamp Act, 1899, In re20, the Ld. Sole Arbitrator did not have jurisdiction to
pass any award till the time the "existence and validity" of the Lease (2024) 6 SCC 1 Location:
ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Agreement has been revived by the payment of appropriate
stamp duty. This Court and the Ld. Sole Arbitrator is bound by the law declared by the Supreme
Court.
61.Given this Court's conclusion in Issue A and the reasons discussed above, this Court believes that
the present matter comes within the meaning of "exceptional" and writ jurisdiction ought to be
exercised in the face of such patent illegality, which necessitates interference. VII. CONCLUSION:
62.Therefore, in light of the discussion above, keeping the settled principles of law in mind and for
the reasons given above, this Court is of the considered view that the impugned order merits
interference.
63.The Impugned Order/Award is set aside. The Arbitral Tribunal having impounded the
instrument, which is not duly stamped as per the provisions of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899, shall
forward it to the Collector, if the same has not already been done. The Collector then, shall, direct
the collection of the appropriate stamp duty and levy penalty. In this regard, it is clarified that the
stamp duty and any penalty thereupon shall be borne by the Parties in the manner stipulated in the

Agreement. Upon payment, the Collector shall endorse that the proper stamp duty has been paid
under Section 42 of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899. This endorsed instrument shall be returned to the
Ld. Sole Arbitrator, after which the proceedings shall be conducted and concluded expeditiously. Till
such time, the arbitration proceedings shall remain in abeyance.
