The case of the prosecution in short is that the marriage of the deceased was solemnized with the
appellant. Wife of the appellant committed suicide within seven years of her marriage. During
inquiry, it was found that the appellant harassed the deceased on account of non-fulfilling of the
demand of dowry. On the basis of which, FIR has been lodged.
Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that before this marriage appellant and deceased were
previously married. After taking divorce from their previous spouse, they solemnized second
marriage with each other registered under Special Marriage Act. A certificate of that effect has been
provided by the marriage authorities. It has further submitted that the appellant has neither
instigated deceased for committing suicide nor harassed her for any demand. Both the parties
solemnized marriage with consent of each-other. Brother of the deceased has unnecessarily dragged
the appellant in this case. It has further been submitted that the appellant has been in custody since
18.07.2019, therefore, it has been prayed that the appellant may be released on bail.
