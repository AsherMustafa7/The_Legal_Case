[6] Mr. Ajoy Pebam, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that in similar matter arising out of
the same FIR, i.e., AB Nos. 32, 33 & 34 of 2023, the petitioner who is an elected MLA and one of the
members of the ADC, Senapati, has been granted interim protection by this Court and prays for
similar relief for the present petitioner also as he is a Government servant and if he is arrested in the
course of the investigation, he may be liable for suspension and facing disciplinary proceeding.
[7] Mr. M. Rarry, learned Sp.PP draws the attention of this Court to the judgment of Hon'ble Apex
Court in the case of Sushila Aggarwal vs. State of NCT, Delhi reported as (2020) 5 SCC 1 Para 85.2
and the judgment in P. Chidambaram vs. Directorate of Enforcement reported as (2019) 9 SCC 9
Para 72 to 79 where the Hon'ble Apex Court laid down the principle that even for the interim
protection in economic offences, the prosecution has to be heard before granting limited interim
bail.
[8] Mr. M. Rarry, learned Sp.PP also highlighted that the investigating authority is facing very
difficult situation in the investigation as limited interim protection was granted to the accused who
are high profile officials and prays that interim may be granted only after hearing the true facts of
the case.
[9] Mr. Ajoy Pebam, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that in the same FIR, other accused
persons have been granted interim protection by this Court and the petitioner is also entitled to the
same protection.
[10] Considering all these facts, it is hereby ordered that if the petitioner is arrested by the police in
connection with FIR No.6(09)2023 CB-PS U/S 7(b)/13 PC Act & 120-B/34 IPC before the next date
of hearing, he shall be released on bail on his furnishing a bail bond of Rs.50,000/- (Rupees fifty
thousand) with one surety (Government employee) to the satisfaction of the Arresting Authority. It
is also made clear that the petitioner should co-operate with the investigation and he should make
himself available for interrogation by the I.O. of the case in connection with the said FIR as and
when required. The petitioner should not leave the State of Manipur without prior permission of the
Arresting Authority. It is further made clear that if the petitioner violates any of the conditions given
hereinabove, the respondents are at liberty to approach this Court for modification or cancellation
of this interim order. [10.1] It is made clear that granting interim protection to the accused
person/petitioner cannot be used as blanket during the course of investigation by the petitioner.
[11] List these cases on 31.10.2023 along with AB No.36 of 2023 before the roster Court.
[12] Furnish a copy of this order to the learned counsels appearing for the parties.
