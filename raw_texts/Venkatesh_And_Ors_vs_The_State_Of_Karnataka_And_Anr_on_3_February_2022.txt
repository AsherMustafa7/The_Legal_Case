ORDER
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172825020/ 2
Venkatesh And Ors vs The State Of Karnataka And Anr on 3 February, 2022
Though this matter is listed for admission, with the consent of learned counsel for parties, it is taken
up for final disposal.
2. Petitioner Nos.1 to 4 and respondent No.2 are present. They have filed a joint application under
Section 320 (2) of Cr.P.C.
3. The dispute is with regard to the non compatibility between petitioner No.1 - Venkatesh and
respondent No.2 - Surekha. Since the parties could not see eye to eye and on account of the alleged
harassment, respondent No.2 has filed a complaint before the Women police station, Kalaburagi for
the offences punishable under Sections 498-A, 323, 504, 506, 109 read with Section 34 of IPC and
under Section 3 and 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961.
4. The respondent No.2 has resolved to file a petition seeking grant of maintenance and a divorce
petition is also pending before the Family Court, Kalaburagi.
5. In the light of these aspects of the matter, the petitioners have amicably settled the dispute in
agreeing to pay a sum of Rs.1,50,000/- as permanent alimony to respondent No.2 and put to an end
to all the allegations pending between the parties.
6. In a matter of this nature, when the settlement is a true settlement, the higher Courts namely, the
Supreme Court and the High Courts have got power under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. and under Article
142 of the Constitution of India beyond the scope of Section 320 of Cr.P.C. and put an end to the
pending criminal litigations between the parties.
7. In this regard, this Court gainfully places its reliance on the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court
in the case of Ramgopal vs. State of Madhya Pradesh, reported in 2021 Supreme Court Cases
(OnLine) 834, the relevant paragraph of the said judgment reads as under:
"20. Having appraised the afore-stated para-meters and weighing upon the peculiar
facts and circumstances of the two appeals before us, we are inclined to invoke
powers under Article 142 and quash the criminal proceedings and consequently set
aside the conviction in both the appeals. We say so for the reasons that: Firstly, the
occurrence(s) involved in these appeals can be categorized as purely personal or
having overtones of criminal proceedings of private nature;
Secondly, the nature of injuries incurred, for which the Appellants have been
convicted, do not appear to exhibit their mental depravity or commission of an
offence of such a serious nature that quashing of which would override public
interest;
Thirdly, given the nature of the offence and injuries, it is immaterial that the trial
against the Appellants had been concluded or their appeal(s) against conviction stand
dismissed;

Venkatesh And Ors vs The State Of Karnataka And Anr on 3 February, 2022
Fourthly, the parties on their own volition, without any coercion or compulsion,
willingly and voluntarily have buried their differences and wish to accord a quietus to
their dispute(s);
Fifthly, the occurrence(s) in both the cases took place way back in the years 2000 and
1995, respectively. There is nothing on record to evince that either before or after the
purported compromise, any untoward incident transpired between the parties;
Sixthly, since the Appellants and the complainant(s) are residents of the same
village(s) and/or work in close vicinity, the quashing of criminal proceedings will
advance peace, harmony, and fellowship amongst the parties who have decided to
forget and forgive any ill-will and have no vengeance against each other; and
Seventhly, the cause of administration of criminal justice system would remain
un-effected on acceptance of the amicable settlement between the parties and/or
resultant acquittal of the Appellants; more so looking at their present age."
8. Taking note of the above guidelines and contents of the joint application, this Court is satisfied
that there is a true settlement between the parties. The contents of the joint application are read out
to the parties and the parties submit that the contents depict the true terms of settlement.
Accordingly, there is no impediment for this Court to allow the joint application and quash the
further proceedings. A sum of Rs.75,000/- is paid in cash to respondent No.2 by petitioner No.1
before this Court, which is acknowledged by respondent No.2 today. Balance sum of Rs.75,000/- is
agreed to be paid before the Family Court. Accordingly, pass the following:
ORDER The petition is allowed. In view of the joint application filed, the pending
proceedings in Crime No.163/2021 on the file of Women Police Station, Kalaburagi is
hereby quashed.
In view of disposal of main petition, I.A.1/2021 does not survive for consideration
and same is hereby disposed of.
