(cid:12) Crl.R.C.No.1610 of 2024
ORDER
Challenging the order of dismissal dated 29.08.2024 in Crl.M.P.No.8649 of 2024, passed by the
learned Principal Special Judge under EC & NDPS Act, Chennai, the petitioner, who is the owner of
the mobile phone viz.,Apple iPhone 15 Green MTPA3HNA and Serial Number 357992877515343,
seized in Crime No.231 of 2024, is before this Court with the present Revision.
2. Mr.A.Tamilselvan, the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner would submit that the
petitioner is the owner of the mobile phone viz.,Apple iPhone 15 Green MTPA3HNA and Serial
Number 357992877515343. He would further submit that the accused in this case is her brother and
the petitioner is no way connected with the offence. Since her brother's Mobile Phone was not
working, he taken her Mobile Phone for some urgency. Latter, it has been seized by the respondent
police.
3. Mr.Hasan Mohammed Jinnah, the learned State Public Prosecutor for the respondent would
submit that on 18.06.2024 at about 9.00 hours, when Chellamuthu HC-1109 was in station duty, at
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis that time, he received secret information about the illegal
transportation of Narcotic substance. Based on that, the Police Team went to the scene of
occurrence ie., Panapakkam Bus Stop, Arani. At that time, one unknown person standing in a
suspicious manner. Police apprehended and enquired him. During enquiry, he disclosed his name as
Silapathikaram. On search, 1.200 Kgs of Ganja was seized from him along with Apple iPhone under
cover of mahazar in Crime No.231 of 2024. Thereafter, the accused and articles were produced
before the Special Court and the same was taken on file in A.No.1007/2024 and B.No.567 of 2024
on 12.08.2024. The petitioner, who is the brother of the sole accused / Silapathikaram, filed a
petition before the trial Court seeking return of mobile phone. The trial Court dismissed the petition
for the reason investigation not completed.
4. The learned State Public Prosecutor vehemently opposed the petition submitting that return of
property in the NDPS Act Cases cannot be entertained invoking Sections 457 and 451 of Cr.P.C., and
it is liable for confiscation under Section 52-A, 60, 61 and 63 of NDPS Act., unless the owner of the
conveyance proves that the conveyance was used without his knowledge and connivance, he has
taken all https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis reasonable precaution against such use. In support of his
contention, the learned State Public Prosecutor relied on the Judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in
the case of Suresh Nanda Vs. Central Bureau of Investigation reported in (2008) 3 SCC 674 to stress
the point that, where there is a special Act dealing with subject, resort should be to that Act instead
of general Act providing for the matter connected with the specific Act. He stressed his argument
mainly on Union of India Vs. Mohanlal and Another reported in (2016) 3 SCC 379, wherein the Apex
Court has given directions for storage, seizure and sampling, handling and disposal of seized
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73111131/ 2
Tamizharasi vs State on 20 December, 2024
narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. Considering the piquant situation in which
accumulation of huge quantities of seized drugs and narcotics increased the chances of their
pilferage for re-circulation in the market and also finding that despite Central Government Standing
Order No.1/1989 and two subsequent Standing Orders, dated 10.05.2007 and 16.01.2015 giving
directions, directing that no sooner seizure of any narcotic and psychotropic and controlled
substances and conveyances is effected, the same shall be forwarded to the officer in-charge of the
nearest police station or to the officer empowered under Section 53 of the Act and Section 52-A(2) of
the Act. The sampling shall be done under the supervision of the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
Magistrate and the Central and State Government and its agencies within six months from the date
of the order take appropriate steps to set up storage facilities for the exclusive storage of seized
narcotic and psychotropic substances and conveyances, duly equipped with vaults and
double-locking system to prevent theft, pilferage or replacement of the seized drugs. Further, the
Apex Court given direction to constitute Drug Disposal Committee and disposal of seized drugs lying
in the Police Malkhanas and other places used for storage of drugs and psychotropic substances.
5. The learned State Public Prosecutor would further submit that this Court in Crl.R.C(MD)No.41 of
2019 in the case of Nahoorkani Vs. The State of Tamil Nadu on 16.06.2023 held that when the
conveyance is seized under NDPS Act, the return of property does not arise as contemplated under
Sections 451 and 457 of Cr.P.C., and it is liable to be confiscated under Section 63 of the NDPS Act in
the light of special procedure under Section 52-A of the Act. Any person claiming the ownership or
right of the conveyance may approach the concerned Drug Disposal Committee directly and make
claim and the Drug Disposal Committee before taking a decision on disposal of the vehicle, shall
grant opportunity of hearing to the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis parties and pass appropriate
orders on the representation made by the party in accordance with law, as expeditiously as possible,
within a period of two months. Further, if any persons approach the trial Court for release of vehicle,
the property already produced before the trial Court and assigned R.P.Number then such court shall
conduct enquiry and pass suitable orders, as contemplated under Section 63 of the NDPS Act or if
the vehicle not produced before the Court then competent Court shall pass appropriate order by
directing the petitioner to approach concerned Drug Disposal Committee for getting suitable relief.
Further, in the event of trial Court / Special Court for NDPS release the vehicle under Section 451
Cr.P.C., shall initiate the confiscation proceedings and dispose the vehicle as contemplated under
Section 63 of the NDPS Act.
6. Further, he relied on the order of this this Court in Crl.R.C.(MD)No.116 of 2024, dated
08.02.2024 wherein this Court, following the order passed in Nahoorkani's case (cited supra) held
that whenever a return of property is filed, the petitioner has to satisfy Sections 60, 61 and 62 of
NDPS Act. In yet another case, in Crl.R.C(MD)No.1395 of 2023, Gomathi Vs. State, dated
27.02.2024, this Court passed orders on the similar line of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
Nahoorkani's case. Further, he referred Crl.R.C.No.675 of 2023 in the case of Salimrajan @ Salimraj
Vs. State dated 12.07.2023 wherein this Court again followed the Nahoorkani's case. In sum and
substance, he argued that any property say conveyance seized in NDPS Act cases cannot be returned
as a matter of routine and it is only after satisfying Sections 60, 61, 62, and 63 of the said Act.

7. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner opposed the contention of the learned State
Public Prosecutor and submitted that Mohanlal's case, refers to Section 52-A primarily with regard
to not following the Standing Order No.1/1989 and the subsequent Standing Orders, dated
10.05.2007 and 16.01.2015, which prescribed procedures to be followed while conducting seizure of
contraband, sampling, safe custody and disposal finding that there is no uniform procedures
followed in seizure, sampling and storing the narcotic in safe vaults and handling and disposal of
seized narcotics, lying in the malkhanas or any other storage place without proper storage facility,
thereby, the danger of recirculation of seized contraband into system is very much likely, hence
issued directions to the Investigation Agency, Magistrate and Governments to follow guidelines.
Further, submitted that this Court, following the Apex Court Judgment in
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Sainaba Vs. State of Kerala and Anr in Crl.A.No.2005/2022,
reported in 2022 (7) KHC 2731, wherein the Apex Court released the vehicle involved in the NDPS
Act well after Mohanlals' case. Hence, it cannot be said that Mohanlal's case places restrictions on
release of vehicle. The Sainaba's case, being the Judgment of the Apex Court this Court finding, it is
binding under Article 144 of the Constitution of India entertained and allowed the return of property
petition filed under Sections 451 and 457. The citations referred by the State Public Prosecutor is no
more res integra on the point of return of property. He further added that this Court in
Crl.R.C.(MD)No.41 of 2019, Crl.R.C.(MD)No.116 of 2024 and Crl.R.C.(MD)No.1395 of 2023 and in
Crl.R.C.(MD)No.675 of 2022, the Sainaba's case was not considered. In view of the Apex Court
Judgment in Sainaba's case, the confiscation proceedings cannot be an embargo to consider the
return of property petition, but of course, the return of property petition to be considered on its own
merits and hence, there is no impediment to entertain the above petition.
8. I have heard the learned counsels appearing on either side and perused the materials available on
record.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
9. On perusal of the records it is seen that in Mohanlal's case, the Apex Court finding is that, despite
issuance of the Standing Order No.1/1989 and the subsequent Standing Orders, dated 10.05.2007
and 16.01.2015, no uniform practice and procedures followed by State or Central Agencies in the
matter of drawing of samples at the time of seizure, storage of drugs in safes and vaults, not placed
in double- locking system and piquant situation arose by which accumulation of huge quantities of
the seized drugs and narcotics increased and the chances of their pilferage for re-circulation in the
market, hence put in place certain procedures and guidelines to the Investigation Agency,
Magistrate, Central and State Governments, and ordered formation of Drug Disposal Committee to
monitor the same. No direction with regard to the conveyance considered and issued. Further, the
Notification No.G.S.R.899(E), dated 23.12.2022 issued in terms of Section 52-A of the NDPS Act.
The question whether there is any legal embargo in view of confiscation proceedings under Sections
60 to 63 of the NDPS Act and whether petition seeking return of property under Sections 451 and
457 can be entertained and decided has been dealt in detail by the Karnataka High Court Division
Bench in Rathnamma v. State rep., by PSI, Channagiri Police https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
Station, Davabagere District in CRL.P.No.3571/2021, which was in conflict to the Division Bench
Judgement of the Kerala High Court in Shajahan Vs. Inspector of Excise and Others reported in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73111131/ 4
Tamizharasi vs State on 20 December, 2024
2019 SCC Online Ker 3685, hence the matter was referred to a Larger Bench by the Kerala High
Court and the Kerala High Court in the case of Pradeep B. Vs. The District Drug Disposal Committee
represented by its Chairman, Kasargod and Others in WA No.1304 of 2022, dated 19.02.2024 dealt
in detail, referring to Section 52-A, guidelines given in the Mohanlal's case and held that
jurisdictional Special Court under the NDPS Act has power to consider the grant of interim custody
of the article under the Act by invoking powers under Section 457 of Cr.P.C., and answered the
reference accordingly. It had also referred to the orders passed by Allahabad High Court in Shams
Tavrej v. Union of India reported in 2023 SCC OnLine AII 1154 and Rajdhari Yadav v. State of U.P.
Reported in 2022 SCC OnLine AII 583 and Union of India v. Tejinder Singh reported in 2023 SCC
OnLine Gau 729 and following Sainaba Vs. State of Kerala (2022 (7) KHC 273) held interim custody
of a vehicle involved under the NDPS Act could be ordered. In Sainaba's case, the procedures
contemplated and applicable in NDPS Act in consonace with Cr.P.C., are dealt in detail.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis The Apex Court considering both NDPS Act and Cr.P.C., held as
follows:-
“5. It has been opined by the High Court that the Court is not empowered to exercise
the jurisdiction under Section 451 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to release a
vehicle involved under NDPS Act in interim custody.
6.The appellant has urged inter alia that as per Section 36-C read with Section 51 of
the NDPS Act, Criminal Procedure Code would be application for proceedings by a
Special Court under NDPS Act and Section 451 has an inbuilt provision to impose any
specific condition on the appellant while releasing the vehicle. The appellant is
undoubtedly the registered owner of the vehicle but had not participated in the
offence as alleged by the prosecution nor had knowledge of the alleged transaction.
7. Learned counsel seeks to rely on the judgment of this Court in Sunderbhai Ambalal
Desai Vs. State of Gujarat – 2003 (2) KLT 1089 (SC) = (2002) 10 SCC 283 opining
that it is no use to keep such seized vehicles at police station for a long period and it is
open to the Magistrate to pass appropriate orders immediately by taking a bond
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis and a guarantee as well as security for return of the
said vehicle, if required any any point of time.
8. On hearing learned counsel for parties and in the conspectus of the facts and
circumstances of the case, and the legal provisions referred aforesaid, we are of the
view that this is a appropriate case for release of the vehicle on terms and conditions
to be determined by the Special Court.”
10. It is not in dispute that the petitioner is the owner of the Mobile and not an
accused in this case. The accused, who is the brother of the petitioner, taken the
Mobile Phone of the petitioner for some urgency, since his mobile was not working.
Latter, the same has been seized in this case. The petitioner submitted that all her
important details are in the mobile phone and further she made all transactions
through her Mobile Phone. Now-a-days, it is through online almost all the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73111131/ 5
Tamizharasi vs State on 20 December, 2024
transactions are carried out and hence, she needs her Mobile.
11. Hence, following the Supreme Court Judgment, in Sainaba's case, and the Full
Bench of Kerala High Court in Pradeep's case, this Court finds the objection of the
learned State https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Public Prosecutor that there is total
embargo in entertaining the petition for return of property under the relevant
provision of Cr.P.C., is no more res intergra. In view of the same, this Court is
inclined to entertain and consider the grant of interim custody of Mobile Phone
seized under the NDPS by invoking the power under Sections 451 and 457 of Cr.P.C
consequently under Section 497 and 503 BNSS, subject to the confiscation
proceedings.
12. The lower Court following the guidelines given in Sunderbhai Ambalal Desai case,
take photographs, record the features of the Mobile Phone, prepare a proceeding to
be used as proof in the trial, before return the Mobile Phone to the petitioner.
13. In view of the foregoing reasons, the order of dismissal dated 29.08.2024 in
Crl.M.P.No.8649 of 2024, passed by the learned Principal Special Judge under EC &
NDPS Act, Chennai, is set aside and this Revision is allowed with a direction to the
learned Principal Sessions Judge, to return the Mobile Phone, viz.,Apple iPhone 15
Green MTPA3HNA and Serial Number 357992877515343, seized in Crime No.231 of
2024, in favour of the petitioner on the petitioner submitting an undertaking on the
following terms and conditions:-
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis i. The petitioner shall furnish a personal bond for a
sum of Rs.5,000/- (Rupees Five Thousand Only) with one surety, undertaking to
produce the Mobile Phone as and when directed by the trial court.
ii. The petitioner shall not sale, mortgage or transfer the ownership of the Mobile
