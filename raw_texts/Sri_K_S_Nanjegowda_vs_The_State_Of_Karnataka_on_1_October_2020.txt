QUASH THE IMPUGNED ORDER OF DISMISSAL DATED
29.10.2010 PASSED BY THE 3RD RESPONDENT VIDE
ANNEXURE-G TO THE WRIT PETITION AND ETC.,
THESE WRIT PETITIONS COMING ON FOR FURTHER
HEARING THROUGH PHYSICAL HEARING, THIS DAY, THE
COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:-
ORDER
Regard being had to the similitude in the controversy involved in the present cases, the Writ
Petitions were analogously heard and by a common order, they are being disposed of by this Court.
2. In these two matters, petitioners services had been terminated/dismissed in the guise of their
involvement in the alleged demand and acceptance of illegal gratification read with trap proceedings
led by the office of the Karnataka Lokayukta on 08.09.2010 and 29.10.2010.
3. Brief facts of the case are:
- Petitioners were the employees of the respondent/BBMP. It is alleged by the
respondent/BBMP that petitioners were temporary workers/daily wagers.
Consequently, their involvement in the alleged demand and acceptance of illegal
gratification suffice to terminate/dismiss their service is in order, since they are not
regular holder of any post so as to initiate disciplinary proceedings.
4. The respondent/BBMP counsel vehemently contended that DPAR Circular dated 24.11.2003
empowers the competent authority to impose fine or terminate/dismiss the daily wage employees
without resorting to disciplinary proceedings like The Karnataka Civil Services (Classification,
Control and Appeal) Rules, 1957 (Hereinafter referred to as the 'Rules, 1957' for short). Thus, there
is no infirmity in the order of termination/dismissal dated 08.09.2010 and 29.10.2010 (Annexure -
G to the respective petitions).
5. Per contra, learned counsel for the petitioner resisted the contention of the respondent/BBMP
stating that if an employee is a daily wager or temporary appointee, no penal action like
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99839402/ 3
Sri K S Nanjegowda vs The State Of Karnataka on 1 October, 2020
termination/dismissal of such employee in terms of allegations/misconduct/misdeeds or formal
domestic enquiry is mandatory. It is further submitted that Rules, 1957 may not apply to the daily
wager or temporary employee even otherwise, in order to determine whether temporary
employee/daily wager has committed any misconduct or misdeed in the parent
organization/department, formal domestic enquiry is required to be held so as to prove the alleged
misconduct/charge. In support of the aforesaid contentions, learned counsel for the petitioner relied
on the following decisions:
1. The Government of India v/s Dhanu.S.Rathod reported in ILR 2002 Kar 4911
2. W.P. No. 11977/2012 disposed of 30/05/2016 in Sadashivaiah v/s State of
Karnataka & Ors
3. Managing Director, Uttar Pradesh Warehousing Corporation And Another v/s
Vijay Narayan Vajpayee reported in 1980 (3) SCC 459
4. Nar Singh Pal v/s Union of India And Others reported in 2000 (3) SCC 588
6. Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
7. The core issue of in these petitions is, "Whether termination/dismissal of the petitioners could be
ordered without holding domestic enquiry"?
8. The undisputed facts are that both petitioners were the temporary employees with the
respondent/BBMP. While they were discharging the duties of the post held by them, they were
alleged to have involved in trap proceedings led by the office of the Karnataka Lokayukta. The
allegations are relating to alleged demand and acceptance of illegal gratification. In this backdrop,
whether domestic enquiry is mandatory or not is required to be examined in these petitions. During
pendency of these petitions, both the petitioners were acquitted in the criminal proceedings.
9. The respondent/BBMP relied on the aforesaid circular of the Government dated 24.11.2003 to
contend that Rules, 1957 are not attracted so as to initiate enquiry. No-doubt the applicability clause
of Rules, 1957 mandates that one should be a Government servant. However, the allegations are
serious in nature, in such circumstances minimal domestic inquiry is warranted and not merely
issuing notice and proceed to terminate service.
10. In the present case, Rules, 1957 is stated to have been adopted by the BBMP. Status of the
employees is temporary or daily wagers, still having regard to the serious allegations leveled against
the petitioners that they were involved in alleged demand and acceptance of illegal gratification and
they were subjected to criminal proceedings. Having regard to the judicial pronouncements in the
aforesaid four decisions, suffice that before taking any penal action against temporary employee or
daily wager based on the allegations/misconduct stated to have been committed, minimum
requirement is to hold a domestic enquiry in order to prove the alleged allegations leveled against
such of those employees.

Sri K S Nanjegowda vs The State Of Karnataka on 1 October, 2020
Judicial pronouncements overrides the Government circular dated 24.11.2003. That apart, time and
again, Courts have held that, if any penal action is taken against an employee on the allegations and
if it is disputed by such an employee, it is mandatory to initiate domestic enquiry and conclude the
same before taking any impugned action like termination/discharge.
11. The Constitutional Bench of the Apex Court in Delhi Transport Corporation vs D.T.C. Mazdoor
Congress And Others. Reported in (1991) SCC (L&S) 1213 at paragraph 264,335,& 337 have held as
under;
264. In Sukhdev Singh v. Bhagatram, (1975) 1 SCC 421: 1975 SCC (L&S) 101:
(1975) 3 SCR 619 the Constitution Bench of this Court put a nail in the coffin of the
play of the private master's power to hire and fire his employees and held that
Regulations or Rules made under a statute apply uniformly to everyone or to all
members of the same group or class. They impose obligations on the statutory
authorities who cannot deviate from the conditions of service and any deviation will
be enforced through legal sanction of declaration by courts to invalidate the actions
in violation of the Rules or Regulations.
The statutory bodies have no free hand in framing the terms or conditions of service of their
employees. The Regulations bind both the authorities and also the public. The powers of the
statutory bodies are derived, controlled and restricted by the statutes which create them and the
Rules and Regulations framed thereunder. The statute, thereby fetters on the freedom of contract.
Accordingly declaration was granted that dismissal or removal of an employee by statutory
Corporation in contravention of statutory provision as void. Mathew, J. in a separate but concurring
judgment held that a Public Corporation being the creation of a statute is subject to statutory
limitation as a State itself. The preconditions of this Part II viz. that the corporation is created by
statute and, the existence of power in the corporation is to invade a statutory right of the individual.
Therefore, the governing power must be subject to fundamental statutory limitations. The need to
subject the power centres to the control of the Constitution requires an expansion of concept of State
action. The duty of State is affirmative duty seeing that all essentials of life are made available to all
persons. The task of State today is to make the achievement of good life both by removing obstacles
in the path of such achievement and by assisting individual in realising his ideal of self- perfection.
The employment under public corporation is a public employment and, therefore, the employee
should have the protection which appertains to public employment. (emphasis supplied) The court
must, therefore, adopt the attitude that declaration is a normal remedy for a wrongful dismissal in
case of public employees which can be refused in exceptional circumstances. The remedy of
declaration should be a remedy made an instrument to provide reinstatement in public sector. This
principle was extended to numerous instances where the termination of services of the employees of
a statutory corporation was affected in violation of the principles of natural justice or in
transgression of the statutory rules etc. In Managing Director, U.P. State Warehousing Corporation
v. Vinay Narayan Vajpayee, (1980) 3 SCC 459: 1980 SCC (L&S) 453:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99839402/ 5
Sri K S Nanjegowda vs The State Of Karnataka on 1 October, 2020
(1980) 2 SCR 773 (SCR pp. 780 F to G and 783-C to 784-A (sic): SCC p. 466, para 14
and pp. 467-68, para 18) this Court held that statutory body cannot terminate the
services of its employees without due enquiry held in accordance with the principles
of natural justice.
The persons in public employment are entitled to the protection of Articles 14 and 16 of the
Constitution, when the service was arbitrarily terminated. The question, therefore, is whether the
statutory corporations are entitled to be invested with absolute freedom to terminate the services of
its employees in terms of the contract of service.
335. It is undoubtedly true as contended by Sri Bhasin, learned counsel for the intervenor, that it is
open to the authorities to terminate the services of a temporary employee without holding an
enquiry. But in view of the march of law made, viz., that it is not the form of the action but the
substance of the order is to be looked into, it is open to the court to lift the veil and pierce the
impugned action to find whether the impugned action is the foundation to impose punishment or is
only a motive. A larger bench of seven Judges of this Court in Shamsher Singh v. State of Punjab
(1974) 2 SCC 831: 1974 SCC (L&S) 550:
(1975) 1 SCR 814 elaborately considered the question and laid down the rule in this
regard. The play of fair play is to secure justice procedural as well as substantive. The
substance of the order, the effect thereof is to be looked into.
Whether no misconduct spurns the action or whether the services of a probationer is terminated
without imputation of misconduct is the test. Termination simpliciter, either due to loss of
confidence or unsuitability to the post may be a relevant factor to terminate the services of a
probationer. But it must be hedged with a bona fide overall consideration of the previous conduct
without trained with either mala fide or colourable exercise of power or for extraneous
considerations. Such actions were upheld by this Court. The action must be done honestly with due
care and prudence.
337. It is made clear that, as suggested by this Court in Hindustan Steel case (1984 Supp SCC 554:
1985 SCC (L & S) 260: (1985) 2 SCR 428) that it is for concerned (sic authority) to make appropriate
rules or regulations and to take appropriate action even without resorting to elaborate enquiry
needed consistent with the constitutional scheme. The correctness of the decision in Tulsiram
Patel's case (1985) 3 SCC 398: 1985 SCC (L&S) 672: 1985 Supp 2 SCR 131 though was doubted in
Ram Chander v. Union of India, (1986) 3 SCC 103: 1986 SCC (l&S) 383: (1986) 2 SCR 980, it is
unnecessary to go into that question. For the purpose of this case it is sufficient to hold that proviso
to Article 311(2) itself is a constitutional provision which excluded the applicability of Article 311(2)
as an exception for stated grounds. It must be remembered that the authority taking action under
either of the clauses (b) or
(c) to proviso are enjoined to record reasons, though the reasons are not subject to judicial scrutiny,
but to find the basis of which or the ground on which or the circumstances under which they are
satisfied to resort to the exercise of the power under either of the two relevant clauses to proviso to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99839402/ 6
Sri K S Nanjegowda vs The State Of Karnataka on 1 October, 2020
Article 311(2) of the Constitution. Recording reasons itself is a safeguard for preventing to take
arbitrary or unjust action. That ratio cannot be made applicable to the statutory rules.
12. Apex Court in D K YADAV vs J M A INDUSTRIES LTD., reported in (1993) 3 SCC 259 has held
at paragraphs 11 and 12 as under:
11. The law must therefore be now taken to be well-settled that procedure prescribed
for depriving a person of livelihood must meet the challenge of Article 14 and such
law would be liable to be tested on the anvil of Article 14 and the procedure
prescribed by a statute or statutory rule or rules or orders effecting the civil rights or
result in civil consequences would have to answer the requirement of Article 14. So it
must be right, just and fair and not arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive. There can be no
distinction between a quasi-judicial function and an administrative function for the
purpose of principles of natural justice.
The aim of both administrative inquiry as well as the quasi-.judicial inquiry is to arrive at a just
decision and if a rule of natural justice is calculated to secure justice or to put it negatively, to
prevent miscarriage of justice, it is difficult to see why it should be applicable only to quasi-
judicial inquiry and not to administrative inquiry. It must logically apply to both.
12. Therefore, fair play in action requires that the procedure adopted must be just, fair and
reasonable. The manner of exercise of the power and its impact on the rights of the person affected
would be in conformity with the principles of natural justice. Article 21 clubs life with liberty, dignity
of person with means of livelihood without which the glorious content of dignity of person would be
reduced to animal existence. When it is interpreted that the colour and content of procedure
established by law must be in conformity with the minimum fairness and processual justice, it
would relieve legislative callousness despising opportunity of being heard and fair opportunities of
defence. Article 14 has a pervasive processual potency and versatile quality, equalitarian in its soul
and allergic to discriminatory dictates. Equality is the antithesis of arbitrariness. It is, thereby,
conclusively held by this Court that the principles of natural justice are part of Article 14 and the
procedure prescribed by law must be just, fair and reasonable.
13. Further, this Court in SMT.
SHANTHALAKSHMI vs THE COMMISSIONER FOR SERICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT in Writ
Petition No. 26851/1998 (S-KAT) decided on 24/06/2002 framed three points for consideration.
Point No. 3 relates to, "Whether the order of termination dated 21-1-1997 is valid?" Para 10 relates
to Re-Point (iii) which is extracted hereunder for ready reference
10. In a series of decisions, the Supreme Court has held that even in the case of temporary
employees or daily wage employees, an order of termination on the allegation of involvement in
some criminal offence, cannot be treated as a simple order of retrenchment, but will have to be
treated as an order of punishment and therefore should be preceded by a regular departmental
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99839402/ 7
Sri K S Nanjegowda vs The State Of Karnataka on 1 October, 2020
enquiry [see decisions in OM PRAKASH GOEL vs HIMACHAL PRADESH TOURISM
DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION [1991(3) SCC 291], NAR SINGH PAL vs UNION OF INDIA
[2000(3) SCC 588] AND CHANDRA PRAKASH SHASHI vs STATE OF UTTARPRADESH [2000(5)
SCC 152]. Even an ad-hoc employee cannot be discharged as a measure of punishment or by casting
a stigma, without an enquiry [vide STATE OF UP VS KAUSHAL KISHORE SINGH [1991(1) SCC
691] AND HARDEEP SINGH vs STATE OF HARYANA (1987) SUPP. SCC 295].
In view of the aforesaid decisions, the impugned action of terminating the services of the petitioners
is illegal and contrary to the principle laid in the aforesaid decisions. Therefore, this Court is of the
considered opinion that once the order passed by the respondents is stigmatic in nature, the
petitioners will certainly not get any job in future on account of stigmatic order. This Court is of the
opinion that in all fairness, an opportunity of hearing should have been granted to the petitioners
while terminating their services and thereafter, they should have taken appropriate action in
accordance with law.
14. In the present case, it is not disputed that respondent/BBMP have not resorted to initiate any
domestic enquiry before passing orders of termination/dismissal dated *08.09.2010 and
*29.10.2010 respectively. Merely issuing notice for which petitioners have denied the alleged
allegations, in such circumstances domestic inquiry is warranted.
15. Resultantly, the orders dated 08.09.2010 and 29.10.2010 vide Annexure - G to the respective
petitions are quashed. The Writ Petitions are *Corrected vide Court Order Dated 02.11.2020
allowed. Liberty to initiate disciplinary proceedings is not warranted for the reasons that during
pendency of these petitions, petitioners services were regularized. Faced with Lokayukta initiated
disciplinary proceedings, which are the subject matter before this Court in W.P.Nos.61697/2016 and
48384/2017 and petitions are pending consideration.
With the aforesaid, both the petitions stand allowed.
