1. Heard Sri Pradeep Kumar Rai, assisted by Sri Mahesh Kumar Dubey, learned counsel for the
petitioner, Ms. Noori Ullah, learned counsel for respondent no.4 and the learned standing counsel
for the state-respondents.
2. Brief facts of the case are that the petitioner and respondent no.4 are real brothers. A partition
suit under Section 176 of The Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950
(hereinafter referred to as the "U.P. Z.A. & L.R. Act") was filed by respondent no.4-Shiv Shanker,

Jata Shankar vs Board Of Revenue U.P. And 3 Others on 3 March, 2025
Divisional Officer passed the order dated 21.5.2015 that delay condonation matter and restoration
matter shall be heard together. Revision filed by the petitioner against the order dated 21.5.2015 has
been dismissed by Board of Revenue vide order dated 16.5.2016 and the review application has also
been dismissed on 24.8.2017. Hence, this writ petition for the following relief:-
"Issue a writ, order or direction in the nature of certiorari, quashing the impugned
order dated 24.8.2017 passed by respondent no.1 in Review Application
No.1036/2016 (Annexure No.11) and also stay the effect and operation of the order
dated 16.5.2016 passed by respondent no.1 in Revision No.1941 of 2015 (Annexure
No.9) and also stay the effect and operation of the order dated 21.5.2015 passed by
respondent no.2 in Case No.25/2015 (Annexure No.7) under Section 176 of the U.P.
Z.A. & L.R. Act."
3. This Court entertained the matter and interim order was granted on 23.4.2018, staying the
proceeding of the case before the Sub Divisional Officer. In pursuance of the order dated 23.4.2018,
parties have exchanged their affidavits.
4. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that preliminary decree and final decree were
prepared, following the provisions of the U.P. Z.A. & L.R. Act and the Rules framed thereunder, as
such, the time-barred restoration application filed by respondent no.4 is abuse of process of law. He
submitted that objection was filed on behalf of the petitioner in time-barred restoration/recall
application with the prayer that delay condonation matter should be heard and disposed of 1st but
the objection/application of the petitioner has not been considered in proper manner and revision
has also been dismissed in arbitrary manner. He placed reliance on the decision of this Court
reported in 2022 (155) R.D.309, Ram Prakash vs. Deputy Director of Consolidation and Others, in
support of his arguments.
5. On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent no.4 submitted that restoration/recall
application was filed in proper manner, as such, the objection filed on behalf of the petitioner in the
restoration/delay condonation matter, cannot be allowed. She submitted that Kurra has been
prepared in arbitrary manner by the Lekhpal and without affording opportunity of hearing to the
petitioner, the impugned preliminary and final decree have been prepared. She submitted that the
writ petition filed by the petitioner should be dismissed and direction be issued to decide the
time-barred restoration application in accordance with law expeditiously.
6. I have considered the arguments advanced by learned counsel for the parties and perused the
records.
7. There is no dispute about the fact that the preliminary decree and final decree has been passed by
the court in the proceeding under Section 176 of the U.P. Z.A. & L.R. Act. There is also no dispute
about the fact that a time-barred restoration/recall application filed on behalf of respondent no.4 is
pending before respondent no.2/S.D.M., Lalganj, Mirzapur.

8. This Court in the case of Ram Prakash (supra) has held that in time-barred proceeding, the delay
condonation matter should be decided 1st in accordance with law. Paragraph Nos. 19, 20, 21, 22 and
23 of the judgment rendered in Ram Prakash (Supra) will be relevant which are as follows:-
"19. We are not going into the issue as to whether an order passed by appellate
authority on an application seeking condonation of delay is an interim order or final
as the same has not been referred for consideration by the Division Bench. Different
situations may arise in an appeal filed along with application seeking condonation of
delay. Firstly, the application for seeking condonation of delay may be dismissed. As
a consequence thereof, the appeal will also fail. Another situation may be that
application seeking condonation of delay is allowed and thereafter the appeal may
either be accepted or rejected.
20. If any statute provides certain period for filing of appeal, an appeal filed beyond
the time limit will certainly be not entertained. If the provisions of 1963 Act are
applicable and party is entitled to seek condonation of delay in filing appeal, an
application has to be filed specifying the grounds on which delay in filing the appeal
is sought to be condoned. It is only after that the application is allowed, the appeal
can be entertained and heard on merits. Before that the appeal cannot be taken up
and considered on merits.
21. As far as the issue regarding hearing of the application seeking condonation of
delay and the appeal simultaneously is concerned, in our view, firstly the application
has to be considered. Only thereafter, the appeal can be considered on merits but
there is nothing in law which requires hearing of appeal on merits to be postponed
mandatorily after acceptance of the application seeking condonation of delay. Both
can be taken up on the same day. However, the appeal has to be heard on merits only
after the application seeking condonation of delay has been accepted.
22. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we answer the question referred to the
Division Bench that an application seeking condonation of delay has to be decided
first before the appeal is taken up for hearing on merits. However, it can be on the
same day and there is no requirement of adjourning the hearing of appeal on merits
after acceptance of the application seeking condonation of delay.
23. Let the matter be listed before learned Single Judge as per roster for further
proceedings in the case."
9. In the instant matter, restoration application dated 20.3.2014 filed by respondent no.4 is
time-barred, as such, Sub Divisional Officer should consider and decide the delay condonation
matter by passing proper order for delay condonation/refusal as well as proper order should be
passed on the restoration application but there is no hindrance to pass the order on delay
condonation as well as restoration application on the same day.

10. Considering the entire facts and circumstances of the case, without expressing any opinion on
the merits of the case, this petition is disposed of with the direction to respondent no.2/S.D.M.,
Lalganj, Mirzapur to decide the time-barred restoration application of respondent no.4, in the light
of the ratio of law laid down in the case of Ram Prakash (supra), as expeditiously as possible,
preferably within a period of 4 months, from the date of production of a certified copy of this order
before the authority concerned, after affording proper opportunity of hearing to the parties
concerned, in accordance with law.
