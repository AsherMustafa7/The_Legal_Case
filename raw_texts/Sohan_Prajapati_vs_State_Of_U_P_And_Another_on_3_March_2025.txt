Sohan Prajapati vs State Of U.P. And Another on 3 March, 2025
4. Learned counsel for the appellant submits that initially appellant was challaned for offences
under Sections 302, 201, 506 I.P.C. but during investigation when he was also made accused under
the provisions of Sections 3(2)(V) of S.C./S.T. Act then he filed separate bail application for offences
under Sections 3(2)(V) of S.C./S.T. Act but learned Special Judge, S.C./S.T. Act, Jaunpur dismissed
his bail application on 12.11.2024.
5. She further submits that order dated 12.11.2024 passed by Special Judge, S.C./S.T. Act, Jaunpur
is illegal as without considering the provisions of S.C./S.T. Act, he dismissed the bail application of
appellant in the instant matter merely on the ground that for offence under Section 302 I.P.C. his
bail application has already been dismissed.
6. She further submits that even from the entire material available on record, it could not be
reflected, appellant committed offence under Sections 3(2)(V) of S.C./S.T. Act.
7. She further submits that after considering the entire facts of the case in detail, the bail application
of the appellant for offences under Sections 302, 201, 506 I.P.C. has already been allowed by this
Court today i.e. vide order dated 03.03.2025 passed in Criminal Misc. Bail Application No.17894 of
2024 and therefore, order dated 12.11.2024 is liable to be set aside and appellant should also be
released on bail for offences under Sections 3(2)(V) of S.C./S.T. Act.
8. Per contra, learned AGA however opposed the prayer for bail but could not dispute the fact that
during investigation, offence under Sections 3(2)(V) of S.C./S.T. Act has been added and bail
application of the appellant for offences under Sections 302, 201, 506 I.P.C. has already been
allowed by this Court today i.e. vide order dated 03.03.2025.
9. I have heard learned counsel for both the parties and perused the record of the case.
10. From perusal of the record, it reflects that initially appellant was challaned for offences under
Sections 302, 201, 506 I.P.C. but during investigation offence under Sections 3(2)(V) of S.C./S.T.
Act has been added and when he filed the bail application for offences under Sections 3(2)(V) of
S.C./S.T. Act then learned Special Judge, S.C./S.T. Act dismissed his bail application on 12.11.2024
for added offence and therefore, the instant criminal appeal has been filed before this Court under
the provisions of S.C./S.T. Act against the order dated 12.11.2024.
11. From the impugned order dated 12.11.2024, it reflects, court concerned failed to consider the fact
that appellant sought bail for the offence under Sections 3(2)(V) of S.C./S.T. Act and it appears,
learned court concerned rejected the bail application of the appellant on the ground that his bail
application for offences under Sections 302, 201, 506 I.P.C. has already been rejected. Considering
this fact the argument advanced by learned counsel for the appellant that order dated 12.11.2024 is
illegal, cannot be brushed aside.
12. Further, even the bail application of the appellant for offences under Sections 302, 201, 506
I.P.C. has already been allowed by this Court today with a detailed order i.e. vide order dated
03.03.2025.
