Shivamma And Ors vs The Special Land Acquisition Officer & ... on 16 January, 2020
Admission this day, Narendar J., delivered the following:
JUDGMENT
Heard the learned counsel for the Cross- objectors and the learned Additional Government
Advocate for the State.
2. All the cross-objections and appeals are taken up together for disposal by this common judgment.
3. Cross-objectors are the claimants before the reference Court in LAC Nos.31/2012, 33/2012 and
34/2012, respectively, which are disposed of by the judgment and award by the Court of the Senior
Civil Judge and JMFC, Indi.
4. The learned Additional Government Advocate places reliance on two judgments passed by a
Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in MFA No.200630/2016 and connected appeals and MFA
No.200626/2016.
5. The cross-objectors being the land losers are before this Court being aggrieved by the judgment
and award of the Court of the Senior Civil Judge and JMFC, Indi rendered in LAC No.31/2012, LAC
No.33/2012 and LAC No.34/2012 and thereby the reference Court has been pleased to determine
and award a compensation at the rate of Rs.3,52,000/- per acre in LAC No.31/2012 & LAC
No.33/2012, and in LAC No.34/2012, compensation at the rate of Rs.2,41,000/- per acre has been
awarded in respect of irrigated lands and while doing so the reference Court has placed reliance on
the judgment rendered by a Co- ordinate Bench of this Court in MFA No.2020/2005.
6. It is the case of the cross-
objectors/claimants that in the light of the judgment rendered in MFA No.31613/2012 and
connected appeals, the cross-objectors are entitled to compensation at the rate of Rs.4,15,000/- per
acre for irrigated land and would also place reliance on the judgment of the Co-ordinate Benches
rendered in batch of appeals arising out of the acquisition of lands for the said project.
7. Per contra, learned Additional Government Advocate would submit that the lands involved in
those appeals are situated in Afzalpur Taluk and the lands of the claimants are situated in Indi
Taluk. Though they are acquired for the same project, it cannot be gainfully argued that the lands
are to be valued accordingly. She would further submit that the reliance placed by the reference
Court on the judgment rendered in MFA No.2020/2005 is inappropriate as neither of the parties
placed reliance on the same and that the lands in question therein had been acquired for a different
project and are situated in a different village. The said contention is not countered by the learned
counsel for the cross-objectors.
8. Furthermore, it is seen that though the respondents have remained exparte certain documents
appears to have been marked on their behalf viz., Exs.R.1 and 2. It is further submitted that the
beneficiary i.e., the Karnataka Neeravari Nigama Limited has also not been arrayed as a party and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/28181712/ 8
Shivamma And Ors vs The Special Land Acquisition Officer & ... on 16 January, 2020
that the beneficiary is a necessary party in view of the law laid down by the Apex Court.
9. We are of the considered opinion that the matter requires to be re-appreciated by the reference
Court in the light of the materials produced by the cross-objectors / land losers. As rightly
contended by the learned Additional Government Advocate, the reference Court has erred in placing
reliance on the judgment of this Court rendered in MFA No.2020/2005 as it was neither the case of
the claimants or the respondent authorities that the lands which are the subject matter of the
reference are similarly situated as the lands involved in MFA No.2020/2005. The reference Court is
required to address the issue with reference to the materials placed before it. The reference Court
having omitted to do so, the judgments and awards stand vitiated and accordingly are set aside.
The matter is remitted to the reference Court. The parties shall appear before the reference Court on
12.02.2020 without waiting for any notice from the Court.
In view of the order of remand, the cross- objectors/claimants shall be entitled for refund of entire
Court fee.
The cross-objections and the appeals stand disposed of.
Pending IAs preferred by the State do not survive for consideration, accordingly they stand disposed
off.
