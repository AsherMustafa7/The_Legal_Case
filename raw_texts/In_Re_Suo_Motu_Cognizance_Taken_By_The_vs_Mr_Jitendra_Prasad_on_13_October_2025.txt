In-Re, Suo Motu Cognizance Taken By The ... vs Mr. Jitendra Prasad on 13 October, 2025
initiated Civil/Criminal contempt proceeding against him. In his
reference, the learned ADJ-IV found that that the contemnor

2/5
willfully and willingly disobeyed the order dated 26.07.2019 of
the learned court of CJM, Bhojpur. The contemnor also
disobeyed the orders dated 24.06.2021, 13.07.2021, 17.07.2021
and 28.07.2021 in Sessions Trial No. 242 of 2019. The learned
ADJ-IV also informs that previously the court of learned ADJ-
IV had warned the contemnor for not obeying the order of the
Court. A judicial order was passed in ABP No. 2871 of 2020
dated 05.02.2021 and requested the learned District & Sessions
Judge, Bhojpur at Ara for taking disciplinary action against the
contemnor which is still pending for preliminary inquiry and the
same is being conducted by ADJ-I, Ara. In his report, learned
ADJ-IV also informed that the learned CJM, Bhojpur had
directed to the office clerk to open the supplementary record
against the absent accused, namely, Parvati Devi and Krishna
Singh in the record of Ara Muffasil P.S. Case No. 86 of 2017 but
the contemnor with his vested interest has not open the split up
record and disobeyed and disowned the order of the court in the
favour of absent accused, namely, Parvati Devi and Krishna
Singh.
3. Vide order dated 23.07.2025, a notice has been
issued to the contemnor. He has appeared through his counsel
and also filed show cause stating therein that in fact, the order

3/5
dated 26.07.2019 was passed by the learned CJM, Bhojpur and
after the inquiry the learned ADJ-IV, Bhojpur had recommended
for initiating the contempt proceeding against the contemnor.
4. Learned counsel for the contemnor/opposite
party tenders absolute and unconditional apology for the
inconvenience caused to this Court. He further submits that the
contemnor/opposite party is charged with contempt of the Sub-
ordinate Court for not having complied with the judicial order
dated 26.07.2019 for opening of the supplementary records
against the absconding accused, namely, Parvati Devi and
Krishna Singh in connection with Ara Muffasil P.S. Case No. 86
of 2017. The direction for opening up supplementary records
either could not be complied with on account of pressure of
work of the contemnor/opposite party or the records after
having been created got misplaced and the same was not
deliberate or due to any undue considerations. Even in the
preliminary inquiry conducted by the learned District &
Additional Sessions Judge-IV, Bhojpur, no material has surfaced
which could imply any deliberate act of not opening of the
supplementary records by the contemnor/opposite party or in
misplacement of the supplementary records if opened.
5. Learned counsel for the contemnor/opposite

party submits that there is no material on the record to indicate
that the contemnor would deliberately or due to some undue
considerations failed to create the supplementary records or the
same were deliberately misplaced and that the same was not due
to administrative lapses.
6. Sofar as the allegation of misplacement of bail
order in the records of Koilwar P.S. Case No. 451 of 2020,
Barhara P.S. Case No. 200 of 2019 and non-timely supply of the
records of Koilwar P.S. Case No. 373 of 2017 in ABP No. 1006
of 2020 were inquired by learned District and Additional
Sessions Judge, I, Bhojpur in administrative side and the
contemnor/opposite party has been exonerated vide report dated
03.03.2022
which has been accepted on 08.03.2022 (Annexure-
2) by the learned District Judge, Bhojpur.
7. As far as non-creation or misplacement of the supplementary records of Ara Muffasil P.S. Case
No. 86 of 2017 is concerned, the same has not been deliberate rather due to bona fide oversight and
inadvertence.
8. Learned counsel for the contemnor/opposite party has filed a supplementary affidavit stating
therein that no criminal or departmental proceeding with respect to the Patna High Court MJC
No.1504 of 2022 dt.13-10-2025 allegation in question giving rise to the present proceeding is
pending against the contemnor/opposite party. Even no criminal or departmental proceeding is
pending against the contemnor/opposite party.
9. We have perused the records and we have also accepted the show cause filed on behalf of the
contemnor/opposite party and drop the present proceeding.
10. No further order is required to be passed in the present matter.
11. Accordingly, the present contempt petition stands disposed of.
