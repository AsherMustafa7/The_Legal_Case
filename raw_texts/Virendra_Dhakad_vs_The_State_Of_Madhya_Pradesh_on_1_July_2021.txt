respondent/State.
Case Diary is perused.
Learned counsel for the rival parties are heard. The applicant has filed this first application under
Section 439 of Cr.P.C., for grant of bail. The applicant has been arrested on 09/06/2021 by Police
Station- Bahodapur, District- Gwalior (M.P.) in connection with Crime No.325/2021 for the offence
punishable under Sections 269 and 270 of IPC and Sections 53 and 57 of Disaster Management Act
and Section 3 of Epidemic Diseases Act and Sections 3/7 of Essential Commodities Act, 1955 and
Sections 5 and 13 of M.P. Drugs Control Act, 1949.
Prosecution story, in short, is that the complainant's relative was found to be Corona positive and he
was in need of Remdesivir injection. The complainant searched the said Remdesivir injection in the
market and between the same, the complainant met the co-accused-Chhotu Parihar who claimed
that he was medical representative and could arrange the said two Remdesivir injections at
Rs.12,000/- and the HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH, BENCH AT GWALIOR
MCRC-32527-2021 (Virendra Dhakad Vs. State of M.P.) complainant agreed and both of them
decided to meet at Bahodapur Chauraha where the co-accused told the complainant that the
applicant and another co-accused- Deepak are also medical representatives and they had strong
connections in many hospitals and through the same connections, he could make available him two
Remdesivir injections. Later on, the complainant gave cash of Rs.4,000/- to the co-accused Chhotu
Parihar in advance and co-accused Chhotu Parihar handed over two Remdesivir injections the
complainant with a promise that remaining amount would be paid later. Thereafter, the
complainant lodged the FIR to the effect that black marketing of Remdesivir injections is being

made by the applicant and other co-accused persons. On the basis of aforesaid, crime has been
registered against the applicant.
Learned counsel for the applicant submits that the applicant is aged about 33 years and he has been
falsely implicated in this case. He is in custody since 09/06/2021. Investigation is at the verge of
completion. It is further submitted that the applicant has been implicated in the case on the basis of
memorandum of co-accused recorded under Section 27 of Evidence Act which has no evidentiary
value and no recovery has been made from the applicant. It is further submitted that there is no eye-
witness who saw the applicant to hand over the said injections to the complainant. Name of the
applicant does not find place in the FIR.
HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH, BENCH AT GWALIOR MCRC-32527-2021 (Virendra
Dhakad Vs. State of M.P.) Learned counsel for the applicant submits that in view of outbreak of
COVID-19, detention of applicant in already congested prisons may be detrimental. The applicant is
permanent resident of District- Sheopur (M.P.) and there is no likelihood of his absconsion or
tampering with the prosecution evidence. The applicant is ready to abide by all the terms and
conditions as may be imposed. With the aforesaid submissions, prayer for grant of bail is made out.
On the other hand, learned Public Prosecutor opposed the application and prayed for its rejection by
contending that on the basis of the allegations and material available on record, no case for grant of
bail is made out. It is further submitted that the applicant and co-accused Chhotu belong to the
same village and they are medical representatives and all the three accused were making black
marketing of the said injections and earning money when the people were in crisis. The applicant
and other co-accused persons played active role in the offence, therefore, prayer for rejection of the
bail application is made.
However, it would not be desirable to enter into the merits of the rival contentions at this juncture.
Considering the overall facts and circumstances of the case coupled with the fact that trial is not
likely to conclude in near future and prolonged pre-trial detention being an anathema to the concept
of liberty, HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH, BENCH AT GWALIOR MCRC-32527-2021
(Virendra Dhakad Vs. State of M.P.) this Court is inclined to extend the benefit of bail to the
applicant.
Accordingly, without expressing any opinion on merits of the case, this application is allowed and it
is directed that the applicant be released on bail on furnishing a personal bond in the sum of
Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees One Lac Only) with two local solvent sureties each of Rs.50,000/- to the
satisfaction of the trial Court for his appearance on the dates given by the concerned Court. The
applicant shall also furnish a written undertaking before the concerned Court that he will abide by
all the terms and conditions of various circulars, as well as, orders issued by the Central
Government, State Government and local administration from time to time such as maintaining
social distancing, physical distancing, hygiene etc. to avoid proliferation of Corona virus.
This order will remain operative subject to compliance of the following conditions by the applicant:-
