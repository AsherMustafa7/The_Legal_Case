Hon'ble Salil Kumar Rai,J.
Heard the counsel for the applicant and Shri Bal Mukund, Advocate, representing the opposite
parties. The present contempt application has been filed pleading willful disobedience of the order
dated 10.9.2024 passed by this Court in Writ-A No. 11760 of 2024. Compliance affidavit has been
filed on behalf of the opposite parties showing that the amount due to the applicant as G.P.F. has
already been paid to him. Counsel for the applicant argues that the amount paid to the applicant is
not in accordance with the order dated 10.9.2024 passed by this Court inasmuch as 18% interest has
not been paid to the applicant on the G.P.F. amount. The contention of the counsel for the applicant
is not accepted.

The order dated 10.9.2024 passed by this Court in Writ-A No. 11760 of 2024 is reproduced below :-
"1. Heard learned counsel for the parties.
2. By means of this petition filed under Article 226 of Constitution of India the
petitioner has prayed for following relief:
"i) Issue a writ, order or direction in the nature of MANDAMUS commanding the
respondent authorities to release the remaining 10% General Provident Fund along
with 18% interest in favour of petitioner."
3. Sri Bal Mukund, learned counsel for the respondent no.3 states that 10 per cent of the General
Provident Fund amount alongwith interest has already been directed to be paid by the authority vide
letter issued on 13.08.2024.
4. In view of the above this petition stands disposed of with direction to the respondent authorities
to ensure that the General Provident Fund amount as asked for by the petitioner shall be
transmitted into his account within a period of 30 days from today alongwith interest." A reading of
the order dated 10.9.2024 shows that the interest amount has not been specified by this Court. The
mere phrase 'as asked for by the petitioner' does not imply that the claim of the applicant for 18%
interest has also been accepted and certified by this Court. In any case, there is ambiguity in the
order, which persuade the Court to hold that any willful disobedience of any order passed by this
Court can not be imputed to the opposite parties. The contempt application is dismissed.
Notices are discharged.
Let the file be consigned to record.
