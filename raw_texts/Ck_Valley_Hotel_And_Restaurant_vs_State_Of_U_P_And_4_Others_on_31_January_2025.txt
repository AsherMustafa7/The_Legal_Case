within stipulated period)."
2. The impugned orders were passed against the petitioner under Sections 27(1) and 28-A of the
U.P. Urban Planning and Development Act, 1973.
3. Sri D.S. Chauhan, learned counsel for the respondent-Development Authority, points out that in
fact the instant petition is second petition for the same reliefs. He has invited our attention towards
an order dated 16.7.2024 passed in Writ - C No. 22519 of 2024, whereby the petitioner-firm
challenged the same orders by filing a writ petition in the name of its proprietor Mohd. Chand. The
said writ petition was disposed of by this Court by providing that the stay application would be
decided by the appellate authority in the appeal filed by the petitioner challenging the impugned
orders within a specified time and till the disposal of the stay application, the parties were directed
to maintain status quo. He submits that the appeal is still pending and as such, the instant petition
by which relief has been claimed by the petitioner for quashing of the same orders, is in fact, a
second petition and in para 1 of the writ petition, it has been wrongly mentioned that it is first writ
petition on behalf of the petitioner.
4. Sri B.N. Mishra, learned counsel for the petitioner, submits at this stage that the petitioner will
not repeat the same mistake and his action may be condoned and he prays for dismissal of the
instant petition as not pressed.
5. Accordingly, the petition is dismissed as not pressed.
