and Mr. Albert Keisham, learned counsel, representing Mr. H. Kenajit, learned counsel for the
respondents. [3] As the Sole Arbitrator appointed earlier expired before conclusion of the
arbitration proceedings and as it is stated that the claims of the petitioner, arising under the subject
agreement dated 02.11.2009, would be in the range of (cid:128). 112 Crore, it would be appropriate that a
former learned Judge of the Supreme Court undertakes and continues the arbitration proceedings to
settle the disputes between the parties.

Crest, Nirvana Country, Sector 50, South City Phase 2, Gurugaram-122018 (email :

Further, as the former Sole Arbitrator passed away on 20.04.2022 and the arbitration proceedings
remained stalled Arb.P. (J2) No. 2 of 2022 Page 2 thereafter, the period of time from 20.04.2022 till
the date of the first arbitration hearing by the newly appointed Sole Arbitrator shall be excluded
while reckoning the time stipulated under Section 29-A of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,
1996, for making of the arbitration award. The proceedings of the arbitration and all other matters
incidental thereto shall be governed by the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
