which has been affirmed in SLP(C) Diary No.30806 of 2018 and Chandra Nandi vrs. State of Odisha

4. The factual matrix, in brief, is that the Petitioner had initially joined on DLR basis during 1992 in
the office of Assistant Executive Engineer, Nurtanga Irrigation Sub-Division, Jagatpur. Thereafter,
he was brought over to work charged establishment on 9.10.2009 under Annexure-2.
5. Learned counsel for the Petitioner submits that the Opposite Party No.3 should have kept in mind
the Finance Department Resolution and the order of the Hon'ble Apex Court while rejecting // 3 //
the representation of the Petitioner and also taken into consideration the length of service rendered
by the Petitioner in the establishment being a work charged employee and continuous service.
6. It is stated by the learned Additional Government Advocate appearing for the State-Opposite
Parties that the claim of the Petitioner is a stale claim. Further it is submitted that the cases cited by
the Petitioner are different from the grievance of the Petitioner and the principle decided in the said
case are not all applicable to the case of the present Petitioner. It is submitted by the learned counsel
appearing for the State that the Opposite Party No.3 has given due care and caution towards
implementation of order passed by this Court as well as the Apex Court and the guidelines and
circulars issued by the State Government from time to time.
7. Heard learned counsel for both the sides. Perused the materials available on record. Learned
counsel for the Petitioner relies upon the judgment of this Court in the case of Abhaya Charan
Mohanty vs. State of Odisha, WPC(OAC) No.3494 of 2013 disposed of on 14th July, 2021. In the said
case, the Petitioner, who was a work-charged employee, had claimed the pensionary benefits after
his retirement with retrospective effect. This Court relying upon the order of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court of India in Civil Appeal No.21498 of 2012 thereby dismissing the State Government's Appeal
and confirming the order dated 19th December, 2011 of this Court passed in W.P.(C) No.5377 of
2010 in the case of one Narusu Pradhan vs. State of Odisha allowed the writ petition and granted
pensionary benefits as prayed for in that case.
8. Similarly, learned counsel for the Petitioner has also cited another order of a Division Bench of
this Court in the case of // 4 // Chandra Nandi vs. State of Odisha and others, reported in 2014(I)
OLR 734. In the said reported case, this Court had given a direction to notionally regularize service
of the Petitioner prior to his superannuation from service and, accordingly, calculated the
Petitioner's entitlement including the pensionary benefits.

9. So far the case of one Narusu Pradhan is concerned and which has been referred to by this Court
in Abhaya Charan Mohanty (supra), said Narusu Pradhan had filed O.A. No.1189(C) of 2006
praying for retiral benefits. Learned Tribunal allowed the retiral pensionary benefits in his favour
vide order dated 11th June, 2009. The order dated 19th June, 2009 was challenged by the State
Government before this Court in W.P.(C) No.5377 of 2010. This Court dismissed the writ petition on
19th December, 2021 and confirmed the order passed by the learned Tribunal. Therefore, the State
Government preferred an appeal before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India bearing Civil Appeal
No.22498 of 2012. The said appeal was also dismissed on 7th January, 2013 by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court of India thereby confirming the orders passed by the learned Odisha Administrative
Tribunal as well as this Court. Since the case of Narusu Pradhan is a case of work charged employee,
who had worked for more than five years in work charged establishment had been allowed to receive
pensionary benefits by virtue of order passed by the learned Odisha Administrative Tribunal, which
was ultimately confirmed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, the principle laid down in that
case has become a Law of the land as declared by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India and is binding
on this court while deciding cases of similar nature. Therefore, it is no more open to the State
Government to take a stand // 5 // contrary to the principle finally approved by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court of India.
10. The only benefit the Petitioner intends to get is his pensionary benefits payable to the Petitioner
i.e. required to be considered in the present writ petition. Since the benefits have been granted to
other similarly placed work charged employees by notionally considering them as regular
establishment employee and as such the pensionary benefits have been given to them, the same
benefit needs to be extended to the Petitioner for services rendered by him under the State
Government for several decades continuously that too on payment of a paltry amount every month.
The whole objective of the pension scheme is to support an employee and his family after retirement
which is in recognition of his relentless service to the Govt. and such benefits are provided under the
Rules on humanitarian considerations.
11. In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances, the present writ petition is allowed and the
Opposite Parties are directed to grant similar benefits to the Petitioner as has been done in the case
of Narusu Prahdan vide order dated 11th June, 2009 passed in O.A. No.1189(C) of 2006. The
Petitioner is directed to appear before the Opposite Parties No.1 & 3 along with the certified copy of
this order and all other relevant documents and records for the processing of his claim. The
Opposite Parties No.1 & 3 upon receipt of certified copy of this order shall calculate and pay the
benefits payable to the Petitioner, particularly his pensionary benefits, within a period of three
months from the date of production of a certified copy of this order.
12. With the aforesaid observation and direction the writ petition is // 6 // allowed. There shall be
no order as to cost.
Issue urgent certified copy as per rules.
