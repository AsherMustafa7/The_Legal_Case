JUDGMENT
The Appeal has been filed against the dismissal of the bail application in Crl.M.P.No.1781 of 2021,
dated 02.11.2021 passed by the learned Principal Sessions Judge, Dharmapuri.
2. The appellant, sole accused in the case in Crime No.422 of 2021 had been arrested by the
Respondent Police for the offence under Sections 294(b), 324, 341 & 506(ii) IPC read with Section

Amendment Act, 2015 registered by the respondent on the complaint of one Kumar. The appellant
was arrested on 22.9.2021.
3. The case of the prosecution is as under:-
The de facto complainant is a resident of Chekkumedu Village and that he has got two
sons and two daughters and that he is working as a driver in a School. His son
Ilantamil and one Pandian are neighbours and that his son is working as Cleaner in
the Tata Ace driven by Pandian. Whileso, the said Pandian had eloped with one
Renuka on 20.9.2021. The accused, who had suspected that the de
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis facto complainant's son Ilantamil had helped the
said Pandian in the elopement, had gone to his house and abused him calling his
caste name and assaulted him with iron rod causing fracture in his ankle. By that
time, the neighbours had intervened and separated, however, the accused had
threatened to do away with him and thereby, the de facto complainant had lodged a
complaint and as a result, the appellant/accused was arrested by the respondent
police. The appellant had filed a Crl.M.P.No.1781 of 2021 seeking for bail before the
Principal Sessions Judge, Dharmapuri and the Court, by order dated 2.11.2021,
dismissed the bail application against which the present Appeal has been filed.
4. Mr.N.Ponraj, learned counsel appearing for the appellant submitted that it is a case and counter
case. He would submit that the de facto complainant's son Ilantamil and his friend Pandian had
kidnapped the sister of one Vinoth, who is a relative of the appellant and when the said Vinoth had
gone to the house of the de facto complainant on 21.9.2021 in search of his sister, the de facto
complainant had assaulted him with iron rod and thereby the said Vinoth had sustained injuries and
had been admitted in the Government Hospital, Pennagaram. He would also submit that the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis appellant being a Law Student and relative of Vinoth, had
preferred a complaint against the de facto complainant and his family members in respect of which
a case in Crime No.421 of 2021 was registered by the respondent. He would submit that in the said

earlier incident, the de facto complainant had also sustained injuries and taking advantage of that,
the de facto complainant had foisted a complaint against the appellant. He would further submit
that the present complaint has been given only to prevent the appellant from helping the family
members of Vinoth.
5. The learned counsel for the appellant further submitted that the appellant had been in custody
from 22.9.2021 and the de facto complainant has been discharged on 13.10.2021. He would further
submit that the appellant has no previous case against him and the present complaint is only an
offshoot against the earlier complaint given by him.
6. Mr.S.Sugendran, learned Government Advocate (Criminal Side) appearing for respondents 1 and
2 would submit that the appellant is a relative of one Vinoth and the said Vinoth's sister Renuka had
eloped with one Pandian. Suspecting that the son of the de facto https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
complainant had assisted the said Pandian in the elopement, the accused had gone to the house of
the de facto complainant and abused him by calling by his caste name and had also assaulted him
with an iron rod due to which, the de facto complainant had suffered a fracture in his right ankle. He
would further submit that the de facto complainant has been discharged from the Hospital on
13.10.2021. He would submit that the appellant is a Law College Student and that he has no previous
cases against him.

list, there is no appearance for the third respondent.
