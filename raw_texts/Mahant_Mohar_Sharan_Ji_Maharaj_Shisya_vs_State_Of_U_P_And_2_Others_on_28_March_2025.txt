Mahant Mohar Sharan Ji Maharaj Shisya ... vs State Of U.P. And 2 Others on 28 March, 2025
2. Present petition has been preferred with the prayer to issue an order or direction in appropriate
nature setting aside the impugned order dated 04.03.2024 and 26.09.2024 passed by authority
concerned respectively in Case no. 26 of 2009-2010 (Mahant Ji Lalita Sharan vs. Radha Charan
Das) under Section 145/146 Cr.P.C. and in Criminal Revision no. 154/2024 (Mahant Mohar Sharan
Das Ji vs. State of U.P. and others).
Facts of the Case
3. Learned counsel for petitioner submitted that petitioner is Mahant of Van Vihar Ashram,
Vrindavan Mathura situated at Khasra no. 199 (199 Ka) and respondent no. 2 is Mahant of Topi
Kunj Ashram, Vrindavan, Mathura which is existing on khasra no. 197. On dated 20.06.2005, the
concerned Station House Officer, Vrindavan, Mathura with the collusion of contesting respondent
no. 2 submitted a false report in the court of respondent no. 3/City Magistrate, Mathura alleging
that there is apprehension of breach of peace amongst Lalita Sharan on one hand and Radha Charan
(predecessor of petitioner) on other hand with respect to Khasra no. 199 hence report under Section
145 Cr.P.C. is submitted for attachment of the same. Vide order dated 27.06.2005 respondent no. 3,
passed preliminary order under Section 145/146 Cr.P.C. On dated 07.07.2005, respondent no. 3
after considering the objection raised by the counsel for the predecessor of the petitioner as well as
correct situation and fact of the case, stayed the operation of order dated 27.06.2005 passed under
Section 146(1) Cr.P.C. A perusal of order dated 07.07.2005 would show that respondent no. 3,
categorically held that from the police report, the possibility is that over the land in dispute the
second party (predecessor of petitioner) was in possession. Against order dated 07.07.2005,
respondent no. 2 filed Criminal Revision before learned Session Judge, Mathura which was
dismissed vide order dated 05.12.2005. Against order dated 05.12.2005, respondent no. 2 filed
application u/s 482 of Cr.P.C. no. 130 of 2006 before this Court which was dismissed vide order
dated 13.02.2017.
4. It is next submitted that after the order dated 07.07.2005, proceedings under Section 145 Cr.P.C.
came to an end and no further similar application for proceedings under Section 145(1) Cr.P.C is
maintainable at the behest of respondent no. 2. By concealing the earlier order passed so far,
respondent no. 2 again on dated 23.12.2005 and 15.12.2006 filed fresh applications for attachment
of the property in dispute. After expiry of about one and half year from last application dated
15.12.2006, the Station House Officer, Vrindavan, Mathura submitted a false and illegal report
dated 06.06.2008 before the court of respondent no. 3. On dated 10.06.2008, respondent no. 3
passed the order by which earlier order dated 07.07.2005 was set aside and and the concerned
police was directed for compliance of order dated 27.06.2005. The order dated 10.06.2008 amounts
to review of the earlier orders which is beyond the jurisdiction. It is clear that respondent no. 3,
acted beyond jurisdiction in passing the order dated 10.06.2008 which resulted into revival of order
dated 27.06.2005 which had already became redundant due to subsequent orders dated 05.12.2005
and 05.01.2006. By order of respondent no. 3, the property was attached on dated 11.06.2008 and
order dated 27.06.2005 has been enforced. However, in the attachment memo, it is clearly
mentioned that possession of the property has been taken from possession of Mahant Govind
Sharan (predecessor of petitioner).

5. Against the order dated 10.06.2008, petitioner preferred Criminal Revision no. 412 of 2008
before the Court of learned Session Judge, Mathura which has been allowed vide order dated
04.07.2009 and order dated 10.06.2008 was set aside. Against the order dated 04.07.2009, passed
by learned Session Judge, Mathura, respondent no. 2 filed Criminal Misc. Writ Petition no. 13633 of
2009 and in the said petition vide order dated 08.09.2009 passed by this Court, it was directed to
maintain status quo. Due to order dated 08.09.2009 passed by this Court, the concerned police
refused to release the property in favour of Mahant Govind Sharan (predecessor of petitioner) from
whose possession the property was actually attached on dated 11.06.2008. Ultimately, the Writ
Petition no. 13633 of 2009 was dismissed in default vide order dated 23.08.2011 passed by this
Court.
6. It is further submitted that on dated 25.08.2011, respondent no. 2 filed application for recalling
the order dated 23.08.2011 passed by this Court. On dated 02.09.2011, respondent no. 3, directed
the withdrawal/recall of attachment order dated 27.06.2005 and 10.06.2008 passed by the
concerned City Magistrate and further fixed the date for hearing under Section 145 Cr.P.C. In
pursuance of order dated 02.09.2011, the concerned S.S.I, submitted a report dated 07.09.2011 for
handing over the possession of property to Mahant Govind Sharan (predecessor of petitioner).
Against order dated 02.09.2011, respondent no. 2 filed Revision no. 419 of 2011 before learned
Sessions Judge, Mathura which was dismissed vide order dated 14.09.2011. Vide order dated
02.01.2012 passed by this Court, the order dated 23.08.2011 whereby Criminal Misc. Writ Petition
no. 13633 of 2009 was dismissed for want of prosecution. Vide order dated 25.07.2012, respondent
no. 3 dismissed the application dated 24.09.2011, 30.09.2011 and 19.11.2011 and further closed the
proceedings under Section 145 Cr.P.C. Against the order dated 25.07.2012, respondent no. 2 filed
Revision no. 384 of 2012 which was partly allowed by learned Sessions Judge vide order dated
25.07.2013. By the said order, learned Sessions Judge, partly allowed the revision and direction was
issued to respondent no. 3 to decide the case in the light of observation given in the judgment.
Against the order dated 25.07.2013, predecessor of petitioner filed Criminal Misc. Writ Petition no.
15890 of 2013 before this Court. Vide order dated 07.08.2013 passed by this Court, operation of
order dated 25.07.2013 was stayed till next date of listing. In the said writ petition on behalf of
petitioner a substitution application on the death of Govind Sharan Ji Mahraj was filed which was
allowed and one Banwari Sharan was substituted in the writ petition as heir of Govind Sharan vide
order dated 06.09.2018. After the death of Banwari Sharan a substitution application was moved by
the present petitioner Mahant Mohar Sharan as heir of late Banwari Sharan. In the said substitution
application, counter affidavit was filed on behalf of respondent no. 2 and rejoinder was filed on
behalf of proposed heir of petitioner. On dated 17.05.2023, while hearing the said petition no. 15890
of 2013, this Court orally allowed the substitution application and as such allowed the petitioner's
counsel Atul Sharma for placing argument on behalf of petitioner. The petition has been finally
adjudicated by this Court after hearing the parties and vide order dated 12.10.2023 matter has been
remitted back to respondent no. 3 to adjudicate the question of possession. It was also directed that
till final decision, respondents were restrained from interference in the possession of the petitioner
over property in dispute and the aforesaid petition was disposed of. After the order dated 12.10.2023
respondent no. 3 passed the impugned order dated 04.03.2024, whereby learned Magistrate was
pleased to reject the application for substitution of present petitioner Mahant Mohar Sharan and
allowed the objection of opposite party no. 2 and directed the property in question be handed over

Mahant Mohar Sharan Ji Maharaj Shisya ... vs State Of U.P. And 2 Others on 28 March, 2025
to respondent no. 2. In pursuance of order dated 04.03.2024 passed by respondent no. 3, the
possession of entire property was handed over to respondent no. 2 on dated 12.03.2024.
Challenging the order dated 04.03.2024, petitioner filed a Revision no. 154 of 2024 before learned
Session Judge, Mathura but the same revision was also dismissed vide order dated 28.09.2024
passed by learned Additional Session Judge, Mathura. The present petition has been filed against
the order dated 04.03.2024 and 28.09.2024 passed by learned City Magistrate, Mathura and
learned Additional Session Judge, Mathura respectively.
Submission on behalf of petitioner
7. Firstly it is submitted that at page no. 200 of the instant petition in the Court's order dated
12.10.2023, it has wrongly been mentioned that "This is not disputed that in compliance of order
dated 11.06.2008, the attached property was handed over to Mahant Govind Sharan on dated
07.09.2011". After expiry of one and half year from last application dated 15.12.2006, the Station
House Officer Vrindavan, Mathura submitted a false & illegal report dated 06.06.2008 in the court
of respondent no. 3. The property was handed over to Govind Sharan Ji Mahraj on dated 07.09.2011
not in compliance of order dated 11.06.2008. In fact there is no order dated 11.06.2008. The
possession of property was again handed over the predecessor of petitioner on dated 07.09.2011 in
pursuance of order dated 02.09.2011. The co-ordinate Bench of this Court has taken a wrong view
that possession of property was handed over to the Mahant Govind Sharan Ji Maharaj on dated
07.09.2011 for the first time. In fact when the property was attached by attachment memo dated
11.06.2008, the property was found to be in possession of Mahant Govind Sharan Ji Maharaj and
the property was in fact attached from possession of Mahant Govind Sharan Ji Mahraj. It is
apparent that property in question was in actual possession of Mahant Govind Sharan Ji Maharaj
much prior to 07.09.2011. The finding to the contrary by co-ordinate Bench of this Court in order
dated 12.10.2023 is apparently wrong and perverse being against the records of the case. Aforesaid
finding of this Court in order dated 12.10.2023 has been followed and made basis of impugned
subsequent order dated 04.03.2024 passed by learned City Magistrate, Mathura and order dated
26.09.2024 passed by learned Additional Session Judge, Mathura. Thus the entire finding by
respondent no. 3 and revisional court are based on a finding of this Court which is apparently
incorrect, against the record and hence perverse.
8. It is next submitted that property was attached by the concerned police from the possession of
Mahant Govind Sharan (predecessor of petitioner) on dated 11.06.2008 first time in compliance of
order dated 10.06.2008 and further handed over to petitioner on dated 07.09.2011 in pursuance of
court's order. Thus, it cannot be said that petitioner came into possession first time on 07.09.2011.
In fact petitioner was in possession of property much prior to attachment on dated 11.06.2008.
Suffice to say that the report to the police regarding possession of property was submitted by
concerned police officer, which clearly indicates that respondent no. 2 was not in possession even on
dated 20.06.2005 on which date police submitted the report resulting into preliminary attachment
order dated 27.06.2005. It is submitted that Mahant Govind Sharan remained in possession of
property since prior to initiation of present proceeding in the year 2005. Petitioner remained in
possession till the property was attached on dated 11.06.2018. Thereafter, on dated 07.09.2011,
property again released in the possession of predecessor of petitioner. It is further submitted that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72902131/ 4
Mahant Mohar Sharan Ji Maharaj Shisya ... vs State Of U.P. And 2 Others on 28 March, 2025
since after 07.09.2011, till 04.03.2024 the petitioner remained in possession. It is only for the first
time that petitioner was dispossessed in pursuance to order dated 04.03.2024 passed by respondent
no. 3.
9. It is further submitted that while deciding the case under Section 145/146 Cr.P.C. there are two
main necessary ingredients:-
(a) Existence of a dispute likely to cause a breach of peace concerning the land and
(b) who was in possession on the date of passing of preliminary order under Section
145 Cr.P.C. and in case any party has been forcibly and wrongfully dispossess within
two months, next before the date of police report.
10. In the impugned orders there is no finding on both (a) and (b) points. The order of handing over
possession of property in dispute is contrary to provision of sub-section 6 of Section 145 Cr.P.C.
From the fact of present case, it is apparent and duly proved that prior to police report dated
20.06.2005, initiating the proceeding under Section 145 Cr.P.C., the petitioner and his ancestor
were in possession of property in question till the order dated 04.03.2024 passed by respondent no.
3. Without recording finding on actual possession as contemplated under Section 145 Cr.P.C,
present impugned orders cannot be allowed to stand and deserves to be set aside by this Court.
11. The nature and scope of Section 145 Cr.P.C. proceeding has been given in Hon'ble Supreme Court
judgment passed in M Siddiq (Ram Janam Bhumi Temple) vs. Suresh Das which is reported in
(2019) 18 SCR. 1 of said judgment. In view of said judgment impugned orders dated 04.03.2024 are
unsustainable in the eye of law. Further in the light of Sub Section (6) of Section 145 Cr.P.C., it is
submitted that it has come on record that property in question was attached on 11.06.2008 from
possession of predecessor of petitioner. The finding of de facto possession of petitioner on
08.09.2011 is clearly wrong and contrary to the attachment order dated 11.06.2008. In fact
petitioner was in de facto possession over the land in dispute on or before 11.06.2008. It is also well
established that at the time of final disposal of proceeding, the property should be restored to the
party from whose possession the property was actually attached by respondent no. 3. Since property
in question was attached on 11.06.2008, the property should have been restored to the petitioner.
The finding of both the courts that possession should be restored back to respondent is apparently
wrong and unsustainable. There is absolutely no evidence on record that contesting respondent no.
2 was ever in possession over the land in dispute and respondent was dispossessed by petitioner
before two months from date of preliminary order under Section 145/146 Cr.P.C. In view of fact that
four civil suits are pending between the same parties with respect to same land in dispute in regard
to possession and title, the proceeding under Section 145 Cr.P.C. were not maintainable.
Submission on behalf of respondent
12. Sri Manoj Kumar Srivastava, learned counsel for respondent no. 2 as well as learned AGA
vehemently opposed the prayer sought through the instant petition and rebutted the stand taken up
by learned counsel for petitioner by way of submitting that after considering each and every material
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72902131/ 5
Mahant Mohar Sharan Ji Maharaj Shisya ... vs State Of U.P. And 2 Others on 28 March, 2025
available on record, learned concerned court as well as learned revisional court passed the order
impugned and as such the same are just and proper, since the entire adjudication whatsoever has
been made by concerned City Magistrate as well as by learned Additional District and Sessions
Judge, Court no. 10, Mathura in Criminal Revision no. 154 of 2024 is on the basis of judgment
12.10.2023 passed by co-ordinate Bench of this Court in Criminal Misc. Writ Petition no. 15890 of
2013.
Observation and conclusion
13. After hearing rival submissions extended by learned counsels for the parties and perusing the
records, it transpires that vide order dated 12.10.2023 passed by co-ordinate Bench of this Court in
Criminal Misc. Writ Petition no. 15890 of 2013, it has been categorically settled that the property
was handed over to the petitioner i.e. Mahant Govind Saran Ji Maharaj on dated 07.09.2011 by the
concerned Police authority. The co-ordinate Bench of this Court also mentioned under para 26 of
the judgment dated 12.10.2023 that it is not disputed that Criminal Misc. Writ Petition no. 13633 of
2009 filed by Mahant Lalita Sharan was dismissed for want of prosecution on dated 23.08.2011 and
later on though restored no fresh order of status quo was passed. The property was handed over to
the instant petitioner meanwhile.
14. It is also clarified by co-ordinate Bench of this Court that now the question is whether handing
over of the possession at that particular point of time makes any substantial difference as far as
proceeding under Section 145 Cr.P.C. is concerned. As has been pointed out very clearly the court of
learned Magistrate while exercising its jurisdiction under Section 145 Cr.P.C. is concerned only
about the actual possession over the property on the date when the order under Section 145(1)
Cr.P.C was issued. The subsequent possession of any of the party by turn of events or otherwise may
not have any impact on the most important issue involved herein.
15. Precise query has been made before learned counsel for the petitioner that whether any
modification application has been preferred for seeking modification of the order dated 12.10.2023?
Or any challenge has been made to the order dated 12.10.2023? It is fairly submitted by learned
senior counsel appearing on behalf of petitioner that no modification application or any challenge to
the order date 12.10.2023 has been preferred at the behest of the petitioner, meaning thereby the
matter of possession has already been clarified and still holding the field which has been determined
by co-ordinate Bench of this Court while passing the order dated 12.10.2023 and as such this Court
is having no occasion available but to rely upon judgment dated 12.10.2023 passed by co-ordinate
Bench of this Court specifically for determining the issue of possession which was handed over by
the concerned police in favour of the petitioner during proceeding initiated under Section 145(1)
Cr.P.C and before that the possession was in favour of the respondent no. 2.
16. In view of the aforementioned facts and circumstances, present petition lacks merit and is
hereby dismissed.
