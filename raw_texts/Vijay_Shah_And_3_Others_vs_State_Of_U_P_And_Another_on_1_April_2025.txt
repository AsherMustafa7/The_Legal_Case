application, Sri S.K. Singh, learned AGA for the State.

he is not present. The receipt is taken on record.
3. Since the common question are involved in both the applications, thus, they are being taken
together and proceeded by a composite order.
4. The leading application had been preferred by father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law,
sister-in-law of daughter of opposite party no.2 Shakshi Sharma. In the said application the relief
sought for quashing the charge-sheet dated 07.02.2018 in Case Crime No. 729 of 2016, under

proceeded to pass the following order passed on 08.03.2019:
"Heard learned counsel for the applicants and learned Additional Government
Advocate for the State/opposite party no.1 and perused the record with the assistance
of leaned counsel for the parties.
This application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. has been filed by the applicants with a
prayer to quash the charge-sheet dated 07.02.2018 arising out of case crime no. 729
of 2016, under Sections 323, 506, 352, 498A IPC and 3/4 D.P. Act, Police Station
Ijjatnager, District - Bareilly.
It is submitted by the learned counsel for the applicants that this is a matrimonial
dispute. Applicants are willing to settle the matter through mediation, therefore, an
opportunity be granted to the parties concerned for reconciliation/settlement of their
disputes by way of mediation.
This Court owes a duty to the society to strain to utmost to repair the frayed relations
between the husband and wife, so that wounded situation may be healed into healthy
rapprochement. The matter in hand also appears to be one of those cases in which
reconciliation should be tried between the disputing parties.
The Apex Court in case of B.S. Joshi Vs. State of Haryana 2003 (4) SCC 675 has also
observed that courts to encourage settlement of marital disputes between the
contesting spouses, so that they do not lose their youthful years in chasing
interminable litigations.
In view of above, I agree with the submission advanced on behalf of the applicants
and feel that the interest of justice would be served, if such request of the applicants
is acceded to and the criminal proceedings and other litigations between the parties
concerned is brought to an end.
