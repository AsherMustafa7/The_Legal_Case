Sunil Kumar vs The State Of Bihar Through The Principal ... on 26 September, 2025
passed by learned Special Judge, Vigilance, Patna in Special Case No. 22 of Patna High Court CR.
WJC No.357 of 2022 dt.26-09-2025 2015 arising out of Vigilance P.S. Case No. 40 of 2015, whereby
and whereunder petition dated 09.04.2021 relating to supply/providing entire relied upon
documents under the mandate of Section 207 Cr.P.C. and read with 173(5) Cr.P.C. as well as Section
3(1)(a)/5(1) of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 has been dismissed. II. Issuance of an
appropriate writ, order or direction directing and commanding the respondents to supply/make
available all relied upon documents by prosecution.
III. Other relief or reliefs to which the petitioner is found entitled for."
2. Apparently, the petitioner has approached this Court for setting aside the order dated 23.02.2022
passed by learned Special Judge, Vigilance, Patna in Special Case No. 22 of 2015, arising out of
Vigilance P.S. Case No. 40 of 2015, whereby and whereunder the petition of the petitioner for
supplying him with papers relied on by the prosecution has been denied.
3. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that by the impugned order the fundamental right of
the petitioner to have access of the police paper/prosecution paper has been denied by the learned
trial court. Even the Criminal Court Rules Patna High Court CR. WJC No.357 of 2022
dt.26-09-2025 of the High Court of Judicature of Patna provides for supply of police papers to the
accused. Learned counsel further submits that Rule 50-A of the Criminal Court Rules of the High
Court of Judicature at Patna provides that every accused shall be supplied with the statements of
witness recorded under Sections 161 and 164 Cr.P.C. and a list of documents, materials objects and
exhibits seized during investigation and relied upon by the investigating officer in accordance with
Sections 207 and 208 Cr.P.C. The list of statements, documents, material objects and exhibits shall
specify statements, documents, material objects and exhibits that are not relied upon by the
investigating officer. Learned counsel further submits that the none of the materials exhibits and
FSL report have been furnished to the petitioner jeopardizing his defence. Thus, the petitioner has
lost his valuable right to defend himself. Learned counsel further submits that this Court has got
power of superintendence over the working of the subordinate courts under Article 227 of the
Constitution of India and the present petition has been filed under Article 226 and 227 of the
Constitution of India and hence, the same is maintainable.
4. Perused the records.
5. It is well settled law that against a judicial Patna High Court CR. WJC No.357 of 2022
dt.26-09-2025 order, no writ would lie under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Radhey Shyam and Another Vs. Chhabi Nath and Others in (2015) 5
SCC 423 has held in paragraphs 18 and 25 to 30 which read as under:-
"18. While the above judgments dealt with the question whether judicial order could
violate a fundamental right, it was clearly laid down that challenge to judicial orders
could lie by way of appeal or revision or under Article 227 and not by way of a writ
under Article 226 and 32.

25. It is true that this Court has laid down that technicalities associated with the
prerogative writs in England have no role to play under our constitutional scheme.
There is no parallel system of King's Court in India and of all other courts having
limited jurisdiction subject to supervision of King's Court. Courts are set up under the
Constitution or the laws. All courts in the jurisdiction of a High Court are subordinate
to it and subject to its control and supervision under Article 227. Writ jurisdiction is
constitutionally conferred on all High Courts. Broad principles of writ jurisdiction
followed in England are applicable to India and a writ of certiorari lies against
patently erroneous or without jurisdiction orders of Tribunals or authorities or courts
other than judicial courts. There are no precedents in India for High Courts to issue
writs to subordinate courts. Control of working of subordinate courts in dealing with
their judicial orders is exercised by way of appellate or revisional Patna High Court
CR. WJC No.357 of 2022 dt.26-09-2025 powers or power of superintendence under
Article
227. Orders of civil court stand on different footing from the orders of authorities or
Tribunals or courts other than judicial/civil courts. While appellate or revisional
jurisdiction is regulated by statutes, power of superintendence under Article 227 is
constitutional. The expression "inferior court" is not referable to judicial courts, as
rightly observed in the referring order in paras 26 and 27 quoted above.
26. The Bench in Surya Dev Rai also observed in para 25 of its judgment that
distinction between Articles 226 and 227stood almost obliterated. In para 24 of the
said judgment distinction in the two articles has been noted. In view thereof,
observation that scope of Article 226 and 227 was obliterated was not correct as
rightly observed by the referring Bench in Para 32 quoted above. We make it clear
that though despite the curtailment of revisional jurisdiction under Section 115 CPC
by Act 46 of 1999, jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 227 remains
unaffected, it has been wrongly assumed in certain quarters that the said jurisdiction
has been expanded. Scope of Article 227 has been explained in several decisions
including Waryam Singh and another vs. Amarnath and anotherst, Ouseph Mathai
vs. M. Abdul Khadir, Shalini Shyam Shetty vs. Rajendra Shankar Patil and Sameer
Suresh Gupta vs. Rahul Kumar Agarwal. In Shalini Shyam Shetty, this Court
observed :
"64. However, this Court unfortunately discerns that of late there is a growing trend
amongst Patna High Court CR. WJC No.357 of 2022 dt.26-09-2025 several High
Courts to entertain writ petition in cases of pure property disputes. Disputes relating
to partition suits, matters relating to execution of a decree, in cases of dispute
between landlord and tenant and also in a case of money decree and in various other
cases where disputed questions of property are involved, writ courts are entertaining
such disputes. In some cases the High Courts, in a routine manner, entertain
petitions under Article 227 over such disputes and such petitions are treated as writ
petitions.

65. We would like to make it clear that in view of the law referred to above in cases of
property rights and in disputes between private individuals writ court should not
interfere unless there is any infraction of statute or it can be shown that a private
individual is acting in collusion with a statutory authority.
66. We may also observe that in some High Courts there is a tendency of entertaining
petitions under Article 227 of the Constitution by terming them as writ petitions. This
is sought to be justified on an erroneous appreciation of the ratio in Surya Dev and in
view of the recent amendment to Section 115 of the Civil Procedure Code by the Civil
Procedure Code (Amendment) Act, 1999. It is urged that as a result of the
amendment, scope of Section 115 CPC has been curtailed. In our view, even if the
scope of Section 115 CPC is curtailed that has not resulted in expanding the High
Court's power of superintendence. It is too well known to be reiterated that in
exercising its jurisdiction, High Court must follow the regime of law.
67. As a result of frequent interference by the Patna High Court CR. WJC No.357 of
2022 dt.26-09-2025 Hon'ble High Court either under Article 226 or 227 of the
Constitution with pending civil and at times criminal cases, the disposal of cases by
the civil and criminal courts gets further impeded and thus causing serious problems
in the administration of justice. This Court hopes and trusts that in exercising its
power either under Article 226 or 227, the Hon'ble High Court will follow the time
honoured principles discussed above. Those principles have been formulated by this
Court for ends of justice and the High Courts as the highest courts of justice within
their jurisdiction will adhere to them strictly."
(emphasis added)
27. Thus, we are of the view that judicial orders of civil courts are not amenable to a writ of certiorari
under Article 226. We are also in agreement with the view of the referring Bench that a writ of
mandamus does not lie against a private person not discharging any public duty. Scope of Article
227 is different from Article 226.
28. We may also deal with the submission made on behalf of the respondent that the view in Surya
Dev Rai stands approved by larger Benches in Shail, Mahendra Saree Emporium and Salem
Advocate Bar Assn and on that ground correctness of the said view cannot be gone into by this
Bench. In Shail, though reference has been made to Surya Dev Rai, the same is only for the purpose
of scope of power under Article 227 as is clear from para 3 of the said judgment. There is no
discussion on the issue of maintainability of a petition under Article 226. In Mahendra Saree
Emporium, reference to Surya Dev Patna High Court CR. WJC No.357 of 2022 dt.26-09-2025 Rai is
made in para 9 of the judgment only for the proposition that no subordinate legislation can whittle
down the jurisdiction conferred by the Constitution. Similarly, in Salem Bar Assn. in para 40,
reference to Surya Dev Rai is for the same purpose. We are, thus, unable to accept the submission of
learned counsel for the respondent.

29. Accordingly, we answer the question referred as follows :
29.1. Judicial orders of civil court are not amenable to writ jurisdiction under Article
226 of the Constitution;
29.2. Jurisdiction under Article 227 is distinct from jurisdiction from jurisdiction
under Article 226. 29.3. Contrary view in Surya Dev Rai is overruled."
30. The matters may now be listed before the appropriate Bench for further orders."
The enunciation of law by the Hon'ble Supreme Court makes it clear that judicial orders of
subordinate court are not amenable to writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of
India.
6. So far as the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that this Court should interfere
with the impugned order in exercise of power under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, I am
afraid, the said contention is misconceived. Article 227 of the Constitution is not a substitute for
appellate or revisional jurisdiction. If a statutory remedy is Patna High Court CR. WJC No.357 of
2022 dt.26-09-2025 available against a judicial order, this Court could not entertain a petition
under Article 227 of the Constitution. Time and again it has been held that power under Article 227
of the Constitution should be exercised sparingly only to correct manifest miscarriage of justice or
the error that shocks the judicial conscience and should not be utilized to correct the mere mistakes
of fact or law in the orders of the subordinate courts. This Court could not allow Article 227 of the
Constitution to be used as a means to bypass specific statutory or procedural remedy. It goes
without saying that the power under Article 227 of the Constitution could be exercised in very
exceptional circumstances to prevent clear and gross miscarriage of justice or to interfere with a
finding so perverse that it necessitates interference. A mere wrong decision by a subordinate court,
however erroneous, would not be sufficient to invoke its extra- ordinary jurisdiction. Therefore, the
submission that the present petition could be entertained under Article 227 of the Constitution is
without any substance.
7. Having regard to the aforesaid discussion, I am of the considered opinion that the present petition
has been filed by the petitioner under a misconceived appreciation of law and against the impugned
order a petition under Article 226 Patna High Court CR. WJC No.357 of 2022 dt.26-09-2025 or 227
of the Constitution of India is not maintainable. Therefore, I am not inclined to entertain the present
petition and hence, the same is dismissed.
