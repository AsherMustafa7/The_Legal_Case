4. In a case titled, "Gian Singh Vs. State of Punjab and Another"
[2012 (10) SCC 303] while considering the aspect of whether the High Court has
power to quash the proceedings when some of the offences alleged to have been
committed are non-compoundable, the Apex Court has observed as follows:
"57. The position that emerges from the above discussion can be summarised thus:
the power of the High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint
in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to
a criminal court for compounding the offences under Section 320 of the Code.
Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be
exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;
(i) to secure the ends of justice or
(ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court.
In what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be exercised where
the offender and victim have settled their dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances of
each case and no category can be prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the High
Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of
mental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. cannot be fittingly quashed even though
the victim or victim(cid:128)s family and the offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are not private

in nature and have serious impact on society. Similarly, any compromise between the victim and
offender in relation to the offences under special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or the
offences committed by public servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any
basis for quashing criminal proceedings involving such offences. But the criminal cases having
overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the purposes of
quashing, particularly the offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership
or such like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc. or the
family disputes where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the parties have
resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings
if in its view, because of the compromise between the offender and victim, the possibility of
conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would put accused to great
oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the
criminal case despite full and complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words,
the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to
continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal proceeding would tantamount
to abuse of process of law despite settlement and compromise between the victim and wrongdoer
and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put to an end and if
the answer to the above question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its
jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding".
5. Ratio of the judgment of „Gian Singh(cid:128)s case (supra) makes the legal proposition abundantly clear,
that the High Court has inherent powers under Section 482 of Cr.P.C to quash the proceedings to
meet the ends of justice subject to the parameters that, if the parties have settled their disputes
amicably by a compromise, if the application/petition is made at an earliest stage even though
charge sheet has been filed but charges are yet to be framed and trial has not commenced and even
if the criminal trial is permitted to go ahead it will end in nothing else than an acquittal. Ratio of the
judgment (supra) squarely applies to the facts of the case in hand. Bare perusal of the statements of
petitioners and respondents 2 & 3 placed on record demonstrate that the parties have entered into a
compromise whereby they have settled their disputes/issues, so there would be no chance of
conviction of accused in near future in case trial is held and concluded.
6. In view of the above, this petition is allowed. Consequently, FIR No. 230/2021 dated 12.09.2021
for commission of offences punishable under Sections 341, 323, 147, 148, 382, 325, 201 IPC
registered against petitioners/accused with Police Station Akhnoor Jammu, alongwith challan/final
report bearing No. 104/2022 dated 07.07.2022 pending trial in the Court of learned Judicial
Magistrate 1st Class Akhnoor, in view of compromise arrived at between the parties, is, hereby
quashed.
7. Disposed of accordingly along with all connected CM(s).
8. Copy of this order be forthwith sent to the Court below/SHO concerned for information and
compliance.
