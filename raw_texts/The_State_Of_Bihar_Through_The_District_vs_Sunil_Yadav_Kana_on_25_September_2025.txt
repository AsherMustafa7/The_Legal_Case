CAV JUDGMENT
(Per: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE RAJEEV RANJAN PRASAD)
Date : 25-09-2025
Both the appeals have been preferred by the State and
the informant respectively for setting aside the judgment dated
14.05.2024
(hereinafter referred to as the 'impugned judgment') passed in Sessions Trial No. 246 of 2006
arising out of Danapur P.S. Case No. 200 of 2003 passed by the learned Additional Sessions
Judge-III-cum-Special Judge MP/MLA, Patna (hereinafter referred to as the 'learned trial court) by
which the learned trial court has been pleased to acquit the respondents in Govt. Appeal (DB) No. 6
of 2024 for the offences punishable under Sections 148, 307 and 302 of the Indian Penal Code (in
short 'IPC') and Section 27 of the Arms Act.
Prosecution Case
2. The prosecution story is based on the written application of Asha Devi, Wife of Satyanarayan
Sinha, Resident of Village- Sarari, PS- Shahpur, District- Patna in which she has stated that on
30.04.2003 in between 11.00-11.30 AM, she was going for her treatment along with Jivan Yadav,
Sanjay Kumar, Patna High Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025 Nageshwar Prasad,
Dheeraj Kumar, Arun Kumar to Khagaul by her vehicle bearing Registration No. BR1T-0222. As
soon as they reached near the house of Rambabu Pathik, a Maruti Van was standing in front of the
house of Rambabu Pathik, in such a way that their vehicle could not proceed further. The vehicle
was driven by informant's husband. He brought his head outside and asked for giving passage. It is
alleged that three persons came out of the vehicle and shouted "Satya Narayan Aa Gaya". They all
were armed with weapons. After hearing the hulla Rambabu, Rambabu Pathik, Ritlal Yadav, Sunil
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155634626/ 2
The State Of Bihar Through The District ... vs Sunil Yadav @ Kana on 25 September, 2025
Yadav @ Kana, Ranjan Kumar Benga and 8-10 others variously armed with weapon came from the
house of Rambabu Pathik. Rambabu Pathik while saying "Sala Barka Neta Banta Hai Jaan Se Maar
Do", pulled her husband outside and Ritlal Yadav, Sunil Yadav and Ranjan Kumar fired on her
husband due to which, he fell down. Thereafter, at the instance of Rambabu Pathik who said "Gari
Me Baithe Logon Ko Maar Do", all the 10-12 criminals started firing but they all were saved by
hiding themselves under the seat of the vehicle. Sanjay and Dheeraj were injured. There were dozen
of marks of bullet on the vehicle. The accused persons assuming them dead entered into house of
Rambabu Pathik. The informant identifies the other accused persons but does not remember the
names. It is the claim Patna High Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025 of the informant
that the accused persons namely Rambabu Pathik, Ritlal Yadav, Sunil Yadav @ Kana, Ranjan Yadav
@ Benga and other criminals had killed her husband Satya Narayan Sinha, due to enmity.
3. On the basis of the written report of the informant, Danapur P.S. Case No. 200 of 2003 dated
01.05.2003 was registered under Sections 147, 148, 149, 323, 307, 324 and 302 IPC and Section 27
of the Arms Act.
4. After investigation, police submitted charge-sheet bearing no. 102 of 2004 dated 26.10.2004
under Sections 147, 148, 149, 323, 324, 307 and 302 of the IPC and Section 27 of the Arms Act
against the accused persons. On submission of charge- sheet, cognizance was taken and record was
committed to the court of Sessions on 31.01.2006 where Sessions Trial No. 246 of 2006 was
registered on 27.02.2006. In Sessions Trial No. 246 of 2006 vide order dated 07.08.2007 case
record of Ritlal Yadav was separated and the trial proceeded against accused namely (i) Sharvan
Yadav, (ii) Sunil Kumar Rai and (iii) Benga Yadav to whom the learned trial court explained the
charges in Hindi, which they denied and claimed to be tried accordingly vide order dated
08.08.2007 charges were framed against them under Sections 148 and 307 IPC and Section 27 of
the Arms Act. Against Sunil Yadav Patna High Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025 and
Benga Yadav separate charge under Section 302 was also framed and against Sharvan Yadav, charge
under Section 302/149 was framed.

6. At this stage, it is worth mentioning that Sanjay Kumar (PW-5), Nageshwar Prasad (PW-6) and
Dheeraj Kumar (PW-7) were though examined by the I.O. and their statements were recorded in
paragraph '65', '93' and '98' of the case diary but they were not specifically made chargesheet
witnesses, though the I.O. stated in the chargesheet that other witnesses may be examined apart
from the chargesheet witnesses. Thus, the prosecution filed a petition in the trial court to allow the
Patna High Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025 examination of these witnesses which
was allowed vide order dated 11.02.2013.
7. One of the witnesses, Rintu Singh (PW-8) was allowed to be examined by the trial court vide order
dated 12.07.2013 after noting that PW-1, PW-2, PW-4 and PW-5 all had stated about the presence of
Rintu Singh at the time of occurrence. A criminal revision bearing number 606 of 2013 was
preferred by the accused-respondent no. 2 in the High Court which was rejected. Again, on the
request of the prosecution, the court allowed the prosecution petition calling for the injury reports of
Dheeraj (PW-7) and summons were issued to the treating doctor Dr. N. K. Singh (PW-9), Dr. H. K.
Jha (not appeared despite issuance of warrant) and Dr. R. N. Prasad (not appeared despite
summons and warrant).

8. One more fact which is important to take note is that the trial court was able to secure the
appearance Dr. Umesh Kumar in court after issuance of a non-bailable warrant only.
9. It appears on perusal of the trial court's records in this trial that the defence filed a petition
stating therein that on perusal of the case diary, it is apparent that on the same date and time of
occurrence of this case, a separate case was lodged by the same SHO, Danapur vide Danapur P.S.
Case No. 198 of 2003. The Patna High Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025 supervising
authority of both the cases i.e. DIG, Central Range, Bihar, Patna directed the I.O. of the case to pray
in the court concerned to amalgamate the cases. The I.O. of the case is also the I.O. in the said case.
A prayer was made on behalf of the accused that the case diary of Danapur P.S. Case No. 198 of
2003 be called for further cross-examination of the I.O. This plea of the accused was contested by
the Special Public Prosecutor for the State who argued that on perusal of the case records, it is
evident that the police is in collusion with the accused Ritlal Yadav and others and tried to spoil the
case of the informant and for which informant has also filed a protest petition at the conduct of the
police. It was submitted that Danapur P.S. Case No. 198 of 2003 was set up by the police to help the
accused and it has no concern at all with this case. After hearing the parties, the learned trial court,
vide its order dated 14.05.2015, held that at this stage of evidence of prosecution, the prosecution
has not relied upon the case diary of Danapur P.S. Case No. 198 of 2003 to prove its case, therefore,
at this stage, the said case diary which the prosecution has found not reliable cannot be called for.
Defence is free to call for the case diary in his defence evidence. We can also summon the I.O. to
confront to the case diary when his term of adducing evidence of Patna High Court G. APP. (DB)
No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025 defence witness comes. The petition filed by the defence to call for the
case diary of Danapur P.S. Case No. 198 of 2003 was rejected.
10. This Court has found from the ordersheets of the learned trial court that at one stage, one of the
accused, Sunil Rai filed a petition that Rabindra Kumar, DIG (Central Range), Patna be directed to
appear as a defence witness and he should be summoned for this purpose. In its order dated
08.03.2016, the learned trial court has taken note of it, however, after hearing learned counsel for
the parties, vide order dated 14.06.2016, the learned trial court rejected the said prayer. The court
held that on perusal of the case diary, it was found that DIG Central Range Rabindra Kumar had
conducted supervision of this case and his supervision report has been mentioned in paragraph '114'
of the case diary. The I.O. of this case has already been examined, therefore, the court can look into
the supervision report of DIG Central Range Rabindra Kumar. The defence counsel may also argue
on the report of DIG Central Range, Patna during argument. Considering these facts, the court held
that there was no need to call DIG Central Range, Patna as defence witness.
11. This Court finds from the order dated 28.06.2016, passed in this trial case, that on behalf of
accused Sunil Rai, a petition was filed praying for calling the case diary of Danapur Patna High
Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025 P.S. Case No. 198 of 2003 in his defence. The
learned trial court allowed the said application and Office was directed to call for case diary of
Danapur P.S. Case No. 198 of 2003, however, in the subsequent orders, which are available on the
record, this Court finds no mention of the fact as to whether the case diary of Danapur P.S. Case No.
198 of 2003 was received or not. On record, the said case diary is available.

The State Of Bihar Through The District ... vs Sunil Yadav @ Kana on 25 September, 2025
12. It appears from the order dated 10.01.2017 of the trial court that the prosecution evidence was
closed on 04.08.2015 and the statement of the accused under section 313 were recorded on
01.09.2015, whereafter the records were fixed for defence evidence. The court has recorded that the
case diary ordered by this court on 28.06.2016 had yet not been received, but there was a direction
of the High Court to expedite the disposal of the case. In such circumstance, the defence was not
granted further opportunity and the defence evidence was closed.
13. The case was fixed for arguments. The defence did not question the order dated 10.01.2017 and
agreed to start the argument. On 09.05.2017, the prosecution started its argument. The records
were kept for hearing of the Special Public Prosecutor and the informant's petition for adjournment
was rejected vide order dated 24.07.2017. The prosecution seems to have closed its Patna High
Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025 argument thereafter. Thereafter, the records were
fixed for hearing the learned counsel for the accused but for one reason or another, only formal
orders were passed on several dates and in this way, the record remained pending for several years.
This Court has also noticed that the records of this case have been transferred on several occasions
which seems to be unusual. The ordersheets of the trial court would show that at one stage, on
transfer of the records to the court of learned Special Judge MP/MLA, it was found vide order dated
30.09.2020 that the records were though received from the court of ADJ-XXI with TC, the LCR was
not attached with the record and the deposition of witness no. 7 was not on the record. The trial
court called for a report regarding the LCR and the case diary of this case and for this purpose a
letter was written to the Bench Clerk of the earlier court, however, the original case diary and the
LCR were not made available to the trial court. This situation continued for a long time. In its order
dated 19.04.2022, the trial court had recorded that the original case diary and the original LCR were
not received. It was reported by Rohit Kumar, the Clerk of the then Presiding Officer ADJ-XI that
the original LCR relating to this case was not available. This shows how the hearing of this case was
tried to be stalled. Ultimately, the informant had to approach this Court in Cr.WJC Patna High
Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025 No. 1124 of 2021. The High Court was informed
that the records are missing and it was being deliberately done to delay the disposal of the case. The
learned writ court vide its order dated 12.07.2022 issued directions which are being reproduced
hereunder for a ready reference:-
"Call for a report from the District Judge Incharge, Patna as to why the records of
Sessions Trial No. 246 and Sessions Trial No. 246A of 2006 arising out of Special
Case No. 122 of 2018 (Danapur P.S. Case No. 200/2003) have not been sent to the
Special Court of A.D.J.III-cum-M.P./M.L.A. Court. There are serious allegations that
the order of this Court passed as back as on 13.05.2016 in Cr. Misc. No. 18493 of
2016 and the order dated 17.01.2017 in Cr. Misc. No. 908 of 2017 have not been
complied with.
Mr. S.D.Sanjay, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner submits that in this case all
the prosecution witnesses have been examined and after 313 Cr.P.C. stage the defence
evidence was also closed and the case was fixed for hearing. At this stage, it appears
that efforts are being made for last several years by the interested persons to drag the
final hearing of the case and disposal of the matter.

The State Of Bihar Through The District ... vs Sunil Yadav @ Kana on 25 September, 2025
Let a comprehensive report be sent to this Court. The District Judge Incharge, Patna
shall while submitting the report will examine as to whether there is an attempt in
connivance with the staffs of the Civil Court to somehow withheld the records in
order to drag the matter and avoid the disposal of the case."
Patna High Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025
14. This Court has recorded the entire facts showing how the records of this case were kept pending
and also transferred from one court to another. The trial court could finally deliver its judgment only
after the records were found pursuant to the order of this Court.
15. On perusal of the records of Sessions Trial No. 246 of 2006, it would appear that while the
hearing of the case was going on, the defence was referring to the evidences adduced in Sessions
Trial No. 246A of 2006. This was opposed by the prosecution by filing a petition dated 03.04.2024.
The stand of the prosecution was that evidence of one session case cannot be referred in another
session case even though the occurrence is the same. The prosecution relied upon the judgment of
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of A.T. Mydeen and Another vs. Assistant Commissioner,
Customs Department reported in (2022) 14 SCC 392. The petition was opposed by the defence by
filing a rejoinder wherein it is stated that after commitment, one of the co-accused namely Ritlal
Yadav absconded as such his trial was separated and charges were framed against three remaining
accused persons who are facing Sessions Trial No. 246 of 2006. After examination of three witnesses
in this trial, the co-accused Ritlal yadav appeared and charges were framed against him and trial
commenced as Sessions Trial No. 246(A) of 2006. In the present trial, altogether twelve witnesses
were examined Patna High Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025 whereas in Sessions
Trial No. 246A/2006, ten witnesses have been examined. All the witnesses examined in both the
cases are common except PW-2 and PW-3 of Sessions Trial No. 246/2006. The contention was that
since both the cases arise out of the same case and the witnesses are same so it cannot be said that
proceeding in both the cases are different and the defence cannot refer the evidence of the witnesses
recorded in Sessions Trial No.246A/2006. The learned trial court considered the rival submissions
and vide order dated 16.04.2024 allowed the petition of the prosecution. Thus, the learned trial
court agreed with the stand of the prosecution that the evidence of Sessions Trial No. 246A/2006
could not be referred by the defence in Sessions Trial No. 246/2006.
Judgment in the present trial is copy and paste of the judgment in Trial No. 246A of 2006.
16. At the outset, we have noticed that the judgment of the learned trial court, the reasoning and
rationale provided therein in Sessions Trial No. 246 of 2006 is in the same words as that of the
judgment in Sessions Trial No. 246A of 2006. It seems that in paragraph '22' of the impugned
judgment, the learned trial court has not even taken care to apply its judicious mind that this was
going to be judgment in Sessions Trial No. 246 of 2006. The trial court has recorded in the very first
line of paragraph '22' as under:-
Patna High Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025 "22. First point which is
important for the consideration that the trial of case no 246/2006 and this trial
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155634626/ 7
The State Of Bihar Through The District ... vs Sunil Yadav @ Kana on 25 September, 2025
246a/2006 have been originated from the same P.S. Case no. i.e. Danapur P.S. Case
No. 200/2003....".
The words "this trial 246A of 2006" clearly show that the trial court is taking this case as if it is Trial
No. 246A of 2006.
Findings of the learned Trial Court
17. As recorded hereinabove, since the trial court has recorded the findings in the present case in
identical terms with that of Trial number No. 246a of 2006, we record the findings of the trial court
which we have noticed while dealing with the impugned judgment in Govt. Appeal (DB) No.7 of
2024 and Criminal Appeal (DB) No. 952 of 2024 (arising out of Sessions Trial No. 246a of 2006).
18. The learned trial court having analysed the evidences adduced on behalf of the prosecution and
the defence recorded in paragraph '22' of its judgment that the trial of Trial No. 246 of 2006 and
246a of 2006 have originated from the same P.S. case i.e. Danapur P.S. Case No. 200 of 2003, so
both the records will be perused for the ends of justice as well as for the better appreciation of the
evidences. The trial court noted that the prosecution witnesses and the informant have stated that
the occurrence took place near the house of Ram Babu Pathik, he had also been made Patna High
Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025 an accused in this case by the informant but after
investigation, the police did not find his role in the alleged occurrence, therefore submitted a closure
report against him which has been accepted by learned ACJM, Danapur. The prosecution never
challenged that order, therefore, it will be deemed to have been accepted by the prosecution. The
trial court further noted that the prosecution did not draw the attention of the trial court towards
Section 319 CrPC. The trial court observed that Ram Babu Pathik was said to be an order giver and it
is stated that all the accused persons came from his house, this becomes more relevant when there is
another case for the occurrence on the same day for which Danapur P.S. Case No. 198 of 2003 had
been lodged (Exhibit 'B').
19. As regards the place of occurrence, the trial court noted that the I.O. has stated a different place
of occurrence from that of the informant and other prosecution witnesses, therefore, the testimony
of the prosecution witnesses is required to be perused carefully. After saying so, the trial court
proceeded to consider the evidence of PW-1. It is noted by way of observation that PW-1 had never
stated in her written information about Rintu Singh. Rintu Singh has been examined as PW-8 but
he was not mentioned in the witness column of the chargesheet. Patna High Court G. APP. (DB)
No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025 Further, the trial court has noted that the name of Arun Kumar is not
stated in the evidence of PW-1, therefore, there is some hide and seek by the informant. The trial
court has considered the evidence of PW-1 adduced in Trial No. 246 of 2006 in which in paragraph
'20' she had stated that Arun Kumar was injured in Danapur P.S. Case No. 198 of 2003 and other
witnesses have stated that he had died. Taking note of this evidence of PW-1 in Trial No. 246 of
2006, the learned trial court raised a question that how it was probable that a man injured and died
in another case was sitting along with the deceased husband of the informant. The prosecution has
failed to explain this aspect, said the learned trial court.

20. As regards the evidence of the injured witnesses, the trial court noted that the informant has laid
stress on their evidence but thereafter the court proceeded to consider the evidence of PW- 5 and
PW-7. It has been observed that PW-5 has nowhere stated in his examination-in-chief regarding the
injuries sustained in the occurrence. Likewise Dheeraj Kumar (PW-7) has stated in his evidence that
he and Sunil ji were injured but he has stated a different story as stated by the informant. The trial
court took a view that PW-5 has stated that bullet crossed his hand but in paragraph '7' of his cross
examination, he had stated that it is not Patna High Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025
true that there is no mark of firearm injuries on his hand but he had not shown any mark of injuries
to the court during the evidence. Thus, the trial court took a view that his statement does not find
any objective corroboration from the evidence of Dr. Umesh Kumar (CW-1) who brought the alleged
injury report of Dheeraj Kumar (Exhibit '4'). The injury report did not show any firearm injury on
his hand. The trial court, therefore, held that these are the material contradictions in the statement
of this witness and the I.O.
21. The trial court has further taken a view that the evidence of the informant and the evidence of
the I.O. Arshad Jama have material contradictions. As per the informant, the place of occurrence of
the case is near the house of Ram Babu Pathik situated in Jamaluddin Chak but the I.O. has
mentioned the place of occurrence on the Khagaul-Neora Main Road. The I.O. was not given
suggestion by the prosecution on the point of place of occurrence so the prosecution failed to
establish the exact place of occurrence of this case.
The trial court has further held that the I.O. has stated in his evidence in paragraph '9' of his
cross-examination that after the occurrence when he tried to take the statement of the informant,
she did not give the same. He again tried to take the statement of the informant and the other
witnesses, they do not turn up before Patna High Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025
him. He became known to the fact that witness Arun Kumar had died in Danapur P.S. Case No. 198
of 2003. The trial court has relied upon the evidence of the I.O. Arshad Jama and recorded that he
had taken statement of the informant on 14.06.2003, on that day he had taken the statement of
Munna Kumar and after that he recorded the statement of other witnesses like Nageshwar Prasad
and Sanjay Kumar. These witnesses had given their statement before police after fifteen days of the
occurrence. Prior to recording of their statement, the I.O. had taken the statement of several other
witnesses. According to the trial court, the prosecution had not examined them rather seventeen
witnesses have been given up for their examination by the prosecution and the same was allowed
vide order dated 11.02.2013 by the predecessor court.
22. The learned trial court has dealt with another aspect saying that the witnesses who have been
examined for the prosecution are mostly out of other village than the place of occurrence. The
informant had gone to her house by taking the dead body of her husband. It is stated by her that
approximately forty people used to reside in the houses having same courtyard but none of them
have been examined by her. She has also not Patna High Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024
dt.25.09-2025 examined her own grown up children. For all these reasons, the trial court doubted
the occurrence.

The State Of Bihar Through The District ... vs Sunil Yadav @ Kana on 25 September, 2025
It is further held by the learned trial court that there are statement of the witnesses that the accused
persons had fired from the front side of the vehicle and some marks of bullet occurred on the vehicle
also. The vehicle was produced by the informant herself to the I.O. and thereafter
production-cum-seizure list was prepared (Exhibit '1/5' and '1/6'), the seizure lists do not show any
mark of bullet on the seized vehicle. There was no FSL report of the material articles which were
recovered from the vehicle as per the seizure list. The bullet was removed from the body of the
deceased and was handed over to the Constable but there is no Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL)
report regarding this. As per seizure list there was no mark of bullet on the vehicle contrary to the
statement of the prosecution witnesses who have stated that the accused have fired on the vehicle
from the front side and several marks had occurred on the vehicle. The trial court disbelieved the
manner of occurrence saying that while informant has stated that the accused fired on her husband
when he was in the vehicle, the other witnesses have stated that her husband was dragged from the
vehicle and was murdered by the accused persons on being shot to him.
Patna High Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025 The learned trial court has also taken
into consideration the statements of the informant with regard to the post occurrence facts. The trial
court held that there were material contradictions in the evidence of the informant (PW-1) and that
of the other witnesses. The trial court has found that the evidence of the prosecution witnesses are
not getting corroborated by the evidence of the I.O. Some of the witnesses are having criminal
antecedents and they are also residents of different village, therefore, their testimonies would not be
convincing to the court and that would cast shadow on the entire prosecution case. The I.O. has not
been declared hostile by the prosecution. He was Dy.S.P. at the time of investigation and the
statement of the informant and other prosecution witnesses were recorded by him in presence of the
D.I.G. Central Range, Patna. In such situation, according to the learned trial court, it cannot be said
that the I.O. was in collusion with the accused.
In ultimate analysis, the learned trial court held that the prosecution has only proved the death of
Satyanarayan Sinha by adducing the evidence of Dr. Narendra Kumar Singh (PW-9) but failed to
prove the fact as to who murdered the deceased. In such circumstance, the benefit of doubt will go in
favour of the accused Patna High Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025 persons. The trial
court, therefore, acquitted the accused- respondent no. 2 of all the charges giving him benefit of
doubt.
Submissions on behalf of the State
23. Mr. Ajay Kumar Mishra, learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the State, submits that in this
case, PW-1, PW-6, PW-7 and PW-8 are the eyewitnesses of the occurrence. PW-8 is also an injured
witness. They have given ocular evidence. PW-1 is the star witness of this case. The doctor (PW-9)
has proved the postmortem report of the deceased, which corroborates the ocular evidence. The
deceased was killed by firing and he had sustained several firearm injuries from a close range. Thus,
the manner of occurrence has been fully corroborated from the postmortem report. It is submitted
that the learned trial court has not appreciated the evidence of the eyewitnesses and without giving
any positive findings on the point of manner and cause of occurrence, acquitted the accused
persons. In his submissions, the trial court has passed the judgment of acquittal in a mechanical
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155634626/ 10
The State Of Bihar Through The District ... vs Sunil Yadav @ Kana on 25 September, 2025
manner. It is pointed out that from a reading of the concluding part of the judgment of the learned
trial court in Sessions Trial No. 246 of 2006 and Sessions Trial No. 246A of 2006 it would appear
that the learned trial court has recorded verbatimly same and one thing Patna High Court G. APP.
(DB) No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025 and acquitted the accused. There is no separate consideration and
appreciation of the evidences of the two different trials.
24. Learned Additional Public Prosecutor further submits that Danapur P.S. Case No. 198 of 2003
and Danapur P.S. Case No. 199 of 2003 were registered only to help the defence/accused because
they were very close to the power of the State at the relevant time. One of the accused, Rambabu
Pathik, happened to be the samdhi of the then Chief Minister of the State of Bihar, therefore, police
was acting indifferently and not only the FIR in this case was lodged on the next day of the
occurrence but even on all other aspects of the investigation, the first I.O. of the case and then the
second I.O. (PW-10) ensured that the materials which are required to be collected immediately be
allowed to vanish. It is submitted that the learned trial court has given much emphasis on the
evidence of the I.O. (PW-10) without realising that indifferent attitude of the I.O. would not
discredit the other prosecution witnesses and it would not enure benefit to the accused.
25. Learned Additional Public Prosecutor has relied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of Ganesha vs. Sharanappa and Another reported in (2014) 1 SCC 87 to submit that
the Hon'ble Supreme Court has taken a view that Patna High Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024
dt.25.09-2025 in a case where the finding of acquittal is recorded on account of misreading of
evidence or non-consideration of evidence or perverse appreciation of evidence, nothing prevents
the High Court from setting aside the order of acquittal at the instance of the informant in revision
and directing fresh disposal on merit by the trial court. In the event of such direction, the trial court
shall be obliged to reappraise the evidence in light of the observation of the Revisional Court and
take an independent view uninfluenced by any of the observations of the Revisional Court on the
merit of the case. By way of abundant caution, it has also been observed that interference with the
order of acquittal in revision is called for only in cases where there is manifest error of law or
procedure and in those exceptional cases in which it is found that the order of acquittal suffers from
glaring illegality, resulting into miscarriage of justice.
26. Learned Additional Public Prosecutor has submitted that the judgment of the learned trial court
is only a cut and paste judgment in both the trials and the evidence adduced in one trial has been
used in deciding the another trial. The entire judgment suffers from perversity, hence it is liable to
be set aside and the accused-respondents are liable to be convicted and sentenced accordingly.
Patna High Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025 Submissions on behalf of the informant
27. Mr. Apurv Harsh, learned counsel for the informant has endorsed the submissions of learned
Additional Public Prosecutor for the State.
28. Learned counsel submits that the learned trial court has completely erred in appreciation of the
ocular and the documentary evidences available on the record. It is submitted that the learned trial
court has failed to appreciate that in this case the date, time and place of occurrence are fully
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155634626/ 11
The State Of Bihar Through The District ... vs Sunil Yadav @ Kana on 25 September, 2025
established by the prosecution. The Police Inspector of Danapur Police Station registered Danapur
P.S. Case No. 198 of 2003 on his own statement. It is submitted that the FIR of Danapur P.S. Case
No. 198 of 2003 was seen by learned A.C.J.M. only on 02.05.2003, even though it is shown to have
been registered on 30.04.2003 at 4:00 PM. This would strengthen the case of the informant that the
police did not record the statement of the informant (PW-1) on the date of occurrence at the place of
occurrence and delayed the lodging of the FIR of the informant (PW-1) only in order to help the
accused persons. The informant, Pramod Kumar Inspector of Police, Danapur and the first I.O. of
Danapur P.S. Case No. 198 of 2003 were not examined by the I.O. (PW-10) who subsequently took
charge of the investigation and thereby the case of the Patna High Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024
dt.25.09-2025 informant that the police were in collusion with the accused gets established.
29. Learned counsel submits that the written information and FIR of Danapur P.S. Case No. 198 of
2003 have been marked Exhibit 'B' on behalf of the defence but in fact the written information of
this case has not been placed with the formal FIR. It would appear from the self-written statement
of Pramod Kumar, Police Inspector of Danapur Police Station that he claims to have received
information with regard to the occurrence which took place at about 11:35AM from an unknown
person who informed him that gang of criminals are engaged in firing in village Jamaluddin Chak.
He reached there and got additional forces. He has written about the immediate circumstance which
he found there. In his self-statement, he has recorded that when he reached village Jamaluddin
Chak, then he found that on Khagaul-Neora road from the house of Rajendra Rai towards the Sarari
Gumti (railway crossing), in between 200-250 yards, about 1000-1500 persons were in running
condition (bhagdar) and some of the vehicles were burning. He had found that from the crowd and
from the roof of the houses, stones were being thrown and firing were being made. The main target
of stone-throwing was the house of Shri Rambabu Pathik. Near the house of Shri Pathik, from the
roof Patna High Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025 of the house of Mahendra Rai also,
stones were being thrown and firing were taking place. To understand this situation, when he came
near the police force posted at the house of Shri Pathik, the in-charge Havaldar Sheikh Sattar told
him that the criminals had attacked the house of Shri Pathik and the armed forces who were with
him had made firing in the air in self-defence from SLR. He has recorded that Havaldar Sheikh Md.
Sattar had given him written information in this regard which he claimed that he was enclosing with
his statement. Learned counsel submits that the written information given by Havaldar Sheikh
Sattar is dated 01.05.2003, therefore, it is evident that the self-statement of Pramod Kumar, Police
Inspector, shown to have been recorded on 30.04.2003 at 15:00 Hrs. is ante-dated and in fact it has
been recorded only on 01.05.2003. On 30.04.2003, no self-statement of Police Inspector was
recorded.
30. Learned counsel further submits that in his self- statement, the Police Inspector Pramod Kumar
has further recorded that he came to know that supporters of RJD were being taken in the rally
called by RJD in Gandhi Maidan, Patna, they were being taken to Gandhi Maidan by their leaders in
several vehicles. In the meantime, due to political rivalry and to show supremacy, an attack was
made on the rally supporters whereafter Patna High Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024
dt.25.09-2025 they came down from the vehicle and started running away. Amongst the criminals
one person died there, whose name is Satyanarayan Sinha of village Sarari, the people told him that
he was an active criminal of the area and he was charged for various offences. He has further stated
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155634626/ 12
The State Of Bihar Through The District ... vs Sunil Yadav @ Kana on 25 September, 2025
to have come to know that the other side was being led by Mukhiya Ritlal Yadav, who had also got
injured in the occurrence. Thereafter, he has stated about the subsequent actions which were taken
by him to control the crowd and in the process, ashru gas team was called and the crowd continued
to throw bricks and stones and were firing from gun, rifle and countrymade pistols, in which he has
named six police personnel who got injured. According to him, seven persons were identified by him
and the police force, which included Chunnu Rai and Rintu. He has also mentioned in his
self-statement that at the place of occurrence, two persons had fallen down after getting injured
from the firearm, they disclosed their name as (i) Arun Kumar, son of Sher Bahadur Rai (ii) Santosh
Kumar, son of Ram Bahadur Rai. They were not in a position to make their statements, hence, in
order to save their life, they were sent to PMCH and arrested Rajendra Prasad Ram and Ram Bali
Rai on chase. They disclosed that earlier Satyanarayan Sinha of village Sarari, P.S. Patna High Court
G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025 Sahapur was killed and his dead body has been taken
away by his supporters and the same has been concealed.
31. Learned counsel for the informant (PW-1) submits that the manner of occurrence as suggested
by the Police Inspector Pramod Kumar in his self-statement giving rise to Danapur P.S. Case No.
198 of 2003 is result of only an afterthought to weaken the case of the informant. This
self-statement was recorded only after he had come to know the case of the informant (PW-1) as
disclosed to the Police Inspector and in her written statement.
32. Learned counsel further submits that in his own self- statement Pramod Kumar, Inspector has
recorded that stones were being thrown and that firings were being done from the roof of the house
of Mahendra Rai near the house of Shri Pathik. It would be evident from a bare reading of the
self-statement of Pramod Kumar that he had received information about firing being exchanged by
two groups of criminals in village Jamaluddin Chak and he had also come to know that while
Satyanarayan Sinha had been killed there itself, the other side was being led by Mukhiya Ritlal
Yadav and he was also injured in the said occurrence of firing. It is submitted that Mukhiya Ritlal
Yadav remained absconding in this case for several months and in course of investigation, during
raid in the house of Ritlal Yadav, several Patna High Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024
dt.25.09-2025 firearms and ammunition were recovered which has been recorded by the I.O.
(PW-10) in the case diary.
33. Learned counsel submits that the indifferent attitude of the senior police officers and the
previous I.O. as well as the second I.O. (PW-10) in not only registering the case of the informant but
even subsequently in course of investigation would not discredit the prosecution witnesses and their
evidences are required to be examined independently but the learned trial court has not done so.
Learned counsel has relied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
Edakkandi Dineshan and Others vs. State of Kerala reported in (2025) 3 SCC 273 to submit that the
principle of "falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus" is not the rule applied by the courts in India. It is
submitted that even a part statement of a witness can be believed even though some part of the
statement may not be relied upon by the court but in this case the learned trial court has picked up
some minor inconsistencies in the statement of the witnesses from here and there in a scattered
manner and by relying upon the same, the trial court discredited the prosecution witnesses. This is
not the correct approach to appreciate the ocular evidences.

The State Of Bihar Through The District ... vs Sunil Yadav @ Kana on 25 September, 2025
34. Learned counsel further submits that in the case of Shahaja @ Shahajan Ismail Mohd. Shaikh vs.
State of Patna High Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025 Maharashtra reported in
(2023) 12 SCC 558, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has taken a view that the appreciation of ocular
evidence is a hard task and there cannot be any fixed or straitjacket formula for appreciation of the
ocular evidence. Learned counsel has relied upon paragraphs '29' and '30' of the judgment.
35. It is further submitted that in the case of Harendra Rai vs. State of Bihar and Others reported in
(2023) 13 SCC 563, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed inter alia that failure of the State
machinery and failure of the trial court to ensure a fair trial from the perspective of the victim side
and the aspect of non-marking of the FIR and bayan tahriri as an exhibit, non-production of the
formal witnesses in the trial would not vitiate the genuineness of the FIR. The Hon'ble Supreme
Court refused to give any discount to the accused persons for non- exhibition of those documents. It
is thus submitted that the judgment of the learned trial court is liable to be set aside and an
appropriate order be passed by this Court as an appellate court.
Submissions on behalf of the private respondents.
36. Mr. Rajendra Narayan, learned Senior Counsel has opposed the appeals. Defending the
impugned judgment of the learned trial court, learned Senior Counsel has submitted that no
illegality, much less any perversity, may be found in the judgment Patna High Court G. APP. (DB)
No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025 of the learned trial court. He has relied upon the judgment of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Muralidhar @ Gidda and Another vs. State of Karnataka
reported in (2014) 5 SCC 730 (paragraph 10 to 13 and 19) and the case of Ghurey Lal vs. State of
U.P. reported in (2008) 10 SCC 450 (paragraph 36, 69-76).
37. Learned Senior Counsel for the respondents has submitted that in the case of Surajpal Singh and
Others v. The State reported in AIR 1952 SC 52, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has, while dealing with
the powers of the High Court in an appeal against acquittal observed that the High Court has full
power to review the evidence upon which the order of acquittal was founded, but it is equally well
settled that the presumption of innocence of the accused is further reinforced by his acquittal by the
trial court and the findings of the trial court which had the advantage of seeing the witnesses and
hearing their evidence can be reversed only for very substantial and compelling reasons. Learned
Senior Counsel submits that in catena of judgments, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has reiterated the
principles relating to appeals from a judgment of acquittal which are in line with the judgment in
case of Surajpal Singh (supra).
38. Learned Senior Counsel has further submitted that in the case of Ghurey Lal (supra), the
Hon'ble Supreme Court has Patna High Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025 taken note
of the main reasons for acquittal by the trial court and the main reasons for reversal of the acquittal
order whereafter the Hon'ble Supreme Court disagreed with the High Court. While disagreeing with
the opinion of the High Court, the Hon'ble Supreme Court relied upon the judgment in case of Sheo
Swarup vs. King-Emperor reported in AIR 1934 PC 227 (2) in which the scope and ambit of the
powers of the appellate court in dealing with an appeal against acquittal has been elucidated by the
Privy Council. It has been held that the appellate court is undoubtedly having wide powers of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155634626/ 14
The State Of Bihar Through The District ... vs Sunil Yadav @ Kana on 25 September, 2025
reappreciating and re-evaluating the entire evidence but it would be justified in interfering with the
judgment of acquittal only when the judgment of the trial court is palpably wrong, totally ill-founded
or wholly misconceived, based on erroneous analysis of evidence and non-existent material,
demonstrably unsustainable or perverse [paragraph '43' of the judgment of Ghurey Lal (Supra)].
39. In sum and substance, learned Senior Counsel for the respondents has submitted that in this
case, the learned trial court has properly appreciated the entire evidences available on the record,
hence no interference is called for.
Patna High Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025 Analysis of the evidences
40. Asha Devi, who is the informant of this case, has deposed as PW-1. In her examination-in-chief,
PW-1 has stated that deceased was her husband. On the date of occurrence i.e. on 30.04.2003 in
between 11-11.30 AM, she was going for her treatment to a doctor by her vehicle BR1T-0222. Her
husband was driving the vehicle. Rintu Singh was sitting on the front side, in the middle she, Sanjay
and Jeevan were sitting. On the backseat, Nageshwar and Dheeraj were there. When her vehicle
reached near the house of Rambabu Pathik in Jamaluddin Chak then there was a Maruti vehicle
standing on the road in such a way that her vehicle could not have moved ahead. On this, her
husband took out his head outside the vehicle and asked for keeping aside the Maruti. In the
meantime, three persons came out of the said Maruti van and shouted "Satya Narayan Aa Gaya".
They were armed with weapon. This witness has further stated that Rambabu Pathik, Ritlal Yadav,
Sunil @ Kana, Ranjan @ Benga and 8/10 persons came out from the house of Rambabu Pathik, all
were armed with weapons. This witness has stated in paragraph '5' of her deposition that Rambabu
Pathik told "Sala Barka Neta Banta Hai", in the meantime Ritlal Yadav, Sunil Yadav and Ranjan
fired on her husband whereafter her husband fell down and he died. She has Patna High Court G.
APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025 stated that Rambabu told to kill all the persons who were in
the vehicle on which all the persons started firing, during this the informant and others who were in
the vehicle concealed themselves under the seat. Sanjay and Dheeraj had suffered firearm injury and
there were several marks of bullet on the vehicle. PW-1 has stated that all the accused persons went
inside the house of Rambabu Pathik. Thereafter she had gone to her village Sarari where police
came.
In her cross-examination in paragraph '17' she has stated that police had come at the place of
occurrence at 11:45 AM, there were several police officers with Darogaji, she had lodged a case at the
place of occurrence but her statement was not recorded by Darogaji. She had got prepared a written
information by Rajnish Kumar and had put her signature thereon. She had shown the place of
occurrence to police and had also shown the dead body of her husband.
This witness has also stated in her deposition that police was not properly conducting investigation
of the case because Rambabu Pathik happened to be the samdhi of the then Chief Minister of the
State of Bihar. She had filed a protest petition in Danapur court. This witness has identified her
signature on the protest petition as Exhibit '1/1' and has also identified the Patna High Court G.
APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025 signature of Anil Kumar Singh as Exhibit '1/2'. She has also
identified the signatures on the production-cum-seizure list as Exhibit '1/5' and Exhibit '1/6'
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155634626/ 15
The State Of Bihar Through The District ... vs Sunil Yadav @ Kana on 25 September, 2025
respectively. She has stated in paragraph '15' of her deposition that her statement was also taken in
front of DIG Sahab. She has stated in paragraph '19' of her deposition that the dead body of her
husband was not sent for postmortem on 30.04.2003. On 30.04.2003, police had lodged Danapur
P.S. Case No.198 of 2003 in which twelve persons were named and 1000-1500 unknown persons
were made accused. In this Arun Kumar, who was an injured, was also an accused. She has stated in
paragraph '20' that in the firing done by the police and accused persons Arun Kumar had got
injured.
PW-1 has further stated that police was there because of the rally. She had sent her written
application to the police station on 01.05.2003 but cannot say the name of the person through
whom the application was sent. She denied the suggestion of the defence that police had seen the
dead body of her husband on 01.05.2003 at 11:00 AM. She has stated that police had taken away the
dead body of her husband from the gausala in the Sarari village. The said gausala is at a distance of
one kilometer from the place of occurrence. She has also stated in paragraph '26' of her deposition
that police had seen the vehicle and the dead body was taken on Patna High Court G. APP. (DB)
No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025 the same vehicle to village Sarari. Police had seen the vehicle from the
date of occurrence and police used to come and go from the date of occurrence. Police seized the
vehicle on 3rd, no seizure was made at the door of the informant and police had taken away the
vehicle for examination. PW-1 denied the suggestion of the defence that for the first time the vehicle
was produced before police on 10.05.2003. She has stated that police had left the vehicle on her
jimmenama.
In her further cross-examination, PW-1 has stated that after 10-15 minutes of the occurrence, she
had met the Inspector of Police, Danapur. He had not informed her about the lodgment of the case.
She denied the suggestion of the defence that Sunil Kumar had informed her about the lodgment of
the case. She denied any information that three cases were lodged with respect to the occurrence.
She denied the defence suggestion that she had lodged a fabricated case.
41. On the point of criminal antecedent of her husband, this witness was cross-examined by defence.
She has stated that her husband had once gone behind the bars on the allegation of murder, there
were 4-5 cases against him. She denied the suggestion of the defence that her husband had gone to
jail for 4-5 times. She also denied the suggestion of the defence that no such Patna High Court G.
APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025 occurrence had taken place. She also denied the suggestion
of the defence that she was not present at the place of occurrence at the time of occurrence.
42. From the deposition of PW-1, it is evident that she has deposed as an eyewitness of the
occurrence. She has stated about the place of occurrence, the date of occurrence and the time of
occurrence. She has also stated that police had arrived within 10-15 minutes of the occurrence and
she had made statement before Darogaji at 11:45 AM at the place of occurrence but it was not
recorded. This witness has also stated that because of the rally police was already there. The defence
has not suggested otherwise. It is also evident that PW-1 has stated that the dead body of her
husband was not sent for postmortem on 30.04.2003 and she was not informed that police had
lodged any case on that day. To this Court, it appears that the statement of PW-1 that at the place of
occurrence police had seen the vehicles that police kept on coming and going and were seeing the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155634626/ 16
The State Of Bihar Through The District ... vs Sunil Yadav @ Kana on 25 September, 2025
vehicle are required to be appreciated keeping in mind that in the kind of occurrence which had
taken place, it cannot be believed that the vehicle may be kept concealed that too when police had
already arrived within 10-15 minutes and that was a day when the ruling party in the State had
called for a rally and police were already there. Although the Patna High Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of
2024 dt.25.09-2025 defence has suggested that PW-1 was not present at the time of occurrence but
in the evidence of PW-1, we do not find any contradiction taken with regard to her presence at the
place of occurrence.
43. Baleshwar Rai (PW-2) has deposed as a hearsay witness. He has stated that the wife of the
deceased had told him about the occurrence. At that time he was in his house and he had not seen
who had murdered Satyanarayan Sinha.

recorded in DIG Office. Patna High Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025 It is important
to note that PW-10 has stated that in course of investigation, witness Arun Kumar was
murdered/killed in police firing. PW-10 denied the defence suggestion that to disturb the rally,
deceased Satyanarayan had assembled nearby house of Rambabu Pathik, with his 1500-2000
supporters and they had started firing on the vehicles going to the rally, on seeing this, the police
personnel present at the house of Pathik Ji and the then Officer Incharge reached there with force
then the people started throwing stones and firing and they started burning the vehicles whereafter
in self-defence, police fired in which Arun Kumar and Satyanarayan Sinha suffered bullet. This
witness denied the suggestion of the defence. He also denied the suggestion that the wife of
Satyanarayan Sinha is in politics and under her order, the accused persons have been falsely
implicated in this case. This witness has further stated in paragraph '21' that this case was registered
after 24 hours of the occurrence. He had tried to record the statement of the informant on
03.05.2003, 05.05.2003, 09.05.2003, 15.05.2003, 24.05.2003, 05.06.2003 and 10.05.2003. He
found one towel which was not claimed by anyone. He was the Investigating Officer of Danapur P.S.
Case No. 198 of 2003, in the said FIR, it is mentioned that Satyanarayan Sinha was an active
criminal.
Patna High Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025
58. On analysis of the evidence of PW-10, it is found that he had taken over the investigation of the
case after three days of the occurrence but on the date of taking over the investigation, he had not
perused anything with regard to the investigation done by the earlier I.O. The earlier I.O. was not
examined but the earlier I.O. had not recorded about seizure of blood or empty cartridge shell from
the place of occurrence. The informant (PW-1) has stated in her deposition that after 10-15 minutes
of the occurrence, she had a meeting with the Police Inspector, Danapur. She has stated that on
30.04.2003 itself she had given information to the police station but in the police station, her
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155634626/ 25
The State Of Bihar Through The District ... vs Sunil Yadav @ Kana on 25 September, 2025
statement was not recorded. At the place of occurrence, at about 11:45 AM, Darogaji had come with
a large number of police officers, she had lodged the case at the place of occurrence but her
statement was not recorded by Daroga. This Court finds that there is no explanation in the evidence
of the I.O. (PW-10) as to why the earlier I.O. was not examined and has been withheld, he has not
even been made a chargesheet witness in this case. PW-10 has stated that he had left vehicle on
Jimmenama but why the vehicle was not sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory for examination
with regard to the bullet marks on the vehicle remained a question mark. PW-10 has stated in his
deposition that he had tried to record the statement of Patna High Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024
dt.25.09-2025 Asha Devi but she did not give her statement. In course of supervision also effort was
made to take the statement of the informant but she had refused.
59. This Court has noticed from the evidence of PW-1 that she has a different say about this. She has
stated that police was not taking interest in recording of the statement of the witnesses, therefore,
she filed a protest petition in the court of the learned Jurisdiction Magistrate. The Protest Petition
was filed on13.06.2003. She had made a complaint that the Senior Officers and the I.O. were not
taking interest in the matter. They were showing indifferent attitude as one of the accused in the
case happened to be the Samadhi of the then Chief Minister of the State of Bihar. To this Court, it
appears that the I.O. (PW-10) and the earlier I.O. both had not taken interest in the proper
investigation of the case.
Consideration
60. On going through the evidences available on the record and upon perusal of the impugned
judgment, it appears that the learned trial court has passed the impugned judgment in both the
trials i.e. Sessions Trial No. 246 of 2006 and Sessions Trial No. 246A of 2006 in the same words
verbatimly. In the present trial i.e. Sessions Trial No. 246 of 2006, the learned trial court has briefly
Patna High Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025 discussed the deposition of the
witnesses under the heading 'Findings' from paragraph '9' to '19'. In paragraph '20' of the impugned
judgment, the learned trial court has recorded the submissions advanced on behalf of the
prosecution and the informant. Some judgments referred by and on behalf of the prosecution have
been taken note of but not even briefly discussed. One of the judgments relied upon on behalf of the
prosecution was the judgment in the case of Harendra Rai (supra). The signature of PW-1 on her
written information has been marked Exhibit '1' but the written information has not been marked
Exhibit. The signature of the informant on her protest petition has been marked Exhibit '1/1', her
lawyers' signature on that is Exhibit '1/2' but the protest petition has not been exhibited. In
paragraph '21' of the impugned judgment, the trial court has recorded the submissions on behalf of
the defence. On behalf of the defence as well, some judgments were placed for consideration before
the learned trial court but nowhere considered. It appears that the learned trial court has considered
the case in paragraph '22' of the judgment. This paragraph '22' of the judgment in Sessions Trial No.
246 of 2006 is verbatimly the same and one as that of paragraph '20' of the impugned judgment in
Sessions Trial No. 246A of 2006. In fact, in paragraph '22' of the judgment in Sessions Trial No. 246
of 2006, Patna High Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025 the trial court has referred this
trial as Sessions Trial No. 246A of 2006.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155634626/ 26
The State Of Bihar Through The District ... vs Sunil Yadav @ Kana on 25 September, 2025
61. A perusal of the list of exhibits of the defence as mentioned in the impugned judgment of
Sessions Trial No. 246 of 2006 would show that Exhibit No. 'B' is the certified copy of the written
information and the FIR of Danapur P.S. Case No. 198 of 2003 dated 30.04.2003 but on perusal of
the records of the exhibits, this Court found that only formal FIR of Danapur P.S. Case No. 198 of
2003 dated 02.05.2003 is available on the record but the written information submitted by Pramod
Kumar, Inspector of Police, Danapur giving rise to Danapur P.S. Case No. 198 of 2003 has not been
brought on record. In Sessions Trial No. 246A of 2006, only the written information submitted by
Hawaldar M. M. Sattar giving rise to Danapur P.S. Case No. 199 of 2003 has been exhibited as
Exhibit 'B-1', therefore, this Court finds that the learned trial court has wrongly recorded in both the
judgments about the description of Exhibit 'B' and Exhibit 'B-1' respectively. It is also evident that
while the written information of Danapur P.S. Case No. 198 of 2003 has not been perused by the
trial court, the written information of M. M. Sattar, Hawaldar giving rise to Danapur P.S. Case No.
199 of 2003 has not at all been considered.
62. The trial court has committed grave error by taking into consideration the records of one trial for
purpose of its Patna High Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025 judgment in another
trial. The trial court says that because both the trials have originated from same P.S. Case i.e.
Danapur P.S. case No. 200 of 2003, so both the records will be perused for the ends of justice as well
as for the better appreciation of evidences. The trial court seems to have forgotten it's own order
dated 16.04.2024 whereby the Court restrained the defence from citing evidence adduced in one
trial in course of hearing of another trial. To this Court, there is no iota of doubt that the learned
trial court has completely erred by taking into consideration the evidences recorded in Sessions Trial
No. 246A of 2006 in delivering its judgment in Sessions Trial No. 246 of 2006. In the original
Sessions Trial No. 246 of 2006, eleven prosecution witnesses and one court witness had deposed,
whereas in Sessions Trial No. 246A of 2006, nine prosecution witnesses and one court witness
deposed. Similarly, as regards the documentary evidences in Sessions Trial No. 246 of 2006, the
prosecution exhibited writing of Rajnish on written report (Exhibit '2' with objection) and injury
report of Dheeraj Kumar (Exhibit '4' with objection) but in Sessions Trial No. 246 A of 2006, writing
of Rajnish was not exhibited and injury report of Dheeraj Kumar was marked Exhibit '5' (without
objection). It would appear that in paragraph '22' of the impugned judgment in Sessions Trial No.
246 of 2006 and paragraph '20' of the judgment in Trial No. 246A of 2006, the learned trial court
Patna High Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025 referred the injury report of Dheeraj
Kumar as Exhibit '4' even as in one of the trials, it is marked Exhibit '5'.
63. This Court further finds that in the impugned judgment, the learned trial court has taken a view
that PW-3 Sanjay Kumar has nowhere stated in his examination-in-chief regarding the injuries
sustained in the occurrence. The trial court seems to have fallen in error by taking PW-3 as the same
Sanjay @ Chunnu Sharma who according to the informant (PW-1) had sustained firearm injury in
the occurrence of the present case. In this connection, this Court would refer paragraph '1' of the
deposition of PW-1 in which she has stated that in the middle seat, she along with Sanjay @ Chunnu
were sitting. From perusal of the evidence of Nageshwar Prasad Yadav (PW-6), it would appear that
he has named Sanjay Sharma as one of the persons who was sitting with Asha Ji and Jeevan ji in the
middle seat. This very witness has stated that he had got information about the accused from
Chunnu Sharma. Dheeraj Kumar (PW-7) has stated that in the same vehicle, his aunt Asha Sinha,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155634626/ 27
The State Of Bihar Through The District ... vs Sunil Yadav @ Kana on 25 September, 2025
Chunnu Ji, Jeevan Ji, Rintu Ji, Nageshwar Ji and he was himself sitting. When the deposition of
Dheeraj Kumar (PW-7) is further read, it may be noticed that in paragraph (x) of his
cross-examination, he has stated that he was not aware about the place of residence of Sanjay @
Chunnu, thus, PW-7 has made it clear that Sanjay @ Chunnu is the same and one person. Rintu
Patna High Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025 Singh (PW-8) has also taken name of
Sanjay Ji @ Chunnu. A perusal of the evidence of the defence would show that Sanjay Sharma @
Chunnu Sharma was murdered and in this regard his mother Usha Devi had lodged a case giving
rise to Bihta P.S. Case No. 280 of 2009. In the said case, Ritlal Yadav and some other accused of this
case were charged of the offences under Sections 307/120B IPC and 302/120B IPC for the murder
of Sanjay @ Chunnu Sharma. During this period, Rit Lal Yadav was absconding. The informant had
alleged that he was a witness against Ritlal Yadav in the murder case of Satyanarayan Sinha,
therefore, he was killed. Despite presence of the certified copy of the judgment of the said case on
the record (Exhibit 'A'), the learned trial court has misunderstood the seizure list witness Sanjay
Kumar, son of Chhattu Rai (PW-5) as injured witness and made a comment in paragraph '22' of its
judgment that PW-3 has nowhere stated in his examination-in-chief regarding the injury sustained
in the occurrence. This is a gross mistake committed by the learned trial court.
64. On perusal of the records of Sessions Trial No. 246 of 2006, it appears that vide order dated
04.12.2015, the learned trial court allowed the defence documents to be taken on record and marked
exhibit. It is worth noting that even though the defence documents have been marked exhibits but
those have not been Patna High Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025 taken into
consideration. The formal FIR of Danapur P.S. Case No. 198 of 2003 clearly shows that it was sent
to the court of learned ACJM, Danapur only on 02.05.2003 i.e. after two days of the occurrence,
therefore, the submission of the prosecution that Danapur P.S. Case No. 198 of 2003 was registered
with an afterthought to help the accused persons was required to be considered seriously but the
trial court has given a go by to the said submission. The trial court could not notice from the records
that the written information of P.S. Case No. 198 of 2003 was not there with the certified copy of
formal FIR instead C.C. of the written information dated 01.05.2003 of Havildar M.M. Sattar was on
record. Nothing has been discussed by the learned trial court. The case diary of Danapur P.S. Case
No. 198 of 2003 was called for by a judicial order dated 28.06.2016 but that was not received on the
record of Sessions Trial No. 246 of 2006, still, the defence evidence was closed and then the case
was fixed for hearing.
65. In its order dated 14.06.2016, the learned trial court recorded the submissions of the parties,
perused the case record along with the case diary and found that DIG Central Range Ravindra
Kumar had conducted supervision of this case and his supervision report had been mentioned in
paragraph '114' of the case diary. The trial court held that the I.O. of this case has already been
examined, therefore, the court can look into the supervision Patna High Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of
2024 dt.25.09-2025 report of the DIG Central Range Ravindra Kumar. This Court finds that despite
this order of the trial court, the said supervision report as contained in paragraph '114' of the case
diary was neither exhibited nor looked into by the learned trial court but the trial court went on
recording that the statement of the prosecution witnesses had been recorded in presence of DIG
Central Range, therefore, it cannot be said that the I.O. (PW-10) was in collusion with the accused
persons. In the opinion of this Court, the finding of the learned trial court with regard to the conduct
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155634626/ 28
The State Of Bihar Through The District ... vs Sunil Yadav @ Kana on 25 September, 2025
of the I.O. (PW-
10) is not based on correct appreciation of the evidences on the record and the circumstances
pointing out to the indifferent attitude of the investigating agency in carrying on the investigation of
this case. The finding is perverse.
66. As regards the place of occurrence, the trial court has recorded that the I.O. of the case has given
a different place of occurrence than that of the place stated by the informant (PW-1). On perusal of
the evidence of I.O. (PW-10), we have noticed that he has categorically stated that place of
occurrence of the present case is the same and one which is the place of occurrence of Danapur P.S.
Case No. 198 of 2003. The learned trial court seems to have erred in appreciation of the evidences.
67. This Court has found that the conduct of investigation in this case has been done with
completely indifferent attitude Patna High Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025 initially
by the first I.O. and then by the second I.O. (PW-10). In the name of investigation only some
paperworks were done in the nature of formalities. The fact that the FIR of Danapur P.S. Case No.
198 of 2003 was sent to the court of learned ACJM, Danapur only 02.05.2003 would require a
serious consideration as it prima facie appears that the FIR has been ante-dated.
68. The trial court has not taken into consideration the protest petition which was filed by the
informant (PW-1). She had complained to the court that police was not conducting investigation
properly, the statement of the witnesses were not being recorded and because the samdhi of the
Chief Minister of the State was involved in this case, therefore, the senior police officers and the I.O.
have not taken any legal action in the matter. Exhibit '2' was filed in court on 13.06.2003. Only
thereafter the I.O. (PW-
10) recorded the statement of the informant on 14.06.2003.
69. This Court has further found from the evidence of the I.O. (PW-10) on the record that while
preparing the seizure list of the Bolero vehicle bearing Registration Number BR1T-0222 on
10.05.2003, he recorded only the colour, registration number, engine number and chassis number
of the vehicle in the description part of the seizure list. The vehicle was not sent to the FSL for
examination but in order to explain this inaction, the I.O. has stated that in case diary he had
recorded that when he contacted the Patna High Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025
informant to give her statement, she refused to give her statement and when he requested her to
send the Bolero vehicle to the FSL, she refused to do it. She had also refused to give the complete
name and addresses of the witnesses of the FIR. This Court is of the opinion that this statement of
the I.O. (PW-10) is required to be considered with reference to the case diary and the relevant date
on which he recorded it and in order to get a complete picture of the progress in investigation. The
vehicle was seized on 10.05.2003 and it was a lawful possession of the I.O. From the case diary it
appears that on or after 10.05.2003, the I.O. did not take any step to send the vehicle to the FSL,
therefore, despite being in lawful possession of the vehicle, the I.O. did not take further action to
collect the evidences. This only strengthens the claim of the informant (PW-1) as stated in her
protest petition that the senior police officers and the I.O. of the case were not taking legal action in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155634626/ 29
The State Of Bihar Through The District ... vs Sunil Yadav @ Kana on 25 September, 2025
the matter as one of the accused in this case was the samdhi of the then Chief Minister of the State.
70. The case of Harendra Rai (supra) was cited on behalf of the prosecution but it has not been even
looked into by the learned trial court. In the case of Harendra Rai (supra), the Hon'ble supreme
court has observed inter alia that the failure of the State machinery and failure of the trial court to
ensure a fair trial from the perspective of the victim side and the aspect of non- Patna High Court G.
APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025 marking of the FIR as an exhibit, non-production of the
formal witnesses in the trial would not vitiate the genuineness of the FIR and bayan tahriri. The
Hon'ble Supreme Court observed "... We refuse to give any discount to the accused persons for non-
exhibition thereof....".
71. Relying upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Ram Bihari Yadav vs.
State of Bihar reported in (1998) 4 SCC 517, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Harendra Rai
(supra) quoted paragraph '13' thereof as under:-
"13. Before parting with this case, we consider it appropriate to observe that though
the prosecution has to prove the case against the accused in the manner stated by it
and that any act or omission on the part of the prosecution giving rise to any
reasonable doubt would go in favour of the accused, yet in a case like the present one
where the record shows that investigating officers created a mess by bringing on
record Ext. 5/4 and GD Entry 517 and have exhibited remiss and/or deliberately
omitted to do what they ought to have done to bail out the appellant who was a
member of the police force or for any extraneous reason, the interest of justice
demands that such acts or omissions of the officers of the prosecution should not be
taken in favour of the accused, for that would amount to giving premium for the
wrongs of the prosecution designedly committed to favour the appellant. In such
cases, the story of the prosecution will have to Patna High Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of
2024 dt.25.09-2025 be examined dehors such omissions and contaminated conduct
of the officials otherwise the mischief which was deliberately done would be
perpetuated and justice would be denied to the complainant party and this would
obviously shake the confidence of the people not merely in the law- enforcing agency
but also in the administration of justice."
72. At this stage, we rely upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Paras Yadav
and Others vs. State of Bihar reported in (1999) 2 SCC 126, in paragraph '8' of the said judgment the
following observations have been made:-
"8. ... the lapse on the part of the investigating officer should not be taken in favour of
the accused. It may be that such lapse is committed designedly or because of
negligence. Hence, the prosecution evidence is required to be examined dehors such
omissions to find out whether the said evidence is reliable or not. ...."
73. Keeping in view the aforementioned judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court when we examine
the impugned judgment in the present case, it is found that the lapses on the part of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155634626/ 30
The State Of Bihar Through The District ... vs Sunil Yadav @ Kana on 25 September, 2025
investigation has been used against the prosecution and the benefit thereof has been given to the
accused without properly appreciating the evidence of the prosecution witnesses from the
perspective of the victim side.
Patna High Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025
74. We rely upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Edakkandi Dineshan
(supra) wherein it has been held that a part of the statement of the witness can be believed even
though some part of the statements may not be relied upon by the court. Paragraph '20' and '21' of
the judgment are quoted hereunder for a ready reference:-
"20. Either a partial, untrue version of one of the witnesses or an exaggerated version
of a witness may not be a sole reason to discard the entire prosecution case which is
otherwise supported by clinching evidence such as truthful version of the witnesses,
medical evidence, recovery of the weapons, etc. At this stage, it may not be out of
place to refer to the principle called as "falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus".
21. It is a settled position that "falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus" (false in one thing, false in
everything) that the above principle is foreign to our criminal law jurisprudence. This aspect has
been considered by this Court in a plethora of judgments. In Ram Vijay Singh v. State of U.P.5, a
three-Judge Bench of this Hon'ble Court had held that : (SCC pp. 254-55, paras 20-21) "20. We do
not find any merit in the arguments raised by the learned counsel for the appellant. A part statement
of a witness can be believed even though some part of the statement may not be relied upon by the
court. The maxim falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus is not the rule applied by the courts in India. This
Court recently in a judgment in Ilangovan v. State of T.N.6 held that Indian Courts have always been
reluctant to apply the principle as it is only a rule of caution. It was held as under : (SCC p. 536, para
11)
5. (2021) 15 SCC 241
6. (2020) 10 SCC 533 : (2021) 1 SCC (Cri) 137 Patna High Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024
dt.25.09-2025 '11. The counsel for the appellant lastly argued that once the witnesses had been
disbelieved with respect to the co-accused, their testimonies with respect to the present accused
must also be discarded. The counsel is, in effect, relying on the legal maxim "falsus in uno, falsus in
omnibus", which Indian Courts have always been reluctant to apply. A three-
Judge Bench of this Court, as far back as in 1957, in Nisar Ali v. State of U.P.7 held on this point as
follows : (SCC OnLine SC paras 9-10) "9. ... This maxim has not received general acceptance in
different jurisdictions in India nor has this maxim come to occupy the status of a rule of law. It is
merely a rule of caution.
All that it amounts to is that in such cases the testimony may be disregarded and not that it must be
disregarded. ...
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155634626/ 31
The State Of Bihar Through The District ... vs Sunil Yadav @ Kana on 25 September, 2025
10. The doctrine merely involves the question of weight of evidence which a court may apply in a
given set of circumstances, but it is not what may be called "a mandatory rule of evidence"."
21. Therefore, merely because a prosecution witness was not believed in respect of another accused,
the testimony of the said witness cannot be disregarded qua the present appellant. Still, further, it is
not necessary for the prosecution to examine all the witnesses who might have witnessed the
occurrence. It is the quality of evidence which is relevant in criminal trial and not the quantity."
(emphasis in original)"
7. 1997 SCC Online SC 42 : AIR 1957 SC 366 Patna High Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of
2024 dt.25.09-2025
75. We further find that the consideration of the evidences adduced in Sessions Trial
No. 246A of 2006 in the name of ends of justice and for the better appreciation of
evidences is not correct. In this regard, the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court
in the case of A.T. Mydeen (supra) and the judgment in the case of State of Kerala vs.
Joseph reported in (2014) 16 SCC 385 which has also been referred by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in A.T. Mydeen (supra) are laying down the law. In the said case, the
High Court had considered the evidence of one sessions case which tried some of the
accused in another sessions case, which was trying another set of accused arising out
of same offence and acquitted all the accused. The Hon'ble Supreme Court held that
the High Court was not right in considering the evidence of one case for another case
and accordingly set aside the judgment of the High Court and remanded the matter
to the High Court for fresh disposal. Thus, in the present case, we find that the
learned trial court has erred on this count also.
76. The trial court has taken an adverse inference for the fact that Rambabu Pathik
was not chargesheeted by the investigating agency, the final form was submitted by
police which was accepted by learned jurisdictional Magistrate and even in course of
trial, the prosecution did not invoke Section 319 CrPC to summon Rambabu Pathik.
According to the trial court, such things Patna High Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024
dt.25.09-2025 are more relevant. In our opinion, this finding of the trial court is
completely perversed. The trial court had before it the statement of the prosecution
witnesses and the court was aware of the provision of Section 319 CrPC. If the court
was satisfied from the evidences that any person not being an accused has committed
any offence for which such person could be tried together with the accused, the court
could have proceeded against the said person and under subsection (2) of Section 319
CrPC such person could have been summoned. Instead of acting in accordance with
law, the trial court drew an adverse inference against the prosecution case to fail it.
77. We have further noticed that the learned trial court has doubted the statement of
PW-1 also for the reason that in her written information, she had stated that Arun
Kumar was in the Bolero vehicle but in course of trial, in paragraph '20' of her
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155634626/ 32
The State Of Bihar Through The District ... vs Sunil Yadav @ Kana on 25 September, 2025
deposition, she has stated that Arun Kumar was injured in Danapur P.S. Case No. 198
of 2003 and other witnesses have stated that he had died. The trial court has raised a
doubt that as to how it was probable that a man injured and died in another case was
sitting along with deceased husband of the informant. In our considered opinion, the
learned trial court has completely missed out in appreciating and co-relating the
sequence of events and seems to have gone by the date of registration of the cases. In
this connection, the trial court did not notice that Danapur P.S. Case No. Patna High
Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025 198 of 2003 was though shown
registered on 30.04.2003 but the FIR was sent to the court of learned jurisdictional
magistrate on 02.05.2003 only. The written information giving rise to the said case
was not before the learned trial court, otherwise it would have thrown much light on
the sequence of events. The trial court did not notice that though Exhibit 'B' is said to
be the written information and FIR of Danapur P.S. Case No. 198 of 2003 but on
record it was only the formal FIR and not the written information which was the
basis of the FIR. This has led to recording of a finding on the basis of half hearted
facts present on the record.
78. We have earlier noticed the judgments placed before us by learned Additional
Public Prosecutor for the State. We are of the considered opinion that on the face of
the several perverse findings of the learned trial court and the other reasons which we
have stated hereinabove, the impugned judgment of acquittal is liable to be set aside.
In the case of Ganesha (supra) the Hon'ble supreme court has observed as under:-
"... where the finding of acquittal is recorded on account of misreading of evidence or
non-
consideration of evidence or perverse appreciation of evidence, nothing prevents the
High Court from setting aside the order of acquittal at the instance of the informant
in revision and directing fresh disposal on merit by the trial court. In the event of
such direction, the Patna High Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024 dt.25.09-2025 trial
court shall be obliged to reappraise the evidence in light of the observation of the
Revisional Court and take an independent view uninfluenced by any of the
observations of the Revisional Court on the merit of the case. ... "
79. On going through the judgment of the learned trial court, we have found that it is not only a cut
and paste in reasoning and rationale, the learned trial court has not at all appreciated the ocular
evidences independently. The trial court seems to have been swayed away by taking into
consideration the lacunae in the investigation of the case. This has resulted in miscarriage of justice.
Since this Court has found that some of the documents which were properly available on the record
and on which the signature of the prosecution witnesses have been marked exhibits, but the
documents have not been marked exhibit, the document which has been marked exhibit (certified
copy of the written information of Danapur P.S. Case No. 198 of 2003) is not available on the record
of the trial court and the trial court has not taken any effort to discuss those important documents,
this Court is of the considered opinion that the impugned judgment of the trial court would be liable

to be set aside. Accordingly, we set aside the impugned judgment and remit the matter to the
learned trial court for a fresh consideration after ensuring that the documents as discussed above be
duly taken on record and marked exhibits. Patna High Court G. APP. (DB) No.6 of 2024
dt.25.09-2025
80. The learned trial court shall hear the parties and dispose of the matter as early as possible. This
Court would place on record that earlier the trial of this case has already been delayed, therefore, all
endeavours and efforts be made to decide the matter without granting unnecessary adjournments. It
is expected that the trial court would decide the matter preferably within a period of four months
from the date of receipt of this order with the trial court records.
81. While parting with this judgment, this Court would express its anguish on the manner in which
the records of the case have been maintained. We have noticed that a number of important
documents are lying on the record in torn condition and are getting destroyed. This Court would,
therefore, direct the learned Registrar General of this Court to issue appropriate direction to the
concerned Section/Office of this Court to get the records properly arranged and safely preserved.
The documents which are getting damaged and destroyed be preserved in digital form.
82. Let this exercise be done within a period of two weeks from today and thereafter the trial court
records with a copy of the judgment be sent to the court of learned Additional Sessions
Judge-III-cum-Special Judge MP/MLA Court through a special messenger.

83. The accused-private respondents shall surrender in the trial court within two weeks from today,
if they are on bail, then the trial court shall obtain fresh bail bonds from the accused- private
respondents.
84. It is made clear that the observations of this Court hereinabove shall not prejudice the case of
the either parties and the trial court shall conduct an independent reappraisal of the entire
evidences and take a view uninfluenced by the observations of this Court on merit.
85. The appeals are allowed to the extent indicated hereinabove.
