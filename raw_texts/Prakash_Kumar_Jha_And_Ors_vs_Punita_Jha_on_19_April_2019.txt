CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE ASHWANI KUMAR SINGH
ORAL JUDGMENT
Date : 19-04-2019 Heard learned counsel for the petitioners.
2. This application under Article 227 of the Constitution of India has been filed by the petitioners for
quashing the order dated 10.12.2018 passed by learned Sub-Judge-VII, Patna High Court C.Misc.
No.243 of 2019 dt.19-04-2019 Katihar in Title Suit No. 341 of 2015 whereby the application filed by
the defendants-petitioners under Section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure (for short 'CPC') seeking
stay of the suit has been rejected.
3. Learned counsel appearing for the petitioners submitted that the plaintiff-opposite party filed title
suit claiming title over the land involved in the suit by virtue of adverse possession against the

defendants-petitioners bearing Title Suit No. 341 of 2015. The suit land in question is 0.08 decimals
and 8 karis land of Plot No. 2542 of Khata No. 1163 of Mauza- Dalan, P.S.- Sahayak in the district of
Katihar. After service of summon, the defendants-petitioners appeared in the suit and filed their
written statement. The defendants-petitioners claimed their right, title, interest and peaceful
possession. After filing of the written statement, issues were also framed in the said suit. The
defendants- petitioners then moved a petition under Section 10 of the CPC for stay of the suit on the
ground that there is already one title suit vide Title Suit No. 131 of 2008 pending consideration in
which plaintiff Kalu Uraon and seven others also claimed title over the lands including the suit land
of the suit filed by the plaintiff- opposite party. In that case also, the present petitioners are
defendants. On the basis of the aforesaid submissions, learned Patna High Court C.Misc. No.243 of
2019 dt.19-04-2019 counsel for the petitioners submitted that the order passed by the court below is
legally not sustainable. Since the suit land is already part of the suit land of the previously instituted
suit and title, interest and possession over the same is claimed by the plaintiffs of the previous suit,
the present suit ought to have been stayed by the trial court. He has further contended that the trial
court ought to have considered that in the subsequent suit, the matter in issue, is substantially the
same, as in the previously instituted Title Suit No. 131 of 2008.
4. Having heard learned counsel for the petitioners and carefully perused the record, I find no merit
in this application.
5. Section 10 of the CPC provides that no court shall proceed with the trial of any suit in which the
matter in issue is also directly and substantially in issue in a previously instituted suit between the
same parties, or between parties under whom they or any of them claim litigating under the same
title where such suit is pending in the same or any other court in India having jurisdiction to grant
the relief claimed, or in any court beyond the limits of India established, or continued by the Central
Government and having like jurisdiction, or before the Supreme Court.
Patna High Court C.Misc. No.243 of 2019 dt.19-04-2019
6. It would be evident from perusal of Section 10 of the CPC that where a suit is instituted in a court
to which the CPC applies, the court shall not proceed with the trial of the suit, if the matter in issue
in the suit is directly and substantially in issue in a previously instituted suit between the same
parties and the previously instituted suit is pending- (i) in the same court in which the subsequent
suit is brought; or in any other court in India; or
(iii) in any court beyond the limits of India established or continued by the Central Government; or
before the Supreme Court.
7. Thus, it would be evident that the object of Section 10 of the CPC is to prevent courts of different
jurisdiction from simultaneously trying parallel suits in respect of the same matter in issue. The
object is to avoid recording of conflicting findings in more than one proceeding where the matter in
issue is directly and substantially the same between the same parties.

8. In the instant case, cause of action in both the suits are different and even the parties are
different. The subject matter are also different. Thus, no case for stay of the suit was made out. The
instant suit filed by the plaintiff-opposite party is for declaration of title by law of adverse possession
by a third person whereas declaration of title simplicitor in between the Patna High Court C.Misc.
No.243 of 2019 dt.19-04-2019 parties in which the plaintiff-opposite party is not involved is the
subject matter of the earlier suit. Thus, the trial court has rightly held that Section 10 of the CPC is
not applicable and has rejected the prayer of the petitioner.
9. Accordingly, the application, being devoid of any merit, is dismissed.
