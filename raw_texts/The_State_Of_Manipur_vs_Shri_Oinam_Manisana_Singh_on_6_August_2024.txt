Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72995545/ 9
The State Of Manipur vs Shri Oinam Manisana Singh on 6 August, 2024
petitioners filed a writ petition being W.P.(C) No. 137 of 2018 for quashing the impugned order
dated 07.11.2017.
However, vide order dated 07.02.2022, the Hon'ble Single Judge of this High Court disposed of the
said writ petition being W.P.(C) No. 137of 2018 whereby quashing and setting aside the order dated
07.11.2017 issued by the Principal Secretary (Education/S), Government of Manipur with a direction
to the appellants/State respondents to consider the cases of the respondents/writ petitioners for
absorption in Government service W.A. No. 33 of 2023 Page 12 w.e.f. the date on which they have
been approved by the Department of Education (S), Government of Manipur as approved teachers
in their respective Aided High School. The operative portion of the order dated 07.11.2017is
extracted herein below:
"In the result, the writ petition is allowed by quashing and setting aside the impugned
order dated 07.11.2017 issued by the Principal Secretary, Education (S), Government
of Manipur and the respondents are directed to consider the cases of the petitioners
for absorption in Government service with effect from the date on which they have
been approved by the Department of Education (S) as approved Teachers in their
respective erstwhile aided high schools. The whole exercise should be completed
within a period of 3 (three) months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
With the aforesaid directions, the present writ petition is disposed of, however,
without any costs."
[8] Challenging the order dated 07.02.2022 impugned herein passed by the Hon'ble Single Judge of
this High Court in W.P.(C) No. 137 of 2018, the present writ appeal has been instituted on the
following grounds:
(i) The Ld. Single Judge, without properly examining the relevant facts and law of the
writ petition, passed the impugned order dated 07-02-2022 in W.P. (C) No. 137 of
2018.
(ii) The Ld. Single Judge, without properly examining the counter affidavit of the
appellants/respondents, passed the impugned aforesaid order.
(iii) In the counter affidavit, the
appellants/respondents have clearly and
specifically mentioned that the conversion of the erstwhile 13(thirteen) Aided High
Schools was done in pursuance of the Cabinet Decision/Policy Decision of the
Government. However, this W.A. No. 33 of 2023 Page 13 aspect was not properly
examined by the Ld. Single Judge. In the catena of Hon'ble Supreme Court decision,
it is held that a Writ Court cannot interfere with any policy decision of the
Government.
(iv) The appellants further contended in the counter affidavit that the conversion of
the erstwhile 13(thirteen) Aided High Schools into full-fledged Government High
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72995545/ 10
The State Of Manipur vs Shri Oinam Manisana Singh on 6 August, 2024
Schools only Teachers/staffs who were approved by the Education Department, shall
be retained and their service shall be commenced from the date of conversion and
their pay and next date of increment will only be protected. However, this aspect was
over looked by the Ld. Single Judge.
(v) The appellants further stated in the counter affidavit that in pursuance of the
Cabinet Decision and also in pursuance of the Finance Department (PIC), in
conversion of 13(thirteen) Government Aided High Schools into full-fledged
Government High Schools, the Education Department will retain only approved
teachers/staffs and those untrained Graduate Teachers shall undergo the B.Ed.
Course as per NCTE norms and the order shall be with immediate effect i.e. with
effect from the date of the order of Administrative Department.
(vi) The Ld. Single Judge misinterpreted Government Aided/Private Institution
taking over by the Government Rules 1981 in the Section 7(b), wherein it is clearly
mentioned that the service rendered by the employees of the Government
Aided/Private Institutions on an equated post shall be counted as experienced or
service required for W.A. No. 33 of 2023 Page 14 promotion or direct recruitment, as
the case may be. However, the Ld. Single Judge misinterpreted this section 7(b) of
the Government Aided/Private Institutions taking over by the Government Rules,
1981. Therefore, the impugned Judgment & order dated 07-02-2022 passed in W.P.
(C) No. 137 of 2018 is liable to be quashed.
(vii) After the introduction of National Pension
Scheme (NPS) w.e.f. 01-01-2005, any
Government employees who entered into service have to subscribe the National
Pension Scheme.
The service of the writ petitioners were regularised/entered in the year 2013 as such, their case will
be governed by the National Pension Scheme.
(viii) The writ petitioners do not challenge the Government order dated 22-02-2016 before the Ld.
Single Judge. As such, as long as the Government order dated 22-02-2016 remained, the service
condition of the writ petitioners has to be governed by the Government order dated 22-02-2016.
(ix) The present writ appeal could not be filed within time because the reason explained in the
separate application for condonation of delay occurred in filing the present writ appeal is bonafide
and un- intentional and delay caused was due to the circumstances beyond the control of the
appellants. And as such, the Hon'ble Court may be pleased to condone the delay and the appeal be
heard on merit, in view of the facts and circumstances enumerated in the memo of Appeal.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72995545/ 13
The State Of Manipur vs Shri Oinam Manisana Singh on 6 August, 2024
(viii) and the rest of the grounds have been discussed and decided properly by the Ld.
Single Judge in the impugned order.
[11] As submitted by the learned counsel for the appellants, the conversion of the 13 (thirteen)
Government Aided High Schools into full-fledged Government High Schools with the rider that the
Education Department will retain only approve teachers/staffs and those untrained teachers shall
undergo as per NCTE norms and other shall be with immediate effect i.e. with effect from the date of
the order of Administrative Department was done in pursuance of the W.A. No. 33 of 2023 Page 17
Cabinet policy/policy decision of the Government as such, a Writ Court cannot interfere with any
policy decision of the Government.
It is an admitted fact that the administrative decision/cabinet policy/policy decision of the
Government, if arbitrariness is not committed in taking the said decision, Court cannot interfere
with any policy decision of the Government. But, in the instant case, on perusal of the facts as put
out by both the learned counsels, the commission of the arbitrariness on the part of the Government
in taking policy decision is evident.
In this regard, the Ld. Single Judge discussed about it in detail. Para No. 17 of the impugned
judgment is extracted herein below:
"[17] After hearing the learned counsel appearing for the parties at length and after
careful examination of the records, this Court finds force and merit in the
submissions made on behalf of the petitioners. On careful examination of the
memorandum for Cabinet dated 27.11.2015 and the proposal made there under as
well as the State Cabinet decision taken on 27.11.2015 approving the proposal for
conversion of 13 (thirteen) Government Aided High Schools to full-fledged
Government High Schools and absorption of the services of the approved employees
(three Graduate Teachers and one LDC) for each schools, no condition was
mentioned either in the said memorandum for Cabinet or in the said decision of the
Cabinet for effecting such conversion or absorption with effect from the date of issue
of order by the Administrative Department. However, the Finance Department, while
conveying concurrence to the aforesaid State Cabinet decision, incorporated the
condition that the order shall be with effect from the date of issue of order by the
Administrative Department. On examination of the relevant files of the Finance
Department produced by the respondents, no reason whatsoever were given or
disclosed by the Finance Department for adding or incorporating the condition that
the order WP(C) No. 137 of 2018 Page 19 should be with effect from the date of issue
of the order by the Administrative Department. Accordingly, this Court is of the
considered view that the said condition imposed by the W.A. No. 33 of 2023 Page 18
Finance Department is neither in conformity with the decision taken by the State
Cabinet, nor is it supported by any reason, hence, the act of the Finance Department
imposing such conditions is arbitrary and therefore legally unsustainable."

The State Of Manipur vs Shri Oinam Manisana Singh on 6 August, 2024
[12] With the above observation, the Ld. Single Judge rightly relied upon the following Apex Court's
judgment & orders, Para No. 18, 19, 20, 21 & 22are extracted herein below:
"[18] In the case of "Shrilekha Vidyarthi Vs. State of U.P." reported in (1991) 1 SCC
212, the Hon'ble Apex Court held as under:-
"36. The meaning and true import of arbitrariness is more easily visualised than
precisely stated or defined. The question, whether an impugned act is arbitrary or
not, is ultimately to be answered on the facts and in the circumstances of a given case.
An obvious test to apply is to see whether there is any discernible principle emerging
from the impugned act and if so, does it satisfy the test of reasonableness. Where a
mode is prescribed for doing an act and there is no impediment in following that
procedure, performance of the act otherwise and in a manner which does not disclose
any discernible principle which is reasonable, may itself attract the vice of
arbitrariness. Every State action must be informed by reason and it follows that an
act uninformed by reason, is arbitrary. The rule of law contemplates governance by
laws and not by humour, whims or caprices of the men to whom the governance is
entrusted for the time being. It is trite that 'be you ever so high, the laws are above
you'. This is what men in power must remember, always."
[19] In the case of "East Coast Railway Vs. Mahadev Appa Rao" reported in (2010) 7 SCC 678
(Supra), it has been held by the Hon'ble Apex Court as under:-
"23. Arbitrariness in the making of an order by an authority can manifest itself in
different forms. Non- application of mind by the authority making the order is only
one of them. Every order passed by a public authority must disclose due and proper
application of mind by the person making the order. This may be evident from the
order itself or the record contemporaneously maintained. Application of mind is best
demonstrated by disclosure of mind by the authority making the order. And
disclosure is best done by recording the reasons that led the authority W.A. No. 33 of
2023 Page 19 to pass the order in question. Absence of reasons either in the order
passed by the authority or in the record contemporaneously maintained is clearly
suggestive of the order being arbitrary hence legally unsustainable."
[20] In the case of "Union of India Vs. International Trading Co." reported in (2003) 5 SCC 437, it
has been held by the Hon'ble Apex Court at Para 16 that where a particular mode is prescribed for
doing an act and there is no impediment in adopting the procedure, the deviation to act in different
manner which does not disclose any discernible principle which is reasonable itself shall be labelled
as arbitrary. Every State action must be informed by reason and it follows that an act uninformed by
reason is per se arbitrary. [21] In the case of "State of Orissa Vs. Dhaniram Luhar" reported in
(2004) 5 SCC 568, it has been held by the Hon'ble Apex Court as under:-
"7. Reason is the heartbeat of every conclusion, without the same it becomes lifeless."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72995545/ 15
The State Of Manipur vs Shri Oinam Manisana Singh on 6 August, 2024
"8. Even in respect of administrative orders Lord Denning M.R. in Breen V. Amalgamated Engg.
Union observed: "the giving of reason is one of the fundamental of good administration". In
Alexander Machinery (Dudley) Ltd. Vs. Crabtree it was observed: "Failure to give reason amounts to
denial of justice". "Reasons are live links between the mind of the decision-taker to the controversy
in question and the decision or conclusion arrived at". Reasons substitute subjectivity by objectivity.
The emphasis on recording reasons is that if the decision reveals the "inscrutable face of the sphinx",
it can be its silence, render it virtuallyimpossible for the Courts to perform their appellate function
or exercise the power of judicial review in adjudging the validity of the decision. Right to reason is
an indispensable part of a sound judicial system; reasons at least sufficient to indicate an application
of mind to the matter before Court. Another rational is that the affected party can know why the
decision as gone against him. One of the salutary requirements of natural justice is spelling out
reasons for the order made; in other words, a speaking-out "inscrutable face of the sphinx" is
ordinarily incongruous with a judicial or quasi-judicial performance".
[22] In the case of "Krishna Swami Vs. Union of India" reported in (1992) 4 SCC 605, it has been
held by the Hon'ble Apex Court at Para 47 that -
"47. ....... Undoubtedly, in a parliamentary democracy governed by rule of law, any
action, decision or order of any statutory/public W.A. No. 33 of 2023 Page 20
authority/functionary must be founded upon reasons stated in the order or staring
from the record. Reasons are the links between the material, the foundation for their
erection and the actual conclusions. They would also demonstrate how the mind of
the maker was activated and actuated and their rational nexus and synthesis with the
facts considered and the conclusions reached. Lest it would be arbitrary, unfair and
unjust, violating Article 14 or unfair procedure offending Article 21. But expectations
are envisaged keeping institutional pragmatism into play, conscious as we are of each
other's limitations".
After discussing the above fact with the observation made by the Hon'ble Apex Court, the Ld. Single
Judge rightly observed that the imposition of the condition by the Finance Department was
arbitrary and accordingly, unsustainable in law and the same is reproduced herein below:
"23. In view of the facts and circumstances of the present case and in view of the
above-quoted well settled principle of law laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court, this
Court has no hesitation to hold that imposition of the condition by the Finance
Department for absorption of the services of the petitioners with effect from the date
of issue of order by the Administrative Department without assigning or disclosing
any reason is per se arbitrary and accordingly unsustainable in law."
With respect to Grounds No. (iii), (iv) and (v), the Ld. Single Judge rightly and satisfactorily
discussed this aspect of the matter at Para No. 17 of the impugned judgment and order supported by
Hon'ble Apex Court's orders and the same is extracted herein below:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72995545/ 16
The State Of Manipur vs Shri Oinam Manisana Singh on 6 August, 2024
"17. After hearing the learned counsel appearing for the parties at length and after
careful examination of the records, this Court finds force and merit in the
examination of the memorandum for Cabinet dated 27.11.2015 and the proposal
made there under as well as the State Cabinet decision taken on 27.11.2015 approving
the proposal for conversion of 13 (thirteen) Government Aided High Schools to
full-fledged W.A. No. 33 of 2023 Page 21 Government High Schools and absorption
of the services of the approved employees (three Graduate Teachers and one LDC) for
each school, no condition was mentioned either in the said memorandum for Cabinet
or in the said decision of the Cabinet for effecting such conversion or absorption with
effect from the date of issue of order by the Administrative Department. However,
the Finance Department, while conveying concurrence to the aforesaid State Cabinet
decision, incorporated the condition that the order shall be with effect from the date
of issue of order by the Administrative Department. On examination of the relevant
files of the Finance Department produce by the respondents, no reason whatsoever
were given or disclosed by the Finance Department for adding or incorporating the
condition that the order should be with effect from the date of issue of the order by
the Administrative Department. Accordingly, this Court is of the considered view that
the said condition imposed by the Finance Department is either in conformity with
the decision taken by the State Cabinet, nor is it supported by any reason, hence, the
act of the Finance Department imposing such conditions is arbitrary and therefore
legally unsustainable."
[13] Furthermore, it is an admitted fact that in similarly situated position with the facts of the
instant case, while conversion of the 2 (two) Aided High Schools to full-fledged Government High
Schools i.e. (i) Heirok Part - I Aided High School and (ii) Sagang Aided High School, in the said two
orders, the State Government clearly allowed the absorption of the services of the approved
employees of the said two schools in Government services w.e.f. the date of entering their services as
approved employees for the purpose of pension benefit only.
[14] On further perusal, such absorptions have been allowed by the State Government as per the
provisions of the Manipur Civil Services (Appointment and Other Service Conditions of Employees
of Government Aided/Private Institutions taken over by the Government Rules, 1981). Admittedly,
this fact is not denied by the appellants W.A. No. 33 of 2023 Page 22 anywhere in the present appeal
as well as the counter affidavit filed in the writ petition. In deciding this point, the Ld. Single Judge
appropriately discussed about the exercise of the powers conferred by the proviso to Article 309 of
the Constitution of India framed rules called "The Manipur Civil Service Appointment and Other
Service Conditions of Employees of Government Aided/Private Institutions taken over by the
Government Rules, 1981" and also rightly referred Rule 7 of the said Rules; for convenience sake,
the same is extracted herein below:
"7. Protection of past service :
(a) The persons so appointed in the Government service shall be deemed to have
been appointed in the same capacity as in the Government Aided/Private
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72995545/ 17
The State Of Manipur vs Shri Oinam Manisana Singh on 6 August, 2024
Institutions, i.e. Temporary, Officiating, Substantive, as the case may be, and the
condition of probation and confirmation shall be deemed to have been waived in case
of substantive or permanent officials.
(b) The service rendered by the employees of the Government Aided/Private
Institutions on an equated post shall be counted as experience or service required for
promotion or direct recruitment as the case may be."
[15] It is settled principle of law that one should not be discriminated and the equality clause
enshrined under Article 14 & 16 of the Constitution of India must be preserved and protected. The
Apex Court in Union of India vs. K.T. Shashtri reported in AIR 1990 SC 598,as extracted in the
impugned judgment & order of the Ld. Single Judge,observed that -
[13] In support of his contentions, the learned counsel relied on the judgment rendered by the
Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of "Union of India Vs. K.T. Shashtri" reported in AIR 1990 SC 598
wherein, the Hon'ble Apex Court held as under:
W.A. No. 33 of 2023 Page 23 "5. It is this decision which is challenged before us by the appellants.
Mr. Subba Rao, learned counsel appearing for the appellants contended that the Government had a
right to prescribe different conditions of service for the members belonging to the different units,
and merely because the superannuation age of the members of the DRDS was increased, it could not
be held that the respondent who belonged to another unit, viz. DAQAS, was entitled to the said
benefit. There is no dispute that the Government has power to vary the service conditions of the
members of the services from time to time. The question involved in the present appeal is, however,
not whether the Government had such power. The question is whether the respondent was also
entitled to the benefit of the power so exercised in the facts and circumstances of the case. The
admitted facts are that in 1966 when the respondent was recruited to the Defence Science Service,
the three units belonged to the said Service and the employees were recruited initially to that service
and then sent to different units. The service conditions of the employees belonging to the three units
were the same and their services were interchangeable between the three units. The Service Rules
which applied to all the three units were also common, viz. Defence Science Service Rules. The three
units, therefore, belonged to and constituted one single service. It is later in the year 1979, that the
Defence Research Service was reconstituted into three different services as stated above. However,
at that time, admittedly no option was given to the employees working in the different units to opt
for one or the other of the units. It appears that those who were already working in either of the
three units were deemed to belong to the respective newly constituted service. This being so, their
service conditions will have to run parallel and no discrimination can be made between them by an
unilateral action. The classification made between them further has no rational basis and no nexus
of such classification to the object sought to be achieved has been shown to us by Mr. Subba Rao
appearing for the appellants. In the circumstances, the denial of the benefit of the enhanced
superannuation age to the members of one unit while the same is granted to the members of the
other unit amounts to discrimination, violative of Article 16 of the Constitution. We are, therefore,
satisfied that the decision of the Tribunal is both W.A. No. 33 of 2023 Page 24 proper and valid, and
there is no substance in the present appeal. The appeal is, therefore, dismissed."

The State Of Manipur vs Shri Oinam Manisana Singh on 6 August, 2024
[16] Furthermore, the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed in this matter in series of its judgment &
orders:
Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board &Anr. V. Prakash Dal Mill &Ors.
(2011) 6 SCC 714-
"23. The Board being State within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of
India is required to act fairly, reasonably and not arbitrarily or whimsically. The
guarantee of equality before law or equal protection of the law under Article 14
embraces within its realm exercise of discretionary powers by the State. The High
Court examined the entire issue on the touchstone of Article 14 of the Constitution of
India. It has been observed b that the fixation of price done by the Board has violated
Article 14 of the Constitution of India. It is correctly observed that though Clause 7(b)
permits the Board to fix the final price of the demised premises, it cannot be said that
where the Board arbitrarily or irrationally fixes the final price of the site without any
basis, such fixation of the price could bind the lessee. In such circumstances, the
Court will have the jurisdiction to annul the decision, upon declaring the same to be
void and non est."
East Coast Railway &Anr. V. Mahadev Appa Rao &Ors. (2010) 7 SCC 678 -
"9. There is no quarrel with the well-settled proposition of law that an order passed
by a public authority exercising administrative/executive or statutory powers must be
judged by the reasons stated in the order or any record or file contemporaneously
maintained. It follows that the infirmity arising out of the absence of reasons cannot
be cured by the authority passing the order stating such reasons in an affidavit filed
before the court where the validity of any such order is under challenge. The legal
position in this regard is settled by the decision of this Court in Commr. of Police v.
Gordhandas Bhanji wherein this Court observed: (AIR p. 18, para 9) "9.... public
orders, publicly made, in exercise of a statutory authority cannot be construed in the
light of explanations subsequently given by the officer making the order of what he
meant, or of what was in his mind, or what he intended to do. Public orders made by
public authorities are meant to have public effect and are intended to affect the
actings and conduct of those to whom they are addressed and W.A. No. 33 of 2023
Page 25 must be construed objectively with reference to the language used in the
order itself."
17. It is trite that Article 14 of the Constitution strikes at arbitrariness which is an antithesis of the
guarantee contained in Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. Whether or not the cancellation of the
typing test was arbitrary is a question which the Court shall have to examine once a challenge is
mounted to any such action, no matter the candidates do not have an indefeasible right to claim an
appointment against the advertised posts.

The State Of Manipur vs Shri Oinam Manisana Singh on 6 August, 2024
23. Arbitrariness in the making of an order by an authority can manifest itself in different forms.
Non-application of mind by the authority making the order is only one of them. Every order passed
by a public authority must disclose due and proper application of mind by the person making the
order. This may be evident from the order itself or the record contemporaneously maintained.
Application of mind is best demonstrated by disclosure of mind by the authority making the order.
And disclosure is best done by recording the reasons that led the authority to pass the order in
question. Absence of reasons either in the order passed by the authority or in the record
contemporaneously maintained is clearly suggestive of the order being arbitrary hence legally
unsustainable."

Petitioner V. Union of India &Ors. Respondents (Writ Petn. No. 5 of 1966) C.K. Tikku Appellate
Asstt. Commissioner of Income Tax, Intervener [AIR 1967 SC 1427] -
"14. In this context it is important to emphasize that the absence of arbitrary power is
the first essential of the rule of law upon which our whole constitutional system is
based. In a system governed by rule of law, discretion, when conferred upon
executive authorities, must be confined within clearly defined limits. The rule of law
from this point of view means that decisions should be made by the application of
known principles and rules and in general, such decisions should be predictable and
the citizen should know where he is. If a decision is taken without any principle or
without any rule it is unpredictable and such a decision is the antithesis of a decision
taken in accordance with the rule of law. (See Dicey- "Law of the Constitution - Tenth

5. It this decision which is challenged before us by the appellants. Mr. Subba Rao, learned counsel
appearing for the appellants contended that the Government had a right to prescribe different
conditions of service for the members belonging to the different units, and merely because the
superannuation age of the members of the DRDS was increased, it could not be held that the
respondent who belonged to another unit, viz. DAQAS, was entitled to the said benefit. There is no
dispute that the Government has power to vary the service conditions of the members of the services
from time to time. The question involved in the present appeal is, however, not whether the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72995545/ 20
The State Of Manipur vs Shri Oinam Manisana Singh on 6 August, 2024
Government had such power. The question is whether the respondent was also entitled to the
benefit of the power so exercised in the facts and circumstances of the case. The admitted facts are
that in 1966 when the respondent was recruited to the Defence Science Service, the three units
belonged to the said Service and the employees were recruited initially to that service and then sent
to different units. The service conditions of the employees belonging to the three units were the
same and their services were interchangeable between the three units. The Service Rules which
applied to all the three units were also common, viz. Defence Science Service Rules. The three units,
therefore, belonged to and constituted one single service. It is later in the year 1979, that the Defence
Research Service was reconstituted into three different services as stated above. However, at that
time, admittedly no option was given to the employees working in the different units to opt for one
or the other of the units. It appears that those who were already working in either of the three units
were deemed to belong to the respective newly constituted service. This being so, their service
conditions will have to run parallel and no discrimination can be made between them by an
unilateral action. The classification made between them further has no rational basis and no nexus
of such classification to 'the object sought to be achieved has been shown to us by Mr. Subba Rao
appearing for the appellants. In the circumstances, the denial of the benefit of the enhanced
superannuation age to the members of one unit while the same is granted to the members of the
other unit amounts to discrimination, violative of Article 16 of the Constitution, We are, therefore,
satisfied that the decision of the Tribunal W.A. No. 33 of 2023 Page 27 is both proper and valid, and
there is no substance in the present appeal. The appeal is, therefore, dismissed.
[17] The decision and observation made above by the Hon'ble Supreme Court is squarely covered in
the present case. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in State of Himachal Pradesh &Anr. Vs. Sheela Devi
reported in (2023) SCC OnLine SC 1272, observed that "7. The State, in justification of its appeal
contends through the Learned Advocate General that the High Court's reasoning is erroneous. It is
submitted that Rule 17 of the CCS Pension Rules, 1972 (hereafter called the Pension Rules) is
inapplicable, having regard to the exclusionary definition in Rule 2(g). It is further stated that one of
the express terms of contract which the employees voluntarily entered into, was that barring
specified statutory rules, no other service rules applicable to the regular or permanent employees
were applicable to them.
8. At the outset, it would be necessary to extract Rules 2 and 17 of the CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972
(hereinafter "Pension Rules") which reads as follows:-
"2. Application-Save as otherwise provided in these rules, [these rules shall apply to
Government servant appointed on or before the 31st day of December, 2003]
including civilian Government servants in the Defence Services, appointed
substantively to civil services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union
which are borne on pensionable establishments, but shall not apply to-
(a) railways servants;
(b) person in casual and daily rated
employment;
(c) persons paid from contingencies;
(d) persons entitled to the benefit of a

Contributory Provident Fund;
(e) members of the All India Services;
(f) persons locally recruited for service in
diplomatic, Consular or other Indian
establishments in foreign countries;
(f) persons employed on contract except
when the contract provides otherwise;
and
(h) persons whose terms and conditions of
service are regulated by or under the
provisions of the Constitution or any
other law for the time being in force.
W.A. No. 33 of 2023 Page 28
17. Counting of service on contract. (1) A person who is initially engaged by the
Government on a contract for a specified period and is subsequently appointed to the
same or another post in a substantive capacity in a pensionable establishment
without interruption of duty, may opt either-
(a) to retain the Government contribution in the Contributory Provident Fund with
interest thereon including any other compensation for that service;
(b) to agree to refund to the Government the monetary benefits referred to in Clause
(a) or to forgo the same if they have not been paid to him and count in lieu thereof
the service for which the aforesaid monetary benefits may have been payable.
(2) The option under sub-rule (1) shall be communicated to the Head of Office under
intimation to the Accounts Officer within a period of three months from the date of
issue of the order of permanent transfer to pensionable service or if the Government
servant is on leave on the day, within three months of his return from leave,
whichever is later.
(3) If no communication is received by the Head of Office within the period referred
to in sub-rule (2), the Government servant shall be deemed to have opted for the
retention of the monetary benefit payable or paid to him on account of service
rendered on contract.
9. The Learned Advocate General is correct in his interpretation, inasmuch as a facial reading of
Rule 2(g) would indicate that contractual employees are excluded from the pale of Pension Rules.
However, what is significant is that the rule itself in its opening terms saves the application of other
provisions of the pension rules: "Save as otherwise provided in these rules". If the opening phrase of
Rule 2 were to be understood in this context, any interpretation of Rule 17 as is urged by the State
would render such substantive provision redundant. Rule 17 was engrafted essentially to cater to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72995545/ 22
The State Of Manipur vs Shri Oinam Manisana Singh on 6 August, 2024
eventuality, where the employees working on contract basis were regularized at a later stage. It is
only for the purposes of pension that the past service as a contractual employee is to be taken into
account.
W.A. No. 33 of 2023 Page 29
10. So far as the other arguments with respect to the voluntariness when the employees enters into
contractual services is concerned, this Court is unpersuaded by the submission because those terms
were applicable as long as the employees remained on contract. However, his or her status ceased
upon regularization."
[18] It is an admitted position of fact that the initial appointment of the above named
respondents/petitioners were against the clear sanctioned posts.
[19] The question involved in the present case is whether the respondents/petitioners are entitled to
the benefit embedded in the orders of the abovementioned absorption of the teachers/staffs of (i)
Heirok Part - I Aided High School and (ii) Sagang Aided High School w.e.f. the date of their initial
appointment in the facts and circumstances. In this regard, in the facts and circumstances, as
narrated above, it is undeniable fact that the same shall be applied to the present
respondents/petitioners. This being so, their service conditions will have to run parallel and no
discrimination can be made between them by a unilateral action.
In the circumstances, the denial of the benefit enjoyed by the similarly situated persons, as stated
above, amounts to discrimination, violative of the Article 16 of the Constitution of India.
We are, therefore, satisfied that the decision of the Ld. Single Judge is both proper and valid. There
is no room for interference by this Court as there is no substance in the present appeal.
W.A. No. 33 of 2023 Page 30
[20] We are of the considered view that the Ld. Single Judge,
while rendering the impugned order discussed the facts and circumstances of the cases of the parties
and rightly passed the impugned order as per the facts of the case and as per law and as such, the
grounds taken in the present appeal are not sustainable in the eyes of law.
[21] Accordingly, the present appeal is dismissed as devoid of merit.
[22] The appellants are directed to comply with the directions given by the Ld. Single Judge in the
impugned order and the whole exercise should be completed within a period of 3 (three) months
from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
