....Respondent
B E FO R E HON'BLE MRS. JUSTICE GOLMEI GAIPHULSHILLU 07.11.2024 This is an
application filed under Section 438 of CrPC, 1973 on behalf of Puyam Santosh Kumar Singh with the
following prayer:
"Grant transit anticipatory bail to the petitioner till 12.11.2024 in the event of his
arrest made by the police personnel of CBI, AC-I, Delhi in connection with FIR No.
RC- 216/2022/A0013/CBI/AC-1/Delhi, dated 21.12.2022 U/Ss 120 B, 420, 467, 468,
471 IPC 13(2), r/w 13(1)(d), 12, 7 PC Act, 1988."
Heard Mr. N. Jotendro, learned senior counsel assisted by Md. Abdul Baque Khan, learned counsel
appearing for the petitioner as well as Mr. W. Darakishwor, learned senior PCCG appearing for the
respondent.
Since the petitioner approached this Court asking for transit bail till 12.11.2024 on the ground that
CBI, Delhi (ACB) is asking the petitioner to appear before Delhi Office on 11.11.2024, the petitioner
is willing and ready to co-operate with the CBI, Delhi.
Page1|3 The learned senior counsel submits that he is going to Delhi to participate the investigation
as per the direction of CBI, Delhi. But, he is apprehending arrest from the CBI, Delhi any time
before 11.11.2024 and as such, requested to grant transit anticipatory bail till 12.11.2024.
The learned senior PCCG appearing for the respondent Mr. W. Darakishwor strongly objected on
the following grounds:
(i) FIR was registered on 21.12.2022. On 28.10.2024, the CBI, Delhi issued notice to
appear before the CBI Headquarter. On 04.10.2024 the petitioner requested the CBI

to postpone the date citing his father's death.
(ii) Subsequently, the present notice was issued to the petitioner to appear before the
Investigation Agency at Delhi on 11.11.2024. Prior to that, the petitioner filed transit
bail application before the Ld. Special Judge (PC Act), Imphal West and after hearing
the parties, the Ld. Special Judge (PC Act), Imphal West rejected the application.
By putting all these grounds, the learned senior PCCG for the respondent submits that the CBI,
Delhi did not act arbitrarily against the petitioner and also submits that the present transit bail is
not required.
Page2|3 However, for the ends of justice and since the petitioner is ready to co-operate with the CBI,
Delhi for investigation and further, the learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner
undertook to co-operate with the investigating agency and will appear before the agency on
11.11.2024 definitely before the CBI, Delhi, this Court is of the view that since the submission made
above is reasonable and since the petitioner is ready to co-operate with the investigating agency, the
prayer for transit anticipatory bail till 12.11.2024 is allowed with the direction that in the event of
arrest within this period i.e. up to 12.11.2024, the arresting authority should release the accused on
his furnishing PR Bond with surety bond of Rs. 5,00,000/- (Rupees five lakh).
As request made by both the parties, the present anticipatory bail is disposed of. It is, further, to put
in the record that this transit anticipatory bail is valid only up to 12.11.2024.
