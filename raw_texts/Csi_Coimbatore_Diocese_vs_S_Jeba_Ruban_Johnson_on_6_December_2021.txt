ORDER
This Petition has been filed to set aside the Order in I.A.No.135 of 2021 in Trust O.P.No.101 of 2018
dated 06.12.2021 on the file of the learned Principal Sessions Judge, Tirupur.
2. The learned counsel for the Petitioners submitted that the Bishop of Church of South India
Coimbatore Diocese is the Petitioner herein had filed a Petition in I.A.No.135/2021 in Trust
O.P.No.101/2018 before the learned Principal District and Sessions Judge, Tiruppur.
2.1. The Petition was filed by the Petitioner seeking dismissal of the Trust O.P.No.101 of 2018 in the
light of the pendency of the Suit in C.S.No.4331 of 2021 on the file of the original side of this Court.
On coming to know about that the Suit filed under Section 92 of CPC
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis pending before the Original Side of this Court against the Church
of South India Trust Association, the Petitioners had filed I.A.No.135 of 2021 in Trust O.P.No.101 of
2018 to dismiss the Trust O.P.No.101 of 2018 relying upon Section 9 (a) of the Charitable and
Religious Endowment Act. The learned Principal District and Sessions Judge, Tiruppur after
hearing the arguments of the Petitioners and the Respondent before the learned Principal District
and Sessions Judge dismissed the I.A.No.135 of 2021.
3. It is the contention of the learned Counsel for the Respondent that the Original Petition filed by
the Respondent is maintainable. It is filed under the Trust Act as the first Respondent registered the
Trust under the Companies Act. The Church of South India is a Company registered under Section
26 of the Indian Companies Act.
4. It is the further submission of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner that the first Respondent is
not registered under the Charitable and Religious Endowment Act and it is registered only under
Section 26 of the Companies Act. If there is no dispute, it is filed before the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Companies Court which is the original Side of this Court in all
other religious trust registered under Section 9 (a) of Charitable and Religious Endowment Act.
Sections 3 & 9 of Charitable and Religious Endowment Act are to be extracted hereunder:
Section 3 : Power to apply to the Court in respect of trusts of a charitable or religious
nature – Save as hereinafter provided in this Act, any person having interest in any
express or constructive trust created or existing for public purpose of a charitable or
religious nature may apply by petition to the court within the local limits of whose
jurisdiction any substantial part of the subject-matter of the trust is situate to obtain
an order embodying all or any of the following directions, namely:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/147341934/ 2
Csi Coimbatore Diocese vs S.Jeba Ruban Johnson on 6 December, 2021
(1) directing the trustee to furnish the petitioner through the Court with particulars
as to the nature and objects of the trust, and of the value, condition, management and
application of the subject-matter of the trust, and of the income belonging thereto, or
as to any of these matters, and (2) directing that the accounts of the trust shall be
examined and audited:
Provided that no person shall apply for any such direction in respect of accounts
relating to a period more than three years prior to the date of petition.
Section 9: Savings – No petition under the foregoing provisions of this Act in relation
to any trust shall be entertained in any of the following circumstances, namely:-
(a) if a suit instituted in accordance with the provisions of section 92 of the Code of
Civil Procedure 1908 (5 of 1908), is pending in respect of the trust in question;
(b) if the trust property is vested in the Treasurer of Charitable Endowments, the
Administrator General, the Official Trustee, or any Society registered under the
Societies https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Registration Act, 1860 (21 of 1860); or (c )
if a scheme for the administration of the trust property has been settled or approved
by any Court of competent jurisdiction, or by any other authority acting under the
provisions of any enactment.
4.1. The learned Counsel for the Petitioners had relied on the Order passed by the learned Single
Judge of this Court in A.No.210 of 2022 which is extracted hereunder:
“17. It is well settled proposition of law that while granting leave, the Court has to see
the averments in the application and the object of the Trust and also has to see
whether the Trust is a public charitable Trust; whether the applicants are interested
persons and whether the applicants made out the object of Section 92 of CPC and not
the defence taken by the defendants.
18. A reading of the plaint reveals that prima facie case is made out that the
applicants are entitled to get leave for filing the suit. Therefore the application is
allowed.
Registry is directed to take the suit on the file if it is otherwise in order.”
5. The learned counsel for the Respondent submitted that the Original Petition itself is maintainable
as it had been filed regarding the auditing of all the properties of the Trust. It is distinguished from
the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Suit pending before this Court as it had been filed under the
Trust Act. Therefore, the same is maintainable as independent of the Suit.
5.1. The learned Counsel for the Respondent relied on the reported ruling of this Court in (2014) 7
MLJ 549 in the case of N.P.Thangaraj and another Vs. Church of South India, represented by its
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/147341934/ 3
Csi Coimbatore Diocese vs S.Jeba Ruban Johnson on 6 December, 2021
Moderator, Most Rev. G.Devakadasham, CSI Synod Secretariat, CSI Centre, Chennai – 600 014 and
others as follows:
“From the dictum laid down in the above said judgment, I am of the opinion that
since the Respondents 3 & 4 were added as party to the Suit in their official capacity
and the fifth Respondent being the unregistered society, institution of Suit itself
should be only with the permission of the Court under Order I Rule 8 of CPC as
against them also. Hence, obtaining permission under Order I Rule 8 of CPC as
against the Defendants 3,4 & 5 is also necessary, to have a binding effect of the decree
that is going to be passed as against them. Therefore, I am of the opinion that a
separate application has to be filed by the applicants to obtain leave under Order I
Rule 8 of CPC to file the Suit as against the Defendants 3,4 & 5.”
6. The learned Counsel for the Petitioners relied on the observation of the learned Principal Judge in
the Order passed in I.A.No.135/2021 as follows:
“3........ Therefore, Sec.92 CPC permission was granted in A.No.3025/2013 dated
21.01.2014 and Original Side https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Appeal No.522014
before the Hon'ble Division Bench was dismissed. But, the Suit cannot be numbered
as application seeking permission under Or. I, Rule 8 CPC is pending before the
learned Master before the Hon'ble High Court. Moreover, the main prayer in the Suit
for removal of the 3rd Defendant G.Devakadasham from the post of Chairman of
Church of South India became infructuous as he retired and no longer holding the
post. O.P.No.101/2018 has nothing to do with the application No.3015/2013. The
arguments of the Petitioner would apply only if Suit is pending u/s. 92 in respect of
accounts. Hence, the application is frivolous, vexatious, filed with malafide intention
to prolong the litigation.” 6.1. The submission of the learned Counsel for the
Petitioner that since the Church of South India Trust is registered under the
Companies Act, the Company Court alone has jurisdiction, is found acceptable and
reasonable. The filing of the Trust invoking the Provisions of Charitable and
Religious Endowment Act is found unreasonable. The filing of Original Petition
before the learned Principal Judge, Tirupur is found not maintainable. Also in the
light of the Order passed by the learned Single Judge of this Court in A.No.210 of
2022 in CS(D).No.4331 of 2021 was when the suit is pending before this Court, the
filing of Original Petition before the learned Principal District and Sessions Judge,
Tiruppur is found to be not maintainable. The Order passed by the learned Principal
District and Sessions Judge in dismissing the IA.No.135/2021 is found
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis unacceptable in the light of the Order passed by the
learned single Judge of this Court in A.No.210 of 2022 in CS(D).No.4331 of 2021 in
the light of the ruling cited by the learned counsel for the Respondent, the Order
passed in A.No.210 of 2022 leave had been granted. Therefore, it is to be agitated
only before the original side of this Court and not a trust Original Petition. Further,
the arguments of the learned Counsel for the Petitioners, the Trust Act is not
applicable to the facts of the case as it is registered under the Companies Act is found
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/147341934/ 4
Csi Coimbatore Diocese vs S.Jeba Ruban Johnson on 6 December, 2021
acceptable.
6.2. In the light of the above discussion, this Civil Revision Petition is allowed. The
Order passed by the learned Principal District and Sessions Judge in I.A.No.135 of
2021 in Trust O.P.No.101 of 2018 is not maintainable. What are all agitated only in
the Suit is pending before this Court.
In the result, Civil Revision Petition is allowed. The Order passed by the learned Principal District
and Sessions Judge, Tirupur in I.A.No.135 of 2021 in Trust O.P.No.101 of 2018 is set aside.
Consequently, connected Miscellaneous Petitions are closed. No costs.
