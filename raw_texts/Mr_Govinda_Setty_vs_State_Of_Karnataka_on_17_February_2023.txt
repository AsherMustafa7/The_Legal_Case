3. CONTENTIONS OF PARTIES:-
3.1. BATCH - I RESTRICTING ENHANCEMENT OF AGE OF SUPERANNUATION
FROM 60 YEARS TO 62 YEARS ONLY TO TEACHING COMMUNITY OF
UNIVERSITIES DRAWING UGC PAY SCALES.
The validity of the Government Order No.ED 37 UNE 2009(P), Bangalore dated 15.10.2009, insofar
as enhancement of age of superannuation of Teaching Community of Universities drawing UGC
Scales from existing 60 Years to 62 Years, while continuing the age of superannuation for other
Teaching Community to be 60 Years is called in question in this batch of Writ Petitions.
A. CONTENTIONS OF PETITIONERS:-
(i) In this batch of Writ Petitions, the petitioners who belong to the Teaching Community other than
the Government Colleges and Universities have assailed the increase in age of superannuation only
to those staff of Universities/Government Colleges from 60 Years to 62 Years, while continuing the
age of superannuation to 60 Years in other Educational Institutions.
(ii) It is contended that the revised UGC Pay Scale was extended to the Teaching Staff of even
Government Aided Colleges but there was discrimination only as regards the age of superannuation
and hence the petitioners have sought for parity in the age of superannuation as well.
(iii) The petitioners have contended that the appointment of Teaching Faculty both in the
Universities and Government Colleges on one hand and Aided Colleges on the other hand was by the
Government and the Service Conditions, Recruitment, Pay Scales, Increment and Academic
Performance indicators for placement, are all governed by the UGC Guidelines which are uniform.
Accordingly, it is contended that the disparity in age of superannuation was arbitrary.
(iv) All the Educational Institutions registered under Section 12B of the UGC Act, 1956 ought to be
treated similarly. Once the Grant is received from Central Government, uniformity is required to be
maintained even as regards the staff of Government Aided Institutions which ought to be on par
with the faculties in Government Institutions.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/121607168/ 127
Mr Govinda Setty vs State Of Karnataka on 17 February, 2023
(v) In terms of UGC Regulations of 2010 and 2018, the entire Scheme of Revision of Pay Scale
together with all conditions laid down by UGC and other Guidelines are required to be implemented
for the State Government and Universities as a 'Composite Scheme' without any modification.
(vi) The Regulations passed by UGC cannot be treated only as recommendatory but must be
construed as being mandatory.
(vii) The State of Karnataka having adopted the UGC Scheme, the UGC Regulations must be
mandatorily implemented without any modification.
(viii) The provision of Rules under Article 309 of the Constitution of India are only temporary and
are brought about to hold the field till provisions are made by or under an Act of the appropriate
Legislature relating to the recruitment and conditions of service. Once the Regulations have been
framed under the Central Act, same would be operative qua the Colleges/Institutions which would
fall within the ambit of the said Regulations and the Rules framed under the Proviso to Article 309
of the Constitution of India would have to give way to the Regulations in case of any conflict.
(ix) The State Legislation being repugnant to the Central Legislation would be inoperative by virtue
of Article 254(2) of the Constitution of India, as the State law encroaches upon Entry-66 of the
Union List.
(x) The judgment in Kalyani Mathivanan v.
K.V.Jeyaraj and Others1 (Kalyani Mathivanan) by the Apex Court clearly distinguishes between the
States which (2015) 6 SCC 363 adopt UGC Regulations and others and stipulates that the States
which have adopted the UGC Regulations have to mandatorily follow them.
(xi) The petitioners claim that as regards Teachers employed in the Universities and Government
Colleges, the age of superannuation is enhanced to 62 Years, while insofar as Affiliated Colleges,
whether Aided or Unaided, the age of retirement being only 60 Years and accordingly is
discriminatory and ought to be enhanced to 62 Years.
B. CONTENTIONS OF RESPONDENT - STATE
(i) The State Government has accepted only that part of UGC recommendation with regard to the
revision of UGC Pay Scales to the Teaching Community working in Government and Private Aided
Colleges but the UGC recommendations insofar as superannuation is not accepted by the State
Government.
(ii) Though UGC Pay Scales are applicable to the entirety of Teaching Community, other Service
Conditions like superannuation/retirement age, probationary period, pensionary benefits and the
like are governed by the State Government Rules.

Mr Govinda Setty vs State Of Karnataka on 17 February, 2023
(iii) The Ministry of Human Resources Department (MHRD) has framed a Scheme for revision of
Pay of Teachers and in view of the shortage of Teachers in Universities, the age of superannuation
was enhanced to 65 Years. However, the State Government has made a provision for appointment of
Guest Lecturers to bear the extra work load and accordingly, enhancing the age of superannuation is
not required insofar as the Teaching Community of State Government/Universities are concerned.
(iv) In terms of Regulation 2.1.0 of UGC Regulations, 2010, Regulation 2.3.1 stipulates that revised
Pay Scales and age of superannuation 'may' also be extended to the Universities, Colleges and other
Higher Educational Institutions. There is no categorical direction issued to enhance the age of
retirement to 65 Years and accordingly, the State Government has not adopted the same as the same
is essentially a policy decision of the State Government.
(v) The Division Bench of this Court in State of Karnataka and Others v. Dr.R.Halesha and Others2
(Dr.R.Halesha) has held that though the revision of Pay Scales prescribed by the UGC is mandatory,
the enhancement of the age of superannuation was intended to be optional and only
recommendatory and it is beyond the powers of the Court to issue a writ for its observance. This
judgment of the Division Bench was upheld by the Apex Court while referring to the case of Jagdish
Prasad Sharma and Others v. State of Bihar and Others3 (Jagdish Prasad Sharma). The Apex Court
has held that the recommendations by the UGC need not be extended directly and it is left to the
States to take a conscious decision on account of the financial implications and consequences
attached to such decisions.

(2013) 8 SCC 633
(vi) The Teachers in Universities and Colleges under the State Government are governed by a
different set of Acts and Rules. The University Teachers are governed by the Karnataka State
Universities Act, 2000 ('KSU Act, 2000') and the statutory Rules framed by the respective
Universities, while the Government Colleges are governed by the respective Cadre and Recruitment
Rules. The Teachers of Aided Institutions are governed by the Karnataka Education Act, 1983 ('KEA
Act, 1983') read with the Karnataka Educational Institutions (Collegiate Education) Rules 2003
[KEI (Collegiate Rules) 2003].
(vii) The method of recruitment and the nature of employment are different for the above categories
and accordingly, there is no parity with respect to the Staff working in State Government Colleges
and Universities on the one hand and the Staff working in Government Aided Institutions on the
other hand, which aspect has been rightly noticed in Dr.R.Halesha (supra).
(viii) The recommendation of UGC made in Clause-8(f) of Appendix-I to UGC Regulations 2010
regarding the age of superannuation, is a matter to be decided by the State Government in light of
financial burden which is a policy decision.

(ix) It is submitted that the age of superannuation is enhanced to 62 Years only in respect to
Teaching Community of Universities drawing UGC Pay Scales and the age of superannuation of
Teaching Community in Private Aided Colleges and Government Colleges would continue to be 60
Years.

(ii) The petitioners contend that the age of superannuation and re-employment of
staff working in Aided Colleges shall be as notified by the State Government in terms
of the Government Order dated 16.03.2019 which must be in accordance with UGC

superannuation is to be governed in terms with Clause-2.0 of UGC Regulation dated 18.07.2018.
(iv) After 18.07.2018, as no Rule is framed by the State Government under Article 309 of the
Constitution of India or under KEA Act, 1983 or in the amendment to KEI (Collegiate Education)
Rules 2003, all Educational Institutions are governed by UGC Regulation dated 18.07.2018 and
Clause-1.1 in the absence of statutory Rule governing the age of superannuation.
(v) The State Government while implementing UGC Regulations ought not to confine
implementation only to Government Colleges/Universities, but must extend the same to Aided

(viii) It is submitted that under Section 40(t) of the KSU Act 2000, the age of superannuation is
governed by the University statutes and accordingly, the Universities ought to make statutes in
consonance with UGC Regulations and the same legal logic is to be extended to the constituent
Colleges.
(ix) Reliance is placed on the judgment of Apex Court in Jacob Thudipara v. State of Madhya
Pradesh and Others4 (Jacob Thudipara) to contend that the teachers of Aided Colleges must be
considered on par with the teachers in Government Colleges.
(x) The petitioners have also relied on the judgment in Gambhirdan K. Gadhvi v. State of Gujarat
and (2022) 7 SCC 764 Others5 (Gambhirdan) to contend that the Regulations of UGC would prevail
over the State Legislature.
(xi) The petitioners contend that in terms of the Regulations of Central Government dated
02.11.2017, the implementation of age of superannuation is mandatory in terms of Clause-16(h),
which provides that the Regulations and Guidelines shall be implemented by State Government and
Universities as a 'Composite Scheme.'
(xii) In terms of the recommendation of 7th Pay Commission, the age of superannuation shall be 65
Years.
(xiii) In terms of the judgment of Apex Court in Kalyani Mathivanan (supra), the State Legislations
made under Entry-25 of List-3 must give way to the Central Legislation, i.e., UGC Act framed under
Entry-66 of List-1 by way of Central Act being repugnant to the State Act.

PROFESSOR/ASSISTANT PROFESSOR IN UNIVERSITIES AND SEEK ENHANCEMENT OF THE
AGE OF SUPERANNUATION FROM 62 YEARS TO 65 YEARS A. CONTENTIONS OF
PETITIONERS:-
(i) The petitioners state that, in terms of Section 40(t) of KSU Act, 20006, as the
superannuation benefit as per UGC Guidelines has been extended for Teachers who
opted for Maharani Cluster University or Mandya Unitary University, they are also
entitled for the same benefit.

(ii) It is submitted that they are entitled for enhanced age of superannuation in terms
of UGC Regulations of 18.07.2018 and the extension of benefit of 7th Pay
Commission recommendation in terms of MHRD's letter dated 02.11.2017.
(iii) The petitioners have assailed Clause-9 of Government Order dated 16.03.2019
whereby the State Act 15 of 2019 Government has been conferred power to notify the
age of superannuation as regards teachers in Government/Aided Colleges and
Universities in the State.
(iv) The letters of MHRD dated 04.04.2007, 23.03.2007 and 31.12.2008 passed by
the Central Government has extended the age of superannuation to 65 Years and the
petitioners working in Universities seek for parity.
(v) It is the contention of petitioners that as regards all Universities registered under Section 12B of
the UGC Act, the State Government cannot bind the University insofar as the conditions of service
and the Universities must be left with liberty to determine the conditions of service by way of
making statutes in terms of UGC Regulations.
(vi) Reliance has been placed on the judgments of Apex Court in Jacob Thudipara(supra) and
NDMC v.
Dr.Ram Naresh Sharma7 (Dr.Ram Naresh Sharma) to contend that the classification between
University Teachers vis-à-vis, lecturers in Cluster University is unintelligible.
(vii) In certain Universities like Bangalore University in light of reduced cadre strength, there is
acute shortage of Teachers which has been taken note of in the 7th Pay Commission
recommendation, wherein there is a recommendation to extend the age of superannuation from 62
Years to 65 Years and to consider re-employment till 70 Years and same benefit is to be extended to
the University Teachers.
(viii) In the alternative, the petitioners claim that in terms of Clause-21.2 of statutes of Bangalore
University and similar provision in the statute of Mysore University and Mangalore University, if a
Teacher retires in the middle of Academic Year, such Teacher is entitled to continue till the end of
the Academic Year.
(ix) Other contentions which are raised is common in the batch of Teachers seeking enhancement of
age of superannuation from 60 Years to 62 Years and 60 Years to 65 Years, including that State
Government has no discretion to reduce the age of superannuation and must implement the UGC
Scheme in its entirety as a 'Composite Scheme'; that in the absence of State Government framing
any Regulation in accordance with mandate of Clause-1.2 of UGC Regulation dated 18.07.2018, the
UGC Regulations should apply; that the recommendations of 7th Pay Commission having been
accepted by the University/MHRD in terms of its letter dated 02.11.2017, the same is binding on all
the State Government Colleges, Universities and Deemed Universities.

The said letter contains the Scheme of Revision of Pay of Teachers and equivalent cadres in
Universities and Colleges following the revision of Pay Scale of Central Government Employees on
the basis of recommendations of Sixth Central Pay Commission. There is a direction regarding
enhancement of age of superannuation except as regards Librarians and Directors of Physical
Education from 62 Years To 65 Years.
4.3. UGC Notification dated 30.06.2010.-
"UGC Regulations on Minimum Qualifications for Appointment of Teachers and
Other Academic Staff in Universities and Colleges and Measures for the Maintenance
of Standards in Higher Education, 2010."

of superannuation in Central Universities and other Institutions maintained and/or funding by the
UGC shall be strictly in accordance with the decision of Central Government, MHRD.

Clause -
2.1.0 may be extended to the Universities, Colleges and other Higher Educational Institutions

provided the State Governments adopt and implement the scheme as a composite
scheme, including the enhanced age of superannuation and the regulations laid down
by the UGC in this regard. The age of superannuation for teachers in Central
Universities had been enhanced to 65 years vide this Ministry's letter No.
1-19/2006-U.II dated 23.03.2007, for those involved in classroom teaching.

payment of Central share of 80% arrears to the States.
5. Bearing in mind that the question of enhancement of age of retirement is
exclusively within the domain of the policy making power of the State Governments,
the issue of age of retirement has been left to the State Governments to decide at their
level. The condition of enhancement of age of superannuation to 65 years as
mentioned in this Ministry's letter dated 31.12.2008 may be treated as withdrawn, for
the purpose of seeking reimbursement of central share of arrears to be paid to State
University and College teachers. However, the others conditions as mentioned in the

Mr Govinda Setty vs State Of Karnataka on 17 February, 2023
With regard to enhancement of superannuation from 62 Years to 65 Years, it was discussed and
decided that the Government would take a suitable decision.
5. ANALYSIS:-
5.1 BATCH - I "Whether the Government Order dated 15.10.2009 enhancing the age
of superannuation to the Teaching Community of Universities drawing UGC Scales
from 60 Years to 62 Years, while continuing the age of superannuation to other
Teaching Community to be at 60 Years is valid in law?"
(i) The contention of petitioners that even those working in Affiliated Colleges are to
be treated on par with the Teaching Community drawing UGC Scales cannot be
accepted, as the Teaching Community of the Universities drawing UGC Pay Scales
form a distinct class of employees vis-à-vis other Teaching Community staff.
(ii)(a) The Teachers in Universities insofar as their recruitment is concerned are
governed by the provisions of KSU Act 2000 and are also subject to the directions of
the State Government. The recruitment is normally done by the Board of
Appointment and Selection as approved by the Syndicate.
(ii)(b) Insofar as the Teachers of Aided Institutions, their recruitment would be
governed by the KEA Act, 1983 read with KEI (Collegiate Education) Rules, 2003.
The recruitment is normally on the basis of recommendation of Selection Committee
comprising of Members nominated by the Management of the College, Department
of Collegiate Education and University.
(ii)(c) As regards the Teachers in Government Colleges, they are governed by the
provisions of the Karnataka Civil Services Act, 1978 as well as the Rules framed in
that regard and selection was earlier done by Karnataka Public Service Commission
and presently is on the basis of competitive examinations conducted by Karnataka
Examination Authority.
(ii)(d) Accordingly, the method of recruitment in each of the above categories is
different and distinct as also the conditions of service and the Teachers are governed
by applicable legislations and there is no identical and uniform process of
recruitment or conditions of service. This by itself would justify treating each of the
categories as distinct and forming a separate Class which is categorized on the basis
of differentia which is to be treated as intelligible in light of the distinctiveness
pointed out above. In light of the same, having different age of superannuation for
these distinct categories by itself cannot be assailed as being discriminatory.
Therefore, the method of recruitment and the administrative control of staff as regards the above
categories being different, equating the said categories and seeking for uniform application of the
UGC Regulations cannot be sought for.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/121607168/ 137
Mr Govinda Setty vs State Of Karnataka on 17 February, 2023
(iii) The reliance on the judgment of Apex Court in Dr.Ram Naresh Sharma (supra) would not aid
the petitioner, as the Apex Court has recorded a specific finding that Doctors in AYUSH and those
under the Central Health Scheme cannot be treated as separate categories, as both render service to
patients and there was nothing to distinguish them. Accordingly, the Apex Court has held that the
extended age of superannuation had to be extended to both the categories. However, in the present
case, in light of the differences regarding service conditions, method of recruitment and applicability
of different laws governing employees as pointed out in para-5.1(ii), clearly case is made out
permitting the treatment of the Teaching Staff as separate and distinct categories and accordingly,
extending the extended age of superannuation in one of the categories to all other categories cannot
be insisted.
(iv)(a) This Court, in Dr.R.Halesha and Others v.
State of Karnataka and Others11 had issued a writ directing that the age of retirement of all
Professors/Teachers in all Colleges in the State regardless of whether they are serving in Central
Universities or Educational Institutions funded by Central Government/UGC ILR 2011 KAR 4976
(W.P.Nos.13449-453/2011 dated 22.06.2011) should be increased to 65 Years. The same was taken
up in Writ Appeal12 in Dr.R.Halesha (supra).
(iv)(b) The Division Bench13 took note of the law laid down by the Apex Court in B.Bharat Kumar
and Others v. Osmania University and Others14 (B.Bharat Kumar), wherein the Apex Court at
para-14 has observed as follows:-
"14. ...Plain reading of all these is clear enough to suggest that the Scheme was
voluntary and it was upto the State Government to accept or not to accept the
Scheme. Again, even if the State Government accepted a part of the Scheme, it was
not necessary that all the Scheme as it was, had to be accepted by the State
Government. In fact, the subsequent developments suggest that the State
Government has not chosen to accept the Scheme in full inasmuch as it has not
accepted the suggestions on the part of the UGC to increase the age of
superannuation."
W.A. No.5670/2011 & W.A.Nos.15676-15798/2011) Dr.R.Halesha (supra) (2007) 11 SCC 58
(iv)(c) The Division Bench15 has further observed at para-16 as follows:-
"16. ... once the Scheme suggested that it was left to the "wish" of the State
Government, there will be no point in trying to assign the unnatural meaning to the
word "wish". Similarly, there would be no point in going into the interpretation of the
word "gamut" and to hold that once the State Government accepted a part of the
Scheme, the whole Scheme had to be accepted by the same as such would, in our
opinion, be an unnecessary exercise."

Mr Govinda Setty vs State Of Karnataka on 17 February, 2023
(iv)(d) The Division Bench has also noted that the Apex Court in B.Bharat Kumar (supra) had
applied the law laid down in T.P.George v. State of Kerala16 (T.P.George). The observations of
Division Bench at para-
7 are as follows:-
"7. ...
The contention of the appellant is that the State Government having accepted the
UGC Scheme, and as the scheme provides for a Dr.R.Halesha (supra) (1992) Supp.(3)
SCC 191.
higher age of 60 years, once the State Government accepted the scheme, all the clauses of the
scheme became applicable. It is not possible to accede to this contention. Firstly, as already stated
the UGC Scheme does not become applicable because of any statutory mandate making it obligatory
for the Government and the Universities to follow the same. Therefore the State Government had
the discretion either to accept or not to accept the scheme. In its discretion it has decided to accept
the scheme, subject to the one condition, namely, insofar as the age of superannuation is concerned,
they will not accept the fixation of higher age provided in the scheme. The State Government having
thus accepted the scheme in the modified form, the teachers can only get the benefit which flows
from the scheme to the extent to which it has been accepted by the State Government and the
concerned Universities. The appellant cannot claim that major portion of the scheme having been
accepted by the Government, they have no right not to accept the clause relating to fixation of higher
age of superannuation. That is a matter between the State Government on the one hand and the
University Grants Commission on the other, which was provided certain benefits by the scheme. It is
for the University Grants Commission to extend the benefit of the scheme or not to extend the
benefit of the scheme, depending upon its satisfaction about the attitude taken by the State
Government in the matter of implementing the same. That is a matter entirely between the State
Government on the one hand and the University Grants Commission on the other. Teachers of the
private institution concerned are governed by the statutes framed under the relevant statutory
enactment. As long as the superannuation remains fixed at 55 years and as long as the State
Government has not accepted the UGC's recommendation to fix the age of superannuation at 60
years, teachers cannot claim as a matter of right that they are entitled to retire on attaining the age
of 60 years."
(emphasis supplied)
(iv)(e) The Division Bench also took note of the contention regarding observation made in
para-8(f)17, which provides that the age of superannuation for Teachers letter of MHRD dated
31.12.2008 in Central Education Institutions having been enhanced to 65 Years, the Central
Government had authorized the Central Universities vide letter dated 30.03.2007 to enhance the
age of superannuation from 65 Years to 70 Years as regards Vice Chancellors.

Mr Govinda Setty vs State Of Karnataka on 17 February, 2023
(iv)(f) The Division Bench took note of Clause-(p)18 relating to applicability of the Scheme which
provided that the Scheme would be applicable to Teachers and other equivalent cadres of Library
and Physical Education in all the Central Universities and the Colleges thereunder and the
Institutions Deemed to be Universities whose maintenance expenditure was met by UGC.
(iv)(g) The Division Bench noted Clause-(v) of Clause(p)19 which reads as hereunder:-
"This Scheme may be extended to
Universities, Colleges and other Higher
Educational Institutions coming under the
purview of State Legislature, provided State Governments wish to adopt and implement the letter of
MHRD dated 31.12.2008 letter of MHRD dated 31.12.2008 Scheme subject to the following terms
and conditions....."
(iv)(h) The Division Bench noted that the Government of Karnataka, in its letter dated 31.12.2008 in
terms of the Order No.ED 37 UNE 2009 (P), Bangalore dated 15.10.2009 had resolved as follows:-
"10. Responding to the said letter dated 31.12.2008, the Government of Karnataka, in
terms of its Order No. ED 37 UNE 2009 (P), Bangalore, dated: 15th October, 2009
passed the following Resolution:
"PREAMBLE:
1) Government of India, vide its letter read above, has revised the pay scales of the
teaching community of the Central Universities based on the recommendations of VI
Central Pay Commission with effect from 01.01.2006.
It is also decided to enhance the age of superannuation of teachers. Government of Karnataka has
also examined this issue and has decided to enhance the age of superannuation from the existing 60
(sixty) to 62 (sixty two) years to the University teachers drawing UGC scales. Hence, this
Government Order.
GOVERNMENT ORDER No. ED 37 JUNE, 2009, (P), BANGALORE, DATED 15TH OCTOBER,
2009 In the circumstances explained in the preamble, Government of Karnataka are pleased to
enhance the age of superannuation of teaching community of Universities drawing UGC scales from
the existing sixty years to sixty two years with immediate effect. In respect of other teaching
community the age of superannuation shall continue to be 60 years only."
(v) Thus, it becomes clear as rightly observed by the Division Bench20 that the decision of State
Government was only to enhance the age of superannuation with respect to the community of
Teachers in Universities who were entitled to UGC Scales, from existing 60 Years to 62 Years and
the order dated 15.10.2009 clarifies that in respect of other Teaching Community, the age of
superannuation shall continue to be 60 Years.

Dr.R.Halesha (supra)
(vi)(a) As regards the contention that UGC Scheme has to be adopted as a "Composite Scheme", the
Division Bench21 observed as follows:-
"11. ... We are unable to be persuaded that this mandates an increase in age of
superannuation applicable not only to Central Universities and Institutions funded
by the Central Government/UGC, but also to all other Colleges under the respective
State Governments. As we see it, the commitment of the Central Government is only
for reimbursement of 80% of the additional financial expenses of the State
Governments which come into play upon the State Governments making necessary
budgetary allocation for the remaining 20%. The Scheme dated 31.12.2008 as noted
in paragraph 8(p) thereof specifies that it is compulsorily "applicable to teachers and
other equivalent cadres of Library and Physical Education in all the Central
Universities and Colleges thereunder and the Institutions Deemed to be Universities
whose maintenance expenditure is met by the UGC." There is no dispute that these
directions have been complied with by the State of Karnataka. The letter of the UGC
dated 30.09.2010 addressed to the Registrar, Indian Law Institute, New Delhi has to
be read in context and if so done, Dr.R.Halesha (supra) it would be manifestly clear
that the statement that the UGC Regulations are mandatory in nature are in light of
the fact that the Indian Law Institute, New Delhi is a Deemed University. Had it been
a College under a University, the position would be appreciably different."
(vi)(b) The Division Bench has also observed at para-
13 as hereunder:-
"13. ...Furthermore, Clause-8(f) of the said Scheme dated 31.12.2008 also deals with
"age of superannuation"; however, it is restricted once again to Central Educational
Institutions. Thus, we are unable to locate the basis on which the opinion favoured by
the Learned Single Judge can be predicated namely, that increase of age of
superannuation has been made mandatory by the UGC for teachers of all the
Universities and Colleges."
(vii) The Division Bench22 has concluded at para-18 as follows:-
"18. ... We affirm the arguments of the Learned Additional Advocate General that
whilst adherence to the revised pay-scales prescribed by the University Grant
Commission is mandatory on all State Dr.R.Halesha (supra) Governments, increase
of age of superannuation was intendedly optional and only recommendatory.
Therefore, whatever be the wisdom behind the reluctance of the Government of
Karnataka for adherence to the suggested age of superannuation, it is beyond our
province to issue a writ for its observance."

Mr Govinda Setty vs State Of Karnataka on 17 February, 2023
The order of the Division Bench23 came to be challenged before the Apex Court in SLP (Civil)
No.21921/2013 and came to be dismissed.
(viii) It is necessary to note that the Division Bench24 had referred to the judgment in State of Bihar
v.
Prof.Dr.Jagdish Prasad Sharma25, wherein it was held that Regulation relating to the age of
superannuation of staff of Centrally funded Educational Institutions could not be extended to
University Teachers as well. The said order of the Division Bench eventually came to be upheld by
the Apex Court in Jagdish Prasad Sharma26. The observations made by the Apex Court are as
follows:-
Dr.R.Halesha (supra) Dr.R.Halesha (supra) (2010) 3 PLJR 318, (2013) 8 SCC 633
"77. We are inclined to agree with such submission mainly because of the fact that in
the amended provisions of Section 67(a) it has been categorically stated that the age
of superannuation of non-
teaching employees would be 62 years and, in no case, should the period of service of such non-
teaching employees be extended beyond 62 years. A difference had been made in regard to the
teaching faculty whose services could be extended up to 65 years in the manner laid down in the
University Statutes. There is no ambiguity that the final decision to enhance the age of
superannuation of teachers within a particular State would be that of the State itself. The right of the
Commission to frame regulations having the force of law is admitted. However, the State
Governments are also entitled to legislate with matters relating to education under List III Entry 25.
So long as the State legislation did not encroach upon the jurisdiction of Parliament, the State
legislation would obviously have primacy over any other law. If there was any legislation enacted by
the Central Government under List III Entry 25, both would have to be treated on a par with each
other [Ed.: But see Articles 254(1) and 246 of the Constitution.] . In the absence of any such
legislation by the Central Government under List III Entry 25, the regulations framed by way of
delegated legislation have to yield to the plenary jurisdiction of the State Government under List III
Entry 25.
78. We are then faced with the situation where a composite scheme has been framed by UGC,
whereby the Commission agreed to bear 80% of the expenses incurred by the State if such scheme
was to be accepted, subject to the condition that the remaining 20% of the expense would be met by
the State and that on and from 1-4-2010, the State Government would take over the entire burden
and would also have enhanced the age of superannuation of teachers and other staff from 62 to 65
years. There being no compulsion to accept and/or adopt the said Scheme, the States are free to
decide as to whether the Scheme would be adopted by them or not. In our view, there can be no
automatic application of the recommendations made by the Commission, without any conscious
decision being taken by the State in this regard, on account of the financial implications and other
consequences attached to such a decision. The case of those petitioners who have claimed that they
should be given the benefit of the Scheme dehors the responsibility attached thereto, must,
therefore, fail."

Mr Govinda Setty vs State Of Karnataka on 17 February, 2023
(ix)(a) Insofar as the reliance of the petitioner on the decision of Apex Court in R.S.Sohane v. State
of Madhya Pradesh and Others27 (R.S.Sohane), the judgment cannot be held to be laying down a
proposition that those Teaching Staff in Private Aided Educational Institutions are entitled to be
treated on par with teaching staff of Government Colleges insofar as the age of superannuation is
concerned.
(ix)(b) In fact, it is to be noted that in R.S.Sohane (supra), the Apex Court considered Clause-26 of
Statute 28 (College Code) and the same reads as hereunder:-
"It was appropriate to maintain the age of superannuation of Principals, Teachers
and Employees of Private Colleges on a par with the age of superannuation of
Principals, Teachers and Employees of government colleges".
(ix)(c) In light of such stipulation, it was held that the State Government could not contend that they
will not extend the benefit of enhancement of age of (2019) 16 SCC 796 superannuation upto 65
Years even as regards the Teachers working in Private Aided Colleges.
(ix)(d) Accordingly, the enhanced age of superannuation of 65 Years was extended to the Teaching
Staff of Private Aided Institutes as well, which was only in light of Clause-26 of Statute 28 (College
Code). Hence, no general principle regarding the treatment on parity as regards Teachers in
Government Institutions vis-à-vis those working in Private Aided Institutions can be stated to have
been laid down in R.S.Sohane (supra).
(x) In Jacob Thudipara (supra), the judgment was passed by Apex Court relying on the decision in
R.S.Sohane (supra) and it is relevant to note that the case also arose from the State of Madhya
Pradesh and relates to identical factual matrix where staff in Private Aided Educational Institution
were claiming enhanced age of superannuation as was with respect to the Teaching Staff in
Government Colleges.
Accordingly, as distinguished above, the Apex Court has not laid down any general principle which
can be relied on by the petitioners.
(xi) Accordingly, the position is clear and it is for the State to take an appropriate decision as regards
acceptance of the age of superannuation as provided for under the UGC Scheme.
(xii) It is also necessary to note that the age of retirement of Teaching Staff in Government
Institutions is admittedly 60 Years. Rule 2528 of K.E.I. (Collegiate Education) Rules, 2003 provides
that the age of retirement for employees in Private Educational Institutions receiving aid from the
State Government shall be the same as those applicable for corresponding category of employees in
Government Educational Institutions.
25. Qualification and conditions of service of employees :- The minimum qualification for
recruitment, age of recruitment and retirement for employees in Private Educational Institutions
receiving aid from the State Government shall be the same as those applicable for the corresponding
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/121607168/ 143
Mr Govinda Setty vs State Of Karnataka on 17 February, 2023
category of employees in the Government Educational Institutions If that were to be so, the
Teaching Staff in Aided Private Educational Institutions will not be entitled to claim that the age of
superannuation should be above 60 Years in light of K.E.I. (Collegiate Education) Rules, 2003.
5.2 BATCH - II AND III "The common question that arises for consideration is whether the
petitioners are entitled for enhancement in age of superannuation to 65 years?"
(i) The judgment of Apex Court in (Dr.J.Vijayan) (supra), the Government of Kerala
by a Government Order dated 10.12.2010 had adopted and implemented the UGC
Regulations 2010 and it was the grievance of the petitioners that despite such
acceptance, the Government had failed to comply with the condition of enhancement
of the retirement age. The petition came to be rejected and the appeal filed was also
dismissed. The petitioners had challenged the said orders before the Apex Court. The
Apex Court while referring to the judgment in Jagdish Prasad Sharma (supra)
concluded that there was no change in law after the judgment in Jagdish Prasad
Sharma (supra). The Apex Court has made the following observations:-
The statutory age of retirement was determined by State of Kerala under Article 309
of Constitution of India29.
The prescription of age of superannuation has nothing to do with standards in
Education 30.
The letter of MHRD dated 14.08.2012, withdrawing the Regulations regarding
enhancement of age of superannuation would result in the same falling within the
ambit of policy decision and was within the exclusive domain of the State
Government.
The Apex Court refers to the observations of Division Bench made while referring to
Jagdish Prasad Sharma (supra) which has been Paras−26 and 27 of Dr.J.Vijayan
(supra) Paras−26 and 27 of Dr.J.Vijayan (supra) approved as supporting the stand of
State of Kerala and the relevant paragraphs are extracted below:-
"29. The Division Bench of the High Court also found that the State Governments had
the discretion to accept the scheme proposed under the UGC Regulations relying on
the judgment in Jagdish Prasad Sharma (supra) and in particular Paragraph 72,
thereof. The Division Bench held:--
"14. It is in the light of the above authoritative pronouncement of the Apex Court,
that the present contentions of the counsel for the appellants are required to be
considered. The contention that the UGC Regulations were made in exercise of the
power under Entry 66 List I Schedule VII of the Constitution, while the State
enactments are made under Entry 25 List III Schedule VII and for the said reason, in
the event of repugnancy, the Central enactment would prevail, has to fail for more
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/121607168/ 144
Mr Govinda Setty vs State Of Karnataka on 17 February, 2023
reasons than one. In the first place, the State Laws prescribing the age of retirement
of teachers are made in exercise of the power under Article 309 of the Constitution.
The Apex Court has found Jagdish Prasad Sharma (supra) that such enactments
would remain unaffected by the stipulations contained in the UGC Regulations.
Secondly, it has been further held by the Court in the said decision that the UGC does
not have any power to stipulate the service conditions of teachers. Therefore, such
power is vested entirely in the State. Thirdly, obviously in recognition of the above
position of law the UGC Regulations have conferred a discretion on the State
Governments to decide whether to implement the Regulations or not. In view of the
conferment of the discretion as noted above, no question of repugnancy arises in
these cases. Therefore, we do not think it necessary to consider the above contention
in any further detail.
15. On the next contention that the Scheme under the UGC Regulations, 2010 has to
be accepted in full as a composite one and that adoption of the Scheme without
enhancing the retirement age of teachers was bad, we find that the said issue has
been concluded by the Supreme Court. Though a similar contention was put forward
in Jagdish Prasad Sharma (supra) with respect to the Government Order dated
10.12.2010, the same did not find favour with the Court. The said Government Order
evidenced herein as Ext. P10 in W.A. No. 854 of 2016 provides at paragraph 6 as
follows"-
6. Government are also pleased to order that where there are any provision in the Regulations
inconsistent with the provisions in the G.O. read as 1st paper above, those provisions in the G.P.
would override the provisions in the Regulations to the extent of such inconsistency.
Reference No. 1 in the said Government Order is to G.O.(P) NO. 58/2010/H. Edn. Dated 27.3.2010
(Ext.P8 in W.A. No. 854 of 2016). It is the said Government Order that is directed to prevail as per
Clause 6 extracted above. It has been ordered by the said Government Order that the age of
superannuation shall continue as at present. In the above context, it is necessary to notice that as
per letter No. F.1-7/2010-U.II dated 14.08.2012 of the MHRD (a copy of which has been handed
over to us by the Counsel in the Court), it has been clarified that the issue regarding age of
retirement has been left to the decision of the State Governments.
Paragraph 5 that deals with the above aspect is extracted hereunder for convenience of reference:
5. Bearing in mind that the question of enhancement of age of retirement is
exclusively within the domain of the policy making power of the State Governments,
the issue of age of retirement has been left to the State Governments to decide at their
level. The condition of enhancement of age of superannuation to 65 years as
mentioned in this Ministry's letter dated 31.12.2008 may be treated as withdrawn, for
the purpose of seeking reimbursement of central share of arrears to be paid to State
University and College teachers. However, the other conditions as mentioned in the
letter cited above shall continue to apply.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/121607168/ 145
Mr Govinda Setty vs State Of Karnataka on 17 February, 2023
Though a contention has been put forward by the counsel for the Appellants that, the
condition has been withdrawn for the purpose of seeking reimbursement of the
central share of arrears alone, we are not prepared to accept the same in view of the
opening sentence in the said clause which declares in unambiguous terms that
enhancement of age of retirement is exclusively within the domain of the powers of
the State Government and that for the said reason, the issue of age of retirement has
been left to the State Governments to decide at their level.
***
17. In the view that we have taken above, we do not consider it necessary to refer to or discuss the
other decisions on which reliance has been placed. The question of fixing the retirement age of
teachers is essentially a matter of policy. The said policy would have to be adopted by the State
Government taking into account a number of factors. As contended before us by the learned
Additional Advocate General, the State of Kerala does not suffer from a dearth of qualified
candidates to be appointed as teachers. There are a large number of qualified teachers, including
Ph.D. Holders who are waiting for employment. They are persons trained in advanced methods of
instruction and teaching techniques. At the same time, teachers like the appellants who are
approaching retirement age are not persons who could be described as aged or infirm. They are in
their prime of life, endowed with the rich experience both in teaching as well as in guiding research
projects. The wisdom of the decision to superannuate them at such a prime point of time in their
lives is also questionable. A decision can be taken only by balancing both the above aspects as well
as other relevant factors that may require to be taken into account. Such an informed decision would
have to be taken by the law makers and not by courts. As at present, the UGC Regulations, 2010
cannot affect the State laws governing the age of superannuation. UGC Regulations have in
recognition of the above position granted a discretion to the State to take a decision with respect to
the manner of implementation of the Regulations. Accordingly, the State Government has decided
not to enhance the age of retirement. We notice that, a similar claim for enhancement in retirement
age has been considered by another Division Bench of this Court and rejected in Mathai M.M. v.
Elizabeth Xavier (2011) 2 KLT 468. The said decision is also binding on us."
The Apex Court finally at para-30 has taken note of the observations made at para-68 of the decision
in Jagdish Prasad Sharma (supra) and the same are extracted hereinbelow for reference: -
"68. Another anxiety which is special to certain States, such as the States of Uttar
Pradesh and Kerala, has also come to light during the hearing. In both the States, the
problem is one of surplusage and providing an opportunity for others to enter into
service. On behalf of the State of Kerala, it had been urged that there were a large
number of educated unemployed youth, who are waiting to be appointed, but by
retaining teachers beyond the age of 62 years, they were being denied such
opportunity. As far as the State of U.P. is concerned, it is one of job expectancy,
similar to that prevailing in Kerala. The State Governments of the said two States
were, therefore, opposed to the adoption of the UGC Scheme, although, the same has
not been made compulsorily applicable to the universities, colleges and other
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/121607168/ 146
Mr Govinda Setty vs State Of Karnataka on 17 February, 2023
institutions under the control of the State authorities.
It is concluded at para-31 that while affirming the observations made in para-72 of
Jagdish Prasad Sharma (supra) that "State was not bound to accept or follow the
UGC regulations" and the observations are as follows:-
"31. It is not understood how those paragraphs are of assistance to the Appellant.
There is no finding in paragraph 68, but only discussion of facts, which led to the
decision, and paragraph 72 is clearly against the Appellants. This Court unequivocally
held that the State was not bound to accept or follow the UGC Regulations."
(ii) This Court in Dr.Chidananda P. Mansur (supra) while considering the Writ Appeal against the
order of learned Single Judge whereby the direction to continue in service till the attainment of age
of 65 Years in terms of the age of retirement prescribed by UGC Regulations 2018, had been
negatived. The observations made at Para-5 are as follows:-
"5. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and having perused the case
papers, we decline indulgence in the matter for the following reasons:
a) The respondent-University is established under Section 3 of the University of
Agricultural Sciences Act, 1963 (hereafter referred to as 'the State Act'). Section 39 of
the State Act provides for promulgating Statutes regulating the service conditions of
employees of the University of Agricultural Sciences. Accordingly, the Statutes having
been made and resolution having been passed, the age of 62 years admittedly, has
been prescribed as the age of superannuation, in terms of the Government Order
dated 28.10.2009. Accordingly, all employees of the University have been demitting
their Office/Post on attaining the age of 62 years, although, with no demur.
b) UGC Regulations on Minimum Qualifications for Appointment of Teachers and
Other Academic Staff in Universities and Colleges and Measures for the Maintenance
of Standards in Higher Education, 2018 (hereafter called as 'UGC Regulations'), are
promulgated under the provisions of Sections 14 & 26 of the University Grants
Commission Act, 1956 (hereafter referred to as 'the UGC Act'). In terms of UGC
recommendation, the Central Government vide order dated 31.12.2008 extended the
benefits of Sixth Central Pay Commission Recommendation to the "Teachers in the
Central Universities". In fact, the very Preamble of the said Order specifically
mentions this. One of these benefits is the enhanced age of retirement i.e., 65 years.
Therefore, these benefits did not extend to the employees of the State Universities which are
different from the Central ones. A similar order was issued on 02.11.2017. It does not ipso facto
extend to the employees of the State Universities and therefore, a committee was constituted to look
into the matter. The Committee at recommendation 12 recommends enhancement of the age of
retirement from 62 years to 65. A recommendation of the kind per se is not justiciable and therefore
no support can be drawn from the same by the appellant/petitioner, as rightly contended by the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/121607168/ 147
Mr Govinda Setty vs State Of Karnataka on 17 February, 2023
learned Government Advocate and the Panel Counsel.
c) The vehement contention of the learned Senior Counsel Laxminarayana that the UGC has
prescribed 65 years as the age of superannuation and therefore the impugned statute of the
University prescribing 62 years for retirement is liable to be voided, is bit difficult to countenance.
This argument is structured on a wrong premise that the subject UGC Regulation and the University
Statutes are in conflict with each other and therefore, the former being the Central Law would
override the later which is a State Law. True it is that when the Central Law occupies the a field in
respect of an item in the Concurrent List, the State Law cannot operate as provided under Article
254 of the Constitution of India. However, the conflict can logically arise only if the Central Law is
shown to impose a norm, with the no option whatsoever. That is not the case here. The UGC Letters
dated 30.01.2018 and 31.01.2018 although extend the benefit of 7th Central Pay Commission Report
do not much say about the enhancement of age of retirement from 62 years to 65 as being obligatory
qua the State Universities of the kind. When option is given by the Central Law as to the age of
superannuation, it is open to the State Universities to prescribe the age of retirement for its
employees, in variance. In such a situation the doctrine of occupied field is not invocable.
d) The above view gains support from the following observations of the Apex Court in B.Bharat
Kumar & others Vs. Osmania University & others (2007)11 SCC 58:
"16. Much debate was centered around the interpretation of the words 'wish' and
'gamut'. In our opinion it is wholly unnecessary and we have merely mentioned the
arguments for being rejected. Once the scheme suggested that it was left to the "wish"
of the Sate Government, there will be no point in trying to assign the unnatural
meaning to the word 'wish'. ..."
"19. Learned counsel also argued, to a great extent, the desirability of the age of
superannuation being raised to 60 or 62, as the case may be. We again reiterate that
it is not for his Court to formulate a policy as to what the age of retirement should be
as by doing so we would be trailing into the dangerous area of the wisdom of the
legislation. If the State Government in its discretion, which is permissible to it under
the scheme, decides to restrict the age and not increase it to 60, or as the case may be,
62, it was perfectly justified in doing so."
"23. Further it is clear from the letter dated 27-7-1998 that it is expressly left to the
discretion of the State Government to implement or not to implement the policy.
Once there is no question of any conflict we do not think that would have the effect of
overruling T.P. George...."
The reliance of the appellant/petitioner on the decision of the Apex Court in Kalyani Mathivanan Vs.
K,V Jeyaraj (2015)6 SCC 363 again does not much come to his support. At paragraph 62.3, 62.4 &
62.5, it is observed as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/121607168/ 148
Mr Govinda Setty vs State Of Karnataka on 17 February, 2023
"62.3. UGC Regulations, 2010 are mandatory to teachers and other academic staff in
all the Central Universities and Colleges thereunder and the Institutions deemed to
be Universities whose maintenance expenditure is met by the UGC.
62.4. UGC Regulations, 2010 is directory for the Universities, Colleges and other
higher educational institutions under the purview of the State Legislation as the
matter has been left to the State Government to adopt and implement the Scheme.
Thus, UGC Regulations, 2010 is partly mandatory and is partly directory.
62.5. UGC Regulations, 2010 having not adopted by the State Tamil Nadu, the
question of conflict between State Legislation and Statutes framed under Central
Legislation does not arise. Once it is adopted by the State Government, the State
Legislation to be amended appropriately. In such case also there shall be no conflict
between the State Legislation and the Central Legislation."
We are of the view that these observations far from supporting the case of the appellant/petitioner,
come to the rescue of the answering respondents.
e) Learned Panel counsel for the University is more than justified in heavily banking upon a
Co-ordinate Bench decision in State of Karnataka Vs. Dr. R. Halesha and others, ILR 2012 KAR 545,
wherein at paragraph 15 it is observed as under"
"15. ... The UGC has taken the stand that the subject Directions are not mandatory so
far as the increase of the age of superannuation to 65 years even in respect of
Teachers in Colleges in the State. This also obviates and renders superfluous the
interesting and intricate interplay between entries in the Union List and the
Concurrent List of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India."
These observations were made in the light of the claim for enhancement of age of retirement from
62 years to 65 years by the employees of the Universities on the basis of UGC norms. After said
decision, a learned Single Judge of this Court in more or less a similar fact matrix decided another
case in W.P. No.103868/2018 between Dr. P.V. Kenchanagoudar Vs. The Principal Secretary and
another disposed off on 22.06.2018. The claim of the employees of the State Universities founded on
UGC Regulations and Central Government Orders came to be negatived. The contention of the
appellant/petitioner that these decisions of the Co-ordinate Bench and the learned Single Judge
were structured on Sixth Pay Commission Recommendations and therefore not applicable to a case
involving Seventh Pay Commission Recommendation is bit difficult to countenance, the differential
being irrelevant to the issue debated before us.
f) The impugned Statute of the University prescribes the age of 60 years for superannuation of the
employees. Earlier it was 58 years. It is the State Government which has prescribed the age of 62
years which the University has adopted. Thus, even if the impugned Statute is voided on the grounds
urged herein, no purpose would be served. The fixation of age of retirement of Public Servants has a
bearing on the State Exchequer and the employment opportunities for others. We are told at the Bar
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/121607168/ 149
Mr Govinda Setty vs State Of Karnataka on 17 February, 2023
that there are thousands of employees in various Universities and in the constituent & affiliated
Colleges. If the prayer, as sought for, is granted, all these employees would continue in the Office for
an additional period of three years and eventually, there would be no vacancies for fresh
appointments. This is not desirable. At what age the Public Servants like teachers in the
Universities/constituent colleges should retire is purely within the domain of the State Executive,
which bears the expenditure towards salary, emoluments and terminal benefits. In matters like this,
a host of financial & other factors enter the fray of decision making and Courts cannot readily
venture interference therein, the worth of such factors not being assessable by judicially manageable
standards. The UGC, in its wisdom, has left to the State Universities to prescribe the age of
superannuation, as already mentioned above. That concession if at all that be, is not put in challenge
by the appellant/petitioner. Whether it is prudent to retain old blood or to infuse fresh one is best
left to the wisdom of the State Executive & the Universities. After all, "Old order changeth, yielding
place to the new and God fulfills himself in many ways ........" said Alfred Tennyson (1809- 1892).
(iii) It must be noticed that this Court31 had specifically dealt with the contention that the earlier
judgments relate to the 6th Pay Commission and would not Chidananda P. Mansur (supra) apply to
a case involving the 7th Pay Commission, but has rejected such contention.
(iv) Insofar as the 7th Pay Commission is concerned, the UGC has in its communication dated
30.01.2018, while clarifying regarding revision of pay, has observed that the Scheme relating to the
recommendation of 7th Central Pay Commission would be subject to the guidelines issued by the
Ministry of Finance (Department of Expenditure) vide OM No.1/1/2016-E.III(A) dated 13.01.2017.
(v) The communication of MHRD to UGC in the context of revision of pay dated 02.11.2017 of
teachers and equivalent cadres has observed at Clause 12 as follows:
"12. Superannuation and Reemployment The existing provisions on superannuation
and reemployment of teachers shall continue."
(vi) No doubt, at Clause-16 of MHRD's letter dated 02.11.2017, while discussing the applicability of
the Scheme, it is observed at Clause-16(iv)(h) that, if the Scheme is sought to be extended to the
Universities, Colleges and other Higher Educational Institutions coming under the purview of State
Legislature; that the payment of central assistance for implementing the Scheme is subject to the
condition that the entire Scheme along with all the conditions laid down by UGC by way of
Regulations and other guidelines shall be implemented by the State Government and Universities
and Colleges as a Composite Scheme without any modification, except in regard to the date of
implementation. This communication of the Central Government dated 02.11.2017 is as per
Clause-18 subject to the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Finance (Department of Expenditure)
vide OM No.1/1/2016-E.III(A) dated 13.01.2017.
(vii) It is the contention of the petitioners that a cumulative reading of the letter of MHRD dated
02.11.2017 and UGC Regulations dated 30.06.2010 read with letter of MHRD dated 31.12.2008, the
policy of the Central Government is that the age of superannuation shall be 65 Years which is
mandatory. The earlier direction of Central Government through MHRD letter dated 14.08.2012
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/121607168/ 150
Mr Govinda Setty vs State Of Karnataka on 17 February, 2023
addressed to all the Educational Secretaries has at point No.4 observed that the condition of
enhancement of age of superannuation would be de-linked from the condition of payment of central
share of 80% arrears to the State as extracted supra at para-4.4. Such direction of the Government is
to be construed to be a direction under Section 20 of the UGC Act32 and binding upon UGC.
(viii) No doubt, the communication of Central Government through MHRD letter dated 02.11.2017
does not refer to the letter of MHRD dated 14.08.2012, but observes at para-12 that the existing
provisions on superannuation and re-employment of Teachers shall continue. If that were to be so,
the earlier communication
20. Directions by the Central Government − (1) In the discharge of its functions under this Act, the
Commission shall be guided by such directions on questions of policy relating to national purposes
as may be given to it by the Central Government. (2) If any dispute arises between Central
Government and the Commission as to whether a question is or is not a question of policy relating to
national purposes, the decision of the Central Government shall be final.
of MHRD dated 14.08.2012 also remains intact and in operation.
(ix) The only subsequent communication of UGC dated 30.01.2018 clarifies that it is subject to the
guidelines issued by the Ministry of Finance dated 13.01.2017 and also refers to the communications
of the Central Government dated 02.11.2017 and a combined reading will not have the effect of
ignoring the communication of 14.08.2012 of MHRD which even otherwise is binding upon UGC as
a direction under Section 20 of the UGC Act. Accordingly, the UGC Circular to the Vice Chancellors
dated 30.01.2018 as well as UGC'c communication dated 31.01.2018 addressed to Education
Secretaries of all the States cannot be construed as altering the earlier Government Regulations.
(x) It must be noted that there is a difference between conditions of service which is within the sole
domain of the Government under Article 309 of the Constitution of India which is regulated by
appropriate Legislature on one hand and the requirement of adherence of Minimum Standards in
terms of Section 26(g) of the UGC Act, which falls within the domain of UGC and would be subject
to the directions of the Central Government under Section 20 of the UGC Act. The superannuation is
a condition of service and would fall within the ambit of Article 309 of the Constitution of India till
statutory provision is made by the appropriate Legislature. Such Rules would have statutory force.
Wherever the age of superannuation is contained in either (a) KCSR insofar as employees of the
Government, (b) Provisions of Karnataka Education Act, 1983 insofar as the employees of Aided and
Unaided Institutions, (c) Acts of the University, Statutes of the University, (d) Rules/Byelaws of
Private Educational Institutions which are not Aided, but affiliated to the University where such
Byelaws are framed under the authority of the Universities Act/statutes, the same would prevail.
Accordingly, the above would hold the field insofar as superannuation is concerned.
(xi) As regards maintenance of standards [Section 26(g) of UGC Act], qualification that is required
for any person to be appointed to the Teaching Staff [Section 26(e) of UGC Act], the power is vested
with the UGC to make Regulations consistent with Act and Rules.

(xii) The aspect of prescribing qualifications fall within the domain of maintenance of standards
which has nothing to do with the aspect of superannuation that falls within Article 309 of
Constitution of India and operates in a separate sphere.
(xiii) The Apex Court in Professor (Dr.) Sreejith P.S. v. Dr. Rajasree M.S. & Ors33 while considering
the appointment of Vice Chancellor, has held that the prescription regarding qualification for
appointments under the UGC Regulations would prevail over the diluted qualifications provided
under the State Legislation. It is further held that as a subject "Education" is contained in CIVIL
APPEAL NOS. 7634-7635 OF 2022 the Concurrent List of the Seventh Schedule, the UGC
Regulations enacted in exercise of power under Clause (e) and (g) of sub-section (1) of Section 26 of
UGC Act as well as SPU Act of 1955 would be traceable to power under the entry "Education" in the
Concurrent List and in case of conflict of both the Acts, in light principle of repugnancy under
Article 254 of the Constitution of India and under Article 254 (1) of the Constitution of India, the
Central Act i.e., the UGC Act would prevail. This judgment follows the same line of cases including
that of Kalyani Mathivanan (supra), Gambhirdan (supra) and State of West Bengal Vs. Anindya
Sundar Das & Ors.34 However, it must be noted that all the cases referred to above are relatable to
qualification of appointment of Vice-Chancellor and such qualification no doubt relates to
recruitment, but still would fall outside the purview of Article 309 of the Constitution of India which
deals with the conditions of Service, which would include the age of superannuation.
(xiv) As already held, superannuation has noting to do with qualification and being a condition of
service would fall within the ambit of Article 309 of the Constitution of India and accordingly, the
Rules/statutory provision under Article 309 of the Constitution of India would prevail over the UGC
Regulation that may fall under "Education" in the Concurrent List.
6. Accordingly, the Writ Petitions are dismissed with the following directions :-
i) Insofar as the petitioners who have continued to work by virtue of interim orders
granted by this Court, their continuance till date is to be treated as continuance on
re-employment basis in terms of the applicable Rules, University Statutes and
Government Orders as are applicable and are entitled to emoluments on such
re-employment terms and will not be entitled to remuneration paid to the regular
employees.
ii) The question of adjudication relating to re-employment after superannuation and
passing direction as regards such aspect does not arise and is a matter to be
adjudicated separately if there is any case of legally addressable grievance that may
arise post superannuation.
iii) In all the cases dealt with, the continuance till date by virtue of interim orders
cannot be treated to be a dispute relating to re-employment requiring passing of
directions.
iv) After having attained the age of superannuation, it is an aspect of re-

Mr Govinda Setty vs State Of Karnataka on 17 February, 2023
employment by the employer subject to fulfillment of conditions as are stipulated in the applicable
Rules/Government Orders/Regulations as the case may be. It is clarified that there cannot be
automatic extension of tenure and the extension is on the basis of conscious decision of the
employer in light of the applicable Rules.
