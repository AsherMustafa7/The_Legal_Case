ORDER
This Writ petition has been filed for a direction to the respondents to consider the representation
dated 24.01.2020 in view of the orders in M.W.10 of 2001 dated 11.07.2002 and in C.P.No.25 of
2015 dated 26.06.2018 of the Labour Court.
2.Mr.M.Karuppasamy Pandian, learned Government Advocate takes notice on behalf of the
respondents 1 and 2 and Mr.C.M.Mari Chellaiah Prabhu, learned Counsel takes notice on behalf of
the third respondent. By consent of both parties, this writ petition is taken up for final disposal at
the stage of admission itself.
3.The case of the petitioner is that he is working as a Packer at 3rd respondent's Co-operative Credit
Society from 01.01.1997 onwards. The third http://www.judis.nic.in respondent has not paid
minimum wages as per Minimum Wages Act. Hence, the petitioner filed a case before the Authority
under Minimum Wages Act, Madurai (Deputy Commissioner of Labour) in M.W.10 of 2001 and the
case was decided in favour of the petitioner on 11.07.2002 and directed the third respondent to pay
a sum of Rs.45,938/- within a period of 30 days from the date of receipt of the order. The grievance
of the petitioner is that though he was not paid wages as per the Labour Court order, the respondent
delegated him to work as Salesman(Additional in charge) as per Administrative Committee
Resolution No. 1, dated 17.05.2001 and the respondent has not taken any initiatives to regularize the
petitioner's service but utilized his work to various posts without giving the corresponding salary.
4.The learned counsel for the petitioner would further submit that the Government passed
G.O(Ms).No.238 dated 19.06.2000 to grant new scale of pay to the fair price shop employees. As per
the said G.O, the salary was fixed as Rs.1200-2513-13251-4517-1640. The petitioner was paid only
Rs.5,43,030/- and the balance of Rs.1,30,163/- has to be paid by the respondents. Hence, the
petitioner filed a petition before the Labour Court, Madurai in C.P.No.25 of 2015
http://www.judis.nic.in and the Labour Court by an order, dated 26.06.2018, directed the third
respondent to pay a sum of Rs.1,30,163/- to the petitioner as arrears of salary for the post of
Salesman in charge from 01.05.2001 to 31.03.2015. In view of the above order, the petitioner sent a
representation to all the respondents claiming the arrears of wages and salary as ordered in M.W.10
of 2001, dated 11.07.2002 and in C.P.No. 25 of 2015, dated 26.06.2018. But, till date, the
respondents have not taken any effort to settle the amount as ordered by the Labour Court. Against
which, the petitioner is before this Court.
5. Heard the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner; learned Government Advocate appearing
for the respondents 1 & 2 and the learned counsel appearing for the third respondent.

6.Perusal of record shows that though the Deputy Commissioner of Labour, Madurai in M.W.10 of
2001 has directed the third respondent to pay a sum of Rs.45,938/- to the petitioner, within a period
of 30 days, the third respondent has not paid the same. The petitioner was utilized to various posts
without giving the corresponding salary. In these circumstance, the Government passed
G.O(Ms).No. http://www.judis.nic.in 238, dated 19.06.2000 to grant new scale of pay to the fair
price shop employees. As per the said G.O, the petitioner is entitled to a sum of Rs.6,73,193/-,
whereas he was paid only Rs.5,43,030/- and the balance of Rs.1,30,163/- has to be paid by the
respondents. Hence, the petitioner filed C.P.No.25 of 2015 before the Labour Court, Madurai where
the learned Judge directed the third respondent to pay a sum of Rs.1,30,163/- to the petitioner as
arrears of salary for the post of Salesman in charge from 01.05.2001 to 31.03.2015. But, so far, no
action has been taken by the third respondent. Hence, the petitioner sent a representation, dated
23.02.2020 to all the respondents claiming the arrears of wages and salary as ordered in M.W. 10 of
2001, dated 11.07.2002 and in C.P.No.25 of 2015, dated 26.06.2018. But, so far, no effort has been
taken by the respondents.
7.Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and without adverting to the merits of the
case, the respondents are directed to dispose the representation of the petitioner, dated 23.02.2020
within a period of twelve weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order. It is needless to say
that the petitioner shall send the copy of the representation along with this order copy.
