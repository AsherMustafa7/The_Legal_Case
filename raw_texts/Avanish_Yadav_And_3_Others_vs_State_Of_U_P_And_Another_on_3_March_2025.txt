3. Earlier, the applicants have approached before this Court by means of filing an application U/s
482 Cr.P.C. bearing No.40028 of 2024 wherein the following order was passed:-
"Heard learned counsel for the applicants and learned A.G.A. for the State.
The present 482 Cr.P.C. application has been filed to quash the charge sheet no.163
of 2023 dated 17.10.2023 and cognizance/summoning order dated 14.12.2023 as well
as the entire proceeding of Case No.30040 of 2023 (State vs. Avanish Yadav and
Others), arising out of Case Crime No.144 of 2023, under Sections 498A, 323, 504,
506 IPC and Section 3/4 D.P. Act, Police Station-Barhan, District-Agra, pending
before the court of Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate IInd, Agra on the basis of
compromise.
Learned counsel for the applicants submits that the present dispute is a result of
matrimonial discord between the applicant no.1 (husband) and opposite party no.2.
Now, the parties have reconciled their differences and a compromise has been
entered between them and they are decided to live separately. In this regard, a an
application alongwith compromise deed on behalf of opposite party no.2 has been
filed before the court concerned, copy of the same has been appended as Annexure
No.3 of this application. Therefore, continuance of proceedings against the applicants
would futile exercise and wastage of time of the Court and will be abuse of process of
law. Hence, proceedings of the aforesaid case be quashed in the light of law laid down
by the Apex Court in the case of Gian Singh v. State of Punjab reported in (2012) 10
SCC 303.
Learned AGA, however, submits that it is the concerned court below, which has to
verify the fact as to whether the parties have entered into compromise, hence the
applicants may approach the concerned court below and move an application with
respect to compromise between the parties, which will be decided in accordance with
law.
In view of the above, both the parties are directed to appear before the court below
along with an application for verification of compromise deed as well as a certified
copy of this order. It is expected that the trial court may fix a date for the verification
of the compromise and after ensuring the presence of parties, pass an appropriate
order with respect to the same in accordance with law, as expeditiously as possible,
preferably within a period of two months from today. While passing the order
verifying the compromise, the concerned court shall also record the statement of the
parties as to whether all the terms and conditions mentioned in the original
compromise deed, so filed, have been fulfilled or not?
The court in that scenario will allow the parties to obtain certified copy of the order
verifying the compromise deed and it will be open to the applicants to approach this
Court again for quashing of the proceedings.
