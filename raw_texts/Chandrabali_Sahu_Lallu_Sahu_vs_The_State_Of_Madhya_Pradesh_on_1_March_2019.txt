This is Third application of the applicant Chandrabali Sahu @ Lallu Sahu filed under section 439
Cr.P.C. for grant of bail in connection with Crime No.408/2017 registered at Police Station
Hanumana, District Rewa for the offence punishable under Sections 376(2)(f)(i), 308, 506 & 201 of
IPC and Section 3/4 of POCSO Act.
The first bail application of the applicant has been dismissed as withdrawn vide order dated
19.02.2018 in M.Cr.C.No.5238/2018 and the second bail application has also been dismissed as
withdrawn vide order dated 31.07.2018 in M.Cr.C.No.25519/2018.
As per the prosecution case, 9 months prior to 26.10.2017 applicant came to prosecutrix house, who
was minor situated at village Asaha Ramratan and committed rape with her due to which she
became pregnant and gave birth to a baby. On that applicant again came to the prosecutrix house
and took that baby in a bag with him and threw in a field. On that police registered Crime
No.408/2017 for the offence punishable under Sections 376(2)(f)(i), 308, 506 & 201 of IPC and
Section 3/4 of POCSO Act and also seized the bones of the said baby on the information of the
applicant.
Learned counsel for the applicant submits that the applicant has not committed any offence and has
falsely been implicated in the offence. It is alleged that the applicant committed rape with the
prosecutrix 9 months prior to 26.10.2017 due to which prosecutrix become pregnant and gave birth
to a baby. It is also alleged that after that applicant again came to the prosecutrix house and took
that baby with him in a bag and threw that baby in a field. But prosecutrix lodged the report some
days later to the second incident. There is 2 MCRC-7257-2019 no plausible explanation regarding
the delay in FIR. Even in the DNA Report, it is clearly mentioned that prosecutrix is the biological
mother of the baby but the applicant is not the biological father of the said baby. Which clearly
shows that prosecutrix falsely implicated applicant in the crime. The charge sheet has been filed.
The applicant is in custody since 29.10.2017 and the conclusion of the trial is likely to take a long
time, hence prayed for the release of the applicant on bail.
