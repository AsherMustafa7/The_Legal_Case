before it.
6. In view of the above, both the parties are directed to appear before the court below
along with copy of compromise deed as well as a certified copy of this order within a
two week from today. It is expected that the trial court may fix a date for the
verification of the compromise and after ensuring the presence of parties, pass an
appropriate order with respect to the same in accordance with law, after hearing the
informant, as expeditiously as possible, preferably within a period of four weeks from
today. While passing the order verifying the compromise, the concerned court shall
also record the statement of the parties as to whether all the terms and conditions
mentioned in the original compromise deed, so filed, have been fulfilled or not?

the parties concerned, all disputes between them have come to an end, and therefore, further
proceedings against the applicant in the aforesaid case is liable to be quashed by this Court.
6. Learned A.G.A. for the State as well as counsel for the opposite party no.2 does not dispute the
aforesaid fact and submitted at the Bar that since the parties concerned have settled their dispute as
mentioned above, therefore, they have no objection in quashing the impugned criminal proceedings
against the applicants.
7. Before proceeding any further it shall be apt to make a brief reference to the following cases:-

Merchant Vs. Central Bureau of Investigation; (2008) 9 SCC 677, iii. Manoj Sharma

SCC 303, v. Narindra Singh and others Vs. State of Punjab; ( 2014) 6 SCC 466,
8. In the aforesaid judgments, the Apex Court has categorically held that compromise can be made
between the parties even in respect of certain cognizable and non compoundable offences. Reference
may also be made to the decision given by this Court in Shaifullah and Others Vs. State of U.P. &
Another; 2013 (83) ACC 278. in which the law expounded by the Apex court in the aforesaid cases
has been explained in detail.
9. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, as noted herein above, and also the
submissions made by the counsel for the parties, the court is of the considered opinion that no
useful purpose shall be served by prolonging the proceedings of the above mentioned criminal case
as the parties have already settled their dispute.
