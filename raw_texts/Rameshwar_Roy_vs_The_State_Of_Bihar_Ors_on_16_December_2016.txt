ORAL JUDGMENT
(Per: HONOURABLE THE ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE) Date: 16-12-2016 This application is for
condonation of delay of 45 days in filing the Letters Patent Appeal.
For the reasons mentioned in the Interlocutory application, we are satisfied that the appellant has
shown sufficient cause to seek condonation of delay in filing the present Letters Patent Appeal.
Consequently, Interlocutory Application is allowed and Patna High Court LPA No.248 of 2016
dt.16-12-2016 delay in filing the Letters Patent Appeal is condoned.
The challenge in the present Letters Patent Appeal is to an order passed by the learned Single Bench
of this Court on 23rd September, 2015 whereby, the claim of the appellant for grant of Assured

Rameshwar Roy vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 16 December, 2016
Career Progression (A.C.P.) pay scale in terms of ACP Rule, 2003 was declined. The claim was not
allowed for the reason that the appellant has been imposed punishment on 27.08.1993 disentitling
the appellant for promotion for 10 years.
Learned counsel for the appellant contends that such condition to deny promotion is for regular
promotion and not for the grant of ACP pay scale.
However, we do not find any merit in such argument. The clause 4(5) of the ACP Rules, 2003 reads
as under:
"The prescribed requirements and mode of sanction of financial progression under
the scheme shall be the same which are prescribed under the Recruitment/Service
Rules for regular promotion against vacancies. If the Rules/Resolutions prescribed
passing of the departmental examination or any qualification for promotion that shall
also be an essential condition for sanction of benefit under the scheme, provided that
after completion of 12/24 years of service, the financial progression shall become due
and for this, there shall be no bar of period prescribed for regular promotion.
Explanation: (i) Notwithstanding any provision for relaxation in the period of service
for regular promotion to certain categories of employees contained in any Rules, no
Patna High Court LPA No.248 of 2016 dt.16-12-2016 relaxation of conditions in the
period of 12/24 to eligibility years shall be granted for the benefits of financial
progression under the Scheme.
(ii) If the first financial progression, granted to a Govt. servant, is delayed beyond 12
years of regular service due to disciplinary proceedings etc. or due to the government
servant being found unfit for promotion, then the second financial progression under
the Scheme shall be granted after 12 years for the date of the first financial
progression."
Since there is an order of punishment of denying him regular promotion for a period of 10 years, the
appellant in view of the aforesaid clause cannot get even benefit of ACP pay scale.
We do not find that the rules of regular promotion are not applicable while granting the benefits
under the ACP scheme as the same Rules as are applicable for regular promotion has to be applied
even before the grant of ACP Scale. Consequently, we do not find any merit in the present Letters
Patent Appeal and the same is dismissed.
