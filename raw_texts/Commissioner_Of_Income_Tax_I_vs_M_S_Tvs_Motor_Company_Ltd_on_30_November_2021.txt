JUDGMENT
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198855877/ 1
Commissioner Of Income Tax I vs M/S.Tvs Motor Company Ltd on 30 November, 2021
(Judgment was delivered by R.MAHADEVAN, J.) This tax case appeal filed at the instance of the
Revenue, calling in question the correctness of the order dated 16.01.2009 passed by the Income
Tax Appellate Tribunal Madras 'D' Bench, in I.T.A.No.490 /Mds/2008, relating to the assessment
year 2001-02, was admitted by this court on 04.08.2009, on the following substantial question of
law:-
“ Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was right in
holding that expenditure on replacement of dies and moulds are to be allowed as cur
rent repairs?
2. Today, when the matter was taken up for consideration, the learned counsel for the
appellant / Revenue as well as the respondent / assessee jointly submitted that the
issue involved herein has already been considered and decided by this Court in favour
of the assessee by judgment dated 09.01.2014, passed in TCA.Nos.173 and 174 of
2009, the relevant passage of which, is usefully extracted hereunder:
“29. As regards the expenditure on dies & moulds, the assessee pointed out that it
debited an amount of Rs.11,17,68,169/- towards dies and moulds only to replace
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis them in the place of worn out dies and moulds. The
assessee in the memorandum of income added this amount to the total income and
claimed the cost of dies and moulds of Rs.22,66,52,504/- under Section 31 of the Act.
The assessee stated that within a period of one year of installation, the life of the dies
and moulds would become obsolete and this was due to high production involved.
Thus, replacement of the new dye in the place of old dye would quality for current
repairs under Section 31 of the Act. The Assessing officer, however, rejected the
contention of the assessee and the Assessing Officer pointed out that the assessee was
claiming depreciation upto 1999-2000 under Section 32 of the Act and only in the
year under consideration, it started claiming deduction under Section 31 of the Act.
The Tribunal pointed out that the dies and moulds were not plant and machinery, yet
the replacement of dies and moulds were not in the nature of installation of
machinery in the factory. Such moulds and dies were normally attached to the
machines to suit the individual requirement of particular product. So holding, the
Tribunal held that expenditure incurred on replacement of dies and moulds was
revenue in nature. It relied on the decision of Karnataka High Court in the case of
Mysore Spun Concrete Pipe Pvt. Ltd., reported in 194 ITR 159.
30. As far as this issue is concerned, learned counsel appearing for the assessee
placed reliance on the decision of this Court reported in (2013) 357 ITR 720 (Mad) in
the case of Super Spinning Mills Ltd., Vs. Assistant Commissioner of Income-tax
related to the expenditure on replacement of the machinery parts. The assessee
therein engaged in the business of manufacture and trading in cotton yarn and allied
products and the assessee incurred expenditure in respect of replacement of certain
textile machinery. On a question as to whether such replacement of parts would be
current repairs of capital in nature, this Court considered the decisions in the case of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198855877/ 2
Commissioner Of Income Tax I vs M/S.Tvs Motor Company Ltd on 30 November, 2021
CIT Vs. Saravana Spinning Mills P; Ltd., reported in (2007) 293 ITR 201 (SC), CIT
Vs. Ramaraju Surgical Cotton Mills reported in (2007) 294 ITR 328 (SC) and CIT Vs.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Mangayarkarasi Mills P.Ltd., reported in (2009)
315 ITR 114 (SC) and pointed out that the question as to whether the expenditure
incurred on replacement of machinery is revenue or capital rests on the nature of
capital incurred vis-a-vis the benefit derived. This Court referred to the decision in
the case of CIT Vs. Saravana Spinning Mills P.Ltd., reported in (2007) 293 ITR 201
(SC) and in particular to the decision in the case of CIT Vs. Sri Mangayarkarasi Mills
P.Ltd., reported in (2009) 315 ITR 114 (SC) and pointed out as under:-
" 10. The question as to whether the expenditure incurred on replacement of
machinery is revenue or capital expenditure, particularly in the nature of
replacements of parts, thus rests on the nature of expenditure incurred, vis-a-vis the
benefit that the assessee derives. The ratio deductible from the decisions referred to
above are:
(i) To decide the applicability of Section 31(i), the test is not whether the expenditure
is revenue or capital in nature, but whether the expenditure is "current repairs". The
basic test is to find out whether expenditure is incurred to "preserve and maintain"
an already existing asset and the expenditure must not be to bring a new asset into
existence or to obtain a new advantage vide [2007] 293 ITR 201 (SC) (Commissioner
of Income Tax Vs. Saravana Spinning Mills P. Ltd.)
(ii) Under Section 31(i), the deduction admissible is only for current repairs.
Therefore, the question as to whether the expenditure incurred by the assessee
conceptually is revenue or capital in nature is not relevant for deciding the question
whether such expenditure comes within the etymological meaning of the expression
"current repairs". In other words, even if the expenditure is revenue in nature, it may
not fall in the connotation of "current repairs" - [2007] 293 ITR 201 (SC)
(Commissioner of Income Tax Vs. Saravana Spinning Mills P. Ltd.)
(iii) A new asset or new/different advantage https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis cannot
amount to `current repairs'. - 2009-TIOL-86-SC- II (CIT Vs. Sri Mangayarkarasi
Mills P. Limited)
(iv) Repair implies existence of a part of the machine which has malfunctioned,
thereby requiring repair to that machinery, plant etc. Replacement cannot be a
current repair, for, "replacement" and "current repair" do not go hand in hand . If
one is to hold otherwise, it would only make Section 31(i) wholly redundant and
absurd. Thus, replacement expenditure cannot be said to be `current repairs' vide
[2007] 293 ITR 201 (SC) (Commissioner of Income Tax Vs. Saravana Spinning Mills
P. Ltd.) and 2009-TIOL-86-SC- II (CIT Vs. Sri Mangayarkarasi Mills P. Limited)
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198855877/ 3
Commissioner Of Income Tax I vs M/S.Tvs Motor Company Ltd on 30 November, 2021
(v) Expenditure is deductible under section 37 only if it (a) is not deductible under
sections 30-36, (b) is of a revenue nature, (c) is incurred during the current
accounting year and (d) is incurred wholly and exclusively for the purpose of the
business. - 2009-
TIOL-86-SC-II (CIT Vs. Sri Mangayarkarasi Mills P. Limited);
(vi) Expenditure is of a capital nature when it amounts to an enduring advantage for the business
and repair is different from bringing a new asset for the business. Further, bringing into existence a
new asset or an enduring benefit for the assessee amounts to capital expenditure vide Lakshmiji
Sugar Mills (P) Co. v. CIT (AIR 1972 SC 159) referred in 2009-TIOL-86-SC-II (CIT Vs. Sri
Mangayarkarasi Mills P. Limited).
(vii) Therefore, whether an expenditure is revenue or capital in nature would depend on the facts of
each case. - [2007] 293 ITR 201 (SC) (Commissioner of Income Tax Vs. Saravana Spinning Mills P.
Ltd.)"
This Court also referred to the decision in the case of CIT Vs. Mahalakshmi Textile
Mills Ltd., reported in (1967) 66 ITR 710 (SC) on the issue of current repairs and
pointed out that so long as there is no change in the performance of the machinery
and the parts that were replaced performing precisely the same
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis function, expenditure could only be concerned as
current repairs of the plant and machinery.
31. Applying the ratio of the decision cited above, when we look into the facts of the above cases, it is
evident that with regard to the moulds and dies attached to the machinery like press designs
specification, moulds and dies are not independent of the plant and machinery, but are parts of the
machinery. Once the dies are worn out, the machines cannot turn out the product to the business
specifications and this has to be obtained only on a replacement of the dies and moulds, a fact which
is not refuted by the revenue. It is no doubt true that the assessee claimed depreciation on dies and
moulds. Yet in the decision in the case of CIT Vs. Mahalakshmi Textile Mills Ltd., reported in (1967)
66 ITR 710 (SC), the Apex Court pointed out that all questions whether of law or of fact, which relate
to the assessment year of the assessee could be raised in any year under consideration before the
Officer as well as before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal too and if, for reasons recorded by the
departmental authorities in rejecting a contention raised by the assessee, the grant of relief to an
assessee is justified on another ground, the Revenue is bound to consider such claim of granting the
relief. The Apex Court pointed out that the right of the assessee to the relief is not restricted to the
plea raised by him. On the facts before us, when the dies and moulds were attached to the machine
to manufacture the designed product, we have no hesitation to accept the plea of the assessee that
the claim would fall for consideration only under Section 31 of the Act.
32. In the unreported decision of this Court dated 27.04.2012 in Tax Case (Appeal).No.1011 of 2005
(The Commissioner of Income Tax, Madurai Vs. M/s.Machado Sons) on the question of repair made
to a ship, this Court pointed out that when the object of the expenditure was not for bringing into
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198855877/ 4
Commissioner Of Income Tax I vs M/S.Tvs Motor Company Ltd on 30 November, 2021
existence a new asset or to obtain a new advantage, the said expenditure qualifies to be considered
as current repairs under Section 31 of the Act. In so holding, after referring to the decision of the
Apex Court in the case of CIT https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Vs. M/s.Saravana Spinning Mills
P.Ltd., reported in (2007) 293 ITR 201, this Court further pointed out to the decision of the Apex
Court where it cautioned that all repairs are not current repairs on Section 31(1) of the Act; Section
31(1) of the Act limits the scope of allowability of expenditure as deduction in respect of repairs
made to machinery, plant or furniture by restricting it to the concept of "current repairs". Thus, this
Court pointed out that what is allowable as revenue expenditure under Section 37 of the Act are
those expenditure other than one falling for consideration under Sections 30 to 36 of the Act. The
Apex Court further pointed out the example that when the picture tube in a television set is replaced,
such repairs would come within the connotation of the phrase "current repairs". Thus, applying
these two decisions, we have no hesitation in rejecting the Revenue's appeal. We hold that the claim
being considered as current repairs, the same would fall under Section 31 of the Act as current
repairs. To that extent, we modify the order of the Tribunal. ”
3.Following the aforesaid judgment, the substantial question of law is answered against the Revenue
and this Tax Case Appeal stands dismissed.
No costs.
