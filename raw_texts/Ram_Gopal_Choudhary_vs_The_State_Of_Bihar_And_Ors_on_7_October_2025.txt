to the show cause notice within the stipulated time. It was contended that the Sub-Divisional Officer

before the Divisional Commissioner, Koshi Division, Saharsa, which was disposed of vide order
dated 04.07.2018 on the ground that after a lapse of eleven years, the vacancy has been filled, and
thus, there was no point in reviving the issue.

decision of the Division Bench of this Hon'ble Court passed in L.P.A. No. 861 of 2004 (Yogendra
Prasad Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors.) dated 06.09.2004, (Annexure-5) wherein it was held that even
if the license holder does not file any explanation to the show cause notice, the authority concerned
is legally bound to pass an order on merits. Accordingly, the Learned Senior counsel prayed that the
impugned orders be set aside and the matter be remanded back to the authority concerned for fresh
consideration on merits. Patna High Court CWJC No.18191 of 2018 dt.07-10-2025

matter to the authority for fresh consideration on merits.
