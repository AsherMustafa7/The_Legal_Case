T.Muthusamy vs The Commercial Tax Officer on 15 December, 2021
ORDER
The petitioner has challenged the impugned Assessment Order dated 12.12.2003 passed by the
respondent bearing reference No.RC.1279/2000 B1.
2. By the impugned order, the respondent had demanded a sum of Rs.1,18,400/- towards Entry Tax
payable under the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Tax on Entry of Motor Vehicles into Local Areas
Act, 1990. Apart from the tax, a penalty of Rs.2,36,800/- has been demanded from the petitioner.
3. Appearing on behalf of the petitioner, the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner submits that
the petitioner had purchased the “MMV Hydraulic Mobile Crane” from M/s.Balagi Agencies in
Pondicherry which was originally registered in the name of the said company / owner on 21.11.1994.
The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner further submits that the year of the manufacture of the
vehicle is 1994 and in terms of proviso to Section 3 of the Tamil Nadu Tax on Entry of Motor
Vehicles ______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Page No 2 of 14 into Local Areas
Act, 1990, the petitioner is exempted from paying the entry tax. It is submitted that 15 months time
prescribed under Clause (a) to proviso to Section 3 of the Tamil Nadu Tax on Entry of Motor
Vehicles into Local Areas Act, 1990 had expired in the year 1996 itself, whereas, the petitioner
purchased the vehicle in the year 1998 and therefore, the question of imposing entry tax on the
petitioner under the provisions of the aforesaid Act cannot be countenanced.
4. The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner further submits that in view of proposal to demand
from the petitioner, the petitioner has also re-transferred the vehicle back to the person in
Pondicherry and therefore, the petitioner cannot be made liable to pay the entry tax. The learned
Senior Counsel for the petitioner further placed reliance on the decision of the Division Bench of this
Court in Rds Projects Ltd. Vs. Commercial Tax Officer, (2007) 8 VST 574. It is submitted that as per
the aforesaid decision, no entry is payable as “MMV Hydraulic Mobile Crane” is not a 'motor vehicle'
within the meaning of Section 3 of the Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicles Act, 1989. It is submitted that
“MMV Hydraulic Mobile Crane” is not a 'motor vehicle' with the meaning of 'motor vehicle' in
Section 2(i) ______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Page No 3 of 14 of the Tamil
Nadu Tax on Entry of Motor Vehicles into Local Areas Act, 1990.
5. The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner further submits that the plea of alternate remedy at
this stage is not available in the light of the law settled by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Uflex Ltd.
Vs. Government of Tamil Nadu, order dated 17.09.2021 in Civil Appeal Nos.4862 to 4863 of 2021.
6. Appearing on behalf of the respondent, the learned Government Advocate submits that to claim
the benefit of proviso to Section 3 of the Tamil Nadu Tax on Entry of Motor Vehicles into Local
Areas Act, 1990, the vehicle should have been transferred by the petitioner prior to such claim. In
this connection, the learned Government Advocate submits that this Writ Petition is liable to be
dismissed in the light of the decision of the Division Bench of this Court in T.Chitty Babu Vs. Union
of India, rep. by the Secretary, Department of Law and Justice, (2020) 5 MLJ 577.

T.Muthusamy vs The Commercial Tax Officer on 15 December, 2021
7. The learned Government Advocate appearing for the respondent also placed reliance on the latest
decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in ______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
Page No 4 of 14 The Assistant Commissioner of State Tax and Others Vs. M/s. Commercial Steel
Limited, order dated 03.09.2021 in Civil Appeal No.5121 of 2021, wherein, in paragraph No.11, it
was held as follows:-
11.The respondent had a statutory remedy under section 107. Instead of availing of
the remedy, the respondent instituted a petition under Article 226. The existence of
an alternate remedy is not an absolute bar to the maintainability of a writ petition
under Article 226 of the Constitution. But a writ petition can be entertained in
exceptional circumstances where there is:
i. a breach of fundamental rights; ii. a violation of the principles of natural justice;
iii. an excess of jurisdiction; or iv. a challenge to the vires of the statute or delegated
legislation.
8. Heard the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner and the learned Government Advocate
appearing for the respondent. I have perused the impugned order and the provisions of the Tamil
Nadu Tax on Entry of Motor Vehicles into Local Areas Act, 1990 and considered the decision
rendered by the Division Bench of this Court cited by the learned counsel for the petitioner to quash
the impugned order and the decision ______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Page
No 5 of 14 cited by the learned Government Advocate to state that this Writ Petition is liable to be
dismissed on account of the fact that the petitioner has an efficiency remedy.
9. I shall first deal with the second argument of the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner
regarding the expression 'vehicle' as defined in Section 2(i) of the Tamil Nadu Tax on Entry of Motor
Vehicles Act, 1990, as per which, 'motor vehicle' means a 'motor vehicle' as defined in Clause (28) of
Section 2 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.
10. In Bolani Ores Ltd. Vs. Sate of Orissa, (1974) 2 SCC 777, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that
the words “adapted for use” cannot be larger in their import by including vehicles which are not
suitable for use on road.
11. In Rds Projects Limited Vs. Commercial Tax Officer, (2007) VST 574 Mad, the petitioner therein
had purchased Volvo Hydraulic Excavator (Model: EC 210BLC) and Volvo Hydraulic Excavator
(Model:
EC360BLC) against "C" form from M/s. Volvo India Pvt. Ltd. These two
______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Page No 6 of 14 machines
were to be used for the sea protection works along the Ennore expressway in Chennai
and after their purchase, the machines were brought into the State of Tamil Nadu. In
the above case, on facts, the Court concluded that the excavator in question was
mounted on iron plates made into chain such as caterpillar vehicles or military tanks.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43522051/ 3
T.Muthusamy vs The Commercial Tax Officer on 15 December, 2021
Such an excavator was used for excavating the earth and loaded in lorries and it was
held that it cannot be used on public roads, since the roads would get damaged by the
chains. Under those circumstances, the Court held that the Volvo excavators
purchased by the petitioner therein which was the subject to levy of entry tax are
exactly similar to the excavators which were the subject-matter in Intelligence
Officer, Squad No. IV, Kozhikode Vs. Ray Constructions Ltd., (2006) 147 STC 438
and thus allowed the Writ Petition.
12. However, on facts of the present case and a collecting, a reading of the documents filed indicates
that the imported Escorts Crane was registered as a 'motor vehicle' before the Pondicherry Regional
Transport Authority. It was registered as “MMV Hydraulic Mobile Crane” and was registered as PY
01 C 9412 on 21.11.1994. It was initially purchased by ______________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Page No 7 of 14 CRANE OPERATORS and later sold to one
Mr.Shanmugam of M/s.Balagi Agencies and thereafter it was purchased by the petitioner on
03.10.1998.
13. Therefore, the question of treating the Escorts Crane as “MMV Hydraulic Mobile Crane” of
Escorts make purchased by the petitioner cannot be accepted on par with Volvo Hydraulic
Excavator (Model: EC 210BLC) and Volvo Hydraulic Excavator (Model: EC360BLC) as in the case of
Rds Projects Limited Vs. Commercial Tax Officer, (2007) VST 574 Mad. I shall therefore proceed to
examine whether the tax can be levied under Section 3(1) of Tamil Nadu Tax on Entry of Motor
Vehicles into Local Areas Act, 1990.
14. Section 3(1) of the Tamil Nadu Tax on Entry of Motor Vehicles into Local Areas Act, 1990 is the
charging section. It reads as under:-
3. Levy of tax (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, there shall be levied and
collected a tax on the entry of any motor vehicles into any local area for use or sale
______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Page No 8 of 14 therein which
is liable for registration, or for the assignment of a new registration mark, in the State
under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (Central Act 59 of 1988). The rate of tax shall be
at such rate or rates, not exceeding twenty per cent, as may be fixed by the
Government, by notification, on the purchase value of the motor vehicles;
Provided that in respect of any motor vehicle which was registered in any Union Territory or any
other State under the law relating to motor vehicle :-
(a) before the 10th September 1996, no tax shall be levied and collected, if the owner
of such vehicle applies for the assignment of a new registration mark in this State
after a period of fifteen months from the date of its registration;
(b) on or after 10th September 1996, no tax shall be levied and collected, if the owner
of such vehicle applies for the assignment of a new registration mark in this State
after a period of eighteen months from the date of its registration.

Tamil Nadu after a period of 15 or 18 months from the date of its registration, as the case may be, as
per proviso (a) & (b) to Section 3(1) of the Tamil Nadu Tax on Entry of Motor Vehicles into Local

Areas Act, 1990.
16. The preamble to the Act also makes it clear that it was intention of the law makers to not to levy
entry tax on used vehicles which were registered 15/18 months prior to their being imported into the
local areas in Tamil Nadu. The preamble is reproduced below:-
“In order to curb the evasion of sales tax on the sale of motor vehicles which are
purchased outside the State and brought into this State, the Government
______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Page No 11 of 14 have decided
to levy tax on entry of motor vehicles into local areas of this Sate either for use or sale
therein which is liable for registration in the State under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988
(Central Act LIX of 1988). It has also been decided not to levy the tax in respect of
vehicles registered in the Union Territory or in other States fifteen months prior to
registration in the State and necessary provision has been provided for. In the case of
dealers, entry tax shall be leviable on the entry of motor vehicles and tax paid by
them shall be adjusted with the tax payable by them under the Tamil Nadu General
Sales Tax Act, 1959 (Tamil Nadu Act No.1 of 1959).”
17. The vehicle was first registered in the year 1994 in the Union Territory of Pondicherry. It was
imported into the State by the petitioner only during October, 1998. Therefore, the purchase by the
petitioner was beyond the period of 15/18 months after its registration. It was not necessary for the
petitioner to have a prior registration of the vehicles in his own name in the Union Territory of
Pondicherry to claim exemption under proviso (b) to Section 3(1) of the Act. There is no scope to
levy entry tax on the petitioner under proviso (b) to Section 3(1) of the Act on the imported “MMV
Hydraulic Mobile Crane” purchased from a seller in Union Territory of Pondicherry.

Writ Petition stands allowed with consequential relief to the petitioner. No cost.
