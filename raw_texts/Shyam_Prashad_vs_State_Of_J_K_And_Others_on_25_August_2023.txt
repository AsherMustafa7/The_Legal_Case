JUDGMENT
1. The respondent No. 1 had issued SRO No. 233 of 1988, thereby providing the retirement age of a
person appointed to the service of society as 58 years.
2. The petitioner filed the writ petition for directing the respondents not to comply with the SRO No.
233 of 1988 to the employees of the respondent No. 3 and further directing the respondent No. 3 not
to retire the petitioner at the age of 58 years on the ground that the service rules applicable to the
employees of Citizens' Cooperative Bank provide for the retirement of its employees at the age of 60
years.
3. The respondent No. 3 filed response to the writ petition thereby stating that the Division Bench of
this Court in case titled "N. K. Mehta and others Vs. State of J&K and others" reported as 2009 (2)
JKJ 1HC has c/w held that the provisions contained in the SRO 233 of 1988 shall govern the service
conditions of the Cooperative Societies including those of the employer society, as such, the present
petition is not maintainable.
4. Since the dispute in respect of the applicability of SRO 233 of 1988 to the employees of the
co-operative society stood already settled by the judgment of the Division Bench of this Court in "N.
K. Mehta" (supra) as such, the learned counsels for the parties restricted their arguments only in
respect of the payment of salary to the petitioner for a period of two years, for which the petitioner

Shyam Prashad vs State Of J&K And Others on 25 August, 2023
claims to have worked for the respondent No.3 and the respondent No.3 in its turn has denied the
same.
5. This Court while entertaining the writ petition and issuing the notice to the respondents vide
order dated 29.10.2013 directed that the petitioner shall be permitted to continue in the service
beyond 58 years of age at his own risk and responsibility. It was also provided that he shall not be
paid any salary for the said period till the matter is finally considered after the objections are filed by
the respondents.
6. During the pendency of this petition, the petitioner filed an application seeking directions to the
respondents to consider the case of the petitioner for release of his salary as the petitioner had
worked without salary for a period of two years up to the age of superannuation i.e. upto November
2015, on the analogy of Sushma Sharma-Manager, Ashwani Kapoor- Chief Manager and Dhan Dev
Joshi-Manager. This Court vide order dated 15.07.2017 disposed of the said application by directing
the respondents to consider the case of the petitioner on the analogy of case of Sushma c/w
Sharma-Manager, Ashwani Kapoor-Chief Manager and Dhan Dev Joshi- Manager under the rules,
provided that the petitioner is similarly situated person with the said persons.
7. The non-compliance of the order dated 15.07.2017 compelled the petitioner to file the contempt
petition. In response to the contempt petition, the respondent No. 3 filed statement of
facts/compliance report, stating therein that the petitioner was not similarly situated vis-a-vis other
employees on the ground that though the petitioner had marked his attendance, but he did not
actually work in the bank during the period of two years after attaining age of 58 years.
8. From the record, it is evident that Sushma Sharma-Manager and Ashwani Kapoor-Chief Manager
attained superannuation on 31.07.2014 and 30.09.2015 respectively, but they continued to work till
the age of 60 years and they were paid the salary for the period beyond 58 years. Similarly, Dhan
Dev Joshi-Manager whose retirement was due on 28.02.2015 but worked till the age of 60 years. He
too was paid the salary for the said period. The abovementioned officials worked beyond the age of
58 years till 60 years pursuant to intervention of the court.
9. The Division Bench in case titled "N. K. Mehta and others Vs. State of J&K and others" reported
as 2009 (2) JKJ 1 HC has observed as under:
"However, before we conclude, it would be appropriate on our part to state that the
questions raised in the writ petition were, in fact, not covered by the judgments
referred to above and the same were required to be answered independently. We may
further point out that the said rules have made a great departure from what had been
provided in the 1988 rules having granted power to the Co-operative Societies to
frame rules pertaining to service conditions of their employees as part of their
bye-lays. The 1988 rules would become c/w inconsistent with the rules governing
service conditions as and when framed by Co-operative Societies in their bye-laws,
liberty for which has been granted by the said rules. At the same time, there being no
authoritative pronouncement that the rules governing the service conditions made by
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185174220/ 2
Shyam Prashad vs State Of J&K And Others on 25 August, 2023
the societies prior to coming into force of the 1988 rules were repealed by the 1988
rules, the petitioners did have reason to come to this Court to seek continuation of
their service until 60 years and, in the circumstance, though we dismiss the appeal,
but make it clear that the petitioners having rendered service despite having crossed
the age of 58 years on the strength of the orders of this Court, should not be made to
repay any part of their salaries drawn in course thereof."
10. The respondent No. 3 has admitted in its communication dated 05.11.2022 that the petitioner
marked his attendance from 01.11.2013 till 31.10.2015, but at the same time it is mentioned that he
did not actually work in the bank. This Court is at loss to observe that once the attendance of the
petitioner has been marked in the office, then how the respondents can claim that the petitioner did
not work, though attended the office. If it was so, the respondent No.3 could have informed the
Court about the same by laying an appropriate motion before the Court. Having not done so for
seven years after attaining the superannuation by the petitioner, though under Court orders, the
respondents cannot claim that the petitioner did not work in the office. It is apt to mention here that
the response to the writ petition was filed by the respondent in the year 2022. It appears that the
respondent No. 3 has made a lame excuse to deny the salary to the petitioner for a period of two
years for which he worked under the orders of the Court. Though, this Court vide order dated
29.10.2013 had observed that the petitioner would not be given any salary for the period till the
matter is finally considered, but the judgment of Division Bench provides for the payment of salary
to the employees of the c/w Cooperative Societies who have worked till the age of 60 years and also
that the respondent No.3 has paid salary to above mentioned employees. Once, the respondent No.
3 paid the salary to the other employees, who worked under the Court orders as mentioned above,
there appears to be no justification for the respondent No. 3 to deny the similar treatment to the
petitioner. Law is well settled that similarly situated employees are to be treated alike by their
employer. Reliance is placed upon judgment of Hon'ble the Apex Court in case titled State of
Karnataka Vs. C. Lalitha reported as (2006) 2 SCC 747, in which the Apex Court has held as under:
"29. Service jurisprudence evolved by this Court from time to time postulates that all
persons similarly situated should be treated similarly. Only because one person has
approached the court that would not mean that persons similarly situated should be
treated differently. It is furthermore well settled that the question of seniority should
be governed by the rules. It may be true that this Court took notice of the subsequent
events, namely, that in the meantime she had also been promoted as Assistant
Commissioner which was a Category I post but the direction to create a
supernumerary post to adjust her must be held to have been issued only with a view
to accommodate her therein as otherwise she might have been reverted and not for
the purpose of conferring a benefit to which she was not otherwise entitled to."
(emphasis added)
11. Also, in case titled State of U.P. Vs. Arvind Kumar Srivastava reported as (2015) 1 SCC 347, the
Apex Court has held as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185174220/ 3
Shyam Prashad vs State Of J&K And Others on 25 August, 2023
" 22.1. The normal rule is that when a particular set of employees is given relief by the
court, all other identically situated persons need to be treated alike by extending that
benefit. Not doing so would amount to discrimination and would be violative of
Article 14 of the Constitution of India. This principle needs to be applied in service
matters more emphatically as the service jurisprudence evolved by this Court from
time to time postulates that all similarly situated persons should be treated similarly.
Therefore, the normal rule would be that merely because other similarly situated c/w
persons did not approach the Court earlier, they are not to be treated differently.
(emphasis added)
12. In view of the above, this Court is of the considered view that the respondent No. 3 is under
obligation to release the salary of the petitioner for the period of two years with effect from
01.11.2013 to 31.10.2015 and the same be released in favour of the petitioner within a period of three
months from the date certified copy of the order is served upon the respondent No. 3, failing which
the respondent No. 3 shall also pay an interest at the rate of 6 % per annum from 31.10.2015 till its
realization.
13. Disposed of.
14. In view of the order passed in the main petition, the contempt proceedings are closed.
