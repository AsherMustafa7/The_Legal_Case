commencing from 2024-25 to 2026-27 and also to direct the 3 rd respondent to declare the

2. The Writ Petition in W.P.No.35462 of 2024 is filed seeking issue
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.35456 and 35462 of 2024 of Writ of Mandamus,
forbearing the respondents 2 and 3 from awarding any contract or taking any further action

the above mentioned period, till such time as the appeal filed by the petitioner before the 1st
respondent is disposed of in accordance with the Tamil Nadu Transparency in Tenders Act, 1998.
3. The petitioner is a Company carries on business of wholesale and retail trading of Coal and
Energy and export and import of Coal and Energy. The petitioner-company is a 100% subsidiary
company of M/s. PT Bara Daya Energi, Indonesia (hereinafter referred to as 'the Parent Company').
The 2nd Respondent-Corporation issued a notice inviting global tender for supply of specified
quantities of Steam Coal for a period of three years as mentioned above. The petitioner submitted its
bid on the last date 24.10.2024. As Earnest Money Deposit, a sum of Rs.11,00,00,000/- was
deposited by the petitioner as per the tender conditions. The technical bid submitted by the bidders
were opened on 25.10.2024. The petitioner received an email communication on 15.11.2024 from
the 3rd respondent https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.35456 and 35462 of 2024 informing
the petitioner-company that its bid was rejected during the technical evaluation by the duly
constituted committee for the reasons Bid Qualification Requirements (hereinafter referred to as
'BQR') was not satisfied.
4. The Clause 7.0 of tender condition speaks about BQR and as per the same, the tenderers should
possess the following qualifications:-
(i) Tenderer should have imported and supplied 1.25 Lakh Tonnes of imported steam
coal in each of the preceding FIVE financial years (2019-20, 2020-21, 2021-22,
2022-23 and 2023-24) to any of the Public Power Utilities and/or Public industrial
units in India and 5 Lakh Tonnes of imported steam coal of any origin in any one of
the said Five financial years to any of the Public Power Utilities and/or Public
industrial units in India.

and 35462 of 2024 origin, the tenderer proposes to source the supply, as per the
format attached (Schedule-G-FORMAT FOR THE LETTER FROM THE MINE
OWNER).
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/196237494/ 3
M/S.Pt.Bara Daya Energi India Private ... vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 20 December, 2024
(iv) The offers not satisfying the Bid Qualification Requirements will be summarily
rejected.
5. It is stated by the petitioner that it submitted necessary documents showing the experience of
importing steam coal of its parent company namely M/s. PT Bara Daya Energi, Indonesia. The
parent company of petitioner successfully completed the project of import and supply of steam coal
of Indonesian Origin to TANGEDCO for the financial years 2019-20, 2020-21, 2022-23 and
2023-24. The End User Certificate dated 03.08.2024 issued by the 3rd respondent was also
enclosed along with the bid. Thus, the petitioner participated in the bid on the strength of the
experience of its parent company as petitioner is the 100% subsidiary of its parent company.
6. When the petitioner sought for the clarification from the respondents 2 and 3 regarding the
rejection of its bid, it was informed that experience conditions as stipulated in BQR has not been
satisfied by the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.35456 and 35462 of 2024 petitioner. It is
stated that the experience gained by the parent company of the petitioner can be taken into
consideration as per the law settled by the Apex Court in catena of decisions and therefore, the
rejection by the respondents 2 and 3 is not in accordance with law. The petitioner filed an appeal
before the 1st respondent under Section 11 of Tamil Nadu Transparency in Tenders Act, 1998 on
18.11.2024 and the same was not taken up for consideration. However, the 3rd respondent
proceeded further and also conducted reverse auction on 18.11.2024. In these circumstances, left
with no other alternative remedy, the petitioner has knocked the doors of this Court with the above
mentioned prayers.
7. In W.P.No.35462 of 2024, the petitioner sought for prohibitory orders, as mentioned above, since
petitioner's appeal before the 1st respondent was not taken up for consideration and the
respondents 2 and 3 are proceeding with the further tender process including the reverse auction.
8. The 3rd respondent filed a counter affidavit denying various averments found in the writ affidavit.
It is the specific case of the 3 rd respondent that as per Clause 7 (h) of the Section II of Tender
Conditions, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.35456 and 35462 of 2024 the bid submitted
by the tenderer is liable to be rejected, if any of the contracts awarded to the Bidder for the supply of
imported coal had been terminated. A contract awarded to the petitioner's parent company M/s. PT
Bara Daya Energi, Indonesia, was terminated by M/s.Gujarat State Electricity Corporation Ltd., in a
contract for the supply of imported coal and therefore, by invoking Clause 7(h) of Tender
Conditions, the bid submitted by the petitioner was rejected, as it failed to satisfy BQR conditions. It
is also stated by the 3rd respondent that during evaluation of Techno-Commercial bids submitted by
the bidders, it was found that the petitioner failed to satisfy the Bid Qualification Requirements
specified in the tender conditions and the same was uploaded in the e-procurement portal. As a
consequence, the petitioner had received a computer generated message informing it about the
rejection of its tender for failure to satisfy the BQR. The email communication sent to the petitioner
cannot be treated as an order of rejection of the tender. Only after evaluation of financial bid and
awarding of the tender to the successful bidder, the Tender Accepting Authority is permitted to issue
the order of rejection along with its reasons to the unsuccessful bidders as per Section 10(7) of the
Tamil Nadu Transparency in Tenders Act, 1998. Therefore, the writ petitions filed by the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/196237494/ 4
M/S.Pt.Bara Daya Energi India Private ... vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 20 December, 2024
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.35456 and 35462 of 2024 petitioner are pre-matured
and consequently, liable to be dismissed. It is also stated by the 3rd respondent that during pre-bid
query, the petitioner requested the 3rd respondent to relax Clause 7(h) of the tender conditions and
the same was rejected by the 3rd respondent.
9. Mr.Vijay Narayan, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner submitted that the
petitioner is entitled to take advantage of the credentials of its parent company namely M/s. PT Bara
Daya Energi, Indonesia, as it possess sufficient experience in importing steam coal for last 5
preceding years. In support of the said contention, the learned Senior Counsel relied on judgment of
Apex Court in New Horizons Ltd vs. Union of India reported in (1995) 1 SCC 478 and Consortium of
Titagrah Firema Adler S.P.A. vs. Nagpur Metro Rail Corporation Limited reported in (2017) 7 SCC
486.
10. The learned Senior Counsel further submitted that while subsidiary company is entitled to take
advantage of the experience of the parent company, being a separate legal entity, any
disqualifications or stigma attached to the parent company will not affect the subsidiary
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.35456 and 35462 of 2024 company. The learned Senior
Counsel by taking this Court to Clause 7(h) of Tender Conditions submitted that only in cases where
the contracts awarded to the bidder had been terminated earlier, the respondents can invoke Clause
7(h) and reject the tender.
11. He further submitted that in the case on hand, no contract awarded to the petitioner-bidder had
been terminated earlier and termination of contract awarded to petitioner's parent company will not
affect the petitioner's qualification in the absence of anything to suggest in the tender conditions,
the word 'bidder' mentioned therein will include the bidder's associate companies. The learned
Senior Counsel further submitted that when petitioner's bid for supply of coal to Karnataka Power
Corporation Limited was rejected citing the termination of contract awarded to the petitioner's
parent company, the same was challenged by the petitioner before the Karnataka High Court in M/s.
PT. Bara Daya Energi India Private Limited vs. State of Karnataka and another reported in
2024:KHC:3759 and the Karnataka High Court held that termination or blacklisting of parent
company would not affect its subsidiary. Therefore, it is the submission of the learned Senior
Counsel that termination of contract https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.35456 and 35462 of
2024 as against the parent company of the petitioner will not affect its subsidiary namely the
petitioner. He further submitted that penal clause in the tender conditions should be strictly
construed in the absence of any express provision in the tender conditions so as to include the
parent companies of the bidder in Clause 7(h), the same cannot be interpreted liberally so as to
include the parent company.
12. The learned Senior Counsel further submitted that there was default on the part of the
petitioner's parent company during covid period in meeting the supply commitments due to
intervention of force majeure and termination of contract by M/s. Gujarat State Electricity
Corporation Ltd., is a subject matter of arbitration. It is also submitted that petitioner invoked
arbitration clause and filed Section 11 petition before the Gujarat High Court and the same is still
pending.

M/S.Pt.Bara Daya Energi India Private ... vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 20 December, 2024
13. Per contra, Mr.P.S.Raman, the learned Advocate General appearing for the respondents 2 and 3
submitted that when the petitioner counts the experience of the parent company in order to satisfy
the qualification criteria, any disqualification suffered by the petitioner's parent
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.35456 and 35462 of 2024 company will also affect the
petitioner. The learned Advocate General further submitted that the petitioner being a subsidiary
company is entirely dependent on the parent company for its very qualification and hence, it cannot
claim that disqualification of the parent company will not affect its bid as it is a distinct juridical
entity.
14. It is submitted that in order to satisfy BQR, the petitioner relies on the credentials of its parent
company. On the other hand, in order to escape the disqualifications suffered by the parent
company, the petitioner contends that it is a separate legal entity and therefore, disqualification of
the parent company will not affect its bid and the same is illogical and untenable in law. The learned
Advocate General further submitted that Maharashtra State Power Generation Co., Ltd., rejected the
similar bid of the petitioner citing the termination order passed by M/s. Gujarat State Electricity
Corporation Ltd., against its parent company. The said rejection order was tested by the petitioner
before the Bombay High Court in Writ Petition (L) No.12123 of 2023. The Division Bench of
Bombay High Court upheld the rejection order against the petitioner. The said order passed by
Division Bench of Bombay High Court was affirmed by the Apex Court in S.L.P.(C).No.10610 of
2023. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.35456 and 35462 of 2024 Therefore, it is the
submission of the learned Advocate General that disqualification of the parent company will
certainly affect the qualification of the petitioner which is a subsidiary. The learned Advocate
General also submitted that as per Section 10(7) of the Tamil Nadu Transparency in Tenders Act,
1998, the reason for rejection of bid will be communicated to the unsuccessful bidders only after
completion of tender evaluation process and awarding of the contract. The aggrieved unsuccessful
bidders are entitled to file an appeal under Section 11 of the said Act. During the tender evaluating
process before passing of final order, the bidders are not entitled to challenge the tender process at
each and every stage and stall the same. In support of the said contention, he also relied on the
judgment of Apex Court in National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited vs. Montecarlo Limited
and another reported in (2022) 6 SCC 401.
15. The learned Advocate General also relied on the judgment of the Apex Court in Silppi
Constructions Contractors vs. Union of India and another reported in (2020) 16 SCC 489 for the
proposition, the Tender Authority need not give reasons at every stage and the reasons for rejection
can be given finally or even at the time of filing counter affidavit. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos.35456 and 35462 of 2024
16. In the light of the submission made by the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner
and the learned Advocate General appearing for the respondents, the main core issue to be decided
in this writ petition is whether the disqualification suffered by the petitioner's parent company will
affect petitioner's bid or not?
17. It is not in dispute that for the purpose of satisfying Bid Qualification Requirements (BQR), the
petitioner is relying on the credentials of its parent company. The petitioner's parent company
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/196237494/ 6
M/S.Pt.Bara Daya Energi India Private ... vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 20 December, 2024
imported coal and supplied it to TANGEDCO during 5 previous years and in order to satisfy the
Clause 7 (i) and (ii) of the Tender Conditions, which deals with BQR, the petitioner relied on the
credentials of the parent company. No doubt, the petitioner being a 100% owned subsidiary of its
parent company is entitled to use the credentials of its parent company for the purpose of satisfying
BQR as per the law settled by Apex Court in New Horizons Ltd vs. Union of India reported in (1995)
1 SCC 478 cited supra. The respondents have no quarrel about the said position.
18. As seen from the counter affidavit filed by the 3rd respondent, the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.35456 and 35462 of 2024 bid submitted by the
petitioner was rejected during technical evaluation only on the ground that contract awarded to
petitioner's parent company was terminated by the M/s. Gujarat State Electricity Corporation Ltd.
The Clause-7 (iii) of the Tender Conditions, which deals about BQR, reads as follows:-
“The tenderers should have a valid tie-up with mine owners till the completion of the
contract period which should be evidenced by a support letter in Original 10 from the
mine owner for each country of origin, the tenderer proposes to source the supply, as
per the format attached (Schedule-G- FORMAT FOR THE LETTER FROM THE
MINE OWNER).”
19. Therefore, the tender should have a valid tie-up with the mine owners for sourcing their supply.
In order to satisfy the above said clause of tender conditions, petitioner submitted a letter from
parent company which owns coal mines in Indonesia as per the format in Form Schedule-G to the
tender conditions. The letter from Mine owner reads as follows:-
“We,_(Name of Manufacturer / Mine Owner) established and reputed manufacturers producers of
Steam Coal having factories / mines at_ (Name of the place) hereby authorize ________ (Name of
the Bidder) to bid, negotiate and https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.35456 and 35462 of
2024 conclude the contract with TNPGCL for the quantity and quality against your Tender No.for
the Steam Coalmined/explored by us.”
20. When a specific question was addressed to the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the
petitioner during arguments, as to the source of supply for the petitioner, he submitted that the
petitioner's parent company owns Coal Mines in Indonesia, which produces high quality coals. The
supply to the respondents will be made by the petitioner from coal mines of petitioner's parent
company and letter from parent company is submitted as per Schedule-G to the Tender Conditions.
The said submission made by the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner was also
accepted by the learned Advocate General appearing for the respondents 2 and 3. Therefore, it is
agreed by both the counsel that petitioner submitted a letter from its parent company M/s. PT Bara
Daya Energi, Indonesia under Form Schedule-G wherein parent company authorised the petitioner
to conclude contract with respondents for supply of Steam Coal Mined/Explored by it. Therefore, it
is clear that petitioner's source for supply of coal as per the bid submitted by it, is the coal extracted
from mines of petitioner's parent https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.35456 and 35462 of
2024 company. It is not the case of the petitioner that it is sourcing its supply from a third party
other than the parent company. Therefore, the credentials of the parent company in adhering to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/196237494/ 7
M/S.Pt.Bara Daya Energi India Private ... vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 20 December, 2024
contract for supply of coal is very much relevant in the facts of the present case. Any default
committed by the petitioner's parent company to supply of coal can very well be taken into
consideration while considering the bid submitted by its 100% owned subsidiary namely the
petitioner. The main reason would be the petitioner has no other source of supply except supply
from the parent company mines. Though there is considerable force in the submission made by the
learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner that the subsidiary company is a separate legal
entity and hence, in the absence of anything contrary in the tender conditions to suggest the
expression 'bidder' would include it's affiliate companies, the termination of contract against
parent/affiliate company would not affect the bid of the subsidiary company, in the peculiar facts
narrated above, when the petitioner solely depends on its parent company for supply of coal, the
respondents are entitled to take into consideration the default committed by parent company and
the termination of contract awarded to the petitioner's parent company while evaluating the
petitioner's technical bid, as the petitioner is a 100% owned https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos.35456 and 35462 of 2024 subsidiary of its parent company.
21. As per the letter submitted by the petitioner in Form Schedule-G, it depends solely on the coal
supply by its parent company to discharge the supply obligations. Therefore, any default committed
by the parent company in earlier occasion can be certainly taken into consideration. The petitioner
on its own does not satisfy the qualification criteria and admittedly, it relies on credentials of its
parent company for the purpose of satisfying BQR and in such circumstances, when it comes to the
disqualification or default on the part of the parent company, the fully owned subsidiary cannot turn
around and say the disqualifications of parent company will not affect its bid. When the petitioner
solely relies on the credentials of the parent company to satisfy all the Bid Qualification
Requirements, it should also take the burden of disqualification attached to the parent company. In
the peculiar facts of this case, wherein, the petitioner solely depends on parent company for supply
of coal, the corporate veil can be lifted and the disqualifications suffered by the parent company can
be taken into consideration.
22. The Karnataka High Court in M/s. PT. Bara Daya Energi India https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos.35456 and 35462 of 2024 Private Limited vs. State of Karnataka and another reported in
2024:KHC:3759, while considering the similar case filed by the petitioner observed as follows:-
“11. It is too well settled principle of law that experience gained by the company to
which any company is subsidiary can be taken into consideration for the purpose of
experience or eligibility of a tenderer, be it the company or its subsidiary. Insofar as
the penal provisions are concerned, the subsidiary has nothing to do with the
termination or blacklisting of any company as the penal provisions are invoked qua
the said company and not every of its subsidiary. ... ... ... ...”
23. Though as held by the Karnataka High Court the experience gained by the parent company can
be taken into consideration while considering the bids submitted by its subsidiary company is very
well settled as per the decisions of the Apex Court in New Horizons Ltd vs. Union of India reported
in (1995) 1 SCC 478 and Consortium of Titagrah Firema Adler S.P.A. vs. Nagpur Metro Rail
Corporation Limited reported in (2017) 7 SCC 486, insofar as effect of disqualifications suffered by
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/196237494/ 8
M/S.Pt.Bara Daya Energi India Private ... vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 20 December, 2024
the parent company on the subsidiary company's bid is concerned, no
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.35456 and 35462 of 2024 case laws have been cited
before me, even in the judgment of the Karnataka High Court cited supra, no earlier decisions
regarding the effect of parent company's disqualification on the subsidiary company had been
discussed.
24. In State of U.P. and others vs. Renusagar Power Co. and others, reported in (1988) 4 SCC 59, the
Apex Court while dealing with doctrine of lifting of corporate veil observed as follows:-
“66. It is high time to reiterate that in the expanding horizon of modern
jurisprudence, lifting of corporate veil is permissible. Its frontiers are unlimited. It
must, however, depend primarily on the realities of the situation. The aim of the
legislation is to do justice to all the parties. The horizon of the doctrine of lifting of
corporate veil is expanding. Here, indubitably, we are of the opinion that it is correct
that Renusagar was brought into existence by Hindalco in order to fulfil the condition
of industrial licence of Hindalco through production of aluminium. It is also manifest
from the facts that the model of the setting up of power station through the agency of
Renusagar was adopted by Hindalco to avoid complications in case of take over of the
power station by the State or the Electricity Board. As the facts make it abundantly
clear that all https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.35456 and 35462 of 2024
the steps for establishing and expanding the power station were taken by Hindalco,
Renusagar is wholly-owned subsidiary of Hindalco and is completely controlled by
Hindalco. Even the day-to-day affairs of Renusagar are controlled by Hindalco.
Renusagar has at no point of time indicated any independent volition. Whenever felt
necessary, the State or the Board have themselves lifted the corporate veil and have
treated Renusagar and Hindalco as one concern and the generation in Renusagar as
the own source of generation of Hindalco. In the impugned order the profits of
Renusagar have been treated as the profits of Hindalco.
67. In the aforesaid view of the matter we are of the opinion that the corporate veil
should be lifted and Hindalco and Renusagar be treated as one concern and
Renusagar's power plant must be treated as the own source of generation of Hindalco
and should be liable to duty on that basis. In the premises the consumption of such
energy by Hindalco will fall under Section 3(1)(c) of the Act. The learned Additional
Advocate-General for the State relied on several decisions, some of which have been
noted.
68. The veil on corporate personality even though not lifted sometimes, is becoming
more and more transparent in modern company jurisprudence. The ghost of
Salomon's case https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.35456 and 35462 of 2024
still visits frequently the hounds of Company Law but the veil has been pierced in
many cases. Some of these have been noted by Justice P.B. Mukharji in the New
Jurisprudence.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/196237494/ 9
M/S.Pt.Bara Daya Energi India Private ... vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 20 December, 2024
69. It appears to us, however, that as mentioned the concept of lifting the corporate
veil is a changing concept and is of expanding horizons. We think that the appellant
was in error in not treating Renusagar's power plant as the power plant of Hindalco
and not treating it as the own source of energy. The respondent is liable to duty on
the same and on that footing alone; this is evident in view of the principles
enunciated and the doctrine now established by way of decision of this Court in Life
Insurance Corporation of India, (supra) that in the facts of this case Sections 3(1)(c)
and 4(1)(c) of the Act are to be interpreted accordingly. The persons generating and
consuming energy were the same and the corporate veil should be lifted. In the facts
of this case Hindalco and Renusagar were inextricably linked up together.
Renusagar had in reality no separate and independent existence apart from and independent of
Hindalco.”
25. In the facts of the present case, the petitioner is 100% subsidiary of its parent company. For the
purpose of satisfying the Bid Qualification Requirements, the petitioner is solely relying on the
credentials of its parent https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.35456 and 35462 of 2024
company. For the purpose of supplying coal as per the tender condition, the petitioner is solely
relying on the supply of coal from the parent company's coal mines as evidenced by the letter
submitted by the petitioner in Schedule-G. In the light of these facts, this Court finds that there is
force in the submission made by the respondents 2 and 3 that petitioner company was floated by its
parent holding company as 100% owned subsidiary just to over come the illeffect of termination
order.
26. In these circumstances, both the petitioner and its parent company are closely connected with
each other and disqualification suffered by the parent company will certainly affect the petitioner's
bid. The respondents are entitled to lift the corporate veil and take into consideration the
termination of contract as against the parent company while evaluating the petitioner's bid.
27. In view of the peculiar facts of this case, which established the close connection between the
parent company and the petitioner, I prefer to differ with the view expressed by the Karnataka High
Court in M/s. PT. Bara Daya Energi India Private Limited vs. State of Karnataka and
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.35456 and 35462 of 2024 another reported in
2024:KHC:3759. Therefore, I hold the respondents 2 and 3 are justified in invoking Clause-7 (h) of
the tender conditions to reject the technical bid of the petitioner.
28. The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner orally submitted that the contract
awarded to the petitioner's parent company was terminated during covid period and the default
committed by the petitioner's parent company was due to the intervention of force majeure and
therefore, disqualification suffered by the petitioner's parent company at the time of covid should
not be put against the subsidiary company namely the petitioner. As observed by the Division Bench
of Bombay High Court in Pt.Bara Daya Energi vs. Maharashtra State Power Generation Co. Ltd., in
Writ Petition (L) No.12123 of 2023, the termination of contract against the petitioner's parent
company was subject matter of arbitration. Therefore, at this stage, this Court is not inclined to

M/S.Pt.Bara Daya Energi India Private ... vs The Government Of Tamil Nadu on 20 December, 2024
venture into the question as to the reasons for the default committed by the petitioner's parent
company, especially when there is no averments regarding said fact in the writ affidavit.
29. In view of the above discussion, the petitioner has not made out
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos.35456 and 35462 of 2024 any case for issuance of writ as
prayed for and accordingly, these Writ Petitions are dismissed. No costs. Consequently, the
connected writ miscellaneous petitions are closed.
