Naipal Singh And Another vs Addl. Commissioner (Judicial) Ayodhya ... on 28 March, 2025
Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950 Naipal Singh & others versus Tribhuvan Singh
& others, in the interest of justice."
Taking note of para 458(2) of U.P. Revenue Court Manual, as per which, an appeal or revision
should preferably be decided within a period of six months, however, in the instant case, the appeal
is pending since August, 2024 and on account of pendency of the same, the petitioners, as stated,
are suffering great hardship and mental agony, this Court is of the view that no fruitful purpose will
be served in keeping this petition pending.
Accordingly, this petition is disposed of with a direction to the respondent No.1/Additional
Commissioner (Judicial), Ayodhya Mandal, Ayodhya to consider and decide the Case No.
1926/2024 (Naipal Singh & others versus Tribhuvan Singh & others) most expeditiously after
affording full opportunity of hearing to the parties to the litigation and without granting
unnecessary adjournment to either party preferably within a period of six months from the next date
fixed in the case, if there is no other legal impediment in this regard.
It is made clear that the Court has not examined the case of either party on merits and the Authority
concerned shall be free to decide the matter strictly in accordance with law.
With the aforesaid, the petition is disposed of.
