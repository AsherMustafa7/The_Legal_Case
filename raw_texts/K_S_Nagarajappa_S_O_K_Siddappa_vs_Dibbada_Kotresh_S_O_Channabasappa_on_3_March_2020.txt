JUDGMENT
This is complainant's appeal against the judgment and order passed by the trial Court acquitting the
accused/respondent of an offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I. Act, 1881 ('N.I. Act' for
short).
2. Heard the learned counsel appearing for the appellant/complainant and the learned counsel
appearing for the respondent/accused.
3. The case of the complainant is that he is running dalali mandi business at APMC Yard,
Davanagere dealing as commission agency for agricultural produce brought by the agriculturist to
his shop. The accused is an agriculturist having agricultural land at Chikkabidari Village. For the
maintenance of his agricultural land, the accused used to borrow money from the complainant for
purchase of seeds, manure, pesticides and also for purchase of tractor, reimbursement of tractor
loan, agricultural implements, for improvement of his land etc. There was a balance of
Rs.5,25,000/- which was due from the accused as per ledger balance dated 24.05.2006. When the
complainant demanded for payment of the outstanding debt, which was not cleared by the accused
inspite of stipulated period, and on demand, the accused started dragging the matter and finally
towards payment of the said debt, the accused issued a cheque bearing No.0222 dated 24.05.2006,
for a sum of Rs.5,25,000/-, drawn on Jilla Valmiki Girijana Pattina Sahakara Sangha Ltd.,
Davanagere through account No.125 and requested the complainant to present the cheque for
encashment. Accordingly, when the said cheque was presented for encashment by the complainant
through his collecting banker, Bapuji Co-operative Bank Ltd., HMR Branch, Davanagere on
24.05.2006, the said cheque was returned with an endorsement "Insufficient Fund". A legal notice
dated 05.06.2006 was issued to the accused under certificate of posting and also by registered post
with acknowledgment due. However, the accused failed to reply to the notice and failed to pay the
amount mentioned in the cheque within the stipulated time. Hence, the accused committed an
offence punishable under Section 138 read with Section 142 of the Act.
4. Before the trial Court, the complainant got examined himself as PW.1 and got marked Exs.P1 to
P6. The accused got examined as DW.1 and got marked Exs.D1 to D7.
5. The trial Court after considering the oral and documentary evidence, acquitted the accused.
Aggrieved by which, the present appeal is preferred.
6. The learned counsel appearing for the appellant has vehemently contended that the issuance of
cheque and the signature on it has not been disputed by the accused. As such, the trial Court ought
to have drawn a legal presumption in favour of the complainant. The accused has failed to rebut the
presumption by adducing any cogent evidence. The appellant has proved the existence of debt,
issuance of cheque, dishonouring of cheque in question for insufficient amount. The accused has
also failed to reply to the legal notice and failed to honor the cheque by making the payment
mentioned therein within the stipulated time. Hence, all the ingredients of Section 138 of N.I. Act
has been fulfilled and inspite of that the trial Court on an erroneous consideration acquitted the

accused. The learned counsel contends that the reasons assigned by the trial Court are not in
accordance with law. Accordingly, he seeks to allow the appeal.
7. Per contra, the learned counsel appearing for the respondent contends that the accused has not
disputed the issuance of cheque and also the signature on Ex.P1. However there was no outstanding
dues of Rs.5,25,000/- as alleged by the complainant. Though the accused was borrowing about
Rs.30,000/- from the complainant once in every six months for the purpose of purchasing
pesticides, seeds and manure etc., for agricultural operations, the accused was clearing the said loan
by selling the paddy crops. In the year 1992 due to flood in the Thungabhadra river, the crop
cultivated by the accused was destroyed. Hence, he could not clear the loan borrowed from the
complainant during that time and he was due only a sum of Rs.24,800/- to the complainant. In this
regard, the complainant persuaded the accused to open an account in Jilla Valmiki Girijana Pattina
Sahakara Sangha Ltd., Davanagere and obtained a signed blank cheque from him as security which
was later presented to the bank by the complainant by filling the amount. The learned counsel
contends that the complainant has not at all established that a sum of Rs.5,25,000/- was due from
the accused as on 24.05.2006. No documents are produced by the complainant to establish the
same. He submits that the trial Court having meticulously examined the entire evidence and
material on record has rightly acquitted the accused. Accordingly, he seeks to dismiss the appeal.
8. The complainant has got examined himself as PW1. He has reiterated the complaint averments.
According to him for the maintenance of his agricultural land, accused used to borrow loan from
him and there was a balance of Rs.5,25,000/- as per ledger balance dated 24.05.2006. In this
connection, the accused issued a cheque which was dishonored.
9. Accused has not disputed that Ex.P1-cheque does not belong to him. He has also not disputed the
signature found in the cheque. However, it is the specific case of the accused that he was due only a
sum of Rs.24,800/- and when he requested the complainant to receive the said amount without
interest the complainant did not agree. The settlement also did not work out. Thereafter the
complainant by persuading him, took him to Jilla Valmiki Girijana Pattina Sahakara Sangha Ltd.,
wherein the complainant was a former Director and he succeeded in opening a savings bank account
in the name of accused and thereafter took the signed blank cheque promising that he will keep the
said cheque for the purpose of security.
10. The complainant has disputed the defence taken by the accused. However, as noted supra it is
the specific case of the complainant that the accused was due a sum of Rs.5,25,000/- as per the
ledger balance dated 24.05.2006. To show that as on the said date the outstanding amount was
Rs.5,25,000/-, complainant has not produced any document. It is not the case of the complainant
that the accused borrowed a sum of Rs.5,25,000/-. On the other hand it is his case that over a period
of time, the accused borrowed the amount and there was a balance of Rs.5,25,000/- as on
24.05.2006. When such is the case, it is for the complainant to convincingly establish that the
amount due as on 24.05.2006 as per the ledger maintained by him was Rs.5,25,000/-. Though the
complainant has stated that he has maintained the ledger, he has failed to produce the same before
the trial Court. In such a circumstance, the defence taken by the accused that the cheque in question
was received by the complainant as a security appears probable. The complainant has failed to prove

that the accused was due a sum of Rs.5,25,000/- as on 24.05.2006. From the evidence on record it
cannot be said that Ex.P1-cheque was issued by the accused in discharge of a legally recoverable
debt.
11. The trial Court has considered the evidence adduced by both the parties and held that the
complainant has failed to prove the cheque-Ex.P1 was issued by the accused towards discharge of
his outstanding dues. The reasons assigned by the trial Court cannot be said to be either perverse or
illegal. There is no merit in the appeal.
Hence, the following;
ORDER Appeal is dismissed.
