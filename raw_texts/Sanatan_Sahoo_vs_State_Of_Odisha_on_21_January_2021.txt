Sanatan Sahoo ... Appellant
-VERSUS-
State of Odisha ... Respondent
I.A. No. 687 of 2020
13. 21.01.2021 This matter is taken up through Video
Conferencing.
This is an application for grant of bail.
Heard learned counsel for the appellant and
learned counsel for the State.
It appears that the earlier bail application of
the petitioner in I.A. No.964 of 2018 has been disposed
of by Hon'ble Justice B.P. Routray on 26.02.2020.
In a Three Judge Bench decision of
Jharkhand High Court in case of Lurdhu Marandi -Vrs-
The State of Jharkhand reported in 2015 Criminal
Law Journal 1541 in Paragraph 26, it has been held as
follows:-
"26. We, accordingly, answer to the
aforesaid two questions formulated by us
in paragraph 3 as under:-
(a) When a first application is
preferred under Section 389(1) of the
Code for suspension of substantive
sentence by the accused/convict and
considered by a Division Bench and faced
rejection, the second application or for
that matter successive application(s) for
the same relief shall be heard by the
same Division, who has rejected the
earlier bail application and not before the
Bench which has been given the roster to

deal with such matters.
(b) After the first application for
suspension of sentence preferred under
Section 389(1) of the Code has been
rejected by a Bench and if one of the
Members of the Bench is available, the
subsequent bail application shall be listed
before a Bench of which he is a Member
and it should not go before the regular
Bench as per the roster. It is only in
exceptional circumstances, such bail
application(s) shall go before the regular
Bench as per roster.
However, the situation would be
different in cases of applications under
Section 389 (1) of the Code to be dealt
by Single Bench after once being
rejected. If the same Bench is available,
undoubtedly, it shall be heard by the
same Bench and in the event of the
Bench being not available on account of
transfer, retirement, etc. or for any other
exceptional circumstance; the said
application shall be put up before the
regular Single Bench, as per roster. "
In view of the aforesaid observation of the
Jharkhand High Court, the matter may be placed
before the Hon'ble Chief Justice to place it before
appropriate Bench.
The learned counsel for petitioner shall
supply the deposition copies of all the witnesses
examined in the learned trial Court to the learned
counsel for the State.
