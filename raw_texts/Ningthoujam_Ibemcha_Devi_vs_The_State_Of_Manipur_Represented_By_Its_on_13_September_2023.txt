Ningthoujam Ibemcha Devi vs The State Of Manipur Represented By Its ... on 13 September, 2023
[4] Mr. N. Ibotombi, learned senior counsel for the appellant, submits that she has filed writ petition
being W.P. (C) No. 603 of 2023 with an interim prayer to pass an order not to make finalization of
the absorption of other incumbents or not to apply clause 7 of the impugned notification dated
07.03.2019 in the case of the petitioner/appellant. It is stated that the Commissioner (Hr. & Tech.
Edn.), Government of Manipur issued an order dated 07.03.2019 with respect to taking over of
6(six) Aided Colleges including Biramangol College, Sawombung, wherein the appellant has been
serving as Assistant Professor since 1997 in Geography Department. By the said order, the Governor
of Manipur was pleased to appoint 478 teaching and 163 non-teaching employees of the erstwhile
aforesaid 6 Aided Colleges into Government Service w.e.f. 22.02.2019 subject to the condition that
their final absorption into respective grades of the concerned Government posts would be made in
accordance with the recommendation of the MPSC W.A. No. 64 of 2023 with MC(W.A.) No. 118 of
2023 Page 3 pertaining to the suitability of the appointments, service conditions and inter-
se-seniority in the concerned grades. In para 7 of the order dated 07.03.2019, it is stated that they
shall remain at their respective place of posting until further orders. In terms of the order dated
07.03.2019, the Principal of Biramangol College, Sawombung, submitted the list of Staffs of
Biramangol College, Sawombung, for final absorption to the authority by a communication dated
27.01.2020 wherein the name of the writ petitioner/appellant appears at Sl. No. 28. Thereafter, the
appellant was transferred and posted by an order dated 05.07.2021 from Biramangol College,
Sawombung and she challenged the same by filing writ petition being W.P. (C) No. 572 of 2021 for
staying the operation of the transfer order dated 05.07.2021 invoking clause 7 of the order dated
07.03.2019. During the pendency of the writ petition being W.P. (C) No. 572 of 2021, the
appellant/petitioner was transferred and posted vide another order dated 09.12.2022. The writ
petitioner was transferred and posted at N.G. College, Lamphelpat. In view of the subsequent
development, vide order dated 16.02.2023, the writ petition was dismissed as withdrawn with
liberty to file a fresh one, if so advised. The appellant/writ petitioner learnt from reliable source that
the State Authorities is resorting to clause 7 of the impugned order dated 07.03.2019 for dropping
the name of the petitioner from the list of Staff of Biramangol College, Sawombung before
forwarding to MPSC for recommendation. Then the appellant/writ petitioner filed another writ
petition being W.P. (C) No. 603 of 2023 inter alia praying for quashing clause 7 of the impugned
order dated 07.03.2019 which provides that the W.A. No. 64 of 2023 with MC(W.A.) No. 118 of
2023 Page 4 incumbent shall remain posted at respective place of posting until further orders. Vide
order dated 28.08.2023, learned Single Judge issued notice to the writ petition, returnable on
27.09.2023 and observed that pendency of the writ petition shall not bar the respondents from
considering and disposing of the representation submitted by the petitioner. The appellant
submitted a representation dated 21.08.2023 to the Commissioner (Higher and Tech. Education),
Government of Manipur, requesting to transfer and posting back her to the original college,
Biramangol College, Sawombung so as to avoid complicacy due to the existence of clause 7 of the
order dated 07.03.2019 and the representation is still pending before the authority. Being aggrieved
by the impugned order dated 28.08.2023, the appellant filed the present appeal amongst on the
ground that without any interim order, the case of the appellant will remain unattended and it may
take longer time in getting her case of final absorption to be considered by the authority. It is prayed
to quash and set aside the aggrieved portion of the impugned order dated 28.08.2023 to the extent
that the pendency of the writ petition shall not bar the respondents from considering and disposing
of the representation submitted by appellant.

Ningthoujam Ibemcha Devi vs The State Of Manipur Represented By Its ... on 13 September, 2023
Prayer in the writ appeal is reproduced below:
i) to admit this Writ Appeal and call for records;
ii) to quash and set aside the aggrieved portion of the impugned
order to the extent that the pendency of the Writ Petition shall not bar the respondents from
considering and disposing the representation submitted by the appellant.
iii) to grant the interim order to the extent that not to make finalization of absorption of other
incumbents or not to apply W.A. No. 64 of 2023 with MC(W.A.) No. 118 of 2023 Page 5 clause 7 of
the impugned order in writ petition in case of the appellant.
iv) to pass any appropriate order & direction which the Hon'ble Court may deem fit & proper to
meet ends of justice.
[5] Mr. N. Ibotombi, learned senior counsel for the appellant, submits that the aggrieved portion of
the impugned order be set-aside and this Court may pass appropriate interim order and the writ
appeal may be disposed of at the motion stage.
[6] Mr. Kh. Athouba, learned GA for the State; and Ms. O. Momota, learned counsel for the MPSC,
submit that the present appeal is not maintainable as the impugned order dated 28.08.2023 is not
an appealable order as nothing adverse is held against the petitioner. In fact, the impugned order is
in favour of the appellant and the learned Single Judge issued notice to the respondents and gave
liberty to the respondents for disposing the representation submitted by the petitioner
notwithstanding the pendency of the writ petition. It is prayed that the writ appeal be dismissed as
the same is not maintainable in the present form.
[7] We have heard the learned counsel for the parties. On bare perusal of the impugned order dated
28.08.2023 passed by the learned Single Judge in W.P. (C) No. 603 of 2023, this Court does not
find anything against the appellant/petitioner, rather the order is in her favour. Notice was issued to
the respondents, returnable on 27.09.2023 and it was also observed that pendency of the writ
petition would not bar the respondents from considering and disposing of the representation
submitted by the W.A. No. 64 of 2023 with MC(W.A.) No. 118 of 2023 Page 6 petitioner. In her
representation dated 21.08.2023, the petitioner prayed for reposting in her original college i.e.
Biramangol College, Sawombung in compliance of the clause 7 of the order dated 07.03.2019 which
stipulates that the incumbent shall remain at the respective place of original posting until further
orders. The prayer in the writ petition is for quashing clause 7 of the order dated 07.03.2019 and
also for direction to consider and dispose of the representation dated 21.08.2023 and in the interim
it is prayed for passing an order not to make finalization of absorption of other incumbents or not to
apply clause 7 of the impugned order in case of the petitioner till the pendency of the writ petition.
This Court is of the view that the impugned order does not reject the prayer for interim order as
submitted by Mr. N. Ibotombi, learned senior counsel for the appellant. Rather liberty was given to
the respondents to dispose of the representation of the appellant which is one of the prayers in the
writ petition. Moreover, this Court is of the view that the impugned order dated 28.08.2023 is not
an appealable order within the meaning of Section 2(14) of CPC which provides that order means
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182489704/ 4
Ningthoujam Ibemcha Devi vs The State Of Manipur Represented By Its ... on 13 September, 2023
the formal expression of any decision of a Civil Court which is not a degree. In the present case, the
learned Single Judge did not express any formal expression of any decision with respect to all the
prayers made in the writ petition. It is an innocuous order of issuing notice to the respondents and
giving liberty to the respondents to dispose of the representation submitted by the appellant
notwithstanding the pendency of the appeal. It is settled provisions of law that the principles
embodied in CPC is also applicable in the proceedings of writ petition and writ appeal. We are of the
view that the writ W.A. No. 64 of 2023 with MC(W.A.) No. 118 of 2023 Page 7 appeal is not
maintainable in the present form as the appellant is not aggrieved by the impugned order which is in
the form of issuing notice to the respondents and giving liberty to dispose of the representation of
the appellant. One of the prayers, prayer No. 4 in the writ petition is for a direction to consider and
dispose of the representation dated 21.08.2023 submitted by the appellant within a time frame by a
speaking order. In any case, the appellant is not aggrieved by any portion of the impugned order
dated 28.08.2023 passed by the learned Single Judge, nor the prayer for the interim relief being
rejected by the impugned order. We are of the view that the impugned order dated 28.08.2023 does
not fall within the meaning of order as defined in Section 2(14) of CPC. Hence, reading together
Chapters 3 & 4 of the High Court of Manipur Rules 2019, the writ appeal is dismissed as not
maintainable. However, it is clarified that the appellant may agitate the prayer for interim relief
before the learned Single Judge and also other grounds in the writ appeal. It is clarified that this
Court does not express any opinion on the merit of the case except for considering maintainability of
the writ appeal.
[8] With these observations, writ appeal is disposed of.
[9] No costs.
