general order of the department, the Respondents had not paid the differences of salary from

promotion, the period spent in the work charge establishment be counted as qualifying service.

paragraph no.5 (iv), it has been mentioned that for the purposes of grant of benefits of Modified
Assured Career Progression Schemes (MACPS), the services rendered in the work charge

since the date of his appointment in the work charge establishment as well as revision of salary
pursuant to the different circulars of the Finance Department. The Finance Department issued a

dated 12.05.2016 with respect to amendment of pay-scale of fourth grade employees. By the said

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/147003949/ 4
Sudha Mishra vs The State Of Bihar on 13 October, 2025
decided that for the purposes of benefits of ACP /MACP as also the pay Patna High Court CWJC
No.8506 of 2024 dt.13-10-2025 protection the services rendered by the petitioner in the work
charge establishment from 1988 to 2006 was counted but in utter disregard, the Respondent issued
the impugned order contained in Letter No. 581 dated 08.04.2020, by which the Respondent no.3
held that Resolution No. 3972 dated 12.05.2016 and Resolution No.7577 dated 23.09.2016 are not
applicable in the case of those employees whose services had been regularized in the year 2006 or
later on from the work charge establishment and they are only entitled for the prescribed pay-scale
and financial progression with effect from 01.01.2006. By the said letter, the Respondent no. 3 also
directed the authorities concerned to revise the salary of those employees and to take needful action
in accordance with law.
9. The learned counsel for the petitioner has further submitted that pursuant to the aforesaid letter,
the Respondent no. 6 was pleased to reduce the salary of the husband of the petitioner and also
issued the Office Order No. 198 dated 08.11.2023 contained in Memo No. 1871 dated 08.11.203, by
which he ordered for recovery of Rs.3,58,329/- from the retiral dues of the petitioner but the said
order was not served to the petitioner. The Respondent no.6 issued Office Order No. 205 dated
09.11.2023 contained in Memo No. 1890 dated Patna High Court CWJC No.8506 of 2024
dt.13-10-2025 09.11.2023 by which he sanctioned the amount of earned leave of Rs.5,02,165/- to the
husband of the petitioner however, he deducted the amount of Rs.3,58,329/- from the earned leave
of the petitioner and ordered for payment of only Rs.1,43,836/- against the earned leave of the
husband of the petitioner. After attaining the age of superannuation, the husband of the petitioner
had superannuated from the post of Khalasi on 31.03.2023 pursuant to the office order contained in
Memo No. 626 dated 28.03.203 but nothing has been paid to the husband of petitioner against his
retrial dues save and except the amount of Group Insurance and General Provident Fund. He
further submits that after the retirement, the husband of the petitioner died in harness on
04.12.2023 without getting his retrial dues. With respect to death of her husband, a death certificate
was issued by the competent authority on 10.12.2023. He further submits that the impugned order
of recovery was issued after eight months of the retirement of the petitioner without asking any
show cause notice or opportunity of hearing to the petitioner.
10. The learned counsel for the petitioner has relied upon a judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court
in the case of State of Punjab & Ors v/s Rafiq Masih, (2015) 4 SCC 334 and Patna High Court CWJC
No.8506 of 2024 dt.13-10-2025 the case of Thomas Daniel v/s State of Kerala and Others, 2022 SCC
OnLine SC 536.
11. The learned counsel for the State relying on the statement made in the counter affidavit has
vehemently opposed the prayer of the petitioner.
12. I have heard and considered the submissions of the parties and have also gone through the
records of the case.
13. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Thomas Daniel V/s State of Kerala & Ors,. reported as
(2022) SCC OnLine SC 536, referring to the summarized postulation of law expounded in Rafiq
Masih (supra) regarding situations wherein recoveries would not be permissible had held as under:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/147003949/ 5
Sudha Mishra vs The State Of Bihar on 13 October, 2025
10. In Sahib Ram v. State of Haryana, this Court restrained recovery of payment
which was given under the upgraded pay scale on account of wrong construction of
relevant order by the authority concerned, without any misrepresentation on part of
the employees. It was held thus:
"5. Admittedly the appellant does not possess the required educational qualifications.
Under the circumstances the appellant would not be entitled to the relaxation. The
Principal erred in granting him the relaxation. Since the date of relaxation, the
appellant had been paid his salary on the revised scale. However, it is not on account
of any misrepresentation made by the appellant that the benefit of the higher pay
scale Patna High Court CWJC No.8506 of 2024 dt.13-10-2025 was given to him but
by wrong construction made by the Principal for which the appellant cannot be held
to be at fault. Under the circumstances the amount paid till date may not be
recovered from the appellant. The principle of equal pay for equal work would not
apply to the scales prescribed by the University Grants Commission. The appeal is
allowed partly without any order as to costs."
11. In Col. B.J. Akkara (Retd.) v.
Government of India this Court considered an identical question as under:
"27. The last question to be considered is whether relief should be granted against the
recovery of the excess payments made on account of the wrong
interpretation/understanding of the circular dated 7-6-1999. This Court has
consistently granted relief against recovery of excess wrong payment of
emoluments/allowances from an employee, if the following conditions are fulfilled
(vide Sahib Ram v. State of Haryana [1995 Supp (1) SCC 18 : 1995 SCC (L&S) 248],
Shyam Babu Verma v. Union of India [(1994) 2 SCC 521 :1994 SCC (L&S) 683: (1994)
27 ATC 121], Union of India v. M. Bhaskar (1996) 4 SCC 416 : 1996 SCC (L&S) 967]
and V. Gangaram v. R[egional Jt. Director [(1997) 6 SCC 139 : 1997 SCC (L&S)
1652]):
(a) The excess payment was not made on account of any misrepresentation or fraud
on the part of the employee.
(b) Such excess payment was made by the employer by applying a wrong principle for
calculating the Patna High Court CWJC No.8506 of 2024 dt.13-10-2025
pay/allowance or on the basis of a particular interpretation of rule/order, which is
subsequently found to be erroneous.
28. Such relief, restraining back recovery of excess payment, is granted by courts not because of any
right in the employees, but in equity, in exercise of judicial discretion to relieve the employees from
the hardship that will be caused if recovery is implemented. A government servant, particularly one
in the lower rungs of service would spend whatever emoluments he receives for the upkeep of his
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/147003949/ 6
Sudha Mishra vs The State Of Bihar on 13 October, 2025
family. If he receives an excess payment for a long period, he would spend it, genuinely believing
that he is entitled to it. As any subsequent action to recover the excess payment will cause undue
hardship to him, relief is granted in that behalf. But where the employee had knowledge that the
payment received was in excess of what was due or wrongly paid, or where the error is detected or
corrected within a short time of wrong payment, courts will not grant relief against recovery. The
matter being in the realm of judicial discretion, courts may on the facts and circumstances of any
particular case refuse to grant such relief against recovery.
29. On the same principle, pensioners can also seek a direction that wrong payments should not be
recovered, as pensioners are in a more disadvantageous position when compared to in-service
employees. Any attempt to recover excess wrong payment would cause undue hardship to them. The
petitioners are not guilty of any misrepresentation or fraud in regard to Patna High Court CWJC
No.8506 of 2024 dt.13-10-2025 the excess payment. NPA was added to minimum pay, for purposes
of stepping up, due to a wrong understanding by the implementing departments. We are therefore
of the view that the respondents shall not recover any excess payments made towards pension in
pursuance of the circular dated 7-6-1999 till the issue of the clarificatory circular dated 11-9- 2001.
Insofar as any excess payment made after the circular dated 11-9-2001, obviously the Union of India
will be entitled to recover the excess as the validity of the said circular has been upheld and as
pensioners have been put on notice in regard to the wrong calculations earlier made."
12. In Syed Abdul Qadir v. State of Bihar excess payment was sought to be recovered which was
made to the appellants-teachers on account of mistake and wrong interpretation of prevailing Bihar
Nationalised Secondary School (Service Conditions) Rules, 1983. The appellants therein contended
that even if it were to be held that the appellants were not entitled to the benefit of additional
increment on promotion, the excess amount should not be recovered from them, it having been paid
without any misrepresentation or fraud on their part. The Court held that the appellants cannot be
held responsible in such a situation and recovery of the excess payment should not be ordered,
especially when the employee has subsequently retired. The court observed that in general parlance,
recovery is prohibited by courts where there exists no misrepresentation or fraud on the part of the
employee and when the excess payment has been made by applying a wrong
interpretation/understanding of a Patna High Court CWJC No.8506 of 2024 dt.13-10-2025 Rule or
Order. It was held thus:
"59. Undoubtedly, the excess amount that has been paid to the appellant teachers
was not because of any misrepresentation or fraud on their part and the appellants
also had no knowledge that the amount that was being paid to them was more than
what they were entitled to. It would not be out of place to mention here that the
Finance Department had, in its counter-affidavit, admitted that it was a bona fide
mistake on their part. The excess payment made was the result of wrong
interpretation of the Rule that was applicable to them, for which the appellants
cannot be held responsible. Rather, the whole confusion was because of inaction,
negligence and carelessness of the officials concerned of the Government of Bihar.
Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant teachers submitted that
majority of the beneficiaries have either retired or are on the verge of it. Keeping in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/147003949/ 7
Sudha Mishra vs The State Of Bihar on 13 October, 2025
view the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case at hand and to avoid any
hardship to the appellant teachers, we are of the view that no recovery of the amount
that has been paid in excess to the appellant teachers should be made."
13. In State of Punjab v. Rafiq Masih (White Washer) wherein this court examined the validity of an
order passed by the State to recover the monetary gains wrongly extended to the beneficiary
employees in excess of their entitlements without any fault or misrepresentation at the behest of the
recipient. This Court considered situations of hardship caused to an employee, if recovery is directed
to reimburse the employer and disallowed the same, exempting the Patna High Court CWJC
No.8506 of 2024 dt.13-10-2025 beneficiary employees from such recovery. It was held thus:
"8. As between two parties, if a determination is rendered in favour of the party,
which is the weaker of the two, without any serious detriment to the other (which is
truly a welfare State), the issue resolved would be in consonance with the concept of
justice, which is assured to the citizens of India, even in the Preamble of the
Constitution of India. The right to recover being pursued by the employer, will have
to be compared, with the effect of the recovery on the employee concerned. If the
effect of the recovery from the employee concerned would be, more unfair, more
wrongful, more improper, and more unwarranted, than the corresponding right of
the employer to recover the amount, then it would be iniquitous and arbitrary, to
effect the recovery. In such a situation, the employee's right would outbalance, and
therefore eclipse, the right of the employer to recover.
Xxxxxxxxx
18. It is not possible to postulate all situations of hardship which would govern
employees on the issue of recovery, where payments have mistakenly been made by
the employer, in excess of their entitlement. Be that as it may, based on the decisions
referred to hereinabove, we may, as a ready reference, summarise the following few
situations, wherein recoveries by the employers, would be impermissible in law:
(I) Recovery from the employees belonging to Class III and Class IV service (or Group
C and Group D service).
(ii) Recovery from the retired employees, or the employees who are due to retire
within one year, of the order of recovery.
(iii) Recovery from the employees, when the excess payment has been made for a
period in excess of Patna High Court CWJC No.8506 of 2024 dt.13-10-2025 five
years, before the order of recovery is issued.
(iv) Recovery in cases where an employee has wrongfully been required to discharge
duties of a higher post, and has been paid accordingly, even though he should have
rightfully been required to work against an inferior post.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/147003949/ 8
Sudha Mishra vs The State Of Bihar on 13 October, 2025
(v) In any other case, where the court arrives at the conclusion, that recovery if made
from the employee, would be iniquitous or harsh or arbitrary to such an extent, as
would far outweigh the equitable balance of the employer's right to recover."
14. From the afore-quoted judgments, it is patently clear that the recovery of excess payment, which
is not having been made by fraud or misrepresentation, from a Class-IV employee is impermissible.
The recovery of excess payments made to employees due to administrative errors must be governed
by equity, fairness, and natural justice. Recovery cannot be mechanically enforced, especially against
a retired Class-IV employee, particularly when such excess payment could not be attributable to the
fraudulent act on the part of the employee concerned.
15. Considering the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in paragraph-18 of Rafiq Masih
(Supra), which is reiterated in Thomas Daniel (Supra) squarely apply to the facts of the present case
and it is clear that recovery of excess payments cannot be enforced against a Class-IV employee in
the Patna High Court CWJC No.8506 of 2024 dt.13-10-2025 absence of any fraud or
misrepresentation.
16. The recovery made from the deceased husband of the petitioner is held to be illegal and,
therefore, the order dated 08.04.2020 passed by the Respondent no.3 contained in Letter No. 581
dated 08.04.2020 and the Office Order No. 205 dated 09.11.2023 contained in Memo No.1890
dated 09.11.2023 issued under the signature of the Respondent no. 6 are hereby quashed.
17. The respondents are directed to ensure the consequential benefits by restoring the
adjusted/recovered amount to the petitioner within a period of 12 weeks from the date of
receipt/communication of a copy of this order.
18. With the aforesaid observation and direction, this application is allowed.
