acre comprised in Survey No.9 situated at Moondramkattalai Village, Kundrathur, by the registered
sale deed dated 27.03.1998 vide document No.1218 of 1998 from one Arulanandam viz., the first
petitioner herein. From the date of the purchase the second petitioner is in possession and
enjoyment of the property. The said land is agricultural in character and even till today, the second
petitioner is carrying agricultural operations and paying kist for the property.
3. In the mean while, the proceedings were initiated under the Tamil Nadu Urban Land (Ceiling and
Regulation) Act, 1978 (herein after referred to as “the Act”). However, no notice was served to the
second petitioner and the second respondent passed an order under Section 9(5) of the Act dated
09.10.1998 thereby acquiring an extent of 3550 sq.mt., after allowing an extent of 500 sq.mt.,
towards the first petitioner i.e., the vendor's family entitlement. The said award was passed without

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/30349674/ 2
T.Arulandam @ Arul vs The Principal Commissioner & on 30 November, 2021
clearly exclude the lands which are agriculture in character for the acquisition proceeding. Without
any inspection, the second respondent mechanically passed the order under Section (5) of the Act.
All the revenue documents stood as agricultural land and it would clearly established that the said
land is agricultural land. No notice as contemplated under Section 8 of the Tamil Nadu Urban Land
(Ceiling & Regulation) Rules was issued. It contemplates that the issuance of notice shall be by
Registered Post which procedure has been completely violated. According to the respondents, the
notice under Section 9(4) of the Act and the draft statement under Section 9(1) of the Act were
served to the land owner and they have not objected to the acquisition and nor appeared for any
enquiry. Further there is absolutely no records to show that on what mode the notices were served
to the land owners. That apart, the order has been passed under Section 9(5) of the Act, without

second petitioner and no notice was served under https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Section 11(5) of
the Act to take possession. If the land owners not handed over the acquired land, then the
respondents ought to have serve notice under Section 11(6) of the Act to take forcible possession in
respect of the said property. In this case, no procedure had been followed and the second petitioner
is still in possession and enjoyment of the property. Therefore, the entire land acquisition
proceedings have been lapsed under Section 4 of the Tamil Nadu Urban Land (Ceiling & Regulation)
Repeal Act, Act 20 of 1999 (hereinafter referred to as “the Repeal Act”).
5. Per contra, the learned Special Government Pleader appearing for the respondents submitted that
the notice under Section 7(2) of the Act was issued by the second respondent in S.R.No.99/98 dated
09.07.1998 to the first petitioner for the land owned by him in S.No.9/3 situated at
Moondramkattalai Village and it was served on 12.07.1998. The land owner failed to file the return
under Section 7(1) of the Act and therefore, the notice under Section 9(4) of the Act and the draft
statement under Section 9(1) of the Act have been issued in Rc.No.2659/98 dated 04.09.1998. It has
been served by affixture on 09.09.1998. He further submitted that the said land was inspected by
the competent authority on 22.09.1998 and found that the land was laid out as plots and it is kept
vacant. Since the land owner failed to file any objection and did https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
not give any details about his family, the order under Section 9(5) of the Act was passed in
Rc.No.2659/98 dated 09.10.1998, declaring the excess vacant land as 3550 Sq.mt., after allowing
500 Sq.mt., of land as urban land owner's entitlement area, out of the total extent of 4050 Sq.mt.
Available in the said land. Since the urban land owner had refused to receive the order, then it was
served by affixture on 23.10.1998 in the land. Thereafter, no reply or details had received from the
land owner and therefore, final statement under Section 10(1) of the Act had been issued by the
second respondent on 10.11.1998. Since the land owner had moved out from the village, the same
was served by affixture on 13.11.1998, in the land.
5.1. The notification under Section 11(1) of the Act was issued on 14.12.1998 and sent to the Collector
of Kancheepuram District and the Tahsildar, Sriperumbudur, the local authority concerned etc., and
the same had published in Tamil Nadu Government Gazette on 03.02.1999. The final notification
under Section 11(3) of the Act was issued on 04.03.1999 and the land has been deemed to have
vested with the Government with effect from 05.04.1999. The notice under Section 11(5) of the Act
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/30349674/ 3
T.Arulandam @ Arul vs The Principal Commissioner & on 30 November, 2021
was issued in Rc.No.2659/98 dated 23.04.1999 to the urban land owner instructing him to
surrender or deliver the possession of excess vacant land. Since the urban land
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis owner had refused to receive it, it was served by affixture on
27.04.1999 and finally, the possession of the excess vacant land had been handed over to the
Revenue Department on 02.06.1999. Hence, he prayed to dismiss the present Writ Petition.
6. Heard Mr.V.R.Ramesh, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners, Mr. A.Selvendran, learned
Special Government Pleader appearing for the respondents.
7. On perusal of records revealed that the second petitioner is still in possession and enjoyment of
the subject property and the agricultural activities still going on. As rightly pointed out by the
learned counsel appearing for the petitioners, when the subject land is agriculture in nature, it
cannot be acquired. As per the provisions under Section 3(o) & 3(p) of the Act, any land situated
within the limits of an urban agglomeration and referred to as such in the master plan and where
any such land is actually used mainly for the purpose of agriculture, such land shall not be deemed
to be urban or vacant land so long as it is continued to be so used for the purpose of agriculture.
Therefore, the second respondent without application of mind mechanically passed the order stating
that the subject land laid out as house cites and passed order under Section 9(5) of the Act.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
8. That apart, according to the respondents, the notice under Section11(5) of the Act, was issued on
23.04.1999 to the urban land owner instructing him to surrender or deliver the possession of the
excess land. Since the urban land owner refused to receive it, it was affixed on 27.04.1999 and finally
the possession of excess lands had been handed over to the revenue department on 02.06.1999.
However, there is absolutely no records to show that how the lands were handed over to the revenue
department from the urban land owner. If the urban land owner failed to surrender his possession
in respect of the excess land, the respondents ought to have invoked the provisions under Section
11(6) of the Act to take forcible possession. In the case on hand, there is no record to show that the
urban land owner was served with notice under Section 11(6) of the Act.
9. Further the records produced by the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners viz., Chitta,
Adangal etc., revealed that the second petitioner is in possession and enjoyment of the subject land
and he is doing agricultural activities. It shows that the respondents had taken possession only by
paper and all are desk works. Even till today, the second petitioner is in possession and enjoyment
of the property. Therefore, as per the provisions under Section 4 of the Repeal Act, the proceeding
initiated under the Act shall stand abate, since https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis the physical
possession of the subject land has not been taken till today. Therefore, the entire acquisition
proceeding initiated under the Act shall stand lapsed.
10. Accordingly, the impugned order dated 09.10.1998 vide Na.Ka.No.B/2659/99 under Section
9(5) of the Act and Notice dated 23.04.1999 vide Rc.B.2655/98 under Section 11(5) of the Act,
