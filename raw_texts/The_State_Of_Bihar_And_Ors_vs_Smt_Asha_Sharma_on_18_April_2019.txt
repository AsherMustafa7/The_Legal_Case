HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE ANIL KUMAR UPADHYAY
C A V JUDGMENT
(Per: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE ANIL KUMAR UPADHYAY)
Date : 18-04-2019
LPA No. 1568 of 2011
(1) The Division Bench in this appeal preferred by the
State of Bihar against the judgment of the Single Judge dated
23rd March, 2011, in CWJC No. 1046 of 2006, had noticed
conflicting judgments of two Division Benches - one reported in
2007 (2) PLJR 239 (Shyam Kishore Singh vs. The State of Bihar
& Ors.) and the other in the matter of Madho Sharma vs. the
State of Bihar & Ors. in CWJC No. 15725 of 2010, decided on 5 th
July, 2013 and, on consideration of Government Circulars dated
29th November, 1978 and 30th August, 1980 as well as the Bihar
Non-Government Secondary Schools (Taking Over of Control
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9778414/ 3
The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Smt.Asha Sharma on 18 April, 2019
and Management) Act, 1981 (hereinafter referred to as "the Act
of 1981") and Bihar Nationalized Secondary Schools (Service
Conditions) Rules, 1983 (hereinafter referred to as "1983
Rules") noted that there are three diverse opinions for
calculating the service for the purposes of pensionary benefits:
(a) to count service from the date of take over treating the non-
teaching employee as government servant (b) counting the
service from the date of grant of recognition of the non-
Patna High Court L.P.A No.1568 of 2011 dt.18-04-2019
4/46
government school and (c) reckoning of service from the date of
grant of permission to establish the school.
LPA No. 1681 of 2013
(2) This appeal arises out of the judgment of the
same learned Single Judge, who accepted the contention of the
petitioner that service for the purpose of pensionary benefit
shall be reckoned from the date of grant of permission to
establish the school. Noticing the issue involved in LPA No. 1681
of 2013, the Division Bench referred the same for consideration
before the Full Bench and this was tagged with LPA No. 1568 of
2011.
CWJC NO. 13563 of 2006
(3) This writ petition was heard on different dates
by the learned Single Judge and, vide order dated 21.11.2013,
the learned Single Judge noticing the conflicting Division Bench
decisions directed this case to be listed before a Division
Bench. On 16.06.2014, this writ petition was admitted by the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9778414/ 4
The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Smt.Asha Sharma on 18 April, 2019
Division Bench and it was directed to be heard along with LPA
No. 1568 of 2011. As such, the case has been tagged with LPA
No. 1568 of 2011 the subject matter before the Full Bench.
CWJC No. 3486 of 2008
(4) In so far as CWJC No. 3486 of 2008 is
Patna High Court L.P.A No.1568 of 2011 dt.18-04-2019
5/46
concerned, this writ petition was heard on different dates. The
learned Single Judge noticing the submission of the learned
counsel for the State that similar matter has been referred to
the Full Bench in LPA No.1568 of 2011, directed the case to be
heard along with LPA No. 1568 of 2011. Thus, CWJC No. 3468 of
2008 has been tagged in this batch of cases.
(5) It would be appropriate to note here that in LPA
No. 1568 of 2011 the reference precisely involves the issue of
counting of service for the purpose of grant of pension to a
teacher retired after the school was taken over under the 1981
Act and the 1983 Service Condition Rules framed thereunder.
Similar is the issue involved in LPA No. 1681 of 2013. But, on a
close scrutiny of the facts of CWJC No. 13563 of 2006 and CWJC
No. 3486 of 2008, it appears that in both the cases the issue
involved is slightly different. In both the writ applications
petitioners have challenged the decision of the Director,
Secondary Education, who rejected the claim of the petitioners
to count service rendered in the previous school in the light of
Resolution No. 636 dated 18.07.1992 whereby the State
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9778414/ 5
The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Smt.Asha Sharma on 18 April, 2019
Government noticing the abuse of liberalized scheme of
condoning the break in service vide Resolution No. 581 dated
15.01.1982
decided to slightly amend the Resolution dated Patna High Court L.P.A No.1568 of 2011
dt.18-04-2019 15.01.1982. In the light of the decision contained in Memo No. 636 dated 18th July,
1992, the claim of the petitioners for counting past service rendered in the previous school was
rejected. Of course, while rejecting their claim, one of the reasons assigned was that service
rendered before recognition and after grant of permission shall not be counted. Thus, the
fundamental issue for deciding the present reference is what should be the cut-off date for counting
the service of a teacher whose service was taken over after non-government school was taken over
under the scheme of 1981 Act. Prior to 1981 Act, the school was taken over under the scheme of
Bihar Non- Government Secondary Education (Taking Over of the Management and Control)
Ordinance, 1980. The Ordinance was promulgated on 11th August, 1980. However, the scheme with
regard to take over of management and control contained Section 3 came into force from 2nd
October, 1980.
(6) Before entering into the Reference it would be appropriate to examine the Law regulating the
Secondary Education with emphasis on service condition particularly the right to receive pension.
The very first legislative enactment in this regard is Bihar High School (Control, Regulation and
Administration) Act, 1960.
Patna High Court L.P.A No.1568 of 2011 dt.18-04-2019 (7) Prior to commencement of Bihar High
School (Control, Regulation and Administration) Act, 1960, the Bihar Education Code was
regulating the administration of the school. The Bihar Education Code was held to be non-statutory
by the Constitution Bench of the Apex Court in the case of Dwarka Nath Tiwary vs. State of Bihar
[AIR1959 SC 249].
(8) Under the scheme of the 1960 Act, the Board of Secondary Education was constituted. The
Board was vested with the power and function necessary for regulating higher education including
the power to grant recognition to school imparting instructions in secondary and higher secondary
education. Under Section 8 of the 1960 Act, rule making power was vested in the State Government.
(9) After 1960 Act, Bihar Secondary Education Board Ordinance, 1974 was promulgated. Under the
scheme of the 1974 Ordinance, District Secondary Education Fund was created. The fund was for
the purpose of payment of pay, allowances and also for payment of gratuity, pension and provident
fund. Under the scheme of the 1974 Ordinance, there was provision for rule making as well as for
framing regulation. By the said 1974 Ordinance, 1960 Act was repealed. In the year 1976, Bihar
Secondary Education Board Act was Patna High Court L.P.A No.1568 of 2011 dt.18-04-2019
enacted. For the first time, under the scheme of the 1974 Ordinance, in Section 28, it was provided
that prior permission of the Board is essential for setting up secondary school. Section 29 of the
1976 Act retained the scheme of Section 28 of the Ordinance. It was made clear that secondary
school cannot be established without prior permission of the Board. Under Section 36, the Board
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9778414/ 6
The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Smt.Asha Sharma on 18 April, 2019
was vested with the power to take over control the management of the secondary education. Section
37 of the Ordinance provides for rule making power of the Board to regulate service condition.
(10) On the line of Section 53 and 59 of 1974 Ordinance, provision was made for creation of
secondary education fund and its utilization. Section 57 of the 1976 Act and Section 58 of 1976 Act
retained the scheme for constituting District Secondary Education Fund and its utilization. One of
the purpose of utilization of the fund was for payment of pension, gratuity and provident fund of
headmaster, teachers and other employees of recognized high school.
(11) Though the power to frame rules and regulation was vested with the Board but unfortunately no
rule was framed by the Board for enforcement of the scheme of the Act.
Patna High Court L.P.A No.1568 of 2011 dt.18-04-2019 (12) In the year 1980 an Ordinance was
promulgated for take over of the recognized secondary school. This 1980 Ordinance is the most
crucial legislation in the filed of regulating secondary education. The ordinance which was
promulgated on 11th August, 1980 was subsequently replaced by the Bihar Non-Government
Secondary School (Taking Over of Management) Act, 1981 (Bihar Act No.33 of 1980). The 1981 Act
came into force on publication of the official gazette on 24.01.1982. However, the 1981 Act saved the
action taken under the 1980 Ordinance vide repeal and saving clause under Section 21.
(13) Under Section 9 of the Act, the power of rule making and regulating service condition was
vested with the State Government. The State Government framed 1983 Rules. Under the Act,
recognized school was defined under Section 2(6) as recognized by the State Government. The Rule
is conspicuously silent on the issue of pension to the teachers and non-teaching employees and
entitlement of pension. The Rule is also silent on the point as to what should be the reckoning date
of counting of service of teachers on taker over their service.
(14) The effect of take over is envisaged under the Patna High Court L.P.A No.1568 of 2011
dt.18-04-2019 Ordinance as well as the Act in as much as on take over under Section 4(2) service of
all teachers and other employees stands transferred to the State Government and, thereafter, they be
deemed to be State Government employees on the posts which they were holding. At this stage, it
would be appropriate to refer that under 1974 Ordinance and 1976 Act, the power to grant
recognition was vested with the Board and only in 1983 when the Rules were framed under Section
9 of the Bihar State Non-Government Schools (Taking Over Control and Management) Act, the
power to grant recognition was vested with the State Government. It may not be out of place to
mention here that under the scheme of 1960 Act also the Board of Secondary Education was vested
with the power to recognize secondary or higher secondary school.
(15) Service condition is a very wide connotation and it include all the conditions of service before
entry to post retiral benefits. The scheme of pension for teaching and non- teaching employee was
introduced by the State Government as social security scheme right from 1st April, 1962.
(16) It appears that the State Government in order to wheel ahead the social security measures in
furtherance of social welfare scheme framed scheme for grant Patna High Court L.P.A No.1568 of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9778414/ 7
The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Smt.Asha Sharma on 18 April, 2019
2011 dt.18-04-2019 of pension. So far as the State Government employees are concerned, Pension
Rules have been framed in 1950 and noticing the hardship, pension and family pension schemes
were liberalized and various notifications, resolution and direction have been issued to make
effective the scheme of pension and family pension. The benefit of pension was extended even to
private sector. In the matter of private schools, Bihar Non-government School Employees' Provident
Fund, Insurance, Pension (Triple Benefit Scheme) Rules was framed to extend the triple benefit
scheme to the employees of recognized non-government school whether controlled by local bodies
or private management. The benefit was extended to all primary schools, middle schools and such
secondary schools including Sarvodaya multipurpose higher secondary school or such other schools
as the State Government from time to time declared. Under rule -5 of the 1964 Rules, scheme for
provident fund was incorporated. Rule- 6 takes care of insurance and pension and gratuity were also
provided under Chapter-V of the said Rules. Pension was admissible to an employee on completion
of ten years, gratuity was admissible on completion of five years of qualifying service. Calculation of
pension was formulated under Rule-20 on completion of Patna High Court L.P.A No.1568 of 2011
dt.18-04-2019 qualifying service indicated therein. Rule-18 of the Rules is indicative of the fact that
officiating service of employee when followed by permanency was entitled to count full service.
Exclusion of counting service was enumerated in Rule-19, which is relevant for the purpose of
deciding the present case and is reproduced hereinbelow for ready reference:-
"19. No claim to pension shall be admitted in the following cases:-
(a) When an employee is appointed for a limited time only, or for a special duty;
on the completion of which he is to be discharged.
(b) When an employee is appointed temporarily.
(c) When an employee is appointed part-
time.
(d) When an employee is dismissed or removed for misconduct, insolvency or inefficiency."
(17) This Rules was framed and notified on 4th September, 1964. The State Government noticing the
purpose of benevolent scheme issued the notification for the benefit of employees of the
non-government schools. The benefit was made available with effect from 1st April, 1962. Section -4
of the said Rules is relevant for the purpose of the present case and is quoted below :-
"4. (1) In these rules, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context:

shall respectively have the same meaning as assigned to them in those Rules or Codes."
(18) As indicated hereinabove, under 1974 Ordinance, scheme was formulated for constituting
District Secondary Education Fund and one of the objectives of the fund was to grant pension,
gratuity etc. from the said fund. However, the 1974 Ordinance or 1976 Act has not in any Patna High
Court L.P.A No.1568 of 2011 dt.18-04-2019 manner diluted the triple benefit scheme available to
teaching and non-teaching employees of Private Secondary Schools.
(19) The next decision of the State Government which has direct bearing on this case is the decision
dated 1.3.1977 whereby the Secondary Education Board issued letter no. 6764-6829 and circulated
the same to all the District Education Officers, Sub Divisional Education Officers and District
Inspectors of Schools informing them the decision of the Board in relation to recognition of service
of the teachers appointed from the date of grant of permission to the date of permanent recognition.
The letter dated 1.3.1977 is the most important decision of the Board in the matter of recognizing the
service of the teachers and has direct bearing in the matter of adjudication of the present reference
and as such the same is quoted below for ready reference:-

(21) On 30.08.1980, the Education Department issued notification in continuation of the
notification dated 4.9.1964 and 29.11.1978. In the resolution dated 30.08.1980, it was declared that
the State Government has decided to grant benefit of general provident fund, pension (family
pension) and gratuity to the teachers and non-teaching employees of Patna High Court L.P.A
No.1568 of 2011 dt.18-04-2019 recognized school like the State Government employees with effect
from 1.4.1978 and in order to give effect to the benefit of Bihar Pension Rules, Rule- 58, 60 and 79 of
the Bihar Pension Rules have been relaxed. This benefit was available to all teachers and
non-teaching employees, who opted for such benefit by accepting the reduced age of 58 instead of
62 years and also to all teachers appointed after 1.4.1978. The next decision in this regard is Memo
No. 581 dated 15.1.1982, which was issued by the Finance Department for the purpose of condoning
the break in service of teachers. For ready reference, resolution dated 15.1.1982 is quoted

dt.18-04-2019 (22) From the resolution dated 15.1.1982, it would be apparent that
the State Government decided to condone the break in service in purported exercise
of power under Rule-203(A) of the Bihar Pension Rules. Rule-101 of the Bihar
Pension Rules provides for forfeiture of past service in case of resignation, dismissal
or removal for misconduct, insolvency, inefficiency or on failure to pass examination.
Rule 101(b) of the Pension Rules clarifies that resignation of an appointment with the
approval of the appointing authority to take up another appointment, service in
which counts, is not a resignation of the public service. Rule-105 confers power to the
Provincial Government for condonation of interruption and deficiencies. It is
noteworthy here that the State Government vide memo no. 1040 dated 13.11.1969
decided to condone the break in service. Clause (4) of Appendix-VI of the Bihar
Pension Rules speaks about break in service, which shall not be counted as
pensionable service. To dilute the scheme of forfeiture of past service and for
condonation of break in service, the State Government is vested with the power
under Rule 203 of the Pension Rules, which is quoted below for ready reference:-
"203. (a) The Provincial Government reserve to themselves the powers of
interpreting the rules and of granting any indulgence not Patna High Court L.P.A
No.1568 of 2011 dt.18-04-2019 provided for by the rules.
If any interpretation of the rules is involved, or if any indulgence not provided for by
the rules is proposed, the head of department or the head of the office shall submit
the case with his opinion and recommendation, to the Provincial Government in the
Administrative Department concerned."
(23) After scrutiny of the aforesaid scheme of the Act, Rules and notifications issued from time to
time in the matter of grant of permission to establish secondary school, provision for grant of
recognition, the scheme with regard to counting of past service for the purpose of grant of
pensionary benefits, break in service and its condonation and relaxation of the provision of the

The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Smt.Asha Sharma on 18 April, 2019
Bihar Pension Rules, now we have to examine the rival contentions of the parties.
(24) Mr. Anjani Kumar, learned AAG, appearing on behalf of the State in support of the appeal has
drawn the line of distinction between the services rendered before take over and after take over of
schools. He submitted that in terms of Section 4(2) of the Take Over Act, the teachers and non-
teaching employees on their transfer shall be deemed to be State Government employees and in
terms of rules-58 and 60 of the Bihar Pension Rules are entitled to pension as they are government
servants and as such pension is their right as State Govt. employees. Rules-58 and 60 of the Bihar
Pension Rules Patna High Court L.P.A No.1568 of 2011 dt.18-04-2019 contemplate conditions and
qualification for grant of pension which are quoted hereinbelow:-
"58. The service of a Government servant does not qualify for pension unless it
conforms to the following three conditions:-
First - The service must be under Government.
Second - The employment must be substantive and permanent.
Third - The service must be paid by Government.
These three conditions are fully explained in the following sub-sections."
"60. The service of a Government servant does not qualify unless he is appointed and
his duties and pay are regulated by the Government, or under conditions determined
by the Government. The following are examples of Government servants excluded
from pension by this rule :
(1)Employees of a municipality, (2)Employees of grant-in-aid schools and
institutions (3)Service on an establishment paid from the house hold allowance of the
Governor or from his contract establishment allowance."
(25) Mr. Anjani Kumar would submit that the school was taken over under the scheme of the Act on
2.10.1980. As such, on take over of the school the teaching and non-teaching employees of the
schools, on retirement, shall count their service from that date for the purpose of pension as they
acquired status of State Govt. employees only on 2.10.1980 and not prior thereto. Adverting to the
scheme of pension Patna High Court L.P.A No.1568 of 2011 dt.18-04-2019 formulated right from 1st
April, 1962 onwards, Mr. Anjani Kumar submitted that pension payable under the 1962 Scheme and
1964 Rules and under the scheme of 1974 Ordinance as well as 1976 Rules is payable not by the
State Government but from the District Education Fund. He placed heavy reliance on Section 58 of
the 1976 Act for the proposition that the District Secondary Education Fund was a fund available for
payment of pension, gratuity and provident fund and it was not the obligation of the State
Government and as such counting of service for the purpose of grant of pension and gratuity from
the date anterior to the take over is not the liability of the State Government and as such teaching
employees are not entitled to payment of pension from the public exchequer for the priod they
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9778414/ 14
The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Smt.Asha Sharma on 18 April, 2019
worked under the previous school prior to take over.
(26) In support of his contention, Mr. Anjani Kumar placed reliance on the judgment of the Apex
Court in the case of Chander Sain vs. State of Haryana & Ors. [AIR 1994 SC 972]. On closure
scrutiny, the decision in that case is not attracted in this case and it is distinguishable on fact. The
foundational facts are quite different. In that case, prior to take over, there was no scheme of
pension. The liability of the State Government was confined to 75% of the total deficit of the private
college Patna High Court L.P.A No.1568 of 2011 dt.18-04-2019 relating to salary and gratuity. The
Apex Court, in the aforesaid circumstances held that appellant is entitled to payment of gratuity and
not payment of pension before the date of take over as there was no pension available to the
employees of the non-government college.
(27) Mr. Kumar then placed reliance on the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of State of
Punjab & Ors. vs. Dev Dutt Kaushal & Ors. [1995 Supp (4) SCC 748]. Again, in this case, the
foundational fact was different. In that case, service rendered in the private college was not counted
for the purpose of grant of pension as there was no provision for pension in the private college.
Paragraphs- 9 to 14 of the said judgment is relevant for the purpose of the present issue and are
quoted hereinbelow for ready reference:-
"9. The facts of N.N. Swamy are the following: a private college known as "khallikote
College" was taken over by the government on and with effect from March 9, 1971. A
formal agreement was executed between the managing committee of the college and
the Governor of the State recording the terms and conditions of transfer. They
provided that the transfer of the college to the government was of all the assets of the
college but without any liability. The managing committee continued to be liable for
the outstanding liabilities, if any, of the college for which the government was not
liable. The six writ petitioners, (who were respondents before this Court) were all
Readers in different faculties in the said college on the date of taking over. They were
in the pay scale of Rs.510-860/- Patna High Court L.P.A No.1568 of 2011
dt.18-04-2019 and were actually drawing pay less than Rs.600- per month on the
date of take over. Two other, who were juniors (indeed one of them was only a
lecturer and not even a Reader) were in the pay scale of Rs.600-1000/- and were
drawing the pay of Rs.600/- or above on the date of take over. On March 23, 1971, the
government issued a circular containing conditions governing the taking over of the
services of the teaching staff of the said college. Para 5 of the said circular provided
that "adhoc appointments shall be issued to all Professors and such of the Readers in
position, who on the date of takeover were in receipt of pay of Rs. 600/- per month or
more, in the scale of pay Rs.600-1000/- against posts of Readers. Readers who on
the date of takeover were in receipt of pay of less than Rs.600/- per month and all
lecturers in position on that date shall be given adhoc appointment against the post
of lecturers in the scale of Rs.260-780/- with effect from the date of take over."
Pursuant to the said Para 5, appointment as Readers was denied to the said six petitioners on the
ground that they were drawing pay of less than Rs.600/- per month on the date of take over. Since
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9778414/ 15
The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Smt.Asha Sharma on 18 April, 2019
the adhoc appointment was not given to them as Readers on the said ground, their cases were also
not referred to the Public Service Commission for regular appointment as Readers. The said six
lecturers complained against the same by way of a writ petition in the Orissa High Court. Their
claim was examined by the High Court, as also by this Court, only with reference to the circular
dated March 23, 1971. This Court opined that the aforesaid Para 5 of the circular was arbitrary and
void being violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. It was pointed out that the stipulation that
Reader must be drawing pay of not less than Rs.600/- per month on the date of take over has no
nexus with the object underlying the prescription of qualifications. It was pointed out that the pay
scales in private institutions are generally lower than similar government Patna High Court L.P.A
No.1568 of 2011 dt.18-04-2019 institutions and that disqualifying a Reader from appointment to the
said category under the government only on the aforesaid ground was discriminatory. It was pointed
out that another Reader who was junior to all the said six writ petitioners was appointed as Reader
only because he was drawing a salary of Rs.660/- per month on the date of take over.
10. Another aspect dealt with in N.N. Swamy related to the computation of the period of qualifying
service, which contention appears to have been raised for the first time before this Court. The
submission was this: on July 30, 1970,i.e., prior to the taking over of the said college by the
government, the government had prescribed qualifications for appointment as a Reader. One of the
qualifications prescribed was "at least eight years of teaching experience as a lecturer"; the service of
the said writ petitioners in the category of lecturers rendered under the private management cannot
be taken into account and, therefore, they cannot be promoted as Readers since they have not put in
eight years service as lecturers under the government. With respect to this submission, the Court
question, this Court (Bench comprising Goswami and Shinghal, JJ. ) made the following
observations:
"When a fairly well-recognized institution, as in this case, run for more than a
century, is completely taken over by the Government for management, it is not
merely taking over the land and buildings, tables and chairs. It has to tackle, at the
same time, a human problem, that is to say, the fate of the teachers and the staff
serving that institution. The institution, with which we are concerned, was taken
over, by consent, as a going educational concern and it goes without saying that it
must be administered on sound lines having regard to quality, efficiency and progress
in all respects. It is understandable that the employees had Patna High Court L.P.A
No.1568 of 2011 dt.18-04-2019 to join the new service under the Government, for the
first time, and so could be, in that sense, fresh entrants. But to say that the teaching
experience of the Readers in the private institution is completely effaced to the extent
that they will not be even eligible, on the plea of absence of teaching experience in
Government service, for consideration for appointment as Readers is a seriously grim
issue. We feel assured that such an argument had not been canvassed by the State in
the High Court on the basis of the Rules of July 19, 1971. Since these Rules came into
force after the take over for which a separate circular had already been issued to take
care of the special exigency. Action under the Government circular of March 23, 1971,
alone, was in controversy in the High Court. The said circular took in recognition of
the service in the private and 10 in Annexure I).
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9778414/ 16
The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Smt.Asha Sharma on 18 April, 2019
The only differentia was, therefore, the salary drawn by the Readers on the date of
take over. That action based on the salary aspect under the said circular had to stand
the test of Article 16 in the High Court, as well as, before us. The argument in favour
of complete evasion of the past teaching experience in the private college, first time
presented before us, fails to take note of the distinction between eligibility and
suitability." (Emphasis added)
11. It is evident from the above except that the contention relating to eight years' service as a
prerequisite was urged for the first time before this Court and had not been urged before the High
Court. This Court, therefore, observed that the circular of March 23, 1971 provided for appointment
of only two Readers (juniors to the said six writ petitioners) only because they were in Patna High
Court L.P.A No.1568 of 2011 dt.18-04-2019 receipt of pay of Rs.600/- or above and disqualified the
said writ petitioners on the ground of drawing pay less than Rs.600/- and that once the said ground
of distinction is struck down as violative of Article 16, the plea of lack of teaching experience, argued
for the first time before this Court, should fail. It cannot, therefore, be said that this Court has ruled
that the service rendered under the private management should be taken into consideration. All that
it said is that denial of such service is "a seriously grim issue". But since there was no occasion for
pronouncing upon the said contention, no final opinion was expressed. The said decision, therefore,
does not support the case of the respondents herein.
12. Another case relied upon by the learned counsel for the respondents before us is the decision of
this Court in Chander Sain v. State of Haryana & Ors. (1994 (1) S.C.C.750). Having regard to Para 10
of the conditions subject to which the private institution was taken over and particularly in the light
of Para 3 of another memo dated March 28, 1979, this Court held that the government was bound to
take into account the service rendered by the teachers under the private management for the
purpose of calculating the gratuity payable. According to the orders in force prior to the taking over
of the said institution, the teachers in private colleges were entitled to same gratuity as was payable
to similar teachers in government service. Actually, the government was contributing seventy five
percent of the total deficit of the private colleges relating to salary, gratuity, etc. for the posts
approved by the government. The stand of the state of Haryana in that case was that teachers who
had retired before the take over alone were entitled to gratuity calculated on the basis of the service
rendered by them under the private management and not those who are absorbed in government
service and retired thereafter. Such a plea was held to be unacceptable. Since the said decision
turned on the particular facts and the language of the circulars concerned in that case, it is not Patna
High Court L.P.A No.1568 of 2011 dt.18-04-2019 necessary to set out the facts of the said decision.
13. For the above reasons, these appeals are liable to be allowed and are accordingly allowed
herewith. The judgment of the Division Bench is set aside and the judgment of the learned Single
Judge is restored. There shall be no order as to costs.
14. Before parting with this case, we must refer to a circumstance brought to our notice. It is stated
that in the year 1992, the Government of Punjab has framed a scheme under Rule 22-A of the
Punjab privately Managed Recognized Schools Employees (Security of Service) Rules, 1981 under
which scheme, it is stated by the learned counsel for the respondents, the teachers in the private
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9778414/ 17
The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Smt.Asha Sharma on 18 April, 2019
Schools taken over by the government are entitled to count their service under the private
management for the purpose of pension. We do not express any opinion on the said contention. It is
enough to observe that if any of the respondents in these appeals is entitled to any benefit under the
said scheme, he is entitled to claim the same according to law. It may also be in these appeals only,
Civil Appeal No. 1104 of 1995 pertains to a teacher in a school while in all other appeals pertain to
lecturers in colleges. The learned counsel asked us to clarify further that if in future the Government
of Punjab frames a scheme with respect to lecturers similar to the aforementioned scheme, this
judgment should not stand in the way. In our opinion, the said apprehension is wholly unfounded.
This judgment does not preclude the government from conferring such benefits as they may think
appropriate on the respondents and other similarly placed persons nor does this decision stand in
the way of such persons claiming the appropriate reliefs under such scheme, as and when framed."
(28) Mr. Anjani Kumar next placed reliance on the Patna High Court L.P.A No.1568 of 2011
dt.18-04-2019 judgment of the Apex Court in the case of State of Bihar vs. S A Hassan & Another
[2002 (2) PLJR (SC) 295]. It transpires from a close scrutiny of the said judgment that the judgment
instead of supporting the submission of the State runs contrary to the basic arguments advanced by
Mr. Anjani Kumar. Paragraphs- 7 to 11 of the said judgment are relevant and are quoted
hereinbelow for quick reference:-
"7. Sub-section (1) of Section 6 of the Act provides in clear and explicit terms that
from the date of the notification issued under sub-section (1) all members of the staff
employed in the college shall cease to be employees of the college body. The effect of
this provision is that the respondents ceased to be employees of the erstwhile
management of the college. At the same time, the proviso to the said sub-section (1)
declares that the staff employed in the college shall continue to serve in the college on
an ad hoc basis till a decision under sub- sections (3) and (4) is taken by the State
Government.
Therefore, both the respondents continued to serve the college on an ad hoc basis and as a result,
whatever the contract of employment which the employees had with the erstwhile Management,
came to an end. Thus, from the date of taking over the college, the respondents ceased to be
employees of the erstwhile management and they became employees of the State Government on an
ad hoc basis. This ad hoc appointment was subsequently regularized and, therefore, they became
permanent employees of the State Government. As on the date of taking over the college, the terms
of appointment between the erstwhile management and the respondents ceased to exist and they
became employees of the State Government on an ad hoc basis, they cannot Patna High Court L.P.A
No.1568 of 2011 dt.18-04-2019 claim any benefit for the service rendered by them in the college
while it was under private management, there being no specific provision to count the previous
service to any extent.
8. Mr. Raju Ramchandran, learned senior counsel appearing for the respondents has submitted that
the private management was liable to pay service benefits to the respondents such as pension etc.
and as the college was taken over by the State Government, this liability has passed on to the State
Government. In this connection learned senior counsel has drawn our attention to sub- section (3)
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9778414/ 18
The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Smt.Asha Sharma on 18 April, 2019
of Section 3 of the Act. The said sub- section reads as follows:-
"3.(3) All the liabilities and obligations of the College under any agreement or
contract entered into bonafide before the date of taking over shall devolve and shall
be deemed to have devolved on the State Government."
9. Sub-section (1) of Section 3 of the Act provides for the taking over of a private medical colleges by
issuing a notification and according to sub- section (2) of the said section whatever assets and
properties the college had, these would vest in the State Government and sub-section (3) provides
for devolution of all the liabilities and obligations of the College on the State Government. This
sub-section (3) would operate where the assets of the college were taken over by the State
Government in terms of sub-
section(1). According to the learned senior counsel for the respondents, these liabilities would also
include pension and other pensionary liabilities of the respondents while they were employees of the
college before it was taken over. But there is no material on record to show that the erstwhile
Management was liable for any pension or pensionary liabilities in relation to its employees.
Moreover, Section 6 which deals specifically with the subject of determination of Patna High Court
L.P.A No.1568 of 2011 dt.18-04-2019 terms and conditions of the teaching staff and other employees
of the college, but it does not mention anything about giving weightage of past service for any
purpose. There is also no order of State Government in this regard in terms of sub-section (3) of
Section 6. We, therefore, do not find any force in the contention of Mr. Raju Ramachandran, learned
senior counsel for the respondents.
10. Learned senior counsel for the respondents has submitted that the High Court by various
decisions has settled the position that the employees are entitled to get their pension and other
retiral benefits after counting their past service in the College prior to its taking over by the
Government and therefore on the principle of stare decisis this court may not reinterpret the Act
and upset the settled position. This contention has no force inasmuch as from the judgments made
available to us and the judgment of the learned Single Judge we find that there are conflicting
decisions of the High Court as stated earlier and, therefore, the present appeal has been filed.
11. Learned senior counsel for respondents has submitted that as the Act is completely silent on the
question of counting the previous service towards pension and in the absence of any specific
provision, there is a legitimate expectation of respondents to get their pension and other retrial
benefits after counting the past period of service in the college. There is neither factual nor legal
basis for such principle. The legislature in explicit and unambiguous terms has laid down in Section
6 of the Act that after taking over of the college the employees shall cease to be employees of the
erstwhile management and they shall continue as ad hoc employees of the Government till such
time as they are absorbed in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Act. Therefore, this
contention has no force."
Patna High Court L.P.A No.1568 of 2011 dt.18-04-2019 (29) The aforesaid judgment does not help
the appellant-State as it would be evident from the discussion in the preceding paragraphs that the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9778414/ 19
The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Smt.Asha Sharma on 18 April, 2019
State Government from time to time extended the benefits of pension, gratuity to the teaching and
non-teaching employees of the erstwhile private high school on the line of State Government
employee, particularly, in the light of letter dated 29.11.1978 and 30.8.1980.
(30) Mr. Anjani Kumar next relied upon the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of PEPSU Road
Transport Corporation, Patiala vs. Mangal Singh & Ors. [2011(11) SCC 702] to contend that
pensionary benefit admissible to employees shall be governed by the terms and conditions
encapsulated in the regulation and thus he submitted that petitioners are not entitled to the benefit
of pension counting the service from the date of grant of permission to establish the institution as
there was no statutory rules which confers such benefit.
(31) Mr. Anjani Kumar has also placed reliance on the judgment of the Division Bench of this Court
in the case of Madho Sharma vs. The State of Bihar & Ors. (CWJC No. 15725 Patna High Court L.P.A
No.1568 of 2011 dt.18-04-2019 of 2010 decided on 5.7.2013). While rejecting the claim for counting
pensionable service from the date of permission to establish the school the Division Bench in Madho
Sharma's case held that benefit is admissible from the date of recognition and not from the date of
grant of permission. The said decision of the Division Bench also weighed the Court while this
matter was referred to the Full Bench. The Court has placed reliance on the interpretation of the
Circular dated 25.11.1992 given by the learned Single Judge in the case of Arun Jha vs. The State of
Bihar & Ors. [CWJC No. 10726 of 2004 decided on 11.05.2005]. The judgment of the Division Bench
in the case of Madho Sharma (supra) was delivered on 5.7.2013 but that Division Bench has not
considered the two previous Division Benches judgment, one in the case of Shyam Kishore Singh vs.
The State of Bihar & Ors. [2007(2) PLJR 239] and another in the case of Gopal Jha vs. The State of
Bihar & Ors. [2009 (4) PLJR 396]. In addition thereto, it is to be noted here that the learned Single
Judge in the case of Arun Jha (supra) expressed contrary view in subsequent decision. In Arun Jha's
case the learned Single Judge regretted to apply the decision of another Single Judge on the ground
that provision of statutory circular were not brought to his notice. It is interesting to note here that
the Patna High Court L.P.A No.1568 of 2011 dt.18-04-2019 same Single Judge, who is the author of
the Arun Jha judgment interpreting the circular dt.15.1.1982 has take a different view after noticing
the resolution dated 18.7.1992 in the subsequent decision dated 10.1.2007 in the case of Dhrub Roy
vs. State of Bihar [2007(1) PLJR 769] and granted the benefit of pension from the date of grant of
permission to establish the school.
(32) Mr. Anjani Kumar next placed reliance on the judgment of Full Bench of this Court in the case
of State of Bihar & Ors. vs Bhagwan Singh [2014 (4) PLJR 229]. The judgment of the Full Bench on
construction of rules-56, 58 and 61 of the Bihar Pension Rules held that service rendered as daily
wage employees is not admissible as pensionable service. The aforesaid judgment is distinguishable
on facts. Firstly, that was case of daily wager and not regular employees. Secondly, there was no
issue that from the date of entry the service was pensionable one and there was no occasion for the
Full Bench to decide the interplay of rules- 203, 105 and 101 of the Bihar Pension Rules in the light
of the decision of the State Government dated 15.1.1982 and the letter of the State Government dt.
29.11.1978 and 30.8.1980.

(33) Mr. Anjani Kumar, learned AAG, after making submission that service from the date of take
over should be Patna High Court L.P.A No.1568 of 2011 dt.18-04-2019 counted for grant of pension
in terms of rules-58 and 60 of the Bihar Pension Rules as only the government employees who were
receiving salary from the government exchequer are entitled to the benefit of pension practically
conceded that the benefit of past service should be counted from the date of recognition as he has no
answer to the decision of Madho Sharma which was the basis of reference to the Full Bench.
(34) Per contra, Mr. Tej Bahadur Siongh, learned Senior Counsel, appearing on behalf of the writ
petitioners in CWJC No. 13563 of 2006 enlightened the Court about the entire scheme of the Act,
Rules and Notifications issued from time to time regulating the service conditions and also the
pension scheme. Mr. Singh submitted that it is true that no rule was framed under the 1974
Ordinance or 1976 Rules but in exercise of power under Article 162 of the Constitution of India
notifications have been issued from time to time by the State Government extending the benefit of
pension and counting of past service for the purpose of grant of pensionary benefit.
(35) Mr. Tej Bahadur Singh submitted that the Secondary Education Board under the 1974
Ordinance and 1976 Act was vested with the power of framing service conditions and in terms of the
power vested to the Board on Patna High Court L.P.A No.1568 of 2011 dt.18-04-2019 1.3.1977 the
Board took a decision to count service from the date of grant of permission to establish the
institution. Mr. Singh explained the objective behind the grant of permission to establish
educational institutions. He submitted that grant of permission to establish school was subject to
fulfillment of conditions for grant of recognition and under the scheme of the Ordinance and the Act
no school was allowed to be opened without prior permission of the State Government and one
cannot comprehend existence of any school without infrastructure. He submitted that in certain
cases schools were set up after appointment of teachers and then application was moved for grant of
permission so that regular teaching may be imparted along with permission to start school. Those
appointed teachers who were eligible for appointment in terms of existing norms continued in the
school and on the strength of the infrastructure and teaching facilities the schools obtaining
permission for establishment were granted recognition subsequently by the Board and as such they
(Teachers) are entitled to count their service from the date of grant of permission to establish school
and the benefit of past service is admissible from the date of grant of permission to establish the
institution was in fact accorded by the Board vide Patna High Court L.P.A No.1568 of 2011
dt.18-04-2019 letter dated 1.3.1977 and as such there is no question not to count service of such
teachers from the date of grant of permission as the Board has recognized the service from the date
of grant of permission and two annual increments were also admissible to such teachers vide letter
dated 1.3.1977.
(36) Adverting to the issue as to counting of service rendered in the previous school in terms of
protection available under Resolution dated 15.1.1982, he submitted that the State Government was
competent to relax the rules and condone the break in service and in terms of the rule 203 of
Pension Rules and in terms of scheme dated 15.1.1982 petitioner was entitled to benefit of
condonation in break in service. He submitted that petitioner of CWJC No. 13563 of 2006 is entitled
to counting of the entire service rendered not only in this school but in the previous school. He
submitted that once the benefit was available under the scheme dated 15.1.1982 the same cannot be

subsequently withdrawn. He referred to the judgment of the learned Single Judge of this Court in
the case of Dhrub Roy (supra) and also the judgment of the Division Bench in the case of State of
Bihar vs. Mostt. Shyam Pyari Devi & Ors. (LPA No. 1989 of 2010 decided on 9.11.2011) as well as the
judgment of the Division Bench in the Patna High Court L.P.A No.1568 of 2011 dt.18-04-2019 case
of Shyam Kishore Singh (supra). The relevant part of the judgment of the Division Bench in LPA No.
1989 of 2010 is quoted below for ready reference:-
"On merits, the learned counsel for the appellants very fairly submitted that the view
taken by the writ court is in accordance with the views taken by several Division
Bench judgments of this Court. However, he tried to rely upon Rule 21 of the Rules of
1983 to submit that the writ court should not have placed any reliance upon the
earlier circulars of 1975 and 1977 because Rule-21 makes a categorical provision for
supersession of all the earlier Rules and Orders framed by the State Government
from the date of coming into force of 1983 Rules covering the Nationalized High
Schools in respect of service condition. The submission does not have merits because
Rule 21 supersedes only the Rules or Circulars on the subject covered by those Rules.
The issue decided by 1975 and 1977 circulars relates to recognition of service of
teachers and employees of the High Schools before they had been taken over. For that
purpose the date of grant of permission for establishment and date of recognition
have been indicated which is relevant in the said circulars. This issue is not covered
by the 1983 Rules and hence, it cannot be said that the circulars could not have been
referred to and relied upon.
Learned counsel for the appellants also placed reliance upon Section 9 of the 1981 Act
providing for taking over of Management and Control of certain categories of
Secondary Schools. That Section reserves a power in the State Government to
determine the service condition of Head Master, teachers and non-teaching staff of
taken over Secondary School. Such power has no relevance so far as the issue of
length of service of teachers and the employees is concerned."
(37) Mr. Sharad Kumar Sinha, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner in CWJC No.
3486 of 2008 Patna High Court L.P.A No.1568 of 2011 dt.18-04-2019 has broadly adopted the
submission advanced by Mr. Tej Bahadur Singh and contended that benefit of condonation of break
in service once granted under the scheme dated 15.1.1982 cannot be taken away subsequently
without compliance of the principles of natural justice and fair play.
(38) In the conspectus of the discussion hereinabove, the Court has to ascertain the logic behind the
cut-off date. There is no dispute that every teacher and non- teaching employee became government
servant by operation of law under Section 4(2) of the Act with effect from 2.10.1980 or the date of
take over of the school. There is no dispute or discordant judicial pronouncement contrary to the
proposition that service of teachers and non-teaching employees have all pensionary benefits
admissible from the date of grant of recognition. The only rub in the instant case is whether service
should be counted from the date of grant of permission to establish the educational institution or
not. This concept of grant of permission to establish the educational institution was coined for the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9778414/ 22
The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Smt.Asha Sharma on 18 April, 2019
first time in the 1974 Ordinance. Prior thereto, there was no provision of opening any school without
prior permission. It was open for the private player to establish educational institution to impart
education. This scheme of Patna High Court L.P.A No.1568 of 2011 dt.18-04-2019 1974 Ordinance
was subsequently retained in Section 29 of the 1976 Act. It may be relevant to mention here that
under the Ordinance as well as under the Act there was specific condition enumerated for grant of
permission to establish high school and permission was only granted on fulfillment of the condition
for establishment of the school. Section 29 of the Ordinance which was retained in 1976 Act as
Section 31 is quoted below:-
fo/kky; [kksyus ds fy, vuqefr & ek/;fed fo/kky; rc rd ugh [kksys tk;saxsa vkSj u lapkfyr
gksxsa tc rd bl la;kstu ds fy, cksMZ ls iwoZ vuqKk izkIr u gks tk;A (39) It would be
appropriate to note here that the scheme of pension was introduced by way of triple
benefit scheme with effect from 1st April, 1962. The benefit of pension was admissible
to all non-government schools whether run by local bodies or private management.
Therefore, with the grant of permission to establish educational institution a teacher
or non-teaching employee was entitled to the benefit of pension as a matter of course
under the 1962 triple benefit scheme and 1964 triple benefit scheme. In the
Notification dated 4th September, 1964 while extending the benefit of pension by
improving the service condition, the State Government framed Rules in this regard
and benefit was also extended to the permanent members of the ministerial staff
serving in non-
Patna High Court L.P.A No.1568 of 2011 dt.18-04-2019 government elementary school other than
proprietary school whether run by local body or by private management would not only be entitled
to contributory provident fund but also pension and gratuity. Under the 1964 Rules, there was no
requirement that the school must be recognized school and thus the teachers of the school obtaining
permission to establish educational institution were entitled to the benefit of pension in terms of the
Rules framed by the State Government for triple benefit. As indicated, hereinabove, on 29.11.1978,
the State Government decided to grant benefit of pension, family pension, provident fund and
gratuity on the line of the employees of the State Government whose earlier age of retirement as 62
years by reducing to 58 years with effect from 1.4.1978, this benefit was available to those teaching
and non- teaching employees, who opted for benefit of the pension scheme of 29.11.1978 by
exercising option up to 31.12.1978. By subsequent Resolution dated 30.8.1980, the State
Government in continuation of the triple benefit scheme launched vide notification dated 4.9.1964
and 29.11.1978 has decided to relax Rules- 58, 60 and 79 of the Bihar Pension Rules. This aspect of
the matter was not considered by another Full Bench in the case of State of Bihar vs. Bhagwan Singh
(supra) on which Mr. Patna High Court L.P.A No.1568 of 2011 dt.18-04-2019 Anjani Kumar, learned
AAG, has placed reliance.
(40) On careful scrutiny, the Court finds fallacy in the submission of Mr. Anjani Kumar, learned
AAG, that pension admissible under the 1962 scheme or 1964 scheme as well as after coming into
force of the 1974 Ordinance and 1976 Act was not the liability of the State Government but it was a
private arrangement from the District Secondary Education Fund. However, Mr. Anjani Kumar
failed to explain the position that when the school was taken over and fund was retained by the State
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9778414/ 23
The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Smt.Asha Sharma on 18 April, 2019
Government then how the pre -2.10.1980 liability to pay pension, gratuity and provident fund can
be disowned by the State Government. While confronted on the scheme, on the definition under
2(anga) and Section 12 of the 1981 Act that the district secondary education fund is raised in similar
manner as District Secondary Education Fund used to be raised in 1974 Ordinance and 1976 Act and
there is no corresponding provision that the District Secondary Education Fund shall be used for
payment of pension, gratuity and provident fund in 1981, Mr. Anjani Kumar has no explanation to
the absence of statutory scheme of payment of pension from District Education Fund under the 1981
Act.
(41) Considering the totality of the fact, we are of Patna High Court L.P.A No.1568 of 2011
dt.18-04-2019 the considered view that the contentions advanced by Mr. Anjani Kumar that liability
to grant pension to employees of private school under the 1962 and 1964 scheme or 1974 or 1976
Ordinance and Act does not pass on to the State Government and there is no liability of the State
Government to grant pension, gratuity and provident fund to the teachers covered under the triple
benefit scheme prior to take over are misconceived. The Court on careful consideration of the entire
scheme of the Act and the notifications issued from time to time either for the purpose of counting
service or for extending the benefit of triple benefit scheme and pension, as indicated hereinabove,
is of the considered view that pension is admissible not only from the date of take over but from the
date of grant of permission to establish in view of the fact that the Board took a conscious decision
to count service from the date of grant of permission for establishment of the school. The decision of
the Secondary Board to count service from the date of grant of permission to establish secondary
school is saved by operation of Section 21 of the repeal and saving clause of the 1980 Ordinance and
once the action of the Board is saved it follows as a matter of corollary that service is to be counted
from the date of grant of permission to establish secondary Patna High Court L.P.A No.1568 of 2011
dt.18-04-2019 school for the purpose of pensionary benefits.
(42) Accordingly, we hold that teachers appointed prior to grant of permission shall reckon their
service from the date of grant of permission for establishment of the institution and their service
should be counted from that date for the benefit of pension.
(43) So far as the factual issues involved in CWJC No. 13563 of 2006 and CWJC No. 3486 of 2008
are concerned, the Court is of the view that directly the issues have not been referred for
adjudication but it has been referred to Full Bench as one of the issue was counting of service from
the date of permission to establish secondary education. We refrain to decide the other issues raised
in these writ applications as it would cause prejudice to either party and there is no conflicting
decision on the issue of condonation of break in service. Since there is no decision of the writ court,
this Court deems it fit and proper to remit CWJC Nos. 13563 of 2006 and 3486 of 2008 to be
adjudicated by the learned Single Judge in the light of our discussion and decision that service shall
count from the date of permission to establish secondary school in terms of 1974 Ordinance and
1976 Act.
In the result, LPA No.1568 of 2011 and LPA No. Patna High Court L.P.A No.1568 of 2011
dt.18-04-2019 1681 of 2013 are dismissed. All the decisions contrary to the view we have taken stand
over ruled.

(44) Before we part with, we hasten to add that the plethora of notifications issued from time to time
regulating service condition and lack of assistance in most of the cases led to conflicting decision of
the Benches. Divergence of opinion is also due to ignorance of notification occupying the field. In
our view, it would be appropriate for the State Government to frame exhaustive Service Condition
Rules instead of issuing one after another notifications so that conflict in the decision making and
adjudication may be obviated.
