the petitioner herein.
For Petitioner : Mr.Ravindran
for M/s.Chandran Karuppiah & Ramani
For Respondents : Mr. V.Prashanth Kiran,
Government Advocate (Taxes)
ORDER
(Order of the Court was made by R. MAHADEVAN, J.) The prayer made in this writ petition is to
issue a writ of certiorarified mandamus to call for the records pertaining to the proceedings of the
first respondent dated 15.03.2004 made in STA.No.776 of 2001, quash the same and consequently,
restore the order of the second respondent dated 03.05.2000 passed in A.P.CST No.165 of 1999 on
his file, which is in favour of the petitioner herein.
2.The facts leading to the filing of this writ petition are as follows:
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis The petitioner is a registered dealer on the file of
the third respondent.
During the assessment year 1997-98, they had effected purchases from the dealer
situated at Daman in the Union territory of Goa, Daman and Diu, who was exempted
from paying the tax for a period of 15 years from the date of registration by Gazette
notification bearing No.5.4.87 F in (R&C)(2) dated 20.04.1997 issued by the Union of
Territory of Goa, Daman & Diu and hence, has no requirement to issue 'E1'
declaration Form to the petitioner. In view of the same, the petitioner obtained Form
'C' declaration from its buyer and filed the same to the third respondent along with a
copy of the notification in support of its claim for exemption under section 6(2)(b) of
the CST Act. On scrutiny of the same, by an order of assessment dated 15.09.1999,
the third respondent, placing reliance on the Andhra Pradesh High Court decision in
the case of Sri Krishna Rice Mills reported in 104 STC 475, denied the exemption
claimed by the petitioner on the ground that both 'E1' Form and 'C' Form
declarations are mandatory and ultimately, levied tax at 4% on a turn over of
Rs.70,94,619/- on which the petitioner had claimed exemption on transit sale.
Challenging the same, the petitioner went on appeal before the second respondent,
who by order dated 03.05.2000, allowed the appeal and set aside the order of
assessment passed by the third respondent. Feeling aggrieved, the State has preferred
an https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis appeal in STA No.776/2001 before the first
respondent/ Tribunal. By order dated 15.03.2004, the Tribunal, after having held
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/59552677/ 2
M/S. Thamana Vinyl Traders vs The Tamil Nadu Sales on 3 December, 2021
that since the petitioner had not furnished Form E1 declaration, they could not be
granted exemption under section 6(2)(b) of the CST Act, 1956, allowed the appeal
filed by the State, thereby setting aside the order passed by the second respondent
and restoring the order passed by the third respondent. Therefore, the petitioner is
before this court by way of the present writ petition with the aforesaid prayer.
3.The only issue that arises for consideration in this writ petition is, whether Form 'C' and Form 'E1'
declarations are mandatory for claiming exemption under section 6(2) of the CST Act, 1956.
4.According to the learned counsel appearing for both sides, the issue involved herein is squarely
covered by the decision of this court in state of Tamil Nadu v. Chordia Electricals [(2000) 120 STC
34 Mad], wherein, it was held that “Form 'C' and Form 'E1' declarations are mandatory for claiming
exemption”. The relevant passage of the said decision is usefully extracted below:
“9.Section 3 of the CST Act prescribes the conditions on which the sale or purchase of
goods is deemed to take place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce. Section
3(b) of the CST Act provides that the sale shall be deemed to have taken place in
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis the course of inter-State trade or commerce when
the sale or purchase is effected during the movement of the goods from one State to
another and under Explanation 1 to Section 3 of the C.S.T. Act, where the goods are
delivered to a carrier or other bailee for transmission, the movement of the goods
shall, for the purposes of clause (b), be deemed to commence at the time of such
delivery and terminate at the time when delivery is taken from such carrier or bailee.
Section 6 of the C.S.T. Act imposes the liability to tax on inter-State sales of goods
other than electrical energy effected in the course of inter-State trade or commerce
during that year. Sub-section (2) of Section 6 of the CST Act grants exemption from
the levy of Central sales tax on inter-State sale, if the subsequent sale was effected
during the movement of goods from one State to another in favour of the
Government or to a registered dealer provided the conditions prescribed in
Sub-section (2) of Section 6 are complied with. Admittedly, it is not a case falling
under the second proviso to Sub-section (2) of Section 6 of the Act as the assessee has
not established that the sale of the goods was exempt under the provisions of the
TNGST Act or was subject to tax at a rate lower than 4 per cent. Therefore, the
assessee will be eligible to get exemption under Sub-section (2) of Section 6 of the
CST Act, if and only if the assessee satisfies the statutory conditions prescribed in the
first proviso to Sub-section (2) of Section 6 of the Act. One such condition is the
furnishing of C form and other condition is the furnishing of E-1 form. The assessee
has not filed the necessary C form inspite of several opportunities.
10. The next question that arises is on failure on the part of the assessee to produce C
form or to comply with the conditions prescribed in Sub-section (2) of Section 6 of
the C.S.T. Act, which is the State that has the power to levy the tax on the inter- State
sale. A clue to the question is found in the proviso to Section 9 of the C.S.T. Act.
Ordinarily, the State from which the movement of the goods commences is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/59552677/ 3
M/S. Thamana Vinyl Traders vs The Tamil Nadu Sales on 3 December, 2021
empowered to levy tax on inter-State sale of goods. However, under the proviso to
Section 9 of the C.S.T. Act in the case of a subsequent sale, in respect of same goods,
during the movement from one State to another, the State empowered to levy tax is
the State from which a registered https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis dealer has
obtained or could have obtained C form in connection with the purchase of goods.
The assessee-dealer, in this case, is the first purchaser and he could have obtained C
form from the State of Tamil Nadu and the State of Tamil Nadu has the jurisdiction
to levy sales tax. The view of the Appellate Tribunal that the State of Tamil Nadu has
no jurisdiction as the sale took place outside the State of Tamil Nadu is plainly
erroneous in law as the assessee being a registered dealer in Tamil Nadu could have
obtained C form from the State of Tamil Nadu, and since the assessee failed to fulfil
the conditions prescribed in Sub-section (2) of Section 6 of the Act, in the case of the
subsequent sale by the assessee to a dealer in Andhra Pradesh, the State of Tamil
Nadu has the requisite power and authority to levy and collect tax under the CST Act
in respect of the sale subsequent to the first sale. Our view arrived at on the
interpretation of the provisions of Sections 3, 6, 8 and 9 of the CST Act is supported
by several decisions of the High Courts of this country. ....
17. The uniform view taken by all the High Courts clearly establishes that under the proviso to
Section 9 of the C.S.T. Act, the assessee-dealer could have obtained C form from the State of Tamil
Nadu and since he failed to obtain necessary C form and produce the same before the authorities as
contemplated under Sub-section (2) of Section 6 of the Act, the State of Tamil Nadu has the
jurisdiction to levy tax under the CST Act. The Tribunal, however, completely omitted to take into
consideration the proviso to Section 9 of the C.S.T. Act for its conclusion that the State of Tamil
Nadu has no jurisdiction to levy the tax. We are, therefore, of the view that the view of the Appellate
Tribunal is plainly erroneous in law and under the provisions of Section 9, particularly the proviso
to Sub-section (1) of Section 9 of the Act, the State of Tamil Nadu is empowered to levy tax on the
subsequent inter-State sale effected by the assessee during transit from one State to another for his
failure to produce the C form and to comply with the conditions prescribed under Sub-section (2) of
Section 6 of the Act. Consequently, we hold that the order of the Appellate Tribunal that the State of
Tamil Nadu has no power to levy tax is erroneous in law and the order of the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Appellate Tribunal to that extent is liable to be set aside and
accordingly, it is set aside.”
5.Applying the ratio laid down in the aforesaid decision to the facts of the present case, wherein the
petitioner has to necessarily furnish Form E1 declaration so as to claim exemption on transit sales
under section 6(2)(i) of the CST Act. Admittedly, they did not produce 'E1' Form before the third
respondent. Since the petitioner did not fulfil the statutory conditions to claim exemption, we are of
the view that the third respondent / assessing officer as well as the first respondent / Tribunal were
justified in holding that the petitioner / assessee was not entitled to claim the exemption and the
turnover in question was to be taxed at the rate of 4 per cent.
6.In such view of the matter, this writ petition deserves to be dismissed and is accordingly,
dismissed. No costs.
