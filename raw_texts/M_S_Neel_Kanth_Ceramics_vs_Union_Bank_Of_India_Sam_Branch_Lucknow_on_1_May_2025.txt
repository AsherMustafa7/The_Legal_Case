3. At this stage, learned counsel for the petitioner states that petitioner is willing to pay the loan
amount in easy installments.
4. Learned counsel for the respondent Bank on behalf of the bank authorities states that if the
petitioner deposits 8 lakh rupees out of the defaulted amount, his request for payment of remaining
amount in installments would be considered.
5. Having regard to the fact that petitioner has offered to pay the entire amount due against him and
the statement made on behalf of the Bank, we are of the view that ends of justice would be served if
petitioner is granted an opportunity to deposit the entire outstanding amount. Accordingly, the writ
petition is disposed of with following conditions:-
(i) Petitioner shall deposit 8 lakh rupees out of the outstanding amount due till
31.5.2025.
(ii) In the event petitioner deposits the amount as indicated above, the respondent
Bank shall provide a fresh statement of loan account with interest upto date to the
petitioner. Respondent Bank shall thereafter provide a schedule for deposit of the
remaining amount in three equal bi-monthly installments.
(iii) In case petitioner complies with the above conditions, no recovery charges shall
be recovered from the petitioner by the respondent Bank.
(iv) Till the period prescribed for depositing the amount in terms of this order, the
recovery proceedings will be kept in abeyance. In case the petitioner defaults in
depositing initial amount or thereafter installments within the stipulated period, it
will be open for the respondent Bank to proceed with the recovery proceedings
against the petitioner, as per law.
