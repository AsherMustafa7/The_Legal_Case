Imphal West in Cril. Misc. (B) Case No. 259 of 2021 rejecting the prayer

(ii) pending admission, hearing and final disposal of the

Judicial Magistrate, Imphal West in Cril. Misc.(B)
Case No. 259 of 2021 and grant bail to the
Petitioner/accused or set free.
[3] The petitioner/accused was arrested in connection with FIR
No. 164(11)2021 SJM PS, U/s 354 IPC on 09.11.2021. On 10.11.20211,

[4] On 15.11.2021, the petitioner/accused filed a bail

Imphal West, Manipur and the Ld. CJM, Imphal West released the
petitioner/accused on interim bail vide order dated 09.12.2021 with the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/63035691/ 2
Mr. Lairenlakpam Bobo Singh vs The Officer-In-Charge on 14 August, 2024
following conditions that
(i) The accused/petitioner is directed not to do any illegal
activity, coerce or threaten witness or the complainant
or the family of the witnesses and complainant;
(ii) The accused shall appear before the court on
09.02.2022 in person before the court without fail;
(iii) The accused shall not threaten, contact or induce any
of the prosecution witnesses during the interim bail;
(iv) The accused shall make himself available for
interrogation by the Investigation Officer as and when
required;
(v) the accused shall not commit any offence in the future;
(vi) the accused shall not leave the State of Manipur without
prior permission of the Court and
(vii) the accused shall not temper or threat the witnesses or
the complainant respectively. However, on 09.02.2022
after hearing both the parties, Ld. CJM, Imphal West
passed impugned bail order thereby directing the
petitioner/accused to surrender before the
Superintended on Police, Manipur Central Jail-Sajiwa on
08.03.2022 holding that the nature of allegation is of
heinous crime against a young girl in the open street
and thus interim bail which is extended for another
Criminal Petition No. 3 of 2022 Page 3
month will not be further extended in any
circumstances.
[5] The learned counsel for the petitioner contended that as
per Section 41 and 41A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, arrest is not
mandatory in cognizable offences punishable with imprisonment upto
seven (7) years. Also it is a bounded duty of the magistrate that when an
accused person punishable with upto 7 (seven) years imprisonment is
produced before him, the magistrate should satisfy himself that the
application for remand by the police officer has been made in a bona fide
manner and the reasons for seeking remand mentioned in the case diary
are in accordance with the requirements of sections 41(1)(b) and 41A of
the Code of Criminal Procedure and there is concrete material in existence
to substantiate the ground mentioned for seeking remand and then only
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/63035691/ 3
Mr. Lairenlakpam Bobo Singh vs The Officer-In-Charge on 14 August, 2024
he should remand the accused in custody. But in the present case, the
application for remand fails to fulfill the requirements of sections 41(1)(b)
and 41A of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Ld. Chief Judicial
Magistrate, Imphal West, Manipur cancelled the bail application of the
petitioner/accused without applying his judicial mind. Being aggrieved by
the impugned bail order dated 09.02.2022 the petitioner/accused filed
the present petition.
And also, in support of his case, referred to the decision of
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Arnesh Kumar vs State of Bihar &Anr
[2014 (8) SCC 273] which reads as under;
Criminal Petition No. 3 of 2022 Page 4
"9. An accused arrested without warrant by the police has the
constitutional right under Article 22(2) of the Constitution of
India and Section 57, Cr.PC to be produced before the Magistrate
without unnecessary delay and in no circumstances beyond 24
hours excluding the time necessary for the journey. During the
course of investigation of a case, an accused can be kept in
detention beyond a period of 24 hours only when it is authorised
by the Magistrate in exercise of power under Section 167 Cr.PC.
The power to authorise detention is a very solemn function. It
affects the liberty and freedom of citizens and needs to be
exercised with great care and caution. Our experience tells us
that it is not exercised with the seriousness it deserves. In many
of the cases, detention is authorised in a routine, casual and
cavalier manner. Before a Magistrate authorises detention under
Section 167, Cr.PC, he has to be first satisfied that the arrest
made is legal and in accordance with law and all the
constitutional rights of the person arrested is satisfied. If the
arrest effected by the police officer does not satisfy the
requirements of Section 41 of the Code, Magistrate is duty bound
not to authorise his further detention and release the accused.
In other words, when an accused is produced before the
Magistrate, the police officer effecting the arrest is required to
furnish to the Magistrate, the facts, reasons and its conclusions
for arrest and the Magistrate in turn is to be satisfied that
condition precedent for arrest under Section 41 Cr.PC has been
satisfied and it is only thereafter that he will authorise the
detention of an accused. The Magistrate before authorising
detention will record its own satisfaction, may be in brief but the
said satisfaction must reflect from its order. It shall never be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/63035691/ 4
Mr. Lairenlakpam Bobo Singh vs The Officer-In-Charge on 14 August, 2024
based upon the ipse dixit of the police officer, for example, in
case the police officer considers the arrest necessary to prevent
such person from committing any further offence or for proper
investigation of the case or for preventing an accused from
tampering with evidence or making inducement etc., the police
officer shall furnish to the Magistrate the facts, the reasons and
materials on the basis of which the police officer had reached its
conclusion. Those shall be perused by the Magistrate while
authorising the detention and only after recording its satisfaction
in writing that the Magistrate will authorise the detention of the
accused. In fine, when a suspect is arrested and produced before
a Magistrate for authorising detention, the Magistrate has to
address the question whether specific reasons have been
recorded for arrest and if so, prima facie those reasons are
relevant and secondly a reasonable conclusion could at all be
reached by the police officer that one or the other conditions
stated above are attracted. To this limited extent the Magistrate
will make judicial scrutiny".

order dated 11.09.2023 of the High Court of Manipur.

This is to dispose of the bail application filed on behalf of the accused/petitioner
Lairenlakpam Bobo Singh praying for releasing him on bail u/s 437 Cr.P.C.
Bail objection report submitted by the I.O. of the case. Heard Ld. Counsel Shri L.
Manaobi on behalf of the accused an Ld. APP for the State M. Jamuna Devi through
video conference using Jitsi Meet App.
Criminal Petition No. 3 of 2022 Page 10 Perused the materials on record including
the bail objection report and the medical certificates of the wife of the
accused/petitioner.
Ld. Counsel for the accused submitted that the accused/petitioner is innocent to the
allegation charges leveled against him and that the charges leveled against him are
unfounded, false, fabricated and concocted ones.
Ld. Counsel for the accused also submits that the accused/petitioner is maintaining
the family with the meager income which he earns by doing odd job. It is also
submitted that the wife of the accused/petitioner is at an advanced stage of
pregnancy and the Expected Delivery Date (EDD) by ultrasound is 26/11/2022. As
such prays the court for letting the accused/petitioner on bail.
Ld. APP for the State, objecting to the bail petition of the accused/petitioner,
submitted that during the investigation of the case, it has been ascertained that the
accused/petitioner was drunk on the fateful day. It is submitted that the
accused/petitioner hit the victim girl so hard that the girl fell on the ground. It is also
submitted that when the girl got up and ran, the accused/petitioner chased her and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/63035691/ 9
Mr. Lairenlakpam Bobo Singh vs The Officer-In-Charge on 14 August, 2024
punched/kicked her four times at four different spots.
Ld. APP for the State also submitted that the offences committed by the
accused/petitioner is of serious nature. It is also submitted that the case is at its
initial stage and some PWs have to be examined to corroborate the materials against
the accused person and if the accused is released on bail, there is a high chance of
committing multiple similar cases in future and evidences and PWs of the case may
be hampered and tampered. As such, prays the court for rejecting the bail petition of
the accused in the interest of smooth investigation of the case.
On hearing and perusal, it is seen in the medical report of the wife of the accused
annexed with the application, that the wife of the accused is 29 weeks pregnant and
her expected delivery date by ultrasound falls on 26/01/2022 The said delivery date
is not exact and the actual delivery may happen before or after the said date.
Accordingly, considering the advantage of pregnancy of his wife, and that the support
and care of a husband is required during her stage of pregnancy, I am inclined to
consider the bail prayer of the accused leniently.
Hence, the accused/petitioner Lairenlakpam Bobo Singh, is released on interim bail
till 09-02-2022 from jail on his executing a P.R. Bond of Rs. 50,000/- with surety
bond of the like amount and on the following conditions that:
(i) the accused/petitioner is directed not to do any illegal activity, coerce or threaten
witnesses or the complainant or the family of the witnesses and complainants.
(ii) the accused shall appear before the court on 09-
02-2022 in person before the court without fail;

(iv) the accused shall make himself available for interrogation by the Investigation Officer as and
when required;
(v) the accused shall not commit any offence in the future;
(vi) the accused shall not leave the State of Manipur without prior permission of the Court; and

Mr. Lairenlakpam Bobo Singh vs The Officer-In-Charge on 14 August, 2024
It may be noted that this Court granted interim bail to the accused on the ground that
the wife of the accused was expecting a child any time soon as per the ultrasound
report. As per record submitted by the ld. Counsel for the accused, the wife of the
accused person delivered a baby boy on 15/01/2022 through caesarian and it is
further submitted that the wife of the accused is still bed-ridden and the service of the
accused person as a husband and also as a father to the new born baby after the
delivery is very much required at this juncture.
The ld. APP for the State submits that the crime/offences committed by the accused
is heinous in nature and also against a young innocent girl and therefore the interim
bail granted should not be extended further and be rejected so that the investigation
may continue smoothly.
Ld. Counsel for the accused submitted that the accused has religiously kept all 7
(seven) conditions imposed by this Court thereby he is no longer threat to the society
as a whole and also to the victim in particular and prayed that the interim bail
granted by this Court be made absolute.
I have perused the documents submitted by the accused person showing the place
and date of delivery of his son and also considered the submissions of the ld.
Counsels for the accused as well as the State.
Considering the fact that the wife of the accused underwent a caesarian operation
which at times longer time for the patient to recover and also considering the fact
that a bed ridden mother may find difficult to take care of the needs of the newly born
child, this Court is of the considered view that on humanitarian ground the interim
bail for the accused person may be extended for another month i.e. till 08/03/2022.
The 7 (seven) conditions imposed in the order dated 9/12/2021 will still continue.
It may be made clear that this Court has not taken lightly of the nature of allegation
made against the accused person of committing such heinous crime against a young
girl in the open street. Thus, the interim bail which is extended for another month
will not be further extended in any circumstances. The bail bond and surety bond
submitted by the accused person in the previous may be made good for the 2nd
interim bail also.
The accused person is to surrender himself before the S.P., MCJ-Sajiwa on
08/03/2022 before 12:00 noon.

and pulling her hair. His thorough interrogation is very much require to dig out the
true facts of the case.
In the light of the above fact and circumstances, the Hon'ble CJM/IW is prayed

Mr. Lairenlakpam Bobo Singh vs The Officer-In-Charge on 14 August, 2024
1. Lairenlakpam Bobo Singh (33) years S/o Lairenlakpam Kulachandra Singh Of
Kakwa Laiphrakpam Leikai, P.O. & P.S. Singjamei I/W District, Manipur
Dated/Imphal The 10th Nov., 2021.
Yours sincerely Sd/-
(W/S.I. Y. Indubala Devi) Of Singjamei-PS/IW"
[10] On combined perusal of the above referred notification dated 11.09.2023 and the
Hon'ble Supreme Court's order passed in Arneshkumar v. State of Bihar & Anr.
[(2014) 8 SCC 273] (supra) and orders dated 09.12.2021 & 09.02.2022 of the Ld.
CJM, Imphal West and remand prayer dated 10.11.2021, I am of the considered view
that the allegation made above by the learned counsel for the petitioner cannot be
taken as true, as Section 41(1)(b) is applicable in the present case as on perusal of the
above mentioned remand prayer, it is specifically mentioned that the I.O. registered
the FIR on credible information Criminal Petition No. 3 of 2022 Page 15 received
from the victim girl who is only 17 years old and further, the I.O.
made the remand prayer on a reasonable suspicion that the accused/petitioner has
committed a cognizable offence.
[11] On careful perusal of Section 41A, it is seen that the instant case does not fall
under Section 41A; but under Section 41(1)(b).
[12] Mention is made here that the learned counsel for the petitioner failed to annex
the first remand order of remanding the accused in police custody because only after
perusal of the said first remand order, this Court will find out whether the allegation
made herein that the magistrate failed to comply with the provision laid down under
Section 41 and Section 41A. Further perusal of the orders dated 09.12.2021 &
09.02.2022 of the Ld. CJM, Imphal West, this Court is of the view that the Ld. CJM,
Imphal West passed the said orders after due application of mind and by complying
the provision of law.
[13] The learned counsel for the petitioner further contended that offence alleged
upon the petitioner/accused by the prosecution is not a heinous offence. He further
submitted that in Shilpa Mittal vs State NCT of Delhi [(2020) 2 SCC 787], the
Hon'ble Supreme Court of India described heinous offence as "only those offences
which prescribe minimum sentence of seven years or more can be regarded as
heinous offences. Offence not providing minimum sentence of seven years cannot be
treated as heinous offences". He has further submitted Criminal Petition No. 3 of
2022 Page 16 that during the interim bail period the petitioner/accused did not
violate any conditions imposed upon him.

Mr. Lairenlakpam Bobo Singh vs The Officer-In-Charge on 14 August, 2024
[15] That allegation against the present petitioner cannot be regarded as not heinous
offence as the stage of the investigation which is at early stage, and top of that, the
accused/petitioner was remanded only for short period, thereafter the Ld. CJM,
Imphal West granted interim bail and thereafter, extended for another 1(one) month
vide order dated 09.02.2022 extracted above.
[16] Thereafter, the petitioner impugned the said order dated 09.02.2022 and this
Court vide order dated 04.03.2022 suspended the order of the Ld. CJM, Imphal West
and the same is extended from time to time. In this situation, the petitioner's citation
of the above mentioned the Hon'ble Supreme Court's order is not applicable.
[17] On 20.05.2022, learned counsel for the State respondent filed affidavit in
opposition narrating the whole story of the said incident and he further stated that
the interim order was granted only on the ground that his wife was 29 weeks
pregnant and her expected delivery dated was coming soon and also considering the
fact that care of a husband is required during that period of pregnancy, interim bail
till 09.02.2022 was granted upon furnishing a P.R bond of Rs. 50,000/- only with
surety bond of the light amount and with some conditions. He further submits that
the Ld. CJM, Imphal has rightly held that the crime committed by the
petitioner/accused against a young girl in the open Criminal Petition No. 3 of 2022
Page 17 street is a heinous crime. He further submits that the investigation of the case
is in full swing.
[18] The learned counsel for the State respondent further submits that during the
period of interim bail the petitioner/accused might have not violated the conditions
imposed upon him, however, it cannot be said that the petitioner/accused will never
commit any crime in future. He further submits that during the course of
investigation, many of the PWs who know the petitioner/accused have disclosed in
their statements before the I.O that the petitioner/accused is of a ferocious character
who beats and assaults the people without proper reason but of a GUNDAISM
nature. He further submits that in a catena of cases this Hon'ble High Court as well as
the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India held that "Personal liberty cannot be taken away
except in accordance with the procedure established by law. Personal liberty is a
constitutional guarantee. However, Article 21 which guarantees the above right also
contemplates deprivation of personal liberty by procedure established by law. Under
the criminal laws of this country, a person accused of offences which are non-bailable
is liable to be detained in custody during the pendency of trial unless he is enlarged
on bail in accordance with law.
Such detention cannot be questioned as being violative of Article 21 since the same is
authorized by law". Further, it is submitted that in a number of cases, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court of India as well as this Hon'ble High Court held that "While deciding
the cases on facts, more so in criminal cases the court should bear in mind that each
case must rest on its own Criminal Petition No. 3 of 2022 Page 18 facts and the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/63035691/ 15
Mr. Lairenlakpam Bobo Singh vs The Officer-In-Charge on 14 August, 2024
similarity of facts in one case cannot be used to bear in mind the conclusion of fact in
another case. It is also a well-established principle that while considering the ratio
laid down in one case, the court will have to bear in mind that every judgment must
be read as applicable to the particular facts proved or assumed to be true since the
generality of expressions which may be found therein are not intended to be
expositions of the whole of the law, but are governed and qualified by the particular
facts of the case in which such expressions are to be found.
A case is only an authority for what it actually decides, and not what logically follows
from it."
[19] On 14.07.2022, learned counsel for the petitioner filed rejoinder affidavit in reply to the
affidavit in opposition filed by the respondent by denying all other averments made by the
respondent except those which are specifically admitted in the rejoinder affidavit.
Learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that there is no medical reports to support the
plea of the respondent in regard to the statements that "the present petitioner physically assaulted
the complainant by punching and slapping on her face, head and pull her hair as a result she felt on
the ground and the petitioner repeatedly punch, kick on her head by grabbing her hair with his tide
grip". He further submits that the present FIR is the only FIR registered against him till date and the
petitioner/accused has never committed any crime/offence in his past life and the
accusation/allegation is unfounded, false, fabricated, concocted and without any basis.
Criminal Petition No. 3 of 2022 Page 19 The grounds taken herein are not sustainable as this Court
vide order dated 04.03.2022 suspended the order of the 09.02.2022 and as per the submission of
the learned PP, the investigation was not taken further.
[20] On perusal of record, it is seen that vide order dated 04.03.2022, this High Court has
suspended the order dated 09.02.2022 passed by the Ld. CJM, Imphal West, Manipur in Cril (B)
Case No. 259 of 2021 and the said suspension order has been extended from time to time till date.
Again on 22.09.2022, learned PP seeks time to ascertain whether the petitioner was complying with
the bail conditions and also the status of the investigation, accordingly further time was granted.
However, till date learned PP has not submitted the status report of the investigation.
Instead, the learned PP submits that after the suspension of the order of the Ld. CJM, the
investigation cannot be taken further.
Operative portion of the order dated 04.03.2022 reads as follows:
"The order dated 09.02.2022 passed by the Ld. CJM, Imphal West, Manipur in Cril
(B) Case No. 259 of 2021 shall stand suspended till then."
[21] In the facts and circumstances of the case and discussions made above, the present petition
filed by the petitioner has no merit and there is no ground for interference with the order dated
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/63035691/ 16
Mr. Lairenlakpam Bobo Singh vs The Officer-In-Charge on 14 August, 2024
09.02.2022 of the Ld. CJM, Imphal West as the Ld. CJM passed the said order after due
consideration of the facts and law.
Criminal Petition No. 3 of 2022 Page 20
[22] Accordingly, the present Cril. Petition is dismissed with
direction that the petitioner is to surrender before the I.O. of the case within 10 (ten) days from the
date of receipt of a copy of this order.

Manipur.
