UP-75M-1743 at Asanpur Kupha Koshi Mahasetu Toll Tax on which the owner Ali Ahamad (the
appellant), Sunil Kumar/the appellant (driver) and Sri Ram Kishore (Khalasi) were travelling. The
learned Trial Court has found that after completion of all the legal formalities and also serving
notices under Section 50 the seized goods was weighed and the total gross weight of the seized
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/178415598/ 4
Sunil Kumar vs The State Of Bihar Through D.R.I., Patna on 5 October, 2025
contraband was 6276 grams and net weight of 6075 grams. The sample of the recovered contraband
article was examined by the Narcotic Kit and the same was found to be Heroin. Statements of
accused Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.349 of 2023 dt. 17-10-2025 were taken under Section
67 of the N.D.P.S. Act. The arrested accused did not produce any valid paper regarding the seized
article. The seized article was sent to C.R.C.L., New Delhi for its examination and it was found to be
"Diacetyl Morphine Heroin". Sections 42 and 50 of the N.D.P.S. Act were fully implemented during
seizure. The prosecution has successfully proved the case under Section 21(C) of the N.D.P.S. Act
against the appellants. Md. Nafees, another accused, he was not arrested at the place of occurrence
and it was found that prosecution has failed to prove the charge against him. Therefore, Md. Nafees
was acquitted under Section 21(C) of the N.D.P.S. Act giving benefit of doubt.
Submissions on behalf of the appellants:
11. Learned counsel for the appellants submits that the prosecution witnesses are all members of the
raiding team and there is contradictory statement of all the witnesses and their statements are not
consistent with each other. It has been submitted that though the seizure has been made at Asanpur
Kupha Koshi Mahasetu Toll Tax, however, the seizure list was prepared in the D.R.I. Office and two
persons were brought to the said place to be made witness. However, conspicuously the said
witnesses were not examined and even the prosecution Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.349 of
2023 dt. 17-10-2025 witnesses have not disclosed the name of the said seizure list witnesses.
Learned counsel for the appellants submits that the appellants were not apprised of their right for
being searched before a Gazetted Officer or a Magistrate nor they were brought before the Gazetted
Officer or a learned Magistrate for search and therefore the provisions of Section 50 of the N.D.P.S.
Act was not followed. The learned counsel for the appellants has further stated that sample of the
seized goods was sent for chemical examination to the Central Revenue Control Laboratory, New
Delhi but the chemical analyst has not been examined in this case and thereby the case of the
defence has been seriously prejudiced.
12. The learned counsel for the appellants has further submitted that the mandatory provisions of
Sections 41, 42, 52 and 57 of the N.D.P.S. Act have not been complied with. It has been submitted
that the statement of the appellants recorded at D.R.I., Patna has not been read over and explained
to them rather the appellants were forced to put their signatures on blank paper as has been
submitted by the appellant, Ali Ahamad in his deposition as D.W. 4.
13. The learned counsel for the appellants submits that nothing has been recovered from the actual
physical Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.349 of 2023 dt. 17-10-2025 possession of the
appellants and the recovered contraband Heroin does not belong to the appellants. The learned
counsel for the appellants has drawn the attention of this Court towards the fact that the case under
Sections 23, 25 and 29 of the N.D.P.S. Act was not proved by the prosecution and hence the
appellants were acquitted under the aforesaid Sections. Thus, drawing an inference that the present
prosecution is false and concocted, it has been stated by the learned counsel for the appellants that
the learned Trial Court has failed to appreciate and consider that the evidence which is on record
suffers from serious infirmities and legal credibility in order to inspire confidence and therefore no
reliance could be placed on the same in convicting the appellants.

Sunil Kumar vs The State Of Bihar Through D.R.I., Patna on 5 October, 2025
14. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that at the time of sampling six packets were
prepared while three packets were kept with P.W. 3, Binod Kumar Mandal and the samples which
were sent for chemical examination was sent after three days which itself raises doubt over the
veracity of the prosecution case. It has been pointed out that the provisions of Section 52(3) of the
N.D.P.S. Act has not been followed which provides that every person arrested and article seized
under sub- Section 2 of Section 41, 42, 43 or 44 shall be forwarded without Patna High Court CR.
APP (DB) No.349 of 2023 dt. 17-10-2025 unnecessary delay to the officer empowered under Section
53 or the Officer-in-Charge of the nearest police station. It has been argued that the sampling was
not done at the spot but at the office of the D.R.I. and admittedly not in the presence of a Magistrate.
It has been submitted that the Dy. Director who received the secret information had not been
examined and so are the Panch witnesses, who also have been left out.
15. Learned counsel for the appellants citing the judgment of Bharat Aambale vs. the State of
Chhattisgarh (2025) SCC Online 110 has submitted that considering the facts of the case
non-compliance of Section 52(A) has rendered the conviction as bad and thus cannot be sustained.
16. The learned counsel for the appellants has also relied upon a non-reportable judgment passed in
the case of Yusuf @ Asif in Criminal Appeal No. 3191 of 2023 (arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 3010 of
2023), wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed that in absence of any material on record
that the samples of seized contraband were drawn in the presence of the Magistrate and that the
inventory duly certified by the Magistrate, it is apparent that the seized contraband would not be a
valid piece of primary evidence in the trial and therefore the trial as a whole would vitiate. Patna
High Court CR. APP (DB) No.349 of 2023 dt. 17-10-2025
17. The learned counsel for the appellants has submitted that in view of the non-observance of the
mandatory provisions of the N.D.P.S. Act as also non-examination of important witnesses of the
seizure-memo the present conviction of the appellants cannot be sustained and therefore they may
be acquitted of the charges.
Submissions on behalf of the D.R.I. :
18. Mr. Anshuman Singh, learned Senior Standing counsel for the respondent (D.R.I.) submits that
the seizure of the contraband goods from the Truck from which the two appellants were
apprehended is not disputed. It has been submitted that in the statements recorded under Section
67 of the N.D.P.S. Act the appellant, Ali Ahamad has admitted that the recovered Heroin (Narcotic
Substance) was loaded in his Truck at Nallapada in Guwahati (Assam) and the same was to be
delivered to Md. Nafees at Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. The apprehended persons have admitted that
the three packets of Heroin were loaded in his Truck on the direction of Md. Nafees. The learned
counsel for the D.R.I. has further submitted that in follow-up action, the D.R.I., Zonal Unit,
Lucknow conducted a raid at the address of the accused Md. Nafees who in his statement recorded
under Section 67 of the N.D.P.S. Act has Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.349 of 2023 dt.
17-10-2025 admitted his involvement in smuggling of 3 packets at Rs. 18,22,50,000/- which was
seized by the D.R.I., Patna.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/178415598/ 6
Sunil Kumar vs The State Of Bihar Through D.R.I., Patna on 5 October, 2025
19. It has further been submitted that the witnesses who have been examined on behalf of the
prosecution have been consistent and there is no material contradictions in their statements. It has
been submitted that all the officers involved in the operation and who were present at the time of
seizure had been examined as prosecution witnesses and therefore, there was no shortcoming as far
as evidence with regard to search and seizure is concerned. It has been submitted by the counsel for
the D.R.I. that the ground taken by the appellants of non- preparation of seizure list at the spot is
not tenable as the Truck was intercepted at around 02:00 hours and 1200 Kgs. of rice bran was
loaded on the Truck and it was not humanly possible to search the Truck at the night and hence the
same was brought along with the apprehended persons to the office of D.R.I., Patna and the
examination, recovery and seizure were made in presence of the three accused and independent
witnesses.
20. It has been submitted that the accused persons have admitted their involvement in the
concealment of the three packets of Heroin in a secret cavity in the Truck and the appellant, Ali
Ahamad being the owner of the said Truck and Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.349 of 2023 dt.
17-10-2025 driver by profession cannot deny his involvement in the present case.
21. The learned counsel for the D.R.I. has further pointed out that the details of the independent
witnesses were part of the Panchnama and the same has been placed on record. It has also been
submitted that the signatures of the independent witnesses were there on the seizure-memo along
with the signatures of the accused and seizing officer and therefore the contention of the appellants
that name of the independent witnesses were not disclosed is not correct and thus such plea is not
tenable in law. It has been stated that the appellants had consented in writing about their
willingness to be searched before the departmental Gazetted Officer as mandated under Section 50
of the N.D.P.S. Act and hence the contention of the appellants that provisions of Section 50 of the
N.D.P.S. Act has not been followed is far-fetched.
22. The learned counsel for the D.R.I. has pointed out that the chemical report of the C.R.C.L., New
Delhi was brought on record and the findings were clearly documented and the same had been
considered by the learned Trial Court and therefore non-examination of the Chemical Analyst would
not prove fatal to the prosecution case.
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.349 of 2023 dt. 17-10-2025
23. The learned counsel for the D.R.I. has relied upon the following judgments rendered by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court of India:
(1) AIR 2023 SC 4684 (2) (2019) 10 SCC 649 (3) (2021) 10 SCC 100 (4) (2025) 5 SCC
155
24. The learned counsel for the D.R.I. has thus summarized his submissions that the statutory
provisions of the N.D.P.S. Act has been directly complied with. It has been submitted that the
confessions were made voluntarily and corroborated with forensic evidence, confirming the identity
of the seized contraband. The chain of evidence remains consistent and undisputed and there is no
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/178415598/ 7
Sunil Kumar vs The State Of Bihar Through D.R.I., Patna on 5 October, 2025
possibility that the narcotics substance could have been planted in order to implicate the appellants.
It has been pointed out that the certification of the inventory was made by the Magistrate and
sampling was done and the said certificate has been exhibited without any objection by the defence.
It has lastly been submitted that the entire complaint has been exhibited which contains all the
relevant documents and therefore, the claim of the appellants of non- observance of the provisions
of the N.D.P.S. Act does not have Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.349 of 2023 dt. 17-10-2025
any legs to stand and therefore, the conviction and sentence of the appellants deserves to be upheld,
as there is no illegality in the finding arrived at by the learned Trial Court.
Consideration:
25. We have consider the rival submissions canvassed by the learned counsel for the parties and
have also gone through the evidence produced by the parties before the learned Trial Court.
26. From the perusal of the records, it would appear that the present case initiated on the basis of a
secret information dated 29.08.2017 given by the Intelligence Officer namely Rakesh Ranjan (P.W.

three packets of Heroin was recovered which were marked as Sl. No. I to III and on weighing it was
found to be total gross weight 6276 grams and net weight of 6075 grams. The sample of the
recovered contraband article was examined by the Narcotic Kit and found to be Heroin. Thereafter,
the sample of 5 grams each of 2 - 2 samples from all three packets were prepared and marked as A1,
A2, B1, B2, C1 and C2 respectively. The worth of the seized article was valued at Rs. 18,22,50,000/-.
Thereafter, the seizure list was prepared on which all three apprehended accused persons and
witnesses were put their signatures.
27. The informant, Binod Kumar Mandal was examined as P.W. 3 and he has stated in his
deposition that he got an information from his Senior Intelligence Officer that a consignment of
Heroin was coming from Assam and was being taken to Lucknow and on such information a team

has stated that three persons were apprehended who disclosed their names as Sunil Kumar

physically however nothing was recovered from their physical possession. He has deposed that when
the plan to search the vehicle was made, the appellants admitted that there was Heroin loaded on
the Truck which they were carrying from Guwahati to Lucknow. He has categorically stated that as it
was too late in the night they took the vehicle along with the apprehended accused persons to the

thoroughly searched and one secret cavity was found on the hood of the Truck which was fastened
with nut-bolts. On opening, three brown packets were recovered to which all the apprehended
persons admitted the same to be Heroin and the same were weighed and two samples each of 5
grams was prepared from the three packets which was seized Patna High Court CR. APP (DB)

28. P.W. 1/Ashok Kumar was an Intelligence Officer posted at the relevant time at D.R.I., Patna. He
in his deposition has also supported the prosecution case reiterating the facts as stated in the FIR as
well as P.W. 3 in his examination-in-chief. The defence during the cross- examination has not been
able to bring out something which would doubt the credibility of his evidence as well as any Patna
High Court CR. APP (DB) No.349 of 2023 dt. 17-10-2025 fact contrary to what had been stated in
the FIR or by the other witnesses.
29. P.W. 2/Rakesh Ranjan is a Senior Intelligence Officer, D.R.I., Patna who too in his

Sunil Kumar vs The State Of Bihar Through D.R.I., Patna on 5 October, 2025
32. P.W. 7/Jagat Narayan happens to be the godown in-charge, Custom Headquarter, Patna, who in
his deposition has stated that the seized goods were kept in the godown after making of an inventory
upon which his signature was there along with that of Binod Mandal. During his cross-examination
he has stated that whatsoever seized goods is deposited in the godown and entry is made in the
register which he had not brought to the court.
33. The defence has also examined four witnesses. However, the same is not relevant for the present
appellants.
34. On the point of search and seizure and non- compliance of Sections 42 and 50 of N.D.P.S. Act, it
has been noted that P.W. 3, Binod Kumar Mandal was consistent in his Patna High Court CR. APP
(DB) No.349 of 2023 dt. 17-10-2025 testimony and the said fact was supported by P.W. 2, Rakesh
Ranjan, who had also given the exact description of the search and seizure after due compliance like
notice under Section 50 of the N.D.P.S. Act and therefore it could not be inferred that there was any
false implication being made.
35. We are reminded of the judicial pronouncements made by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in State of
Punjab vs. Balbir Singh (1994) 3 SCC 299 wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court in paragraph -18 has
observed:
"18. Under the Act wide powers are conferred on the officers and deterrent sentences
are also provided for the offences under the Act. It is obvious that the legislature
while keeping in view the menace of illicit drug trafficking deemed it fit to provide for
corresponding safeguards to check the misuse of power thus conferred so that any
harm to innocent persons is avoided and to minimise the allegations of planting or
fabricating by the prosecution, Section 50 is enacted."
36. In the present case, the records confirms that witnesses, who had accompanied the search
(P.Ws. 2 and 3) were consistent in their statements with regard to search and seizure. We have also
noticed that there were independent witnesses who were taken along by the officers however they
were not examined during the course of trial but the seizure- memos and Panchnama contained
their signatures and that of Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.349 of 2023 dt. 17-10-2025 the
appellants. No evidence of tampering and procedural irregularity has been found.
37. However, in the present case we have seen that not only notice under Section 50 of the N.D.P.S.
Act was served, the recovery was made from the Truck and for the search of the same there was no
application of Section 50 of the Act.
38. Thus, in view of above, there is no ambiguity or illegality as far as search and seizure is
concerned.
39. We shall now go on to analyze the factum of possession and the knowledge of the presence of
narcotics substance on the Truck by the appellants during the search and seizure made by the D.R.I.
We have seen that P.W. 2 and P.W. 3, who were the officers who had conducted the search, they
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/178415598/ 10
Sunil Kumar vs The State Of Bihar Through D.R.I., Patna on 5 October, 2025
have deposed that nothing was recovered from the personal physical possession of the appellants
rather on their disclosure the narcotics substance was recovered from the secret cavity of the Truck.
The other prosecution witnesses have supported the said fact and therefore as far as the possession
and knowledge of the narcotics substance being carried on the Truck is concerned, the same was
well within the knowledge of the appellants and as we are aware by the various judicial
pronouncements that constructive possession under N.D.P.S. Act exists to control of Patna High
Court CR. APP (DB) No.349 of 2023 dt. 17-10-2025 the place or vehicle containing the narcotics and
such possession is sufficient under the N.D.P.S. Act as it includes control over the container where
the contraband was found, even if the accused was not physically holding the substance. The
appellants' signature on judicial documents and persons at the place of interception, has testified by
P.W. 2 and P.W. 3 establishes constructive possession beyond reasonable doubt.
40. At this juncture, we take note of the observation made by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case
of Union of India vs. Md. Nawaj Khan, reported in (2021) 10 SCC 100, as contained in paragraph- 25
and 26 :
"25. We shall deal with each of these circumstances in turn. The respondent has been
accused of an offence under Section 8 of the NDPS Act, which is punishable under
Sections 21, 27-A, 29, 60(3) of the said Act. Section 8 of the Act prohibits a person
from possessing any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance. The concept of
possession recurs in Sections 20 to 22, which provide for punishment for offences
under the Act. In Madan Lal v. State of H.P. [Madan Lal v. State of H.P., (2003) 7
SCC 465 : 2003 SCC (Cri) 1664] this Court held that : (SCC p. 472, paras 19-23 & 26)
"19. Whether there was conscious possession has to be determined with reference to
the factual backdrop. The facts which can be culled out from the evidence on record
are that all the accused persons were travelling in a vehicle and as noted by the trial
court they were known to each other and it has not been explained or shown as to
how they travelled together from the same destination in a vehicle which was not a
public vehicle.
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.349 of 2023 dt. 17-10-2025
20. Section 20(b) makes possession of contraband articles an offence. Section 20
appears in Chapter IV of the Act which relates to offences for possession of such
articles. It is submitted that in order to make the possession illicit, there must be a
conscious possession.
21. It is highlighted that unless the possession was coupled with the requisite mental
element i.e. conscious possession and not mere custody without awareness of the
nature of such possession, Section 20 is not attracted.
22. The expression "possession"
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/178415598/ 11
Sunil Kumar vs The State Of Bihar Through D.R.I., Patna on 5 October, 2025
is a polymorphous term which assumes different colours in different contexts. It may carry different
meanings in contextually different backgrounds. It is impossible, as was observed in Supt. &
Remembrancer of Legal Affairs, W.B. v. Anil Kumar Bhunja [Supt. & Remembrancer of Legal
Affairs, W.B. v. Anil Kumar Bhunja, (1979) 4 SCC 274 : 1979 SCC (Cri) 1038] to work out a
completely logical and precise definition of "possession" uniform[ly] applicable to all situations in
the context of all statutes.
23. The word "conscious" means awareness about a particular fact. It is a state of mind which is
deliberate or intended.
26. Once possession is established, the person who claims that it was not a conscious possession has
to establish it, because how he came to be in possession is within his special knowledge. Section 35
of the Act gives a statutory recognition of this position because of the presumption available in law.
Similar is the position in terms of Section 54 where also presumption is available to be drawn from
possession of illicit articles."
"26. What amounts to "conscious possession" was also considered in Dharampal
Singh v. State of Punjab [Dharampal Singh v. State of Punjab, (2010) 9 SCC 608 :
(2010) 3 SCC (Cri) 1431], where it was held that the knowledge of possession of
contraband has to be gleaned from the facts and circumstances of Patna High Court
CR. APP (DB) No.349 of 2023 dt. 17-10-2025 a case. The standard of conscious
possession would be different in case of a public transport vehicle with several
persons as opposed to a private vehicle with a few persons known to one another. In
Mohan Lal v. State of Rajasthan [Mohan Lal v. State of Rajasthan, (2015) 6 SCC 222 :
(2015) 3 SCC (Cri) 881] , this Court also observed that the term "possession" could
mean physical possession with animus; custody over the prohibited substances with
animus; exercise of dominion and control as a result of concealment; or personal
knowledge as to the existence of the contraband and the intention based on this
knowledge."
41. Another contention raised by the learned counsel for the appellants with regard to the
non-adherence to the provisions of Section 52(A) of the N.D.P.S. Act. As far as the preparation of an
inventory of such narcotics substance and certifying the correctness of the inventory by a Magistrate
is concerned, it would be relevant to refer to Ext.-9 wherein the inventory of the seized goods as well
as the detail of the sampling being done was made by a 1st Class, Judicial Magistrate namely Sri
Manish Kumar and a certificate under Section 52(A)(3) was issued to that effect. From perusal of
such certificate it would be evident that the detail description of the goods under Sl. No. 1 has been
given and so are the details of the two samples prepared from the 3 packets which was seized from
the Truck. The entire inventory of the seized goods including the vehicle in question as well as the
rice bran packets and the samples were recorded with their origin, quantity and Patna High Court
CR. APP (DB) No.349 of 2023 dt. 17-10-2025 value. This certificate goes on to show that as far as
the certification of the inventory as contained under Section 52(A) of the N.D.P.S. Act is concerned,
the same was done in a proper manner and the defence cannot question the same only on account of
the fact that the Magistrate who had prepared the certificate has not been examined.

Sunil Kumar vs The State Of Bihar Through D.R.I., Patna on 5 October, 2025
42. It has been argued on behalf of the appellants that the chemical analyst has not been examined.
However, the F.S.L. report received from C.R.C.L., New Delhi which forms part of the complaint
categorically concludes that the sample under reference answers positive test for Morphine, which
as per the schedule of the N.D.P.S. Act, is a narcotic goods.
43. The defence has not been able to prove anything contrary to show that the forensic report was
tampered with or the chain of custody of seized narcotics and forensic evidence report had no
co-relation with each other and therefore the chain of custody remain intact without any dispute.
44. It is a settled law that once the prosecution establishes prima facie case in a narcotic offence, the
burden shifts to the accused to prove their innocence and failure to do so will draw conviction
against them.
45. The point raised by the learned counsel for the Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.349 of 2023
dt. 17-10-2025 appellants with regard to the conditions under Section 67 of the N.D.P.S. Act being
presumptive in nature and cannot be taken against the appellant though has some force prima facie
however, if the confessional statement is corroborated with other evidence the same can be taken
against the accused/appellants.
46. We have already observed that it was on the disclosure made by the apprehended appellants in
their statements made under Section 67 of the N.D.P.S. Act that the narcotic substance were
recovered from a secret cavity closed with the help of nut-bolts.
47. Thus, from the facts and circumstances discussed hereinabove and considering the various
judicial pronouncements, we are of the considered opinion that the prosecution has proved the case
beyond reasonable doubt against the appellants and there is no illegality in the finding arrived at by
the learned Trial Court holding the appellants guilty of the offences as alleged.
48. We find that the Trial Court relying on the testimony of the prosecution witnesses and also
taking into account the documentary evidence which adequately goes on to prove the guilt of the
appellants has rightly convicted the Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.349 of 2023 dt. 17-10-2025
appellants.
49. In ultimate analysis, we find no plausible reason to interfere with the judgments of the learned
Trial Court. Both the appeals would fail, they are dismissed accordingly.
50. Let a copy of this judgment with the complete Trial Court records be sent to the concerned Trial
Court through a special messenger immediately to ensure the availability of the records in the Trial
Court at the earliest.
