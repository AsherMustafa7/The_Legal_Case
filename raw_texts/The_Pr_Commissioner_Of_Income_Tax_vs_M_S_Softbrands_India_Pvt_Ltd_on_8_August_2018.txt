Mr. K.V.Aravind, Adv. for Appellants - Revenue. Mr. S.Sharath, Adv. for Mr. Chythanya.K.K., Adv.
for Respondent - Assessee.
This Appeal is filed by the Revenue purportedly raising substantial questions of law arising from the
Order of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Bangalore Bench 'A', Bangalore, in IT[TP]A
No.1094/Bang/2011 dated 26.08.2016, relating to the Assessment Year 2007-08.
2. The appeal has been admitted on 14.11.2017 to consider the following substantial questions of
law:
Date of Judgment 08-08-2018, ITA No.398/2017 The Pr. Commissioner of
Income-tax & Another Vs. M/s. Softbrands India Pvt. Ltd., "1. Whether on the facts
and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal is right in law in excluding certain
comparable on the ground of functional dissimilarity by following its earlier order in
case of M/s. Triology E-Business Software India Pvt. Ltd., in ITA No.1054/Bang/2011
dated 23.11.2012 even when Transfer Pricing Officer has rightly chosen the same
considering its functions which are similar to assessment and has satisfied all the
required tests and without doing an FAR analysis of the taxpayer with those other
cases?
2. Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal is right in
law in directing the assessing authority to exclude comparable such as Persistent
Systems Ltd., Wipro Ltd., Flextronics Software Systems Ltd., I-gate Global Solutions
Ltd., Ishir Infotech Ltd., Megasoft Ltd., Mind Tree, R.System International Ltd.,
Sasken Communications Technologies Ltd., by following its earlier order which has
not reached finality?"

3. The learned Tribunal, after discussing the rival contentions of both the
Appellants-Revenue and Date of Judgment 08-08-2018, ITA No.398/2017 The Pr.
Commissioner of Income-tax & Another Vs. M/s. Softbrands India Pvt. Ltd.,
Respondent-Assessee, has returned the findings as under:
Regarding Substantial Question of Law No.1:
"(i) Accel Transmatics Ltd. (Seg.) "xxxxx"
7.3 We have considered the rival submissions as well as the relevant material on record. At the
outset, we note that the Comparability of this company to a software development services provider
has been considered by the co-ordinate bench of this Tribunal in the case of Trilogy E-Business
Solutions dt.23.11.2012 for the Assessment Year 2007-08 in ITA No.1054/Bang/2011. The Tribunal
in para 48 of the said order has reproduced the finding of the Mumbai Bench of the Tribunal in the
case of Capgemini India (P) Ltd. Vs. Addl. CIT 12 Taxman.com 51 as under :
"xxxxx"
By following the above decision of the Mumbai Tribunal, the co-ordinate bench has held that this
company is not comparable and should Date of Judgment 08-08-2018, ITA No.398/2017 The Pr.
Commissioner of Income-tax & Another Vs. M/s. Softbrands India Pvt. Ltd., be excluded from the
list of comparable in para 50 as under :
"xxxxx"
As far as the business activities of the company are concerned, the revenue has not disputed that
this company is engaged in the diversified activity as recorded by the Tribunal in the earlier year.
Accordingly, by following the earlier orders of this Tribunal, we direct the A.O./TPO to exclude this
company from the list of comparable for determining the ALP.
(ii) Avani Cincom Ltd.
"xxxxx"
8.2 We have considered the rival submissions as well as the relevant material on record. We note
that the comparability of this company has been considered by the co-ordinate bench of this
Tribunal in Trilogy E-Business Software India Pvt. Ltd. (supra) in para 39 & 41 as under :
"xxxxx"
Date of Judgment 08-08-2018, ITA No.398/2017 The Pr. Commissioner of Income-tax & Another
Vs. M/s. Softbrands India Pvt. Ltd., Following the earlier orders of this Tribunal, we direct the
A.O./TPO to exclude this company from the list of comparable for determining the ALP."

4. Similarly, the learned Tribunal has considered other comparables and excluded the same.
Regarding Substantial Question of Law No.2:
"vii) Flextronics Software Systems Ltd.
(Seg.) "xxxxx"
11.2 We have considered the rival submissions as well as the relevant material on record. We find
that the comparability of this company was not an issue before this Tribunal in the cases relied upon
by the assessee as above. Accordingly, we do not find any substance or merit in the argument of the
assessee that because of the turnover filter of this company should be excluded from the list of
comparables.
viii) Helios & Matheson Information Technology Ltd.
"xxxxx"
Date of Judgment 08-08-2018, ITA No.398/2017 The Pr. Commissioner of Income-tax & Another
Vs. M/s. Softbrands India Pvt. Ltd., 12.2 We have considered the rival submissions as well as the
relevant material on record. We note that the comparability of this company has been considered by
the co-ordinate bench of this Tribunal in the case of Serial Innovations India Pvt. Ltd. (surpa) in
paras 29 & 30 as under:
"xxxxx"
Respectfully following the decision of this Tribunal, we direct the A.O./TPO to exclude this company
from the list of comparable for determining the ALP."
5. Similarly, the learned Tribunal has considered other comparables and excluded the same.
6. However, this Court in a recent judgment in I.T.A. Nos.536/2015 c/w 537/2015 delivered on
25.06.2018 (Prl. Commissioner of Income Tax & Anr.
-v- M/s Softbrands India Pvt. Ltd.,) has held that in these type of cases, unless an ex-facie perversity
in the findings of the learned Income Tax Appellate Tribunal is Date of Judgment 08-08-2018, ITA
No.398/2017 The Pr. Commissioner of Income-tax & Another Vs. M/s. Softbrands India Pvt. Ltd.,
established by the appellant, the appeal at the instance of an assessee or the Revenue under Section
260-A of the Act is not maintainable.
The relevant portion of the said judgment is quoted below for ready reference:
"Conclusion:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/15249616/ 4
The Pr Commissioner Of Income Tax vs M/S Softbrands India Pvt Ltd on 8 August, 2018
55. A substantial quantum of international trade and transactions depends upon the
fair and quick judicial dispensation in such cases. Had it been a case of substantial
question of interpretation of provisions of Double Taxation Avoidance Treaties
(DTAA), interpretation of provisions of the Income Tax Act or Overriding Effect of
the Treaties over the Domestic Legislations or the questions like Treaty Shopping,
Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS), Transfer of Shares in Tax Havens (like in
the case of Vodafone etc.), if based on relevant facts, such substantial questions of law
could be raised before the High Court under Section 260-A of the Act, the Courts
could have embarked upon such exercise of framing and answering such Date of
Judgment 08-08-2018, ITA No.398/2017 The Pr. Commissioner of Income-tax &
Another Vs. M/s. Softbrands India Pvt. Ltd., substantial question of law. On the other
hand, the appeals of the present tenor as to whether the comparables have been
rightly picked up or not, Filters for arriving at the correct list of comparables have
been rightly applied or not, do not in our considered opinion, give rise to any
substantial question of law.
56. We are therefore of the considered opinion that the present appeals filed by the
Revenue do not give rise to any substantial question of law and the suggested
substantial questions of law do not meet the requirements of Section 260-A of the Act
and thus the appeals filed by the Revenue are found to be devoid of merit and the
same are liable to be dismissed.
57. We make it clear that the same yardsticks and parameters will have to be applied,
even if such appeals are filed by the Assessees, because, there may be cases where the
Tribunal giving its own reasons and findings has found certain comparables to be
good comparables to arrive at an 'Arm's Length Price' in the case of the assessees
with which the assessees may not be satisfied and Date of Judgment 08-08-2018,
ITA No.398/2017 The Pr. Commissioner of Income-tax & Another Vs. M/s.
Softbrands India Pvt. Ltd., have filed such appeals before this Court.
Therefore we clarify that mere dissatisfaction with the findings of facts arrived at by the learned
Tribunal is not at all a sufficient reason to invoke Section 260-A of the Act before this Court.
58. The appeals filed by the Revenue are therefore dismissed with no order as to costs."
7. Having heard the learned counsels appearing for the parties, we are therefore of the opinion that
no substantial question of law arises in the present case also. The Appeal filed by the
Appellants-Revenue is liable to be dismissed and it is dismissed accordingly.
No costs.
