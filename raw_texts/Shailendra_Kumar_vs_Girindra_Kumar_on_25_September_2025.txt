CORAM: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE
And
HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE S. B. PD. SINGH
CAV JUDGMENT
(Per: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE S. B. PD. SINGH) Date : 25-09-2025 Heard.
2. The present appeal is directed against the order dated 25.10.2021 passed in Guardianship Case
No. 09 of 2017 by the learned Principal Judge, Family Court, Katihar, whereby and whereunder the
learned Court has dismissed the petition of the appellant filed under Section 7(1)(g) of Patna High
Court MA No.22 of 2022 dt.25-09-2025 the Family Court Act, 1984 for declaration of the appellant
as the legal guardian of respondent No. 1 who is unmarried and 50 percent mentally retarded
person.
3. The case of the appellant as per petition filed before the Family Court is that the appellant and
respondent No. 1 are full brothers. The respondent No. 1 is 47 years old and 50 percent mentally
retarded person. Their father was a retired Railway Employee who died on 30.01.2017. The mother
of the appellant and respondent No. 1 has already died before the death of their father. The

appellant is posted as a Teacher in KV at Katihar having his own family. The appellant is facing
troubles regarding proper care of the respondent No. 1, his medical expenses and other necessities
to lead his life. The appellant, therefore filed Guardianship Case No. 9 of 2017 for declaring the
appellant as legal guardian of respondent No. 1, as after being declared as legal guardian of
respondent No. 1, the appellant will be entitled for grant of Railway Family Pension which is being
granted by the Railway to the physically/mentally disabled children of Railway Employee and after
getting pension, he would be able to properly Patna High Court MA No.22 of 2022 dt.25-09-2025
maintain his brother (respondent No. 1).
4. The appellant has examined three witnesses in order to prove his case which are P.W. 1 Manas
Ranjan Sen, P.W. 2 Shankar Prasad Mandal and P.W. 3 Sudha Kumari.
5. The learned Principal Judge, Family Court, Katihar, after considering the materials available on
record, came to the conclusion that appellant and respondent No. 1 are full brothers. However,
learned Family Court dismissed the petition of the appellant on the ground that he has not exhibited
any document which could suggest that his late father was employed in Indian Railways nor he has
exhibited any medical certificate to suggest that his brother (respondent No. 1) is 50 percent
mentally retarded person. Though a photo-copy of certificate issued by the Chief Medical Officer,
Katihar dated 30.05.2017 was brought on record which suggests that respondent No. 1 is 50 percent
mentally retarded person, but in the absence of certified copy of said certificate and any medical
prescription suggesting that respondent No. 1 was under treatment regarding his ill health, learned
Family Court came to the conclusion that appellant has not proved his case and Patna High Court
MA No.22 of 2022 dt.25-09-2025 therefore dismissed the petition filed on behalf of the appellant.
Being aggrieved by the order of learned Principal Judge, Family Court, Katihar, the appellant has
approached this Court.
6. It is submitted by learned counsel for the appellant that learned Court below has committed a
grave error in dismissing the case, and such dismissal is per se illegal and unsustainable in the eye of
law. It is urged that there was sufficient material on record to establish that appellant and
respondent No. 1 are full brothers and respondent No. 1 is 50 percent mentally retarded person. The
respondent No. 1 is unmarried and living along with the appellant. The appellant is married person
and he has his own family expenses. The appellant, although has two sisters but all are married and
settled. The father of the appellant was Railway employee and there is a provision for family pension
to a mentally retarded person whose father/mother were in the services of Indian Railways. The
appellant has also brought on record, though not exhibited the medical certificate of respondent No.
1 showing 50 percent mentally retarded which was issued by the Civil Patna High Court MA No.22
of 2022 dt.25-09-2025 Surgeon-cum-Chief Medical Officer, Katihar, which was not considered by
the learned Family Court and in a flimsy manner, the petition of the appellant was dismissed.
7. It is contended by learned counsel for the appellant that documents were not exhibited in his
presence and the same were required to be proved as per law. Hence, he prays that the matter be
remitted back to the learned Trial Court to decide the admissibility of documents and to look into
and decide the matter.

8. We have heard learned counsel for the appellant and perused the impugned order.
9. The notices were issued by this Court to the respondent No. 1, but in spite of valid service of
notice, none had entered appearance on behalf of respondent No. 1. The appellant claims that
respondent No. 1 is residing along with the appellant but after being noticed to the respondent No. 1,
he has not appeared to contest his case, which clearly suggests that respondent No. 1 is not residing
along with the appellant.
10. The appellant has not brought on record any document before this Court also which could
suggest that Patna High Court MA No.22 of 2022 dt.25-09-2025 his father was employed in Indian
Railways nor death certificate of his father/mother was brought on record to suggest that appellant
is the only Guardian to take care of his mentally retarded brother (respondent No. 1). The appellant
has also not brought on record any medical certificate much less any medical prescription of the
respondent No. 1 suggesting that he is a mentally retarded person and a treatment in this regard is
going on. He has only filed the photocopy of the certificate issued by the Chief Medical Officer,
Katihar dated 30.05.2017.
11. After going through the above facts, the matter is remanded back to the learned Principal Judge,
Family Court, Katihar with a direction to the appellant to file fresh petition before learned Principal
Judge, Family Court, Katihar, producing/exhibiting all relevant documents for declaring him as
legal guardian of respondent No. 1. The Trial Court shall record fresh findings after considering the
documentary as well as oral evidences adduced on behalf of the appellant.
12. Accordingly, M.A. No. 22 of 2022 is hereby disposed of.
Patna High Court MA No.22 of 2022 dt.25-09-2025
13. Pending I.A(s), if any, stand disposed of.
