4. Learned Standing Counsel has raised a preliminary objection that view of the judgment of
Division Bench of this Court in case of Manbhavati Vs. State of U.P. and others reported in 2020 1
AWC 789A and Writ C No. 7863 of 2018 (Brij Bhushan Rai v. State of U.P. and 6 others) the writ
petition is not maintainable for execution of orders passed by the Revenue Court. It has been further
contended by learned Standing Counsel that in view of provisions of paragraph No. 460 of the U.P.
Revenue Court Manual, the petitioner has remedy for getting the order implemented. For ready
reference, paragraph No. 460 of the U.P. Revenue Court Manual is quoted as under:-
"460. Execution of decree and order- (1)The decree or order passed under the Code
or the Rules framed under the Code shall, mutatis mutandis, be executed in
accordance with the provisions of Chapter V. (2) The Assistant Collector/Tahsildar
passing the order for eviction or recovery of any amount of damages or compensation
under the provisions of Section 67 of the Code shall get the order executed and in
execution of the order he shall, mutatis mutandis, follow the procedure laid down in
paragraphs 137 and 138."
5. In view of the same, I am not inclined to interfere in the matter.
6. Accordingly, the petition is disposed of with liberty to the petitioner to pursue the remedy as
available to her under the U.P. Revenue Court Manual.
