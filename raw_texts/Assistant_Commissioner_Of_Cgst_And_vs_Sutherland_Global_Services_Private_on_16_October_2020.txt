JUDGMENT
Dr.Vineet Kothari,J The interesting and important question which arises in the present intra Court
appeal from the judgment of the learned Single http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in
WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services
Private Limited] Judge dated 05.09.2019 allowing the writ petition of the Assessee M/s.
Sutherland Global Services Private Limited in W.P.No.4773 of 2018, is as to whether the Assessee is
entitled to utilise and set off the accumulated unutilised amount of Education Cess (EC), Secondary
and Higher Education Cess (SHEC) and Krishi Kalyan Cess (KKC), all jointly referred to as the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/112932804/ 2
Assistant Commissioner Of Cgst And ... vs Sutherland Global Services Private ... on 16 October, 2020
"Cess" against the Output GST Tax Liability after the switch over of Indirect Taxation System to GST
Regime with effect from 01.07.2017, which GST (Goods and Services Tax) levy subsumed within its
fold 16 indirect taxes earlier leviable like Excise Duty, VAT, etc.
2. It may be noted that all the aforesaid three types of Cess were imposed by different Finance Acts
which are enumerated hereafter and Education Cess and Secondary and Higher Education Cess
were also abolished much before the enforcement of GST Regime with effect from 01.07.2017 and
during the contemporary period of the levy of the Cess, they were allowed to be set off or adjusted
under CENVAT Credit Rules against the Output Cess Liability only and no cross utilisation of the
Cess was allowed to be set off against the normal excise duty or customs duty payable by the
Assessee, even http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst.
Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] though the
Cess imposed under the Finance Act were collected in the form of Duty or Tax, as the case may be,
by reading mutatis mutandis the provisions of those parent enactments.
3. The fine distinction between Cess, Tax and Duty will also be discussed hereafter. But, by way of
introductory remark, it can be stated here that while Cess is collected from the person on whom
such liability is fixed to meet a particular kind of expenditure incurred by the Government and its
collection and expenditure is dedicated to that particular object or purpose of imposition of Cess.
While Tax is a General Revenue, which can be spent by the Government for general public purposes
and Duty is imposed on manufacture in the form of Excise Duty or Customs Duty on Imports, under
those specified laws, which also go to the General Revenue of the State. Fees is yet another impost
which has the basis of quid pro quo at its back.
4. The controversy involved in the present case is about the set off, adjustment or utilisation of the
Input Tax Credit of Cess paid at the time of manufacture or import by the Assessee, which provides
Technical and Call Centre Services all over the country, namely as to http://www.judis.nic.in
Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v.
Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] whether such Cess in the form of Education Cess, etc.
can be adjusted against the Output GST liability under the provisions of CGST Act, 2017 (Central
Goods and Service Tax Act, 2017).
5. The learned Single Judge, by a detailed discussion of the statutory provisions and relevant case
laws, has held in favour of the Assessee that the Assessee was entitled to adjust such unutilised
CENVAT credit carried forward in its Electronic Ledger, which was so lying unutilised as on 30th
June 2017, to be adjusted against the Output GST Liability with effect from 01.07.2017 in terms of
Section 140 of the CGST Act, 2017.
6. However, for the reasons to be discussed below, we have found ourselves unable to subscribe to
the same view as that of the learned Single Judge and we find that there is a considerable merit in
the present writ appeal filed by the Revenue and it deserves to be allowed.
7. Before coming to the reasons for our aforesaid conclusion, let us discuss the relevant provisions of
the relevant enactments involved http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/112932804/ 3
Assistant Commissioner Of Cgst And ... vs Sutherland Global Services Private ... on 16 October, 2020
2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited]
in the present matter to understand the controversy in a better manner.
8. Section 140 of the CGST Act, 2017, which is most crucial for this case and which provides for the
transitional arrangement for Input Tax Credit is quoted below for ready reference:
"Transitional arrangements for input tax credit.
140. (1) A registered person, other than a person opting to pay tax under section 10,

CGST Act, 2017-reg.
Attention is invited to sub-section (a) of section 28 of the CGST (Amendment) Act, 2018 (No. 31 of
2018) which provides that section 140(1) of the CGST Act, 2017 be amended with retrospective effect
to allow transition of CENVAT credit under the existing law viz. Central Excise and Service Tax law,
only in respect of “eligible duties”. In this regard, doubts have been expressed as to whether the
expression “eligible duties” would include CENVAT credit of Service Tax within its scope or not.

Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs hereby directs the following:
3.1 The CENVAT credit of service tax paid under section 66B of the Finance Act, 1994 was available
as transitional credit under section 140(1) of the CGST Act and that legal position has not changed
due to amendment of section 140(1) on account of following reasons:
i) The amendment in provisions of section 140(1) and the explanations to section 140
need to be read harmoniously such that neither any provision of the amendment
becomes otiose nor does the legislative intent of the amendment get defeated.
ii) The intention behind the amendment of section 140(1) to include the expression
"eligible duties” has been indicated in the “Rationale/ Remarks” column (at Sl. No.
37) of the draft proposals for amending the GST law which was uploaded in the
public domain for comments. It is clear that the transition of credit of taxes paid
under section 66B of the Finance Act, 1994 was never intended to be disallowed
under section 140(1) and therefore no such remark was present in the document.

iii) Under tax statutes, the word “duties" is used interchangeably with the word “taxes” and in the
present context, the two words should not be read in a disharmonious manner.

3.2 Thus, expression "eligible duties” in section 140(1) which are allowed to be transitioned would
cover within its fold the duties which are listed as "eligible duties” at sl. no.
(i) to (vii) of explanation 1, and “eligible duties and taxes” at sl. no. (i) to (viii) of explanation 2 to
section 140, since the expression “eligible duties and taxes” has not been used elsewhere in the Act.
3.3 The expression “eligible duties” under section 140(1) does not in any way refer to the condition
regarding goods in stock as referred to in Explanation 1 to section 140 or to the condition regarding
inputs and input services in transit, as referred to in Explanation 2 to section 140.
4. Further, it has been decided not to notify the clause
(i) of sub-section (b) of section 28 and clause (i) of sub- section (c) of section 28 of CGST
(Amendment) Act, 2018 which link Explanation 1 and Explanation 2 of section 140 to section 140(1).
This would ensure that the credit allowed to be transitioned under section 140(1) is not linked to
credit of goods in stock, as provided under Explanation 1, and credit of goods and services in transit,
as provided under Explanation 2. However, the duties and taxes for which http://www.judis.nic.in
Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v.
Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] transition is allowed shall be governed by para 3.2
above.
5. No transition of credit of cesses, including cess which is collected as additional duty of customs
under sub- section (1) of section 3 of the Customs Tariff Act, 1975, would be allowed in terms of
Explanation 3 to section 140, inserted vide sub-section (d) of section 28 of CGST Amendment Act,
2018 which shall become effective from the date the same is notified giving it retrospective effect.
6. Trade may be suitably informed and difficulty, if any, in the implementation of this circular may
be brought to the notice of the Board.

CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] Introduction of Secondary
and Higher Education Cess
11. Next is the Secondary and Higher Education Cess introduced by the Finance Act, 2007, from
Section 136 onwards. The said Cess was levied as the surcharge to fulfil the commitment of the
Government to provide Finance and Secondary and Higher Education.
This Cess was also liable to be collected in addition to any other duties of excise chargeable on such
goods under the provisions of Central Excise Act, 1944 and also Education Cess imposed by Section
93 of the Finance (No.2) Act, 2004 quoted above. Similar SHEC was also imposed by Section 139 of
the same Finance Act, 2007, at the rate of 1% to be collected in addition to the duty of customs on
the imported goods as well as on service tax leviable under the provisions of 66 of the Finance Act,
1994. The provisions of the said SHEC is not again quoted as they are akin to the aforesaid
provisions of levy of Education Cess.
12. Similarly, the Central Government imposed Krishi Kalyan Cess by Section 161 of the Finance Act,
2016, with effect from 1st June 2016 at the rate of 0.5% of the Service Tax payable on taxable
http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of
CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] services, for the purpose of
financing and promoting initiatives to improve agriculture or any other purpose relating thereto.
The said Krishi Kalyan Cess was repealed with effect from 01.07.2017 only by the Taxation Laws
(Amendment) Act, 2017.
13. The levy of Education Cess and Secondary and Higher Education Cess was however dropped and
deleted by the Finance Act, 2015 by Section 153, of which, Section 95 of the Finance Act 2004,
Education Cess was omitted and by Section 159, Section 140 of the Finance Act, 2007 was also
omitted. The Krishi Kalyan Cess was however abolished only with effect from 01.07.2017 vide
Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act, 2017. But, there was no claim of CENVAT Credit with regard to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/112932804/ 16
Assistant Commissioner Of Cgst And ... vs Sutherland Global Services Private ... on 16 October, 2020
Krishi Kalyan Cess and the reason which apply to Education Cess and Secondary and Higher
Education Cess will equally apply to Krishi Kalyan Cess also for the purpose of Section 140 of the
CGST Act.
The relevant provisions of Central Excise Act and CENVAT Rules for availment and utilisation of
CENVAT Credit
14. Section 37 of the Central Excise Act, 1944, provides the power of the Central Government to
make Rules and various Clauses http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of
2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited]
of the Section 37 empowered the Central Government to frame the Rules with regard to various
aspects of the Central Excise Law and our attention was drawn towards Clause (xxviii) thereof,
which provides for Rules to be framed in regard to the lapsing of credit of duty lying unutilised with
the manufacturer of specificied excisable goods on an appointed date and also for not allowing such
credit to be utilised for payment of any kind of duty on any excisable goods on and from such date.
CENVAT Credit Rules 2004
15. Rule 3 of the CENVAT Credit Rules, 2004, provides that a manufacturer or a purchaser of final
products or a provider of output service shall be allowed to take credit (hereinafter referred to as
CENVAT Credit) of the specified duties in that Rule 3, which included Education Cess and
Secondary and Higher Education Cess in question.
Sub-rule (7) of Rule 3 of CENVAT Credit Rules, 2004, specifically provided that CENVAT Credit in
respect of Education Cess and Secondary and Higher Education Cess shall be utilised only towards
the payment of Education Cess leviable on the taxable services only and not against the normal
excise duty. Those CENVAT Rules, 2004 clearly http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in
WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services
Private Limited] restricted the utilisation of Education Cess and Higher and Secondary Education
Cess on the output tax on goods and services and not against the normal excise duty or service tax
liability. It was not disputed before us that cross utilisation of CENVAT Credit in the form of
Education Cess and Secondary and Higher Education Cess against normal service tax and excise
duty liability was not allowed.
16. The controversy, however, arose because the Assessee claimed in the present case that the
unutilised part of Education Cess and Secondary and Higher Education Cess lying to the credit of
the Assessee in the Electronic Ledger continued even after the levies were omitted by the Finance
Act, 2015, as aforesaid, up to 30th June 2017, when the switch over was made to GST Regime with
effect from 01.07.2017 and therefore, a vested right came to accrue with the Assessee to utilise such
unutilised CENVAT Credit of Education Cess and Secondary and Higher Education Cess against the
output GST liability with effect from 01.07.2017. Since the Revenue Authority under GST negatived
the said claim and asked the Assessee to reverse the CENVAT Credit in the form of Education Cess
and Secondary and Higher Education Cess, the Assessee approached this Court by way of
http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/112932804/ 17
Assistant Commissioner Of Cgst And ... vs Sutherland Global Services Private ... on 16 October, 2020
CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] writ petition which came to
be allowed by the learned Single Judge by the order impugned before us now.
17. Before coming to our reasons for the conclusion that the Assessee is not so entitled to carry
forward unutilised Education Cess and Secondary and Higher Education Cess as CENVAT Credit to
be utilised against the output GST liability under the provisions of CGST Act, in terms of Section 140
thereof, let us note the rival contentions raised before us.
Contentions raised on behalf of Revenue/Appellant
18. Ms.Aparna Nandakumar, learned counsel for the appellant/ Revenue submitted that with the
levy of Cess having been dropped in the year 2015 by the Finance Act, 2015, the unutilised amount
of Education Cess and Secondary and Higher Education Cess which could not be set off by the
Assessee during the contemporary period prior to 30th June 2017, cannot be allowed to be carried
forward under the transitory provisions of Section 140 of the CGST Act, because it became a dead
claim of the Assessee and since the levy of Cess was not continued after 2015 nor such levy was
subsumed in the listed 16 http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020
[Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] taxes
which were subsumed under the GST law, the credit in respect of such Cess could not be claimed
against the Output GST liability. She emphasised that since Cess was collected for a specific and
dedicated purpose by the Central Government and such levies imposed by the Finance Act, 2004
and 2007 respectively and the purpose of giving the input credit in respect of the same against the
output Cess liability was only to remove the cascading effect and which is the bedrock of such Input
Tax Credits in the indirect taxation system was not available, as Output Cess Liability ceased,
therefore, the untilised portion of such CENVAT credit in the form of Education Cess and Secondary
and Higher Education Cess became a dead claim after such levies were dropped in the year 2015 and
unlike unutilised portion of CENVAT credit in the form of specified additional excise duty, customs
duty, National Calamity Contingent Duty on inputs which were transitioned as per Section 140 of
the CGST Act for the period from 01.07.2017 also, such unutilised Cess could not stand at parity
with unutilised Input credit of specified excise duty and therefore, the claim of the Assessee in this
regard was misconceived and learned Single Judge has erred in allowing the same.
http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of
CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited]
19. The learned counsel for the appellant/Revenue relied upon several case laws to support her
contention as was done before the learned Single Judge also, which will be discussed by us
hereafter.
20. The written submissions filed by the appellant/Revenue was also taken on record and the same
is re-produced below, which have been considered by us.
I. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF INTRODUCTION AND ABOLITION OF CESSES:-(EC,SHEC
and KKC) a. Education Cess (hereinafter referred as EC) was introduced vide Finance Act 23 of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/112932804/ 18
Assistant Commissioner Of Cgst And ... vs Sutherland Global Services Private ... on 16 October, 2020
2004. Section 91of Chapter VI of the Finance Act 23 of 2004 specifically provided that “there shall
be levied and collected in accordance with the provisions of this chapter as surcharge for the
purpose of Union, a cess to be called Education Cess to fulfil the commitment of the Government to
provide and finance universalised quality basic education”. Subsection (2) of Section 91 of the
Finance Act 23 of 2004 specifically provided that the sum of money collected as Education Cess
would be utilised for the purpose specified in sub section (1) after due appropriation made by
Parliament by law.
b. Similarly Secondary and Higher Education Cess(hereinafter referred as SHE Cess) was
introduced vide Finance Act 2007. Section 136 of chapter VI of the Finance Act 2007, provided that
Secondary and Higher Education Cess would be levied and collected as surcharge and would be
utilised to provide for the purpose of Secondary and Higher Education after due appropriation made
by Parliament by law in this behalf.
http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of
CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] c. Similarly Finance Act 2016
provided for the levy and collection of Krishi Kalyan Cess (hereinafter referred as KKC) to meet the
needs of the agriculturists and farmers. Thus the three cesses were introduced for specific purposes
and the same was collected by the Central Government and utilised only for those identified
specified purposes.
d. The first proviso to Rule 3(7)(b) of the CENVAT Credit Rules 2004 provided that the credit of the
Education Cess on excisable goods and on taxable services could be utilised either for payment of
Education Cess on excisable goods or for the payment of Education Cess on taxable services.
e. The second proviso to Rule 3(7)(b) of the CENVAT Credit Rules provided that the credit of
Secondary and Higher Education Cess on excisable goods and on taxable services can be utilised
either for payment of Secondary and Higher Education Cess excisable goods or for the payment of
Secondary and Higher Education Cess on taxable services.
f. Similarly Rule 3(7)(d) provided that the CENVAT credit pertaining to Krishi Kalyan Cess on
taxable services levied under Section 161 of the Finance Act 2016 shall be utilised only towards the
payment of Krishi Kalyan Cess on taxable services.
g. Thus from the inception of the Education Cess, Secondaryand Higher Education and Krishi
Kalyan Cess the intention of the statute was to allow the credit utilisation of CENVATCredit
pertaining to these cesses only as against the respective cesses levied on excisable goods or output
taxable services. This position continued till 2015.
h. Thus cross utilisation of the Education Cess and Secondary and Higher Education Cess as against
the output element of excise duty and service tax was never allowed.
i. Education Cess and Secondary Higher Education Cess http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt.
16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/112932804/ 19
Assistant Commissioner Of Cgst And ... vs Sutherland Global Services Private ... on 16 October, 2020
Global Services Private Limited] levied on excise duty and taxable services were abolished from the
year 2015 by omission of Section 95 of the Finance Act 2004 and section 140 of the Finance Act
2007 vide Section 153 and 159 respectively of the Finance Act 2015.
j. Consequently Notification 14 of 2015 – Central Excise and Notification 15 of 2015 – Central Excise
and Notification 14 of 2015 – ST and Notification 15 of 2015 – ST exempted all the goods and
services from the levy of Education Cess and Secondary Higher Education Cess 01.03.2015 and
01.06.2015 respectively.
k. Thus after these two cut of dates, the levy of education cess and the levy of secondary higher
education cess was completely wiped away from the statute book. In other words, the levy of
education cess on excisable goods and taxable services remained in the statute book from 2004 to
2015. Likewise, the levy of SHE Cess remained in the Statute book from 2007 to 2015.
l. While so vide Notification No. 12 of 2015- CE-NT dated 30.04.2015 and Notification 22of 2015-
CE-NT dated 29.10.2015 six provisos were added to Rule 3(7)(b) of the CENVATCredit Rules after
the first two provisos. According to the newly added provisos the following position emerged :-
i. The credit of Education Cess and Secondary and Higher Education Cess paid on
inputs or capital goods received in the factory of manufacture of final products on or
after 01.03.2015 could be utilised for the payment of central excise duty.
ii. The 50% balance credit of Education Cess and Secondary and Higher Education Cess paid on
capital goods received in the factory of manufacture of final products in the financial year 2014-15
can be utilised for payment of central excise duty.
http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of
CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] iii. The CENVATCredit
pertaining to Education Cess and Secondary and Higher Education Cess paid on input services
received by the manufacture of final products on or after 01.03.2015 could be utilised for the
payment of central excise duty.
iv. The CENVATCredit of Education Cess and Secondary and Higher Education Cess paid on inputs
or capital goods received in the premises of the provider of output service on or after the 1st day of
June, 2015 can be utilized for payment of service tax on any output service.
v. The 50% balance credit of Education Cess and Secondary and Higher Education Cess paid on
capital goods received in the premises of the provider of output service in the financial year 2014-15
can be utilized for payment of service tax on any output service.
vi. CENVATCredit of Education Cess and Secondary and Higher Education Cess paid on input
service in respect of which the invoice, bill, challan or Service Tax Certificate for Transportation of
Goods by Rail is received by the provider of output service on or after the 1st day of June, 2015 can
be utilized for payment of service tax on any output service.

m. The newly added provisos was a Special Purpose Vehicle for a limited period to give the benefit of
cross utilisation as against excise duty and service tax only with regard to inputs and inputs services
received on or after cut of date namely 01.03.2015 and 01.06.2015.

b. The appellants/department places reliance on the Judgment of the Hon’ble
Supreme Court in The Commissioner, Hindu Religious Endowments, Madras v. Sri
LakshmindraThirthaSwamiar of Sri Shirur Mutt MANU/SC/0136/1954 : AIR 1954
SC 282Matthews v. Chicory Marketing Board (1938) 60 C.L.R. 263Dewan Chand

The Joint Commissioner of Income Tax, Company Range-III [ (2019)310C
TR(Mad)746, [2019]414ITR196(Mad)].
c. It is submitted that as held by the Hon’ble Apex Court, if the Statement of Objects
and Reasons spells out the essential purpose which the enactment seeks to achieve or
if the AmendingAct introducing the levy of cess spells out the specific purpose in
which the levy has been introduced, then the subject levy has to be construed only as
a fee and not a tax.
d. Section 91 of the Finance Act, 2004 which introduced the levy of Education Cess
specifically provides that the levy of Education Cess is provide funds for basic
education. Similarly Section 136 of the Finance(Amending Act) 2007 specified the
purpose viz to provide funds and infrastructure for medium and higher education.
e. It is submitted that the other requirement that the fund is set apart and
appropriated specifically for the performance of specified purpose and is not merged
with benefit of the general public is also there in the present case.
f. The contention of the respondentassessee by placing http://www.judis.nic.in
Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST &
Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] reliance on the decision
in Hingir Rampur Coal Company Ltd. v. State of Orissa MANU/SC/0037/1960 : 1961
(2) SCR 537 that the Education Cess, Secondary and Higher Education Cess were
credited into the Consolidated Fund of India(herein after referred as CFI) and
therefore it is collected only a tax is wholly untenable for the following reasons:-
i. Although initially the collections of Education Cess, Secondary and Higher
Education Cess were credited into the Consolidated Fund of India,a specific account
called Prarambhik Shiksha Kosh (PSK) was created in the year 2005-06 after
obtaining Parliamentary authorization and these funds collected with respect to the
education cess were transferred to Prarambhik Shiksha Kosh (PSK).Thus even
though initially the funds pertaining to Education Cess were credited into the
Consolidated Fund of India, it has been later transferred to the Prarambhik Shiksha
Kosh (PSK) specifically created for the purpose of expending the Education Cess
funds. This fact has been admitted by the respondentassessee [page 78 of additional
paper book filed by the respondentassessee – report of CAG].
ii. The respondentassessee herein submits that even though the Secondary and
Higher Education Cess was introduced in the year 2007, the entire collection
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/112932804/ 22
Assistant Commissioner Of Cgst And ... vs Sutherland Global Services Private ... on 16 October, 2020
pertaining to Secondary and Higher Education Cess has been credited into the
Consolidated Fund of India and no separate fund has been created. The
respondentassessee relies on the CAG report for the year 2014-15 and 16-17.
In this connection the appellantdepartment submits as follows:-
· Even though the collection of SHECess was credited into the Consolidated Fund of
India it was not expended or spent for general public purpose and was awaiting
proper Parliamentary approval for creation of a separate fund.
http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst.
Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private
Limited] · On 16.08.2017, the Union Cabinet accorded the approval for creation of
the non-lapsable separate account called as Madhyamik &Uchhatar Shiksha Kosh
(MUSK) into which all the proceeds of the Secondary and Higher Education Cess
would be credited.
· In this connection the appellant herein files type set no 4 containing305th report of
the Department-Related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Human Resource
Development and the press release by the Press Information Bureaudated
16.08.2017.
· Para 2.8 of the standing committee report gives the details of this specific fund
called Madhyamik &Uchhatar Shiksha Kosh (MUSK).
· Sub para (a) of para 2.8 states that the proceeds of Secondary and Higher
Education Cess will be credited into the Madhyamik &Uchhatar Shiksha Kosh
(MUSK).
· Further sub para (c) of para 2.8 categorically states that the cess would be utilised
in the ongoing schemes of Secondary and Higher Education.
· Sub para (e) of para 2.8 specifies that the Madhyamik &Uchhatar Shiksha Kosh
(MUSK) would be maintained as a reserve fund in the non interest bearing section of
the Public Accounts of India.
· Para 2.9 mentions the actual fund allocations to be provided under the Madhyamik
&Uchhatar Shiksha Kosh (MUSK).
· Similarly para 2.10 of the Standing Committee report gives elaborate details about
the Prarambhik Shiksha Kosh (PSK) that was credited in the year 2006.
· It also states very specifically that the Prarambhik Shiksha Kosh (PSK) fund is
maintained by the Ministry of Human Resource Development and that the transfer to

Finance after approval by the Parliament.
· Para 2.11 has also given the year wise chart on allocation and utilisation of
education cess collected.
It is further submitted that this point could not be brought to the notice of this
Hon’ble Court during the oral arguments as the respondentassessee herein filed the
additional type set 2 containing the CAG report on the final day of the arguments.
Thus the appellants herein submits and crave leave before this Hon’ble Court to make
this submission on Madhyamik &Uchhatar Shiksha Kosh (MUSK) and the Standing
Committee report as a response to the additional type set 2 and response to
submissions of the respondent herein regarding the Consolidated Fund of India.
LEGAL PROPOSITION III :-Cesses cannot take colour of basic levy a. It is submitted
that the term duty does not include additional duties such as Education cess,
Secondary and Higher Education Cess NCCD etc. thus unless there is specific
notification or provision which specifically provides for any benefit with regard to
additional duty, the benefit that is applicable to basic duty or tax cannot be extended
to the additional duty. In this connection the appellant places reliance on the decision
of the larger bench of the Hon’ble Apex Court in UOI v Modi Rubber (1986 25 ELT
849 SC). b. Following this decision the latest decision of the Larger Bench of the
Hon’ble Supreme Court in Unicorn Industries V UOI(2019 370 ELT 3) as held that
education cess, secondary and higher Education cess, NCCD etc which are all
additional levy are independent in nature and do not take the colour of basic levy.
The larger bench of the Hon’ble Supreme Court has held in two Division Bench
judgments of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in SRD Nutrients Private Limited v.
Commissioner of Central Excise, Guwahati, http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt.
16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v.
Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] MANU/SC/1407/2017 : (2018) 1 SCC
105 and the decision of this Court in Bajaj Auto Limited v. Union of India and Ors.,
MANU/SC/0417/2019, decided on 27.3.2019 as per incuriam as the two Division
Bench judgments had not followed the law laid down by the larger bench of the
Hon’ble Supreme Court in UOI v. Modi Rubber. c. It is submitted that although the
decisions of the Larger Bench of the Hon’ble Supreme Court arose in the context of
exemption to the basic central excise, customs duty and whether the benefit of the
exemption could be extended to the benefit of Education Cess, Secondary and Higher
Education Cess, NCCD etc. , the law laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court can be
extended to the present case of transition of CENVAT Credit of the eligible duties.
Thus the appellant submits, that the term “eligible duty” occurring in Section 140(1)
of the CGST Act, 2017 cannot include the CENVAT Credit pertaining to Education
Cess, Secondary and Higher Education Cess and Krishi KalyanCess as these are
additional levy and had not been specifically provided in the Section.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/112932804/ 24
Assistant Commissioner Of Cgst And ... vs Sutherland Global Services Private ... on 16 October, 2020
d. It is submitted therefore that the argument of the respondent herein that the
extension of the applicability of Explanation 1 to Section 140(1) has not been brought
into effect and hence the term “eligible duties” should be allowed to include cesses, is
wholly untenable. e. Explanation (3) to Section 140 also makes it categorical that the
intention of the Legislature was never to transitioned the CENVAT Credit pertaining
to cesses. LEGAL PROPOSITION IV :- Cesses Cannot be Cross Utilised as against
duties or taxes:
a. The respondentassessee herein has placed reliance on the decision of the Hon’ble
Supreme Court inEicher Motors Ltd. v. UOI [ 1999 (106) ELT 3 (SC). The contention
of the respondentassessee herein is that the CENVATCredit pertaining to Education
Cess, Secondary and Higher http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA
No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global
Services Private Limited] Education Cess had already been availed as on 01.03.2015
and 01.06.2015 respectively but could not be utilised as cross utilisation with respect
to excise duty and service tax was not permitted. Thus, their contention is that even
though the CENVATCredit of Education Cess, Secondary and Higher Education Cess
availed and available in the books of accounts and were lying unutilised due to the
barring provisions, they could be transitioned into the GST regime as it was an
indefeasible right.
b. It is submitted that the there is difference between the availment of credit and
utilisation of credit. The appellant also admits the legal position propounded by the
respondent that even though there is statutory time limit fixed for availment of credit
there is no time limit for utilisation of credit. However, the utilisation of the availed
credit will remain indefeasible only when the facility for working it out or the levy
with regard to the output element remains intact. In Eicher Motors Ltd. v. UOI [ 1999
(106) ELT 3 (SC) a provision which provided the lapse of MODVAT Credit was
challenged. However in the facts before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the levy or the
output element was still intact and in such circumstances the Hon’ble Supreme Court
observed in para 6 of the Judgment, that the right accrued to the assessee on the date
they paid the tax on the raw material or the inputs would continue until the facility
available thereto gets worked out or until those goods existed. Thus the Hon’ble
Supreme Court presupposed the existence of the facility for working out the earned
credit and the existence of the output element for the duty for utilisation of the credit.
In the present case however, the levy of the Education Cess, Secondary and Higher
Education Cess had been taken away in the year 2015 itself. In other words, the
facility for working out the earned credit has been taken away and hence the
possibility of continuing the right has also ceased. The Hon’ble Delhi High Court in
the case of Cellular Operators Association of India v UOI[Reported in 2018 (14) GSTL
522, (2018) 51 GSTR http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53
of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services
Private Limited] 338 (Del), MANU/DE/0710/2018] has distinguished the Hon’ble
Supreme Court Eicher Motors Ltd. v. UOI [ 1999 (106) ELT 3 (SC) of the Hon’ble
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/112932804/ 25
Assistant Commissioner Of Cgst And ... vs Sutherland Global Services Private ... on 16 October, 2020
Supreme Court.
LEGAL PROPOSITION V:- Doctrine of Purposive interpretation:
a. Section 140 which deals with transition of CENVATCredit of eligible duties and
taxes envisages 9 different situations of which the situation postulated in sub section
(1) and sub section (8) are almost similar in effect. The specific similarity in the two
subsectionsare that in both the subsections the provisions speak about regular tax
payers who have been in the CENVAT chain all along and who have excess credit in
the last return of the erstwhile law preceding the date of inception of GST viz
01.07.2017. The difference between the two subsectionsis that while subsection (1)
takes in its hold, manufacturers and service providers with single
registration,subsection (8) deals with the centralised registration that was one of the
norms in the service tax registration. First provision to subsection(8) of Section 140
further provides a leverage of 3 months to such assessee to transitioned the credit
even postinception of GST. The other subsection deals with other specified
circumstances, exempt goods or services in the earlier regime.
b. However, the commonality in all the subsections except subsection (8) the phrase
used is either “CENVAT Credit of the eligible duties” or “CENVAT Credit of eligible
duties and taxes”.The term “of eligible duties” or “of eligible duties and taxes” is not
there in subsection (8) of section 140 of the CGST Act, 2017. Thus, the contention of
the respondent is that they fall under section 140(8) as they were having centralised
registration in the earlier regime and that as the subsection does not contained the
phrase “of eligible duties” or “of eligible duties and taxes”. The CENVAT credit
pertaining to Education Cess, Secondary and Higher Education Cess and Krishi
Kalyan Cess can be transitioned http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in
WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland
Global Services Private Limited] into the GST regime.
This contention is refuted by the appellant .
c. Regarding the contention that section 140(8) does not contain the phrase “of
eligible duties” or “of eligible duties and taxes”. The appellants submits that a
harmonious construction of section 140 of the CGST Act, 2017 as a whole indicates
that the draftsman intended the transition of only the eligible duties and taxes of the
earlier regime that has been subsumed prior to the inception of GST.
d. Thus as on 01.07.2017 Education Cess, Secondary and Higher Education Cess and
Krishi Kalyan Cess had been abolished vide Taxation Law Amendment Act, 2017
04.05.2017, along with other levies. Hence the above three cesses were not subsumed
along with the 14 taxes and duties on the date of inception of the GSTEnactment and
hence transition of the same is not possible.Thus, the intention of the draftsman is
discernible that the CENVATCredit of the cesses was never intended to be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/112932804/ 26
Assistant Commissioner Of Cgst And ... vs Sutherland Global Services Private ... on 16 October, 2020
transitioned.
e. The respondent contention that the absence of the words “of eligible duties”in Section 140(8)
would mean that even CENVAT Credit pertaining to cessescould be transitioned, is wholly
untenable. It is submitted that as all the other subsection using the phrase “CENVATCredit “of
eligible duties” or CENVAT credit “of eligible duties and taxes”,the absence of the phrase “eligible
duties” in subsection 8 is nothing but an unintentional oversight by the draftsman and not
intentional.
f. On a harmonious construction of entire section 140 which deals withtransitioning of only the
subsumed duties and taxes,a literal interpretation by the respondent to make subsection (8) as a
standalone provisionwill only lead to absurdity.
http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of
CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] g. To support this contention,
the appellants herein relies on the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Dilip S. Dhanukar Vs.
Kotak Mahindra Co. Ltd. and Ors.[MANU/SC/8289/2007] wherein the Doctrine of Purposive
Interpretation has been explained with reference to Bennion’s Statutory Interpretation. According
to Bennion’s Statutory Interpretation relied by the Hon’ble Supreme Court,three condition are
necessary to employ the doctrine of purposive interpretation in place of literal interpretation :-
1. Whether the reading of the whole statuteor provision would determine precisely
what the mischief was, the purpose of the act of was to remedy.
2. That the draftsman and Parliament had by inadvertent overlooked and omitted to
deal with the eventuality that required to be dealt with, if the purpose of the Act is to
be achieved.
3. It was possible to state with certainty what would be the additional word that
would have been inserted by the draftsman and approved by the Parliament before
the bill passed into law.
h. Applying the doctrine of purposive interpretation to subsection(8) of section 140, the appellant
submits that the three-condition laid down above are satisfied.
1. The purpose of section 140 was to transition only the subsumed duty and taxes which were in
existence as on 01.07.2017 and it was never the intention to transition the cesses which have been
abolished much prior to 01.07.2017.
2. The draftsmen by inadvertencehad overlooked the phrase “of eligible duties” and the omission is
not intentional.
3. It can be said with certainty that the additional words which would have been inserted by the
draftsman had the attention been drawn much earlier would be “of eligible duties”.

http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of
CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] LEGAL PROPOSITION VI :-
Implied Lapse a. Thus the last legal proposition submitted by the appellant herein that Section
140(1) and Section 140(8) signifies an implied lapse of the availed CENVAT Credit of Education
Cess, Secondary and Higher Education Cess and Krishi Kalyan Cess which were availed and lying
unutilised in earlier regime and thus cannot be transitioned into the GST Regime.
Thus, in the circumstances stated above and those urged in the Grounds of Appeal and oral
arguments, it is prayed that this Hon’ble Court may be pleased to ALLOW the Writ Appeal 53/2020
, pass such other order or orders as this Hon’ble Court may deem fit and proper in the
circumstances of the case and thus render justice."
Contentions raised on behalf of Respondent/Assessee
21. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondent Assessee, Mr.Raghavan Ramabadran,
supported the order of the learned Single Judge and urged that as per CENVAT Rules, 2004, the
Assessee had already taken or availed the credit of the Education Cess and Secondary and Higher
Education Cess paid by him on the inputs and therefore, the right to utilise the same against the
Output Tax Liability was a vested and indefeasible right of the Assessee and could not be taken away
by the Legislature when a switch over was made to GST Regime with effect from 01.07.2017.
http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of
CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited]
22. Elaborating his arguments, he submitted that the present Assessee provides Countrywide
Technical Services and Call Centre facilities to its customers, on a centralised registration under the
provisions of CGST Act and therefore, in terms of Section 140(8) of the CGST Act, it was entitled to
avail credit of the amount of CENVAT credit as defined in CENVAT Rules, 2004 against its Output
Tax Liability even under the GST Regime. He submitted that the amendment to Section 140(1) by
CGST (Amendment) Act, 2018 with retrospective effect from 01.07.2017 by insertion of words "of
eligible duties" in Section 140(1) of the Act and the words "eligible duties and tax" did not affect
Section 140(8) of the Act, as no such similar insertions were made in Section 140(8) of the Act and
the said Sub-
section (8) of Section 140 independently covers the case of the present Assessee which entitled him
to take such credit of the Education Cess and Secondary and Higher Education Cess, even after the
introduction of GST Regime with effect from 01.07.2017. He submitted that such Cess was collected
in the form of duty and taxes only and therefore, even though they were imposed by the Finance Act,
the collection of levy was in the nature of duty or tax and the same was liable to be set off and
utilised against the Output Tax http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of
2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited]
Liability.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/112932804/ 28
Assistant Commissioner Of Cgst And ... vs Sutherland Global Services Private ... on 16 October, 2020
23. Though the learned counsel for the Assessee admitted that cross utilisation of Cess against the
Output Tax Liability of Excise Duty and Service Tax prior to introduction of GST Regime on
01.07.2017 was not permitted as per Rule 7 of the CENVAT Rules, 2004 and Cess could be set off
only against the Output Levy of Cess while the said imposition was operating, but, nonetheless, the
CENVAT Credit in respect of such Cess, which was not so far utilised and such credit was carried
forward in its Electronic Ledger which was submitted in the form of TRAN-1 Form as required in the
new GST provisions was never objected to by the Revenue authorities until the impugned
communication was issued to the Assessee on 14.02.2018 which led to the filing of the writ petition.
Therefore, the learned Single Judge was justified in allowing the same to the Assessee.
24. The learned counsel for the Assessee also submitted that Explanation 1 and 2 of Section 140 of
the CGST Act clearly stipulated and while Explanation 1 talks of the expressions "Eligible Duties" in
Sub-sections (1), (3), (4) and (6) of Section 140, Explanation 2 talks http://www.judis.nic.in
Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v.
Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] of expressions "Eligible Duties and Tax" in Sub-sections
(1) and (5), under the specified enactments mentioned in Explanations 1 and 2 and since the
Education Cess and Secondary and Higher Education Cess were not mentioned in those
Explanations 1 and 2, therefore, the Cess did not fall within the ambit and scope of "Eligible Duties"
or "Eligible Duties and Taxes" and the claim of the Assessee with respect to the set off could not be
denied on the anvil of the said expressions. He also submitted that the CGST (Amendment) Act,
2018 insofar as it amended Explanations 1 and 2 to Section 140 were not yet enforced and would be
so enforced from a date which was yet to be notified and therefore, the Assessee's claim under
Section 140(8) of the Act could not be defeated taking help of Explanation 3 as well. Explanation 3
was inserted in Section 140 also by CGST (Amendment) Act, 2018, with retrospective effect from
01.07.2017 when GST Regime was made operational.
25. The learned counsel for the respondent Assessee also relied upon the case laws which will be
discussed hereafter.
26. The learned counsel for the Assessee also filed his written http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt.
16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland
Global Services Private Limited] submissions and the same is taken on record and it is extracted as

WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE 1stRESPONDENT (ASSESSEE) Issue involved:
Can CENVAT credit of Education Cess (‘Edu Cess’), Secondary & Higher Education
Cess (‘SHE Cess’) and Krishi Kalyan Cess (‘KKC’) (collectively referred to as ‘Cesses’)
which are validly availed and lying unutilized as per the last return filed for the
period ending 30th June 2017, be transitioned into the GST regime?
Respondent Assessee’s submissions:
A. Unutilised CENVAT credit can be transitioned under Section 140(8) of CGST Act.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/112932804/ 29
Assistant Commissioner Of Cgst And ... vs Sutherland Global Services Private ... on 16 October, 2020
A.1 The assessee had a Centralized registration under the Finance Act, 1994 and the
impugned Cess credits were being carried forward in the periodic Returns and
declared as unutilized credit in their Return (in Form ST-3 for service tax assessees)
filed for the period ending June 2017. This is an undisputed fact.
A.2 The factum of valid availment (act of taking credit – does not denote utilization
or adjustment) of the impugned Cess credit is undisputed.
A.3 Hence, the eligibility to the impugned Cess credit till 30th June 2017 cannot be
disputed. (Refer para A.11 below) A.4 The credit which is validly availed under the
erstwhile laws (here, Cenvat Credit Rules, 2004) and lying unutilized as on 30 June
2017 can be transitioned into the GST regime only through Section 140 of the CGST
Act. In other words, http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53
of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services
Private Limited] Section 140 of the CGST Act is the only provision which provides for
the mechanism of transitioning credits eligible under the erstwhile laws into the GST
regime.
Each sub-Section of 140 deals with a specific scenario A.5 The said provision consists
of several sub-sections, each of which is in relation to a specific independent scenario
of transition. The following table would illustrate the purpose of each sub-Section of
Section 140.
Sub-Section Purpose
140(1) Transition of already availed cenvat credit
reflected in the last Returns filed under the erstwhile laws. It is based on credit
availed and remaining unutilized in the Returns. 140(2) It covers transition of
unavailed credit on capital goods under the erstwhile laws. CCR restricts credit on
capital goods for the first year to be 50%. The remaining portion of credit unavailed,
which is not covered under the Returns filed under erstwhile laws, is granted. It is not
covered under Section 140(1).
140(3) It covers registered person who was enjoying exemption from output liability
under erstwhile laws but is subject to GST liability. It grants credit in respect of
inputs lying in stock as on 01.07.2017. It is not covered under Section 140(1).
140(4) It covers registered person who was engaged in both taxable and exempted
activities under erstwhile laws but is now wholly subject to GST liability. It grants
credit as reflected in the last Returns filed and also credit in respect of inputs lying in
stock as on 01.07.2017. It is not covered under Section http://www.judis.nic.in
Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST &
Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] 140(1).
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/112932804/ 30
Assistant Commissioner Of Cgst And ... vs Sutherland Global Services Private ... on 16 October, 2020
140(5) It covers a situation of goods in-transit, invoices in transit and the like where the duty/tax
has been paid under the erstwhile laws and the actual receipt of inputs/ input services is after
introduction of GST. It grants credit in respect of those duty/tax paid documents within a period of
30 days from receipt. It is not covered under Section 140(1).
140(6) It covers a situation wherein the registered person was paying duty based on capacity of
manufacture, taxes under composition scheme and the like but has chosen to discharge GST liability
at normal rates. It grants credit in respect of inputs lying in stock as on 01.07.2017. It is not covered
under Section 140(1).
140(7) It provides for distribution of credit availed by Input Service Distributor in respect of services
received prior to GST. It is not covered under Section 140(1).
140(8) It provides for transition of CENVAT credit in respect of centralized registered person under
the Finance Act, 1994. It is not covered under Section 140(1) according to the assessee.
140(9) It provides for taking recredit of CENVAT credit on input services in a situation where it is
reversed for non-payment of consideration within three months. It is not covered under Section
140(1).
A.6 It is submitted that there is no overlap in the situations contemplated in each sub-Section of
Section 140. Thus, each http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020
[Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited]
sub-Section is independent, stand alone and self-contained dealing with separate scenarios,
enabling seamless transition of credit.
A.7 While Section 140(1) governs a situation of transition of credits lying unutilized in the last return
filed under erstwhile laws, a very similar phraseology is also available in Section 140(8). The only
difference between Section 140(1) and Section 140(8) is that sub-Section (8) deals specifically to a
case of dealers having centralized registration while sub- Section (1) does not have such
qualification. If both the provisions are to be construed harmoniously so that no provision is
rendered otiose, then Section 140(1) should be read as covering all scenarios other than the case of
dealers having centralized registration. Thus, both the provisions can co-exist, have its full play and
no part of any provision be rendered redundant. Reliance in this regard is placed on CCE v.
Universal Ferro and Allied Chemicals Ltd. 2020 5 SCC 332 [paragraph 46 to 48] A.8 Since the
assessee was having a centralized registration, the assessee’s case would be squarely covered by
Section 140(8) being a specific provision as compared to Section 140(1).
A.9 Section 140(8) of the CGST Act states that a registered person having centralized registration
under the existing Law (Finance Act, 1994) and has obtained a registration under the CGST Act,
shall be allowed to take (avail), in his electronic credit ledger, credit of the amount of CENVAT
Credit carried forward in the returns, furnished under the existing law (ST-3 Returns) in respect of
the period ending with the day immediately preceding the appointed day (April- June 2017) in such
manner as may be prescribed. First Proviso states that if the last period’s Returns under existing law
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/112932804/ 31
Assistant Commissioner Of Cgst And ... vs Sutherland Global Services Private ... on 16 October, 2020
is filed within three months of the appointed day, the credit as reflected in the original/revised
Return shall be http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst.
Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] allowed.
The assessee filed the ST-3 Returns for April-June 2017 using this extended time period provided.
Second Proviso states that the credit shall not be allowed unless it is eligible as an Input Tax Credit
under GST. It is an admitted position that second Proviso is not attracted in the present case.
Further, third Proviso to Section 140(8) of the CGST Act states that such credit may be transferred
to any of the registered persons having the same PAN for which centralized registration was
obtained under the existing law.
A.10 Explanation to Section 143 of the CGST Act states that the term ‘CENVAT credit’ shall have the
same meaning as assigned to it under Central Excise Act, 1944 (‘Excise Act’) or the rules made
thereunder for the purpose of the Chapter on transitional provisions.
A.11 Cenvat Credit Rules, 2004 (‘CCR’, in short) was framed under the powers conferred by Section
37 of the Central Excise Act, 1944 (‘Excise Act’). Rule 3(1) of CCR is the provision allowing persons
to take (avail) CENVAT credit. It enumerates the various duties and taxes that can be taken as
CENVAT credit. Education Cess and Secondary and Higher Education Cess are enumerated under
clause (vi) and (via) respectively. Further, as per Rule 3(1a) of CCR, Krishi Kalyan Cess can also be
taken as CENVAT credit. Hence, all the three Cesses qualify to be ‘CENVAT credit’ as per Rule 3(1)
of CCR.
A.12 Thus on a plain construction of Section 140(8), credit of Cesses is eligible to be transitioned.
The submission of the Appellant Department that the words ‘eligible duties’ should be read into
Section 140(8) would amount to causing violence to the provision and hence impermissible.
A.13 When the Legislature introduced the words ‘eligible duties’ by way of a retrospective
amendment in Section 140(1) vide Central Goods and Services Tax (Amendment)
http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of
CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] Act, 2018 (‘Amendment Act’),
it has deliberately chosen not to amend sub-Section (8). Hence, a purpose and intent behind the
non-amendment should be imputed and thereby the wisdom of the Legislature should be respected.
Therefore, the said expression ‘eligible duties’ ought not to be read into the provision. Reliance is
placed on decision of P.M. AshwathanarayanaSetty v. State of Karnataka, 1989 Supp. (1) SCC 696
[Paragraph 30] to state that legislative wisdom ought not to be questioned. It cannot be merely
ignored as an oversight by the Legislature as was submitted by the Appellant Department.
A.14 Further, it is a settled position that Courts do not read words and expressions not found in the
provision/statute as it would amount to venturing into a kind of judicial legislation. Reliance in this
regard is placed on Union of India v. Ind- Swift Laboratories Ltd. 2011 (265) ELT 3 (S.C.) and CIT v.
Calcutta Knitwears (2014) 6 SCC 444 (paragraphs 29 to 31). Such an exercise would amount to a
situation of casus omissus which is impermissible for the Courts to do. Therefore, these words
cannot be supplied into the provisions. Reliance in this regard is placed on UOI Vs. Deoki Nandan
Aggarwal 1992 AIR 96 SC [paragraph 14], B.R. Kapur v. State of T.N. &Anr. (2001) 7 SCC
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/112932804/ 32
Assistant Commissioner Of Cgst And ... vs Sutherland Global Services Private ... on 16 October, 2020
231[paragraph 39] and UOI v. Dharmendra Textile Processors 2008 13 SCC 369 [paragraph 16].
A.15 The Appellant Department has placed reliance on Dilip S Dhanukar v. Kotak Mahindra Ltd. &
Ors.
[MANU/SC/8289/2007] for adopting purposive interpretation. The said decision was rendered in
the context of personal liberties of an accused while interpreting criminal law provisions and Article
21. The same principle cannot be applied for interpreting taxing statutes wherein, as stated above, it
has been held time and again that literal interpretation ought to be adopted. Further reliance is also
placed on CST v. Modi Sugar Mills Ltd. AIR 1961 SC 1047 http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt.
16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland
Global Services Private Limited] and Ind-Swift Laboratories Ltd. case (supra), which was held in the
context of CENVAT Credit itself.
A.16 Further, it is submitted that the assessee has all along maintained its claim under Section
140(8) and never had forsaken it. It is not the case of the Appellant/Department that the assessee
does not fall under Section 140(8). In any case, even assuming without conceding that the said claim
was forsaken, reliance is placed upon Hon’ble Supreme Court decision in Share Medical Care v. UOI
2007 (209) ELT 321 (SC) to advance the argument that there is no estoppel in claiming the benefit
at a later stage. It was held therein that even if an applicant does not claim benefit at initial stage, he
is not debarred, prohibited or estopped from claiming such benefit at a later stage.
B. Alternatively, transitional credit is valid under Section 140(1).
B.1 Section 140(1) of the CGST Act states that a person registered both under the existing law and
GST, shall be allowed to take, in his electronic credit ledger, credit of the amount of ‘CENVAT Credit
of eligible duties’ carried forward in the returns, furnished under the existing law by him (ST-3
Returns) in respect of the period ending with the day immediately preceding the appointed day
(April-June 2017) in such manner as may be prescribed. It is an admitted position that the provisos
to Section 140(1) are not attracted in the present case.
B.2 The submissions in paragraph A10 & A11 above on the meaning of CENVAT credit and how the
Cesses are covered under the same in the context of Section 140(8) is applicable to Section 140(1) as
well.
B.3 The assessee submits that the true meaning of the term ‘eligible duties’ in Section 140(1) needs
to be then examined. B.4 The term ‘eligible duties’ is defined in Explanation 1 to
http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of
CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] Section 140 as being
applicable to transition of credit under Section 140(6). It is for this reason that it states that the
same would mean the duties enumerated therein, paid on inputs held in stock and inputs contained
in semi-finished or finished goods held in stock on the appointed day. Though the Amendment Act
proposed to extend it to Sub-sections 1,3 & 4 of Section 140(1) as well, the same is not in force as the
Central Government has deliberately chosen not to notify it. Thus, meaning of ‘eligible duties’ in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/112932804/ 33
Assistant Commissioner Of Cgst And ... vs Sutherland Global Services Private ... on 16 October, 2020
Explanation 1 to Section 140 cannot be extended to Section 140(1). It is reiterated that it is not a
mere inadvertent error but a deliberate decision. Hence, the purpose of not notifying should be
looked into. Therefore, the said expression ‘eligible duties’ in Section 140(1) ought not to be read as
defined under Explanation 1 to Section 140, which is for a wholly different purpose and situation.
B.5 Since Explanation 1 of Section 140 cannot be attracted and Explanation 2 is not applicable,
eligible duties in 140(1) is to be understood in its normative sense. In the context of CENVAT credit,
it is submitted that it ought to be understood as duties which are eligible for availmentas CENVAT
credit. Impugned Cesses are duties of excise though not Basic Excise Duty.
B.6 It is submitted that the impugned Cesses are duties of excise/ taxes. These Cesses are imposed
on the event of manufacture/ provision of service and therefore, it would partake the character of
duties of excise or tax on service, as the case may be.
B.7 Edu Cess and SHE Cess were levied on manufactured goods based on the powers conferred
under Entry 84 of Union List, Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. The same, prior to 101st
Constitutional Amendment Act, reads as follows:
“Duties of excise on tobacco and other goods manufactured or produced in India
except— http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020
[Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private
Limited]
(a) alcoholic liquors for human consumption;
(b) opium, Indian hemp and other narcotic drugs and narcotics, but including
medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol or any substance included in
sub-paragraph (b) of this entry.” B.8 Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Governor
General-
in Council v. Province of Madras 1954 SCR 1046 [paragraph 23 in Hingir-Rampur decision at page
98 in Assessee Respondent’s paperbook dated 30th September 2020] has held that a duty of excise
is primarily a duty levied on manufacturer or producer in respect of the commodity manufactured or
produced. It is on account of this reason that the charging Section of Edu Cess and SHE Cess on
excisable goods under Finance Act 2004 and Finance Act, 2007 levy it as duties of excise.
The Impugned Cesses are levied as tax and not as fee. B.9 It is further submitted that all the
impugned Cesses are levied as duties and taxes and not as a fee. While the assessee elaborates the
same infra, it is not the case of the assessee that these Cesses are basic excise duty levied under
Central Excise Act. In other words, this is a cess levied as a duty and it is in the character of duties of
excise but it is not excise duty per se.
B.10 Further, Edu Cess and SHE Cess on taxable services and KKC are also covered under the term
‘eligible duties’ in Section 140(1) as the term duties encompasses taxes within its ambit as well.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/112932804/ 34
Assistant Commissioner Of Cgst And ... vs Sutherland Global Services Private ... on 16 October, 2020
Article 366(28) of the Constitution defines ‘taxation’ to include includes the imposition of any tax or
impost, whether general or local or special and that the term ‘tax’ shall be construed accordingly.
Department’s Circular in No. 87/06/2019-GST dated 02.01.2019 states that the term duties and
taxes are used interchangeably [paragraph 3.1.(iii) at page 30 of the paperbook dated 23rd January
http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of
CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] 2020]. Hence, Edu Cess and
SHE Cess on taxable services and KKC, being in the nature of taxes, are also covered under the term
‘eligible duties’ in Section 140(1). B.11 Much reliance has been placed by the Appellant Department
on UOI v. Modi Rubber Ltd. 1986 (25) ELT 849 (SC) and Unicorn Industries v. UOI 2019 (370)
E.L.T. 3 (S.C.). At the outset it is submitted that the same are not relevant for the issue in hand. In
Modi Rubber Ltd. case, the issue involved was whether exemption Notification issued under Rule
8(1) of Central Excise Rules can be borrowed for claiming exemption from special duties of excise
levied under Finance Act, 1979. The Court held that the power to grant exemption under Rule 8(1) is
only in respect of basic excise duty under the Excise Act. Therefore, any Notification issued under
the said Rule cannot be read as extending the benefit to levies created under a different Enactment
like Finance Acts. In other words, this decision is not an authority on the point whether special
excise duties are duties of excise or not. Similarly, in the Unicorn Industries case, the issue was
whether an exemption Notification issued under Section 5A of the Excise Act can be automatically
applied for claiming exemption from Cesses levied under various Finance Acts. It is submitted that
none of these are authorities to decide whether cesses are duties of excise. The only conclusion that
can be drawn from these cases at best is that Cesses levied under Finance Acts are not Basic Excise
Duty. The assessee also admits to this legal position and therefore, reference to these decisions do
not advance the case of either side in this Writ Appeal.
Explanation 2 and 3 to Section 140 are not attracted. B.12 It is submitted that Explanation 2 to
Section 140 defines the expression ‘eligible duties and taxes’. The said definition is irrelevant for
both Section 140(1) and 140(8) as the same is not employed therein. Further, the amendment
sought to be made under the Amendment Act to extend the application of the definition to Section
140(1), has not been notified in http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of
2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited]
respect of this Explanation 2 as well.
B.13 Further, Explanation 3 to Section 140 clarifies that the expression ‘eligible duties and taxes’
does not include any Cess not mentioned in Explanation 1 and Explanation 2. This Explanation 3
insertion to Section 140 of CGST Act has been notified. However, as stated earlier, since the
expression ‘eligible duties and taxes’ is not employed either in Section 140(1) and Section 140(8) and
Explanation 3 being only in the nature of explaining the scope of the said expression, the said
Explanation 3 becomes irrelevant in understanding the scope and coverage of Section 140(1) and
Section 140(8). Hence, the same is not applicable to the present case even though it has been
notified. C. Cesses are in the nature of duty and not fee. C.1 In the case of Hingir-Rampur Coal Ltd.
v. State of Orissa AIR 1961 SC 459, Constitution Bench of Hon’ble Supreme Court affirmed the basic
tests, laid down in previous cases, for determining the character of a cess levy – whether it is in the
nature of a tax or fee. It held that a tax is imposed for public purposes and is not, and need not, be
supported by any consideration of service rendered in return, whereas a fee is levied essentially for
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/112932804/ 35
Assistant Commissioner Of Cgst And ... vs Sutherland Global Services Private ... on 16 October, 2020
services rendered and as such there is an element of quid pro quo between the person who pays the
fee and the public authority which imposes it. It further held that tax recovered by public authority
invariably goes into the Consolidated Fund which ultimately is utilised for all public purposes,
whereas a cess levied by way of fee is not intended to be, and does not become, a part of the
Consolidated Fund. It is earmarked and set apart for the purpose of services for which it is levied.
C.2 Reliance in this regard is also placed on the following cases.
http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of
CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] Case law Reference paragraph
numbers Shinde Brothers v. Deputy 26 to 31, 66 & 67 Commissioner AIR 1967 SC 1512 Tamilnadu
Minerals v. Joint 21 to 27 Commissioner (2019) 414 ITR 196 (Mad) Shri Krishna Rubber Works v.
UOI 30 to 42 1970 SCC Online Bom 90 C.3 Further, Hon’ble Karnataka High Court in the case of
CCE v. Shree Renuka Sugars Ltd. 2014 (302) ELT 33 (Kar), while holding that Sugar Cess is in the
nature of a tax/duty, held that if the cess levied and collected is credited to the Consolidated Fund of
India and it has to be appropriated by the Parliament by law and then only the said amount could be
credited to the Fund; it ceases to be a fee and partakes the character of a duty or a tax.
C.4 A conjoint reading of the all the above judgements would clearly indicate that when an impost
(by whatever name called) goes to the Consolidated Fund of India and not to any specific fund
earmarked for the purpose, then such impost would acquire the character of taxes and not fee.
Impugned Cesses collected form part of Consolidated Fund of India C.5 Supplementing this
submission, reference is next made to the treatment of the impugned Cesses collected by the Central
Government with the aid of provisions in the Constitution and Comptroller & Auditor General of
India (‘CAG’) Reports.
C.6 As per Article 266(1) of the Constitution, all revenues collected by the Central Government shall
form part of the Consolidated Fund of India. As per Article 266(2), all public
http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of
CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] monies collected shall be
credited to Public Account of India. As per Article 266(3), no money collected in Consolidated Fund
of India can be appropriated except with the authority of law and for the purposes and in the
manner mentioned in the Constitution. Therefore, all taxes are credited into Consolidated Fund of
India and used through an appropriation law passed. Whereas, any Cess collected as fee is collected
in a specific public account for the purposes mentioned and does not go into the Consolidated Fund
of India. Further, as per Article 114(3) of the Constitution, no money can be withdrawn from the
Consolidated Fund of India without an appropriation made under law in accordance with Article
114.
C.7 The CAG Reports relied upon by the assessee clearly establish that the Cesses are collected into
the Consolidated Fund of India and not credited into any specific fund set up for this purpose.
[pages 78, 78A, 81 – para 2.3.3, 84, 89 of paperbook dated 30th September 2020]. In fact no Fund
has ever been created for the purpose and a portion of the collections has been only transferred to a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/112932804/ 36
Assistant Commissioner Of Cgst And ... vs Sutherland Global Services Private ... on 16 October, 2020
Major head of account as part of Reserve Funds in Public Accounts. The money has not been spent
either for the stated purposes.
C.8 In the CAG Report for FY 2014-15, it has been stated that A non-lapsable fund for elementary
education known as Prarambhik Shiksha Kosh (PSK) was created in 2005-06 under non-interest
bearing section of the reserve funds in the Public Account. Further, it states that Edu Cess is initially
credited into Consolidated Fund of India and that there is no correlation between the collection of
Edu Cess and amount transferred into such PSK fund created. In respect of SHE Cess it states that
there is neither a fund was designated to deposit the proceeds of SHEC thereto nor schemes
identified on which the cess proceeds were to be spent.
C.9 CAG Report for FY 2016-17 states that SHE Cess http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt.
16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland
Global Services Private Limited] collected by Central Government is credited into Consolidated
Fund of India without creation of even a reserve fund in the Public Account. It also shows short-
transfer into the specified funds under the Public Account in respect of Edu Cess and KKC.
C.10 CAG Report for FY 2017-18 states that SHE Cess is retained in the Consolidated Fund of India,
even though Madhyamik and Uchchtar Shiksha Kosh (albeit created contrary to procedure) Fund
was created in August 2017. It further states that this Fund has not been made operationalized so
far.
C.11 The above CAG Reports evidence that the Impugned Cesses are retained in the Consolidated
Fund of India or are merely accounted under a distinct treasury account name in the Public
Account.Thus, it is submitted the Cesses having been deposited into Consolidated Fund of India and
there being no quid pro quo between collection and expenditure of these Cesses, they are in the
nature of tax and not fee.
C.12 It is submitted that it is for these reasons, even Hon’ble Delhi High Court in the Cellular
Operators Association of India v. UOI (2018) 14 GSTL 522 (Del.) at paragraph 12, held that Edu
Cess and SHE Cess are in the nature of taxes and not fees, even though it is not an excise duty or
service tax per se. It has also been the consistent stand of the Assessee Respondent that the
impugned cesses are not Excise Duties per se but only duty of excise.
Nomenclature is not relevant for determining nature of levy.
C.13 Reliance is also made on Vijayalakshmi Rice Mill &Ors. V. CTO (2006) 6 SCC763 wherein it has
been held that nomenclature is not relevant for determining whether a Cess is a tax or a fee
[paragraphs 14 & 15 at page 195 of paperbook dated 30th September 2020]. As an illustration,
http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of
CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] reference can be made to
Goods and Services Tax (Compensation to States) Act, 2017. Even though it is termed and collected
as Cess, the preamble to the said Act has no semblance of a Cess levy. The said Preamble reads as,
‘to provide for compensation to the States for the loss of revenue arising on account of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/112932804/ 37
Assistant Commissioner Of Cgst And ... vs Sutherland Global Services Private ... on 16 October, 2020
implementation of the goods and services tax..’. Thus, it is levied purely as a revenue generation
measure, though nomenclatured as a Cess.
C.14 In light of the above, EC, SHE Cess and KKC are in the nature of tax/duty only and not in the
nature of fee.
D. CENVAT Credit validly availed is a vested and indefeasible right.
D.1 It is submitted that the Impugned cesses were imposed under various Finance Acts and their
levy were subsequently abolished. It is an undisputed fact that CENVAT Credit of these Cesses are
availed through the provisions of CCR. CCR has been enacted using the powers conferred under
Section 37 of the Excise Act. It is further submitted that Section 38A(c) of the Excise Act specifically
saves any right accrued under any Rule amended, repealed, superseded or rescinded. Hence, while
the levy was abolished, the CENVAT Credit availed under Rule 3 of CCR is specifically saved under
Section 38A of the Excise Act.
D.2 Assessee submits that CENVAT Credit of Cesses validly availed by the assessee is a vested and
indefeasible right and cannot be taken away without the authority of law. Reliance in this regard is
placed on Eicher Motors Ltd. v. UOI 1999 (106) ELT 3 (SC) and CCE v. Dai IchiKarkaria Ltd. 1999
(112) ELT 353 (SC).
D.3 Further reliance is placed on the following cases wherein it has been held that credit validly
availed is a vested right under money credit scheme and the assessee was allowed to be utilize such
credit even after abolishing of the Notification http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in
WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services
Private Limited] providing for utilization of such credit.
a. Rasoi Ltd. v. UOI (2004) 176 ELT 101 (Cal) at paragraph 11-13.
b. Madhusudhan Industriesv. UOI (2014) 309 ELT 54 (Guj.) at para 12-14.
There is no concept of implied lapsing. Credit once validly availed cannot be taken away without
express authority of law.
D.4 It is submitted that no provision is enacted to lapse the said CENVAT credit pertaining to the
Impugned Cesses. Section 37(xxviii) of the Excise Act specifically confers powers on the Central
Government to frame Rules for lapsing credits lying unutilized. Thus, lapsing of credits can happen
only through framing of Rules for the purpose. It can never be through a mere implication.
D.5 It is submitted that had the intention of the Central Government been to lapse such CENVAT
credit, it ought to have enacted lapsing provisions on the lines of Rule 11(2), 11(3), 11(4) of CCR etc.
Even under the prior excise credit regime, whenever it was the intention of the Central Government
to take away the existing un-utilized credits, the same was done by a specific lapsing provision such
as Rule 57F (4A) of the Central Excise Rules, 1944. This was worked out based on the Hon’ble
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/112932804/ 38
Assistant Commissioner Of Cgst And ... vs Sutherland Global Services Private ... on 16 October, 2020
Supreme Court decision in Eicher Motors (supra) (judgment dated 28.01.1999), wherein Section 37
of the Excise Act was amended to bring in Section 37(xxviii) which conferred power on the
Government to notify lapsing of credit. This was amended with retrospective effect from 16.03.1995
(through Finance Act, 1999) to take care of the lacunae pointed out in the Eicher Motors case.
Unlike the above, the Government has not exercised its powers under Section 37(xxviii) of the
Excise Act to lapse the CENVAT credit of EC, SHE Cess and KKC lying unutilized. In absence of the
same, there cannot be any implied lapse. D.6 Hence, the argument of the Appellant Department that
http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of
CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] the lapsing of CENVAT Credit
of Cesses has worked out itself without any exercise of power under Section 37(xxviii) of Excise Act
is not in line with the Eicher Motors case. D.7 It is an admitted position that no Rule has been
framed by the Central Government under Section 37(xxviii) of the Excise Act for lapsing of
unutilized CENVAT Credit of Impugned Cesses.
D.8 In light of the above, it is submitted that CENVAT Credit of Impugned Cesses lying unutilized as
on 30.06.2017 cannot be denied as already lapsed.
E. The concept of ‘availment’ and ‘utilization’ of CENVAT credit are distinct and cannot be mixed or
used interchangeably.
E.1 It is submitted that bar on utilization of CENVAT credit of Education Cess and Secondary and
Higher Education Cess until 30.06.2017 does not ipso facto vitiate the validity of availment of such
CENVAT credit. It is submitted that the concept of ‘availment’ and ‘utilization’ are distinct and
cannot be used interchangeably. This can be seen evidently seen from reading of the expression
contained in Rule 3(1) [taking credit] as against Rule 3(4) [utilization of credit] when read along
with Rule 14.
E.2 Further reliance is placed on decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court decision in Union of India v.
Ind-Swift Laboratories Ltd. 2011 (265) ELT 3 (S.C.). The issue before the court was whether interest
liability under Rule 14 of CCR would kick in from the date of taking CENVAT credit or from the date
of utilization of such CENVAT credit taken. The relevant phrase in Rule 14 read as“Where the
CENVAT credit has been taken or utilized wrongly or has been erroneously refunded”. While
holding that interest is payable from the date of taking CENVAT credit itself, the Hon’ble Court
acknowledged that taking credit and that of utilization of such credit taken are two distinct

has clearly admitted the difference between taking of CENVAT credit and its subsequent utilization.

E.4 Reliance has been placed on Hon’ble Supreme Court decisions in Osram Surya Pvt. Ltd. v. UOI
AIR 2002 SC 2194 and UOI v. Uttam Steel Ltd. (2015) 319 ELT 598 (SC) by the Appellant
Department to submit that dead claims cannot be revived.In the first case, the assessee had not
availed the credit but was yet to avail the credit. The Court held that there is no inherent right to
avail credit. In the present case, the credits have been already availed within the time-limit
prescribed under CCR. Hence, the said decision is not applicable.
E.5 The latter case is on the issue of rebate wherein, again the assessee did not claim it within the
time-limit. Both these decisions do not deal with a right that has legally vested already.Hence, the
same are not applicable.
Hon’ble Delhi High Court decision in Cellular Operators Association v. Union of India 2018 14 GSTL
522 (Del.) is not applicable to the facts of the present case.
E.6 Edu Cess and SHE Cess was levied by the Central Government. As stated above, Edu Cess and
SHE Cess paid by a service provider/ manufacturer on their input services/inputs, were made
eligible as CENVAT credit as per http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of
2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited]
Rule 3(1)(vi) & (via) of the CCR. Rule 3(7) of CCR provided for utilization of CENVAT credit of Edu
Cess and SHE Cess for payment of output Edu Cess and SHE Cess respectively. However, vide
Notification 15/2015-C.E dated 01.03.2015, the Central Government exempted levy of Education
Cess and Secondary and Higher Education Cess w.e.f. 01.06.2015. Therefore, as on 01.06.2015, the
CENVAT credit of Education Cess and Secondary and Higher Education Cess availed validly and
lying in the books could not be utilized for payment of any output tax liability.
E.7 This inability to utilize the CENVAT credit of Edu Cess and SHE Cess after 01.06.2015 was
challenged before Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Cellular Operators Association v. Union of India
(2018) 14 GSTL 522 (Del.). In other words, the case before the Hon’ble High Court was with regard
to whether Edu Cess and SHE Cess lying un-utilised as CENVAT credit as on the date of their
abolishment can be utilised for payment of Basic Excise Duty, Service Tax, etc. This judgment
nowhere discussed the validity of the CENVAT Credit of Edu Cess and SHE Cess availed and lying
un- utilized in the books. In other words, it is on utilization of credit as per then existing provisions
of law and not on availment. Further, even such restriction on utilization was upheld only on
account of express statutory bar to that effect in Rule 3(7)(b) and not on account of nature of those
Cesses (being in the nature of tax or fee) or any such reasons.
E.8 Hence, it is submitted that the ratio of the said decision is not relevant to the facts of the present
case.
E.9 It is also submitted that restriction on cross-utilization under erstwhile regime has no bearing
on the issue involved. Even National Calamity Contingent Duty, which is a Cess and contained
similar restriction on cross-utilization under erstwhile regime has been allowed to transition into
GST. Hence, it is submitted that a Cess whose cross-

CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] utilization was restricted
being transitioned into GST is not alien and unheard of to the Appellant Department.
In light of the above, it is submitted that this Hon’ble Court may be pleased to dismiss the Writ
Appeal and/or pass any such orders as it may deem fit."
Reasons for Cess being not eligible for carry forward, transition and set off against the Output GST
Liability under Section 140 of the CGST Act, are as under.
27. Firstly, we may state that obviously, there is no intendment or equity about taxation and both
the charging provisions as well as the exemption provisions in taxing statutes have to be strictly
construed and the Golden Rule of Interpretation of plain language being given plain meaning is the
cardinal principle applicable to taxing statutes.
28. Cess being a specially collected or enforced imposition or impost is slightly different from Tax or
Duty, even though it may be collected in the form of Taxes or Duty under the parent law with which
the charging provisions of Cess under the same Act or separate Act as they are read and applied
mutatis mutandis, like Central Excise and Customs Duty Act. Even though the imposition and
collection of Cess http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst.
Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] may be
loosely termed as Tax or Duty, the collection of Cess remains distinct, inasmuch as Cess amount
collected by the Government is liable to be spent for the avowed and dedicated purpose for which
such imposition was made which is usually reflected in the name of the imposition itself like
Education Cess, Secondary and Higher Education Cess etc. Mere facility of taking credit of Input
Cess paid on Input goods or services just to avoid the cascading effect on the multiple transactions
in the series does not militate or alter the character of the imposition of Cess itself. Like any other
indirect taxes like Sales Tax, VAT, Excise Duty, etc., the removal of the cascading effect of Taxation
in multiple transactions in series is provided by the Legislation to collect such taxes in a reasonable
proportion to the value of the transactions, by removing the cascading effect by providing for Input
Tax Credit (ITC) system.
29. Section 140 of the CGST Act, 2017, with which we are concerned and which provides for
transitional arrangement of Input Tax Credit, though comprises of 10 Sub-sections and the
Explanations 1, 2 and 3 after such 10 Sub-sections, are commonly applicable tools of interpretation.
The Explanation 1 refers to Sub-sections (1), (3), (4) http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt.
16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland
Global Services Private Limited] and (6), because these four Sub-sections use and employ the term
“Eligible Duties” and Explanation 1 confines "Eligible Duties" to 7 specified duties under that
Explanation 1, namely Additional Excise Duty under Additional Duties of Excise (Goods of Special
Importance) Act, 1957, Additional Duty under Custom and Tariff Act, 1975, Additional Custom Duty
on Taxable Articles, Duty of Excise in the First Schedule to the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985 and
National Calamity Contingency Duty under Section 136 of the Finance Act, 2001, etc.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/112932804/ 41
Assistant Commissioner Of Cgst And ... vs Sutherland Global Services Private ... on 16 October, 2020
30. Therefore, only the seven specified duties as “Eligible Duties” in respect of inputs held in stock
and inputs contained in semi finished or finished goods held in stock on the appointed date i.e.
01.07.2017 will be eligible to be carried forward and adjusted against GST Output Tax Liability with
reference to Explanation 1. Apparently, Education Cess and Secondary and Higher Education Cess
or Krishi Kalyan Cess are absent from the seven categories in Explanation 1. Therefore, on a plain
meaning, such three Cesses in question cannot be inserted in Explanation 1 to cover them for being
carried forward with reference to Explanation 1 which applies for specified four Sub-sections of
Section 140 of the Act.
http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of
CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited]
31. Similarly, Explanation 2 refers to Sub-sections (1) and (5) of Section 140 even though the words
“Eligible Duties and Taxes” jointly are not used in Sub-section (1) of Section 140, but are used only
in Sub-section (5) of Section 140, and again the eight specified “Eligible Duties and Taxes”, first
seven are repeat of Explanation 1 "Duties" and the eighth one is Service Tax, eligible to be set off and
carry forward under CGST Act, 2017.
32. A closer examination of Explanation 1 and Explanation 2 would indicate that while the first 7
items in Explanation 1 are just repeated in Explanation 2 and we cannot impute any redundancy for
such repetition to the Legislature, only Clause (viii) in Explanation 2 included Service Tax leviable
under Section 66B of the Finance Act, 1994 in respect of inputs and input services received on or
after appointed day, while Explanation 1 talks of inputs held in stock on the appointed day
01.07.2017.
33. The distinction between Explanation 1 and Explanation 2 is that while Explanation 1 was
intended to apply for the input Eligible http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA
No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private
Limited] Duties in respect of stocks and inputs contained in semi-finished or finished goods held in
stock as on 01.07.2017, the specified 8 taxes and duties were applicable in respect of inputs and
services received on or after 01.07.2017, the appointed day under GST Law. The addition of words
"and Taxes" with "Eligible Duties" in Explanation 2 appears to be only on account of addition of
"Service Tax" in Explanation 2 which specifies eight duties and taxes for set off.
34. Referring to Sub-section (5), which uses the terms “Eligible Duties and Taxes” will make this
purpose of inserting Explanation 2 in Section 140 clear because Sub-section (5) only permits such
credit to be taken even after such input services are paid before the appointed date of 01.07.2017,
but invoices in respect of them are received after the said appointed day of 01.07.2017 for which a
time period of 30 days is prescribed and the said period can still be extended by another 30 days for
reasons to be recorded by the Commissioner. Therefore, the Legislature has very carefully specified
the duties and taxes in respect of stocks held for which requisite declaration in Form TRAN-1 is
submitted as on 30th June 2017 and also the service tax in respect http://www.judis.nic.in
Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v.
Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] of services which are input services received before
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/112932804/ 42
Assistant Commissioner Of Cgst And ... vs Sutherland Global Services Private ... on 16 October, 2020
30th June 2017 of which invoices may not have been received before that date and therefore, a
relaxation of 30 days is provided for them. Therefore, the Court by any intendment or implication
cannot include the aforesaid three types of Cesses, with which we are concerned, in the terms of
"Eligible Duties and Taxes" or "Eligible Duties" with reference to Explanation 1 and Explanation 2 to
be carried forward and transitioned under Section 140 of the Act.
35. The Legislature took further care by inserting Explanation 3 which is couched in negative terms
and for removal of any doubt, it further clarified that such eligible duties and taxes will exclude an
Cess which has not been specified in Explanations 1 and 2. We may point out here itself that for
example, National Calamity Contingent Duty imposed in Section 136 of the Finance Act, 2001,
though named it as duty was, in fact, a Cess and that fund was created to meet expenditure to
manage any national calamity. But, set off thereof has been specifically allowed by the Legislature
possibly because that levy imposed under the Finance Act, 2001 continued even after GST Regime
was in force with effect from 01.07.2017.
http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of
CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited]
36. But, as noted above, the imposition or levy of Education Cess and Secondary and Higher
Education Cess and Krishi Kalyan Cess did not operate after 01.07.2017. Explanation 3, in our
opinion, specifying that any kind of Cess will be excluded for the purpose of Section 140, makes the
intention of the Legislature very clear and Sub-section (8) of Section 140, which was emphasized by
the learned counsel for the Assessee before us, is not excluded from the effect and operation of
Explanation 3, because the exclusion is of any Cess which has not been specified in Explanations 1
and 2, Education Cess and Secondary and Higher Education Cess and Krishi Kalyan Cess are not
included in Explanations 1 and 2 at all. Therefore, the exclusion of Education Cess and Secondary
and Higher Education Cess for the purpose of carry forward and set off under Section 140 is
specifically provided in Explanation 3, which is clearly applicable to gather the legislative intent,
irrespective of piecemeal enforcement of Explanations 1 and 2 by the Legislature. Explanation 3 has
its own force and application and does not have a limited application only via the route of
Explanation 1 and Explanation 2. The Departmental Circular dated 02.01.2019, quoted above, in our
opinion, rightly clarified this position with http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA
No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private
Limited] reference to Explanation 3 to Section 140 of the Act.
37. Sub-section (8) of Section 140 provides for a registered person having centralized registration
under the existing law shall be allowed to take in his Electronic Credit Ledger, the credit of amount
of CENVAT Credit carried forward in the Return furnished under the existing law by him in respect
of the period ending with the day immediately preceding the appointed day. The Proviso requires
such registered person to furnish Return and the Second Proviso further provides that registered
person shall not be allowed to take credit unless the said amount is admissible as Input Tax Credit
under CGST Act.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/112932804/ 43
Assistant Commissioner Of Cgst And ... vs Sutherland Global Services Private ... on 16 October, 2020
38. Merely because the Assessee in the present case before us is a person having centralized
registration has "taken" in his Electronic Credit Ledger the amount of such Education Cess and
Secondary and Higher Education Cess, it does not entitle him to utilize the said unutilised amount
of Education Cess and Secondary and Higher Education Cess against the Output GST Liability. The
"taking" of the input credit in respect of Education Cess and Secondary and Higher
http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of
CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] Education Cess in the
Electronic Ledger after 2015, after the levy of Cess itself ceased and stopped, does not even permit it
to be called an input CENVAT Credit and therefore, mere such accounting entry will not give any
vested right to the Assessee to claim such transition and set off against such Output GST Liability.
The emphasis on the words "taken" or "availed" in contrast with the words "utilised", "adjusted" or
"set off" laid by the learned counsel for the Assessee is, with respects, misplaced. These words do not
lie in independent watertight silos or compartments. They are rather synonymous in the context of
controversy we are dealing with. Finally, what is important is whether the Assessee gets Education
Cess, Secondary and Higher Education Cess transitioned under Section 140 of the CGST Act or not.
It is like Input Credit being a Fruit, which if found to be spoilt or unfit for consumption, it has to be
thrown and if it is still fresh and worthy of being kept and used, it has to be so used. In our opinion,
Fruit of Input Credit of Education Cess and Secondary and Higher Education Cess became a spoilt
fruit in 2015 itself and was not fit to be carried forward and consumed (adjusted) after 01.07.2017.
39. Carry forward in Electronic Ledger and filing of Form TRAN-1 http://www.judis.nic.in
Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v.
Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] will not confer any such right on the Assessee and as
Lord Russell pointed out in an Income Tax matter in the case of BSC Footwear Ltd. v. Ridgway
(Inpsector of Taxes) [(1972) 83 ITR 269] that the Income Tax Law does not march step by step in
the divergent footprints of the accountancy provisions. Rightly so, mere accounting practice and
accounting entries do not confer a right on the Assessee in the taxation laws much less a vested right
which cannot be undone or curtailed by statutory provisions. Therefore, the claim of the Assessee
based on the carry forward of unutilised Education Cess and Secondary and Higher Education Cess
in the Electronic Ledger does not better its claim in any manner.
40. Admittedly, since the cross utilization of Education Cess and Secondary and Higher Education
Cess was not allowed against Excise Duty and other duties under existing law prior to GST Regime
and they could be set off only against the Output Education Cess and Secondary and Higher
Education Cess liability, once the levy itself ceased and dropped in 2015, the question of their carry
forward and utilization becomes only academic. Sub-section (8) of Section 140 and for that other
matter, any of the Sub-sections of Section 140 are not the http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt.
16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland
Global Services Private Limited] provisions in watertight compartments and do not operate in silos
and a harmonious reading of various Sub-sections of Section 140, together with the three
Explanations at the end of Section 140, has to be made by the Court to give it a purposeful meaning
for transition of the Input Tax Credit, against Output GST Liability. The different Sub-sections of
Section 140 only identify the class of Assessee; but a common thread of entitlement to carry forward
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/112932804/ 44
Assistant Commissioner Of Cgst And ... vs Sutherland Global Services Private ... on 16 October, 2020
and set off runs through them, of course, subject to Explanations 1, 2 and 3 appended to Section 140
of the Act. If one carefully compares all Sub-sections of Section 140, one can discern that while all
other Sub-sections talk of "entitled to take credit", Sub-section (8) uses the word "allowed to take".
The utilisation of such credit, even if taken in Electronic Ledger and notified in Form TRAN-1, does
not guarantee any such right of utilisation independent of other parts of Section 140 specially
ignoring Explanation 3. Sub-
section (8), therefore, cannot be said to be an independent Code of law for the dealers holding
centralised registration, as canvassed.
41. The contention of the learned counsel for the Assessee that the Assessee was having a centralized
registration and Input Education Cess and Secondary and Higher Education Cess being CENVAT
under http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner
of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] Cenvat Rules, 2004,
deserve to be carried forward and allowed as set off against GST Liability, merely because it had
carried forward the same in the Centralised Electronic Credit Ledger, has no substance.
Merely because the revenue authorities, after the cessation of levy of Education Cess and Secondary
and Higher Education Cess in the year 2015 did not take any action in the contemporary period,
until the impugned communication was issued to the Assessee on 09.02.2018, which triggered the
filing of the writ petition and asked the Assessee to reverse that entry in the Electronic Ledger, it
does not mean that the Assessee became so entitled to carry forward even a dead claim of unutilised
Education Cess and Secondary and Higher Education Cess against the Output GST Liability after
01.07.2017. The set off and such adjustments could be allowed only if it clearly fell within the
definition of “Eligible Duties” or “Eligible Taxes and Duties” as defined in Explanations 1 and 2. On
the contrary, Explanation 3 clearly excluded Cess to be so eligible for carry forward and set off.
Therefore, there is no iota of doubt that Cess of any kind except National Calamity Contingent Duty
(NCCD), which was so specified in Explanations 1 and 2 specifically could be allowed to be carried
forward and adjusted against Output GST Liability. It may be noted here that this NCCD is
http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of
CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] allowed to be transitioned not
as CENVAT credit, but because it is specifically included as "Eligible Duties" in Explanations 1 and 2
of Section 140 of the Act.
42. We found considerable force in the contention raised on behalf of the Revenue before us that
credit of such Education Cess and Secondary and Higher Education Cess which could not be utilised
against the Output Education Cess and Secondary and Higher Education Cess Liability, while the
said impost was in force prior to Finance Act, 2015, became a dead claim in the year 2015 itself and
therefore, there was no question of allowing a carry forward and set off after a gap of two years
against the Output GST Liability with effect from 01.07.2017.
43. What we have stated above is supported by the recent judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court in
the case of Unicorn Industries v. Union of India [decided on 6th December 2019 reported in (2020)
3 SCC 492] rendered after the judgment of the learned Single Judge dated 05.09.2019 impugned
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/112932804/ 45
Assistant Commissioner Of Cgst And ... vs Sutherland Global Services Private ... on 16 October, 2020
before us and therefore, the same could not be brought to the notice of the learned
http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of
CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] Single Judge.
44. The Hon’ble Supreme Court, in the case of Unicorn Industries v. Union of India [(2020) 3 SCC
492] followed the earlier decision in Union of India v. Modi Rubber Limited [(1986) 4 SCC 66] and
also held earlier two judgments of the Supreme Court by two Judges Bench as per incuriam and
concluded that a Notification containing an exemption from payment of basic duty of excise for
goods specified in the Notification dated 09.09.2003 and cleared by its units located in the State of
Sikkim had no reference to the exemption to other duties like National Calamity Contingent Duty
(NCCD), Education Cess and Secondary and Higher Education Cess and therefore, the said
Notification dated 09.09.2003 could not by implication be extended to exempt even the levy of these
Cesses in the form of National Calamity Contingent Duty, Education Cess and Secondary and
Higher Education Cess. The relevant extract from the said judgment from the Head Note of SCC is
quoted below for ready reference.
"It is obvious that when a notification granting exemption from duty of excise is
issued by the Central http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53
of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services
Private Limited] Government in exercise of the power under Rule 8(1) simpliciter,
without anything more, it must, by reason of the definition of "duty" contained in
Rule 2(v) which according to the well-recognised canons of constructiion would be
projected in Rule 8(1), be read as granting exemption only in respect of duty of excise
payable under the Central Excise Act, 1944. Undoubtedly, by reason of Section 32(4)
of the Finance Act, 1979 and similar provision in the other Finance Acts, Rule 8(1)
would become applicable empowering the Central Government to grant exemption
from payment of special duty of excise, but when the Central Government exercises
this power, it would be doing so under Rule 8(1) read with Section 32(4) or other
similar provision. The reference to the source of power in such a case would not be
just to Rule 8(1), since it does not of its own force and on its own language apply to
granting of exemption in respect of special duty of excise, but the reference would
have to be to Rule 8(1) read with Section 32(4) or other similar provision. (Para 44)
Union of India v. Modi Rubber Ltd. (1986) 4 SCC 66 :
1986 SCC (Tax) 781, followed.

Assistant Commissioner Of Cgst And ... vs Sutherland Global Services Private ... on 16 October, 2020
The Notification dated 9-9-2003 issued in the present case makes it clear that
exemption was granted under Section 5-A of the 1944 Act, concerning additional
duties under the 1957 Act and additional duties of excise under the 1978 Act. It was
questioned on the ground that it provided for limited exemption only under the Acts
referred to therein. There is no reference to the Finance Act, 2001 by which NCCD
was imposed, and the Finance Acts of 2004 and 2007 were not in vogue. The
notification was questioned on the ground that it should have included other duties
also. The notification could not have contemplated the inclusion of education cess
and secondary and higher education cess imposed by the Finance Acts of 2004 and
2007 in the nature of the duty of excise. The duty on NCCD, education cess and
secondary and higher education cess are in the nature of additional excise duty and it
would not mean that exemption Notification dated 9-9-2003 covers them
particularly when there is no reference to the notification issued under the Finance
Act, 2001. There was no question of granting exemptions related to cess was not in
vogue at the relevant time posed later on vide Section 91 of the 2004 Act and Section
126 of the 2007 Act. The provisions of the 1944 Act and the Rules made thereunder
shall be applicable to refund, and the exemption is only a reference to the source of
power http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst.
Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private
Limited] to exempt NCCD, education cess, secondary and higher education cess. A
notification has to be issued for providing exemption under the said source of power.
In the absence of a notification containing an exemption to such additional duties in
the nature of education cess and secondary and higher education cess, they cannot be
said to have been exempted.

45. Much reliance was placed by the learned counsel for the Assessee on the judgment of the
Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Eicher Motors v. Union of India [(1999) 106 ELT 3 (SC)], in
which dealing with the case of earlier system of Modvat before Cenvat Rules came into force and
Rule 57F(4A) of the Central Excise Rules, 1944 was questioned before the Hon'ble Supreme Court
and the Supreme Court struck down Rule 57F(4A) of the Central Excise Rules as being beyond the
Rule making powers conferred on the Central http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in
WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services
Private Limited] Government under Section 37 of the Central Excise Act, 1944, on the ground that a
right (of Modvat) accrued to the Assessee on the date when they paid the duty on the raw materials
or the inputs and that right would continue until the facility available thereto gets worked out or
those goods existed. The Court held that Section 37 of the Act does not enable the Government to
make Rule 57F(4A) to deny that right to the Assessee. Paragraph 6 of the said judgment is quoted

"6. We may look at the matter from another angle. If on the inputs the assessee had
already paid the taxes on the basis that when the goods are utilised in the
manufacture of further products as inputs thereto then the tax on these goods gets
adjusted which are finished subsequently. Thus a right accrued to the assessee on the
date when they paid the tax on the raw materials or the inputs and that right would
continue until the facility available thereto gets worked out or until those goods
existed. Therefore, it becomes clear that Section 37 of the Act does not enable the
authorities concerned to make a rule which is impugned herein and therefore, we
may have no hesitation to hold that the rule cannot be applied to the goods
manufactured prior to 16-3-1995 on which duty had been paid and credit facility
thereto has been availed of for the purpose of manufacture of further goods."
http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of
CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited]
46. The above judgment, with great respect, is not applicable to the case before us for two reasons.
Firstly, there is nothing like Rule 57F(4A) under challenge before us, nor the said judgment of the
Supreme Court dealt with a case of Cess, but was dealing with a Modvat credit of Excise Duty itself
paid on the inputs which was to be utilized against the Output Excise Duty on the finished goods.
That right, obviously so long as Modvat Rules existed, could not be altered as was done in the form
of Rule 57F(4A) and which was quashed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court. Here, we are concerned
with the imposition of Cess under different enactments like Finance Acts which held the field for a
particular period only and even ceased to operate before GST Regime was enforced on 01.07.2017
and the question of their transition as input credit in the new GST Regime is involved before us.
47. When the Cess could not be adjusted even against the normal Excise Duty under the CENVAT
Rules, the question of applying the ratio of Hon’ble Supreme Court judgment in the case of Eicher
Motors cannot arise. The said judgment is therefore distinguishable.
http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of
CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] Moreover, in paragraph 6 of
the judgment quoted above, one should mark the words of the Hon’ble Supreme Court that "the
right accrued would be continued until the facility available thereto gets worked out”. Obviously, the
adjustment of CENVAT or unutilised Education Cess or Secondary and Higher Education Cess
cannot work out because no Output Education Cess and Secondary and Higher Education Cess
Liability existed even prior to 01.07.2017, once the levy was dropped by the Finance Act, 2015. So,
there was no way to work out the credit of Education Cess and Secondary and Higher Education
Cess even against the Excise Duty on finished goods prior to 01.07.2017 much less against GST
Output Liability after 01.07.2017.
48. Another case law which was relied upon by the learned counsel for the Assessee was with regard
to words “credit taken or availed” as distinguished from the words “utilized for that purpose”.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/112932804/ 48
Assistant Commissioner Of Cgst And ... vs Sutherland Global Services Private ... on 16 October, 2020
The learned counsel relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Union of
India v. Ind-Swift Laboratories Ltd.
[(2012) 25 STR 184 (SC)]. However, we do not find any need to discuss the said judgment in detail
because no difference will be made even after the Assessee is treated as having taken the credit of
http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of
CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] Education Cess and
Secondary and Higher Education Cess in its Electronic Ledger, but not having utilised it so far until
30th June 2017, because admittedly, the unutilised Education Cess and Secondary and Higher
Education Cess could not be cross utilised against the usual Excise Duty payable under the Excise
Act, but could be utilized only against the Output Education Cess and Secondary and Higher
Education Cess leviable prior to 2015 before being dropped by the Finance Act, 2015.
49. Hypothetically, assuming that such Education Cess or Secondary and Higher Education Cess
was re-imposed by the Central Government in the Finance Act, 2016 or 2017 and there was some
Output Education Cess or Secondary and Higher Education Cess liability of the Assessee, one could
understand the claim of the Assessee of unutilised Input Cenvat in the form of Education Cess and
Secondary and Higher Education Cess to be allowed to be set off against such Output Education
Cess and Secondary and Higher Education Cess Liability re-imposed by subsequent enactment. But,
such is not the case available before us. Therefore, we have no doubt that the Input Cenvat Credit in
respect of Education Cess and http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of
2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited]
Secondary and Higher Education Cess to the extent of unutilised amount lying in its Electronic
Ledger was a dead claim and it became infructuous in the hands of the Assessee.
50. The distinction between the Cess, Fees, Tax and Duty was elaborately discussed by the
Constitution Bench of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Hingir Rampur Coal Limited v.
State of Orissa [AIR 1961 SC 459] and we find it useful to quote paragraphs 9 to 13 of the said
judgment.
"9. The first question which falls for consideration is whether the levy imposed by the
impugned Act amounts to a fee relatable to Entry 23 read with Entry 66 in List II.
Before we deal with this question it is necessary to consider the difference between
the concept of tax and that of a fee. The neat and terse definition of tax which has
been given by Latham, C. J., in Matthews v. Chicory Marketing Board (1) is often
cited as a classic on this subject. "A tax", said Latham, C. J., "is a compulsory exaction
of money by public authority for public purposes enforceable by law, and is not
payment for services rendered". In bringing out the essential features of a tax this
definition also assists in distinguishing a tax from a fee. It is true that between a tax
and a fee there is http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of
2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services
Private Limited] no generic difference. Both are compulsory exactions of money by
public authorities; but whereas a tax is imposed for public purposes and is not, and
need not, be supported by any consideration of service rendered in return, a fee is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/112932804/ 49
Assistant Commissioner Of Cgst And ... vs Sutherland Global Services Private ... on 16 October, 2020
levied essentially for services rendered and as such there is an element of quid pro
quo between the person who pays the fee and the public authority which imposes it.
If specific services are rendered to a specific area or to a specific class of persons or
trade or business in any local area, and as a condition precedent for the said services
or in return for them cess is levied against the said area or the said class of persons or
trade or business the cess is distinguishable from a tax and is described as a fee. Tax
recovered by public authority invariably goes into the consolidated fund which
ultimately is utilised for all public purposes, whereas a cess levied by way of fee is not
intended to be, and does not become, a part of the consolidated fund. It is earmarked
and set apart for the purpose of services for which it is levied.
There is, however, an element of compulsion in the imposition of both tax and fee. When the
Legislature decides to render a specific service to any area or to any class of persons, it is not open to
the said area or to the said class of persons to plead that they do not want the service and therefore
they should be exempted from the payment of the cess. Though there is an element of quid pro quo
between the tax- payer http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020
[Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] and
the public authority there is no option to the tax-payer in the matter of receiving the service
determined by public authority. In regard to fees there is, and must always be, co- relation between
the fee collected and the service intended to be rendered. Cases may arise where under the guise of
levying a fee Legislature may attempt to impose a tax; and in the case of such a colourable exercise
of legislative power courts would have to scrutinise the scheme of the levy very carefully and
determine whether in fact there is a co-relation between the service and the levy, or whether the levy
is either not co-related with service or is levied to such an excessive extent as to be a presence of a
fee and not a fee in reality. In other words, whether or not a particular cess levied by a statute
amounts to a fee or tax would always be a question of fact to be determined in the circumstances of
each case. The distinction between a tax and a fee is, however, important, and it is recognised by the
Constitution. Several Entries in the Three Lists empower the appropriate Legislatures to levy taxes;
but apart from the power to levy taxes thus conferred each List specifically refers to the power to
levy fees in respect of any of the matters covered in the said List excluding of course the fees taken in
any Court.
10. The question about the distinction between a tax and a fee has been considered by this Court in
three decisions in 1954. In The Commissioner, Hindu Religious http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment
dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland
Global Services Private Limited] Endowments, Madras v. Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri
Shirur Mutt the vires of the Madras Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act, 1951 (Madras
Act XIX of 1951), came to be examined. Amongst the sections challenged was Section 76(1). Under
this section every religious institution had to pay to the Government annual contribution not
exceeding 5% of its income for the services rendered to it by the said Government; and the argument
was that the contribution thus exacted was not a fee but a tax and as such outside the competence of
the State Legislature. In dealing with this argument Mukherjee, J., as he then was, cited the
definition of tax given by Latham, C.J., in the case of Matthews and has elaborately considered the
distinction between a tax and a fee. The learned judge examined the scheme of the Act and observed
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/112932804/ 50
Assistant Commissioner Of Cgst And ... vs Sutherland Global Services Private ... on 16 October, 2020
that "the material fact which negatives the theory of fees in the present case is that the money raised
by the levy of the contribution is not earmarked or specified for defraying the expense that the
Government has to incur in performing the services. All the collections go to the consolidated fund
of the State and all the expenses have to be met not out of those collections but out of the general
revenues by a proper method of appropriation as is done in the case of other Government expenses".
The learned judge no doubt added that the said circumstance was not conclusive and pointed out
that in fact there was a total absence of any http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA
No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private
Limited] co-relation between the expenses incurred by the Government and the amount raised by
contribution. That is why Section 76(1) was struck down as ultra vires.
11. The same point arose before this Court in respect of the Orissa Hindu Religious Endowments
Act, 1939, as amended by amending Act 11 of 1952 in Mahant Sri Jagannath Ramanuj Das v. The,
State of Orissa. Mukherjea, J., who again spoke for the Court, upheld the validity of Section 49
which imposed the liability to pay the specified contribution on every Mutt or temple having an
annual income exceeding Rs. 250 for services rendered by the State Government. The scheme of the
impugned Act was examined and it was noticed that the collections made under it are not merged in
the general public revenue and are not appropriated in the manner laid down for appropriation of
expenses for other public purposes. They go to constitute a fund which is contemplated by Section
50 of the Act, and this fund to which the Provincial Government contributes both by way of loan and
grant is specifically set apart for the rendering of services involved in carrying out the provisions of
the Act.
12. The same view was taken by this Court in regard to s. 58 of the Bombay Public Trust Act, 1950
(Act XXIX of 1950) which imposed a similar contribution for a similar purpose in Ratilal Panachand
Gandhi v. The State of http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst.
Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] Bombay. It
would thus be seen that the tests which have to be applied in determining the character of any
impugned levy have been laid down by this Court in these three decisions; and it is in the light of
these tests that we have to consider the merits of the rival contentions raised before us in the present
petition.
13. On behalf of the petitioners Mr. Amin has relied on three other decisions which may be briefly
considered In P.P.Kutti Keya v. The State of Madras, the Madras High Court was called upon to
consider, inter alia, the validity of Section 11 of the Madras Commercial Crops Markets Act 20 of
1933 and Rules 28(1) and 28(3) framed thereunder. Section 11(1) levied a fee on the sales of
commercial crops within the notified area and Section 12 provided that the amounts collected by the
Market Committee shall be constituted into a Market Fund which would be utilised for acquiring a
site for the market, constructing a building, maintaining the market and meeting the expenses of the
Market Committee. The argument that these provisions amounted to services rendered to the
notified area and thus made the levy a fee and not a tax was not accepted by the Court. Venkatarama
Aiyar, J., took the view that the funds raised from the merchants for a construction of a market in
substance amounted to an exaction of a tax. Whether or not the construction of a market amounted
to a service to the http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/112932804/ 51
Assistant Commissioner Of Cgst And ... vs Sutherland Global Services Private ... on 16 October, 2020
Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] notified
area it is unnecessary for us to consider. Besides, as we have already pointed out we have now three
decisions of this Court which have authoritatively dealt with this matter, and it is in the light of the
said decisions that the present question has to be considered."
51. Such distinctions were also studied and highlighted by a Division Bench judgment of this Court
to which one of us (Vineet Kothari,J) was a party in the case of Tamil Nadu Minerals Ltd. v.
Joint Commissioner of Income Tax [TCA No.1806 of 2008 dt.
22.04.2019, where the question involved was whether the 'nomination charges' paid by the
Government Company M/s. Tamil Nadu Minerals Limited to State under Section 8C(7) of the Minor
Mineral Concession Rules was only a "Royalty" and not "Tax, Duty, Cess or Fees" and therefore, the
delayed payment thereof did not attract Section 43B of the Income Tax Act, 1961, so as to disallow
the same as an expenditure under that Act, because Section 43B of the Income Tax Act disallowed
the delayed payment of only a "Tax, Duty, Cess or Fees" and not the "nomination charges" paid by
the Mineral Company to the State. In the said judgment, the distinction between these four types of
imposts and other related terms were discussed by http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt.
16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland
Global Services Private Limited] the Division Bench in the following manner:
"21.A little research into these imposts would be apposite here. These terms have the
connotations delineated by Apex Court and Authors in the following manner:
CESS 21.1.Means a duty in the nature of duty of excise and customs, imposed and
collected on motor spirit commonly known as petrol and high speed diesel oil for the
purposes of this Act, [Section 2(b), Central Road Fund Act, 2000 (India)].
21.2.Is also a tax, but is a special kind of tax.
Generally tax raises revenue which can be used generally for any purpose by the State, Vijayalashmi
Rice Mill v. CTO, (2006) 6 SCC 763.
21.3.The term cess is commonly employed to connote a tax with a purpose or a tax allocated to a
particular thing suggested by the name of the cess, such as health cess, education cess, road cess etc.
This is a well settled position of law. However, it also means an assessment or levy. Depending on
the context and purpose of levy, cess may not be a tax; it may be a fee or fee as well. It is not
necessary that the services rendered from out of the fee collected should be directly in proportion
with the amount of fee collected. It is equally not necessary that the services rendered by the fee
collected should remain confined to the persons from whom the fee has been collected. Availability
of indirect benefit and http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst.
Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] a general
nexus between the persons bearing the burden of levy of fee and the services rendered out of the fee
collected is enough to uphold the validity of the fee charged. As per Sinha, J. (dissenting),
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/112932804/ 52
Assistant Commissioner Of Cgst And ... vs Sutherland Global Services Private ... on 16 October, 2020
conceptually fee and tax stand on different footings; whereas the element of tax is based on the
principle of compulsory exaction, the concept of fee relates to the principle of quid pro quo. The
validity of tax cannot, therefore, be upheld on the ground that the same would be a fee, State of W.B.
v. Kesoram Industries Ltd., (2004) 10 SCC 21.4.The word "cess" is used in Ireland and is still in use
in India although the word rate has replaced it in England. It means a tax and is generally used
when the levy is for some special administrative expense which the name (health cess, education
cess, road cess etc.) indicates, Shinde Bros. v. Commr., AIR 1967 SC 1512: (1967) 1 SCR 548.
21.5.Means the goods and services tax compensation cess levied under Section 8 of Goods and
Services Tax (Compensation to States) Act, 2017, [Section 2(1)(c), Goods and Services Tax
(Compensation to States) Act, 2017 (India)].
22.TAX 22.1. "A tax" is a compulsory exaction of money by public authority for public purposes
enforceable by law and is not payment "for services rendered". This definition
http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of
CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] brings out the essential
characteristics of a tax as distinguished from other forms of imposition which, in a general sense,
are included within it. It is said that the essence of taxation is compulsion, that is to say, it is
imposed under statutory power without the tax payers consent and the payment is enforced by law.
The second characteristic of tax is that it is an imposition made for public purpose without reference
to any special benefit to be conferred on the payer of the tax. This is expressed by saying that the
levy of tax is for the purposes of general revenue, which when collected, forms part of the public
revenues of the State. As the object of the tax is not to confirm any special benefit upon any
particular individual there is, as it is said, no element of "quid pro quo" between the tax payer and
the public authority. (See Findlay Shirras on Science of Public Finance, Vol. 1). Another feature of
taxation is that as it is a part of the common burden, the quantum of imposition upon the tax payer
depends generally upon his capacity to pay, Commr., Hindu Religious Endowments v. Sri
Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur Mutt, AIR 1954 SC 282: 1954 SCR 1005: 20 Cut LT 250.
22.2. A tax is undoubtedly in the nature of a compulsory exaction of money by a public authority for
public purposes, the payment of which is enforced by law. But the other and equally important
characteristic of a tax is, that http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of
2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited]
the imposition is made for public purpose to meet the general expenses of the State without
reference to any special advantage to be conferred upon the payers of the tax, Ratilal Panachand
Gandhi v. State of Bombay, AIR 1954 SC 388:
1954 SCR 1055: 56 Bom LR 1184.
22.3.An impost; a tribute imposed on the subject; an excise; tallage. The general
principles of taxation are these: -
(1) The subjects of every estate ought to contribute to the support of the Government
as nearly as possible in proportion to their respective abilities; that is, in proportion
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/112932804/ 53
Assistant Commissioner Of Cgst And ... vs Sutherland Global Services Private ... on 16 October, 2020
to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the State. In the
observation or neglect of this maxim consists what is called the equality or inequality
of taxation. (2) The tax which each individual is bound to pay ought to be certain and
not arbitrary. The time of payment, the manner of payment, the quantity to be paid,
ought all to be clear and plain to the contributor and to every other person. (3) Every
tax ought to be levied at the time or in the manner, in which it is most likely to be
convenient for the contributor to pay it. (4) Every tax ought to be so contrived as both
to take out and keep out of the pockets of the people as little as possible over and
above what it brings into the public treasury of the State. Taxes are either direct or
indirect. A direct tax is one that is demanded from the very persons who are intended
or desired to pay it. Indirect taxes are those http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt.
16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v.
Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] which are demanded from one person, in
the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of
another, such as the excise or customs. [Wharton's Law Lexicon.]
23.Tax and Fee 23.1.The distinction between a tax and a fee lies primarily in the fact that a tax is
levied as a part of a common burden, while a fee is a payment for a special benefit or privilege. Fees
confer a special capacity, although the special advantage, as for example in the case of registration
fees for documents or marriage licences, is secondary to the primary motive of regulation in the
public interest, (vide Findlay Shirras on Science of Public Finance, Vol. I). Commr., Hindu Religious
Endowments v. Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur Mutt, AIR 1954 SC 282: 1954 SCR
1005: 20 Cut LT 250.
23.2. A fee is generally defined to be a charge for a special service rendered to individuals by some
governmental agency, State of Gujarat v. Akhil Gujarat Pravasi V.S. Mahamandal, (2004) 5 SCC 155.
23.3.Taxation includes every charge or burden imposed by the sovereign power upon persons,
property or property right, for the use and support of the Government and to enable it to discharge
its appropriate functions and in that broad definition there is included a proportionate levy upon
http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of
CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] persons or property and
various other methods or devices by which revenue is extracted from persons and property. The
term "tax" is to be read in all embracing and sweeping sense. Such methods or device used by the
Government from time to time are not ordinarily open to serious questions but their scope and
application vary according to the nature of the subject under discussion and the circumstances
under which they are used. (Para 47), State of U.P. v. Jaiprakash Associates Ltd., (2014) 4 SCC 720.
24.Taxation and impost - "Taxation" includes the imposition of any tax or impost, whether general
or local or special and "tax" shall be construed accordingly. Though it is not an exhaustive definition
and only shows what is included in the word one is struck immediately by its width of language.
Though it speaks of any tax or impost, it goes a step further and adds "whether general or local or
special", indicating thereby that no special or local considerations are relevant and even a general
non discriminatory levy must be regarded as taxation. The definition of taxation speaks of impost.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/112932804/ 54
Assistant Commissioner Of Cgst And ... vs Sutherland Global Services Private ... on 16 October, 2020
The word "impost" in its general sense means a tax or tribute or duty and may be on persons or on
goods. In a special sense it means a duty on imported goods and on merchandise, Sea Customs Act,
S. 20(2), In re, AIR 1963 SC 1760, 1784: (1964) 3 SCR 787: (1964) 1 ITJ 671
25.FEES http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst.
Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] 25.1.Is
generally defined to be a charge for a special service rendered to individuals by some governmental
agency. The amount of fee levied is supposed to be based on the expenses incurred by the
Government in rendering the service, though in many cases the costs are arbitrarily assessed.
Ordinarily, the fees are uniform and no account is taken of the varying abilities of different
recipients to pay. These are undoubtedly some of the general characteristics, but as there may be
various kinds of fees, it is not possible to formulate a definition that would be applicable to all cases,
Commr., Hindu Religious Endowments v. Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur Mutt, AIR
1954 SC 282: 1954 SCR 1005: (1954) 1 MLJ 596: 20 Cut LT 250.
25.2.Property peculiar; reward or recompense for services. Also an estate of inheritance divided into
three species: (1) fee-simple absolute; (2) qualified or base fee; (3) fee-tail, formerly fee
conditional.[Wharton's Law Lexicon.] 25.3.Fees are a sort of return or consideration for services
rendered, which makes it necessary that there should be an element of quid pro quo in the
imposition of a fee. There has to be a co-relationship between the fee levied by an authority and the
services rendered by it to the person who is required to pay the fee, Govt. of A.P. v. Hindustan
Machine Tools Ltd., (1975) 2 SCC 274.
25.4. Perquisites allowed to officers in the http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA
No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private
Limited] administration of justice, as a recompense for their labour and trouble, ascertained either
by Acts of Parliament, by rule or order of Court or by ancient usage.[Wharton's Law Lexicon.]
25.5.Means the charges specified by the food authority for clearance of imported food consignments,
[Regulation 2(j), Food Safety and Standards (Import) Regulations, 2017 (India)].
26.Levy and Fee 26.1.A levy in the nature of a fee does not cease to be of that character merely
because there is an element of compulsion or coerciveness present in it, nor is it a postulate of a fee
that it must have direct relation to the actual services rendered by the authority to each individual
who obtains the benefit of the service. If with a view to provide a specific service, levy is imposed by
law and expenses for maintaining the service are met out of the amounts collected there being a
reasonable relation between the levy and the expenses incurred for rendering the service, the levy
would be in the nature of a fee and not in the nature of a tax. It is true that ordinarily a fee is
uniform and no account is taken of the varying abilities of different recipients. But absence of
uniformity is not a criterion on which alone it can be said that it is of the nature of a tax. A fee being
a levy in consideration of rendering service of a particular type, correlation between
http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of
CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] the expenditure incurred by
the Government and the levy must undoubtedly exist, but a levy will not be regarded as a tax merely
because of the absence of uniformity in its incidence or because of compulsion in the collection
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/112932804/ 55
Assistant Commissioner Of Cgst And ... vs Sutherland Global Services Private ... on 16 October, 2020
thereof, nor because some of the contributories do not obtain the same degree of service as others
may, Sudhindra Thirtha Swamiar v. Commr., Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments, AIR
1963 SC 966, 975: 1963 Supp (2) SCR 26.2.In fees there is always an element of "quid pro quo"
which is absent in a tax. Two elements are thus essential in order that a payment may be regarded as
a fee. In the first place, it must be levied in consideration of certain services which the individuals
accepted either willingly or unwillingly. But this by itself is not enough to make the imposition of a
fee, if the payments demanded for rendering of such services are not set apart or specifically
appropriated for that purpose but are merged in the general revenue of the State to be spent for
general public purposes, Jagannath Ramanuj Das v. State of Orissa, AIR 1954 SC 400: 1954 SCR
1046.
27.Fee and Tax 27.1.Between a tax and a fee there is no generic difference. Both are compulsory
exactions of money by public authorities; but whereas a tax is imposed for public
http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of
CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] purposes and is not and need
not, be supported by any consideration of service rendered in return, a fee is levied essentially for
services rendered and as such there is an element of quid pro quo between the person who pays the
fee and the public authority which imposes it. If specific services are rendered to a specific area or to
a specific class of persons or trade or business in any local area and as a condition precedent for the
said services or in return for them cess is levied against the said area or the said class of persons or
trade or business the cess is distinguishable from a tax and is described as a fee. Tax recovered by
public authority invariably goes into the consolidated fund which ultimately is utilised for all public
purposes, whereas a cess levied by way of fee is not intended to be and does not become, a part of
the consolidated fund. It is earmarked and set apart for the purpose of services for which it is levied.
There is, however, an element of compulsion in the imposition of both tax and fee, Hingir Rampur
Coal Co. Ltd. v. State of Orissa, AIR 1961 SC 459, 464: (1961) 2 SCR 537.
27.2.Conceptually fee and tax stand on different footings; whereas the element of tax is based on the
principle of compulsory exaction, the concept of fee relates to the principle of quid pro quo. The
validity of tax cannot, therefore, be upheld on the ground that the same would be a fee, State of W.B.

28.LEVY 28.1.Means to realise or to collect. Only necessary condition is that the proceedings for
realisation of the fine must be commenced within the stipulated period, Mehtab Singh v. State of
U.P., (1979) 4 SCC 597: 1980 SCC (Cri) 28.2.Includes proceedings for assessment, Ashok Singh v.

28.3.Levy includes not only the imposition of the charge but also the whole process up to raising of
the demand, Mafatlal Industries Ltd. v. Union of India, (1997) 5 SCC 536.
28.4.The term "levy" is wider in its import than the term "assessment". It may include both
"imposition" as well as "assessment", CCE v. Smithkline Beecham Consumer Health Care Ltd.,

28.5.The act of raising money or men. [Wharton?s Law Lexicon.] 28.6.The term "levy" it is held, is
an expression of wide import. It includes both imposition of a tax as well as its quantification and
assessment, Ujagar Prints (2) v. Union of India, (1989) 3 SCC 488.
29.Levy and collect - In taxing statute the words "levy" and "collect" are not synonymous terms,
while "levy"
http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of
CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] would mean the assessment
or charging or imposing tax, "collect" would mean the physical realisation of the tax which is levied
or imposed. Collection of tax is normally a stage subsequent to the levy of the same. The
enforcement of levy could only mean realisation of the tax imposed or demanded, Somaiya Organics
(India) Ltd. v. State of U.P., (2001) 5 SCC
30.Levy and collection - While the expression "levy" may include both the process of taxation as well
as the determination of the amount of tax or duty, the expression "collection" refers to actual
collection of the payable duty or the tax, as the case may be. Since the taxable event for attracting
excise duty or countervailing duty is the manufacture or import of excisable goods into the State, the
charge of incidence of duty stands attracted as soon as the taxable event takes place and the facility
of postponement of collection of duty under the Act or the rules framed thereunder, can in no way
affect the incidence of duty on the imported goods, S.K. Pattanaik v. State of Orissa, (2000) 1 SCC
413.
31.Levy, Imposition and Assessment The term "levy" appears to be wider in its import than the term
"assessment". It may include both "imposition" of a tax as well as assessment. The term
"imposition" is generally used for the levy of a tax or duty by legislative provisions
http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of
CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] indicating the subject matter
of the tax and the rates at which it has to be taxed. The term "assessment", on the other hand, is
generally used in this country for the actual procedure adopted in fixing the liability to pay a tax on
account of particular goods or property or whatever may be the object of the tax in a particular case
and determining its amount, Asstt. Collector of Central Excise, CCE v. National Tobacco Co. of India

32.DUTY 32.1.Means a duty of customs leviable under the Act, [Section 2(15), Customs Act, 1962
(India)].
32.2.A tax, an impost or imposition; also an obligation. [Wharton's Law Lexicon.] 32.3.Duty, direct
taxes and indirect taxes - The word "duty" means an indirect tax imposed on the importation or
consumption of goods. "Customs" are duties charged upon commodities on their being imported
into or exported from a country. The expression direct taxes includes those assessed upon the
property, person, business, income, etc., of those who are to pay them, while indirect taxes are levied

and payable proportionately to the use made of the right by the grantee, State of Orissa v. Titaghur
Paper Mills Co. Ltd., 1985 Supp SCC 280.
33.2."Royalty" according to Jowitts' Dictionary of English Law means "a payment reserved by the
grantor of a patent, lease of a mine or similar right and payable proportionately to the use made of
the right by the grantee", Distt. Council, Jowai Autonomous Distt. v. Dwet Singh Rymbai, (1986) 4
SCC 38.
33.3.Royalty in general connotes the State's share in the goods upon which the rights of its
exploitation are conferred upon any person or the group of persons. If the royalty cannot be claimed
by any individual, much less the controversial items being its attribute, even if assumed, can be
claimed by a citizen, State of H.P. v. Raja Mahendra Pal, (1999) 4 SCC 43.
33.4.In the transaction of patent, royalty is a payment to a patentee by agreement on every article
made according to his patent or to an author by publisher on every copy of his book sold or to the
owner of mineral for the right of working the same on every tone or other weight raised, Pradeep C.
Mody v. Sashikant C. Mody, AIR 1998 Bom 351.

agreement on every article made according to his patent; or to an author by a publisher on every
copy of his book sold; or to the owner of minerals for the right of working the same on every ton or
other weight raised. [Wharton's Law Lexicon.] 33.6.In its primary and natural sense "royalty", in the
legal world, is known as the equivalent or translation of jura regalia or jura regia. Royal rights and
prerogatives of a sovereign are covered thereunder. In its secondary sense the word "royalty" would
signify, as in mining leases, that part of the reddendum, variable though, payable in cash or kind, for
rights and privileges obtained, Inderjeet Singh Sial v. Karam Chand Thapar, (1995) 6 SCC 166.
34.Royalty and compensation "Royalty" means remuneration paid to an author in respect of the
exploitation of a work, usually referring to payment on a continuing basis (e.g. 10% of the sale price)
rather than a payment consisting of a lump sum in consideration of acquisition of rights. It may also
be applied to payment to performers. In the context of the Act, royalty is a genus and compensation
is a species. Where a licence has to be granted, it has to be for a period. A "compensation" may be
paid by way of annuity. A "compensation" may be payable on a periodical basis, as apart from
compensation, other terms and conditions can also be imposed. The http://www.judis.nic.in

52. The learned counsel for the Revenue relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in
the case of Union of India v. Uttam Steel Limited [(2015 (13) SCC 209] on the issue of the claim of
the Assessee having become dead claim prior to the introduction of GST Regime on 01.07.2017 and
similarly, the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the aforesaid case held that the claim had already became
dead, the extended period of limitation by way of amendment to Section 11B of the Act would not
revive such a claim. Hon’ble Mr.Justice R.F.Nariman speaking on behalf of the Bench, said in
paragraph 10 that there is no doubt whatsoever that the period of limitation being procedural or
adjectival law would ordinarily be retrospective in nature, but with one caveat that the claim made
under the amended provision should not itself have been a dead claim in the sense that it was
already time barred before the amended Act with the larger period of limitation comes into force.
The Hon’ble Supreme Court relied upon the earlier decision in this regard in the case of S.S. Gadgil
v. Lal and http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst.
Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] Co. [AIR
1965 SC 171] in the following manner.
"10. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and Shri Bagaria, the learned
Amicus Curiae at some length. There is no doubt whatsoever that a period of
limitation being procedural or adjectival law would ordinarily be retrospective in
nature. This, however, is with one proviso super added which is that the claim made
under the amended provision should not itself have been a dead claim in the sense
that it was time barred before an Amending Act with a larger period of limitation
comes into force. A number of judgments of this Court have recognised the aforesaid
proposition. Thus, in S.S. Gadgil v. Lal and Co., MANU/SC/0122/1964 : AIR 1965
S.C. 171, this Court stated:-
"13. As we have already pointed out, the right to commence a proceeding for
assessment against the assessee as an agent of a non-resident party under the Income
Tax Act before it was amended, ended on March 31, 1956. It is true that under the
amending Act by Section 18 of the Finance Act, 1956, authority was conferred upon
the Income Tax Officer to assess a person as an agent of a foreign party under Section
43 within two years from the end of the year of assessment. But authority of the
Income Tax Officer under the Act before it was amended by the Finance
http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst.
Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private
Limited] Act of 1956 having already come to an end, the amending provision will not
assist him to commence a proceeding even though at the date when he issued the
notice it is within the period provided by that amending Act. This will be so,
notwithstanding the fact that there has been no determinable point of time between
the expiry of the time provided under the old Act and the commencement of the
amending Act. The legislature has given to Section 18 of the Finance Act, 1956, only a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/112932804/ 59
Assistant Commissioner Of Cgst And ... vs Sutherland Global Services Private ... on 16 October, 2020
limited retrospective operation i.e. up to April 1, 1956, only. That provision must be
read subject to the rule that in the absence of an express provision or clear
implication, the legislature does not intend to attribute to the amending provision a
greater retrospectivity than is expressly mentioned, nor to authorise the Income Tax
Officer to commence proceedings which before the new Act came into force had by
the expiry of the period provided, become barred."
53. The same Bench of Hon’ble Supreme Court in a later case of Jayam and Co. v. Assistant
Commissioner and Others [(2016) 15 SCC 125] in a case under Tamil Nadu Value Added Tax Act,
2006, held that it is trite law that whenever concession is given by a statute http://www.judis.nic.in
Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v.
Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] or notification etc., the conditions thereof are to be
strictly complied with in order to avail such concession. Thus, it is not the right of the dealers to get
benefit of input tax credit, but it is a concession granted by virtue of Section 19 and therefore, the
conditions for availing such Input Tax Credit have to be fulfilled. Paragraphs 11 to 13 of the said
judgment authored by the Hon’ble Mr.Justice A.K.Sikri, are quoted below for ready reference.
"11. From Sub-section (10) onwards, provisions are made to follow the procedure and
fulfill the requisite conditions for availing ITC. For the purposes of this particular
issue, Sub-section (10) is the material provision. This provision, which is couched in
negative terms, categorically stipulates that such ITC would be admissible to the
registered dealer and he would not be entitled to claim this credit 'until the dealer
receives an original tax invoice duly filled, signed and issued by a registered dealer
from where the goods are purchased .....'. Further, such original tax invoice should
evidence the amount of input tax. So much so, even if the original tax invoice is lost,
the obligation cast on the registered dealer is to obtain duplicate or carbon copy of
such tax invoice from the selling dealer and only then input tax is allowed.
From the aforesaid scheme of Section 19, following http://www.judis.nic.in
Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST &
Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] significant aspects
emerge:
(a) ITC is a form of concession provided by the Legislature. It is not admissible to all
kinds of sales and certain specified sales are specifically excluded.
(b) Concession of ITC is available on certain conditions mentioned in this Section.
(c) One of the most important condition is that in order to enable the dealer to claim
ITC it has to produce original tax invoice, completed in all respect, evidencing the
amounts of input tax.
12. It is a trite law that whenever concession is given by statute or notification etc. the conditions
thereof are to be strictly complied with in order to avail such concession. Thus, it is not the right of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/112932804/ 60
Assistant Commissioner Of Cgst And ... vs Sutherland Global Services Private ... on 16 October, 2020
the 'dealers' to get the benefit of ITC but its a concession granted by virtue of Section 19. As a
fortiori, conditions specified in Section 10 must be fulfilled. In that he, we find that Section 10 makes
original tax invoice relevant for the purpose of claiming tax. Therefore, under the scheme of the VAT
Act, it is not permissible for the dealers to argue that the price as indicated in the tax invoice should
not have been taken into consideration but the net purchase price after discount is to be the basis. If
we were dealing with any other aspect de hors the issue of ITC as per the Section19 of the VAT Act,
possibly the arguments of Mr.Bagaria would have assumed some relevance. But, keeping in view the
scope http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner
of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] of the issue, such a plea is
not admissible having regard to the plain language of Sections of the VAT Act, read along with other
provisions of the said Act as referred to above.
13. For the same reasons given above, challenge to constitutional validity of Sub-section (20) of
Section 19 of VAT Act has to fail. When a concession is given by a statute, the Legislature has power
to make the provision stating the form and manner in which such concession is to be allowed.
Sub-section (20) seeks to achieve that. There was no right, inherent or otherwise, vested with
dealers to claim the benefit of ITC but for Section 19 of the VAT Act. That apart, we find that there
were valid and cogent reasons for inserting Section 19(20). Main purport was to protect the Revenue
against clandestine transactions resulting in evasion of tax. ..."
54. We are supported in our aforesaid view by the aforesaid two judgments also largely because it is
clear that CENVAT credit or Input Tax Credit under the GST Regime is a concession and a facility
and not a vested right. Even if one were to rank such a right of CENVAT credit on the pedestal of a
statutory right, even that right can be curtailed and regulated by conditions for availing such right. It
is clear from the Scheme of Section 140 of the GST Act that the transition and carry
http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of
CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] forward of the Input Tax
Credit of the taxes and duties paid under the earlier Indirect Tax Regimes was subject to conditions
and specifications given in Section 140 of the Act and unless specifically allowed. Such carry forward
or set off could not be claimed by any implied intention or so called vested right theory. In our
opinion, the unutilised Education Cess and Secondary and Higher Education Cess in the hands of
the Assessee had become dead CENVAT Credit claim in the year 2015 itself with these levies
dropped by the Finance Act 2015 and therefore, there is no question of it being claimed as a right to
be carried forward and set off after 01.07.2017 against Output GST Liability.
55. We may also deal with the judgment of Division Bench of Delhi High Court relied upon by the
Revenue in the case of Cellular Operators Association of India v. Union of India [(2018) 14 GSTR
338] decided on 15.07.2018 and also referred by the learned counsel for the Assessee in support of
the submission that cross utilization of Education Cess and Secondary and Higher Education Cess
towards Excise Duty and Service Tax was never permitted and the Delhi High Court repelled the
challenge of the Cellular Operators http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53
of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private
Limited] Association of India to the Notification dated 29th October 2015, which was challenged on
the ground that the extended benefit of that Notification was not given to the Cellular Operators and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/112932804/ 61
Assistant Commissioner Of Cgst And ... vs Sutherland Global Services Private ... on 16 October, 2020
the credit accumulated on account of Education Cess and Secondary and Higher Education Cess
should be allowed to them against the payment of Service Tax leviable and payable on digital
Communication Services.
56. Distinguishing the decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Eicher Motors Limited, as
we have also found above, the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court in a judgment authored by
Hon’ble Justice Sanjiv Khanna (As His Lordship then was), it was held that on a holistic reading of
the entire Scheme, the petitioners could not be allowed to take cross utilization against Excise Duty
and the contention that it was a vested right or claim of the Assessee could not be accepted. The
Court also found that the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Eicher Motors, was
distinguished by Hon’ble Supreme Court itself later on in the case of Osram Surya (P) Ltd. v.
Commissioner of Central Excise [(2002) 142 ELT 5 (SC)].
"16. The decision in the case of Eicher Motors Limited and Another (supra) is
distinguishable, for in the http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA
No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global
Services Private Limited] said case, what was subject matter of challenge was Rule
57- F(4-A), which had stipulated that unutilized credit as on 16th March, 1995 lying
with the manufacturers of tractors under Heading 87.01 or motor vehicles 87.02 and
87.04 or chassis of tractors or motor vehicles under Heading 87.06 shall lapse and
shall not be allowed to be utilized for payment of duty on excisable goods. The
proviso, however, had stipulated that nothing shall apply to the credit of duty, if any,
in respect of inputs lying in stock or contained in finished products lying in stock as
on 16th March, 1995, thereby creating an anomalous situation. Credit of tax paid on
inputs and even finished products was available, but not in respect of the sold
products. This was clearly taking away a vested right in the form of an amendment to
the Rule. There was lapse of credit, which could not be utilized, though the tax/duty
had not been withdrawn. The Supreme Court noticed that the credit attributable to
inputs had already been used in manufacture of final products that had been cleared,
and this alone was sought to be lapsed, notwithstanding the fact that the right had
become absolute. On a holistic reading of the entire scheme, it was observed that
when acts have been done by the parties concerned on the strength of the Rules,
incidence following thereto must take place in accordance with the scheme or the
Rules, otherwise it would affect the rights of the assessees. Further, right had accrued
on the date when http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of
2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services
Private Limited] the assessee had paid tax on the raw materials or inputs and the
same would continue till the facility available thereto got worked out or until the
goods existed. As noticed above, tax/duty had not been withdrawn. Lastly and more
importantly, Section 37 of the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985 did not enable the
authorities to make the Rule impugned therein. The legal ratio in Eicher Motors
Limited and Another (supra) was followed in Samtel India Limited (supra) wherein
amended Rule 57-F(17) of the Central Excise Rules, 1944 was challenged. The Rules
had postulated lapsing of credit in case of manufactured goods falling under
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/112932804/ 62
Assistant Commissioner Of Cgst And ... vs Sutherland Global Services Private ... on 16 October, 2020
sub-heading 8540.12, though the proviso had provided for credit of duty in respect of
inputs lying in stock or contained in finished goods lying in stocks. It was held that
the said scheme of credit of input tax, in view of amended provision, could not be
made applicable to goods which had already come into existence and under which the
assessee had claimed credit facility. As noticed above, in the present case, credit of EC
and SHE could be only allowed against EC and SHE and could not be cross- utilized
against the excise duty or service tax. In fact, what the petitioners seek is an
amendment of the scheme to allow them to take cross utilization of the unutilized EC
and SHE upon the two cesses being withdrawn against excise duty and service tax,
though this was not the position even earlier. Both EC and SHE were withdrawn and
abolished.
http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of
CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] They ceased to be payable. In
these circumstances, it is not possible to accept the contention that a vested right or claim existed
and legal issue is covered against the respondents by the decision in Eicher Motors Limited and
Another (supra) and Samtel India Limited (supra). The said decisions are distinguishable and
inapplicable.
17. The decision in Eicher Motors Limited and Another (supra) was distinguished in the case of
Osram Surya (P) Ltd. Versus Commissioner of Central Excise, Indore, 2002 (142) ELT 5 (SC),
wherein proviso to Rule 57 introducing six months time limit for claiming MODVAT credit benefit
was challenged. Arguments predicated on vested right being annulled and reduced to nothing were
rejected, recording as under -
"7. Having heard the arguments of the parties and after considering the Rule in
question, we think that by introducing the limitation in the said proviso to the Rule,
the statute has not taken away any of the vested rights which had accrued to the
manufacturers under the Scheme of MODVAT. That vested right continues to be in
existence and what is restricted is the time within which the manufacturer has to
enforce that right. The appellants, however, contended that imposition of a limitation
is as good as taking away the vested right. In support of their argument, they
http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst.
Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private
Limited] have placed reliance on a judgment of this Court in Eicher Motors Ltd. v.
Union of India (1999) 2 SCC 361 wherein this Court had held that a right accrued to
an assessee on the date when it paid the tax on the raw materials or the inputs would
continue until the facility available thereto gets worked out or until those goods
existed. In that background, this Court held that by Section 37 of the Act, the
authorities concerned cannot make a rule which could take away the said right on
goods manufactured prior to the date specified in the rule concerned. In the facts of
Eicher case (1999) 2 SCC 361 it is seen that by introduction of Rule 57-F(4-A) to the
Rules, a credit which was lying unutilized on 16-3- 1995 with the manufacturer was
held to have lapsed. Therefore, that was a case wherein by introduction of the Rule a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/112932804/ 63
Assistant Commissioner Of Cgst And ... vs Sutherland Global Services Private ... on 16 October, 2020
credit which was in the account of the manufacturer was held not to be available on
the coming into force of that Rule, by that the right to credit itself was taken away,
whereas in the instant case by the introduction of the second proviso to Rule 57-G,
the credit in the account of a manufacturer was not taken away but only the manner
and the time within which the said credit was to be taken or utilized alone was
stipulated. It is to be noted at this juncture that the substantive right has
http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst.
Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private
Limited] not been taken away by the introduction of the proviso to the Rule in
question but a procedural restriction was introduced which, in our opinion, is
permissible in law. Therefore, in our opinion, the law laid down by this Court in
Eicher case (1999) 2 SCC 361 does not apply to the facts of these cases. This is also
the position with regard to the judgment of this Court in CCE v. Dai Ichi Karkaria
Ltd.(1999) 7 SCC 448."
57. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Osram Surya held that Second Proviso inserted in the
Central Excise Rules Rule 57G with effect from 29.06.1995 does not affect the substantive or vested
right of the manufacturer to take credit, but only introduces a procedural restriction which is legally
permissible by providing a time limit of six months. Paragraphs 7 and 8 of the said judgment are
also quoted below for ready reference.
"7. Having heard the arguments of the parties and after considering the Rule in
question, we think that by introducing the limitation in the said proviso to the Rule,
the statute has not taken away any of the vested rights which had accrued to the
manufacturers under the Scheme of Modvat. That vested right continues to be in
existence and what is restricted is the time within which the manufacturer
http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst.
Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private
Limited] has to enforce that right. The appellants, however, contended that
imposition of a limitation is as good as taking away the vested right. In support of
their argument, they have placed reliance on a judgment of this Court in Eicher
Motors Ltd. v. Union of India [1999 (106) ELT 3 SC) wherein this Court had held that
a right accrued to an assessee on the date when it paid the tax on the raw-materials or
the inputs would continue until the facility available thereto gets worked out or until
those goods existed. In that background, this Court held that by Section 37 of the Act,
the authorities concerned cannot make a Rule which could take away the said right
on goods manufactured prior to the date specified in the concerned Rule. In the facts
of Eicher's case (supra), it is seen that by introduction of Rule 57F(4A) to the Rules, a
credit which was lying unutilized on 16.3.1995 with the manufacturer was held to
have lapsed. Therefore, that was a case wherein by introduction of the Rule a credit
which was in the account of the manufacturer was held not to be available on the
coming into force of that Rule, by that the right to credit itself was taken away,
whereas in the instant case by the introduction of the second proviso to Rule 57G, the
credit in the account of a manufacturer was not taken away but only the manner and

Assistant Commissioner Of Cgst And ... vs Sutherland Global Services Private ... on 16 October, 2020
the time within which the said credit was to be taken or utilized alone was stipulated.
It is to be noted at this juncture that the substantive right has not
http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst.
Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private
Limited] been taken away by the introduction of the proviso to the Rule in question
but a procedural restriction was introduced which, in our opinion, is permissible in
law. Therefore, in our opinion, the law laid down by this Court in Eicher's case
(supra) does not apply to the facts of these cases. This is also the position with regard
to the judgment of this Court in Collector of Central Excise, Pune & Ors. V. Dai Ichi
Karkaria Ltd. & Ors. [1997 (7) SCC 448].
8. It is vehemently argued on behalf of the appellants that in effect by introduction of
this Rule, a manufacturer in whose account certain credit existed, would be denied of
the right to take such credit consequently, as in the case of Eicher (supra), a
manufacturer's vested right is taken away, therefore, the Rule in question should be
interpreted in such a manner that it did not apply to cases where credit in question
had accrued prior to the date of introduction of this proviso.
In our opinion, this argument is not available to the appellants because none has questioned the
legality or the validity of the Rule in question, therefore, any argument which in effect questions the
validity of the Rule, cannot be permitted to be raised. The argument of the appellants that there was
no time whatsoever given to some of the manufacturers to avail the credit after the introduction of
the Rule also is based on arbitrariness of the Rule, and the same http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment
dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland
Global Services Private Limited] also will have to be rejected on the ground that there is no
challenge to the validity of the Rule."
Likewise before us also, there is no challenge to any provision of CGST Act or Rules made
thereunder.
58. We may also briefly add one more reason as to why we cannot subscribe to the view taken by the
learned Single Judge and affirm it. GST Law, by enactment of respective laws by the Parliament and
States and creation of GST Council to subsume the 16 indirect taxes which were in vogue prior to
01.07.2017 was a watershed moment in the taxation reforms in India. The following 16 indirect taxes
which were hitherto leviable were subsumed in the new GST Law Regime and Constitutional
Amendments were effected for that purpose besides enactment of separate laws by Parliament and
States to impose GST on the sales of goods and services like Central Goods and Services Tax Act,
2017, the Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017, the Union Territory Goods and Services Tax
Act, 2017, the Goods and Services (Compensation to States) Act, 2017, etc. by Parliament and
respective State Goods and Services Tax Act by different States and Union Territories.

CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] (1) Central Excise Duty (2)
Additional Excise Duties (3) Excise Duty levied under the Medicinal and Toilet Preparations (Excise

Duties) Act, 1955 (4) Service Tax (5) Additional Customs Duty commonly known as Countervailing
Duty (6) Special Additional Duty of Customs (7) Central Surcharges and Cess, so far as they relate to
the supply of goods and services.
(8) State Value Added Tax/Sales Tax
(9) Entertainment Tax (other than the tax levied by the local bodies)
(10) Central Sales Tax (levied by the Centre and collected by the States) (11) Octroi and Entry Tax
(12) Purchase Tax (13) Luxury Tax (14) Taxes on lottery (15) Betting and gambling (16) State cess
and surcharges insofar as they relate to supply of goods and services.
59. The GST Law spared and did not include within its ambit and scope only six commodities which
were left out and continued to be covered by the earlier existing laws of Excise Duty and VAT Law
and http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of
CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited] for that purpose, Entry 54 of
the State List and Entry 84 of the Union List were also suitably amended by 101st Constitutional
Amendment Act. Six items which are not covered by GST are (a) Petroleum Crude,
(b) High Speed Diesel, (c) Motor Spirit (commonly known as Petrol),
(d) Natural Gas, (e) Aviation Turbine Fuel and (f) Tobacco and Tobacco products. Except the
aforesaid 16 taxes and duties specified in different enactments, no other tax or duty were subsumed
under the new GST Regime with effect from 01.07.2017.
60. Obviously, the transition of unutilised Input Tax Credit could be allowed only in respect of taxes
and duties which were subsumed in the new GST Law. Admittedly, the three types of Cess involved
before us, namely Education Cess, Secondary and Higher Education Cess and Krishi Kalyan Cess
were not subsumed in the new GST Laws, either by the Parliament or by the States. Therefore, the
question of transitioning them into the GST Regime and giving them credit under against Output
GST Liability cannot arise. The plain scheme and object of GST Law cannot be defeated or
interjected by allowing such Input Credits in respect of Cess, whether collected as Tax or Duty under
the then existing laws and therefore, such set off cannot be allowed.
http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of
CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited]
61. For these reasons also, in our opinion, the learned Single Judge, with great respects, erred in
allowing the claim of the Assessee under Section 140 of the CGST Act. The main pitfalls in the
reasoning given by the learned Single Judge are (a) the character of levy in the form of Cess like
Education Cess, Secondary and Higher Education Cess and Krishi Kalyan Cess was distinct and
stand alone levies and their input credit even under the Cenvat Rules which were applicable mutatis
mutandis did not permit any such cross Input Tax Credit, much less conferred a vested right,
especially after the levy of these Cesses itself was dropped; (b) Explanation 3 to Section 140 could
not be applied in a restricted manner only to the specified Sub-sections of Section 140 of the Act
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/112932804/ 66
Assistant Commissioner Of Cgst And ... vs Sutherland Global Services Private ... on 16 October, 2020
mentioned in the Explanations 1 and 2 and as a tool of interpretation, Explanation 3 would apply to
the entire Section 140 of the Act and since it excluded the Cess of any kind for the purpose of Section
140 of the Act, which is not specified therein, the transition, carry forward or adjustment of
unutilised Cess of any kind other than specified Cess, viz. National Calamity Contingent Duty
(NCCD), against Output GST liability could not arise.
http://www.judis.nic.in Judgment dt. 16.10.2020 in WA No.53 of 2020 [Asst. Commissioner of
CGST & Central Excise v. Sutherland Global Services Private Limited]
62. For the aforesaid reasons, we are inclined to allow the appeal of the Revenue and with all due
respect for the learned Single Judge, set aside the judgment of the learned Single Judge dated
05.09.2019 and we hold that the Assessee was not entitled to carry forward and set off of unutilised
Education Cess, Secondary and Higher Education Cess and Krishi Kalyan Cess against the GST
Output Liability with reference to Section 140 of the CGST Act, 2017. The appeal of the Revenue is
allowed. CMP No.690 of 2020 is closed. Costs easy.
63. We place on record our appreciation for the able assistance and well drafted written arguments
of the learned counsel on both sides.
