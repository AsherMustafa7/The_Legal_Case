Sanjeevkumar S/O Late Pandurang vs The State Of Karnataka And Ors on 23 June, 2022
This Writ Petition is filed under Articles 226 and
227 of the Constitution of India praying to issue a writ of
certiorari and to quash the endorsement dated
17.05.2022 issued by the third respondent in
No.C£Á¸À/£Áå¨ÉCA/¹Dgï-12/2022-23 produced at Annexure-F
and issue a writ in the nature of mandamus directing the
third respondent to transfer Fair Price Shop bearing
No.97 with authorization bearing No.50/93-94 standing
in the name of late father of the petitioner in favour of
the petitioner on compassionate grounds.
This petition coming on for Preliminary Hearing this
day, the Court made the following:
ORDER
The petitioner has preferred the instant writ petition with a prayer to quash the endorsement dated
17.05.2022 issued by respondent No.3 vide Annexure-F and has also sought for writ of mandamus
directing respondent No.3 to transfer the Fair Price Shop bearing No.97 with authorization bearing
No.50/93-94 standing in his father's name late Sri Pandurang in his favour on compassionate
ground.
2. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the learned Additional Government
Advocate appearing for respondents.
3. Brief facts of the case as revealed from the records for the purpose of disposal of this writ petition
are the petitioner's father late Sri Pandurang was issued with an authorization for distribution of
food grains in a Fair Price Shop in Warawatti (K) Village, Humnabad Taluk. The said authorization
which was issued to the petitioner's father was being renewed from time to time and during the
subsistence of the said authorization, the petitioner's father died on 12.11.2020.
4. Immediately, thereafterwards the petitioner had filed an application on 27.04.2021 with a prayer
to transfer the said authorization No.50/93-94 which stood in his father's name in his favour on
compassionate ground. On receipt of the said application, the third respondent had called for
reports from the Competent Authorities and thereafterwards has issued the impugned endorsement
rejecting the prayer of the petitioner for transfer of authorization on compassionate ground on the
ground that petitioner had crossed the age limit. Being aggrieved by the same the petitioner is
before this Court.
5. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that in identical circumstances this Court has quashed
the similar impugned endorsement and has directed the Competent Authority to consider the
matter afresh and he has placed reliance on the orders passed by the Coordinate Bench of this Court
in Writ Petition No.226956/2020 disposed of on 23.12.2020 and in Writ Petition No.200404/2021

Sanjeevkumar S/O Late Pandurang vs The State Of Karnataka And Ors on 23 June, 2022
disposed of on 17.03.2021. He submits that this Court has observed that a sympathetic view is
required to be taken as the transfer is sought on compassionate ground.
6. Per contra, learned Additional Government Advocate appearing for respondents submits that the
Karnataka Essential Commodities Licensing Order has been periodically amended and the criteria
for transfer of authorization/licence on compassionate ground has now been changed in view of the
subsequent amendments. He submits that the amended provision provides for transfer for a limited
period and considering the amendments to the Control Order, this Court in Writ Petition
No.13559/2020 and connected matters disposed of on 23.12.2021, has held that the State
Government has power to impose conditions while considering the applications for grant of
authorization as well as for transfer of the authorization on compassionate ground. He submits that
the earlier writ petitions were disposed of without taking into consideration the restriction on the
age and the education qualification. He also submits that in the writ petitions which were disposed
of earlier, the restriction with regard to the period of transfer was also not taken into consideration
and therefore he submits that this writ petition cannot be disposed of in terms of the orders passed
in the writ petitions which have been referred to by the learned counsel for the petitioner.
7. I have given my anxious consideration to the arguments addressed by the learned counsel for the
parties and also perused the material available on record.
8. Clause 13 of the Karnataka Essential Commodities Public Distribution System (Control) Order,
2021 provides for transfer of the authorization on compassionate ground. In the amended Control
Order 2021, the restrictions for transfer has also been modified and as per the amended provision
the applicant is required to make an application within ninety days from the death of authorised
dealer and the transfer if made in favour of the applicant it is only for a maximum period of ten
years and no further renewal is allowed for such transfer, after the completion of the maximum
period.
9. Though the Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in Writ Petition No.13559/2020 has held that the
State has got power and prerogative to impose conditions while considering the applications for
grant of authorization as well as for transfer of the authorization on compassionate ground,
considering the fact that this Court in several writ petitions had directed the State Government to
relax the restriction of age and education qualification held that though the prerogative of the State
to impose conditions to consider the applications on compassionate ground is required to be upheld,
this Court is of the opinion that it is desirable for the State Government to consider the case of the
petitioner, without reference to the restriction of age and education qualification, which shall be in
parity with the various orders passed by this Court in several writ petitions. Under the
circumstances, even this writ petition is required to be disposed of in terms of the order passed in
Writ Petition No.13559/2020 dated 23.12.2021. Accordingly, the following :
ORDER The writ petition is allowed.
The impugned endorsement dated 17.05.2022 issued by the third respondent is
hereby quashed.
