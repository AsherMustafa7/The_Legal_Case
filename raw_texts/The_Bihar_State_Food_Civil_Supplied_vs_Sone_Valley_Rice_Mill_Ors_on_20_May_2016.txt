12. The miller also agreed to abide by the instruction issued from time to time by the Bihar State
Food & Civil Supplies Corporation/relating to miller of procured paddy."
4. In terms of Clause 12 of the agreement, the stand of the appellant is that vide communication
dated 07th December, 2011 issued by the Food and Consumer Protection Department, Government
of Bihar, all the Commissioners and the District Collectors were informed that the procurement of
paddy is expected to be 30 lakhs Metric Ton on the minimum support price, therefore, it should be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158630749/ 3
The Bihar State Food & Civil Supplied ... vs Sone Valley Rice Mill & Ors on 20 May, 2016
ensured that paddy is purchased from the farmers and not from the middlemen and agents. It is also
communicated that for the purpose of purchase of paddy, the State Food Corporation (for short,
„SFC(cid:129)), the appellant, has been appointed as nodal agency and that the Primary Agricultural Credit
Societies is to primarily purchase the paddy from the farmers. The Circular also deals with the
milling process. One of the conditions was that the officers of the appellant would remain available
to supervise the proper milling process at each Rice Mill and they will ensure that maximum milling
capacity is being used and the excess paddy more than the storage capacity is not being sent. It
would be the responsibility of the officers that rice should be sent to godown of the Food
Corporation of India (for short, „FCI(cid:129)) after custom milling.
5. On the basis of the said Circular, it is argued by the Patna High Court LPA No.1576 of 2014 dt.
20-05-2016 appellant that the appellant is only an agency of the State Government to facilitate the
purchase of paddy, its milling by the Millers and then delivery of rice to the FCI. As per the
appellant, the Miller failed to deliver 68% par boiled rice and 67% raw rice to the FCI after milling of
the paddy, therefore, the appellant initiated recovery proceedings under Bihar and Orissa Public
Demands Recovery Act, 1914 (for short, hereinafter referred to as „the Act(cid:129)). A demand notice of
Rs.4,66,68,330/- was served upon the Miller.
6. The Miller has pleaded that initially, there was a policy of the Government that it would purchase
60% of the rice prepared by the Rice Miller on the fixed rate by the Government which was known
as „levy collection(cid:129), but the Government changed the policy and now it has decided to purchase the
paddy itself and will engage the Rice Mill for milling of the paddy on fixed rate. The relevant
averments made in paragraphs 6 and 8 of the writ application read as under:
6. That while all the formalities was processed, the Government have changed its
policy and decided to purchase the paddy itself and also formulated a policy that it
will engage the rice mill for milling of the paddy on fixed rate. For that purpose the
Government had formulated a scheme and to implement the same had also entered
into agreement with the petitioner. However, even that agreement was subsequently
changed with the consent of the parties.
8. That it is also significant to mention here that to purchase the paddy, the State
Government had opened many centers for purchase of paddy and also engaged to the
PACS for such purpose. The State Government after purchase of the paddy started
supply of paddy to the petitioner mill from 20.01.2012 to 03.05.2012 and the total
quantity Patna High Court LPA No.1576 of 2014 dt. 20-05-2016 supplied to the
petitioner mill was 37,401 quintal paddy."
7. The assertion of the Miller is that it milled the rice as per the agreement, but the same was not
lifted by the respondent authorities and remained in the godown of the Miller, therefore, the default
is not of the millers.
8. The stand of the appellant in counter affidavit is that in pursuance of the directions of the learned
Single Judge of this Court in CWJC No.3674 of 2013 and other analogous cases, the writ petitioners
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158630749/ 4
The Bihar State Food & Civil Supplied ... vs Sone Valley Rice Mill & Ors on 20 May, 2016
approached the concerned District Collector for resolving the issue in respect of liability incurred in
respect of deficiency/non supply of Custom Milled Rice (for short, „CMR(cid:129)). It is thereafter, the
Collector has passed an order on 13th September, 2013. The learned Collector has found that the
Millers have tried to supply rice of lesser quality than the specification prescribed by the FCI which
was returned by the FCI. Therefore, the government has ordered to recover the value of paddy
including transportation cost. It was ordered that the sole attempt of the Miller is not to pay the
Government dues by raising technical plea and that the Miller should not be allowed to
misappropriate the public money of this poor State. Consequently, the Collector gave direction to
the Millers to pay 40% of the amount within fifteen days and remaining 60% in two equal
installments with the gap of one month. The recovery proceedings against those millers was ordered
to remain suspended who Patna High Court LPA No.1576 of 2014 dt. 20-05-2016 deposit 40% of the
amount within the stipulated period.
9. The appellant filed an application for review of the order dated 13.09.2013 passed by the District
Collector on the ground that the certain letters issued by the Government of India and the
Government of Bihar could not be produced before the Court of the District Collector. Thereafter,
after hearing learned counsel for the parties and taking into consideration the review application
and the documents in support thereof, the learned Collector, allowed the application reviewing the
order dated 13.09.2013 and it was held that the Miller has embezzled 24249.08 quintals of Custom
Milled Rice which according to rate fixed by the FCI at the rate of Rs.1903.13 per quintal comes to
Rs.4,61,49,151 and that certificate case filed for recovery of the said amount under clause 8(A) of the
Schedule I appended to the Act is valid and maintainable.
10. In the counter affidavit filed by the appellant it was asserted that according to the letter of Food
and Consumer Protection Department, Government of Bihar dated 07.12.2011 and the Food and
Public Distribution Department, Government of India dated 11.11.2011, the paddy and rice is the
property of the Government of Bihar, so the certificates proceedings are maintainable under Clause
8A of the Schedule-I of the Act. The appellant is said to be the nodal agency appointed by the State
of Bihar vide letter dated 07.12.2011. It was also Patna High Court LPA No.1576 of 2014 dt.
20-05-2016 pointed out that on 24th January, 2012, instructions were issued that paddy will be
issued to the miller first in the interest of farmers so that procurement process does not get affected.
The Millers became ready to accept the paddy from the procurement centre without any protest or
representation. It was pointed out that Miller has accepted 37401 quintals of paddy and that 67% of
CMR comes to 25059.08 quintals to be delivered to the FCI, but the Miller has deposited only 810
quintals of Custom Milled Rice (CMR) in due time, therefore, the Miller has failed to deposit
24249.08 quintals of CMR, thus, violated the agreement.
11. The learned Single Judge after having considered the respective contentions of the parties set
aside the certificate proceedings primarily on the ground that there is no stipulation in the
agreement that the amount payable by the Rice Miller in the event of not returning the CMR could
be realized by taking recourse to the certificate proceedings. The Bench noticed that in the
agreement executed for the subsequent year 2012-13, there is specific provision for recovery of such
amount from the concerned Millers by taking recourse to certificate proceedings, but there is no
provision for recovery of the amount by taking recourse to certificate proceedings under the Act in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158630749/ 5
The Bihar State Food & Civil Supplied ... vs Sone Valley Rice Mill & Ors on 20 May, 2016
respect of agreement pertaining to financial year 2011-12. The Court relied upon a learned Single
Judge judgment of this Court reported as M/s Murlidhar Sohanlal Versus State of Bihar and others,
1998(3) PLJR 526. Patna High Court LPA No.1576 of 2014 dt. 20-05-2016
12. Learned counsel for the appellant vehemently argued that the amount, subject matter of
recovery proceedings, is a demand for failure to mill paddy to return requisite quantity of rice,
therefore, the Millers have failed to deliver the rice which is for Public Distribution System. It is
contended that the paddy was procured by different organizations on behalf of the State. The
appellant was to ensure milling of paddy and to ensure that the rice is delivered to the FCI. The
nature of transaction which led to agreement between the appellant and the Rice Miller shows that
the money for purchase of paddy has flown from the Government of Bihar. Therefore, non milling of
paddy is a public demand. It is further argued that merely because in the agreement there is no
specific reference of initiation of proceedings under the Act, it will not mean that the demand raised
by the appellant is not demand of a public dues. Whether it is a public demand or not is required to
be examined after reading the entire agreement and the admitted background for execution of such
an agreement. The nature of transaction entered into between the parties is keeping in view the well
known fact that the paddy is purchased by the State to ensure equitable distribution of the resultant
rice through the Pubic Distribution System. Therefore, mere fact that there was no reference to the
Act in the agreement will not make a demand raised by the appellant as not public dues.
Patna High Court LPA No.1576 of 2014 dt. 20-05-2016
13. Learned counsel for the appellant relies upon Full Bench judgment of this Court reported as Ram
Chandra Singh Versus The State of Bihar, 1987 PLJR 47, wherein it has been held that the phrase
„public demands(cid:129) is intrinsically one of the widest amplitude. Not only in its ordinary common
parlance and dictionary meaning, a „public demand(cid:129) is a wide ranging concept. This has been
further and deliberately expanded by the legislature to include within its sweep any arrear or any
money which may come to be mentioned or be even referred to in Schedule I and include also any
interest which may be chargeable thereon. The relevant extract read as under:
"9. Now, the articles in Schedule I have to be viewed in the context of the fact that the
phrase public demands is intrinsically one of the widest amplitude. It is against this
background that one has to construe the aforequoted definition given in Section 3 (6)
of the Act. This definition is by direct reference to Schedule I. The said schedule then
has its heading as "Public Demands" and at the same time makes express reference to
Section 3 (6). It is thus manifest that Section 3 (6)) and Schedule I are one integral
whole which has to be construed as part and parcel of each other. But what perhaps
calls for particular notice in this context is that under the Act the definition and
concept of public demand becomes one of the widest amplitude. Even in its ordinary
common parlance and dictionary meaning, a public demand is a wide ranging
concept. However, this has been further and deliberately expended by the legislature
to include within its sweep any arrear or any money which may come to be
mentioned or be even referred to in Schedule I and include also any interest which
may be chargeable thereon. Yet again it deserves highlighting that Section 3 (6) of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158630749/ 6
The Bihar State Food & Civil Supplied ... vs Sone Valley Rice Mill & Ors on 20 May, 2016
Act is not merely an inclusive definition but expressly says that the public demand
means whatever may be specified in Schedule Patna High Court LPA No.1576 of 2014
dt. 20-05-2016 I. In the result even the broad weep of public demand is further
extended by the statute herein and, in my view, designedly so. In logical essence, this
leads to the result that for the purposes of this Act, a public demand includes all
arrears of revenue or any money due or demand payable which finds place in
Schedule I even by reference.
It seems patent that the legislature has deliberately not attempted to define public demand or
limiting the same. All the arrears of revenue, money or payable demands which the legislature
choose to incorporate in Schedule I become by virtue of the definition under Section 3 (6) a public
demand of which recovery can be made under the Act. The scheme of the definition under Section 3
(6) of the Act and the frame of the articles of the schedule complementary thereto thus become a key
to the interpretation of these provisions."
14. A Division Bench of this Court in a judgment reported as Sawar Mal Choudhary & Ors. Vs. The
State Bank of India & Ors, 1986 PLJR 660 has held that the money dues to the State Bank of India
and the National Banks are public demand when widely construed. The Court held as follows:-
"25. The somewhat involved contention of Mr. G. C. Bharuka appears to me as
suffering from the fallacy of begging the very question that is at issue. It assumes or
proceeds on the premise that recoveries of moneys due to the State Bank of India or
the nationalized banks are stricto sensu banking exclusively and cannot be a public
demand. Now, admittedly, the State Bank of India and the nationalized banks are
virtually limbs and instrumentality of the State itself. One fails to see how monies due
to such like wholly State-owned bodies are in a way not owed to the State itself or in
any case cannot assume the character at least of a public demand when widely
construed. This aspect has been dealt with in some detail in the opening part of this
judgment in paragraphs 9 to 11 and it would be wasteful to tread the same ground
again. It must, therefore, be held that recoveries of monies due to the Patna High
Court LPA No.1576 of 2014 dt. 20-05-2016 State Bank of India or the State-owned
banks would come well within the ambit of public demand and are not exclusively
and entirely banking stricto sensu."
15. Learned counsel for the appellants also refers to a Single Bench judgment reported as Binod
Kumar Yadav Versus State of Bihar & Ors., 2003(1) PLJR 215, wherein, a person taking advance
from the State Government was found to be covered by the definition „public demand(cid:129) and liable
for recovery under the Act.
16. On the other hand, learned counsel for the Miller refers to a Single Bench judgment of this Court
in M/s Murlidhar Sohanlal case (supra) wherein, it has been held that in the absence of any
agreement as required under law, the dues of the Corporation could not be treated as „public
demand(cid:129) within the meaning of the Act.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158630749/ 7
The Bihar State Food & Civil Supplied ... vs Sone Valley Rice Mill & Ors on 20 May, 2016
17. The learned counsel for the Miller further argued that Clause 15 (iii) of Schedule I is applicable
wherein money is payable to Government Company, whereas what is sought to be recovered is the
price of the paddy which cannot be treated to be a money recoverable. Reference is made to
dictionary meaning of word, „money(cid:129). Still further, it is argued that money can be recovered only if
there is written agreement that the money be recovered as public demand. Reference is made to the
judgments of this Court reported as Chandrika Prasad Versus State of Bihar (1969) BLJR 906 (DB);
Prabhunath Singh Versus State of Bihar (1980) BBCJ 344 (DB); and Certificate Officer of Siwan,
Patna High Court LPA No.1576 of 2014 dt. 20-05-2016 Central Co-operative Bank Versus State of
Bihar, (2006) 2 PLJR 176 (DB) approving the Single Bench judgment in Murlidhar Sohan Lal(cid:129)s case
(supra).
18. It is also contended that the certificate proceedings are summary proceedings. In the present
case, there is serious dispute about the rights and liabilities of the parties. The demand has been
raised against the Miller not only to pay the price of the paddy but also along with profit, therefore,
it is recovery of damages and not for recovery of any money. Reliance is placed upon judgments
reported as Budha Singh Versus State of Bihar, AIR 1981 Pat 149 (DB); Sri Rabindra Nath Singh Vs.
The State of Bihar & Ors., 2007 (1) PLJR 192; and Arun Kr. Chourasia Versus The State of Bihar &
Ors., 2008 (3) PLJR 22.
19. It is also argued that the appellant has not paid the Court fee as per Section 5(2) of the Act;
therefore, the recovery proceedings are vitiated. Reliance is placed upon the judgment of the
Division Bench of this Court reported as Sheela Sinha Versus State of Bihar, 1994 (2) PLJR 617.
20. To examine the respective contentions of the parties, certain statutory provisions need to be
extracted. The relevant provisions read thus:
"3(6) "Public demand" means any arrear or money mentioned or referred to in
Schedule I, and includes any interest which may, by law, be chargeable thereon upto
the date on which a certificate is signed under Part II.
Patna High Court LPA No.1576 of 2014 dt. 20-05-2016
5. Requisition for certificate in other cases-- (1) when any public demand payable to
any person other than the Collector is due, such person may send to the Certificate
Officer a written requisition in the prescribed form :
Provided that in the case of an order framed by a liquidator under the Co-operative
Societies Act, 1912, (2 of 1912) the written requisition shall be sent by the Registrar of
Co-operative Societies, Bihar and Orissa.
(2) Every such requisition shall be signed and verified in the prescribed manner, and,
except in such cases as may be prescribed, shall be chargeable with a fee of the
amount which would be payable under the Court- fees Act, 1870, (VII of 1870) in
respect of a plaint for the recovery of a sum of money equal to that stated in the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158630749/ 8
The Bihar State Food & Civil Supplied ... vs Sone Valley Rice Mill & Ors on 20 May, 2016
requisition as being due.
Note 1- xx xx xxx xx Note 2- Requisitions made in respect of public demands payable to Government
shall not be chargeable with any court-fee (Board(cid:129)s Notification no.4-4169, dated the 15th July,
1970."
Schedule I 8-A. Any outstanding loans and advances payable to State Government or to a
Department or Official of the State Government by any body whatsoever.
15. Any money payable to -
(i) State Bank of India constituted under the State Bank of
India Act, 1955 (No. 23 of 1955); or
(ii) a Bank specified in column (2) of the first schedule to the
Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of
Undertaking) Act, 1970 (Act V of 1970); or
(iii) a company or a statutory body, including a registered society carrying on financial transactions,
owned by or in which, Government has a majority of shares or which is Patna High Court LPA
No.1576 of 2014 dt. 20-05-2016 managed by an authority appointed under any law for the time
being in force; or
(iv) the Bihar State Electricity Board in respect of which the person liable to pay the same has
agreed, by a written instrument that it shall be recoverable as public demand."
21. It may be stated that after filing of requisition for certificate under Section 6, the notice is served
upon the certificate debtor in the prescribed manner. Liberty is given to the debtor to deny his
liability under Section 9 of the Act. It is thereafter under Section 10; certificate is issued making the
certificate debtor as liable for the whole or any part of the amount for which the certificate was
signed. Such a certificate is subject to appeal under Section 60 of the Act and revision under Section
62 of the Act. There is also a remedy to the Civil Court under Section 43 of the Act on the grounds as
mentioned in Section 44 of the Act.
22. The first question which requires to be examined is a nature of transaction between the
appellant and the Miller. The agreement executed is not a detailed agreement, but undisputed facts
which are evident from the averments made by the Miller in the writ petition as well are that the
State does not purchase paddy itself. It purchases paddy through the appellant or the Primary
Agriculture Cooperative Societies and the paddy so procured is given to the millers for milling. The
failure to mill the paddy is nothing but failure to Patna High Court LPA No.1576 of 2014 dt.
20-05-2016 discharge the obligation of the State Government to deposit rice with the FCI for
distribution under the Public Distribution System. The appellant is only a facilitator on behalf of the
State Government for procuring the paddy, distributing to the millers and ensuring its supply to the
FCI. Therefore, one can easily make out that the paddy is of Government of Bihar which is evident
from the averments made in the writ petition and also the Circular dated 07.12.2011. Therefore,
failure to mill the paddy is non-performance of an obligation by the State.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158630749/ 9
The Bihar State Food & Civil Supplied ... vs Sone Valley Rice Mill & Ors on 20 May, 2016
23. Section 3(6) of the Act defines, „public demand(cid:129). The definition is not exhaustive as it defines to
mean what is public demand and includes any interest which may, by law, be chargeable thereon up
to the date on which a certificate is signed. Clause 8A of Schedule I of the Act contemplates that any
outstanding loans and advances payable to State Government or to a Department or Official of the
State Government by anybody whatsoever is a public demand. On the other hand, Clause 15 of
Schedule I take into its ambit any money payable to a company or a statutory body in which the
government has a majority of shares.
24. The agreement between the parties relates to milling of paddy, the paddy which is supplied to
the millers after purchase by the funds provided by the State Government. It is an advance to the
miller for giving CMR. May be, the appellant is not the State and department Patna High Court LPA
No.1576 of 2014 dt. 20-05-2016 or official of the State Government, but the nature of transaction is
such when the State is acting through the appellant having entrusted the job of procurement of
paddy to the appellant. Therefore, the advance delivery of paddy to the miller is on behalf of the
State through the agency of the appellant. Thus, it will cover Clause 8A of the Schedule I.
25. The Millers would also be liable alternatively under Clause 15 (iii) of Schedule I. Though paddy is
not money, but what is recovered is price of paddy which is money. Since the cost of paddy is
determinable, therefore, it is money alone which is sought to be recovered from the Miller and not
the paddy. Therefore, keeping in view the intent and purport of the Statute, we have no doubt that
such demand is the public demand recoverable under the provisions of the Act.
26. The argument that the agreement should specify that it is a public demand, is not tenable.
Whether it is a public demand is an inference on the basis of facts on record. Conversely, if the
amount is not a public demand, can anybody confer jurisdiction to say that it will be recovered as
public demand? Parties by consent cannot treat it a money payable as a public demand. So, as a
necessary consequence, by not stating so, it cannot be said that the amount claimed is not a public
demand. Whether the demand is a public demand or not depends upon the facts leading to the
agreement and the agreement itself rather than the use of expressions in the agreement. The
agreement in the Patna High Court LPA No.1576 of 2014 dt. 20-05-2016 subsequent years if uses
the words, „public demand(cid:129) are more of clarificatory nature. Therefore, on the strength of the
subsequent agreement, it cannot be said that the demand raised during the financial year 2011-12 is
not a demand of public dues.
27. Therefore, we are unable to agree with the view taken by the learned Single Bench in M/s
Murlidhar Sohanlal(cid:129)s case (supra). Though the Division Bench in a judgment reported as Certificate
Officer of Siwan, Central Co-operative Bank Versus State of Bihar, (2006) 2 PLJR 176 upheld the
said judgment, but the issue raised in the said appeal was altogether different. In the said case, an
employee of a Co- operative Bank committed defalcation of an amount during the course of the
period of his service. The said amount was sought to be recovered under the provisions of Act. It was
in these circumstances, it was held that Bank can avail the remedy of certificate proceedings treating
it to be a public demand provided the person liable to pay the same has agreed by a written
instrument that it shall be recoverable as a public demand. In view of the nature of transaction
between the Bank and the employee, it was found that it will not be a public demand, but it will

depends upon the facts of each case which will determine as to whether the demand raised is a
public dues.
28. In Chandrika Prasad(cid:129)s case (supra) it was found that there was no written agreement as the
petitioner agreed to work as Patna High Court LPA No.1576 of 2014 dt. 20-05-2016 Stockiest of food
-grains on payment of commission on the request of the Sub divisional Officer. It was in these
circumstances, the Court held that the demand raised is not a public demand.
29. The judgment in Prabhunath Singh(cid:129)s case (supra) referred to by the learned counsel for the
Miller, stands overruled by the Full Bench judgment in Ram Chandra Singh(cid:129)s case (supra).
30. In Buddha Singh(cid:129)s case (supra), the recovery was of the loss said to have been suffered by the
State. It was to be in the nature of damages and not an ascertained sum of money said to be
recoverable in terms of the agreement. The said judgment has no applicability to the facts of the
present case.
31. In Rabindra Nath Singh(cid:129)s case (supra), what was sought to be recovered is the amount of the
scholarship which the petitioner as a Block Development Officer was required to supervise. The
stand of petitioner was that he had transferred the entire amount to the Block Welfare Officer. The
allegation was that the petitioner had defalcated the amount and it should be recovered as public
demand. The Court found that such amount was not a loan and advance by the Government to the
person which the person was required by law to refund or return or repay. Therefore, it was not
covered under Entry 8A of Schedule I of the Act.
32. In Arun Kr. Chourasia(cid:129)s case (supra), the learned Single Patna High Court LPA No.1576 of 2014
dt. 20-05-2016 Judge set aside the recovery proceedings against the petitioner, issued for the reason
that he has been wrongly overpaid while executing the work of Gaya Zila Parishad. The issue of
overpayment has rightly not been made part of the recovery proceedings. The judgment is clearly
distinguishable and has no applicability to the facts of the present case.
33. Coming to Sheela Sinha(cid:129)s case (supra) where for non- payment of Court fee, recovery
proceeding was sought to be initiated. As we have mentioned above, it is Government money which
is sought to be recovered by invoking the provision of the Act. Note 2, which is Board(cid:129)s
Notifications dated 15th July, 1970 is to the effect that requisitions made in respect of public
demand payable to Government shall not be chargeable to any court fee. As discussed above, the
appellant is an agent of the Government who is entrusted with the task of procurement, milling and
delivery to FCI. Therefore, the amount claimed is public demand payable to the Government though
through the agency of the present appellant. Thus, it is exempt from the payment of court fee. The
judgment as referred to above is not applicable to the present case.
34. In view of the above, we find that the amount claimed by the appellant is a public demand as the
paddy was entrusted to the Millers for the custom milling which the Millers have failed to deliver to
the FCI as part of the Public Distribution System. The appellant is an Patna High Court LPA No.1576
of 2014 dt. 20-05-2016 agent of the State who was entrusted with the task of procurement of paddy,

its milling and subsequent distribution. Therefore, it is not a demand by a Government Company for
its benefit, but the appellant is acting on behalf of the State.
35. Thus, we find that the order passed by the learned Single Judge only for the reason that the
agreement does not mention that the amount due can be recovered as public demand is not
sufficient to deny the right of recovery of the dues through the process under the Act.
36. Consequently, the present Letters Patent Appeal is allowed. The order passed by the learned
Single Judge on 22nd July, 2014 is set aside and the writ application is dismissed. There shall be no
order as to costs.
