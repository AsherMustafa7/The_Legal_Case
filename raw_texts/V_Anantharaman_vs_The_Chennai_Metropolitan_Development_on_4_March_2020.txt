ORDER
(1)This writ petition has been filed challenging the impugned letter issued by the 1st respondent
dated 04.03.2020, directing the petitioner to furnish ''No Objection Certificate'' [NOC] from the
Tamil Nadu Housing Board [TNHB] / 2nd respondent herein, for the purpose of considering the
application submitted by the petitioner seeking for Planning Permission.
(2)The case of the petitioner is that he purchased the subject property by way of a registered Sale
Deed dated 30.09.1988 from one Mrs.Charumathi Rajamani. The petitioner wanted to develop the
property and therefore, he entered into a Development Agreement and executed a Power of Attorney
in favour of M/s.KCEE Properties Private Limited. The petitioner submitted an application seeking
for sanction to construct a building consisting stilt + 4 Floors. This application was submitted before
the 1st respondent. The 1st respondent, through the impugned letter, among other things, directed
the petitioner to get a NOC from the TNHB for considering the application submitted for approval.
Aggrieved by the same, the present writ petition has been filed before this Court.

http://www.judis.nic.in (3)Mr.V.Raghavachari, learned counsel appearing for Mr.V.S.Senthil
Kumar, learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the 1st respondent is not justified in
insisting for a NOC from the 2 nd respondent and such an authority was not contemplated under
Section 49 of the Town and Country Planning Act. The learned counsel further submitted that even
though the subject property along with a larger extent of lands was the subject matter of acquisition
by the TNHB, the possession was not taken.
(4)The learned counsel further submitted that when similar letter was issued by the Chennai
Metropolitan Development Authority [CMDA] insisting for a NOC from the TNHB for providing
sanction, the same was interfered with by this Court and several orders have been passed by this
Court, setting aside the said condition on the ground that the CMDA cannot insist for such a NOC.
Thereafter, the properties were also developed and therefore, the petitioner is also entitled for the
very same benefit.
(5)The 2nd respondent has filed a counter affidavit and the relevant portions in the counter affidavit
is extracted hereunder:-
http://www.judis.nic.in ''3 The petitioner mentioned land in S.No.150/1A measuring
an extent of 3.44 acres. I state that the notification under section 4[1] of the Land
Acquisition Act was approved by the Government vide G.O.Rt.No.136 Housing
Department, dt 14.05.1975 for implementing New Ramapuram Neighbourhood
Scheme and subsequently the Draft Declaration under section of the Land
Acquisition Act was approved by the Government vide G.O.Ms.No.956 dated
07.06.1978 and award passed vide no.9/86 for 2.33 ¾ Ac., 1/87 dt.31.12.87 for 0.77
½ Ac and 1/91 dated 12.12.91 for 0.40 ¾ Ac.by Land Acquisition Officer part of the
land measuring an extent of 0.27 acres out of 3.54 acre was taken by TNHB on
09.09.1999.
4 I respectfully further submit that the land owner/interested person as per the
Award is as follows:-
Survey Extent Ex-land owner name as Ex-Land Ex-Land owner No per 4[1]
Notification Owern name as as per Award G.O.Rt.No.136 dt per 6DD No.9/86 dt.

12.12.91 150/1A 3.54 Ac. Rani Dharmaraj Rani Dharmaraj Rani Dharmaraj &
Kuliammal http://www.judis.nic.in 5 I respectfully submit that as per the Award
No.9/86, dated 20.09.1986, the land in S.NO.150/1A measuring an extent of 3.54 ac
originally belonged to Tmt.Rani Dharmaraj when the notification under section 4[1]
of the Land Acquisition Act was published. There was Mango Tope in the land when
the notification under section 4[1] was published Tmt.Rani Dharmaraj has converted
an extent of 2.65 acres out of 3.54 acres as Plots as per the unapproved layout drawn
by her and sold them to several persons. The remaining extent of 0.89 acres is alone
is her possession and enjoyment at present.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/18270289/ 3
V.Anantharaman vs The Chennai Metropolitan Development ... on 4 March, 2020
there are Mango trees in this portion. Neither the lands sold to other parties nor the extent in the
possession of Tmt.Rani Dharmaraj were sub divided. According to the unapproved layout produced
by the interested parties this area [0.89 acre] was earmarked for school building. She is believed to
have assured the sale purchaser in the layout area that she will donate the land for the construction
of school building. But no recorded evidence was produced in this connection. The land owner
http://www.judis.nic.in however claimed that the land is still in her possession and enjoyment.
Since a major portion of the land has already been converted into house sites, and only a portion is
now covered by trees the land cannot be construed as tope. She also did not claim it as tope. She
wanted the compensation to be paid for the land at Rs.10,000/- per cent, which according to her
was the prevailing market rate on the date of award enquiry [i.e] 22.7.86. She is entitled for
compensation at thereto which was prevailing on the date of 4[1] Notification only. Hence her claim
is rejected. She will be awarded compensation at Rs.160/- per cent for the land and fuel value for the
trees standing in this portion of 0.89 acres.
Hence, compensation amount in respect of this portion of land is ordered to be deposited in the Sub
Court, Poonamallee, under section 30 and 31[2] of the Land Acquisition Act.
6 I respectfully submit that the acquisition proceedings was challenged in respect of Survey
No.150/1A, 156/1, 156/3 in Valasarawakkam Village in WP.No.8065/1986 with prayer to exempt the
above land from acquisition proceedings and the said writ petitioner in WP.No.8065/1986 ended in
http://www.judis.nic.in favour of the petitioner on 09.10.1991 ''on the ground of vagueness''.
Thereafter, the Government has preferred writ appeal in WA.No.685/95 against WP.No.8065/1986.
It was allowed on 16.11.96. Order as follows:-
''4.Accordingly, following the aforesaid decision, the writ appeals are allowed. The
orders dated 17.03.1992, 17.12.1991, 09.10.1991 and 10.10.1991 passed in Wps.2738
of 1985, 5404 and 5407 of 1991, 8080, 8941, 8065, 7740, 9990, 10013, 10308, 10853
of 1986, 11514 of 1988, 10333, 10336, 7126 of 1986 and 11515 of 1988 respectively are
set aside. The writ petitions are dismissed. It is made clear that if the writ petitioners
are entitled to the benefit of the resolution No.7 of 1986 dated 02.07.1986 passed by
the Housing Board. It is open to them to make applications for re-
conveyance. In that event, the Housing Board shall consider the request in terms of
the resolution of 7 of 1986 dated 02.07.1986. However, we make no order as to cost.''
http://www.judis.nic.in The petitioner quoted judgment in WP.No.36111/2005 dated
22.09.2006. It was allowed to the petitioner and the records revealed that it is
completely irrelevant to the petitioner subject land Survey No.150/1A.
7 I respectfully further submit that the petitioner namely Thiru V.Anantharman is an
ENCROACHER and claiming rights and title over the acquired alnd in Survey No.150/1A for the
extent of 2 gds 120sqft at Valasarawakkam Village, Maduravoyal Taluk. I submit that the Award
No.9/86 dated 20.09.1986 for 2.33 ¾ Ac.,1/87 dt.31.12.87 for 0.77 ½ Ac., and 1/91 dt.12.12.91 for
0.40 ¾ Ac for S.No.150/1A in favour of the land owner/interested person namely Rani Dharmaraj.
Since there was dispute over the apportionment of extent and compensation, the entire
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/18270289/ 4
V.Anantharaman vs The Chennai Metropolitan Development ... on 4 March, 2020
compensation amount deposited in Court under section 30 and 31[2] of LA Act. Part of the land
measuring an extent of 0.27 acres out of 3.54 acre was taken over by TNHB on 09.09.1999 and
balance was not handed over due to encroachments. After that the petitioner herein has said that
purchased the acquired land illegally vide alleged Sale Deed http://www.judis.nic.in document
No.4046/88 on 30.09.1988 from Ms.Charumathi Rajamani. The subject land was entrusted to
KCEE properties illegally, executed and registered a general power of attorney on 03.10.2019 vide
Doc.No.6128/2019. However, they are no way connected to the property. Therefore, the said alleged
alienation does not confer any rights and title in favour of the petitioner herein. The above
statement reveal that the petitioner purchased the said property after Government published 4[1]
Notification. It is clearly revealed that the petitioner is a subsequent purchaser. Hence, they have no
right to claim over the property.'' (6)Mr.M.Baskar, learned Standing counsel appearing on behalf of
the 2nd respondent / TNHB, apart from reiterating the contentions raised in the counter affidavit,
submitted that the subject property has already vested with the TNHB and the challenge made to
the acquisition proceedings also came to be rejected by this Court in the Writ Appeals. That apart,
the compensation has already been paid by depositing the same before the Sub Court, Poonamallee.
The learned counsel submitted that the petitioner can only be construed as an encroacher in the
property and the http://www.judis.nic.in Sale Deed executed in favour of the petitioner in the year
1988 much after the 4[1] Notification, is non est in the eye of law. To substantiate the said
submission, the learned counsel relied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in
Shivkumar and Others V. Union Of India and Others in Civil Appeal No.8003 of 2019, dated
14.10.2019 .
(7)This Court has carefully considered the submissions made on either side and the materials placed
before it.
(8)The petitioner is admittedly the subsequent purchaser of the property which had already vested
with the TNHB much before the property was purchased by the petitioner. The various orders relied
on by the learned counsel for the petitioner will have no significance in the present case in view of
the latest judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court Shivkumar and Others V. Union Of India and Others
in Civil Appeal No.8003 of 2019, dated 14.10.2019 [referred supra]. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of
India has categorically held that a purchaser of a property, after the issuance of the Notification
under Section 4[1] of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, does not have any right to challenge the
original acquisition or to claim any benefits after the coming into force of the 2013 Act. The Hon'ble
http://www.judis.nic.in Supreme Court has held that a transaction of sale that is effected after 4[1]
Notification is void and the said sale transaction will not cloth the subsequent purchaser with any
right whatsoever. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has held that once a 4[1] Notification is
issued, the property becomes incapable of being sold or transacted and the sale transaction is void
ab initio and is a nullity and it does not confer any right or title over the subsequent purchaser of the
property.
(9)In the light of the settled law, the petitioner cannot be permitted to use the property against the
interest of the TNHB which has become the owner of the property. The earlier orders passed by this
Court and which has been relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioner will pale into
insignificance in view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. This is more so since
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/18270289/ 5
V.Anantharaman vs The Chennai Metropolitan Development ... on 4 March, 2020
the acquisition proceedings has been upheld by the Division Bench in the Writ Appeals and the
compensation amount has also been deposited before the competent Civil Court.
(10)In view of the above, this Court does not find any ground to interfere with the impugned letter
issued by the 1st respondent dated 04.03.2020, directing the petitioner to get the NOC from the
TNHB. The 1st http://www.judis.nic.in respondent was perfectly right in seeking for such a NOC
since the TNHB is the actual owner of the property in the eyes of law.
(11)In the result, the writ petition stands dismissed. No costs.
Consequently, the connected miscellaneous petition is closed.
