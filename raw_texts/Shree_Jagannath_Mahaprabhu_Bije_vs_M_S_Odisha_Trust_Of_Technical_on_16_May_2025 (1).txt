DR. JUSTICE S.K. PANIGRAHI
DATE OF HEARING:-22.04.2025
DATE OF JUDGMENT:-16.05.2025
Dr. S.K. Panigrahi, J.
1. Since both the cases are interlinked, both the cases are being heard and disposed of together.
However, this court feels it appropriate to treat RVWPET No.154 of 2023 as the leading case for
proper adjudication of these matters.
2. The Petitioner, in the instant Review Petition, seeks to assail the judgment rendered by this Court
vide its order dated 27.03.2023 in W.P.(C) No. 8201 of 2022, whereby this Court was pleased to
direct the Shree Jagannath Temple Administration, Puri, through its District Level Land
Sub-Committee, to initiate steps for the sale of the land belonging to Lord Jagannath, as involved in
the present matter. In compliance with the said order, the Sub-Committee was instructed to first
obtain the Bench Mark Valuation for the year 2020-21 from the District Sub- Registrar, Khordha,
within fifteen days from the date of receipt of the order, and immediately thereafter to communicate
the demand to the Petitioner for deposit of the differential amount. The Petitioner was directed to
deposit such differential amount within a period of two weeks from the date of such communication.
Upon receipt of the said amount, the Law Department was further directed to accord permission
under Section 16(2) of the Shri Jagannath Temple Act, 1955 (hereinafter Location: ORISSA HIGH
COURT, CUTTACK "SJTA"), whereupon the necessary land documents would be executed in favour
of the Petitioner.
3. The present Contempt Petition stems from the non-compliance with the directions issued by this
Court in its order dated 27.03.2023. The adjudication of the Contempt Petition is intrinsically linked
to the outcome of the Review Petition, and its fate shall accordingly be determined upon the
conclusion thereof.
4. The Counsel for the petitioner submitted that the directions contained in the impugned judgment
are manifestly contrary to the Uniform Policy formulated by the Temple Managing Committee in
consultation with the State Government, governing alienation of temple land. The implementation
of the aforesaid order would not only amount to a deviation from established policy but would also

Shree Jagannath Mahaprabhu Bije vs M/S Odisha Trust Of Technical .... ... on 16 May, 2025
create an undesirable precedent. This would result in substantial and irreparable financial loss to
the Deity, who is recognized in law as a perpetual minor, and whose interests must be safeguarded
with utmost vigilance. I. RELEVANT FACTUAL MATRIX
5. The relevant facts of the case are as follows:
a) The disputed land, forming part of the Ekarajat Mahal estate, has a unique and
sacrosant origin. It was originally endowed by the British Government in 1858 and
handed over to the then Raja Superintendent of the Shree Jagannath Temple for the
specific purpose of meeting the temple's expenses.
Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK
b) On 14.11.1973, the then Administrator of the Shree Jagannath Temple is said to have issued a
permanent lease (Kabuliyat) in favour of Smt. Rabibala Sinha in Lease Case No. 13/1971. However,
this lease was granted without obtaining the necessary concurrence of the Temple Managing
Committee or prior sanction of the State Government, as mandatorily required under Section 16(2)
of the SJTA. Nevertheless, on 26.05.1981, Rabibala Sinha executed a registered sale deed in favour
of Milan Kumar Sahoo and Srinath Sahoo. In May 1990, a mutation in their names was effected in
Mutation Case No. 949/1989, allegedly without objection from the Temple Administration.
c) Later, on 31.05.2000, Milan Kumar Sahoo and Srinath Sahoo executed a registered sale deed in
favour of OTTET (Orissa Trust of Technical Education and Training), the Opposite Party No.1.
Subsequently, OTTET filed Mutation Case No. 1703/2011 seeking correction of the Record-of-Rights
in its name.
d) However, during the pendency of these proceedings, the Shree Jagannath Temple Administration
filed Mutation Appeal No. 120/2014 before the Sub-Collector, Bhubaneswar challenging the
mutation effected in 1990. OTTET, in turn, challenged the maintainability of this delayed appeal by
filing W.P.(C) No. 11871/2015. This Court disposed of the petition on 06.07.2015, directing the
Tahasildar to dispose of Mutation Case No. 1703/2011 within three months.
e) In the course of this proceeding, the Tahasildar directed OTTET to obtain a No Objection
Certificate (NOC) from the Temple Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Administration.
OTTET then approached this Court again by way of filing of W.P.(C) No. 596/2018, challenging the
order dated 18.10.2017 passed in Mutation Appeal No. 120/2014. The Court, vide order dated
19.01.2018, stayed further proceedings in the said mutation appeal. While the matter was pending,
the Temple Managing Committee, in its meeting dated 29.01.2019, resolved to grant NOC to OTTET
subject to deposit of Rs.1,42,200/- per decimal, and also decided to withdraw Mutation Appeal No.
120/2014, provided OTTET withdrew its writ petition. Acting upon this, OTTET withdrew W.P.(C)
No.596/2018. Thereafter, on 05.02.2020, the Sub-Collector allowed Mutation Appeal No. 120/2014
in favour of the Temple Administration.

Shree Jagannath Mahaprabhu Bije vs M/S Odisha Trust Of Technical .... ... on 16 May, 2025
f) Meanwhile, the State Level Land Committee, in its meeting held on 20.02.2020, deliberated on
the question of alienating the land in question. It was observed that the land comprising Ac.15.00,
situated in Mouza-Kantia, was part of a larger contiguous stretch of land i.e. Plot Nos. 4059 and
4285, measuring Ac. 59.950 and Ac. 16.575 respectively. The Committee reasoned that the sale of
such land at outdated benchmark value would cause a substantial financial loss to Lord Jagannath, a
perpetual minor. Accordingly, it was decided to revert the proposal to sell the land to OTTET,
instructing them to re-submit their application along with a recommendation from the District Level
Land Sub-Committee and obtain the current market value from the Sub- Registrar. It was further
clarified that this resolution would override all Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK
previous inconsistent communications, resolutions, and decisions by the Temple Administration,
including those of the Managing Committee.
g) Upon closer examination, the Temple Administration discovered that the resolution dated
03.12.2019 was passed in deviation from the binding Uniform Policy and without taking into
account the void nature of the lease deeds. The said policy explicitly prohibits regularisation or sale
of land covered by forged or void lease deeds. Accordingly, on 17.11.2020, the Managing Committee
passed a fresh resolution reversing its earlier decision and resolving not to alienate the land.
Instead, it was resolved to refund the amount deposited by the Opp. Party No.1 as consideration.
h) Following this, a refund of Rs. 1.5 crores was initiated through UCO Bank Draft No. 532679 dated
25.03.2021 under SJTA Letter No. 3140 dated 26.03.2021, sent by special messenger on
08.04.2021. However, OTTET refused to accept the refund. Another cheque bearing No. 000942
dated 02.06.2021 for the same amount was then sent via registered post, which was also returned
undelivered and received back by the SJTA on 02.07.2021.
i) In rebuttal, the Opposite Parties preferred W.P.(C) No. 3865 of 2021, praying for issuance of a
writ of mandamus to the Temple Administration to execute a sale deed in their favour. In response,
the Temple Administration filed a comprehensive counter-affidavit outlining the void nature of the
lease deeds, the absence of statutory compliance under Section 16(2), and the fact that the earlier
resolution Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK had been legally and properly rescinded. It
was further submitted that the Uniform Policy, which forms part of the legal framework governing
alienation of temple land, expressly bars such transactions and requires recommendation from the
District Level Land Sub-Committee, which was conspicuously absent in this case, making this case a
fit case for review.
j) The Temple Administration also placed on record the joint enquiry report, current benchmark
valuation, multiple correspondences, and a detailed sequence of events showing due compliance
with statutory and policy norms. However, the judgment dated 27.03.2023 is under review. This
Court directed the Temple Administration to obtain the Benchmark Valuation for 2020-21, demand
the differential amount from the Petitioners (Opp. party in this petition), and upon its receipt,
process the file for permission under Section 16(2) of the Act and execute the sale deed. Hence, this
Review Petition. II. SUBMISSIONS ADVANCED BY THE PETITIONER:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146535957/ 4
Shree Jagannath Mahaprabhu Bije vs M/S Odisha Trust Of Technical .... ... on 16 May, 2025
6. Learned Senior Counsel for the Petitioner Mr. Pitambar Acharya earnestly made
the following submissions in support of his contentions:
(i). The Single Judge, in issuing the impugned judgment, has clearly exceeded the
limited scope of writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, which
does not extend to the adjudication of disputed questions of fact or to grant relief to
parties claiming under void, forged, or fraudulent documents. The order under
review is vitiated by the suppression of material facts and documents by the writ
Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK petitioner, particularly the
non-disclosure of pending applications dated
21.06.2008 and 21.01.2014 submitted by the Opposite Party under the Uniform Policy for the
purchase of the land in question. These applications remain undisposed of and constitute newly
discovered and material evidence, which could not have been presented earlier despite due
diligence. Such suppression on the part of the Opposite Party amounts to fraud on the Court, as
recognized by the Supreme Court in S.P. Chengalvaraya Naidu v. Jagannath,1 thereby rendering the
impugned order void and warranting its review.
(ii). The land in question, being religious endowment property, falls within the purview of the SJTA.
Section 16(2) of the Act categorically prohibits any lease, sale, or mortgage of temple property
without prior sanction of the State Government; a condition never satisfied in this case.
Consequently, all transactions, from the inception of the lease to subsequent transfers, including
those involving OTTET and its assigns, are vitiated ab initio and are legally non-existent. The
impugned judgment fails to consider the mandatory provisions of Sections 5, 16, and 33 of the
Temple Act and disregards binding resolutions passed by statutory committees constituted under
the Act.
(iii). The Supreme Court, in Shree Jagannath Temple Managing Committee v. Siddha Math &Ors.,2
has upheld the overriding effect of Sections 5 and 33 and affirmed the statutory primacy of the
Temple Committee in AIR 1994 SC 853 [2015] 15 SCR 46 Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT,
CUTTACK all matters concerning temple properties. The judgment under review, by overlooking
these statutory mandates, is unsustainable in law.
(iv). The original lease granted in Lease Case No. 13/1973 to Rabibala Sinha was issued without any
approval from the Temple Managing Committee or the State Government and is therefore wholly
illegal and void. All derivative or subsequent claims, including the alleged rights of OTTET from the
year 2000, rest on this patchy foundation. The doctrine of nemodat quod non habet squarely
applies, and no valid title can be conveyed when none existed in the first place. The assertion of any
vested right by the Opposite Parties on the basis of the alleged deposit of Rs. 1.5 Crores is wholly
misconceived. The said amount was not accepted as consideration for a concluded transaction but
held in deposit, pending due diligence and fulfillment of mandatory statutory requirements. The
State Level Land Committee, by resolution dated 20.02.2020, rejected OTTET's application for sale
due to the absence of recommendation from the District Level Land Sub-Committee and the
potential loss to the deity because of undervaluation. Subsequently, the Temple Administration
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146535957/ 5
Shree Jagannath Mahaprabhu Bije vs M/S Odisha Trust Of Technical .... ... on 16 May, 2025
resolved on 17.11.2020 to refund the amount and not to proceed with the sale. Despite repeated
communications, the Opposite Parties failed to accept the refund, revealing their mala fide intent to
enforce a transaction contrary to law.
(v). The Opposite Parties have further misled this Court by misrepresenting facts related to
Mutation Appeal No. 120/2014. The withdrawal of W.P.(C) No. 596 of 2018 was not based on any
commitment or undertaking by the Temple Administration to issue a No Objection Location:
ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Certificate (NOC), and no such assurance was given. The plea of
legitimate expectation is therefore baseless and contrary to the record. The Opposite Parties have
also attempted to misuse documents in OEA Case No. 88/1992 by falsely asserting that 4 acres of
land under Khata No. 4059 had been restored to private persons by Memo No. 1211/IR dated
21.03.1998. The Board of Revenue's order contains no such direction, and this misrepresentation
constitutes a fraudulent attempt to obtain favourable relief. Following the Temple Committee's
resolution dated 17.11.2020, Misc. Case No. 14 of 2021, arising from W.P.(C) No. 3865/2021, was
filed, wherein the request for NOC was lawfully and rightly rejected, particularly since the land is
recorded in the name of Lord Jagannath in both the Sabik and Hal Records of Rights. The direction
of the Single Judge to execute the sale deed in favour of the Petitioners directly violates this
statutory protection. Hence, the thwarted aspiration of the Petitioner in the guise of legitimate
expectations snow ball a legal folly.
(vi). Though there existed a prior resolution dated 21.05.2019 suggesting the issuance of NOC based
on 2000 valuation rates, subsequent developments rendered it redundant. Market value had by then
escalated to over Rs. 2 Crore per acre, and the Uniform Policy mandates sale at prevailing market
rates to protect the interests of the deity. No NOC was ever issued pursuant to the 2019 resolution,
and in view of the adverse decision of the State Level Land Committee and the Opposite Parties'
failure to obtain necessary recommendations, no enforceable rights accrued. Moreover, Clause 7(d)
of the Uniform Policy Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK limits the validity of a valuation
to three years. The Court's direction to execute a sale deed based on the outdated 2020-21 valuation
violates this provision and contravenes the policy framework governing alienation of temple lands.
It also interferes with the fiduciary and discretionary domain of the Temple Managing Committee,
whose autonomy and custodial authority are protected under the Act and affirmed by precedents.
(vii). The Opposite Parties have also failed to substantiate their claim of having invested in the land
or of having come into possession lawfully. Their assertion remains unproven and is contradicted by
their repeated attempts to obtain favourable relief through multiple writ petitions and by
circumventing due process. These actions reflect an abuse of the Court's process and disqualify the
Opposite Parties as bona fide litigants. The direction of the Single Judge to execute a sale deed in
their favour, without addressing the legality of the original lease and despite the lack of jurisdiction
under Article 226, mandates urgent review. The entire foundation of the Opposite Parties' claim is
based on illegality and fraud, which this Court, exercising its equitable jurisdiction, must not
endorse.
(viii). Finally, as per the Uniform Policy and prevailing statutory norms, all vacant lands under
Kantia Mouza in the Sateishi Hazari Mahal category must be disposed of through public auction.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146535957/ 6
Shree Jagannath Mahaprabhu Bije vs M/S Odisha Trust Of Technical .... ... on 16 May, 2025
The impugned order's direction to allow a private sale to the Opposite Parties has no basis in law or
policy and stands contrary to the statutory framework and the interests of the deity. The same is
therefore liable to be set aside.
Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK III. SUBMISSIONS ADVANCED BY THE OPPOSITE
PARTIES
7. Per contra, learned Senior Counsel for the Opp. Party Mr. Milan Kanungo earnestly made the
following submissions in support of his contentions:
(i). The Review Petition is devoid of merit as there is no error apparent on the face of
the record in the judgment dated 27.03.2023 passed in W.P.(C) No. 8201 of 2022.
This Court has already adjudicated the matter after full consideration of the
pleadings and contentions of both sides, including those raised by the Review
Petitioners.
(ii). As held by the Supreme Court in Shri Ram Sahu v. Vinod Kumar Rawat,3 the
scope of review under Order 47 Rule 1 CPC is confined to discovery of new evidence,
mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, or other sufficient reason. The
error must be self-evident and not one requiring elaborate argument. A review
cannot serve as an appeal in disguise. The Review Petitioners have failed to
demonstrate any such error.
(iii). The petition does not satisfy the limited grounds for review. The facts and
findings recorded in the judgment reflect no error justifying interference. The
contentions regarding OTTET's applications in 2008, 2011, and 2014, and the Land
Committee proceedings dated 20.02.2020, are duly addressed. The land was leased
to Smt. Rabibala Sinha in 1973 with prior government sanction (ALR Case No.
13/73). She sold the land to Milan and Srinath Sahoo via registered deed No.
1010/1981. Based on Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK this, Mutation
Case No. 949/89 was initiated and allowed, with the Temple's representative
affirming the lease's validity.
(iv). The land was later sold to OTTET via deed No. 3017/2000. Meanwhile, the
Temple filed OEA Case No. 88/92, disposed of by the Board of Revenue on
27.02.1998, restoring certain lands to the Temple, excluding the subject lands which
remained in Milan Sahoo's name.
(v). In 2008, the Government declined to accept land revenue from OTTET, requiring
an NOC from the Temple. Though OTTET paid Rs.10 and applied for NOC, no action
followed. In 2011, OTTET filed Mutation Case No. 1703/11. After 41 years of lease and
25 years post-mutation, the Temple belatedly filed Mutation Appeal No. 120/2014,
leading OTTET to approach this Court in W.P.(C) No. 11871/2015, seeking early
disposal.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146535957/ 7
Shree Jagannath Mahaprabhu Bije vs M/S Odisha Trust Of Technical .... ... on 16 May, 2025
(vi). Upon condonation of the Temple's delay, OTTET challenged the same in W.P.(C)
No. 596/2018. This Court stayed further proceedings. On 29.01.2019 and 15.03.2019,
the Managing Committee resolved to withdraw the appeal and issue NOC upon
payment of year 2000 benchmark value. A spot inspection confirmed valuation at
Rs.10 lakhs per acre. OTTET deposited Rs.1.5 crores for 15 acres.
(vii). On 20.06.2019, OTTET was directed to deposit the amount and withdraw the writ petition.
Upon compliance, the Temple sought government approval under Section 16 of the SJTA Act, which
was conditionally granted on 08.06.2020. The Revenue Department's 2008 clarification supports
the continuity of private rights over recorded Sthitiban lands.
Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK
(viii). The Temple initially decided to withdraw the mutation appeal, prompting OTTET to not
appear. Later, it reversed its stand, compelling OTTET to file W.P.(C) No. 8201/2022. As recorded
in the judgment, the petitioner deposited Rs.1.5 crores, and the Temple Administration pursued
government approval. These facts, already considered, do not disclose any error apparent on the
face of the record to warrant review. IV. AN EXAMINATION OF THE REVIEW JURISDICTION OF
THE HIGH COURT
8. Before addressing the arguments advanced by the learned counsel on either side, it is necessary to
revisit the settled legal position regarding the scope of review as envisaged under Section 114 of the
Code of Civil Procedure, read in conjunction with, Order XLVII Rule 1.
9. The authority of the Supreme Court to revisit and reconsider its own judgments is grounded in
Article 137 of the Constitution of India. In civil cases, the criteria for seeking review are drawn from
Order XLVII Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, which stipulates specific grounds for such
relief. In contrast, in criminal proceedings, review is available only where a manifest error is evident
on the face of the record.
10. The Supreme Court in Sanjay Kumar Agarwal v. State Tax Officer (1),4 elucidated the
fundamental principles governing the exercise of review jurisdiction, outlining both the conditions
warranting and those precluding such exercise. In this regard, the Court relied on the observations
of Justice Krishna Iyer, who emphasized that a request for 2023 SCC OnLine SC 140 Location:
ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK review, absent a manifest error in the original decision, is
tantamount to seeking the impossible:
"In the words of Krishna Iyer J., (as His Lordship then was) "a plea of review, unless
the first judicial view is manifestly distorted, is like asking for the Moon. A forensic
defeat cannot be avenged by an invitation to have a second look, hopeful of discovery
of flaws and reversal of result......... A review in the Counsel's mentation cannot repair
the verdict once given. So, the law laid down must rest in peace."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146535957/ 8
Shree Jagannath Mahaprabhu Bije vs M/S Odisha Trust Of Technical .... ... on 16 May, 2025
11. It is also well settled that a party is not entitled to seek a review of a judgment delivered by the
High Court merely for the purpose of a rehearing and a fresh decision of the case. The normal
principle is that a judgment pronounced by the Court is final, and departure from that principle is
justified only when circumstances of a substantial and compelling character make it necessary to do
so.
12. In Parsion Devi and Others v. Sumitri Devi and Others,5 the Supreme Court made very succinct
observations. A review is permissible only when there is an error apparent on the face of the record,
or discovery of new and important evidence. The relevant paragraph is produced hereinbelow:
"9. Under Order 47 Rule 1 CPC a judgment may be open to review inter alia if there is
a mistake or an error apparent on the face of the record. An error which is not
self-evident and has to be detected by a process of reasoning, can hardly be 2 (1980)
2 SCC 167, M/s. Northern India Caterers (India) Ltd. vs. Lt. Governor of Delhi 3 AIR
1965 SC 845, Sajjan Singh and Ors. vs. State of Rajasthan and Ors. 4 (1997) 8 SCC 715
said to be an error apparent on the face of the (1997) 8 SCC 715 Location: ORISSA
HIGH COURT, CUTTACK record justifying the court to exercise its power of review
under Order 47 Rule 1 CPC. In exercise of the jurisdiction under Order 47 Rule 1 CPC
it is not permissible for an erroneous decision to be "reheard and corrected". A review
petition, it must be remembered has a limited purpose and cannot be allowed to be
"an appeal in disguise."
13. In Arun Dev Upadhyaya v. Integrated Sales Service Limited & Another,6 the Apex Court
reiterated the law and held that: -
"15. From the above, it is evident that a power to review cannot be exercised as an
appellate power and has to be strictly confined to the scope and ambit of Order XLVII
Rule 1 CPC. An error on the face of record must be such an error which, mere looking
at the record should strike and it should not require any long-drawn process of
reasoning on the points where there may conceivably be two opinions."
14. In the case of Perry Kansagra v. Smriti Madan Kansagra,7 the Supreme Court has observed that,
while exercising review jurisdiction under Order XLVII Rule 1 read with Section 114 of the CPC, the
court does not function as an appellate forum to re-examine its own order. It is well- established
that a rehearing of the matter is impermissible in law, and review proceedings cannot be used as a
disguised appeal. The power of review is confined to rectifying errors apparent on the face of the
record and does not extend to substituting one judicial view for another. Such power must be
exercised strictly within the statutory limits prescribed for review. It is impermissible and
unjustified to attempt to rewrite or reframe a judgment that has conclusively decided the
controversy. After 2023 INSC 610 (2019) 20 SCC 753 Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK
a thorough examination of judicial precedents and principles governing review jurisdiction under
Order XLVII Rule 1 CPC, this Court has summarized the legal position as follows::
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146535957/ 9
Shree Jagannath Mahaprabhu Bije vs M/S Odisha Trust Of Technical .... ... on 16 May, 2025
"(i) Review proceedings are not by way of appeal and have to be strictly confined to
the scope and ambit of Order 47 Rule 1 CPC.
(ii) Power of review may be exercised when some mistake or error apparent on the
fact of record is found. But error on the face of record must be such an error which
must strike one on mere looking at the record and would not require any long-drawn
process of reasoning on the points where there may conceivably by two opinions.
(iii) Power of review may not be exercised on the ground that the decision was
erroneous on merits.
(iv) Power of review can also be exercised for any sufficient reason which is wide
enough to include a misconception of fact or law by a court or even an advocate.
(v) An application for review may be necessitated by way of invoking the doctrine
actus curiae neminem gravabit."
15. Nonetheless, in the case of Shivdeo Singh v. State of Punjab,8 wherein the Supreme Court took
the view that there is nothing under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, which precludes High
Court from exercising the power of review, which inheres in every Court of plenary jurisdiction to
prevent miscarriage of justice or to correct grave and palpable errors committed by it. It was held
that every Court including High Court inheres plenary jurisdiction, to prevent miscarriage of justice
or to correct grave and palpable errors committed by it. AIR 1963 SC 1909 Location: ORISSA HIGH
COURT, CUTTACK
16. In similar vein, in the case of Satyanarayan Laxminarayan Hegde v. Mallikarjun Bhavanappa
Tirumale,9 the Supreme Court made the following observations in connection with an error
apparent on the face of the record :-
"An error which has to be established by a long drawn process of reasoning on points
where there may conceivably be two opinions can hardly be said to be an error
apparent on the face of the record. Where an alleged error is far from self-evident and
if it can be established, it has to be established, by lengthy and complicated
arguments, such an error cannot be cured by a writ of certiorari according to the rule
governing the powers of the superior Court to issue such a writ."
17. In Smt. Meera Bhanja v. St. Nirmala Kumari Choudhary,10 the Supreme Court once again held
that review proceedings are not by way of an appeal and have to be strictly confined to the scope and
ambit of Order Order XLVII Rule 1 CPC. The relevant portion is produced hereinbelow:
"12. In our view the aforesaid approach of the Division Bench dealing with the review

in view of the settled legal position indicated by us earlier. In substance, the review
Bench has re-appreciated the entire evidence, sat almost as Court of appeal and has
reversed the findings reached by the earlier Division Bench. Even if the earlier
Division Bench findings regarding C.S. Plot No. 74 AIR 1960 SC 137 (1995) 1 SCC 170
Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK were found to be erroneous, it would be
no ground for reviewing the same, as that would be the function of an appellate court.
learned Counsel for the respondent was not in a position to point out how the
reasoning adopted and conclusion reached by the Review Bench can be supported
within the narrow and limited scope of Order 47, Rule 1, C.P.C. Right or wrong, the
earlier Division Bench judgment had become final so far as the High Court was
concerned. It would not have been reviewed by re-considering the entire evidence
with a view to finding out the alleged apparent error for justifying the invocation of
review powers. Only on that short ground, therefore, this appeal is required to be
allowed."
18. The Supreme Court, in the case of Lily Thomas v. Union of India,11 after considering the
dictionary meaning of word "review" has taken the view that power of review can be exercised for
correction of mistake and not to substitute a view. Such powers can be exercised within the limits of
the statute, dealing with exercise of power; the review cannot be treated as an appeal in disguise,
and mere possibility of two views on the subject is not a ground of review.
19. Further, in Subhash v. State of Maharastra & Another,12 the Supreme Court of India emphasized
that Court should not be misguided and should not lightly entertain the review application unless
there are circumstances falling within the prescribed limits for that as the Courts and Tribunal
should not proceed to re-examine the matter as if it was an original application before it for the
reason that it cannot be a scope of review. In State Haryana v. Mohinder Singh,13 the Supreme
Court AIR 2000 SC 1650 AIR 2002 SC 2573 JT 2002 (1) 197 Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT,
CUTTACK disapproved the judgment of High Court, wherein earlier writ petition was disposed of by
High Court being infructuous and giving some directions, and subsequent to the same, review was
sought, which was allowed, same was clearly termed to be overstepping of jurisdiction, and
amounting to giving of one more chance of hearing.
20. In the case of Bhagwant Singh Vs. Deputy Director of Consolidation & another,14 the Allahabad
High Court rejected the review application filed on a ground which had not been argued earlier
because the counsel, at initial stage, had committed mistake in not relying on and arguing those
points, and held as under:-
"It is not possible to review a judgment only to give the petitioner a fresh inning. It is
not for the litigant to judge of counsel's wisdom after the case has been decided. It is
for the counsel to argue the case in the manner he thinks it should be argued. Once
the case has been finally argued on merit and decided on merit, no application for
review lies on the ground that the case should have been differently argued."

21. The Supreme Court, in Sanjay Kumar Agarwal (supra) laid down the limits of the Review
Jurisdiction, as under: -
"16. The gist of the afore-stated decisions is that:--
(i) A judgment is open to review inter alia if there is a mistake or an error apparent
on the face of the record.
(ii) A judgment pronounced by the Court is final, and departure from that principle is
justified only when circumstances of a substantial and compelling character make it
necessary to do so.
(iii) An error which is not self-evident and has to be detected by a process of
reasoning, can hardly be said to be an error ILR (1976) 2 ALL 699 Location: ORISSA
HIGH COURT, CUTTACK apparent on the face of record justifying the court to
exercise its power of review.
(iv) In exercise of the jurisdiction under Order 47 Rule 1 CPC, it is not permissible for
an erroneous decision to be "reheard and corrected.
(v) A Review Petition has a limited purpose and cannot be allowed to be "an appeal in
disguise."
(vi) Under the guise of review, the petitioner cannot be permitted to reagitate and reargue the
questions which have already been addressed and decided.
(vii) An error on the face of record must be such an error which, mere looking at the record should
strike and it should not require any long-drawn process of reasoning on the points where there may
conceivably be two opinions.
(viii) Even the change in law or subsequent decision/judgment of a co-ordinate or larger Bench by
itself cannot be regarded as a ground for review."
In fact, by embellishing the wisdom narrated above, this Court shall attempt to justify invoking the
review jurisdiction in the instant case. V. COURT'S REASONING AND ANALYSIS
22. I have heard the representations of the counsels appearing for the respective parties at length.
23. From the legal examination presented in the above section, it is clear that the High Court's
power to review its own judgments or orders, though limited and exceptional, plays a vital role in
ensuring that justice is not compromised by oversight or error. This power may be exercised upon
the satisfaction of specific grounds. These include, first, the presence of an error apparent on the
face of the record; encompassing legal or factual mistakes that are self-evident and do not require
extensive reasoning. Second, the discovery of new and important Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146535957/ 12
Shree Jagannath Mahaprabhu Bije vs M/S Odisha Trust Of Technical .... ... on 16 May, 2025
CUTTACK evidence or material facts which, despite due diligence, were not within the petitioner's
knowledge or could not be produced at the time of the original decision; and Third, the application
of the equitable doctrine actus curiae neminem gravabit, which allows the Court to correct its own
procedural or judicial errors so that no party suffers prejudice from the Court's act. While the scope
of review is not intended to provide an avenue for rehearing or rearguing a case, it functions as a
crucial safeguard to prevent manifest injustice and uphold the integrity of judicial proceedings.
24. The present case is indeed a peculiar one, as this Court finds that the circumstances surrounding
the impugned judgment meet all three established grounds warranting the exercise of its review
jurisdiction. Each of these conditions, forming the legal foundation for invoking review powers, will
be examined in turn to assess whether the interference sought is justified in law and equity. It is not
at all a horrific attempt by this Court to invoke its review jurisdiction, considering the eminently
convincing grounds inherent in the judgment under review. A. Error Apparent on the Face of the
Record: Self-Evident Legal or Factual Mistakes
25. Against the first condition of apparent error, the counsel for the petitioner has submitted that
the land in question, being religious endowment property, falls within the purview of the SJTA.
Section 16(2) of the Act categorically prohibits any lease, sale, or mortgage of temple property
without prior sanction of the State Government; a Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK
condition never satisfied in this case which was mistaken to be true in the impugned judgment dated
27.03.2023.
26. A careful analysis of the impugned order discloses that it unequivocally recorded two
determinative findings: first, that the Shree Jagannath Temple Managing Committee had duly
sanctioned the transfer of interest in the disputed land through lease proceedings in ALR Case No.
13/71; and second, that the lease in question was of a perpetual nature. However, these findings are
vitiated by both an error apparent on the face of the record and a fundamental misconception of
law; the former constituting a manifest error of fact, and the latter amounting to a misapplication or
erroneous interpretation of the legal principles governing the nature and validity of such leases. The
relevant paragraph from the impugned order is produced hereinbelow:
"3. Present litigation has a checkered career. Factual narration as reveals depicts, on
14.11.1973, Shree Jagannath Temple Management Committee passed order in grant
of permanent lease of the disputed property in favour of one Smt.Rabibala Sinha, D/o
Jagannath Sinha, vide ALR Case No.13/71. As a consequence, a Patta was also signed
on 14.11.1973...."
27. The error in the impugned judgment pertains to the interpretation and application of Section
16(2) of the SJTA in relation to the lease granted in favour of Rabibala Sinha. In impugned
judgement dated 27.03.2023, this court was erroneously led to believe that the lease executed in
1973 had received the requisite approval from the State Government, as mandated under Section
16(2). This assumption is fundamentally Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK flawed. The
opposite parties have relied solely on the Kabuliyat (lease deed) to assert that such approval was
obtained. However, the Kabuliyat, executed at the instance of the Shree Jagannath Temple
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146535957/ 13
Shree Jagannath Mahaprabhu Bije vs M/S Odisha Trust Of Technical .... ... on 16 May, 2025
Authority, cannot be equated with the "previous sanction of the State Government" as required by
the statute. Hence, this is the most alluring point to curate a reviewable point.
28. First it is important to present the concerned provision for better understanding of the situation:
"16. Alienation of the Temple properties :-
(1) No movable property of a non-perishable nature of which the Committee is in
possession and the value of which is more than [fifty thousand rupees] and no
Jewelleries shall be sold, pledged or otherwise alienated without the previous
approval of the State Government.
(2) Save as otherwise expressly provided in this Act no immovable property taken
possession of by the Committee shall be leased out for more than five years or
mortgaged, sold or otherwise alienated except with the previous sanction of the State
Government."
(Emphasis supplied)
29. Section 16(2) draws a clear and categorical distinction between the role of the Shree Jagannath
Temple Authority and that of the State Government. While the Shree Jagannath Temple Authority
may facilitate the lease, the statutory mandate is that any lease of immovable property exceeding
five years, or any form of alienation, must receive prior approval from the State Government. This
solitary point itself proves to be mollycoddling issue in the entire episode.
Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK
30. At this juncture, for the sake of comprehensive judicial discussion, this court finds it apposite to
examine the applicable principles of statutory interpretation in the context of Section 16(2) of the
SJTA. The statutory provision highlighted above is both explicit and prohibitory in nature. A holistic
interpretation of this clause, guided by settled principles of statutory construction, leads to the
inescapable conclusion that any alienation undertaken without the prior approval of the State
Government is invalid and void.
31. The use of negative words "no immovable property...shall be... except with the previous sanction
of the State Government" admits of no ambiguity. The prohibition is absolute unless an express
exception is provided elsewhere in the Act. In addition to that, the use of the word "shall" denotes a
mandatory obligation, leaving no room for discretion or implied deviation.
32. A perusal of the aforesaid provision reveals that it is framed in negative language. It is a
well-settled principle of statutory interpretation that provisions couched in negative terms are
ordinarily construed as mandatory and imperative in nature, admitting of no discretion in their
application.15 As stated by Crawford "Prohibitive or negative words can rarely, if ever, be directory.
And this is so even though the statute provides no penalty for disobedience."16

33. In Vijay Narayan Thatte & Ors v. State of Maharashtra,17 the Supreme Court while determining
the interpretation of the negative injunctions See Principles of Statutory Interpretation by Justice
G.P. Singh 11th Edition, 2008 pages 390 to 392 See Crawford Statutory Construction P. 523 (2009)
9 SCC 92 Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK in Section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act,
placed their reliance on the Mimansa School of Interpretation. The Court highlighted that negative
injunctions in statutes, such as those expressed through prohibitory language, are to be construed as
unequivocally mandatory. When a statutory provision uses clear negative phrasing, such as "shall
not...except with prior sanction," it must be interpreted as creating an absolute and non-negotiable
restriction. The Court applied this principle to conclude that such prohibitions, especially when
general in scope and addressed to all, invalidate any act done in contravention of them, rendering it
void ab initio. The relevant portion is produced hereinbelow:
"15. Thus we see that in the Mimansa system as regards negative injunctions (such as
the one contained in the proviso to Section 6 of Land Acquisition Act) there is a much
deeper discussion on the subject than that done by Western Jurists. The Western
writers on the subject of interpretation (like Maxwell, Craies, etc.) only say that
ordinarily negative words are mandatory, but there is no deeper discussion on the
subject, no classification of the kinds of negative injunctions and their effects.
16. In the Mimansa system illustrations of many principles of interpretation are given
in the form of maxims (nyayas). The negative injunction is illustrated by the
Kalanjanyaya or Kalanja maxim. The Kalanja maxim (nakalanjambhakshayet) states
that `a general condemnatory text is to be understood not only as prohibiting an act,
but also the tendency, including the intention and attempt to do it.' It is thus
mandatory.
Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK
17. A plain reading of the proviso to Section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act shows that
it is a general prohibition against the whole world and not against a particular
person. Hence the Kalanja maxim of the Mimansa system will in our opinion apply to
the proviso to Section 6.
18. Laughakshi Bhaskara, one of the great Mimansa writers, taking the prohibitory
text 'one is not to eat Kalanja or fermented/stale food' (nakalanjambhakshayet),
explains the idiomatic force of the phrase (nabhakshayet). He explains that the suffix
'yat' means 'shall', and that the negative particle 'not' is to be taken as attached to the
suffix 'yat' (shall), and not to the idea of Kalanja eating. For if it be taken as attached
to the latter idea, then the sentence might mean 'you shall eat but not Kalanja'. In this
case strictly there would be no prohibition. So he labours to demonstrate that the gist
of the sentence is 'shall not' and therefore the object of it is to turn off from eating
Kalanja (fermented/stale food). This may appear to be making a hair splitting
distinction, but it is of great importance from the Mimansa point of view because it
indicates the mandatory nature of the negative injunction (nishedha).

Shree Jagannath Mahaprabhu Bije vs M/S Odisha Trust Of Technical .... ... on 16 May, 2025
19. The explanation of a Nishedha Vidhi appears more clearly from Jaimini's Sutras
on the Kalanja maxim.
The objector says:
"In a case of prohibition, mentally you entertain the idea of the action prohibited; for
you have to discriminate between the prohibited act and the negation of that act."
The objector means to say:
"what is the good of a prohibition when it invites the imagination to gloat on the
action prohibited."
The author answers:
Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK "When an act is enjoined by the
Shastra, it is for the purpose of the good of a person; if the good object be divorced
from the meaning of the Shastra, then it becomes a case of transgressing it.' The
meaning of this is:
"In a case of prohibition you must take it that not only is the particular external act
prohibited, but the very intention of it is also prohibited."
20. Roughly speaking, the principle laid down is this :
In a case of prohibition one should abstain from the very idea of the act prohibited,
and there ought to be no evasion of the Vidhi in any way. Thus, this class of Nishedha
Vidhis is to be interpreted most comprehensively and as mandatory."
21. In view of the above discussion, it is evident that the proviso to Section 6 of the Land Acquisition
Act is totally mandatory and bears no exceptions."
34. Furthermore, the application of the Mischief Rule, also known as Heydon's Rule, reinforces the
mandatory character of Section 16(2) of the SJTA. This interpretive rule requires the Court to
construe statutes in a manner that suppresses the mischief the law was designed to prevent and
advances the remedy intended by the legislature. The mischief clearly sought to be addressed by this
provision is the risk of unauthorized, arbitrary, or self-serving alienation of temple property, which
could result in the dissipation of assets held in trust for the deity and the public. The statutory
requirement of prior approval by the State Government introduces an essential layer of oversight
and accountability. To construe this condition as merely directory would Location: ORISSA HIGH
COURT, CUTTACK defeat the legislative purpose and revive the very mischief the statute was
enacted to prevent.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146535957/ 16
Shree Jagannath Mahaprabhu Bije vs M/S Odisha Trust Of Technical .... ... on 16 May, 2025
35. Ergo, when examined through the lens of established principles of statutory interpretation, it
becomes abundantly clear that the requirement of prior sanction by the State Government under
Section 16(2) is a binding and indispensable condition precedent. Any alienation of immovable
property by the Shree Jagannath Temple Committee undertaken in contravention of this statutory
mandate is legally void, unenforceable, and non-est in law.
36. Now, turning to the purported "perpetual" character of the lease in question, it is essential to
underscore that Indian land jurisprudence does not recognize the concept of a perpetual lease as a
valid and independent estate in immovable property. The Transfer of Property Act, 1882, the
principal legislation governing leases, envisages leases for a definite term or renewable upon
fulfillment of specified conditions, but does not contemplate the creation of leases in perpetuity
unless such an arrangement is expressly sanctioned by statute.
37. The impugned judgment dated 27.03.2023 appears to have inadvertently disregarded this
well-settled principle of law by accepting the lease in question as being perpetual in nature, despite
there being no statutory sanction or legal foundation to sustain such a characterization. This
oversight is particularly significant given that the property in question is held in trust by a public
religious institution, where heightened fiduciary standards and statutory restrictions govern its
Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK alienation. The conclusion drawn in the impugned
judgement, thus, constitutes a error of law, rendering the finding legally unsustainable.
38. The notion of a perpetual lease, to the extent it has been discussed in Indian jurisprudence,
arises not as a substantive right but as a judicially carved exception in highly specific circumstances;
often where long- term leases contain a clause for continuous renewal or where equity demands
recognition of long-standing possession. Even then, courts have been cautious and have repeatedly
emphasized that a lease in perpetuity must be supported by an unequivocal intention of the lessor,
evident from clear language in the lease deed, and must not contravene any statutory bar.
39. In the context of temple or trust property, such leases are subject to even stricter scrutiny, as
alienation of such property is governed by fiduciary principles and statutory restrictions. Therefore,
any assertion that the lease herein is perpetual in nature is not only legally untenable but also
contrary to settled principles of property law and public trust doctrine.
40. In the context of the discussion of "Perpetual leases," the observations made by the Division
Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Syed Jaleel Zone v. P. Venkata Murlidhar,18 are
particularly very apposite. The relevant observations are produced hereinbelow:
"(i) In India, the law does not prohibit a perpetual lease; clear and unambiguous
language would be required to infer such a lease. If the language is ambiguous the
court would opt for an interpretation negating the plea of the perpetual lease;
AIR 1981 AP 328 Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146535957/ 17
Shree Jagannath Mahaprabhu Bije vs M/S Odisha Trust Of Technical .... ... on 16 May, 2025
(ii) To find an answer to the question whether a covenant for renewal contained in the lease deed
construed properly and in its real context, entitles the tenant to continue as long as he chooses by
exercising the option of renewal at the end of each successive period of 5 years subject to the same
terms and condition depends on the deed of lease being read as a whole and an effort made to
ascertain the intention of the parties while entering into the contract. No single clause or tem should
be read in isolation so as to defeat other clauses. The interpretation must be reasonable, harmonious
and be deduced from the language of the document;
(iii) The court always leans against a perpetual renewal and hence where there is a clause for
renewal subject to the same terms and conditions, it would be construed as giving a right to renewal
for the same period as the period of the original lease, but not a right to second or third renewal and
so on unless, of course, the language is clear and unambiguous."
(Emphasis supplied)
41. From the above observation, it is clear that under Indian law, while a perpetual lease is not
outrightly prohibited, it must be founded on clear, express, and unequivocal terms within the lease
deed. In the absence of such language, courts are bound to interpret the lease strictly and against the
claim of perpetuity. Ambiguity in the terms will weigh against the lessee, especially where public or
trust property is involved, given the heightened fiduciary obligations and statutory safeguards
applicable in such contexts.
42. In the present case, neither the SJTA, nor any allied statutory provision confers the power upon
the Committee to grant leases in perpetuity. In Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK the
absence of statutory support or express terms to that effect, the claim of the lease being perpetual
cannot be sustained.
43. Accordingly, this Court finds that the purported perpetual nature of the lease is legally untenable
and stands vitiated for want of both statutory sanction and the requisite clarity in the contractual
language.
44. The Court shall now proceed to consider the next aspect of the matter.
In the next sequence of events that transpired, on 26.05.1981, Rabibala Sinha sold the land to Milan
Kumar Sahoo and Srinath Sahoo, vide Registered Sale Deed No.1010 dated 26.05.1981. Record of
Right was corrected bearing new Khata No.1036/14 in purchaser's favour in May, 1990 in the
disposal of Mutation Case No.949/89.
45. Now, assuming arguendo that the lease granted in favour of Rabibala Sinha was valid, though
the contrary has already been thoroughly demonstrated; the subsequent transfer or sale of the said
leasehold interest by her is ex facie without any legal efficacy. In law, a lessee derives only a limited
interest in the demised property and cannot convey a title greater than what she herself holds. It is a
settled principle that a lease, irrespective of its duration, even one extending to 99 years or styled as
"perpetual," does not confer ownership rights upon the lessee, nor does it entitle the lessee to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146535957/ 18
Shree Jagannath Mahaprabhu Bije vs M/S Odisha Trust Of Technical .... ... on 16 May, 2025
alienate the property as though she were the absolute owner.
46. The Division Bench of the Bombay High Court in the Collector of Bombay v. Khatizabai Dharsi
Somji Dossa,19 has categorically held that whether the term of the lease be 5 years, 50 years, 99
years or even 999 (1962) 64 Bom LR 311 Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK years, the
transaction is only a lease and there is always a reversion which continues to vest in the owner in the
entire term of the lease and the lessee even if for 999 years does not become the owner.
"27. A man who being owner of land grants a lease in perpetuity carves a subordinate
interest out of his own and does not annihilate his own interest. This result is to be
inferred by the use of the word 'lease,' which implies an interest still remaining in the
lessor. Before the lease the owner had the right to enjoy the possession of the land,
and by the lease he excludes himself during its currency from that right, but the
determination of the lease is a removal of that barrier, and there is nothing to prevent
the enjoyment from which he had been excluded by the lease."
47. In this context, the judgment of the Privy Council in Subramanya Chettiar v. Subramanya
Mudaliyar20 has held the length of the lease to be not indicative of even permanency of the lease
much less of transfer of ownership. The Calcutta High Court also in Kamal Kumar Datta v. Nandalal
Dubey21 expressly held the lease for 99 years to be not qualifying as a permanent lease.
48. The High Court of Delhi in Hotel Queen Road P. Ltd. v. Union of India &Ors.,22 has held that
the right of ownership over a property in cases of lease is not determined on the basis of the
duration of the lease and a lease, even if for 99 years, does not confer Ownership Rights on the
Lessee. The relevant portion of the Judgment is reproduced hereunder:
"13. A lease in ordinary legal sense contemplates demise or a transfer of a right to
enjoy land for a term or in perpetuity AIR 1929 PC 156 AIR 1929 Cal 37 2015 SCC
OnLine Del 9807 Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK for a consideration of
a price paid or promised or services or other things of value to be rendered
periodically or on specified occasions to the transferor. There is a marked difference
between lease and ownership. While the former is only a transfer of a right to
enjoyment to a property, latter denotes a complete and total control over the property
and not merely a right to enjoyment. The lessee of a property is a tenant. He may be
entitled to transfer his interest in the land, but right to transfer ownership vests with
the owner of the said land. Tenancy cannot be considered to be a permanent
ownership, even when the tenant has made permanent structures at his own cost on
the land. Though heritability and transfer may incidents common to both ownership
and lease, however, that by in itself are not sufficient to cloth a person with absolute
ownership...
14. The right of ownership over a property in cases of lease is not determined on the
basis of the duration for which the lease is granted to the lessee. Thus, a lease even if
for 99 years, does not confer ownership rights on the lessee, unless they are
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146535957/ 19
Shree Jagannath Mahaprabhu Bije vs M/S Odisha Trust Of Technical .... ... on 16 May, 2025
specifically transferred to him in which case it stops being a lease. Even in the cases
of lease for long durations, the residuary rights of a leased land belong to the owner
of the land and not the lessor. It is a settled law that the length of the lease is not
indicative of even permanency of lease much less of ownership...."
49. The Supreme Court, speaking to the same effect, elucidated that ownership, in its true legal
sense, implies absolute dominion and the unfettered right to transfer such dominion. A lessee,
despite possessing transferable and heritable rights, does not become the owner, as such rights
amount only to an interest in the property, not its ownership.
Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Thus, the ability to transfer interest does not equate to
the authority to transfer title. In Mohd. Noor v. Mohd. Ibrahim,23 observed as under:-
"5. ...The theoretical concept of 'ownership', therefore, appears to be that a person
can be considered to be owner if he has absolute dominion over it in all respects and
is capable of transferring such ownership. Heritability and transferability are not
doubt some of the many and may be most important ingredients of ownership. But
they by themselves cannot be considered as sufficient for clothing a person with
absolute ownership. Their absence may establish lack of ownership but their
presence by itself is not sufficient to establish it. The ownership concept does not
accord with the status of a person who is paying the rent. A tenant under various
legislations either urban or rural property, agricultural or otherwise, enjoys right of
heritability and transferability. At the same time, he does not become owner of the
property. Transfer of ownership is distinct and different from transfer of interest in
the property. A licensee or even a tenant may be entitled by law to transfer his
interest in the property but that is not a transfer of ownership. For instance, a lessee
from a corporation or a local body or even Stage Government to raise building may
have heritable and transferable right but such a person is not an owner and the
transfer in such a case of his interest in the property and not the ownership......"
50. Notwithstanding the patent illegality and procedural infirmities vitiating the lease originally
granted to Rabibala Sinha, particularly its non-compliance with mandatory provisions of the SJTA,
she nonetheless purported to transfer the said property by way of a registered sale deed dated
26.05.1981 to Milan Kumar Sahoo and Srinath Sahoo. This transaction was inherently invalid, as
Rabibala (1994) 5 SCC 562 Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Sinha had no lawful
ownership or title to the property; the lease under which she claimed rights itself was void and
incapable of creating any transferable interest. Despite this, the transferees succeeded in getting the
property mutated in their names against the disputed land. This sequence of events starkly
illustrates how a void and non-est transaction, rooted in an invalid lease, was ultimately regularized
on record, raising serious questions as to the due process of land records management and the
unchecked alienation of public trust property. This speaks volume of an engineered vested interest is
in operation in the entire transaction.

51. The impugned order dated 27.03.2023 erroneously failed to scrutinize the legal validity of the
mutation entry, thereby acquiescing in a manifest error of fact and law. This omission assumes
further significance in light of the reliance placed by the learned counsel for the Opposite Party on
the said mutation as purported evidence of the validity and official cognizance of the impugned
transaction. However, such reliance is misplaced, as mutation is merely an administrative act for
fiscal purposes and does not, by itself, confer title or legal legitimacy to a transaction otherwise
rendered void by operation of law.
52. It is a well-settled principle that mutation in revenue records is a ministerial and administrative
act, intended solely for the purpose of revenue collection, and does not confer ownership, cure
defects in title, or validate an otherwise illegal or void transaction.24 The existence of a SeeJitendra

Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK mutation entry, ipso facto, cannot be construed as
conferring legal sanctity upon a lease or sale that is vitiated by non-compliance with statutory
requirements, particularly those governing the alienation of public or trust property. Therefore, the
argument that the mutation reflects legal validity or governmental cognizance of the transaction
stands on infirm legal footing and is liable to be rejected.
53. In light of the above discussion, it is manifest that the title claimed over the land in question is
fundamentally flawed and devoid of legal sanctity. The initial lease executed in favour of Rabibala
Sinha in 1973 stands vitiated on two independent but equally compelling grounds:
first, it was executed without obtaining the prior sanction of the State Government as
mandatorily required under Section 16(2) of the SJTA;
and second, it was erroneously treated as a perpetual lease despite the settled
position in law that Indian jurisprudence does not recognise the concept of perpetual
lease sans explicit statutory authority.
Consequently, the purported sale deed executed by Rabibala Sinha in favour of Milan
Sahoo and Srinath Sahoo was invalid, as no lawful or transferable interest had ever
vested in her. The subsequent mutation effected in the names of the purchasers does
not cure this illegality, as mutation is merely a ministerial act for revenue purposes
and does not confer or validate title. The whole exercise is merely a reflection of
administrative oversight, not lawful recognition. Therefore, the interest subsequently
claimed by OTTET, being rooted in a chain of void and ChinnaNarasimha, (2017) 7

B. Newly Discovered Material Evidence
54. I shall now address the second ground for review, namely, newly discovered evidence i.e. such
material facts which were unavailable despite due diligence at the time of the original decision.
55. Learned counsel for the Petitioner submits that, although a prior resolution dated 21.05.2019
contemplated the issuance of a NOC based on the year 2000 benchmark valuation rates, subsequent
developments have rendered the said resolution redundant and inoperative. The Petitioner has
argued that the Opposite Party had suppressed material facts, specifically, its applications for the
purchase of the subject land under the Uniform Policy, which were submitted on 21.06.2008 and
21.01.2014. These applications are still pending consideration before the competent authority.
56. By that time, the prevailing market value had appreciated significantly, exceeding (cid:128)2 Crore per
acre, and in terms of the Uniform Policy, alienation of temple lands must be effected strictly at
current market rates to safeguard the proprietary and fiduciary interests of the deity. Moreover,
reliance is placed on Clause 7(d) of the Uniform Policy, which prescribes a three-year validity period
for any valuation. The direction issued by this Court to execute a sale deed based on the outdated
2020-21 valuation is argued to be contrary to the said clause Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT,
CUTTACK and in derogation of the prevailing policy framework regulating the alienation of temple
property.
57. It is pertinent to note that on 12.03.2003, the State Government introduced a 'Uniform Policy'
(referred to as "(cid:129)(cid:130)(cid:131)(cid:132)(cid:132)(cid:133)(cid:134)(cid:135)") for the sale of lands belonging to the Shree Jagannath Temple in Puri.
Under this policy, lands were to be sold to persons in long-standing possession, in accordance with
the provisions of the SJTA. The policy aimed to ensure that such sales were conducted at rates fixed
under the Act, in a transparent and equitable manner, benefiting both the temple administration
and the possessors.
58. The pendency of these applications is of critical significance, as it gives rise to two key
inferences: First, the applications were never acted upon, indicating that ownership or title in
respect of the land in question was never lawfully conferred upon the Opposite Party. Second,
despite the Opposite Party's strenuous efforts to assert the legitimacy of the sale transaction
purportedly executed in its favour via Sale Deed bearing R.S.D. No. 3017, the act of reapplying for
the same land suggests a lack of confidence in the validity of its own title. This contradiction casts
serious doubt on the Opposite Party's asserted interest in the land.
59. Since it has already been established that, owing to the fact that the original lease in favour of
Rabibala Sinha was itself invalid, the land interest purportedly transferred to the Opposite Party
vide R.S.D. No. 3017 dated 26.05.1981 was void ab initio; it becomes necessary to examine the
additional claims raised by the Opposite Party regarding Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT,
CUTTACK their asserted rights over the subject land, as upheld by the impugned judgment dated
27.03.2023.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146535957/ 22
Shree Jagannath Mahaprabhu Bije vs M/S Odisha Trust Of Technical .... ... on 16 May, 2025
60. In support of the claim, the learned counsel for the Opposite Party argued that the Jagannath
Temple Administration had initiated proceedings under Section 1A of the Orissa Survey and
Settlement Act, seeking settlement of temple land in various Mouzas of Khurda District, including
Kantia. It was submitted that in OEA Case No. 88/92, disposed of on 27.02.1998, the Temple sought
restoration of 16.575 acres in Khata No. 4285 and 59.950 acres in Khata No. 4059, out of which
12.575 acres and 39.950 acres, respectively, were restored in favour of the Temple. The counsel
submitted that the land claimed by the Opp. Party falls under these Khatas and continued to stand
recorded in the name of Milan Sahoo following finalisation of the said proceedings.
61. However, this claim is unsustainable in law. It has already been conclusively established that the
land shown in the name of Milan Sahoo is the result of an erroneous and unlawful transaction, as no
valid title or interest was ever conveyed to him owing to the foundational illegality of the initial lease
to Rabibala Sinha. Any subsequent recording of land in his name is merely reflective of an
administrative lapse and does not confer legitimacy upon a transaction that was void from
inception.
62. Moreover, the fragility of the Opposite Party's interest in the disputed land was further
evidenced in 2008, when the Revenue Authorities declined to accept land revenue from the
Petitioner and directed him to first obtain a 'No Objection Certificate' from the Temple
Administration Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK and to seek correction of the Record of
Rights to reflect the proper ownership. In response, the Petitioner applied in the prescribed manner
using the format provided by the Zonal Temple Office. However, despite compliance on the part of
the Petitioner, the NOC process was never completed nor acted upon, rendering the effort
ineffectual. This episode further underscores the fact that the claim of the Opposite Party has always
been mired in legal infirmity and administrative doubt, never receiving clear affirmation from the
authorities, either in title or in revenue records.
63. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the impugned judgment dated 27.03.2023 makes reference to
Communication No. 5174 dated 08.06.2020, wherein the Law Department purportedly conveyed its
approval of the proposal under Section 16(2) subject to the fulfillment of specific conditions as
enumerated therein:
"1. Sale of Temple Land measuring an area of Ac.5.515 to Shree Jagannath College,
Kaipadar, Khordha with total consideration money of Rs.25.14,840/-
2. Sale of Temple Land measuring an area Ac.0.620 to Basudevpur Municipality for
construction of permanent Bus Stand @ Rs.99,000/- per decimal BMV of plot
no.563, 564, 565, 567 (Gharabarikissam) and @ Rs.60,500/- per decimal BMV of
plot no.566 (Patita)
3. Sale of 85 land sale cases of Puri measuring an area of Ac.3.090.5 kadi to 85
applicants of Puri town area with total consideration amount of Rs.75,60,409/-.

4. The Land Committee (State Level) feels it proper to revert the proposal for sale of
Ac.15.00 land in Mouza- Kantia to OTTET with advice to re-submit the same with
recommendation of the district Level Land Sub-
Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Committee and to obtain present
market value of land from District Sub-Registrar."
(Emphasis supplied)
64. The Court, in its impugned judgement, appeared to treat the communication dated 08.06.2020
as adequate compliance with the statutory requirement under Section 16(2) of the SJTA. It was
observed that the communication amounted to a form of approval by the State Government for the
alienation of the temple land, albeit subject to certain conditions. The impugned judgement further
accepted the submission of the then petitioner ("OTTET") that they were ready and willing to fulfill
the condition specified in Clause 4 of the communication. It also took note of the undertaking made
on behalf of the petitioner that it was even willing to provide the land value at the benchmark rate of
2021, despite the fact that the Law Department's condition was communicated in 2020. Based on
this subsequent willingness, the Court inferred that the procedural requirement under Section 16(2)
was effectively fulfilled or, at the very least, regularized.
65. However, this reasoning is slightly flawed in terms of prevalent law. The communication dated
08.06.2020 does not contain any express or implied approval of the proposal. On the contrary, it
categorically states that the matter is being reverted with advice to resubmit the same along with the
requisite recommendation and valuation. Such language clearly signifies deferral, not approval.
Section 16(2) requires that the sanction must be definitive, unequivocal, and formally conveyed after
Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK due compliance with the prescribed procedure. A
conditional advisory communication directing further action does not satisfy this statutory mandate.
Furthermore, the petitioner's ex post facto willingness to comply with the stipulated conditions does
not cure the legal infirmity.
66. Additionally, the Court's acceptance of a deferred and conditional communication as a
completed sanction conflates administrative advice with legal approval. The mere fact that the Law
Department expressed a conditional inclination or procedural advice cannot be elevated to the
status of statutory sanction. Until and unless the conditions mentioned in the communication are
fulfilled and a fresh, express approval is issued thereafter, there can be no compliance with Section
16(2). C. Doctrine of Actus Curiae Neminem Gravabit: Court's power to correct its errors
67. The Latin maxim actus curiae neminemgravabit, meaning "an act of the court shall prejudice no
one," is a well-established equitable doctrine rooted in the principles of fairness and justice. It
empowers courts to correct their own procedural or judicial errors to ensure that no party suffers
prejudice due to the court's act or omission. This doctrine reflects the fundamental idea that justice
should not be thwarted by inadvertent mistakes made by the judiciary.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146535957/ 24
Shree Jagannath Mahaprabhu Bije vs M/S Odisha Trust Of Technical .... ... on 16 May, 2025
68. When the court commits an error in procedure or makes a slip that causes detriment, this
principle permits the court to rectify such errors to prevent injustice to the parties involved.
Jurisprudentially, courts have invoked this maxim to exercise inherent or supervisory jurisdiction to
correct procedural irregularities or clerical mistakes. The Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT,
CUTTACK Supreme Court of India has repeatedly held that procedural lapses attributable to the
court must not result in the loss of substantive rights or unfair prejudice. The doctrine supports the
court's power to review, correct, or reopen proceedings to uphold fairness and the proper
administration of justice.
69. Its application, however, is limited to errors caused by the court's own acts or omissions and
does not extend to mistakes or negligence by litigants. It enables correction of errors apparent on
the record, such as wrongful acceptance or rejection of documents, misplacement of files, or
erroneous orders, but cannot be used to reopen settled questions of law or final decisions arbitrarily.
Practically, by applying actus curiae neminem gravabit, courts protect litigants from undue
prejudice resulting from judicial errors, thereby reinforcing the integrity and credibility of the
judicial process. In essence, this maxim serves as a crucial judicial tool to ensure that justice is
administered fairly and equitably, free from avoidable procedural errors attributable to the court
itself.
70. In State of Punjab v. Darshan Singh,25 the Supreme Court examined the scope of actus curiae
neminem gravabit which allows correction of unintentional judicial mistakes that may prejudice a
party. Such errors include clerical mistakes, calculation errors, or accidental omissions by the court,
which can be rectified without re-arguing the case. The important portion is produced hereinunder:
"13. The basis of the provision under Section 152 of the Code is founded on the
maxim 'actus curiae (2004) 1 SCC 328 Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK
neminemgravabit' i.e. an act of Court shall prejudice no man. The maxim "is founded
upon justice and good sense, and affords a safe and certain guide for the
administration of the law", said Cresswell J. in Freeman v. Tranah (12 C.B.
406). An unintentional mistake of the Court which may prejudice the cause of any
party must and alone could be rectified. In Master Construction Co. (P) Ltd. v. State
of Orissa (AIR 1966 SC 1047) it was observed that the arithmetical mistake is a
mistake of calculation, a clerical mistake is a mistake in writing or typing whereas an
error arising out of or occurring from accidental slip or omission is an error due to
careless mistake on the part of the Court liable to be corrected. To illustrate this point
it was said that in a case where the order contains something which is not mentioned
in the decree, it would be a case of unintentional omission or mistake as the mistake
or omission is attributable to the Court which may say something or omit to say
something which it did not intend to say or omit. No new arguments or re-arguments
on merits can be entertained to facilitate such rectification of mistakes. The provision
cannot be invoked to modify, alter or add to the terms of the original order or decree
so as to, in effect, pass an effective judicial order after the judgment in the case."

71. In the sacred legal conception of Hindu law, the deity Lord Jagannath is regarded as a perpetual
minor, incapable of managing His own property and, therefore, under the perpetual protection of
the law. It is a deeply unsettling irony that in "Ghor Kaliyug", an age defined by moral decay and
ethical collapse, the very devotees who seek divine blessings and protection from the Lord are, in
many cases, complicit in systematically divesting Him of His rightful properties. These acts, often
veiled under the garb of legality, are nothing short of sacrilege when scrutinized under
constitutional and statutory mandates.
Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK
72. In the instant case, the proprietary interests of Lord Jagannath have been gravely compromised
by a series of illegal acts that cannot be dismissed as mere procedural lapses or judicial oversight.
The lease deed allegedly executed in 1973, without prior approval under Section 16(2) of the SJTA, is
void ab initio. The subsequent transfer of title to Rabibala Sinha, followed by alienation in favour of
Milan Sahoo and Srinath Sahoo, along with the corresponding mutation entries, collectively
constitutes a flagrant breach of statutory safeguards, fiduciary obligations, and administrative
discipline, each of which exists precisely to protect the interest of the deity.
73. What renders the present situation particularly grave is the evident institutional failure
underlying the impugned transactions. These unlawful alienations have not transpired in a vacuum;
rather, they appear to have been enabled, and in certain instances, actively abetted by systemic
administrative apathy, procedural irregularities, and a discernible breakdown in interdepartmental
coordination. Public functionaries, who are statutorily mandated to safeguard the interests of the
deity and protect temple property, have either willfully abdicated their legal responsibilities or have
become complicit in the dilution of the deity's proprietary rights. The governmental apparatus,
which ought to serve as the vigilant custodian of the temple's estate, has instead assumed the role of
a compromised spectator, thereby undermining the sanctity of public trust reposed in such
institutions.
74. These irregularities were further compounded by certain inadvertent judicial oversights in the
prior proceedings, wherein the impugned Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK transactions
were not subjected to the degree of scrutiny that the law mandates. The failure to examine the
invalidity of the mutation entries, the inadvertent disregard of the statutory requirement for prior
sanction under Section 16(2) of the SJTA, and the mistaken acceptance of the lease as perpetual in
nature were not the result of any intentional lapse, but rather stem from omissions and
misapprehensions. These were not issues of substantive judicial determination but errors arising
from inadvertence and oversights that, unfortunately, permitted illegitimate transactions to assume
a semblance of legality, thereby jeopardizing the lawful interests of the deity.
75. In this context, the invocation of the legal maxim actus curiae neminem gravabit is not only
apposite but imperative. This Court cannot permit its own orders to operate as inadvertent
instruments of injustice. It is incumbent upon the Court, as a matter of constitutional duty, to rectify
any such error or oversight, particularly where the resultant prejudice affects the interests of the
deitywhose estate is held in sacred public trust and whose rights the law mandates to be zealously

protected.
76. The Court itself is duty bound to protect the interest of the temple over the property by
exercising parens patriae jurisdiction. The said mandate is on the basic concept that idol is not a
juristic person. Thus, the Supreme Court in the case of A.A.Gopalakrishnan v. Cochin Devaswom
Board,26 held as follows:
"The properties of deities, temples and Devaswom Boards, require to be protected
and safeguarded by their AIR 2007 SC 3162 Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT,
CUTTACK trustees/archakas/shebaits/ employees. Instances are many where
persons entrusted with the duty of managing and safeguarding the properties of
temples, deities and Devaswom Boards have usurped and misappropriated such
properties by setting up false claims of ownership or tenancy, or adverse possession.
This is possible only with the passive or active collusion of the authorities concerned.
Such acts of "fences eating the crops" should be dealt with sternly. The Government,
members or trustees of boards/trusts, and devotees should be vigilant to prevent any
such usurpation or encroachment. It is also the duty of courts to protect and
safeguard the properties of religious and charitable institutions from wrongful claims
or misappropriation."
77. The Madras High Court in K. Senthilkumar v. The Principal Secretary to Government, held that
that "Deity" in the temple is a "minor" and the Court should be astute to protect the interests of an
idol in any litigation. The relevant excerpt is produced hereinbelow:
"26. In the present case, the 99 years Lease Deed executed by one Dharmakartha
Govinda Reddiyar itself is null and void. There are further Settlement Deeds or the
Sale Deeds also cannot be held as valid. The temple property, which is meant for the
benefit of the temple, can never be allowed to be encumbered in a different manner
and in such circumstances, the Courts are bound to step in and deal with the issues
properly.
27. The "Deity" in the temple is a "minor" and the Court should be astute to protect
the interests of an idol in any litigation. Therefore, when the trustee or the Executive
Officer or the custodian of the idol, temple and its properties, leave the same in lurch,
any person interested in respect of such temple or worshiping the 'Deity' can certainly
be clothed with an adhoc power of representation to protect its Location: ORISSA
HIGH COURT, CUTTACK interest. Where the persons in management of a temple
failed to protect the interest of the temple https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/
diligently, the Court is empowered to take notice of such facts and deal with the
issues in an appropriate manner. The Court is bound to take notice of the fact that the
Executive Officers appointed in the temples are being changed periodically and in
many a case, they do not get fully acquainted with the history or affairs of the temple.
If there is lapses, slackness or negligence on the part of the Executive Officer and the
trustees of the temple, "it is the duty of the Court to ensure that the 'Deity' does not
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146535957/ 27

suffer thereby. The Courts should be astute to protect the interests of an idol in any
litigation."
28. Fraudulent and illegal encroachments of temple properties is a crime against the society at large.
Misappropriation of the funds of the temple is undoubtedly an offence and all such offences are to
be registered and the offenders are liable to be prosecuted by the State as the State is the controller
of these temples and the offences are also committed against the State. Temple properties are
allowed to be looted by few greedy men and by few professional criminals and land grabbers. Active
or passive contribution and collusion by the officials of the HR & CE Department cannot be
overruled. These lapses, negligence, dereliction of duty on the part of such public officials are also to
be viewed seriously and all appropriate actions in this regard are highly warranted.
29. The properties of deities, temples and Devaswom Boards, require to be protected and
safeguarded by their Trustees/Archaks/ Sebaits/employees. Instances are many where persons
entrusted with the duty of managing and safeguarding the properties of temples, deities and
Devaswom Boards have usurped and misappropriated such properties by setting up false claims of
ownership or tenancy, or adverse possession. This is possible only with the Location: ORISSA HIGH
COURT, CUTTACK passive or active collusion of the concerned authorities. Such acts of 'fences
eating the crops' should be dealt with sternly. The Government, members or trustees of
Boards/Trusts, and devotees should be vigilant to prevent any such usurpation or encroachment. It
is also the duty of courts to protect and safeguard the properties of religious and charitable
institutions from wrongful claims or misappropriation."
78. The erosion of the Lord's property is not merely a legal infraction; it is a spiritual affront and a
cultural injury. The judiciary must therefore act as the final sentinel against such desecration. It is
imperative that this Court ensures its jurisdiction is not misused to cloak fraudulent transactions
with a veneer of legitimacy. Any judicial endorsement of such transactions would amount to a
ratification of sacrilege.
79. Let not the sanctity of the temple fall victim to legal technicalities or administrative complicity.
This Court must respond with clarity, vigilance, and resolve; restoring not only the property to its
rightful custodian but reaffirming the rule of law in matters where law and faith converge.
VI. CONCLUSION:
80. Large swathes of land endowed in the name of Lord Jagannath, particularly in urban and
peri-urban areas, have already slipped from the effective control of the temple administration due to
the execution of such erroneousalienation of such immovable property.
81. Such alienation of the temple properties have rendered the estate economically unviable, as the
returns are grossly disproportionate to Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK the market
value of the land and insufficient even to meet the administrative costs associated with their
management.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146535957/ 28
Shree Jagannath Mahaprabhu Bije vs M/S Odisha Trust Of Technical .... ... on 16 May, 2025
82. In practice, such arrangements result in a de facto alienation of temple property, stripping the
deity of meaningful ownership while vesting long-term enjoyment in private hands. Upon the expiry
of these lease terms, any effort by the authorities to resume the lands for the benefit of the temple is
likely to face severe public resistance, especially where the land has changed hands multiple times or
been developed. The political ramifications of reclaiming such property are so fraught that
successive governments may be deterred from undertaking any corrective action, thereby
entrenching the loss.
83. The prevailing approach does little to protect the long-term proprietary interests of the deity.
While it may momentarily augment revenue and reduce administrative burdens, it has the
unintended consequence of legitimizing what is, in effect, the permanent transfer of sacred trust
property into private dominion. Such a scheme runs counter to the principles underlying the SJTA,
which enjoins the State and its agencies to act as vigilant custodians of the deity's estate, not
facilitators of its erosion.
84. Having considered the entirety of the submissions, the relevant legal principles, and the evident
lapses in the handling of the subject property, the Court issues the following directions:
(i). The concerned revenue and land records authorities are instructed to take
immediate steps to correct the entries with respect to properties in the name of Lord
Jagannathin their records to reflect Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK the
true legal position, consistent with the statutory provisions under the SJTA and
applicable law. Any mutation or record that is contrary to law and the principles
upheld in this judgment shall be expunged forthwith.
(ii). The State Government is directed to review the existing provisions and
procedural mechanisms under the SJTA, especially Section 16(2), to address the
glaring lacunae that have allowed unauthorized alienation and mutation of temple
properties. The current framework has demonstrated ineffectiveness in safeguarding
the proprietary rights of the Temple and its deity, Lord Jagannath, and must
therefore be strengthened, clarified, and made more stringent to prevent recurrence
of such irregularities.
(iii). The Law Department and the Temple Administration shall ensure proper
coordination and timely communication in all matters concerning alienation, lease,
or mutation of temple lands. No sanction or approval shall be considered valid unless
it strictly complies with the statutory requirements, including prior recommendation
by competent land committees and valuation by the District Sub-Registrar, as
mandated by law.
(iv). The administrative machinery, including revenue officials and subordinate
authorities, shall be sensitized to the unique status of the temple properties and the
fact that Lord Jagannath, being a perpetual minor, requires special protection of his
interests. Any negligence, corruption, or administrative lethargy resulting in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/146535957/ 29

Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK illegal transfer or mutation of temple
lands must be identified and acted upon with due diligence.
(v). Finally, the State Government shall take appropriate steps to streamline and
improve the efficiency of the processes related to temple land administration to
prevent future disputes and ensure that the rights of the Temple remain inviolable.
This shall include digitalization of records, clear guidelines on mutation and transfer,
and robust monitoring mechanisms.
85. With the above observation, the Review Petition is allowed and the impugned order dated
27.03.2023 passed in W.P.(C) No. 8201 of 2022 is set aside.
86. Accordingly, CONTC No.3374 of 2023 is rendered futile and is quashed.
87. In the facts and circumstances of the case, there shall be no order as to costs.
88. Accordingly, both the Writ Petition and the CONTC are disposed of.
89. Interim order, if any, passed earlier in any of the Petitions stands vacated.
