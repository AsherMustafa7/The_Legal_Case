ORDER
1. The petitioner has filed this contempt petition against the respondents for non-compliance of
judgment dated 18.10.2019, in which following direction was passed:-
"It is the admitted case of the parties that the RBA certificate has been issued in
favour of the petitioner in light of SRO No.321. Even otherwise, the petitioner is a
bonafide resident of backward area and had also applied for issuance of the same in
the year 2011 before the respondents authorities. Thus, it is not disputed by the
respondents that the petitioner is not a resident of backward area.
In the given circumstances and facts of the case, I have bestowed my thoughtful
consideration to the matter and deem it appropriate to disposed of this petition and
as such, same is, disposed of, by directing respondent No.3- Board to recommend the
name of the petitioner for appointment as Village Level Worker under RBA category,
on the basis of merit secured by him in the

2 CCP(S) 15/2021 selection process, provided he falls within the merit and having regard to RBA
certificate, issued in his favour by respondent No.2. Let this exercise be undertaken by respondent
No.3 within a period of one month from today and thereafter, respondent Nos. 1 and 2 shall process
for issuance of the formal appointment order in favour of the petitioner within a period of two
weeks."
2. Perusal of the record reveals that the judgment (supra) was modifying vide order dated
02.11.2019 with the following directions:-
"In view of the submissions made in the application same is allowed. Consequently,
the judgment passed by this Court on 18.10.2019 in SWP No. 1301/2018 titled
â€žReitesh Koul and Another vs. State of J&K and Others(cid:129) is modified to the extent that
in Paragraph no.1 of the aforesaid judgment instead of showing the deletion of
petitioner no.2 ( Abhiv Koul ) from the array of petitioners, same shall be read as
deletion of petitioner no.1 (Reitesh Koul) from the array of petitioners.
The instant application is disposed of accordingly. However the order shall form part
of the judgment dated 18.10.2019 passed in SWP No. 1301/2018 titled Reitesh Koul
and Another vs. State of J&K and Others."
3. The brief facts of the case are that an advertisement Notice No. 04 of 2017 was issued by the J&K
Services Selection Board for various posts including 04 posts of Village Level Workers under Prime
Minister's Special Package for Kashmir Migrants in the Disaster Management, Relief and
Rehabilitation Centre. Being eligible, the petitioner also applied for the said post under RBA
Category. The selection process was initiated by the respondents in which petitioner participated
and found place in the provisional select list, however, due to non-availability of RBA category
certificate, the name of the petitioner was not recommended for issuance of formal appointment
order.
3 CCP(S) 15/2021
4. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner had applied for issuance of RBA
category certificate in the year 2011, whereupon the official respondents conducted an enquiry for
the said purpose and in the said enquiry the petitioner was found entitled for issuance of RBA
certificate, however, even after the recommendations made by the competent authority, the same
was not issued in his favour by the respondent No. 2. It is stated that the orders of this Court (supra)
have not been complied with till date in letter and spirit. It is stated that Secretary, J&KSSB vide its
order No. 36-SSB of 2021 dated 22.01.2021, has cancelled the selection of the petitioner against the
post of VLW on the ground that the RBA certificate produced by the petitioner has been issued after
the cutoff date.
5. Statement of facts/ Compliance report has been filed by the respondents 1 and 2, wherein it is
stated that vide Government Order No. 295- GAD of 2018 dated 21.02.2018, a three member
Committee was constituted for analyzing the issue regarding issuance of Backward Area Certificate

Abhiv Koul vs Mr. Simrandeep Singh And Ors on 17 March, 2023
in favour of migrants by amending Rule 21 of J&K Reservation Rules notified under SRO 294 of
2005 and thereafter SRO 321 dated 27.05.2019 were issued by the Social Welfare Department by
virtue of which clause (iii) of Rule 21 of the Jammu and Kashmir Reservation Rules, 2005 has been
amended to the extent of issuance of Resident of Backward Area certificate (RBA), in favour of
Kashmiri migrants. It has further been mentioned in the said SRO that a person who has migrated
from Kashmir Division for security reasons will not be disentitled from claiming this benefit of RBA
even if he/ she has migrated outside the Division/ State subject to the condition that he/ she should
have been registered as a migrant with the office of Relief and Rehabilitation Commissioner
(Migrants) Jammu. It has been further stated that after issuance of SRO 321 by the Social Welfare 4
CCP(S) 15/2021 Department, RBA certificate has already been issued in favour of the petitioner vide
No. 03/RRCM/RBA/19-20/02 dated 08.06.2019.
6. The stand taken by the respondents 3 and 4 in their statement of facts/compliance report is that,
in compliance with the directions of this Court, the selection list was issued and forwarded to the
indenting department vide communication dated 06.03.2020, wherein the candidature of the
petitioner was kept withheld subject to the production of valid and within date RBA category
certificate. It is stated that the petitioner submitted his RBA certificate dated 08.06.2019 issued by
the office of Tehsildar, Relief Commissioner (M) Jammu and the matter was placed before the 177th
Board meeting wherein the petitioner was declared as "Not Eligible" on the ground that the RBA
certificate submitted by him has been issued after the cutoff date i.e. 22.12.2017 which has rendered
him ineligible to claim the benefit of the same in the selection process. It is further submitted that
consequently, vide order dated 22.01.2021, the withheld recommendation of the petitioner figuring
at serial No. 1 under RBA Category for the post of VLW, District Cadre, Budgam was cancelled/
withdrawn ab- initio.
7. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.
8. A perusal of the record tends to show that in the year 2011 the petitioner along with his brother
applied for issuance of RBA certificate and after enquiry by the Relief and Rehabilitation
Commissioner(M) J&K, vide order dated 08.06.2019 the said certificate was issued in favour of the
petitioner. Prior to the issuance of the RBA certificate, an advertisement Notice 04 of 2017 was
issued by the J&K Service Selection Recruitment Board for various posts including 04 posts of
Village Level Workers and the petitioner also applied for the said post under RBA Category, but
owing to the non-availability of the RBA 5 CCP(S) 15/2021 certificate, the name of the petitioner was
not recommended for issuance of formal appointment order. In the month of March, 2020 vide
notification dated 06.03.2020, the JKSSB issued part selection list in respect of RBA category in
which petitioner was figuring at serial No. 1 under RBA category, however, his recommendation was
withheld subject to production of RBA certificate. Thereafter, vide order dated 22.01.2021 issued by
respondent No. 4, the selection of the petitioner against the post of VLW was cancelled on the
ground that RBA certificate produced by the petitioner has been issued after the cutoff date.
9. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in case titled Bedanga Talukdur vs. Saifudullah Khan, (2011) 12 SCC
85 has held that selection process has to be conducted strictly in accordance with the stipulated
selection procedure and if a particular schedule is mentioned in the advertisement, the same has to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/16000276/ 3
Abhiv Koul vs Mr. Simrandeep Singh And Ors on 17 March, 2023
be maintained. There cannot be any relaxation on the terms and conditions of the advertisement
unless such a power is specifically reserved and such power could be reserved in the relevant
Statutory Rules. Following is observed by Hon'ble Supreme Court at paras 28 :-
"We have considered the entire matter in detail. In our opinion, it is too well settled
to need any further reiteration that all appointments to public office have to be made
in conformity with Article 14 of the Constitution of India. In other words, there must
be no arbitrariness resulting from any undue favour being shown to any candidate.
Therefore, the selection process has to be conducted strictly in accordance with the
stipulated selection procedure. Consequently, when a particular schedule is
mentioned in an advertisement, the same has to be scrupulously maintained. There
cannot be any relaxation in the terms and conditions of the advertisement unless
such a power is specifically reserved. Such a power could be reserved in the relevant
Statutory Rules. Even if power 6 CCP(S) 15/2021 of relaxation is provided in the
rules, it must still be mentioned in the advertisement. In the absence of such power in
the Rules, it could still be provided in the advertisement. However, the power of
relaxation, if exercised has to be given due publicity. This would be necessary to
ensure that those candidates who become eligible due to the relaxation, are afforded
an equal opportunity to apply and compete. Relaxation of any condition in
advertisement without due publication would be contrary to the mandate of quality
contained in Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India."
10. It would be appropriate and advantageous herein to refer to the judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in case titled Rakesh Kumar Sharma vs. State ( NCT of Delhi) and others, (2013) 11
SCC 58, wherein it has held that the cutoff date for acquiring the qualification advertised is the last
date of application. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Para 11 has held as under:-
"There can be no dispute to the settled legal proposition that the selection process
commences on the date when applications are invited. Any person eligible on the last
date of submission of the application has a right to be considered against the said
vacancy provided he fulfils the requisite qualification."
11. A three-Judge Bench of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in case titled M.V Nair v. Union of India,
(1993) 2 SCC 429 has held as under:-
"It is well settled that suitability and eligibility have to be considered with reference
to the last date for receiving the applications, unless, of course, the notification
calling for applications itself specifies such a date."
12. In case titled Harpal Kaur Chahal v. Director, Punjab Instructions, (1995) Supp 4 SCC 706
Hon'ble the Supreme Court in para 2 has held as under:-
7 CCP(S) 15/2021 "2. ... It is to be seen that when the recruitment is sought to be
made, the last date has been fixed for receipt of the applications. Such of those
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/16000276/ 4
Abhiv Koul vs Mr. Simrandeep Singh And Ors on 17 March, 2023
candidates, who possessed of all the qualifications as on that date, alone are eligible
to apply for and to be considered for recruitment according to the rules."
13. Again a three-Judge Bench of Hon'ble Supreme Court in case titled Ashok Kumar Sharma v.
Chander Shekhar, 1997 4 SCC 18 in para 6 has observed as under:-
"6. The proposition that where applications are called for prescribing a particular
date as the last date for filing the applications, the eligibility of the candidates shall
have to be judged with reference to that date and that date alone, is a well-established
one. A person who acquires the prescribed qualification subsequent to such
prescribed date cannot be considered at all. An advertisement or notification
issued/published calling for applications constitutes a representation to the public
and the authority issuing it is bound by such representation. It cannot act contrary to
it. One reason behind this proposition is that if it were known that persons who
obtained the qualifications after the prescribed date but before the date of interview
would be allowed to appear for the interview, other similarly placed persons could
also have applied. Just because some of the persons had applied notwithstanding that
they had not acquired the prescribed qualifications by the prescribed date, they could
not have been treated on a preferential basis. Their applications ought to have been
rejected at the inception itself. This proposition is indisputable and in fact was not
doubted or disputed in the majority judgment."
14. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in case titled State of Gujarat v. Arvindkumar T. Tiwari, AIR 2012
SC 3281 para 14 has observed as under:-
"14. A person who does not possess the requisite qualification cannot even apply for
recruitment for the reason that his appointment would be contrary to the statutory
rules, and would therefore, be void in law. Lacking eligibility for the post cannot be
cured at any stage and appointing such a person would amount to serious illegality
and not mere irregularity. Such a person cannot approach the court for any 8 CCP(S)
15/2021 relief for the reason that he does not have a right which can be enforced
through court."
15. As per the settled proposition of law, a candidate/applicant has to comply with all the
conditions/eligibility criteria as per the advertisement notice before the cut-off date mentioned
therein unless extended by the recruiting authority. Only those documents, which are submitted
along with the application form, which are required to be submitted as per the advertisement notice,
have to be considered.
16. In the instant case, the petitioner did not possess the requisite RBA category certificate on the
last date of submission of the application, though he had applied for the same. The formal
appointment order was not issued in favour of the petitioner, as he submitted his RBA certificate
dated 08.06.2019 issued by the office of Tehsildar, Relief Commissioner (M) Jammu after the cutoff
date i.e. 22.12.2017. The matter was placed before the 177 th Board meeting wherein the petitioner

Abhiv Koul vs Mr. Simrandeep Singh And Ors on 17 March, 2023
was declared ineligible for appointment on the ground that the RBA certificate submitted by him
has been issued after cutoff date i.e. 22.12.2017 which has rendered him ineligible to claim the
benefit of the same in the selection process. Production of certificate at the later stage could not
make him entitled to seek benefit under RBA Category.
17. In this view of the matter, nothing survives in the instant contempt petition for adjudication, as
such, the contempt proceedings are accordingly, closed.
