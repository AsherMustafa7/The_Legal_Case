7. Learned A.G.A. has, however, opposed the prayer for bail by submitting that the main role has
been attributed to the present applicant and his father, however, he has nothing to say on the fact
that the applicant is to appear in the Board Examination.
8. Therefore, without entering into merits of the issue, considering the arguments of learned counsel
for the parties; contents and allegations of the FIR and the fact that the applicant is a young student
of 12th class (the copy of the registration paper of the Board Examination has been shown to the
Court); the Practical Examination of the applicant is going to commence from 1st February, 2025
and the written examination would commence from 24th February, 2025; the applicant is to appear
in the Board Examination; the applicant has no prior criminal history of any kind and the
undertaking of the applicant that he shall cooperate in the trial proceedings and shall not misuse the
liberty of bail, I find it appropriate to release the applicant on bail.
