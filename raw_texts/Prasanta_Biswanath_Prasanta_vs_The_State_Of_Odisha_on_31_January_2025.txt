JUSTICE A.C. BEHERA
JUDGMENT
Date of hearing : 20.01.2025 / date of judgment : 31.01.2025 A.C. Behera, J. This writ petition under
Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India, 1950 has been filed by the petitioner praying for
setting aside an order dated 25.10.2024 (Annexure-3) passed in Mutation Case No.411 of 2024 by
the Tahasildar, Bisamkatak (Opposite Party No.2).
2. The factual backgrounds of this writ petition, which prompted the petitioner for filing of the same
is that, one Ghasiani Biswanath, recorded owner of the properties in Mouza-Buxisirapur under
Khata No.31/70 Bisamkatak Tahasil of Rayagada district bequeathed the properties of said Khata
No.31/70 in favour of her son, i.e., petitioner executing and registering a will vide Will No.174 dated
28.02.2008.
When the said Testator of the aforesaid Will, i.e., Ghasiani Biswanath died on dated 20.11.2009,
then, the petitioner possessed the aforesaid bequeathed properties and filed a mutation case vide
Mutation Case No.411 of 2024 before the Tahasildar, Bisamkatak(Opposite Party No.2) for the
mutation of the said properties to his name on the basis of that registered Will No.174 dated
28.02.2008.

As per the order dated 25.10.2024(Annexure-3), the Tahasildar, Bisamkatak(Opposite Party No.2)
dropped that Mutation Case No.411 of 2024 filed by the petitioner assigning reasons that, "as per
Indian Succession Act, 1925, a Will either registered or unregistered will have evidentiary value only
after its adjudication by the court of law and The Tahasildar court is only the executing court, not
the court of law as defined in Indian Succession Act, 1925. Hence, the mutation case filed by the
petitioner is dropped with a request to the petitioner/applicant to file a declaratory suit seeking
relief under Section 34 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963", So, the petitioner challenged that
(Annexure-3) passed by the Tahasildar, Bisamkatak (Opposite Party No.2) by filing this writ petition
on the ground that, "When the properties covered under the Will No.174 dated 28.02.2008 executed
in favour of the petitioner are situated in the district of Rayagada and the said Will has been
executed in the District of, Rayagada, which is outside the area specified in the Clauses of Section 57
of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 and when Rayagada District was under the ex-princely State,
then, the question of probation of that Will does not arise. For which, The Tahasildar,
Bisamkatak(Opposite Party No.2) should not have dropped the said mutation case as per
Annexure-3".
3. I have already heard from the learned counsel for the petitioner and learned Additional
Government Advocate for the State(Opposite Parties).
4. It is the settled propositions of law that, when a Will in question is executed in the Districts, which
were coming under the ex-princely State like Mayurbhanj, Bolangir, Koraput, Dhenkanal, Ganjam,
Sundargarh, Sambalpur, Angul, Keonjhar, Rayagada, Jharsuguda, Malkanagiri and others, no
probate of Will is necessary. In the said Districts, Revenue Authorities and Tahasildars can proceed
with the mutation cases on the basis of un-probated Wills.
5. On this aspect, it has already been clarified by the Hon'ble Courts in the ratio of the decisions
reported in (I) 1972(2) C.W.R.-1451, Amrutlal Majhi and others vrs.
Japi Sahuani and others. (II) AIR 1973 Orissa-112, Balaram Tripathy and another vrs. Lokanath
Tripathy. (III) 48(1979) CLT-211 (Para-8), Mst. Radha Hota vrs. Dutika Satpathy and another, (IV)

Odisha and others. (XI) 2023(I) CLR-621, Amrita Pandey vrs. State of Orissa and another that, "If
the Wills are executed in a place either outside the areas specified in the clauses of Section 57 of the
Indian Succession Act, 1925 or in respect of the immovable properties situated beyond the
territories specified in clauses of Section 57 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925, those
areas/territories were under the ex-princely State called as Gadajat Wills, probate of such Wills are
not required under law. The Revenue Authorities in the said areas can proceed with the mutation
cases on the basis of un-probated Wills."

6. Government of Orissa has issued a Letter vide letter No.23734 dated 13.08.2019 to the Collector,
Mayurbhanj (which district was also coming under the ex-princely State) on the basis of the decision
of this Hon'ble Courts in a case between Ritesh Kumar Patel @ Ritesh Patel vrs. Koshore Chandra
Patel and others : reported in 2015(II) OLR- 1025, modifying the previous Letter No.16449 dated
07.05.2018 that, "probate of a Will is not required in the District of Mayurbhanj and the Revenue
Authorities can proceed with the mutation case, if the same is filed for mutation on the basis of
un-probated Will. Because, initiation of probate proceeding for probation of a Will is not necessary
in the district of Mayurbhanj. For which, the restriction for mutation of the properties on the basis
of an un-probated Will in the district of Mayurbhanj as directed earlier in Para No.6 of Letter
No.16449 dated 07.05.2018 of the Government stands modified."
7. In view of the ratio of the aforesaid decisions of the Hon'ble Courts as well as Letter No.23734
dated 13.08.2019 of Government of Odisha, "no probate is necessary in respect of "Gadajat Wills"
and the revenue courts including Tahasildars in such areas of the Districts in the State shall
entertain mutation cases on the basis of un-probated Wills.
8. As per law, it is beyond the jurisdiction of the revenue authorities to decide the disputed matters
concerning the Wills, if dispute arises before the revenue authorities either in respect of the
genuineness of the Will in question or in respect of the properties covered under the Will.
9. On this aspect, the propositions of law has already been clarified by the Hon'ble Courts and Apex
Court in the ratio of the following decisions:-
(i) In a case between Pradeep Kumar Singh and another vrs. State of Uttar Pradesh Through Secy.
Revenue Lko. and others : reported in 2022(4) Civil Court Cases-455(Allahabad) that, in a mutation
case, where Will is still subject to scrutiny of appropriate civil Court, then finding of civil Court will
be binding on mutation court.
(Para-15)
(ii) In a case between Noor Ahmad @ Chand vrs.
Board of Revenue and others : reported in
2022(1) Civil Court Cases-391(Allahabad)-- Legality of Will, cannot be tested in mutation
proceedings and could have been tested only in a regular proceedings.(Para-6)
(iii) In a case between Ashok Kumar Pati and another vrs. State of Orissa and others : reported in
2021(I) OLR-655--Contentious issue of title claim based on a Will cannot be decided by a Revisional
Authority under Section 15(b) of OSS Act, 1958--Amount to exercise of excess jurisdiction--Issue of
title can only be decided by a Civil Court.
(iv) In a case between Jitendra Singh vrs. State of Madhya Pradesh and others : reported in 2021(4)
Civil Court Cases(S.C.)-29--Mutation--When an application for mutation is filed on the basis of Will,
if dispute is with respect to title and more particularly, when mutation is sought on the basis of Will,
such party has to get his rights crystalized by Civil Court and only thereafter on the basis of decision
of Civil Court, necessary mutation entry can be made.(Para-5)

10. It is the clarified propositions of law according to the principles of law enunciated in the ratio of
the above decisions of the Hon'ble Courts and Apex Court as well as Letter No.23734 dated
13.08.2019 of the Government of Orissa that, "Mutation cases in the areas inside the State of
Odisha, those were coming under the ex-princely State, on the basis of un-probated Wills are
entertainable by the Revenue Authorities and Tahasildars, but, if after initiation of mutation
proceedings on the basis of un-probated Wills, any dispute either in respect to the genuineness of
such un-probated Wills in question or any dispute concerning the properties covered under the said
Wills is raised, then, the Revenue Authorities and Tahasildars have no other option, but, to drop the
mutation proceeding directing the parties thereof to crystalize their rights by the Civil Court and
only thereafter on the basis of the decision of the Civil Court, necessary mutation entry can be made.
Because, in a mutation proceeding, Revenue Authorities and Tahasildars have no jurisdiction to
decide any contentious issue based on a Will.
11. As per the discussions and observations made above, when, it is held that, there is no
requirement for probation of the Will executed in favour of the wit petitioner (applicant in Mutation
Case No.411 of 2024), because the said Will dated 28.08.2008 has been executed in the District of
Rayagada, (which was under the ex-princely State remaining with undivided Koraput District) in
respect of the properties under Bisamkatak Tahasil, then, at this juncture, order dated
25.10.2024(Annexure-3) passed by the Tahasildar, Bisamkatak (Opposite Party no.2) to drop the
Mutation Case No.411 of 2024, requesting him (petitioner) to file a declaratory suit seeking reliefs
under Section 34 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 cannot be sustainable under law.
For which, order dated 25.10.2024 (Annexure-3) passed by the Opposite Party No.2 (Tahasildar,
Bisamkatak) in Mutation Case No.411 of 2024 is to be quashed.
Therefore, the writ petition filed by the petitioner is allowed. Order dated 25.10.2024 (Annexure-3)
passed in Mutation Case No.411 of 2024 by the Opposite Party No.2(Tahasildar, Bisamkatak) is
quashed.
12. The Tahasildar, Bisamkatak (Opposite Party No.2) is directed to consider the mutation case vide
Mutation Case No.411 of 2024 afresh and to proceed with the same as per law following the
formulated guidelines given in this judgment.
13. In order to avoid the similar nature of litigation in future relating to mutation of records on the
basis of un-probated Wills in Gadjat areas of the State of Odisha (those were under ex-princely
State), it is pertinent to issue the following guidelines to be followed by the Revenue
Authorities-cum-Tahasildars, for initiation and disposal of mutation cases on the basis of the
un-probated Wills i.e.:-
(i) The Revenue Authorities including The Tahasildars and others, those are dealing with the
mutation cases in the areas inside the State of Odisha (those were under ex-princely State) cannot
refuse to entertain/register mutation cases on the basis of un-probated Wills.

(ii) Soon after, registration of a mutation case, on the basis of an un-probated Will, a report is to be
called for from the local Revenue Inspector or from any other authentic source, as it deems fit and
proper to ascertain the names and addresses of all the legal heirs of the testator or testators in the
natural line of succession.
(iii) After ascertaining the names and addresses of all the legal heirs of the testator or testators in
the natural line of succession, notices shall be issued to them along with notices to others, if any, as
per law inviting their objection and participation.
(iv) If after receiving such notices, dispute is raised by the invitees of the notices either in respect of
the genuineness of the Will in question or in respect of the properties covered under the said Will,
then, the Revenue Authorities or Tahasildars shall drop the mutation proceeding leaving the parties
to get their rights crystalized before the civil Court.
(v) After crystallization of their rights before the Civil Court, necessary mutation entry can be made
by the Revenue Authorities or Tahasildars on the basis of decree of the Civil Court.
14. So, with the aforesaid findings, observations, clarifications and guidelines, this writ petition is
disposed of finally.
