St. Michaels Educational Association ... vs Commissioner Of Income Tax I,Patna on 13 August, 2019
'the Act' has been cancelled, has been confirmed.
Facts of the case leading to the impugned orders briefly
stated is that the appellant is an educational institution registered
Patna High Court MA No.438 of 2015 dt.13-08-2019
2/18
under the Societies Registration Act 1860 running in the name
and style of St. Michael's High School. The educational
activities of the appellant are regulated under the memorandum
of association as well as the rules and regulations framed there
under and it is bearing consideration of the avowed object for
which the institution was set up that the appellant was granted
registration under Section 12AA of 'the Act' bearing registration
no. 7/84-85 on 26.04.1985 by the respondent Commissioner.
The copies of the memorandum of association as well as the
rules and regulations framed by the institution together with the
registration so granted under Section 12AA of 'the Act' are
enclosed at Annexures 1 and 2 respectively to the appeal. It is
after a lapse of more than 26 years that the appellant institution
was served with a show cause notice issued from the office of
the Commissioner of Income Tax I, Patna which is dated
09.08.2011
putting the appellant on show cause as to why his registration under section 12AA be not cancelled.
The notice dated 09.08.2011 is issued by the Commissioner of Income Tax I, Patna in purported
exercise of powers vested under Section 12AA (3) of 'the Act' and is impugned at Annexure 3. The
appellant filed an exhaustive reply to the notice, a copy of which is at Annexure 4 and which has
been met by the order impugned Patna High Court MA No.438 of 2015 dt.13-08-2019 dated
28.06.2012 of the Commissioner of Income Tax I, Patna whereby the registration of the appellant
under Section 12AA has been cancelled in purported exercise of powers vested in the Commissioner
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/181079192/ 2
St. Michaels Educational Association ... vs Commissioner Of Income Tax I,Patna on 13 August, 2019
of Income Tax under Section 12AA(3) of 'the Act' and which has been confirmed by the Tribunal
when the appeal of the appellant bearing ITA no. 141/Pat/2012 was dismissed on 22.04.2015. It is
feeling aggrieved by the said orders that the appellant is before this Court.
Mr. D.V. Pathy, learned counsel has appeared for the appellant while the department is represented
by their Sr. Standing Counsel, Ms. Archana Sinha.
Mr. Pathy after taking this Court through the sequence of events which we have already taken note
above has submitted that the order of cancellation of registration granted to the appellant under
Section 12AA of 'the Act' is per se illegal and the order passed by the Commissioner of Income Tax as
confirmed by the Tribunal in purported exercise of powers vested under Section 12AA(3) lacks
foundation as the facts accompanying the present case do not satisfy the prerequisites for such
exercise. According to Mr. Pathy the registration to the appellant was granted by the Commissioner
of Income Tax after recording satisfaction as to the eligibility of the appellant for Patna High Court
MA No.438 of 2015 dt.13-08-2019 grant of such registration and there has been no change in
circumstances in between the date on which such registration was granted i.e., 26.04.1985 and the
date on which it had been cancelled i.e. 28.06.2012 inasmuch as the petitioner continues to abide by
the prescription present in the memorandum of association and the rules and regulations governing
the school which was taken into consideration by the Commissioner of Income Tax at the stage of
grant of such registration. He further submits that the power vested in the Commissioner of Income
Tax to cancel such registration can be found in the provisions of Section 12AA(3) but it is only where
the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner is satisfed that the activities of such trust or the
institution are not genuine or are not being carried out in accordance with the objects of the trust or
institution that such an order can be passed and not in any other circumstance. In reference to the
orders put to challenge it is submitted by Mr. Pathy that no such instance has been laid down in the
orders impugned of the appellant either of the activities of the institution being not genuine or not
being carried out in accordance with the objects for which it had been set up rather it is bearing note
of certain decisions taken in the board meeting and forming an opinion as to the eligibility of the
Patna High Court MA No.438 of 2015 dt.13-08-2019 appellant to the exceptions present in Section
13 (1) (b) that the registration itself has been canceled.
According, to Mr. Pathy, the foundation for the exercise under Section 12AA (3) of 'the Act' is
entirely distinct with the scope and extent of exercise under Section 13(1) (b) of 'the act' inasmuch as
even if any part of the income of the institution enjoying the registration under Section 12AA of 'the
act' is not found eligible from exemption, such instance ipso facto is not sufficient to warrant a
cancellation of the registration itself until there is a satisfaction recorded by the Commissioner or
the Principal Commissioner of Income Tax that the activities of the institution are not genuine or
are not being carried out in accordance with the objects for which it had been established, which is
not the case in hand.
Learned counsel in support has relied upon a judgment of the Bombay High Court in Income Tax
Appeal no. 43 of 2015 (Commissioner of Income Tax II vs. The Mumbai Metropolitan Regional Iron
and steel Market Committee).

St. Michaels Educational Association ... vs Commissioner Of Income Tax I,Patna on 13 August, 2019
It is after hearing Mr. Pathy on the issue raised that this Court by order dated 25.07.2019 has
recorded the substantial questions of law which arises in the present appeal and which runs as
follows :
Patna High Court MA No.438 of 2015 dt.13-08-2019 "(A) Whether the registration
granted to the appellant under Section 12AA of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (hereinafter
referred to as 'the Act') could be cancelled by the Commissioner in purported exercise
of power vested in him under Section 12AA(3) of the Act for alleged violation of the
provisions of Section 13(1)(b) of the act?
(B) Whether the purported action satisfies the conditions precedent for such
cancellation as present in Section 12AA(3), in absence of satisfaction recorded by the
Commissioner on such violation.
(C) Whether the dis-allowance of any income from exemption for reasons present in
Section 13(1) (b) of the Act, can be a circumstance to invite a cancellation of
registration under Section 12AA(3) of the Act."
Since the respondent department was represented by their Sr. Standing Counsel that we posted the
matter for final hearing and disposal on 01.08.2019 and while Mr. Pathy reiterated the submissions
which we have already taken note above, the issue was contested by Ms. Sinha to canvass in defence
of the impugned action by submitting that the action impugned is in accordance with the statutory
provisions and that there is no infirmity attached to it. According to Ms. Sinha, sufficient power is
vested in the Commissioner of Income Tax to cancel a Patna High Court MA No.438 of 2015
dt.13-08-2019 registration granted to any trust or any institution under Section 12AA of 'the Act' in
case, the activities are found not in accordance with the objects for which it had been set up and
since the decision of the governing body of the institution which has been taken note of by the
Commissioner in his order reflected that the appellant institution was in fact espousing the cause of
a religion in particular and not open for the benefit of the other communities that the Commissioner
bearing note of the resolutions so present, has canceled the registration which order suffers no
infirmity.
Learned counsel has made reference to the provision of Section 2(15) of 'the Act' to submit that it
explains the term 'charitable purpose' and it is every activity which is to the benefit of the public in
general which comes within its fold. In reference to the show cause notice at Annexure 3 it is
submitted by learned counsel for the department that since it was noted that the appellant was
espousing the cause of a religion in particular and was using its income for benefit of a particular
religious community that in view of the provisions so present in Section 13(1) (b) of 'the Act' the
appellant was put on notice and since the reply present at Annexure 4 failed to satisfy the
Commissioner of Income Tax, the impugned order was passed Patna High Court MA No.438 of 2015
dt.13-08-2019 which has been confirmed by the Tribunal. According to Ms. Sinha even if the
appellant institution was set up with a benevolent object, in case it deviates from its object, there is
sufficient power vested in the Commissioner of Income Tax under Section 12AA (3) to cancel such
registration and it is bearing note of the deviation in the activities of the appellant institution to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/181079192/ 4
St. Michaels Educational Association ... vs Commissioner Of Income Tax I,Patna on 13 August, 2019
espouse the cause of a religious community in particular which has pursueded the Commissioner of
Income Tax to pass the order impugned.
Learned counsel for the Department has in support of her submission that where an institution or
trust would fail in its object for which it was set up or is found to be espousing the cause of a
particular religious community, the institution/trust would lose the eligibility for exemption of its
income and consequently invite cancellation of registration to derive such benefit, relied on the
following judgments:
1. (2001) 248 ITR 587 (Ghulam Mohidin Trust vs. Commissioner of Income Tax) (J&
K)
2. (2002) 254 ITR 2012 (Commissioner of Income Tax v. Palghat Shadi Mahal Trust)
(SC)
3. Civil Appeal No. 1381 of 2019 (Commissioner of Income Tax (Exemption) vs.
Jagannath Gupta Family Trust) Mr. Pathy in his short reply has submitted that in the
Patna High Court MA No.438 of 2015 dt.13-08-2019 entire order passed by the
Commissioner of Income Tax as affirmed by the Tribunal, there is no whisper
regarding the affairs of the appellant institution not being genuine or that the
institution is failing on its object for which it was set up rather it is hiding behind the
provisions of section 13 (1) (b) of 'the Act' that the registration is being canceled
which is not one of the prerequisites present in Section 12AA(3) of 'the Act' to invite
such cancellation even if this objection may be a matter for consideration at the time
of assessment.
We have heard learned counsel for the parties and we have perused the record.
Ms. Sinha is absolutely correct when she submits that a registration under Section 12AA is not so
sacrosanct that once granted it can never be interfered. In fact the parliament has been conscious to
vest jurisdiction in the Commissioner of Income Tax under Section 12AA (3) to exercise such
jurisdiction as canvassed by Ms. Sinha provided the prerequisites to such exercise is present.
We would straight away advert our attention to the show cause served on the appellant which lies at
the foundation of the exercise and a copy of which is at Annexure 3 to the appeal. The Commissioner
of Income Tax I, Patna after taking note of the Patna High Court MA No.438 of 2015 dt.13-08-2019
registration granted to the appellant more than 26 years ago back has after taking notice of certain
decisions taken in the governing body meeting which in the opinion of the Commissioner of Income
Tax was taken was for the benefit of a particular religious community, and which in turn made the
appellant institution ineligible for exclusion of his total income under sections 11 and 12 of 'the Act'
in view of the provisions present in Section 13(1) (b) of 'the Act'. It is drawing such premise that the
notice was served on the appellant on the proposed action for cancellation of registration granted
under Section 12AA of 'the Act'.

St. Michaels Educational Association ... vs Commissioner Of Income Tax I,Patna on 13 August, 2019
Although exhaustive arguments have been advanced by Mr. Pathy, for the petitioner as well as Ms.
Sinha, learned counsel appearing for the Income Tax Department but in our opinion the entire issue
revolves around the question, whether or not, the power has been exercised by the Commissioner,
Income Tax in accordance with the provisions of Section 12AA(3) of the Act or he has overstepped
his jurisdiction in the process and which illegality, if any, has been perpetuated in the confirmation
order passed by the tribunal.
The show cause notice issued under Section 12AA(3) of 'the Act' as noted above, takes notice of the
resolutions passed Patna High Court MA No.438 of 2015 dt.13-08-2019 by the governing body in its
meeting held from time to time and there is nothing left for speculating that some of the resolutions
do canvass the interest of a community in particular. It is finding infirmity in the resolutions so
passed by the general body which according to the Commissioner professed the cause of a particular
religious community i.e. Christians that he put the petitioner on notice as according to him the
petitioner was not eligible for exclusion of the total income under Sections 11 and 12 of 'the Act' in
view of the provisions of Section 13(1)(b) of 'the Act' thus sufficient to invite a cancellation of the
registration of the petitioner granted under Section 12AA of 'the Act'. The exhaustive explanation
given by the petitioner to the show cause at Annexure 4 series is met with the order impugned dated
28.06. 2012 Annexure 5, which in fact is a reiteration of the observations present in the show cause
notice to conclude at paragraph 4 that since the activities of the petitioner-institution is for
furthering the interest of a religious community in particular i.e. Christians, it was not entitiled to a
registration under Section 12AA of 'the Act'. Surprisingly, even when the Commissioner has noted
that more than 95 % of the students admitted in the school are non Christians yet, according to him
it does not change the situation. In fact simply because in the Patna High Court MA No.438 of 2015
dt.13-08-2019 Board's meeting the association reiterated its emphasis on the undisputed fact that
being a catholic school run by the assessee association, the members of which are Christians, it has
concern towards the Christians of Patna, according to the Commissioner these aspects were
sufficient to make the school ineligible for the benefit under Sections 11 & 12 of 'the Act' in view of
the provisions of Section 13(1) (b) of 'the Act' and resultantly has led to the cancellation of the
registration which order has been affirmed by the Tribunal vide its order dated 22.07.2015.
While Section 11 deals with income from property held for charitable or religious purpose which
would not be included in the total income of the previous year of the person in receipt of such
income, Section 12 deals with the voluntarily contributions received by a trust created wholly for
charitable or religious purpose to be dealt in a like manner. Section 12A of 'the Act' lays down the
condition for applicability of Sections 11 and 12. Annexure 2 to the appeal is a confirmation of the
fact that the Commissioner of Income Tax on being satisfied that the petitioner was entitled to a
registration for exemption under Sections 11 and 12 of 'the Act' was granted registration under the
existing provisions of Section 12A(a) of 'the Act' on Patna High Court MA No.438 of 2015
dt.13-08-2019 26.04.1985 as a charitable institution thus, eligible for exemptions so provided under
'the Act'. Section 12AA was incorporated in the Act by the Finance (2) Act, 1996 laying down the
procedure for registration and Section 12AA (3) inter- alia laid down the procedure for cancellation
of such registration granted to any charitable institution under Section 12A of 'the Act' as it stood
before the amendment, under certain conditions which are eloquent from the provisions itself and is
reproduced herein below for ready reference :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/181079192/ 6
St. Michaels Educational Association ... vs Commissioner Of Income Tax I,Patna on 13 August, 2019
"(3) Where a trust or an institution has been granted registration under Clause (b) of
Sub-
Section 1 or has obtained a registration at any time under Section 12A as it stood before its
amendment by the Finance (No. 2) Act, (33 of 1996) and subsequently the Principal Commissioner
or Commissioner is satisfied that the activities of such trust or institution are not genuine or are not
being carried out in accordance with the objects of the trust or institution, as the case may be, he
shall pass an order in writing canceling the registration of such trust or institution;
Provided that no order under this sub-
section shall be passed unless such trust or institution has been given a reasonable opportunity of
being heard."
(Emphasis is supplied) Patna High Court MA No.438 of 2015 dt.13-08-2019 It is in purported
exercise under this provision that the show cause notice was issued to the petitioner and the order of
cancellation of registration has been passed.
A plain reading of the enabling power vested in the Commissioner as present in sub-section 3 of
Section 12AA would confirm that it is only in two circumstances that such power can be exercised by
the Principal Commissioner or the Commissioner and i.e (a) if the activities of such trust or
institution are not found genuine ; or (b) the activities of such trust or institution are not being
carried out in accordance with the objects of the trust or institution. The legislative intent of the
provision of sub-section 3 of Section 12AA is loud and clear and it is if and only if, the institution in
question is found violating either of the two conditions that the Principal Commissioner or the
Commissioner can exercise such power to cancel the registration and in no other circumstance.
In so far as the case in hand is concerned, it is bearing note of the aims and objects as present in the
memorandum of association which also contains the rules and regulations to regulate the activities
of the institution that the then Commissioner, on being satisfied, had granted registration to the
petitioner institution under the then existing provisions of Patna High Court MA No.438 of 2015
dt.13-08-2019 Section 12 A (a) of 'the Act' on 26.04.1985, which entitled the institution to the
benefits of such registration including those present in Section 11 and 12 of 'the Act'.
What we find from the show cause notice and the order of cancellation impugned in this appeal is
that it is the very same memorandum of association and the objects present therein which has laid
the foundation for the cancellation proceedings and since in some of the subsequent governing body
meetings some resolutions were passed in benefit of the Christian community, which has been
found sufficient for cancellation of the registration itself, without even a whisper on the mandatory
recording of satisfaction on the two essential prerequisites for such an order of cancellation i.e.
whether or not the resolution so passed demonstrated that the activities of the institution was not
genuine ; or whether the institution had violated its object. The show cause notice as well as the
order is absolutely silent on this score for there is no finding of any such violation by the petitioner
institution.

St. Michaels Educational Association ... vs Commissioner Of Income Tax I,Patna on 13 August, 2019
Law in this regard is too well settled and where a statute provides an act to be done in a particular
manner it has to be done in that manner alone and every other mode of discharge is clearly
forbidden. It is unfortunate that the statutory authorities, Patna High Court MA No.438 of 2015
dt.13-08-2019 performing quasi judicial functions have kept themselves oblivious of such settled
legal position. Applying the doctrine to the case in hand, it is seen that it is on being swayed by the
resolution of the governing body that the order of cancellation has been passed by the
Commissioner without recording any satisfaction, either on the issue that, the activities of the school
are not genuine and /or that it is not being carried out in accordance with the objects for which the
institution had been set up. In such eloquent circumstances we are in no confusion to hold that it is
only on fulfillment of such condition and on recording of satisfaction that an order of cancellation
could have been passed but which discharge is completely missing either in the show cause notice or
in the final order passed which has also got the confirmation by the tribunal.
A plain reading of the order impugned would confirm that the Commissioner has got mixed up in
between the stipulations warranting exercise under Section 12AA(3) and Section 13(1)
(b) in so far as it dis-entitles a trust or a charitable institution to the exclusion from the total income
of the previous year, any income, if the same is used for benefit of any particular religious
community or caste. It is correctly canvassed by Mr. Pathy that any such issue can be a subject
matter of assessment Patna High Court MA No.438 of 2015 dt.13-08-2019 proceeding but certainly
cannot lay a foundation for cancellation of registration of the institution altogether unless the two
prerequisites as present in sub-Section 3 of Section 12AA are satisfied.
Having considered the matter in its entirety we are in no doubt to hold that the order dated
22.07.2015 of the Tribunal in confirming the order dated 28.06.2012 of the Commissioner, Income
Tax to cancel the registration of the petitioner granted under Section 12AA of 'the Act' is an order
passed de-hors, the statutory provisions of Section 12AA(3) and since there is no satisfaction
recorded by the Commissioner Income Tax either that the activities of the petitioner was not
genuine or that it was not being carried in accordance with the objects for which it was set up, the
conclusion drawn by the authorities in the order impugned in reference to the provision of Section
13(1) (b), is a confirmation of perversity.
The substantial questions of law so framed, are answerred accordingly.
In result, the order dated 22.07.2015 of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal in ITA No. 141/Pat/ 2012
together with the order dated 28.06.2012 of the Commissioner, Income Tax in so far as it purports
to cancel the registration of the petitioner under Patna High Court MA No.438 of 2015
dt.13-08-2019 Section 12 AA of 'the Act' is quashed and set aside.
The Miscellaneous Appeal is allowed but with no order as to costs.
