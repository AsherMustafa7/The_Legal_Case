iv) For issuance of writ in the nature of mandamus or any other appropriate writ for directing the
respondent to pass a reasoned order on the objection filed by the petitioner under section 9 of the
Bihar and Orissa Public Patna High Court CWJC No.13512 of 2017 dt.26-09-2025 Demand Recovery
Act, 1914 (hereinafter refer as 'Act' only) as the petitioner has raised several objections including
maintainability of the certificate case as well as demand.
v) For issuance of any other writ, order or direction which your Lordships may deem fit and proper
in the facts and circumstances of the case."
2. At the very outset, Learned Senior counsel for the petitioner contended that since this matter is
squarely covered under the order passed by a Division Bench of this Court in the case of The
Certificate Officer of Siwan Central Co- operative Bank -Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors. reported in
(2006) 2 PLJR 176, this writ petition may also be disposed of on the same terms and conditions.
3. In The Certificate Officer of Siwan Central Co-operative Bank (supra) their Lordships have held as
follows:
"6. It is noticed by us that the Patna High Court CWJC No.13512 of 2017
dt.26-09-2025 action of the appellant for the recovery of the alleged amount of
defalcation under the provisions of the Bihar Public Demands Recovery Act cannot
be justified in absence of any due and payable amount to the Bank in terms of the
provision of the agreement or under the provisions of the aforesaid Acts. The
observations made by the learned Single Judge in latter part in paragraph 4 of the
impugned judgment are quite weighty and cannot be dislodged in course of the
submissions before us.
7. A certificate proceeding contemplated under law proceeded on the premise that
there is money due and payable either in terms of the agreement or contract or under
the provisions of law. Mere an allegation of the Bank with regard to the defalcation by
the employee in course of the period of his service would not tantamount "Ipso
Facto" that the amount due was legally payable to the Bank by the person against
whom such allegations are made. It is in this context, there would not arise any
question of grant of a certificate and resultant recovery thereof under the provisions
of the said Acts.

8. This Court in Murlidhar Sohanlal v. State of Bihar, 1998 (3) Patna Law Journal
Reports 526, had an occasion to deal with similar situation and upon evaluation of
the relevant provisions of law and similar facts situation has held that the
Corporation, in the present case Bank, can avail the remedy of certificate proceeding
treating it to be a public demand provided the person liable to pay the same has
agreed by a written instrument that it shall be recoverable as a public demand. Apart
from the fact that there is no such agreement and there is mere allegation of

Lal Babu Ram vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 26 September, 2025
defalcation of the aforesaid amount by the employee of the Bank, the proposition of
law enunciated in the said judgment in the said case by this Court, after examining
and appreciating the provision of Section 9 read with Item No. 15 of Schedule I of
Bihar and Orissa Public Demands Recovery Act, 1914, would directly cover the facts
of the present case and, therefore, the appeal on hand is without any substance and
merit and deserves to be dismissed at the threshold.
9. Accordingly, this appeal shall stand dismissed with costs."
Patna High Court CWJC No.13512 of 2017 dt.26-09-2025
4. Having regard to the submissions made by the parties, the present writ petition stands disposed
of in terms of the aforesaid judgment passed in The Certificate Officer of Siwan Central Co-operative
Bank (supra).
5. Interlocutory Application, if any, shall stands disposed of.
