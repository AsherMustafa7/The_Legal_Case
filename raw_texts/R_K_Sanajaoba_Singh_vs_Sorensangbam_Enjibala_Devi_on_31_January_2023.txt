COMMON JUDGMENT AND ORDER (CAV)
[1] These three second appeals arise out of the common judgment dated
31.05.2017 of the learned District Judge, Imphal West, in First Civil Appeal Nos. 23 and 24 of 2016.
Thereby, the learned District Judge reversed the common judgment dated 18.08.2016 of the learned
Civil Judge (Senior Division), Imphal West, in Original Suit No.21 of 2011/46/12 and Original Suit
No.28 of 2011/44/12/415/13. [2] Original Suit No.21 of 2011 was filed by Sorensangbam Enjibala
Devi against R.K.Sanajaoba Singh seeking a declaration that she was the owner of the suit-land by
virtue of the sale deed dated 26.07.2010 (Ex.A3/Ex.B4) executed in her favour by R.K.Sanajaoba
Singh, which was registered by the office of the Sub-Registrar, Porompat. In the alternative, if no
title had passed to her under the said registered sale deed due to lack of territorial jurisdiction of the
Sub-Registrar, Porompat, she sought a declaration that R.K.Sanajaoba Singh had sold the suit-land
to her by executing the sale deed on 26.07.2010 and to direct the Sub-Registrar, Wangoi, Imphal
West District, to register the sale deed. In consequence, she sought eviction of R.K.Sanajaoba Singh
from the suit-land by demolition of the structures standing thereon and for delivery of the suit-land
to her. Lastly, she sought a perpetual injunction, restraining R.K.Sanajaoba Singh and RSA Nos.12 &
13 of 2017 & RSA No.02 of 2018 Page 2 his men from entering into the suit-land, and the costs of the
litigation. The suit-land comprised the homestead measuring an area of 0.17 acre covered by
C.S.Dag No.536 /877 under Patta No.383/729 of Revenue Village No.68-Naorem Leikai, Imphal
West District, of which a portion measuring 0.025 acre had been acquired by the State Government
for widening National Highway No.39. [3] Original Suit No.28 of 2011 was filed by R.K.Sanajaoba
Singh against Sorensangbam Enjibala Devi seeking a declaration that the sale deed bearing
Document No.1347(V) of 2010 dated 30.07.2010 (Ex.A3/Ex.B4) of the Sub-Registrar, Porompat,
Imphal East District, was null, void and non-est in the eye of law. Further, he sought a declaration
that the illegal mutation of the name of Sorensangbam Enjibala Devi in respect of the suit-land was
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172234429/ 2
R.K.Sanajaoba Singh vs Sorensangbam Enjibala Devi on 31 January, 2023
void and sought a consequential direction to restore his name in respect thereof. He also sought
costs. Trite to state, the suit-land in O.S. No.28 of 2011 was the same as the suit-land in O.S. No.21
of 2011. R.K.Sanajaoba Singh also raised a counter-claim in O.S. No 21 of 2011 seeking certain
reliefs, which shall be referred to in detail hereinafter. [4] Evidence was recorded by the Trial Court
in O.S. No. 28 of 2011 filed by R.K.Sanajaoba Singh. His witnesses were accordingly titled PWs and
his documentary evidence was numbered as 'A' series. Sorensangbam Enjibala Devi's witnesses were
titled DWs and her documents were numbered with 'B' series. The Trial Court thereupon dismissed
O.S. No. 21 of 2011 filed by Sorensangbam Enjibala Devi and partly decreed O.S. No.28 of 2011 and
the counter-claim filed by R.K.Sanajaoba Singh. In appeal, the First Appellate Court partly decreed
O.S. No. 21 of 2011 filed by Sorensangbam Enjibala Devi and dismissed O.S. No.28 of 2011 filed by
R.K.Sanajaoba Singh. Hence, these second appeals by both parties.
RSA Nos.12 & 13 of 2017 &
RSA No.02 of 2018 Page 3
[5] On 10.04.2019, this Court framed the following substantial questions of
law for consideration in RSA Nos.12 and 13 of 2017 filed by R.K.Sanajaoba Singh:
(a) "Whether the defects of Registration of Sale Deed bearing Registration No.1347
(v) of 2010 dated 30.07.2010 of the Sub-
Registrar, Porompat, Imphal East District, Manipur, for want of territorial jurisdiction is curable or
not?
(b) Whether the First Appellate Court even after giving his decision that the Registered Sale Deed
(Ext.B/4) has no legal validity as of now being registered beyond its jurisdiction. Can he direct
improper direction which is not in issue?
(c) Whether Regd. Sale Deed (Ext.A/3 or Ext.B/4) of the Sub-Registrar, Porompat, Imphal East,
Manipur, can be re-registration or not under Section 23-A of the Registration Act?
(d) Whether the First Appellate Court has power and jurisdiction to interfere Government policy
about the Fixation of Minimum Guidance Value of Land, being Government Order
No.2/1/SR/2007- Commissioner (Revenue) dated 20.03.2012 for registration?"
On the same day, the substantial question of law arising for consideration in RSA
No.2 of 2018, filed by Sorensangbam Enjibala Devi, was framed thus:
"Whether failure to pass order to evict the Respondent from the suit land by the
District Jude in the impugned Judgment and decree despite its direction to
Sub-Registrar, Wangoi to register that sale deed with its clear finding that the
Respondents had execute sale deed transferring the Suit to the Appellant and that the
Respondent has been possessing the suit as permissive possessor or the Appellant is

R.K.Sanajaoba Singh vs Sorensangbam Enjibala Devi on 31 January, 2023
sustainable or not."
Though the above steps were taken in these second appeals, a formal order of admission was not
passed in any of them but they were directed to be listed for final hearing. The appeals are
accordingly admitted and taken up for consideration on the substantial questions of law framed
earlier. [6] Heard Mr. Th.Tolpishak, learned counsel for the appellant in RSA Nos. 12 and 13 of 2017
and the respondent in RSA No.2 of 2018; and Mr. Th.Modhu, learned counsel for the appellant in
RSA No.2 of 2018 and the respondent in RSA RSA Nos.12 & 13 of 2017 & RSA No.02 of 2018 Page 4
Nos.12 and 13 of 2017. Both the learned counsel state that the questions of law already framed are
sufficient and there is no necessity to frame any additional questions of law in exercise of power
under the proviso to Section 100 (5) CPC.
[7] Parties shall hereinafter be referred to by name.
[8] The plaint averments in O.S. No.21 of 2011 were as follows: To meet his
urgent need for money, Sanajaoba Singh verbally agreed to sell the suit-land to Enjibala Devi for the
sale consideration of `25 lakh with the condition that necessary stamp duty and registration fees etc.
would be borne by him. He however stated that if the actual consideration amount was disclosed in
the sale deed, the stamp value to be paid by him would be in the range of `1,75,000/- and to avoid
the same, he wanted to mention the sale consideration in the document as `1 lakh, by executing two
money receipts - one for `24 lakh and another for `1 lakh, so as to save expenses. He further
informed her that he would bring the concerned registration officials to the school where Enjibala
Devi worked so that she need not go to the registration office. She agreed to all the suggestions made
by him and accordingly, the document was prepared and registered on 30.07.2010 at the school,
where the officials of the registration office came to do the needful. She further stated that the sale
deed was executed after the whole consideration amount of `25 lakh was given by her to Sanajaoba
Singh in the presence of witnesses and upon his acknowledgment thereof by executing two money
receipts dated 26.07.2010 (Exs.B2 & B3). Pursuant to the registration of the document, her name
was mutated in the relevant records. Thereafter, a portion of the land sold, being an extent of 0.025
acre, was acquired by the State of Manipur for widening National Highway No.39. The S.D.C.,
Lilong Chajing, Imphal West, issued RSA Nos.12 & 13 of 2017 & RSA No.02 of 2018 Page 5
landowner certificate dated 24.09.2010 in favour of Enjibala Devi and she received the
compensation therefor as the owner of the acquired land. It was her case that, though Sanajaoba
Singh sold her the suit-land with structures, duly recording formal delivery of possession to her, he
verbally requested her to allow him to remain in the suit-land for six months with his family
members and that he would vacate the land thereafter. She claimed that she accepted his request on
humanitarian grounds and allowed him to remain as a permissive possessor. She stated that, she
then received a summons from the Revenue Tribunal, Manipur, and came to know that Sanajaoba
Singh had challenged the mutation carried out in her favour by the revenue authorities, by filing
Revenue Revision Case No.27 of 2010 (Ex.B16). Upon reading the said revision petition, she came to
know for the first time that the registration of the sale deed was done by the Sub-Registrar,
Porompat, and not by the Sub-Registrar, Wangoi, within whose jurisdiction the suit-land was
situated. The Revenue Tribunal dismissed Revenue Revision Case No.27 of 2010 on 20.12.2010
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172234429/ 4
R.K.Sanajaoba Singh vs Sorensangbam Enjibala Devi on 31 January, 2023
(Ex.A7/Ex.B7). She made inquiries with the Sub-Registrar, Porompat, about the legality of the sale
deed registered by his office and he informed her vide letter dated 03.11.2010 (Ex.B8) that there was
nothing wrong and that he had intimated the factum of registration to the Sub-Registrar, Wangoi.
She stated that, by way of abundant caution, she presented the sale deed for registration in the office
of the Sub-Registrar, Wangoi, but he refused to register the document under letter dated 19.01.2011
(Ex.B6), opining that registering the said document would amount to double registration and unless
the earlier registration was cancelled, he could not undertake fresh registration. Aggrieved thereby,
Enjibala Devi filed Appeal (Registration) Case No.1 of 2011 before the Registrar, Imphal West
District. Enjibala RSA Nos.12 & 13 of 2017 & RSA No.02 of 2018 Page 6 Devi then stated that, by
taking advantage of his being in actual possession of the suit-land, Sanajaoba Singh attempted to
construct structures thereon. She got addressed a legal notice to him on 17.03.2011 calling upon him
to refrain from raising structures. He, however, undertook construction activity on a war-footing
and changed the structures that were in existence at the time the sale deed was executed. Enjibala
Devi then filed W.P(C) No.298 of 2011 before the Imphal Bench of the Gauhati High Court in
relation to the appeal pending before the Registrar, Imphal West District, and the said writ petition
was disposed of on 23.06.2011, directing the Registrar, Imphal West District, to dispose of the
appeal within a time frame. Enjibala Devi then adverted to the stand of Sanajaoba Singh that he had
only borrowed a sum of `1 lakh from her by mortgaging a portion of the suit-land, i.e., the land
excluding the acquired portion, and executed a mortgage deed but he thereafter found out that it
was a sale deed transferring the entire suit-land. He further claimed that the said sale deed was
registered by the office of the Sub-Registrar, Porompat, who had no territorial jurisdiction. As this
stand taken by Sanajaoba Singh put a cloud on her right and title over the suit-land, she prayed for
the suit reliefs set out hereinbefore.
[9] Original Suit No.28 of 2011 was filed by Sanajaoba Singh with the following averments: He was
the owner of the suit-land but claimed that he got his name recorded only for making it a security
for obtaining loans from banks as well as private persons. According to him, his mother was the real
owner of the suit-land and she had never formally transferred the same to him. He stated that in
July, 2010, he was in need of money and asked Enjibala Devi to lend him `1 lakh with interest
thereon at 12% per annum. He claimed that, on 26.07.2010, Enjibala RSA Nos.12 & 13 of 2017 &
RSA No.02 of 2018 Page 7 Devi called him to the Temple of Learning School, Naorem Leikai,
Imphal West District, to collect the said amount and when he went there, he found some unknown
persons. According to him, these unknown persons prepared a katcha agreement for mortgaging the
suit-land and he received a sum of `1 lakh only from Enjibala Devi and went back. He claimed that it
was only on 26.09.2010 that he came to know that the agreement prepared on 26.07.2010 was a sale
deed, which was prepared fraudulently without his knowledge and consent. He stated that Enjibala
Devi got her name mutated in relation to the suit-land under Mutation Order dated 02.08.2010
passed in Mutation Case No.145 of 2010 on the file of the S.D.C., Lilong Chajing. He stated that the
fraudulent sale deed was registered by the office of the Sub-Registrar, Porompat, with Document
No.1347(V) of 2010, but the suit-land did not lie within the jurisdiction of the Sub-Registrar,
Porompat, and was situated in the jurisdiction of the Sub-Registrar, Wangoi. He stated that he filed
Revenue Revision Case No.27 of 2010 before the Revenue Tribunal, Manipur, against Mutation
Order dated 02.08.2010 but, on technical grounds, it was dismissed on 20.12.2010 (Ex.A7/Ex.B7).
Admitting the subsequent sequence of events, as set out by Enjibala Devi in her suit, he stated that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172234429/ 5
R.K.Sanajaoba Singh vs Sorensangbam Enjibala Devi on 31 January, 2023
the Registrar, Imphal West, disposed of Appeal (Registration) No.1 of 2011 on 04.08.2011 (Ex.A4),
observing that he had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal and directed the parties to approach
the competent authority. He further stated that he was ready to repay the borrowed amount of `1
lakh with reasonable interest but Enjibala Devi had received `10,82,806/- towards compensation
for the land acquired out of the suit-land and, therefore, the amount to be returned by him had to be
adjusted against the same. He further stated that a pucca building had been constructed by RSA
Nos.12 & 13 of 2017 & RSA No.02 of 2018 Page 8 him in the suit-land, wherein he and his family
members were dwelling continuously and without disturbance. He accordingly prayed for the reliefs
set out supra.
By way of his counter-claim in O.S. No. 21 of 2011, Sanajaoba Singh prayed for a declaration that the
Receipt dated 26.07.2010 in respect of the sum of `24 lakh (Ex.B3) allegedly executed by him in
favour of Enjibala Devi was a forged document and was not binding on him. He also sought a
declaration that the drawal of `10,82,806/- by Enjibala Devi was illegal and a declaration that all the
documents/ agreement/undertaking in the possession of Enjibala Devi, relatable to the suit-land or
transfer of the suit-land, were all false and forged and not binding on him. Lastly, he sought an
injunction restraining Enjibala Devi from entering into the suit-land.
[10] To disprove Sanajaoba Singh's claim that he was not the owner of the suit-land, Enjibala Devi
got marked the registered gift deed bearing Document No. 3429 dated 03.06.2006 (Ex.B9), whereby
his mother had gifted him the suit-land. [11] Common issues were framed on 22.02.2013 in the suits
and the counter-claim. The issues framed read as follows: -
"1. Whether the plaintiff had executed a deed of sale transferring the suit land with all
the structures standing thereon to plaintiff, if so, whether the consideration amount
was `25,00,000/- (Rupees twenty- five lacs) only?
2. Whether the plaintiff had mortgaged the suit land to the plaintiff for taking loan of
`1,00,000/- (Rupees one lac) only, if so, whether the plaintiff had obtained the
signatures of the defendant in the deed of sale fraudulently?
3. Whether the plaintiff has been possessing the suit land as permissive possession or
not?
4. Whether the deed dated 26.7.2010 registered in the Sub-Registrar, Porompat has
its validity or not?
5. Is there any cause of action?
6. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the reliefs claimed?

R.K.Sanajaoba Singh vs Sorensangbam Enjibala Devi on 31 January, 2023
(The plaintiff mentioned in the issues is R.K.Sanajaoba Singh and whereas the
defendant is Sorensangbam Enjibala Devi.)"
[12] Sanajaoba Singh examined himself as PW-1 and his two maternal uncles as PW-2 and PW-3. He
marked 5 documents in evidence. Enjibala Devi examined herself as DW-1. Her younger brother was
examined as DW-2. He was one of the attestors of the Sale Deed dated 26.07.2010 (Ex.A3/Ex.B4).
She also got examined an Advocate, who was one of the attestors of the money receipts for `1 lakh
and `24 lakh (Exs.B2 & B3), as DW-3. This witness stated that Sanajaoba Singh put his signatures in
the sale deed in his presence but he was not the attestor thereof. DW-4 was the deed-cum-petition
writer attached to the office of the Sub-Registrar, Porompat, Imphal East, and he stated that he had
drafted ExA3/Ex.B4 Sale Deed. Enjibala Devi got marked in evidence 15 documents.
[13] Upon considering the rival pleadings and the evidence on record, the learned Civil Judge
(Senior Division), Imphal West, held that Enjibala Devi failed to prove the execution of the sale deed
and transfer of the suit-land to her, with structures standing thereon, for a consideration of `25
lakh. Further, the learned Civil Judge held that Sanajaoba Singh had failed to prove that he had
mortgaged the suit-land to Enjibala Devi for taking a loan of `1 lakh and that she had obtained his
signatures in the sale deed fraudulently. Issue Nos. 1 and 2 were answered accordingly. As regards
Issue No.3, the learned Civil Judge noted that, as Enjibala Devi had failed to prove execution of the
sale deed, her prayer for eviction of Sanajaoba Singh from the suit-land could not be acted upon, by
treating him as a permissive possessor. Issue No.3 was therefore answered against her. Lastly, the
learned Civil Judge held that the Sale Deed dated 26.07.2010 (Ex.A3/Ex.B4) was RSA Nos.12 & 13 of
2017 & RSA No.02 of 2018 Page 10 not admissible in evidence and had no evidentiary value as it was
bad in law. In this regard, reference was made by the learned Civil Judge to Section 87 of the
Registration Act, 1908, which dealt with defects of procedure and provided that a defect in respect of
jurisdiction, as opposed to one of procedure, is not curable. Issue No.4 was answered accordingly.
The learned Civil Judge went on to note that as Issue Nos.1, 3 and 4 had been decided against
Enjibala Devi and as Issue No.2 was answered against Sanajaoba Singh, there was no cause of action
for the suits filed by both of them, including the counter-claim, except for holding in favour of
Sanajaoba Singh that the Sale Deed (Ex.A3/Ex.B4) was not admissible in evidence and had no value,
as it was bad in law. The learned Civil Judge went on to state that the suit filed by Enjibala Devi was
bad for non-joinder of necessary parties as the State of Manipur and the Registration authorities
were not impleaded though a direction had been sought by her to the Sub-Registrar, Wangoi, to
register the document. Accordingly, by his common judgment dated 18.08.2016, the learned Civil
Judge dismissed the suit filed by Enjibala Devi and partly decreed the suit and counter-claim filed
by Sanajaoba Singh.
[14] Aggrieved by the dismissal of her suit and the part-decretal of the suit filed by Sanajaoba Singh,
Enjibala Devi filed First Civil Appeal Nos.23 and 24 of 2016 before the learned District Judge,
Imphal West. First Civil Appeal No.23 of 2016 related to O.S. No.21 of 2011 filed by her, while First
Civil Appeal No.24 of 2016 pertained to O.S. No.28 of 2011 filed by Sanajaoba Singh. [15] The
learned District Judge, Imphal West, did not frame separate points for determination in the appeals
but considered the issues already framed by the learned Civil Judge (Senior Division), Imphal West.
Thereupon, by his reversing RSA Nos.12 & 13 of 2017 & RSA No.02 of 2018 Page 11 common
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172234429/ 7
R.K.Sanajaoba Singh vs Sorensangbam Enjibala Devi on 31 January, 2023
judgment dated 31.05.2017, the learned District Judge granted relief to Enjibala Devi. The learned
District Judge found, on facts, that Enjibala Devi had proved the execution of the sale deed in her
favour by Sanajaoba Singh on 26.07.2010 and that the two money receipts for `1 lakh and `24 lakh
(Ex.B2 & Ex.B3) were also executed by Sanajaoba Singh. However, the learned District Judge held
that Enjibala Devi could not claim the sale consideration to be `25 lakh, contrary to the statement
made in the sale deed that the sale consideration was `1 lakh, in the light of Section 92 of the
Evidence Act, 1872. The learned District Judge held that Sanajaoba Singh had failed to establish that
the Sale Deed (Ex.A3/Ex.B.4) was an intended mortgage deed for borrowing a sum of `1 lakh and,
on the other hand, Enjibala Devi had proved that she purchased the suit-land from him at `1 lakh
but failed to prove that the sale consideration therefor was `25 lakh. [16] The learned District Judge
noted that the learned Civil Judge (Senior Division), Imphal West, had wrongly discussed the
legality of the Sale Deed (Ex.A3/Ex.B4) while deciding Issue Nos.1 and 2, as a separate issue, viz.,
Issue No.4, had been framed with regard to the validity of Ex.A3/Ex.B4 Sale Deed. Further, the
learned District Judge found that there was a recital in the said sale deed that Sanajaoba Singh
delivered possession of the suit-land to Enjibala Devi, the vendee, and that Enjibala Devi, in her
deposition, had stated that Sanajaoba Singh requested her to allow him and his family members to
remain in the suit-land for six months and that she had permitted the same on humanitarian
grounds. As the statement made by her was not subjected to effective cross-examination, the learned
District Judge held that Sanajaoba Singh was in permissive possession of the suit-land.
RSA Nos.12 & 13 of 2017 &
RSA No.02 of 2018 Page 12
[17] As regards the validity of Ex.A3/Ex.B4 Sale Deed, arising for
consideration under Issue No.4, the learned District Judge noted that the suit-land was situated in
Imphal West District under the territorial jurisdiction of the Sub- Registrar, Wangoi, and as per
Section 28 of the Registration Act, 1908, the sale deed ought not to have been registered by the
office of the Sub-Registrar, Porompat, Imphal East District. The learned District Judge noted that,
as per Enjibala Devi, the registration of the sale deed by the Sub-Registrar, Porompat, was at the
instance of Sanajaoba Singh himself and, therefore, he could not claim the benefit of his own wrong.
[18] The learned District Judge took note of the sequence of events culled out from the pleadings
and evidence and observed that in the light of the law laid down by the Supreme Court in Maria
Margarida Sequeira Fernandes and others vs. Erasmo Jack de Sequeria (Dead) through LRs [(2012)
5 SCC 370], truth is the foundation of justice and the endeavor of Judges should be to ascertain the
truth and leave no stone unturned in achieving this objective. The learned District Judge noted that
execution of Ex.A3/Ex.B4 Sale Deed was duly proved by Enjibala Devi and the claim of Sanajaoba
Singh that the said document was intended to be a mortgage deed was not proved by him, but
despite execution of the sale deed, it proved to have no legal validity for want of the territorial
jurisdiction of the registering authority. The learned District Judge, therefore, opined that the
Sub-Registrar, Wangoi, Imphal West District, would have ample jurisdiction to consider
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172234429/ 8
R.K.Sanajaoba Singh vs Sorensangbam Enjibala Devi on 31 January, 2023
're-registration' of the sale deed by borrowing the ratio laid down under Section 23 A of the
Registration Act, 1908, and other provisions thereof. The learned District Judge accordingly allowed
the appeals filed by Enjibala Devi in part and set RSA Nos.12 & 13 of 2017 & RSA No.02 of 2018
Page 13 aside the common judgment dated 18.08.2016 passed by the learned Civil Judge (Senior
Division), Imphal West. The suit filed by Sanajaoba Singh was dismissed and the suit filed by
Enjibala Devi was partly decreed, directing the Sub-Registrar, Wangoi, to re-consider the
registration of the Sale Deed dated 26.07.2010 as per the provisions of the Registration Act, 1908,
on the basis of the letter of the Sub-Registrar, Porompat, and on the application of Enjibala Devi.
[19] At the outset, it may be noted that the finding of the learned Civil Judge (Senior Division),
Imphal West, that Enjibala Devi's suit was bad for non-joinder of the State of Manipur and its
registering authority, as they were proper and necessary parties, cannot be countenanced. It is not
as if the State of Manipur and its registering authorities have any role to play in the litigation, as the
dispute was purely between Enjibala Devi and Sanajaoba Singh. It is only implementation of the
decree of the Court, if any, which would bring in the registering authorities of the State of Manipur.
In such a situation, it was not required that they should be made parties to the suit filed by Enjibala
Devi. They were neither proper nor necessary parties thereto and their non-joinder had no
consequence whatsoever. Be it noted that in a suit for specific performance also, the registering
authority would not be made a party but the direction given under the provisions of the Specific
Relief Act, 1963, would require the jurisdictional registering authority to register the document if the
suit for specific performance is decreed.
[20] Further, Mr. Th.Tolpishak, learned counsel, appearing for Sanajaoba Singh, would contend
that Enjibala Devi's suit seeking a direction to the Sub- Registrar, Wangoi, to register the document
would be barred by Section 77 of the Registration Act, 1908. He would point out that such a suit had
to be filed within RSA Nos.12 & 13 of 2017 & RSA No.02 of 2018 Page 14 thirty days from the date of
refusal of registration but, in the case on hand, the suit was filed by Enjibala Devi beyond that time.
This argument, however, lacks substance. It is an admitted fact that upon refusal by the
Sub-Registrar, Wangoi, under his letter dated 19.01.2011, to register the sale deed on the ground
that it would amount to re-registration, an appeal was preferred by Enjibala Devi before the District
Registrar, Imphal West, and the same was rejected only on 04.08.2011, i.e., after institution of O.S.
No.21 of 2011 by Enjibala Devi on 28.07.2011. There was, thus, no delay on her part in terms of
Section 77 of the Registration Act, 1908. [21] On merits, Mr. Th.Tolpishak, learned counsel, would
contend that the defect in the registration of the Sale Deed dated 26.07.2010 (Ex.A3/Ex.B4) was
fatal and incurable and, therefore, the learned District Judge, Imphal West, erred in directing its
're-registration' by the Sub-Registrar, Wangoi. He would assert that Section 23 A of the Registration
Act, 1908, had no application to the fact-situation and, therefore, the analogy drawn by the learned
District Judge, Imphal West, is unsustainable. He would further contend that the direction of the
learned District Judge, Imphal West, to 're-register' the document would run contrary to the policy
of the Government of Manipur with regard to fixation of minimum land values, as per the
Government Order dated 20.03.2012.
[22] Per contra, Mr. Th.Modhu, learned counsel, appearing for Enjibala Devi, would argue that the
learned District Judge, Imphal West, had directed registration of the sale deed afresh as the earlier
registration had no validity in the eye of law and, therefore, the word 're-registration' is a misnomer
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172234429/ 9
R.K.Sanajaoba Singh vs Sorensangbam Enjibala Devi on 31 January, 2023
and had no application. He would point out that, in terms of the suit prayer of Enjibala Devi in O.S.
No.21 of 2011, if the Court found that no title had passed to her under the registered Sale RSA
Nos.12 & 13 of 2017 & RSA No.02 of 2018 Page 15 Deed dated 26.07.2010 (Ex.A3/Ex.B4) owing to
lack of territorial jurisdiction of the Sub-Registrar, Porompat, she sought a declaration that
Sanajaoba Singh had sold the land to her by executing the said sale deed and to direct the
Sub-Registrar, Wangoi, Imphal West, to register the said document. He would, therefore, assert that
this prayer practically amounted to seeking specific performance by Sanajaoba Singh, in the event
the earlier registered document executed by him conveying title to her was found to be lacking
validity in the eye of law owing to the lack of territorial jurisdiction of the registering authority.
[23] At this stage, it may be noted that the Trial Court as well as the First Appellate Court held that
Sanajaoba Singh had failed to prove that the document executed by him on 26.07.2010 was
intended to be a mortgage deed. On the other hand, all the witnesses examined by Enjibala Devi,
who were present at the time of its registration, clearly spoke in support of her claim that the
document that was registered on that day was a sale deed. Thus, execution of the sale deed not being
in doubt and as this Court would not review that factual finding under Section 100 CPC, the main
issue that falls for consideration in second appellate jurisdiction is as to what follows from the
finding of both the Courts below that the registered sale deed had no validity in the eye of law, for
want of territorial jurisdiction of the registering authority, viz., the Sub-Registrar, Porompat, Imphal
East. [24] In this regard, the learned Civil Judge (Senior Division), Imphal West, altogether lost
sight of the suit prayer of Enjibala Devi, referred to supra, which was practically on the lines of
seeking specific performance, if Ex.A3/Ex.B4 Sale Deed was found defective and if no title had
passed to her thereunder owing to lack of territorial jurisdiction of the Sub-Registrar, Porompat.
This prayer was taken note RSA Nos.12 & 13 of 2017 & RSA No.02 of 2018 Page 16 of by the learned
District Judge, Imphal West, in first appellate jurisdiction and, in consequence, the relief was
moulded by directing registration of the said sale deed afresh by the Sub-Registrar, Wangoi, who
was the proper registering authority in terms of territorial jurisdiction, under Section 28 of the
Registration Act, 1908. [25] Be it noted that Section 28 of the Registration Act, 1908, puts it beyond
the pale of doubt that it is only the registering authority who has jurisdiction over the area, wherein
the land which is the subject matter of the document is situated, who would have proper authority to
register such a document. It may also be noted that Rule 64 of the Manipur Registration Rules,
1959, provides that if a document has not been presented to the proper office, it should be returned
to the presenter. Therefore, the Sub-Registrar, Porompat, ought not to have entertained the subject
sale deed and registered it, without first examining whether he had the territorial jurisdiction, under
Section 28 of the Registration Act, 1908, to deal with it. Reference in this regard may be made to
Dottie Karan and others vs. Lachmi Prasad Sinha and others [AIR 1931 PC 52], wherein the Privy
Council pointed out that Section 87 of the Registration Act, 1908, dealt with the defects of procedure
but if the defect is one of jurisdiction, as opposed to one of procedure, then it would not be curable.
Following this edict in Seth Suganmal and others vs. Mt. Umraobi w/o. Abdul Hannan and others
[AIR 1938 Nagpur 550], the Nagpur High Court observed that registration, to be effective, must be
in accordance with the provisions of the Registration Act, 1908, and if the defect is not curable as a
defect of procedure under Section 87 thereof, then the document cannot be used for any purpose
specified in Section 49. In Prasad and others vs. V.Govindaswami Mudaliar and others (AIR 1982
SC 84), the Supreme Court RSA Nos.12 & 13 of 2017 & RSA No.02 of 2018 Page 17 found, on facts,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172234429/ 10
R.K.Sanajaoba Singh vs Sorensangbam Enjibala Devi on 31 January, 2023
that a sale deed had been executed only nominally and for a collateral purpose, with a view to stave
off creditors and with the express understanding that the property sold would be reconveyed to the
vendors after the pressure of the creditors subsided. In this situation, the Supreme Court held that
there was no question of giving any equities to the vendee even if some of the amounts paid to the
creditors were genuine. As the transaction of sale was vitiated, per the Supreme Court, no relief in
equity could be granted to the vendees. This decision has no relevance presently, as this Court is in
agreement with the findings of the First Appellate Court, the last Court on facts, that the Sale Deed
dated 26.07.2010 (Ex.A3/Ex.B4) was executed by Sanajaoba Singh in the circumstances claimed by
Enjibala Devi, duly supported by the testimonies of witnesses, and the said transaction, by itself, did
not stand vitiated in law. Similarly, the decision in Chironjilal vs. Bhura and others, [AIR 1981 NOC
94 (Madhya Pradesh)], relied upon by Mr. Th.Tolpishak is of no avail to him, as that was also a case
where the finding of the Court was that the parties did not intend the document to be operative as a
sale deed, unlike the case on hand.
[26] Section 23A of the Registration Act, 1908, on the other hand, refers to a document which is
registered correctly by the authorized territorial registering authority, who thereafter finds that the
person who presented the document for registration lacked the authorization to do so. In such an
event, re-registration of the document at the behest of the proper presenter is permitted under this
provision. As rightly contended by Mr. Th.Tolpishak, learned counsel, Section 23A would have no
application to a defective registration falling foul of Section 28 of the Registration Act, 1908, and
such a defect cannot be cured.
RSA Nos.12 & 13 of 2017 &
RSA No.02 of 2018 Page 18
[27] It is no doubt true that the learned District Judge, Imphal West, used
the word 're-registration' in his judgment, but as pointed out by Mr. Th.Modhu, learned counsel,
once the finding of both the Courts was that the very registration of the document by the
Sub-Registrar, Porompat, had no validity in the eye of law, the question of 're-registering' the
document would not arise. Merely because the said document was erroneously registered by a
registering authority who had no jurisdiction to do so, it cannot logically mean that the transaction
under the said document, even if proved, would have to be nullified. In such a situation, it would be
for the proper registering authority to make an endorsement on the said document that registration
is being carried out afresh in such circumstances. Such a registration would not amount to
're-registration' in the eye of law or in terms of Section 23A of the Registration Act, 1908.
[28] Mr. Th.Tolpishak, learned counsel, would further contend that the direction of the learned
District Judge, Imphal West, to the Sub-Registrar, Wangoi, to straightway register the Sale Deed
(Ex.A3/Ex.B4) dated 26.07.2010 would run contrary to the Government's policy, which was put in
place in the year 2012, with regard to valuation of lands for the purpose of stamp duty. A copy of the
Order dated 20.03.2012 issued by the Revenue Department, Government of Manipur, is placed on
record. Thereby, the Commissioner (Revenue), Government of Manipur, took note of the substantial
increase of values and utility of lands in urban and rural areas in the State and thought it
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172234429/ 11
R.K.Sanajaoba Singh vs Sorensangbam Enjibala Devi on 31 January, 2023
appropriate to determine and fix minimum values for different categories of land in Manipur, and
particularly, in the urban areas and District Headquarters of the State, with a view to prevent the
practice of under- valuation of land in land transactions and directed that, after enforcement of the
RSA Nos.12 & 13 of 2017 & RSA No.02 of 2018 Page 19 said order, the valuation of lands in land
transaction should be either at a higher rate than or at a rate not less than the prescribed minimum
guidance value for the specified category/utilization of land. This order came into force from
01.04.2012. In effect, it had no application at the time of execution of Ex.A3/Ex.B4 Sale Deed on
26.07.2010 and at that point of time, admittedly, it was within the discretion of the executants of the
document to fix the valuation of the land that was the subject matter of the document for the
purpose of determining the stamp duty payable thereon. Reference may be made to the law laid
down by the Imphal Bench of the Gauhati High Court in Smt.Sagolsem Ongbi Jamini Devi vs. The
State of Manipur & others [W.P(C) No.823 of 2001 decided on 16.08.2001], wherein it was observed
that a document for sale of land under the Transfer of Property Act would be executed upon
payment of consideration as the price of the land and the amount of the sale consideration is fixed
by the parties. The Court observed that in the absence of any law to the contrary, the amount fixed
by the parties as the price of the land could not be interfered with. It is in this context that a finding
was rendered by the learned District Judge, Imphal West, that Enjibala Devi could not claim the sale
consideration under Ex.A3/Ex.B4 Sale Deed dated 26.07.2010 to be `25 lakh, contrary to the recital
therein that the sale consideration was only `1 lakh. As rightly noted by the learned District Judge,
Imphal West, Section 92 of the Evidence Act, 1872, normally bars a party claiming under a
document to put up a stand contrary to the written contents of such document. Therefore, the recital
of a lesser sale consideration in the year 2010 did not affect the validity of the document and it was
only the registration thereof by a registering authority, who lacked territorial jurisdiction, that
proved to be its undoing.
RSA Nos.12 & 13 of 2017 &
RSA No.02 of 2018 Page 20
[29] On facts, it may be noted that Sanajaoba Singh's conduct throughout
clearly reflected his lack of bonafides. His claim, at the outset, was that he was not even the owner of
the suit-land. This was disproved by Enjibala Devi by placing on record the registered gift deed
dated 03.06.2006 (Ex.B9), whereby Sanajaoba Singh's mother transferred the suit-land to him by
way of a gift. His next claim was that the subject document was intended to be a mortgage deed for
`1 lakh. This was also disproved by the testimonies of various witnesses who spoke on behalf of
Enjibala Devi. Further, though he claimed that he came to know that the subject document was a
sale deed in September, 2010 itself, i.e., around the date when an ownership certificate was issued to
Enjibala Devi to enable her to obtain the compensation for the acquired land, Sanajaoba Singh did
nothing to stop the same. This clearly shows that he had no issue then and only thereafter, he
developed an afterthought to attack this transaction. It has also been brought on record that the
registration of the Sale Deed by an incompetent registering authority was also attributable to
Sanajaoba Singh himself. DW-3, an independent witness, being an Advocate by profession and a
friend of Enjibala Devi's younger brother (DW-2), stated that Sanajaoba Singh came to the school on
that fateful day along with the deed-writer and upon his instruction, the deed-writer produced the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172234429/ 12
R.K.Sanajaoba Singh vs Sorensangbam Enjibala Devi on 31 January, 2023
already drafted sale deed in respect of the suit-land and read out the contents thereof in the
presence of all. Further, the deed-writer himself was examined as DW-4 and being a completely
independent witness, he supported Enjibala Devi to the hilt. In his cross-examination, he
categorically stated that the sale deed was scribed by him and after its drafting was completed,
Sanajaoba Singh took him to the school complex where the vendee, Enjibala Devi, was present. He
further stated that he RSA Nos.12 & 13 of 2017 & RSA No.02 of 2018 Page 21 did not know whether
the sale deed had been registered or not, but after being shown the document, he stated that he
found that it was a registered one. He went on to state that the '(V)' on top of the original sale deed
meant 'Visit', meaning to say that the registering authority himself 'visited' the place where the
registration took place. Reference may also be made to the letter dated 03.11.2010 (Ex.B8) written
by the Sub-Registrar, Porompat, to the Sub-Registrar, Wangoi, informing him that he had registered
the subject document. Sanajaoba Singh did not even contest the claim of Enjibala Devi that it was he
himself who had arranged for the registration of the document by the Sub-Registrar, Porompat, at
the school where Enjibala Devi worked. In the light of this, Sanajaoba Singh cannot be permitted to
take advantage of his own mistake in bringing the wrong registering authority and seek to merrily
wash his hands off the proved transaction.
[30] As pointed out by the Supreme Court in Maria Margarida Sequeria Fernandes (supra), truth
alone should be the foundation of justice as the entire judicial system was created only to discern
and find out the real truth and the mandate, obligation and bounden duty of Judges at all levels
would be to seriously engage themselves in the journey of discovering the truth. The Supreme Court
went to the extent of stating that Judges should leave no stone unturned in achieving this objective.
On similar lines, in Mohanlal Shamji Soni vs. Union of India and another [1991 Supp. (1) SCC 271],
the Supreme Court cautioned that Courts must discharge their statutory functions, according to law,
in dispensing justice as it is the duty of the Court not only to do justice but also to ensure that justice
is done. Again, in Prithipal Singh and others vs. State of Punjab and another [(2012) 1 SCC 10], the
Supreme Court observed that extraordinary RSA Nos.12 & 13 of 2017 & RSA No.02 of 2018 Page 22
situations would demand extraordinary remedies and the Court would have to innovate law and
pass unconventional orders while dealing with unprecedented cases, keeping in view that
extraordinary fact-situations require extraordinary measures. In Kusheshwar Prasad Singh vs. State
of Bihar and others [(2007) 11 SCC 447], the Supreme Court observed that it is a settled principle of
law that a man cannot be permitted to take undue and unfair advantage of his own wrong to gain a
favourable interpretation of law and that a wrong doer ought not to be permitted to make a profit
out of his own wrong.
[31] Therefore, on the above analysis, this Court finds that the direction of the learned District
Judge, Imphal West, to the Sub-Registrar, Wangoi, must be read as a direction to register the Sale
Deed dated 26.07.2010 afresh and not as a direction to 're-register' it under the provisions of the
Registration Act, 1908. As the earlier registration of the said document by the Sub-Registrar,
Porompat, had no validity in the eye of law and was non est, it would be open to the Sub-Registrar,
Wangoi, to effect the registration afresh of the said document either by pasting sheets of blank paper
on the back of each page of the said document or by separately attaching blank sheets for the
purpose of effecting registration thereof. As this registration has to take place at the present point of
time, the Government policy embodied in the Order dated 20.03.2012 of the Revenue Department,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172234429/ 13
R.K.Sanajaoba Singh vs Sorensangbam Enjibala Devi on 31 January, 2023
Government of Manipur, would have application. The stamp duty and the registration fees payable
for the registration of the document have to be computed in accordance with the said order or any
amendment thereof obtaining as on date. The same shall be payable and shall be borne by Enjibala
Devi, in terms of the normal procedure, as there is no recital in Ex.A3/Ex.B4 Sale Deed to the effect
that RSA Nos.12 & 13 of 2017 & RSA No.02 of 2018 Page 23 the registration fees and stamp duty for
the registration thereof were to be borne by Sanajaoba Singh.
[32] As regards RSA No.2 of 2018, the only complaint of Enjibala Devi, the appellant therein, is that
the learned District Judge, Imphal West, failed to note her suit prayer for eviction of Sanajaoba
Singh from the suit-land by removing the structures thereon and to deliver her vacant possession. It
appears that, having granted relief in relation to registration of the sale deed, the learned District
Judge overlooked the consequential prayer of Enjibala Devi with regard to delivery of possession of
the suit-land to her. As the learned District Judge rendered a finding to the effect that Sanajaoba
Singh was in permissive possession of the suit-land in the light of the clear recital in Clause (4) of
the Sale Deed dated 26.07.2010 (Ex.A3/Ex.B4) that he had delivered possession of the land sold to
the vendee, Enjibala Devi would be entitled to this consequential relief in addition to registration of
the document afresh.
[33] In the result, substantial question of law No. 1 framed in RSA Nos. 12 and 13 of 2017 is
answered to the effect that the defect in the Sale Deed bearing Document No.1347(V) of 2010
registered on 30.07.2010 is incurable; substantial question of law No. 2 in RSA Nos. 12 and 13 of
2017 is answered to the effect that the direction of the learned District Judge, Imphal West, with
regard to registration of the sale deed was not improper; substantial question of law No. 3 in RSA
Nos. 12 and 13 of 2017 is answered to the effect that registration of the Sale Deed (Ex.A3/Ex.B4) is
to be done afresh and not as a 're-registration'; and substantial question No. 4 in RSA Nos. 12 and 13
of 2017 is answered to the effect that the registration afresh of the sale deed would have to be in
conformity with the RSA Nos.12 & 13 of 2017 & RSA No.02 of 2018 Page 24 Government's policy
embodied in the Order dated 20.03.2012 of the Revenue Department, Government of Manipur. The
substantial question of law framed in RSA No. 2 of 2018 is answered to the effect that the learned
District Judge, Imphal West, erred in failing to grant consequential relief based on the findings
recorded. [34] Regular Second Appeal Nos. 12 and 13 of 2013 filed by R.K.Sanajaoba Singh are
accordingly dismissed and Regular Second Appeal No.2 of 2018 filed by Sorensangbam Enjibala
Devi is allowed. In consequence, there shall be a direction to the Sub-Registrar, Wangoi, to effect
fresh registration of the Sale Deed dated 26.07.2010 by collecting registration fees and stamp duty
thereon from Sorensangbam Enjibala Devi, in terms of the Order dated 20.03.2012 of the Revenue
Department, Government of Manipur, as amended till date. Sorensangbam Enjibala Devi shall
produce the said document for registration within three weeks from the date of this judgment and
decree after completing all formalities and R.K.Sanajaoba Singh shall present himself before the
Sub-Registrar, Wangoi, when called upon to do so for the purpose of registering the document.
Further, R.K.Sanajaoba Singh shall vacate the suit-land by demolishing the structures standing
thereon and peaceful & vacant possession of the suit-land shall be delivered by him to
Sorensangbam Enjibala Devi within four weeks from the date of this judgment and decree.
In the circumstances of the case, parties shall bear their own costs.
