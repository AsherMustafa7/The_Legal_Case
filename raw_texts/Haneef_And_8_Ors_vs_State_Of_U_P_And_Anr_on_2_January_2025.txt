"100. In conclusion, we would like to issue certain directions. These directions are
meant for the investigating agencies and also for the courts. Accordingly, we deem it
appropriate to issue the following directions, which may be subject to State
amendments:
100.1. The Government of India may consider the introduction of a separate
enactment in the nature of a Bail Act so as to streamline the grant of bails.
100.2. The investigating agencies and their officers are duty-bound to comply with
the mandate of Sections 41 and 41-A of the Code and the directions issued by this
Court in Arnesh Kumar [Arnesh Kumar v. State of Bihar, (2014) 8 SCC 273 : (2014) 3
SCC (Cri) 449]. Any dereliction on their part has to be brought to the notice of the
higher authorities by the court followed by appropriate action.
100.3. The courts will have to satisfy themselves on the compliance of Sections 41 and
41-A of the Code. Any non-compliance would entitle the accused for grant of bail.
100.4. All the State Governments and the Union Territories are directed to facilitate
Standing Orders for the procedure to be followed under Section 41 and 41-A of the
Code while taking note of the order of the High Court of Delhi dated 7-2-2018 in
Amandeep Singh Johar v. State (NCT of Delhi) [Amandeep Singh Johar v. State (NCT
of Delhi), 2018 SCC OnLine Del 13448] and the Standing Order issued by Delhi
Police i.e. Standing Order 109 of 2020, to comply with the mandate of Section 41-A of
the Code.
100.5. There need not be any insistence of a bail application while considering the
application under Sections 88, 170, 204 and 209 of the Code.
100.6. There needs to be a strict compliance of the mandate laid down in the
judgment of this Court in Siddharth [Siddharth v. State of U.P., (2022) 1 SCC 676 :
(2022) 1 SCC (Cri) 423].
100.7. The State and Central Governments will have to comply with the directions
issued by this Court from time to time with respect to constitution of special courts.

The High Court in consultation with the State Governments will have to undertake an
exercise on the need for the special courts. The vacancies in the position of Presiding
Officers of the special courts will have to be filled up expeditiously.
100.8. The High Courts are directed to undertake the exercise of finding out the
undertrial prisoners who are not able to comply with the bail conditions. After doing
so, appropriate action will have to be taken in light of Section 440 of the Code,
facilitating the release.
100.9. While insisting upon sureties the mandate of Section 440 of the Code has to be
kept in mind.
100.10. An exercise will have to be done in a similar manner to comply with the
mandate of Section 436-A of the Code both at the district judiciary level and the High
Court as earlier directed by this Court in Bhim Singh [Bhim Singh v. Union of India,
(2015) 13 SCC 605 : (2016) 1 SCC (Cri) 663] , followed by appropriate orders.
100.11. Bail applications ought to be disposed of within a period of two weeks except
if the provisions mandate otherwise, with the exception being an intervening
application. Applications for anticipatory bail are expected to be disposed of within a
period of six weeks with the exception of any intervening application.
6. It is needless to mention that the Apex Court in Satender Kumar Antil vs Central Bureau of
Investigation and another; (2021) 10 SCC 773 has also approved for grant of interim bail till disposal
of bail application. Para 6 of the Satender Kumar Antil (supra) decided on 07.10.2021 is being
quoted as under:
"6. We may also notice an aspect submitted by Mr Luthra that while issuing notice to
consider bail, the trial court is not precluded from granting interim bail taking into
consideration the conduct of the accused during the investigation which has not
warranted arrest. On this aspect also we would give our imprimatur and naturally the
bail application to be ultimately considered, would be guided by the statutory
provisions."
7. For a period of three weeks from today or till disposal of bail application of applicants, whichever
is earlier, no coercive action shall be taken against the applicants in the aforesaid case.
8. All pending applications are disposed of, accordingly.
