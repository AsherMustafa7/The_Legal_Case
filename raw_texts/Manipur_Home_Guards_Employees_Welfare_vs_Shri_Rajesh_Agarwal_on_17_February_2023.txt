JUDGMENT AND ORDER
(CAV)
This contempt petition has been filed by the petitioner to punish the respondents for their willful
disobedience of the order dated 7.4.2022 passed in W.P.(C) No.425 of 2021.
2. Heard Mr. M. Hemchandra, learned senior scounsel for the petitioner; Mr. Y. Nirmolchand,
learned senior counsel for the first contemnor and Mr. P. Tamphamani, learned counsel for the
contemnors 2 and 3.
3. Mr. Hemchandra, the learned senior counsel for the petitioner submitted that the contemnors
knowing well the existence of the order dated 7.4.2022 passed in W.P.(C) No.425 of 2021 have not
taken any concrete action and, therefore, the conduct of the contemnors amounts to willful and
Cont.Cas(C) No. 124 of 2022 (Ref:-WP(C) No. 425 of 2021) Page |3 deliberate disobedience of the
order passed by this Court in W.P.(C) No.425 of 2022 dated 7.4.2022.
4. The learned senior counsel for the petitioner further submitted that on 16.4.2021, the petitioner
submitted a representation for implementation/enforcement of the Police Department's letter dated
30.1.2021 read with the order dated 8.3.2021 issued by the Commandant General (Home Guards),
Manipur. Since the said representation dated 16.4.2021 has not been considered by the authorities,
the petitioner has filed W.P.(C) No.425 of 2021 for a direction on the respondents to implement the
letter dated 30.1.2021 read with order dated 8.3.2021 issued by the Commandant General (Home
Guards). He would submit that though this Court granted three months' time to consider the
representation of the petitioner, the respondents have not considered the same, which necessitated
the petitioner in filing the contempt petition to punish them for the willful disobedience of the
order.
5. During the course of arguments, by producing the notification dated 3.11.2022, the learned
counsel for the respondents 2 and 3 submitted that the order of this has been Cont.Cas(C) No. 124 of
2022 (Ref:-WP(C) No. 425 of 2021) Page |4 complied with and, therefore, the contempt petition
may be closed.
6. This Court considered the submissions raised by learned counsel appearing on either side.

Manipur Home Guards Employees Welfare ... vs Shri Rajesh Agarwal on 17 February, 2023
7. In the representation dated 16.4.2021, the petitioner requested for immediate implementation/
execution/ enforcement of the Police Department's letter even No. dated 30.01.2021 read with order
No.1/13(44)/2020(PT)- DCG(HG)/2581 dated 08.03.2021 issued by the Commandant General
(Home Guards), Manipur. By the order dated 7.4.2022, this Court directed the respondents to
consider the letter dated 30.1.2021 and the order 08.3.2021 and to pass appropriate speaking orders
within a period of three months from the date of receipt of copy of the order.
8. Since the letter dated 30.9.2021 and the order dated 8.3.2021 refer to the
amendment/modification of the existing Manipur Home Guards Act and Rules and the Manipur
Home Guards Rules, 2022 having been framed and published vide notification dated 3.11.2022, this
Court is of the view that the order of this Court dated 7.4.2022 passed in W.P.(C) Cont.Cas(C) No.
124 of 2022 (Ref:-WP(C) No. 425 of 2021) Page |5 No.425 of 2021 has been complied with by the
contemnors. If the petitioner is aggrieved by the framing of the Manipur Home Guards Rules, 2022
and its notification, it is open to the petitioner to challenge the same in the manner known to law.
Though the petitioner contended that the Manipur Home Guards Rules, 2022 has not been framed
in proper manner, this Court is of the view that the correctness of Manipur Home Guards Rules,
2022 cannot be gone into in the contempt jurisdiction. Therefore, the contention of the learned
counsel for the petitioner that the order of this Court has not been fully complied with cannot be
countenanced. On the other hand, as stated supra, the order of this Court has been complied with by
the respondents.
9. Accordingly, finding satisfaction of the compliance of the order, the contempt petition is closed
and the contemnors are discharged.
