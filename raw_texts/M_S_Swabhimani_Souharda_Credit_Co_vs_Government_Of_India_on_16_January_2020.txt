THIS WRIT PETITION IS FILED UNDER ARTICLES 226
AND 227 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA PRAYING TO
DECALRE THAT THE KARNATAKA SOUHARDA SAHAKARI ACT
1997 (KARNATAKA ACT NO.17 OF 2000) FALLS WITHIN THE
MEANING OF THE WORDS "ANY OTHER LAW FOR TIME
BEING IN FORCE IN ANY STATE FOR THE REGISTRATION OF
CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETIES" FOUND IN SECTION 2(19) OF
INCOME TAX ACT 1961 (ACT 43 OF 1961). AND ETC.,
THESE PETITIONS HAVING BEEN HEARD AND
RESERVED FOR ORDER, THIS DAY, THE COURT
PRONOUNCED THE FOLLOWING:
ORDER
Petitioner in W.P.No.48414/2018 is a Credit Cooperative, registered under the Karnataka Souharda
Sahakari Act, 1997 (hereafter "1997 Act"); petitioner in W.P.No.14381/2019 is registered as the State
Federal Cooperative, as provided under Section 33 of the said Act; they have knocked at the doors of
writ court in substance for a prayer that they are entitled to seek deduction in respect of their
income in terms of the scheme envisaged under section 80P of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (hereafter
"1961 Act"), on the premises that they too are a Cooperative Society, on par with those registered
under the provisions of Karnataka Co-operative Societies Act, 1959.
2. After service of notice, the Respondent Nos.1 & 3 are represented by their Senior Panel Counsel
and the State is represented by the learned AGA.
3. Regardless of unsatisfactory pleadings of the petitioners, their learned counsel submits that there
have been two legislations relating to Cooperative Societies in the State of Karnataka viz., the
Karnataka Co-operative Societies Act, 1959 & the Karnataka Souharda Sahakari Act, 1997; the
entities registered under the 1997 Act also answer the definition of "cooperative society" enacted in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/121762566/ 3
M/S Swabhimani Souharda Credit Co ... vs Government Of India on 16 January, 2020
sec. 2(19) of the Income Tax Act 1961 and therefore, they are entitled to seek the benefit of sec.80P
thereof; the learned Panel Counsel for the Revenue per contra contends that the definition u/s 2(19)
mentions of only a co- operative society and not a Souharda Co-operative; in the guise of judicial
interpretation, the scope of the definition cannot be widened than what is prescribed by the
Parliament; a stand in variance with this will have far reaching implications on the Exchequer.
4. In the light of the rival submissions half heartedly made at the Bar, the following question of law
arises for consideration:
"Whether an entity registered under the Karnataka Souharda Sahakari Act, 1997 fits
into the definition of "co-operative society" as enacted by sec. 2(19) of the Income Tax
Act, 1961 for the purpose of Section 80P thereof?"
5. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and having perused the petition papers, this
Court is of a considered opinion that the answer to the above question needs to be in the affirmative
for the following reasons:
(a) sec.80P of the 1961 Act provides for deduction in respect of income of
Co-operative Societies is obvious going by its very text; sub-section (1) of said section
reads as under:
"80P. (1) Where, in the case of an assessee being a co-operative society, the gross
total income includes any income referred to in sub-section (2), there shall be
deducted, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this section, the sums
specified in sub-section (2) in computing the total income of the assessee."
The other provisions of this section being not of much relevance to the question being treated, are
not reproduced, although they too have been looked into.
Sec. 2(19) which finds a place in the Dictionary Clause of the 1961 Act reads as under:
'co-operative society" means a co-operative society registered under the Co-operative
Societies Act, 1912 (2 of 1912), or under any other law for the time being in force in
any State for the registration of co-operative societies;' The provisions of sec.80P are
enacted by the Parliament for promoting the co-operative movement in the Country
in tune with what Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi preached to the
countrymen; this Section needs to be liberally construed to effectuate the legislative
object of encouraging & promoting the growth of co-operative movement vide Kanga
& Palkhivala's The Law and Practice of Income Tax, 10th Edition, LexixNexis at page
1656; it is more so because the right to form a co-operative society itself is made a
Fundamental Right, now enshrining in Article 19(1)(i) by virtue of 97th Amendment
to the Constitution of India w.e.f. 15.10.2013;

M/S Swabhimani Souharda Credit Co ... vs Government Of India on 16 January, 2020
(b) the object of enacting sec.80P of the 1961 Act may be defeated if a restrictive
meaning is assigned to the definition of "co-operative society" as given u/s.2(19)
inasmuch as the invokability of the provisions of sec.80P is dependent upon the
entity seeking the benefit thereunder being a co-operative society; going by the text
and context of these provisions, one can safely conclude that all entities that are
registered under the enactments relating to co-operative societies, regardless of their
varying nomenclatures need to be treated as co-operative societies;
this view accords with the purposive construction of sec.80P r/w sec.2(19) of the 1961 Act;
(c) in the State of Karnataka, there have been two statutes enacted by the State Legislature that
relate to registration & regulation of co-operative societies viz., the Karnataka Co-operative Societies
Act, 1959 ie., Karnataka Act No.11 of 1959 and the Karnataka Souharda Sahakari Act,1997 ie.,
Karnataka Act No.17 of 2000; both these Acts are enacted pursuant to Article 246(3) r/w Entry 32,
List-II of Schedule VII of the Constitution of India; there is no other Entry to which this Act is
relatable; the Legislative Entries being only the fields of legislation need to be very broadly
interpreted, is the settled position of constitutional jurisprudence vide UJAGAR PRINTS, ETC. vs.
UNION OF INDIA, AIR 1989 SC 516; Chapter X of 1997 Act containing sec.67 enacts important
co-operative principles that animate and brood through almost all the provisions of this Act;
(d) the Karnataka Souharda Sahakari Bill, 1997 has the following as the Statement of Objects &
Reasons:
"1. the recognition, encouragement and voluntary formation of co-operatives based
on self help, mutual aid, wholly owned, managed and controlled by members as
accountable, competitive, self-reliant and economic enterprises guided by
co-operative principles specified therein;
2. removing all kinds of restrictions that have come to clog the free-functioning of the
co- operatives and the controls and interference by the Government except
registration and cancellation;
3. promotion of subsidiary organization, partnership between co-operatives and also
collaboration between co-operatives and other institutions;
4. registration of co-operatives, union co- operatives and Federal Co-operative in
furtherence of the objectives specified above;
5. Conversion of co-operative societies registered under the Karnataka Co-operative
Societies Act, 1959 as a co-operative under the proposed legislation. Hence the Bill."
(e) the preamble to the 1959 Act reads as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/121762566/ 5
M/S Swabhimani Souharda Credit Co ... vs Government Of India on 16 January, 2020
"Whereas it is expedient (to promote voluntary formation, autonomous functioning,
democratic control and professional management of co- operative societies) in the
State of Karnataka;
Be it enacted by the Karnataka State Legislature in the Tenth Year of the Republic of
India as follows-"
Similarly, the preamble to the 1997 Act reads as follows:
"Whereas it is expedient to provide for recognition, encouragement and voluntary
formation of co-operatives based on self-help, mutual aid, wholly owned, managed
and controlled by members as accountable, competitive, self-reliant and economic
enterprises guided by co-operative principles and for matters connected therewith;
Be it enacted by the Karnataka State Legislature in the Forty-eighth Year of Republic
of India as follows-".
A perusal of these two preambles and various provisions of these two Acts leads one to an irresistible
conclusion that both these Acts are cognate statutes that deal with co- operative societies, regardless
of some difference in their nomenclature and functionality, the subject matter being the same;
(e) the word 'co-operative' is defined by sec.2(d-2) of 1959 Act as under:
"2(d-2): 'Co-operative' means a Co-operative registerd under the Karnataka Souharda
Sahakari Act, 1997 (Karnataka Act 17 of 2000), and includes the Union Co-operative
and the Federal Co-operative"
Similarly, the word 'co-operative' is defined by Sec. 2(e) of 1997 Act as follows:
"2(e): "Co-operative" means a co-operative including a co-operative bank doing the
business of banking registered or deemed to be registered under Section 5 and which
has the words 'Souharda Sahakari' in its name (and for the purposes of the Banking
Regulation Act, 1949 (Central Act 10 of 1949), the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934
(Central Act 2 of 1934), the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation Act,
1961 (Central Act 47 of 1961) and the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural
Development Act, 1981 (Central Act 67 of 1981), it shall be deemed to be a
Co-operative Society".
A close examination of these two definitions shows that they have abundant proximity with each
other in terms of content and contours; it hardly needs to be stated that in both these definitions the
word 'co-operative' is employed not as an adjective but as a noun; the definition of other relative
concepts in the dictionary clauses of these Acts strengthens this view; this apart, sec.7 of the 1997
Act provides that the entity registered as a 'co-operative' shall be a body corporate, notwithstanding
the conspicuous absence of the word 'society' as a postfix; sec.9 of the 1959 Act makes the entity
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/121762566/ 6
M/S Swabhimani Souharda Credit Co ... vs Government Of India on 16 January, 2020
once registered u/s.8 thereof a body corporate; both the entities have perpetual succession by
operation of law; thus on registration be it under the 1959 Act or the 1997 Act, a legal personality is
donned by them, so that inter alia they can own and possess the property;
(f) the employment of the word "Sahakari" in the very title of the 1997 Act is also not sans any
significance; 'Sahakaar' in Sanskrit is the equivalent of 'sahakaara' in Kannada which means
'co-operation'; as already mentioned above both the 1959 Act and the 1997 Act employ this
terminology; the 1997 Act is woven with the principles of co-operation; sec.4 of this Act bars
registration of an entity unless its main objects are to serve the interest of the members in the area
of co-operation and its bye-laws provide for economic and social betterment of its members through
self-help & mutual aid in accordance with the co- operative principles; this apart, even sub-section
(2) of sec.4 is heavily loaded with co-operative substance.
In the above circumstances, these writ petitions succeed; a declaration is made to the effect that the
entities registered under the Karnataka Souharda Sahakari Act, 1997 fit into the definition of
"co-operative society" as enacted in sec.2(19) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 and therefore subject to all
just exceptions, petitioners are entitled to stake their claim for the benefit of sec.80P of the said Act;
a Writ of Certiorari issues quashing the impugned notice dated 30.03.2018 at Annexure-D in
W.P.No.48414/2018; other legal consequences accordingly do follow.
It is needless to mention that the other provisions of sec. 80P of 1961 Act and their effect on the
claim of the petitioner-like-societies have been left to be addressed by the concerned authorities.
No costs.
