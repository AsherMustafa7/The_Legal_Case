THIS M.F.A. COMING ON FOR ADMISSION, THIS DAY,
ALOK ARADHE J., DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING:
JUDGMENT
This appeal under Section 173(1) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (hereinafter referred to as 'the
Act') has been filed by the Insurance Company against judgment dated 02.11.2016 passed by the
Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as 'the Tribunal').
2. Facts leading to the filing of this appeal briefly stated are that on 16.05.2015 at about 3.30 p.m.,
deceased Hanumanthappa K.G. was proceeding in Alto car bearing registration No.KA 19 Z 2791 on
the left side of the road near tractor showroom situated on Hassan - Holenarasipura road, near
Industrial Area. At that time, driver of the container lorry bearing registration No.KA 04 A 9870
which was moving ahead of the Alto car, suddenly stopped without giving any indication, as a result
of which, Alto car collided with the container lorry from the hind side. In the aforesaid accident,
deceased Hanumanthappa sustained injuries and succumbed to the same while being taken to the
hospital.
3. Thereupon, the claimants filed a petition under Section 166(1) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988
inter alia on the ground that at the time of accident, the deceased was working as DDPI in the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/196108380/ 2
United India Insurance Co. Ltd vs Smt Sujatha on 30 September, 2020
Department of Education, Government of Karnataka and the claimants were solely depending on
the income of the deceased. It was further urged that the accident took place on account of rash and
negligent driving of the offending vehicle by its driver. The claimants claimed compensation to the
tune of Rs.1 Crore along with interest @ 18% p.a.
4. The respondent Nos.1 and 2 filed written statement in which inter alia, the mode and manner of
accident as well as the date, time and place of accident was denied. It was further denied that the
deceased was employed as DDPI and was drawing a salary of 80,000/- p.m. It was also pleaded that
the driver of the container lorry is not responsible for the accident as the Alto car in which deceased
was traveling, hit the lorry from behind. It was also pleaded that the car in which the deceased was
traveling attempted to overtake the lorry and lost the control while doing so and hit the lorry from
behind. It was averred that the accident took place on account of negligent driving on the part of the
driver of the Alto car. It was also pleaded that the compensation claimed by the claimants is
excessive and is exorbitant and the petition is bad on account of non- joinder of necessary parties as
the driver, owner and insurer of Alto car who are necessary parties, have not been impleaded.
5. The Claims Tribunal, on the basis of the pleadings of the parties, framed issues and recorded the
evidence. In order to prove their case, claimant No.3 got himself examined as PW1 and another
witness Mr.Devaraj as PW2 and got exhibited documents viz., Ex.P1 to Ex.P10. The respondents did
not adduce any evidence but produced Ex.R1. The Claims Tribunal, vide impugned judgment, inter
alia held that the accident took place on account of rash and negligent driving of the offending lorry
by its driver and as a result of which, deceased sustained severe injuries and succumbed to the same.
The Claims Tribunal further held that the deceased Hanumanthappa expired in an accident on
16.05.2015 and the aforesaid accident took place solely on the negligence of the driver of the
container lorry. It was also held that the claimants are entitled to the compensation to the tune of
`39,55,000/- along with interest @ 6% p.a. from the date of petition till realisation. In the aforesaid
factual background, this appeal has been filed.
6. Learned counsel for the Insurance Company has submitted that the accident took place on
account of negligence on the part of the deceased. It was further submitted that the car dashed the
hind portion of the offending vehicle which was evident by the first information report. Our
attention is also invited to Ex.P5 IMV report. It is urged that the compensation awarded under the
conventional heads is on the higher side.
7. We have considered the submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties and have
perused the record. It is well settled in law that in a proceeding under Section 166 of the Act, the
Tribunal has to take holistic view of the matter. A strict proof of an accident caused by a particular
vehicle in a particular manner may not be possible and the claimants are required to prove their
claim on the touch stone of preponderance of probabilities and the test of standard of proof beyond
reasonable doubt cannot be applied in a proceeding under Section 166 of the Act. (See MANGALA
RAM Vs. ORIENTAL INSURANCE CO. LTD. (2018) 5 SCC
656).

In the background of the well settled legal position, the facts of the case in hand may be examined. It
is pertinent to mention here that on behalf of the claimants one eye witness namely Devaraj (PW-2)
has been examined. In his evidence, PW-2 has stated that he was proceeding on his motor bike on
the left side of the road near tractor showroom on Hassan - Holenarasipura road. It is further been
stated that the driver of the container lorry suddenly applied the brake and stopped the vehicle
without giving any signal as a result of which Alto car collided against the container lorry from the
hind side and the accident was caused. It is pertinent to mention here that even though the plea of
negligence has been taken by the Insurance Company before us, yet the best witness who could have
proved the manner in which the accident had taken place namely the driver of the container lorry,
has not been examined. The Insurance Company has only examined its officer as RW-1 who was not
present at the spot of the accident. It is also pertinent to mention here that in the cross-examination
even the aforesaid witness has admitted that the accident took place on account of the negligence on
the part of the driver of the container lorry and the police have registered first information report
against the driver of the container lorry and have also filed the charge sheet. The Insurance
Company has not led any evidence to prove the plea of negligence. Therefore, the Tribunal, in our
considered opinion, on the basis of meticulous appreciation of evidence on record and by placing
reliance on the evidence of eye witness namely PW-2, has correctly held that the accident took place
on account of rash and negligent action on the part of the driver of the container lorry.
8. Sofar as the quantum of compensation is concerned, we find that the claim petition has been filed
by the widow as well as the son and daughter. In view of the law laid down by the Constitution
Bench of the Supreme Court in 'MAGMA GENERAL INSURANCE CO. LTD. Vs. NANU RAM' 2018
ACJ 2782, which has been subsequently clarified by the Supreme Court in 'UNITED INDIA
INSURANCE CO. LTD. Vs. SATINDER KAUR AND ORS.' IN CIVIL APPEAL NO.2705/2020
DECIDED ON 30.06.2020, the claimants are entitled to `40,000/- each as loss of consortium and
loss of love and affection. Thus, the claimants are entitled to `1,20,000/- under this head. In
addition, the claimants are entitled to `30,000/- on account of loss of estate and funeral expenses in
view of the law laid down by the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in 'NATIONAL
INSURANCE COMPANY LIMITED Vs. PRANAY SETHI AND OTHERS' AIR 2017 SC 5157.
Therefore, the claimants are held entitled to compensation as follows:
1. Loss of dependency `37,30,012/-
2. Loss of estate ` 50,000/-
3. Loss of love and affection ` 45,000/-
4. Loss of consortium ` 1,20,000/-
5. Transportation of dead body and funeral expenses ` 30,000/-
TOTAL `39,75,012/-
Thus, the claimants are entitled to total

United India Insurance Co. Ltd vs Smt Sujatha on 30 September, 2020
compensation of `39,75,012/-. Needless to state that
the aforesaid amount of compensation shall carry interest at the rate of 6% p.a. from
the date of petition till payment is made. To the aforesaid extent, the judgment of the
Claims Tribunal is modified.
Accordingly, the appeal is disposed of.
