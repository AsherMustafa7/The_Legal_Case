ORDER
09/01/2017 Per : Justice Rajendra Menon :-
1. In all these writ petitions, the petitioners who are working in the establishment of
Madhya Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation had challenged the action of the
Corporation in not accepting their applications seeking withdrawal of their option
submitted under the Voluntary Retirement Scheme floated by the Corporation.
Initially on various grounds and considerations writ petitions and writ appeals
identical in nature were allowed by benches of this Court and finally all the matters
went to the Hon'ble Supreme Court at the instance of the Corporation, wherein the
judgments passed by this Court in writ petitions and writ appeals were challenged
and finally in Civil Appeal No.4437/2009 decided on 29.8.2016 (Madhya Pradesh
State Road Transport Corporation Vs. Manoj Kumar and Ors.) reported in 2016 SCC
Online SC 874 the matter has been decided and the Hon'ble Supreme Court has laid
down the principle in the case of Manoj Kumar (supra) to say that once the option for
VRS has been submitted and the same has been accepted by the Corporation, a
concluded contract comes into force and voluntary retirement option submitted
cannot be withdrawn once the acceptance is made by the Corporation.
2. In view of the aforesaid, now the case of the petitioners stands decided against
them by the Supreme Court and therefore in light of the judgment rendered in the
case of Manoj Kumar (supra) we see no reason to make any indulgence into the
matter.

3. Accordingly all these writ petitions are dismissed. However, the benefits of VRS
and monetary benefits accruing to the petitioners by virtue of acceptance of the
voluntary retirement is not granted till now, the same be granted to them within a
period of 60 days from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this order.
