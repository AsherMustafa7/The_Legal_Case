Certificate” to the petitioner to claim waiver of Transshipment Charges billed by the Integrated Air
Cargo Complex, Airport Authority of India, Meenambakkam, Chennai 600027 (Air Cargo Complex

in transshipping the cargo brought by them for being transshipped to Trivandrum International
Airport during the period between 26.11.2009 and 13.12.2009.
4. It is the case of the petitioner that since it has wide-bodied cargo aircrafts and since there is no
facility for landing of such aircrafts in Trivandrum, the petitioner brought the cargo in these
aircrafts to the Chennai International Airport for being transshipped to Trivandrum/Calicut by
road.

transshipment and the demurrage by the Air Port Authority of India, Air Cargo Complex, Chennai.
7. The Chennai International Air Cargo Complex represented by 3rd / 4th respondent is the
custodian of imported goods within the customs area under Section 45 of the Customs Act, 1962 had
demanded a sum of Rs.82,89,226/- vide its bills from the petitioner. After adjustments of the
amount paid by the petitioner, the final amount payable by the petitioner was quantified as
Rs.65,46,830/-.
8. The case of the petitioner is that the petitioner attempted to file application for transshipment of
cargo to Trivandrum which had arrived by Flight Nos.QR.6270, 6272 and 6274 between 26.11.2009
and 13.12.2009. However, the Customs Department delayed in receiving transhipment application
and in completing the transshipment formalities ____________ http://www.judis.nic.in Page No
4 of 46 and as a result of which there was delay and therefore the petitioner has been visited with
additional burden of transshipment and demurrage charges by the Airport Authority of India
(hereinafter referred as AAI) represented by 3rd / 4th respondent.
9. It is stated that the Customs Department refused to take applications pending and the goods were
allowed to be trannsshipped only from 30.11.2009 to 05.01.2010.
10. The petitioner therefore requested the 1st and 2nd respondents to issue of “Detention
Certificate” to claim waiver / remission from payment of demurrage charges from the 3rd/4th
respondent at the earliest.
11. The petitioner submits that it sent a representation dated 11.12.2009 to the 2nd respondent, to
permit transshipment of the imported cargo. In the said letter, the petitioner had specifically
complained that it transshipment cargo has been stopped and that they are incurring huge
demurrage charges in the hands of the 4th respondent. ____________ http://www.judis.nic.in

12. The 2nd respondent by its letter dated 14.12.2009 merely queried the reasons for bringing the
subject cargo to Chennai Airport instead of taking directly to Trivandrum.
13. The petitioner submits that the 2nd respondent’s letter dated 14.12.2009 clearly brings out the
fact that the Customs Department has not denied difficulty experienced by it in processing the
transshipment applications of the petitioner. It is further submitted that by not permitting the
petitioner to transship the cargo amounted to detention of the goods and therefore, the least the
Customs Department could do was to issue “Detention Certificate” to the petitioner for it to claim
waiver/remission of such amount from the 3rd and the 4th respondent.
14. It is further submitted that it is not an unusual practices of the petitioner and it has been
transshipping the cargo for quite some time through the Chennai Port.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166036477/ 3
M/S.Qatar Airways vs Commissioner Of Customs (Air) on 19 May, 2020
15. It is submitted that query raised in letter dated 14.12.2009 by the 2nd respondent was also not
bonafide and intended to deflect the in- ____________ http://www.judis.nic.in Page No 6 of 46
house problem faced by the Customs Department at that point of time.
16. The petitioner replied to the letter dated 14.12.2009 of the 2nd respondent and stated that the
reasons for bringing the goods to Chennai. Subsequently, the 2nd respondent accorded
transshipment permission for the goods after an inordinate delay of more than three days and in
some cases the delay has been extended to twenty eight days.
17. It is submitted that there was a clear inaction by the 1st and 2nd respondents in not facilitating
free movement of imported cargo expeditiously by granting transshipment permission.
18. Since the 4th respondent issued a demand notice dated 08.02.2010 and called upon the
petitioner to settle the dues accumulated due to the delay in transshipment, the petitioner submitted
a letter dated 12.02.2010 to the 1st respondent and requested for issue a “Detention Certificate” to
recommend waiver of extra transshipment and demurrage charges incurred since the delay in
transshipment was not due to the fault or negligence of the petitioner. The petitioner has also
requested the 3rd ____________ http://www.judis.nic.in Page No 7 of 46 respondent to waive
the demurrage charges.
19. Since the petitioner was unable to elicit any positive response from the respondents, the
petitioner filed W.P.No.3317 of 2010 to consider and dispose its representation for issue of
“Detention Certificate” and to recommend for waiver of demurrage charges by the 3rd / 4th
respondent.
20. Meanwhile, by the impugned communication/order dated 10.03.2010, the 1st respondent
rejected the request of the petitioner for issue of “Detention Certificate”. Under these circumstances,
W.P.No.3317 of 2010 was withdrawn and thereafter, the present Writ Petition was filed.
21. The 3rd respondent vide separate letter dated 19.03.2010 also rejected the request of the

informed that the consignment was detained by them. The petitioner has not challenged the said
order.
____________ http://www.judis.nic.in Page No 8 of 46
22. During the course of the hearing, for the 1st time, the learned counsel for the petitioner
submitted that during the same period, 9 out of 11 customs officers who were serving at the Chennai
Air Cargo Complex and handling transshipment of cargo were arrested and 8 of them were middle
level officials and there was a complete disruption of the activities on account of arrest.
23. It is further submitted that couple of dealers were also arrested who were allegedly in cohorts
with some of the arrested officers who had facilitated evasion of Customs duty and that the CBI had
raided the residence of some of these officials and recovered a sum of Rs.17 lakhs of unaccounted
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166036477/ 4
M/S.Qatar Airways vs Commissioner Of Customs (Air) on 19 May, 2020
cash and 25 lakhs worth jewellery apart from recovery of a sum of Rs.59,000/- in cash from the
office premises.
24. To this effect the learned counsel for the petitioner also filed news papers clipping to state that
there was a complete breakdown of the system and practically there were no officers available to
receive the ____________ http://www.judis.nic.in Page No 9 of 46 application and process the
transshipment application by the 1st respondent.
25. The learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted that majority of the officers stationed at
the Air Port were also remanded to judicial custody and therefore neither the transshipment
applications were received nor processed which resulted in the late clearance of the imported cargo.
It is therefore submitted that the petitioner cannot be saddled with liability.
26. These allegations regarding arrest of the customs officials of the Air Cargo were not the basis of
the writ petition. These were highlighted for the Court to take judicial notice of the prevailing
ground reality then which had totally crippled and disrupted the transshipment operation.
27. However, in the affidavit filed in support of the present writ petition, the petitioner has merely
stated that the customs department did not permit them to file transshipment application on time
and therefore ____________ http://www.judis.nic.in Page No 10 of 46 request was sent to the 1st
respondent on 11.12.2009 to permit transshipment of the subject goods. The learned counsel for the
petitioner relied on the following judgments:
i. Shipping Corporation of India Limited Vs. C.L.JainWoolen Mills, 2001 (129) ELT
561 (SC). ii. AgrimSampada Limited Vs. UOI, 2004 (168) ELT 15 (Del.) iii.

v. Trip Communication Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Union of India & Others, order dated 28.03.2014 passed by the
Delhi High Court in W.P.(C).No.7438 of 2018.
28. The respondents have filed their counter affidavits. According to the 1st and 2nd respondents,
the imported cargos were allowed to be transhipped as and when the applications were filed. The
applications were processed without delay and therefore there is no question of issue of any
“Detention Certificate” to recommend waiver of transshipment ____________
http://www.judis.nic.in Page No 11 of 46 charges and the demurrages. He further submitted that the
petitioner has suppressed material fact regarding the rejection of the request by the 3rd and the 4th
respondents.
29. The learned counsel for the 1st and the 2nd respondents submitted that even if there was a delay
on the part of the Customs Authority, though which is not the case here, the petitioner was guilty of
not filing the transshipment application in time and there is no evidence to substantiate the delay
and therefore the petitioner cannot claim any waiver from payment of demurrage and detention
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166036477/ 5
M/S.Qatar Airways vs Commissioner Of Customs (Air) on 19 May, 2020
charges.

4th respondents for waiver in accordance with provisions of the Airports Authority of India (Storage
and Processing of Cargo, Courier and Express Goods and Postal Mail) Regulations, 2003. The said
application was also rejected by the 3 rd / 4th respondent which fact has been suppressed in this
Writ Petition. ____________ http://www.judis.nic.in Page No 12 of 46
31. He drew my attention to paragraph 37 of the decision in Mumbai Port Trust Vs. Shri Lakshmi
Steels, 2017 (352) E.L.T.401 (S.C), wherein, the Hon’ble Supreme Court held that it is the importer
alone is liable to pay the demurrage charges. It is submitted that Regulation 6 of the Handling of
Cargo in Customs Area Regulations, 2009 is not applicable.
32. He further submits that the 3rd and the 4th respondents are entitled to collect the charges under
the provision of the Airports Authority of India (Storage and Processing of Cargo, Courier and
Express Goods and Postal Mail) Regulations, 2003. Further, the request for “Detention Certificate”
was belated and not bonafide and such certificate cannot be granted as a matter of right.
33. The learned counsel also submitted that the news paper report which were circulated during
hearing in the additional typed-set of documents were intended to prejudice the mind of the Court.
It is further submitted that the news items that there were arrests has to be examined from the
prism of Section 81 of the Evidence Act. News items from newspaper cannot be treated as proof of
the facts stated therein. It is ____________ http://www.judis.nic.in Page No 13 of 46 submitted
that the content of newspaper are hearsay and are not genuine. The learned counsels for the
respondents relied on the following decisions:-
i. Mumbai Port Trust Vs. Shri Lakshmi Steels and Others, (2018) 14 SCC 317.

(344) E.L.T. 810 (Ker.) iv. Jindal Drugs Limited Vs. Union of India, 2018 (361) E.L.T.
769 (S.C.)
34. The 3rd and the 4th respondents have stated that the petitioner is not entitled to any waiver in
absence of any “Detention Certificate” and that the goods were allowed to be transshipped on credit
basis even though the Port Authority has lien over the goods until payment of charges.
35. I have heard learned counsel for the petitioner and the ____________
http://www.judis.nic.in Page No 14 of 46 respondent.
36. The dispute herein pertains to collection of Transshipment and other charges such as demurrage
for storage of containers by the custodian of the goods.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166036477/ 6
M/S.Qatar Airways vs Commissioner Of Customs (Air) on 19 May, 2020
37. Demurrage is collected by the Custodian of the import or export goods for the delay in removal
and for occupying the space within its space beyond the time given.
38. Detention charges on the other hand are collected by the liner or the carrier as the case may be
when the consignee holds onto the carrier’s container outside of the port, terminal, or depot beyond
the free time that is allotted. Detention amount is charged when import containers have been picked
up and continues to be in the possession of the consignee and is not been returned within the
allotted time. It is a private arrangement/ contract between the liner and the consignee.
39. For instance, if a period of 3 days is provided for return of an ____________
http://www.judis.nic.in Page No 15 of 46 empty import container to the steamship liner or carrier as
the case may be and the consignee takes more than three days to return this container, the
steamship/carrier may charge for such Detention.
40. As far as transshipment of imported cargo is concerned, it is governed by Chapter VIII of the
Customs Act, 1952. As per Section 54(3) of the said Act, a proper officer may allow the goods to be
transshipped, without payment of duty, subject to such condition as may be prescribed for the new
arrival of such goods at the Customs station to which transshipment is allowed.
41. The Airport Authority of India and Port Authorities have been appointed as custodians of
imported goods under Section 45 of the Customs Act, 1962. Over a period of time, private operators
have been allowed to be operated as custodians to decongest the ports and airports.
42. An elaborate procedure has been prescribed for being followed by custodians of the goods
appointed under Section 45 of the Customs Act, 1962.
____________ http://www.judis.nic.in Page No 16 of 46
43. As far as imported cargoes which are to be transshipped by a motor vehicle, such transshipment
shall be made only on the permission in writing of the Commissioner of Customs as is evident from
a reading of proviso to Regulation 3 of the Goods Imported (Conditions of Transshipment)
Regulations, 1995.
44. The procedure for transshipment of imported cargo in containers/trucks from the airports/ACCs
to ICDs/CFSs/Airports/ACCs to the ICDs/CFSs/Airports/ACCs was explained in CircularNo.69/99-
Cusdated 6/10/1999 from F.No. 450/33/94-Cus. IV was issued by the Central Board of Excise and

http://www.judis.nic.in Page No 17 of 46 allowing movement of imported cargo in
containers/trucks from the airports/ ACCs to ICDs/CFSs/Airports/ACCs to the

for the cargo / passenger flights as per available schedule.
2. The matter has been examined. With a view to supplementing the existing flights and providing

45. Transshipment is allowed subject to the condition that the declarant, i.e the person in charge of
the conveyance of the imported cargo or his agent makes an application with the “proper officer” of
the custom for permission to transship the imported goods. However, permission has to be granted

M/S.Qatar Airways vs Commissioner Of Customs (Air) on 19 May, 2020
by the 1st respondent.
46. Airlines or the carrier or its agent is required to pay application fee for transshipment of

47. Certificate for waiver of demurrage referred to as “Detention Certificate” is being now issued by
the customs authorities to an importer to claim waiver from demurrage for the Port.
48. Only after appropriate permissions are granted by the 1st respondent, the imported cargo can be
moved to the bonded trucks/designated vehicles of the petitioner for being transhipped. At that
stage the petitioner as a transshipper also becomes the custodian of the imported cargo and it bound
by the bond.
49. By not filing the application, the petitioner would not have gained any advantage. There is no
explanation as to why the officers refused to receive the application for transshipment and clear the
cargo immediately when the petitioner addressed letter dated 11.12.2009 to the 2nd respondent.

Trivandrum and Calicut. If indeed there were no officers available to receive and scrutinise the
application for transshipment for the reasons stated by the petitioner, obviously there will be delay
in filing of transshipment application. The imported cargo therefore cannot be transhipped and
would stagnate in the premises of the Airport authority of India.
51. Therefore, the query dated 14.12.2009 of the 2nd respondent asking why cargo meant for
Trivandrum were routed through Chennai instead of carrying them directly to Trivandrum indicates
the request of the petitioner for immediate processing of Transshipment application was perhaps
intended to deflect the problem phased by the Customs. No reasons was given by the 2nd
respondent.
52. Therefore, in the background of the facts which have emerged, prima facie it appears the
petitioner may not have been guilty of any delay in filing transshipment application.
53. However, this would require proper verification and ____________ http://www.judis.nic.in
Page No 24 of 46 presentation of facts before the 1st respondent. On this score, I am inclined to set
aside the impugned communication and remit the case back to the 1st respondent to clearly state
whether there was indeed mass arrest of officer who were manning the transshipment operation at
the custom hold area at the Chennai Kamaraj International Air Cargo Complex during the material
period.
54. As far as levy and collection of transshipment, demurrage and other charges by Airport authority
of India are concerned, the Central Government under the provisions of the Airports Authority of
India Act, 1994 has issued Airport Authority of India (Storage and Processing of Cargo, Courier and

M/S.Qatar Airways vs Commissioner Of Customs (Air) on 19 May, 2020
Express Goods and Postal Mail) Regulations, 2003.
55. The Airports Authority of India (Storage and Processing of Cargo, Courier and Express Goods
and Postal Mail) Regulations, 2003 fixes the charges for processing of the Cargo and also formulates
policy for waiver of such demurrage charges. ____________ http://www.judis.nic.in Page No 25
of 46
56. The expression “Terminal Storage and Processing Charges” has been defined in Regulation
2(zc). It means the charges to be levied or collected by the authority or any authorised cargo
handling agency for use of cargo terminal facilities, audit services and other expenses incurred
including loading and unloading, storage and warehouse or processing cargo goods etc. and includes
electricity charges, insurance premium, security charges, terminal charges electronic data
interchange and electronic data interchange service centre charges, Value-Added Network service
charges, charges for heavy cargo, and cargo requiring special care such as hazardous, perishable, live
animals, valuable and express cargoes et cetera and license fee.
57. The expression “Transshipment Cargo” has been defined in Regulation 2(zd), to mean cargo
which is unloaded from one carrier and loaded or intended to be loaded on the same or another
carrier or vehicle for on-carriage to its final destination.
58. The expression “demurrage” also has been defined in Regulation 2(2) of the aforesaid
Regulation. It means the rate or amount ____________ http://www.judis.nic.in Page No 26 of 46
of charges payable to the authority by the shipper or consigning or carrier or agent or passenger for
utilising storage facility at the Cargo Terminal, for storage of cargo, goods, unaccompanied baggage,
stores, Courier bags, express parcels,postal mail etc. for extended period beyond the stipulated
period for clearance or removal from the Cargo Terminal or of the Customs at the Cargo Terminal.
59. During the relevant period, the cargo had to be cleared within 72 hours of its arrival. By order an
dated 02.12.2016, this time has been now reduced to 48 hours by the Director, Ministry of Civil
Aviation (ER Division).
60. For the purpose of Transshipment, the authority under the aforesaid Regulations relies on the
relevant airlines and customs document upon its admission, handing over and delivery as the case
may be for levy and collection of applicable charges.
61. Under Rule 4, the authority shall levy charges which may include unitisation and de-stuffing
charges, facilitation charges, terminal ____________ http://www.judis.nic.in Page No 27 of 46
storage and processing charges etc.
62. Under Regulation 6 of the Airport Authority of India (Storage and Processing of Cargo, Courier
and Express Goods and Postal Mail) Regulations, 2003, the Airport Authority can lay down
procedure and policy for grant of waiver demurrages charges under the regulation. Though such
scheme/policy exists for grant a waiver, neither the petitioner nor the 3rd/4th respondent have filed
the same before this court.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166036477/ 12
M/S.Qatar Airways vs Commissioner Of Customs (Air) on 19 May, 2020
63. Under the aforesaid Regulation 6, demurrage can be waived by the AAI represented by 3rd/4th
respondent if no fine/penalty/personal penalty stroke/ warning was imposed by the customs
authorities and where delay was on account of dispute in the assessable value or for re- validating or
correcting the license in ordinary course of appraisal.
64. The Delhi High Court has dealt with the same in Trip Communication Private Limited Vs. Union
of India in its order dated 28.03.2014 in W.P.(C.No).7438 of 2014. It has extracted relevant portion
____________ http://www.judis.nic.in Page No 28 of 46 of the aforesaid policy relating to waiver
of demurrage charges. It reads as under:-
“10.1 GENERAL 10.1.1 Subject to such policy, rules and procedures as may be
described the authorities specified hereunder are authorised to sanction, in
consultation with the Finance and Accounts Department, remission/waiver of
demurrage charges regarding Cargo Operation. 10.1.2 … … 10.1.10 Demurrage
charges shall not be waived where:
(a) Any fine/penalty/personal penalty/warning is imposed by the Customs Authority.
(b) Delay arose by reason of dispute in the assessable value or for revalidating or
correcting the licence in ordinary course of appraisal.”
65. The authority namely AAI can thus grant waiver/ remission of demurrage charges
in consultation with the Finance and Accounts Department and grant regarding
cargo operation. However, to grant such relief it relies on customs documents.
66. The procedure for issue of “Detention Certificate” was contained in Public Notice
No. 111 of 1985 dated 29.07.1985 of the Bombay Custom House. Issue of “Detention
Certificate” was an innovation by the Customs Authorities. This was introduced much
prior ____________ http://www.judis.nic.in Page No 29 of 46 to Handling of
Cargo in Custom Areas Regulations, 2009. Though a copy of the Public Notice No.111
of 1985 is not traceable, para 2 of the said Public has been reproduced by the Hon’ble
Supreme Court in BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE PORT OF BOMBAY Vs. JAI
HIND OIL MILLS COMPANY, (1987) 1 SCC 648. Same extracted here under from
the said judgment:-
Paragraph 2 of the said notice sets out the circumstances under which a regular
detention certificate could be issued by the Customs House for facilitating the
importers to get remission of demurrage charges. They are as under:-
“(a) Where the goods are detained by Customs House for bona fide operation of
import control formalities without any default on the part of the importers.
(b) Where the goods have been released on caution ( a regular detention certificate
and not a recommendatory letter).
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166036477/ 13
M/S.Qatar Airways vs Commissioner Of Customs (Air) on 19 May, 2020
(c) Where the goods are detained [by] the Custom House pending test report and the
facility of clearance against provisional assessment has not been allowed.
Such detention certificates will be issued on merits for the period for which the goods were detained
for the purpose.
(d) Where the goods are detained for PHO formalities, the certificate will cover the period stretching
between the date of drawal of the sample by the PHO and the date of his test results, and
____________ http://www.judis.nic.in Page No 30 of 46
(e) In cases where samples have been drawn from the imported consignments by the Assistant
Drugs Controller for ensuring compliance with the provisions of Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 and
where the Assistant Drugs Controller is of the opinion that release cannot be allowed against a letter
of guarantee pending tests."
8.The said public notice also states that detention certificates will not be issued in the following
types of cases:-
“(a)Time taken by the Custom House Laboratory for analytical/chemical testing of
samples drawn from the consignments, since the facility of clearing the goods on
bond in terms of Section 18 already exists.
(b) Samples drawn from the imported consignments by the Assistant Drugs
Controller for ensuring compliance with the provisions of Drugs and Cosmetics Act,
1940 and for being forwarded to the Central Drugs Laboratory, Calcutta, as the
importers can avail of the facility of clearing the goods against letters of guarantee
and need not wait till the receipt of the test report.
(c) The period taken for mutilation of woollen rags in the docks.
(d) Cases where goods are detained in the ordinary course of appraisement such as
for determination of the tariff classification of goods or their assessable value in
terms of Section 14 of the Customs Act."
67. Regulation 6(1)(l)of the Handling of Cargo in Customs Area ____________
http://www.judis.nic.in Page No 31 of 46 Regulations, 2009 mandates that the Customs Cargo
Service provider shall subject to any other law for the time being in force, shall not charge any rent
or demurrage on the goods seized or detained or confiscated by the Superintendent of Customs or
Appraiser or Inspector of Customs or Preventive officer or examining officer, as the case may be.
68. As per Regulation 6(1)(l) of the Handling of Cargo in Customs Area Regulations, 2009, a
Customs Cargo Service Provider which includes the Air Port Authority of India cannot charge any
rent or demurrage on the seized or detained or confiscated goods by the Superintendent of Customs
or Appraiser or Inspector of Customs or Preventive officer or examining officer, as the case may be.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166036477/ 14
M/S.Qatar Airways vs Commissioner Of Customs (Air) on 19 May, 2020
This was perhaps framed in line with Public Notice No.111 of 1985 dated 29.07.1985 of Bombay
Customs House.
69. The petitioner is insisting for the “detention certificate” from the 1st respondent so that the 3rd
and the 4th respondents can be persuaded to not to charge any rent or demurrage on the imported
goods which transshipment from the Chennai Airport. ____________ http://www.judis.nic.in
Page No 32 of 46
70. The Superintendent of Customs or the Appraiser or the Inspector of Customs or the preventive
officer or examining officer as the case may be can exercise the power to recommend waiver of
demurrage and other charges that are chargeable by the custodian of the goods in whose
place/premises the goods are stored before being transshipped.
71. In Trustees of the Port of Madras Vs. M/s. Aminchand Pyarelal, (1976) 3 SCC 167, the Hon’ble
Supreme Court has held that the Port Trusts were under a statutory obligation to render services of
various kinds in the larger public and national interest.
72. The Hon’ble Supreme Court also observed that the demurrage charges are levied in order to
ensure quick clearance of the cargo from the harbour and the rates are fixed in such a way that they
would make it unprofitable for the importer to use the port premises as a warehouse. In case there is
congestion in the port it would affect the free movement of ships and of essential goods. Therefore,
the scale of rates had to be framed in such a manner that it worked both as an incentive to the
importers to remove the goods as expeditiously as possible from the ____________
http://www.judis.nic.in Page No 33 of 46 transit areas and also acted as a disincentive to keep the
goods in the premises of the Board for a long time, thereby increasing the demurrage charges
substantially with passage of time.
73. The Court further held that the High Court there was in error in holding that the Board's power
to charge demurrage was limited to cases where the goods were not removed from its premises due
to some fault or negligence on the part of the importer.
74. The Court thus held that it was the duty of the Board to recover rates; the Board had a lien on the
goods and the right to seize and detain the goods, until the rates were fully paid and to sell the goods
if the rates were not paid and recover the same. It was held that certain concessions may be given
taking into account the hardship of the importers, but the legality of the rates cannot be questioned.
75. The Court further went on to hold that the importer of the goods was liable to pay the demurrage
charges even if the importer was not responsible for any delay, or any fault could be attributed to
____________ http://www.judis.nic.in Page No 34 of 46 the importer.
76. In International Airports Authority Vs. Grand Slam International, (1995) 3 SCC 151, the Hon’ble
Supreme Court took note of Section 45 of the Customs Act and held as follows:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166036477/ 15
M/S.Qatar Airways vs Commissioner Of Customs (Air) on 19 May, 2020
“41. None of these provisions entitles the Collector of Customs to debar the collection
of demurrage for the storage of imported goods. They do not entitle him to impose
conditions upon the proprietors of ports or airports before they can be approved as
customs ports or customs airports. Section 45 provides that all imported goods
imported in a customs area must remain in the custody of the person who has been
approved by the Collector of Customs until they are cleared and such person is
obliged not to permit them to be removed from the customs area or otherwise dealt
with except under and in accordance with the permission of the Customs Officer.
Section 45 does not state that such person shall not be entitled to recover charges
from the importer for such period as the Customs Authorities direct.
42. The purpose of the Customs Act on the one hand and the Major Port Trusts Act
and the International Airports Authority Act on the other hand are different. The
former deals with the collection of customs duties on imported goods. The latter
deals with the maintenance of seaports and airports, the facilities to be provided
thereat and the charges to be recovered therefore. An importer must land the
imported goods at a seaport or airport. He can clear them only after completion of
Customs formalities.
For this purpose, the seaports and airports are ____________ http://www.judis.nic.in Page No
35 of 46 approved and provide storage facilities and Customs Officers are accommodated therein to
facilitate clearance. For the occupation by the imported goods of space in the seaport or airport, the
Board or the Authority which is its proprietor is entitled to charge the importer. That until Customs
clearance, the Board or the Authority may not permit the importer to remove his goods from its
premises, does not imply that it may not charge the importer for the space his goods have occupied
until their clearance.
***
44. It cannot be gainsaid that, by reason of unjustified detention of his goods by the Customs
Authorities, the importer is put to loss by having to pay demurrage charges for the periods of such
detention. The Central Government is empowered by Section 35 of the International Airports
Authority Act, 1971 and Section 111 of the Major Port Trusts Act, 1963 to issue to the Authority and
the Board of Trustees, respectively, directions on questions of policy after giving them an
opportunity, as far as practicable, of expressing their views. The Central Government can, if so
advised, after giving to the Authority and the Board of Trustees the opportunity of expressing their
views, direct them, under the aforementioned provisions, not to levy demurrage charges for periods
covered by detention certificates.”
80.Hon’ble Venkatachala, J. as he was then in his concurring judgment, after referring to the
various judgments of the Court cited held as follows;- “66. From the above decisions of this Court it
becomes clear that an authority created under a statute even if is the custodian of the imported
goods because of the provisions of the Customs Act, 1961, would be entitled to charge demurrages
for the ____________ http://www.judis.nic.in Page No 36 of 46 imported goods in its custody
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166036477/ 16
M/S.Qatar Airways vs Commissioner Of Customs (Air) on 19 May, 2020
and make the importer or consignee liable for the same even for periods during which he/it was
unable to clear the goods from the customs area, due to fault on the part of the Customs Authorities
or of other authorities who might have issued detention certificates owning such fault.
***
69. Therefore, my answer to the question considered by me is in the negative i.e. the Collector of
Customs empowered under sub-section (1) of Section 45 of the Customs Act, 1962 to approve
persons to be custodians of imported goods in customs areas until they are cleared as provided for
therein, while approving the International Airports Authority of India to be the custodian of such
imported goods in the customs area of Indira Gandhi International Airport, New Delhi and Central
Warehousing Corporation to be the custodians of such imported goods received at the customs
area—the Container Freight Station, CWC Complex, Pragati Maidan, New Delhi, by issue of public
notice or otherwise in that regard, if by such notice or otherwise directs such custodians not to
collect custody charges from the consignees of such goods—“the Cargo”, because of detention
certificates issued by him or his delegatee, will not be acting within the powers conferred upon him
under the Act, its Rules or its Regulations and hence directions given by the Customs Collector or
his delegatees to release the goods of importers or consignees without collecting demurrage charges
from them cannot be enforced by courts either against IAAI or CWC.” This Court clearly held that
Section 45 of the Customs Act did not, in any manner, affect the rights of the International Airport
Authority to collect charges from the importer.

77. In Mumbai Port Trust Vs. Shri Lakshmi Steels, 2017 (352) E.L.T.401 (S.C) : (2018) 14 SCC 317,
the Hon’ble Supreme Court held as follows:-
32. Assuming for the purpose of the decision of this case that Mumbai Port Trust is a
custodian or cargo service provider, the question that arises is whether these
Regulations apply to the Mumbai Port Trust.
These Regulations have been framed under Section 157 of the Customs Act. Section 160(9) of the
Customs Act clearly lays down that nothing in the Act shall affect the power of the Port Authority in
a major port, as defined in the Indian Major Port Trusts Act, 1963. It is not disputed before us that
the Mumbai Port Trust is a major port.
33. As already explained hereinabove, the Mumbai Port Trust has the power and authority to levy
rates including demurrage as fixed by the Tariff Authority under Section 47-A of the Act. This right
of the Port Trust is not affected either by the provisions of the Customs Act or by the 2009
Regulations. Section 160(9) of the Customs Act clearly lays down that the provisions of the Customs
Act shall not in any manner affect the constitution and powers of any Port Authority in a major port.
This will include the right of the Major Port Authority that is a Major Port Trust to levy and charge
rates and demurrage.

34. [Ed.: Para 34 corrected vide Official Corrigendum No. F.3/Ed.B.J./123/2017 dated 23-3- 2018.]
As far as the 2009* Regulations are concerned, these are the Regulations framed under the Customs
Act. Regulations are in the nature of subordinate legislation. There can be no manner of doubt that
____________ http://www.judis.nic.in Page No 38 of 46 subordinate legislation that too a
legislation framed by a Board under the Customs Act cannot in any manner affect the power and
authority of the Major Port Trust statutorily vested in it.
35. Neither the Regulations nor can the provisions of the Customs Act impinge or in any manner
affect the statutory power of the Major Port Trusts to levy rates under the Act. In fact, the Authority
that framed the Regulations was itself aware of this because Regulation 6(1)(l) itself begins with the
words “subject to any other law for the time being in force”. It is, therefore, obvious that the
Regulations are subject to any other law including the Major Port Trusts Act. Therefore, these
Regulations cannot in any manner affect the right of the Port Trust. We are, therefore, of the view
that the High Court erred in holding that the law settled by this Court in a catena of judgments
referred to above was no longer applicable in view of the 2009 Regulations. Reliance placed by the
Union of India on Section 128 of the Major Port Trusts Act is totally misplaced. This provision only
deals with the right of the Central Government to collect customs duties. It does not deal with the
rights of the Port Trust to collect rates including demurrage.
36. The next issue which arises is whether any direction could be issued to the DRI/Customs
Authorities to pay the demurrage charges to the Port Trust and the detention charges to the
shipping line.
37. We have already referred to a number of decisions wherein the law has been clearly laid down
that even if the importer is not at fault, it is the importer alone who is liable to pay the demurrage
charges. As far as detention charges are concerned, this is a private contract between the importer
and the carrier i.e. shipping line. The DRI/Customs Authorities can be directed to pay the
demurrage/detention charges only when it has proved that the action of the DRI/Customs
Authorities is absolutely mala fide or is such a gross ____________ http://www.judis.nic.in Page
No 39 of 46 abuse of power that the officials of the DRI/Customs should be asked to compensate the
importer for the extra burden which he has to bear. Even if an importer feels that it has been
unjustly dealt with, it must clear the goods by paying the charges due and then claim reimbursement
from the Customs Authority. * Handling of Cargo in Customs Areas Regulation, 2009.
78. The Hon’ble Supreme Court while giving the above decision has however not considered the
provisions of the Airport Authority of India (Storage and Processing of Cargo, Courier and Express
Goods and Postal Mail) Regulations, 2003. Perhaps the Hon’ble Supreme Court may have come to a
different conclusion if it had considered the 2003 Regulation.
79. Para 34 of the above decision has practically rendered Regulation 6 of the Handling of Cargo in
Customs Area Regulations, 2009 otiose by holding that the said Regulation framed under the
Customs Act was in the nature of subordinate legislation and there can be no manner of doubt that
such subordinate legislation framed by the Board under the Customs Act cannot in any manner
affect the power and ____________ http://www.judis.nic.in Page No 40 of 46 authority of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166036477/ 18
M/S.Qatar Airways vs Commissioner Of Customs (Air) on 19 May, 2020
Major Port Trust statutorily vested in it.
80. The Court thus followed its earlier decision in International Airport Authority of India vs. Grand
Slam International [1995 (77) ELT 753 SC] and Trustees of Port of Madras vs. Nagavedu Lungi &
Co., [1995 (80) ELT 241 SC].
81. If one were to go by the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Mubai Port Trust (cited supra)
strictly in the question of issue of “Detention Certificate” which was in vogue prior to Handling of
Cargo in Customs Area Regulations, 2009 is of no significance any longer. However, that
interpretation would militate in the light of Regulation 6 of the Airport Authority of India (Storage
and Processing of Cargo, Courier and Express Goods and Postal Mail) Regulations, 2003. Therefore,
this Court is not inclined to hold that such certificate can be issued at all.
82. The authorities under the Airport Authority Act, 1994 require ____________
http://www.judis.nic.in Page No 41 of 46 certificate from the Customs for granting waiver from
payment of demurrage under the policy framed under Regulation 6 of the Airport Authority of India
(Storage and Processing of Cargo, Courier and Express Goods and Postal Mail) Regulations, 2003.
83. In fact, such certificate need not be confined to the circumstances specified in Public Notice
No.111 of 1985 dated 29.07.1985 of the Bombay Custom House alone. It can be issued in appropriate
case to cover the circumstances specified in the Policy of the Airport Authority as per Regulation 6 of
the Airport Authority of India (Storage and Processing of Cargo, Courier and Express Goods and
Postal Mail) Regulations, 2003 as was noted in Trip Communication Pvt. Ltd. (cited supra) by the
Delhi High Court.
84. As far as the present case is concerned, since none of the circumstances noted by the Delhi High
Court in Trip Communication Private Limited Vs. Union of India are attracted, the question of the
1st respondent issuing such certificate to the petitioner for the petitioner to claim waiver does not
arise. Therefore, to that extent the 1 st respondent ____________ http://www.judis.nic.in Page
No 42 of 46 was justified in denying “Detention Certificate” to the petitioner.
85. Though, it is not the case of the abuse by the officers of the Customs, there are sufficient
indications to show that there was a complete disruption of service at the Air Cargo Complex during
the relevant period due to alleged arrest of the officers. In absence of the officers to receive the
transshipment application, there could have been total disruption and no application was received
which perhaps may have led to the delay.
86. If there were no proper officers or there were only few officers to handle the workload due to
alleged arrest and the delay in receiving the transshipment application for being processed by the 1st
respondent should not be at the cost of the petitioner. If indeed there was a complete breakdown
due to alleged arrest and resulted in disruption of the operations at the Air Cargo Complex, the
petitioner should be compensated as such delay cannot be attributed by the petitioner. This would
require proper facts being established by the petitioner. ____________ http://www.judis.nic.in

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166036477/ 19
M/S.Qatar Airways vs Commissioner Of Customs (Air) on 19 May, 2020
87. Therefore, this aspect would require proper verification. Issue is therefore left open for the
petitioner to establish that Customs Department is liable to compensate the petitioner in the light of
the observation of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Mumbai Port Trust Vs. Shri Lakshmi Steels, 2017
(352) E.L.T.401 (S.C) : (2018) 14 SCC 317.
88. The petitioner may therefore establish before the 1st respondent that there was total or near
total disruption of work due to alleged arrest of the customs officers and therefore, there was delay
in receiving and processing of transshipment application and therefore the petitioner is entitled to
compensation.
89. The 1st respondent also will have all the official information and details on this aspect. I am
therefore inclined to remit the case back to the 1st respondent to pass appropriate orders after
taking all the factors into account. The petitioner may independently substantiate the allegations
before the 1st respondent with necessary documents.
90. The 1st respondent may clearly state whether indeed any of its ____________
http://www.judis.nic.in Page No 44 of 46 officers stationed at the Air Cargo Complex for the
purpose of processing the transshipment application were arrested as was claimed by the petitioner
and whether such arrest resulted in disruption of operation at the Air Cargo Complex. If so, the
petitioner shall be compensated.
91. The 1st respondent is therefore directed to pass appropriate orders within a period of three
months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order. Meanwhile, the petitioner is directed to pay
the amounts that are due to the 3rd and the 4th respondents.
92. This Writ Petition stands disposed with the above directions. No cost. Consequently, connected
