COMMON ORDER
These Criminal Original Petitions have been filed, invoking Section 482 Cr.P.C., seeking orders to
call for the records in Cr.No.202 of 2015 pending on the file of the first respondent and quash the
same. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.(MD)Nos.8450 of 2018 and 17454 of 2019
2. The petitioner in Crl.O.P.(MD)No.8450 of 2018 is the fourth accused and the petitioners in
Crl.O.P.(MD)No.17454 of 2019 are the accused Nos.3, 6 and 7 in Cr.No.202 of 2015, pending on the
file of the first respondent police.
3. The case of the prosecution is that on 14.02.2015, which was Valentine's Day, at about 03.00p.m.,
nearly 10 persons entered into Rajaji Children's Park belonging to the Madurai Corporation without
buying tickets, that when a staff of the park was restraining them, they indulged in quarrel with him,
that when the second respondent/defacto complainant questioned the same, 4 persons among them
strangulated his right hand, that Women Constables who were posted for security came to rescue
him, that the above said persons abused the Women Constables in filthy language and one among
them shoved her by pushing on her chest, that when the Sub-Inspector of Police came to the place, 3
among them, scaled the wall of the Park and fled away and that 7 persons issued life threat to the
Women Constables and ran away. On the basis of the complaint lodged by the second respondent,
F.I.R. came to be registered in Cr.No.202 of 2015 for the alleged offences under Sections 147,
294(b), 341, 353, 354, 506(i) I.P.C., and Section 4 of TNPHW Act.

K.Arunkumar vs State Represented By on 7 December, 2021
4. The learned Counsel for the petitioners would contend that the impugned F.I.R., was registered
on 14.02.2015 for the alleged offences 147, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.(MD)Nos.8450
of 2018 and 17454 of 2019 294(b), 341, 353, 354, 506(i) I.P.C., and Section 4 of TNPHW Act, for
which the maximum prescribed sentence is upto 3 years and as such, the failure on the part of the
first respondent in completing the investigation and filed final report, which resulted in non-taking
of cognizance by the trial Court, has ultimately lead to the above case being barred by the period of
limitation under section 468(2) Cr.P.C., and as such, the impugned F.I.R., is liable to be quashed on
this ground alone.
5. The learned Counsel for the petitioners would further submit that the petitioners were students of
Law College at that time, that they have completed Law Course at Madurai Law College and already
obtained Degree from the Tamil Nadu Dr.Ambedkar Law University, that the Bar Council of Tamil
Nadu and Pondicherry has negated to permit them to enroll as Advocates owing to the reason of
pendency of the impugned F.I.R., against them and this Court at the time of admission has granted
an order of interim stay.
6. As rightly contended by the learned Government Advocate (Crl.Side) appearing for the first
respondent, the allegations and the charges levelled against the petitioners are serious. As already
pointed out, the petitioners have abused the Women Constables on duty in filthy language and also
one of them shoved one Constable by pushing on her chest and that is why F.I.R., came to be
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.(MD)Nos.8450 of 2018 and 17454 of 2019 registered also
for the offences 353, 354 I.P.C., and Section 4 of TNPHW Act. But the main point that was
canvassed by the learned Counsel for the petitioners is with respect to limitation under Sections 468
and 473 Cr.P.C.
7. It is necessary to refer the judgment of a learned Judge of this Court in Crl.O.P.(MD)No.18775 of
2021, dated 07.12.2021 in Thinakaran and Others Vs. State represented by the Inspector of Police,
Tirunelveli Junction Police Station and another and the relevant passage is extracted hereunder:
“6. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioners drew my attention the decision
reported in 1987 Cri LJ 360 (Kathamuthu V. Balammal). The Hon'ble Division Bench
was called upon to answer the question as to whether the launching of a criminal
prosecution after the lapse of the period of limitation prescribed under Section 468 of
Cr.P.C, can the Court condone the delay after taking cognizance of the offences or
whether such condonation of delay should precede the taking cognizance of the
offences. In the aforesaid Judgment, the Hon'ble Division Bench categorically
answered and held that any proceeding culminating in the conviction of a person in a
criminal case, the cognizance of which has been taken after the expiry of the period of
limitation as prescribed under Section 468(2) of Cr.P.C. without first resorting to
Section 473 of Cr.P.C., is non est in the eye of law. The decision reported in 1978
Cri.L.J.116 (Sulochana V. State Registrar of Chits, Madras) was specifically
disapproved.” https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.(MD)Nos.8450 of 2018 and

8. Another learned Judge of this Court in D.Senthilkumar Vs. The Inspector of Police, Prohibition
Enforcement Wing, T.Nagar Unit, M.G.R.Nagar Police Station, Chennai – 600 083,
(Crl.O.P.No.4307 of 2017, dated 09.09.2020) has held as follows:
“7. Considering the rival submissions, it is seen that FIR was registered on
25.06.2015 on the same day the vehicle was seized for offence under Section 4(1)(a)
Tamil Nadu Prohibition Act, 1937, for this offence the imprisonment is fixed for a
term which may extended to three months or with fine which may extended to one
thousand. As per Section 468(2) of Cr.P.C, the period of limitation for filing final
report expires on or before 24.06.2016. Auto which was seized was ordered to be
returned to the petitioner in C.M.P.No. 4384 of 2015 by order dated 26.11.2015 by
XXIII Magistrate Court, Saidapet, Chennai, against which Crl.RC.No.74 of 2015 was
filed by the respondent Police before the Additional Sessions Judge, Chennai. It is
seen that the Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police sent notice for confiscating
the Vehicle on 08.10.2015, since the owner of the vehicle failed to make any objection
the vehicle was confiscated and is in custody PEW unit and from 26.11.2015 to
31.07.2018 revision case was pending. It is seen that the respondent had filed the
original documents during enquiry before them Additional Session Court, Chennai
and due to which the charge sheet which was made ready on 21.09.2016, could not be
filed before the concerned Magistrate Court. This is an explanation offered by the
learned counsel for the respondent. There is no reason given why after disposal of
criminal revision on 13.07.2018 till date the charge sheet is yet to
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.(MD)Nos.8450 of 2018 and 17454 of 2019
be filed and numbered. Though as per 470 of Cr.P.C, exclusion of time in certain
cases are available, in this case no such grounds are available. Further, no petition or
reason given seeking condonation of delay as per Section 473 Cr.P.C is made. The
valuable right accrued to an accused person cannot be allowed to be taken away
except by strictly satisfying the conditions prescribed under Section 473 Cr.P.C. In
any case, the exercise of power under Section 473 Cr.P.C., extending the period of
limitation by condoning the delay in launching prosecution should precede the taking
cognizance of the offence. This Court following the case of “Kathamuthu Versus
Balammal reported in 1985 Crl.L.J 360”, finds the facts of the case no cognisance
would be taken in Criminal No.205 of 2015 since it would be bar beyond the period of
limitation. In view of the same the proceedings in Crime No.205 of 2015 is quashed.
9. In the said judgment, the learned Judge has specifically held that valuable right accrued to an
accused person cannot be allowed to be taken away except by strictly satisfying the conditions
prescribed under Section 473 Cr.P.C. The above decisions are squarely applicable to the case on
hand. In the present case, admittedly F.I.R. came to be registered on 14.02.2015. As rightly
contended by the learned Counsel for the petitioners, the maximum punishment for the offences
under which the petitioners are charged, is upto 3 years and hence, the period of limitation as
contemplated under Section 468 Cr.P.C., for laying the final report will be 3 years. The fourth
accused has filed the petition https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.(MD)Nos.8450 of 2018 and
17454 of 2019 on 15.05.2018 and whereas the other accused Nos.3, 6 and 7 have filed the petition on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64687686/ 4
K.Arunkumar vs State Represented By on 7 December, 2021
14.11.2019. Admittedly, the charge sheet has not been filed till 15.05.2018. This Court, at the time of
admission of the first Criminal Original Petition, by observing that the delay would only be termed
as inordinate, has granted the order of interim stay of the proceedings. Thereafter, the accused
Nos.3, 6 and 7 have filed the second petition and also obtained interim order.
10. When the matter was taken up on 18.11.2021, considering the submission made by the learned
Government Advocate(Crl.Side) that final report has already been filed before the Court of the
Judicial Magistrate No.II, Madurai, this Court directed the Registry to get a report from the learned
Judicial Magistrate No.II, as to the stage of the case in Cr.No.202 of 2015, on the file of the first
respondent. In pursuance of the same, the learned Judicial Magistrate No.II, Madurai has submitted
a report dated 03.12.2021 stating that the case in Cr.No.202 of 2015 is not pending before that Court
and the same is pending before the Additional Mahila Court (Magisterial Level), Madurai. The
learned Judicial Magistrate, Additional Mahila Court has also submitted a report stating that no
final report has been filed before that Court till date in Cr.No.202 of 2015.
11. As already pointed out, though some of the charges laid against the petitioners are serious as
stated by the learned Government Advocate (Crl.Side), https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
Crl.O.P.(MD)Nos.8450 of 2018 and 17454 of 2019 this Court is at loss to understand as to why such
a case was kept pending in FIR stage itself and charge sheet has not been filed for more than 3 years
since the registration of the case. Even now, the first respondent has not offered any acceptable
reason or explanation for inordinate delay.
12. As rightly held by the learned Single Judge in the second decision above cited, the right accrued
to the accused person, by not filing the final report within the limitation period, cannot be allowed
to be defeated except by strictly satisfying the conditions prescribed under Section 473 Cr.P.C.
Moreover, it is not the case of the first respondent that any petition seeking condonation of delay
under Section 473 Cr.P.C., was made. Considering the above, this Court has no hesitation to hold
that the impugned proceedings are liable to be quashed.
13. In the result, both the Criminal Original Petitions are allowed and the impugned proceedings in
Cr.No.202 of 2015, pending on the file of the first respondent are quashed. The benefit of this order
will enure in favour of the non- petitioning accused also. Consequently, the connected Miscellaneous
Petition is closed.
