3. Earlier, an application U/s 30901 of 2024 was filed by the applicants, wherein on 19.11.2024, the
following order was passed:-
"Heard learned counsel for the applicants, Mr. Akhilesh Kumar Srivastava, learned
A.G.A. for the State and perused the record.
The present 482 Cr.P.C. application has been filed to quash the charge sheet dated
21.01.2022 as well as summoning order dated 15.04.2023 including entire criminal
proceedings in Case No. 429 of 2023 (State v. Arpit Agrawal and others), arising out
of Case Crime No. 450 of 2021, under Sections 498A, 323, 504, 506, 354A IPC and
3/4 D.P. Act, in the court of Civil Judge CD (FTC) ACJM, Bareilly, Police Station
Subhash Nagar, Bareilly, on the basis of compromise.
Learned counsel for the parties submit that the parties have amicably settled their
dispute out of Court and have entered into compromise. In this regard, an affidavit
on behalf of both the parties has been moved before the Court concerned mentioning
therein that they have entered into compromise and they do not want to press the
case, copy of said compromise has been annexed as Annexure no.5 to this
application. Therefore, no useful purpose would be served in continuing the
proceedings before the court below and the same is not only sheer wastage of time of
the Court but also abuse of the process of law. Hence, proceedings of the aforesaid
case be quashed in the light of law laid down by the Apex Court in the case of Gian
Singh v. State of Punjab reported in (2012) 10 SCC 303.
Learned AGA, however, submits that it is the concerned court below, which has to
verify the fact as to whether the parties have entered into compromise, hence the
applicants may approach the concerned court below and move an application with
respect to compromise between the parties, which will be decided in accordance with
law.
In view of the above, both the parties are directed to appear before the court below
along with a certified copy of this order and permitted to file a proper compromise
deed. It is expected that the trial court may fix a date for the verification of the
compromise and after ensuring the presence of parties, pass an appropriate order
with respect to the same in accordance with law, as expeditiously as possible,
preferably within a period of two months from today. While passing the order
verifying the compromise, the concerned court shall also record the statement of the
parties as to whether all the terms and conditions mentioned in the original
compromise deed, so filed, have been fulfilled or not.
The court in that scenario will allow the parties to obtain certified copy of the order
verifying the compromise deed and it will be open to the applicants to approach this
Court again for quashing of the proceedings.

has been explained in detail.
