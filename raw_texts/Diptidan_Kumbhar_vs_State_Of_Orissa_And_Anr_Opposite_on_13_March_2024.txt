(iii) The parties are in a litigating term in a divorce proceeding M.A.T Case No.01/01
of 2012-13 filed by the husband which has been dismissed. Challenging the said
judgment, appeal (MATA) filed before this Court is subjudice.
(iv) It is submitted that only to give criminal colour to a civil and matrimonial
dispute, the Opposite Party No.2/wife has filed the criminal case. The intention of the
Opposite Party No.2 is attended with mala fide and actuated by ulterior motive in
order to wreak vengeance against the present Petitioner. The ingredients of the
aforesaid offences are not attracted against the present Petitioner and it does not
meet the strict standard of proof required to sustain a criminal accusation. The
Opposite Party No.2 being a woman constable and in connivance of her Advocate
brother has filed this false case with concocted allegations only to harass the
Petitioner which should be deprecated and discouraged. The criminal proceeding
against the Petitioner as well as the order of cognizance is bad in law and warrants
interference by this Court.

aforesaid fact, but submits that after receipt of charge sheet, the Signature

(1)(x) SC and ST (PA) Act are not applicable in this case.
7. It was submitted that the informant-wife being a woman constable and in connivance of her

filing of written notes of submissions by the learned counsel for the Parties. On 5th February, 2024,
nobody appeared for the Opposite Party No.2. Again, this matter was posted to 15th February, 2024
for filing of written notes of submissions by the learned counsel for the Opposite Party No.2.
However, in spite of repeated call, nobody appeared for the Opposite Party No.2 on 15th February,
2024.
9. The above-mentioned conduct of the Opposite Party No.2 shows that the Opposite Party No.2 is a
recalcitrant litigant which has been substantiated the fact that she has filed the aforesaid criminal
cases including the present case only to harass the Petitioner.

Party No.2, it appear to this Court that the allegation of the prosecution is without any substance

passed by the learned S.D.J.M., Titilagarh in G.R. Case No.163 of 2015 is set aside. Consequently,
the prosecution against the Petitioner in G.R. Case No.163 of 2015 pending in the court of learned
S.D.J.M., Titilagarh stands quashed. The court concerned on receipt or production of the certified
copy of this order, shall do well to drop the aforesaid proceeding against the Petitioner.
