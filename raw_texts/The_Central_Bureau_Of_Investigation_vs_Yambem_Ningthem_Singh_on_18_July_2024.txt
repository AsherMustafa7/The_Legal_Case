The Central Bureau Of Investigation ... vs Yambem Ningthem Singh on 18 July, 2024
Special Judge (P.C.), Imphal West praying to allow the present
respondent to travel abroad (Abu Dhabi), for 20 days for treatment of
Pancreatic Cancer and the same was granted by the Ld. Special Judge
(P.C) Imphal West, without considering the fact that, inter alia, despite
no document indicating that, the accused has been treated with cancer.
[5] The genesis leading to the filling of this Criminal Petition
are as follows:
On 02.02.2024, the respondent/accused filed a Criminal
Miscellaneous Case No. 12 of 2024 u/s 439 of Cr.P.C before the Ld.
Special Judge (PC Act), Imphal West, Manipur praying for granting
permission to leave India for 20 days from the date of order for medical
treatment at Cleveland Clinic, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. In that
regard, the petitioner (respondent in the Cril. Misc. Case No. 12 of 2024)
filed an objection to the Cril. Misc. Application praying to reject the
aforesaid application in the interest of justice.
After hearing both the parties, the Ld. Special Judge (PC),
Imphal West, Manipur, vide its order dated 07.02.2024, directed the
petitioner (CBI) (respondent in the Cril. Misc. Application) to place a
report/proposal before it for any possible arrangement in consultation
with appropriate authority, if in the event, consideration of the
petitioner's prayer, for treatment at Cleveland Clinic, Abu Dhabi, UAE,
Criminal Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 4
becomes a necessity. The petitioner (CBI) was also directed to highlight
possible arrangement for securing vigil over the respondent (petitioner in
the Cril. Misc. Application), during his stay at Abu Dhabi, UAE.
Accordingly, the petitioner (CBI) filed a written report pursuant to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88096805/ 4
The Central Bureau Of Investigation ... vs Yambem Ningthem Singh on 18 July, 2024
order dated 07.02.2024 praying for dismissing the aforesaid Cril. Misc.
Case No. 12 of 2024, after exploring all the possibilities of such
arrangement by CBI thereby taking up the matter with the International
Police Cooperation Unit i.e. IPCU, New Delhi.
After having perused all the documents placed on record
and after hearing the submissions of both the parties at length, vide order
dated 28.02.2024, the Ld. Special Judge (PC), Imphal West, Manipur
granted the prayer of the respondent (petitioner in the Cril. Misc.
Application) and he was allowed to leave India for a period of 20 days
from that day, on his furnishing Bond of Rs. 5,00,000/- (Rupees five laksh
only), which was to be deposited with the Nazir of Ld. Special Judge (PC),
Imphal West Manipur in cash, and to report back on 18.03.2024.
[6] As per the learned counsel for the petitioner, the amount
involved in the case, as per the FIR, is Rs. 518.69 Crores approx, and the
investigation of this case has so far revealed, that during the relevant
period, the respondent\accused is the Project Director of Manipur
Development Society (MDS) and Executive Head of MDS.
Further, the learned Sr. PCCG submits that after
investigation, the investigating agency has filed its first charge sheet in
this case before the Hon'ble Court of Special Judge (P.C.) Imphal West
Criminal Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 5
against the Respondent accused U/s 120-B r/w Section 420, 467, 468,
471 IPC and Section 13 (2) r/w 13(1)(c) & (d) of Prevention of Corruption
Act, 1988 and substantive offence punishable U/s 420, 467, 468, 471 IPC
and Section 13 (2) r/w 13(1)(c) & (d) of Prevention of Corruption Act,
1988 for having caused an undue wrongful loss of Rs. 19.32 Crores
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88096805/ 5
The Central Bureau Of Investigation ... vs Yambem Ningthem Singh on 18 July, 2024
Approx. to the public exchequer and undue wrongful gain to himself in
criminal conspiracy with other accused persons in the matter of non-
execution of various projects in respect of which funds were released for
MDS by Secretariat Planning Department, Government of Manipur/Govt.
of India and the same were diverted at the behest of the accused
respondent and siphoned off.
[7] The learned senior PCCG further submits that the present
application filed by the respondent/accused before the Ld. Special Judge
(PC), Imphal West, Manipur for permission to travel to Abu Dhabi for a
period of 20 days for his treatment at Cleveland Clinic, Abu Dhabi, UAE
stated that he is suspected to be having pancreatic cancer whereas as
per the earlier two applications filed by and dismissed by Ld. Trial Court,
he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. In view of the contradictory
stand in the applications of the respondent/accused, the petitioner (CBI)
made a prayer to the Ld. Trial Court that a board of doctors of AIIMS,
New Delhi may be constituted in order to ascertain whether the
respondent/accused is diagnosed with Pancreatic Cancer or not and
whether he can be provided appropriate medical treatment for the same
in India or not.
Criminal Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 6
[8] Ld. sr. PCCG further submits that one charge sheet has
already been filed against the respondent/accused and others in this case
and the further investigation of this case involving numerous projects is
at a very crucial stage and further looking to the desperation of the
respondent/accused to somehow leave the country, it is strongly
apprehend that if the respondent/accused is allowed to go abroad, he,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88096805/ 6
The Central Bureau Of Investigation ... vs Yambem Ningthem Singh on 18 July, 2024
being the mastermind of this fraud, will never return to face the trial and
the remaining investigation and trail may be hampered.
[9] The learned senior PCCG further submits that as per order
dated 07.02.2024 of the Ld. Special Judge (PC), Imphal West, Manipur a
report was submitted before the Ld. Special Judge (PC), Imphal West,
Manipur stating that vide letter dated 12.02.2024 of the International
Police Cooperation Unit (IPCU), New Delhi, intimated in writing that in
the absence of any Extradition Request or Provisional Arrest request as
per Extradition Treaty between Government of the Republic of India and
the United Arab Emirates (UAE),the movements of the subject in UAE
would not normally be curtailed or monitored in UAE. Further, no
assurance could be provided that UAE Authorities would keep vigil over
the subject. Further, the matter may be consulted with MEA and MHA.
In view of the aforementioned communication from
National Central Bureau - India, Interpol New Delhi the petitioner (CBI)
informed the Ld. Trial Court that it will not be possible for CBI to make
arrangement for carrying out the medical treatment of the
Criminal Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 7
Respondent/accused at Abu Dhabi because the said city is outside the
territorial jurisdiction of India.
[10] When the matter was taken up on 07.03.2024, the
proceeding of the order dated 28.02.2024 passed in Cril. Misc. Case No.
12 of 2024 by the Ld. Special Judge (PC), Imphal West, Manipur was
stayed till the next date of hearing.

26 of the present Cril. Petn. are extracted herein below:
"18. That, the petitioner begs to submit that, the Respondent
accused is relying on the discharge certificate of Care and Cure
Hospital which has opined that best treatment can be given by
the US hospital which earlier treated him. However, it is an
interesting fact that there is no material on record to show that
the Respondent accused has earlier been treated by any US
Hospital including Cleveland Clinic as the enclosed schedule of
the said clinic which dates back to 30.04.2010 mentions the
name of department as Urology which does not appear to be the
department treating pancreatic disease which in this case should
be Gastroenterology.
19. That, the petitioner begs to submit that, even if it is assumed
for the sake of argument, that the Respondent accused was
diagnosed with Pancreatic Cancer and underwent treatment for
the same in aforementioned USA Clinic in 2010, it is not clarified
as to what is the medical expertise of the said clinic in treating
pancreatic cancer which distinguishes itself from the medical
expertise in treating such disease as available in India.
..........
26. That, the petitioner begs to submit that, as per the application filed before the Ld. Special Judge
(PC), Imphal West, the Respondent/accused stated that, he is suspected to be having pancreatic
cancer whereas as per the earlier two applications filed by him and dismissed by Ld Trial Court, he
was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. In view of the contradictory stand in the applications of the
accused, prayer was made to Ld. Trail Court that a board of doctors of AIIMS, New Delhi may be
constituted in order to ascertain whether the Respondent accused is diagnosed with Pancreatic
cancer or not and whether he can be provided appropriate medical treatment for the same in India
or not."
Criminal Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 8
[11] Mr. N. Ibotombi, learned senior counsel submitted counter
affidavit on behalf of the respondent stating that till a Court of law has given a finding that the
accused is guilty of the charges levelled against him, in the eye of law, it shall be presumed that the
accused is still innocent.
Learned senior counsel, further, submits that the deponent filed a Misc. Case before the Ld. Special
Judge (PC Act.), Imphal West, Manipur seeking permission to leave the Country for his medical
treatment. The said Misc. Application was rejected by the Ld. Special Judge mainly on the ground
that the deponent has not pursued the matter diligently. Another Misc. Application being Cril. Misc.
Case No. 127 of 2023 was filed by the deponent for granting permission to leave India for medical
treatment and the Hon'ble Court, vide order dated 05.10.2023, dismissed the said Misc. Application
only the ground that the chronic pancreatitis is generally temporary in nature and the person will
often fully recover within a few days.

The Central Bureau Of Investigation ... vs Yambem Ningthem Singh on 18 July, 2024
[12] Mr. N. Ibotombi, learned senior counsel further submitted that the deponent purchased an Air
Ticket and a boarding pass being EK517 dated 05.03.2024 for medical treatment at Cleveland Clinic,
Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. He, further, submits that the passport being No. L9610484 dated
17.07.2014 issued at Guwahati in favour of the deponent was seized at the Indian Immigration
Control, Indira Gandhi International Airport, New Delhi on 05.03.2024 on the ground that "DRIS
status of passport was impounded. Hence, the passport was seized and Criminal Petition No. 19 of
2024 Page 9 sent to concern RPO through FRRO Delhi". Because of the seizure of the passport, the
deponent could not leave India for his medical treatment. As the passport of the deponent was
impounded, the deponent contacted the Regional Passport Office at Guwahati and after processing
the file, a new Passport was issued in favour of the deponent. Because of the seizure of the Passport
and also in view of the order dated 07.03.2024 passed in M.C. (Cril. Petn.) No. 17 of 2024, the
deponent could not leave India for medical treatment at Cleveland Clinic, Abu Dhabi, United Arab
Emirates.
[13] Mr. N. Ibotombi, learned senior counsel further submits that the application filed by the
deponent for seeking permission to leave India for medical treatment at Cleveland Clinic was
rejected by the Ld. Special Judge (PC Act), Imphal West, Manipur, vide order dated 05.10.2023 in
Cril. Misc. Case No. 127 of 2023 only on the ground that acute chronic pancreatitis is generally
temporary in nature and the person will often fully recover within a few days. As the ailment of the
deponent has been diagnosed as Acute on Chronic Pancreatitis, Hepatic Encephalopathy
grade-I-Recovered, Decompesated CLD with Protal Hypertensionby the doctor who attended the
deponent, it is submitted that Pancreatic Cancer (PC) is one of the most lethal decease with an
incidence rate almost equal of the rate of mortality Chronic Pancreatitis (CP) is a common chronic
inflammatory.
Criminal Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 10
[14] Mr. N. Ibotombi, learned sr. counsel further submits that it
is well settled that the right to travel abroad has been interpreted within the scope of fundamental
right to personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. In Parvez Noordin
Lokhandwall -Vs- State of Maharashtra, the Hon'ble Apex Court held that the right of an accused to
travel abroad is a valuable one and integral part of the right to personal liberty. Further, it is well
settled that an accused can be granted this liberty on the ground of medical necessity, where they
would be required to travel abroad in order to obtain certain medical facilities and treatments.
Denial of travel, in such a scenario, cannot be refused as it may be viewed to be prejudicial to the
health of the accused.
He, further, submits that CBI did not challenge the order dated 05/12/2023 passed in Cril. Misc.
Case No. 213 of 2023 wherein, the Ld. Special Judge (PC Act), Imphal West has given permission to
the applicant to leave India for foreign tour at Singapore and Malaysia. [15] Ld. sr. PCCG submits
written argument in support of his case which is reproduced herein below:
"Main Grounds raised in the instant criminal petition are as follows:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88096805/ 9
The Central Bureau Of Investigation ... vs Yambem Ningthem Singh on 18 July, 2024
1. Not a single document presented by him before the trial Court to establish that he
is diagnosed with pancreatic cancer which he is suspecting based on the medical
certificate of an ordinary hospital called Care & Cure Hospital, Imphal.
Criminal Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 11
2. No document is there to establish that he was earlier treated at Cleveland Clinic
USA for any disease including pancreatic cancer.
3. That, not a single document to show that Cleveland Clinic is having specialization
to treat pancreatic cancer.
4. That, even if it is assumed for the sake of arguments that the accused was treated
at Cleveland Clinic, USA then what is the guarantee that its Abu Dhabi is equally
capable of treating him with same amount of perfection.
5. That, contradictory stands taken by him regarding his disease as in earlier
applications, he was mentioning pancreatic cancer and now, in the present case he is
mentioning suspected of such pancreatic cancer. His earlier two petitions were
dismissed by the Ld. Trial Court on the same grounds.
6. That, despite CBI giving to the Trial Court in writing that CBI cannot maintain vigil
over him in foreign land, the Ld. Trial Court has directed CBI in its impugned order
to ensure the same.
7. That, his disease which is in the realm of suspense can be diagnosed by both
doctors of AIIMS, New Delhi and accordingly, his treatment can be done in India.
8. That, the accused cannot misuse/abused the bail granted to him by the Court.
Referring to the above mentioned grounds, the learned counsel for the petitioner submits that there
is no reasonable grounds/basis to leave India when the facilities for treatment of Criminal Petition
No. 19 of 2024 Page 12 pancreatic cancer is available in India and moreover, his suspected disease of
pancreatic cancer can be ascertain in India. Involvement of accused in the present case in short :-
The amount involved in the case, as per the FIR is Rs.
518.69 crores approx. and the respondent accused was the project Director and
executive Head of MDS who, as the mastermind of this scam, played a pivotal role in
misappropriation and siphoning of crores of Rupees of public money which had been
paid to MDS by various line Depts. For execution of a number of projects, which were
not executed/partially executed. He also issued false utilization certificate and false
physical and financial progress reports in respect of utilization of funds so received
from line Depts. For execution of the concerned projects.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88096805/ 10
The Central Bureau Of Investigation ... vs Yambem Ningthem Singh on 18 July, 2024
The respondent/accused is the charge sheeted accused No.1 in the first charge sheet filed in this case
by CBI for having caused an undue wrongful loss of Rs. 19.32 crores approx. to the public exchequer
and undue wrongful gain to himself in criminal conspiracy with other accused persons in the matter
of non execution of various project in respect of which funds were released for MDS by Secretariat
planning Depts., Govt of Manipur/Govt. of India and same were diverted at the behest of the
accused respondent through various accounts operated by him and siphoned off."
Criminal Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 13
[16] In Manoj Kumar Babulal Punamiya Vs. State of
Jharkhand Tr. Dir of Enforcement - [CRLMP. 5764/2014 in Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal
(Crl.) No(s). 4516/2012], the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed that -
"Upon hearing the counsel the Court made the following order.
Learned counsel for the petitioner/applicant would submit that the petitioner-herein
is suffering from a serious disease. According to him, the same can be treated only by
the Stem Cell Therapy. He further submits that such a therapy is not available in our
country. In aid of his assertion, he has produced several documents issued by the
doctors/hospitals wherein they categorically state that the Stem Cell therapy for the
said disease that the petitioner/applicant is suffering, is not available in our country.
We had given more and sufficient time to Shri R.S. Suri, learned senior counsel for
the respondent-agency to verify and to inform us whether the aforesaid therapy is
available in our country or not. After verification, he submits that the Stem Cell
therapy can only be, as of now, used to treat the cancer patients and not the disease
that the petitioner/applicant is suffering from.
The petitioner/applicant is facing trial under the Money Laundering Act and the trial
is in progress. Since the petitioner/applicant is suffering from a serious ailment and
the Stem Cell Therapy to treat the aforesaid disease is not available in our country, we
permit the petitioner/applicant to go to Singapore where the said Stem Cell Therapy
is available with the following conditions:
1. The petitioner/applicant shall be accompanied by a Sub-Inspector of Police and
two constables named by the respondent-agency.
2. The names of the officers/officials accompanying the petitioner/applicant will be
informed by the respondent-agency to the petitioner/ applicant within a weeks' time
from today.
3. The petitioner/applicant shall bear the travel expenses of the aforesaid
officers/officials to and fro Singapore.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88096805/ 11
The Central Bureau Of Investigation ... vs Yambem Ningthem Singh on 18 July, 2024
4. The petitioner/applicant shall also take the responsibility of boarding and lodging
of the accompanying officers/officials.
Criminal Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 14
5. The petitioner/applicant shall purchase the return tickets for himself and also for
the accompanying officers/officials before leaving this country.
6. After the immigration check, the petitioner/applicant shall handover his passport
to the Sub-Inspector of Police who accompanies him.
7. The petitioner/applicant and accompanying officers/officials shall leave India on
07.10.2014 and shall return back to India on 16.10.2014."
[17] In the instant case, the respondent/petitioner as well as the medical documents filed therein
failed to mention that the petitioner's alleged medical condition i.e. Acute on Chronic Pancreatitis
cannot be treated inside the country. Further, failed to mention that as the disease cannot be treated
inside the country. The patient needs to go outside the country where it can be treated.
[18] In (2020) 10 SCC 77 - [Parvez Noordin Lokhandwalla V. State of Maharashtra & Anr] (Para
Nos. 19 & 26), the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed that -
"19. In Barun Chandra Thakur V. Ryan Augustine Pinto, this Court restored a
condition mandating that the respondent seek prior permission from a competent
Court for travel abroad. The condition, which was originally imposed by the High
Court while granting anticipatory bail was subsequently deleted by it. This Court
made the following observations with respect to imposing restrictions on the
accused's right to travel: (SCC OnLine SC para
9) "9 There could be no gainsaying to that the right to travel abroad is a valuable one
and an integral part of the right to personal liberty. Equally, however, the
pre-condition of securing prior permission before travelling abroad is a crucial
ingredient which undoubtedly was engrafted as a condition for the grant of
anticipatory bail in this case....
At best, the condition for seeking permission before travelling abroad could have been regulated, not
deleted altogether."
Criminal Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 15
*********
26. We accordingly permit the appellant to do so, subject to his furnishing in undertaking to this
Court before the date of travel that he will return to India after the expiry of a period of eight weeks
and that he shall be available on all dates of hearing before the court of criminal jurisdiction, unless
specifically exempted from personal appearance. The undertaking shall be filed in this Court before
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88096805/ 12
The Central Bureau Of Investigation ... vs Yambem Ningthem Singh on 18 July, 2024
the appellant undertakes travel. On the return of the appellant after eight weeks and if it becomes
necessary for him to travel to the US, the appellant shall apply to the court concerned for permission
to travel and any such application shall be considered on its own merits by the competent Court. The
appellant shall travel only upon the grant of permission and subject to the terms imposed. The
passport of the appellant shall be handed over to the appellant to facilitate his travel, subject to the
condition that he shall deposit it with the investigating officer immediately on his return." But, the
respondent accused needs to take permission from the Court before travelling abroad. It is the duty
of the Court to see whether permission sought for is reasonable/genuine or not. [19] Heard the
learned counsels for the parties and also perused the pleadings with the citations relied upon by the
parties and the documents filed therewith.
[20] It is settled principle of law that the right of the accused to travel abroad is valuable one and
integral part of the right to personal liberty and this liberty can be granted on the ground of medical
necessity where they would be required to travel abroad in order to obtain certain medical facilities
and treatment. Denial of travel in such a scenario cannot be refused as it may be viewed to be
prejudicial to the health of accused as observed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Pervez Noordin
Lokhandwall -vs- State of Maharashtra.
Criminal Petition No. 19 of 2024 Page 16
[21] Here, the emphasis is given to "medical necessity which
would be required to travel abroad in order to obtain certain medical facilities and treatment".
[22] This Court for this matter perused the medical documents filed by the respondent and while
doing so, this Court came across the following medical documents:
(i) Scanned copy of appointment for treatment to Cleveland Clinic, USA dated
30.04.2010.
Here, a perusal of this document finds that this is just an appointment for treatment, nothing else.
(ii) Scanned copy of discharge copy with medication advice of Max Health Care Hospital.
In that, it is found that in the case history portion, it was written as "Acute on Chronic Pancreatitis".
But, there is no mention of either Cancer or advising the accused to go abroad for medical treatment
on the ground that in the concerned hospital or in the country, there is no facility to treat the
disease.
(iii) Scanned copy of discharge summary and certificate issued by Raj Medicity, Imphal.
In that, it was mentioned "Acute on Chronic Pancreatitis"
without mentioning Cancer with medication advice. But, it does not mention that the
