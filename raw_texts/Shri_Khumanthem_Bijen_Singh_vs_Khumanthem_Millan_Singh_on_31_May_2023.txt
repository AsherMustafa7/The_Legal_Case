challenged the legality, propriety and correctness of the mutation order dated 16.05.2001 in
Mutation Case No. 169/SDC(P) 2001 of the Sub-Deputy Collector, Patsoi, Imphal West. By the
impugned order, the learned Tribunal allowed the application under Section 5 of the Limitation Act,
1963 by condoning delay of 321 days in filing the Revision Case under Section 95 of the Manipur
Land Revenue & Land Reforms Act, 1960 against the order dated 16.05.2001 in Mutation Case No.

(iv) The petitioner paid a sum of Rs. 90,000/- to the respondents' father Kh. Shanta Singh to meet

Shri Khumanthem Bijen Singh vs Khumanthem Millan Singh on 31 May, 2023
On 25.02.2019, the respondents had filed a Revenue Appeal No. 2/SDO/(PSI) of 2019 before SDO,
Patsoi with an application being Revenue Misc. Case No. 3 of 2019 for condonation of 6128 days,
alleging that they came to know about the mutation order dated 16.05.2001 only on 04.02.2019. The
Ld. SDO disposed of the appeal on 21.08.2019 directing the parties to approach the appropriate
forum for title/ownership of the land. The respondents filed Original Suit No. 91 of 2019 before the
Ld. Civil Judge (Sr. Div.), Imphal West on 23.10.2019, inter-alia, praying for declaration of title &
entry of their names in the land record; for declaring the mutation order dated 16.05.2001 as void;
and for cancellation of name of the petitioner herein from the land record. The suit is still pending.
(vii) On 06.12.2021, an application under Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963 was filed before the
learned Revenue Tribunal, Manipur for condoning delay of 321 Page 4 days in filing the
accompanying revision petition under Section 95 of the Manipur Land Revenue and Land Reforms
Act (MLR & LR Act), 1960 challenging the mutation order dated 16.05.2001 passed by the SDC,
Patsoi, Imphal West in Mutation Case No. 169/SDC/(P)IW/2001. It is stated that the application for
condonation of delay [Annexure- A/7] was filed soon after receipt of certified copies of mutation
order of SDC and order in appeal passed by SDO and hence there is no delay from the date of
knowledge of mutation order dated 16.05.2001. It is prayed to condone 321 days. [3] The petitioner
herein filed written objection before the learned Tribunal to the application for condonation of delay
stating that the respondents had no locus standi in filing the revision case stating that their father
and/or other brothers of the petitioner never challenged the mutation order and the mutation was
done with the consent of the father of the respondents. The petitioner becomes the absolute owner
and possessor of the land on the basis of family arrangement. The father of the respondents never
challenged the mutation order during his lifetime. It is also stated that the respondents did not
challenge the order dated 21.08.2019 passed by the Ld. SDO, Patsoi, Imphal West in Revision
Appeal Case No. 2/SDO(PSI of 2019. Thereafter, the respondents have filed a suit being Original
Suit No. 91 of 2019 before the Court of Ld. Civil Judge (Sr.Div.), Imphal West. It Page 5 is submitted
that the same mutation order cannot be challenged twice before two different fora. It is stated that
the application is hopeless bar by limitation.
[4] By the impugned order dated 20.04.2022 in Revenue Misc. Case No. 66 of 2021, the Ld.
Tribunal allowed the application for condonation of delay and condoned the delay of 321 days in
filing the accompanying revision petition against the mutation order dated 16.05.2001. Being
aggrieved by the same, the petitioner challenges the impugned order amongst on the following
grounds:
(i) The respondents have no right to challenge the order dated 16.05.2001 which was
passed on the basis of the family arrangement. There is no gift deed in favour of late
Kh. Shanta Singh (father of the respondents) who died in the year 2010.
(ii) The application is hopelessly barred by law of limitation and there is no sufficient
cause to condone the delay as well as they suppressed the fact that they had already
filed O.S. No. 91 of 2019 and after a gap of about 2 years they again filed the
application for reviewing the order dated 16.05.2001 before the Revenue Tribunal.

Shri Khumanthem Bijen Singh vs Khumanthem Millan Singh on 31 May, 2023
(iii) The order dated 20.04.2022 of the Revenue Tribunal is illegal and there is no
specific reason of condoning the delay and under what basis the delay was calculated
is Page 6 not known. The Revenue Tribunal failed to apply its judicial mind and
without considering the facts, abruptly allowed the application for condonation of
delay.
(iv) Serious miscarriage of justice causes and the order causes inconvenience and
hardship to the petitioner;
and
(v) Any other ground may arise be allowed to be urged at the time of hearing.
It is prayed that the impugned order 20.04.2022 be set aside. [5] The respondents entered into
appearance and filed counter affidavit where it is stated that by the impugned order dated
20.04.2022, the Ld. Tribunal has rightly allowed the application for condonation of delay of 321
days, as the respondents established sufficient cause for condonation of delay in filing the
accompanying revision petition against the mutation order dated 16.05.2001 passed in Mutation
Case No. 169/SDC/(P)IW/2001 passed by the Ld. SDC, Patsoi, Imphal West and the accompanying
Revision Petition deserves to be heard on its merit. It is further stated that the respondents are son
and daughters of the petitioner's younger brother, i.e. their nephew and nieces of the petitioner. It is
also stated that under the family arrangement, the fathe r of the respondents did not take his share
from the homestead land under patta No. 88(Old) corresponding to new patta No. 90 under C.S.
Dag No. 1355, measuring an area of 0.14542 at village No. 78 Changangei IWT left by Page 7 their
grandfather as land was too small to distribute among the 7 brothers. The brothers of the petitioner
are now residing in the said homestead land. During the lifetime of the respondents' deceased
father, he purchased one homestead land from one person namely Yumnam Kesho Singh and they
are residing with their grandmother on the said homestead land under patta No. 788/1187
measuring an area of 0.0300 acres. The father of the respondents did not take his share from the
homestead land left by their grandfather. The father of the respondents was the absolute owner and
recorded pattadar of the piece of the agricultural land under New patta No. 88/1026, corresponding
to old patta No. 108, 246, covered by C.S. Dag No. 467 measuring an area of 0.82 acres situated at
revenue village No. 78 Changangei. The father of the respondents sold out some portion of aforesaid
agricultural land to the petitioner measuring an area of 0.31000 acres out of the total area of 0.82
acres under New Patta No. 88/1026 corresponding to old patta No. 108,246 covered by C.S. Dag No.
467 situated at revenue village No. 78 Changangei. Thereafter, the name of the petitioner was
recorded in the relevant record of rights and partition was done thereby recording the name of the
petitioner in the said agricultural land under a separate patta (jamabandi) being New patta No.
1072, covered by C.S. Dag No. 467/546, measuring an area of 0.31000 acres situated at revenue
village No. 78 Changangei. The father of the respondents was the absolute owner and recorded
pattadar of the agricultural land under New patta No. 88/1026, corresponding to old patta No. 108,
246 covered by C.S. Dag No. 467 measuring an area of 0.51 Page 8 acres situated at revenue village
No. 78 Changangei (hereinafter called "Suit Land") was recorded in the name of the deceased father
of the respondents.

[5.1] The father of the respondents met with a serious road accident in the year 2002 and lost his
consciousness due to serious injury on the head, when the respondents were minor. The mother of
the respondents left the matrimonial home after the said accident and they were living together
under the care and guidance of their grandmother namely Khumanthem (O) Apabi Devi at the
house of the deceased father. On 06.12.2010, the father of the respondents died and the suit land wa
s let out to the petitioner and in return the respondents and their grandmother enjoyed the 'lousal'
(5 paddy bags in a year as rent). During the lifetime of the father of the respondents, he never sold,
gifted, exchange d or mortgaged the said suit land to anybody and as such, there was no registered
deed in connection with the suit land. The father of the respondents sold only a portion of
agricultural land measuring an area of 0.31 acres out of 0.82 acres to the petitioner and remaining
portion measuring an area of 0.51 acres (suit land) were never sold, gifted, exchange or mortgaged
to the petitioner. In the first week of January, 2019, the respondents made a demand to the
petitioner to give the right of cultivation as they were grown-up and attained majority but the
petitioner, who was cultivating the land after the said accident of their father, refused to give the
right of cultivation of the said agricultural land to them. On Page 9 04.02.2019, the respondents
went to the concerned sub-Deputy Collector Office to enquiry about the record of the said suit land
and they came to know that the name of their deceased father, late Khumanthem Shanta Singh, was
not recorded in the record of rights (Jamabandi) and the name of the petitioner was recorded vide
order dated 16.05.2001 of mutation Case No. 169/SDC/(P)IW/2001 passed by the Sub-Deputy
Collector, Patsoi, Imphal West.
[5.2] It is stated that the petitioner in collusion with staff of the concerned revenue department
mutated the said suit land in his name vide order dated 16.05.2001 of the mutation case No.
169/SDC/(P)IW/2001 without the knowledge and consent of the children of original pattadar . On
25.02.2019, the respondents filed a Revenue Appeal No. 2 of 2019 in the Court of Sub-Divisional
Officer, Patsoi and vide order dated 21.08.2019, it was observed that the mutation order dated
16.05.2001 was not executed as per the prescribed procedure and directed the parties to approach
an appropriate forum for claiming their title/ownership of the said. Thereafter, the respondents
filed Original Suit No. 91 of 2019 before the Ld. Civil Judge (Sr.Div.), Imphal West against the
petitioner praying for a decree that the respondents are the absolute owner of the suit land and
entry of their names in land record and the mutation order be set aside. The suit is still pending.
Being aggrieved by the order dated 16.05.2001 in Mutation Case No. 169/SDC/(P)IW/2001 passed
by the SDC, Patsoi, Imphal West, the respondents filed Revenue Misc. Case No. 66 of 2021 which is
an Page 10 application under Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963 for condonation of delay of 321
days in filing the accompanying revision petition before the Ld. Revenue Tribunal, Manipur against
the mutation order. [6] Mr. E. Dayali, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that in the
application for condonation for delay filed before the learned Tribunal, the respondents have
miserably failed to disclose any valid reason (not to speak of the sufficient cause) for the delay of 321
days in filing the revision petition against the mutation order. It is pointed out that the actual delay
is not 321 days as mentioned. The impugned mutation order is dated 16.05.2001 and the application
for condonation for delay was filed on 06.12.2021 and as such there is more than 20 years of delay.
Even if, the period of delay is calculated from the date of alleged knowledge, ie, 04.02.2019, there is
a delay of almost three years. If the delay is calculated from the date of order passed by SDO in
appeal, ie, 21.08.2019, there is more than 2 years of delay. He points out that the respondents have
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/48846013/ 5
Shri Khumanthem Bijen Singh vs Khumanthem Millan Singh on 31 May, 2023
failed to specifically mention the exact days of delay. Mr. Dayali further submits that the
respondents have not disclosed in the application the factum of filing of a suit being OS No. 91 of
2019 on 23.10.2019 immediately after disposal of the appeal by the SDO on 21.08.2019. It is stated
that the respondents could also have filed the present revision in the year 2019 itself and no
explanation has been given for not doing the same. [7] Mr. E. Dayali, learned counsel for the
petitioner fairly concedes that liberal approach has to be employed while considering the Page 11
application for condonation of delay, if the applicant discloses a sufficient cause for not enabling to
approach the court in time. However, if there is no explanation at all, the delay so caused is to be
rejected with cost. He draws the attention of this Court to the fact that the respondents filed a suit
for declaration immediately after disposal of the appeal by SDO, but waited for more than two years
to file the present revision petition and such fact has been concealed in the application. It is also
stated that the Learned Tribunal has not given any cogent reason for condoning the delay except for
merely observing that sufficient cause has been established. It is prayed that the application for
condonation of delay be rejected by setting aside the impugned order.
[8] Mr. T. Sadananda, learned counsel for the respondents submits that liberal interpretation has to
be adopted while considering an application for condonation of delay to do complete justice. He
relies on the case of N. Balakrishnan v. M. Krishnamurthy, (1998) 7 SCC 123 @ Para 9, where the
Hon'ble Supreme Court held that in considering application for condonation of delay court ought to
construe it liberally. It was observed that length of delay is no matter and acceptability of the
explana tion is the only criterion. It was cautioned that superior courts not to disturb the acceptance
of reason for condoning the delay by original court, unless the discretion was wholly tenable or
perverse. Para 9 is reproduced below:
"9. It is axiomatic that condonation of delay is a matter of discretion of the court.
Section 5 of the Limitation Act does not say that such discretion can be exercised only
if the delay is within a certain limit. Length of delay is no matter, acceptability of the
explanation is t he Page 12 only criterion. Sometimes delay of the shortest range may
be uncondonable due to a want of acceptable explanation whereas in certain other
cases, delay of a very long range can be condoned as the explanation thereof is
satisfactory. Once the court accepts the explanation as sufficient, it is the result of
positive exercise of discretion and normally the superior court should not disturb
such finding, much less in revisional jurisdiction, unless the exercise of discretion
was on wholly untenable grounds or arbitrary or perverse. But it is a different matter
when the first court refuses to condone the delay. In such cases, the superior court
would be free to consider the cause shown for the delay afresh and it is open to such
superior court to come to its own finding even untrammelled by the conclusion of the
lower court."
[9] Mr. T. Sadananda, learned counsel for the respondents also refers to a recent decision of this
Court in the case Mst. Mumtaz v. Md. Manab & Ors reported as 2023 SCC Online Mani 73 where it
has been held that Revenue Tribunal has jurisdiction to entertain an application for condonation of
delay under the provision of Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963 and condoned delay of 151 days in
filing the revision petition against the impugned order of mutation passed without issuing notice to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/48846013/ 6
Shri Khumanthem Bijen Singh vs Khumanthem Millan Singh on 31 May, 2023
the applicant. In that case, this Court excluded the period from the date of order to the date of
knowledge and further the time taken in counselling sessions in the Legal Aid Clinic to arrive at a
mutual settlement from calculating the period of limitation, treating the same as the 'sufficient
cause'. It has also been held that the decisive factor in condonation of delay is not the length of the
delay, but the sufficiency of the satisfactory explanation. He prays that the present petition may be
rejected, as learned Tribunal has rightly condoned the delay of 321 days.
Page 13 [10] This Court has considered the rival submissions of the parties, the pleadings and
documents on record and the law in this regard. [11] The settled proposition of law while
considering the application for condonation of delay is whether the applicant is able to explain the
sufficient cause for the delay so occurred. Liberal construction has to be applied so as to do complete
justice to both parties. It is not the length of delay, but the explanation is the sole criterion. It is the
mandate of N. Balakrishnan (supra) that superior court ought not to disturb the finding of original
court, unless the exercise of the discretion is wholly untenable or perverse. The essence of the test is
the sufficient explanation for the delay. Hon'ble Supreme Court considered the lapse on the part of
the earlier counsel as a sufficient cause for the delay. In the case of Mst. Mumtaz (supra), this Court
condoned the delay of 151 days as the impugned order was passed without notice and also treated
time taken in counselling as sufficient cause.
[12] In the present case, the application for condonation of delay does not indicate how 321 days
have been calculated. The impugned order is dated 16.05.2001 and the revision petition was filed
with the application for condonation of delay on 06.12.2021. It is stated that the date of knowledge
is on 04.02.2019. After this, the respondents have filed appeal before SDO on 25.02.2019 and the
same was disposed on 21.08.2019. Then on 23.10.2019, the respondents filed a suit before the civil
court regarding the same suit land for declaration of title and entry of their names Page 14 in the
land record as directed by the SDO. However, the revision petition was filed only on 06.12.2021
along with an application for condonation of delay. In the application for condonation of delay, the
filing of the suit is not disclosed. In para 8 & 11 of the application, it is vaguely mentioned that the
revision petition was filed soon after from the date of knowledge. But the admitted date of
knowledge (as per the respondents' pleading before SDO, Annexure-A/4 and Para 5(xii) of counter
affidavit before this Court) is 04.02.2019 and date of filing is 06.02.2021. This Court is of the view
that the same cannot be considered as 'filed soon after the knowledge of the impugned order'.
Moreover, the main prayer in civil suit is for declaration of title in favour of the respondents and
entry of their names in the revenue record. If the suit is decreed in favour of the respondents herein,
it will be as good as allowing the revision petition before the Tribunal. Besides, the learned Tribunal
has not given any cogent reason for condoning the delay of 321 days except for merely observing
that "... the petitioners have established sufficient cause for condonation of 312 days for filing their
accompanying Revision Petition against the impugned order date d 16.05.2001...". It is silent on
how cause has been established. [13] In terms of the discussion in para 12 above, this Court is of the
opinion that the respondents have failed to give any explanation for the delay so caused to get
benefit of liberal interpretation of 'sufficient cause' as mandated by Section 5 of the Limitation Act.
Failure to explain their inability to file the present revision petition while filing a civil suit Page 15
immediately after disposal of the appeal by SDO will go against the respondents. It is also settled
proposition of law that delay is not to be condoned on mere asking and, that too, without any
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/48846013/ 7
Shri Khumanthem Bijen Singh vs Khumanthem Millan Singh on 31 May, 2023
sufficient explanation. The learned Tribunal also has failed to consider this aspect. Case laws cited
by the respondents are not applicable to the facts of the present case. In the cases of N. Balakrishnan
(supra) and Mst. Mumtaz (supra), the delay was condoned as the applicants satisfactorily explained
the delay so caused, whereas the respondents herein miserably failed to do so. Accordingly, it is held
that the impugned order dated 20.04.2022 passed by learned Revenue Tribunal, Manipur in
Revenue Misc. Case No. 66 of 2021 is perverse for discussing the sufficient cause in detail and the
same is set aside. It is further held that the accompanying revision petition under Section 95 of
MLR&LR Act is barred by limitation. The present petition is allowed. Parties are to bear their own
cost.
[14] In the application for condonation of delay and objection filed before the learned Tribunal as
well as in the pleadings before this Court, both the parties have pleaded the facts touching to the
merits of the case. It is clarified that this Court considers the facts limited to deciding the question of
limitation only and it does not express any opinion on the rival contentions with respect to the merit
of the case. Nothing stated herein shall affect the case of the parties in the pending civil suit
concerning the same property.
