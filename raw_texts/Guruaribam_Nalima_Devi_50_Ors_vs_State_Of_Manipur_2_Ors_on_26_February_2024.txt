Guruaribam Nalima Devi & 50 Ors vs State Of Manipur & 2 Ors on 26 February, 2024
Secretary, Council of Higher Secondary Education, Manipur(COHSEM) for cancellation of the
promotion of 51(fifty one) petitioners as the same was done in violation of (5) of the notification
dated 27.02.2019(Annexure-A/9).
[6] Mr. A. Mohendro, learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the Council of Higher
Secondary Education, Manipur submitted various proposals to the State Governments for approval
of the Council Service Rules 2015, 2017, 2019 & 2020 regulations. It is submitted that these
proposals are yet to be approved by the Government in terms of the Section 14 & 24 of the Manipur
Higher Secondary Education Act, 1992.
[7] Mr. A. Mohendro, learned counsel for the petitioner pointed out to the recommendations of the
Vigilance Commission dated 21.11.2023 in para 2 it has been stated that promotions to the
petitioners and others were in violation of (5) of the notification dated 27.02.2019. Since the
notification mention in para 2 of Annexure-A/9 is not approved by the State Government, the same
cannot be relied for cancelling the promotion of the petitioners.
[8] By the impugned order dated 29.01.2024, the State Government has given approval to the
COHSEM for cancellation of the promotions of 51(fifty one) employees i.e. the petitioners herein
and exempted 4(four) persons from the purview of the cancellation as the same was done as per the
prescribed procedure.
[9] Mr. A. Mohendro, learned counsel for the petitioners draws the attention of this Court to the
provisions of Section 13(xxi) where the Council has the power to appoint officers and employees
under prescribed regulations.
[10] It is submitted that the promotions were done in exercise of the power conferred under Section
13(xxi) of the Act and hence, the impugned orders are in violation of the Act.
[11] Mr. A. Mohendro, learned counsel for the petitioners also suggested that the impugned
recommendations of the Vigilance Commission, Manipur and State Government are yet to be acted
upon and the petitioners are still engaged in the ongoing class 11th and 12th examination, 2024 and
prays that impugned orders be stayed during the pendency of the present petition.
[12] Mrs. Ch. Sundari, learned GA draws the attention of this Court that in the main
recommendation of the Vigilance Commission dated 21.11.2023, there may be some misquotation of
the relevant Rules and the Regulations. However, there is irregularity as some of the petitioners got
promotion four times during the period of 3(three) and half years and this misquotation of the Rules
cannot be the ground for staying the impugned orders.
[13] Mr. N. Zequeson, learned counsel for respondent No.3 submits that the Council has yet to be
acted upon the recommendations and the approval of the State respondents regarding cancellation
of the promotion of the petitioners and required some time for taking instruction.
