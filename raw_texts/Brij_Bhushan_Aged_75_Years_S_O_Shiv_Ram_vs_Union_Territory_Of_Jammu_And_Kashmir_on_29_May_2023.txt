(iii) that pursuant to the said objectives a big chunk of land was proposed to be
acquired in the year 1988 at village Sidhra then Tehsil Samba (now Jammu)
including Kh. No. 6 min measuring 30 kanals and 05 marlas and accordingly the
Collector Land Acquisition was approached for verification of rate of land in the said
village;
(iv) that the collector after due certification had certified that the existing rate of the
land in village Sidhra was (cid:128) 40,000/- per kanal as per his communication dated
01-12-1998;
(v) that after having negotiated with the landlords the rate was settled at (cid:128) 31,500/-
per kanal and the lease deed dated 10-04-1989 was accordingly registered with
Sub-Registrar Samba;
(vi) that the land after having been leased out in favour of the corporation was
devolped into various plots and further leased out to the members of the organization
on first come first serve basis;
(vii) that after more than 30 years the respondent conducted a verification into the
allegation that 30 kanals and 05 marlas of state land comprising of Kh.
06 min of village Sidhra has been illegally transferred to the JKCHC in violation of Agrarian
Reforms Act 1976 and therefore a case of misconduct and conspiracy was registered against the
petitioner and two others vide FIR No. 10/2021 registered u/s 5(1)(d) r/w 5(2) of the J&K PC Act
2006 and section 120-B RPC;
(viii) that the view point of the respondent that the land in question was state land can(cid:129)t be
sustained when a look is had at the FIR itself, the land having vested in the owners namely Sarwar
Ali and others u/s 8 of the Agrarian Reforms Act 1976 vide mutation No9. 479 dated 22.09.1987 of
village Sidhra;
(ix) that the petitioner is unable to understand as to how the land in question could be termed state

Act 1976 when already the proprietary rights stood conferred upon said Sarwar Ali and other vide
mutation referred above;
(x) that even if it is presumed for the sake of arguments that the provision of Agrarian Reforms Act
1976 were violated as claimed by the respondent, even then no penal provision can be pressed into
service as violation of section 28& 28-A of Agrarian Reforms Act 1976 does not constitute any
offence;
(xi) that also no criminal misconduct can be attributed to the petitioner as the rate of the land
recommended by the collector was to the tune of (cid:128) 40000/- per kanal whereas the corporation had
acquired the land @ (cid:128) 31500/- per kanal;

(xii) that according to the petitioner no offence has been committed by him, but still he has been
booked in the said FIR contrary to the express provisions of law, there was no bar regarding the
transfer of the land in question on lease basis, and had there been any such ban the revenue
agencies couldn(cid:129)t have issued the necessary documents for registration and the registering
authority would have also refused the registration being a judicial officer;
(xiii) that even the legal advisor of the petitioner(cid:129)s corporation after perusal of the revenue record
had opined that the owners having proprietorship rights u/s 8 of Agrarian Reforms Act were
competent to lease out the land and moreso the provisions of Agrarian Reforms Act 1976 reveal that
no offence is made out against the petitioner.
2. Respondent/ACB through SSP Anti-Corruption Bureau Jammu has submitted the objections to
the petition contending therein, that FIR No. 10/2021 P/S ACB has been registered against the
petitioner after due verification conducted by Anti-Corruption Bureau into the allegations that 30
kanals 05 marlas of state land situated at Sidhra Jammu has been leased by revenue
officials/officers to petitioner Brij Bhushan the then chairman J&K Co- operative Housing
Federation, thereby, causing huge loss to the State Exchequer. It is contended, that one Pukha Ram
@ Bukha Ram S/O Manghtu Lohar was recorded as owner of land measuring 30 kanals 5 marlas
falling under Kh. No. 6 min in village Sidhra, the ownership rights of said Pukha Ram in regard to
the said piece of land got extinguished and vested in state u/s 4 of Agrarian Reforms Act 1976 vide
mutation No. 476 and the same were further vested in the names of 7 persons u/s 8 of J&K Agrarian
Reforms Act 1976 vide mutation No. 479 dated 22-09-1987 in the proportion of land as, (i) Sarwar
Ali S/O Kaka =4 kanals, (ii) Saraj Din S/O Qasim Din = 6 Kanals, (iii) Barkat Ali S/O Billu = 4
Kanals, (iv) Kasim Din S/O Taj Din = 4 kanals, (v) Chaman Lal S/O Mela Ram = 4 Kanals, (vi)
Mohd Jafar S/O Hassan Din =6 kanals & (vii) Ghulam Nabi S/O Bhimbru =2 kanals 5 marals. It is
stated, that during verification it surfaced that the above named persons executed power of attorney
dated 05-09-1989 jointly appointing one Nazir Ahmed S/O Ghulam Nabi R/O Sidhra Tehsil Jammu
erstwhile Tehsil Samba as their attorney in respect of their rights over the respective shares in the
aforesaid land and despite knowing the fact that any sought of transfer of such kind of land was
clearly prohibited, the then Patwari Halqa Ban Bajaj (erstwhile Tehsil Samba) namely Nazir Ahmed
and then Tehsildar Samba Balwant Raj hatched a criminal conspiracy among themselves as well as
with the beneficiaries just to transfer the state land to J&K Co-operative Housing Federation in
league with then Managing Director of the Housing Federation namely Sh. Brij Bhushan, whereby a
fard Intikhab dated 06-04-1989 was issued in respect of aforesaid 30 kanals 05 marlas of land in
favour of attorney holder Nazir Ahmed (now expired) and the same was attested by then Tehsildar
Samba Sh. Balwant Raj without getting it checked and verified through concerned Girdwar and Naib
Tehsildar, on the basis of said Fard Intikhab, 30 Kanals 05 marlas of land was leased out illegally to
J&K Cooperative Housing Federation (now J&K Cooperative Housing Corporation Ltd.) vide lease
deed dated 10-04-1989 through then Managing Director Sh. Brij Bhushan in brazen violations to
sec. 28(1) (b) and 28-A of J&K Agrarian Reforms Act 1976, whereby conferring huge undue benefit
upon the beneficiaries and corresponding loss to the state exchequer. It is contended, that the
aforesaid land measuring 30 kanal and 05 marlas situated at Sidhra Jammu was leased out illegally
by the revenue officials/officers in connivance with the petitioner and attorney holder Nazir Ahmed,
the said land was transferred in favour of the prospective owners u/s 8 of J&K Agrarian Reforms Act

1976 for their personal cultivation, further there was a clear prohibition for sale or other transfer of
the same to any other person, despite of prohibition for sale and transfer of aforesaid land u/s 28
and 28-A of J&K Agrarian Reforms Act, the revenue officials in connivance with the petitioner and
land owners, by abuse of their official position issued fard intikhab and after execution of lease deed
mutated the said land in favour of J&K Cooperative Housing Federation Jammu, the investigation of
the instant case is at its initial stage and the same is in progress.
3. Ld. Counsel for petitioner while seeking the quashment of FIR No. 10/2021 registered against the
petitioner by the respondents for commission of offences punishable u/ss 5(2) of J&K Prevention of
Corruption Act 2006 r/w Section 120-B, IPC has vehemently canvassed arguments, that Collector
Land Acquisition Jammu was approached for verification of rate of land in village Sidhra comprised
in Khasra No.6 min measuring 30 kanals 5 marals who after due verification fixed the rates of the
land as settled with the land owners at (cid:128) 31500 per kanal, whereby, the said land was legally
transferred to JKCHC. It is argued, that the land in question could not be termed state land, and
even if it is presumed that provisions of Agrarian Reforms Act 1976 have been violated, even then no
penal consequences can be pressed into service as violation of Section 28 & 28-A of Agrarian
Reforms Act 1976 do not constitute any offence, and the remedy provided is, that after providing
opportunity of being heard of the person who has contravened the provision, he shall be
dispossessed of such land by any revenue officer not below the rank of Tehsildar and the land shall
vest in State, no offence has been committed by the petitioner as there is no bar regarding transfer
of land in question on lease basis, the revenue documents for lease deed have been issued by the
revenue agencies and had there been any ban the registering authority would not have registered the
leased deed. To support his arguments, Ld. Counsel for petitioner has relied upon the judgments
reported in (i) 2017(1) JKJ HC 96 [Mohd Akbar Shah & Ors. Versus State & Ors.] &
(ii) JKJ Online 63959 [Pawan Kumar Kohli & Anr. Versus State of J&K].
4. Ld. Counsel for respondent, per-contra, has sought the dismissal of the petition by strenuously
articulating arguments, that land measuring 30 kanal and 05 marlas situated at Sidhra Jammu
which was transferred in favour of the prospective owners u/s 8 of J&K Agrarian Reforms Act 1976
for their personal cultivation was illegally leased out by the revenue officials/officers in connivance
with the petitioner and attorney holder Nazir Ahmed as there was a clear prohibition for sale or
other transfer of the same to any other person. It is argued, that despite of prohibition for sale and
transfer of aforesaid land u/s 28 and 28-A of J&K Agrarian Reforms Act 1976, the revenue officials
in connivance with the petitioner and land owners by abuse of their official position issued fard
intikhab, and after execution of lease deed mutated the said land in favour of J&K Cooperative
Housing Federation Jammu which is offence committed by the petitioner and other revenue officials
under the provisions of 5(2) of J&K Prevention of Corruption Act 2006 r/w Section 120-B, IPC.
5. I have heard Ld. Counsel for petitioner and Ld. Sr. AAG for respondent. I have perused the
averments of the petition, objections filed by respondent, gone through the relevant law on the
subject matter meticulously and have also scanned the ratios of judgments relied by Ld. Counsel for
petitioner.

6. It is pertinent to mention here, that The Jammu & Kashmir Agrarian Reforms Act 1976 came into
effect enforced by SRO 295 dated 13th July 1978, w.e.f. 1st June 1978. Chapter-IV deals with
SUPPLEMENTAL PROVISIONS. Sections 28, 28-A & 29 of Chapter-IV deal with the provisions of
"Rights & Liabilities of Prospective Owner", "Prohibition on Transfer of Certain Lands" &
"Indemnity", respectively. For the sake of brevity, sections 28,28- A & 29 are reproduced
hereunder:-
28. Rights and liabilities of prospective owner (1) Notwithstanding anything
contained in any law--
(a) a prospective owner of land eligible by or under this Act to acquire ownership rights in land
under his personal cultivation shall continue to have all rights and be subject to all liabilities
(including the payment to the 1[Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir] of the rent which was
payable by him to the ex-landlord before the commencement of the Jammu and Kashmir Agrarian
Reforms Act, 1972) as a tenant under the Jammu and Kashmir Tenancy Act. 1980, until he is vested
with ownership rights in such land :
Provided that he shall be governed by the rules of succession applicable to occupancy
tenants until he becomes owner of such land ;
(b) no prospective owner of land shall, 2[save as otherwise provided in the proviso to
clause (a) or in this clause] transfer his rights in such land by sale, gift, exchange,
mortgage, will or by any other means whatsoever, and any transfer of such rights
made after the first day of May, 1973 shall be null and void and such rights shall vest
in the State and such prospective owner and his transferee shall, after being given an
opportunity of being heard be dispossessed of such land by a Revenue Officer 2[x x x
x] :
[Provided that a prospective owner shall have the right to transfer land in the form of
simple mortgage subject to the provisions of the Alienation of Land Act, for securing
loan to liquidate the amount of levy payable by him under this Act ; and]
(c) no document purporting to effect transfer by a prospective owner of his rights in
land shall be admitted to registration, [except in respect of transfers effected under
the proviso to clause (b) of this section.] 28-A. Prohibition on transfer of certain
lands (1) No person who is vested with ownership rights in land under this Act, shall
transfer such land or rights therein in any manner whatsoever to any person other
than the Government of Jammu and Kashmir:

an opportunity of being heard, be dispossessed of such land by a Revenue Officer not
below the rank of Tehsildar and the land shall vest in the State and shall be disposed
of in accordance with the provisions of section 15.]
29. Indemnity.-No suit or other legal proceeding shall lie against any officer or
authority in respect of anything which is in good faith done or intended to be done
under this Act.
7. Cursory glance of provisions of sections 28,28-A & 29 aforesaid, make the legal proposition
manifestly clear, "that any transfer of land or rights in contravention of the provisions of the Act
shall be „null and void(cid:129) and the person who has contravened the provisions, after giving
opportunity of being heard, shall be dispossessed of such land which shall vest in the State, and no
suit or other legal proceedings shall lie against any officer or authority in respect of anything done
by him in good faith under this Act". In 2017(1) JKJ HC 96 [Mohd Akbar Shah & Ors. Versus State &
Ors.] relied by Ld. Counsel for petitioner, a Coordinate Bench of this court has held, that the
condition of seeking previous permission of the Govt. for alienation of land which was given for
agriculture purposes in terms of para 4 of order of 1966 (which was based on council decision No.
619 of 4 th April, 1966, whereby, occupancy tenant was authorized to transfer his right of occupancy
by sale, mortgage or gift) will not effect right of the owner of the land to alienate the same. In JKJ
Online 63959 [Pawan Kumar Kohli & Anr. Versus State of J&K] also relied by Ld. Counsel for
petitioner, a Coordinate Bench of this Court quashed FIR No. 7/2016 dated 08-03-2016 registered
at Police Station Vigilance Origination Jammu against petitioners for commission of offences
punishable u/ss 5(1) (d) r/w Section 5(2) of the J&K PC Act r/w Sections 468, 471 & 120-B RPC for
the reasons, that the basic order of custodian dated 27-05-2011 vide which he set aside the mutation
No. 288 dated 20-04- 2001 attested under section 3-A of Agrarian Reforms Act by Tehsildar/
Assistant Custodian Bishnah (Jammu) on the basis of which FIR was registered against petitioners,
was set aside by J&K Special Tribunal vide his order dated 28-03-2018 holding that the
custodian/PRO had power to be exercised only under EP (Evacuees Administration of Property) Act
2006 and rules, but had absolutely no jurisdiction to pass any order under Agrarian Reforms Act.
Ratio decidendi of the judgments (Supra) and the provisions of sections 28,28-A & 29 of Agrarian
Reforms Act clearly mandate, that no legal proceedings can lie against any officer or authority and
the only legal recourse as mandated under Sub-section 2 of Section 28-A is, that any transfer of land
or rights therein in contravention of the provisions of the Act shall be null and void, and the person
in possession of the said land shall be dispossessed by a revenue officer not below the rank of
Tehsildar and the said land shall vest in the State. Ratios of the judgments (Supra) and the
provisions of law engrafted in Sections 28,28-A & 29 of Agrarian Reforms Act aforesaid squarely
apply to the facts of the case in hand. In the case in hand, even if it is presumed that the petitioner
alongwith revenue officials have got the land measuring 30 kanals 5 marals falling under Khasra no.
6 min situated in village Sidhra Jammu transferred in favour of J&K Co- operative Housing
Federation in contravention of the provisions of Section 28 r/w Section 28-A, the said transfer of
land shall be null and void and the person/persons shall after being given opportunity of being
heard be dispossessed of the said land which shall vest in the State (UT of J&K) and moreso, no
proceedings much less any criminal proceedings as mandated u/s 29 shall be entail against the
petitioner and other officials.

of Corruption Act r/w Section 120-B IPC, registered qua the petitioner and consequent proceedings
