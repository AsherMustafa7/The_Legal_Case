mentioned that it would be compulsory on the part of the National Health Mission to
invite Pharmacists also, to undergo the bridge courses. Unless and until the
petitioner points out that the fundamental right has been violated or the

Court cannot interfere with the advertisement issued by the respondents. It is for the
respondents to take a decision in this regard. If the National Health Mission has
decided not to include the Pharmacists, then it cannot be said that the advertisement
issued by the National Health Mission is contrary to the policy.

to lay down such prerequisite conditions of appointment as would be conducive to
the maintenance of proper discipline amongst Government servants....."
