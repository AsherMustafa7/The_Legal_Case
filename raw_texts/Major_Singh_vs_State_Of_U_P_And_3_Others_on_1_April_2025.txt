Major Singh vs State Of U.P. And 3 Others on 1 April, 2025
4. Learned counsel for the applicant argued that the accused-applicant is innocent. He has been
falsely implicated in this case crime number and is languishing in jail since 22.12.2024. He has no
criminal antecedent and there is no likelihood of his fleeing from course of justice or tampering with
evidence in case of release on bail. Learned counsel for the applicant submits that the applicant is
not named in the FIR and during course of investigation, the statement of victim was recorded
under Section 183 BNSS, in which she made some improvement and took the name of the applicant.
It is further submitted that the incident took place on 11.11.2024 and the FIR of the alleged incident
has been lodged after great delay of 9 days without giving any explanation for delay in lodging the
FIR. He further submits that no video or other offensive matterial as alleged by the victim has been
recovered from the possession of the applicant and no cogent evidence is available against the
applicant and he has no criminal history. Hence, bail has been prayed for.
5. Learned AGA as well as learned counsel for the first informant have vehemently opposed the
prayer for bail but could not dispute the aforesaid facts.
6. Considering all above facts and circumstances, the nature of accusations, severity of the
punishment in the case of conviction and nature of supporting evidence, reasonable apprehension of
tampering with the witness and prima facie case, but without commenting on merit of case, a case
for bail is made out.
7. Accordingly, the bail application is allowed.
8. Let the accused-applicant, Major Singh, involved in above mentioned case crime number be
released on bail, on his executing a personal bond and two reliable sureties each, in the like amount
to the satisfaction of the court concerned, subject to the following conditions:
1. The applicant will not tamper with the evidence.
2. The applicant will not indulge in any criminal activity.
3. The applicant will not pressurize/intimidate the prosecution witnesses and
co-operate in the trial.
4. The applicant will appear regularly on each and every date fixed by the trial court,
unless his personal appearance is exempted through counsel by the court concerned.
9. In the event of breach of any of the aforesaid conditions, the court below will be at liberty to
proceed to cancel his bail.
