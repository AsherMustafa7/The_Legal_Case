further involvement in illicit trafficking of narcotic drugs. On 11.11.2022, Special Secretary (Home),

detenu and stated that he was a habitual offender indulging in transport of brown sugar in

drug racket. If he was to be released on bail, he would likely to continue indulging in the illicit
trafficking of drugs. As an alternative measure, he was taken into preventive detention. [2] The

about the detention order within 10(ten) days;
d) there was inordinate delay on the part of both the State and Central Governments
in disposing the representation submitted by the detenu;
e) the detention order was based on the solitary activity by the detenu.
[3] The State Government filed counter affidavit and it is stated that as the petitioner was habitual
offender and has been indulging in illicit trafficking of drugs, he was taken into preventive
detention. It is stated that the representation dated 19.11.2022 was forwarded by IG of Prisons vide
letter dated 21.11.2022 and received on the same day and parawise comment was sought from DGP,
Manipur vide letter dated 23.11.2022 and the parawise comments dated W.P.(Cril.) No.24 of 2023

[5] Heard Mr. Sanajaoba, learned counsel for the detenu, Mr. O.
Ratankumar, learned Dy. GA for the State and Mr. S. Samarjeet, learned Sr. PCCG for the Central
Government.
[6] Mr. Sanajaoba, learned counsel for the detenu submits that the detenu has no previous
involvement in criminal case and he has been wrongly implicated in the present case. It is stated
that it took 28 days for the State Government to dispose the representation dated 19.11.2022 on
16.12.2022. Out of this, 11 days, i.e., from 05.12.2022 (the day parawise comments was received
from the State police) to 16.12.2022 (the day rejecting the representation) has not been properly
explained. He draws the attention of this Court to the judgment passed by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of 1999 (1) SCC 417 in the case of Rajammal v. State of T.N. reported as Para 7, 8,
9, 10 and
11. It was held that even though no period is prescribed by Article 22(5) of the Constitution, the
representation should be considered and disposed at the earliest. However, the authority may
explain any delay which had occasion in the disposal of the writ petition. If the delay is not properly
explained, detention order can be set aside. In that case, the authority cannot explain the delay of 5
days and accordingly, detention order was set aside.
[7] Mr. Sanajaoba, learned counsel for the detenu further relies on a case of Prof. Khaidem Ibocha
Singh vs. State of Manipur (1972) 2 SCC 576 where the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that any
unexplained delay in the disposal of representation amounts to violation of Article 22(5) of the
W.P.(Cril.) No.24 of 2023 Page 6 Constitution and the same renders the detention order illegally.
The learned counsel also relies on the orders passed by this Court in W.P.(Crl) No.51 of 2022 and 31
of 2022 where detention order was set aside for unexplained delay in the disposal of the
representation. He also submitted that there is no explanation for the Central Government for delay
in the disposal of the representation and it took 38 days in disposing the representation submitted
by the detenu. He prays that detention order be set aside for the undue and unexplained delay on
the part of the authorities in disposing the representation submitted by the detenu.
[8] Mr. O. Ratankumar, learned Dy. GA for the State submits that the delay has been duly explained
in the counter affidavit filed by the State Government. It is stated that the detention order dated
07.11.2022 and the ground of detention dated 11.11.2022 were furnished to the Central Government
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/56498919/ 4
Sr Angam Chiru vs The State Of Manipur on 4 April, 2023
on 14.11.2022 within 10 days as stipulated under Section 3(2) of the PIT- ND&PS Act. The time
taken in processing the representation submitted by the detenu has been explained in Para 6 of the
counter affidavit. It is stated that the representation dated 19.11.2022 was received from the Office
of the IG Prisons on 21.12.2022. The same was forwarded to the Central Government on 23.11.2022
and on the same day, parawise comments was called from the DGP, Manipur. Parawise comments
dated 01.12.2022 was received by the Dy. Secretary (Home), Government of Manipur on 05.12.2022
and the same was W.P.(Cril.) No.24 of 2023 Page 7 forwarded to the Central Government also and
the representation was rejected on 16.12.2022.
Mr. O. Ratankumar, learned Dy. GA says that it took only effective 11 days for the State Government,
i.e., from 05.12.2022 to 16.12.2022 in disposing the representation submitted by the State
Government. He further clarifies that 11 days' time taken by the State Government is due to the
communication between the Offices and proceeding of file and getting approval. At the same time,
the officers/officials were dealing with the urgent matter and dealing with similar cases and other
time bound Court matters and Home Department related issues like protocol duties, etc. Mr. O.
Ratankumar, learned Dy. GA submits that there is no inordinate delay and the effective 11 days has
been explained as above. He prays that the writ petition may be rejected. [9] Mr. S. Samarjeet,
learned Sr. PCCG for the Central Government submits that the representation dated 19.11.2022 was
received by the Central Authority on 07.11.2022 along with the ground of detention was received on
14.11.2022 by the Central Government. Again, the representation dated 19.11.2022 was forwarded
by e-mail and the same was received on 24.11.2022 and parawise comments from the State
Government was received on 14.12.2022 and the same was placed before the competent authority,
i.e., Secretary, Revenue Department, Government of India on 20.12.2022 and it was rejected on
27.12.2022. He submits that there is no delay on the part of the Central Government and the writ
petition be rejected.
W.P.(Cril.) No.24 of 2023 Page 8
[10] Considered the submissions of the learned counsels for the parties
and perused the documents on record including the original file submitted by the State Government.
[11] In the case of Rajammal v. State of T.N.: (1999) 1 SCC 417 :
1999 SCC (Cri) 93, Hon'ble Supreme Court held that even though no period is
prescribed for disposal of the representation submitted by the detenu, the authorities
should dispose the same as expeditiously as possible. The unexplained delay in
disposal of the representation shall vitiate the detention order. Relevant para are
reproduced below:
7. It is a constitutional obligation of the Government to consider the representation
forwarded by the detenu without any delay. Though no period is prescribed by Article
22 of the Constitution for the decision to be taken on the representation, the words
"as soon as may be" in clause (5) of Article 22 convey the message that the
representation should be considered and disposed of at the earliest. But that does not
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/56498919/ 5
Sr Angam Chiru vs The State Of Manipur on 4 April, 2023
mean that the authority is pre-empted from explaining any delay which would have
occasioned in the disposal of the representation. The court can certainly consider
whether the delay was occasioned due to permissible reasons or unavoidable causes.
This position has been well delineated by a Constitution Bench of this Court in K.M.
Abdulla Kunhi v. Union of India 5.
The following observations of the Bench can profitably be extracted here:
(SCC p. 484, para 12) "It is a constitutional mandate commanding the authority
concerned to whom the detenu submits his representation to consider the
representation and dispose of the same as expeditiously as possible. The words 'as
soon as may be' occurring in clause (5) of Article 22 reflects the concern of the
Framers that the representation should be expeditiously considered and W.P.(Cril.)
No.24 of 2023 Page 9 disposed of with a sense of urgency without an avoidable delay.
However, there can be no hard and fast rule in this regard. It depends upon the facts
and circumstances of each case. There is no period prescribed either under the
Constitution or under the detention law concerned, within which the representation
should be dealt with. The requirement, however, is that there should not be supine
indifference, slackness or callous attitude in considering the representation. Any
unexplained delay in the disposal of representation would be a breach of the
constitutional imperative and it would render the continued detention impermissible
and illegal."
8. The position, therefore, now is that if delay was caused on account of any
indifference or lapse in considering the representation, such delay will adversely
affect further detention of the prisoner. In other words, it is for the authority
concerned to explain the delay, if any, in disposing of the representation. It is not
enough to say that the delay was very short. Even longer delay can as well be
explained. So the test is not the duration or range of delay, but how it is explained by
the authority concerned.
9. What happened in this case was that the Government which received remarks from
different authorities submitted the relevant files before the Under-Secretary for
processing it on the next day. The Under-Secretary forwarded it to the Deputy
Secretary on the next working day. Thus there is some explanation for the delay till
9-2-1998. Thereafter the file was submitted before the Minister who received it while
he was on tour. The Minister passed the order only on 14-2-1998. Though there is
explanation for the delay till 9-2-1998, we are unable to find out any explanation
whatsoever as for the delay which occurred thereafter. Merely stating that the
Minister was on tour and hence he could pass orders only on 14-2-
1998 is not a justifiable explanation when the liberty of a citizen guaranteed under Article 21 of the
Constitution is involved. Absence of the Minister at W.P.(Cril.) No.24 of 2023 Page 10 the
Headquarters is not sufficient to justify the delay, since the file could be reached the Minister with
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/56498919/ 6
Sr Angam Chiru vs The State Of Manipur on 4 April, 2023
utmost promptitude in cases involving the vitally important fundamental right of a citizen.
10. Mr V.R. Reddy, learned Senior Counsel for the State of Tamil Nadu, referred to a decision of this
Court in U. Vijayalakshmi v. State of T.N. 6 to contend that it could not be said that there was any
delay in considering the representation from 9-2-1998 to 14-2-1998. In that case also, the detention
was under Section 3(1) of the Act. The detenu made a representation against the detention which
was received by the State Government on 18- 5-1992 and the State Government conveyed the
rejection of the representation on 23-6-1992. The detenu received the rejection order on 26-6-1992.
It was submitted that there was an inordinate long delay in dealing with the representation and that
the detenu was entitled to have the detention order quashed. This Court noticed that in the
counter-affidavit filed by the Deputy Secretary to the State Government, the manner in which the
representation was dealt with after its receipt on 18-5-1992 had been stated in detail. The Court then
observed:
"We have perused the stages through which the file containing the representation
was dealt with promptly and there was no indifference, lethargy or negligence in
dealing with the same. The file was not unnecessarily held up at any level but moved
from level to level promptly. We are, therefore, satisfied that the explanation
tendered by the Deputy Secretary in this behalf is acceptable and does not betray any
lack of sense of urgency in dealing with the representation. We, therefore, do not see
any merit in the first contention."
In the present case, however, there is no explanation forthcoming as to why the representation could
not be dealt with by the Minister concerned from 9-2-1998 to 14-2-1998.
W.P.(Cril.) No.24 of 2023 Page 11
11. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the delay from 9-2-1998 to 14-2- 1998 remains unexplained
and such unexplained delay has vitiated further detention of the detenu. The corollary thereof is that
further detention must necessarily be disallowed. We, therefore, allow this appeal and set aside the
impugned judgment. We direct the appellant-detenu to be set at large forthwith.
From the decision of the Rajammal (supra), it is settled proposition of law that the representation
ought to be disposed of as expeditiously as possible even though no time period is prescribed under
Article 22(5) of the Constitution. It is further held that if the delay caused in disposal is due to the
lapse on the part of the authority, it will adversely affect further detention of the prisoners. The test
is in the duration on rest of the delay, but how it is explained by the authority concerned. The
authority may explain the delay in disposal and the Court is bound to consider the explanation. In
that case, the delay of 5 days while the file was pending before the concerned magistrate could not
be explained and detention order was set aside on that ground.
In the present case, State Government has explained the movement of the file from one office to
another and the parawise comments from the police department was received on 05.12.2022 and
the representation was disposed on 16.12.2022. However, there is no explanation for the 11 days'
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/56498919/ 7
Sr Angam Chiru vs The State Of Manipur on 4 April, 2023
time (from 05.12.2022 to 16.12.2022) taken after receipt of the parawise W.P.(Cril.) No.24 of 2023
Page 12 comments and till the disposal of the representation, there is no plausible. However, in Para
6 of the counter affidavit filed by the State Government, it is vaguely stated that this 11 days were
taken in movement of the file from one office to another and getting approval and many officials
were engaged in other compelling urgent works. We are of the opinion that such vague explanations
are not reasonable when it concerns with the personal liberty of a person as guaranteed by Article 21
of the Constitution. Hence, the detention order is liable to be set aside on this ground alone.
In the counter affidavit filed by the Central Government, it is stated that parawise comments was
received on 14.12.2022 and it was placed before the competent authority/Secretary (Revenue),
Government of India on 20.12.2022 and the representation was rejected on 27.12.2022. It took 13
effective days out of (38 days) for the Central Government in disposing the representation
submitted by the detenu. There is explanation for the period 19.11.2022 to 24.12.2022 as the
representation was received on that day. The period from 24.11.2022 to 14.12.2022 as the time taken
in receiving parawise comments from the State Government and the same is duly explained.
However, there is no explanation for the period of 6 days, i.e., from 14 to 20 December, 2022 in
placing the file before the Secretary (Revenue) and also for the period of 7 days, i.e., from 20 to 27
December, 2022, the time taken by the Secretary (Revenue) in disposing the representation
submitted by the detenu. The Central Government could not explain the effective 13 days' time taken
from W.P.(Cril.) No.24 of 2023 Page 13 the date of receipt of the representation till the date of
disposal of the detention order is also vague on this ground also.
[12] Accordingly, detention order dated 07.11.2022 and the confirmation order dated 17.01.2023 are
set aside for delay in disposal of representations by both the State and Central Governments. The
detenu SR Athoi Chiru, aged about 23 years, S/o SR Angam Chiru of Chawangkining, Village
Thonglang, be set at liberty if not required in any other case.
[13] Copy of the order be sent to the Superintendent of Manipur Central Jail, Sajiwa for information.
[14] Return the original file to the State Government.
[15] The writ petition is allowed. No cost.
