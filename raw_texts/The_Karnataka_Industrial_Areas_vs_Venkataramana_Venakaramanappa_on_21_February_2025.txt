THESE WRIT APPEALS, CCC AND WRIT PETITIONS HAVING

CORAM: HON'BLE MRS. JUSTICE ANU SIVARAMAN
and
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE UMESH M ADIGA
58
CAV JUDGMENT
(PER: HON'BLE MRS. JUSTICE ANU SIVARAMAN) These batch of Writ Appeals arise from a
common order dated 01.08.2022 of the learned Single Judge in W.Ps.No.5916/2017 c/w. 7980/2017
and 8214/2017 and the common order dated 18.07.2022 of the learned Single Judge in
W.Ps.No.108802/2016 c/w. 107748/2014 and 100762/2017.
Writ Petitions No.56771/2013, 35406/2014, 10489/2015, 23940/2015 and 12396/2020 are filed by
the private persons (land losers) challenging the awards passed in respect of acquisitions initiated
under the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Act, 1966 ('KIAD Act' for short), prior to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/68025422/ 51
The Karnataka Industrial Areas ... vs Venkataramana @ Venakaramanappa on 21 February, 2025
01.01.2014.
CCC No.100143/2023 is filed by the complainants seeking to initiate the contempt proceedings and
punish the accused persons for willful disobedience of the interim order dated 15.11.2022 passed in
W.P.No.103533/2022.
2. Heard learned senior counsels and the learned counsel appearing on either side.
3. The Writ Petitions before the learned Single Judge had been filed contending that the
Notifications for acquisition of land issued under Section 28(1) of the KIAD Act, and the final
Notifications issued thereafter should be deemed to have lapsed as per the provisions of the Right to
Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act,
2013 ('2013 Act' for short). By the judgments under appeal, the Writ Petitions have been allowed
quashing the awards already passed in respect of the subject properties and directing the issuance of
fresh award in favour of the writ petitioners and to pay them compensation with all benefits, interest
etc., as per the provisions of 2013 Act. These judgments are called to question in the batch of appeals
filed by the KIADB. The Writ Petitions which raised similar questions of law have been tagged along
with the appeals.
4. The learned senior counsel for the appellants submits that the provisions of the 2013 Act,
especially Sections 24 and 25 thereof are not applicable to an acquisition under the KIAD Act, which
is the special enactment and that where the passing of the award and the payment of compensation
had been delayed only on account of the challenges repeatedly raised by the writ petitioners
themselves and the interdictory orders passed by this Court, the appellants - KIADB cannot be made
responsible for payment of higher compensation under the 2013 Act, which has no application
whatsoever to the facts of the case. The State has also filed the Writ Appeal as W.A.No.1071/2022.
5. Shri. D.L.N. Rao, learned senior counsel appearing for the KIADB in three of these appeals and
for a beneficiary, Arcelor Mittal in another appeal submits that the acquisitions in question were
made under the provisions of the KIAD Act and that the finding of the learned Single Judge that the
provisions of Section 24 of the 2013 Act are applicable to the said acquisition is completely flawed. It
is contended that Section 24 of the 2013 Act is a transitory provision and that it applies only to
acquisitions under the 1894 Act. It is contended that the KIAD Act being a complete code in itself
and the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 ('the 1894 Act for short) having been
incorporated into the said Act by legislation, there is no question of applying the provisions of the
2013 Act to the acquisitions in question. Compensation is to be paid in respect of the acquisitions
under the KIAD Act in terms of the provisions of the KIAD Act itself. It is contended that the
acquisitions were initiated by the issuance of Notifications long before 01.01.2014. The vesting of the
property occurred due to operation of law on issuance of the Final Notification under Section 28(4)
of KIAD Act. It is therefore contended that the failure, if any, to pass the award within one year from
01.01.2014 would be of no consequence whatsoever and the awards having been passed thereafter,
within a reasonable time, the directions issued by the learned Single Judge are untenable. He would
place pointed reliance on the judgments of the Apex Court in Special Land Acquisition Officer,
KIADB, Mysore v. Anasuya Bai reported in (2017) 3 SCC 313 and of a Co-ordinate Bench of this
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/68025422/ 52
The Karnataka Industrial Areas ... vs Venkataramana @ Venakaramanappa on 21 February, 2025
Court in L. Ramareddy v. State of Karnataka & Others reported in 2020 SCC OnLine Kar 3435,
which has been upheld by the Apex Court. The decision of the Division Bench of this Court in Sri
A.C. Ananthaswamy v. State of Karnataka & Others reported in ILR 2006 KAR 1551 and the decision
of the Apex Court in M. Nagabhushana v. State of Karnataka & Others reported in (2011) 3 SCC 408,
have also been relied on.
6. It is further contended that Section 29 of the KIAD Act specifically provides for payment of
compensation. Section 30 incorporates the provisions regarding enquiry, award, reference,
determination, apportionment and payment of compensation. Section 29 of the KIAD Act provides
for determination of the compensation under the said Act. It is further contended that substitution
of Section 30 of the KIAD Act, by 2022 Act can be either from the date of substitution or coming
into force of 2022 Act. Thereby, incorporated provisions apply to acquisition proceedings initiated
under the KIAD Act after coming into force of the amendment Act, 2022. It cannot relate back to the
date of coming back into force of the KIAD Act, in as much as the Act of 2013 was not in existence.
Hence, it should be understood as coming into force on the date of coming into effect of 2022 Act. It
is submitted that there is no scope for applying the incorporated provisions of the 2013 Act to any
other date by giving retrospective effect from the date of coming into force of the 2013 Act. The
decision of S. Jalaja & Others v. Union of India & Others reported in 2019 SCC OnLine Kar 543,
Puttamma & Others v. State of Karnataka & Others, by order dated 05.08.2021 passed in
W.A.No.4036/2019 and K. Srinivas Murthy & another v. State of Karnataka reported in ILR 2020
KAR 4195, are relied on.
7. Further, even in the amendment to Section 30 brought about by the KIAD amendment Act, 2022,
only Sections 23, 23-A, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 64, 65, 69, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80 and 96 and
Schedule-1, have been incorporated into the Act and Sections 24 and 25 are conspicuous by their
absence. It is further contended that Section 28(4) of the KIAD Act provides for issuance of a
declaration by Notification in the Official Gazette. Section 28(5) of the KIAD Act provides that on
publishing in the Official Gazette of the declaration under sub Section 4, the land shall vest
absolutely in the State Government free from all encumbrances. It is submitted that any change in
law which comes into effect after the vesting can have no effect on the acquisitions of the property
which stands vested.
8. It is further contended, relying on authorities, that where a statute is incorporated by reference
into a second statute, the repeal of the first statute by a third does not affect the second. It is
submitted that the learned Single Judge refers to Section 24(1)(a) and (b) and it's effect but failed to
notice that the entire Section deals with acquisition initiated under the Land Acquisition Act 1894
and can have no application to other enactments. It is further contended that the KIAD Act and the
Land Acquisition Act are not in pari materia and do not even come under the same list of the
SEVENTH SCHEDULE of the Constitution of India. It is therefore contended that there would be no
question of repugnancy leading to an inference that the provisions of the 2013 Act are applicable.
Reliance is placed in this regard on the decision of the Apex Court in M/s. Hoechst Pharmaceuticals
Ltd. & Others v. State of Bihar & Others, reported in (1983) 4 SCC 45. It is contended that all the
awards were passed before 05.04.2022 when Section 30 of the KIAD Act stood amended and such
amendment would not affect such awards. Reliance is placed on the Division Bench judgment of this
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/68025422/ 53
The Karnataka Industrial Areas ... vs Venkataramana @ Venakaramanappa on 21 February, 2025
Court in N. Thippa Raju and Others v. State of Karnataka and another by order dated 20.04.1990
passed in W.As.No.717-720/1990.
9. Shri. S.S.Naganand, learned senior counsel appearing for the Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation
Limited ('BMRCL' for short), who is also the beneficiary of one of the acquisitions in question,
supports the contentions of the counsel for KIADB. It is contended that the only question for
consideration is the extent of compensation payable to the land losers and the mode and method of
computation thereof since vesting has admittedly occurred in all these cases prior to 01.01.2014. It is
submitted that during the pendency of the Writ Petitions, the BMRCL had conveyed its decision to
apply the compensation norms prescribed in the new Act to all land owners provided their consent
for receiving such compensation by agreement under Section 29(2) of the KIAD Act. However, the
petitioners raised a demand for market value as on 01.01.2014, which is totally untenable. This
Court directed the Price Advisory Committee to determine the compensation after hearing the land
losers but no solution was forthcoming.
10. It is further submitted that the KIAD Act is intended to promote the establishment and
development of industries and acquisition proceedings are incidental to the main object and
purpose of the Act. Section 30 was incorporated in the Act in order to make it a self working piece of
legislation. Relying on precedents, it is contended that the introduction of the provisions of the Land
Acquisition Act into the KIAD Act is evidently a legislation by incorporation and the repeal of the
1894 Act will have no impact on the KIAD Act. It is further contended that the argument based on
Article 14 of the Constitution of India is not available to the petitioners as a later Constitution Bench
of the Supreme Court in Union of India v. Chajju Ram reported in (2003) 5 SCC 568, has explained
the decision in Nagpur Improvement Trust and another v. Vithal Rao and others reported in (1973)
1 SCC 500. The decision in Rajiv Sarin & Another v. State of Uttarakhand & Others, reported in
(2011) 8 SCC 708, is also relied on. It is further contended that the decision of KIADB on 27.08.2016
to grant compensation under the New Act would relate to acquisitions initiated after 01.01.2014 only
and can have no impact on lands where vesting has occurred before 01.01.2014. It is further
submitted that the reliance placed by the learned Single Judge on Section 8 of the General Clauses
Act, 1897 was misconceived since the pre- amended Section 30 of the KIAD Act is clearly a
legislation by incorporation. With regard to the 2022 amendment to the KIAD Act, it is submitted
that the substitution is specifically from the date of the amending Act and where such a specific
intention is expressed in the amendment itself, it can have no retrospective operation. The decision
of the learned Single Judge of this Court in W.P.No.40748/1988 is relied on in support of his
contentions.
11. Shri. K. Shashi Kiran Shetty, learned Advocate General and senior counsel appearing for the
KIADB in Writ Appeals No.1071/2022, 1064/2022, 1105/2022, 1146/2022 and 1072/2022
contended that the acquisition in question in those appeals was initiated on 09.02.2004. Writ
Petition No.10972/2007 was filed challenging the acquisition. The Writ Petition was allowed by
judgment dated 29.08.2008. However, Writ Appeal No.2288/2008 and connected appeals were
allowed by the Division Bench of this Court on 26.11.2012 and the SLPs filed there from were
dismissed. Thereafter, the subject Writ Petitions were filed seeking compensation in terms of the
2013 Act. Meanwhile, awards were passed on 05.02.2018, which have been quashed by the learned
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/68025422/ 54
The Karnataka Industrial Areas ... vs Venkataramana @ Venakaramanappa on 21 February, 2025
Single Judge.
12. The learned senior counsel took us through the provisions of the KIAD Act to contend that the
said Act is a self contained code. It is contended that a plain reading of Section 24 of the 2013 Act,
would make it clear that the said provision applies only to the acquisitions under 1894 Act and has
no application to any other enactment. It is contended that since the provisions of the KIAD Act are
not under challenge, the writ petitioner could not have sought the reliefs and the learned Single
Judge erred in granting the relief which was not justifiable under the provisions of the statute. It is
submitted that since vesting has already taken place under the provisions of the KIAD Act, a law
which comes into existence after such vesting cannot have any effect on the acquisition in question.
Reliance is placed on the decision of the Apex Court in Pratap v. State of Rajasthan reported in
(1996) 3 SCC 1, in support of the said contention.
13. Apart from the decisions referred earlier, the learned senior counsel and the counsel for the
appellants have also placed reliance on the following decisions:-
• Bangalore Development Authority & Another v. State of Karnataka & Others, by
order dated 20.01.2022 passed in Misc. Application No. 1614-1616/2019;

• Gammon India Ltd. v. Special Chief Secretary & Others, reported in (2006) 3 SCC 354;
• Gem Granites v. Commissioner of Income Tax, Tamil Nadu, reported in (2005) 1 SCC 289;
• Shri Ramtanu Co-operative Housing Society Ltd. & Another v. State of Maharashtra & Others,

passed in W.P.No.64702/2016;
14. Per contra, the learned senior counsel as well as the learned counsel appearing for the
respondents/writ petitioners contended that the incorporation of the provisions of the 1894 Act in
the KIAD Act is clearly a piece of legislation by reference and that any change made in the Act under
reference would apply in the Parent Act as well. It is submitted that it is not a case of amendment of
the 1894 Act, but repeal thereof. Referring to Sections 6 & 8 of the General Clauses Act, 1897, it is
contended that since the 1894 Act stood repealed and replaced by 2013 Act, the reference to the
1894 Act in the KIAD Act will essentially have to be read as a reference to equivalent provisions of
the 2013 Act. Further, it is contended that since the 2022 amendment to Section 30 of the KIAD Act
is by way of substitution, it should be read as always having been a part of the KIAD Act and must be
read as a part of the Act from its inception. It is further contended that the Preliminary Notifications
in some of these cases were issued as early as on 19.12.1988 and no awards have been passed even in
such cases.
15. It is further contended that in some cases though awards had been passed they have not been
approved before the date of coming into force of the 2013 Act and would therefore be non-est in law.
In view of the provisions of Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act, it is contended that even at the time when
there was no interdiction or stay as against the passing of the award, no award has been passed by
the KIADB within one year time as provided under Section 25, even after all the litigations were over
and therefore the finding of the learned Single Judge was perfectly legal and valid. It is submitted
that in cases where no award was passed and no possession was taken also, the appellants are now
trying to take possession of the lands by paying measly compensation by relying on the date of the
Preliminary Notification, which was decades ago.
16. In W.A.No.1105/2022, additional grounds are raised stating that a notice of award under the
1894 Act had been served on the appellants, which was challenged in February 2017 and a stay of
dispossession was granted in the Writ Petition. It is submitted that a memo was filed in the Writ
Petition in December 2020 stating that a general award was passed in the year 2018. The property
was allotted to the private respondents, but the allotment was cancelled by the KIADB. Thereafter,
the cancellation of the allotment was reviewed and the allotment was held proper. It is contended
that if the KIAD Act was a complete code in itself, there would be no need for an incorporation of the
provisions of the Land Acquisition Act into the KIAD Act and therefore, the finding to that effect is
erroneous.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/68025422/ 56
The Karnataka Industrial Areas ... vs Venkataramana @ Venakaramanappa on 21 February, 2025
17. It is submitted that in many of these cases no award was passed in a manner known to law before
01.01.2014 after complying with the due procedure under 1894 Act and as such, the provisions of
the 2013 Act, which was already in force should have been applied. Further, it is contended that the
KIADB itself had taken a decision that the compensation to land losers would be paid based on the
formula provided under the 2013 Act. This proposal was approved by the State Government. It is
therefore contended that in all these cases, where the awards were not passed before 01.01.2014 and
compensation was not paid or possession not taken, the provisions of the 2013 Act for fixing of the
compensation should be followed.
18. Shri V.V. Gunjal, learned counsel appearing for the writ petitioners further contended that the
right to property having been recognized as a valuable human right, the appellants cannot contend
that they will not provide proper and lawful compensation for the valuable property of the Writ
Petitioners for which no proper compensation has been fixed or paid. It is further contended that
Section 24 being only a transitory provision, the non mentioning of the said Section in the 2022
amendment to the KIAD Act is of no consequence. Further, the intention of the 2013 Act being to
facilitate the acquisition of land for public purpose and to promote industrialization in a fair and
transparent manner by providing just compensation, the provisions of the said Act have to be read
into all statutes providing for acquisition of land.
19. The learned senior counsel for the petitioners in W.P.No.12396/2020 submits that the
Notification in his case was under challenge before this Court and there was a stay, which was in
operation only till the year 2004. In 2007, there was a proposal for de-notification and the litigation
was withdrawn with liberty to agitate on the question of compensation relying on the statement of
objects and reasons for the KIAD amendment Act, 2022. It is contended that it is with the laudable
object of granting the benefits of the 2013 Act to land losers affected by acquisitions under the KIAD
Act that the amendment was brought into effect. With regard to the pre-amended Section 30 also, it
is contended, relying on Sections 6 and 8 of the General Clauses Act, that Section 30 is a legislation
by reference and any reference to the Land Acquisition Act in the KIAD Act has to be read as a
reference to the 2013 Act, since the 1894 Act, stands repealed and substituted by the 2013 Act. It is
further contended that since the award has admittedly passed in the year 2019, the compensation
ought to have been computed on the basis of the 2013 Act which was already in force.
20. It is also vehemently contended that the intention of the 2013 Act being to facilitate land
acquisition for public purposes and Industrialization in a fair and transparent manner, by providing
just and fair compensation and resettlement to the persons and families affected thereby, provision
for fair compensation is to be read into all statutes providing for acquisition of land. Since the 2013
Act is a piece of beneficial legislation, all its provisions must be construed liberally with the intention
of extending all possible benefits to the land losers.
21. The learned senior counsel as well as the learned counsel appearing for the respondents/writ
petitioners have relied on the following decisions apart from those that have already been cited by
the appellants.
Amendment by Substitution and effect of Repeal:-

Several other citations have also been relied on by both sides.
22. We have considered the contentions advanced on either side and given our
anxious consideration to the precedents cited. In W.P.No.108802/2016 and
connected cases, the learned Single Judge had formulated the following question for
consideration:-
"Whether in respect of lands notified prior to 01.01.2014 under the KIAD Act, in
respect of which an award has not been passed as on 01.01.2014, awards are required
to be passed under the 1894 Act or the 2013 Act as envisaged in Section 24 (1) of the
2013 Act?"
23. The learned Single Judge considered the provisions of the KIAD Act as well as the
Land Acquisition Act and the 2013 Act and held that with the repeal of 1894 Act and
the enactment of the 2013 Act with effect from 01.01.2014 all references to the 1894
Act in any other statute would have to be construed as a reference to the 2013 Act by
virtue of the Rule of Construction in Section 8 of the General Clauses Act, 1897. It
was therefore held that the references to the provisions in respect of enquiry and
award under the 1894 Act in Section 30 of the KIAD Act would have to be construed
as reference to the provisions of Sections 27 to 30 of the 2013 Act. Further, it was
held that Section 24 of 2013 Act is a provision relating to lapsing of acquisition
initiated under 1894 Act and it begins with a non-obstante clause. It was held that the
decisions in Anasuya Bai's case (supra), and L. Ramareddy's case (supra), were only
on the question of lapsing on the acquisition and did not consider the effect of
Section 24(1) and (2) of the 2013 Act. It was held by the learned Single Judge that
since Section 30 of the KIAD Act amounts to legislation by reference and not by
incorporation, the repeal of the 1894 Act and the enactment of the 2013 Act would
have the effect of making Section 24 of the 2013 Act applicable to acquisition
initiated before 01.01.2014 as well.
Taking note of the amendment of Section 30 of KIAD Act by the amending Act 20 of 2022, it was
held that the intent of the legislature was that in respect of lands acquired under the KIAD Act,
compensation will have to be paid in accordance with the 2013 Act.
24. On these discussions, it was held that in respect of lands notified for acquisition prior to 2014
under the KIAD Act and in respect of which an award has not been passed as on 01.01.2014, the
awards are required to be passed under Section 24(1)(a) of the 2013 Act. The Writ Petitions were
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/68025422/ 63
The Karnataka Industrial Areas ... vs Venkataramana @ Venakaramanappa on 21 February, 2025
thus allowed.
25. We notice that the appellants have raised several pertinent questions before this Court in this
batch of Writ Appeals. They contend that many of those questions already stand answered in favour
of the acquiring authorities and the beneficiaries by binding judgments of the Apex Court or by
Bench decisions of this Court which have been affirmed by the Apex Court. From the pleadings and
contentions raised, we find that the legal points which arise for consideration in this batch of
appeals and petitions are as follows:-
(i) Whether Section 30 of the KIAD Act prior to amendment, which makes the
provisions of the 1894 Act applicable for particular purposes, is a legislation by
reference or a legislation by incorporation?
(ii) Whether the KIAD Act is a self contained Code?
(iii) Whether the other provisions of the 1894 Act except in respect of passing of the
award and payment of compensation are applicable to an acquisition under the KIAD
Act?
(iv) Whether the provisions of the 2013 Act are applicable to a acquisition under the
KIAD Act prior to the amending Act 20 of 2022?
(v) What is the effect of the amending Act of 20 of 2022 on acquisitions under the
KIAD Act?
(vi) Whether the provisions of Sections 24 and 25 of the 2013 Act are applicable to an
acquisition under the KIAD Act?
26. For a proper consideration of the questions raised we are of the opinion that the essential
provisions of the KIAD Act required to be referred to.
27. The statement of objects and reasons of the KIAD Act, reads as follows:-
I. Act 18 of 1966: It is considered necessary to make provision for the orderly
establishment and development of Industries in suitable areas in the State. To
achieve 3 this object, it is proposed to specify suitable areas for Industrial
Development and establish a Board to develop such areas and make available lands
therein for establishment of Industries.
Section 28 of the KIAD Act reads as follows:-
"28. Acquisition of land: (1) If at any time, in the opinion of the State Government, any land is
required for the purpose of development by the Board, or for any other purpose in furtherance of the

such land.
(2) On publication of a notification under sub-section (1), the State Government shall serve notice
upon the owner or where the owner is not the occupier, on the occupier of the land and on all such
persons known or believed to be interested therein to show cause, within thirty days from the date of
service of the notice, why the land should not be acquired.
(3) After considering the cause, if any, shown by the owner of the land and by any other person
interested therein, and after giving such owner and person an opportunity of being heard, the State
Government may pass such orders as it deems fit. (4) After orders are passed under sub-section (3),

(5) On the publication in the official Gazette of the declaration under sub-section (4), the land shall
vest absolutely in the State Government free from all encumbrances.
(6) Where any land is vested in the State Government under sub-section (5), the State Government

deliver possession thereof to the State Government or any person duly authorised by it in this behalf
within thirty days of the service of the notice.
(7) If any person refuses or fails to comply with an order made under sub-section (5), the State
Government or any officer authorised by the State Government in this behalf may take possession of
the land and may for that purpose use such force as may be necessary.
(8) Where the land has been acquired for the Board, the State Government, after it has taken
possession of the land, may transfer the land to the Board for the purpose for which the land has
been acquired."
Section 29 of the KIAD Act reads as follows:-
"29. Compensation: (1) Where any land is acquired by the State Government under this Chapter, the
State Government shall pay for such acquisition compensation in accordance with the provisions of
this Act.
(2) Where the amount of compensation has been determined by agreement between the State
Government and the person to be compensated, it shall be paid in accordance with such agreement.
(3) Where no such agreement can be reached, the State Government shall refer the case to the
Deputy Commissioner for determination of the amount of compensation to be paid for such
acquisition as also the person or persons to whom such compensation shall be paid.

The Karnataka Industrial Areas ... vs Venkataramana @ Venakaramanappa on 21 February, 2025
(4) On receipt of a reference under sub-section (3), the Deputy Commissioner shall serve notice on
the owner or occupier of such land and on all persons known or believed to be interested herein to
appear before him and state their respective interests in the said land." Section 30 of the KIAD Act
prior to amendment read as follows:-
"30. Application of Central Act 1 of 1894: The provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (Central
Act 1 of 1894) shall mutatis mutandis apply in respect of the enquiry and award by the Deputy
Commissioner, the reference to Court, the apportionment of compensation and the payment of
compensation, in respect of lands acquired under this Chapter."
Sections 24 and 25 of the 2013 Act read as under:-
"Section 24. Land acquisition process under Act No. 1 of 1984 shall be deemed to
have lapsed in certain cases. - (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, in
any case of land acquisition proceedings initiated under the Land Acquisition Act,
1894 (1 of 1894),-
(a) where no award under section 11 of the said Land Acquisition Act has been made,
then, all provisions of this Act relating to the determination of compensation shall
apply; or
(b) where an award under said section 11 has been made, then such proceedings shall
continue under the provisions of the said Land Acquisition Act, as if the said Act has
not been repealed.
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-
section (1), in case of land acquisition proceedings initiated under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (1
of 1894), where an award under the said Section 11 has been made five years or more prior to the
commencement of this Act but the physical possession of the land has not been taken or the
compensation has not been paid the said proceedings shall be deemed to have lapsed and the
appropriate Government, if it so chooses, shall initiate the proceedings of such land acquisition
afresh in accordance with the provisions of this Act:
Provided that where an award has been made and compensation in respect of a
majority of land holdings has not been deposited in the account of the beneficiaries,
then, all beneficiaries specified in the notification for acquisition under section 4 of
the said Land Acquisition Act, shall be entitled to compensation in accordance with
the provisions of this Act.
Section 25. Period within which an award shall be made. - The Collector shall make
an award within a period of twelve months from the date of publication of the
declaration under section 19 and if no award is made within that period, the entire
proceedings for the acquisition of the land shall lapse:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/68025422/ 66
The Karnataka Industrial Areas ... vs Venkataramana @ Venakaramanappa on 21 February, 2025
Provided that the appropriate Government shall have the power to extend the period
of twelve months if in its opinion, circumstances exist justifying the same:
Provided further that any such decision to extend the period shall be recorded in
writing and the same shall be notified and be uploaded on the website of the
authority concerned."
28. The amendment to Section 30 incorporated by Act 20 of 2022 is as under:-
"An Act further to amend the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Act, 1966.
Whereas it is expedient to amend the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Act,
1966 (Karnataka Act 18 of 1966) for the purposes hereinafter appearing;
Be it enacted by the Karnataka State Legislature in the seventy third year of the
Republic of India, as follows:-
1. Short title and commencement.- (1) This Act may be called the Karnataka
Industrial Areas Development (Amendment) Act, 2022.
(2) It shall come into force at once.
2. Amendment of section 30.-In the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Act, 1966 (Karnataka
Act 18 of 1966), for section 30, the following shall be substituted, namely:-
"30. Application of Central Act 30 of 2013.- The sections 23, 23A, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30,
64, 65, 69, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 96 and schedule-1 of the Right to fair
compensation and transparency in Land Acquisition, rehabilitation and resettlement
Act, 2013 (Central Act 30 of 2013) shall for that purpose be deemed to form part of
this Act in the same manner as if they were re-enacted in the body thereof in respect
of lands acquired under this Chapter."
29. On the first question, as to whether Section 30 of the KIAD Act prior to its amendment is
legislation by reference or by incorporation, though the same is not specifically answered by the
Apex Court, we notice from the findings in Anasuya Bai's case (supra), that the Apex Court has come
to the conclusion that Section 30 of the KIAD Act was a legislation by incorporation, which is the
reason why the repeal of 1894 Act and enactment of the 2013 Act have been held to be of no
consequence. Further, we also notice that, the Apex Court having held that the KIAD Act is a
complete code in itself, the only logical conclusion would be that Section 30 incorporates the
provisions of the Land Acquisition Act with regard to passing of the award and payment and
apportionment of compensation into the scheme of KIAD Act and it is by the said incorporation that
the act becomes a complete code. Further, in Anasuya Bai's case (supra), the Apex Court has
distinguished the decision in Mariyappa v. State of Karnataka reported in (1998) 3 SCC 276 and
reiterated that KIAD Act is a complete code in itself.

30. The Apex Court also referred to the decision with regard to legislation by incorporation in State
of M.P. v. M.V. Narasimhan reported in (1975) 2 SCC 377, where the tests to determine whether a
legislation is by incorporation or by reference have been re-stated as follows:-
"15. On a consideration of these authorities, therefore, it seems that the following
proposition emerges:
"Where a subsequent Act incorporates provisions of a previous Act then the borrowed
provisions become an integral and independent part of the subsequent Act and are
totally unaffected by any repeal or amendment in the previous Act. This principle,
however, will not apply in the following cases:
(a) where the subsequent Act and the previous Act are supplemental to each other;
(b) where the two Acts are in pari materia;
(c) where the amendment in the previous Act, if not imported into the subsequent Act
also, would render the subsequent Act wholly unworkable and ineffectual; and
(d) where the amendment of the previous Act, either expressly or by necessary
intendment, applies the said provisions to the subsequent Act."
31. Having considered the contentions advanced and in the light of the binding decisions of the Apex
Court, we are of the opinion that the inescapable conclusion would be that un- amended Section 30
of the KIAD Act was indeed a legislation by incorporation and not by reference. If it is held
otherwise, the finding that the KIAD Act is a complete code in itself would be rendered otiose and
meaningless. The first question raised is answered holding that Section 30 of the KIAD Act, prior to
amendment also is a piece of legislation by incorporation.
32. The second question whether the KIAD Act is a self contained code already stands answered in
the affirmative in M. Nagabhushana's case (supra). The learned counsel for the respondents raised a
contention that the said finding is not a reasoned one and that since it is obvious that the provisions
of the 1894 Act have to be resorted to in the matter of enquiry and award and the apportionment
and payment of compensation, the finding is totally unsupported. Having referred to the judgments
relied on, we are of the opinion that since the provisions of the 1894 Act stand incorporated into the
KIAD Act by Section 30, the finding that the KIAD Act is a complete code in itself is perfectly
justified and is binding on us. The said issue also therefore stands answered in the affirmative.
33. With regard to the third question, whether the other provisions of the 1894 Act except in respect
of passing of the award and payment of compensation are applicable to an acquisition under the
KIAD Act, the Apex Court has already held in Anasuya Bai's case (supra), that the provisions of the
Land Acquisition Act except those which are specifically incorporated by Section 30 would have no
application to an acquisition under the KIAD Act. In M. Nagabhushana's case (supra) and earlier
citations have also pointedly considered this issue. The said question is therefore answered in the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/68025422/ 68
The Karnataka Industrial Areas ... vs Venkataramana @ Venakaramanappa on 21 February, 2025
negative.
34. As regards the fourth question, whether the provisions of the 2013 Act are applicable to a
acquisition under the KIAD Act prior to the amending Act 20 of 2022, from reading of the
judgments relied on either side, we notice that the legal proposition which arises is as follows:-
A co-equal bench of this Court in L. Ramareddy's case, at paragraph No.44, held as
under:-
"44. In the circumstances, it is concluded and held that Section 24 does not take
within its scope nor does it apply to acquisitions which have been initiated under the
provisions of any other enactment particularly, State enactment, such as, BDA Act.
The said Section is restricted to only those acquisitions which have been initiated
under the provisions of the LA Act, 1894 only. Subject to compliance of the
conditions mentioned under sub-section (2) of Section 24, the land owner would be
entitled to the deeming provision regarding lapse of acquisition and not otherwise."
This Court in Ananthaswamy's case at paragraph No.41 held as under:-
41. Therefore, for a declaration of lapse of acquisition, the pre-conditions or
conditions precedent mentioned under sub-section (2) of Section 24 of the 2013 Act
must apply. Most importantly the said conditions must prevail in an acquisition
initiated under the provisions of the LA Act, 1894, and not with regard to acquisition
initiated under any other enactment be it Central or State enactment. Therefore,
before land owners could seek relief under sub-section (2) of Section 24 of 2013 Act,
which is a right created in their favour, the basic postulate that must be borne in
mind is to ascertain, in the first instance, as to under which law, acquisition has been
initiated; whether under the provisions of the LA Act, 1894 or any other law. If it is
under any other law, then in my view Section 24 would not be applicable to such
acquisitions. As already noted, KIAD Act, being distinct having a different object and
scope and acquisition of lands being only incidental to the main object and scope
under the said Act, the acquisition proceedings initiated under the said Act cannot be
considered on par, so as to hold that land acquisition proceedings initiated under the
provisions of the KIAD Act are "land acquisition proceedings initiated under the
provisions of the LA Act, 1894".
35. The fourth question raised also stands answered in the negative by the judgments in L.
Ramareddy's case (supra) and in Ananthaswamy's case (supra). The said decisions of this Court also
stand affirmed by the Apex Court. We are in agreement with the findings of the co-ordinate bench,
which have been affirmed by the Apex Court. Therefore, we hold that the provisions of the 2013 Act
are not applicable to an acquisition under the KIAD Act until they are made applicable by the
amendment of 2022.

36. With regard to the fifth question, it is clear that the amendment by substitution is specifically
made applicable from the date of effect of the Notification of the amendment. The Amendment Act,
2022 is specifically made prospective in operation.
37. The co-ordinate Bench of this Court in Sri M. Suresh v. Smt. Mahadevamma, reported in AIR
Online 2020 KAR 2621, has held that, it is clear that ordinarily, the effect of amendment by
'substitution' is that, the substituted provision stands repealed and the amended provision is
substituted in the place of earlier provision from the date of inception of the enactment, but it is not
applicable in all circumstances. If the amendment Act expressly specifies that the substituted
provision shall come into force from a particular date subsequent to the date of amendment/the
date the amendment comes into force, the said amendment is prospective in nature,
notwithstanding the fact that such amendment is by way of 'substitution'.
38. In the light of the specific wording of the Notification, we are of the opinion that the amendment
is intended to have effect from the date of Notification of the amended Act i.e., 04.04.2022. The
provisions which were not in effect cannot be held to have been a part of the KIAD Act from the date
of its inception since that would lead to a legal perversity. From the pleadings and the materials on
record, we are of the opinion that the amendment to Section 30 of the KIAD Act has been given
effect to in respect of all acquisitions initiated after 01.01.2014. However, the contentions that the
provisions would be applicable to pre 01.01.2014 notifications cannot be accepted. We also notice
that the amended Section 30 of the KIAD Act also does not refer to the provisions of either Section
24 or Section 25 of the 2013 Act. We are therefore unable to accept the contention of the
respondents that Section 24 and Section 25 can be pressed into service in the case of an acquisition
under the KIAD Act, to which such provisions are not applicable.
39. In the above view of the matter, we are of the opinion that the judgment of the learned Single
Judge was against the settled position of law and cannot be sustained. The appeals therefore
succeed.
(i) Writ Appeals are allowed. The findings of the learned Single Judge that Section 24(2) of the 2013
Act is applicable to acquisitions under the KIAD Act initiated before 01.01.2014, shall stand vacated.
(ii) Writ Petitions, which were the subject matter of the appeals shall stand dismissed with liberty to
seek enhancement of compensation in accordance with law.
(iii) Writ Petitions No.56771/2013, 35406/2014, 10489/2015, 23940/2015 and 12396/2020, insofar
as they raise contentions with regard to applicability of 2013 Act to acquisitions initiated before
01.01.2014 shall stand dismissed. However, it is made clear that it will be open to the writ
petitioners to avail the statutory remedies as available under the KIAD Act and seek enhancement of
the compensation, in accordance with law.
(iv) CCC No.100143/2023 shall be de-linked and listed separately for consideration.

(v) In case, any other questions arise for consideration on merits de-hors what has been decided in
these appeals, the land losers are free to take up such contentions in accordance with law in
appropriate proceedings.
(vi) The adequacy of the compensation is left open to be decided under the provisions of the KIAD
Act.
Pending IAs., if any, in all the appeals and petitions, shall stand disposed of.
