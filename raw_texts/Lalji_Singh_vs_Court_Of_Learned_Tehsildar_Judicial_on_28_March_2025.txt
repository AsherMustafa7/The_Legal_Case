Lalji Singh vs Court Of Learned Tehsildar Judicial, ... on 28 March, 2025
T202404040300706; (Lalji Vs. Ram Jiyawan), Under Section 34 of U.P. Revenue
Code, 2006 for entering name into revenue record, expeditiously as this Hon'ble
Court may deemed fit which is pending before Opposite Party No. 1 since 01.02.2024,
(contained in Annexure No.1 to this petition), in the interest of justice."
Considering the fact that the case in issue relates to mutation and as per Rule 34(7) of U.P. Revenue
Code Rules, 2016 made under the U.P. Revenue Code, 2006, the mutation proceedings, being
summary in nature, ought to have been decided within 45 days if there is no dispute and if there is
dispute, then the same should preferably be decided within 90 days, however, in the instant case,
the proceedings for mutation are pending since February, 2024, this Court is of the view that no
gainful purpose will be served in keeping the present petition pending.
In view of above, the present petition is disposed of with a direction to the respondent
No.1/Tehsildar Judicial, Tehsil Tanda, District Ambedkar Nagar to consider and decide theMutation
case No. T202404040300706 (Lalji Vs. Ram Jiyawan) most expeditiously after affording full
opportunity of hearing to the parties to the litigation and without granting unnecessary
adjournment to either party preferably within a period of three months from the next date fixed in
the case, if there is no other legal impediment in this regard.
It is made clear that the Court has not examined the case of either party on merits and the Authority
concerned shall be free to decide the matter strictly in accordance with law.
With the aforesaid, the petition is disposed of.
