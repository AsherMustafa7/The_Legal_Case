5. Before adverting to the rival submissions as regards applicability of Section 143 and 149 are
concerned, it would be necessary to refer to a judgment of a coordinate bench of this court in
ATHAULLA JOKATTE AND OTHERS. VS. THE STATE OF KARNATAKA AND ANOTHER passed
in Crl.P.No.4902/2023 dated 19.06.2023, wherein it is held as under:
The petitioners are before this Court calling in question the proceedings in Criminal
Case No.1131 of 2020 pending on the file of the II Judicial Magistrate First Class
Court, Mangaluru, registered for the offences punishable under Sections 143, 147,

"2. The issue in the petition is akin to what is decided in Crl.P.No.3916/2018
disposed on 17.02.2020, wherein this Court has examined the identical facts and
offences alleged against the petitioners therein. While so examining, this Court has
held as follows:
"4. The gist of the complaint is that on 23.05.2017 at about 11.30 a.m., received a
credible information that a group of people gathered on Queen's Road shouting
slogans against the Government. Immediately, he went to the spot and found that 50
young men assembled illegally and disturbed the public and vehicles without prior
permission from the station. On enquiry he found that they are the members of
Campus Front of India Karnataka and protesting against interference religious and
personal freedoms by imposing dress code in 'AIIMS Exam' which is against the
personal and religious rights of our Constitution. Immediately they were disbursed
and a case has been registered and after investigation, the charge sheet has been
filed.
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR
5. It is the submission of the learned counsel for petitioners that though there is no
substantial material as against petitioners/ accused Nos.1 to 48, the respondent have
investigated the case and have filed the charge sheet against petitioners/accused
Nos.1 to 48. It is his further submission that in order to file a charge sheet under
Section 143 of IPC, the unlawful assembly must satisfy the ingredients as
contemplated under Section 141 of IPC but none of the ingredients are satisfied in
this case. It is his further submission that mere presence in an unlawful assembly,
cannot render a person liable unless there was a common object, they were actuated
by the common object and that object is one of those set out under Section 141 of IPC.
It is his further submission that if the common object of an unlawful assembly is not
proved, the accused persons cannot be convicted either under Section 143 of IPC or
under Section 149 of IPC. It is his further submission that the prosecution has to
prove the overt-acts as against the persons who have been alleged as a member of
unlawful assembly. In order to substantiate his said contention, he has relied upon
the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of CHARAN NC: 2025:KHC:25485
HC-KAR SINGH AND OTHERS Vs. STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH reported in
(2004) 4 SCC 205. It is his further submission that as per the Licensing and
Controlling of Assemblies and Public Processions (Bangalore City) Order 2009, the
permission is required in Bangalore City if the congregation of more than 250
persons assembling at one place with an intention to conduct the meeting, protest, to
hear a public speech including political, social, religious and cultural meetings to
which the public have got free access. The said condition specially says that no
permission or license is required in Bangalore City if the congregation of more than
250 persons assembling at one place with an intention of conducting meeting to
protest. It is the specific submission that petitioners/accused Nos.1 to 48 have given
the letter dated 20.05.2017 seeking permission but no such permission is granted by

Sri Sathish Reddy M vs State By Bommanahalli on 11 July, 2025
the Commissioner of Police., under such circumstance, the said assembly cannot be
held as an unlawful assembly and the provisions of Sections 141, 143, 147, 149, 188 of
IPC are not attracted. On these grounds, he prayed to allow the petition and to quash
the proceedings.
- 10 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR
6. Per contra, learned High Court Government Pleader vehemently argued and submitted that as
per the Licensing and Controlling of Assemblies and Public Processions (Bangalore City) order,
2009 the congregation of more than 250 persons is required but as per Section 141 of IPC, an
assembly of five or more persons is considered to be an unlawful assembly and if they have
assembled with a common object, then under such circumstance, accused persons can be prosecuted
for the alleged offences. It is his further submission that the contents of the complaint and other
materials clearly indicate that they were intending to proceed to Raj Bhavan in that light, they have
obstructed the public traffic, public movement and thereby, they have violated the provisions of
Section 141 of IPC and other provisions of law. It is his further submission that there are
independent eye- witnesses and they have also categorically stated with regard to the overt-acts of
each of the accused persons and there is ample materials to connect the accused persons to the
alleged crime. On these ground, he prayed to dismiss the petition.
7. I have carefully and cautiously gone through the submissions made by the
- 11 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR learned counsel appearing for both the parties and perused the
records.
8. On perusal of records, it is the case of the prosecution that the petitioners/accused Nos.1 to 48
have assembled and were protesting against interference and dress code imposed by AIIMS exam
and also have not obtained any permission from the concerned Authorities. But as could be seen
from the Licensing and Controlling of Assemblies and Public Processions (Bangalore City) Order,
2009 assembly means a congregation of more than 250 persons assembling at one place with an
intention of conducting meeting or protest, to hear a public speech including political, social,
religious and cultural meetings to which the public have got free access, license is required only
when more than 250 persons are there. Admittedly in the instant case, the contents of the complaint
and other materials indicates that only 50 persons have assembled. In that light, a license said to
have been is not necessary as per the Order of 2009. The only question which remains for
consideration of this Court is that whether the assembly of petitioners/accused Nos.1 to 48 had
constituted an unlawful assembly as per
- 12 -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108120667/ 6
Sri Sathish Reddy M vs State By Bommanahalli on 11 July, 2025
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR Section 141 of IPC? In order to attract the said provision, the
assembly must satisfy five ingredients which have been stated therein but on close reading of the
contents of the complaint, charge sheet material and other materials, it indicates that none of the
ingredients are present as contemplated under Section 141 of IPC.
9. Be that as it may. If 50 persons have assembled at a particular place, then under such
circumstance, it cannot be held as an unlawful assembly. Mere presence of a person in an unlawful
assembly cannot render a person liable unless there was a common object and he was actuated by
that common object and that object is one of those set out in Section 141 of IPC. This proposition of
law has been laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of CHARAN SINGH (Quoted supra) at
paragraph No.13, it has been observed as under:
"13. Coming to the others who were armed with double-barrelled guns and country-
made pistols, the question is regarding applicability of Section 149 IPC. Section 149
IPC has its foundation on constructive liability which is the sine qua non for its
operation. The emphasis is on the common object and not on common intention.
Mere presence in an unlawful assembly cannot
- 13 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR render a person liable unless there was a common
object and he was actuated by that common object and that object is one of those set
out in Section 141. Where common object of an unlawful assembly is not proved, the
accused persons cannot be convicted with the help of Section 149. The crucial
question to determine is whether the assembly consisted of five or more persons and
whether the said persons entertained one or more of the common objects, as
specified in Section 141. It cannot be laid down as a general proposition of law that
unless an overt act is proved against a person, who is alleged to be a member of an
unlawful assembly, it cannot be said that he is a member of an assembly. The only
thing required is that he should have understood that the assembly was unlawful and
was likely to commit any of the acts which fall within the purview of Section 141. The
word "object"
means the purpose or design and, in order to make it "common", it must be shared by all. In other
words, the object should be common to the persons, who compose the assembly, that is to say, they
should all be aware of it and concur in it. A common object may be formed by express agreement
after mutual consultation, but
- 14 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR that is by no means necessary. It may be formed at any stage by all
or a few members of the assembly and the other members may just join and adopt it. Once formed,
it need not continue to be the same. It may be modified or altered or abandoned at any stage. The
expression "in prosecution of common object" as appearing in Section 149 has to be strictly
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108120667/ 7
Sri Sathish Reddy M vs State By Bommanahalli on 11 July, 2025
construed as equivalent to "in order to attain the common object". It must be immediately
connected with the common object by virtue of the nature of the object. There must be community
of object and the object may exist only up to a particular stage, and not thereafter. Members of an
unlawful assembly may have community of object up to a certain point beyond which they may
differ in their objects and the knowledge, possessed by each member of what is likely to be
committed in prosecution of their common object may vary not only according to the information at
his command, but also according to the extent to which he shares the community of object, and as a
consequence of this the effect of Section 149 IPC may be different on different members of the same
assembly."
- 15 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR
10. On close perusal of the charge sheet material, it indicates that none of the ingredients specify in
Section 141 of IPC are present so as to attract the provisions of Sections 141, 143, 149, 188 of IPC.
When that being the case, then under such circumstances, the proceedings initiated as against
petitioners/accused Nos.1 to 48 appears to be not in accordance with law and the same is liable to be
quashed.
11. Accordingly, petition is allowed and the proceedings initiated in C.C. No.23259/2017 pending on
the file of VIII Additional CMM, Bengalulru for the offence punishable under Section 143 read with
Section 149 of IPC is hereby quashed."
The aforesaid order passed by a Co-ordinate Bench of this Court would cover, the case at hand on all
its fours. That apart, there were no witnesses that would speak about the incident alleged against the
petitioners which has happened in a broad day light, apart from all the witnesses examined being
police officials."
4. Therefore, in the light of the order passed by the Co-ordinate Bench of this Court supra, the
following:
ORDER i. Criminal petition is allowed.
- 16 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR ii. Proceedings pending in Criminal Case No.1131 of

5. So also the judgment in PRAKASH KARAT AND OTHERS VS. STATE OF KERALA
REPRESENTED BY THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR AND ANOTHER, 2022 SCC ONLINE KER 5243,
the Kerala High Court held as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108120667/ 8
Sri Sathish Reddy M vs State By Bommanahalli on 11 July, 2025
(1.) The Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) was formed between ten
nations of South East Asia. On 13/8/2009, India entered into a trade agreement with
the ASEAN countries. The signing of the agreement was not well received by a few of
the political parties. In a bid to compel the Union Government to withdraw from the
ASEAN free trade agreement, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) decided to
form a Statewide human chain in Kerala to be lined up on the sides of the National
Highway. The human chain is alleged to have been created over a distance of 500
kilometres, from Kasaragode in the north to Thiruvananthapuram in the south.
(2.) An Advocate practising in the courts at Thiruvananthapuram preferred a private complaint
before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Thiruvananthapuram alleging that the human chain
formed on 2/10/2009 between 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the
- 17 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR behest of accused 1 to 12 and 10,000 other identifiable persons
resulted in the commission of offences under Sec. 143, 147, 149 and 283 of the Indian Penal
Code,1860 apart from sec. 38 r/w sec. 52 of the Kerala Police Act, 1960.
(3.) The complaint also refers to another incident on the same day at 3 p.m., when the Sub Inspector
of Police attached to the Museum Police Station, Thiruvananthapuram, noticed ten young men
constructing an open stage on the road and footpath in a manner causing obstruction to the right of
way of the public. According to the complainant, despite the police commanding them to desist from
the construction, the young men proceeded to set up an open platform and enabled accused 1 to 12
to address the party workers as part of the human chain. The complaint further alleged that though
Crime No.626 of 2009 was registered against ten identifiable persons, no steps were initiated to
arrest the accused or to remove the stage constructed and that the acts of those accused constituted
a violation of the decisions of this Court in Peoples Council for Social Justice v. State of Kerala (1997
(2) KLT 301) as well as Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samithi v. State of Kerala (2004 (2) KLT
857). On the above allegations, the complainant sought to prosecute the accused.
4. The sworn statement of the complainant was taken, and his witnesses were also examined.
Thereafter, the learned Magistrate took cognizance of the offence as S.T. No. 4129 of 2012 and
issued process Court, to the
- 18 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR accused. Later, by order dated 14.11.2012, the case was transferred
to the Chief Judicial Magistrate's Thiruvananthapuram and renumbered as C.C. No. 1530 of 2012.
5. Petitioners are accused 1 to 12. All of them claim to be leaders of the Communist Party of India
(Marxist). They have approached this Court under section 482 of Cr.P.C, alleging that the complaint
is filed with malafide intentions and for oblique motives and that the offences alleged are not made
out.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108120667/ 9
Sri Sathish Reddy M vs State By Bommanahalli on 11 July, 2025
6. Sri. Gilbert George Correya, the learned counsel for the petitioners contended that the accused,
which include the present Chief Minister of Kerala, the former General Secretary of the Communist
Party of India (Marxist), as well as the former Chief Minister of Kerala and other senior leaders of
the Communist Party of India, have never acted contrary to law. It was submitted that no one had
come forward with any personal grievance or inconvenience or even prejudice that was caused on
account of the human chain programme organised by the Communist Party of India (Marxist). The
learned counsel submitted that the human chain was formed in exercise of their right under Article
19 of the Constitution of India as a measure of showing their protest against an act that they
presumed to be contrary to their beliefs. According to the learned counsel, the offences alleged are
not made out against
- 19 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR the petitioners, and hence the private complaint is liable to be
quashed.
7. Sri. T.A. Shaji, the learned Director General of Prosecution, assisted by Sri. K. A Noushad, the
learned Public Prosecutor submitted that the offences alleged are not made out and further that the
allegations are politically motivated. It was also submitted that, even if the entire proceedings are
continued, the trial cannot end in the conviction of the accused for more reasons than one. The
learned Director General of Prosecution also submitted that this is a fit case where the jurisdiction
of this Court under section 482 ought to be invoked to quash the proceedings.
8. Though notice to the defacto complainant was served, it is seen from the records that except for a
request to file an objection to the stay petition on 26.02.2015, there has not been any representation
for the second respondent thereafter.
9. Political leaders of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) face indictment under sections 143,
147, 149 and section 283 of the Penal Code, 1860, apart from sections 38 and 52 of the Kerala Police
Act, 1960. Section 143 of IPC deals with punishment for unlawful assembly. while section 147 deals
with punishment for rioting. Section 149 makes an act committed by any member of the unlawful
assembly in prosecution of their common object punishable as if the same was done by
- 20 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR every member of the assembly. Section 283 makes danger or
obstruction in a pathway punishable. Sections 38 and 52 of the erstwhile Kerala Police Act make the
failure to conform to lawful and reasonable directions of police officers penal and punishable.
10. True that the accused are the leaders of a political party. However, the leadership of a political
party is not an immunity against prosecution. Even if the accused are leaders of the society, if an
offence is made out from the complaint, they are liable to face prosecution. But on the other hand, if
the offences alleged are not made out from the complaint, the position of the accused shall not deter
the Court from interfering in an unnecessary prosecution. Thus the question to be considered is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108120667/ 10
Sri Sathish Reddy M vs State By Bommanahalli on 11 July, 2025
whether, from the allegations in the private complaint, the offences alleged are made out or not.
11. Of the offences alleged, one of the main allegations relates to unlawful assembly, which is the
basis for the offences under sections 143, 147 and 149 of the IPC. The term unlawful assembly comes
under chapter VIII, dealing with public tranquillity. The term is defined in Section 141 of the IPC
and reads as follows:
"141. Unlawful assembly.-An assembly of five or more persons is designated an
"unlawful assembly", if the common object of the persons composing that assembly is
- 21 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR First To overawe by criminal force, or show of
criminal force, the Central or any State Government or Parliament or the Legislature
of any State, or any public servant in the exercise of the lawful power of such public
servant; or Second To resist the execution of any law, or of any legal process; or Third
To commit any mischief or criminal trespass, or other offence; or Fourth - By means
of criminal force, or show of criminal force, to any person, to take or obtain
possession of any property, or to deprive any person of the enjoyment of a right of
way, or of the use of water or other incorporeal right of which he is in possession or
enjoyment, or to enforce any right or supposed right; or Fifth - By means of criminal
force, or show of criminal force, to compel any person to do what he is not legally
bound to do, or to omit to do what he is legally entitled to do.
Explanation.-An assembly which assembled, may subsequently become an unlawful
assembly.
- 22 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR
12. A reading of the above provision reveals that the ingredients of unlawful assembly are:
(i) there must be an assembly of five or more persons,
(ii) the members of the assembly must have a common object,
(iii) the common object must be any one of the following five:
(a) to overawe by criminal force or show of criminal force, the Government or any
public servant,
(b) to resist the execution of any law or legal process, or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108120667/ 11
Sri Sathish Reddy M vs State By Bommanahalli on 11 July, 2025
(c) to commit mischief or criminal trespass or other offences,
(d) by criminal force or show of criminal force to take or obtain possession of any
property or deprive enjoyment of a right of way or use of water or other incorporeal
rights
(e) by criminal force or show of criminal force to compel any other person to do what
he is legally not
- 23 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR bound to do or omit to do that which he is legally bound to do.
13. A reading of the section indicates that every assembly of five or more persons by itself will not
become an unlawful assembly. An assembly of five or more persons will become unlawful only when
they have a common object and the said object falls within the categories mentioned as first to fifth
in section 141 IPC. When the common object of the assembly does not fall within any of the five
categories specified in section 141, even if the number of the assembly is more than five, the act
alleged will not attract the offence of unlawful assembly. Thus the essence of the offence of unlawful
assembly lies in the consensus of purpose of more than five persons to commit an act specified in
section 141 of IPC.
14. It is apposite to notice that of the five categories in the provision, three of them have criminal
force as a necessary ingredient. Force is defined in section 349 IPC, while criminal force is defined in
section 350 IPC. The intentional use of force for committing an offence or for causing injury, fear or
annoyance is an essential requirement of criminal force. The remaining two facets require resistance
to the execution of law or of legal process or the commission of the offence of mischief or criminal
trespass.
- 24 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR
15. The principles constituting the offence of unlawful assembly have been succinctly analysed by
the Supreme Court in Masalti v. State of Uttar Pradesh (AIR 1965 SC
202) and also in Akthar Alam alias Aktarul Sheikh v. State of West Bengal [(2009) 7 SCC 415].
Reference to the decision in Aravindan v. State of Kerala (1983 KLT
193) is also relevant. In Aravindan's case this Court observed that "the mere fact that an assembly
consists of five or more persons is likely to disturb the public peace does not prove that the common
object of the assembly is one of those enumerated in the Section. But there, S. 151 of the Penal Code,
1860 may come in and it has been held that the common object must be an immediate one and not
to be carried out at some future time".
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108120667/ 12
Sri Sathish Reddy M vs State By Bommanahalli on 11 July, 2025
16. On a perusal of the complaint, it is seen that though the complainant alleges that more than five
persons had assembled together, there is no mention of any of the ingredients that can attract any
one of the five facets described as 'first to fifth' of section 141 IPC. The complainant has no case that
the accused had a common object to commit any offence or, for that matter, any of the offences
specified in section 141 IPC.
17. The assembly was apparently, as alleged by the complainant himself, formed only to express
their protest against the Government signing an agreement with the ASEAN Countries. No criminal
force or show of criminal force is alleged to have been committed by any one of
- 25 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR the accused or, for that matter, by any of the assembly of 10,000
and more persons. There is not even a whisper in the complaint about any resistance to the
execution of any law or legal process. There is also no allegation of any mischief or criminal trespass
committed by any member of the assembly or even any deprivation of the right of way by the use of
criminal force. There is also no allegation of compelling any person to do that which he is not legally
bound to do by use of criminal force.
18. As mentioned earlier, section 141 IPC significantly uses the words 'criminal force' in the three
facets of the provision. Thus, a protest or an assembly of persons without any criminal force or show
of criminal force would not make the assembly unlawful. An assembly of more than five persons
gathered for a peaceful protest cannot fall within the term unlawful assembly. The right to protest
peaceably is an essential ingredient of the fundamental right under Article 19(1)(a) and 19(1)(b) of
the Constitution of India. An assembly of persons without arms or without criminal force or without
any intent to commit an offence can only be a lawful assembly, which is not prohibited. Such an
assembly is a formation in the exercise of the right to freedom of every citizen guaranteed under
Article 19(1) of the Constitution.
19. In this context, it is appropriate to observe that the right to freedom of speech and expression
and the right to form an assembly guaranteed under the Constitution will be a dead letter if every
assembly is regarded as
- 26 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR offensive conduct. The right to dissent and the freedom to air views
contrary to the views of the government is not an offensive conduct. In fact, the right to dissent is
the core of every democratic establishment. The constitutional scheme of our Country embodies the
salutary principle of the right to dissent. When the dissent is expressed without causing any harm or
even a significant inconvenience, it would be too puerile to proceed criminally against the
dissenters. Merely because the dissent is not acceptable to the majority, that is not a reason to
initiate criminal action unless the dissent was coupled with violent, disorderly or damaging conduct
by any member of the assembly.

Sri Sathish Reddy M vs State By Bommanahalli on 11 July, 2025
20. In this context, I am mindful of the decision in Amit Sahni (Shaheen Bagh, In Re) v.
Commissioner of Police [(2020) 10 SCC 439], where the Supreme Court had while upholding the
right to dissent, directed the protests to be carried out only in designated areas. In the said decision,
the Court was concerned with the indefinite and long periods of protests being held at Shaheen
Bagh, causing absolute inconvenience to the public. The situation is different in the present case.
21. In the instant case, there is no allegation of any criminal force used by any of the accused or any
of the members of the said assembly. There is no allegation of any common object for committing an
offence or that the human chain lasted indefinitely. There is also no case that there was any
inconvenience or obstruction to the
- 27 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR public for an extended period of time. The complainant has not
alleged that the normal life of the community was crippled or paralysed. There is not even an
allegation that the complainant was obstructed. In such circumstances, I am of the view that the
conduct alleged against the petitioners does not satisfy the ingredients of section 141, IPC, i.e.
unlawful assembly.
22. When the allegations do not satisfy the ingredients of unlawful assembly, the offences under
sections 143, 147 and 149 IPC cannot be attracted. Therefore, petitioners cannot be prosecuted for
the aforesaid offences.
23. Another allegation in the complaint is that under section 283 IPC, which reads as follows.
"283. Danger or obstruction in public way or line of navigation. Whoever, by doing
any act, or by omitting to take order with any property in his possession or under his
charge, causes danger, obstruction or injury to any person in any public way or public
line of navigation, shall be punished with fine which may extend to two hundred
rupees."
24. The complaint alleges that the obstruction in the form of constructing a stage or a pandal was
carried out by ten other persons and not by the petitioners at all.
- 28 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR There is no whisper of an allegation that petitioners 1 to 12 were
involved in the construction of the stage pandal. The complainant has not alleged any role for the
petitioners in constructing the open stage/platform. The allegation is that petitioners had sat and
spoken from inside the pandal. Merely because petitioners sat in the open stage/platform, they
cannot be attributed with any overt act in the construction of the said stage/platform. In this
context, it is relevant to notice that the complainant himself alleged that Crime No. 626 of 2009 of
the Museum Police Station was registered against the ten persons found to be constructing and
supervising the construction of the said stage. It was submitted across the Bar that the said crime
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108120667/ 14
Sri Sathish Reddy M vs State By Bommanahalli on 11 July, 2025
was investigated, and a report was submitted referring the crime as 'undetected'. In the absence of
any allegation against petitioners 1 to 12, proceeding in a criminal action against them for the
offence under section 283 IPC is an abuse of the process of law.
25. As far as the offences under sections 38 and 52 of the Kerala Police Act 1960 are concerned, they
relate to the failure to abide by the lawful directions of the police. There is no allegation that
petitioners had failed to abide by any lawful directions of the police. On the contrary, the said
allegation is specifically raised against ten other persons and not the petitioners. The averments in
the complaint, thus, are not sufficient to proceed against the petitioners for the said offences.
- 29 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR
26. Perceived from the angle of section 95 of IPC also, this Court is of the view that the proceedings
against the petitioners are liable to be quashed. Section 95 IPC, states that "Nothing is an offence by
reason that it causes, or that it is intended to cause, or that it is known to cause, any harm, if that
harm is so slight that no person of ordinary sense and temper would complain of such harm". The
aforesaid section embodies the principle of 'de minimis non curat lex' meaning that "law does not
take into account trifles". The intention behind the aforesaid provision is to avoid penalising
negligible wrongs or trivial offences. There are innumerable acts in our daily life which may amount
to crimes in the strict sense of the language employed in the statute. However, if prosecution is
initiated for every such triviality, the system will crumble. Section 95 comes to the aid in such
instances.
27. However, care must be taken before applying the principle. In Veeda Menezes v. Yusuf Khan
Haji Ibrahim Khan (AIR 1966 SC 1773), the Supreme Court observed that "whether an act which
amounts to an offence is trivial would undoubtedly depend upon the nature of the injury, the
position of the parties, the knowledge or intention with which the offending act was done, and other
related circumstances". The principle of de minimis non curat lex was applied by this Court in the
decision in Narayanan v. State of Kerala (1986 KLT 1265) where it was held that, if the harm caused
or intended to be caused is so slight that no person of ordinary sense and
- 30 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR temper would complain of such harm, the principle can be applied.
Similarly, In Re Attappa (AIR 1951 Mad 759) the Madras High Court held that even if an obstruction
is caused, if the harm caused is so slight, section 95 of the IPC will apply.
28. Applying the principle in section 95 IPC, it can unhesitatingly be held that the allegations can at
the most reveal some obstructions caused on the public way while the petitioner held their hands for
a limited period of time. Even if it is assumed that any slight obstruction was caused to the public,
the same was only a trifle. This is evident from the fact that, no one other than the complainant had
any grievance. In this context, the cost of adjudication, the time required to be spent for
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108120667/ 15
Sri Sathish Reddy M vs State By Bommanahalli on 11 July, 2025
prosecution, the absence of any harm caused to the complainant or on any other person, absence of
any violence and the intention of engaging in a peaceful protest are factors that cannot be lost sight
of.
29. Having regard to all the above reasons this Court is of the opinion that continuance of
proceedings against the petitioners as C.C. No. 1530 of 2012 on the files of the Chief Judicial
Magistrate Court, Thiruvananthapuram, is an abuse of the process of court and is liable to be
interfered with.
30. Hence, I quash Annexure-1, and all further proceedings in S.T. No. 4129/2012 on the files of the
Judicial First Class Magistrates Court- I,
- 31 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR Thiruvanathapuram, now renumbered as C.C. No. 1530 of 2012 on
the files of the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Thiruvananthapuram and allow this petition.
6. If the impugned complaint is examined keeping in mind the principles enunciated in the
aforesaid judgment, it is clear that except stating that on 02.12.203 the petitioner along with others
had formed an unlawful assembly, there are absolutely no other allegation against the petitioner and
the impugned complaint contains vague, bald and omnibus allegation, which are not sufficient to
attract the ingredients contained in Section 143, 149 or 268 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 and
consequently the impugned proceedings qua the petitioner deserves to be quashed.
7. Insofar as the offences punishable under Section 188 is concerned, it is well settled that the said
provision can be invoked only by the competent officer as contemplated under Section 195 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 as held by this court at page 40 SRI.UMANATH A KOTIAN VS.
STATE OF KARNATAKA AND ANOTHER passed in Crl.P.No.4745/2024 dated 08.08.2024, which

AND OTHERS VS. STATE REP. BY INSPECTOR OF POLICE AND ANOTHER, 2018 SCC ONLINE
MAD 13698.
8. In JEEVANANDHAM supra, the Madras High Court held as under:
An important issue has arisen for consideration in these batch of cases. It is seen that
a flurry of cases registered by the Police under Section 188 of Indian Penal Code
[IPC], along with other offences becomes a subject matter of challenge before this
Court on a daily basis. In spite of certain earlier decisions with regard to the manner
in which an offence under Section 188 of IPC can be proceeded against certain
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108120667/ 16
Sri Sathish Reddy M vs State By Bommanahalli on 11 July, 2025
persons who are alleged to have committed the said offence, and who has to file a
complaint with regard to such an offence, has been spelt out in those decisions.
Despite the same, the Police continue to register an FIR under Section 188 of IPC
along with other offences. Therefore, this Court thought it fit to discuss the law on the
point in detail and give certain guidelines to be followed in future by the Police while
dealing with an offence under Section 188 of IPC.
2.The provision under Section 188 of IPC is extracted hereunder:
- 33 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR
188. Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant.? Whoever, knowing
that, by an order promulgated by a public servant lawfully empowered to promulgate
such order, he is directed to abstain from a certain act, or to take certain order with
certain property in his possession or under his management, disobeys such direction,
shall, if such disobedience causes or tends to cause obstruction, annoyance or injury,
or risk of obstruction, annoyance or injury, to any person lawfully employed, be
punished with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to one month or
with fine which may extend to two hundred rupees, or with both; and if such
disobedience causes or trends to cause danger to human life, health or safety, or
causes or tends to cause a riot or affray, shall be punished with imprisonment of
either description for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine which may
extend to one thousand rupees, or with both?.
Explanation: It is not necessary that the offender should intend to produce harm, or contemplate his
disobedience as likely to produce harm. It is sufficient that he knows of the order which he disobeys,
and that his disobedience produces, or is likely to produce, harm.
3. Lord Macaulay's Report on this provision will be of some interest before proceeding to deal with
the provision. The same is extracted hereunder.
- 34 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR Thus it may happen that a religious procession which is in itself
perfectly legal, and which, while it passes through many quarters of a town is perfectly harmless,
cannot, without great risk of tumult and outrage, be suffered to turn down a particular street
inhabited by persons, who hold the ceremony in abhorrence, and whose passions are excited by
being forced to witness it. Again, there are many Hindu rites which in Hindu temples and religious
assemblies, the law tolerates, but which could not with propriety be exhibited in a place which
English gentlemen and ladies were in the habit of frequenting, for purpose of exercise. Again, at a
particular season, hydrophobia may be common among the dogs at a particular place, and it may be
highly advisable that all the people at that place should keep their dogs strictly confined. Again,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108120667/ 17
Sri Sathish Reddy M vs State By Bommanahalli on 11 July, 2025
there may be a particular place in a town in which the people are in the habit of using as a receptacle
for filth. In general, this practice may do no harm, but an unhealthy season may arrive when it may
be dangerous to the health of the population, and under such circumstances it is evidently desirable
that no person should be allowed to add to the nuisance. It is evident, that it is utterly impossible for
the legislature to mark out the route of all the religious processions in India, to specify all the public
walks frequented by English ladies and gentlemen, to foresee in what months and in what places
hydrophobia will be
- 35 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR common among dogs,, or when a particular dunghill may become
dangerous to the health of a town. It is equally evident that it would be unjust to punish a person
who cannot be proved to have acted with bad intentions for doing today what yesterday was a
perfectly innocent act, or for doing in one street what it would be perfectly innocent to do in another
street, without giving him some notice.
What we propose, therefore, is to empower the local authorities to forbid acts which these
authorities consider dangerous to the public tranquillity, health, safety, or convenience, and to make
it an offence for a person to do anything which that person knows to be forbidden, and which may
endanger the public tranquillity, health, safety, or convenience. It will be observed that we do not
given the local authorities, the power of arbitrarily making any thing an offence. For unless, the
Court before which the person who disobeys the order is tried shall be of opinion that he has done
something tending to endanger the public tranquillity, health, safety, or convenience, he will not be
liable to punishment. The effect of the order of the local authority will be merely to deprive the
person who knowingly disobeys the order of the plea that he had no bad intentions. He will not be
permitted to allege that if he has caused harm, or risk of harm, it was without his knowledge.
- 36 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR Thus, if in a town where no order for the chaining up of dogs has
been made, A suffers his dog to run about loose, A will be liable to no punishment for any mischief
which the animal may do, unless it can be shown that A knew the animal to be dangerous. But if an
order for confining dogs has been issued, and if A knew of that order, it will be no defense for him to
allege, and even to prove, that be believed his dog to be perfectly harmless. If the Court think that
A's disobedience has caused harm, or risk of harm, A will be liable to punishment. On the other
hand if the Court think that there was no danger, and that the local order was a foolish one, A will
not be liable to punishment.?
4.When a public servant who is lawfully empowered, promulgates by an order to abstain from a
certain act, or to take certain order with certain property in his possession or under his
management, who ever disobeys such an order, the public servant can enforce his mandate or he can
make over the person who disobeyed the order, to a Criminal Court to be dealt with under the
Section.

Sri Sathish Reddy M vs State By Bommanahalli on 11 July, 2025
5. To constitute an offence under Section 188 of IPC, mere disobedience of an order is not sufficient.
The disobedience should also lead to enumerated consequences, in the second or third limb of the
Section to constitute it as an offence.
- 37 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR
6. The words ?public servant lawfully empowered to promulgate" in Section 188 IPC are significant.
A person may be legally justified, though not lawfully empowered. For instance, a Police Inspector
may stop the playing of music or speech made by some one, if he apprehends breach of peace, but he
is not ?lawfully empowered? to do so within the meaning of the Section, which is limited to
specifically authorised acts. To put it simply the essential ingredients of this offence are ;
i)Promulgation of a legal order,
ii)its communication to the accused,
iii)its disobedience by him, and
iv)the injurious consequence as described in the section.
7. Promulgation of an order would mean ?to make known by public declaration, to publish; to
disseminate or to proclaim". The normal practice that is followed in our State is, by way of a
publication in Gazette and by announcing the same in newspapers with wide circulation.
8. The next question that arises for consideration is, the manner in which the complaint can be
registered in a case involving in Section 188 of IPC and when cognizance could be taken by a
Magistrate for an offence under Section 188 of IPC. For this purpose, it will be beneficial to extract
Section 195(1)(a)(i) of Criminal Procedure Code, 1973.
- 38 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR
195. Prosecution for contempt of lawful authority of public servants, for offences against public
justice and for offences relating to documents given in evidence. (1) No Court shall take cognizance-
(a) (i) of any offence punishable under sections 172 to 188 (both inclusive) of the Indian Penal Code
(45 of 1860 ), or
(ii) ........
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108120667/ 19
Sri Sathish Reddy M vs State By Bommanahalli on 11 July, 2025
(iii) of any criminal conspiracy to commit such offence, except on the complaint in writing of the
public servant concerned or of some other public servant to whom he is administratively
subordinate;
9. A plain reading of the provision clearly brings out the procedure. A complaint in writing from the
public servant is essential for a Magistrate to take cognizance of an offence under Section 188 of IPC.
10. Mr.M.Karunanithi, learned counsel for the petitioners in some of the petitions, wherein, the
Final Report has been challenged on the ground that the Magistrate cannot take cognizance, based
on an FIR registered by the Police, and a Final Report filed after investigation under Section 173(2)
of Cr.P.C., made the following submissions.
- 39 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR Section 195(1)(a)(i) mandates the filing of a complaint in writing by
a public servant and the Police cannot register an FIR and investigate the case and thereafter file a
Final Report, in cases where the alleged offence is under Section of 188 IPC.
Section 2(d) of Cr.P.C defines a complaint as follows:
(d) Complaint? means any allegation made orally or in writing to a Magistrate, with a
view to his taking action under this Code, that some person, whether known or
unknown, has committed an offence, but does not include a police report.
Section 2(r) defines a Police Report as follows:
(r) "police report" means a report forwarded by a police officer to a Magistrate under
sub-section (2) of section 173;
11. By referring to the above two definitions, the learned counsel would submit that Cr.P.C has
consciously differentiated between a Complaint and a Police Report and he also emphasized that a
complaint does not include a Police Report, even under the very definition itself. Therefore, the
learned counsel would submit that the Final Report submitted by the Police and taken cognizance by
the concerned Magistrate, is illegal and void ab initio. The learned counsel also brought to the notice
of this Court Section 190 of Cr.P.C which is extracted here under.
- 40 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR
190. Cognizance of offences by Magistrates.
(1) Subject to the provisions of this Chapter, any Magistrate of the first class, and any Magistrate of
the second class specially empowered in this behalf under sub- section (2), may take cognizance of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108120667/ 20
Sri Sathish Reddy M vs State By Bommanahalli on 11 July, 2025
any offence-
(a) upon receiving a complaint of facts which constitute such offence;
(b) upon a police report of such facts;
(c) upon information received from any person other than a police officer, or upon his own
knowledge, that such offence has been committed.
12. By pointing out to the above provision, the learned counsel would submit that Section 195 of
Cr.P.C is an exception to Section 190 of Cr.P.C. Section 190 of Cr.P.C provides for the various modes
in which a Magistrate can take cognizance of an offence. Section 195 of Cr.P.C carves out an
exception and states that no Court shall take cognizance of certain offences, unless the stipulation
under Section 195 of Cr.P.C is satisfied. Therefore, the learned counsel would submit that the
present case is governed by Section 195 and not Section 190 of Cr.P.C.
13. .Mr.Rajesh Saravanan, learned counsel, appearing for some of the petitioners, apart from
adopting the submissions made by Mr.M.Karunanithi, also added one
- 41 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR more important submission for consideration. In cases in which he
is appearing, the cognizance taken by the learned Magistrate on a Final Report filed by the Police,
apart from being challenged for violation of Section 195(1)(a), is also challenged on the ground that
the complainant, the Investigating Officer and also the person who filed the Final Report, were all
the same and therefore, the very Final Report itself, according to the learned counsel is vitiated and
is liable to be set aside.
The learned counsel brought to the notice of this Court the following judgments, to substantiate his
arguments.
a) Daulat Ram .Vs. State of Punjab reported in AIR 1962 SC 1206.
b) Saloni Arora .Vs. State (NCT of Delhi) reported in AIR 2017 SCC 391
c) Mohan Lal .Vs. The State of Punjab in Crl.A.No.1880 of 2011 by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.

15. Mr.M.Jothi Basu, learned counsel appearing for some of the petitioners, apart from adopting the
submissions made by other counsel also brought to the notice of this Court, the scope of Section
30(2) of the Police Act. The learned counsel would submit that the promulgation that is referred to
under Section 188 IPC, is normally passed in all these cases, under Section 30(2) of the Police Act.
The learned counsel after referring to the said provision would submit that the said power is only
regulatory in nature and it is not a blanket power to trifle any democratic dissent of the citizens by
the Police. Therefore, the learned counsel would submit that the power under Section 30(2) of the
Police Act can be exercised only within the ambit of the provisions of the Constitution, which gives a
citizen, freedom of speech and expression with reasonable restrictions and the restrictions imposed
under the promulgation must satisfy the test of reasonableness. The learned counsel brought to the
notice of this Court the judgment in S.Veerakumar .Vs. Deputy Superintendent of Police, Gobi Sub

16. Per contra, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor Mr.M.Chandrasekaran made the following
submissions.
Section 188 of IPC is a cognizable offence and therefore the Police is duty bound to register an FIR
under Section 154 of Cr.P.C immediately on an information and proceed to investigate the case as
provided under Section 156 and 157 of Cr.P.C and thereafter file a Final Report under Section 173(2)
of Cr.P.C.
The learned counsel would submit that such a Police Officer is also a public servant under Section 21
of IPC and therefore he is entitled to register an FIR, investigate the case and file a Final Report and
such Final Report can be taken cognizance by the Judicial Magistrate under Section 190 of Cr.P.C.
The learned counsel made further
submission that Section 41 of Cr.P.C gives
sufficient powers to a Police Officer to even arrest a person who commits, in the presence of a Police
Officer, a congnizable offence. The learned counsel would further submit that the Police Officer, if
he is satisfied, can cause such arrest if necessary in order to prevent such a person from committing
any further offence. Therefore, the learned counsel would submit that the Police Officer cannot
remain a mute spectator, when an offence under Section

- 44 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR 188 IPC is committed, in his presence and he has to necessarily take
action, since Section of 188 of IPC is a cognizable offence.
The learned counsel would further submit that only taking cognizance of an offence under Section
188 of IPC is a bar without a complaint as contemplated under Section 195(1)(a)(i) and that does not
mean that the Police cannot register an FIR and investigate the case. The bar imposed under Section
195(1)(a)(i) cannot be expanded to such an extent.
The learned Additional Public Prosecutor further contended that, even assuming Section 195(1)(a)(i)
to be a bar for taking cognizance of an offence under Section 188 of IPC, when the case involves
other offences, the proceedings cannot be quashed insofar as the other offences are concerned.
The learned Additional Public Prosecutor relied upon the following judgments.

17. This Court has carefully considered the submissions made by the learned counsel appearing for
the respective parties.
18. This Court will deal with the various judgments cited by the Bar with respect to the scope of
Section 195(1)(a)(i) of Cr.P.C qua Section 188 of IPC. Some of the judgments are cited, and the
relevant paragraphs are extracted here under:
- 46 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR
a) In Daulat Ram .Vs. State of Punjab reported in AIR 1962 SCC 1206, the relevant
paragraphs are extracted hereunder:
3........The words of the section, namely, that the complaint has to be in writing by the
public servant concerned and that no court shall take cognizance except on such a
complaint clearly show that in every instance the court must be moved by the
appropriate public servant. We have to decide therefore whether the Tehsildar can be
said to be the public servant concerned and if he had not filed the complaint in
writing, whether the police officers in filing the charge sheet had satisfied the
requirements of s. 195. The words "no court shall take cognizance" have been
interpreted on more than one occasion and they show that there is an absolute bar
against the court taking seisin of the case except in the manner provided by the
section.
4.Now the offence under s. 182 of the Penal Code, if any, was undoubtedly complete
when the appellant had moved the Tehsildar for action.
Section 182 does not require that action must always be taken if the person who moves the public
servant knows or believes that action would be taken. In making his report to the Tehsildar
therefore, if the appellant believed that some action would be taken (and he had no reason to doubt
that it would not) the offence under that
- 47 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR section was complete. It was therefore incumbent, if the prosecution
was to be launched, that the complaint in writing should be made by the Tehsildar as the public
servant concerned in this case. On the other hand what we find is that a complaint by the Tehsildar
was not filed at all, but a charge sheet was put in by the Station House Officer. The learned counsel
for the State Government tries to support the action by submitting that s. 195 had been complied
with inasmuch as when the allegations had been disproved, the letter of the Superintendent of
Police was forwarded to the Tehsildar and he asked for "a calendar". This paper was flied along with

the charge sheet and it is stated that this satisfies the requirements of s. 195. In our opinion, this is
not a due compliance with the provisions of that section. What the section comtemplates is that the
complaint must be in writing by the public servant concerned and there is no such compliance in the
present case. The cognizance of the case was therefore wrongly assumed by the court without the
complaint in writing of the public servant namely the Tehsildar in this case. The trial was thus
without jurisdiction ab inito and the conviction cannot be maintained?.

Charges under Section 188 IPC:
- 48 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR
27. Section 195 Cr.PC reads as under :
"195. Prosecution for contempt of lawful authority of public servants, for offences
against public justice and for offences relating to documents given in evidence - (1)
No Court shall take cognizance -
(a)(i) of any offence punishable under Sections 172 to 188 (both inclusive) of the
Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), or ........
except on the complaint in writing of the public servant concerned or of some other public servant to
whom he is administratively subordinate;"
28. Section 195(a)(i) Cr.PC bars the court from taking cognizance of any offence
punishable under Section 188 IPC or abetment or attempt to commit the same,
unless, there is a written complaint by the public servant concerned for contempt of
his lawful order. The object of this provision is to provide for a particular procedure
in a case of contempt of the lawful authority of the public servant. The court lacks
competence to take cognizance in certain types of offences enumerated therein. The
legislative intent behind such a provision has been that an individual should not face
criminal prosecution instituted upon insufficient grounds by persons actuated by
malice, ill-will or frivolity of disposition and to save the time of the criminal courts
being wasted by endless prosecutions. This provision has been carved out as an
exception to the general rule contained under Section
- 49 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR 190 Cr.PC that any person can set the law in motion
by making a complaint, as it prohibits the court from taking cognizance of certain
offences until and unless a complaint has been made by some particular authority or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108120667/ 25
Sri Sathish Reddy M vs State By Bommanahalli on 11 July, 2025
person. Other provisions in the Cr.PC like sections 196 and 198 do not lay down any
rule of procedure, rather, they only create a bar that unless some requirements are
complied with, the court shall not take cognizance of an offence described in those
Sections. (vide Govind Mehta v. The State of Bihar, AIR 1971 SC 1708; Patel Laljibhai
Somabhai v. The State of Gujarat, AIR 1971 SC 1935; Surjit Singh & Ors. v. Balbir
Singh, (1996) 3 SCC 533; State of Punjab v. Raj Singh & Anr., (1998) 2 SCC 391; K.
Vengadachalam v. K.C. Palanisamy & Ors., (2005) 7 SCC 352; and Iqbal Singh
Marwah & Anr. v.
Meenakshi Marwah & Anr., AIR 2005 SC 2119).
29. The test of whether there is evasion or non- compliance of Section 195 Cr.PC or not, is whether
the facts disclose primarily and essentially an offence for which a complaint of the court or of a
public servant is required. In Basir-ul-Haq & Ors. v. The State of West Bengal, AIR 1953 SC 293;
andDurgacharan Naik & Ors v. State of Orissa, AIR 1966 SC 1775, this Court held that the provisions
of this Section cannot be evaded by describing the offence as one being punishable under some other
sections of IPC, though in truth and substance, the offence falls in a category mentioned in Section
195Cr.PC. Thus, cognizance of such an offence cannot be taken by mis- describing it or by putting a
wrong label on it.
- 50 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR
30. In M.S. Ahlawat v. State of Haryana & Anr., AIR 2000 SC 168, this Court considered the matter
at length and held as under :
"....Provisions of Section 195 CrPC are mandatory and no court has jurisdiction to
take cognizance of any of the offences mentioned therein unless there is a complaint
in writing as required under that section."
(Emphasis added)
31. In Sachida Nand Singh & Anr. v. State of Bihar & Anr., (1998) 2 SCC 493, this Court while
dealing with this issue observed as under :
"7. ..Section 190 of the Code empowers "any magistrate of the first class" to take
cognizance of "any offence" upon receiving a complaint, or police report or
information or upon his own knowledge. Section 195 restricts such general powers of
the magistrate, and the general right of a person to move the court with a complaint
to that extent curtailed. It is a well- recognised canon of interpretation that provision
curbing the general jurisdiction of the court must normally receive strict
interpretation unless the statute or the context requires otherwise."

32. In Daulat Ram v. State of Punjab, AIR 1962 SC 1206, this Court considered the nature of the
provisions of Section 195 Cr.PC. In the said case, cognizance had
- 51 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR been taken on the police report by the Magistrate and the appellant
therein had been tried and convicted, though the concerned public servant, the Tahsildar had not
filed any complaint. This Court held as under
:
"4...The cognizance of the case was therefore wrongly assumed by the court without
the complaint in writing of the public servant, namely, the Tahsildar in this case. The
trial was thus without jurisdiction ab initio and the conviction cannot be maintained.
5.The appeal is, therefore, allowed and the conviction of the appellant and the
sentence passed on him are set aside."
(Emphasis added)
33. Thus, in view of the above, the law can be summarized to the effect that there must be a
complaint by the pubic servant whose lawful order has not been complied with. The complaint must
be in writing. The provisions of Section 195Cr.PC are mandatory. Non- compliance of it would
vitiate the prosecution and all other consequential orders. The Court cannot assume the cognizance
of the case without such complaint. In the absence of such a complaint, the trial and conviction will
be void ab initio being without jurisdiction?.

6) In the aforementioned proceedings, the State Prosecuting Agency sought to prosecute the
appellant for commission of an offence punishable under Section 182 IPC. The appellant, felt
aggrieved of this action of the prosecuting agency, filed an application for her discharge on the
ground that since no procedure as contemplated under Section 195 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as ?the Code?) was followed by the prosecution, the
appellant cannot be prosecuted for such offence.
10) As rightly pointed out by the learned counsel for the parties on the strength of law laid down by
this Court in the case of Daulat Ram vs. State of Punjab, (AIR 1962 SC 1206) that in order to
prosecute an accused for an offence punishable under Section 182 IPC, it is mandatory to follow the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108120667/ 27
Sri Sathish Reddy M vs State By Bommanahalli on 11 July, 2025
procedure prescribed under Section 195 of the Code else such action is rendered void ab initio.
11) It is apposite to reproduce the law laid down by this Court in the case of Daulat Ram (supra)
which reads as under:
There is an absolute bar against the Court taking seisin of the case under S.182 I.P.C.
except in the manner provided by S.195 Crl.P.C. Section 182 does not require that
action must always be taken if the person who moves the public servant knows or
believes that action would be taken. The
- 53 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR offence under S.182 is complete when a person moves the public
servant for action. Where a person reports to a Tehsildar to take action on averment of certain facts,
believing that the Tehsildar would take some action upon it, and the facts alleged in the report are
found to be false, it is incumbent, if the prosecution is to be launched, that the complaint in writing
should be made by the Tehsildar, as the public servant concerned under S.182, and not leave it to
the police to put a charge-sheet. The complaint must be in writing by the public servant concerned.
The trial under S.182 without the Tehsildar?s complaint in writing is, therefore, without jurisdiction
ab initio.? (Emphasis supplied)
12) It is not in dispute that in this case, the prosecution while initiating the action against the
appellant did not take recourse to the procedure prescribed under Section 195 of the Code. It is for
this reason, in our considered opinion, the action taken by the prosecution against the appellant
insofar as it relates to the offence under Section 182 IPC is concerned, is rendered void ab initio
being against the law laid down in the case of Daulat Ram (supra) quoted above?.
d. Palaniswamy and Others .Vs. The Inspector of Police in Crl.O.P.No.13251 of 2009 dt.04.02.2015.
4.Heard the learned Additional Public Prosecutor appearing for the respondent and he
- 54 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR also submitted that as per Section 195 of Cr.P.C., a complaint can be
filed only by a public servant and police cannot file a charge sheet for the offence punishable under
Section 188 of I.P.C. and read with Section 195 of Cr.P.C. He further submitted that no Court shall
take cognizance as stated therein except on a complaint given by a public servant concerned.
5.Admittedly, in this case, on the basis of the complaint given police enquired, investigated and filed
charge sheet and therefore, the Court should not have taken cognizance of the charge sheet filed by
the respondent police. In the decision reported in (2004) M.L.J. (Crl) 633 (K.C.Palanisamy and
others Vs. State represented by Inspector of Police, City Crime Branch, (Coimbatore), the said law
has been discussed and held that the final report filed by the police in respect of Section 188 of I.P.C.

such offence, except on the complaint in writing of the public servant concerned or of some other

14. Though the learned counsel for the accused had failed to argue a particular legal aspect which is
favourable to him, this Court does not want to take advantage of his ignorance. A Court cannot take
cognizance of an offence under Section 188 IPC on a police report filed under Section 173(2) Cr.P.C.,
but only on the complaint by a concerned public servant in the light of Section 195 Cr.P.C. (See:
C.Muniappan and others vs. State of Tamil Nadu [(2010) 9 SCC 567]. Thus, the prosecution of the
accused under Section 188 IPC stands quashed?.
19. From the above judgments, it is clear that in order to prosecute an accused for an offence
punishable under Section 188 of IPC, it is mandatory to follow the procedure prescribed under
Section 195 of the Code, else, such action is rendered void ab initio. The object of the provision is to
provide for a particular procedure, which gives authority only to the public servant. The legislative
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108120667/ 29
Sri Sathish Reddy M vs State By Bommanahalli on 11 July, 2025
intent is to prevent an individual or a group of persons from facing criminal prosecution instituted
upon insufficient grounds by persons actuated by malice, ill will, or frivolity of disposition and to
save the time of Criminal Courts from being vexed by endless prosecution. Section 195 of Cr.P.C is
an expansion to the general rule contained under Section 190 of Cr.P.C, wherein, any person can set
the law in motion by making a complaint.
- 57 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR
20. Therefore, it is very clear from the above judgments that there must be a complaint by a public
servant, who is lawfully empowered, whose lawful order has not been complied with. The provisions
of Section 195 of Cr.P.C are mandatory and non-compliance, with it, will make the entire process
void ab initio, being without jurisdiction.
21.The submission of the learned Additional Public Prosecutor to the effect that Section 188 of IPC
is a cognizable offence, and therefore, the Police Officer is entitled to proceed under Section 154, 156
and 157 of Cr.P.C, is not sustainable. The offence being cognizable by itself, does not enable the
Police Officer to register an FIR for an offence under Section 188 of IPC. The reason being, such
registration of an FIR has to necessarily end with a Police Report under Section 173(2) of Cr.P.C,
which is specifically barred under Section 195 of Cr.P.C. The definition of a complaint under Section
2(d) of Cr.P.C itself makes it clear that a complaint does not include a Police Report. The Hon'ble
Supreme Court has gone to the extent of saying that such a Final Report, which is taken cognizance
will make the entire proceedings void ab initio which would necessarily mean that the registration of
the FIR for an offence under Section 188 of IPC will also become void.
22.There is one more analogy, which can be used here. Section 195(1)(b) of Cr.P.C prohibits any
complaint for an offence that is committed during Court proceedings. Such offence committed
during Court proceedings like
- 58 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR forgery, impersonation, perjury etc., by itself may be cognizable in
nature, but that does not empower the Police Officer to register an FIR and complaint in such cases
can be given only by the Court concerned. Therefore, the nature of the offence does not give a right
to the Police Officer to register an FIR and investigate and file a Final Report, when those offences
fall within the category enumerated under Section 195 of Cr.P.C. Therefore, the arguments of the
learned Additional Public Prosecutor in this regard is not sustainable.
23.The next argument of the learned Additional Public Prosecutor to the effect that since a Police
Officer is also a public servant under Section 21 of IPC, his Final Report filed before the Court under
Section 173(2) of Cr.P.C must be construed as a complaint under Section 195(1)(a)(i), is also not
sustainable. The word used under Section 188 of IPC is "public servant lawfully empowered" and the
word used in Section 195(1)(a)(i) is "public servant concerned". The very terminology that has been
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108120667/ 30
Sri Sathish Reddy M vs State By Bommanahalli on 11 July, 2025
used in the provision makes it clear that not all public servants falling under Section 21 of IPC can
give a complaint in writing, it is only the public servant who has been specifically authorised, by a
specific order in this regard, who can file a written complaint before the concerned Judicial
Magistrate Court.
24.It is true that a Police Officer by virtue of the power given under Section 41 of Cr.P.C., will have
the authority to arrest a person, without any warrant or order from a Magistrate, when a cognizable
offence is committed in
- 59 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR his presence or in order to prevent the committing of a cognizable
offence. This power by itself will not vest the Police Officer to register an FIR for an offence under
Section 188 of IPC. After the arrest, the concerned Police Officer is duty bound to inform the public
servant authorised about the offence committed under Section 188 of IPC and the public servant
thereafter, has to proceed in accordance with the procedure under Section 195(1)(a)(i) of Cr.P.C. In
other words, the power of the Police Officer to arrest a person committing a cognizable offence, is
only a preventive action and thereafter the procedure to be followed is guided by Section 195(1)(a)(i)
of Cr.P.C.
25.The last submission made by the learned Additional Public Prosecutor to the effect that, where
other offences are also committed along with the offence under Section 188 of IPC, the authority of
the Police Officer to register an FIR and to investigate and file a Final Report for the other offences,
is in no way affected, is perfectly correct. The judgments cited by the learned Additional Public
Prosecutor in this regard, supports the submission made by the learned Additional Public
Prosecutor and this Court is in agreement with the said submission.
26.In some of the cases, it is also seen that the same Officer has registered the FIR, conducted the
investigation and also filed the Final Report. Such a procedure goes against the very fundamental
principle of fair investigation, wherein, the informant and the investigator must not be the same
person. Such a
- 60 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR procedure, in fact is violative of Article 21 of the Constitution.
27.It will be useful to refer to the latest judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in this regard in Mohan
Lal .Vs. The State of Punjab, in Crl.A.No.1880 of 2011 dt.16.08.2018, Hon'ble Supreme Court of
India.
5. We have considered the submissions on behalf of the parties. The primary question for our
consideration in the present appeal is, whether in a criminal prosecution, it will be in consonance
with the principles of justice, fair play and a fair investigation, if the informant and the investigating
officer were to be the same person. In such a case, is it necessary for the accused to demonstrate
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108120667/ 31
Sri Sathish Reddy M vs State By Bommanahalli on 11 July, 2025
prejudice, especially under laws such as NDPS Act, carrying a reverse burden of proof.
11. A fair trial to an accused, a constitutional guarantee under Article 21 of the Constitution, would
be a hollow promise if the investigation in a NDPS case were not to be fair or raises serious
questions about its fairness apparent on the face of the investigation. In the nature of the reverse
burden of proof, the onus will lie on the prosecution to demonstrate on the face of it that the
investigation was fair, judicious with no circumstances that may raise doubts about its veracity. The
obligation of proof beyond reasonable doubt will take within its ambit a fair
- 61 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR investigation, in absence of which there can be no fair trial. If the
investigation itself is unfair, to require the accused to demonstrate prejudice will be fraught with
danger vesting arbitrary powers in the police which may well lead to false implication also.
Investigation in such a case would then become an empty formality and a farce. Such an
interpretation therefore naturally has to be avoided.
12. That investigation in a criminal offence must be free from objectionable features or infirmities
which may legitimately lead to a grievance on part of the accused was noticed in Babubhai vs. State
of Gujarat, (2010) 12 SCC 254 as follows:
32. The investigation into a criminal offence must be free from objectionable features
or infirmities which may legitimately lead to a grievance on the part of the accused
that investigation was unfair and carried out with an ulterior motive. It is also the
duty of the investigating officer to conduct the investigation avoiding any kind of
mischief and harassment to any of the accused. The investigating officer should be
fair and conscious so as to rule out any possibility of fabrication of evidence and his
impartial conduct must dispel any suspicion as to its genuineness. The investigating
officer ?is not merely to bolster up a prosecution case with such
- 62 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR evidence as may enable the court to record a conviction but to bring
out the real unvarnished truth?.
33. In State of Bihar v. P.P. Sharma this Court has held as under:
57. Investigation is a delicate painstaking and dextrous process. Ethical conduct is
absolutely essential for investigative professionalism. ?
Therefore, before countenancing such allegations of mala fides or bias it is salutary and an onerous
duty and responsibility of the court, not only to insist upon making specific and definite allegations
of personal animosity against the investigating officer at the start of the investigation but also must
insist to establish and prove them from the facts and circumstances to the satisfaction of the court.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108120667/ 32
Sri Sathish Reddy M vs State By Bommanahalli on 11 July, 2025
59. Malice in law could be inferred from doing of wrongful act intentionally without any just cause
or excuse or without there being reasonable relation to the purpose of the exercise of statutory
power. ?
61. An investigating officer who is not sensitive to the constitutional mandates, may be prone to
trample upon the personal liberty of a person when he is actuated by mala fides.?
14. In a criminal prosecution, there is an obligation cast on the investigator not only to be fair,
judicious and just during investigation, but
- 63 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR also that the investigation on the very face of it must appear to be
so, eschewing any conduct or impression which may give rise to a real and genuine apprehension in
the mind of an accused and not mere fanciful, that the investigation was not fair. In the
circumstances, if an informant police official in a criminal prosecution, especially when carrying a
reverse burden of proof, makes the allegations, is himself asked to investigate, serious doubts will
naturally arise with regard to his fairness and impartiality. It is not necessary that bias must actually
be proved. It would be illogical to presume and contrary to normal human conduct, that he would
himself at the end of the investigation submit a closure report to conclude false implication with all
its attendant consequences for the complainant himself. The result of the investigation would
therefore be a foregone conclusion.
25. In view of the conflicting opinions expressed by different two Judge Benches of this Court, the
importance of a fair investigation from the point of view of an accused as a guaranteed
constitutional right under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, it is considered necessary that the
law in this regard be laid down with certainty. To leave the matter for being determined on the
individual facts of a case, may not only lead to a possible abuse of powers, but more importantly will
leave the police, the
- 64 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR accused, the lawyer and the courts in a state of uncertainty and
confusion which has to be avoided. It is therefore held that a fair investigation, which is but the very
foundation of fair trial, necessarily postulates that the informant and the investigator must not be
the same person.
Justice must not only be done, but must appear to be done also. Any possibility of bias or a
predetermined conclusion has to be excluded. This requirement is all the more imperative in laws
carrying a reverse burden of proof.
26.Resultantly, the appeal succeeds and is allowed. The prosecution is held to be vitiated because of
the infraction of the constitutional guarantee of a fair investigation. The appellant is directed to be
set at liberty forthwith unless wanted in any other case?.

28.There are certain cases covered in this batch, which apart from the infraction of the procedural
mandate under Section 195(1)(a)(i) of Cr.P.C is also vitiated by the fact that the informant and the
investigator are the same persons and hence, hit by the latest judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court referred supra.
29.In view of the discussions, the following guidelines are issued insofar as an offence under Section
188 of IPC, is concerned:
- 65 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR
a)A Police Officer cannot register an FIR for any of the offences falling under Section
172 to 188 of IPC.
b)A Police Officer by virtue of the powers conferred under Section 41 of Cr.P.C will
have the authority to take action under Section 41 of Cr.P.C., when a cognizable
offence under Section 188 IPC is committed in his presence or where such action is
required, to prevent such person from committing an offence under Section 188 of
IPC.
c)The role of the Police Officer will be confined only to the preventive action as stipulated under
Section 41 of Cr.P.C and immediately thereafter, he has to inform about the same to the public
servant concerned/authorised, to enable such public servant to give a complaint in writing before
the jurisdictional Magistrate, who shall take cognizance of such complaint on being prima facie
satisfied with the requirements of Section 188 of IPC.
d)In order to attract the provisions of Section 188 of IPC, the written complaint of the public servant
concerned should reflect the following ingredients namely;
i) that there must be an order promulgated by the public servant;
ii) that such public servant is lawfully empowered to promulgate it;
- 66 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR
iii)that the person with knowledge of such order and being directed by such order to abstain from
doing certain act or to take certain order with certain property in his possession and under his
management, has disobeyed; and
iv)that such disobedience causes or tends to cause;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108120667/ 34
Sri Sathish Reddy M vs State By Bommanahalli on 11 July, 2025
(a) obstruction,annoyance or risk of it to any person lawfully employed; or
(b) danger to human life, health or safety; or
(c) a riot or affray.
e)The promulgation issued under Section 30(2) of the Police Act, 1861, must satisfy the test of
reasonableness and can only be in the nature of a regulatory power and not a blanket power to trifle
any democratic dissent of the citizens by the Police.
f)The promulgation through which, the order is made known must be by something done openly
and in public and private information will not be a promulgation. The order must be notified or
published by beat of drum or in a Gazette or published in a newspaper with a wide circulation.
g)No Judicial Magistrate should take cognizance of a Final Report when it reflects an offence under
- 67 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR Section 172 to 188 of IPC. An FIR or a Final Report will not become
void ab initio insofar as offences other than Section 172 to 188 of IPC and a Final Report can be
taken cognizance by the Magistrate insofar as offences not covered under Section 195(1)(a)(i) of
Cr.P.C.
h)The Director General of Police, Chennai and Inspector General of the various Zones are directed
to immediately formulate a process by specifically empowering public servants dealing with for an
offence under Section 188 of IPC to ensure that there is no delay in filing a written complaint by the

31. In all these cases, it is seen that a Final Report has been filed for an Offence under Section 188
and 143 of IPC and cognizance has also been taken by the concerned Judicial Magistrates. In view of
the above discussion, the cognizance of the Final Report under Section 188 of IPC is liable to be
quashed. Insofar as the offence under Section 143 of IPC is concerned, in all the cases, the
concerned Police Officer has quoted Section 30(2) of the Police Act, and therefore, has
- 68 -

IPC. As stated above, a mere violation of the so-called promulgation under Section 30(2) of the
Police Act will not make out an offence under Section 143 of IPC by straight away declaring an
assembly of persons to be an unlawful assembly. The power under Section 30(2) of the Police Act is
merely regulatory in nature. In fact, Section 32 of the Police Act itself provides for a penalty for

disobeying an order issued under Section 30(2) of the Police Act with a punishment of a fine not
exceeding 200 rupees. Where as an offence under Section 143 of IPC is punishable with
imprisonment for a term which may extend to 6 months. Therefore, a violation of the so-called
promulgation under Section 30(2) of the Police Act will not by itself constitute an offence under
Section 143 of IPC. In all the cases, the assembly of persons were made to express dissatisfaction of
the governance and claiming for minimum rights that are guaranteed to a ordinary citizen. If such
an assembly of persons are to be trifled by registering an FIR under Section 143 of IPC and filing a
Final Report for the very same offence, no democratic dissent can ever be shown by the citizens and
such prohibition will amount to violation of fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution.
32.Therefore, the Final Report for an offence under Section 143 of IPC is hereby quashed.
Accordingly, all the Criminal Original petitions are allowed, and the Final Report filed in each of the

37.In this case, an FIR has been registered by the respondent Police for an offence under Section
188 of IPC and Section 4(1) of the Tamil Nadu Open Places [Prevention of Disfigurement] Act, 1959.
The respondent Police do not have the authority to register an FIR for an offence under Section 188
of IPC. Therefore, the FIR has to be necessarily quashed insofar as offence under Section 188 of IPC
is concerned. Insofar as 4(1) of the Tamil Nadu Open Places [Prevention of Disfigurement] Act, 1959
is concerned, the FIR is registered on the ground that the portrait of Swami Vivekananda was placed
without permission. This offence is punishable with 3 months imprisonment and therefore, is a non
cognizable offence. The respondent Police cannot register an FIR, without getting a specific order
from the Magistrate under Section 155 of Cr.P.C. Therefore, the FIR is not sustainable. Accordingly,
the FIR in Cr.No.4 of 2018 is hereby quashed and Crl.O.P.No.14846 of 2018 is allowed.

IPC. An FIR cannot be registered for an offence under Section 188 of IPC. The complaint does not
even state as to how the assembly formed by the persons is a unlawful assembly and does not satisfy
the requirements of Section 143 of IPC. There is also no mention about any promulgation order
passed under Section 30(2) of the Police Act, 1861. There are absolutely no averments in order to
attract the offence under Section 336 of IPC.
39. There is no allegation that the accused persons engaged in an act so as to endanger human life or
the personal safety of others. The complaint only says that the accused persons endangered their
own lives by trying to get into the sea. Therefore, the FIR insofar as the offence under Section 336 is
concerned is also hereby quashed. Accordingly, the FIR in Crime No.112/18 is hereby quashed and
Criminal Original Petition is allowed.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108120667/ 38
Sri Sathish Reddy M vs State By Bommanahalli on 11 July, 2025
ought not to have been taken cognizance. In view of the above discussion, the Final Report insofar
as an offence under Section 188 IPC is concerned is hereby quashed. Insofar as the offence under
Section 143 IPC is concerned, the allegation is that the assembly had raised slogans demanding for
the rights of the farmers, and expressed opposition not to establish a godown and this according to
the Police was done, when there was a prohibitory order under Section 30(2) of the Police Act, 1861.
In the considered view of this Court, this will not constitute an offence under Section 143 of IPC.
42.In all the cases, the assembly of persons were expressing dissatisfaction on the governance and
claiming for minimum rights that are guaranteed to an ordinary citizen. If such an assembly of
persons are to be trifled by registering an FIR under Section 143 of IPC and filing a Final Report for
the very same offence, no democratic dissent can ever be shown by the citizens and such prohibition
will amount to violation of fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution.
- 75 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR A reading of the Final Report also does not make out an offence
under Section 341 of Cr.P.C since any form of an agitation, will necessarily cause some hindrance to
the movement of the general public for sometime. That by itself, does not constitute an offence of a
wrongful restraint.
43.In the considered view of this Court, the Final Report does not make out an offence of unlawful
assembly or wrongful restraint. Accordingly, all the Criminal Original petitions are allowed, and the
Final Report filed in each of the case is hereby quashed.
44.Consequently, connected Miscellaneous Petitions are closed.
45. This Court records its appreciation for the effective assistance given by the learned counsel
appearing on behalf of the petitioners and also the learned Additional Public Prosecutor appearing
for the State, to enable this Court to deal with an offence under Section 188 of IPC and give
necessary guidelines with regard to the procedure to be followed.

Sri Sathish Reddy M vs State By Bommanahalli on 11 July, 2025
3. The learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that the issue in the case at
hand stands covered by the judgment rendered by this Court in
Crl.P.No.10044/2022, disposed of on 11.08.2023, wherein this Court has held as
follows:
" 3. The facts, in brief, are as follows:-
respectively. A complaint comes to be registered on 05-12-2019, alleging that at about
11.30 a.m., when the complainant was on election duty, accused No.2 and his
associates formed an unlawful assembly and when he tried to disperse them,
altercations broke out between accused No.2 and the Police. At that point in time,
accused No.1 is alleged to have raised his voice and questioned the complainant as to
how he can arrest him, thereby, obstructing the complainant in the discharge of his
duties. This is the crux of the complaint that is made against all the accused. Based
upon the said complaint, a crime comes to be registered in Crime No.271 of 2019
before Bilikere Police Station against accused Nos.1 and 2 primarily and 15 to 20
others named as accused for the offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 353
and 149 of the IPC. The police conduct investigation and lay a charge sheet against 9
- 77 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR persons on 05-10-2021 for the offences under
Sections 143, 147, 188, 353 and 149 of the IPC. The petitioners are accused Nos.3 to 9.
The learned Magistrate takes cognizance of the offences on 16.06.2022. It is taking of
cognizance that has driven the petitioners to this Court in the subject petition.
4. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioners Ms. Keerthana Nagaraj would
vehemently contend that the very registration of the crime or taking of cognizance by
the learned Magistrate for offence under Section 188 of the IPC is contrary to law. It
is her submission that in order to prosecute an accused for an offence under Section
188 of the IPC, the procedure prescribed under Section 195 of the Cr.P.C. is to be
followed mandatorily. That having not been done, the very act of taking cognizance
would get vitiated. She would further contend that Section 188 of the IPC mandates
that the complaint should be registered by the public servant lawfully empowered. It
is an admitted fact that the complainant is not the authorized officer to register the
complaint. She would contend that there is no specific overt act against the
petitioners, in particular, to drive them into the web of crime.
5. Per contra, the learned Additional State Public Prosecutor would refute the
submissions to contend that the Police have filed the charge sheet and the matter is
set for further proceedings. The petitioners can as well seek discharge before the
concerned Court and therefore, interference under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. is
unwarranted. He would seek dismissal of the petition.

learned counsel and have perused the material on record.

7. The afore-narrated facts are not in dispute. The Police Officer i.e., the 2nd
respondent is the complainant. The allegation against the petitioners on the incident,
is as narrated hereinabove, which does not require reiteration. The crime is
registered in Crime No.271 of 2019 for offences punishable under Sections 143, 147,
353 and 149 of the IPC. There was no offence registered under Section 188 of the IPC
laid at the time of registration of crime. The Police file a charge sheet after
investigation, after 22 months i.e., on 05.10.2021. Here the offence under Section 188
of the IPC is added. Whether Section 188 of the IPC can become an offence without it
being registered by an authorized officer as that creates a bar under Section 195 of the
Cr.P.C. is what is required to be considered. The consideration of which, need not
detain this Court for long or delve deep into the matter. This Court in SHASHIKALA
K.S. V. STATE OF KARNATAKA in Criminal Petition No.6812 of 2023 decided on
08.09.2023, has held as follows:
".... .... ....
2. The petitioner is before this Court calling in question the proceedings in C.C.
No.7453/2013 registered by Subramanyanagar Police Station, Bengaluru City in
Crime No.100/2013, dated 22.04.2013 for the offences punishable under Sections
171B, 171E & 188 read with Section 34 of the IPC.
3. Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner would submit that qua the other
accused, this Court has already quashed the proceedings arising out of the very same
crime. This Court in the case of Dr. C.N. Ashwathnarayan S/o. T.K. Narayanappa Vs.
the State of Karnataka and another in Crl.P. No.9407/2017, disposed off on 24th
April 2018, wherein it is held as under:
"Petitioner is seeking for quashing of the proceedings in C.C.No.7453/2013 pending
on the file of VII Addl. Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Bangalore, registered for the
offence punishable under Sections 171(B), 171(E) and 188 r/w Section 34 of IPC on
the basis of complaint lodged by second respondent herein. 2. The gist of prosecution
case is; second respondent was on election duty in
- 79 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR Malleshwaram Constituency No.157 as MCC Flying
Squad-Executive Magistrate and while discharging his duties on 21.04.2014, he
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108120667/ 41
Sri Sathish Reddy M vs State By Bommanahalli on 11 July, 2025
received information that accused No.1, who is a yoga guru, had arranged a meeting
at Kranthiveera Sangollirayann Park falling within the jurisdiction of Subramanya
Nagar Police Station and a meeting was being held under the leadership of said yoga
guru and in that meeting, petitioner, who was a candidate at Malleshwaram Vidhana
Sabha Constituency along with local CorporatorSmt.Shashikala Krishnegowda was
participating in the said meeting held by yoga guru Sri.Subhash and after the
meeting, breakfast had been arranged without obtaining permission from the
Election Officer and on reaching the venue, he found such meeting being held.
Hence, alleging that accused had violated election rules, a complaint came to be
lodged, which was registered in Cr.No.100/2013 and after completion of
investigation, charge sheet came to be filed against petitioner for the offences
punishable under Sections 171(B), 171(E) and 188 r/w Section 34 of IPC. Hence,
petitioner is before this Court calling in question the registration of same and praying
for quashing of said proceedings. 3. Heard Sri.Shanthi Bhushan.H, learned counsel
appearing for petitioner and Sri.Rachaiah, learned HCGP appearing for first
respondent - State. Perused the records. 4. As could be seen from the case records,
offences alleged against petitioner are punishable under Sections 171(B) and 171(E),
which are cognizable offences and as such, prior to registration of FIR, jurisdictional
police ought to have obtained permission from the jurisdictional magistrate, which is
conspicuously absent in the instant case. Insofar as, offences punishable under
Section 188 of IPC, the bar contained in Section 195 of Cr.P.C. would come into play
namely, prosecution can be initiated for said offence only by a competent officer by
filing a complaint before the Court as otherwise the Court before whom proceedings
is continued on the basis of police report, would not be empowered to take
cognizance of said offence.
5. In the instant case, prosecution has been initiated for the offence committed under
Section 188 of IPC on the basis of a police
- 80 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR report and not on the basis of complaint lodged in
writing by the competent officer, who is empowered to do so. In that view of the
matter, proceedings initiated against petitioner if allowed to be continued and is
directed to undergo the ordeal of trial, it would be an abuse of process of law."
4. Insofar as the other accused is concerned, the Co-ordinate Bench of this Court has quashed the
proceedings in the case of Subhash Vs. the State of Karanataka and another in Crl.P. No.9234/2017,
disposed off on 22nd June 2018, wherein it is held as under:
"2. Petitioner is arrayed as accused no.2 in C.C.No.7453/2013 pending on the file of
VII Addl. CMM Court, Bangalore registered for the offences punishable under
Sections 171(B), 171(E), 188 read with Section 34 IPC on the basis of the final report
submitted by the 2nd respondent under Section 173 Cr.P.C. 3. This Court had an
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108120667/ 42
Sri Sathish Reddy M vs State By Bommanahalli on 11 July, 2025
occasion to deal with the same matter so far as accused no.1 is concerned. Ultimately,
after a reasoned order, this Court has quashed the proceedings against accused no.1.
The same has to be made applicable so far as this petitioner is concerned. 4. This
Court has categorically observed that under Sections 171B and 171E they are
non-cognizable offences and so far as offence under Section 188 IPC the Police have
no jurisdiction to investigate in view of the bar contained in Section 195 Cr.P.C.
Therefore, considering the said legal lacunae in the case, the Court has quashed the
proceedings against accused no.1. Under the above said circumstances, the same
order holds good so far as the petitioner is concerned."
5. In the light of the aforesaid orders answering the issue that is called in question in the case at
hand, the further consideration or deeper dwelling in the matter would become unnecessary."
It is also germane to notice the judgment of the High Court of Madras in the case of
JEEVANANDHAM v.
- 81 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR STATE reported in 2018 SCC OnLine Mad 13698, wherein it is held
as follows:-
"19. From the above judgments, it is clear that in order to prosecute an accused for an
offence punishable under Section 188 of IPC, it is mandatory to follow the procedure
prescribed under Section 195 of the Code, else, such action is rendered void ab initio.
The object of the provision is to provide for a particular procedure, which gives
authority only to the public servant. The legislative intent is to prevent an individual
or a group of persons from facing criminal prosecution instituted upon insufficient
grounds by persons actuated by malice, ill will, or frivolity of disposition and to save
the time of Criminal Courts from being vexed by endless prosecution. Section 195 of
Cr.P.C. is an expansion to the general rule contained under Section 190 of Cr.P.C,
wherein, any person can set the law in motion by making a complaint.
20. Therefore, it is very clear from the above judgments that there must be a
complaint by a public servant, who is lawfully empowered, whose lawful order has
not been complied with. The provisions of Section 195 of Cr.P.C. are mandatory and
non- compliance, with it, will make the entire process void ab initio, being without
jurisdiction.
21. The submission of the learned Additional Public Prosecutor to the effect that
Section 188 of IPC is a cognizable offence, and therefore, the Police Officer is entitled
to proceed under Section 154, 156 and 157 of Cr.P.C, is not sustainable. The offence
being cognizable by itself, does not enable the Police Officer to register an FIR for an
offence under Section 188 of IPC. The reason being, such registration of an FIR has to
necessarily end with a Police Report under Section 173(2) of Cr.P.C, which is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/108120667/ 43
Sri Sathish Reddy M vs State By Bommanahalli on 11 July, 2025
specifically barred under Section 195 of Cr.P.C. The definition of a complaint under
Section 2(d) of Cr.P.C. itself makes it clear that a complaint does not include a Police
Report. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has gone to the extent of saying that such a Final
Report, which is taken cognizance will make the entire proceedings void ab initio
which would necessarily mean that the registration of the FIR for an offence under
Section 188 of IPC will also become void.
- 82 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR
22. There is one more analogy, which can be used here. Section 195(1)(b) of Cr.P.C.
prohibits any complaint for an offence that is committed during Court proceedings.
Such offence committed during Court proceedings like forgery, impersonation,
perjury etc., by itself may be cognizable in nature, but that does not empower the
Police Officer to register an FIR and complaint in such cases can be given only by the
Court concerned. Therefore, the nature of the offence does not give a right to the
Police Officer to register an FIR and investigate and file a Final Report, when those
offences fall within the category enumerated under Section 195 of Cr.P.C. Therefore,
the arguments of the learned Additional Public Prosecutor in this regard is not
sustainable.
23. The next argument of the learned Additional Public Prosecutor to the effect that
since a Police Officer is also a public servant under Section 21 of IPC, his Final Report
filed before the Court under Section 173(2) of Cr.P.C. must be construed as a
complaint under Section 195(1)(a)(i), is also not sustainable. The word used under
Section 188 of IPC is "public servant lawfully empowered" and the word used in
Section 195(l)(a)(i) is "public servant concerned". The very terminology that has been
used in the provision makes it clear that not all public servants falling under Section
21 of IPC can give a complaint in writing, it is only the public servant who has been
specifically authorised, by a specific order in this regard, who can file a written
complaint before the concerned Judicial Magistrate Court.
24. It is true that a Police Officer by virtue of the power given under Section 41 of
Cr.P.C, will have the authority to arrest a person, without any warrant or order from a
Magistrate, when a cognizable offence is committed in his presence or in order to
prevent the committing of a cognizable offence. This power by itself will not vest the
Police Officer to register an FIR for an offence under Section 188 of IPC. After the
arrest, the concerned Police Officer is duty bound to inform the public servant
authorised about the offence committed under Section 188 of IPC and the public
servant thereafter, has to proceed in accordance with the procedure under Section
195(l)(a)(i) of Cr.P.C. In other words, the power of the Police Officer to arrest a
person committing a cognizable offence, is only a preventive action and thereafter the
procedure to be followed is guided by Section 195(l)(a)(i) of Cr.P.C.

29. In view of the discussions, the following guidelines are issued insofar as an
offence under Section 188 of IPC, is concerned:
a) A Police Officer cannot register an FIR for any of the offences falling under Section
172 to 188 of IPC.
b) A Police Officer by virtue of the powers conferred under Section 41 of Cr.P.C. will
have the authority to take action under Section 41 of Cr.P.C, when a cognizable
offence under Section 188 IPC is committed in his presence or where such action is
required, to prevent such person from committing an offence under Section 188 of
IPC.
c) The role of the Police Officer will be confined only to the preventive action as stipulated under
Section 41 of Cr.P.C. and immediately thereafter, he has to inform about the same to the public
servant concerned/authorised, to enable such public servant to give a complaint in writing before
the jurisdictional Magistrate, who shall take cognizance of such complaint on being prima facie
satisfied with the requirements of Section 188 of IPC.
d) In order to attract the provisions of Section 188 of IPC, the written complaint of the public
servant concerned should reflect the following ingredients namely;
i) that there must be an order promulgated by the public servant;
ii) that such public servant is lawfully empowered to promulgate it;
iii) that the person with knowledge of such order and being directed by such order to abstain from
doing certain act or to take certain order with certain property in his possession and under his
management, has disobeyed; and
iv) that such disobedience causes or tends to cause;

(a) obstruction, annoyance or risk of
it to any person lawfully
employed; or
(b) danger to human life, health or
safety; or
(c) a riot or affray.
e) The promulgation issued under Section 30(2) of
the Police Act, 1861, must satisfy the test of reasonableness and can only be in the nature of a
regulatory power and not a blanket power to trifle any democratic dissent of the citizens by the
Police.
f) The promulgation through which, the order is made known must be by something done openly
and in public and private information will not be a promulgation. The order must be notified or
published by beat of drum or in a Gazette or published in a newspaper with a wide circulation.
g) No Judicial Magistrate should take cognizance of a Final Report when it reflects an offence under
Section 172 to 188 of IPC. An FIR or a Final Report will not become void ab initio insofar as offences
other than Section 172 to 188 of IPC and a Final Report can be taken cognizance by the Magistrate
insofar as offences not covered under Section 195(l)(a)(i) of Cr.P.C.
h) The Director General of Police, Chennai and Inspector General of the various Zones are directed
to immediately formulate a process by specifically empowering public servants dealing with for an
offence under Section 188 of IPC to ensure that there is no delay in filing a written complaint by the
public servants concerned under Section 195(1)(a)(i) of Cr.P.C."
The High Court of Madras has clearly laid down the guidelines when offence under Section 188 of
the IPC is to be alleged. Therefore, the very act of bringing the act as an offence punishable under
Section 188 of the IPC in the teeth of the bar under Section 195 of the Cr.P.C. would vitiate the entire
proceedings. If further
- 85 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR proceedings are permitted to continue in the teeth of the aforesaid
facts, where no overt act is even alleged against the petitioners, even in the charge sheet, it would
run foul of the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of STATE OF HARYANA v. BHAJAN LAL
reported in 1992 Supp (1) SCC 335, wherein it is held as follows:

Sri Sathish Reddy M vs State By Bommanahalli on 11 July, 2025
"102. In the backdrop of the interpretation of the various relevant provisions of the
Code under Chapter XIV and of the principles of law enunciated by this Court in a
series of decisions relating to the exercise of the extraordinary power under Article
226 or the inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code which we have extracted
and reproduced above, we give the following categories of cases by way of illustration
wherein such power could be exercised either to prevent abuse of the process of any
court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice, though it may not be possible to lay
down any precise, clearly defined and sufficiently channelised and inflexible
guidelines or rigid formulae and to give an exhaustive list of myriad kinds of cases
wherein such power should be exercised.
(1) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the complaint, even
if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie
constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused.
(2) Where the allegations in the first information report and other materials, if any,
accompanying the FIR do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an
investigation by police officers under Section 156(1) of the Code except under an
order of a Magistrate within the purview of Section 155(2) of the Code.
(3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or complaint and the
evidence collected in support of the same do not disclose the commission of any
offence and make out a case against the accused.
(4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable offence but
constitute only a non-cognizable offence, no investigation is permitted by a police
officer without an order
- 86 -
NC: 2025:KHC:25485 HC-KAR of a Magistrate as contemplated under Section 155(2) of the Code.
(5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently improbable on
the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground
for proceeding against the accused.
(6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of the Code or the
concerned Act (under which a criminal proceeding is instituted) to the institution and continuance
of the proceedings and/or where there is a specific provision in the Code or the concerned Act,
providing efficacious redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party.
(7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and/or where the proceeding
is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a
view to spite him due to private and personal grudge."

under Section 188 read with Section 195 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, the impugned FIR
qua the petitioner in relation to the offences punishable under Section 188 deserves to be quashed.

recorded herein before, the other offences referred to supra are not attracted to the facts of the
instant case, the question of continuing the
