4. It is submitted by learned counsel for the applicants that applicants are innocent and have been
falsely implicated in the present case due to ulterior motive. On perusal of F.I.R. and statement of
victim recorded under sections 161 Cr.P.C. and 164 Cr.P.C., no offence under the alleged sections is
made out. The whole prosecution story is false and malicious. It is next submitted that the
applicants' case is squarely covered under Section 482 B.N.S.S. It is submitted that the applicant is
apprehensive of imminent arrest. In case, the applicant is released on bail, he would not misuse the
liberty of bail and would cooperate with the investigation.
5. Learned A.G.A. vehemently opposed the prayer for bail and submitted that prima facie offence
against the applicant is made out. The applicants are named in the F.IR. The applicants are not
entitled for any indulgence by this Court. Hence, the anticipatory bail application of the applicants
may be rejected.
6. In Satpal Singh vs. State of Punjab (2018) 13 SCC 813, the Supreme Court has held that the
satisfaction of the court for granting protection under Section 438 Cr.P.C. is different from the one
under Section 439 Cr.P.C. while considering regular bail. In Pratibha Manchanda and another Vs.
State of Haryana and another (2023) 8 SCC 181, the Apex Court has opined that the relief of
anticipatory bail is aimed at safeguarding individual rights. While it serves as a crucial tool to
prevent the misuse of the power of arrest and protects innocent individuals from harassment, it also
presents challenges in maintaining a delicate balance between individual rights and the interests of
justice. The tight rope we must walk lies in striking a balance between safeguarding individual rights
and protecting public interest.
7. Considered the argument raised by counsel for the applicants and perused the record. Without
expressing any opinion on merits of the case and considering the submissions advanced, the nature
and gravity of the accusation, I find no good ground for granting anticipatory bail to the applicant in
the aforesaid case.
8. The present anticipatory bail application is hereby found devoid of merits and is accordingly
rejected.
9. However, if the applicants surrender before the concerned court within two weeks from today and
apply for regular bail, the bail application shall be decided expeditiously by the court concerned, in
accordance with law laid down by the Apex Court in Satender Kumar Antil Vs. Central Bureau of
Investigation and another, reported in 2021 SCC OnLine SC 922.
10. For the period of two weeks from today or till the time of surrender of the applicants before the
Court below, whichever is earlier, no coercive action shall be taken against them.
