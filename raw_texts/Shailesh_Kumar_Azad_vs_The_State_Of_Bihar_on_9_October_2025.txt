Shailesh Kumar @ Azad vs The State Of Bihar on 9 October, 2025
Heard learned counsels for the Parties.
Patna High Court L.P.A No.167 of 2024 dt.09-10-2025
2/17
2. The Present Writ petition has been filed for the
following reliefs:
"(i) For quashing of the order dated
10.06.2022
passed in Senior Citizen (Misc.) Appeal No. 01/2020-21 by the Collector-cum-
District Magistrate, Patna whereby and whereunder the learned Collector set aside the order of
Chairman cum Sub Divisional Officer, Patna Sadar, Patna.
(ii) For issuance of direction in the nature of mandamus upon the respondents authority to not
disturb the family of the petitioners as the petitioners are living along with their family members.
(iii) For issuance of direction as your lordship may deem fit in the facts and circumstances of the
case of the petitioners."
3. Learned counsel for the appellants, while assailing the impugned judgment of the learned Single
Judge (Annexure-7 to the LPA appeal), submitted that the very initiation of proceedings under the
Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007 was without jurisdiction,
inasmuch as the appellants are not "children" within the meaning of Section 4 of the Act, but
nephews of the complainant senior citizen. It was urged that the property in dispute constitutes a
joint family property, and issues of ownership, partition, and entitlement are already subjudice
before the competent Civil Court (Annexure-2). Despite this, the Maintenance Tribunal, in a
summary proceeding Patna High Court L.P.A No.167 of 2024 dt.09-10-2025 under Section 23,
assumed to decide complex questions of title and possession, which lie outside its limited statutory
domain. The appellants defence and supporting documents, including the written reply (Annexure-6
to the writ petition; Annexure-SA/1 to the supplementary affidavit), the registered family settlement
deed (Annexure-8 to the writ petition), and the revenue receipts establishing possession
(Annexure-9 to the writ petition), were disregarded, and the appellants were erroneously treated as
mere licensees or permissive occupiers.
It was further submitted that the interlocutory applications filed during pendency (Annexure-IA/1
and Annexure-IA/2 to the LPA appeal) demonstrate the continuing prejudice suffered by the
appellants due to the impugned orders. It was further contended that eviction or dispossession
under Section 23 cannot be ordered mechanically, and the Tribunal is bound to act fairly and in
consonance with statutory limitations. On these premises, it was urged that the orders of the
Tribunal (Annexure-4 to the writ petition; Annexure-2 to the LPA appeal), affirmed by the learned

Single Judge, are vitiated by jurisdictional error, disregard of material evidence, and misapplication
of the Act, and therefore warrant interference in this LPA appeal. Patna High Court L.P.A No.167 of
2024 dt.09-10-2025
4. Per Contra, learned counsel appearing for the respondents submitted that the proceedings before
the Maintenance Tribunal were fully within jurisdiction and in strict consonance with the
Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007. It was argued that the
appellants are in permissive occupation of the property, without any vestige of independent title,
and cannot resist the lawful claim of the senior citizen. The Tribunal, by its order dated [dated
20.7.2022 from Annexure-4 WP / Annexure-2 LPA] (Annexure-4 to the writ petition; Annexure-2 to
the LPA appeal), after due notice and hearing, recorded categorical findings that the senior citizen
was entitled to recover possession and rent. It was further submitted that the so-called family
settlement deed (Annexure-8 to the writ petition) and revenue receipts (Annexure-9 to the writ
petition) carry no legal sanctity and were rightly disregarded. The subsequent affidavit and revenue
entries, even if considered, do not confer any title, as eligibility and rights must be determined on
the basis of settled ownership, not unilateral claims.
ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION
1. Whether the learned Single Judge, in affirming the order of the Maintenance Tribunal dated
14.03.2020 and the Collector-cum-District Magistrate dated 10.06.2022, erred in law Patna High
Court L.P.A No.167 of 2024 dt.09-10-2025 on the ground of alleged violation of the principles of
natural justice?
2. Whether the Maintenance Tribunal, while exercising jurisdiction under Section 23 of the
Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, acted within the statutory limits
in directing eviction of the appellants from the property in question?
3. Whether the appellants' asserted independent rights based on family arrangement, partition
claims and revenue records can be adjudicated within the summary jurisdiction under "the 2007
Act" ?
4. Whether, in the facts and circumstances of the case, the beneficial object and mandate of "the
2007 Act" require sustaining the Tribunal's order as affirmed by the learned Single Judge?
FINDINGS ISSUE NO. 1: Whether the learned Single Judge, in affirming the order of the
Maintenance Tribunal dated 14.03.2020 and the Collector-cum-District Magistrate dated
10.06.2022, erred in law on the ground of alleged violation of the principles of natural justice?
Patna High Court L.P.A No.167 of 2024 dt.09-10-2025 The appellants have urged that the
proceedings before the Maintenance Tribunal (Annexure-4 to the writ petition) were conducted in
breach of the principles of natural justice. It is contended that the Tribunal did not grant them
sufficient opportunity to place their defence, that their written submissions (Annexure-6 to the writ
petition; Annexure-SA/1 to the supplementary affidavit) and supporting documents such as revenue
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/181876847/ 3
Shailesh Kumar @ Azad vs The State Of Bihar on 9 October, 2025
receipts and family arrangement were brushed aside, and that the Tribunal's order dated
14.03.2020 proceeded in undue haste. It is further argued that the learned Single Judge, while
dismissing CWJC No. 10426 of 2022 on 29.01.2024 (Annexure-7 to the LPA appeal), failed to
appreciate such infirmities.
On the other hand, the record reveals that notices were duly served upon the appellants; they
entered appearance, participated in the proceedings, and filed written replies together with
annexures in support of their stand. The Maintenance Tribunal considered those submissions before
passing a reasoned order of eviction on 14.03.2020. The Collector-cum-District Magistrate, Patna,
upon hearing both sides, affirmed the same by order dated 10.06.2022 in Senior Citizen Appeal No.
01/2020-21 (Annexure-2 to the LPA). Thereafter, the learned Single Judge, by Patna High Court
L.P.A No.167 of 2024 dt.09-10-2025 judgment dated 29.01.2024, independently examined the
matter and dismissed the writ petition.
It is well settled that the essence of natural justice is fairness in action, not a ritualistic adherence to
technicalities. The Supreme Court in Union of India v. W.N. Chadha, 1993 Supp (4) SCC 260,
observed that "the principles of natural justice cannot be put in a straitjacket formula; their
applicability depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case, and once a fair opportunity is
afforded, the complaint of violation cannot be entertained."
Similarly, in Dharampal Satyapal Ltd. v. Dy.
Commissioner of Central Excise, (2015) 8 SCC 519, the Court reiterated that natural justice is not an
"unruly horse" but a principle to ensure that no one is condemned unheard, and that what is
required is "substantial fairness of procedure." Where participation has been afforded and
considered, the plea of denial fails.
Applying the above principles to the present case, it is evident that the appellants were heard at
every stage. Their plea of denial of opportunity is belied by their own participation and submission
of documents before both the Tribunal and the Appellate Authority. The learned Single Judge
rightly recorded Patna High Court L.P.A No.167 of 2024 dt.09-10-2025 that the appellants sought to
expand the limited scope of jurisdiction under "the 2007 Act" into a forum for deciding title and
partition disputes, which is impermissible.
Accordingly, we hold that no violation of principles of natural justice is made out.
ISSUE NO. 2: Whether the Maintenance Tribunal, while exercising jurisdiction under Section 23 of
the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, acted within the statutory
limits in directing eviction of the appellants from the property in question?
The order of the Maintenance Tribunal dated 05.05.2023 (Annexure-4 to the writ petition;
Annexure-2 to the LPA), directing eviction of the appellants from the scheduled premises, was
affirmed by the Appellate Authority on 10.06.2022 and by the learned Single Judge by judgment
dated 21.11.2023 (Annexure-7 to the LPA). The appellants contend that the Tribunal travelled
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/181876847/ 4
Shailesh Kumar @ Azad vs The State Of Bihar on 9 October, 2025
beyond the statutory limits of Section 23 of "the 2007 Act" by venturing into questions of ownership,
partition, and title, which are matters pending adjudication before the competent Civil Court. It was
urged that Section 23 only permits the Tribunal to annul transfers made subject to a condition of
maintenance, and does not extend to ordering eviction or dispossession. Patna High Court L.P.A
No.167 of 2024 dt.09-10-2025 Per contra, learned counsel appearing for the respondent senior
citizen submitted that "the 2007 Act" is a beneficial legislation and the Tribunal, being a statutory
forum, is empowered to pass all consequential directions necessary to secure the residence, dignity,
and peaceful possession of senior citizens. It was contended that the appellants, being nephews and
not "children" within the meaning of Section 4, lack locus to resist the proceedings. Their claim of
joint ownership, if any, is a matter for the civil court, but cannot dilute the protective jurisdiction of
the Tribunal. Reliance was placed on the Collector-cum-District Magistrate's order dated
10.06.2022 affirming the Tribunal, and the learned Single Judge's judgment dated 21.11.2023,
upholding the same (Annexure-7 to the LPA).
On consideration, we are unable to accept the appellants plea of jurisdictional excess. Section 23(1)
of "the 2007 Act"
provides that where a senior citizen transfers property subject to the condition of
maintenance, such transfer shall be deemed void if the transferee fails to provide the
same. The Supreme Court in Samtola Devi vs State of Uttar Pradesh SLP No. 26651 of
2023, para 31and para 32 states that:
"31. The provisions of the Senior Citizens Act, nowhere specifically provides for
drawing proceedings for eviction of persons from any premises owned or belonging
to such Patna High Court L.P.A No.167 of 2024 dt.09-10-2025 a senior person. It is
only on account of the observations made by this Court in S. Vanitha
vs.Commissioner, Bengaluru Urban District & Ors that the Tribunal under the Senior
Citizens Act may also order eviction if it is necessary and expedient to ensure the
protection of the senior citizens. The Tribunal thus had acquired jurisdiction to pass
orders of eviction while exercising jurisdiction under Section 23 of the Senior Citizen
Act which otherwise provide for treating the sale of the property to be void if it is
against the interest of the senior citizen.
32.The aforesaid decision was followed by this Court in Urmila Dixit (supra).
However, even in the aforesaid case the court has only held that in a given case, the
Tribunal ''may order'' eviction but it is not necessary and mandatory to pass an order
of eviction in every case. The Appellate Tribunal has not recorded any reason
necessitating the eviction of Krishna Kumar or that in the facts and circumstances of
the case, it is expedient to order eviction so as to ensure the protection of the senior
citizen."
In its Judgment dated 02.01.2025 passed in Urmila Dixit Case-Civil Appeal No.10927 of 2024, the
Supreme Court held that Tribunals under "the 2007 Act" are competent to direct eviction as an
incident of enforcing statutory protection.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/181876847/ 5
Shailesh Kumar @ Azad vs The State Of Bihar on 9 October, 2025
Further, in the recent case of Kamalakant Mishra Vs. Additional Collector & Ors., the Hon'ble Apex
Court has reiterated that the Tribunal may direct for eviction where such relief is essential to give
under "the 2007 Act". Patna High Court L.P.A No.167 of 2024 dt.09-10-2025 In the present case,
the Tribunal did not purport to adjudicate title, partition, or ownership, which remain pending
before the civil court. Its direction of eviction was a necessary measure to restore possession and
ensure the senior citizen's right to live with dignity and security. The learned Single Judge, in
affirming the Tribunal's order, therefore, committed no error in appreciating the limited but
effective jurisdiction conferred by Section 23.
Accordingly, this Court holds that the Tribunal acted within its statutory mandate, and its order of
eviction, having been affirmed by both the Appellate Authority and the learned Single Judge, does
not suffer from any jurisdictional infirmity warranting interference.
ISSUE NO. 3: Whether the appellants' asserted independent rights based on family arrangement
and revenue records can be adjudicated within the Tribunal's limited, summary jurisdiction under
the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007?
The appellants contended that their rights in the scheduled property flow from the family settlement
deed (Annexure-8 to the writ petition) and supporting revenue receipts (Annexure-9 to the writ
petition), dated 19.12.2022 (Annexure- Patna High Court L.P.A No.167 of 2024 dt.09-10-2025 SA/1
to the supplementary affidavit). It was urged that these materials demonstrate an independent claim
of ownership and that the Tribunal and the learned Single Judge erred in treating the appellants as
mere permissive occupants. According to the appellants, their claim required adjudication in the
proceedings under Section 23 of "the 2007 Act".
Per contra, the respondents argued that proceedings under "the 2007 Act" are summary in nature
and do not extend to adjudicating intricate questions of title, partition, or ownership. The
appellants, being nephews and not "children" within the meaning of Section 4 of the Act, had no
locus to resist proceedings before the Tribunal on the basis of alleged independent title. It was
submitted that the proper forum for asserting such rights is the competent Civil Court, not the
Maintenance Tribunal, whose jurisdiction is confined to ensuring protection of senior citizens'
property and residence.
Upon consideration, we find merit in the respondents' submission. Section 23 of "the 2007 Act" is
designed to safeguard senior citizens against neglect and to protect their possession and property
where transfers are made subject to a condition of maintenance. The jurisdiction is protective,
summary, and limited, Patna High Court L.P.A No.167 of 2024 dt.09-10-2025 and does not extend
to resolving competing civil claims of title or partition.
In the present case, the Tribunal correctly declined to adjudicate the appellants' claim of rights
under the alleged family arrangement and revenue entries, holding such matters to be beyond its
scope. The learned Single Judge, by judgment dated 29.01.2024 (Annexure-7 to the LPA), also
observed that the appellants were attempting to expand the summary proceedings under "the 2007
Act" into a substitute for civil litigation, which is impermissible.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/181876847/ 6
Shailesh Kumar @ Azad vs The State Of Bihar on 9 October, 2025
We accordingly hold that the appellants' asserted independent rights, even if supported by
documents such as family settlement or revenue receipts, are matters for adjudication by the civil
court, and cannot be determined in proceedings under "the 2007 Act". The Tribunal and the learned
Single Judge were correct in confining themselves to the statutory jurisdiction and in refusing to
entertain these collateral claims.
ISSUE NO.4: Whether in the facts and circumstances of the case, the beneficial object and mandate
of the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007 require sustaining the
Tribunal's order as affirmed by the learned Single Judge?
Patna High Court L.P.A No.167 of 2024 dt.09-10-2025 The appellants urged that the Tribunal, by
order dated 14.03.2020 (Annexure-4 to the writ petition), and the Appellate Authority by order
dated 10.06.2022 (Annexure-2 to the LPA), travelled beyond the scope of Section 23 of the 2007 Act
by directing their eviction from the scheduled property. It was argued that the Act is primarily
intended to secure monetary maintenance and not to divest possession of property, and that the
learned Single Judge, by judgment dated 29.01.2024 (Annexure-7 to the LPA), erred in treating the
Act as a basis for dispossession.
Per contra, learned counsel for the respondents submitted that "the 2007 Act" is a welfare
legislation enacted with the avowed object of protecting senior citizens from neglect, harassment,
and deprivation of their property. It was contended that the Tribunal's jurisdiction must be
construed purposively, so as to secure the right of senior citizens to reside peacefully and with
dignity, and that eviction of unauthorized occupants is a necessary incident of that protection.
Reliance was placed upon S. Vanitha v. Deputy Commissioner, Bengaluru Urban District, (2021) 15
SCC 730, Sudesh Chhikara v. Ramti Devi, (2022) 1 SCC 705, as well as recent pronouncements of
the Supreme Court dated 02.01.2025 in Urmila Dixit Case (Supra) and dated 12.09.2025 in
Kamalakant Mishra Case.
Patna High Court L.P.A No.167 of 2024 dt.09-10-2025 On careful consideration, we find that the
object of "the 2007 Act" is to ensure not only provision of monetary maintenance but also protection
of life, dignity, and residence of senior citizens. Section 23 confers jurisdiction upon the Tribunal to
declare void transfers of property where maintenance is not provided, and by necessary implication,
to pass orders restoring possession and evicting unauthorized occupants where the continued
occupation impedes the rights of senior citizens.
In S. Vanitha case (supra), the Supreme Court emphasized that though the Tribunal cannot
adjudicate intricate civil disputes, it is empowered to pass eviction orders where occupation of
relatives or others frustrates the statutory mandate. Similarly, in Sudesh Chhikara case (supra), the
Court held that proceedings under the Act are protective and must be interpreted purposively to
secure effective relief for senior citizens. Also recently, the Supreme Court, in Kamalakant Mishra v
Additional Collector & ors. SLP(CIVIL)D no. 42786 of 2025 judgment dated 12.9.2025, reiterated
that "Tribunals constituted under "the 2007 Act" may direct eviction where such relief is essential to
give effect to the protection envisaged for senior citizens," stressing that the statute would otherwise
be rendered otiose. All these decisions underscore that the legislative intent is to provide real Patna
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/181876847/ 7
Shailesh Kumar @ Azad vs The State Of Bihar on 9 October, 2025
High Court L.P.A No.167 of 2024 dt.09-10-2025 and effective protection to senior citizens against
neglect or exploitation.
5. Applying these principles, we are of the view that the Tribunal, in directing eviction of the
appellants, acted squarely within the protective ambit of "the 2007 Act". The appellants, being
nephews and not "children" under Section 4, have no statutory right to resist proceedings, and their
alleged claims of co- ownership were rightly left to the civil court. The Tribunal's order was
necessary to secure the complainant's right to peaceful possession of his residential property, and
the learned Single Judge correctly affirmed that view by judgment dated 29.01.2024. Accordingly,
we hold that the beneficial object and mandate of "the 2007 Act" require sustaining the orders of the
Tribunal and the learned Single Judge. The appeal, being devoid of merit, deserves to be dismissed.
6. For the reasons recorded under Issues 1 to 4, this Court finds no infirmity in the concurrent
findings of the Maintenance Tribunal (order dated 14.03.2020, Annexure-4 to the writ petition), the
Collector-cum-District Magistrate in Senior Citizen Appeal No. 01/2020-21 (order dated
10.06.2022, Annexure-2 to the LPA appeal), and the learned Single Judge in Patna High Court
L.P.A No.167 of 2024 dt.09-10-2025 CWJC No. 10426 of 2022 (judgment dated 29.01.2024,
Annexure- 7 to the LPA appeal).
7. Accordingly, this Letters Patent Appeal stands dismissed. The judgment of the learned Single
Judge dated 29.01.2024 in CWJC No. 10426 of 2022 is affirmed with no order as to costs.
