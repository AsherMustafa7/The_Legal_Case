3. We have perused the FIR, which prima facie discloses the cognizable offence against the
petitioner and therefore, the prayer made to quash the FIR cannot be entertained in view of law laid
down by Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of State of Telangana Vs. Habib Abdullah Jellani reported
in (2017) 2 SCC 779 and Neeharika Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. Vs. State of Maharashtra and Others
reported in (2021) SCC Online SC 315 and as such, we are of the view that no interference is
warranted.
4. However, considering the fact that all the offences, complained of in the impugned FIR, are
punishable with a term up to 7 years, therefore, in case of effecting the arrest of the petitioner in
pursuance of the impugned FIR, it is directed that the respondents/ authorities shall ensure that the
specific provisions contained in Section 41(1)(b) and Section 41-A of CrPC and the guidelines issued
by Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Arnesh Kumar Vs. State of Bihar reported in (2014) 8 SCC 273
