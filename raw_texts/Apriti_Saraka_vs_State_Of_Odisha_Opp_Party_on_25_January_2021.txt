02. 25.01.2021 The matter is taken up through Video
Conferencing.
Heard learned counsel for the petitioners and
learned counsel for the State.
This is an application under section 438 Cr.P.C. for
grant of anticipatory bail to the petitioners in connection
with Bisam Katak P.S Case No. 148 of 2020
corresponding to G.R. Case No. 472 of 2020 now pending
in the file of learned J.M.F.C., Bisam Katak for alleged
commission of offences under sections 143, 148, 147,
341, 294, 323, 354, 427, 324, 325, 307, 506, 149 of the
Indian Penal Code.
Perused the F.I.R. annexed to the anticipatory bail
application.
Taking into account the background of civil dispute
between the parties, and the main allegation is against
the co-accused Samsing Saraka, the petitioners are
ladies and keeping in view the proviso to section 437(1)
of Cr.P.C. and on hearing the learned counsel for the
State, I am inclined to release the petitioners on
anticipatory bail and accordingly, this Court directs that
in the event of arrest of the petitioners in connection
with the aforesaid case, they shall be released on bail on
furnishing bail bond of Rs.10,000/-(Rupees ten
thousand) each with two sureties each for the like
amount to the satisfaction of the arresting officer with

him from disclosing any facts to the Courts or to the
