of Rs.83,348/-. But an amount of Rs.13,11,823/- was kept pending by Southco Utility without

of package VI of work order, M/s Maa Bhairabi had purchased and deployed materials to the site to

placed with the respondent No.2 by Southco and all the work orders have been placed with the NSIC
Ltd. with different terms and conditions. Accordingly, as per the work order placed by the NSIC
Ltd., the respondent No.2 has executed the work. It was also brought to the notice of the council that
as against the invoice raised by the claimant through NSIC for execution of his works, an amount of
Rs. 31,33,492/- has already been released in favour of the respondent No.2 by deducting statutory

dues of M/s Maa Bhairabi. Accordingly it was directed that the present Appellant would pay the
principal amount of Rs.39,62,511/- and interest claim of Rs.44,67,254/- calculated up to 31.7.2017
as per Section 15 & 16 of MSMED Act, 2006 and further compound interest with monthly rest shall

not entertained by the Ld. District Judge, hence the present Appeal.
i. This Appeal u/s 37 of the A&C Act arises out of judgment dated 12.1.2023 passed by the learned
District Judge, Ganjam in FAO No. 19 of 2022 arising out of award dated 19.1.2019 passed by Micro

Rs.23,05,000/- as a principal and Rs.20,78,923/- as interest (Total amount of Rs.43,83,923/-) for
realization of the same. vii. Upon being noticed by the MSEFC, Cuttack, the Appellant appeared in
the case and filed his written objection denying the averments made in the claim petition. The
Appellant in his written objection has stated that in spite of repeated request by the Engineer-in-
Charge, the claimant has failed to execute the Work order within time. Due to slow progress of the
work by the claimant on 28.10.2016, the procurement committee meeting for CAPEX was held at
OPTCL office, Bhubaneswar and decision was taken to cancel the Work order along with forfeiture
of the EMD dues. As per the Para-36 of the Work order it is stipulated that if any disputes arises the
party to approach the competent authority and the competent authority is to resolve the dispute in
accordance with the provisions of the arbitration and conciliation Act 1996. In fact, without
exhausting the remedy available under the work order, the present application has been filed for
realization of the arrear dues is not maintainable. It is also submitted that there has been no such
delay as alleged in payment of dues to the claimant for the bills submitted by him.
Designation: AR-CUM- SR. SECRETARY Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date:
18-Feb-2025 17:31:36 viii. On 19.1.2019 in its 64th sitting it is alleged that the MSEFC conducted a
hearing and passed an order without considering the matter in its proper perspectives and without
going through the factual aspect of the case and without applying its judicial mind and sans any
reasons observed that M/s Maa Bhairabi has approached the present Appellant for amicable
settlement but the Appellant did not pay any heed to it, therefore the Appellant is liable to pay the
legitimate outstanding dues of M/s Maa Bhairabi. Accordingly, it was directed that the present
Appellant would pay the principal amount of Rs.39,62,511 and interest claim of Rs.44,67,254/- only
calculated up to 31.7.2017 as per Section 15 & 16 of MSMED Act, 2006 and further compound
interest with monthly rest shall be payable at three times of bank rate as notified by the Reserve
Bank of India from time to time till realization of the dues.
3. Now the facts leading up to the instant Appeals have been laid down, this Court shall endeavour
to summarise the contentions of the Parties and the broad grounds that have been raised to seek the
exercise of this Court's limited jurisdiction available under S. 37 of the A&C Act. II. APPELLANTS'
SUBMISSIONS:
4. The counsels for the Appellants assail the judgment of the Ld. District Judge mainly on the
ground that the Ld. District Judge has not considered the mandatory provision of conciliation as
provided in Designation: AR-CUM- SR. SECRETARY Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK
Date: 18-Feb-2025 17:31:36 Section 18(2) of the MSMED Act, has not been complied with and
therefore, the award is bad in law and liable to be set aside. III. SUPPLIER'S SUBMISSIONS:
5. Per contra, learned counsel for the Supplier submits that there is no infirmity with the order of
the Ld. District Judge who has considered all the grounds raised by the Appellants in their proper
perspective to pass a well reasoned judgment and order.
IV. ISSUEFOR CONSIDERATION:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74052735/ 8
The Deputy General Manager vs M/S. Maa Bhairabi Traders on 14 February, 2025
6. Having heard the parties and perused the materials available on record, this Court here has
identified the following solitary issue to be determined:
A. Whether the order of the Ld. District Judge warrants interference keeping in mind
the limitations of this Court's powers under Section 37 of the A&C Act?
V. ISSUE A: WHETHER THE ORDER OF THE LD. DISTRICT JUDGE WARRANTS ANY
INTERFERENCE KEEPING IN MIND THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS COURT'S POWERS UNDER
SECTION 37 OF THE A&C ACT?
7. This Court has had the pleasure of delving into the contours of the MSMED Act in National
Aluminium Co. Ltd. v. Orissa Coal Chem. (P) Ltd.1
8. As held earlier, the very object of enacting the MSMED Act, 2006 was to facilitate the promotion
and development, and enhance the 2023 SCCOnLineOri 5234 Designation: AR-CUM- SR.
SECRETARY Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date: 18-Feb-2025 17:31:36
competitiveness of micro, small and medium enterprises. The Act also aimed to ensure timely and
smooth flow of credit to the micro, small and medium enterprises, and to minimise the incidence of
sickness. One of the main objects of the Act was to delete the Interest on Delayed Payments under
Small Scale and Ancillary Industrial Undertakings Act, 1993, and to include stringent provisions as
also to provide dispute resolution mechanism for resolving the disputes of non-payment of dues to
the micro and small enterprises. Thus, the seed of the MSMED Act, 2006 had sprouted from the
need for a comprehensive legislation to provide an appropriate legal framework and extend
statutory support to the micro and small enterprises to enable them to develop and grow into
medium ones.
9. Sections 15 to 25 contained in Chapter V of the MSMED Act, 2006 pertain to the ‚delayed
payments to micro and small enterprises‛. A bare perusal of the said provisions contained in
Chapter V shows that a strict liability is fastened on the buyer to make payment to the supplier who
supplies any goods or renders any services to the buyer, prescribing the time-limit in Section 15.
Section 16 further fastens the liability on the buyer to pay compound interest if any buyer fails to
make payment to the supplier as required under Section 15. Such compound interest is required to
be paid at three times of the bank rate notified by the Reserve Bank, notwithstanding contained in
any agreement between the buyer and supplier or in any law for the time being in force. An
obligation to make payment of the amount with interest thereon as provided under Section 16 has
been cast upon the Designation: AR-CUM- SR. SECRETARY Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT,
CUTTACK Date: 18-Feb-2025 17:31:36 buyer and a right to receive such payment is conferred on the
supplier in Section 17. Thus, Section 17 is the ignition point of any dispute under the MSMED Act,
2006. Section 18 of the Act provides for the mechanism to enable the party to the dispute with
regard to any amount due under Section 17, to make a reference to the Micro and Small Enterprises
Facilitation Council.
10.Further, if there is any dispute related to delayed payment, reference can be made to the Micro
and Small Enterprises Facilitation Council (hereinafter, 'Facilitation Council') for dispute resolution.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74052735/ 9
The Deputy General Manager vs M/S. Maa Bhairabi Traders on 14 February, 2025
Furthermore, it has been provided in the said act that the provisions contained under Section 15 to
Section 23, will have an overriding effect on any law which is in contravention of the same.
11.The MSMED Act has, therefore, provided for the establishment of MSME Facilitation Councils as
the one-stop shop for resolution of disputes under the MSMED Act. Section 18 of the MSMED Act
reads as:
"18. (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in
force, any party to a dispute may, with regard to any amount due under section 17
(Recovery of Amount Due), make a reference to the Micro and Small Enterprises
Facilitation Council.
(2) On receipt of a reference under sub-section (1), the Council shall either itself
conduct conciliation in the matter or seek the assistance of any institution or centre
providing alternate dispute resolution services by making a reference to such an
institution or centre, for conducting conciliation and the provisions of sections 65 to
81 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 shall apply to such a dispute as if the
conciliation was initiated under Part III of that Act.
Designation: AR-CUM- SR. SECRETARY Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date:
18-Feb-2025 17:31:36 (3) Where the conciliation initiated under sub-section (2) is not successful
and stands terminated without any settlement between the parties, the Council shall either itself
take up the dispute for arbitration or refer to it any institution or centre providing alternate dispute
resolution services for such arbitration and the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,
1996 shall then apply to the dispute as if the arbitration was in pursuance of an arbitration
agreement referred to in sub-section (1) of section 7 of that Act. ...
(5) Every reference made under this section shall be decided within a period of ninety days from the
date of making such a reference." [Emphasis is ours]
12. A bare perusal of the above, it appears that there is a two tiered dispute resolution system
provided in the MSMED Act itself for facilitating the promotion and development, and enhancing
the competitiveness of micro, small and medium enterprises and for matters connected therewith or
incidental thereto.
13.Section 18 starts with a non obstante clause i.e. ‚notwithstanding anything contained in any other
law for the time being in force‛. It means that the said provision has been enacted with the aim to
supersede other laws for the time being in force. Further, a dedicated statutory forum i.e. the Micro
and Small Enterprises Facilitation Council (as established under Section 20of the MSMED Act,
2006), has been provided so that a reference could be made by any party to the dispute. Sub-section
(2) of Section 18 empowers the Facilitation Council, on receipt of such reference made under
sub-section (1), to conduct conciliation in the matter or seek assistance of any institution or centre

an institution or centre, for conducting conciliation, as contemplated in Sections 65 to 81 of the
Arbitration Act, 1996. If the conciliation initiated under sub-section (2) is not successful and stands
terminated without any settlement between the parties, the Council is further empowered under
sub-section (3) to either itself take up the dispute for arbitration or refer to it any institution or
centre providing alternate dispute resolution services for such arbitration. The provisions of the
Arbitration Act, 1996 are then made applicable to the dispute as if the arbitration was in pursuance
of an arbitration agreement referred to in sub-section (1) of Section 7 of the Arbitration Act, 1996.
Sub-section (4) of Section 18 again starts with a non obstante clause i.e. "notwithstanding anything
contained in any other law for the time being in force", and confers jurisdiction upon the Facilitation
Council to act as an arbitrator or a conciliator in a dispute between the supplier located within its
jurisdiction and a buyer located anywhere in India. Sub- section (5) of Section 18 fixes the time-limit
of ninety days to decide such reference.
14.It is, therefore, clear that only when the conciliation initiated under Section 18 (2) is not
successful, then in the absence of any settlement between the parties, the Facilitation Council under
Section 18 (3) is to either itself take up the dispute for arbitration or refer to it any institution or
centre providing alternate dispute resolution services for such arbitration.

15.The conciliation envisioned in the MSMED Act, not being a voluntary but compulsory step, any
failure to initiate/conduct the same would render a consequent award passed by the MSEFC bad in
law and liable to be set aside. The same view has also been reiterated by the Supreme Court in
Jharkhand Urja Vikas Limited v. The State of Rajasthan and Ors.2 wherein the Apex Court held as
under:
"9. From a reading of Section 18(2) and 18(3) of the MSMED Act it is clear that the
Council is obliged to conduct conciliation for which the provisions of Sections 65 to
81 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 would apply, as if the conciliation
was initiated under Part III of the said Act."(emphasis is ours)
16.As far as this Court's powers of interference under Section 37 of the A&C Act is concerned, it is
apt to advert to the decision of the Supreme Court in Oil & Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. v. Western
Geco International Limited3 which was subsequently discussed in Associate Builders v. Delhi
Development Authority4. The position of law was clarified and laid down recently by the Supreme
Court in Ssangyong Engg. & Construction Co. Ltd. v. NHAI5 and more recently reiterated in UHL
Power Company Ltd. v. State of Himachal Pradesh6.
17.The award passed in pursuance of an arbitration under Section 18(3) of the MSMED Act can
therefore also only be set aside under Sections Judgement dated 15.12.2021 in Civil Appeal No. 2899

of Indian Law; or (b) the interest of India; or (c) justice or morality; or (d) if it is patently illegal.
18.A cumulative reading of the UNCITRAL Model Law and Rules, the legislative intent with which
the 1996 Act is made, Section 5 and Section 34 of the 1996 Act would make it clear that judicial
interference with the arbitral awards is limited to the grounds in Section 34. While deciding
applications filed under Section 34 of the Act, Courts are mandated to strictly act in accordance with
and within the confines of Section 34, refraining from appreciation or re-appreciation of matters of
fact as well as law. This Court may refer to the Apex Court's judgment in Uttarakhand Purv Sainik
Kalyan Nigam Ltd. v. Northern Coal Field Ltd.7, Bhaven Construction v. Sardar Sarovar Narmada
Nigam Ltd.8 And RashtriyaIspat Nigam Ltd. v. Dewan Chand Ram Saran9 for the same.
19.The limited grounds available to Courts for annulment of arbitral awards are well known to
legally trained minds. However, the difficulty arises in applying the well-established principles for
interference to the facts of each case that come up before the Courts. There is a disturbing tendency
of Courts setting aside arbitral awards, after dissecting and reassessing factual aspects of the cases to
come to a conclusion that the award needs intervention and thereafter, dubbing (2020) 2 SCC 455

HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date: 18-Feb-2025 17:31:36 the award to be vitiated by either perversity
or patent illegality, apart from the other grounds available for annulment of the award. This
approach would lead to corrosion of the object of the 1996 Act and the endeavours made to preserve
this object, which is minimal judicial interference with arbitral awards.
20.The scope of Section 37 of the Arbitration Act was further analysed by the Supreme Court in
MMTC Limited v. Vedanta Limited10 where it was held that any such interference under Section 37
cannot travel beyond the restrictions laid down under Section 34.A similar view, as stated above, has
been taken by the Supreme Court in K. Sugumar v. Hindustan Petroleum Corpn. Ltd.11.
21.This Court had the opportunity to peruse the Awards passed by MSEFC, Cuttack, Odisha and the
Ld. District Judge's judgments.
22.Section 18(2) of the MSME Act provides, on receipt of a reference, the Council shall either itself
conduct conciliation in the matter or seek the assistance of any institution or centre providing
alternate dispute resolution services by making a reference to such an institution or centre, for
conducting conciliation. It is only in the event that such conciliation fails, shall the Council proceed
to enter into the realm of arbitration under Section 18 (3) of the MSMED Act. Section 18(2) of the
MSMED Act further provides that Sections 65 to 81 of the A&C Act shall apply to such a conciliation
attempt.

23.It is pertinent to mention herein that the basic tenet of a conciliation proceeding is derived from
a person being appointed as the conciliator who shall then assist the parties in an ‚independent‛
manner in their attempt to reach an amicable settlement of their dispute. The purpose behind
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74052735/ 12
The Deputy General Manager vs M/S. Maa Bhairabi Traders on 14 February, 2025
making this a mandatory pre-cursor to the MSEFC entering into the realms of arbitration is that the
parties have the opportunity to explore the possibility of privately settling their issue with the
assistance and support of an independent person, who would facilitate and buttress such dialogue.
24. In the facts of the present case, upon a perusal of the orders of the Facilitation Council, this
Court is perturbed to note that the Council did not refer the parties for a proper attempt of
conciliation despite the statutory mandate prescribed under Section 18(2). Firstly, no reference to
Section 18(2) of the MSMED Act was made, and secondly, no conciliator was appointed. There is
only one line pertaining to M/s. Maa Bhairabi approaching the Appellant for 'settlement' and then
complete silence.
25.This ground and glaring infirmity was raised by the Appellants before the Ld. District Judge who
was, however, of the opinion that the fact that the party had allegedly approached the Appellant for
settlement satisfied the statutory requirement under Section 18(2) of the MSMED Act.
26.This Court is unable to accept the same. When the statute mandates that upon receipt of a
reference, the Council shall either itself conduct conciliation in the matter or seek the assistance of
any institution or Designation: AR-CUM- SR. SECRETARY Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT,
CUTTACK Date: 18-Feb-2025 17:31:36 centre providing alternate dispute resolution services by
making a reference to such an institution or centre, for conducting conciliation, the Council was
bound to conduct the conciliation itself or refer the parties for such conciliation. There is no whisper
of either things being done and therefore, given the gross irregularities as well as non- conformity
committed by the MSEFC in its awards, the same in the opinion of this Court and for the reasons
stated above, shocks the conscience of this Court.
27.Violating the mandate that was laid down by the same statute that created the Facilitation
Council and a step that it was bound to follow tantamounts to contravention with the fundamental
policy of Indian law and being in conflict with the most basic notions of justice. Hence, such
contravention affords a ground under Section 34, including its explanations.
VI. CONCLUSION:
28.In light of the discussion above, keeping the settled principles of law in mind and for the reasons
given above, this Court is of the considered view that the judgment dated 12.1.2023 passed by the
learned District Judge, Ganjam in Arbitration Petition No.1 of 2021, FAO No.19 of 2022 and FAO
No.20 of 2022 arising out of award dated 18.7.2018 passed by Micro and Small Enterprises
