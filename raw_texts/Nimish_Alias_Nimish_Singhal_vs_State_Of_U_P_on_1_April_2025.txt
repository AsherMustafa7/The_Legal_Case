the second bail application, learned counsel for the applicant submits that from the recovery memo,
it is clear that only offence under Section 411 I.P.C. is made out against the applicant. From the
lower court itself, the main accused namely Ishan Tyagi alias Vasu Tyagi has already been enlarged
on bail vide order dated 01.01.2025 passed by learned Additional Session Judge, Court No.6,
Ghaziabad. He further submits that the applicant was not present in the Scorpio car. The applicant
has no criminal history. The applicant is languishing in jail since 21.10.2023. In case, he is released
on bail, he will not misuse the liberty of bail and will cooperate in the trial by all means. Lastly, it is
submitted that there is no chance of applicant fleeing away from judicial process or tampering with
the witnesses.
Learned counsel for the opposite party no.2 as well as learned AGA for the State have vehemently
opposed the bail prayer stating therein that the aforesaid arguments as placed by learned counsel for
the applicant do not constitute any new ground as the same has already been considered by the
Court while rejecting the first bail, therefore, he is not entitled to be released on bail. They further
contend that bail cancellation has already been moved before the court concerned for cancelling the
bail of main accused Ishan Tyagi alias Vasu Tyagi.
Considering the submissions advanced by learned counsel for the parties, nature of the offence and
perusal of the material/evidence brought on record, complicity of the accused and severity of
punishment, no new ground is found to exercise the discretion in favour of the accused-applicant.
Thus, the bail application stands rejected.
