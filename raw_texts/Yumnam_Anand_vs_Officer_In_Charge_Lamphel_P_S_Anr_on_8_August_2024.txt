[8] The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the
present petitioner filed an Anticipatory bail being Cril. Misc (AB) Case No.
24 of 2024 before the ld. Sessions Judge, Imphal West. In the initial
stage, the Ld. Sessions Judge, Imphal West allowed the petitioner to go
on interim bail. However, after submission of the bail objection and after
hearing both the parties, the Ld. Sessions Judge, Imphal West
rejected/cancelled the Ad-interim bail order vide order dated
06.07.2024.
Relevant portion of the order dated 06.07.2024 passed in
Cril. Misc (AB) Case No. 24 of 2024 by the Ld. Sessions Judge, Imphal
West is reproduced here in below;
"5. Shri A. Nilachandra, Ld. P.P. opposed the application. He
submitted that investigation so far revealed that the petitioner is
the General Secretary of the outfit Salailen Mapari (KDF). It was
also submitted that the disclosure statements and material
collected indicate that the said organisation is involved in
extortion activities. CDR and SDR show the close connection of
petitioner with other members of the organization.
.....
9. The existence of an organization which posses arms and recruits members make the case much
more than an ordinary one. The petitioner is allegedly an important functionary of the organization.
Investigation into full extent of the activities of the organization and its aims and objectives requires
the custodial interrogation of its key members. Considering the petitioner's
4|Page position in the organisation, the possibility of petitioner hampering investigation cannot be
ruled out if he is granted anticipatory bail."
[9] It is admitted position of fact that the relevant section put up in the FIR are of serious one and
on further perusal of the facts of the case, the police needs thorough investigation of the case. One of
the already arrested accused, in his statement submits that in commission of the crime there were
more than 10 persons. The Ld. PP submits before the Ld. Sessions Judge, Imphal West that the
present petitioner is the General Secretary of the outfit Salailen Mapari (KDF).
[10] Considering the facts and circumstances, this Court is of the view that interference of the said
order dated 06.07.2024 passed in Cril. Misc (AB) Case No. 24 of 2024 by the Ld. Sessions Judge,

Yumnam Anand vs Officer In Charge Lamphel P.S & Anr on 8 August, 2024
Imphal West is not call for.
[11] As the investigation of the case is at the initial stage and considering the seriousness of the facts
made in the case, the present application filed by the petitioner is rejected.
[12] Accordingly, the present anticipatory bail application is rejected and disposed of.
