ORDER
All these revision petitions are disposed of by a common order as the parties and the question to be
decided are common.
2. The Principal District and Sessions Judge, Udupi, by his common judgment dated 31.8.2019
dismissed Criminal Appeals 5 to 10/2019 preferred by the petitioner herein challenging the
judgment of conviction passed by Judicial Magistrate First Class ('Magistrate' for short'), Udupi, in
C.C.Nos.
:: 7 ::
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/65413281/ 5
Mr. G. H. Abdul Kadri vs Mr. Mohammed Iqbal on 24 May, 2022
2013/2018, 2015/2018, 2016/2018, 2017/2018, 2018/2018 and 2019/2018. The
petitioner being the accused in all these criminal cases faced prosecution for the
offence under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act as the cheques issued by
him for discharging his liability in connection with the loan said to have been
obtained by him from the respondent were dishonoured for want of sufficient funds
in his bank account.
3. It has been held by the Magistrate in all the cases that the petitioner did not appear before the
court in spite of service of summons on him. Therefore the Magistrate, following the judgment of the
Supreme Court in the case of Indian Bank Association and Others vs Union of India [(2014) 5 SCC
590], accepted the affidavits filed in all the cases by the respondent, dispensed with the statement of
the accused under :: 8 ::
section 313 Cr.P.C and then proceeded to convict and sentence the petitioner in all
the cases. Except referring to the judgments of the Supreme Court in Indian Bank
Association, T.Vasanthakumar vs Vijayakumari [(2015) 8 SCC 378], K.Subramani vs
Damodar Naidu [(2015) 1 SCC 99] and Heinz India Private Limited vs State of Uttar
Pradesh [(2012) 5 SCC 443], the learned Magistrate has not discussed the facts and
the evidence.
4. The learned Sessions Judge has held that from the evidence given by the complainant and the
documents produced by him, a case against the petitioner/accused was made out. The Sessions
Judge has observed that as it is held in various judgments that offence under section 138 is a
document based offence and therefore there is no need for waiting for the accused to appear before
:: 9 ::
the court, the trial court is justified in convicting the petitioner in all the cases.
5. Sri P.P.Hegde, learned senior counsel for the petitioner, assailing the judgment of the Sessions
Court as also of the Magistrate urged the following grounds for consideration in these revision
petitions : -
5.1. The trial court erred in holding the trial in the absence of the accused;
unfortunately the Sessions Court also affirmed the findings of the trial court without
noticing the fact that the accused was not secured at all. Criminal trials must be held
in the presence of the accused unless the accused seeks exemption of his personal
appearance.
5.2. Section 143 of the Negotiable Instruments Act provides for summary trial and it
is clearly mentioned in the said section that the procedure prescribed in sections 262
to 265 of the :: 10 ::
Code of Criminal Procedure shall apply for conducting trials. In this view, recording
plea of the accused under section 251 of Cr.P.C is compulsory. Since the trial court
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/65413281/ 6
Mr. G. H. Abdul Kadri vs Mr. Mohammed Iqbal on 24 May, 2022
has not followed this procedure, the judgment of conviction violates the concept of
due procedure of law found in Article 21 of the Constitution of India.
5.3. The trial court has referred to many judgments of the Supreme Court, but it has
failed to understand the actual principles laid down in them. The Sessions Judge,
sitting in appeal, should have meticulously examined whether the judgment of the
trial court challenged before him could actually be sustained. Even the approach of
the Sessions Judge appears to be very mechanical.
5.4. If the accused does not respond to the summons issued by the Magistrate, his
presence must be secured by issuing warrant or proclamation. The judgment of the
Supreme Court :: 11 ::
in Indian Bank Association does not state that the trial can be held in the absence of
the accused, there is no concept of placing the accused ex-parte as is prevalent in civil
trials. Examination of the accused under section 313 Cr.P.C is also mandatory and it
can be dispensed with only in summons trials if the personal appearance of the
accused is exempted. This is not the case here. Thus both the courts have failed to
follow the procedure and thereby deprived the accused of an opportunity to defend
himself. In this view, all the petitions require to be allowed and the judgments of the
appellate court as also the trial court are to be set aside and the trial court be directed
to hold fresh trial.
6. Sri Shobhith N Shetty, learned counsel for the respondent in all the cases, argued that actually
summons was served on the accused, he did not appear before the court and in this view :: 12 ::
the trial court had to proceed further in his absence. The Magistrate has followed the
procedure laid down by the Supreme Court in Indian Bank Association. There is no
legal infirmity in the judgment of the trial court which has been rightly confirmed by
the appellate court. Therefore the petitions are to be dismissed.
7. I have carefully considered the arguments of the learned counsel for the parties. The judgment of
the sessions court in the appeal, as has been already observed, is since mechanical affirmation of the
findings of the trial court, it is better to examine the findings recorded by the trial court.
8. In the beginning itself, unhesitatingly, it can be stated that the judgment of the trial court is a very
good example as to how justice suffers if the judges blindly place reliance on case law without
understanding the true purport of the :: 13 ::
principles laid down in those decisions with utter disregard for the first principles of
law.
9. The reasoning portion of the judgment of the trial court starts from para 16. The trial court has
drawn presumption in favour of the respondent under sections 118 and 139 of the Negotiable
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/65413281/ 7
Mr. G. H. Abdul Kadri vs Mr. Mohammed Iqbal on 24 May, 2022
Instruments Act observing that the petitioner being the accused failed to rebut the evidence given by
the respondent. Following the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Indian Bank
Association, the trial court adopted the affidavit filed by the respondent at the inception as sufficient
compliance of evidence to be adduced post summons stage, and of course there is no legal infirmity
in it. But the trial court has proceeded on the ground that the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
Indian Bank Association has held that there is no need to secure the presence of the accused. This is
the wrong committed by :: 14 ::
the trial court. If the entire judgment of the Supreme Court in the said case is read,
no where it is found that in case the accused fails to appear before the court having
received summons, the trial can be held in his absence. In the guidelines the Hon'ble
Supreme Court has set out, guideline Nos.2,3 and 4 read as below:
"23.2. MM/JM should adopt a pragmatic and realistic approach while issuing
summons. Summons must be properly addressed and sent by post as well as by
e-mail address got from the complainant. The Court, in appropriate cases, may take
the assistance of the police or the nearby Court to serve notice on the accused. For
notice of appearance, a short date be fixed. If the summons is received back
un-served, immediate follow up action be taken.
23.3. Court may indicate in the summons that if the accused makes an application for
compounding of offences at the first hearing of the case and, if :: 15 ::
such an application is made, the Court may pass appropriate orders at the earliest.
23.4. The Court should direct the accused, when he appears to furnish a bail bond, to
ensure his appearance during trial and ask him to take notice under Section 251
Cr.P.C. to enable him to enter his plea of defence and fix the case for defence
evidence, unless an application is made by the accused under Section 145(2) for
re-calling a witness for cross-examination."
10. The above observations clearly indicate that summons must be sent to the proper address of the
accused and that the summons may also be served by sending it to the email address of the accused;
and in appropriate cases, the assistance of the police or the near by court may be sought for service
of summons. It is further stated that if the summons served is received back unserved, immediate
follow up action must be taken. That :: 16 ::
means, if summons is not served, the reason for non-service must be ascertained and
then summons may be re-issued or warrant may be issued. This para does not
indicate that if the accused does not appear before the court in spite of service of
summons on him, the trial can be held in his absence. Contextually, reliance may be
placed on the judgment of the Division Bench of this court in M/s Mac Charles (I)
Limited vs Chandrashekar and Another [ILR 2005 KAR 3648], where it is held :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/65413281/ 8
Mr. G. H. Abdul Kadri vs Mr. Mohammed Iqbal on 24 May, 2022
"9. ...... The Rule enacted in this Section makes it imperative that all evidence in an
inquiry or trial shall be taken in the presence of the accused. That being so, no
exparte decision regarding the guilt or otherwise of the accused can be recorded in
the absence of the accused. This being the clear position of law in case of criminal
trials, it is to be held that no criminal trial where the plea of the accused has to be ::
17 ::
recorded, the evidence has to be taken at a trial and the accused if found guilty will
have to be convicted and sentenced either with imprisonment or fine, could be
effectively held in the absence of the accused. In other words, the exparte procedure
as prescribed under the civil law is unknown to criminal law. In this view of the
matter, our answer to Question No. 3 must necessarily be in the negative."
11. Chapter XXIII of Code of Criminal Procedure deals with evidence in inquiries and trials and this
chapter is applicable irrespective of the nature of trial, whether it be summary or summons or
warrant or sessions. Section 273 which is a part of Chapter XXIII clearly states as below:
"273. Evidence to be taken in presence of accused. Except as otherwise expressly
provided, all evidence taken in the course of the trial :: 18 ::
or other proceeding shall be taken in the presence of the accused, or, when his
personal attendance is dispensed with, in the presence of his pleader.
Explanation.- In this section," accused"
includes a person in relation to whom any proceeding under Chapter VIII has been commenced
under this Code." Reading of this section makes it very clear that the evidence must be taken in the
presence of the accused and it may be recorded in the absence of the accused if it is expressly
provided in Cr.P.C. If the personal attendance of the accused is dispensed with, evidence may be
recorded in the presence of the pleader of the accused. The only provision that provides for
recording of evidence in the absence of the accused is section 299. Therefore it is clear that except
under Section 299, evidence cannot be recorded for any other reason in the absence of the accused.
:: 19 ::
12. In the case on hand, it is not in dispute that the petitioner did not appear before the court. If the
petitioner did not appear having received summons, the trial court ought to have issued warrant and
then proclamation for securing his presence. The records do not disclose any such effort being made
by the trial court to secure the presence of the accused. This is the blatant error that can be pointed
out from the judgment of the trial court. It is trite to observe here that in the Code of Criminal
Procedure, there is no provision for keeping an accused ex parte similar to one found in Code of
Civil Procedure which provides for placing a defendant ex parte if there is due service of summons
or notice on him. The reason may perhaps be due to requirement that trial is to be held in the
presence of the accused. If for any reason the presence of the accused cannot be secured despite
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/65413281/ 9
Mr. G. H. Abdul Kadri vs Mr. Mohammed Iqbal on 24 May, 2022
exhausting every mode of service, especially in relation to offences under special :: 20 ::
laws, including Negotiable Instruments Act and if evidence is to be recorded in the
absence of the accused, law requires to be amended. The legislature must think of
bringing suitable amendment to Code of Criminal Procedure or to the special law to
enable the court to conduct the proceedings in the absence of the accused. The
amendment, perhaps, may deter unscrupulous elements who would resort to
avoiding service of summons or execution of warrant against them.
13. The trial court has then dispensed with examination of the accused under section 313 of Cr.P.C.
The accused did not appear and examining him under this section did not arise. But the trial court
has given some reasons again based on the judgment in Indian Bank Association. The appellate
court holds that the conclusion of trial court to dispense with recording of statement under section
311 Cr.P.C is also supported by :: 21 ::
another judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Basavaraj R Patil and Others
vs State of Karnataka and Others [(2000) 8 SCC 740] and of the coordinate Bench of
this court in M/s Cheminova India Limited vs Jajee Pesticides and Others [ILR 2013
KAR 5395]. Therefore appellate court is also of the view that recording of statement
of the accused under section 313 Cr.P.C can be dispensed with.
14. Now if these decisions are read, Indian Bank Association does not discuss the aspect of
examining the accused under section 313 Cr.P.C; and it has given certain directions for the trial of
the cases under section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act. In Basavaraj R Patil, the discussion
pertains to alternative mode of obtaining statement of accused without securing his personal
presence. What is held is :
:: 22 ::
"24. We think that a pragmatic and humanistic approach is warranted in regard to
such special exigencies. The word "shall in clause (b) to Section 313(1) of the Code is
to be interpreted as obligatory on the Court and it should be complied with when it is
for the benefit of the accused. But if it works to his great prejudice and disadvantage
the Court should, in appropriate cases, e.g., if the accused satisfies the court that he is
unable to reach the venue of the court, except by bearing huge expenditure or that he
is unable to travel the long journey due to physical incapacity or some such other
hardship relieve him of such hardship and at the same time adopt a measure to
comply with the requirements in Section 313 of the Code in a substantial manner.
How this could be achieved?
25. If the accused (who is already exempted from personally appearing in the Court)
makes an application to the court praying that he may be allowed to answer the
questions without making :: 23 ::
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/65413281/ 10
Mr. G. H. Abdul Kadri vs Mr. Mohammed Iqbal on 24 May, 2022
his physical presence in court on account of justifying exigency the court can pass
appropriate orders thereon, provided such application is accompanied by an affidavit
sworn to by the accused himself containing the following matters: (a) A narration of
facts to satisfy the court of his real difficulties to be physically present in court for
giving such answers. (b) An assurance that no prejudice would be caused to him, in
any manner, by dispensing with his personal presence during such questioning. (c)
An undertaking that he would not raise any grievance on that score at any stage of the
case."
Therefore it is clear that Basavaraj R Patil does not dispense with examination of the accused under
section 313 Cr.P.C.
15. The facts in Cheminova India Limited show that the trial court dispensed with the examination
of the accused under section 313 :: 24 ::
Cr.P.C, but that aspect did not actually emanate for discussion before the coordinate
bench. The scope of section 145 of Negotiable Instruments Act was the point of
discussion and no where it is held that examination of the accused under section 313
Cr.P.C can be dispensed with. Thus it is clear that both the courts below have
misapplied the principles laid down in the above referred decisions.
16. Conclusion therefore is that trial cannot be held in the absence of an accused unless personal
appearance is dispensed with for valid reasons and there cannot be dispensation of examination of
an accused under section 313 Cr.P.C if incriminating evidence appears in the evidence of the
witness. Speedy trial does not take the meaning of jumping the stages in criminal trial. In view of
this discussion, I hold that all these revision petitions deserve to be allowed for :: 25 ::
the purpose of disposal of all the cases afresh by the trial court. Hence, the following :
ORDER The revision petitions are allowed.
(i) Judgment dated 31.8.2019 in Criminal Appeals 5 to 10/2019 on the file of
