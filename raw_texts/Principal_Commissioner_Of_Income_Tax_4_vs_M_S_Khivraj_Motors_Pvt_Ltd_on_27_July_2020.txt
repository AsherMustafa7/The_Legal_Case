2. The Revenue has filed the present appeals aggrieved by the order of the learned Income Tax
Appellate Tribunal, Madras B Bench, dated 5.8.2016 in and 2011-12, dismissing the appeals of the
Revenue and upholding the order of the learned Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) II,
Chennai, dated 3.11.2014 for the assessment years 2010-11 and 2011-12 and holding that the rental
income from the I.T. Park, namely, Olympia Tech Park is taxable under the head “Income From
Business” and under the head "income from house property".
3. The following purported substantial questions of law are sought to be raised in the present
appeals filed by the Revenue :-
1. Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law the Appellate
Tribunal is correct in upholding the order of CIT(A) directing the Assessing Officer to
treat the rental income from the letting out of property as "income from business"
and to allow the claim on deduction u/ s.80IA(4)(iii)of the Income Tax Act?
2. Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case and in law, Tribunal was
justified in holding that the rental receipts to be assessed under the head "Income
from Business" when assessee was not engaged in any business activity
http://www.judis.nic.in Order dt.27.07.2020 in TCA Nos.314 & 315/2017 and as the
condition for chargeability of property income as provided under the provision of
Section 22 of the IT Act are satisfied in the present case and thereby to be assessed
under the head "Income from house property" only?
3. Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case, the Appellate Tribunal was
correct in disregarding the fact that the assessee has not developed or developed and
maintained an Industrial Park by 31.03.2006 as stipulated by the Industrial Park
Scheme-2002, and hence the same has not yet been notified by the CBDT, therefore
the assessee is not eligible for claiming deduction u/ s.80IA(4)(iii) of the Income Tax
Act?
4. Whether the Appellate Tribunal is right in not following the ratio of Apex Court's
decision in Keyaram Hotels vs.CIT (2015) 63 taxmann.com 301 (SC) wherein the
Apex Court has uphleld the Madras High Court's decision 373 ITR 494 that where
assessee was not engaged in any business activity, rental income earned out of letting
out of commercial complex would be assessed as “income from house property” and
not as «business income"
and further whether non-appreciation/ ignorance of the ratio of decision of Hon'ble
Apex Court, while deciding the issue, had made the order of ITAT perverse, both in
law and facts ?
http://www.judis.nic.in Order dt.27.07.2020 in TCA Nos.314 & 315/2017
4. The finding of the learned Tribunal in this regard are quoted below from its order.

10. We have considered the rival submissions on either side and perused the relevant material
available on record. Admittedly, the assessee disclosed dividend income of Rs.6,77,302/- and
claimed as exempted. As rightly submitted by the Ld. O.R., when the assessee earned exempted
income or income which does not form part of total income and claimed expenditure, the Assessing
Officer may compute the disallowance if he is not satisfied about the claim made by the assessee. In
the case before us, the Assessing Officer computed the disallowance under Rule 80. A perusal of the
assessment order, more particularly at page 5, clearly shows that the Assessing Officer has adopted
the method prescribed under the Rule 80(2). The only contention of the assessee now before this
Tribunal is that the investment in deep discount bonds does not result in any exempted income and
the income from deep discount bonds is taxable. However, no details of investments said to be made
by the assessee which earned taxable income are available either before the Assessing Officer or
before this Tribunal. Moreover, the so-called investments in subsidiary companies are also not
available on record. In the absence of any such http://www.judis.nic.in Order dt.27.07.2020 in TCA
Nos.314 & 315/2017 details either before this Tribunal or before the CIT(Appeals) or before the
Assessing Officer, the claim of the assessee that the investment made in deep discount bonds and
subsidiary companies has to be excluded cannot be accepted. When the assessee claims that
investment in deep discount bonds resulted in taxable income, it is for the assessee to file necessary
material to substantiate its case. In the absence of any such material, this Tribunal do not find any
reason to interfere with the order of the lower authority and accordingly the same is confirmed.
5. Having heard the learned counsel for the petitioner, we are of the clear opinion that the
controversy is no longer res integra and it is squarely covered by the recent judgment of the Division
Bench of this Court in the case of M/s. PSTS Heavy Lift and Shift Ltd., Wavoo Mansion, 2nd Floor
48, (Old No.39), Rajaji Salai vs. M/s. CeeDeeYes IT Parks Pvt. Ltd., decided on 30 January 2020, in
Tax Case Appeal Nos.2193 to 2195 of 2008 & 979 of 2009. Paragraphs 17 to 22 of that judgment are
quoted below for ready reference :-
“17. We are of the clear opinion that once the property in question is used as business
asset and the exclusive business of the assessee company or firm is to earn income by
way of rental or lease money, then such rental income can be treated only as the
“Business Income of the Assessee” and not as http://www.judis.nic.in Order
dt.27.07.2020 in TCA Nos.314 & 315/2017 “Income from House Property”. The
Heads of Income is divided in various six heads, including “Income from House
Property”, which defines the specific source of earning such incomes. The income
from house property is intended to be taxed under that head mainly if such income is
earned out of idle property, which could earn the rental income by user thereof from
the lessees. But, where the income from the same property in the form of lease
rentals is the main source of business of the Assessee, which has its business
exclusively or substantially in the form of earning of the rentals only from the
Business Assets in the form of such landed properties, then, in our opinion, the more
appropriate Head of Income applicable in such cases would be “Income from
Business”.

Principal Commissioner Of Income Tax 4 vs M/S. Khivraj Motors Pvt. Ltd on 27 July, 2020
18. A bare perusal of the Scheme of the Income Tax Act, 1961, would reveal that while
computing the taxable income under the Head “Income from business or profession”,
the various deductions, including the actual expenditure incurred and notional
deductions like depreciation etc. are allowed vis-a-vis incentives in the form of
deductions under Chapter VIA. But, the deductions under the Head “Income from
House Property”; are restricted to those specified in Section 24 of the Act, like 1/6th
of the annual income towards repairs and maintenance to be undertaken by
http://www.judis.nic.in Order dt.27.07.2020 in TCA Nos.314 & 315/2017 landlords,
interest on capital employed to construct the property etc. Therefore, in all cases,
such income from property cannot be taxed only under the head “Income from House
Property”. It will depend upon the facts of each case and where such income is earned
by the Assessee by way of utilisation of its business assets in the form of property in
question or as an idle property which could yield rental income by its user, by the
lessees. In the earlier provisions of Income from House Properties, even the notional
income under the Head “Income from House Property”; was taxable in the case of
self-occupied properties by landlords, is a pointer towards that.
19. Since, in the present cases, it is not even in dispute that all the exclusive and main
source of income of the Assessee was only the rentals and lease money received from
the lessees in both the cases and the Assessing Authority took a different and
contrary view mainly to deny the claim of depreciation out of such business income in
the form of rentals, without assigning any proper and cogent reason. Merely because
the lease income or rental income earned from the lessees, could be taxed as “Income
from House Property”, ignoring the fact that that such rentals were the only source of
“Business Income”; of the Assessee, the Authorities below have fallen into the error in
http://www.judis.nic.in Order dt.27.07.2020 in TCA Nos.314 & 315/2017 holding
that the income was taxable under the Head Income from house property. The said
application of the Head of Income by the Authorities below was not only against the
facts and evidence available on record, but against the common sense itself.
20. The amended definition under Section 22 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, now
defines the “Income from House Property”; as the annual value of property, as
determined under Section 23 of the Act, consisting of buildings or lands appurtenant
thereto of which the assessee is the owner, other than such portions of such property,
as he may occupy for the purposes of any business or profession carried on by him,
the profits of which are chargeable to income tax, shall be chargeable to Income Tax
under the head “Income from house property”. Thus, even the amended definition
intends to tax the notional income of the self occupied portion of the property to run
Assessee's own business therein as business income. Therefore, the other rental
income earned from letting out of the property, which is the business of the Assessee
itself, cannot be taxed as Income from house property.
21. Moreover, the Heads of Income, as defined in Section 14 of the Act do not exist in
silos or in watertight compartments under the Scheme of http://www.judis.nic.in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131356437/ 4
Principal Commissioner Of Income Tax 4 vs M/S. Khivraj Motors Pvt. Ltd on 27 July, 2020
Order dt.27.07.2020 in TCA Nos.314 & 315/2017 tax and thus, these Heads of
Income, as we have noted above, are fields and heads of sources of income depending
upon the nature of business of the Assessee. Therefore, in cases where the earning of
the rental income is the exclusive or predominant business of the Assessee, the
income earned by way of lease money or rentals by letting out of the property cannot
be taxed under the Head “Income from house property”, but can only be taxed under
the Head “Income from business income”.
22. In view of the aforesaid, where the facts of the cases are undisputed that both the
Assessees in the present case carry on the business of earning the rental income, as
per the Memorandum of Associations only and the fact is that they were not carrying
on any other business, compels us to come to the conclusion that the present appeals
of the Assessees are required to be allowed. The same are accordingly allowed and the
question of law framed above is answered in favour of the Assessee and against the
Revenue. No costs.
6. Though the learned counsel for the Revenue Mr.Karthik Ranganathan, sought to urge before us
that the development of I.T. Park was not the main business activity of the Assessee company, he
failed to establish his contention with the help of any relevant evidence, including the memorandum
of http://www.judis.nic.in Order dt.27.07.2020 in TCA Nos.314 & 315/2017 association of the
company or any other relevant documents.
7. On the contrary, we found from the discussion in the order of the Commissioner of Income Tax
(Appeals) as well as the learned Tribunal that the Assessee has not only shown part of its income as
income from other property, but has only allowed the claim of the Assessee to tax the income from
the software companies in the form of lease rentals from Olympia Tech Park as income from
business and thereupon allowing this deduction under Section 80IA of the Act, which is allowed
only if the income from business is taxed under the head “Income from business” at the hands of the
Assessee. We do not find any material on record to establish that such income of the Assessee
during the relevant year was from any of its idle properties and the Assessee company used to enjoy
such properties as a landlord from only earning the rental income.
8. On the contrary, it seems that the Assessee diversified and added its business line for the
development of real estate of particular type, namely software companies and even though the name
of the company continue to remain as M/s. Khivraj Motors Pvt. Ltd. The burden of the argument of
the learned counsel for the Revenue, perhaps emanated from only the name of the company,
forgetting that the main business activity of the company from its http://www.judis.nic.in Order
dt.27.07.2020 in TCA Nos.314 & 315/2017 motor business had been diversified into developing a
special kinds of property and earning lease rental income as its main business income. By no stretch
of imagination, could a software park developed with the special facilities and amenities for software
companies, be described or believed to be a property created for earning rental income as income
from house property. The Tribunal not only relied upon an earlier decision of Madras High Court in
the case of CIT v. Elnet Technologies Ltd. [(2012) 213 Taxman 129], but also having considered all
these aspects in great detail, the Division Bench of this Court to which one of us (VKJ) was a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131356437/ 5
Principal Commissioner Of Income Tax 4 vs M/S. Khivraj Motors Pvt. Ltd on 27 July, 2020
member, in M/s. PSTS Heavy Lift and Shift Ltd., had clearly held that where the main business of
the company is to earn rental income as its business income, the income would be taxable under the
head “Income” entitling the petitioner Assessee to have the deductions of notional expenses like
depreciation and special deductions like Section 80IA etc.
9. It appears that just to take a contrary view in favour of the Revenue, the authorities unneccesarily
create a forum for litigation for the assessee by taking different and divergent views, despite there
being binding precedents from the jurisdictional high Court. This tendency of the revenue
authorities not to follow the judgments of superior Constitutional Courts deserves to be strongly
deprecated by imposition of suitable costs on them. http://www.judis.nic.in Order dt.27.07.2020 in
TCA Nos.314 & 315/2017
10. We would have imposed costs on the Assessing Authority for not following the binding
precedents of the Court, but, at the repeated request of the learned counsel for the Revenue, we are
making it cost easy for the appellant Revenue with the hope that the Revenue will understand the
ratios of the judgments clearly and apply the same in its letter and spirit truthfully.
11. With the above observations, we dismiss the appeals. No costs. Consequently, connected
miscellaneous petition is also dismissed.
