Govind Kumar, Sunil, Sarvesh Kumar, Vakil, Ramavatar and Sumit Kumar have already been
enlarged on bail by this Court as well as coordinate Benches of this Court vide orders dated
30.08.2024, 19.06.2024 and 16.07.2024 passed in Criminal Misc. Bail Application Nos. 19233 of
2024, 28003 of 2024, 27062 of 2024, 19357 of 2024, 21743 of 2024, 21914 of 2024 and 22394 of
2024, respectively. He further submits that the applicant may also be released on bail on the ground
of parity. He next submits that applicant does not have any criminal history apart from this case and
is languishing in jail since 05.02.2024. The trial in the aforesaid case is not likely to be concluded in
near future.
4. Per contra learned A.G.A. has opposed the bail prayer of the applicant by contending that the
innocence of the applicant cannot be adjudged at pre-trial stage, therefore, he do not deserve any
indulgence. In case the applicant is released on bail he will again indulge in similar activities and
will misuse the liberty of bail. He points out criminal history of one case against the applicant, which
is subsequent to the present case.
5. The well-known principle of "Presumption of Innocence Unless Proven Guilty," gives rise to the
concept of bail as a rule and imprisonment as an exception. A person's right to life and liberty,
guaranteed by Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, cannot be taken away simply because he or she
is accused of committing an offence until the guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt. Article
21 of the Indian Constitution states that no one's life or personal liberty may be taken away unless
the procedure established by law is followed, and the procedure must be just and reasonable. The
said principle has been reiterated by the Apex Court in Satyendra Kumar Antil Vs. Central Bureau of
Investigation and another, 2022 (10) SCC 51. Learned AGA has not shown any exceptional
circumstances which would warrant denial of bail to the applicant.
6. It is settled principle of law that the object of bail is to secure the attendance of the accused at the
trial. No material particulars or circumstances suggestive of the applicant fleeing from justice or
thwarting the course of justice or creating other troubles in the shape of repeating offences or
intimidating witnesses and the like have been shown by learned AGA for the State.
7. The object of the bail is to secure the attendance of the accused, the detention of the accused
pending trial cannot be punitive in nature as there is presumption of innocence in favour of the
accused person. Learned A.G.A. has not brought any facts and circumstances to demonstrate that
the character of the accused-applicant (s) is such that his mere presence at large would intimidate
the witness. Learned AGA for the State has not brought any fact or circumstances to indicate
criminal history or antecedents of the applicant which would disentitle the applicant for Bail.
8. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, nature of offence, evidence, complicity of the
accused, the period of detention of the applicant for the alleged offence, submissions of learned
counsel for the parties, the Court is of the view that the applicant has made out a case for bail. The
bail application is allowed.
9. Let the applicant involved in the aforesaid case crime be released on bail on her furnishing a
personal bond and two sureties each of the like amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned,
