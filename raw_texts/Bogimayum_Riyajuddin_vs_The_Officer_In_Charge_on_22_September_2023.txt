rejected vide order dated 06.04.2023 and 02.05.2023 respectively on the ground that the

[3] Brief facts of the present case is that the husband of the accused No. 2 was running the business
of selling/stocking/exhibit for sale, or distribute of medicines as Proprietor of M/S Universal
Pharmacy and accused No. 1 is the assistant/manager/caretaker of the pharmacy. After the death of
accused No. 2 husband, the proprietorship of the pharmacy was changed in the name of the accused
No. 2 and M/S Universal Pharmacy continued its business from the month of August, 2022 with
accused No. 1(present petitioner) as its manager/caretaker. On 30.03.2023, the police allegedly
recovered 921(nine hundred and twenty one) bottles of cough syrup from the medical store and
accused No. 1(present petitioner) and later on, the accused No. 2 was arrested. As per the license
issued by the competent authority in the name of the petitioner (accused No. 2), it is valid from
01.01.2023 to 31.12.2027. As per the Notification dated 24.10.2018 issued by the Joint Secretary
(Health & FW), Government of Manipur, an authorized stockists/distributors at Imphal shall not
stock more than 500 bottles of cough syrup containing codeine or its salts and retailers shall not
possess more than 20 bottles at any point of time. The police report mentioned that the accused No.
1 brought the recovered cough syrup and kept them concealed in the medical store to sell to the
willing customers illegally. It is stated that both the accused are in the trade of illegal selling of
cough syrup to the unauthorized customers for the last ten years. By the common impugned order
dated 06.04.2023 in Cril.Misc.(B) Case No. 96 & 97 of 2023, filed by the accused Nos. 1 & 2, the
learned Judge, Special Court (ND & PS), Manipur, rejected both the bail applications preferred by
the two accused on the ground that person who are found in bulk possession of manufactured drugs
without any valid authorization can be tried under the ND&PS Act, 1985 apart from the Drugs and
Cosmetics Act, 1940. Relying on the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of State of
Punjab Vs Rakesh Kumar (2019) 2 SCC 466 to the effect that person who are found in bulk
possession of manufactured drugs without any valid authorization can be tried under the ND&PS
Act, 1985 apart from the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940; the Special Court rejected the bail
applications as the investigation was at the initial stage. [4] Mr. N. Jotendro, learned senior counsel,
submits that the petitioner is a mere salesman of the Universal Pharmacy and he has no role and he
is sole earning member of his family and due to long detention in custody, his family is facing
problems. He points out that the co-accused, who is the owner of the pharmacy has already been
released by this Court vide order dated 13.06.2023. Learned senior counsel further submits that the
petitioner is also having health issues and necessary documents have been submitted by the Jail
Authority. Since, there is no further progress in the investigation and all the necessary seizures have
already been made by the police, further detention of the petitioner is not required and prays that
the petitioner be released on bail and will abide by any conditions imposed by this Court. [5] Mr. Y.
Ashang, learned PP, submits that the petitioner is the main accused in the present case and it has
already been observed by this Court in the order dated 13.06.2023. Since, the present offence relates
to the business in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances and is a crime against the society at
large, he prays that the bail application be rejected.
[6] This Court considered the rival submissions made at the Bar. The petitioner was arrested on
29.03.2023. It is an admitted fact that all the seizures and the recovery have been completed and no
