J UDGMENT
Aggrieved by Order dated 07.04.2018 of the learned
Senior Civil Judge, Kamakhyanagar in the district of
Dhenkanal, assessing the market value of the land
acquired for the purpose of determining quantum of
award of compensation at Rs.39,10,000/- as against
Rs.25,00,000/- as quantified by the Special Land
Acquisition Officer, Angul-Duburi-Sukinda Road New
BG Rail Link Project, Dhenkanal in L.A. Misc. Case
No.112 of 2014 under the provisions of Section 18, the
Appellants, persons interested, have preferred this
appeal under Section 54 of the Land Acquisition Act,
1894.
Facts:
2. A Notification No.31513, dated 25.07.2011 under
Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (for
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127276276/ 7
Dibakar Biswal vs Special Land Acquisition Officer on 21 April, 2025
brevity, "LA Act") was published in the Odisha Gazette
No.1808, dated 05.08.2011 for acquisition of land of the
Appellants (Petitioners in Court below) situated at
Mouza: Kamakhyanagar, P.S.: Kamakhyanagar, District:
Dhenkanal bearing Khata No.240, admeasuring an area
of Ac.0.22dec. bearing plot No.1937 of Kissam Sarada-I
for the purpose of Angul-Duburi-Sukinda Road, New
LAA No.99 of 2018 Page 10 of 57
B.G. Rail Link Project, Dhenkanal. Against such
acquisition compensation of an amount of Rs.8,92,386/-
was awarded in favour of the Appellants, considering the
market value of the land at Rs.25,00,000/- per acre.
2.1. Though the Appellants received the awarded amount
under protest as the compensation amount should have
been much more considering the suitability, potential
use of the land and advantageous position of the land
and possible development, objection has been raised
before the Special Land Acquisition Officer. The
compensation amount could not have been determined
based on kissam recorded in the Record-of-Right (RoR).
Objecting to such valuation of the Special Land
Acquisition Officer, the Appellants, being interested
persons, claimed the valuation of the acquired land to be
at Rs.2,50,000/- per decimal prayer was made to refer
the matter for proper assessment of the market price.
2.2. The objection, being referred under Section 18 of the LA
Act to the Court of the learned Senior Civil Judge,
Kamakhyanagar in the district of Dhenkanal, registered
as LA Misc. Case No.112 of 2014, came to be disposed of
by Order dated 07.04.2018, with the following
observation and determination:
LAA No.99 of 2018 Page 11 of 57
"14. The reference under Section 18 of the Act is
answered with observation that the market price, as
determined by Special Land Acquisition Officer for
award of compensation against the acquisition of the
land belonging to the petitioners are not adequate
and the market price of that land should have been
Rs.39,10,000/- (Thirty nine lakhs and ten thousand)
instead of Rs.25,00,000/- per acre as was
determined. As such the Special Land Acquisition
Officer, Angul-Duburi-Sukinda Road New B.G. Rail
Link, Project, Dhenkanal is directed to re-determine
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127276276/ 8
Dibakar Biswal vs Special Land Acquisition Officer on 21 April, 2025
the compensation with that enhanced market price
of that land along with other benefits for which the
petitioners being the persons interested are entitled
as per the statute, which includes the solatium. The
differential amount shall be paid to the petitioners
without inordinate delay. The petitioners are also
entitled to get an interest on that differential amount
at the rate of 9% per annum from the date on which
the possession of the lands was taken, for the first
year of possession and then at the rate of 15% till
the date of payment of such excess amount as per
Section 28 of the Act. The cost of the proceeding is
also to be awarded in favour of the petitioners by the
Special Land Acquisition Officer as per reasonable
scale apropos to Section 27 of the Act. As no
reference has been made regarding apportionment of
the amount between the petitioners as persons
interested, that should be made as per the statute.
As such the prayer for specific entitlement of
petitioner Nos.1 to 4 is negated. Similarly, the
LAA No.99 of 2018 Page 12 of 57
prayers for enhanced compensation on the ground of
severance and injurious affection of income are also
rejected in absence of merit."
2.3. Despite direction to re-determine the amount of
compensation at the enhanced market value of the
acquired land by the Senior Civil Judge,
Kamakhyanagar, the Appellants were still aggrieved and
preferred this Appeal under Section 54 of the LA Act for
further enhancement of market price.

3.3. Heard Sri Niranjan Panda-1 and Sri Manoj Kumar

Kumar Brahma, learned Additional Standing Counsel for
Respondent No.1 and Sri Satya Sindhu Kashyap,
learned Senior Panel Counsel for Respondent Nos.2 and
3.
3.4. On conclusion of hearing, the matter stood reserved for
preparation and pronouncement of Judgment/Order.
Rival contentions and submissions:
4. Suave submission was advanced by Sri Niranjan Panda-
1, learned Advocate by stating candid facts as emanated
from the memorandum of appeal and also the facts
enumerated in the order of the Reference Court.
4.1. It is urged by learned counsel for the Appellants that
without appreciating the facts in proper perspective the
learned Senior Civil Judge proceeded erroneously on the
LAA No.99 of 2018 Page 14 of 57
basis of kissam of land recorded in the RoR. He
submitted that as the land in question was near to the
State Highway, the evidence on record should have been
appropriately considered by taking into account
potential use of the land for homestead and commercial
purpose instead of kissam of the land recorded in the
RoR.
4.2. It is submitted by Sri Niranjan Panda, learned Advocate
that the acquired land situated barely at a distance of
100 meters from the State Highway connecting
Dhenkanal and Kamakhyanagar.
4.3. Referring to judgment dated 21.03.2023 passed in
Golakha Bihari Das Vrs. Special Land Acquisition Officer,
LAA No.57 of 2015 [challenging the Order dated
30.06.2015 passed in LA Misc. Case No.130 of 2014 by
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127276276/ 10
Dibakar Biswal vs Special Land Acquisition Officer on 21 April, 2025
the learned Civil Judge, Senior Division,
Kamakhyanagar], it is submitted that this Court
enhanced the market price of the land so as to enable
computation of revised compensation amount in respect
of lands in the vicinity of the land in question. In the
said appeal, it has been directed to compute the
compensation by taking into account market value at
Rs.56,41,905/- per acre.
LAA No.99 of 2018 Page 15 of 57
4.4. By furnishing copy of "map" reflecting location of the
land referred to in the present case it is submitted by
counsel for the petitioner that the subject-lands in the
aforesaid referred case situate nearby. He, thus,
essentially submitted that since the land in question
situated adjacent to or nearby the land which was
subject matter of aforesaid referred case, the instant
Appellants-claimants need to be extended with the
similar benefit by determining the amount of
compensation.
5. Sri Satya Sindhu Kashyap, learned Senior Panel Counsel
appearing for Respondent Nos.2 & 3 submitted that on
analysis of evidence on record the learned Reference
Court having applied rational mind in assessing the
value of the land, there is no warrant for this Court to
re-appreciate evidence in absence of any new or fresh
material.
5.1. Taking into consideration comparability of transactions
by virtue of sale deeds with respect to Sarad-I kissam
agricultural land which were of the year 2009, i.e., prior
to acquisition of land in 2011, the Reference Court was
inclined to have reference of the valuation mentioned in
the sale deeds as correct depiction of market value.
LAA No.99 of 2018 Page 16 of 57
Having considered 30% per year increase in the market
value, the learned Senior Civil Judge has made fair
determination at Rs.39,10,000/- per acre for the
purpose of quantification of compensation. Therefore,
there arises no necessity for showing indulgence in this
appeal.
Analysis and discussions:
6. Considered diligently the contentions of both the parties.

Dibakar Biswal vs Special Land Acquisition Officer on 21 April, 2025
By way of written note, Sri Niranjan Panda, learned
Advocate submitted that plot No.1937 which is subject-
land of the instant appeal has been acquired by virtue of
Notification dated 25.07.2011 under Section 4(1) of the
LA Act. Though in LA Misc. Case No.124 of 2013 with
respect to plot No.1913 was valued at Rs.90,00,000/-,
plot No.1915 in L.A. Misc. Case No.127 of 2013 was
valued at the same price, in Golakha Bihari Das Vrs.
Special Land Acquisition Officer, LAA No.57 of 2015, this
Court vide Judgment dated 21.03.2023 confined market
price of plot Nos.1980 and 1981 at Rs.56,41,905/-.
6.1. Sri Niranjan Panda, learned Advocate has cited for
reference Judgment dated 30.06.2015 delivered by the
learned Civil Judge (Senior Division), Kamakhyanagar in
LA Misc. Case No.130 of 2014, glance at which it
LAA No.99 of 2018 Page 17 of 57
appears the subject land acquired in connection with
Angul-Duburi-Sukinda Road New B.G. Rail Link Project,
Dhenkanal in a reference under Section 18 of the LA Act
was with respect to Plot No.1980 (Sarada-III Kissam) and
Plot No.1981 (Sarada-I Kissam) under Khata No.104(i) of
Mouza: Kamakhyanagar. In the said case, it has been
observed as follows:
"9. Coming to the present case, this Court vide its
Judgment in L.A. Misc. Case Nos.111/2014 (Ext.2)
fixed the market price of lands bearing plot nos.
1946, 1947, 1948, 1949 & 1971 belonging to the
same village and acquired by the same notification
at Rs. 56,41,905 per acre. Similarly in LA. Misc.
Case Nos. 34/2014, (Ext 3) the market price of lands
bearing plot nos. 1951, 1976 & 1977 belonging to
the same village and acquired by the same
notification was fixed at Rs.56,41,505/- per acre.
The present acquired plots bearing nos. 1980
& 1981 are adjacent to each other in east-west
direction. Plot No.1977 is situated on the
adjoining west of plot No. 1981 as would be
evident from Ext. 1. Plot No. 1976 is on the
adjacent west of plot No. 1977. Similarly plot
No.1971 is situated just two to three plots
away from plot No. 1980 & 1981, whereas plot
No. 1947, 1948 & 1949 are also located in a
close vicinity of the present acquired plots. The
situation, potentiality and advantage of these plots
are similar to each other. All the plots are located
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127276276/ 12
Dibakar Biswal vs Special Land Acquisition Officer on 21 April, 2025
LAA No.99 of 2018 Page 18 of 57
near to each other in a compact patch and being
used for the same agricultural and allied purposes.
All these plots are acquired for the same purpose
and by the same notification Plot No. 1971 & 1977
are of Sarada-III kissam like the present acquired
plot No. 1980. The Court has already enhanced
the market price of plot No. 1947, 1948, 1971,
1976 & 1977 to Rs.56,41,905/- per acre vide
Ext.2 & Ext.3. It is not the case of the opposite
party that the judgment of this Court vide Ext.2 &
Ext.3 has been set aside by any higher forum.
Therefore in my opinion the plot bearing No.
1980 & 1981 should fetch the same market
price as that of plot No.1947, 1948, 1971,
1976 and 1977, i.e., at Rs.56,41,905/- per
acre."
6.2. Said Order of the Reference Court being assailed before
this Court in LAA No.57 of 2015 (Golakha Bihari Das Vrs.
Special Land Acquisition Officer) the same got dismissed
by Judgment dated 21.03.2023, which runs as follows:
"1. Though the matter is listed under the heading Fresh
Admission, on consent of the learned Counsel for the
Parties, matter is taken up for final disposal.
2. The present Appeal has been preferred against the
judgment dated 30th June, 2015 passed in L.A.
Misc. Case 130 of 2014, vide which the prayer of the
present Appellant (Petitioner before the court below),
was partially allowed by enhancing the
LAA No.99 of 2018 Page 19 of 57
compensation amount of the suit land to
Rs.56,41,905/-, instead of Rs.25,00,000/- per acre
for Sarad-I kissam land and Rs.14,00,000/- per
acre for Sarad-II kissam land, though the claim of
the present Appellant was the market price of the
acquired land ought to have been Rs.2.5 lakh per
acre.
3. Heard Mr. Panda, learned Counsel for the Appellant,
so also Mr. Rout, learned Addl. Standing Counsel for
the State-Respondent.
4. Mr. Panda, learned Counsel for the Appellant
submits that though copy of the judgment passed by
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127276276/ 13
Dibakar Biswal vs Special Land Acquisition Officer on 21 April, 2025
the court below in L.A. Misc. Case No.127 of 2014
was exhibited before the court below to prove that
the awarded compensation amount in the said case
pertaining to similar kissam land was
Rs.90,000,00/- per acre, the court below, without
considering the said judgment (Ext.4), partially
allowed the claim of the Appellant and determined
the compensation amount to be @ Rs. 56,41,905/-
per acre. He further submits that there were 100
number of trees over the acquired land. To
substantiate the said claim, though evidence was
led before the court below, it failed to take note of
the said evidence on record.
5. Mr. Rout, learned Addl. Standing Counsel for the
State Respondent submits that there is no infirmity
in the impugned judgment as the court below, after
taking note of the pleadings on record, so also the
LAA No.99 of 2018 Page 20 of 57
documentary and oral evidence, has passed a
reasoned Order also taking note of Ext.4 in
Paragraph-10 of the impugned judgment. He further
submits that though the Land Acquisition Officer
determined market price of Sarad-I kissam land at
Rs.25,00,000/- per acre and Sarad-III kissam land
at Rs.14,00,000/-, the court below enhanced/
determined the said amount at Rs.56,41,905/- per
acre at par for acquisition of different kissams of
land i.e. Sarad-I and Sarad-III.
Mr. Rout, learned Addl. Standing Counsel for the
State Respondent further submits that, so far as the
compensation for the trees, as claimed by the
Appellant, the court below, in Paragraph-10 of the
said judgment, has specifically dealt with the said
claim stating therein that the Appellant made a bald
statement that there were 105 numbers of trees of
different variety over the acquired land and there is
no specific statement as to number and size of each
variety, so also no other supported document
regarding the number and size of the trees.
On being asked, Mr. Panda, learned Counsel for the
Appellant fails to demonstrate before this Court as to
the evidence led by the Appellant before the court
below to substantiate the said claim regarding 105
trees of different variety allegedly existing over the
acquired land.

Mr. Rout, learned Addl. Standing Counsel for the
State Respondent further draws attention of this
LAA No.99 of 2018 Page 21 of 57
Court to Paragraphs-9 and 10 of the impugned
judgment, which are reproduced below:
„9. Coming to the present case, this Court vide
its Judgment in L.A. Misc. Case
Nos.111/2014(Ext.2) fixed the market
price of lands bearing plot Nos.1946,
1947, 1948,1949 and 1971 belonging to
the same village and acquired by the same
notification, at Rs.56,41,905/- per acre.
Similarly in L.A. Misc. Case
Nos.34/2014(Ext.3) the market price of lands
bearing plot nos.1951, 1976 & 1977 belonging
to the same village and acquired by the same
notification was fixed at Rs.56,41,905/- per
acre. The present acquired plots bearing
nos.1980 & 1981 are adjacent to each other in
east-west direction. Plot No.1977 is situated on
the adjoining west of plot No.1981 as would be
evident from Ext.1. Plot No.1976 is on the
adjacent west of plot No.1977. Similarly plot
No.1971 is situated just two to three plots
away from plot No.1980 & 1981, whereas plot
No.1947, 1948 and 1949 are also located in a
close vicinity of the present acquired plots. The
situation, potentiality and advantage of these
plots are similar to each other. All the plots are
located near to each other in a compact patch
and being used for the same agricultural and
allied purposes. All these plots are acquired for
the same purpose and by the same notification.
Plot No.1971 & 1977 are Sarada-I kissam as
LAA No.99 of 2018 Page 22 of 57
like the present acquired plot No.1981.
Similarly plot No.1947, 1948 & 1976 are of
Sarada-III kissam like the present acquired plot
No.1980. This Court has already enhanced the
market price of plot No.1947, 1948, 1971, 1976
and 1977 to Rs.56,41,905/- per acre vide Ext.2
and Ext.3. It is not the case of the opp. party
that the judgment of this Court vide Ext.2 &
Ext. 3 has been set aside by any higher forum.

Dibakar Biswal vs Special Land Acquisition Officer on 21 April, 2025
Therefore in my opinion the plot bearing
No.1980 & 1981 should fetch the same market
price as that of plot No.1947, 1948, 1971, 1976
& 1977, i.e. at Rs.56,41,905/- per acre.
10. The petitioner has also relied on the judgment
delivered in L.A. Misc. Case No.127/2014
wherein land bearing plot No.1915 was
awarded compensation at the rate of
Rs.90,000,00/- per acre. But that land is a
road side land abutting to the
Kamakhyanagar-Dhenkanal State Highway.
Therefore, the potentiality of plot No.1915
cannot be compared with the present acquired
plots which are mere agricultural lands.
Regarding the trees, the petitioner made a bald
statement that there were 105 number of tress
of different variety over the acquired lands. But
the statement is not specific as to the number
and size of each variety. Barring the bald
statement, there is no other supporting
evidence regarding the number and size of the
trees. Therefore in my opinion the petitioner is
LAA No.99 of 2018 Page 23 of 57
not entitled for any higher compensation in
respect of the trees. Hence ordered.(cid:129)
6. In view of the said findings of the court below, so
also taking note of the submissions made by the
learned Counsel for the Parties, this Court is of the
view that there is no infirmity in the impugned
judgment deserving interference by this Court.
7. Accordingly, the LAA stands dismissed."
6.3. It is, thus, contended that the subject-land being plot
No.1937 under Khata No.240, being adjacent to or in the
vicinity of plot numbers under consideration of aforesaid
referred case, the valuation of the land in the present
case should at least fetch Rs.56,41,905/- per acre.
6.4. Scrutiny of the map, which is furnished by the learned
Counsel for the Appellants during the course of hearing,
it is found that the land in question, i.e., Plot No.1937 in
the present appeal is situated nearby Plot No.1980 and
1981. The valuation of lands discussed in LAA No.57 of
2015 with respect to Plot No.1980 and 1981 have been
determined at Rs.56,41,905/- per acre.

Dibakar Biswal vs Special Land Acquisition Officer on 21 April, 2025
6.5. Scanning through the Reference Court Record, it does
not reveal that such map was produced for consideration
of evidence. Furthermore, the learned Civil Judge (Senior
Division) had no occasion to have for reference the
LAA No.99 of 2018 Page 24 of 57
Judgment dated 21.03.2023 rendered by this Court in
LAA No.57 of 2015 (Golakha Bihari Das Vrs. Special Land
Acquisition Officer) at the time of disposal of LA Misc.
Case No.112 of 2014 on 07.04.2018.
7. This Court now, therefore, would examine whether the
earlier reference cases can be the basis for consideration
in the later cases?
7.1. To answer this question, it deserves to have regard to
what is spelt out in Manoj Kumar Vrs. State of Haryana,
(2018) 13 SCC 96. The observation of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court was:
"13. The awards and judgment in the cases of others not
being inter partes are not binding as precedents.
Recently, we have seen the trend of the courts
to follow them blindly probably under the
misconception of the concept of equality and
fair treatment. The courts are being swayed away
and this approach in the absence of and similar
nature and situation of land is causing more
injustice and tantamount to giving equal treatment in
the case of unequals. As per situation of a village,
nature of land, its value differ from distance to
distance, even two to three kilometre distance may
also make the material difference in valui. Land
abutting highway may fetch higher value but not
land situated in interior villages.
LAA No.99 of 2018 Page 25 of 57
14. The previous awards/judgments are the only piece
of evidence on a par with comparative sale
transactions. The similarity of the land covered
by previous judgment/award is required to be
proved like any other comparative exemplar. In
case previous award/judgment is based on
exemplar, which is not similar or acceptable,
previous award/judgment of court cannot be said to
be binding. Such determination has to be
outrightly rejected. In case some mistake has
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127276276/ 17
Dibakar Biswal vs Special Land Acquisition Officer on 21 April, 2025
been done in awarding compensation, it cannot be
followed; on the ground of parity an illegality cannot
be perpetuated. Such award/judgment would be
wholly irrelevant.
15. There is yet another serious infirmity seen in
following the judgment or award passed in
acquisition made before 10 to 12 years and price is
being determined on that basis by giving either flat
increase or cumulative increase as per the choice of
individual Judge without going into the factual
scenario. The said method of determining
compensation is available only when there is
absence of sale transaction before issuance of
notification under Section 4 of the Act and for giving
annual increase, evidence should reflect that price of
land had appreciated regularly and did not remain
static. The recent trend for last several years
indicates that price of land is more or less static if it
has not gone down. At present, there is no
appreciation of value. Thus, in our opinion, it is not a
very safe method of determining compensation.
LAA No.99 of 2018 Page 26 of 57
16. To base determination of compensation on a
previous award/judgment, the evidence
considered in the previous judgment/award
and its acceptability on judicial parameters
has to be necessarily gone into, otherwise,
gross injustice may be caused to any of the
parties. In case some gross mistake or illegality has
been committed in previous award/judgment of not
making deduction, etc. and/or sufficient evidence
had not been adduced and better evidence is
adduced in case at hand, previous award/judgment
being not inter partes cannot be followed and if
land is not similar in nature in all aspects it
has to be outrightly rejected as done in the
case of comparative exemplars. Sale deeds are
on a par for evidentiary value with such awards of
the court as court bases its conclusions on such
transaction only, to ultimately determine the value of
the property.
17. To rely upon judgment/award in case it does
not form part of evidence recorded by the
Reference Court, an application under Order
XLI, Rule 27 is to be filed to adduce evidence
and if it is allowed, opposite party has to be
given opportunity to lead evidence in rebuttal.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127276276/ 18
Dibakar Biswal vs Special Land Acquisition Officer on 21 April, 2025
The award/judgment cannot be taken into
consideration while hearing arguments unless they
form part of evidence in the case. A three-Judge
Bench of this Court has considered the value of
previous award and sale exemplar in City
Improvement Trust Board Vrs. H. Narayanaiah,
LAA No.99 of 2018 Page 27 of 57
(1976) 4 SCC 9; the judgment of the Court was
accepted as relevant evidence under Order 41 Rule
27 by the High Court, though, appeal was pending
against it. This Court held that there could be
no res judicata. In such cases, as the previous
judgment was not inter partes, the opposite
party was not given opportunity by the High
Court to show that land was different. The
decision of the High Court was held to be against the
provisions of the Evidence Act, which regulate
admissibility of all evidence including judgments.
Such judgments are in personam. This Court has
observed:
„26. It is apparent that Section 43 enacts that
judgments other than those falling under
Sections 40 to 42 are irrelevant unless they fall
under some other provision of the Evidence Act;
and, even if they do fall under any such other
provision, all that is relevant, under Section 43
of the Evidence Act, is "the existence" of such
judgment, order, or decree, provided it „is a fact
in issue, or is relevant under some other
provision of this Act(cid:129). An obvious instance of
such other provision is a judgment falling
under Section 13 of the Evidence Act. The
illustration to Section 13 of the Evidence Act
indicates the kind of facts on which the
existence of judgments may be relevant.
27. In LAO Vrs. Lakhamsi Ghelabhai, 1959 SCC
OnLine Bom 32 = AIR 1960 Bom 78 Shelat, J.
held that judgments not inter partes, relating to land acquired are not admissible merely because the
land dealt with in the judgment was situated near the land of which the value is to be determined. It
was held there that such judgments would fall neither under Section 11 nor under Section 13 of the
Evidence Act. Questions relating to value of particular pieces of land depend upon the evidence in
the particular case in which those facts are proved. They embody findings or opinions relating to
facts in issue and investigated in different cases. The existence of a judgment would not prove the
value of some piece of land not dealt with at all in the judgment admitted in evidence. Even slight
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127276276/ 19
Dibakar Biswal vs Special Land Acquisition Officer on 21 April, 2025
differences in situation can, sometimes, cause considerable differences in value. We do not think it
necessary to take so restrictive a view of the provisions of Sections 11 and 13 of the Evidence Act as
to exclude such judgments altogether from evidence even when good grounds are made out for their
admission. In Khaja Fizuddin Vrs. State of A.P., Civil Appeal No. 176 of 1962, decided on 10.04.1963
(SC), a Bench of three Judges of this Court held such judgments to be relevant if they relate to
similarly situated properties and contain determinations of value on dates fairly proximate to the
relevant date in a case.
28. The Karnataka High Court had, however, not complied with provisions of Order 41 Rule 27 of
the CPC which require that an appellate court should be satisfied that the additional evidence is
required to enable it either to pronounce judgment or for any other substantial cause. It had
recorded no reasons to show that it had considered the requirements of Rule 27 Order 41 of the CPC.
We are of opinion that the High Court should have recorded its reasons to show why it found the
admission of such evidence to be necessary for some substantial reason. And if it found it necessary
to admit it, an opportunity should have been given to the appellant to rebut any inference arising
from its existence by leading other evidence.
29. The result is that we allow these appeals and set aside the judgment and order of the Karnataka
High Court and direct it to decide the cases afresh on evidence on record, so as to determine the
market value of the land acquired on the date of the notification under Section 16 of the Bangalore
Act. It will also decide the question, after affording parties opportunities to lead necessary evidence,
whether the judgment, sought to be offered as additional evidence, could be admitted.(cid:129)
18. This Court has clearly laid down that such judgment/award cannot be received in evidence and
considered without giving an opportunity of rebuttal to opposite parties by adducing evidence. At
the stage of appeal if award/judgment has to be read in evidence, an application has to be filed
under Order 41 Rule 27 of the Code to take additional evidence on record and if allowed,
opportunity to lead evidence in rebuttal has to be allowed.
19. In Printers House (P) Ltd. Vrs. Saiyadan, (1994) 2 SCC 133, a three-Judge Bench of this Court
had considered the value of previous awards and sale exemplar to be similar. It observed:
„16. If the comparable sales or previous awards are more than one, whether the
average price fetched by all the comparable sales should form the "price basis" for
determination of the market value of the acquired land or the price fetched by the
nearest or closest of the comparable sales should alone form the "price basis" for
determination of the market value of the acquired land, being the real point requiring
our consideration here, we shall deal with it. When several sale deeds or previous
awards are produced in court as evidence of comparable sales, court has to
necessarily examine every sale or award to find out as to what is the land which is the
subject of sale or award and as to what is the price fetched by its sale or by the award
made therefor.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127276276/ 20
Dibakar Biswal vs Special Land Acquisition Officer on 21 April, 2025
17. If the sale is found to be a genuine one or the award is an accepted one, and the
sale or award pertains to land which was sold or acquired at about the time of
publication of preliminary notification under the Act in respect of the acquired land,
the market value of which has to be determined, the court has to mark the location
and the features (advantages and disadvantages) of the land covered by the sale or
the award. This process involves the marking by court of the size, shape, tenure,
potentiality, etc. of the land.
Keeping in view the various factors marked or noticed respecting the land covered by the sale or
award, as the case may be, presence or absence of such factors, degree of presence or degree of
absence of such factors in the acquired land the market value of which has to be determined, should
be seen. When so seen, if it is found that the land covered by the sale or award, as the case may be, is
almost identical with the acquired land under consideration, the land under the sale or the market
value determined for the land in the award could be taken by the court as the price basis" for
determining the market value of the acquired land under consideration. If there are more
comparable sales or awards of the same type, no difficulty arises since the price basis"
to be got from them would be common. But, difficulty arises when the comparable
sales or awards are not of the same kind and when each of them furnish a different
"price basis. This difficulty cannot be overcome by averaging the prices fetched by all
the comparable sales or awards for getting the "price basis" on which the market
value of the acquired land could be determined. It is so, for the obvious reason that
such "price basis" may vary largely depending even on comparable sales or awards.
Moreover, "price basis" got by averaging comparable sales or awards which are not of
the same kind, cannot be correct reflection of the price which the willing seller would
have got from the willing buyer, if the acquired land had been sold in the market. For
instance, in the case on hand, there are three claimants. The plots of their acquired
land, which are five in number, are not similar, in that, their location, size, shape vary
greatly. One plot of land of one claimant and another plot of another claimant appear
to be of one type. Another plot of land of one of them appears to be of a different type.
Yet another plot of the second of them appears to be different. Insofar as third
claimant's plot of land is concerned, it appears to be altogether different from the
rest. Therefore, if each of the claimants were to sell her/his respective plots of land in
the open market, it is impossible to think that they would have got a uniform rate for
their lands. The position cannot be different if the comparable sales or awards when
relate to different lands.
Therefore, when there are several comparable sales or awards pertaining to different
lands, what is required of the court is to choose that sale or award relating to a land
which closely or nearly compares with the plot of land the market value of which it
has to determine, and to take the price of land of such sale or award as the basis for
determining the market value of the land under consideration.(cid:129)

20. In Karan Singh Vrs. Union of India, (1997) 8 SCC 186, this Court held that evidence has to be
adduced to show similarity of the land in question to the one covered by previous award/judgment.
This Court observed:
„8. The learned counsel for the appellants then urged that the High Court
erroneously discarded Ext. A-11 which was an award in respect of a land at Village
Jhilmil Tahirpur on the ground that it was not a previous judgment of the Court. The
land comprised in the award was acquired under Notification issued under Section 4
of the Act on 27.07.1981. By the said award, the Court awarded compensation @
Rs.625 per sq yd. It has earlier been seen that in the present case the notification
issued under Section 4 of the Act was earlier in point of time than the notification
issued for acquisition of land comprised in Ext. A-11. There is no quarrel with the
proposition that judgments of courts in land acquisition cases or awards given by the
Land Acquisition Officers can be relied upon as a good piece of evidence for
determining the market value of the land acquired under certain circumstances. One
of the circumstances being that such an award or judgment of the court of law must
be a previous judgment. In Pal Singh Vrs. State (UT of Chandigarh), (1992) 4 SCC
400, it was observed thus:
„5. ...But what cannot be overlooked is, that for a judgment relating to value of land to
be admitted in evidence either as an instance or as one from which the market value
of the acquired land could be inferred or deduced, must have been a previous
judgment of court and as an instance, it must have been proved by the person relying
upon such judgment by adducing evidence aliunde that due regard being given to all
attendant facts and circumstances, it could furnish the basis for determining the
market value of the acquired land.(cid:129) Following this decision, we hold that it is only the
previous judgment of a court or an award which can be made the basis for
assessment of the market value of the acquired land subject to party relying on such
judgment to adduce evidence for showing that due regard being given to all attendant
facts it could form the basis for fixing the market value of acquired land.(cid:129)
21. In Ranvir Singh Vrs. Union of India, (2005) 12 SCC 59, this Court considered value of previous
judgment/award and held that it is only piece of evidence. There cannot be fixed criteria for
determining compensation at any fixed rate, observing that:
„36. Furthermore, a judgment or award determining the amount of compensation is
not conclusive. The same would merely be a piece of evidence. There cannot be any
fixed criteria for determining the increase in the value of land at a fixed rate. We,
therefore, are unable to accept the contention of Mr. Nariman that as in one case we
have fixed the valuation at Rs 7000 per bigha wherein the lands were acquired in the
year 1961, applying the rule of escalation the market rate should be determined by
calculating the increase in the prices @ 12% p.a. We do not find any justifiable reason
to base our decision only on the said criterion.(cid:129)

22. A three-Judge Bench in Mysore Urban Development Authority Vrs. Sakamma, (2010) 14 SCC
503 has observed in absence of evidence as to comparable land, award/judgment in another case
cannot be accepted. This Court held:
„8. There is no evidence to show that the acquired lands at Keragalli and
Maragowdanahalli are comparable lands with similar market value. The distance, the
extent of development and the facilities available in the two villages make it clear that
the award made by the Reference Court with reference to an acquisition in
Maragowdanahalli Village cannot be the basis for determining the market value for
the lands at Keragalli.
9. We are of the view that the Reference Court and the High Court committed a
serious error in relying upon the judgment (Ext. P-2) relating to Maragowdanahalli,
to determine the market value of lands at Keragalli. If Ext. P-2 is excluded, we find
that there is no evidence to determine the market value, as the only other document
relied upon by the landowners was a sale transaction of 2007 which being nearly one
decade after the acquisition, is not of any assistance. We also find that no evidence
has been let in by the appellant in regard to the market value though the award of the
Land Acquisition Officer refers to sale transactions during 1997-1998 showing a value
of Rs.2,50,000 per acre in Keragalli. But those sale deeds were not produced.
10. We are also told that the reference cases in regard to several other lands under the
same acquisition are still pending before the Reference Court and some cases are
pending in the High Court. In the absence of any acceptable evidence, it is not
possible for us to determine the market value. It would appear that sale transactions
relating to 1996-1998 for lands near to acquired lands are available but not produced.
Some of them are now produced by the appellant. We cannot obviously rely upon
them as they are produced for the first time in this Court and the landowners did not
have an opportunity to have their say in regard to such transactions by letting
evidence.
Interests of justice, therefore, requires that the matter should be remanded.(cid:129)
23. Basic principle before following award/judgment or comparative sales is that land should be
comparable in nature and quality as laid down in State of M.P. Vrs. Kashiram, (2010) 14 SCC 506
and Hirabai Vrs. LAO, (2010) 10 SCC 492 and in close proximity of time to preliminary notification
under Section 4 of the Act. In the instant case, we hold that the High Court could not have followed
the judgment in a blind manner as done without due consideration of various aspects.
***
25. This Court in Chimanlal Hargovinddas Vrs. LAO, (1988) 3 SCC 751 has laid down broad
principles to be followed in the case of determination of compensation thus:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127276276/ 23
Dibakar Biswal vs Special Land Acquisition Officer on 21 April, 2025
„4. The following factors must be etched on the mental screen:
(1) A reference under Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act is not an appeal against
the award and the court cannot take into account the material relied upon by the
Land Acquisition Officer in his award unless the same material is produced and
proved before the court.
(2) So also the award of the Land Acquisition Officer is not to be treated as a
judgment of the trial court open or exposed to challenge before the court hearing the
reference. It is merely an offer made by the Land Acquisition Officer and the material
utilised by him for making his valuation cannot be utilised by the court unless
produced and proved before it. It is not the function of the court to sit in appeal
against the award, approve or disapprove its reasoning, or correct its error or affirm,
modify or reverse the conclusion reached by the Land Acquisition Officer, as if it were
an appellate court.
(3) The court has to treat the reference as an original proceeding before it and
determine the market value afresh on the basis of the material produced before it.
(4) The claimant is in the position of a plaintiff who has to show that the price offered
for his land in the award is inadequate on the basis of the materials produced in the
court. Of course the materials placed and proved by the other side can also be taken
into account for this purpose.
(5) The market value of land under acquisition has to be determined as on the crucial
date of publication of the notification under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act
(dates of notifications under Sections 6 and 9 are irrelevant).
(6) The determination has to be made standing on the date line of valuation (date of
publication of notification under Section 4) as if the valuer is a hypothetical
purchaser willing to purchase land from the open market and is prepared to pay a
reasonable price as on that day. It has also to be assumed that the vendor is willing to
sell the land at a reasonable price.
(7) In doing so by the instances method, the court has to correlate the market value
reflected in the most comparable instance, which provides the index of market value.
(8) Only genuine instances have to be taken into account. (Sometimes instances are
rigged up in anticipation of acquisition of land.) (9) Even post-notification instances
can be taken into account (1) if they are very proximate, (2) genuine, and (3) the
acquisition itself has not motivated the purchaser to pay a higher price on account of
the resultant improvement in development prospects.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127276276/ 24
Dibakar Biswal vs Special Land Acquisition Officer on 21 April, 2025
(10) The most comparable instances out of the genuine instances have to be
identified on the following considerations:
(i) proximity from time angle,
(ii) proximity from situation angle.
(11) Having identified the instances which provide the index of market value, the
price reflected therein may be taken as the norm and the market value of the land
under acquisition may be deduced by making suitable adjustments for the plus and
minus factors vis-à-vis land under acquisition by placing the two in juxtaposition.
(12) A balance sheet of plus and minus factors may be drawn for this purpose and the
relevant factors may be evaluated in terms of price variation as a prudent purchaser
would do.
(13) The market value of the land under acquisition has thereafter to be deduced by
loading the price reflected in the instance taken as norm for plus factors and
unloading it for minus factors.
(14) The exercise indicated in clauses (11) to (13) has to be undertaken in a common
sense manner, as a prudent man of the world of business would do. We may illustrate
some such illustrative (not exhaustive) factors:
Plus factor Minus factor 1 Smallnss of size 1. Largeness of size 2 Proximity to a road 2.
Situation in the interior at a distance from the road 3 Frontage on a road 3 Narrow
strip of land with very small frontage compared to depth 4 Nearness to developed 4
Lower level requiring the area depressed portion to be filled up 5 Regular shape 5
Remoteness from developed locality 6 Level vis-à-vis land under 6 Some special
acquisition disadvantageous factor which would deter a purchaser 7 Special value for
an owner of an adjoining property to whom it may have some very special advantage
(15) The evaluation of these factors of course depends on the facts of each case. There
cannot be any hard-
and-fast or rigid rule. Common sense is the best and most reliable guide. For instance, take the
factor regarding the size. A building plot of land say 500 to 1000 sq yds cannot be compared with a
large tract or block of land of say 10,000 sq yds or more. Firstly while a smaller plot is within the
reach of many, a large block of land will have to be developed by preparing a lay out, carving out
roads, leaving open space, plotting out smaller plots, waiting for purchasers (meanwhile the
invested money will be blocked up) and the hazards of an entrepreneur. The factor can be
discounted by making a deduction by way of an allowance at an appropriate rate ranging
approximately between 20% to 50% to account for land required to be set apart for carving out lands
and plotting out small plots. The discounting will to some extent also depend on whether it is a rural
area or urban area, whether building activity is picking up, and whether waiting period during which
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127276276/ 25
Dibakar Biswal vs Special Land Acquisition Officer on 21 April, 2025
the capital of the entrepreneur would be locked up, will be longer or shorter and the attendant
hazards.
(16) Every case must be dealt with on its own fact pattern bearing in mind all these factors as a
prudent purchaser of land in which position the Judge must place himself.
(17) These are general guidelines to be applied with understanding informed with common sense.(cid:129)
***"
7.2. A reference to CESC Ltd. Vrs. Sandhya Rani Barik, (2008) 10 SCR 137, as has
been referred to in the referral judgment impugned herein, may be significant. In the
said case, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India laid down the approach of the Court
with regard to assessment of valuation as follows:
"16. The armchair assessment of land value has to proceed with common sense and
circumspection. One should attempt to find out the just and reasonable
compensation without attempting any mathematical precision in that regard. For the
purpose of assessing compensation, the efforts should be to find out the price fixed
for the similar land in the vicinity.
17. The difference in the land acquired and the land sold might take on various
aspects. One plot of land might be larger, another small, one plot of land might have a
large frontage and another might have none. There might be difference in land
development and location. There might be special features which have to be taken
note of and reasonably considered in the matter of assessing compensation.
18. Where a very large plot of land has been acquired and the comparison is sought to
be made with a comparatively small piece of land which has been sold or otherwise
dealt with, then in that event, a percentage of the price is to be knocked off because of
the largeness itself of the acquired land. Accordingly, the High Court made the
deductions. The High Court also dealt with the question of land locking and held that
it was a special feature which had to be taken note of."
7.3. This Court takes note of following discussion in the case of Ravinder Kumar Goel Vrs. State of
Haryana, (2023) 3 SCR 912:
„9. *** From the records, it is pointed out that as contended on behalf of the parties,
the sale exemplars were brought on record to aid the Court to determine the market
value, the consideration of which was required to be made to arrive at an appropriate
market value.
10. While adverting to this aspect of the matter what is necessary to be noted is that
the Reference Court before appreciating the evidence, has kept in view the
parameters laid down by this Court while considering a reference for the purpose of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127276276/ 26
Dibakar Biswal vs Special Land Acquisition Officer on 21 April, 2025
determining the market value of the acquired lands to arrive at the just
compensation. Since the sale exemplars had been placed by the rival parties before
the Reference Court, in order to take the same into consideration, the Reference
Court has in fact taken note of the decision of this Court in State of Gujarat Vrs.
Kakhot SinghJi VajesinghJi Vaghela, (1968) 3 SCR 692. This Court had enunciated
the principle that the price agreed between a willing seller and a willing purchaser
would be the price which is generally prevailing in the market in respect of the lands
having similar advantages which can be the basis to determine the market value of
acquired lands if such sale instances are brought on record.
11. Further, the Reference Court had also kept in view the decision of this Court in
Atma Singh (Dead) through Lrs. and Ors. Vrs. State of Haryana and Anr., (2008) 2
SCC 568 wherein it is held that the sale instances of small pieces of land cannot be
ignored while determining the compensation for a large extent of land acquired. The
rule of deduction on development charges would not be uniformly applicable was
also taken into consideration. It is in that light, the Reference Court has placed
reliance on the document at Ex.PX dated 07.12.2004 relied upon by the land losers.
Under the said document, an extent of 5 Marlas was sold in Sultanpur i.e. the area which is the
subject matter of these appeals, for the sale consideration of Rs.1,05,000/- which would amount to
Rs.33,60,000/- per acre. On reckoning the said value of land, the Reference Court deducted 35 per
cent of the same towards development charges and thereafter added the escalation for 35 days being
the difference of the period between the date of the said sale deed and the date of the preliminary
notification. It is on the said basis that the market value of Rs. 22,00,754/- per acre was arrived at
by the Reference Court. 12. From the judgment of the Reference Court it is noted that the sale
exemplars which were relied upon by the respondent-HSIIDC at Ex.R5/R12, Ex.R6, Ex.R9, Ex.R13
to Ex.R16 were discarded since they depict the market value of the land which is lower than the
amount awarded by the Collector. To that extent, the reason assigned by the Reference Court is not
justified. The documents would have to be taken into consideration, to decide as to whether the
lands are comparable and, on the determination, if the conclusion is that they are comparable but
the market value depicted is lesser than what is awarded by the SLAO and if there is no other
document to indicate a higher market value, it would be open for the Reference Court to confirm the
award of the LAO being more beneficial to the land losers.
13. Therefore, since we have already indicated that the High Court was not justified in merely relying
on the circular fixing the floor rates when other evidence was available on the record pursuant to the
remand made, it is necessary for us to take note as to whether the Reference Court had committed
an error in not relying on the sale exemplars produced by the respondents without analysing the
comparability. The position of law is well settled that when large extent of lands are acquired and if
the sale exemplar, also for the large extent is available on record it would be safer to rely on the
same if they are comparable transactions. However, as already noted above, this Court in Atma
Singh (supra) has also held that the sale instances of smaller extents cannot be ignored. Further, this
Court has reiterated in many cases that the sale exemplars for smaller extent can be relied upon
subject to appropriate deduction being provided towards development charges.

Dibakar Biswal vs Special Land Acquisition Officer on 21 April, 2025
14. In the instant case, though the acquisition Notification dated 11.01.2005 was issued in respect of
the large extent of lands measuring 798 Kanals and 2 Marlas, the extent of lands which were owned
by majority of land losers is a small extent. In fact, the details indicated in the judgment dated
10.01.2020 passed by the Reference Court has referred to about 69 appellants who were before it.
Therefore, the extent to which each of the appellants is claiming compensation is a smaller extent.
In that background, if the documents relied on by the respondents at Ex.R5 to R16 are noted, the
largest extent sold is under Ex.R16 being 32 Kanals and 16 Marlas, while the least being under
Ex.R8 measuring 3 Kanals and 8 Marlas. We have referred to this aspect of the matter to indicate
that while approving the procedure for placing reliance on the sale deeds of earlier sale transactions
as exemplars, this Court starting from the case of Kakhot SinghJi Vajesinghji Vaghela (supra) and
several other cases has emphasized that the basis for the same is that the value under such
exemplars would represent the sale consideration agreed upon between a willing seller and a willing
purchaser and therefore would represent the true market value.
15. If the above-referred concept is kept in perspective, one cannot loose sight of the fact that when
large extent of agricultural land is sold under a document and if the land is to be used for
agricultural purpose, the price agreed thereto would be based on the nature of the land and the
purpose for which it is put to use. In cases, where the large extent of agricultural land belonging to a
single owner is acquired, it would no doubt be safe to rely on such sale exemplars of large extents,
more particularly, in circumstances where the land which is classified as agricultural land is also
used for agricultural purposes. In such circumstances, to arrive at the market value depending on
the nature of the cultivation, the capitalisation method by applying the multiplier to the crop pattern
and price derived can be adopted and the market value be determined or determine the market
value based on such sale deeds which are comparable exemplars.
16. However, the difficulty arises when a person holds a smaller extent of land which is classified as
agricultural land but would have lost its character due to non-cultivation and urbanization when
such land is more eminent and fit to be used for non- agricultural purposes. It is in that
circumstance, such land though classified as agricultural will have to be treated as a land having
non-agricultural potential more particularly for urban use. In that light, in appropriate cases
depending on the location and the extent of land held by each of the land losers who is a part of the
same acquisition, is required to be kept in view, while applying the yardstick to reckon the
appropriate exemplar and arrive at the ultimate conclusion. Therefore, there can be no strait jacket
formula that when the sale deeds for the sale of large extent are available and large extent of lands
are acquired that alone should be reckoned as the exemplar. What is material is its comparability,
which would depend on case to case basis and that is for the Court to analyze based on the evidence
available on record."
7.4. In absence of any material placed by the Appellants herein with respect to comparability of
subject-lands with the lands under discussion before this Court as found place in the Judgment
dated 21.03.2023 passed in Golakha Bihari Das Vrs. Special Land Acquisition Officer, LAA No.57 of
2015 [challenging the Order dated 30.06.2015 passed in LA Misc. Case No.130 of 2014 by the
learned Civil Judge, Senior Division, Kamakhyanagar], mere reliance on copy of a "map" as
additional evidence without support of a petition under Order XLI, Rule 27 of the Code of Civil
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127276276/ 28
Dibakar Biswal vs Special Land Acquisition Officer on 21 April, 2025
Procedure, 1908, cannot allude to be an evidence in favour of the Appellants by holding that the
lands in both the cases have passed the tests laid down in catena of decisions of Courts. Given the
circumstances, it is imperfect to accept the argument presented by the learned counsel for the
Appellants that the lands in question should be valued at the market rate of Rs.56,41,905/- per acre,
as they are located near the lands mentioned in land acquisition appeal [LAA No. 57 of 2015], where
the market price was established at Rs.56,41,905/- per acre. Without discharging burden of proof to
justify such an argument advanced on behalf of the Appellants, it is not prudent to jump to the
conclusion that since market price of the subject-lands in LAA No. 57 of 2015 was established at
Rs.56,41,905/- per acre, the lands in its proximity should also be valued at par. Therefore, it
requires further investigation into the nature of land by applying the tests and parameters
emanating from various judgments to assess the market price of the lands for arriving at apt
conclusion.
Conclusion:
8. On perusal of the Order dated 07.04.2018 passed in LA Misc. Case No.112 of 2014
by the learned Senior Civil Judge, Kamakhyanagar, it is perceived that determination
of market value was made at Rs.39,10,100/- taking note of the fact that the
Appellants have not filed sale deeds pertaining to agricultural lands
contemporaneous to the acquisition and the argument of Additional Government
Pleader that no document has been filed from the side of the petitioners that the
acquired land situates in close vicinity of the properties thus alienated".
8.1. The Appellants sought to place reliance on a "map", which did not form part of
the Record of the Reference Court, showing that the subject-plot is situated nearby/
adjacent to the lands under discussion in LAA No.57 of 2015 before this Court with
respect to Notification dated 25.07.2011 issued under Section 4(1) of the LA Act. This
Court cannot be oblivious of ruling that "to rely upon judgment/award in case it does
not form part of evidence recorded by the Reference Court, an application under
Order XLI, Rule 27 is to be filed to adduce evidence and if it is allowed, opposite
party has to be given opportunity to lead evidence in rebuttal", as found in Manoj
Kumar Vrs. State of Haryana, (2018) 13 SCC 96.
8.2. The view expressed by Supreme Court of India in Basayya I. Mathad Vrs.
Rudrayya S. Mathad, (2008) 1 SCR 1155 is noteworthy:
"It is clear that parties to the tis are not entitled to produce additional evidence as of
course or routine but must satisfy the conditions stated in sub-clauses (a) & (aa).
Admittedly, such recourse has not been resorted to neither by the party concerned
nor adhered those principles by the High Court. Paragraph 3 of his order shows that
the learned Judge verified the document produced on his direction without
complying the mandate as provided under Rule 27 of Order XLI. Hence, we are of the
view that the finding of the learned Judge based on a document produced at the time
of argument de hors to Rule 27 referred above cannot be sustained in the eye of law.

Dibakar Biswal vs Special Land Acquisition Officer on 21 April, 2025
In such circumstances, his ultimate conclusion treating the suit property as a family
property partible among the members of the family is also liable to be set aside. In
fact, sub-clause (2) of Rule 27 mandates that wherever additional evidence is allowed
to be produced by an Appellate Court, it shall record the reason for its admission. It is
needless to mention that the High Court neither followed those conditions for
production of additional evidence nor recorded the reason for basing reliance on the
same."
8.3. A Constitution Bench of Supreme Court in K. Venkataramiah Vrs. A. Seetharama Reddy, (1964)
2 SCR 35, held:
"It is very much to be desired that the courts of appeal should not overlook the
provisions of cl. (2) of the Rule and should record their reasons for admitting
additional evidence. We are not prepared, however, to accept the contention of the
appellant that the omission to record the reason vitiates the admission of the
evidence. Clearly, the object of the provision is to keep a clear record of what weighed
with the appellate court in allowing the additional evidence to be produced-- whether
this was done on the ground:
(i) that the court appealed from had refused to admit evidence which ought to have
been admitted, or
(ii) it allowed it because it required it to enable it to pronounce judgment in the
appeal or
(iii) it allowed this for any other substantial cause.
Where a further appeal lies from the decision of the appellate court such recording of the reasons is
necessary and useful also to the court of further appeal for deciding whether the discretion under
the rule has been judicially exercised by the court below. The omission to record the reason must
therefore be treated as a serious defect. Even so, we are unable to persuade ourselves that this
provision is mandatory. For, it does not seem reasonable to think that the legislature intended that
even though in the circumstances of a particular case it could be definitely ascertained from the
record why the appellate court allowed additional evidence and it is clear that the power was
properly exercised within the limitation imposed by the first clause of the Rule all that should be set
at naught merely because the provision in the second clause was not complied with. It may be
mentioned that as early as 1885 when considering a similar provision in the corresponding Section
of the Code of 1882, viz., Section 586, the High Court of Calcutta held that this provision for
recording reasons is merely directory and not imperative vide Gopal Singh Vrs. Jhakri Rai, (1866) 11
M.I.A. 28. We are aware of no case in which the correctness of this view has been doubted. It is
worth noticing that when the 1908 Code was framed and Order XLI Rule 27 took the place of the old
Section 568, the legislature was content to leave the provision as it was and did not think it
necessary to say anything to make the requirement of recording reasons imperative. It is true that
the word "shall" is used in Rule 27(2); but that by itself does not make it mandatory. We are
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/127276276/ 30
Dibakar Biswal vs Special Land Acquisition Officer on 21 April, 2025
therefore of opinion that the omission of the High Court to record reasons for allowing additional
evidence does not vitiate such admission."
8.4. Be that be, this Court passed Judgment in LAA No.57 of 2015 on 21.03.2023 which is
pronounced later to the judgment of the Reference Court assailed in the present appeal. The learned
Senior Civil Judge had no occasion for having regard to said Judgment at the relevant point of time.
The "map" sought to be adduced before this Court as evidence was not before the Reference Court.
Since the "map" showing the lands, as relied on by the counsel for the Appellants during course of
argument, are stated to be situated adjacent to or nearby the lands that are considered in said
referred land acquisition appeal by this Court, the learned Senior Civil Judge- Reference Court is
required to re-determine the market price of the land in question taking into consideration the
discussions made hereinabove. The Reference Court is at liberty to reconsider the evidence on
record and that may be sought to be adduced by the parties and re- determine the market value for
the purpose of quantifying the compensation amount.
9. Ergo, the Order dated 07.04.2018 passed in LA Misc.
Case No.112 of 2014 by the learned Senior Civil Judge, Kamakhyanagar is hereby set aside. The
matter is remitted to the said Court for re-determining the market price of land in question, i.e., Plot
No.1937, Khata No.240, mouza: Kamakhyanagar in the district of Dhenkanal comprising an area of
Ac.0.22dec. acquired by the Special Land Acquisition Officer, Angul-Duburi- Sukinda Road New
B.G. Rail Link Project under Section 4(1) of the LA Act vide Notification No.31513, dated 25.07.2011
[published in Odisha Gazette No.1808, dated 05.08.2011] in the light of the aforesaid referred cases
keeping in view principles enunciated and propounded in the pronouncements discussed above.
Needless to clarify that this Court does not disturb the market price as has already been determined
in the Order dated 07.04.2018 of the Senior Civil Judge, but this order of remit is confined to
examination/redetermination of market price for the purpose of considering enhancement of
amount of compensation as claimed in the present appeal.
10. In consequence of aforesaid discussions and observations, the Land Acquisition Appeal stand
disposed of and all pending interlocutory applications, if any, shall stand disposed of. In the
circumstances, the parties are to bear their respective costs.
