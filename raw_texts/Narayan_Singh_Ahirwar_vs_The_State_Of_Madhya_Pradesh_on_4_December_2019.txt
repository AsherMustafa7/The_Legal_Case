Heard finally.
By this common order, WP Nos.20167/2017, 20632/2017(s),
20636/2017(s), 21306/2017(s), 21374/2017(s), 21438/2017(s), 22098/2017(s),
22121/2017(s), 22598/2017(s), 22846/2017(s), 23456/2017(s), 1191/2018(s),
3458/2018(s), 4043/2018(s), 5104/2018(s), 6001/2018(s) shall also be decided.
For the sake of convenience, the facts of W.P. No.19762 of 2017(s) shall
be taken into consideration.
During the pendency of this petition, the petitioners No.1 to 18, 20 to 23,
25, 27 to 42 have withdrawn the petition.
This petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India has been filed
challenging the orders dated 7-7-2017 and 22-8-2017 passed by respondents no.
3 and 2 respectively by which the earlier order dated 15-10-2016 has been cancelled.
The necessary facts for disposal of the present petition in short are that the Petitioners were
appointed on the post of Shiksha Karmi as per the provisions of M.P. Panchayat Shiksha Karmi
(Bharti Tatha Sewa Ki Sharten) Niyam, 1997 (In short ''Rules, 1997'') and were posted in different
schools. A decision was taken by the State Govt. to create a new cadre of Adhyapak and the
petitioners were absorbed on the post of Adhyapak under M.P. Panchayat Adhyapak Samvarg
(Employment and condition of Service) Rules, 2008 (In short ''Rules 2008'') and were posted in the
same school. It is further pleaded that by circular dated 21-2- 2013, the pay scale of the petitioners
were revised and they were also given the advantage of Krammonnati and Promotion. Thereafter,
again by circular dated 4- 9-2013, a decision was taken to grant the pay scale equal to the teacher
cadre which was being granted in the Govt. School. Thereafter a decision was taken to extend the
benefit of recommendation of 6 th pay commission to the Adhyapak Cadre and accordingly circular
dated 25-2-2016 was issued. Thereafter, a circular dated 31-5-2016 was issued wherein it was
mentioned that the pay scale shall granted on the basis of the present pay scale which is allowed to
Adhyapak Cadre. Thereafter, a letter was issued and the circular dated 31-5-2016 was kept in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/4110777/ 2
Narayan Singh Ahirwar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 4 December, 2019
abeyance. Thereafter, new circular dated 15-10-2016 was issued, for granting the pay scale provided
on the basis of the existing pay scale. Thereafter, under an impression that there is an anomaly in
the circular dated 15-10-2016, therefore, order dated 7-7-2017 has been issued for grant of benefits
of recommendation of 6th pay commission on the basis of the period put in the cadre of Adhyapak
and not on the basis of existing pay scales. Again, an order has been issued on 22-8- 2017, making a
clarification to the circular dated 7-7-2017, mentioning that the directions issued in respect of
promotion and Krammonnati would be applicable only after 1-1-2016. Again another circular dated
21-12-2017 has been issued, thereby clarifying the circulars dated 7-7-2017 and 22-8-2017.
Challenging the circulars dated 7-7-2017, 22-8-2017 and 29-12-2017, it is submitted by the Counsel
for the petitioners that initially the petitioners were appointed as Shiksha Karmi and thereafter, they
were absorbed in the Adhyapak Cadre, and therefore, the benefit of 6th Pay Commission should
have been given on the existing pay scale and not on the basis of the period of service rendered by
them in Adhyapak Cadre. It is submitted that by order dated 30-6-2017, it was also directed by the
School Education Department, that the services of the Shiksha Karmies after their absorption in the
cadre of Adhyapak shall deemed to be in continuity. Therefore, the services rendered by the
petitioner as Shiksha Karmi should be into consideration for the purposes of grant of benefit of
recommendation of 6th pay commission.
Per contra, it is submitted by the Counsel for the State that as per Rules, 2008, the services rendered
by the Petitioner on the post of Shiksha Karmi cannot be taken into consideration for the purposes
of their salary and it is further submitted that the cut off date is the executive function of the State
based on several factors like economic conditions, financial constraints, administrative and other
circumstances therefore, unless and until the said cut off date leads to some blatantly capricious or
outrageous result, the same cannot be quashed. To buttress his contentions, the Counsel for the
State has relied upon the judgments passed by the Supreme Court in the case of Govt. of Andhra
Pradesh and others Vs. N.Subbarayudu and others reported in (2008)14 SCC 702 and Council of
Scientific and Industrial Research and others Vs. Ramesh Chandra Agrawal and another reported in
(2009) 3 SCC 35.
Heard the learned Counsel for the parties.
Note appended to Schedule IV of Rules, 2008 ( under Rule 2(b) and 4) reads as under :
''Note : After merging the Shiksha Karmies in Adhyapak Samvarg, the services
rendered by them as Shiksha Karmi shall be calculated for purpose of Promotion/
Karmonnati seniority only.'' Thus, it is clear that the services rendered by the
petitioners as Shiksha Karmi can be calculated for the purpose of
Promotion/Karmonnati seniority only. Thus, it is clear that the past services of the
petitioners, which they had rendered as Shikshakarmi is not to be taken into
consideration for the purposes of fixation of pay.
The petitioners have filed the copy of their appointment order on the post of Shiksha
Karmi. It is clear that they were appointed on the said post for a period of three years
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/4110777/ 3
Narayan Singh Ahirwar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 4 December, 2019
and their services were liable to be extended by further period of three years, after
assessment of their work. Thus, it is clear that the petitioners were not appointed on
the post of Shiksha Karmi on regular basis.
Therefore, this Court is of the considered opinion, that no fault can be found in the
order dated 7-7-2017, by which it was directed that the recommendations of the 6th
Pay Commission shall be payable on the basis of the period of service put in by the
employee in the cadre of Adhyapak.
However, by order dated 7-7-2017, it has also been directed that the excess amount
paid to the employees shall be recovered/adjusted. This Court is of the considered
opinion, that if a wrong fixation of salary was done by the respondents, then the
petitioners are not responsible for the same as incorrect order dated 15-10-2016 was
issued by the respondents themselves. Therefore, it is directed that if any excess
amount has been paid to the petitioners (who have not withdrawn their petition),
then the same shall not be recovered.
With aforesaid direction, the writ petition is finally disposed of. In view of the above,
