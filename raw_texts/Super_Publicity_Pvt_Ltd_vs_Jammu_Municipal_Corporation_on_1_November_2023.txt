JUDGMENT
[N. Kotiswar Singh, CJ]
01. Heard Mr. Aditya Grover, learned counsel for the petitioner as also Mr. Rajnish Raina, learned
counsel appearing for the respondents.
02. The instant petition has been filed by the petitioner under Section 11(6) of Jammu and Kashmir
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1997 for the appointment of an arbitrator to resolve the dispute
that has arisen between the parties. After the enactment and enforcement of the Jammu and
Kashmir Re-organization Act, 2019, the aforesaid Act has been repealed and the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short, the Act of 1996) has become applicable and accordingly, the
present application is being considered under the aforesaid Act of 1996.

03. It is the case of the petitioner that petitioner's company is engaged in the business of outdoor
advertisement and the respondent-Jammu Municipal Corporation had awarded a contract of
advertising in the area of respondent-corporation, in connection with which, an agreement was
executed on 10.11.2012 between the parties, whereunder the respondent- corporation was to provide
21000 Sq. ft. area to the petitioner for display of advertisement, each year, for a period of four (4)
years, in connection whereof, the respondent directed the petitioner to deposit a sum of
Rs.98,00,426/- as license fee for the 4th year, failing to pay the same, the petitioner was warned
vide letter dated 23.02.2016 that the advertisement structures installed by the petitioner would be
removed.
04. Being aggrieved by such a demand of the respondent-corporation, the petitioner challenged the
said act by preferring a writ petition being OWP No.362 of 2016 along-with MP No.01/2016, and
in-terms of an interim order passed by the Writ Court on 14.03.2016, the petitioner deposited an
amount of Rs.89,00,426/- before the Registrar (Judicial) of this Court, which was wrongly recorded
as Rs.98,00,426/- in the notice issued by the respondent-corporation, on payment of which, the
Court directed that the operation of the impugned communication dated 23.02.2016 issued by
respondent No.2 shall remain in abeyance by which the respondent- corporation had threatened to
remove the advertising structures.
05. According to the petitioner, in spite of deposit of aforesaid amount Rs.89,00,426/- in terms of
order dated 14.03.2016 passed by the Writ Court, the respondent authorities removed and
demolished the advertising structures erected by the petitioner on the sites allocated in terms of
Page |3 agreement between the parties. The said petition, however, was dismissed for default on
account of failure of the counsel for the petitioner to be present in the Court, which led to the filing
of an appeal being registered as LPAOW No.17/2018. In the said LPAOW No.17/2018, the Division
Bench on 09-03-2018 passed the order to the effect that in the meantime, the amount which had
earlier been deposited by the petitioner before the Registrar (Judicial) of this Court pursuant to the
order dated 19.02.2018 passed by the learned Single Bench shall be kept separately and available to
await further directions of the Court. Subsequently, the said appeal was disposed of with the
following directions on 07.12.2018: -
"i. The challenge to order dated 19th February, 2018 passed in OWP No.362/2016 is
hereby dismissed.
ii. It shall be open to the appellant to invoke such remedy as provided under the
Jammu and Kashmir Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1997 for reference of the
disputes to the arbitration.
iii. Interim order dated 9th March, 2018 shall continue for a period of three moths
from today.

Super Publicity Pvt. Ltd vs Jammu Municipal Corporation on 1 November, 2023
iv. So far as the payment of interest on the amount, if any, payable to the appellant is
concerned, the same shall abide by directions in this regard in the award which may
be passed in arbitration proceedings, if any.
v. It shall be open to the appellant to seek revival of contempt proceedings and/or
perjury proceedings, which have been disposed of vide order dated 19th February,
2018. In case application(s) in this regard is/are made, the same shall be considered
by the learned Single Judge Page |4 in accordance with law.
vi. Nothing herein contained shall be considered an expression of opinion on the
merits of the rival contentions."
06. The basic grievance of the petitioner is that though it was agreed between the parties that the
respondent-corporation was to provide 21000 Sq. ft to the petitioner for a period of four (4) years,
the respondent was yet to provide the entire area for display of advertisement for the period
03.12.2012 to 02.12.2016 while demanding the license fee for the 4th last year of the contract, which
was duly deposited by the petitioner with the Registry in terms of the interim order passed by the
Writ Court on 14.03.2016. However, in spite of directions of the Writ Court not to act upon the
notice of respondent corporation dated 23.02.2016 for removal of the hoardings of the petitioner by
order dated 14.03.2016 passed by the Writ Court, the respondent-corporation removed the same
and as such a dispute had arisen between the parties. As a consequence thereof, the petitioner filed
an application under Section 9 of the Jammu and Kashmir Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1997,
before the 2nd Additional District Judge, J&K, Jammu seeking interim protection of the amount
deposited by the petitioner and the learned 2nd Additional District Judge, J&K, Jammu was pleased
to pass an order to the effect that the respondent- corporation shall not utilize the amount of
Rs.89,00,426/- deposited by the petitioner till next date of hearing.
07. It has been submitted at the Bar that the contract agreement entered into between the parties
10.11.2012 contains an Arbitration Clause which Page |5 provides for arbitration to the effect that "in
the event of dispute relation to the interpretation of rights and liabilities arising out of this
agreement, the same shall, at first instance, be amicably settled between the parties. If any dispute is
not settled amicably, the same shall be referred to the sole arbitrator i.e., the Commissioner,
Municipal Corporation, Jammu who shall conduct the proceedings in accordance with the
provisions of the J&K Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1997 and the rules made there under. The
award given by the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties".
08. It has been submitted that all the attempts/endeavors of the petitioner to get the matter settled
amicably yielded no results. In fact, the respondent authorities have constantly opposed all the
claims made by the petitioner, and since, in terms of the amendment in the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996, under Section 12 (5) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, an
employee of the respondent-Corporation cannot act as an arbitrator, it has to be an independent
arbitrator to be appointed by this Court.

Super Publicity Pvt. Ltd vs Jammu Municipal Corporation on 1 November, 2023
09. This application, however, has been resisted by the respondents, primarily on the ground, that
the claim is time barred and as such, no arbitration would lie to settle the dispute.
10. It has been submitted on behalf of Mr. Rajnish Raina, learned counsel appearing for the
respondents that the letter of demand dated 07.12.2015 was issued by the respondent corporation to
the petitioner to provide all the details of the disputed sites so that the matter could be resolved at
the earliest but was never responded to by the petitioner. In fact, if the Page |6 petitioner felt that
such demand of the respondent-corporation through their letter dated 07.12.2015 was considered
not be in accordance with the agreement, the petitioner could have challenged the same which he
did not do. Subsequently, another letter was issued by the respondent- corporation on 23.02.2016
directing the petitioner to deposit a sum of Rs.98,00,426/- as license fee for the 4th year which he
failed to deposit in time relating to payment of interest of 10% with the warning that in failing to pay
the said amount with interest, the structures installed by the petitioner shall be removed at his own
risk and cost.
11. According to the respondents, the petitioner has filed this present petition for appointment of an
arbitrator on 22.03.2019 which is clearly time barred, inasmuch as, the cause of action arose when
the letter was issued on 07.12.2015 directing the petitioner to provide the complete details of the
disputed sites so that the dispute can be resolved at the earliest and certainly, after the demand
notice was issued on 23.02.2016 directing the petitioner to deposit an amount of Rs.98,00,426/-
failing which, the respondents threatened to remove the structures installed by the petitioner. The
limitation period of three (3) years thus would lapse on 22.02.2019. However, the application was
filed only on 22.03.2019. As such, the same is time barred.
In this regard learned counsel for the respondents has relied upon the following decisions in support
of his submission.
a. Grasim Industries Ltd. Versus State of Kerala, (2018) 14 SCC 265.
b. Commissioner M.P.Housing Board and others Versus M/s. Mohanlal and Company AIR 2016 SC
Page |7 3592.
12. It has been also submitted that the Writ Petition, bearing OWP No.362/2016 and other related
connected matters were disposed of with the observation that since the contract contains an
arbitration clause, the petitioner has an alternative efficacious remedy and accordingly, did not
entertain the writ petition. However, the said order was challenged by the petitioner before the
Division Bench in LPAOW No.17/2018 by contending that in spite of a valid alternative efficacious
remedy available there is no bar on the maintainability of the writ petition.
13. It has been further submitted by the respondents that no notice was given by the petitioner
before invoking the Arbitration Clause.
14. Mr. Aditya Grover, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner however, submits that as regards
the issue of limitation, it has been submitted that the contract was to be in force for a period of 4
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/113606270/ 4
Super Publicity Pvt. Ltd vs Jammu Municipal Corporation on 1 November, 2023
years with effect from 03.12.2012 and thus, would lapse on 02.12.2016. The contract was valid from
03.12.2012 to 02.12.2016. If that is so, the period of limitation will lapse only on 02.12.2019 i.e., 3
(three) years after the last valid date of contract and the petitioner had filed the petition in March
2019. Accordingly, it has been submitted that since the limitation will be counted from the date of
expiry of the agreement i.e., 01.12.2019, the petition is within time. This submission, however, is
contested by Mr. Rajnish Raina, learned counsel for the respondent- corporation contending that is
what is relevant is the actual accrual of the cause of action, and the cause of action arose on
07.12.2015 when the letter was issued by the respondent-corporation asking the petitioner Page |8
to provide the complete details of disputes sites so that the matter can be resolved at an earliest.
15. As regards the issue of requirement of notice to be served under Section 11(4) of the Jammu and
Kashmir Arbitration Act, 1977, which is similar to Section 11(4) of the Arbitration and Conciliation
Act, 1996, before invoking to arbitration clause, Mr. Grover, learned counsel for the petitioner
submits that no such notice will be required since both the parties were heard in writ proceedings in
OWP No.236/2016 as well as in the connected LPAOW No.17/2018 and in fact the Division Bench in
LPA had ordered that it shall be open to the petitioner to invoke the remedy under Jammu and
Kashmir Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1977 for reference of the dispute to arbitration and since
all the parties were heard, issuing of any notice would be a futile exercise as there was full throttled
contestation where the respondent had shown no desire to settle the dispute amicably.
16. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the material on record.
17. From the above, it is evident that application for appointment of arbitrator has been contested by
the respondents on two counts, firstly, on limitation and secondly that no notice was issued for
invoking the arbitration clause.
18. As regards the issue of limitation, though the dispute appears to have arisen after the
respondent-corporation issued the demand notice on 07.12.2015 seeking details of the disputed sites
as well as from the letter dated 23.02.2016 directing petitioner to deposit the license fee, Page |9 the
fact remains that the dispute arose after the contract was executed on 10.11.2012. In terms of
aforesaid agreement, it has been provided in para 1 that the contract shall be in force for a period of
04 years with effect from 03.12.2012 including the grace period of 21 days for erection of hoarding
structures for the period of 4 years provided the Annual License Fee for the 1st year is deposited on
or before 03.12.2012 and for the subsequent three years of contract is deposited at least two months
prior to the commencement of the contract of that particular year. Thus, it appears that the validity
of contract will be with effect from 03.12.2012 to 02.12.2016. Though it also appears that the dispute
arose relating to the payment of license fees, yet it would not detract from the fact that the dispute
arose relating to the license fees for the subsequent three years of contract. If the said license is paid,
the contract would be valid for another three years and hence the valid period would be upto
02.02.2019. Since the application was filed for appointment of arbitrator in March, 2019, it appears
that the application is not time barred.
19. The scope of the power of the High Court pertaining to appointment of arbitrator under the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 before its amendment in 2015 was considered in extenso by a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/113606270/ 5
Super Publicity Pvt. Ltd vs Jammu Municipal Corporation on 1 November, 2023
Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in SBP & Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd., (2005) 8 SCC
618. As regards the issue of limitation, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the aforesaid case observed
that the scope of examination by the Chief Justice while exercising the power under Section 11 of the
Act is a limited one though it includes deciding P a g e | 10 whether the claim was a dead one, or a
long-barred claim that was sought to be resurrected. It was observed that it may not be possible at
that referral stage, to decide whether a claim made is live one which comes within the purview of the
arbitration clause. In such a situation, it will be appropriate to leave that question to be decided by
the Arbitral Tribunal on taking evidence, along with the merits of the claims involved in the
arbitration. It was thus, held in the aforesaid case as follows:
"39. It is necessary to define what exactly the Chief Justice, approached with an
application under Section 11 of the Act, is to decide at that stage. Obviously, he has to
decide his own jurisdiction in the sense whether the party making the motion has
approached the right High Court. He has to decide whether there is an arbitration
agreement, as defined in the Act and whether the person who has made the request
before him, is a party to such an agreement. It is necessary to indicate that he can
also decide the question whether the claim was a dead one; or a long-barred claim
that was sought to be resurrected and whether the parties have concluded the
transaction by recording satisfaction of their mutual rights and obligations or by
receiving the final payment without objection. It may not be possible at that stage, to
decide whether a live claim made, is one which comes within the purview of the
arbitration clause. It will be appropriate to leave that question to be decided by the
Arbitral Tribunal on taking evidence, along with the merits of the claims involved in
the arbitration. The Chief Justice has to decide whether the applicant has satisfied
the conditions for appointing an arbitrator under Section 11(6) of the Act. For the
purpose of taking a decision on these aspects, the Chief Justice can either proceed on
the basis of affidavits and the documents produced or take such evidence or get such
evidence recorded, as may be necessary. We think that adoption of this procedure in
the context of the Act would best serve the purpose sought to be achieved by the Act
of expediting the process of arbitration, without too many approaches to the court at
various stages of the proceedings before the Arbitral Tribunal."
(emphasis added)
20. After the amendment of the Act in 2015 by the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act,
2015, significant changes were brought P a g e | 11 in the Act. The Hon'ble Supreme Court had the
occasion to deal with many aspects including arbitrability of disputes and requirement to weed out
stale claims in Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn., (2021) 2 SCC
1. As regards the issue relating to time barred claim and how the Court has to deal with such issue
while considering appointment of arbitrator under Section 11 of the Act, it was observed in Vidya
Drolia(supra) as follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/113606270/ 6
Super Publicity Pvt. Ltd vs Jammu Municipal Corporation on 1 November, 2023
"148. Section 43(1) of the Arbitration Act states that the Limitation Act, 1963 shall
apply to arbitrations as it applies to court proceedings. Sub-section (2) states that for
the purposes of the Arbitration Act and Limitation Act, arbitration shall be deemed to
have commenced on the date referred to in Section 21. Limitation law is procedural
and normally disputes, being factual, would be for the arbitrator to decide guided by
the facts found and the law applicable. The court at the referral stage can interfere
only when it is manifest that the claims are ex facie time-barred and dead, or there is
no subsisting dispute. All other cases should be referred to the Arbitral Tribunal for
decision on merits. Similar would be the position in case of disputed "no-claim
certificate" or defence on the plea of novation and "accord and satisfaction". As
observed in Premium Nafta Products Ltd.64, it is not to be expected that commercial
men while entering transactions inter se would knowingly create a system which
would require that the court should first decide whether the contract should be
rectified or avoided or rescinded, as the case may be, and then if the contract is held
to be valid, it would require the arbitrator to resolve the issues that have arisen.
64: Fili Shipping Co. Ltd. v. Premium Nafta Products Ltd., 2007 UKHL 40 :
2007 Bus LR 1719 (HL) (emphasis added)
21. What we can thus, understand is that "The court at the referral stage can interfere
only when it is manifest that the claims are ex facie time-barred and dead, or there is
no subsisting dispute. All other cases should be referred to the Arbitral Tribunal for
decision on merits".
22. The aforesaid observation is an echo of the observations made in SBP & Co. v.
Patel Engg. Ltd. (supra) wherein it was held that "It may not be P a g e | 12 possible at
that stage, to decide whether a live claim made, is one which comes within the
purview of the arbitration clause. It will be appropriate to leave that question to be
decided by the Arbitral Tribunal on taking evidence, along with the merits of the
claims involved in the arbitration."
23. What is discernible from the aforesaid observation is that unless the claim is
ex-facie time barred, or "hopelessly time barred" to quote the expression used in
Secunderabad Cantonment Board v. B. Ramachandraiah & Sons, (2021) 5 SCC 705,
the Court at the time exercising power under Section 11 of the Act for appointment of
arbitrator should desist from rejecting any application for appointment of an
arbitrator at the threshold unless
24. The word ex-facie has been defined in Black's Law Dictionary (Seventh Edition)
as "apparently, evidently, facially" and in legal parlance it means "on the face of it".
This means any matter which appears to be true or valid outwardly on its surface
which understanding, or appreciation may not involve undertaking any detail
analysis of the subject. A hopelessly time barred claim is obviously a claim which is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/113606270/ 7
Super Publicity Pvt. Ltd vs Jammu Municipal Corporation on 1 November, 2023
barred due to prolonged delay.
25. The inference that can be drawn from the aforesaid decisions in SBP & Co. v.
Patel Engg. Ltd.(supra) and Vidya Drolia(supra) is that if the claim cannot be
determined as ex-facie time barred, and if such conclusion of the claim being time
barred is to be arrived at after a detail discussion and appreciation of evidence, it
cannot be said to be ex-facie time barred, in which event, it should be left to the
arbitral tribunal to consider such an aspect. Further, if there is the slightest doubt
about the P a g e | 13 issue of arbitrability on account of the claim being time barred,
it should be left to the arbitrator to decide.
26. In this regard, it may be appropriate to reproduce the observations in BSNL v.
Nortel Networks (India) (supra) as follows:
"45. In a recent judgment delivered by a three-Judge Bench in Vidya Drolia v. Durga
Trading Corpn., on the scope of power under Sections 8 and 11, it has been held that
the Court must undertake a primary first review to weed out "manifestly ex facie
non-existent and invalid arbitration agreements, or non-arbitrable disputes". The
prima facie review at the reference stage is to cut the deadwood, where dismissal is
barefaced and pellucid, and when on the facts and law, the litigation must stop at the
first stage. Only when the Court is certain that no valid arbitration agreement exists,
or that the subject-matter is not arbitrable, that reference may be refused.
46. ...................................
47. It is only in the very limited category of cases, where there is not even a vestige of
doubt that the claim is ex facie time-barred, or that the dispute is non-arbitrable, that
the court may decline to make the reference. However, if there is even the slightest
doubt, the rule is to refer the disputes to arbitration, otherwise it would encroach
upon what is essentially a matter to be determined by the tribunal."
27. In my view the rationale behind such a view is simple, that is, if the Court while exercising
jurisdiction under Section 11 of the Act has to embark upon the task of ascertaining limitation period
by undertaking an elaborate exercise involving production of evidence and appreciating evidence,
the Court will be usurping the role of the arbitral tribunal as also observed by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the above referred case of BSNL v. Nortel Networks (India) (supra).
28. The irresistible conclusion is that only when the claim appears on the face of the record to be
hopelessly time barred without the Court requiring to undertake an exhaustive and elaborate
exercise, the Court P a g e | 14 can refuse to exercise jurisdiction under Section 11 of the Act, to weed
out such dead wood claims.
29. There is yet another related issue. Section 43 (1) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996
provides that the Limitation Act, 1963 shall apply to arbitrations as it applies to proceedings in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/113606270/ 8
Super Publicity Pvt. Ltd vs Jammu Municipal Corporation on 1 November, 2023
Court. If that is so, provisions of Section 5 of the Limitation Act will also certainly apply to
proceedings before the Court while exercising jurisdiction under Section 11 of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996, just as provisions of Section 137 of the Limitation Act apply, as held in the
above referred cases. If provisions of Section 5 of the Limitation Act apply, nothing prevents the
Court to condone delay in certain cases while exercising jurisdiction under Section 11 of the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act. But is the Court at the referral stage expected to exercise this
power under Section 5 of the Limitation Act to condone the delay in respect of any belated claim if
there are sufficient causes for condoning the same? In my view, the said course of action is not
contemplated in view of the decisions of the larger Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in SBP &
Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd.(supra) and Vidya Drolia(supra), that it would be more appropriate to leave
that question to be decided by the arbitral tribunal on taking evidence.
30. The upshot of this discussion is that the Court at the referral stage can reject the claim only
when it is manifestly, ex-facie and hopelessly time barred and not otherwise. There can be situations
where a belated claim could be entertained if the claimant is able to show sufficient causes for not
making the application within the limitation period as provided P a g e | 15 under Section 5 of the
Limitation Act, which should be examined by the arbitral tribunal and not by the Court at the
referral stage.
31. Coming to the other issue as to whether notice was required to be served by the petitioner as
required under Section 11 (4) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, this Court is of the view
that service of notice will be a mere formality inasmuch as, parties were already put to notice about
the dispute in the light of the various litigations pending before them relating to the dispute which
had arisen between the parties and also the stiff resistance by the respondent- corporation about the
claim of the petitioner in all the proceedings before the Court. Thus, the requirement of serving a
notice for settling the matter amicably between the parties would be merely an empty formality.
32. In view of the above, this Court is satisfied that it is a fit case where this Court may proceed to
appoint an arbitrator to resolve the dispute between the parties in connection with the contract in
question.
33. Accordingly, this Court appoints Hon'ble Mr. Justice A. M. Magray, (Retd. Chief Justice of
Jammu and Kashmir & Ladakh High Court) to act as an Arbitrator and to resolve the dispute which
has arisen between the parties. The parties shall be at liberty to raise all the preliminary objections
including the issue of limitation etc., which learned Arbitrator will decide in accordance with law.
The Arbitrator shall proceed with the matter in accordance with law after charging the prescribed
fees along with incidental expenses to be shared by the parties.
