ORDER
This Civil Revision Petition is filed challenging the judgment and decree of the learned Rent Control
Appellate Authority / VII Judge, Small Causes Court, Chennai, in R.C.A.No.103 of 2016.
2. The respondent is the landlord of the building consists of ground floor and first floor in Door
No.39, M.G.R.Road (Old No.22), Kalashetra Colony, Chennai - 600 090. The petitioner became
tenant in this premises for residential purpose on a monthly rent of Rs.25,000/-. The monthly rent
was revised from January 2013 at Rs.58,945/-, but the petitioner has been paying only the sum of
Rs.25,000/-. The total area of the plot measures 4335 sq.ft. The superstructure consists of ground
floor and first floor. The ground floor consists of the main building and rear quarter and the first
floor is located on the main building. The petitioner occupies the entire built up area, appurtenant
for residential purpose. The petition https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis premises faces southern
direction at MGR Salai. MG Road is just about 150 metres away from the petition premises.
3. This building is surrounded by Andhra Bank, HDFC Bank, SBI, Karnataka Bank, Surya Diabetics
and Research Centre, Santosh Hospital, Velankanni Church, Murugan Idli Shop, Velankanni
Community Hall, Chef Express, Elexir Vital Homeopathy Hospital, Illiots Beach, Ashtalakshmi
Temple, Hotels, Nandanam and Cascade, State Bank of Travancore, Spencers Super Market,
Reserve Bank Quarters, Reserve Bank Staff Quarters School, Kalashetra Dance School, Bus Stops
and other commercial establishments. The market value of the site, is less than Rs.1.5 crores per
ground.
4. The wall of the superstructure was constructed with 3 inches thick brick work in cement mortar
and plastered with cement. Partly vitrified tiling and black Cudappah slabs in ground floor and
mosaic flooring in first floor are provided. The doors, windows and ventilators are made of teak
wood. The clear roof height measures 10 ft. walls 41/2 inches https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis in
thickness. RCC roofing and small quantum of Mangalore tiled roofing, in both ground and first floor
exists. There is an inbuilt dog legged stair case within the superstructure used for vertical ascent.
The wall interiors are cem paint coated. The age of the building is 32-33 years. This is Type-I, Class
'A' structure with 1% depreciation per annum.
5. The basic amenities, such as, three phase electric supply, bore well and well water supplies are
available along with drainage connection to Corporation sewer facility. Schedule-I amenities
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/69967683/ 2
M/S.Seaeyes Stem Limited vs C.R.V.Joseph on 9 December, 2021
include, overhead water tanks, electric motor, excess appurtenant land, all round compound wall,
black cudappah stone, mosaic and vitrified tile floor areas, glazed walling in toilets and 2 geysers.
Calculated as per norms, the fair rent comes to Rs.1,61,462/-. Therefore, this petition.
6. The petitioner filed counter challenging the case of the respondent with regard to the claim of the
fair rent. It is admitted that there is Tenancy Agreement between the petitioner and the respondent
and the monthly rent was fixed at Rs.25,000/-. At the time of taking possession, the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis building was in a very bad shape. The petitioner spent on
extensive repair work to make it habitable. The petitioner spent huge sum in repairing work. The
understanding was that, the petitioner will occupy the premises until the amount invested by the
petitioner is returned with interest. They also agreed for the increase in rent after every 22 months.
The rent now payable is Rs.35,000/- per month, which is being paid, without default after deducting
TDS and the amount spent towards repair work. The minor repairs were not attended by the
respondent and therefore, the petitioner was forced to do the minor repairs.
7. The area of the plot measures 4122.33 sq.ft. and the built up area is 1759.35 sq.ft. The building
faces south of 28 feet wide MGR Salai. It is a very narrow road. There is a huge tree near the
entrance and it makes even more narrower the approach. The claim that the building is surrounded
by Banks and other establishments as claimed in the petition, is not correct. The premises is Type-1
building. The doors, windows and ventilators are made up of country wood and vitrified tiling,
cuddapah slabs in the ground floor and first floor replaced by the petitioner, at the time of
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis tenancy. The roof measures 8 feet and the age of the building, is
55 years. Water is not potable. Geyser and Sintex tanks were replaced by the petitioner. The value of
the land would be only Rs.45,00,000/- per ground. The cost of the construction of the building is
Rs.372/- per sq.ft. At the most fair rent will be fixed at Rs.37,500/-.
8. During enquiry before the learned Rent Controller, P.W.1, R.W.1 and R.W.2 were examined.
Ex.P.1 to Ex.P.4 and Ex.R.1 to Ex.R.11 were marked. On considering the documentary and oral
evidence, the learned Rent Controller fixed the fair rent of Rs.1,07,020/- per month. Against this
order, the tenant preferred R.C.A.No.103 of 2016 and the landlord preferred R.C.A.No.282 of 2016.
The learned Rent Control Appellate Authority, on considering the oral and documentary evidence,
the order of the learned Rent Controller and the additional documents produced in the appeal
enhanced the fair rent from Rs.1,07,020/- to Rs.2,51,317/- and dismissed the appeal filed by the
tenant in R.C.A.No.103 of 2016 and allowed the appeal filed by the landlord in R.C.A.No.282 of
2016. Now, the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis tenant has filed this Civil Revision Petition,
challenging the order of the learned Rent Control Appellate Authority in R.C.A.No.103 of 2016.
9. The learned counsel for the petitioner/tenant submitted that, originally the rent was fixed at
Rs.25,000/- per month and it is claimed by the landlord that the rent was enhanced to Rs.58,945/-
from January 2013. The fair rent was fixed at Rs.1,07,020/- by the learned Rent Controller and it
was further enhanced by the learned Rent Control Appellate Authority to Rs.2,51,317/-. It is an
abnormal increase of fair rent. The petitioner had already vacated the premises on 15.03.2018. The
market value adopted for fixing the value of the land, the value adopted for the building, the age
fixed for the building, are not based on scientific method or any valid data.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/69967683/ 3
M/S.Seaeyes Stem Limited vs C.R.V.Joseph on 9 December, 2021
10. He further submitted that both the learned Rent Controller and the learned Rent Control
Appellate Authority have not accepted the Sale Deeds as basis for fixing the market value of the
land. However, they have taken the value in the Sale Deed along with other
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis factors to fix the land value of the building. It is abnormally high.
Appellate Court has admitted Exhibit P5 to Exhibit P8 documents without examining any witness.
Petitioner was deprived of the opportunity of challenging these documents by cross examining the
witnesses. Thus, the enhancement of fair rent from Rs.1,07,020 to Rs.2,51,317/- is not in accordance
with law. Parties to the sample sale deed have not been examined to prove the contents of the sale
deeds. Therefore, market value of the land cannot be determined on the basis of the sample deeds.
Both the Courts below have failed to note the agreement entered into between the parties for
enhancement of the fair rent of Rs.58,945/-. Therefore, the orders of both the learned Rent
Controller and the learned Rent Control Appellate Authority have to be set aside and the fair rent
petition has to be dismissed. In support of this submission, he relied on the following judgments.
2006 3 L.W. 650 in (T.V.Angappan another Vs. The State of Tamil Nadu, represented by the
Secretary to Government, Education Department and others) and 2007 3 CTC 262 in (Greaves
Limited Vs. V.S.Raghavan).
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
11. In the judgment reported in 2006 3 L.W. 650 constitutional validity of Sections 4 and 5 of Tamil
Nadu Buildings (Lease and Rents Control Act) 1960 was challenged. The division bench of this
Court after analyzing the provisions and position of law, observed that cumulative reading of the
scheme of Sections 4, 5 and 6 make it clear that the entire system is so balanced that the fixation of
fair rent is stated to be a fair return on a percentage on the total cost of the building calculated on
certain guiding principles. It is relevant to note that the first schedule appended to the Act gives a
list of amenities which go with the property leased out in the matter of fixation of amenities. Hence,
the fair rent fixation is not solely dependent on the market value of the site, but has several other
factors which are provided for under Section 4. Taking note of the facts and circumstances, we have
no hesitation in rejecting the contention of the petitioners that the provisions of Sections 4 and 5 of
the Tamil Nadu Buildings (Lease and Rent Control) Act, 1960, suffer from arbitrariness to declare
them as violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India and hence, unconstitutional.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
12. Finally, it was held in para 81 of the order that "Unlike the constraints that, the Courts of law
have, legislature has wider space to legislate on to take into account, the demands of changing
situations. There is greater need to approach the problem from a holistic perspective in matters of
this nature. In the course of the arguments, we were given to understand by the learned Special
Government pleader that the Government was contemplating an amendment to the provisions of
the Rent Act. We hope that, keeping in mind, the sentiments expressed, the state will take remedial
action soon to fine-tune the provisions of the Act to match the changes in time". Thus, it is seen from
this judgment that the petitions filed for declaring Sections 4 and 5 of the Tamil Nadu Lease and
Rent Control Act as unconstitutional were dismissed and Sections 4 and 5 have come to stay. Now
Government of Tamil Nadu has enacted a new law titled "Tamil Nadu Regulation of Rights and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/69967683/ 4
M/S.Seaeyes Stem Limited vs C.R.V.Joseph on 9 December, 2021
Responsibilities of landlord and Tenants Act 2017". As of now we have no other optim except to
follow Section 4 of Tamil Nadu Lease and Rent Control Act, for fixing fair rent in this case.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
13. The judgment in 2007 (3) CTC 262 is relied for the proposition that while determining market
value of the site, there should be neither unjust enrichment on the part of the landlord nor
imposition of heavy cost on tenant. Appellate authority should give sufficient opportunity to
opposite side before permitting additional evidence. Mere production and marking of document by
consent is not sufficient to prove the contents of documents produced. In the cited case, the Rent
Control Appellate Authority enhanced the fair rent to Rs.59,590/- from Rs.37,258/-. To fix this rent,
appellate authority relied on a sale deed produced by the landlord Exhibit P6 in the appellate stage.
This Court held that value of small plots cannot be the basis for fixation of market value for an
extent of Rs.5702sqf. It is settled proposition of law that small plots do not provide useful guidance
for determining the market value. Finding that Appellate Authority has not afforded an opportunity
to the tenant in challenging Exhibit P6, which was marked in the Appellate Court and that only an
undivided share of 18.38percent was sold under Exhibit P6, concluded that fixing the value of the
land at Rs.25,00,000/- on the basis of Exhibit P6 was not correct. Taking all these factors into
consideration, this Court modified the order of the Rent https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
Controller appellate Authority and fixed the fair rent at Rs.41,771/- by taking the value of the land at
Rs.12,50,000/- instead of Rs.25,00,000/-.
14. The learned counsel for the petitioner strongly relied on this judgment in support of his case that
even in this case, the petitioner's fair rent was enhanced by the Appellate Court on the basis of
Exhibit P6 sale deed, which was received as additional evidence in the Appellate Court. No witness
was examined for marking the documents and proving the documents. If the documents had been
marked and examined through the concerned witnesses, petitioner would have had an opportunity
of challenging the contents, especially the value given in the sale deed. That opportunity was not
given to the petitioner. That apart, under Exhibit P6 only an undivided share to a small extent was
sold. It is settled proposition of law that the value given for undivided small plot cannot form the
basis for fixing a market value of the land. Thus, he submitted that the fair rent fixed by the
appellate Court cannot be sustained and fair rent has to be reduced.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
15. In response, the learned counsel for the respondent submitted that, originally the rent was fixed
at Rs.25,000/- per month. Even today, the petitioner is paying only Rs.25,000/- per month. He has
not paid the enhanced rent of Rs.58,945/- from January 2013. Therefore, Eviction Petition was filed
against the petitioner. The petitioner has preferred this Revision only against R.C.A.No.103 of 2016
filed by him challenging the fair rent fixed by the learned Rent Controller. He has not preferred any
Revision against the judgment in R.C.A.No.282 of 2016 filed by the landlord for enhancing the fair
rent. The fair rent is now enhanced. Without filing the Revision against the judgment in
R.C.A.No.282 of 2016, the petitioner cannot challenge the enhancement of fair rent.

M/S.Seaeyes Stem Limited vs C.R.V.Joseph on 9 December, 2021
16. He further submitted that both the Courts below have considered the oral and documentary
evidence produced by both the parties, the sample Sale Deed, Engineers Report for fixing the fair
rent. The fair rent was fixed in accordance with well settled principles and Section 4 of the Tamil
Nadu Buildings [Lease and Rent Control] Act. It is not necessary to examine the parties to the
documents to prove the market value of the land. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis The fair rent
fixed by the learned Rent Control Appellate Authority, is just proper and therefore, he prayed for
dismissal of this Civil Revision Petition. In support of his submissions, he relied on the following
judgment.
17. Judgment reported in 2001 (3) SCC 530 Land Acquisition Officer & Mandal Revenue Officer Vs.
V.Narasaiah is relied for the proposition that the decision in Inder Singh Vs. Union of India that
certified copies in the sale deed could not be considered without examining persons connected with
the transactions mentioned therein was over ruled in this case. This judgment was followed in CDJ
2001 MHC 1088 (Susainathan and another Vs. T.Vijayan) and in CDJ 2007 MHC 4037
(V.Krishnamoorthy Vs. M.R.Lalitha & others). The judgment reported in 1986 (99) L.W. 269
(M/s.Dovo Tax Company by its partner A.R.Chinniah Vs. T.R.Ramnath and another) is relied for the
proposition that fair rent is fixed for the building in question in accordance with the provisions of
the Act. It is not fair rent for the landlord or for the tenant, but for the building. As such the Rent
Controller is free to fix the fair rent as per law untrammelled by the contentions of the parties.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
18. Considered the rival submissions and perused the records.
19. There is no dispute with regard to the landlord and tenant relationship between the parties.
There is also no dispute with regard to the fact that initially the premises was let out for
Rs.25,000/-. The area of the plot measures 4335 sq.ft. The building consists of ground floor and
first floor. The building situates in Kalashetra Colony. One of the important localities in Chennai.
Absolutely, there is no dispute with regard to these facts and these are admitted facts. There are two
Engineers Report, Analysis Report, Sketch filed in this case. There are two Sale Deeds as well. The
respondent's side Engineer's Report, Sketch, Analysis Report, Sale Deed, were marked as Ex.P.1 to
Ex.P.4. The petitioner's side Engineer's Report, Sale Deed, Analysis Report, Sketch, were marked as
Ex.R.8 to Ex.R.11. The respondent examined only the Engineer. The petitioner examined Royappan
as R.W.1 and Engineer as R.W.2.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
20. On considering the oral and documentary evidence produced, the learned Rent Controller found
from Ex.P.1 and Ex.R.8 Engineers' Reports that, both the reports classified the building as Type-1
Class 'A' building. Therefore, the building was classified as Type-1 Class 'A' building. The
respondent's Engineer ascertained the age of the building as 33 years and the petitioner's Engineer
ascertained the age of the building as 55 years. It is observed that, both the Engineers have not
conducted any scientific test on the building to fix the age of the building. Taking into account the
fact that, as the owner, the respondent is in better position to know about the age of the building, the
learned Rent Controller fixed the age of the building as 33 years.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/69967683/ 6
M/S.Seaeyes Stem Limited vs C.R.V.Joseph on 9 December, 2021
21. It is admitted case of the parties that the tenanted premises is an individual bungalow. The
respondent's Engineer calculated the ground floor plinth area as 1369.31 sq.ft. and first floor plinth
area as 806 sq.ft. The petitioner's Engineer calculated the first floor plinth area as 1320 sq.ft. and
the first floor plinth area as 777.96 sq.ft. The respondent's Engineer has calculated the area of motor
room, cantilevered slab area, dog https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis house, sentry room. The
petitioner's Engineer has not taken these areas into consideration. It was also admitted by the
petitioner's engineer that he has not measured these areas. Therefore, the learned Rent Controller
taking note of the fact, that the respondent's Engineer has filed his plan and sketch with detailed
measurements, accepted Ex.P.1 and Ex.P.2 for fixing the plinth area and the cost of the construction
as per PWD rate.
22. The learned Rent Controller has found from the evidence of P.W.1, R.W.1 and R.W.2 that, all the
basic amenities are available and awarded 15% towards basic amenities. The petition premises has
overhead tank, mosaic and vitrified tile flooring, electric motor, excess appurtenant land and black
cudappah stone, compound wall. The availability of all these Schedule-I amenities were admitted by
the petitioner and his Engineer. The petitioner's Engineer gave 3% towards Schedule-I amenities
and respondent's Engineer gave 10% for Schedule-I amenities. Giving 1% to each of the amenities
available, the learned Rent Controller granted 6% towards Schedule-I amenities. Depreciation was
based on the age of the building as 33 years. Depreciation was given as 0.7177.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
23. When it comes to land value, the learned Rent Controller found that, the respondent's Engineer
gave the market value of the land as Rs.2,50,00,000/- per ground on the basis of Ex.P.3 Sale Deed
and Analysis Report. Petitioner stated that the market value of the land is Rs.57,00,000/- per
ground. Petitioner produced Ex.R.9 Sale Deed for the premises in Besant Nagar. The respondent
filed Sale Deed pertaining to Kalashetra Road, Thangal Patai, Tiruvanmiyur. Finding that, both the
Sale Deeds do not relate to the Street where the petition premises situates. The road leading to the
petition premises is 30 feet width and it does not have bus transport facility, the distance between
the petition premises and the model Sale Deed, is about 1.6 kms. The learned Rent Controller held
that the petitioner's Engineer Report could not be accepted for fixing the land value. Both the
Engineers, according to the learned Rent Controller have given value on the basis of their
assumption and not based on any supportive evidence. Taking into consideration, the locational
advantages of the building, fixed the market value of the premises at Rs.1,00,00,000/- per ground.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
24. On the aforesaid calculation, the cost of construction was arrived at Rs.16,49,375/-, 15% for
basic amenities was given at Rs.2,47,406/-. The total value of the building at Rs.18,96,781/-, 1%
depreciation for 33 years was given and the value of the building was arrived at Rs.13,61,319/-. The
value of the land was arrived at Rs.1,21,00,375/-, cost of construction plus land value together
comes to Rs.1,34,61,694/-. 6% for Schedule-I amenities at Rs.8,07,701/- was given. The total cost of
the land and building was arrived at Rs.1,42,69,395/-. The fair rent at 9% per month works out to
Rs.1,07,020/-.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/69967683/ 7
M/S.Seaeyes Stem Limited vs C.R.V.Joseph on 9 December, 2021
25. In appeal, the learned Rent Control Appellate Authority agreed with the order of the learned
Rent Controller, with regard to the type of building, age of building, basic amenities, Schedule-I
amenities, depreciation, plinth area and cost of construction. There is no change on the findings
recorded by the learned Rent Controller, on these aspects. While considering the land value, the
learned Rent Control Appellate Authority, considered the additional documents filed by the landlord
in appeal, namely, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Ex.P.5 Sale Deed of the petition premises,
Ex.P.6 sample Sale Deed and Ex.P.7 layout for Survey Nos.161/2 and 3. The petition mentioned
property was purchased on 20.06.1981. The sample Sale Deed Ex.P.6 was registered on 09.08.2013.
On the basis of Ex.P.7 layout, it was found that the petition property is located very near to sample
Sale Deed Ex.P.6. Therefore, the learned Rent Control Appellate Authority, considered Ex.P.6
sample Sale Deed for fixing the market value of the petition premises. Ex.P.8 Engineer's Analysis
Report, was also filed in the appeal. On the basis of Ex.P.6 and Ex.P.8, the market value of the land
was assessed at Rs.3,03,08,963/- per ground. The learned Rent Control Appellate Authority
observed that Ex.P.6 contains the guideline value of the property and that was relevant for the
purpose of fixing stamp duty and the same could not be taken into consideration to calculate the
market value of the land.
26. On this reasoning, the learned Rent Control Appellate Authority, was not inclined to rely on
Ex.P.6 alone to calculate the market value of the land of the petition premises. Considering the
locational advantages from the evidence available, the market value of the land was
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis fixed at Rs.2,50,00,000/- per ground. On the basis of revised land
value, the fair rent was enhanced to Rs.2,51,317/- per month. Having satisfied with this
enhancement, the landlord has not preferred any Civil Revision Petition. Aggrieved against the fair
rent fixed, the tenant has preferred this Civil Revision Petition.
27. The main ground with which, the petitioner / tenant challenges the fair rent fixed, is that, the
parties to the document were not examined to prove the contents of the sample Sale Deeds. He
found from the order of the learned Rent Controller that, the learned Rent Controller has not taken
into consideration of the value given in the sample Sale Deed for fixing the market value of the land.
Even the learned Rent Controller Appellate Authority has not passed the decision on the basis of the
sample Sale Deed Ex.P.6 for determining the market value of the lant. Though it was one of the
corroborative pieces of evidence for fixing the market value of the land, other factors, such as,
locational advantages of the building were considered for fixing the market value of the land.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
28. The submission of the learned counsel for the tenant that, without examining the parties to
Ex.P.3, it cannot be looked into, for determining the market value cannot be accepted for the reason
that, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Land Acquisition Officer & Mandal Revenue Officer vs.
V.Narasaiah reported in (2001) 3 SCC 530, overruled the judgment in Inder Singh vs. Union of
India reported in (1993) 3 SCR 371. The subsequent decisions in Susainathan vs. T.Vijayan reported
in CDJ 2001 MHC 1088 and V.Krishnamoorthy vs. M.R.Lalitha reported in CDJ 2007 MHC 4037
have held that when the genuineness of the document is not disputed, the documents can be relied
on, even without examining the parties for determining the market value. In this view of the matter,
the objection of the learned counsel for the tenant that, without examining the parties to Ex.P.6, it
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/69967683/ 8
M/S.Seaeyes Stem Limited vs C.R.V.Joseph on 9 December, 2021
cannot be relied on, for determining the market value of the land of the petition mentioned property
cannot be accepted.
29. However, what was decided in the decisions reported in CDJ 2001 MHC 1088 and CDJ 2007
MHC 4037, is that only the parties to the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis documents need not be
examined, if there is no doubt with regard to genuineness of the document. However, in the case
before hand Exhibit P5 to P8 have been marked before the Appellate Court. These documents have
been marked without examining the landlord anyone connected with these documents. The learned
Rent Control Appellate Authority enhanced the fair rent mainly on the basis of Exhibit P6 sale deed.
Through this sale deed 12.26% of undivided interest in a total extent of 7104sqft, that is, 871sqft was
sold for Rs.1,09,99,628/-. On the basis of the value of the land given in Exhibit P6 and finding that
Exhibit P6 property situate close to the petition mentioned property, the learned Rent Control
Appellate Authority fixed the land value. Though, the Engineer's analysis in report in Exhibit P8
assessed the value per ground as Rs.3,03,08,963/- per ground, the learned Rent Control Appellate
Authority has not relied totally on Exhibit P6 sale deed. Taking a cue from Exhibit P6 and
considering the locational advantage, it fixed the value at Rs.2,50,00,000/-per ground and modified
the fair rent by enhancing it to Rs.2,51,317/- per month from Rs.1,07,020/-per month. It is settled
proposition of law that value of the small plot of land cannot form basis for fixing market value of
land. In Exhibit P6, only an undivided share https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis of 871sqft from the
larger extent of 7104sqft was sold. Thus, fixing value of land at Rs. 2,50,00,000/- appears a bit
excessive. However, considering the locational advantage of the place where the petition mentioned
building is situated surrounded by land mark buildings like banks, hospitals, commercial
establishments, Velankanni Church, Ashtalakshmi temple, Illiots beach etc., this Court is of the
considered view that fixing the land value of the building at Rs1,50,00,000/- per ground would meet
the ends of justice. In this view of the matter, the fair rent is revised as follows.
