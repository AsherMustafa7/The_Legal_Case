5. The Apex Court in the case of Indian Bank Association and others vs. Union of India and others;

Paragraph Nos. 22, 23 and 24 of the aforesaid judgement are being quoted as under:
"22. We notice, considering all those aspects, few High Courts of the country have
laid down certain procedures for speedy disposal of cases under Section 138 of the
Negotiable Instruments Act. Reference, in this connection, may be made to the
judgments of the Bombay High Court in KSL and Industries Ltd. v. Mannalal
Khandelwal, Indo International Ltd. v. State of Maharashtra (2005) 44 Civil CC and
Harischandra Biyani v. Stock Holding Corpn. of India Ltd. (2006) 4 MhLJ 381, the
judgment of the Calcutta High Court in Magma Leasing Ltd. v. State of West Bengal
and others (2007) 3 CHN 574 and the judgment of the Delhi High Court in Rajesh
Agarwal v. State and another (2010) ILR 6 Delhi 610.
Directions
23. Many of the directions given by the various High Courts, in our view, are worthy
of emulation by the Criminal Courts all over the country dealing with cases under
Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, for which the following directions are
being given :-
23.1. The Metropolitan Magistrate/Judicial Magistrate (MM/JM), on the day when
the complaint under Section 138 of the Act is presented, shall scrutinize the
complaint and, if the complaint is accompanied by the affidavit, and the affidavit and
the documents, if any, are found to be in order, take cognizance and direct issuance
of summons.
23.2. The MM/JM should adopt a pragmatic and realistic approach while issuing
summons. Summons must be properly addressed and sent by post as well as by
e-mail address got from the complainant. The court, in appropriate cases, may take
the assistance of the police or the nearby court to serve notice to the accused. For
notice of appearance, a short date be fixed. If the summons is received back unserved,
immediate follow-up action be taken.
23.3. The court may indicate in the summon that if the accused makes an application
for compounding of offences at the first hearing of the case and, if such an
application is made, the court may pass appropriate orders at the earliest.
23.4. The court should direct the accused, when he appears to furnish a bail bond, to
ensure his appearance during trial and ask him to take notice under Section 251

Cr.P.C. to enable him to enter his plea of defence and fix the case for defence
evidence, unless an application is made by the accused under Section 145(2) for
recalling a witness for cross-examination.
23.5. The court concerned must ensure that examination-in-chief, cross-examination
and re-examination of the complainant must be conducted within three months of
assigning the case. The court has option of accepting affidavits of the witnesses,
instead of examining them in the court. The witnesses to the complaint and accused
must be available for cross-examination as and when there is direction to this effect
by the court.
24. We, therefore, direct all the criminal courts in the country dealing with Section
138 cases to follow the above-mentioned procedures for speedy and expeditious
disposal of cases falling under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. Writ
Petition is, accordingly, disposed of, as above."
6. The Apex Court in the case of In Re: Expeditious Trial of Cases under Section 138 N.I. Act, 1881,
reported in 2021 SCC Online 325 has already issued following directions for expeditious trial u/s
138 N.I. Act as under:-
"24. The upshot of the above discussion leads us to the following conclusions:
1) The High Courts are requested to issue practice directions to the Magistrates to
record reasons before converting trial of complaints under Section 138 of the Act
from summary trial to summons trial.
2) Inquiry shall be conducted on receipt of complaints under Section 138 of the Act to
arrive at sufficient grounds to proceed against the accused, when such accused
resides beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the court.
3) For the conduct of inquiry under Section 202 of the Code, evidence of witnesses on
behalf of the complainant shall be permitted to be taken on affidavit. In suitable
cases, the Magistrate can restrict the inquiry to examination of documents without
insisting for examination of witnesses.
4) We recommend that suitable amendments be made to the Act for provision of one
trial against a person for multiple offences under Section 138 of the Act committed
within a period of 12 months, notwithstanding the restriction in Section 219 of the
Code.
5) The High Courts are requested to issue practice directions to the Trial Courts to
treat service of summons in one complaint under Section 138 forming part of a
transaction, as deemed service in respect of all the complaints filed before the same
court relating to dishonour of cheques issued as part of the said transaction.

6) Judgments of this Court in Adalat Prasad (supra) and Subramanium Sethuraman
(supra) have interpreted the law correctly and we reiterate that there is no inherent
power of Trial Courts to review or recall the issue of summons. This does not affect
the power of the Trial Court under Section 322 of the Code to revisit the order of
issue of process in case it is brought to the court's notice that it lacks jurisdiction to
try the complaint.
7) Section 258 of the Code is not applicable to complaints under Section 138 of the
Act and findings to the contrary in Meters and Instruments (supra) do not lay down
correct law. To conclusively deal with this aspect, amendment to the Act empowering
the Trial Courts to reconsider/recall summons in respect of complaints under Section
138 shall be considered by the Committee constituted by an order of this Court dated
10.03.2021.
8) All other points, which have been raised by the Amici Curiae in their preliminary
report and written submissions and not considered herein, shall be the subject matter
of deliberation by the aforementioned Committee. Any other issue relating to
expeditious disposal of complaints under Section 138 of the Act shall also be
considered by the Committee."
7. From the above mentioned judgements of Hon'ble Apex Court, it is clear that the Apex Court for
expeditious disposal of cases under N.I. Act, has issued several directions which the concerned
court/Magistrate has to follow while deciding the cases under N.I. Act. From the observations of the
Apex Court as well as analysis of Sections 138 & 143 of N.I. Act, it is expedient that all the
proceedings under N.I. Act should be concluded expeditiously without going into unnecessary
technicality.
8. Considering the aforesaid judgements, the Judicial Magistrate-I, Court No.12, Basti is directed to
decide the Complaint Case No.1957 of 2021 (Ram Murat Vs. Radhey Shyam Pandey), under Section
138 N.I. Act, P.S. Kaptanganj, District Basti, keeping in mind the direction of the Apex Court in
above mentioned cases, expeditiously preferably within a period of six months from the date of
receipt of certified copy of this order, strictly in accordance with statutory provision of Sections
143(2) and 143(3) of the N.I. Act, if there is no legal impediment.
9. It is also directed to the concerned court that for ensuring the presence of accused during trial, it
should not hesitate to take coercive measures provided under Cr.P.C.
10. With the aforesaid direction, the application is disposed of.
Order Date :- 2.1.2025 Jitendra
