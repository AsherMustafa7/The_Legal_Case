Petition is filed under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, to strike
down the plaint in O.S.No.142 of 2010 on the file of the Principal
District Judge, Virudhunagar District at Srivilliputtur, by allowing this

COMMON ORDER
The Civil Revision Petition in C.R.P.(MD)No.2275 of 2011, arises out of the proceedings in execution
that were levied by the petitioner seeking execution of a compromise award passed by the Lok
Adalat in O.S.No.10 of 2007 on 31.03.2010.
2. The suit in O.S.No.10 of 2007 was filed by the plaintiff seeking permanent injunction restraining
the defendant from interfering with the plaintiff's possession of the suit property.
3. According to the plaintiff the suit property was let out to him as vacant land on 01.01.2006, with
permission to put up superstructure to use it as parking plot for the buses belonging to
P.S.R.Engineering College run by the plaintiff. During the pendency of the said suit the matter was
referred to Lok Adalat and compromise http://www.judis.nic.in2/18 C.R.P.(MD)Nos2368 /2010
and 2275/11 award came to be passed on 31.03.2010. The compromise award provided that the
plaintiff would remove the superstructure put up by him in the suit property and vacate and hand
over the possession of the suit property to the defendant therein on or before 30.06.2010.
4. Since the plaintiff did not comply with the said award and failed to hand over the possession, the
defendant / decree holder levied execution proceedings in E.P.No.26 of 2010. Counter and
additional counter were filed in the execution proceedings contending that the award is inexecutable
inasmuch as the plaintiff had already instituted a suit in O.S.No.142 of 2010 seeking cancellation of
the Lok Adalat award dated 31.03.2010 on the ground that it has been obtained by fraud and undue
influence. It was also further contended that the plaintiff being a tenant of vacant land and having
put up the construction would be entitled to protection under the Tamil Nadu City Tenants
Protection Act, 1922.

5. The plaintiff / judgment debtor also came up with an application in E.A.No.27 of 2011 purportedly
under Section 47 of the Civil Procedure Code praying to declare the decree as inexecutable. The
main contention of the petitioner in E.A.No.27 of 2011 was that subsequent to the compromise
decree, he has purchased an undivided 2/5th share in the property, subject matter of the
compromise decree http://www.judis.nic.in3/18 C.R.P.(MD)Nos2368 /2010 and 2275/11 from two
sons of the petitioner herein on 17.03.2011. Therefore he having become co-sharer, the decree for
delivery of possession cannot be executed against him.
6. The said petition was resisted by the petitioner herein contending that the purchaser from the
co-sharers of an undivided interest cannot retain the possession of the property in the teeth of the
valid decree passed before the Lok Adalat directing him to deliver possession. It was also contended
that the remedy of such purchaser is only to sue for partition and recovery of possession.
7. It will not be out of place to mention that a suit for partition was laid by the sons of the petitioner
in O.S.No.1 of 2008, in which the respondent herein was also made as a party. He was subsequently
exonerated by filing a memo on 06.01.2011. A preliminary decree was passed in O.S.No.1 of 2008
declaring the shares of the plaintiffs in the said suit. It is also seen from the proceedings that the
respondent herein namely, the purchaser had filed applications in I.A.No.1 of 2012 in O.S.No.1 of
2008 seeking supplementary preliminary decree declaring his right over the property. It is also
stated that the said application in I.A.No.1 of 2012 was dismissed for non prosecution.
http://www.judis.nic.in4/18 C.R.P.(MD)Nos2368 /2010 and 2275/11
8. The learned District Munsif, who heard the application under Section 47 concluded that in view
of the fact that the judgment debtor has acquired on interest in the property, subsequent to the
decree and has become co-owner, the decree passed in O.S.No.10 of 2007 becomes inexecutable. On
the said conclusion the Executing Court allowed the Section 47 application declaring the decree is
inexcutable. Though the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Ramdas Vs. Seethabi and others
[2009 (5) MLJ 847 (S.C.)] was brought to the notice of the Executing Court, the Executing Court
held that the said decision would not apply to the facts of the case. After doing so, the Executing
Court relied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Savithri Dei and others vs.
Saratchandra Rao and others [1996 (3) SCC 301], which dealt with a case, where the decree was
rendered inexecutable because of a subsequent enactment being passed in support of its conclusion.
It is this order of the Executing Court allowing the application under Section 47 of the Civil
Procedure Code and concluding that the decree in O.S.No.10 of 2007 is inexecutable, that is
challenged in the above Civil Revision Petition.
9. The Civil Revision Petition in C.R.P.(MD)No.2368 of 2010 is filed under 227 of the Constitution
of India seeking rejection of the plaint filed in O.S.No.142 of the 2010. The said suit in O.S.No.142 of
2010 was laid by the respondent in this revision petition seeking http://www.judis.nic.in5/18
C.R.P.(MD)Nos2368 /2010 and 2275/11 declaration that the award of the Lok Adalat dated
31.03.2010 made in O.S.10 of 2007 is invalid and inoperative and for an injunction restraining the
defendants therein namely the petitioners in C.R.P. (MD)No.2368 of 2010 from interfering with the
possession of the plaintiff in the said suit in execution or otherwise of the decree in O.S.No.10 of

T.P.Kathiresan (Died) vs R.Ramadass (Died) on 27 February, 2020
2007.
10. The main ground on which this Civil Revision Petition is filed directly under Article 227 of the
Constitution of India is that such suit is barred under the provisions of Section 21 of the Legal
Services Authorities Act, 1987. Since both civil revision petitions relate to same subject matter, they
are taken up together for disposal.
11. I shall first deal with C.R.P.(MD)No.2368 of 2010 as the same can be disposed of on legal issue.
The prayer in the suit in O.S.No.142 of 2010 is for declaration that the award of the Lok Adalat dated
31.03.2010 made in O.S.No.10 of 2007 is invalid and inoperative and for consequential injunction.
Section 21 of the Legal Services Authority Act, 1987 reads as follows:-
“21. Award of Lok Adalat – 1[(1) Every award of the Lok Adalat shall be deemed to be
a decree of a civil court or, as the case may be, an order of any other court and where
a compromise or settlement has been arrived at by a Lok Adalat in a case referred to
it under sub-section (1) of section http://www.judis.nic.in6/18 C.R.P.(MD)Nos2368
/2010 and 2275/11 20, the court-fee paid in such case shall be refunded in the
manner provided under the Court-fees Act, 1870 (7 of 1870).] (2) Every award made
by a Lok Adalat shall be final and binding on all the parties to the dispute, and no
appeal shall lie to any court against the award.”
12. The question is as to whether such suit is maintainable is no longer res integra. Similar question
arose before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in State of Punjap and another Vs. Jalour Singh and others
[2008 (2) SCC 660]. Considering the scope of Sections 19, 20 and 21 of the Act, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court had held as follows:-
“....
12.It is true that where an award is made by Lok Adalat in terms of a settlement
arrived at between the parties, (which is duly signed by parties and annexed to the
award of the Lok Adalat), it becomes final and binding on the parties to the
settlement and become executable as if it is a decree of a civil Court, and no appeal
lies against it to any Court. If any party wants to challenge such an award based on
settlement, it can be done only by filing a petition under Article 226 and / or Article
2278 of the Constitution, that too on very limited grounds. ..........”
13. This dictum of above three Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court was
followed and reiterated in Bharvagi Constructions and another Vs. Kothalkapu
Muthyam Reddy and others [2017 (5) CTC 775] wherein a two Judge Bench of the
Supreme Court observed as follows:-
http://www.judis.nic.in7/18 C.R.P.(MD)Nos2368 /2010 and 2275/11 “......

T.P.Kathiresan (Died) vs R.Ramadass (Died) on 27 February, 2020
27. In our considered view, the aforesaid law laid down by this Court is binding on all
the Courts in the country by virtue of mandate of Article 141 of the Constitution. This
Court, in no uncertain terms, has laid down that challenge to the Award of Lok Adalat
can be done only by filing a writ petition under article 226 and / or Article 227 of the
Constitution of India in the High Court and that too on very limited grounds.
28. In the Light of the clear pronouncement of the law by this Court, we are of the
opinion that the only remedy available to the aggrieved person (Respondents herein /
plaintiffs) was to file a Writ Petition under Articlce 226 and / or 227 of the
Constitution of India in the High Court for challenging the Award dated 22.08.2007
passed by the Lok Adalat. It was then for the writ Court to decide as to whether any
ground was made out by the writ petitioners for quashing the award and, if so,
whether those grounds are sufficient for is quashing.
........” From the above position of law declared by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, it is abundantly clear
that the suit challenging an award of a Lok Adalat is not maintainable.
14. The learned counsel for the respondents in C.R.P.(MD)No. 2368 of 2010 would further contend
that the remedy of the petitioner is to approach the trial Court under Rule 7 Order 11 of the Civil
Procedure Code and he cannot directly invoke the Constitutional remedy under Article 227 of the
Constitution of India. In support of the said submission, he would rely upon the judgment of the
Hon'ble http://www.judis.nic.in8/18 C.R.P.(MD)Nos2368 /2010 and 2275/11 Supreme Court in
Virudhunagar Hindu Nadargal Dharma Paribalana Sabai Vs. Tuticorin Educational Society [(2019)
0 Supreme(SC) 1104]. The said decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court dealt with a challenge under
Article 227 of the Constitution of India to an order passed under Order 39 Rules 1 and 2 of the Civil
Procedure Code. While concluding that in view of the availability of the remedy by way of an appeal
under Order 43 of the Civil Procedure Code against an order passed under Order 39 Rules 1 and 3 of
the Civil Procedure Code, revision under Article 227 would not lie. While doing so, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court had observed that availability of remedy by way of an appeal would be a bar for
exercising supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court. The High Court should not normally interfere
with such orders, which are appealable or for which alternative remedy is available under the Code
in exercise of its power under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. Even in the said judgment, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court has preserved the power of the High Court to exercise its supervisory
jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution in exceptional cases, where there is a clear
violation of law or the proceedings would amount to abuse of process of Court.
15. The law relating to availability of alternative remedy as a bar invoke constitutional remedy is too
well settled. The availability of the alternative remedy is not an absolute bar to invoke
http://www.judis.nic.in9/18 C.R.P.(MD)Nos2368 /2010 and 2275/11 constitutional remedy. It is
only as a matter of judicial discipline that the High Courts refrain from invoking constitutional
power when effective alternative remedy is available under another law including Civil Procedure
Code. At the same time, the respondent cannot be allowed to take advantage of the self imposed
restrictions practiced by the High Court while exercising constitutional power of supervisory
jurisdiction under article 227 of the Constitution of India in order to defeat just claims and to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/104347665/ 5
T.P.Kathiresan (Died) vs R.Ramadass (Died) on 27 February, 2020
sustain a wholly obnoxious abuse of process of law.
16. As already pointed, the suit in O.S.No.142 of 2010 is clearly not maintainable in view of the
provisions of Section 21 of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 as well as the judgments of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court referred to supra. The said suit should not be allowed to be on file even for a
moment. When such dereliction is brought to the notice of the High Court, the High Court cannot,
in my considered opinion, close its eye and drive the parties to the regular remedy under Order 7
Rule 11 of the Civil Procedure Code. There are cases, where the High Court in exercise of the power
under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, had even struck of suits, which amount abuse of
process of law or which are clearly barred by law. The power under Article 227 of the Constitution of
India is so wide that it can be exercised by the High Court to redress the grievance of the
http://www.judis.nic.in10/18 C.R.P.(MD)Nos2368 /2010 and 2275/11 litigant, which is genuine.
This power also encompasses in itself the power to prevent any abuse of process of Court. The suit in
O.S.No. 142 of 200 in my considered opinion is a clear abuse of process of Court.
17. Having agreed and submitted to the award by the Lok Adalat, the respondent herein within six
months of the said award thought it fit to file a suit seeking declaration that the award is not legal
and enforceable. Only reason that is assigned in the said suit is that he was not informed about the
statutory protection available to him under the Tamil Nadu City Tenants Protection Act, 1922. . That
plea is in total ignorance of the provisions of the Tamil Nadu City Tenants Protection Act, 1922.
18. Admittedly, the tenancy in this case had commenced on 01.01.2006. The Tamil Nadu City
Tenants Protection Act, 1922. would apply only to the tenancies that were created before publication
of the Madras City Tenants Protection (Amendment) Act, 1979 insofar as areas, in which the Act was
in force prior to the date of publication of the Madras City Tenant Protection (Amendment) Act,
1979 in the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette.
http://www.judis.nic.in11/18 C.R.P.(MD)Nos2368 /2010 and 2275/11
19. It is not in dispute that the Act was extended to the Municipal Town of Sivakasi by
G.O.Ms.No.2736, Revenue dated 10.07.1956 and published in the Gazette on 1st August, 1956.
Therefore, the main Act namely the Tamil Nadu City Tenants Protection Act, 1922 was in force in
Sivakasi when the amending Act, 1979 came into force. It is clear from the provisions of Sub Section
3 of Section 1 of the Act, the Act would apply only to tenancies created before the date of publication
of the Amendment Act, 1979 in the Tamil Nadu Government Gazzette.
20. The Amendment Act, 1979 was published in the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette on 03 March
1980. The tenancy in question having created on 01.01.2006, it is clear that the tenant would not be
entitled to the benefits of the said enactment. Therefore, the very basis on which said suit in
O.S.No.142 of 2010 was laid itself does not exist. I am therefore of the considered opinion that the
suit in O.S.No. 142 of 2010 is an abuse of process of Court and the said plaint cannot be allowed to
be retained on file.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/104347665/ 6
T.P.Kathiresan (Died) vs R.Ramadass (Died) on 27 February, 2020
21. I do no think that I will be justified in refusing to exercise power under Article 227 and drive the
petitioner to proceed under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Civil Procedure Code seeking rejection of the
plaint. As already pointed out, the very power of supervisory http://www.judis.nic.in12/18
C.R.P.(MD)Nos2368 /2010 and 2275/11 jurisdiction under Article 227 of is meant to curb such
activities and refusal of exercise of such power in cases like this would only dilute the trust that the
people have in Courts and legal system. Hence, C.R.P.(MD)No.2368 of 2010 deserves to be allowed
and the same is accordingly, allowed and the suit in O.S.No.142 of 2010 will stand rejected.
22. This leaves us with C.R.P.(MD)No.2275 of 2011. It is the contention of the respondent herein,
who is the applicant in E.A.No.27 of 2011 that the decree in O.S.No.10 of 2007 is inexecutable
inasmuch as he has purchased an undivided portion of the property subject matter of the said suit
under compromise decree from two sharers.
23. Admittedly, the suit for partition in O.S.No.1 of 2008 had been filed and preliminary decree has
also been passed. But no final decree has been passed till date. It is also the admitted case of the
parties that the respondent in C.R.P.(MD)No.2275 of 2011 became tenant under the petitioner
therein and his suit for injunction in O.S.No.10 of 2007 was laid only against the petitioner / first
defendant. Before the Lok Adalat, the matter was settled and the tenant agreed to hand over
possession to the landlord by 30.06.2010. Upon his failure to do so, the landlord who was favoured
with the http://www.judis.nic.in13/18 C.R.P.(MD)Nos2368 /2010 and 2275/11 decree by Lok
Adalat upon consent of the parties had filed E.P.No.26 of 2010. It was during the pendency of the
said execution proceedings the tenant, who had suffered a decree, purchased an undivided share
from two sons of the landlord on 17.03.2011.
24. It has to be seen what will be the effect of the purchase by a third party of an undivided share
from the members of the family. The said question is also no longer res integra. The Hon'ble
Supreme Court in Sidheshwar Mukherjee vs. Bhubaneshwar Prasad Narain Singh and others [
A.I.R. 1953 S.C. 487 (Vol.40, C.N.120)] had dealt with the right of a purchaser of an undivided
interest of a coparcener in the joint family property. While doing so, the Hon'ble Supreme Court had
observed as follows:-
“...
11.......All that he purchased at the execution sal was the undivided interest of the
coparceners in the joint property. He did not acquire title to any defined share in the
property and was not entitled to joint possession from th e date of his purchase. He
could work out his rights only by a suit for partition and his right to possession would
date from the period when a specific allotment was made in his favour.
In our opinion, this is the right view to take and Mr.Daphtary, who appeared in support of the
appeals, could not satisfy us that in law his client was entitled to joint possession on and from the
date of purchase......” http://www.judis.nic.in14/18 C.R.P.(MD)Nos2368 /2010 and 2275/11
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/104347665/ 7
T.P.Kathiresan (Died) vs R.Ramadass (Died) on 27 February, 2020
25. In M.V.S.Manikayala Rao Vs. M.Narshimhaswami and others [AIR 1966 Supreme Court 470 (V
53 C 98)], the Hon'ble Supreme Court while dealing with the same question of right of the third
party purchaser of an undivided interest in join family property has observed as follows:-
“.....
5.....Now, it is well settled that the purchaser of a coparcener's undivided interest in
joint family property is not entitled to possession of what he has purchased. His only
right is to sue for partition of the property and ask for allotment to him of that which
on partition might be found to fall to the share of the coparcener whose share he had
purchased. His right to possession “would date from the period when a specific
allotment was made in his favour. .....”
26. In a recent decision in Ramdas Vs. Sitabai and others [(2009) 7 SCC 444], the Hon'ble Supreme
Court had after referring to the above two decisions held as follows:-
“....
19.In view of the aforesaid position there could be no dispute with regard to the fact
that an undivided share of co-
sharer may be a subject-matter of sale, but possession cannot be handed over to the vendee unless
the property is partitioned by metes and bounds amicably and through mutual settlement or by a
decree of the Court.
......” http://www.judis.nic.in15/18 C.R.P.(MD)Nos2368 /2010 and 2275/11
27.From the above decisions, the position of law that emerges is that the purchaser of an undivided
interest in coparcenery property cannot demand possession or retain possession against other
sharers. His right is to sue for partition and seek allotment. To use the words of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court his right to possession would date from the period when a specific allotment was
made in his favour. Therefore, unless it is shown that allotment of a specific property was made in
favour of the said purchaser of an undivided interest, he would not have the right to get possession
of the property.
28. Having submitted to a compromise decree the respondent herein cannot invoke Section 47 of
the Civil Procedure Code and seek a declaration that the decree is inexecutable. Though the decision
of the Hon'ble Suprme Court in Ramdas Vs. Seethabi and others [2009 (5) MLJ 847 (S.C.)] was
brought to the notice of the Executing Court, the Executing Court sought to distinguish it on rather
irrelevant and flimsy grounds. The Executing Court sought to rely upon the judgment in Savithri Dei
and others vs. Saratchandra Rao and others [1996 (3) SCC 301].
29. In my considered opinion that reliance placed by the Executing Court on the judgment in
Savithri Dei and others vs. Saratchandra Rao and others [1996 (3) SCC 301] is wholly
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/104347665/ 8
T.P.Kathiresan (Died) vs R.Ramadass (Died) on 27 February, 2020
http://www.judis.nic.in16/18 C.R.P.(MD)Nos2368 /2010 and 2275/11 misconceived. The other
decision that is relied upon by the Executing Court in Imambi Vs. Azeeza Bee [2002 (2) L.W. 808]
dealt with the case, where the tenant entered into an agreement of sale with the landlord in respect
of entire tenanted premises. The Hon'ble Supreme Court held that upon such agreement the tenant
would loose the character of tenant and he would part take the character of an agreement holder in
possession. Therefore the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the decree for eviction cannot be
executed against such tenant.
30. It is not the case on hand. Here is a case, where the tenant, who had suffered a decree for
possession had purchased an undivided interest in the property from two of the coparceners. The
property being undivided, the tenant cannot claim to be in possession of the entirity of the property
and contend that the decree against him for eviction becomes inexecutable as a whole. The remedy
as pointed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court is for the purchaser to seek partition and get a definite
share allotted to him and his right to possession will accrue only from the date, on which he gets the
definite share allotted to him. So long as the definite share is not allotted to him, he cannot resist
execution of a validly obtained decree. http://www.judis.nic.in17/18 C.R.P.(MD)Nos2368 /2010 and
2275/11 R.SUBRAMANIAN,J ta
31. I am therefore of the considered opinion that the Executing Court was in error in allowing
application under Section 47 of the Civil Procedure Code at the instance of the tenant, who had
suffered a decree for eviction that too a compromise decree before the Lok Adalat. The order of the
Executing Court allowing the Section 47 application, to say the least, is materially irregular and is
against all principles of the law laid down by the Hon'ble Suprme Court. In view of the same, I have
no hesitation to set aside the order. Accordingly, the order of the Executing Court in E.A.No.27 of
2011 made on 21.10.2011 is set aside. The application in E.A.No.27 of 2011 will stand dismissed. The
execution proceedings in E.P.No.26 of 10 will stand restored and there will be a direction to the
Executing Court to proceed with the execution petition in accordance with law and dispose of the
same within a period of three months from the date of receipt of copy of this order and report such
disposal to this Court. In fine, these Civil Revision Petitions are allowed. No costs.
