M/S Jubilant Life Sciences Limited vs State Of U.P. Thru Principal Secy Excise ... on 28 March, 2025
2. The present petition was initially filed for quashing the order dated 12.02.2012 passed by District
Magistrate (Licensing Authority) by which the M.A.-4 license of the applicant was suspended for
committing repeated violation of Rule 17-D, 17-E, 17-F, 17-G of U.P. Poisons (Regulation of
Possession and Sale) Rules 1921 (hereinafter referred to as the "Rules 1921") as well as
non-obtaining the license of M.A.-2 in pursuance of order dated 28.05.2011 with further direction to
show cause why his M.A.-4 license may not be cancelled. Subsequently, an amendment was also
made in the writ petition with the permission of this Court dated 12.11.2018, by which vires of Rule
17-B(b), Rule 17-D(d), Rule 17-F was challenged on the ground that the same is beyond the power of
the State Government under Section 2 r/w Section 6 of the Poisons Act, 1919.
3. The petitioner is a company that purchases methyl alcohol to use it for industrial purposes for
which the petitioner company had also obtained license M.A.-4 as per Rule 17-B(c) of Rules 1921.
The M.A.-4 license permits the license holder to purchase, possess, use or sell methyl alcohol for
medical, scientific, educational, industrial or professional purposes. The inspection was made by the
District Excise Officer, Jyotibha Phule Nagar, on 20.05.2011 of the premises of the petitioner
wherein certain violations of the Rules 1921 were found, which includes purchasing the methyl
alcohol from non-licensed unit. Thereafter, a show cause notice dated 01.06.2011 was issued to the
petitioner, which he replied to on 13.06.2011. Thereafter, the District Nodal Committee, in its
meeting dated 11.08.2011 directed the petitioner to take a license in form M.A.-2. Thereafter, a letter
was also issued on 12.10.2011 directing the petitioner to obtain M.A.-2 license. The petitioner
challenged the resolution dated 11.08.2011, the order dated 12.10.2011 as well as the vires of Rule
17-D of Rules 1921 before this Court by way of WRIT- C No. 70182 of 2011, which was partly allowed
vide order dated 07.12.2011 by quashing the resolution dated 11.08.2011 and the order dated
12.10.2011 with further direction to pass a fresh order after considering the petitioner's reply dated
13.06.2011. However, the Court refused to declare Rule 17-D(d) of the Rules 1921, as ultra vires. In
pursuance of the order dated 07.12.2011 passed in WRIT- C No. 70182 of 2011, the impugned order
dated 12.02.2012, has been passed, which is under challenge.
4. The contention of learned counsel for the petitioner is that it is not in dispute that the applicant is
purchasing and storing methyl alcohol for use in industrial purposes. It is not involved in the sale of
methyl alcohol. An M.A.-2 license is for possession for sale as well as sale of methyl alcohol.
Therefore, the petitioner cannot be directed to obtain M.A.-2 license. It is further submitted by
learned counsel for the petitioner that the State, under Section 2 of the Poisons Act, 1919 has power
to regulate the possession for sale as well as sale of any poison. Therefore, the State cannot frame
rules for regulating the possession of poison for any other purpose except the sale. Therefore, Rule
17-B(b), 17-B(c), 17-D(d) and 17-F of the Rules 1921 are ultra vires to Section 2 of the Poisons Act,
1919 being beyond the power of the State Government because the same lies within the power of
Central Government u/s 3 of the Poisons Act, 1919.
5. Per contra, learned Standing Counsel vehemently opposed the contention of learned counsel for
the petitioner and submitted that the petitioner himself obtained M.A.-4 license under Rule 17-B(c).
Therefore, it is bound to follow Rules 17-B, 17-D and 17-F of the Rules 1921. It is further submitted
by learned Standing Counsel that Section 8 of the Poisons Act, 1919 gives power to frame rule in
addition to rule making power under Section 2 except on the subject of rule making power of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/80572777/ 2
M/S Jubilant Life Sciences Limited vs State Of U.P. Thru Principal Secy Excise ... on 28 March, 2025
Central Government under Section 3 of the Poisons Act, 1919.
6. After considering the submissions of learned counsel for rival parties and perusal of the record, it
is not in dispute that the petitioner is M.A.-4 license holder under Rule 17-B(c) to purchase, possess,
use and sell methyl alcohol for industrial purposes, and it is also not in dispute that the petitioner is
not involved in the business of selling methyl alcohol. Rule 17-D of Rules 1921 further imposes a
duty on M.A.-4 license holder to purchase the methyl alcohol from M.A.-1, M.A.-2 or M.A.3 license
holder. For reference, Sections 17-B and 17-D of Rules 1921 (existing before amendment made in the
year 2014) are being quoted as under :
17-B. Possession and sale of Methyl Alcohol without licence is prohibited-
(a) Any industry in the State producing Methyl Alcohol as a by-product shall not sell
it except under a licence granted by the Licensing Authority in Form M.A.-1.
(b) Unless exempted from the operation of these rules, no person shall keep, possess
for sale or sell whether by wholesale or retail Methyl Alcohol except under a licence
granted by the licensing Authority in Form M.A.-2 and Form M.A.-3 for wholesale
and retail respectively.
(c) No person shall purchase, possess, use or sell Methyl Alcohol for medical,
scientific, educational, industrial or professional purpose or for the purpose of any
act without a licence granted by the Licensing Authority in Form M.A.-4.
(d) No person shall purchase, possess, use or sell Methyl Alcohol in the form of
thinners, paints and varnishes in quantities exceeding two litres without a licence in
Form M.A.-4.
(e) No person or industry in the State shall store, possess, distribute, transfer or sell
Methyl Alcohol under any licence to any person or industry without mixing a
colouring agent and prudent colour as prescribed by the Excise Commissioner, Uttar
Pradesh.
(f) The word and sign 'Poison' will be prominently written and displayed on all places
and containers where or wherein, Methyl Alcohol or any of its products is stored or
contained.
17-D. Sources of supply-
(a) No manufacturer of Methyl alcohol in the State of Uttar Pradesh shall sell Methyl
Alcohol except under a licence in Form MA 1.
(b) Licensee holding a licence in Form M.A.-2 shall not obtain his supply of Methyl
Alcohol except from-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/80572777/ 3
M/S Jubilant Life Sciences Limited vs State Of U.P. Thru Principal Secy Excise ... on 28 March, 2025
(i) any licensee of the State holding a licence in Form M.A.-1 for possession and sale
by wholesale of Methyl Alcohol:
(ii) any part of India outside the State of Uttar Pradesh under a permit granted by the
Collector in Form M.A.-5.
(c) A licence holder in Form M.A.-3 shall obtain his supply of Methyl Alcohol from a
licence holder in Form M.Î‘.-2.
(d) A licence holder in Form M.A.-4 shall obtain his supply of Methyl Alcohol from a
licence holder in Form M.A.-1, M.A.-2 or M.A-3 as decided by the Licensing
Authority, in the case of the M.A-4 licence intending to purchase and sell Methyl
Alcohol in the form of thinners, pants and varnishes, he shall be permitted to do so
from a MA-4 licensee who is authorised to manufacture such products.
(e) Licence holders in Form M.A.-2 and M.A.-3 shall not receive at their licensed
premises any Methyl Alcohol except under a permit granted by the Collector in Form
M.A. 5 Export of Methyl Alcohol out of Uttar Pradesh shall be allowed under a permit
granted by the Collector in Form M.A.-7 only from the premises of a licence holder
having M.A-Tor M.A.-2 licence.
(f) The licence holders in Form M.A.-1 and M.A.-2 shall not remove or all-ow any
person to remove any Methyl Alcohol from his licensed premises without a transport
permit granted by him in Form M.A.-6.
7. From the above rules, it is clear that an M.A.-2 license is required to be taken only for the purpose
of possession for sale and sale of Methyl alcohol as wholesaler and not for possession of methyl
alcohol for using it for industrial purposes. As per Section 17-D(d), M.A.-4 license holder shall
purchase methyl alcohol from the license holder who is having M.A.-1, M.A.-2 and M.A.-3 license.
Therefore, if supplier of methyl alcohol within or outside the State does not have M.A.-1, M.A.-2 and
M.A.-3 license then license holder of M.A.-4 cannot purchase methyl alcohol from that supplier.
There is no provision in Rules 1921 permitting the M.A.-4 license holder to purchase or procure
methyl alcohol from unlicensed suppliers, even within the State but if it wants to purchase the same
from the supplier of outside the State then it is permissible only after obtaining M.A.-2 license. It is
also clear from the above analysis that M.A.-4 license holder can also sell methyl alcohol for the
purpose mentioned in Rule 17-B(c) of Rules 1921, but if it wants to sell or possess the same for any
other purpose not mentioned in Rule 17-B(c), then it has to obtain M.A.-2 license as wholesaler or
M.A.-3 license for being a retailer and it is a wholesaler with M.A.-2 license can purchase methyl
alcohol for any purpose, including the purpose mentioned in Rule 17-B(c) from outside the State.
8. From the impugned order, it is clear that the petitioner had purchased/procured the methyl
alcohol, even for industrial purposes from the supplier within and outside the State though none of
them was having M.A.-1, M.A.-2 or M.A.-3 license. Though for purchasing methyl alcohol from
outside the State under the permit of the Collector, M.A.-2 license is necessary, but if the petitioner
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/80572777/ 4
M/S Jubilant Life Sciences Limited vs State Of U.P. Thru Principal Secy Excise ... on 28 March, 2025
wants to purchase Methyl alcohol from the licensed supplier within the State, then it is not required
to obtain M.A.-2 license and the same is permissible on M.A.-4 license as per Rule 17-D(d), subject
to the condition that it has to purchase it from a license holder having M.A.-1, M.A.-2 and M.A.-3
license but in the present case, petitioner purchased the methyl alcohol from unlicensed suppliers.
9. So far as the contention of learned counsel for the petitioner that Rules 17-B and 17-D of Rules
1921 are beyond the scope and power of the State Government is concerned, for that purpose, it is
necessary to consider Sections 2, 3 and 8 of the Poisons Act, 1919. Section 2 of the Poisons Act, 1919
authorizes the State Government to frame rules for regulating the possession for sale and sale of
Methyl alcohol, and Section 3 authorizes the Central Government to frame rules regarding the
regulation of the purchase of poison from outside the country which is not the case herein and
Section 8 of Poisons Act, 1919 further authorizes the State to make rules in addition to the rule
making power u/s 2 of the Poisons Act, 1919. Except the area covered u/s 3 of the Poisons Act, 1919
for carrying out the purpose and object of the Poisons Act, 1919. Therefore, it is absolutely clear that,
except to regulate the import of methyl alcohol from outside India, the State Government is
authorized to frame rules to regulate, sell, purchase and possession of poison. Sections 2, 3 and 8 of
Poisons Act, 1919 are being quoted as under :
2. Power of the State Government to regulate possession for sale and sale of any
poison.--(1) The State Government may by rule regulate within the whole or any part
of the territories under its administration the possession for sale and the sale,
whether wholesale or retail, of any specified poison.
(2) In particular, and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power, such rules may
provide for--
(a) the grant of licences to possess any specified poison for sale, wholesale or retail, and fixing of the
fee (if any) to be charged for such licences ;
(b) the classes of persons to whom alone such licences may be granted ;
(c) the classes of persons to whom alone any such poison may be sold ;
(d) the maximum quantity of any such poison which may be sold to any one person ;
(e) the maintenance by vendors of any such poison of registers of sales, the particulars to be entered
in such registers, and the inspection of the same ;
(f) the safe custody of such poisons and the labelling of the vessels, packages or coverings in which
any such poison is sold or possessed for sale ; and
(g) the inspection and examination of any such poison when possessed for sale by any such vendor.

3. Power to prohibit importation into the States of any poison except under licence.--The Central
Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, prohibit, except under and in accordance
with the conditions of a licence, the importation into [India] [across any customs frontier defined by
the Central Government] of any specified poison, and may by rule regulate the grant of licences.
8. Rules.--(1) In addition to any other power to make rules hereinbefore conferred the State
Government may make rules generally to carry out the purposes and objects of this Act [except
section 3] (2) Every power to make rules conferred by this Act shall be subject to the condition of the
rules being made after previous publication.
(3) All rules made by the Central Government or by the State Government under this Act shall be
published in the [Official Gazette] and on such publication shall have effect as if enacted in this Act.
[(4) Every rule made by the Central Government under this Act shall be laid, as soon as may be after
it is made, before each House of Parliament, while it is in session, for a total period of thirty days
which may be comprised in one session or in two or more successive sessions and if, before the
expiry of the session immediately following the session or the successive sessions aforesaid, both
Houses agree in making any modification in the rule or both Houses agree that the rule should not
be made, the rule shall thereafter have effect only in such modified form or be of no effect, as the
case may be; so, however, that any such modification or annulment shall be without prejudice to the
validity of anything previously done under that rule. rule.
(5) Every rule made by the State Government under this Act shall be laid, as soon as may be after it
is made, before the State Legislature.]
10. From the perusal of Rules 17-B and 17-D of Rules 1921, it is clear that these rules were framed in
the exercise of power u/s 2 and 8 of Poisons Act, 1919. Therefore, the contention of learned counsel
for the petitioner that Rules 17-B and 17-D of Rules 1921 are ultra vires being beyond the scope and
power of the State Government, is misconceived, hence is rejected.
11. In view of the above analysis, this Court holds that Rule 17-B(b), 17-B(c) and 17-D(d) of Rules
1921, are within the scope and power of the State Government u/s 2 and 8 of the Poisons Act, 1919.
12. So far as the contention of learned counsel for the petitioner that Rule 17-F of Rules 1921 by
which power of confiscation of Methyl alcohol by the District Magistrate, which was acquired,
stored, sold, or used by any person or industry in contravention of the provisions of Rules 1921, is
beyond the scope of Section 6 of the Poisons Act, 1919, is concerned, to decide this issue, it is
relevant to mention that initially Poisons (Regulation of Possession and Sale) Rules 1921 was framed
in the exercise of power u/s 2 of the Poisons Act, 1919. Subsequently, by way of amendment dated
27.07.1995, Rule 17 to 17-I were added as special provisions with respect to Methyl alcohol in
exercise of power u/s 2 r/w 8 of Poisons Act, 1919. Rule 17-F of Rules 1921 provides specific power of
confiscation to District Magistrate regarding Methyl alcohol, which was acquired, stored, sold, or
used by any person or industry in contravention of the provisions of these rules. Thereafter, Rule
17-H of Rules 1921, further provides prosecution and punishment as per the provisions of Section 6
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/80572777/ 6
M/S Jubilant Life Sciences Limited vs State Of U.P. Thru Principal Secy Excise ... on 28 March, 2025
of the Poisons Act, 1919, which was related to the violation of Rules 2 and 3 of the Poisons Act. Rule
17-F and Rule 17-H of Rules 1921 are being quoted as under :-
17-F. Confiscation - Any Authorised Officer, if satisfied that Methyl Alcohol has been
acquired, stored, sold or used by any person or industry in contravention of the
provisions of these rules, will be competent to take possession of the same and report
the matter to the District Magistrate. The District Magistrate will be competent to
confiscate or get destroyed the same same in the presence of the Authorised Officer.
17-H. Prosecution and punishment - Any person found in possession of Methyl
Alcohol in contravention of these rules shall be liable for prosecution and
punishment under the provisions of the Poisons Act, 1919 (Act No.XII of 1919), as
amended from time to time.
13. From the perusal of the above quoted rules, it is clear that these rules provide special provisions
with respect to Methyl alcohol, though these rules do not apply to other poison which is not methyl
alcohol. For that reason, special power of confiscation has been provided under Rule 17-F, but for
other punishment, provision of Section 6 of the Poisons Act has been adopted by Rule 17-H of the
amended Rules 1921. This Court also holds that power of confiscation is not contrary to Section 6 of
the Poisons Act and is valid. Therefore, the contention of learned counsel for the petitioner that Rule
17-F is beyond the provisions of Section 6 of Poisons Act, 1919, so far as confiscation is concerned, is
absolutely misconceived and, hence, rejected.
14. In the present case, it is not in dispute that the petitioner has purchased the methyl alcohol from
a supplier based within the State who does not have an M.A.-1, M.A.-2 or M.A.-3 license and also
procured methyl alcohol from a supplier based outside the State without having M.A.-2 license.
Therefore, prima facie, there is a violation of provisions of Rules 1921 and for reason there appears
to be no illegality in show cause notice/order. However, the impugned order is simply a show cause
notice by which the license of the petitioner has been suspended. The petitioner can file an objection
against that show cause notice or appeal under Rule 17-I.
15. Given the above, the present writ petition is disposed of with liberty to the petitioner to file an
objection or appeal against the show cause notice within 15 days. In case such objection or appeal is
filed by the petitioner against the impugned show cause notice, the same shall be considered and
decided by the District Magistrate within the next one month without being influenced by the
observation made hereinabove.
