ORDER
The petitioner seeks a writ of mandamus to direct the third and fourth respondents i.e., the Director
of Agriculture, Chennai and the Deputy Director of Horticulture, Dindigul to get ratification of the
Government for fixing the petitioner's pay on par with his junior as per proceedings No.A1/1752/15
dated 04.12.2018 of the Deputy Director of Horticulture, Dindigul and to resubmit the proposals to
the Accountant General, Chennai within a specified time frame and on receipt of the revised
proposals, the Accountant General, Chennai shall arrange to disburse the revised pensionary
benefits, within a specified time frame.
2.The case of the petitioner is that he was lastly serving as Deputy Horticulture Officer under the
control of the Deputy Director of Horticulture, Dindigul and allowed to retire peacefully on
http://www.judis.nic.in 30.04.2013 on attaining the age of superannuation. Regarding the anomaly
of junior getting more pay than seniors crept in the petitioner's case on 01.01.2010 in the post of
Deputy Horticulture Officer in the revised scale of pay, the Government in letter No.
3062/AA4(2)/2014-5, dated 11.12.2014, clearly accepted that due to restructuring at the
department, the seniors were directly promoted as Deputy Horticultural Officers, which is purely on
administrative grounds and therefore, the higher quantum of pay benefits accrued by the juniors
cannot be denied to the seniors merely on the ground that there is no provision in the Fundamental
Rule to rectify this anomaly. The Government also issued orders that there is no objection to refix
the pay of seniors in this case in the pay scale of Rs.18,000/-+ Grade pay of Rs.4,700/- with effect
from 01.01.2010 and gave direction to the Director of Agriculture, Chennai to rectify the anomalies
at his level for the post of Deputy Horticultural Officer under the ambit of Rule 5(2) of Tamil Nadu
Revised Scales of Pay Rules, 2009 and such cases need not be referred to Government since the
Director of Agriculture, Chennai is the appointing authority to the above said post. Based on the
above said orders of the Government, the Director of Agriculture, Chennai in his proceedings in
br.K.M.vz;.ntmg1/148245/2015 ehs; 20.07.2018 has refixed the petitioner's scale of pay and
directed the Deputy Director of http://www.judis.nic.in Horticulture, Dindigul to send revised
pension proposals to the Accountant General, Chennai. Accordingly, the Deputy Director of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128682032/ 2
K.Marimuthu vs The Agricultural Production ... on 22 January, 2020
Horticulture, Dindigul has also sent revised pension proposals to the Accountant General, Chennai.
But the Accountant General, Chennai in his letter No.P07/1/10722905/ADK/251 dated 04.12.2019,
returned the proposals stating that after retirement, Government alone is the competent authority
for ordering stepping up of pay of senior on par with junior and that the head of the department is
not competent to pass such an order. Hence, this writ petition is filed.
3.Heard the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner, the learned Additional Government
Pleader appearing for the respondents 1, 3 and 4 and the learned counsel appearing for the fourth
respondent and perused the materials available on record.
4.The fact that the petitioner's pay was refixed on par with the juniors as per the order of the 4th
respondent, dated 04.12.2018, is not in dispute. The grievance of the petitioner is that the second
respondent had returned the pension proposals on the ground that the refixation has to be approved
by the Government. The said return has been made on 04.12.2019.

5.In view of the same, there will be a direction to the respondents 3 and 4 to comply with the returns
by getting ratification from the Government for fixing the petitioner's pay on par with the juniors as
per the proceedings of the 4th respondent, dated 04.12.2018, and represent the proposals within a
period of twelve weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order. On receipt of the proposals,
the second respondent shall disburse the pensionary benefits, if the proposals are in order, within a
period of eight weeks there from.
6.The writ petition is disposed of accordingly. No costs.
