1. By the medium of instant petition filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure
(hereinafter referred as a 'code'), petitioners seek quashment of order dated 22.02.2021 passed by
the learned JMIC (Sub- Registrar) Jammu in Application No. 2941/2021 whereby directions have
been issued to SHO Police Station Women Cell Gandhi Nagar Jammu to verify the matter and take
necessary action against the petitioners as per law under section 156(3) of CrPC, as well as the FIR
No.0029/2021 dated 02.07.2021 registered at Police Station Women Cell Gandhi Nagar Jammu
against the petitioners u/ss 498-A, 313, 323, 342, 506 & 109 IPC on the following grounds:-

petitioners 2 to 6 are the family members of the petitioner No.l, the marriage of the
petitioner No.l with respondent No.2 was solemnized in accordance with Sikh rites
and customs at Jammu on 16.01.2011, out of their wedlock a female child was born
on 23.09.2012 now she is eight years old, the marriage of them was a dowry-less
marriage however respondent No.2 on her own brought a Santro Car as well as gold
ornaments and clothing items;
(ii) that just after three days of the marriage, respondent no.2 demanded Rs.1.50 lac from the
petitioner No.l for making investment of the same in some finance company through her father, as
the father of the respondent no. 2 is a businessman and is dealing with some finance company,
petitioner No.l was assured that 5% interest would be fetched on the said investment, petitioner No.l
looking to the fact that his marriage with respondent no.2 has solemnized just three days back
therefore he advanced Rs.1.50 lac to respondent no.2 notwithstanding the fact that petitioner No.l

started harassing and pressurizing him to settle in Canada and also to take her with him to Canada
on the pretext that her elder sister is married and settled in Canada, since it was not possible for
petitioner No.l to settle in Canada therefore he made respondent No.2 to leave the idea of settling in
Canada;

by stating totally wrong, baseless and vexatious facts, maintained the said application and further
respondent No 2 enclosed the complaint dated 06.01.2021 with the application under section 156(3)
which she forwarded to SHO Bishnah, so respondent No 2 has not complied the mandatory
requirements of the section 156(3), respondent No.l on receipt of the impugned order dated
22.02.2021 without holding any preliminary enquiry or investigation into the allegations alleged in
the complaint believed the allegations as gospel truth and registered the impugned FIR No. 0029 of

5. The Apex Court in the case of "B. S. Joshi & others Vs State of Haryana and another", [(2003) 4
SCC 675], while discussing the ambit and scope of inherent powers of High Courts under Section
482 CPC in paras 1, 3, 11, 14, 15 and 16 held as under:
"1.The question that falls for determination in the instant case is about the ambit of
the inherent powers of the High Courts under Section 482, Code of Criminal
Procedure (Code) read with Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India to
quash criminal proceedings. The scope and ambit of power under Section 482 has
been examined by this Court in catena of earlier decisions but in the present case that
is required to be considered in relation to matrimonial disputes. The matrimonial
disputes of the kind in the present case have been on considerable increase in recent
times resulting in filing of complaints by the wife under Sections 498A and 406, IPC
not only against the husband but his other family members also. When such matters
are resolved either by wife agreeing to rejoin the matrimonial home or mutual
separation of husband and wife and also mutual settlement of other pending disputes
as a result whereof both sides approach the High Court and jointly pray for quashing
of the criminal proceedings or the First Information Report or complaint filed by the
wife under Sections 498A and 406, IPC, can the prayer be declined on the ground
that since the offences are non-compoundable under Section 320 of the Code and,
therefore, it is not permissible for the Court to quash the criminal proceedings or FIR
or complaint.
3.The High Court has, by the impugned judgment, dismissed the petition filed by the
appellants seeking quashing of the FIR for in view of the High Court the offences
under Sections 498A and 406 IPC are non-compoundable and the inherent powers
under Section 482 of the Code cannot be invoked to bypass the mandatory provision
of Section 320 of the Code. For its view, the High Court has referred to and relied
upon the decisions of this Court in State of Haryana & Ors. v. Bhajan Lal & Ors. [1992
Supp.(1) SCC 335]; Madhu Limaye v. The State of Maharashtra [(1977) 4 SCC 551;
and Surendra Nath Mohanty & Anr. v. State of Orissa [AIR 1999 SC 2181].
11.In Madhavrao Jiwajirao Scindia & Ors. v. Sambhajirao Chandrojirao Angre & Ors.
[(1988) 1 SCC 692], it was held that while exercising inherent power of quashing
under Section 482, it is for the High Court to take into consideration any special
features which appear in a particular case to consider whether it is expedient and in
the interest of justice to permit a prosecution to continue. Where, in the opinion of
the Court, chances of an ultimate conviction is bleak and, therefore, no useful
purpose is likely to be served by allowing a criminal prosecution to continue, the
court may, while taking into consideration the special facts of a case, also quash the
proceedings.
14.There is no doubt that the object of introducing Chapter XX-A containing Section
498A in the Indian Penal Code was to prevent the torture to a woman by her husband
or by relatives of her husband. Section 498A was added with a view to punishing a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64436105/ 7
S. Varinder Singh & Ors vs Ut Of J&K & Anr on 27 March, 2023
husband and his relatives who harass or torture the wife to coerce her or her relatives
to satisfy unlawful demands of dowry. The hyper-technical view would be
counterproductive and would act against interests of women and against the object
for which this provision was added. There is every likelihood that non-exercise of
inherent power to quash the proceedings to meet the ends of justice would prevent
women from settling earlier. That is not the object of Chapter XXA of Indian Penal
Code.
15.In view of the above discussion, we hold that the High Court in exercise of its
inherent powers can quash criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint and Section
320 of the Code does not limit or affect the powers under Section 482 of the Code.
16.For the foregoing reasons, we set aside the impugned judgment and allow the
appeal and quash the FIR above mentioned."
6. Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in a case titled Gian Singh Vs. State of Punjab and Another [2012
(10) SCC 303] while considering the aspect whether High Court has power to quash the proceedings
when some of the offences alleged to have been committed are non-compoundable in nature,
observed as under:-
"57. The position that emerges from the above discussion can be summarized thus:
the power of the High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint
in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to
a criminal court for compounding the offences under Section 320 of the Code.
Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be
exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz;
(i) to secure the ends of justice or
(ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court.
In what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be exercised where
the offender and victim have settled their dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances of
each case and no category can be prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the High
Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of
mental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. cannot be fittingly quashed even though
the victim or victim's family and the offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are not private
in nature and have serious impact on society. Similarly, any compromise between the victim and
offender in relation to the offences under special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or the
offences committed by public servants while working in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any
basis for quashing criminal proceedings involving such offences. But the criminal cases having
overwhelmingly and pre- dominatingly civil flavour stand on different footing for the purposes of
quashing, particularly the offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64436105/ 8
S. Varinder Singh & Ors vs Ut Of J&K & Anr on 27 March, 2023
or such like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry, etc. or the
family disputes where the wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the parties have
resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings
if in its view, because of the compromise between the offender and victim, the possibility of
conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal case would put accused to great
oppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the
criminal case despite full and complete settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words,
the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to
continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of the criminal proceeding would tantamount
to abuse of process of law despite settlement and compromise between the victim and wrongdoer
and whether to secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put to an end and if
the answer to the above question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its
jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding".
7. Ratios of the judgments (supra) make the legal proposition manifestly clear, that the High Court
has inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to quash the proceedings
to meet the ends of justice if the parties have settled their disputes amicably by a compromise.
Applying the ratios of judgments (Supra) to the facts of the case in hand, it is apt to reiterate here,
that petitioners and respondent No.2 have entered into compromise, resolved their entire dispute,
thereby, the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation of criminal proceedings
would put the parties to great oppression and prejudice. It would be unfair or contrary to the
interest of justice to continue with the criminal proceedings or continuation of the criminal
proceedings would tantamount to abuse of process of law despite the settlement and compromise
between the parties, and it is therefore, appropriate, that the criminal cases between the parties are
put to an end. In view of the above, instant petition stands allowed. Consequently, order dated
22.02.2021 passed by learned JMIC (Sub-Registrar) Jammu in application u/s 156(3) CrPC titled
"Sarabjeet Kour vs Varinder Singh & Ors" alongwith all the proceedings arising out of FIR No. 0029
of 2021 registered at Police Station Women Cell Gandhi Nagar Jammu against the petitioners and
pending in the Court of learned JMIC (Sub-Registrar) Jammu in view of the compromise arrived at
between the parties stand quashed.
8. Disposed off accordingly. Copy of this order be sent to the court below for information and
compliance.
