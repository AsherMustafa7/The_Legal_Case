"1. Heard Mr. Praveen Kumar Mishra, learned counsel for the applicants and Mr.

13.01.2020 and N.B.W. order dated 04.01.2023 as well as entire proceedings of Case

Magistrate-VIII, Kanpur Nagar, in pursuance of compromise deed dated 03.09.2024.
3. Learned counsel for the applicants submits that the parties have amicably settled
their dispute and a compromise has been entered into between the parties. After the
aforesaid, applicant no.1 and opposite party no.2 have decided to live together. The
copy of the said compromise/mutual deed, filed before the court below, is annexed as
Annexure No. 4 to this application. Therefore, continuance of proceedings against the
applicants would be a futile exercise and wastage of time of the Court and will be
abuse of process of law. Hence, proceedings of the aforesaid case be quashed in the
light of law laid down by the Apex Court in the case of Gian Singh v. State of Punjab
reported in (2012) 10 SCC 303.
4. Learned AGA as well as learned counsel for opposite party no.2 also does not
dispute the correctness of the submissions made by the learned counsel for the
applicants.
5. Whether a compromise has taken place or not can at best be ascertained by the
court, where the proceedings are pending, after ensuring the presence of the parties
before it.
6. In view of the above, both the parties are directed to appear before the court below
along with copy of compromise deed as well as a certified copy of this order. It is
expected that the trial court may fix a date for the verification of the compromise and
after ensuring the presence of parties, pass an appropriate order with respect to the
same in accordance with law, after hearing the informant, as expeditiously as
possible, preferably within a period of four weeks from today. While passing the
order verifying the compromise, the concerned court shall also record the statement
of the parties as to whether all the terms and conditions mentioned in the original
compromise deed, so filed, have been fulfilled or not?
7. Upon due verification of compromise, the court below may pass appropriate order
in that regard and send a report to this Court.
8. Put up this case on 28.01.2025, as fresh.

Kanpur Nagar dated 13.01.2025 has been placed on record along with order dated 10.01.2025 vide
which compromise has been verified between the parties.

parties has been verified by the court below, the entire proceedings of the aforesaid criminal case
may be quashed by this Court.
6. Learned A.G.A. for the State also accept that the parties have entered into a compromise and the
copy of the same has also been enclosed along with verification order, they have no objection, if the
proceedings in the aforesaid case are quashed.
7. This Court is not unmindful of the following judgements of the Apex Court:
(i). B.S. Joshi and others Vs. State of Haryana and Another; (2003)4 SCC 675,
(ii). Nikhil Merchant Vs. Central Bureau of Investigation; (2008) 9 SCC 677,

8. In the aforesaid judgments, the Apex Court has categorically held that compromise can be made
between the parties even in respect of certain cognizable and non compoundable offences. Reference
may also be made to the decision given by this Court in Shaifullah and Others Vs. State of U.P. &
Another; 2013 (83) ACC 278 and Pramod & Another Vs. State of U.P. & Another (Application U/S
482 No.12174 of 2020, decided on 23rd February, 2021) and Daxaben Vs. State of Gujarat, reported
in 2022 SCC Online SC 936 in which the law expounded by the Apex court in the aforesaid cases has
been explained in detail.
9. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, as noted herein above, and also the
submissions made by the counsel for the parties, the court is of the considered opinion that no
useful purpose shall be served by prolonging the proceedings of the above mentioned criminal case
as the parties have already settled their dispute.
10. Accordingly, the charge-sheet dated 13.01.2020 and N.B.W. order dated 04.01.2023 as well as
entire proceedings of Case No.22171 of 2020 (State Vs. Neeraj Kumar Gupta and others), arising out
