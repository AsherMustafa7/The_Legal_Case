2011. The petitioner has further prayed for a direction to the
respondent nos.1 to 4 to appoint the petitioner on the post of
Sub-Inspector of Police treating him in the OBC category as the
petitioner has submitted the requisite certificates showing him
belonging to OBC category and not belonging to creamy layer.
3. The case of the petitioner in brief is that pursuant to
the respondents coming out with an Advertisement no.704 of
2004 for appointment on the post of Sub-Inspector of Police, the
petitioner filed his application claiming reservation in the BC
category. He was allotted Roll no.D02053 and was declared
successful in the physical test.
4. It is the case of the petitioner that subsequently the
Commission issued information in the newspaper directing the
candidates who were successful in the physical test to purchase
'OMR' (Optical Mark Recognition) sheet and to submit the
same. It is the case of the petitioner that he purchased the OMR
sheet, filled it up and attaching the relevant documents
submitted the same to the authorities which was accepted by the
Commission. It is the case of the petitioner that as the certificate
that the petitioner does not belong to creamy layer (in short 'the
creamy layer certificate') was not issued by the Collector, he
submitted the caste and creamy layer certificate issued by the
Patna High Court CWJC No.15103 of 2013 dt.13-10-2025

SDO, Samastipur.
5. An admit card was issued in favour of the petitioner
and the petitioner appeared in the written test conducted.
However, in the result published on 30.5.2008, the roll number
of the petitioner did not figure. It is the case of the petitioner
that pursuant to some applications having been filed in the High
Court another result was published in the newspaper on
1.2.2009
wherein once again, the roll number of the petitioner did not figure. As per the petitioner's case,
though the petitioner had secured 227.24 marks which was higher than the cut-off marks for his
category which was 223.26, it is submitted that the petitioner had been wrongly not recommended
by the Commission.
6. Several candidates filed different cases in the Patna High Court and on orders being passed,
appeals were preferred finally leading to order dated 21.4.2011 being passed in LPA no.416 of 2009.
7. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the Division Bench of this Court held in its order
dated 21.4.2011 (Annexure-3) that as per the terms of the advertisement the appellants/candidates
should have been given the opportunity to submit their required certificates during the process of
Patna High Court CWJC No.15103 of 2013 dt.13-10-2025 appointment. It accordingly set aside the
order of the learned Single Judge and directed the respondents to accommodate the
appellants/candidates in their respective places, however making it clear that the
appellants/candidates will have to submit the relevant certificates duly issued by the District
Magistrate or if it is issued by the SDO, the same should be countersigned by the concerned District
Magistrate within the time stipulated by the respondents.
8. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner should also be given similar
opportunity and that this Court by its order dated 20.8.2025 passed in CWJC no.2372 of 2023 has
directed the respondents to give appointment to the 186 petitioners therein on the post of
Sub-Inspector under Advertisement no.704 of 2004, if they are found medically fit. As such, it is
prayed that similar directions be issued in the case of the petitioner herein.
9. In response, it is submitted by learned counsel for the respondents that so far as the petitioner is
concerned, he did not submit his creamy layer certificate and therefore his candidature was not
considered under the reserved category. Further reference has been made to the order dated
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/18223765/ 3
Amrendra Kumar vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 13 October, 2025
14.9.2017 passed in Civil Appeal no.2795-2797 of 2017 and other cases Patna High Court CWJC
No.15103 of 2013 dt.13-10-2025 wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court directed that the Registry shall
not entertain any petition/application, either impleadment or reopening or review in respect of the
selection of Sub- Inspectors for the year 2004, without express permission from the Court. It is
further submitted that in another case by its order dated 1.11.2018 passed in Contempt Pet. (C)
no.1711 of 2018 and other cases the Hon'ble Supreme Court while observing that the applicants are
free to make representations appealing to the good conscience of the State of Bihar and that the
State of Bihar was free to consider the same and pass appropriate orders in accordance with law, it
was observed that in case the representations are rejected, the same will not give rise to any
proceedings/appeals in any of the Courts.
10. It is thus submitted by learned counsel appearing for the respondents that the matter being stale
relating to an appointment arising out of an advertisement of the year 2004 and the specific case of
the respondents that the petitioner had not submitted his certificate of not belonging to the creamy
layer, no relief be granted in the instant application and the same be dismissed.
11. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the material on record.
Patna High Court CWJC No.15103 of 2013 dt.13-10-2025
12. The matter in the instant application relates to appointment on the post of Sub-Inspector of
Police in view of the Advertisement no.704 of 2004. Even as per the case of the petitioner, though he
submitted all the relevant documents along with the OMR sheet as permitted by order dated
21.4.2011 passed in LPA no.416 of 2009, he could not submit the caste and creamy layer certificate
of the Collector as the same was not issued but only submitted the caste and creamy layer certificate
issued by the SDO, Samastipur.
13. It further transpires from the records of the case that the petitioner submitted his caste
certificate (Annexure-5) showing him not to belong to the creamy layer issued by the District
Magistrate only after 22.7.2010. It further transpires from the contents of the counter affidavit filed
on behalf of the respondent-Commission that the petitioner not having submitted the certificate of
his not belonging to creamy layer, his candidature could not be considered under the reserved
category. This statement made in the counter affidavit filed by the Commission has not been
controverted by the petitioner inspite of a copy of the same having been served on learned counsel
for the petitioner on 3.5.2024.
14. In addition to the above, the Court finds that Patna High Court CWJC No.15103 of 2013
dt.13-10-2025 relying on a coordinate Bench decision of this Court, the writ application filed by
eight petitioners was dismissed vide order dated 23.2.2021 passed in CWJC no.12804 of 2019. The
order dated 23.2.2021 is reproduced herein below for ready reference :-
"The issue raised in the present writ application was also the subject matter of of
2019 and vide order dated 11.04.2019, a co- ordinate Bench of this Court has
dismissed the said writ application. The relevant paragraphs of the order is quoted
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/18223765/ 4
Amrendra Kumar vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 13 October, 2025
hereinbelow:-
"4. The petitioners have approached this Court for a direction to the respondent
authorities to appoint them on the post of Sub-Inspectors in Bihar Police after
exempting them from PET test against an advertisement which was issued in the year
2004 by the Bihar Staff Selection Commission, Patna.
5. Similar such matters were decided by this Court and by order dated 02.04.2019,
this Court, taking into account the orders passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
various petitions as also Contempt Petition (C) No. 1711 of 2018, dismissed such
petitions on the ground of the matter being stale and the selection process as against
the advertisement of 2004 having been completed a long time ago.
6. Mr. Nilendu Kumar Choudhary, Patna High Court CWJC No.15103 of 2013
dt.13-10-2025 learned counsel for the petitioners however taking exception to the
observations made in the order dated 02.04.2019 passed in C.W.J.C. No. 5186 of
2019, which has been referred to in the preceding paragraph, has stated and
informed this Court that even after the aforesaid direction of the Supreme Court on
01.11.2018 directing that in case of refusal of the State Government to accede to the
request of the petitioners therein, they would have no further right to agitate their
claim before any Court, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has, in two matters, entertained
such petitions. In one such case, an order was passed directing the petitioner therein
to withdraw the writ petition from the High Court. In the other case, which has been
entertained by the Supreme Court after the order dated 01.11.2018, notices have been
issued to the Commission.
7. In any view of the matter, considering the fact that the issue now stands closed
with the selection process having been completed long time back, this Court is not
inclined to entertain such petitions seeking appointment on the post of
Sub-Inspectors against the advertisement of the year 2004."
In order to maintain consistency, the present writ petition is also dismissed in similar terms."
15. In view of the facts and circumstances stated here in above, the matter relating to an
appointment against an Patna High Court CWJC No.15103 of 2013 dt.13-10-2025 advertisement of
the year 2004 together with the statement made in the counter affidavit filed by the respondents not
having been rebutted by the petitioner, the Court finds no merit in the instant application.
16. The application is dismissed.
