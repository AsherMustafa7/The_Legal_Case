Special Court, Thoubal and being aggrieved by the impugned order, the petitioners approached this
Court by way of the present Bail Applications. During pendency of the present cases, on the
direction of the Hon'ble Supreme Court dated 25th August, 2023, the present FIR has been
transferred to the Special Court at Gauhati. Mr. W. Darakishwor, learned Sr.PCCG informed this
Court that CBI has submitted charge sheet against the accused to Special Court at Gauhati and he
has raised the question of maintainability of the present Bail Applications before this Court in view
of the transfer of the whole FIR case to Special Court at Gauhati. [3] Mr. M. Hemchandra, learned
senior counsel for the petitioner in Bail Application No.26 of 2023 and Mr. N. Jotendro, learned
senior counsel for the petitioner in Bail Application No.23 of 2023 clarify that this Court has still
jurisdiction to consider the Bail Applications as the impugned order was passed by a Special Court
at Thoubal which is under the jurisdiction of this Court.
[4] Before proceeding to the merit of the case, this Court is of the opinion to examine whether the
present Bail Applications arising out of the order passed by Special Court at Thoubal can be
considered by this Court even if the whole FIR case was transferred to Special Court at Gauhati by
an order of the Hon'ble Supreme Court dated 25th August, 2023.
[5] In the circumstances, it will be appropriate first to examine whether this Court has jurisdiction
to consider the Bail Applications after the whole FIR is transferred to Special Court at Gauhati. [6]
List these cases on 30th October, 2023 for consideration of the question of jurisdiction.
