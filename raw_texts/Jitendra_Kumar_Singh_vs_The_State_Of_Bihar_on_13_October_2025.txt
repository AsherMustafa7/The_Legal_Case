Jitendra Kumar Singh vs The State Of Bihar on 13 October, 2025
ORAL JUDGMENT
(Per: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE)
Patna High Court L.P.A No.170 of 2022 dt.13-10-2025
2/4
Date : 13-10-2025
On 23.09.2025 we have passed the following order:
"In the light of our earlier order
dated 06.05.2025, Additional counter affidavit
has been filed on behalf of respondent nos. 4, 5
and 7 along with a report at Annexure-R/A, in
which they have come to the conclusion that
the appellant's appointment was on ad hoc
basis with reference to advertisement read with
the fact that Director, Industrial Safety
Management, Patna University is not the
competent authority to issue advertisement,
selection and appointment like appellant
herein. The aforementioned material
information cannot be appreciated at this
distance of time, for the reason, that in favour
of the appellant there are two documents
which reveals that appellant has been
appointed on probation for a period of two
years. A person can be appointed on probation
only against a permanent post. That apart, on
20.02.1991
the very same Director Industrial Safety Management, Patna University regularized the petitioner's
service w.e.f. 13.02.1991. In this backdrop, no action has been taken against the then Director,
Industrial Safety Management, Patna University. For the first time all these issues are racked up in
the present litigation. Patna High Court L.P.A No.170 of 2022 dt.13-10-2025
2. Be that as it may, having extracted the work from the appellant, he is entitled to certain monetary
benefits. Perusal of order of appointment one has to draw inference that he has been appointed
against a regular post and on regular basis. Even assuming that he was appointed on ad hoc basis in
the year 1989, his services have been regularized w.e.f., 13.02.1991 on 20.02.1991. Therefore, the
University authorities are hereby directed to extend service and monetary benefits in the light of our
previous order dated 06.05.2025 or in the alternative bring a proposal insofar as payment of lump
sum amount of Rs. 10 Lakhs to the appellant for rendering service from the year 1989 till retirement
or attaining the age of superannuation.
3. Re-list this matter on 08.10.2025."

2. Learned counsel for respondent no.8 furnished a cheque bearing no.828219 of Indian Bank in
favour of Jitendra Kumar Singh, a sum of Rs.10,00,000/-(Ten Lakhs) and the same has been
handed over to the learned counsel for the appellant
-Jitendra Kuamr Singh.
3. In the light of these facts and circumstances, the present LPA stands disposed of. The
aforementioned amount is Patna High Court L.P.A No.170 of 2022 dt.13-10-2025 settled with
appellant as one time and final settlement with the respondent no.8.
4. With the above observation, LPA stands disposed of.
In the event of return of the cheque for any reasons in that event, appellant is at liberty to file
interlocutory application to revive this order.
