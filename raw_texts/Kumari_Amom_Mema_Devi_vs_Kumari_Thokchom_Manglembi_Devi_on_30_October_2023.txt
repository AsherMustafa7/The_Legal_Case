[2]. O.S.No.105 of 2017 has been filed by the petitioner
against the respondents for recovery of a sum of Rs.25,07,500/- together with interest and costs. By
the judgment and decree, the said suit was dismissed on 21.12.2019. Aggrieved by the same, the
petitioner has filed the appeal along with petition for condonation of the delay of 415 days.
[3]. Mr. K. Modhusudon, the learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the judgment and
decree of the suit was not declared on 21.12.2019, however, the e-court status, it was shown that the
said case was disposed of on 21.12.2019 as uncontested. The learned counsel would submit that the
suit was last listed on 15.5.2019 and fixed on 6.6.2019 for orders. However, the order was not
declared on 6.6.2019 and subsequently fixed the dates on 10.7.2019, 14.8.2019, 10.9.2019,
19.10.2019, 8.11.2019, 17.12.2019 and 21.12.2019. Thereafter, the learned counsel for the petitioner
requested the Court regarding the matter on several occasions and the Court also informed that the
matter would be checked, however, despite several efforts, the case was untraceable.
MC(MFA) No.1 of 2023 Page 2
[4]. The learned counsel further submitted that after
closing the Court since March, 2020 due to Covid-19 pandemic, the Court works were totally
suspended. In the month of September, 2021 while some restrictions were removed, the learned
counsel for the petitioner approached the concerned staff of the Court, but the file could not be
traceable. On 23.9.2021, the learned counsel for the petitioner filed a complaint before the Registrar
General of the High Court for giving appropriate direction to the concerned staff of the trial Court to
trace the file of the suit. However, no order was declared till 23.9.2021. After the filing of the
complaint before the Registrar General on 23.9.2021, the learned counsel for the petitioner
approached the Registry of the Civil Judge on 18.10.2021 and one of the staff namely Anil informed
that the case record was now found, however, no order is available in the case file. Thereafter, on
26.10.2021, the learned counsel for the petitioner came to know that the suit was disposed of on
21.12.2019 in favour of the respondents while he was informed by the said staff. On the same day,
the learned counsel for the petitioner applied the certified copy of the judgment and the same was
received on 8.11.2021.
MC(MFA) No.1 of 2023 Page 3
[5]. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that
due to bonafide mistake, the petitioner has filed an appeal against the judgment and decree dated
21.12.2019 along with delay condonation application in Judicial Misc. Case No.64 of 2021 on
24.11.2021 before the District Judge, Imphal West. The learned District Judge condoned the delay
and fixed the appeal, being RFA No.4 of 2022 an fixed the appeal for hearing. At the time of hearing,
the learned counsel for the petitioner withdraw the said appeal with liberty to file a fresh in the
competent Court having jurisdiction to file the case and, accordingly, RFA No.4 of 2022 was
disposed of on 25.1.2023. The learned counsel further submitted that thereafter, the petitioner has

Kumari Amom Mema Devi vs Kumari Thokchom Manglembi Devi on 30 October, 2023
filed the present appeal before this Court along with application for condonation of delay.
[6]. According to the learned counsel for the petitioner, the cause of delay in filing the present
appeal was beyond the capacity of the petitioner, as the case record was traceable only on
18.10.2021.The petitioner came to know that the case was disposed of only on 26.10.2021 and due to
bona fide mistake, the petitioner approached to the wrong forum. As such, the matter MC(MFA)
No.1 of 2023 Page 4 was pending before the learned District Judge, Imphal West from 24.11.2021 to
25.1.2023 and the certified copy of the order dated 25.1.2023 was applied on the same day and
received on 6.4.2023.
[7]. The learned counsel for the petitioner urged that the petitioner is an innocent and have no
negligence on her part for non-filing the appeal in time, but the same was caused by some
unavoidable circumstances and due to bonafide mistake the appeal was pending before the wrong
forum. As such, there was a delay of 1201 days in filing the present appeal from 21.12.2019 till
05.04.2023. The Hon'ble Supreme Court, vide order dated 10.1.2022 in MA.No.21 of 2022 in
Su-motu Writ Petition (c) No.3 of 2020, exempted the period from 15.3.2020 to 28.2.2022 for
limitation. According to the learned counsel, after excluding the exempted period of 715 days and
also the time taken for getting the certified copies i.e. 71 days, totally 786 days, a delay of 415 days
occurred in filing the present appeal. If the said delay is not condoned and the appeal is not
registered, the petitioner will put to irreparable loss and damage. Further, the said delay is neither
wilful nor wanton. Thus, a prayer has been made to condone the delay.
MC(MFA) No.1 of 2023 Page 5
[8]. This Court considered the submissions made by the
learned counsel for the petitioner and also perused the materials available on record.
[9]. The petitioner seeks to condone the delay of 415 days in filing the appeal on the ground that
despite several efforts, the case file was not traceable before the trial Court and after making
complaint before the Registrar General of this Court on 23.9.2021 and upon the information given
by one of the staff of the trial Court, only on 26.10.2021, the petitioner came to know the disposal of
the suit on 21.12.2019. Thereafter, the petitioner applied certified copy of the judgment and the
same was received on 8.11.2021. After the receipt of the certified copy of the judgment, the
petitioner has filed the appeal before the District Judge, Imphal West against the judgment dated
21.12.2019 with application for condonation of delay. After condoning the delay, the appeal was
numbered as RFA No.4 of 2022 and during the course of hearing, the petitioner came to know that
she has approached the wrong forum and, accordingly, the petitioner through her counsel
withdrawn the said appeal with liberty to file a fresh before the competent Court having jurisdiction
to file the MC(MFA) No.1 of 2023 Page 6 same. Accordingly, RFA No.4 of 2022 was dismissed as
withdrawn on 25.1.2023 with liberty to approach the appropriate forum. Thereafter, the petitioner
has filed the present appeal before this Court with delay condonation application. [10]. On a perusal
of the judgment of the trial Court, it is seen that the suit was taken up for hearing on 15.5.2019 and
the Court had delivered the judgment on 21.12.2019. It appears that the trial Court after a gap of
seven months has delivered the judgment in the suit. According to the petitioner, though the

Kumari Amom Mema Devi vs Kumari Thokchom Manglembi Devi on 30 October, 2023
judgment was delivered on 21.12.2019, physically the case record was not traceable when the
learned counsel verified with the Registry of the trial Court and at the time of verification, the
judgment and decree were not available in the case file. [11]. According to the learned counsel, due
to Covid-19 pandemic, the Court works were totally suspended since March, 2020 and in the month
of September, 2021, some restrictions were removed and during the month of September, 2021
when the learned counsel for the petitioner approached the trial Court, he could not able to find the
case file. Thereafter, the petitioner has filed a complaint before the Registrar General of this Court
and upon the intervention of this Court, the case file was traced.
MC(MFA) No.1 of 2023 Page 7 Only on 26.10.2021 only the petitioner's counsel was able to know
the disposal of the suit on 21.12.2019. [12]. The plea of the petitioner is that due to bona fide
mistake, she has filed the appeal before the District Court and after knowing the factum of
approaching the wrong forum, the said appeal was withdrawn with liberty to file the fresh before the
appropriate forum. In this regard,no contra evidence has been produced by the respondents.
Therefore, this Court is of the view that there is some substance in the plea of the petitioner. [13].
Application under Section 5 of the Limitation Act is to be construed liberally so as to do substantial
justice to the parties. In the present miscellaneous case, the applicants have stated the cause for the
delay, which is the sufficientcause [14]. The question as to what would be held to be sufficient cause
while considering the application for condonation of delay came up for consideration in the case
Esha Bhattacharjee v. Managing Committee of Raghunathpur Nafar Academy and others, (2013) 12
SCC 649, wherein upon considering the obligation of the Court while dealing with an application for
condonation of delay and the approach to be adopted while considering the grounds for
condonation, the MC(MFA) No.1 of 2023 Page 8 principles to be applied were summarized by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court as under:
"21. From the aforesaid authorities the principles that can broadly be culled out are:
21.1. (i) There should be a liberal, pragmatic, justice-oriented, non-pedantic approach
while dealing with an application for condonation of delay, for the courts are not
supposed to legalise injustice but are obliged to remove injustice.
21.2. (ii) The terms "sufficient cause"
should be understood in their proper spirit, philosophy and purpose regard being had to the fact
that these terms are basically elastic and are to be applied in proper perspective to the obtaining
fact-situation. 21.3. (iii) Substantial justice being paramount and pivotal the technical
considerations should not be given undue and uncalled for emphasis.
21.4. (iv) No presumption can be attached to deliberate causation of delay but, gross negligence on
the part of the counsel or litigant is to be taken note of.
21.5. (v) Lack of bona fides imputable to a party seeking condonation of delay is a significant and
relevant fact.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37327213/ 4
Kumari Amom Mema Devi vs Kumari Thokchom Manglembi Devi on 30 October, 2023
21.6. (vi) It is to be kept in mind that adherence to strict proof should not affect public justice and
cause public mischief because the courts are required to be vigilant so that in the ultimate eventuate
there is no real failure of justice.
21.7. (vii) The concept of liberal approach has to encapsulate the conception of reasonableness and it
cannot be allowed a totally unfettered free play.
MC(MFA) No.1 of 2023 Page 9 21.8. (viii) There is a distinction between inordinate delay and a
delay of short duration or few days, for to the former doctrine of prejudice is attracted whereas to
the latter it may not be attracted. That apart, the first one warrants strict approach whereas the
second calls for a liberal delineation.
21.9. (ix) The conduct, behaviour and attitude of a party relating to its inaction or negligence are
relevant factors to be taken into consideration. It is so as the fundamental principle is that the courts
are required to weigh the scale of balance of justice in respect of both parties and the said principle
cannot be given a total go by in the name of liberal approach.
21.10. (x) If the explanation offered is concocted or the grounds urged in the application are fanciful,
the courts should be vigilant not to expose the other side unnecessarily to face such a litigation.
21.11. (xi) It is to be borne in mind that no one gets away with fraud, misrepresentation or
interpolation by taking recourse to the technicalities of law of limitation.
21.12. (xii) The entire gamut of facts are to be carefully scrutinised and the approach should be
based on the paradigm of judicial discretion which is founded on objective reasoning and not on
individual perception.
21.13. (xiii) The State or a public body or an entity representing a collective cause should be given
some acceptable latitude.

[15]. In Collector, Land Acquisition, Anantnag and another
v. Katiji and others, (1987) 2 CC 107, the Hon'ble Supreme
Court held:
"3. The legislature has conferred the power to condone delay by enacting Section 5 [ Any appeal or
any application, other than an application under any of the provisions of Order XXI of the Code of
Civil Procedure, 1908, may be admitted after the prescribed period if the appellant or the applicant
satisfies the court that he had sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal or making the
application within such period.] of the Indian Limitation Act of 1963 in order to enable the courts to
do substantial justice to parties by disposing of matters on "merits". The expression "sufficient
cause" employed by the legislature is adequately elastic to enable the courts to apply the law in a
meaningful manner which subserves the ends of justice -- that being the life-purpose for the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37327213/ 5
Kumari Amom Mema Devi vs Kumari Thokchom Manglembi Devi on 30 October, 2023
existence of the institution of courts. It is common knowledge that this Court has been making a
justifiably liberal approach in matters instituted in this Court. But the message does not appear to
have percolated down to all the other courts in the hierarchy. And such a liberal approach is adopted
on principle as it is realized that:
"1. Ordinarily a litigant does not stand to benefit by lodging an appeal late.
2. Refusing to condone delay can result in a meritorious matter being thrown out at
the very threshold and cause of justice being defeated. As against this MC(MFA) No.1
of 2023 Page 11 when delay is condoned the highest that can happen is that a cause
would be decided on merits after hearing the parties.
3. "Every day's delay must be explained" does not mean that a pedantic approach
should be made. Why not every hour's delay, every second's delay? The doctrine must
be applied in a rational common sense pragmatic manner.
4. When substantial justice and technical considerations are pitted against each
other, cause of substantial justice deserves to be preferred for the other side cannot
claim to have vested right in injustice being done because of a non-deliberate delay.
5. There is no presumption that delay is occasioned deliberately, or on account of
culpable negligence, or on account of mala fides. A litigant does not stand to benefit
by resorting to delay. In fact he runs a serious risk.
6. It must be grasped that judiciary is respected not on account of its power to legalize
injustice on technical grounds but because it is capable of removing injustice and is
expected to do so.
Making a justice-oriented approach from this perspective, there was sufficient cause
for condoning the delay in the institution of the appeal. The fact that it was the
"State" which was seeking condonation and not a private party was altogether
irrelevant. The doctrine of equality before law demands that all litigants, including
the State as a litigant, are accorded the MC(MFA) No.1 of 2023 Page 12 same
treatment and the law is administered in an even-handed manner. There is no
warrant for according a step- motherly treatment when the "State" is the applicant
praying for condonation of delay. In fact experience shows that on account of an
impersonal machinery (no one in charge of the matter is directly hit or hurt by the
judgment sought to be subjected to appeal) and the inherited bureaucratic
methodology imbued with the note-making, file-pushing and passing-on- the-buck
ethos, delay on its part is less difficult to understand though more difficult to
approve. In any event, the State which represents the collective cause of the
community, does not deserve a litigant-non-grata status. The courts therefore have to
be informed with the spirit and philosophy of the provision in the course of the
interpretation of the expression "sufficient cause". So also the same approach has to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37327213/ 6
Kumari Amom Mema Devi vs Kumari Thokchom Manglembi Devi on 30 October, 2023
be evidenced in its application to matters at hand with the end in view to do
even-handed justice on merits in preference to the approach which scuttles a decision
on merits. Turning to the facts of the matter giving rise to the present appeal, we are
satisfied that sufficient cause exists for the delay. The order of the High Court
dismissing the appeal before it as time-barred, is therefore, set aside. Delay is
condoned. And the matter is remitted to the High Court. The High Court will now
dispose of the appeal on merits after affording reasonable opportunity of hearing to
both the sides."
(emphasis supplied) MC(MFA) No.1 of 2023 Page 13 [16]. In State of Nagaland v. Lipok AO and
others, (2005) 3 SCC 752, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held thus:
"15. It is axiomatic that decisions are taken by officers/agencies proverbially at a slow
pace and encumbered process of pushing the files from table to table and keeping it
on the table for considerable time causing delay
-- intentional or otherwise -- is a routine. Considerable delay of procedural red tape
in the process of their making decision is a common feature. Therefore, certain
amount of latitude is not impermissible. If the appeals brought by the State are lost
for such default no person is individually affected but what in the ultimate analysis
suffers, is public interest. The expression "sufficient cause"
should, therefore, be considered with pragmatism in a justice-oriented approach rather than the
technical detection of sufficient cause for explaining every day's delay. The factors which are
peculiar to and characteristic of the functioning of the governmental conditions would be cognizant
to and requires adoption of pragmatic approach in justice-oriented process. The court should decide
the matters on merits unless the case is hopelessly without merit.
MC(MFA) No.1 of 2023 Page 14 No separate standards to determine the cause laid by the State
vis-à-vis private litigant could be laid to prove strict standards of sufficient cause. The Government
at appropriate level should constitute legal cells to examine the cases whether any legal principles
are involved for decision by the courts or whether cases require adjustment and should authorise the
officers to take a decision or give appropriate permission for settlement. In the event of decision to
file appeal, needed prompt action should be pursued by the officer responsible to file the appeal and
he should be made personally responsible for lapses, if any. Equally, the State cannot be put on the
same footing as an individual. The individual would always be quick in taking the decision whether
he would pursue the remedy by way of an appeal or application since he is a person legally injured
while the State is an impersonal machinery working through its officers or servants." [17]. Refusal to
condone the delay would result in denying the petitioner in preferring the appeal against the
judgment and decree dated 21.12.2019. There is no presumption that delay in MC(MFA) No.1 of
2023 Page 15 approaching the Court is always deliberate. As held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, the
word "sufficient cause" under Section 5 of the Limitation Act should receive liberal construction so
as to advance substantial justice.

[18]. The petitioner is not to gain by delay. The reasons are spelt out in the petition. It is trite that if
the technical considerations and cause for substantial justice are pitted against each other, the cause
for substantial justice has to be sub- served.
[19]. Applying the aforesaid principles to the case on hand, it would be seen that the present petition
seeking condonation of delay spelt out the reasons for the delay in filing the appeal and the reasons
specified in that regard could not be held to be insufficient and no want of bonafides could have
been imputed to the petitioner.
[20]. That apart, the petitioner hasshown sufficient cause for the delay.In fact, most of the delay
period covers with Covid- 19 pandemic and, in this regard, the Hon'ble Supreme Court also excluded
the delay for the period from 15.3.2020 till 28.2.2022 in Suo-motu Writ Petition (C) No.3 of 2020
dated 10.1.2022 and after excluding the aforesaid period, the Hon'ble Supreme Court MC(MFA)
No.1 of 2023 Page 16 fixes the limitation period by saying all persons shall have a limitation period
of 90 days from 1.3.2022. The petitioner/State has also filed calculation sheet along with the
petition showing the number of days delay. In the given facts and circumstances of the case and also
the nature of suit, this Court is of the view that liberal approach has to be adopted in the present
case as the delay has been sufficiently explained by giving adequate reasons by the petitioner. The
present petition ought not to be rejected on some hyper technical reasoning.That apart, the
petitioner has shown sufficient cause for the delay.
[21]. For all the reasons stated above and having satisfied with the explanation for the delay, this
Court is inclined to condone the delay of 415 days in filing the appeal. [22]. In the result, MC (MFA)
No.1 of 2023 is allowed. No costs.
[23] The Registry is directed to number the appeal if it is otherwise in order and post for motion.
