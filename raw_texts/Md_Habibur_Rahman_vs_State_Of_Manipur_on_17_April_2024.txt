[5] The representation submitted by the petitioner against his termination order was also rejected
by Chairman, WAKF Board, Manipur vide order dated 24.07.2017. Both his termination order and
rejection of the representation are being impugned in the present writ petition mainly on the ground
that no opportunity was granted to the petitioner in violation of Section 38 (6) of the WAKF Act,
1995 and the same was done selectively.
[6] Mr. Shyam Sharma, learned G.A. for the State respondent, submits that the initial appointment
of the petitioner is not in consonance with the provisions of the Act, as appointment has not been
approved by the State Government in terms of Section 23 of the Act. It is also stated that as per the
provision of sub-section 7 of Section 38, the petitioner ought to challenge his termination before the
competent tribunal.
[7] Mr. Kh. Tarunkumar, learned senior counsel for the petitioner relies upon the decision of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Jaswant Singh & Ors. vs. State of MP & Ors. reported as
(2002) 9 SCC 700 holding that the opportunity of being heard should WP(C) No. 11 of 2018 Page 2
be given to the person whose initial appointment order was also not in order.
[8] Mr. AP. Sahu, learned counsel for the WAKF Board, submits that apart from the fact that the
petitioner was terminated on the ground of illegality, it is clarified that his further extension was not
signed by the competent authority.
[9] This Court has considered the materials on record, submissions made at the bar and relevant
case law. [10] It is admitted fact that prior to termination, no opportunity was granted to the
petitioner to explain his case. On perusal of Sub- section 6 of Section 38 of WAKF Act, 1995, it is
seen that reasonable opportunity of being heard ought to be granted to the employee of the WAKF
Board before passing an order of suspension/removal/dismissal from his post. Since the statutory
protection is not provided to the petitioner, the termination order dated 29.06.2013 is liable to be
set aside on this ground alone.
[11] Accordingly, the impugned order dated 29.06.2013 issued by the Chairman, WAKF Board,
Manipur terminating the service of the petitioner is set aside and the petitioner be re-instated in his
service. It is made clear that the respondents are at liberty to proceed against the petitioner as per
law, if so advised. [12] Mr. Kh. Tarunkumar, learned senior counsel, prays for back wages in view of
the Hon'ble Supreme Court decision reported as (2023) 9 SCC 160 which stipulates that back wages
are entitled in case the employee was terminated illegally.
WP(C) No. 11 of 2018 Page 3
[13] However, this Court is not passing any order with regard
to back wages and it is left to the wisdom of the respondents to consider this aspect keeping in mind
the peculiar facts of the present case that the petitioner was not getting anything during the last 10
(ten) years.
[14] In terms of the above directions and observations, the writ petition is disposed of.
