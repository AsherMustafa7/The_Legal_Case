JUDGEMENT
1. The petitioner had filed an application on 14.01.2021 under section 156(3) Code of Criminal
Procedure(CrPC) for registration of FIR under sections 323, 341, 420, 409, 452, 506 and 109 IPC
read with section 3/25 Arms Act against the respondent Nos. 3 to 6 before the Court of Duty
Magistrate, Kishtwar and the learned Munsiff JMIC, Kishtwar vide order dated 14.01.2021 after
recording its satisfaction that the complaint reveals the commission of cognizable offences,
forwarded the complaint under section 156(3) Cr.P.C. to SHO, Kishtwar to register the FIR under
relevant provisions of law. As the SHO concerned did not comply the order passed by the learned
Magistrate, the petitioner filed an application for initiation of contempt proceedings against the
SHO Police Station, Kishtwar, respondent No. 2 herein and simultaneously, a prayer was also made
for directing the SHO to submit the status report.
2. Notice was issued to respondent No. 2 in the aforesaid contempt petition and the respondent No.
2 filed the status report wherein it was stated that one FIR stands already registered prior to the
filing of the complaint by the petitioner under section 156(3) Cr.P.C. and in the said FIR, the son of
the complainant, namely, Suhail Ahmed was the accused.

3. The learned Munsiff (JMIC), Kishtwar vide order dated 09.02.2021, dropped the contempt
proceedings with the observations that there cannot be two FIRs for the same cause/occurrence
except counter FIRs and the grievance of the petitioner by no stretch of imagination is justified as
the FIR is already in place and investigation is going on.
4. The petitioner has assailed the order dated 09.02.2021 on the ground that the learned Magistrate
has failed to appreciate that the allegations levelled by the petitioner are altogether different
vis-a-vis the FIR 11/2021 dated 10.01.2021 registered against the son of the petitioner in which the
complainant is Ashiq Hussain-respondent No. 5 herein.
5. Status report has been filed by the respondent No. 1 in which it has been stated that FIR bearing
No. 11/2021 was registered against the son of the petitioner and investigation in the said FIR has
been finalized as challan and the son of the petitioner along with others figures as an accused in the
said challan.
6. Mr. Zulker Nain Sheikh, learned counsel for the petitioner vehemently argued that once the
learned Magistrate had ordered the registration of FIR after recording its satisfaction with regard to
the commission of cognizable offences, then the course adopted by the learned Magistrate by
observing that with regard to the same occurrence, two FIRs are not permissible, is not in
accordance with law particularly when the allegations levelled by the petitioner were different. Mr.
Sheikh submits that he has instructions not to press the present petition against the respondent
Nos. 3 and 4.
7. Mr. Sandeep Gupta, learned counsel appearing for the respondent Nos. 3, 5 and 6 vehemently
argued that in the application filed by the petitioner, there were no allegations against the
respondent Nos. 3 and 4 and the said application was filed only after the FIR was registered against
the son of the petitioner.
8. Mr. M. Y. Akhoon, learned counsel appearing for respondent No. 4 has reiterated the submissions
made by Mr. Sandeep Gupta.
9. Heard and perused the record.
10. It is settled law that there cannot be two FIRs with regard to the same occurrence but there may
be different versions of two parties with regard to the same occurrence and in such type of cases,
registration of cross FIRs is permissible. Reliance is placed upon the judgment of the Apex Court in
Surender Kaushik v. State of U.P., (2013) 5 SCC 148 wherein it has been held as under:
From the aforesaid decisions, it is quite luminous that the lodgment of two FIRs is
not permissible in respect of one and the same incident. The concept of sameness has
been given a restricted meaning. It does not encompass filing of a counter-FIR
relating to the same or connected cognizable offence. What is prohibited is any
further complaint by the same complainant and others against the same accused
subsequent to the registration of the case under the Code, for an investigation in that

Abdul Rashid vs Union Territory Of J&K And Others on 10 February, 2023
regard would have already commenced and allowing registration of further complaint
would amount to an improvement of the facts mentioned in the original complaint.
As is further made clear by the three-Judge Bench in Upkar Singh [Upkar Singh v.
Ved Prakash, (2004) 13 SCC 292] , the prohibition does not cover the allegations
made by the accused in the first FIR alleging a different version of the same incident.
Thus, rival versions in respect of the same incident do take different shapes and in
that event,lodgment of two FIRs is permissible.
11. So far as the instant case is concerned, it is borne from the record that pursuant to the complaint
filed by respondent No. 5, FIR bearing No. 11/2021 for commission of offences under sections 447,
147 and 323 IPC has been registered against the five accused including the son and wife of the
petitioner after they allegedly and illegally trespassed in the land of respondent No. 5 and assaulted
him as well as his wife. The time of occurrence has been shown as 0830 hours. In the complaint filed
by the petitioner it is alleged that the respondent Nos. 5 and 6 on 10.01.2021 at 6.00 a.m. armed
with sharp edged weapons i.e. axe forcefully trespassed into the land of the petitioner and started
cutting trees and binding wire fence on the disputed land. When the petitioner heard the noise of
the cutting trees, he woke up and rushed towards the spot along with his son, namely, Amir Suhail.
The respondent Nos. 5 and 6 started shouting by using filthy and unparliamentary language and
caught hold of his son and started beating him mercilessly and respondent Nos. 5 and 6 told the
petitioner that they had been directed to get the possession of the land forcefully and illegally by
respondent Nos. 3 and 4. Though there were no allegations regarding commission of any offence by
respondent Nos. 3 and 4 who were posted as Naib Tehsildar, Kishtwar and Patwari Halqa Pochhal
respectively, but still the Magistrate directed the registration of FIR against the respondent Nos. 3
and 4.
12. Be that as it may, the course adopted by the learned Magistrate while dropping the contempt
proceedings vide order dated 09.02.2021 with the observation that FIR is already in place and
investigation is going on, is not correct. As already observed above, there may be one version of the
complainant and the other by the accused and in such type of situation, the registration of cross FIR
is permissible as already observed.
13. In view of the above, it cannot be said that in the instant case, the registration of FIR on the
application of the petitioner would amount to registration of second FIR regarding same offence.
Rather this Court is of the considered view that the same would be a cross FIR and the registration
of the same, is not impermissible under law.
14. Viewed thus, this Court deems it appropriate to set aside the observations made by the learned
Magistrate in the order dated 09.02.2021 that the grievance of the petitioner cannot be considered
as justified as FIR was already registered. SHO, P/S Kishtwar is directed to register FIR under
relevant provisions of law against the respondent Nos. 5 and 6 only. Needless to say that this Court
has not made any observation with regard to the correctness of the allegations levelled by the
petitioner and it shall be the sole prerogative of the Investigating Officer concerned to arrive at any
conclusion after the completion of investigation.
