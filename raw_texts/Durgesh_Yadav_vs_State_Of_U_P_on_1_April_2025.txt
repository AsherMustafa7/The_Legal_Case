3. Learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of applicant submitted that however, it is a case in
which as per allegation, due to assault made by applicant and others, five persons died but from the
FIR, it reflects that along with applicant as many as 27 named and 50 unknown persons were made
accused on the basis of general and omnibus allegation and this fact clearly suggests that applicant
has been falsely made accused in the present matter along with others.

4. He further submitted that actually informant side was the real aggressor and due to assault made
by them from the side of applicant also one person died and from his side also a FIR was lodged
against the deceased persons.
5. He further submitted that actually, it is a case of free fight and in the incident, from the side of
informant however, five persons died but neither any specific role nor any specific weapon has been
assigned to any of the accused including applicant and considering the nature of allegation levelled
against the accused persons, evem it appears to be a case of over implication.
6. He further submitted that however, as per prosecution, when applicant was arrested then on his
pointing out one spade was recovered, which allegedly used in the instant crime by him and as per
prosecution, on the alleged recovered spade some marks, looks like blood, were found but till date,
the alleged recovered spade could not be connected with the instant crime. He further submitted
that even there is no evidence on record, which can suggests that the alleged marks found on spade
were of the human blood.
7. He further submitted that along with applicant, co-accused Paramhans Yadav, Kush Yadav,
Pawan Tiwari, Sudama Pal, Fulgena, Raghuveer Pal, Diwakar Tiwari, Parshuram Rajbhar, Pradeep
Rajbhar, Sugreev Pal, Bechu Rajbhar and Ramayan Pal were also made accused and they have been
released on bail by this Court vide orders dated 18.03.2025, 22.01.2025, 09.12.2024, 28.11.2024,
26.11.2024, 26.11.2024, 26.09.2024, 25.09.2024, 25.09.2024, 13.08.2024 and 25.09.2024 passed in
Criminal Misc. Bail Application Nos. 9041 of 2025, 40285 of 2024, 15658 of 2024, 40493 of 2024,
39735 of 2024, 39881 of 2024, 31633 of 2024, 29994 of 2024, 32308 of 2004, 27900 of 2024 and
32331 of 2024 respectively and as far as allegation of assault is concerned, case of applicant is at par
with them. He further submitted that however there was no allegation against these co-accused that
on their pointing out any weapon was recovered, which allegedly used by them in the instant crime.
8. He further submitted that however, bail application of co-accused Aniruddha Yadav has been
dismissed by co-ordinate Bench of this Court vide order dated 25.09.2024 passed in Criminal Misc.
Bail Application No. 27917 of 2024 and on his pointing out also one iron rod was recovered but law
is settled, there can be no parity of bail rejection order and at the time of rejection of bail application
of co-accused Aniruddha Yadav, it could not be placed before co-ordinate Bench of this Court that
the alleged recovered iron rod could not be connected with the instant crime.
9. He further submitted that applicant is not having any criminal history and he is in jail in the
present matter since 03.10.2024 i.e. for almost one and half years.
10. Per contra, learned AGA as well as learned counsel for the informant opposed the prayer for bail
and submitted that it is a case, in which, five persons died due to assault made by applicant and
others and however, number of persons have been enlarged on bail by this Court but case of
applicant is distinguishable from them as on the pointing out of applicant, one weapon (spade) used
in the crime was recovered.

11. They further submitted that on the pointing out of co-accused Aniruddha Yadav one iron rod was
recovered, which also allegedly used it in the crime and his bail application has been dismissed by
co-ordinate Bench of this Court but both the counsels could not dispute the fact that from the side of
applicant also one person died and from his side also a FIR was lodged against the deceased
persons.
12. They further could not dispute the fact that as far as allegation of assault is concerned, case of
applicant is at par with those accused, who have been released on bail.
13. They further could not dispute the fact that the alleged recovered spade on the pointing out of
the applicant could not be connected with the instant crime and there is no evidence on record,
which can suggests that the blood marks allegedly found on the alleged recovered spade on the
pointing out of the applicant were the marks of human blood.
14. They further could not dispute the fact that applicant is not having any criminal history and he is
in jail in the present matter for almost one and half years.
15. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record of the case.
16. However, it is a case in which five persons died but it reflects, on the basis of general and
omnibus allegations applicant has been made accused in the present matter along with as many as
27 name accused and 50 unknown persons.
17. Record also suggests that from the side of applicant also one person died and from his side also a
FIR was lodged against the deceased persons and considering this fact, the argument advanced by
learned counsel for the applicant that it is a case of free fight, cannot be completely ruled out at this
stage.
18. Further, neither any specific role nor any specific weapon has been assigned to the applicant and
other accused. However, as per prosecution, when applicant was arrested then on his pointing out
one spade was recovered, which allegedly used by him in the crime and on the alleged recovered
spade some marks were found, which looked like blood marks but till date, the alleged recovered
spade could not be connected with the instant crime and till date there is also no evidence that the
marks, which looked like blood marks were the marks of human blood.
19. Further, after investigation charge sheet has been filed in the matter.
20. Further, however, record also suggests that along with applicant, co-accused Aniruddha Yadav
was also made accused with similar allegation and when he was arrested then on his pointing out
one iron rod was recovered, which alleged to have been used in the instant crime and his bail
application has been dismissed by co-ordinate Bench of this Court but this Court finds merit in the
argument advanced by learned counsel for the applicant that law is settled there can be no parity of
bail rejection order.

21. Further, from the bail rejection order dated 25.09.2024, it reflects that at the time of rejection of
bail application of co-accused Aniruddha Yadav, it could not be brought to the notice of co-ordinate
Bench of this Court that the alleged recovered iron rod could not be connected with the instant
crime.
22. Further, along with applicant number of other accused persons were also made accused with
similar allegation of assault and they have already been released on bail by this Court, however, on
their pointing out recovery of any weapon could not be made.
23. Further, applicant is not having any criminal history and he is in jail in the present matter for
last almost one and half years.
24. Further, law is settled, bail application of an accused should not be dismissed for punitive
purpose.
25. Therefore, considering the facts and circumstances of the case discussed above, in my view
applicant is entitled to be released on bail.
26. Accordingly, without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, the instant bail
application is allowed.
27. Let the applicant- Durgesh Yadav be released on bail in the aforesaid case on furnishing a
personal bond and two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned
with the following conditions:-
(i) The applicant shall appear before the trial court on the dates fixed, unless his

28. In case of breach of any of the above condition, the prosecution will be at liberty to move an
application before this Court for cancellation of the bail of the applicant.
29. It is clarified that the observations made herein are limited to the facts brought in by the parties
pertaining to the disposal of bail application and the said observations shall have no bearing on the
