(cid:12) Crl.O.P.(MD)No.17978 of 2016
ORDER
This petition has been filed to quash the proceedings in C.C.No.13 of 2016 on the file of the learned
Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Madurai, as against the petitioner.
2.The learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that the respondent gave a complaint for the
offence punishable under Sections 276 (C)(1) and 276 CC of the Income Tax Act 1961, alleging that
the petitioner has failed to submit the return for the assessment year 2013-14. The Income Tax
Return was filed only on 29.03.2016. He further submitted that the petitioner has received a show
cause notice, dated 29.04.2016 and by his reply, dated 24.05.2016 explained that the return of the
Assessment Year 2013-14 had already filed on 29.03.2016 and the cash deposits more than
Rs.10,00,000/- (Rupees Ten lakhs only) can be properly accounted with the sources in the books of
accounts and TDS mentioned in the letter of the respondent, dated 29.04.2014. He further
submitted that the computation of income as shown in the return filed on 29.03.2016 would
indicate that the petitioner is entitled to refund of the tax to the tune of Rs.1,070/- and the tax
payable by the petitioner amounting to the tune of Rs.7,19,409/-. The authority concerned, who
http://www.judis.nic.in Crl.O.P.(MD)No.17978 of 2016 accorded sanction to prosecute the
petitioner, dated 29.07.2016 stated that no material was placed on record to evidence the
submissions of illness of the petitioner's mother and the depression suffered by his accountant for
delay in filing of returns. He further submitted that the sanction was accorded to prosecute the
petitioner only for the offence punishable under Section 276 CC of the Income Tax Act. Whereas the
complaint has filed by the respondent for the offence punishable under Sections 276 (C)(1) and 276
CC of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Therefore, the entire complaint is vitiated and liable to be quashed.
He further submitted that the case of the petitioner is false under Section 276 CC proviso (ii) (b) of
the Income Tax Act, and as such, the entire complaint is liable to be quashed.
3.Section 276 CC proviso (ii) (b) provides that a person shall not be proceeded against under this
section for failure to furnish in due time the Return of fringe benefits under Sub Section (i) of
115WD or return of income under Section 139 (1) if the tax payable by him on the total income
determined on regular assessment does not exceed Rs.3,000/- as reduced by advance tax paid and
any tax deducted at source. http://www.judis.nic.in Crl.O.P.(MD)No.17978 of 2016
4.The return filed by the petitioner in the year 2013-14 shows that tax payable by the petitioner is nil
and he is also claiming for refund of the tax payable have been adjusted against the advance tax
payable and tax deducted at source for the assessment year 2013-14. The return filed by the
petitioner for the year 2013-14 shows that tax payable by the petitioner and his claiming for refund
of the tax payable have been adjustable against the advance payable and the source for the
assessment year 2013-14.

5.The learned counsel appearing for the respondent would submit that the petitioner did not file
return and also did not pay any tax for the assessment year 2013-14. Therefore, the respondent has
issued a show cause notice as contemplated under Section 276 CC of the Income Tax Act, dated
29.04.2016 for appearance of the petitioner herein. The petitioner herein did not appear in person,
but through his authorized representative has issued a reply on 24.05.2016. Since the said reply is
not satisfactory and no proof had been adduced to prove the case of the petitioner. Therefore, the
respondent has obtained sanction from the Principal Commissioner of Income Tax, Madurai, to
prosecute the petitioner herein. He further submitted that the grounds raised by the petitioner
cannot be considered under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. when the http://www.judis.nic.in
Crl.O.P.(MD)No.17978 of 2016 factual disputes arise. All the points can be considered only during
the trial before the trial Court. Hence, he prayed for dismissal of the quash petition.
6.It is seen that the petitioner is the sole accused. The respondent has filed a complaint alleging that
the petitioner has failed to file his Income Tax Return for the Assessment Year 2013-14. However,
the petitioner has filed an income tax returns on 29.03.2016. On perusal of the returns filed by the
petitioner that the total tax with interest payable by the petitioner is a sum of Rs.7,19,409/-. Total
tax amount paid by the petitioner including advance tax TDS, TCS and also self assessment tax to
the tune of Rs.7,20,484/-. Therefore, the petitioner has also claimed refund of the income tax to the
tune of Rs.1,070/-. Further, the Principal Commissioner of Income Tax, Madurai, accorded sanction
by order, dated 29.07.2016, to prosecute the petitioner for the offence punishable under Section 276
CC of the Income Tax Act. Whereas on perusal of the complaint, the respondent has lodged a
complaint for the offence punishable under Sections 276 (C) (i) and 276 CC of the Income Tax Act.
Even according to the defacto complainant, the petitioner has failed to file the Income Tax return for
the assessment year 2013-14 within time. Therefore, he can be prosecuted for the offence under
Section 276 http://www.judis.nic.in Crl.O.P.(MD)No.17978 of 2016 CC of the Income Tax Act.
Whereas Section 276 (C) (i) related to if a person wilfully attempts in any manner whatsoever to
evade any tax, penalty or interest chargeable or imposable. Admittedly, the petitioner has failed to
pay the tax in time and subsequently, he has filed Income Tax return on 29.03.2016. Therefore, the
respondent without application of mind mechanically filed a complaint that too without any
allegation for the offence punishable under Section 276 (C) (i) of the Income Tax Act.
7.That apart, the Section 276 CC proviso (ii) (b) provides that a person shall not be proceeded
against under this section for failure to furnish in due time the return of fringe benefits under Sub
Section (i) of 115 WD or return of income under Section 139 (1) if the tax payable by him and the
total income determined on regular assessment does not exceed Rs.3,000/- as reduced by advance
tax paid and any tax deducted at source. On perusal of the return filed by the assessment year
2013-14 revealed that the tax payable by the petitioner is nil and he also claimed for refund of the
tax after adjusting the other payment made under as advance TDS, TCS and self assessment tax and
claimed a sum of Rs.1,070/-. Therefore, the entire complaint is nothing but clear abuse of process of
law and it cannot be sustained as against the petitioner.
