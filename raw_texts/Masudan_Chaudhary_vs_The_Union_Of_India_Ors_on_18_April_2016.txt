CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE HEMANT GUPTA
and
HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE AHSANUDDIN AMANULLAH
ORAL JUDGMENT
(Per: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE HEMANT GUPTA) Date: 18-04-2016 Heard learned counsel
for the petitioner and the respondents.
2. The challenge in the present writ application is to an order dated 6th of December, 2013 passed
by the Central Administrative Tribunal, Patna Bench, Patna (for short "the Tribunal") in O.A. No.
774 of 2012, whereby the order of punishment of compulsory retirement was not interfered with in
an application filed by the petitioner under Section 19 of the Administrative Patna High Court CWJC
No.13914 of 2014 dt.18-04-2016 Tribunals Act, 1985.
3. The petitioner was served with the charge-sheet dated 18th /23rd of August, 1994 that while
functioning as Head Weighing Clerk on 2nd of January, 1994 at Parasia Weighbridge, he weighed

rake of 35 BCN wagons and recorded the gross weight as 2980.7 Metric Ton, whereas the same rake
of wagons was reweighed at Andal Weighbridge on 3rd of January, 1994 where the gross weight was
found as 3057.08 Metric Ton i.e. 77.1 Metric Ton in excess than the previous weight taken at
Parasia.
4. On 5th of January 1994, 34 wagons were reweighed at Andal and excess weight was recorded as
compared to the weight recorded at Parasia. The loss of revenue was assessed at Rs. 93,210/- and
the same was realized from the concerned party. On the basis of the charge-sheet, an Inquiry Officer
was appointed who completed the inquiry proceedings in accordance with the rules. The order of
punishment was passed on 22nd of February, 2000 removing the petitioner from Railway service.
The petitioner preferred an appeal before the ADRM, Dhanbad on 31st of March, 2000 who reduced
the punishment of removal from service to compulsory retirement vide order dated 19th of
September, 2000. Further Mercy Appeal was dismissed by the Divisional Railway Manager,
Dhanbad. On creation of East Central Railway, Hajipur, a fresh Mercy petition/ Revision Patna High
Court CWJC No.13914 of 2014 dt.18-04-2016 was filed. Since the Mercy Petition was not decided,
the petitioner filed O.A. No. 252 of 2005 which was disposed of with direction to the competent
authority to dispose of the Mercy Petition. Thereafter, the Revisional Authority passed order on 19th
of October, 2006 rejecting the prayer of the applicant.
5. The petitioner thereafter filed Original Application No. 647 of 2007, wherein the order of
punishment was set aside on 11th of November, 2011 and the matter remitted to Revisional
Authority to reconsider the order of compulsory retirement. It is in pursuance of such direction, the
Revisional Authority has passed the impugned order dated 20th of April, 2012 maintaining the
order of punishment.
6. The quantum of punishment is beyond juridical review in terms of the power conferred on the
Central Administrative Tribunal under the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985 or by this Court
unless the punishment is shockingly disproportionate to the misconduct.
7. In pursuance of the direction of the Tribunal in an earlier Original Application filed by the
petitioner, the matter of punishment has been examined by the Revisional Authority afresh, wherein
the authority has not interfered with the order of punishment.
8. Since the order of punishment is within the judicial Patna High Court CWJC No.13914 of 2014
dt.18-04-2016 discretion of the competent authority, we do not find any reason to interfere with the
order of punishment imposed by the Revisional Authority and not interfered by the learned
Tribunal.
9. The writ application is, thus, dismissed.
