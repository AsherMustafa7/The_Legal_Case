Prabhuraj @ Praburaj vs The Inspector Of Police on 7 December, 2021
ORDER
The above Criminal Original Petition has been filed, invoking Section 482 Cr.P.C., seeking orders to
call for the records relating to the case in Crime No.846 of 2020 on the file of Melur Police Station,
Madurai District and quash the same.
2. The petitioner is the third accused in the case in Crime No.846 of 2020 on the file of the first
respondent police.
3. The case of the prosecution is that on 02.06.2020 at 08.00 a.m. when the respondent police was
in surveillance, the petitioner along with nine others were found playing cards by sitting in a round
shape, that on seeing the police party, all the accused had attempted to take heels, but some of them
were apprehended and that the cards along with a sum of Rs.2,820/- were recovered. Hence, the
Special Sub Inspector of Police attached to Melur Police Station has registered an FIR in Crime
No.846 of 2020 on 02.06.2020 against 10 persons including the petitioner herein for the offence
under Section 12 of TN Gaming Act. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.(MD)No.21818 of
2022
4. The main contention of the petitioner is that FIR was registered on 02.06.2020, but till now
charge sheet has not been filed and that therefore, the impugned FIR is hit by Section 468(2) Cr.P.C.
5. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner has relied on the decision of this Court in
Rajasekar Vs. State represented by Inspector of Police and another reported in (2022) 2 MLJ (Crl)
396, “15. Now coming to the other ground of attack raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner
that the very filing of the charge sheet after lapse of four years since the registration of the case is
illegal as it is time barred and that the learned Judicial Magistrate ought not to have taken
cognizance of the case, as the final report is clearly barred under Section 468 Cr.P.C.
16. It is necessary to refer the judgment of the learned Single Judge of this Court in
Crl.O.P.(MD)No.18775 of 2021, dated 07.12.2021 in Thinakaran and Others Vs. State represented by
the Inspector of Police, Tirunelveli Junction Police Station and another and the relevant passage is
extracted hereunder:
“6. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioners drew my attention the decision
reported in 1987 Cri LJ 360 (Kathamuthu V. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
Crl.O.P.(MD)No.21818 of 2022 Balammal). The Hon'ble Division Bench was called
upon to answer the question as to whether the launching of a criminal prosecution
after the lapse of the period of limitation prescribed under Section 468 of Cr.P.C, can
the Court condone the delay after taking cognizance of the offences or whether such
condonation of delay should precede the taking cognizance of the offences. In the
aforesaid Judgment, the Hon'ble Division Bench categorically answered and held that
any proceeding culminating in the conviction of a person in a criminal case, the
cognizance of which has been taken after the expiry of the period of limitation as
prescribed under Section 468(2) of Cr.P.C. without first resorting to Section 473 of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/85637911/ 2
Prabhuraj @ Praburaj vs The Inspector Of Police on 7 December, 2021
Cr.P.C., is non est in the eye of law. The decision reported in 1978 Cri.L.J.116
(Sulochana V. State Registrar of Chits, Madras) was specifically disapproved.”
17. Another learned Judge of this Court in D.Senthilkumar Vs. The Inspector of Police, Prohibition
Enforcement Wing, T.Nagar Unit, M.G.R.Nagar Police Station, Chennai – 600 083,
(Crl.O.P.No.4307 of 2017, dated 09.09.2020) has held as follows:
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.(MD)No.21818 of 2022 “7. Considering the
rival submissions, it is seen that FIR was registered on 25.06.2015 on the same day
the vehicle was seized for offence under Section 4(1)(a) Tamil Nadu Prohibition Act,
1937, for this offence the imprisonment is fixed for a term which may extended to
three months or with fine which may extended to one thousand. As per Section
468(2) of Cr.P.C, the period of limitation for filing final report expires on or before
24.06.2016. Auto which was seized was ordered to be returned to the petitioner in
C.M.P.No. 4384 of 2015 by order dated 26.11.2015 by XXIII Magistrate Court,
Saidapet, Chennai, against which Crl.RC.No. 74 of 2015 was filed by the respondent
Police before the Additional Sessions Judge, Chennai.
It is seen that the Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police sent notice for
confiscating the Vehicle on 08.10.2015, since the owner of the vehicle failed to make
any objection the vehicle was confiscated and is in custody PEW unit and from
26.11.2015 to 31.07.2018 revision case was pending. It is seen that the respondent
had filed the original documents during enquiry before them
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.(MD)No.21818 of 2022 Additional Session
Court, Chennai and due to which the charge sheet which was made ready on
21.09.2016, could not be filed before the concerned Magistrate Court. This is an
explanation offered by the learned counsel for the respondent. There is no reason
given why after disposal of criminal revision on 13.07.2018 till date the charge sheet
is yet to be filed and numbered. Though as per 470 of Cr.P.C, exclusion of time in
certain cases are available, in this case no such grounds are available. Further, no
petition or reason given seeking condonation of delay as per Section 473 Cr.P.C is
made. The valuable right accrued to an accused person cannot be allowed to be taken
away except by strictly satisfying the conditions prescribed under Section 473 Cr.P.C.
In any case, the exercise of power under Section 473 Cr.P.C., extending the period of
limitation by condoning the delay in launching prosecution should precede the taking
cognizance of the offence. This Court following the case of “Kathamuthu Versus
Balammal reported in 1985 Crl.L.J 360”, finds the facts of the case no cognisance
would be taken in Criminal No.205 of 2015 since it would be bar beyond the period of
limitation.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.(MD)No.21818 of 2022 In view of the same the
proceedings in Crime No.205 of 2015 is quashed.”

18. It is evident from the records that the incident was alleged to have occurred on 05.10.2007 and
FIR came to be registered on 16.11.2007 and admittedly the charge sheet has been laid on
14.07.2011. Section 468 Cr.P.C. contemplates the period of limitation for taking cognizance of an
offence and in case of the offence which is punishable with imprisonment for a period of term
exceeding one year, but, not exceeding three years, the period of limitation shall be three years. In
the present case, the major offence with which the accused were charged with, is under Section 506
(1) IPC and the same would attract the maximum punishment of two years imprisonment and as
such, the period of limitation for taking cognizance is three years. In the case on hand, admittedly,
charge sheet was filed after the expiry of three years. No doubt, Section 473 Cr.P.C. prescribes two
exceptions and that the Court can take cognizance beyond the period prescribed under Section 468
(2) Cr.P.C., if the delay has been properly explained or that it is necessary in the interests of justice.”
6. In the case on hand, as already pointed out, FIR came to be registered as earlier as on 02.06.2020
for the offence under Section 12 of TN Gaming Act.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.(MD)No.21818 of 2022
7. It is not in dispute that Section 12 of Gaming Act attracts the maximum punishment of three
months or fine. Hence, final report should have been filed within a year. Admittedly, final report has
not been filed so far. The prosecution has not offered any acceptable reason or explanation for the
delay. Hence, this Court has no other option, but to say that the case is barred by limitation.
8. Now coming to the second contention of the petitioner that the common gaming house envisaged
in Section 3 of Gaming Act is found missing in the FIR, that unless the gaming takes place in a
common gaming house or public street, there will be no offence under Section 12 of the Act and that
the very reading of the FIR does not reveal as to the place where the gaming had taken place. As
rightly pointed out by the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner, in the FIR, it has been stated
that near Kalugumalai, back side of Vellaripatti TVS company, but they have not specified the place
where the gaming had taken place.
9. As rightly contended by the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner, since the prosecution
has failed to specify the place and that since they have not shown that the gaming had taken place in
the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.O.P.(MD)No.21818 of 2022 common gaming house, this
Court has no hesitation to hold that Section 12 of the said Act is not attracted.
10. Viewed from any angle, the very registration of the FIR is not maintainable. Hence, this Court
concludes that the impugned FIR is liable to be quashed.
11. In the result, this Criminal Original Petition stands allowed and the impugned FIR in Crime
No.846 of 2020 on the file of the first respondent is hereby quashed as against the petitioner.
Consequently, connected Miscellaneous Petition is closed.
