JUDGMENT
(Jabalpur, Dated 2.12.2019) As per : Anjuli Palo, J.
1. This appeal under Section 372 of the Cr.P.C. has been filed by the victim/prosecutrix against the
judgment of acquittal dated 1.7.2019 passed by First Additional Sessions Judge, Begamganj, District
Raisen in Special Sessions Trial No. 139/2016 whereby respondent No. 2 has been acquitted from
the charges under Section 376, 366, 344, 506 Part II of the IPC.
2. Prosecution's case, in short, is that on 22.5.2016 at about 12:00 O'clock in the noon at village
Sultanganj, respondent No. 2 came to the shop of the victim and told her to come with him for
shopping of clothes. The victim had gone with him in a Jeep, from where, respondent No. 2 had first
taken her to Bhopal and thereafter to Mandideep where they stayed at a Lodge and forcibly
committed sexual intercourse. Next day, respondent No. 2 taken a house on rent where he kept the
victim for about 15 days and committed sexual intercourse without her consent. Respondent No. 2
beaten her and also threatened her to kill. Thereafter she managed to escape from Mandideep and

506 Part II of the IPC were framed against respondent No. 2.
4. Learned Sessions Judge after appreciating the evidence available on record found that the
prosecutrix was a consenting party and acquitted respondent No. 2 from the aforesaid charges.
5. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties at length and perused the record along with the
statement of the prosecutrix.
6. From the evidence available on record, it is established that the prosecutrix was major at the time
of incident. Her age was about 25-26 years. On 22.5.2016 at about 12:00 O'clock in the noon at
village Sultanganj, respondent No. 2 came to the shop of the victim and told her to come with him
for purchasing of clothes. respondent No. 2 used to call her Aunty. The victim herself visited with
respondent No. 2 in a Jeep to several places i.e. Sultanganj, Begamganj, Bhopal and thereafter to
Mandideep without any resistance but she did not complain against him anywhere to anyone. It is
also established from the evidence of the prosecutrix that she stayed with respondent No. 2 at
Mandideep at a Lodge where he committed sexual intercourse with her. Thereafter, they both
resided in a rented room for about 15 days. The prosecutrix deposed that without her consent
respondent No. 2 forcibly committed rape upon her but in her medical report Ex. P-9, no sign was
found by the Doctor to establish that she was subjected to forcible sexual intercourse. Her conduct is
very important because after commission of repeated rape upon her, she still resided with
respondent No. 2 then she went to Orissa alone but she did not try to lodge any report against
respondent No. 2 anywhere immediately. When her husband came there, she returned back to
Sultanganj, where she was residing with her family. Firstly, the First Information Report was lodged
belatedly and no explanation has 3 CRA-6766-2019 been offered regarding delay in lodging the FIR.
Secondly, her case is not corroborated by the medical evidence. The prosecutrix was a major
married lady having two children. Her evidence cannot be said to be trust worthy or reliable that she
had gone with respondent No. 2 without her consent, therefore, conviction of respondent No. 2
cannot be based solely on her testimony.
7. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we do not find any merit in this appeal filed by the victim.
Accordingly, this appeal is hereby dismissed.
