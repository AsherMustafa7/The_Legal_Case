Smt.Madhukanta Patadia W/O Late ... vs The State Of Karnataka on 16 July, 2020
2. The respondents have initiated proceedings against the petitioners herein under Sections 79A and
79B of the Karnataka Land Reform Act, 1961 (for short 'the Act'). The entire proceedings are based
on a complaint that petitioners have not disclosed their income. Hence, proceedings are initiated
under Sections 79A and 79B of the Act. The order under challenge is passed on 23.10.2019.
3. The Karnataka Land Reforms (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020 has come into force with effect
from 13.07.2020. Section 2 of the Karnataka Land Reforms (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020 reads as
follows:
"(2) Sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 11 shall be deemed to have been come into force with
effect from the 1st day of March 1974 and remaining provisions shall come into force
at once."
4. Further, the Ordinance has also brought in amendment to Section 79A, 79B and 79C to the
principle Act, which reads as follows:
"5. Omission of sections 79A.- In the Principal Act, section 79A shall be omitted.
6. Omission of sections 79B.- In the Principal Act, section 79B shall be omitted.
Omission of sections 79C.- In the Principal Act, section 79C shall be omitted."
5. Section 13 of the Ordinance is also culled out for better understanding:
"13. Savings.- (1) Notwithstanding the omission of sections 79A, 79B and 79C with
effect from 1st day of March 1974, the cases already disposed of before the
publication of the Karnataka Land Reforms (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020 shall not
in any way be affected.
(2) All cases pending on the date of publication of this Act pertaining to sections 79A,
79B and 79C and consequential thereof shall stand abated."
6. On perusal of sections 5, 6 and 7 of Karnataka Land Reforms (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020, the
provisions of Section 79A, 79B and 79C in the Principal Act stand omitted. If these sections referred
at 5, 6 and 7 of Karnataka Land Reforms (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020 are read conjointly with
section 2, it is clearly evident that amended provisions are retrospective in nature, since Section 2
expressly provides and contemplates that provisions of Sections 79A, 79B and 79C, which stand
omitted by the Karnataka Land Reforms (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020 shall be deemed to have
been come into force with effect from 01.03.1974.
7. The present writ petition is filed on 10.07.2020 challenging the impugned order dated 23.10.2019
passed by respondent No.2 as per Annexure-A wherein respondent No.2 on enquiry under Section
79A and 79B has passed an order under Section 83 of the Karnataka Land Reforms act, 1961 by
holding that transactions are in contravention of Section 79A and 79B of the Karnataka Land

Reforms Act, 1961 and accordingly has ordered for forfeiture of petition lands by way of penalty and
ordered to vests in the State Government.
8. The State by way of Karnataka Land Reforms (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020 has omitted
Sections 79A, 79B and 79C from the Principal Act with effect from 01.03.1974 and as such, the
forfeiture order passed by respondent No.2 as per Annexure-A stands abated as per Section 13(2) of
Karnataka Land Reforms (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020.
9. Since the proceedings under Sections 79A and 79B have not attained finality, Section 13(2) of
Karnataka Land Reforms (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020 is applicable to the present case on hand.
10. Accordingly, the writ petition is disposed of by holding that proceedings initiated by respondent
No.2 ordering for forfeiture of petition lands and consequent vesting stands abated.
