and the same stood dishonoured on 03.10.2023 on account of insufficient funds. A statutory
demand notice was issued on 13.10.2023 which was received by the applicant on 14.10.2023. Since
the said amount was not paid in spite of service of the statutory demand notice, the complaint stood

Court No.4, Kanpur Nagar summoned the applicant on 05.01.2024 in Complaint Case No. 154792 of

Alok Kumar Trivedi vs State Of U.P. And Another on 8 April, 2025
preferred on 24.04.2024. Thereafter on 15.06.2024, the court of Additional Civil Judge (Junior
Division)-IV, Metropolitan, Kanpur Nagar proceeded to summon the applicant in Complaint Case
No.40309 of 2024.
6. The facts of the C2 applications are that a complaint was filed by the opposite party No. 02 on
15.09.2023 under Section 138 read with Section 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, with
an allegation that in the year 2019, the applicant herein claiming himself to be the proprietor of
Trivedi Transport Company and Building Material approaching the opposite party No.02 with a
request to tender financial assistance as he had suffered losses in the said business. The opposite
party no. 2 tendered financial assistance to the tune of Rs.46,04,600/- through bearer cheque,
R.T.G.S., N.E.F.T. etc. On 06.08.2023, an amount of Rs.1,36,500/- was paid by the applicant to the
opposite party no. 02 through R.T.G.S. Since the residue amount of Rs.45,68,100/- was to be paid
by the applicant to the opposite party no. 2 so on 20.04.2023, the applicant had drawn a cheque of
Bank of Baroda bearing No.000157 of an amount of Rs.10,75,000/- with an assurance that the said
cheque be presented in the bank would be cleared and the liability will be cleared very soon. In para
6 of the complaint, it is asserted that the cheques were presented on several occasions i.e.
02.05.2023, 06.05.2023, 08.06.2023 and 06.07.2023. However, the same was dishonored on
03.05.2023, 08.05.2023, 09.06.2023 and 07.07.2023 on account of insufficient funds. A statutory
notice of demand was made on 05.08.2023 to clear the said amount which was received on
07.08.2023. A reply to the said notice was tendered by the applicant on 14.08.2023. Since the
payments were not made despite demand, so the complaint stood lodged on 15.09.2023.
7. The Court of Additional Civil Judge (Junior Division), Kanpur Nagar in Complaint Case
No.138763 of 2023 summoned the applicant on 07.10.2023 under Section 138 N.I. Act.
8. Questioning the summoning orders passed by the court below, the applicant has filed the present
applications under section 482 Cr.P.C.
9. Learned counsel for the applicant has submitted that the summoning orders cannot be sustained
in the eyes of law for manifold reasons:
(a) The cheques which are stated to have been dishonoured does not answer the
definition of "debt or other liabilities" so as to invoke the provisions of Section 138 of
the N.I. Act as the same was tendered as security.
(b) Since the applicant had made part payment of the amount as stated to be due,
thus, Section 56 of the N.I. Act, 1881 would come into play and the opposite party no.
2 would not be entitled to receive the total amount so claimed and the criminal
proceedings cannot be initiated against the applicant.
(c) On the similar set of allegations, two parallel proceedings cannot be continued,
particularly, when there already happens to be a first information report lodged prior
to the filing of the complaint on 05.03.2023 under Sections 406, 342, 506, 504 and
147 IPC, being FIR No.0065 at the instance of the opposite party no. 2 against the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/116178496/ 3
Alok Kumar Trivedi vs State Of U.P. And Another on 8 April, 2025
applicant with respect to same incident and transaction.
10. Learned counsel for the applicant has submitted that in the first information report dated
05.03.2024 under Sections 406, 342, 506, 504 and 147 IPC, a recital has been contained in the body
of the first information report that with respect to financial assistance extended by the opposite
party no. 2 to the applicant, the applicant had submitted a cheque as a guarantee. Submission is that
the said cheques which were submitted as security, are now being misused while presenting in the
bank and getting it dishonored. Submission is that once the cheques were submitted as security and
the same has been admitted in the FIR then the same cannot be attract liability under the
Negotiable Instruments Act since they do not come within the ambit of debt or other liabilities. It is
also contended that as per the complaint itself, it is apparent that the total amount due which was
liable to be paid by the applicant to the opposite party no. 2 was Rs.46,04,600/- out of which, the
applicant had discharged his liability while making of Rs.1,36,500/- on 16.08.2023, thus, the legally
enforceable debt on the date of the maturity would not be the sum represented on the cheque in
view of the Section 56 of the N.I. Act. Reliance has been placed upon the decision in the case of the
Dashrathbhai Trikambhai Patel v. Hitesh Mahendrabhai Patel and another; 2023 (1) SCC 578.
Additionally, it is being argued that once with respect to same set of facts/ transactions, a first
information report under Sections 406, 342, 506, 504 and 147 IPC stood lodged on 05.03.2023 then
the criminal proceedings emanating from the complaint case cannot be proceeded with in view of
the Article 20(2) of the Constitution of India read with Section 300(1) Cr.P.C. Reference has been
made to the judgment in the case of J. Vedhasingh v. R.M. Govindan; 2022 SCC OnLine SC 1010
that in view of the conflicting decisions, the matter has been referred to the larger Bench.
Accordingly, it is prayed that the summoning orders be quashed.
11. Shri S.K. Singh, learned AGA while countering the submission of learned counsel for the
applicant has sought to argue that none of the grounds are tenable in the eyes of law and there is no
illegality in the summoning order. Submission is that the question as to whether the cheques were
presented for security or not, is a matter of trial, which cannot be gone into the present proceedings
at this stage. As regards, the application of Section 56 of N.I. Act is concerned, it would not be
attracted in the present proceedings. Lastly, it is contended that the offences under IPC, pursuant to
the lodging of the first information report and the complaint under section 138 N.I. Act can proceed
on their own strength, particularly, when the allegation in both the proceedings are completely
different and they are not intermingling with each other and they are not on similar set of
allegations.
12. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and gone through the records carefully.
13. The sole question which arises for determination in the present proceedings is the extent of
judicial intervention in the present proceedings at this stage. Apparently, a first information report
stood lodged by the opposite party no. 2 against the applicant on 05.03.2023 at 18:32 hours, FIR
No.0065 of 2023 before Police Station Bari-South, Commissionerate Kanpur Nagar, under Sections
406, 342, 506, 504 and 147 IPC relatable to the commission of the offenses on 05.03.2023 against
the applicant and other unnamed four and five persons with an allegation that certain amounts were
transferred through R.T.G.S. by the opposite no. 2 to the applicant and the applicant had submitted
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/116178496/ 4
Alok Kumar Trivedi vs State Of U.P. And Another on 8 April, 2025
a cheque as a guarantee, however, the said amount was not paid, despite one year has lapsed and
when on 04.03.2023, when the opposite party no. 2 requested the applicant to pay the amount then
threats were administered on phone so the opposite no. 2 contacted the Manager of the institution
and when he had made phone-call to the applicant, he appraised that he was in District Court and
he directed him to come there but when the Manager stated that the applicant was not in the
District Court then he was called to another place and when even to that place then threats were
administered, pursuant whereto the first information report was lodged. So far as the complaint
lodged by the opposite party no. 2 is concerned, the same alleges that an amount of Rs.46,04,600/-
was extended as a financial assistance by the opposite party no. 2 to the applicant and a part
payment of Rs.1,36,500/- through R.T.G.S. was made by the applicant to the opposite party no. 2 on
16.08.2023 and the total residue amount was Rs. 45,68,100/-. Cheques are stated to have been
issued by the applicant being of Rs.13,82,100/- on 29.09.2023 bearing no. 00072 (leading
application) and an amount of Rs.10,00,000/- on 22.03.2024 bearing no. 000109 (connected C1
application) and Rs. 10,75,000/- being cheque no. 000157 dated 20.04.2023 (connected C2
application). The said cheques stood dishonored on various dates, pursuant whereto statutory
demand notice was issued which was complaint so filed and summoning order has been passed.
14. A pivotal question which arises for consideration is firstly, whether offences under IPC and the
complaint under Section 138 of the N.I. Act can be proceeded with or not, secondly, whether on the
basis of the making of the part payment, the legal enforceable debt on the date of the maturity of the
cheque is there or not while applying Section 56 of the N.I. Act and thirdly, whether the said cheques
can be termed to be security or not.
15. Coming to the issue of continuance of the criminal proceedings emanating from lodging of an
FIR and complaint under Section 138 of N.I. Act is concerned, what is to be seen is the fact as to
whether there happens to be on the similar set of allegations or not. Apparently, the first
information report under Sections 406, 342, 506, 504 and 147 IPC stood lodged on 05.03.2023
bearing FIR No. 0065. The said FIR does not disclose any allegations referable to the dishonouring
of the cheques which are the part and the parcel in the complaints under Section 138 of the N.I. Act.
The allegation in the first information report is regarding administering threats and not paying the
amounts due and payable referable to the financial assistance extended by the opposite party no. 2
to the applicant. The complaints under Section 138 of the N.I. Act which are subject matter of
application under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. are post lodging of first information report on
18.11.2023, 24.04.2024 and 15.09.2023 in respect of dishonouring of cheques on 29.09.2023 for Rs.
13,82,100/-, cheque dated 22.03.2024 of Rs. 10,00,000/- and cheque no. 000157 dated 20.04.2023
for Rs. 10,75,000/-
16. Interestingly, in the leading and connected C1 applications, the cheques have been drawn post
lodging of the first information report which stood dishonored. However, in the connected C2
application, though the cheque was drawn on 20.04.2023 and the same stood dishonoured on
various occasions and lastly, on 07.07.2023 on account of insufficient funds but the payment was
made on 16.08.2023 which is post dishonouring of the cheuqe. Thus, it can be safely said that they
are not on the similar set of allegations. The cause of action as well as the contents of the complaints
and the FIR are entirely different. Hence the judgment in the case of J. Vedhasingh (supra) would
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/116178496/ 5
Alok Kumar Trivedi vs State Of U.P. And Another on 8 April, 2025
not apply in the facts and circumstances of the case, particularly, when in the present facts of the
case, allegations are on different set of facts.
17. Section 56 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 reads as under:
"56. Endorsement for part of sum due.?No writing on a negotiable instrument is valid
for the purpose of negotiation if such writing purports to transfer only a part of the
amount appearing to be due on the instrument; but where such amount has been
partly paid, a note to that effect may be indorsed on the instrument, which may then
be negotiated for the balance."
18. In the Dashrathbhai Trikambhai Patel (supra) the Hon'ble Apex Court had the occasions to
consider Section 56 of the N.I. Act 1881 and in para 30, it was held as under:
"30. In view of the discussion above, we summarise our findings below:
(i) For the commission of an offence under Section138, the cheque that is
dishonoured must represent a legally enforceable debt on the date of maturity or
presentation;
(ii) If the drawer of the cheque pays a part or whole of the sum between the period
when the cheque is drawn and when it is encashed upon maturity, then the legally
enforceable debt on the date of maturity would not be the sum represented on the
cheque;
(iii) When a part or whole of the sum represented on the cheque is paid by the drawer
of the cheque, it must be endorsed on the cheque as prescribed in Section 56 of the
Act. The cheque endorsed with the payment made may be used to negotiate the
balance, if any. If the cheque that is endorsed is dishonoured when it is sought to be
encashed upon maturity, then the offence under Section 138 will stand attracted;
(iv) The first respondent has made part-payments after the debt was incurred and
before the cheque was encashed upon maturity. The sum of rupees twenty lakhs
represented on the cheque was not the 'legally enforceable debt on the date of
maturity. Thus, the first respondent cannot be deemed to have committed an offence
under Section 138 of the Act when the cheque was dishonoured for insufficient funds;
and
(v) The notice demanding the payment of the 'said amount of money' has been
interpreted by judgments of this Court to mean the cheque amount. The conditions
stipulated in the provisos to Section 138 need to be fulfilled in addition to the
ingredients in the substantive part of Section 138. Since in this case, the first
respondent has not committed an offence under Section 138, the validity of the form
of the notice need not be decided."

(emphasised court)
19. In the present case in hand, the question of application of Section 56 of the N.I. Act would not
arise for the simple reason that one of the condition precedent is that part payment is to be made
post drawing of the cheque and before its maturity. Here in the present case, so far as leading
applicant and connected C1 application, whatever payments have been made, it is prior to drawing
of the cheques, particularly, when out of the total amount of Rs.46,04,600/- as per the complaint
and case of the applicant and an amount of Rs.1,36,500/- being the part payment was made on
16.08.2023. However, the cheques in the leading case was drawn by the applicant on 29.09.2023 for
13,82,100/- and in the connected application for an amount of Rs. 10,00,000/- drawn on
22.03.2024, thus, whatever part payments which are claimed to be made by the applicant is
concerned, the same is prior to drawing of the cheque. So far as connected C2 application is
concerned, the cheques were though issued drawn on 20.04.2023 and was lastly dishonoured on
07.07.2023 but the part payments were made on 16.08.2023 of an amount of Rs. 1,36,500/-.
Moreover, the reply to the applicant dated 14.08.2023 to the statutory demand notice does not
disclose that barring the making of a part payment of Rs. 1,36,500/-, there was any other part
payment made by the applicant. Even otherwise, a bare perusal of the complaints itself make it clear
that the total amount due and payable was Rs. 45,68,100/- against which the three cheques were
drawn by the applicant which stood dishonoured, however, adding the amount of the cheque which
was being dishonoured also do not exceed the total amount stated to be due and payable as reflected
in the complaint.
20. Nevertheless, it would not be appropriate for the Court to intervene at this stage and throttle the
continuance of the proceedings, particularly, when there is nothing to substantiate and further
whatever arguments are being sought to be made are the matter of defences, thus, the applicant is
not entitled to the benefit.
21. Lastly, the submission of the learned counsel for the applicant that the cheques were delivered to
the opposite party no. 2 as security, thus, they do not answer the debt or other liabilities is
concerned, the same cannot be accepted for the simple reason that there is nothing on record to
show that the said/ same cheques were kept as security. Apart from the same, the issue as to
whether the cheques were tendered by way of security is concerned, the same is a matter of defence
which cannot be gone into at this stage in the present proceedings, as it is a matter of trial. The
Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of M/s Womb Laboratories Pvt. Ltd. v. Vijay Ahuja and another;
2022 (18) SCC 631 in para 4 as observed as under:
"4. In our opinion, the High Court has muddled the entire issue. The averment in the
complaint does indicate that the signed cheques were handed over by the accused to
the complainant. The cheques were given by way of security, is a matter of defence.
Further, it was not for the discharge of any debt or any liability is also a matter of
defence. The relevant facts to countenance the defence will have to be proved - that
such security could not be treated as debt or other liability of the accused. That would
be a triable issue. We say so because, handing over of the cheques by way of security
per se would not extricate the accused from the discharge of liability arising from
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/116178496/ 7
Alok Kumar Trivedi vs State Of U.P. And Another on 8 April, 2025
such cheques."
22. The said proposition of law stood reiterated in the case of Sunil Todi v. State of Gujarat; 2022
(16) SCC 762. Accordingly, no ground is made out to interfere in the present proceedings, thus,
interference is declined. Applications are dismissed.
