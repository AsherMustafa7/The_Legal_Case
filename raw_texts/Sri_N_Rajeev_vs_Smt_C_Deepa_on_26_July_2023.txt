THIS PETITION COMING ON FOR PRELIMINARY HEARING
THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:

NC: 2023:KHC:25910
WP No. 14769 of 2023
ORDER
The short grievance of the petitioner is as to the long pendency of his matrimonial case in
M.C.No.2514/2016 wherein he has sought for a decree for the dissolution/nullity of marriage, qua
the respondent, on fault grounds. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the right to speedy
justice being recognized by the Apex Court as a constitutional guarantee under Article 21, a direction
is to be issued for the expeditious disposal of the said case.
2. Notice to respondent spouse is dispensed with since no order adverse to her interest is being
made and further she will have full opportunity of participation in the trial of the subject case at the
hands of the court below. Added, she too will have the advantage of early disposal.
3. Having heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and having perused the Petition Papers, this
Court is broadly in agreement with the proposition that the matrimonial causes should be tried &
disposed off on a war footing, at least as a concession to the shortness of human NC:
2023:KHC:25910 life. It was Thomas Carlyle (1795-1881), a British historian of great repute who
had said: "Life is too short to be little". When a matrimonial case involves the prayer for the
dissolution/nullity of marriage, courts should make all efforts to try & dispose off the same within
an outer limit of one year, so that in the event of granting such a decree, the parties may restructure
their lives. It hardly needs to be stated 'life is lost in living'. Delay in disposal of such cases very badly
affects the parties thereto, needs no deliberation.
In the above circumstances, learned Family Court Judge is requested to accomplish the trial &
disposal of the subject seven year old case preferably within an outer limit of three months, all
contentions having been kept open.
The Registrar General of this court is instructed to circulate this judgment in all the concerned
circles so that other similarly circumstanced litigants may not unnecessarily knock at the doors of
this court seeking a direction for the expeditious disposal of their cases.
NC: 2023:KHC:25910 Registry to send a copy of this judgment to the respondent-wife by Speed
Post, immediately.
