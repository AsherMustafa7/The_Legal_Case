4. By this appeal, appellants/convicted accused
Naveen Kumar & Shishu Kumar are challenging the judgment
of conviction and order of sentence dated 20.09.2006 and
21.09.2006
respectively, passed by the Additional Sessions Judge (Fast Track Court Vth), Sheikhpura, in
Sessions Case No. 479 of 1996 / Trial No. 75 of 2006 , arising out of Barbigha Police Station Case
No. 14 of 1996, by which the appellants were convicted for the offence under Sections 307/34 and
323/34 of the Indian Penal Code. The appellants are sentenced for a period of five year rigorous
imprisonment for the charge of Section 307/34 of the Indian Penal code. They are further fined Rs.
5,000/- each in addition to the above sentence and on default to pay such fine they will have to
suffer further rigorous imprisonment for a month. Further all the convicts are sentenced to under go
one year rigorous imprisonment for the charge under Section 323/34 of the India Penal Code.
Sentences awarded for both of the charges will run concurrently.
5. The case of the prosecution, as unfolded by the First Information Report, may, in brief, be
described as under:
"The informant, who is a teacher at a middle school, submitted a written complaint
on 19-01-1996 to the in- charge of P.S. Barbighe, stating therein that on the aforesaid
Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.815 of 2006 dt.23-09-2025 date, when he
returned home from school, he saw his neighbour, accused Krishna Mahto,
constructing a stair that touched the ohari of his (informant's) house. In the course of
construction, the accused also damaged the informant's drain. It is stated that when
the informant tried to prevent the accused from constructing the stair, the accused
abused him. Again, when the informant asked him (accused) not to abuse, he went to
his house and returned with his two sons, namely Navin Kumar and Shishu Kumar
(accused). At that time, Navin was armed with a farsa, while accused Shishu was
carrying a lathi. It is alleged that accused Krishna Mahto ordered his sons to assault
the informant upon which accused Navin Kumar charged Farsa on the informant's
head with an intent to kill while accused Shishu Kumar started assaulting him by
lathi on his waist. The informant fell down due to the injuries caused. During the
assault, the informant raised a hulla, upon which some witnesses arrived and saved

him (informant) from further assault. Further, the informant was taken to the police
station where the information was recorded."
6. Learned counsel for the appellants submits that the appellants deserve acquittal in the present
case due to the reason that, during trial, the prosecution failed to produce the Patna High Court CR.
APP (SJ) No.815 of 2006 dt.23-09-2025 I.O. as well as the doctor for examination. He further
submits that, due to the non-examination of the doctor and in the absence of the injury report, it is
impossible to ascertain the nature of injury, and hence neither Section 307 nor Section 304 of the
Indian Penal Code is made out. Counsel further submits that the Investigating Officer has not been
examined, and it is due to this reason the prosecution's case has failed to ascertain the place and
time of occurrence. It is due to this reason, the case of the prosecution has completely failed, and
without any material, the Trial Court has convicted the accused persons under Sections 307/34 and
323/34 of the Indian Penal Code.
7. Learned APP for the State submits that it is true that the injury could not be proved and cannot be
proved without medical evidence, but on the other hand, the corroboration of the earlier statement
under Section 156 of the Evidence Act has been made out by the prosecution witnesses. Whatever
has been narrated in the FIR and by the other witnesses has come in the prosecution evidence of
other witnesses, particularly PW-3, PW-4, and PW-7 (the informant). He further submits that in
paragraph No. 22 of the Trial Court's order, it has been ascertained from the evidence that accused
Krishnandan Pd. Mahto went to his house, and after a while, he Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ)
No.815 of 2006 dt.23-09-2025 returned with his two sons, who were armed with farsa and lathi.
The appellant Krishnandan Pd. Mahto ordered his two sons to kill the informant, whereupon
appellant No. 2 gave a farsa blow to the head of the informant, while appellant No. 3, namely Shishu
Kumar, assaulted him by inflicting several blows with a lathi, due to which the informant fell down.
According to the prosecution, in view of this matter, the assault was committed by all the accused in
furtherance of the common intention, and hence Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code is applicable
by virtue of the ocular evidence, which is the best evidence. Therefore, learned counsel for the State
submits that the appeal be dismissed on this ground alone.
8. Upon hearing the parties and perusal of the record, it transpires to this Court that, admittedly, the
Investigating Officer and the Medical Officer have not been examined. Due to the non-examination
of the Medical Officer, the injury report could not be brought on record, and hence the injury could
not be proved. However, from the observation made by the Trial Court in paragraph No. 22 of the
judgment, and particularly from the evidence of PW-7 (the informant), PW-2 (wife of the
informant), and PW-3 (a co-villager), it has been adduced that Krishnandan Pd. Mahto went to his
house, Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.815 of 2006 dt.23-09-2025 and after a while, he returned
with his two sons, who were armed with farsa and lathi. On the order of Krishnandan Pd. Mahto, his
sons attacked the informant, due to which he was injured and fell down.
9. For better appreciation of this case, this Court feels it necessary to quote Section 34 of the Indian
Penal Code, which reads as follows:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10480948/ 3
Krishnandan Pd.Mahto @ Krishna Mahto ... vs State Of Bihar on 23 September, 2025
"Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention. When a criminal
act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of
such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done by him
alone."
10. The crux of this Section is that if any one of the accused has committed an act in furtherance of
the common intention, then all the accused shall be held responsible. Here in the present case, it is
true that injury has not been proved, but assault has been established. Therefore, this Court is of the
firm view that, due to the lack of injury report, Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code is not made out,
but Section 323 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code is made out. Hence, for this reason,
the conviction for the charge and the corresponding sentence under Section 307 are hereby set
aside, but the conviction under Section 323/34 of the Indian Penal Code is Patna High Court CR.
APP (SJ) No.815 of 2006 dt.23-09-2025 affirmed.
11. For the offence under Section 323/34 of the Indian Penal Code, one year rigorous imprisonment
has been imposed by the Sessions Court. This Court, prior to forming an opinion on the point of
sentence, analyzes Section 323, which states as follows:-
"Punishment for voluntarily causing hurt.-Whoever, except in the case provided for
by section 334, voluntarily causes hurt, shall be punished with imprisonment of
either description for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine which may
extend to one thousand rupees, or with both"
12. Section 323 of the Indian Penal Code provides that the punishment may extend to imprisonment
for a term which may extend to one year, or with a fine which may extend to one thousand rupees,
or with both.
13. This Court, considering the age of the present appellants at the time of the occurrence in 1996,
where the age of appellant No. 2 was 20 years and appellant No. 3 was 18 years, notes that they
came forward with a view to helping their father. Taking into account their young age, this Court,
adopting a liberal approach in sentencing, hereby reduces the sentence imposed on them from one
year rigorous imprisonment to five Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.815 of 2006 dt.23-09-2025
months simple imprisonment, along with a fine of Rs. 1000/-.
14. It further transpires to this Court from the record that the appellants were in custody for 10 days
during the trial, i.e., from 20.05.1996 to 30.05.1996, and further, upon conviction, they were in
custody from 20.06.2006 and were released after 14.11.2006 by the order passed by this Hon'ble
Court, meaning they were in custody for five months and odd days.
15. Hence, the custody period of five months and odd days already undergone by the appellants shall
be set off, and upon deposit of Rs. 1000/- each as fine, they shall be exonerated from all liabilities of
bail bond.

16. Accordingly, the judgment of conviction and order of sentence dated 20.09.2006 and
21.09.2006 respectively, passed by the Additional Sessions Judge (Fast Track Court Vth),
Sheikhpura, in Sessions Case No. 479 of 1996 / Trial No. 75 of 2006, arising out of Barbigha Police
Station Case No. 14 of 1996 is hereby set aside. Therefore, the appellants are hereby acquitted of the
charge under Section 307/34 of the Indian Penal Code, and the sentence under Section 323/34 of
the Indian Penal Code is treated as the period already undergone.
17. In the result, the appeal is dismissed with the Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.815 of 2006
dt.23-09-2025 aforesaid modification in conviction and sentence.
18. Since the appellants, namely, Naveen Kumar & Shishu Kumar of Cr. Appeal (SJ) No. 815 of
2006, are already on bail, and having been acquitted under Sections 307/34 of the Indian Penal
Code, let them be discharged from the liabilities of bail bonds and sureties, if any.
19. Let a copy of this judgment be sent to the concerned Court below along with the LCR.
