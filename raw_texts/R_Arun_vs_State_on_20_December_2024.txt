Addl.Public Prosecutor
ORDER
Challenging the order of dismissal dated 22.01.2024 in Crl.M.P.No.10060 of 2023, passed by the
learned Principal Special Judge under EC & NDPS Act, Chennai, the petitioner, who is the owner of
the vehicle viz.,Pulsar (Two wheeler), bearing Reg. No.TN- 12-AQ-7518, is before this Court with the
present Revision, for return of vehicle.
2. Mr.K.Prasanthan, the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner would submit that the
petitioner is the owner of the two vehicle viz.,Pulsor, bearing Reg. No.TN-12-AQ-7518 and he filed
Return of Property Petition stating that bike was seized from one Anand / A4 and produced before
the lower Court in B.No.930/2023. The petitioner is not an accused and nothing has been seized
from the vehicle. The petitioner purchased the vehicle by taking loan from Bajaj Finance and the
bike is used for petitioner's employment. Now, the vehicle has been seized, the petitioner forced to
pay EMI to the Bajaj Finance Limited, in default, his vehicle is likely to be possessed by the Finance
Company and due to the seizure of the vehicle, the petitioner is unable to attend his work. In
support of his contention, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis the learned counsel produced the
vehicle's R.C.Book, Insurance copy. The trial Court dismissed the petition, since the vehicle is liable
to be confiscated.
3. Mr.Hasan Mohammed Jinnah, the learned State Public Prosecutor would submit that on
11.10.2023 at about 8.00 Hrs, the Sub-Inspector of Police received secret information about the
illegal transportation of narcotic substance. On getting information, the Sub-Inspector of Police
gone to the sene of occurrence, Poonamallee Bus Stop, near Royal Bakery, along with his police
team. At that time, four unknown persons came in two wheelers, bearing Reg.No. TN-12- AQ-7518
and TN-13-Y-1303 DEI Orange Colour Bike. They were caught and enquired. The accused persons
viz., Akash/A1, Maran/ A2, Seenuraj/A3 and Anand/A4, were searched and found in possession of
3720 numbers of Nitravet-10 Tablets, and the same were seized under the cover of mahazar. A1 to
A4 were arrested and the bike was seized. The articles were produced before the Special Court, who
assigned A.No.1560/2023 and B.No.930/2023 on 14.12.2023. Now. The investigation has been

4. The learned State Public Prosecutor vehemently opposed the petition submitting that return of
property in the NDPS Act Cases cannot be entertained invoking Sections 457 and 451 of Cr.P.C., and
it is liable for confiscation under Section 52-A, 60, 61 and 63 of NDPS Act., unless the owner of the

R.Arun vs State on 20 December, 2024
conveyance proves that the conveyance was used without his knowledge and connivance, he has
taken all reasonable precaution against such use. In support of his contention, the learned State
Public Prosecutor relied on the Judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Suresh Nanda Vs.
Central Bureau of Investigation reported in (2008) 3 SCC 674 to stress the point that, where there is
a special Act dealing with subject, resort should be to that Act instead of general Act providing for
the matter connected with the specific Act. He stressed his argument mainly on Union of India Vs.
Mohanlal and Another reported in (2016) 3 SCC 379, wherein the Apex Court has given directions
for storage, seizure and sampling, handling and disposal of seized narcotic drugs and psychotropic
substances. Considering the piquant situation in which accumulation of huge quantities of seized
drugs and narcotics increased the chances of their pilferage for re-circulation in the market and also
finding that despite Central Government Standing https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Order
No.1/1989 and two subsequent Standing Orders, dated 10.05.2007 and 16.01.2015 giving directions,
directing that no sooner seizure of any narcotic and psychotropic and controlled substances and
conveyances is effected, the same shall be forwarded to the officer in-charge of the nearest police
station or to the officer empowered under Section 53 of the Act and Section 52-A(2) of the Act. The
sampling shall be done under the supervision of the Magistrate and the Central and State
Government and its agencies within six months from the date of the order take appropriate steps to
set up storage facilities for the exclusive storage of seized narcotic and psychotropic substances and
conveyances, duly equipped with vaults and double-locking system to prevent theft, pilferage or
replacement of the seized drugs. Further, the Apex Court given direction to constitute Drug Disposal
Committee and disposal of seized drugs lying in the Police Malkhanas and other places used for
storage of drugs and psychotropic substances.
5. The learned State Public Prosecutor would further submit that this Court in Crl.R.C(MD)No.41 of
2019 in the case of Nahoorkani Vs. The State of Tamil Nadu on 16.06.2023 held that when the
conveyance is seized under NDPS Act, the return of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis property does
not arise as contemplated under Sections 451 and 457 of Cr.P.C., and it is liable to be confiscated
under Section 63 of the NDPS Act in the light of special procedure under Section 52-A of the Act.
Any person claiming the ownership or right of the conveyance may approach the concerned Drug
Disposal Committee directly and make claim and the Drug Disposal Committee before taking a
decision on disposal of the vehicle, shall grant opportunity of hearing to the parties and pass
appropriate orders on the representation made by the party in accordance with law, as expeditiously
as possible, within a period of two months. Further, if any persons approach the trial Court for
release of vehicle, the property already produced before the trial Court and assigned R.P.Number
then such court shall conduct enquiry and pass suitable orders, as contemplated under Section 63 of
the NDPS Act or if the vehicle not produced before the Court then competent Court shall pass
appropriate order by directing the petitioner to approach concerned Drug Disposal Committee for
getting suitable relief. Further, in the event of trial Court / Special Court for NDPS release the
vehicle under Section 451 Cr.P.C., shall initiate the confiscation proceedings and dispose the vehicle
as contemplated under Section 63 of the NDPS Act.

R.Arun vs State on 20 December, 2024
6. Further, he relied on the order of this this Court in Crl.R.C.(MD)No.116 of 2024, dated
08.02.2024 wherein this Court, following the order passed in Nahoorkani's case (cited supra) held
that whenever a return of property is filed, the petitioner has to satisfy Sections 60, 61 and 62 of
NDPS Act. In yet another case, in Crl.R.C(MD)No.1395 of 2023, Gomathi Vs. State, dated
27.02.2024, this Court passed orders on the similar line of Nahoorkani's case. Further, he referred
Crl.R.C.No.675 of 2023 in the case of Salimrajan @ Salimraj Vs. State dated 12.07.2023 wherein this
Court again followed the Nahoorkani's case. In sum and substance, he argued that any property say
conveyance seized in NDPS Act cases cannot be returned as a matter of routine and it is only after
satisfying Sections 60, 61, 62, and 63 of the said Act.
7. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner opposed the contention of the learned State
Public Prosecutor and submitted that Mohanlal's case, refers to Section 52-A primarily with regard
to not following the Standing Order No.1/1989 and the subsequent Standing Orders, dated
10.05.2007 and 16.01.2015, which prescribed procedures to be followed while conducting seizure of
contraband, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis sampling, safe custody and disposal finding that
there is no uniform procedures followed in seizure, sampling and storing the narcotic in safe vaults
and handling and disposal of seized narcotics, lying in the malkhanas or any other storage place
without proper storage facility, thereby, the danger of recirculation of seized contraband into system
is very much likely, hence issued directions to the Investigation Agency, Magistrate and
Governments to follow guidelines. Further, submitted that this Court, following the Apex Court
Judgment in Sainaba Vs. State of Kerala and Anr in Crl.A.No.2005/2022, reported in 2022 (7) KHC
2731, wherein the Apex Court released the vehicle involved in the NDPS Act well after Mohanlals'
case. Hence, it cannot be said that Mohanlal's case places restrictions on release of vehicle. The
Sainaba's case, being the Judgment of the Apex Court this Court finding, it is binding under Article
144 of the Constitution of India entertained and allowed the return of property petition filed under
Sections 451 and 457. The citations referred by the State Public Prosecutor is no more res integra on
the point of return of property. He further added that this Court in Crl.R.C.(MD)No.41 of 2019,
Crl.R.C.(MD)No.116 of 2024 and Crl.R.C.(MD)No.1395 of 2023 and in Crl.R.C.(MD)No.675 of 2022,
the Sainaba's case was not considered. In view of the Apex Court https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
Judgment in Sainaba's case, the confiscation proceedings cannot be an embargo to consider the
return of property petition, but of course, the return of property petition to be considered on its own
merits and hence, there is no impediment to entertain the above petition.
8. I have heard the learned counsels appearing on either side and perused the materials available on
record.
9. On perusal of the records it is seen that in Mohanlal's case, the Apex Court finding is that, despite
issuance of the Standing Order No.1/1989 and the subsequent Standing Orders, dated 10.05.2007
and 16.01.2015, no uniform practice and procedures followed by State or Central Agencies in the
matter of drawing of samples at the time of seizure, storage of drugs in safes and vaults, not placed
in double- locking system and piquant situation arose by which accumulation of huge quantities of
the seized drugs and narcotics increased and the chances of their pilferage for re-circulation in the
market, hence put in place certain procedures and guidelines to the Investigation Agency,
Magistrate, Central and State Governments, and ordered formation of Drug Disposal Committee to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123860806/ 4
R.Arun vs State on 20 December, 2024
monitor the same. No direction with regard to the conveyance considered and issued.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Further, the Notification No.G.S.R.899(E), dated 23.12.2022
issued in terms of Section 52-A of the NDPS Act. The question whether there is any legal embargo in
view of confiscation proceedings under Sections 60 to 63 of the NDPS Act and whether petition
seeking return of property under Sections 451 and 457 can be entertained and decided has been
dealt in detail by the Karnataka High Court Division Bench in Rathnamma v. State rep., by PSI,
Channagiri Police Station, Davabagere District in CRL.P.No.3571/2021, which was in conflict to the
Division Bench Judgement of the Kerala High Court in Shajahan Vs. Inspector of Excise and Others
reported in 2019 SCC Online Ker 3685, hence the matter was referred to a Larger Bench by the
Kerala High Court and the Kerala High Court in the case of Pradeep B. Vs. The District Drug
Disposal Committee represented by its Chairman, Kasargod and Others in WA No.1304 of 2022,
dated 19.02.2024 dealt in detail, referring to Section 52-A, guidelines given in the Mohanlal's case
and held that jurisdictional Special Court under the NDPS Act has power to consider the grant of
interim custody of the vehicle under the Act by invoking powers under Section 457 of Cr.P.C., and
answered the reference accordingly. It had also referred to the orders passed by Allahabad High
Court in Shams Tavrej v. Union of India reported https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis in 2023 SCC
OnLine AII 1154 and Rajdhari Yadav v. State of U.P. Reported in 2022 SCC OnLine AII 583 and
Union of India v. Tejinder Singh reported in 2023 SCC OnLine Gau 729 and following Sainaba Vs.
State of Kerala (2022 (7) KHC 273) held interim custody of a vehicle involved under the NDPS Act
could be ordered. In Sainaba's case, the procedures contemplated and applicable in NDPS Act in
consonace with Cr.P.C., are dealt in detail. The Apex Court considering both NDPS Act and Cr.P.C.,
held as follows:-
“5. It has been opined by the High Court that the Court is not empowered to exercise
the jurisdiction under Section 451 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to release a
vehicle involved under NDPS Act in interim custody.
6.The appellant has urged inter alia that as per Section 36-C read with Section 51 of
the NDPS Act, Criminal Procedure Code would be application for proceedings by a
Special Court under NDPS Act and Section 451 has an inbuilt provision to impose any
specific condition on the appellant while releasing the vehicle. The appellant is
undoubtedly the registered owner of the vehicle but had not participated in the
offence as alleged by the prosecution nor had knowledge of the alleged transaction.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
7. Learned counsel seeks to rely on the judgment of this Court in Sunderbhai Ambalal Desai Vs.
State of Gujarat – 2003 (2) KLT 1089 (SC) = (2002) 10 SCC 283 opining that it is no use to keep
such seized vehicles at police station for a long period and it is open to the Magistrate to pass
appropriate orders immediately by taking a bond and a guarantee as well as security for return of
the said vehicle, if required any any point of time.
8. On hearing learned counsel for parties and in the conspectus of the facts and circumstances of the
case, and the legal provisions referred aforesaid, we are of the view that this is a appropriate case for
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123860806/ 5
R.Arun vs State on 20 December, 2024
release of the vehicle on terms and conditions to be determined by the Special Court.”
10. It is not in dispute that the petitioner is the owner of the vehicle and not in accused in this case.
The objection of the respondent seems to be that steps have been taken for confiscation proceedings.
It is several months has been passed still the confiscation proceeding is only conception stage and
nothing has been done. Further, if the vehicle is kept in open yard exposed to sunlight and rain, the
condition of the said vehicle will be deteriorating day- by-day and the value of the vehicle will get
diminished. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
11. Hence, following the Supreme Court Judgment, in Sainaba's case, and the Full Bench of Kerala
High Court in Pradeep's case, this Court finds the objection of the learned State Public Prosecutor
that there is total embargo in entertaining the petition for return of property under the relevant
provision of Cr.P.C., is no more res intergra. In view of the same, this Court is inclined to entertain
and consider the grant of interim custody of vehicles seized under the NDPS by invoking the power
under Sections 451 and 457 of Cr.P.C consequently under Section 497 and 503 BNSS, subject to the
confiscation proceedings.
12. It is seen that the petitioner produced Registration Certificate of the vehicle, Insurance and other
documents. Admittedly, the petitioner is not an accused. In this case, investigation completed and
charge sheet already filed in C.C.No.220 of 2024. In view of the same, this Court is inclined to allow
the Revision.
13. The lower Court following the guidelines given in Sunderbhai Ambalal Desai case, take
photographs, record the features of the vehicle, prepare a proceeding to be used as proof in the trial,
before releasing the vehicle to the petitioner. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
14. In view of the foregoing reasons, the order of dismissal dated 22.01.2024 in Crl.M.P.No.10060 of
2024, passed by the learned Principal Special Judge under EC & NDPS Act, Chennai, is set aside and
this Revision is allowed with a direction to the learned Principal Sessions Judge, to release the
vehicle viz.,Pulsar (Two wheeler), bearing Reg. No.TN-12-AQ-7518, in favour of the petitioner on the
petitioner submitting an undertaking on the following terms and conditions:-
i. The petitioner shall furnish an indemnity bond of Rs.10,000/- (Rupees Ten
Thousand Only) with two solvent sureties, undertaking to produce the vehicle as and
when directed by the court.
ii. The petitioner shall not sale, mortgage or transfer the ownership of the vehicle
during the pendency of the case.
iii. The petitioner shall not change or tamper with the identification of the vehicle in
any manner during pendency of the case.
iv. Any other condition, if any, to be imposed by the trial court.
