[3] Brief facts of the petitioners' case:
The Meetei/Meitei is one of the indigenous tribes among the ethnic tribes of Manipur. The Manipur
was an independent sovereignty country and Manipur was conquered by the British on 27th April,
1891. Thereafter, the region saw two kings only - Maharaja Churachand Singh (1891 - 1941 AD) and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/27575149/ 2
Petitioners vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 21 February, 2024
Maharaja Budhachandra Singh (1941 - 1949 AD).
India got independence on 15th August, 1947 from British colonial Rule and prior to India, Manipur
got independence on 14 th August, 1947 and on 21st September, 1949 Maharaja Bodhachandra,
Private Secretary Sanasam Gourahari Singh and ADC Mayengbam Anand Mohan Singh formally
signed the Manipur Merger Agreement. On 15th October, 1949, the Government of India officially
announced that Manipur became a part of India. In the Manipur Merger agreement, 1949, the
Government of India undertook certain terms and conditions for preserving various laws, customs
and conventions prevailing in the State pertaining to the socio economic and religious life of the
people. In the present case, earlier before the Merger Agreement, all Manipur people are the Tribe
but Meetei/Meitei community was left out while preparation of list of Scheduled Tribes under the
Indian Union.
The status of Meetei/Meitei Community before execution of the Merger Agreement on 21.09.1949 as
a "Tribe among Tribes of Manipur"
should be maintained by including the Meetei/Meitei community in the list of
Schedule Tribe under the Constitution of India as the Article VIII of the Merger
Agreement dated 21.09.1949 executed between the Maharaja of Manipur and
Government of India. The Meetei/Meitei of Manipur has lost the identity of the Tribe
while merging with the Union of India on September 21, 1949 and earlier Manipur
was simple classless tribal society. However, at the Review Petition No. 12 of 2023
Page 3 time of merging the Manipur with the Indian Union, 29 (twenty nine)
communities of Manipur have been included in the Scheduled Tribe List of Indian
Union and thereafter, as per the order dated 26.05.2003 of the Hon'ble Gauhati High
Court, Imphal Bench passed in W.P.(C) No. 4281 of 2002, Chongthu, Khoibu and
Mate have been included in the list of Schedule Tribes. Accordingly, now there are 34
(thirty four) numbers of tribal community of Manipur was included in the list of
schedule tribe of the Indian Constitution, but Meetei/Meitei Tribe was left out.
As per Article 342(1) and 366 (19, 23, 25) of the Indian Constitution, the
Meetei/Meitei community should be restored the Tribe Status by recognizing as a
tribe/tribal community by issuing presidential order after completing procedure and
modalities prescribed by the Government of India as the Meetei/Meitei are still tribe
but status of Meitei community was left out while preparation of scheduled tribe lists.
Meetei/Meitei tribe union and other organization have been demanding by
submitting various representations to the Union of India as well as the Government
of Manipur. Considering grievances of the people of Manipur, the Government of
India, Ministry of Tri bal Affairs wrote a letter No. 1902005/2012-C&IM dated
29.05.2013 to the Government of Manipur in reply to the representation submitted
by Scheduled Tribe Demand Committee whereby requesting for specific
recommendations along with latest socio-economic survey and ethnographic report.
Inspite of the letter dated 29.05.2013, the Government of Manipur failed to submit
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/27575149/ 3
Petitioners vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 21 February, 2024
the recommendation till date.
Meetei/Meitei Tribe Union has also submitted a representation to the Union of India
and in reply to the representation submitted by the petitioners' union, the Ministry of
Home Affairs, Government of India wrote a letter No. 12/78/2020-SS dated
20.05.2022 whereby forwarding the representation dated 18.04.2022 to the Ministry
of Tribal Affairs, Government of India for further necessary action.
Review Petition No. 12 of 2023 Page 4 Accordingly, the Ministry of Tribal Affairs,
Government of India also wrote a letter being No. 12026/09/2013-C&LM dated
31.05.2022 to the Government of Manipur (Home Department). But, the State
Government failed to take up the necessary action for submission of the
recommendation till date.
The petitioners beg to submit that as per the procedure of the Government of India
for inclusion in or exclusion from the list of Scheduled Tribes, it has provided the
following process:
"Whenever representations are received in the Ministry for inclusion/exclusion of
any community in/from the list of Scheduled Tribes of a State/UT, the Ministry
forwards that representation to the concerned State Government/U.T.
administration for recommendation as per the modalities. If the concerned State
Government/UT recommends the proposal, then the same is sent to the Registrar
General of India (RGI), if satisfied with the recommendation of the State
Government/UT, recommends the proposal to the Central Government. Thereafter,
the Government refers the proposal to the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes
for their recommendations. If the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes also
recommends the case, the matter is processed for the decision of the Cabinet.
Thereafter, the matter is put up before the Parliament in the form of a Bill to amend
the Presidential Orders."
[4] The learned senior counsel for the petitioners submits that the present case of the petitioners is
to complete the process which is pending before the State Government for the last 10 (ten) years
without any explanation but inclusion of the Meetei/Meitei Community is to be decided by the
competent authority after following due process of law.
Being aggrieved by the acts of the State Government, the petitioners are compelled to approach this
Court by filing W.P.(C) No. 229 of 2023 which was decided vide order dated 27.03.2023 and the
order reads as follows:
"17. In the result,
(i) The writ petition is disposed of.
Review Petition No. 12 of 2023 Page 5
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/27575149/ 4
Petitioners vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 21 February, 2024
(ii) The first respondent is directed to submit the
recommendation in reply to the letter dated
29.05.2013 of the Ministry of Tribal Affairs,
Government of India.
(iii) The first respondent shall consider the case of the petitioners for inclusion of the
Meetei/Meitei community in the Scheduled Tribe list, expeditiously, preferably
within a period of four weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order in terms
of the averments set out in the writ petition and in the line of the order passed in
W.P.(C) No. 4281 of 2002 dated 26.05.2003 by the Gauhati High Court."
Thereafter, All Manipur Tribal Union & 4 (four) others filed a third party appeal before the Ld.
Division Bench of this Hon'ble High Court with a leave application being M.C.(W.A.) No. 88 of 2023
and the said application was allowed vide order dated 19.10.2023.
The Chairman, Hill Area Committee (HAC) of the Manipur Legislative Assembly, Manipur namely,
Dinganglung Gangmei approached the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India challenging the judgment &
order dated 27.03.2023 of the Hon'ble Single Judge of the High Court of Manipur by filing Special
Leave Application (SLP) No. 19206 of 2023.
While pending the SLP being No. 19206 of 2023 before the Hon'ble Apex Court, the State
respondents filed an application being M.C.[W.P.(C)] No. 150 of 2023 seeking extension of time
limit for a further period of 1 (one) year for consideration of the Hon'ble Single Judge's direction
made at Para No. 17 (iii) of the judgment and order dated 27.03.2023 passed in W.P.(C) No. 229 of
2023. Thereafter, after hearing the parties, this Court passed an order dated 09.05.2023 in
M.C.[W.P.(C)] No. 150 of 2023 as follows:
"11. In the result,
(i) M.C. (WP) No. 150 of 2023 is allowed.
(ii) Time for consideration of the direction made at direction No. (iii) of the order
dated 27.03.2023 passed in W.P.(C) No. 229 of 2023 is extended for a Review
Petition No. 12 of 2023 Page 6 period of one year from the date of order in W.P.(C)
No. 229 of 2023 dated 27.03.2023."
The Hon'ble Apex Court was pleased to take up the said SLP on 17.05.2023 and after hearing the
parties, passed an order dated 17.05.2023 in the SLP No. 19206 of 2023 as under:
".......................................................
4. Mr. Colin Gonslaves, senior counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners submits
that the direction which was issued by the Single Jude in the order dated 27 March,
2023 is contrary to the settled position of law which has been expounded by a
Constitution Bench of this Court in State of Maharashtra -Vs- Milind & Ors.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/27575149/ 5
Petitioners vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 21 February, 2024
5. Since the Writ Appeal is pending before the Division Bench, we leave it open to the
parties who are aggrieved by the order of the Single Judge to make appropriate
submissions before the Division Bench in that regard.
6. Any Party aggrieved by an order passed by the Division Bench of the Writ Appeal
would be liberty to pursue its rights and remedies before this Court."
The learned senior counsel for the petitioners, Mr. M. Hemchandra submits that even though the
liberty is granted to the petitioner of the SLP No. 19206 of 2023 to approach the Ld. Division Bench
of this Court, the learned counsel for the petitioners in the said SLP submitted before the Hon'ble
Apex Court by relying on the Para No. 15 of a Constitution Bench which is cited as "(2001) 1 SCC 4,
State of Maharashtra -Vs- Milind & Ors." wherein the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Apex Court
was pleased to hold that :
"15. Thus, it is clear that States have no power to amend Presidential Orders.
Consequently, a party in power or the Government of the day in a State is relieved
from the pressure or burden of tinkering with the Presidential Orders either to gain
popularity or secure votes. Number of persons in order to gain advantage in securing
admissions in educational institutions and employment in State Services have been
claiming as belonging to either Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribes depriving
genuine and needy persons belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes
Review Petition No. 12 of 2023 Page 7 covered by the Presidential Orders, defeating
and frustrating to a large extent the very object of protective discrimination given to
such people based on their educational and social backwardness. Courts cannot and
should not expand jurisdiction to deal with the question as to whether a particular
caste, sub-caste; a group or part of tribe or sub-tribe is included in any one of the
Entries mentioned in the Presidential Orders issued under Article 341 and 342
particularly so when in Clause (2) of the said Article, it is expressly stated that said
orders cannot be amended or varied except by law made by Parliament. The power to
include or exclude, amend or alter Presidential Order is expressly and exclusively
conferred on and vested with the Parliament and that too by making a law in that
regard. The President had the benefit of consulting States through Governors of
States which had the means and machinery to find out and recommend as to whether
a particular caste or tribe was to be included in the Presidential Order. If the said
Orders are to be amended it is the Parliament that is in a better position to know
having means and machinery unlike Courts as to why a particular caste or tribe is to
be included or excluded by law to be made by Parliament. Allowing the State
Governments or Courts or other authorities or tribunals to hold enquiry as to
whether a particular caste or tribe should be considered as one included in the
Schedule of the Presidential Order, when it is not so specifically included, may lead to
problems. In order to gain advantage of reservations for the purpose of Article 15(4)
or 16(4) several persons have been coming forward claiming to be covered by
Presidential Orders issued under Article 341 and 342. This apart when no other
authority other than the Parliament, that too by law alone can amend the Presidential
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/27575149/ 6
Petitioners vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 21 February, 2024
Orders, neither the State Government nor the Courts nor tribunals nor any authority
can assume jurisdiction to hold enquiry and take evidence to declare that a caste or a
tribe or part of or a group within a caste or tribe is included in Presidential Orders in
one Entry or the other although they are not expressly and specifically included. A
Court cannot alter or amend the said Presidential Orders for the very good reason
that it has no power to do so within the meaning, content and scope of Article 341
and 342. It is not possible to hold that either any enquiry is permissible or any
evidence can be let in, in relation to a particular caste or tribe to say whether it is
included within Presidential Orders when it is not so expressly included."
Further, the learned senior counsel for the petitioners submitted that during the course of hearing of
the said SLP, the Hon'ble Apex Court was pleased to feel that the direction made at Para No. 17 (iii)
of the judgment and order dated 27.03.2023 passed by the Hon'ble Single Judge is against the
judgment of the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Apex Court.
Review Petition No. 12 of 2023 Page 8 The learned senior counsel for the petitioners submitted that
as aggrieved by the said innocuous direction given at Para No. 17(iii), the present review petition is
filed under Order XLVII Rule 1 of the CPC and the same is extracted herein below:
"1. Application for review of petition:
(1) Any person considering himself aggrieved -
(a) by a decree or order from which an appeal is allowed.
(b) by a decree or order from which no appeal is allowed or
(c) by a decision on a reference from a Court of Small Causes.
and who, from the discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise of
due diligence was not within his knowledge or could not be produced by him at the time when the
decree was passed or order made, or an account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the
record, or for any other sufficient reason, desires to obtain a review of the decree passed or order
made against him, may apply for a review of judgment to the Court which passed the decree or made
the order.
2. A party who is not appealing from a decree or order may apply for a review of judgment
notwithstanding the pendency of an appeal by some other party except where the ground of such
appeal is common to the applicant and the appellant, or when; being respondent, he can present to
the Appellate Court the case on which he applies for the review.
[Explanation - The fact that the decision on a question of law on which the judgment of the Court is
based has been reversed or modified by the subsequent decision of a Superior Court in any other
case, shall not be a ground for the review of such judgment.]"
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/27575149/ 7
Petitioners vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 21 February, 2024
The learned senior counsel further submits that the judgment and order dated
27.03.2023 of the Single Judge is an innocuous order and the petitioners have not
filed any appeal against it and moreover, the petitioners have no right to appeal as
the same is passed by consent of both parties.
Review Petition No. 12 of 2023 Page 9 Further, the learned senior counsel for the
petitioners further submits that the petitioners have discovered this point regarding
direction made in Para No. 17(iii) barred by the judgment of Constitution Bench of
the Hon'ble Apex Court as mentioned above.
Further, the learned senior counsel submits that Para No. 17
(iii) of the judgment is a simple direction for consideration as agreed by the parties
but due to technically very delicate in nature, the petitioners approach this Court for
modification/review by filing the present review petition.
[5] The grounds for review of the aforementioned Para No. 17(iii) are as follows:
(i) The words i.e. ".............. for inclusion of the Meetei/Meitei community in the
Scheduled Tribe List ..........." of the direction No. 17 (iii) of the judgment and order
dated 27.03.2023 are little bit confusion with the judgment laid down by the
Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Apex Court as the Hon'ble Apex Court felt thinks
that the said direction is direct direction for inclusion of a particular community. As
such, it is required to be modified as "The first respondent shall consider the case of
the petitioners by sending recommendation which would be in the wisdom of realm
of the State Government in reply to the Letter dated 29.05.2013 of the Ministry of
Tribal Affairs, Government of India, expeditiously preferably within a period of one
year from the date of order in W.P.(C) no. 229 of 2023 dated 27.03.2023 in terms of
the averments set out in the writ petition and in the line of the order passed in
W.P.(C) No. 4281 of 2002 dated 26.05.2003 by the Gauhati High Court."
(ii) As per the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court held in "(2001) 1 SCC 4, State of Maharashtra -vs-
Milind and Others" that the Courts cannot and should not expand jurisdiction to deal with the
question as to whether a particular case, sub-caste; a group or part of tribe or sub-tribe is included
in any one of the Entries mentioned in the Presidential Orders issued under Articles 341 and 342
particularly so when in Clause (2) of the said Article, it is expressly stated that said orders cannot be
amended or varied except by law made by Parliament. The Hon'ble Apex Court felt that the said
direction made in Para No. 17(iii) of the judgment is not in consonance with the decision of this
High Court.
Review Petition No. 12 of 2023 Page 10
(iii) The Para No. 17(iii) of the judgment dated 27.03.2023 of this Court was passed in a
misconception of law as the petitioners failed to assist the Court properly at the time of hearing of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/27575149/ 8
Petitioners vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 21 February, 2024
the said writ petition due to his misconception of fact and law.
(iv) The language in the direction made in Para No. 17(iii) of the judgment dated 27.03.2023 is
required to be modified in view of the judgment passed by the Hon'ble Apex Court as the same is not
in consonance with the decision of the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Apex Court.
[6] The learned senior counsel relying on the judgment & order passed by the Hon'ble Apex Court in
"Board of Control for Cricket in India & Anr. -Vs- Netaji Cricket Club & Ors. [(2005) 4 SCC 741], the
relevant paras are reproduced as under :
"89. Order 47 Rule 1 of the Code provides for filing an application for review. Such an
application for review would be maintainable not only upon discovery of a new and
important piece of evidence or when there exists an error apparent on the face of the
record but also if the same is necessitated on account of some mistake or for any
other sufficient reason.
90. Thus, a mistake on the part of the Court which would include a mistake in the
nature of the undertaking may also call for a review of the order. An application for
review would also be maintainable if there exists sufficient reason therefor. What
would constitute sufficient reason would depend on the facts and circumstances of
the case. The words "sufficient reason" in Order 47 Rule 1 of the Code are wide
enough to include a misconception of fact or law by a Court or even an advocate. An
application for review may be necessitated by way of invoking the doctrine "actus
curiae neminem gravabit".
[7] The relevant Para mentioned in the judgment passed in W.P.(C) No. 229 of 2023 is reproduced
herein below:
"17 (iii) . The first respondent shall consider the case of the petitioners for inclusion
of the Meetei/Meitei for inclusion of the Meetei/Meitei community in the Scheduled
Tribe list, expeditiously, preferably within a period of four weeks from the date of
receipt of a copy of this order in terms of the averments set out in the writ petition
and in the line of the order passed in WP(C) No. 4281 of 2002 dated 26.05.2003 b
the Gauahti High Court."
Review Petition No. 12 of 2023 Page 11
[8] For better appreciation in deciding the matter, Article 342 of
the Constitution of India is reproduced herein below:
"342. Scheduled Tribes -
(1) The President may with respect to any State (or Union Territory), and where it is a
State, after consultation with the Governor, thereof, by public notification, specify the
tribes or tribal communities or parts of or groups within tribes or tribal communities
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/27575149/ 9
Petitioners vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 21 February, 2024
which shall for the purpose of this Constitution be deemed to be Scheduled Tribes in
relation to that State (or Union Territory, as the case may be).
(2) Parliament may include in or exclude from the list of Scheduled Tribes specified
in a notification issued under clause (1) any tribe or tribal community or part of
group within any tribe or tribal community, but save as aforesaid a notification issued
under the said clause shall not be varied by any subsequent notification."
[9] After going through the above mentioned Para of Article 342, it is evident and clear that the
recommendation is of institutional recommendation in nature, but not an individual
recommendation.
[10] The learned senior counsel for the petitioners further pointed out points for determination of
the issue as under:
(i) The Para No. 17(iii) of the direction passed by this Court in the order dated
27.03.2023 for inclusion of a particular community in the Scheduled Tribe List is a
little bit confusion with the judgment laid down by the Constitution Bench of Hon'ble
Apex Court.
(ii) As per the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court held in (2001) 1 SCC 4, State of
Maharashtra V. Milind & Ors.
the Courts cannot or should not expand the jurisdiction to deal with the issue for inclusion of a
particular case, sub-caste; a group or part of tribe or sub-tribe in any one of the entries mentioned in
Presidential Orders issued under Article 341 and 342, the orders cannot be amended or varied
except by law made by Parliament.
(iii) The Para No. 17(iii) of the direction is due to misconception of fact and law.
(iv) The language mentioned in the direction aforementioned is required to be modified since the
same is not in Review Petition No. 12 of 2023 Page 12 consonance with the decision of the
Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Apex Court.
[11] Having regard to the above mentioned factual position, it would be apposite to distillate the core
aspects of the Clause (g) of the Annual Report, 2013 - 14 of the Ministry of Tribal Affairs,
Government of India and the same is reproduced as under:
"(g) Procedure for inclusion or exclusion from, the list of Scheduled Tribes.
In June, 1999 further revised on 25.06.2002, the Government approved modalities for deciding
claims for inclusion in, or exclusion from and other modification in the orders specifying the lists of
Scheduled Tribes. According to these modalities, only those claims that have been agreed to by the
concerned State Government/UT Administration, the Registrar General of India (RGI) and the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/27575149/ 10
Petitioners vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 21 February, 2024
National Commission for Scheduled Caste & Scheduled Tribes (now National Commission for
Scheduled Tribes) (NCST) will be taken up for consideration. Whenever representations are
received in the Ministry for inclusion/exclusion of any community in/from the list of Scheduled
Tribes of a State/UT, the Ministry forwards that representation to the concerned State
Government/U.T. Administration for recommendation as per the modalities. If the concerned State
Government/UT recommends the proposal, then the same is sent to the Registrar General of India
(RGI). The RGI, if satisfied with the recommendation of the State Government/UT, recommends
the proposal to the Central Government. Thereafter, the Government refers the proposal to the
National Commission for Scheduled Tribes for their recommendation. If the National Commission
for Scheduled Tribes also recommends the case, the matter is processed for the decision of the
Cabinet. Thereafter, the matter is put up before the Parliament in the form of a Bill to amend the
Presidential Order."
[12] The learned senior counsel for the petitioners further has drawn the attention of this Court to
the order passed by the Hon'ble Gauhati High Court passed an order dated 26.05.2003 in W.P.(C)
No. 4281 of 2002 of which, the learned Single Judge relied upon and passed the above direction at
Para No. 17(iii) and the same reads as thus:
"Heard Dr. N.K. Singh, learned counsel for the petitioners and also heard Mr. K.
Kumar, learned Additional C.G.S.C. appearing on behalf of the respondents 1 to 4 as
well as Mr. Kh. Babul Chandra, Review Petition No. 12 of 2023 Page 13 learned State
Counsel appearing on behalf of the State respondents 5 and 6.
The limited grievance of the writ petitioners in this writ petition is that pursuant to
the proposal of the Government of India to revise the list of Scheduled Tribes of the
States and Union Territories after 50 years of the functioning of the Constitution in
terms of Article 341 and 342 of the Constitution of India, the Govt. of Manipur vide
communications dated 31.12.99 and 3.1.2001 recommended 5 (five) Tribes namely,
Inpui, Liangmai, Rongmai, Thangal and Zeme for modification in the existing entry
with 3 (three) other Tribes namely, Chengthu, Keibu and Mete were proposed to
inclusion as new Tribes. But despite such recommendation of the Govt. of Manipur,
all the 8 (eight) Tribes - 5 (five) Tribes for modification and 3 (three) Tribes for
inclusion in the list of Scheduled Tribes as noticed above, have been left out of
consideration by the competent authority.
The respondents mainly respondents 1 to 4 contested this writ petition by filing the
affidavit-in-opposition. In paragraph 10 - 11 of the said affidavit-in-opposition it is stated that the
proposal for modification/inclusion of the 8(eight) Tribes has not been left out of consideration and
the consideration of the same is under process. It is also averred by the contesting respondents that
after examination, if the 8 (eight) communities are found to be eligible, necessary amendments in
the order specifying the list of Scheduled Tribes of Manipur would be carried out in terms of the
provisions of Articles 342 of the Constitution.
Paragraphs 10 and 11 of the affidavit-in-opposition, being relevant, are reproduced as under:

Petitioners vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 21 February, 2024
"10. That, with regard to the statements made in para 8 of the writ petition the
deponent denies the correctness of the same, the proposals of five communities
namely, Inpui, Liangmai, Rongmai, Thangal and Zeme for modifications in the
existing entries of the list of Scheduled Tribes and cases of three tribes namely
Chongthu, Koibu, and Mate for fresh inclusion are being processed as per the
approval modalities. Thus, the averments of the petitioners that the case of the above
referred eight communities has been left out of consideration is not correct. Their
requests are under examination.
11. That, as regard to the statements made in para 9 of the writ petition the deponent
begs to submit that the proposals of 8 communities are under consideration of the
Review Petition No. 12 of 2023 Page 14 Government and they are being processed as
per approved modalities. If after examination they are found eligible, necessary
amendments in the order specifying the list of Scheduled Tribes of Manipur would be
carried out as per provisions of Article 342 of the Constitution of India."
In view of the above referred statements made by the respondents and also upon hearing the
learned counsel for the parties, this Court is inclined to dispose of the writ petition with a direction
that the respondents 1 to 4 shall consider the case of the petitioners expeditiously in terms of the
averments made in the said paragraphs as alluded above.
However, liberty is granted to the petitioners to approach this Court if they are still aggrieved by any
decision taken by the respondents 1 to 4 in this regard.
A copy of the affidavit-in-opposition as produced by the respondents 1 - 4 be kept as to form part of
the record.
This disposes of the writ petition."
[13] And accordingly, the learned Single Judge passed the order dated 27.03.2023 in W.P.(C) No.
229 of 2023 with the following directions:
"17. In the result,
(i) The writ petition is disposed of.
(ii) The first respondent is directed to submit the recommendation in reply to the
letter dated 29.05.2013 of the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, Government of India.
(iii) The first respondent shall consider the case of the petitioners for inclusion of the
Meetei/Meitei community in the Scheduled Tribe list, expeditiously, preferably
within a period of four weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order in terms
of the averments set out in the writ petition and in the line of the order passed in
W.P.(C) No. 4281 of 2002 dated 26.05.2003 by the Gauhati High Court."

[15] Before proceeding further, it will be convenient to know the
contents of the order dated 17.05.2023 passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Special Leave
Petition (Civil) Diary No(s). 19206 of 2023 and the operative portion of the same is reproduced
herein below:
"1. .....................................................................................................
2. Besides the above aspects, the State of Manipur has adverted to two developments
which have taken place before the High Court:
(i) A Writ Appeal, MC(WA) No. 88 of 2023, has been filed by the Manipur Tribal
Union and others against the judgment dated 27 March, 2023 of a Single Judge of the
High Court of Manipur (Justice M.V. Muralidaran).
The Writ Appeal has been entertained by a Division Bench of the High Court on 15 May 2023. While
issuing notice, the writ appeal has been directed to be listed on 6 June, 2023; and
(ii) An application was moved by the State of Manipur before the Single Judge who passed the order
dated 27 March, 2023 for extension of time on which the Single Judge has directed that time for
considering direction (iii) in the order dated 27 March, 2023 shall stand extended by a period of one
year.
3. Mr. Tushar Mehta, Solicitor General of India states that having due regard to the sensitive law
and order situation which emerged in the State, the State Government, at this stage, had moved the
Single Judge for extension of time by a period one year so that the situation can normalize in the
meantime.
4. Mr. Colin Gonslaves, senior counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners submits that the
direction which was issued by the Single Judge in the order dated 27 March, 2023 is contrary to the
settled position of law which has been expounded by a Constitution Bench of this Court in State of
Maharashtra Vs. Milind & Ors.
5. Since the Writ Appeal is pending before the Division Bench, we leave it open to the parties who
are aggrieved by the order of the Single Judge to make appropriate submissions before the Division
Bench in that regard.
6. Any party aggrieved by an order passed by the Division Bench in the Writ Appeal would be at
liberty to pursue its rights and remedies before this Court.

[16] The Hon'ble Supreme Court in "State of Maharashtra V. Milind & Ors. [(2001) 1 SCC 4]" held
that :
"15. Thus, it is clear that States have no power to amend Presidential Orders.
Consequently, a party in power or the Government of the day in a State is relieved
from the pressure or Review Petition No. 12 of 2023 Page 16 burden of tinkering with
the Presidential Orders either to gain popularity or secure votes. Number of persons
in order to gain advantage in securing admissions in educational institutions and
employment in State Services have been claiming as belonging to either Scheduled
Caste or Scheduled Tribes depriving genuine and needy persons belonging to
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes covered by the Presidential Orders, defeating
and frustrating to a large extent the very object of protective discrimination given to
such people based on their educational and social backwardness. Courts cannot and
should not expand jurisdiction to deal with the question as to whether a particular
caste, sub-caste; a group or part of tribe or sub-tribe is included in any one of the
Entries mentioned in the Presidential Orders issued under Article 341 and 342
particularly so when in Clause (2) of the said Article, it is expressly stated that said
orders cannot be amended or varied except by law made by Parliament. The power to
include or exclude, amend or alter Presidential Order is expressly and exclusively
conferred on and vested with the Parliament and that too by making a law in that
regard. The President had the benefit of consulting States through Governors of
States which had the means and machinery to find out and recommend as to whether
a particular caste or tribe was to be included in the Presidential Order. If the said
Orders are to be amended it is the Parliament that is in a better position to know
having means and machinery unlike Courts as to why a particular caste or tribe is to
be included or excluded by law to be made by Parliament. Allowing the State
Governments or Courts or other authorities or tribunals to hold enquiry as to
whether a particular caste or tribe should be considered as one included in the
Schedule of the Presidential Order, when it is not so specifically included, may lead to
problems. In order to gain advantage of reservations for the purpose of Article 15(4)
or 16(4) several persons have been coming forward claiming to be covered by
Presidential Orders issued under Article 341 and 342. This apart when no other
authority other than the Parliament, that too by law alone can amend the Presidential
Orders, neither the State Government nor the Courts nor tribunals nor any authority
can assume jurisdiction to hold enquiry and take evidence to declare that a caste or a
tribe or part of or a group within a caste or tribe is included in Presidential Orders in
one Entry or the other although they are not expressly and specifically included. A
Court cannot alter or amend the said Presidential Orders for the very good reason
that it has no power to do so within the meaning, content and scope of Article 341
and 342. It is not possible to hold that either any enquiry is permissible or any
evidence can be let in, in relation to a particular caste or tribe to say whether it is
included within Presidential Orders when it is not so expressly included."

petition. Once they have invoked the appellate jurisdiction by filing an appeal, the
applicants have no right to seek impleadment in the review application filed by the

the Constitution of India and Order 47 Rule 1 of the CPC, 1908 with the observations of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court made in (2005) 4 SCC 741 and on perusal of the submissions made above by the
learned senior counsel, the present review petition filed by the present petitioners is maintainable.
[22] After joint perusal of the procedure laid down by the Government of India for inclusion in or
exclusion from the list of Scheduled Tribe issued under Article 342 of the Constitution of India in
Clause (g) of the Annual Report, 2013-14 of the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, Government of India

Petitioners vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 21 February, 2024
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in State of Maharashtra V. Milind & Ors. [(2001) 1 SCC 4], I am satisfied

27.03.2023 passed in W.P.(C) No. 229 of the 2023 which is impugned herein needs to be reviewed,
as the direction given at Para No. 17(iii) of the Hon'ble Single Judge is against the observation made
in the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court.
[23] Accordingly, the direction given at Para No. 17(iii) needs to be deleted and is ordered
accordingly for deletion of the Para No. 17(iii) of the judgment and order dated 27.03.2023 passed
in W.P.(C) No. 229 of 2023.
[24] With this finding and direction, this review petition is disposed of.
