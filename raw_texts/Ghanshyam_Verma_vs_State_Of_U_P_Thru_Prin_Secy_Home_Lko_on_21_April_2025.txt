Ghanshyam Verma vs State Of U.P. Thru. Prin. Secy. Home Lko. on 21 April, 2025
Ghanshyam Verma, in the F.I.R. Nos.11 of 2021, 0938/2020, 12/2021, 09/2021, 10/2021 and
139/2021, all under Sections 406, 419, 420, 467, 468, 471, 120-B I.P.C. and FIR No.625/2021 under
Sections 406, 420, 467, 468, 471, 504 and 506 I.P.C. registered at Police Station Gomti Nagar,
District Lucknow, with the prayer to enlarge him on bail.
(2) The first bail application of the accused/applicant has been rejected by this Court vide order
dated 05.10.2023 passed in Criminal Misc. Bail Application No.11217 of 2022 (Ghanshyam Verma
vs. State of U.P.).
(3) Since the above-captioned bail applications arise out of common factual matrix and common
F.I.Rs, therefore, they are being decided by this common order treating Criminal Misc. Bail
Application No.1901 of 2025 as the leading bail application.
(4) Heard learned Counsel for the applicant and learned AGA and perused the record available
before this Court in the above-captioned applications.
(5) As per the prosecution story, one Mr. Ram Prakash Singh, Proprietor of M/s Singh Construction,
lodged a complaint at Police Station Gomti Nagar, District Lucknow against five accused persons,
namely, Ghanshyam Verma (applicant herein) and co-accused Suresh Kumar, Balwant Singh,
Kamlawati Verma, Arvind Kumar Singh, alleging that co-accused Suresh Kumar Verma represented
himself that he is the proprietor of the firm, namely, R.S. Associates & Sons, having its office at
2/43, Vikas Khand, Gomti Nagar, Lucknow and had been awarded the work by the Government of
India to install drinking water and sanitation units in 75 districts of Uttar Pradesh under the 'Swatch
Bharat Abhiyan' and as such he needs people to execute the said work and as such invited the
complainant to his office. According to the complaint, when the complainant went to the office of
co-accused Suresh Kumar Verma, he found his son, namely, Ghanshyam Verma (applicant/accused
herein), and two others, namely, co-accused-Balwant Singh and co-accused Arvind Kumar Singh in
his office. All these people allured the complainant to believe that the firm of co-accused Suresh
Kumar Verma had been awarded the work of installing drinking water and sanitation units in
various districts of Uttar Pradesh and in that regard also showed various forged letters issued by the
Government of India. The accused persons also told the complainant to deposit an amount of Rs.
33,75,000/- as refundable security deposit for starting the work and after due discussion, the
complainant was told to execute and install the drinking water and sanitation units in district
Sitapur.
(6) It has also been alleged by the complainant that all accused persons visited along with him to
District Sitapur and the accused persons, after supervising various spot, zeroed on specific spot for
installation of units and, thereafter, the complainant through its firm M/s Singh Constructions
executed an agreement with R.S. Associates & Sons, wherein the complainant was allured to deposit
Rs. 33,75,000/- as refundable security deposit through RTGS. The complainant, after executing the
installation work of units, deposited the Bills of expenses and cost as per the terms of the agreement
to R.S Associates & Sons, wherein accused/applicant Ghanshyam Verma assured the complainant
that payments shall be made after one week. After one week, when the complainant deposited the
entire Bills for an amount of Rs. 2,21,09,850/-, all the accused persons started dilly-dallying tactics

Ghanshyam Verma vs State Of U.P. Thru. Prin. Secy. Home Lko. on 21 April, 2025
for payments. The said act of the accused persons raised suspicion in the mind of the complainant
and, thereafter, he came to know that accused persons were playing fraud against him and no such
contract of drinking water and sanitation was ever awarded to the firm R.S Associates & Sons by the
Government of India. After that the complainant made several visits to the office of the accused
persons but found the same closed and after enquiry, he was told that the office had shifted to 2/33,
Vikas Khand, Gomti Nagar, Lucknow. The complainant visited the new office of the accused persons
and again met co-accused Suresh Kumar Verma, his son, accused/applicant Ghanshyam Verma, and
two other, namely, Balwant Singh and Arvind Kumar Singh in his office and on demanding his
outstanding amount, accused persons abused him and threatened to face dire consequences, in case
the complainant ever come to them to demand his outstanding money.
(7) Based on the aforesaid allegations, FIR No.11 of 2021 dated 07.01.2021 was initially registered
under Section 406, 420 IPC, at police station Gomti Nagar, Lucknow, however, during the course of
investigation, Sections 419, 467, 468, 471, 120-B I.P.C. have been added.
Accused/applicant-Ghanshyam Verma is in jail since 02.01.2022.
(8) As far as the accused/applicant Ghanshyam Verma is concerned, learned Counsel for the
applicant has submitted that applicant has not committed any offence as alleged in the FIR.
According to the learned Counsel, the entire allegations are leveled against his family with oblique
motive. He has stated that the complainant himself has alleged in the impugned F.I.Rs. that
agreement of the work was executed between M/s Singh Construction belonging to the complainant
and M/s R.S Associates & Sons belonging to co-accused Suresh Kumar Verma. According to learned
Counsel, accused/applicant Ghanshyam Verma is neither a Director nor a partner in the firm,
namely, M/s R.S. Associates & Sons nor he is even a witness to the agreement and the alleged money
of Rs. 33,75,000/- has been credited to the account of M/s R.S. Associates & Sons. According to
learned Counsel, accused/applicant Ghanshyam Verma has been made an accused merely being the
son of co-accused Suresh Kumar Verma and in any case his father (accused Suresh Kumar Verma)
had applied for obtaining the contract from "Jal Jeevan Mission Scheme", which was a brain child of
Ministry of Jal Shakti and as such his father was orally assured of being awarded the contract and
mere formalities were to be concluded. According to learned Counsel, concerned official of the
Ministry had asked his father to procure the contracts from various investors so as to show that the
firm in question was competent enough to undertake the project. He stated that in any case,
charge-sheet in the case has already been filed under Sections 406, 419, 420, 467, 468, 471 IPC and
the investigation stands completed. Applicant undertakes that he will not tamper with any
documentary evidence. He has also stated that he is a married persons with a six year old daughter
and he is the sole earning member in the family and a property dealer by profession. He has been
falsely implicated in the present case and is in jail since 02.01.2022 and as such he prays to enlarge
him on bail.
(9) Learned Counsel for the accused/applicant further submitted that the first bail application of the
applicant has been rejected by this Court vide order dated 05.10.2023 passed in Criminal Misc. Bail
Application No.11217 of 2022 (Ghanshyam Verma vs. State of U.P.) and while rejecting the same,

and conclude it, expeditiously, if possible, within a period of six months, however, the trial
