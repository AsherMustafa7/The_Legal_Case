BY STATE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR,

BANGALORE - 560 001 ... RESPONDENT
(BY SRI ASHOK N NAIK, SPL.P.P.)
THIS CRIMINAL APPEAL IS FILED UNDER SECTION 12
OF KCOCA ACT PRAYING TO SET ASIDE THE ORDER DATED
07.02.2019 IN SPL.C.NO.872/2018 ON THE FILE OF THE
PRINCIPAL CITY CIVIL AND SESSIONS JUDGE, BANGALORE
ARISING OUT OF CR.NO.221/2017 OF RAJARAJESHWARI NAGAR
P.S. FOR THE OFFENCE P/U/S 302, 120B, 114, 118, 109, 201,
203, 204, 35 OF IPC AND SECTIONS 15(1), 25(1), 25(1B), 27(1)
OF INDIAN ARMS ACT AND SECTIONS 3(1)(I),3(2),3(3),3(4) OF
KARNATAKA CONTROL OF ORGANIZED CRIME ACT, 2000.
THIS CRIMINAL APPEAL COMING ON FOR FURTHER
HEARING THIS DAY, THE COURT DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING:
JUDGMENT
Aggrieved by the rejection of their application under Section 167(2) of Cr.P.C. for bail, accused Nos.1
to 8, 13 and 14 in Special CC No.872/2018 on the file of Principal City Civil and Sessions Judge,
Bengaluru, have preferred the above appeal.
2. In connection with the murder of a Journalist by name Gauri Lankesh, Rajarajeshwari Nagar
Police registered Crime No.221/2017 for the offences punishable under Section 302 of IPC and
under Section 25 of Arms Act, against unknown accused on the complaint of Kavitha Lankesh, the
sister of the deceased.
3. In that case, on 29-05-2018 a chargesheet was filed against one Naveen Kumar. On 14-08-2018
the Investigating Officer invoked the provisions of Section 3 of the Karnataka Control of Organized
Crime Act, 2000 (hereinafter referred to as 'KCOCA' for short) in the FIR. Therefore, the case was
transferred to the Special Court.
4. On invoking the provisions of Section 3 of the KCOCA, the Investigating Officer filed application
under Section 22 (2)(b) of KCOCA and under Section 167(2) of Cr.P.C. seeking extension of time to
file the chargesheet. The date of arrest of the appellants and the date of their remand to the judicial
custody as mentioned in the said application are as follows:

5. The application under Section 22 (2) (b) of KCOCA was filed on 23-8-2018. The said application
was allowed on 29-8-2018. The extended period for filing of chargesheet expired on 27-11-2018. On
28-11-2018, the appellants filed application under Sections 167(2) Cr.P.C. seeking statutory bail on
the ground that the chargesheet was not filed within the prescribed time. On that day, the trial Court
directing the Registry to verify whether the chargesheet is filed, adjourned the matter to 28-12-2018.
The application was opposed by the prosecution. The trial Court by the impugned order rejected the
application holding that the chargesheet is filed on 23-11-2018 itself. That is within the prescribed
time.
Submissions of Sri. C.V. Srinivas, learned counsel for the appellants assailing the order are as
follows:
6. The chargesheet was not filed on 23-11-2018 and that is ante-dated. Whenever the chargesheet is
filed Rule 10(1) of Karnataka Criminal Rules of Practice, 1968 requires the judge to sign on the
chargesheet and the Chief Administrative Officer to enter the same in Register No.I. Rule 10(2) and
(3) of Karnataka Criminal Rules of Practice require the Magistrate to examine the chargesheet and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148342256/ 4
Amol Kale vs State Of Karnataka on 7 February, 2022
take steps to secure the documents referred to in the chargesheet, properties seized in the case and
the FIR if they are not produced along with the chargesheet and issue process. As per the said
provisions, whenever the Magistrate proceed to issue process, the Registry has to enter the
chargesheet in Register No.III that is the Register of Criminal Cases. Section 207 Cr.P.C. requires
the Magistrate to furnish the copies of the chargesheet, enclosures and FIR to the accused soon after
filing of the chargesheet. But no such entries were made in Register Nos.I and III. Preliminary
chargesheet was filed on 30-5-2018. The final chargesheet should have been filed within 90 days.
Even the time extended under the order dated 23-8-2018 expired on 27-11-2018. In the registry's
note that the chargesheet is filed on 23-11-2018 is not creditworthy as the date 23-11-2018 is
interpolated. The moment the application under Section 167(2) was filed, the Sessions Judge could
have secured the chargesheet and examined that instead of adjourning the case to 28-11-2018. That
leads to inference that the chargesheet was not filed on 23-11-2018. Despite the appellants filing
application under Right to Information Act, seeking information of the entries in the Register Nos. I
and III of Criminal Rules of Practice, the Information Officer did not furnish the relevant
information. That goes to show that on 23-11-2018 the chargesheet was not filed. The chargesheet is
purportedly filed on getting the sanction order. The sanction order was purportedly issued on
23-11-2018. It would not have been possible to get the sanction order and include that in the
chargesheet and file the chargesheet on the same day as the chargesheet copies run into thousands
of pages. Therefore, the impugned order is unsustainable in law. The chargesheet copies were not
furnished to the accused within 180 days and there was violation of Rule 10 of Karnataka Criminal
Rules of Practice.

(xii) Rahul Shivaji Khomane Vs. The State of Maharashtra;12
(xiii) Mathias Vijay Toppo Vs. The State of Jharkhand and others;13
(xiv) Akul Ravi Teja @ Bulli Vs. The State of Andhra Pradesh14 Submissions of learned Special
Public Prosecutor justifying the impugned order are as follows:
8. Section 12 of KCOCA provides for an appeal only against an order which is not interlocutory in
nature. The order extending time to file the chargesheet, adjourning the matter to 28-12-2018 to
verify of the chargesheet is filed are all interlocutory orders and they cannot be questioned in an
appeal under Section 12 of KCOCA. Some of the appellants were secured in the case on body
warrants. Such securing of the appellants does not amount to their arrest and remand to the judicial
custody. Therefore, they cannot claim that chargesheet was not filed within 180 days of their arrest.
On 23-11-2018 the case was not listed for hearing. Therefore, the filing of the chargesheet was not
Crl.Bail application No.2375/2021 W.P.(Crl.) No.371/2018;
mentioned in the ordersheet. Rule 10(1) of the Rules requires the Judge only to initial on the
chargesheet and does not mandate him to bring that in the ordersheet on the very same day. Wild
and baseless allegations are made against the Judicial Officer which is condemnable. Another
accused Mohan Naik challenged the very same order before this Court in Crl.P.No.5507/2019 which
came to be dismissed on merits. Therefore, the same matter cannot be re-agitated in this case. Some
other co-accused filed Criminal Petition Nos. 8325/2018 and 5507/2019 claiming bail on the very
same grounds and those petitions were dismissed rejecting the contentions of those accused. On
that count also, this appeal is not maintainable. Section 207 Cr.P.C. is only directory and not
mandatory. It only says that the Magistrate shall without delay furnish the copies to the accused. It
does not say that the chargesheet copies shall be furnished within the time prescribed under Section
167(2) of Cr.P.C. Since chargesheet copies are voluminous, there may be some delay in furnishing
the copies. Section 173(8) of Cr.P.C. empowers the Investigating Officer to file further chargesheet.
Therefore, there is no merit in the contention that the chargesheet filed earlier cannot be treated as
final chargesheet.

9. In support of his submissions, he relied on the following judgments:
(i) Sanjay Dutt Vs. State through CBI Bombay
(ii) Suresh Kumar Bhikamchand Jain Vs. State of Maharashtra and another;16
(iii) Afzal Ibrahim Jariwala Vs. State of Maharashtra17
(iv) Bhole Alias Bholesh Vs. The State of Madhya Pradesh;18
(v) Mohan Nayak Vs. State of Karnataka19
10. Having regard to the rival submissions, the point that arises for consideration is, "Whether the
impugned order of rejection of application of the appellants for bail under Section 167(2) of Cr.P.C.
suffers illegality?"
11. Though several grounds are urged before this Court to challenge the impugned order, the order
of the trial Court indicates that the application was filed on the (1994) 5 Supreme Court Cases 410
(2013) 3 Supreme Court Cases 77 2002 SCC Online Bombay 1227;
1992 SCC Online MP 209;
Crl.Appeal No.505/2019 DD 13-7-2021; sole ground that chargesheet was not filed within the
prescribed period. Admittedly, the case involved the offences under KCOCA, though initially case
was registered only for the offences under Section 302 of IPC and Section 25 of the Arms Act.
12. Section 167(2) of Cr.P.C. relied on by the appellants reads as follows:
"167. Procedure when investigation cannot be completed in twenty four hours.
(2) The Magistrate to whom an accused person is forwarded under this section may,
whether he has or has no jurisdiction to try the case, from time to time, authorise the
detention of the accused in such custody as such Magistrate thinks fit, for a term not
exceeding fifteen days in the whole; and if he has no jurisdiction to try the case or
commit it for trial, and considers further detention unnecessary, he may order the
accused to be forwarded to a Magistrate having such jurisdiction:
Provided that-
(a) the Magistrate may authorise the detention of the accused person, otherwise than
in the custody of the police, beyond the period of fifteen days; if he is satisfied that
adequate grounds exist for doing so, but no Magistrate shall authorise the detention
of the accused person in custody under this paragraph for a total period exceeding,-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148342256/ 7
Amol Kale vs State Of Karnataka on 7 February, 2022
(i) ninety days, where the investigation relates to an offence punishable with death,
imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term of not less than ten years;
(ii) sixty days, where the investigation relates to any other offence, and, on the expiry
of the said period of ninety days, or sixty days, as the case may be, the accused person
shall be released on bail if he is prepared to and does furnish bail, and every person
released on bail under this sub- section shall be deemed to be so released under the
provisions of Chapter XXXIII for the purposes of that Chapter."
13. If the case involved only offences under IPC and Arms Act, in the ordinary course, the
chargesheet should have been filed within 90 days from the date of arrest of the accused, otherwise,
they were entitled for grant of bail. Since the provisions of Section 3 of the KCOCA are involved in
the matter, Section 22 of the said Act becomes applicable. Section 22 (1) and (2) of the KCOCA
relevant for the purpose of this case read as follows:
"22. Modified application of certain provisions of the Code. - (1) Notwithstanding
anything contained in the Code or in any other law, every offence punishable under
this Act, shall be deemed to be a cognizable offence within the meaning of clause (c)
of section 2 of the Code and "Cognizable case" as defined in that clause shall be
constructed accordingly.
(2) Section 167 of the Code shall apply in relation to a case involving an offence
punishable under this Act subject to the modifications that, in sub- section (2), -
(a) The references to "fifteen days" and "Sixty days" wherever they occur, shall be
construed as references to "Thirty days" and "ninety days"
respectively;
(b) After the proviso, the following proviso shall be inserted, namely:-
"Provided further that if it is not possible to complete the investigation within the
said period of ninety days, the Special Court shall extend the said period up to one
hundred and eighty days on the report of the Public Prosecutor indicating the
progress of the investigation and the specific reasons for the detention of the accused
beyond the said period of ninety days."
14. The reading of the above provisions show that the Special Court has the power to extend the
period of 90 days upto 180 days on the request of the Public Prosecutor. Therefore, the only
question in the case was, whether the chargesheet in the case on hand was filed within those 180
days.
15. Though several judgments are relied on by both side relating to Section 167(2) Cr.P.C., the ratio
in the said judgments is that, if the chargesheet is not filed within 90 days as contemplated under
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148342256/ 8
Amol Kale vs State Of Karnataka on 7 February, 2022
Section 167(2) of Cr.P.C., the accused is entitled to statutory bail. By virtue of operation of Section
22 of KCOCA, the said time gets extended upto 180 days.
16. As rightly pointed out by learned Special Public Prosecutor, the other contentions that the
accused were not heard on the application under Section 22 for extension, the chargesheet copies
were not furnished to them, etc., were the interlocutory orders. They were not appealable under
Section 12 of the Act. Moreover, the appellants did not challenge those orders, therefore, they
attained finality. Therefore, now it is not open to the appellants to question them in this proceeding.
17. The attack on the impugned order was that chargesheet was not filed on 23-11-2018, but that was
ante-dated. The trial Court rejected the said contentions. The appellants did not seek any
administrative action against the Ministerial officer who allegedly interpolated the date 23-11-2018
nor the presiding officer on the ground of judicial impropriety. Under Section 114 of the Indian
Evidence Act, 1872 illustration (e) there is presumption that judicial acts or official acts have been
regularly performed. Except for scandalizing the office staff and the Judge, nothing was done to
rebut the said presumption.
18. It is material to note that the application under Section 167(2) of Cr.P.C. was made before the
trial Court by accused Nos.1 to 8, 11 to 14. The said applications were rejected by the trial Court by
common impugned order. Challenging that order, accused No.11 filed Crl.A.No.505/2019 before this
Court on the same grounds. In Crl.A.No.505/2019, this Court rejected the contention of the accused
that chargesheet was not filed within 180 days and records were manipulated to depict so and
dismissed the appeal. That order has attained finality. Therefore, it is not open to the appellants to
urge the same ground by filing parallel appeal.
19. If the ground that chargesheet was not filed within ninety days fails then nothing survives in this
appeal. In the light of the aforesaid facts and circumstances, this Court does not find it necessary to
refer to each of the judgments relied upon by learned Counsel on both side. The appeal is dismissed.
