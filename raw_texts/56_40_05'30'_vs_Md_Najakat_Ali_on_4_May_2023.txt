56:40 +05'30' vs Md. Najakat Ali on 4 May, 2023
[1] By the present petition under Article 227 of the Constitution, the
petitioner herein challenges the impugned order dated 27.02.2023 passed by the Ld. Civil Judge
(Senior Division), Imphal East in Judicial Misc.Case No.483 of 2022 (Ref. :- Original Suit No.8 of
2014/55 of 2014). By way of Judl. Misc. Case No.483 of 2022, the petitioner who is defendant in the
suit pending before the Trial Court seeks leave of the Court for calling the case records of Mut. Case
No.314/SDC/HNG/2013 from the Court of Ld. Sub-Deputy Collector, Heingang to enable him to
prove that order dated 06.04.2013 was passed by the Ld. Sub-Deputy Collector, Heingang with full
knowledge and consent of defendant No.3 at the time of leading evidence of defendant No.1. Vide
impugned order dated 27.02.2023, the application was rejected.
CRP(C.R.P.Art.227) No.17 of 2023 Page 3
[2] The brief fact of the case in nutshell is that the respondent
No.2/defendant No.3,Surya Bahadur Chhetri (now deceased and represented by LRs) was the owner
and the recorded pattadar of the Agricultural land under patta No.91/101(Old), 16(New) covered by
C.S. Dag No.98 measuring an area of .66 acre situated at Village No.9 - Chingmeirong East and he
transferred the said land to the petitioner herein/defendant No.1 under a kutcha sale deed dated
12.02.2013. Thereafter, name of the petitioner/defendant No.1 was entered into the land records of
right by cancelling the name of respondent No.2/defendant No.3 vide mutation order dated
06.04.2013 passed by the Ld. SDC, Heingang in Mutation Case No.314 of 2013. It is stated that the
mutation proceeding was done with the knowledge and consent and in presence of respondent
No.2/defendant No.3 who also took part in the mutation proceeding. Thereafter, the
petitioner/defendant No.1 transferred the said land to proforma respondent No.3/defendant No.2,
H.R. Hringpham by executing a Regd. Sale Deed bearing No.396 (v) dated 12.04.2013 of the
Sub-Registrar, Sawombung, Imphal East, Manipur. Subsequently the name of proforma respondent
No.3/defendant No.2 was entered in the records of right of the said land vide mutation order dated
18.04.2013 passed by the Ld. SDC, Heingang in Mutation Case No.351/SDC/IE/2013. Thereafter,
respondent No.1/plaintiff filed Original Suit No.8 of 2014/55 of 2014 before the Court of Ld. Civil
Judge (Senior Division), Imphal East against the petitioner as defendant No.1, proforma respondent
No.3 as defendant No.2 and respondent No.2 as defendant No.3 alleging that respondent
No.1/plaintiff purchased the land from CRP(C.R.P.Art.227) No.17 of 2023 Page 4 respondent
No.3/defendant No.2 under a Regd. Sale Deed. The petitioner/defendant No.1 entered his
appearance in the above suit and filed his written statement. The respondent No.3/defendant No.2
also entered her appearance and filed written statement-cum-counter claim in connection with the
suit. The respondent No.2/defendant No.3 also filed his written statement alleging that the entry of
the name of the petitioner/defendant No.1 in the record of right of the aforesaid land was made
behind his back and without his knowledge and such subsequent transferred made by the
petitioner/defendant No.1 to respondent No.3/defendant No.2 cannot be acted upon the eye of law.
The suit filed by respondent No.1/plaintiff was dismissed for non-prosecution and the counter claim
made by the proforma respondent No.3/defendant No.2 is pending for disposal. During pendency of

56:40 +05'30' vs Md. Najakat Ali on 4 May, 2023
the suit, the petitioner/defendant No.1 filed Judl. Misc. Case No.483 of 2022 before the Ld. Civil
Judge (Senior Division), Imphal East under Order VIII Rule - 1A(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure,
1908 read with Section 151 of the same Code praying for calling the case records of Mutation Case
No.314/SDC/HNG/2013 from the Ld. SDC, Heingang in connection with the said suit so as to
enable the petitioner/defendant No.1 to prove that the order for recording the name of the
petitioner/defendant No.1 by cancelling the name of respondent No.2/defendant No.3 was passed
by the Ld. SDC, Heingang with the full knowledge and consent of the respondent No.2/defendant
No.3 and he was present in the said proceeding. The respondent No.2/defendant No.3 filed his
written objection to the Judl. Misc. Case No.483 of 2022.
CRP(C.R.P.Art.227) No.17 of 2023 Page 5
[2.1] On that day, the petitioner/defendant No.1 also filed a Misc.Case
being Judl. Misc. Case No.484 of 2022 before the Ld. Civil Judge (Senior Division), Imphal East
under Order XVI Rule 6 of the Code of Civil Procedure read with Section 151 of the same Code for
allowing him to file certified copy of the order dated 06.04.2013 passed by the Ld. SDC, Heingang in
Mutation Case No.314 of 2013 for recording his name in the records of right of the suit land by
cancelling the name of respondent No.2/defendant No.3 from the land records. The Ld. Civil Judge
(Senior Division), Imphal East has taken up the said application first and allowed the prayer.
[2.2] Vide impugnedorder dated 27.02.2023, the Ld. Civil Judge (Senior Division), Imphal East
rejected the prayer sought by the petitioner/defendant No.1 on the ground that it is not for the
petitioner/defendant No.1 to prove that the order dated 06.04.2013 in Mutation Case
No.314/SDC/HNG/2013 was passed with the consent of the present respondent No.2/defendant
No.3, rather the burden of proof lies on the party who denies it and as such there is no necessity for
calling the case record of Mutation Case No.314/SDC/HNG/2013 from the Court of the Ld. SDC,
Heingang. [2.3] Being aggrieved by the same, the petitioner/defendant No.1 challenges the
impugned order mainly on the ground that the case record of Mutation Case No.314 of 2013 in the
Court of Ld. SDC, Heingang is very much required to decide the real dispute, as respondent
No.2/defendant No.3 alleged that the mutation order was done without his knowledge while it is the
CRP(C.R.P.Art.227) No.17 of 2023 Page 6 specific case of the petitioner/defendant No.1 that
respondent No.2/defendant No.3 was very much present during the proceedings of the Mutation
Case and the mutation order was passed in his presence.
[3] This Court issued notice on 29.03.2023 to the respondents and directed the
petitioner/defendant No.1 to take steps by speed post upon respondent No.1 and respondent No.2
and dasti on respondent No.3. [3.1] The respondent No.3 entered appearance through her counsel,
but none appeared on behalf of respondent No.1 and LRs of respondent No.2 inspite of service of
notice by speed post.
[4] Heard Mr. N. Ibotombi, learned senior counsel assisted by Mr. A. Rommel, learned counsel for
the petitioner/defendant No.1 and Ms. L. Brizet Devi, learned counsel for respondent
No.3/defendant No.2. [5] Mr. N. Ibotombi, learned senior counsel for the petitioner/defendant No.1
submits that it is the specific case of the petitioner/defendant No.1 that respondent No.2/defendant
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163036012/ 4
56:40 +05'30' vs Md. Najakat Ali on 4 May, 2023
No.3 transferred the said land in his favour and respondent No.2/defendant No.3 was present
during the proceeding of Mutation Case No.314 of 2013 in the Court of Ld. SDC, Heingang. On the
other hand, the respondent No.2/defendant No.3 denies that the mutation proceeding of Mutation
Case No.314 of 2013 and mutation order dated 06.04.2013 were passed by the Ld. SDC, Heingang
without his knowledge and in his absence.
CRP(C.R.P.Art.227) No.17 of 2023 Page 7
[6] Mr. N. Ibotombi, learned senior counsel also states that by allowing
the Misc.Case being Judl. Misc. Case No.484 of 2022 filed before the Ld. Civil Judge (Senior
Division), Imphal East, the plaintiff/respondent No.1 filed on record a certified copy of the mutation
order dated 06.04.2013 passed by the Ld. SDC, Heingang in Mutation Case No.314 of 2013.
However, he clarifies that in the certified copy, original signature of the respondent No.2/defendant
No.3 is not present. Hence, calling for record of the mutation proceeding from the Court of Ld. SDC,
Heingang with respect to Mutation Case No.314 of 2013 is very much required for proving the case
of the petitioner/defendant No.1. Mr. N. Ibotombi, learned senior counsel for the petitioner prays
that the impugned order be set aside and the prayer for calling of the records of Mutation Case
No.314/SDC/HNG/2013 from the Court of Ld. SDC, Heingang be allowed. [7] Ms. L. Brizet, learned
counsel for respondent No.3/defendant No.2 supports the submission of Mr. N. Ibotombi, learned
senior counsel for the petitioner.
[8] From the pleadings of the parties, it is seen that the case of the petitioner/defendant No.1 is that
the suit land was transferred by respondent No.2/defendant No.3 in his favour and the suit land was
recorded in his name in presence of respondent No.2/defendant No.3 who also signed in the case
record of the said proceedings. On the other hand, respondent No.2/defendant No.3 denies that the
entry of the petitioner/defendant No.1 was done without his knowledge and behind his back.
CRP(C.R.P.Art.227) No.17 of 2023 Page 8
[9] A plain reading of Section 101 of the Indian Evidence Act reveals
that the burden of proof is on the person who asserts existence of certain fact and desires the Court
to pass an order in his favour then, Illustration (b): A desires a Court to give judgment that he is
entitled to certain land in the possession of B, by reason of facts which he asserts, and which B
denies to be true. A must prove the existence of those facts.
[10] In the recent case of Smriti Debbarma (Dead) through Legal Representative vs. Prabha Ranjan
Debbarma and Ors. (04.01.2023 - SC):
MANU/SC/0010/2023: AIR 2023 SC 379, Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the
burden of proof lies on the person who asserts existence of a fact in affirmative and
not on the party who denies it. Relevant para is reproduced as:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163036012/ 5
56:40 +05'30' vs Md. Najakat Ali on 4 May, 2023
"31. The burden of proof to establish a title in the present case lies upon the Plaintiff
as this burden lies on the party who asserts the existence of a particular state of
things on the basis of which she claims relief. This is mandated in terms of Section
101 of the Evidence Act, which states that burden on proving the fact rests with party
who substantially asserts in the affirmative and not on the party which is denying it.
This Rule may not be universal and has exceptions, but in the factual background of
the present case, the general principle is applicable. In terms of Section 102 of the
Evidence Act, if both parties fail to adduce evidence, the suit must fail. Onus of proof,
no doubt shifts and the shifting is a continuous process CRP(C.R.P.Art.227) No.17 of
2023 Page 9 in the evaluation of evidence, but this happens when in a suit for title
and possession, the Plaintiff has been able to create a high degree of probability to
shift the onus on the Defendant. In the absence of such evidence, the burden of proof
lies on the Plaintiff and can be discharged only when he is able to prove title. The
weakness of the defence cannot be a justification to decree the suit. The Plaintiff
could have succeeded in respect of the Schedule 'A' property if she had discharged the
burden to prove the title to the Schedule 'A' property which squarely falls on her. This
would be the true effect of Sections 101 and 102 of the Evidence Act. Therefore, it
follows that the Plaintiff should have satisfied and discharged the burden under the
provisions of the Evidence Act, failing which the suit would be liable to be dismissed.
Thus, the impugned judgment by the High Court had rightly allowed the appeal and
set aside the judgment and decree of the trial court. We, therefore, uphold the
findings of the High Court that the suit should be dismissed. We clarify that we have
not interfered or set aside any observations of the High Court in re the Tripura Land
Revenue and Land Reforms Act, or Defendants' claim etc. Notably, M/s. Hotel Khosh
Mahal Limited is not a party to the present proceedings."
CRP(C.R.P.Art.227) No.17 of 2023 Page 10
[11] In the present case, the petitioner/defendant No.1 asserts that the
mutation order dated 06.04.2013 in Mutation Case No.314/SDC/HNG/2013 was
passed by the Ld. SDC, Heingang in presence of respondent No.2/defendant No.3
and with his knowledge and consent. On the other hand, respondent No.2/defendant
No.3 denies such an assertion. [12] Therefore, as per the illustration (b) appended to
Section 101 of Indian Evidence Act, the burden is primarily on the
petitioner/defendant No.1 to prove that the mutation order was passed with
knowledge and consent and in presence of respondent No.2/defendant No.3.This fact
can be proved by calling for the record of the Mutation Case No.314/SDC/HNG/2013
from the Court of Ld. SDC, Heingang. Inability of respondent No.2/defendant No.3
to prove his absence will not ipso facto confirms his presence. Petitioner/defendant
No.1 has an obligation to prove his positive assertion as per the recent case of Smriti
Debbarma (supra).
[12.1] Therefore, the Ld. Civil Judge (Senior Division), Imphal East was wrong in
presuming that the burden of proof lies only on respondent No.2/defendant No.3 to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163036012/ 6
56:40 +05'30' vs Md. Najakat Ali on 4 May, 2023
deny this fact. This Court is of the opinion that the burden of proof primarily lies on
the petitioner/defendant No.1 who alleged the existence of the fact, i.e., presence of
respondent No.2/defendant No.3 during CRP(C.R.P.Art.227) No.17 of 2023 Page 11
the mutation proceeding which was conducted with his knowledge and consent.
[12.2] This Court is of the opinion that mere filing of certified copy of the order dated
06.04.2013 in Mutation Case No.314 of 2013 does not discharge the burden to prove
the existence by the petitioner/defendant No.1 to the effect that respondent
No.2/defendant No.3 was present during the mutation proceeding. This rival fact of
presence or absence of respondent No.2/defendant No.3 can be established only
from the proceeding of the Mutation Case No.314 of 2013.
[12.3] Accordingly, the impugned order dated 27.02.2023 is set aside and the present
petition is allowed.
[12.4] The Ld. SDC, Heingang is directed to send records of the mutation proceedings
in Mutation Case No.314/SDC/HNG/2013 along with the order dated 06.04.2013 to
the Court of Ld. Civil Judge (Senior Division), Imphal East in connection with OS
No.8 of 2014/55 of 2014 within 2(two) weeks from the date of receipt of copy of this
order.
[12.5] The Revision Petition and pending application being MC(CRP Art.227) No. 24
of 2023 are disposed of in terms of the above observation and directions. No costs. It
is clarified that this Court does not express any opinion on the merit of the case and
nothing said herein shall prejudice the case of the parties during the trial.
CRP(C.R.P.Art.227) No.17 of 2023 Page 12
[12.6] Send copy of this order to the Ld. Civil Judge (Senior Division),
Imphal East and to the Ld. SDC, Heingang for information and necessary action.
