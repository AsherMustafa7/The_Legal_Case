Home Department, Government of Manipur, the petitioner was detained under Section 3(1) of the
Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (PIT-ND & PS Act),
1988 for effectively preventing him from further involvement in illicit trafficking of narcotic drugs
and psychotropic substances for a period of three months until further orders and he would
continue his illegal activities including illicit trafficking of drugs even after his release on bail.
Vide letter dated 04.11.2022, The Special Secretary (Home), Government of Manipur, furnished the
grounds of detention to the petitioner where it is stated that 17.10 grams heroin excluding the weight
of container and Rs. 64,000/- was recovered from the the possession of the petitioner and his wife
and both of them were arrested and it was found out that both the petitioner and his wife were
running drug vendor and selling illegal drugs to drug abusers at their residence. It is also stated that
they are habitually dealing and selling of drugs to the customers. Since, the petitioner is likely to be
released on bail and he would continue in the illegal activities of drug trafficking and he was
detained under Section 3 of the PIT
- ND & PS Act.
[2] The petitioner submitted 3 (three) similar representations all dated 17.11.2022 to the Chief
Secretary, Government of Manipur, to the WP(Cril.) No. 36 of 2022 Page 2 Deputy Secretary,
(PIT-ND & PS), Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue, Government of India and to the State
Advisory Board, ND & PS, Government of Manipur, through the Superintendant, Central Jail,
Sajiwa, for revocation of the impugned detention order dated 31.11.2022 issued by the Special
Secretary (Home), Government of Manipur on the ground that the grounds of detention are all
concocted and fabricated stories and there is no single evidence against him and he was formally
arrested on 19.11.2022 by Thoubal Police Station and he has been to judicial custody for more than
120 days. He was released from judicial custody on bail and while he was on bail, the detention
order dated 31.10.2022 was issued against him and the Central Government did not consider the
revocation of the detention order based on report submitted by the State Government.
[4] During the pendency of the 1st 3 (three) representations all dated 17.11.2022, the petitioner also
submitted another representations all dated 21.11.2022 to the Chief Secretary, Government of
Manipur, to the Deputy Secretary, (PIT-ND & PS), Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue,
Government of India and to the State Advisory Board, ND & PS, Manipur through the
Superintendent, Manipur Central Jail, Sajiwa, where it is stated that the 1st representation dated
17.11.2022, due to bonafide mistake, the FIR No. was wrongly mentioned and hence, the 2nd
representation was submitted with the correct FIR No. In the 1st representation, FIR No. was
wrongly mentioned as 115(7) TBL-PS U/S 21(b)/27(a)/29/60(3) ND & PS Act. In order to correct
this mistake, the petitioner submitted the 2nd representation with the correct FIR No. as

disposed of by the State as well as the Central Authorities and as such, the detention order is liable
to be set aside. The detention order is challenged on the following grounds:
WP(Cril.) No. 36 of 2022 Page 3

(l) For that the Central Government did not consider the revocation of detention order based on
report submitted by the State Government under Section 3(2) of Prevention of Illicit Traffic in
Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (PIT-ND & PS) Act, 1988 independently and as
such the detention order is liable to be set aside.
[5] In the reply filed by the State respondents, it is stated that the petitioner and his wife started to
sell drugs to drug users in small quantities thereby earning profits for his personal gain from the
drug users. It is also WP(Cril.) No. 36 of 2022 Page 5 stated that the petitioner is a notoriously
clever, habitual offender and hardened criminal and has been involved in trafficking of illegal drugs
and selling of Heroin No. 4 in huge quantity at his residence and there has been apprehension that
he would continue the drugs business when he was out of bail and there was possibility of him of
being released on bail. In order to prevent him from further indulging in illegal activities of drug
trafficking, he was detained under the PIT-ND & PS Act. It is also submitted that the detention order
dated 30.11.2022 was served to the detenu on 04.11.2022 within the timeline line as stipulated
under Sub-Section 3 of Section 3 of PIT-ND & PS Act. Further, the detention order of the detenue
was furnished to the Central Government vide letter dated 16.09.2022 within the stipulated time. It
is also stated that the representation of the petitioner was forwarded to the Deputy Secretary
(PIT-ND & PS), Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue, Government of India, New Delhi
within time. It is also stated that the State Government duly considered the representation of the
detenue and rejected the same vide letter dated 07.12.2022 after calling comments from the Police
department. It is also stated that the delay in disposing the representation and forwarding copy to
the Government of India was due to the high volume of proposals received and routine works of the
department. It is prayed that the writ petition may be disposed of as the Union of India did not file
any reply to the writ petition.
[6] Heard Mr. Ch. Ngongo, learned counsel for the petitioner, Mr. Th. Vashum, learned G.A. for the
State respondents and Mr. BR. Sharma, learned CGC for the Union of India.
[7] Mr. Ch. Ngongo, learned counsel for the petitioner, draws the attention of this Court that the 2nd
representation has not been disposed of till date and no explanation has been given for the delay in
the present case. He has also stated that the detention order was issued in the name of the Governor
but the confirmation/rejection order was issued by the WP(Cril.) No. 36 of 2022 Page 6 Subordinate
Officer, i.e., The Deputy Secretary (Home), Government of Manipur, which is subordinate and has
no authority. The rejection order dated 07.12.2022 was issued by the Deputy Secretary (Home),
Government of Manipur, and the same was not in the name of the Governor and confirmation was
also vitiated. The 2nd representations are still pending waiting for disposal by the State and Central
Authorities. It is also stated that there was 20 days delay in disposal of the 1 st representation dated
17.11.2022 by the State Government and the delay has not been explained except being busy in high
volume official works.
Mr. Ch. Ngongo, learned counsel for the petitioner has relied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Rajammal
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/59421429/ 4
Thoubalmayum Rafique @ Rafique Ahamed vs Special Secretary (Home) on 21 February, 2023
-vs- State of Tamil Nadu reported in (1999) 1 SCC 417 where it was held that the obligation of the
State Government to consider the representation forwarded by the detenue without any unexplained
delay and any delay in the disposal of representation would be a breached of the constitutional
safeguards and it would render the continued detention impermissible and illegal. He prays that the
detention order be set aside as the 2nd representation has not been disposed of till date and 20 days
delay in disposal of the 1st representation has not been duly considered.
[8] Mr. Th. Vashum, learned G.A., submits that there is no undue delay on the part of the State
Authorities. The ground for detention was intimated within the stipulated time and the detention
order was forwarded to the Central Government. The representation submitted by the detenue was
also forwarded to the Central Government on time and the delay in disposal of the 1st
representation was due to the overburden in the department and was explained. The learned G.A.
relies upon the Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Senthamil Selvi -vs- State of
Tamil Nadu reported in (2006) 5 SCC 676 where it was held that the delay of 12 days was duly
explained and condoned and the detention order was WP(Cril.) No. 36 of 2022 Page 7 upheld. He
submits that the petitioner, being habitually indulged in selling of drugs from his residence to drug
users, was detained as Normal Criminal Court cannot deal with his case.
[9] On perusal of the original case record, it is seen that the State Authorities as well as the Advisory
Board consider only the 1 st representation dated 17.11.2022 and there is no whisper of the 2 nd
representation dated 21.11.2022.
[10] Vide Order dated 13.01.2022, the Commissioner (Home), Government of Manipur, rejected the
representation of the detenue after considering the opinion of the Advisory Board confirming the
detention order and fixed the period of detention as 12 months as provided under Section 11 of the
PIT-ND & PS Act.
[11] Mr. BR. Sharma, learned CGC for the Union of India, has adopted the counter affidavit of the
State Government. However, he submits that no instruction has been received with respect to the
allegation made against the Central Government in the writ petition.
[12] From the perusal of the case record, it is seen that the 2 nd representation dated 21.11.2022 has
not been considered by the Advisory Board nor by the State Government and rejection order is with
respect to the 1st representation dated 17.11.2022. Both the State Government and the Central
Government have not dealt with the 2nd representation dated 21.11.2022. Besides, the Central
Government has also not passed any order on the 1st representation dated 17.11.2022. Non-disposal
of the representation in the case of preventive detention of a person, who has been detained without
any trial, is impermissible and illegal as per the various judgments of the Hon'ble Apex Court. It will
be appropriate to reproduce para Nos. 7, 8 & 9 of the judgment passed by the Honb'e Supreme Court
in the case of Rajammal v. State of T.N. reported in WP(Cril.) No. 36 of 2022 Page 8 (1999) 1 SCC
417: 1999 SCC (Cri) 93, at page 421 , which reads as under:
"7. It is a constitutional obligation of the Government to consider the representation
forwarded by the detenu without any delay. Though no period is prescribed by Article
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/59421429/ 5
Thoubalmayum Rafique @ Rafique Ahamed vs Special Secretary (Home) on 21 February, 2023
22 of the Constitution for the decision to be taken on the representation, the words
"as soon as may be" in clause (5) of Article 22 convey the message that the
representation should be considered and disposed of at the earliest. But that does not
mean that the authority is pre- empted from explaining any delay which would have
occasioned in the disposal of the representation. The court can certainly consider
whether the delay was occasioned due to permissible reasons or unavoidable causes.
This position has been well delineated by a Constitution Bench of this Court in K.M.
Abdulla Kunhi v. Union of India5. The following observations of the Bench can
profitably be extracted here: (SCC p. 484, para 12) "It is a constitutional mandate
commanding the authority concerned to whom the detenu submits his representation
to consider the representation and dispose of the same as expeditiously as possible.
The words 'as soon as may be' occurring in clause (5) of Article 22 reflects the
concern of the Framers that the representation should be expeditiously considered
and disposed of with a sense of urgency without an avoidable delay. However, there
can be no hard and fast rule in this regard. It depends upon the facts and
circumstances of each case. There is no period prescribed either under the
Constitution or under the detention law concerned, within which the representation
should be dealt with. The requirement, however, is that there should not be supine
indifference, slackness or callous attitude in considering the representation. Any
unexplained delay in the disposal of representation would be a breach of the
constitutional imperative and it would render the continued detention impermissible
and illegal."
8. The position, therefore, now is that if delay was caused on account of any indifference or lapse in
considering the representation, such delay will adversely affect further detention of the prisoner. In
other words, it is for the authority concerned to explain the delay, if any, in disposing of the
representation. It is not enough to say that the delay was very short. Even longer delay can as well be
explained. So the test is not the duration or range of delay, but how it is explained by the authority
concerned.
WP(Cril.) No. 36 of 2022 Page 9
9. What happened in this case was that the Government which received remarks from different
authorities submitted the relevant files before the Under-Secretary for processing it on the next day.
The Under-Secretary forwarded it to the Deputy Secretary on the next working day. Thus there is
some explanation for the delay till 9-2- 1998. Thereafter the file was submitted before the Minister
who received it while he was on tour. The Minister passed the order only on 14-2-1998. Though
there is explanation for the delay till 9-2-1998, we are unable to find out any explanation whatsoever
as for the delay which occurred thereafter. Merely stating that the Minister was on tour and hence
he could pass orders only on 14-2-1998 is not a justifiable explanation when the liberty of a citizen
guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution is involved. Absence of the Minister at the
Headquarters is not sufficient to justify the delay, since the file could be reached the Minister with
utmost promptitude in cases involving the vitally important fundamental right of a citizen."

Thoubalmayum Rafique @ Rafique Ahamed vs Special Secretary (Home) on 21 February, 2023
It may be relevant to point out another judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
Sarabjeet Singh Mokha v. The District Magistrate, Jabalpur reported as MANU/SC/1011/2021, it
was held that unexplained delay on the part of the State Government in deciding the representation
of the detenu and failure of the Central and State Government to inform rejection of the
representation in timely manner rendered the detention order as invalid.
[13] So, we are of the view that non-decision on the 2nd representation by the State Government as
well as the 1 st and 2nd representation by the Central Government has impeached the right of
personal liberty of the detenu and also there was unexplained delay on the part of the State
Authorities in disposal of the 1st representation. Accordingly, the detention order dated 31.10.2022
passed by the Special Secretary (Home), Government of Manipur, as well as confirmation order
dated 13.01.2022 passed by the Commissioner (Home), Government of Manipur are set aside and
the detenu is to be released from detention if not required in any other case.
WP(Cril.) No. 36 of 2022 Page 10 Writ petition is allowed in terms of the above order. No cost.
