Shri Satyam Rai informs that arguing counsel is unwell. It is seen from the record that this case is
being adjourned for hearing on admission since the last one year and three months with no progress
in the matter.
Despite the case being partly heard on 11.01.2023, one of the arguing counsel, Shri Bhoopesh Tiwari
had submitted that he is not feeling well, therefore, matter got adjourned to be listed today.
Again, prayer for adjournment is made by the petitioner. List the case in week commencing
13.03.2023 with the understanding that no further adjournment shall be granted on the next date of
hearing and matter shall be decided either on merits or shall be dismissed in default if counsel for
petitioner do not appear and argue the matter.
List the case in week commencing 13.03.2023.
