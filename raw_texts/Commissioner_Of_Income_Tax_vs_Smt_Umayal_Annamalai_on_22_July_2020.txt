2. Heard Mr.J.Narayanaswamy, learned Senior Standing counsel appearing for the appellant
Department and Mr.N.Quadir Hoseyn, learned counsel appearing for the respondent.
3. The Revenue has filed the present appeal under Section 260-A of the Income Tax Act, purportedly
raising the following substantial questions of law for consideration.
“ 1. Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the tribunal was right and justified in
granting exemption u/s 54F when the unutilised portion of the sale proceeds were not deposited in
the capital gains account scheme before the due date for filing of return u/s 139(1)?
2. Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the tribunal was right in interpreting
the provisions of section 54F to conclude that the assessee is entitled for exemption ignoring the
ration of the decisions reported in 197 taxman 52?'
4. The learned Tribunal, with regard to exemption under Section 54 F(1) of the Act, with respect to
capital gains earned by the assessee during the previous year, has given the following finding of facts
in paragraph 8 and the relevant portion of paragraph 8 is quoted hereunder;
' The assessee has complied the provisions considering the dates http://www.judis.nic.in Order
dt.22.7.2020 in TCA No.456 of 2017 as under:-
(i) Date of transfer of original asset : 14.2.2005 (Ii) The date of filing of return :
17.3.2006
(iii) Due date of return for the Assessment year 2005-06 : 31.07.2005
(iv) Due date of filing belated return : 31.03.2007
(v) Possession of the property : 15.12.2007 "On considering the provisions of law and
facts of the case, the assessee has invested Rs.68,00,000/-before due date of filing
belated return i.e. 31.03.2007 and took the possession as per the findings of the
Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) on 15.12.2007, being within three years from
the date of transfer/sale of original asset being 14.02.2005. The assessee has not
invested in Capital Gain Account Scheme before 139(1) of the Act but complied with
the conditions u/s.54F(1) of the Act by purchasing and construction of residential
property within three years from the date of transfer of original asset which is not
disputed in the assessment proceedings or in appellate proceedings. The provisions
of Sec. 54F are beneficial provisions and are to be considered liberally in the aspect of
limitation period. But the investment in residential property is must which the
assessee has proved with evidence and complied before the lower authorities.
The learned Commissioner of Income tax (Appeals) relied on the legal provision and submissions of
the assessee exhaustively with judicial decisions. Considering the factual aspects, genuineness of the
transactions and beneficial aspects of the provisions, we are of http://www.judis.nic.in Order

Commissioner Of Income Tax vs Smt. Umayal Annamalai on 22 July, 2020
dt.22.7.2020 in TCA No.456 of 2017 the opinion that the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals)
has rightly construed the findings and the explanation of the assessee with observation in his order
and allowed the deduction u/s.54F of the Act. Therefore, we are not inclined to interfere with the
order of Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) and dismiss the ground of the Revenue.'
5. Though the Revenue stake involved in the present case is much below the limit of rupees one
crore for withdrawal of the appeal by the Revenue, since the present case involved some audit
objection because of exemption in the said Circular, the learned counsel for the Revenue press the
appeal on merits.
6. However, after hearing both the learned counsel, we are satisfied that the finding of the facts
arrived at by the learned Tribunal are perfectly in order and justified and correct on the basis of facts
stated in the quoted paragraph 8 of the order. The assessee has clearly satisfied the conditions for
availing the benefit of exemption under section 54F of the Act, as it has purchased new property and
has taken the possession within the stipulated period of three years, as aforesaid. Thus, we do not
find any perversity in the said findings of facts given by the learned Tribunal.

7. Therefore, in our opinion, no substantial question of law arises in the present appeal filed by the
Revenue and it is without any merits.
Accordingly, the appeal filed by the Revenue is dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs.
