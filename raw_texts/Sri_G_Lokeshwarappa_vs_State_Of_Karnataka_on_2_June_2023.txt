THIS WRIT PETITION IS FILED UNDER ARTICLE 226 OF THE
CONSTITUTION OF INDIA PRAYING TO CALL FOR THE RECORDS;
QUASH THE ALLOTMENT MEMORANDUM LETTERS DATED
03.03.2015 ISSUED BY R-2 AND 3 VIDE ANNEXURE-K SERIES AND
ETC.,
THESE WRIT PETITIONS HAVING BEEN HEARD AND
RESERVED FOR ORDERS, COMING ON FOR PRONOUNCEMENT THIS
DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:-
ORDER
The issue in the lis arises out of a solitary chunk of facts concerning a particular property. The
petitioner in W.P.No.8023 of 2020 seeks quashing of endorsement dated 07-03-2020, issued by the
2nd respondent/Karnataka Housing Board (hereinafter referred to as 'the Board' for short) by
which, the Board seeks probate of the Will for release of sites in favour of the petitioner in terms of
the judgment and decree dated 20-06-2019 passed in the suit -
O.S.No.182 of 2014.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/152314168/ 7
Sri. G. Lokeshwarappa vs State Of Karnataka on 2 June, 2023
2. In Writ Petition No.3123 of 2017, the petitioners are all claiming to be allottees of sites in their
favour and have called in question allotment memorandum dated 03-03-2015, issued by the Board
revising the price of sites from `290/- per square feet to `791/- per square feet unilaterally.
3. Writ Petition No.17555 of 2016 is filed by the very petitioner in W.P.No.8023 of 2020 calling in
question resolution of the Board dated 05-01-2015 and an order dated 19-03-2016 whereby, the
Board refuses to accede to the request of the petitioner for increase in the value of per square feet of
the sites.
4. Therefore, the crux of the issue in all these cases is the property/land belonging to one
A.M.Parameshwarappa, the uncle of the petitioners in W.P.Nos.8023 of 2020 & 17555 of 2016 and
others claiming to be allottees of the very same property and, therefore, all the petitions are taken up
together and considered by this common order.
5. For the sake of convenience, the facts obtaining in W.P.No.8023 of 2020 would be narrated, as it
covers the entire spectrum of all others cases.
6. Heard Sri Vighneshwar S.Shastri, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner in
W.P.No.8023 of 2020, Sri M.B.Chandrachooda, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner in
W.P.No.17555 of 2016, Sri M.Rudraiah, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners in
W.P.No.3123 of 2017, Sri M. Vinod Kumar, learned Additional Government Advocate appearing for
respondent No.1, Sri Raghavendra A.Kulkarni, learned counsel appearing for respondent No.2 in
W.P.No.8023 of 2020 and respondent Nos.2 and 3 in W.P.Nos.3123 of 2017 and 17555 of 2016, Sri
G.C.Shanmukha, learned counsel appearing for respondent Nos.3 and 4 in W.P.No.8023 of 2020
and Sri S.Ganesh Shenoy, learned counsel appearing for respondent Nos.4 (b) & (c) in
W.P.No.3123/2017.
7. The main protagonist in these three cases is one A.M. Parameshwarappa. Sri A.M.
Parameshwarappa purchases a land in Sy.No.44/1A2 measuring 4 acres of Navile Village,
Shivamogga Taluk and District on 22-06-1998, gets the land converted from agriculture to
residential purpose and forms a layout of 56 sites. On 05-06-2002, he would approach the Board
with a request for joint development for the purpose of marketing the sites formed in the layout
under the aegis of the Karnataka Housing Board and with their title. The Board enters into an
agreement with the uncle of the petitioner that, the Board would be entitled to 5% of the
commission on the sale consideration received while marketing the sites in favour of the general
public. In furtherance of the aforesaid transaction between the uncle of the petitioner and the Board,
the Board issues a notification/publication to survey the demand for allotment of sites, notifying the
fact that the property belongs to the uncle of the petitioner and calls for applications from the
interested public for sites. The last date fixed was 31-01-2005. There was very poor public response,
as not even a single application, was received showing any interest from the public seeking
allotment of sites.
8. By then, the Board had come up with a policy of undertaking Joint Venture Projects. Sri A.M.
Parameshwarappa then enters into a Joint Venture Agreement with the Board in respect of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/152314168/ 8
Sri. G. Lokeshwarappa vs State Of Karnataka on 2 June, 2023
property in question. On 25-06-2007, pursuant to the agreement entered into, Sri A.M.
Parameshwarappa executed a registered conveyance deed in favour of the Board in respect of the
property in question by paying only the stamp duty that was necessary for execution of the said
document. It appears that on 05-02-2007 the Board without issuing any notification afresh, called
for applications from public and without the knowledge of Sri A.M. Parameshwarappa received
certain applications from several interested persons who sought allotment of sites. The Board fixed
the price at `290/- per sq.ft. and received applications for allotment. Sri A.M. Parameshwarappa did
not agree for the price that was fixed at `290/- per sq.ft.
9. It is the averment in the petition that Sri A.M. Parameshwarappa had raised a loan of `25/- lakhs
from the then Vijaya Bank for the purpose of formation of layout and the Bank had initiated
proceedings under the SARFAESI Act, 2002. It is then Sri A.M. Parameshwarappa requests the
Board to sell the sites and accordingly Sri A.M. Parameshwarappa alienated 25 sites out of 56 sites
for the purpose of discharge of loan. When the Board did not take the uncle of the petitioner into
confidence while inviting applications at a particular price, the uncle of the petitioner/Sri A.M.
Parameshwarappa initiated civil proceedings in O.S.No.182 of 2014 seeking a decree of declaration
and permanent injunction directing the 2nd respondent/Board to re-convey the subject property in
favour of Sri A.M. Parameshwarappa by executing a re-conveyance deed. The suit was decreed with
a direction to the Board to re-
convey 22 sites as per the schedule mentioned in the plaint, on 20-06-2019. The decree against the
Board becomes final.
10. Sri A.M. Parameshwarappa dies on 15.09.2019, leaving behind a Will dated 27-07-2011 in favour
of the petitioner in W.P.No.8023 of 2020 bequeathing the entire subject property in his favour. The
issue in the lis relates to those 22 sites that the petitioner had to come in possession pursuant to the
Will so executed by his uncle. It was registered Will dated 27-07-2011.
The Board then resolves not to file an appeal against the judgment and decree dated 20-06-2019 in
terms of its resolution dated 19-09-2019. Therefore, the property that had been bequeathed in
favour of the petitioner in terms of the Will had to be re-conveyed in his favour as by then, the
petitioner had become the owner of the property in terms of the Will. The petitioner then represents
to the Board seeking re-conveyance of the property - 22 sites. It is averred that the petitioner was
directed to produce a succession certificate and get the Will probated before a civil Court. The
petitioner then submits another representation contending that there is no necessity to get a
succession certificate or get the Will probated. The Board in terms of the impugned endorsement
rejects the claim of the petitioner and directs him to get a succession certificate from the competent
Court by getting the Will dated 27-07-2011 probated. It is this action that drives the petitioner in
Writ Petition No.8023 of 2020 to this Court. Writ Petition No.17555 of 2016 is also filed by the
petitioner in W.P.No.8023 of 2020. The prayer sought in the said petition would depend upon the
resolution of the petition in Writ Petition No.8023 of 2020. Therefore, the facts therein are not
narrated.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/152314168/ 9
Sri. G. Lokeshwarappa vs State Of Karnataka on 2 June, 2023
11. Insofar as the petitioners in Writ Petition No.3123 of 2017 are concerned, they are the petitioners
who had submitted their applications seeking allotment of sites when the Board had notified them
with a particular price i.e., `290/- per sq.ft. During the pendency of such consideration of
applications before the Board, the Board enhanced the price to `790/- per sq.ft. It is challenging the
rise in price, the petitioners are before this Court as it was a rise in price by the Board. The
petitioners therein claim that on 12-10-2007, the 3rd respondent/Secretary of the Board had issued
offer letters to the petitioners offering the sites formed at the property at `290/- per sq.ft. The
petitioners then had consented to the price accepting the offer through their applications. It is the
claim of the petitioners therein that they have deposited sums over and above the initial deposit
between 23-11-2008 and 27-01-2009 more than the sital value.
12. It is, since then, the petitioners therein have been agitating their rights for execution of sale
deeds in their favour in terms of the allotment. They have approached the District Consumer Forum
which had allowed the complaint of the petitioners and directed the respondents to allot the sites to
the petitioners but permitted the respondents/Board to re-fix the rate of sites. It appears that the
Board had preferred an appeal against the order of the District Consumer Forum, which came to be
dismissed against which, revision petitions were filed by the Board before the National Consumer
Disputes Redressal Commission, which also come to be dismissed. Thereafter the petitioners file
execution proceedings before the District Consumer Forum. It is then, the respondent/Board has
allotted sites to the petitioners by drawing up of lots on 03-02-2015. While executing allotment
memoranda, the Board re-fixes the price of sites at `791/- per sq.ft. In the execution proceedings,
the District Consumer Forum allows execution petition in-part by re-fixing the sital value at `400/-
per sq.ft.
13. This is called in question before the State Consumer Forum by the Board and the State
Consumer Forum on 07-01-2016 allows the appeal filed by respondents 2 and 3 herein, set aside the
order of the District Consumer Forum with liberty to the petitioners to get the sale deeds executed at
the rates fixed by the respondents i.e., `791/- per sq.ft. Against this order, again the petitioners
approach the National Commission, which also dismissed the appeal on 03-10-2016, reserving
liberty to the petitioners to avail of such remedy as is available in law. It is then, the petitioners
preferred the subject petition in Writ Petition No.3123 of 2017 filing it on 23-01-2017. Therefore, the
petitioners in the said petition are allottees from the hands of the Board and are armed with certain
orders passed by the District Consumer Forum, State Consumer Forum and National Consumer
Forum but have not been allotted any site as there is dispute with regard to the price that is fixed by
the Board. The uncle of the petitioner in Writ Petition No.8023 of 2020 had not agreed for price
fixation even at `791/- per sq.ft. and the petitioners allege in Writ Petition No.3123 of 2017 that they
also have a grievance with regard to the increase in price of sites.
14. The learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner in W.P.No.8023 of 2020 would contend
with vehemence that the petitioner is entitled for re-conveyance of sites in the light of the judgment
and decree of the civil Court in O.S.No.182 of 2014 dated 20-06-2019. The Board is the defendant in
the said case.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/152314168/ 10
Sri. G. Lokeshwarappa vs State Of Karnataka on 2 June, 2023
The Board suffers a decree and then refuses to re-convey sites on the ground that the Will executed
in favour of the petitioner needs to be probated before a competent Court of law and a succession
certificate to be produced to that effect. The learned senior counsel would contend that the
petitioner is a Hindu and the Will is executed by a Hindu. Therefore, there is no question of seeking
probate of the Will of a Hindu property.
15. He would submit that the Board having suffered the decree cannot take shelter under the illegal
umbrella of seeking probate of the Will. Insofar as other objections with regard to the allottees are
concerned, the learned senior counsel would contend that they are at best the allottees and the
Board has to refund the amount to the allotteees as no right to the allottees ever flew from the
actions of the Board. Merely because the consumer fora have passed orders in their favour would
not mean that sale deeds have to be executed de hors the law. It is for the petitioner in W.P.No.2023
of 2020, if he comes in possession of the property to decide as to what is to be done with 22 sites.
16. On other hand, the learned counsel appearing for the Board would refute the submissions to
contend that the transaction between the Board and the uncle of the petitioner was for sale of sites.
Therefore, the Board has notified and allotted the sites. The petitioner has to allot the sites in favour
of the allottees who are petitioners in W.P.No.3123 of 2017. He would submit that dispute with
regard to the price remained un-resolved during the lifetime of Sri A.M.Parameshwarappa, uncle of
the petitioner. But, the allottees by then, had made deposits in terms of the agreement made. He
would submit that if the petitioner wants the sites to be reconveyed in terms of judgment and decree
in the aforesaid O.S. No.182 of 2014, he has to get the Will probated as there are serious disputes
with regard to the property.
17. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner in Writ Petition No.17555 of 2016 would
contend that whatever happens in Writ Petition No.8023 of 2020 would become binding on the
prayer in the subject petition as well, as the prayer sought would demonstrate that the uncle of the
petitioner in W.P.No.8023 of 2020 never agreed to the price that was quoted and notified by the
Board.
18. I have given my anxious consideration to the submissions made by the respective learned
counsel and have perused the material on record.
19. The afore-narrated intricate facts are not in dispute as they are a matter of record. The uncle of
the petitioner in W.P.8023 of 2020 being the owner of the property is not in dispute. All other
agreements that are entered into between the Board and the uncle of the petitioner are all a matter
of record.
Sri A.M.Parameshwarappa, uncle of the petitioner did not convey the property in favour of the
Board. It was only for the purpose of sale of sites. The first attempt with an agreement of 5%
commission did not yield a single result as no applicant came forward showing any interest in the
sites. Later, the uncle of the petitioner enters into a Joint Development Agreement with the Board.
Disputes galore between the Board and the uncle of the petitioner which led the uncle of the
petitioner to file a civil suit in O.S.No.182 of 2014 seeking a relief of declaration and injunction

against the Board and a direction was also sought for re-
conveyance of the property in favour of the uncle of the petitioner.

(Emphasis added) The site numbers are also mentioned in the decree as they were
part of the schedule. The total sites are 22 in number and the land measured was
close to 4 acres. The aforesaid decree dated 20-06-2019 has become final. During the
pendency of aforesaid proceedings, several disputes with regard to fixation of price of
sites between the Board and Sri A.M.Parameshwarappa led the uncle of the petitioner
to file Writ Petition No.17555 of 2016 disputing the price fixed at `290/- per sq.ft. or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/152314168/ 13
Sri. G. Lokeshwarappa vs State Of Karnataka on 2 June, 2023
even `791/- per sq.ft. by the Board for allotment of sites. Therefore, there was no
concrete decision on a consensus for price fixation qua allotment.
In the meantime, the Board had created certain rights in favour of allottees by
receiving certain amounts. These rights have not been crystallized into indefeasible
right as no sale deed was executed by the Board as it was only at the stage of
allotment and receipt of money. In the teeth of all these proceedings, the uncle of the
petitioner dies and during his life time, he had executed a Will on 27-07-2011
bequeathing entire subject property to the petitioner in W.P.No.8023 of 2020.
20. The issue now is, whether the Board can wriggle out of the decree quoted supra
which is in favour of the uncle of the petitioner directing re-conveyance of 22 sites
and whether it is correct in insisting the Will to be probated as a condition precedent
for implementation of judgment and decree dated 20-06-2019 in O.S.No.182 of 2014.
21. Sections 213 and 57 of the Indian Succession Act require to be noticed, and they
read as follows:
"57. Application of certain provisions of Part to a class of wills made by Hindus,
etc.--The provisions of this Part which are set out in Schedule III shall, subject to the
restrictions and modifications specified therein, apply--
(a) to all wills and codicils made by any Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh or Jaina, on or after
the first day of September, 1870, within the territories which at the said date were
subject to the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal or within the local limits of the ordinary
original civil jurisdiction of the High Courts of Judicature at Madras and Bombay;
and
(b) to all such wills and codicils made outside those territories and limits so far as
relates to immovable property situate within those territories or limits; and
(c) to all wills and codicils made by any Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh or Jaina on or after the
first day of January, 1927, to which those provisions are not applied by clauses (a)
and (b).
Provided that marriage shall not revoke any such will or codicil.
... ... ...
213. Right as executor or legatee when
established.--(1) No right as executor or legatee can be established in any Court of Justice, unless a
Court of competent jurisdiction in India has granted probate of the will under which the right is
claimed, or has granted letters of administration with the will or with a copy of an authenticated
copy of the will annexed.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/152314168/ 14
Sri. G. Lokeshwarappa vs State Of Karnataka on 2 June, 2023
(2) This section shall not apply in the case of wills made by Muhammadans or Indian Christians,
and shall only apply--
(i) in the case of wills made by any Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh or Jaina where such wills are of classes
specified in clauses
(a) and (b) of Section 57, and
(ii) in the case of wills made by any Parsi dying, after the commencement of the Indian Succession
(Amend-ment) Act, 1962, where such wills are made within the local limits of the ordinary original
civil jurisdiction of the High Courts at Calcutta, Madras and Bombay, and where such wills are made
outside those limits, in so far as they relate to immovable property situate within those limits."
(Emphasis supplied) Consideration and a decision on this issue need not detain this Court for long
or delve deep into the matter. A single Judge of this Court has considered these provisions and has
held that a property which belongs to a Hindu, probate of the Will need not be the condition
precedent to execute the contents of the Will. The learned single Judge of this Court in SRINIVASA
v. SRINIVASA RAO1 has held as follows:
"2. One Smt. Akkayyamma, who was admittedly the owner of the residential premises
No. 1686, III Cross, Ramachandrapuram, Nagappa Block, Sreeramapuram,
Bangalore-21. The petitioners claim that they are the legatees under the 'Will' dated
21-6-1969, executed by Smt. Akkayyamma, under which the premises in question is
bequeathed to them. A portion of the said premises is under the occupation of the
tenant (Respondent herein). The petitioners sought for the eviction of the
Respondent on the grounds under Section 21(1)(a) and (h) of the Karnataka Rent
Control Act, 1961, (hereinafter referred to as the 'Act'). The tenant (Respondent
herein) resisted the eviction Petition inter alia by filing application I.A. II, under
which, besides questioning the genuineness of the alleged 'Will', it was contended
that the Petition is not maintainable without the petitioners obtaining the probate of
the said Will in accordance with the provisions of Section 213 of the Indian
Succession Act. The Trial Court considered the said objection as a preliminary issue
and rejected the eviction Petition as not maintainable and beyond the jurisdiction of
the Court.
3. Mr. S.V. Narasimhan, Learned Counsel for the petitioners herein contends that the
provisions of Section 213 of the Indian Succession Act, are not applicable to the
instant case. Section 213, has to be read with the provisions of Section 57 of the
Indian Succession Act, under which obtaining probate of a Will is made mandatory
only in respect of the properties situated within the territories specifically mentioned
in clauses
(a) and (b) of the said Section.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/152314168/ 15
Sri. G. Lokeshwarappa vs State Of Karnataka on 2 June, 2023
4. Sections 213 and 57 of the Indian Succession Act, which are to be read together, reads as under:
Sections 213 and 57:
ILR 1985 KAR.2370 "213: Right as executor or legatee when established:--
(1) No right as executor or legatee can be established in any Court of justice, unless a
Court of competent jurisdiction in (India) has granted probate of the Will under
which the right is claimed, or has granted letters of administration with the Will or
with a copy of an authenticated copy of the Will annexed.
(2) This Section shall not apply in the case of Wills made by Mohammedans, and
shall only apply--
(i) in the case of Wills made by any Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh or Jaina where such Wills
are of the classes specified in clauses (a) and (b) of Section 57; and ******** Section
57: Application of certain provisions of part to a class of Wills made by Hindus etc.:--
The provisions of this Part which are set out in Schedule III shall, subject to the
restrictions and modifications specified therein, apply--
(a) to all Wills and Codicils made by any Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh or Jaina, or after the
first day of September, 1970 within the territories which at the said date were subject
to the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal or within the local limits of the ordinary
original civil jurisdiction of the High Courts of Judicature at Madras and Bombay;
and
(b) to all such Wills and Codicils made outside those territories and limits so far as
relates to immovable property situate within those territories or limits; and
(c) to all Wills and Codicils made by any Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh or Jaina on or after
the first day of January, 1927, to which those provisions are not applied by Clauses
(a) and
(b).
Provided that marriage shall not revoke any such Will or Codicil.
5. A reading of Clause (a) of Section 57 r/w Section 213 makes it clear that it could only apply to
cases when the property or properties bequeathed are situate in the territories mentioned in Clause
(a) of Section 57 of the Act. If the properties and the persons, who may be Hindus, are outside the
territory mentioned under Section 57(a), the provisions of Section 213 are not attracted.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/152314168/ 16
Sri. G. Lokeshwarappa vs State Of Karnataka on 2 June, 2023
6. Mr. Anandaram, Learned Counsel for the Respondent herein relies upon the decision of the
Supreme Court in Hem Nolini Judah v. Mrs. Isolyne Sarojbashini Bose*, in which it is held that
Section 213 creates a bar to establishment of any right under Will by an executor or a legatee unless
probate or letters of administration have been obtained. But it is seen that the parties in the said
case before the Supreme Court were Christians, to whom undoubtedly Section 57 does not apply. It
appears to me that Section 57 is an exception the general rule under the Indian Succession Act that
no probate is required in respect of the Will of a deceased Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh or Jaina & Muslim
etc. However all the relevant provisions under the said Act requiring obtaining of the probate apply
to the Christians.
7. In this view of the matter, the Trial Court was not correct in holding that the petitioners are not
entitled to maintain the eviction Petition for want of a probate in respect of the registered Will of
Smt. Akkayyamma. It may be mentioned that the due execution and existence of the said Will is not
seriously disputed, and it is not the case of either party that there is any rival claimant in respect of
the property in question."
(Emphasis supplied) Later, another learned single Judge of this Court in CHIKKANA v.
LOKESH AND OTHERS2 has held as follows:
ILR 2001 KAR 2681 "12. The Court below in the present case no doubt has been
correct in opining that if probate is not obtained, the document may have to be
proved in every proceeding where it is relied. But, that could not be the reason to
refuse the application of the revision petitioner for appointment of an expert
commissioner to compare the signatures on that Will, with the admitted signatures.
The provisions of obtaining the probate may not be applicable to the cases of Wills
executed by a Hindu, if the said Will does not come within the classes of the Wills
specified in Section 57(a) and (b).
Section 57 specifies the Wills to which provisions may apply are, the Wills made by any Hindus,
Buddhist, Sikh or Jaina, on or after the first day of September, 1870, within the territories which
were subject to the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal or within the local limits of the ordinary original
civil jurisdiction of the High Courts of Judicature at Madras and Bombay or in cases where Wills are
made outside those territories to the extent they relate to the properties situated within the limits of
territories of Bengal, Madras and Bombay and not others. In the case of Srinivas v. K.V. Srinivasa
Rao it has been laid down that, "A reading of Clause (a) of Section 57 read with Section 213 makes it
clear that it could only apply to cases when the property or properties bequeathed are situate in the
territories mentioned in Clause (a) of Section 57 of the Act."
It further laid it down that if properties and persons who may be Hindus are outside the territory
mentioned under Section 57(a), the provisions of Section 213 are not attracted and on that basis, the
Court held that provisions of Section 213 did not apply to the Wills like the present one.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/152314168/ 17
Sri. G. Lokeshwarappa vs State Of Karnataka on 2 June, 2023
13. In this view of the matter, there was no question of Section 213 being applied. There was no
question of probate. The Court below appears to have rejected the application for commission on
this erroneous view. Really the Court having failed to apply its mind to the relevant ingredients of
Order 26 Rule 10 of Code of Civil Procedure and by taking an erroneous view of Section 213, it has
illegally refused to exercise the jurisdiction vested in it by rejecting the application I.A. VIII moved
by the defendant/revision petitioner. The order of the Court below has got a tendency to cause
injustice and irreparable injury. Every party has got a right to prove his case. No doubt, in case of
Will, one attesting witness has to be produced. But in addition to avoid doubt for genuineness etc.,
of document, the handwriting expert's evidence is required to make scientific test and to report
about the signature of the testator in the document. If it is not allowed, definitely the revision
petitioner will suffer irreparably in course of the trial of the case and further rejection would have
resulted multiplicity of legal proceedings."
(Emphasis supplied) Apart from the aforesaid judgments, a question arose before the Apex Court as
to whether Sections 213 and 57 of the Indian Succession Act were discriminatory as Wills pertaining
to Indian Christians needed them to be probated and not the Hindus. This became subject matter
before the Apex Court in the case of CLARENCE PAIS AND OTHERS v. UNION OF INDIA3. The
Apex Court considering the very provisions holds as follows:
"5. On several representations having been made in this regard by the Christian
community in India amendment was sought to be introduced by way of a Bill to
amend Section 213 of the Act to bring Christians on a par with other communities
who are not required to (2001) 4 SCC 325 obtain probate. The grievance of the
petitioners in these cases, it is stated, is well brought out in the "Statement of Objects
and Reasons" dated 13-5-1942 (sic) in respect of the proposed amendment of Section
213 which reads as under:
"Prior to 1901, Indian Christians laboured under a serious grievance, namely, that
they were compelled to obtain probate of wills and letters of administration with
liability to pay death duties on the death of every owner of property under the Indian
Succession Act 10 of 1865, while Hindus and Muslims were exempt from the
provisions of the Act. They have since been partially relieved by being placed
practically on the same footing as their non-Christian countrymen in cases of
intestacy under the Indian Christian Estates Administration Act 7 of 1901; but where
the deceased has left a will, they are still bound to obtain probate and pay probate
duty as required by Section 213 of the Indian Succession Act 39 of 1925, a section
which does not apply to will of Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs or Jains except where such
wills are of the class specified in clauses (a) and (b) of Section 57 and to all wills of
Muhammadans.
The necessity of making wills has been imposed upon Indian Christians by the
provisions of the Indian Succession Act as to intestate succession being made
applicable to them, which are far in advance of their usages and are derived from
English law. It is felt as a serious hardship that in such circumstances Indian
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/152314168/ 18
Sri. G. Lokeshwarappa vs State Of Karnataka on 2 June, 2023
Christians should be compelled to obtain probate and should be made liable to pay
death duties while their non- Christian countrymen to whom wills are a luxury are
exempt. From this injustice they should be relieved by placing Indian Christians on
the same footing as Hindus and Muhammadans in Sections 213 and 370 of the Act."
6. The scope of Section 213(1) of the Act is that it prohibits recognition of rights as an executor or
legatee under a will without production of a probate and sets down a rule of evidence and forms
really a part of procedural requirement of the law of forum. Section 213(2) of the Act indicates that
its applicability is limited to cases of persons mentioned therein. Certain aspects will have to be
borne in mind to understand the exact scope of this section. The bar that is imposed by this section
is only in respect of the establishment of the right as an executor or legatee and not in respect of the
establishment of the right in any other capacity. The section does not prohibit the will being looked
into for purposes other than those mentioned in the section. The bar to the establishment of the
right is only for its establishment in a court of justice and not its being referred to in other
proceedings before administrative or other tribunals. The section is a bar to everyone claiming
under a will, whether as a plaintiff or defendant, if no probate or letters of administration are
granted. The effect of Section 213(2) of the Act is that the requirement of probate or other
representation mentioned in sub-section (1) for the purpose of establishing the right as an executor
or legatee in a court is made inapplicable in case of a will made by Muhammadans and in the case of
wills coming under Section 57(c) of the Act. Section 57(c) of the Act applies to all wills and codicils
made by any Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh or Jaina, on or after the first day of January, 1927 which does
not relate to immovable property situate within the territory formerly subject to the Lieutenant
Governor of Bengal or within the local limits of the ordinary civil jurisdiction of the High Courts of
Judicature at Madras and Bombay, or in respect of property within those territories. No probate is
necessary in the case of wills by Muhammadans. Now by the Indian Succession (Amendment) Act,
1962, the section has been made applicable to wills made by Parsis dying after the commencement
of the 1962 Act. A combined reading of Sections 213 and 57 of the Act would show that where the
parties to the will are Hindus or the properties in dispute are not in territories falling under Sections
57(a) and (b), sub-section (2) of Section 213 of the Act applies and sub-section (1) has no
application. As a consequence, a probate will not be required to be obtained by a Hindu in respect of
a will made outside those territories or regarding the immovable properties situate outside those
territories. The result is that the contention put forth on behalf of the petitioners that Section 213(1)
of the Act is applicable only to Christians and not to any other religion is not correct.
7. We have shown above that it is applicable to Parsis after the amendment of the Act in 1962 and to
Hindus who reside within the territories which on 1-9-1870 were subject to the Lt. Governor of
Bengal or to areas covered by original jurisdiction of the High Courts of Bombay and Madras and to
all wills made outside those territories and limits so far as they relate to immovable property situate
within those territories and limits. If that is so, it cannot be said that the section is exclusively
applicable only to Christians and, therefore, it is discriminatory. The whole foundation of the case is
thus lost. The differences are not based on any religion but for historical reasons that in the British
Empire in India, probate was required to prove the right of a legatee or an executor but not in Part
'B' or 'C' States. That position has continued even after the Constitution has come into force.
Historical reasons may justify differential treatment of separate geographical regions provided it
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/152314168/ 19
Sri. G. Lokeshwarappa vs State Of Karnataka on 2 June, 2023
bears a reasonable and just relation to the matter in respect of which differential treatment is
accorded. Uniformity in law has to be achieved, but that is a long-drawn process. Undoubtedly, the
States and Union should be alive to this problem. Only on the basis that some differences arise in
one or the other States in regard to testamentary succession, the law does not become
discriminatory so as to be invalid. Such differences are bound to arise in a federal set-up.
8. The learned counsel for the petitioners relied on the decisions in B. Venkataramana v. State of
Madras [1951 SCC 359:
AIR 1951 SC 229], Sheokaransingh v. Daulatram [AIR 1955 Raj 201: 1956 Raj LW 81
(FB)] , State of Rajasthan v. Thakur Pratap Singh [AIR 1960 SC 1208] , Hem Nolini
Judah v. Isolyne Sarojbashini Bose [AIR 1962 SC 1471 : 1962 Supp (3) SCR 294] ,
Mary Sonia Zachariah v. Union of India [(1995) 1 KLT 644 (FB)] , Ahmedabad
Women Action Group (AWAG) v. Union of India [(1997) 3 SCC 573] and Preman v.
Union of India [(1998) 2 KLT 1004] . However, in the light of the above conclusion, it
is unnecessary to refer to those decisions, though some of them may have a bearing in
analysing and understanding the scope of the provisions, which are made applicable
exclusively to Christians as it happened in the case of Section 118 of the Act or in the
case of the Indian Divorce Act. Therefore, we have not adverted to anyone of these
provisions. If Christians alone had been discriminated against by treating them as a
separate class, we think the argument could have been understood and merited
consideration."
(Emphasis supplied) The Apex Court holds that the provisions under Sections 213
and 57 of the Indian Succession Act are not discriminatory tracing the history of
those provisions. The Apex Court in a judgment rendered on 24th July 2019 in the
case of KANTA YADAV v. OM PRAKASH YADAV AND OTHERS4 holds that probate
or letters of administration will not be required to be obtained by a Hindu in respect
of a Will made outside those territories regarding immovable properties. The
territories are a part of the provision itself. They are the territories of Bengal, Madras
and Bombay. The Apex Court holds as follows:
"5. It is undisputed that the present National Capital Region of Delhi was part of
erstwhile State of Punjab prior to 1-11-1966. The argument raised by the respondents
is that Section 57 of the Act is applicable where the properties and parties are situated
in the territories of Bengal, Madras or Bombay, therefore, it is not necessary to seek
probate or letter of administration in respect of properties or the persons when they
are not located in the States of Bengal, Madras or Bombay hereunder:
xxxxxx
6. The said provisions have been examined and come up for consideration time and
again before the Punjab and Haryana High Court and the Delhi High Court. In Ram
Chand v. Sardara Singh [Ram Chand v. Sardara Singh, 1961 SCC OnLine P&H 233
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/152314168/ 20
Sri. G. Lokeshwarappa vs State Of Karnataka on 2 June, 2023
(2020) 14 SCC 102 : AIR 1962 P&H 382 : PLR (1962) 64 P&H 265] , the Punjab High
Court held as under : (SCC OnLine P&H : AIR p. 388, paras 5-7) "5. The clear effect
of these provisions appears to be that the provisions of Section 213(1) requiring
probate do not apply to wills made outside Bengal and the local original jurisdictional
limits of the High Courts at Madras and Bombay except where such wills relate to
immovable property situated within those territories.
6. There remains to be considered the decision [Kesar Singh v. Tej Kaur, 1961 SCC
OnLine P&H 71 : PLR (1961) 63 P&H 473] of Shamsher Bahadur, J., in the case
mentioned above, which is apparently based on the decision of a Full Bench in
Ganshamdoss Narayandoss v. Gulab Bi Bai [Ganshamdoss Narayandoss v. Gulab Bi
Bai, 1927 SCC OnLine Mad 158 :
ILR (1927) 50 Mad 927] . I find, however, on perusing this judgment that what has
been held is that a defendant resisting a claim made by the plaintiff as heir-at-law
cannot rely in defence on a will executed in his favour at Madras in respect of
property situate in Madras, when the will is not probated and no letters of
administration with the will annexed have been granted. This is clearly in accordance
with the provisions of Sections 213 and 57(a) of the Act, and the only point on which
the matter was referred to the Full Bench was whether a will could be set up in
defence in a suit without probate.
7. As I have said the clear reading of the provisions of the Act leave no doubt
whatever that no probate is necessary in order to set up a claim regarding property
either movable or immovable on the basis of a will executed in the Punjab and not
relating to property situated in the territories mentioned in Section 57(a). I
accordingly accept the revision petition and set aside the order of the lower court
requiring the petitioner to obtain probate. The matter may now be disposed of by the
lower court, where the parties have been directed to appear on 4-12-1961. The parties
will bear their own costs in this Court."
7. The said view was affirmed by the Division Bench of the Punjab and Haryana High
Court in Behari Lal Ram Charan v. Karam Chand Sahni [Behari Lal Ram Charan v.
Karam Chand Sahni, 1966 SCC OnLine P&H 226 : AIR 1968 P&H 108] : (SCC OnLine
P&H) "3. From a bare perusal of these two sections it is apparent that the objection of
Defendant 1 on the preliminary issue raised by him in the trial court was without any
substance. Clause (a) of Section 57 read with sub-section (2) of Section 213, it would
appear, applies to those cases where the property and parties are situate in the
territories of Bengal, Madras and Bombay, while clause (b) applies to those cases
where the parties are not residing in those territories but the property involved is
situate within those territories. Clause (c) of Section 57, however, is not relevant for
the present purposes.

Sri. G. Lokeshwarappa vs State Of Karnataka on 2 June, 2023
Therefore, where both the person and property of any Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh or Jaina, are outside
the territories mentioned above, the rigour of Section 213, sub-section (1), is not attracted.
Reference was made by the learned referring Judge to a decision of the Supreme Court in Hem
Nolini Judah v. Isolyne Sarojbashini Bose [Hem Nolini Judah v. Isolyne Sarojbashini Bose, AIR
1962 SC 1471] , but the parties in that case were Christians (to whom it is agreed Section 57 does not
apply) and their Lordships only considered the implications of sub-section (1) of Section 213 of the
Act and not of sub-section (2) of that section read with Section 57 clauses (a) and (b). The learned
Single Judge probably felt the difficulty because of the view taken by Shamsher Bahadur, J. In Kesar
Singh v. Tej Kaur [Kesar Singh v. Tej Kaur, 1961 SCC OnLine P&H 71 : PLR (1961) 63 P&H 473] , but
that judgment was considered by Falshaw, J. (as he then was) in Ram Chand v. Sardara Singh [Ram
Chand v. Sardara Singh, 1961 SCC OnLine P&H 233 : AIR 1962 P&H 382 :
PLR (1962) 64 P&H 265] , who differed from the view taken by Shamsher Bahadur,
J., in the abovementioned case, holding that no probate was necessary in order to set
up a claim regarding property either movable or immovable on the basis of a will
executed in the Punjab and a succession certificate could be granted on the ground of
a will without obtaining probate. While referring to the decision of Shamsher
Bahadur, J., in Kesar Singh case [Kesar Singh v. Tej Kaur, 1961 SCC OnLine P&H 71 :
PLR (1961) 63 P&H 473] , Falshaw, J., observed that the view taken by Shamsher
Bahadur, J., was apparently based on the decision of a Full Bench in Ganshamdoss
Narayandoss v. Gulab Bi Bai [Ganshamdoss Narayandoss v. Gulab Bi Bai, 1927 SCC
OnLine Mad 158 : ILR (1927) 50 Mad 927] where it was held that a defendant
resisting a claim made by the plaintiff as heir- at-law could not rely in defence on a
will executed in his favour at Madras in respect of property situate in Madras, when
the will was not probated and no letters of administration with the will annexed had
been granted. The Madras case was clearly in accordance with Section 213 read with
Section 57 of the Act. We agree with the view taken by Falshaw, J., in Ram Chand
case [Ram Chand v. Sardara Singh, 1961 SCC OnLine P&H 233 : AIR 1962 P&H 382 :
PLR (1962) 64 P&H 265] . A similar view was expressed by Jai Lal, J., in Sohan Singh
v. Bhag Singh [Sohan Singh v. Bhag Singh, 1934 SCC OnLine Lah 183 : AIR 1934 Lah
599] , and by me in Radhe Lal v. Ladli Parshad [Radhe Lal v. Ladli Parshad, CR No.
340-D of 1965, order dated 24-8-1965 (P&H)] . Even a cursory glance at Sections 213
and 57 of the Act leaves no room for doubt that the view taken by Shamsher Bahadur,
J., in the case mentioned above was erroneous.
It appears that the case of Sohan Singh v. Bhag Singh [Sohan Singh v. Bhag Singh, 1934 SCC OnLine
Lah 183 : AIR 1934 Lah 599] , referred to above, was not brought to his notice."
8. In Winifred Nora Theophilus v. Lila Deane [Winifred Nora Theophilus v. Lila Deane, 2001 SCC
OnLine Del 644 : AIR 2002 Del 6] , a Single Bench of the Delhi High Court held as under : (SCC
OnLine Del para 11) "11. On interpretation of Section 213 read with Sections 57(a) and (b), the
Courts have opined that where the will is made by Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh and Jaina and were subject
to the Lt. Governor of Bengal or within the local limits of ordinary, original civil jurisdiction of High

Sri. G. Lokeshwarappa vs State Of Karnataka on 2 June, 2023
Courts of Judicature at Madras and Bombay or even made outside but relating to immovable
property within the aforesaid territories that embargo contained in Section 213 shall apply. From
this it stands concluded that if will is made by Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh or Jaina outside Bengal,
Madras or Bombay then embargo contained in Section 213 shall not apply. This is what the various
judgments cited by the learned counsel for the defendants decide.
Therefore, there is no problem in arriving at the conclusion that if the will is made in Delhi relating
to immovable property in Delhi by Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh or Jaina, no probate is required."
9. The Division Bench of the Delhi High Court in Rajan Suri v. State [Rajan Suri v. State, 2005 SCC
OnLine Del 1290 :
AIR 2006 Del 148] referred to the Division Bench judgment in Behari Lal [Behari Lal
Ram Charan v. Karam Chand Sahni, 1966 SCC OnLine P&H 226 : AIR 1968 P&H
108] case and certain other Single Bench judgments of the Delhi High Court to
conclude as under : (Rajan Suri case [Rajan Suri v. State, 2005 SCC OnLine Del 1290
: AIR 2006 Del 148] , SCC OnLine Del para 33) "33. The result of the aforesaid is that
complete line of judgments referred by the learned counsel for the petitioner in
support of the submission that probate is mandatory would have no application to
the facts of the present case and thus findings arrived at in the collateral proceedings
in the suit to which the petitioners were parties would bind the petitioners."
10. The learned counsel for the respondents also referred to the Supreme Court judgment in
Clarence Pais v. Union of India [Clarence Pais v. Union of India, (2001) 4 SCC 325] wherein, validity
of Section 213 of the Act was challenged as unconstitutional and discriminatory against the
Christians. This Court held as under : (SCC p. 332, para 6) "6. ... A combined reading of Sections 213
and 57 of the Act would show that where the parties to the will are Hindus or the properties in
dispute are not in territories falling under Sections 57(a) and (b), sub- section (2) of Section 213 of
the Act applies and sub- section (1) has no application. As a consequence, a probate will not be
required to be obtained by a Hindu in respect of a will made outside those territories or regarding
the immovable properties situate outside those territories. The result is that the contention put forth
on behalf of the petitioners that Section 213(1) of the Act is applicable only to Christians and not to
any other religion is not correct."
11. The statutory provisions are clear that the Act is applicable to wills and codicils made by any
Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh or Jain, who were subject to the jurisdiction of the Lieutenant Governor of
Bengal or within the local limits of the ordinary original civil jurisdiction of the High Courts of
Madras or Bombay -- [clause (a) of Section 57 of the Ac]. Secondly, it is applicable to all wills and
codicils made outside those territories and limits so far as relates to immovable property within the
territories aforementioned, clause (b) of Section 57. Clause (c) of Section 57 of the Act relates to the
wills and codicils made by any Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh or Jain on or after the first day of January,
1927, to which provisions are not applied by clauses (a) and (b). However, sub-section (2) of Section
213 of the Act applies only to wills made by Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh or Jain where such wills are of the
classes specified in clauses (a) or (b) of Section 57. Thus, clause (c) is not applicable in view of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/152314168/ 23
Sri. G. Lokeshwarappa vs State Of Karnataka on 2 June, 2023
Section 213(2) of the Act.
12. In view thereof, the wills and codicils in respect of the persons who are subject to the Lieutenant
Governor of Bengal or who are within the local limits of ordinary original civil jurisdiction of the
High Court of Madras or Bombay and in respect of the immovable properties situated in the above
three areas. Such is the view taken in the number of judgments referred to above in the States of
Punjab and Haryana as well as in Delhi as also by this Court in Clarence Pais [Clarence Pais v. Union
of India, (2001) 4 SCC 325]".
(Emphasis supplied) Following the said judgment of the Apex Court, a learned single Judge of the
High Court of Kerala on the very issue in the case of DR.P.C. BEENAKUMARI v. STATE OF
KERALA5 has held as follows:
"7. The testator of the Will is a Hindu Woman. The question is whether the rejection
by the 2nd respondent, of the claim of the petitioner to pay the amounts belonging to
the Testator and bequeathed to the petitioner by a Will, for the reason that the Will is
not probated, is justified. Section 213 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 provides as
to when the right as Executor or Legatee is established. Section 213 of the Indian
Succession Act, 1925 reads as follows:
10. It is therefore evident that Part VI will apply only to Wills and Codicils made by a
Hindu on or after 01.09.1870 within the territories of erstwhile Lt. Governor of
Bengal or of High Courts of Judicature at Madras and Bombay, to Wills in respect of
immovable property situate within those territories and to Wills made on or after
01.01.1927 to which those provisions are not applied by Clauses (a) and (b). The Will
in issue in this case was executed in Cherthala Taluk, which does not fall within the
aforesaid territories.
11. In the judgment in Clarence Pais v. Union of India [(2001) 4 SCC 325: AIR 2001
SC 1151], the Hon'ble Apex Court held that:
"A combined reading of Ss.213 and 57 of the Act would show that S.213 (1) which
contains the restrictions prohibiting recognition of rights as an executor or legatee
under a will without production of a probate, is applicable to Parsis after the
amendment of the Act in 1962 and to Hindus who reside within the territories which
on 01.09.1870 were subject to the Lt.
2021 SCC OnLine Ker 12730 Governor of Bengal or to areas covered by original
jurisdiction of the High Courts of Bombay and Madras and to all wills made outside
territories and limits so far as they relate to immovable property situate within those
territories and limits."
12. The issue of probating wills was examined by this Court in Kurian @ Jacob v. Chellamma John
[2017 (5) KHC 257] and this Court held that:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/152314168/ 24
Sri. G. Lokeshwarappa vs State Of Karnataka on 2 June, 2023
"Viewed in a historical perspective, initially, the rights of the Hindus and the Muslims
in British India were severely restricted in the matters of testamentary disposition. So
it was inconsequential whether their wills were probated or not. But the Christians
could Will away their entire property; the Legislature in its wisdom, then, thought
that their Wills should be probated. It may be noted that the Wills of the Hindus, the
Muslims, and others were also to be probated if it dealt with immovable property in
the Presidency Towns, where the value of the property, usually, was high. In other
words, probate is unnecessary unless clauses (a) and (b) of Section 57 of the Act are
attracted."
13. The Hon'ble Apex Court considered Section 213(2) of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 in Kanta
Yadav v. Om Prakash Yadav [(2020) 14 SCC 102] and held that:
"The statutory provisions are clear that the Succession Act is applicable to wills and
codicils made by any Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh or Jain, who were subject to the
jurisdiction of the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal or within the local limits of the
ordinary original civil jurisdiction of the High Courts of Madras or Bombay - [Clause
(a) of Section 57 of the Act]. Secondly, it is applicable to all wills and codicils made
outside those territories and limits so far as relates to immovable property within the
territories aforementioned - Clause (b) of Section 57. The Clause (c) of Section 57 of
the Act relates to the wills and codicils made by any Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh or Jain on
or after the first day of January, 1927, to which provisions are not applied by Clauses
(a) and (b). However, Sub-Section (2) of Section 213 of the Act applies only to wills
made by Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh or Jain where such wills are of the classes specified in
Clauses (a) or (b) of Section 57. Thus, Clause (c) is not applicable in view of Section
213(2) of the Act.
A combined reading of Sections 213 and 57 of the Succession Act would show that
where the parties to the will are Hindus or the properties in dispute are not in
territories falling under Sections 57(a) and (b), Section 213(2) of the Succession Act
applies and Section 213(1) has no application. As a consequence, a probate or letters
of administration will not be required to be obtained by a Hindu in respect of a will
made outside those territories or regarding the immovable properties situate outside
those territories."
14. Therefore, it is evident that the requirement of probating a Will is applicable to Wills and codicils
made by Hindus who were subject to the jurisdiction of the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal or within
the local limits of the ordinary original civil jurisdiction of the High Courts of Madras or Bombay.
15. In the circumstances, the stand of the 2nd respondent that the amounts left behind late Gouri
Amma and bequeathed to the petitioner cannot be paid to the petitioner without probating the Will,
cannot be sustained. Respondents 2 to 4 are therefore directed to release to the petitioner the
Treasury Savings Bank amount covered by Exts.P5 and P6 in the name of K.R. Gouri Amma."

Sri. G. Lokeshwarappa vs State Of Karnataka on 2 June, 2023
(Emphasis supplied) The aforesaid judgments were in fact following a decision of the three Judge
Bench of the Apex Court in the case of MRS.HEM NOLINI JUDAH v. MRS. ISOLYNE
SAROJBASHINI BOSE AND OTHERS6 wherein it is held as follows:
AIR 1962 SC 1471 "Re (i)
7. We have already pointed out that though it was said that Dr Miss Mitter had
executed a will in favour of her mother Mrs Mitter in June, 1925 bequeathing the
house in dispute to her, no probate or letters of administration were ever obtained by
Mrs Mitter. It is true that Mrs Mitter in her turn made a will in favour of the
appellant and she obtained letters of administration of that will. In that will the house
in dispute was mentioned as the property of Mrs Mitter and was bequeathed to the
appellant and in the letters of administration granted to her this property was
mentioned as one of the properties coming to her by the will of her mother. The
question therefore that arises is whether it was necessary before the appellant could
take advantage of the bequest in favour of Mrs Mitter that letters of administration of
the will of Dr Miss Mitter should have been obtained by Mrs Mitter. Section 213(1)
which governs this matter is in these terms:
"(1) No right as executor or legatee can be established in any Court of Justice, unless
a Court of competent jurisdiction in India has granted probate of the will under
which the right is claimed, or has granted letters of administration with the will or
with a copy of an authenticated copy of the will annexed."
This Section clearly creates a bar to the establishment of any right under will by an executor or a
legatee unless Probate or letters of administration of the will have been obtained. It is now
well-settled that it is immaterial whether the right under the will is claimed as a plaintiff or as a
defendant; in either case Section 213 will be a bar to any right being claimed by a person under a will
whether as a plaintiff or as a defendant unless Probate or letters of administration of the will have
been obtained : (see Ganshamdoss Narayandoss v. Gulab Bi Bai [(1927) ILR I Mad 927] ). But it is
urged on behalf of the appellant that this Section will not bar her because she obtained letters of
administration of the will of her mother Mrs Mitter under which she is claiming and that it was not
necessary for Mrs Mitter to have obtained Probate of the will of Dr Miss Mitter in her favour. Now it
is not in dispute that the grant of Probate or letters of administration does not establish that the
person making the will was the owner of the property which he may have given away by the will, and
any person interested in the property included in the will can always file a suit to establish his right
to the property to the exclusion of the testator in spite of the grant of Probate or letters of
administration to the legatee or the executor, the reason being that proceedings for Probate or
letters of administration are not concerned with titles to property but are only concerned with the
due execution of the will. Therefore, when the plaintiff-respondent contended in effect that the
appellant could not establish her right to the full ownership of this property on the basis of the will
of Mrs Mitter because Mrs Mitter had not obtained Probate or letters of administration of the will of
Dr Miss Mitter, she was really contending that Mrs Mitter was not the full owner of this property so
that she could dispose it of as she willed. The plaintiff-respondent was thus disputing the title of Mrs
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/152314168/ 26
Sri. G. Lokeshwarappa vs State Of Karnataka on 2 June, 2023
Mitter to dispose of the entire disputed house by her will on the ground that Mrs Mitter was not the
sole owner of this house after the death of Dr Miss Mitter. In order therefore that the appellant
should succeed on the basis of the letters of administration of the will of Mrs Mitter which had been
granted to her with respect to this house, she had to show that Mrs Mitter was the full owner of this
house at the time she made the will in her favour. Now the appellant could show this by other
evidence; but if the appellant wanted to rely on any will of Dr Miss Mitter in favour of Mrs Mitter, in
proof of full ownership of Mrs Mitter of this house, it would amount to this that the appellant was
saying that Mrs Mitter was the owner of the house as the legatee under the will made by Dr Miss
Mitter. The appellant would thus be asserting the ownership of Mrs Mitter of the whole house as a
legatee, and this is what sub-section (1) of Section 213 clearly forbids, for it says that no right as a
legatee can be established in a Court of Justice, unless the Probate or letters of administration have
been obtained of the will under which the right as a legatee is claimed. It is true that so far as the will
of Mrs Mitter in favour of the appellant is concerned, she has obtained letters of administration of
that and she can maintain her right as a legatee under that will; but that will in her favour only gives
her those properties which really and truly belonged to Mrs Mitter, that will however does not create
title in the appellant in properties which did not really and truly belong to Mrs Mitter but which Mrs
Mitter might have thought it fit to include in the will. Therefore, as soon as the appellant, in order to
succeed on the basis of the will in her favour of which she obtained letters of administration, alleges
that Mrs Mitter was full owner of the property able to will it away to her, she had to prove the title of
Mrs Mitter to the property. Now if that title rests on Mrs Mitter's being a legatee of Dr Miss Mitter
the appellant will have to prove that Mrs Mitter had the right as a legatee under the will of Dr Miss
Mitter. As soon as the appellant wants to prove that, Section 213 will immediately stand in her way
for no right as an executor or a legatee can be proved unless Probate or letters of administration of
the will under which such right is claimed have been obtained. The words of Section 213 are not
restricted only to those cases where the claim is made by a person directly claiming as a legatee. The
Section does not say that no person can claim as a legatee or as an executor unless he obtains
Probate or letters of administration of the will under which he claims. What it says is that no right as
an executor or legatee can be established in any Court of Justice, unless Probate or letters of
administration have been obtained of the will under which the right is claimed, and therefore it is
immaterial who wishes to establish the right as a legatee or an executor. Whosoever wishes to
establish that right, whether it be a legatee or an executor himself or somebody else who might find
it necessary in order to establish his right to establish the right of some legatee or executor from
whom he might have derived title, he cannot do so unless the will under which the right as a legatee
or executor is claimed has resulted in the grant of a Probate or letters of administration. Therefore,
as soon as the appellant wanted to establish that Mrs Mitter was the legatee of Dr Miss Mitter and
was therefore entitled to the whole house she could only do so if the will of Dr Miss Mitter in favour
of Mrs Mitter had resulted in the grant of Probate or letters of administration. Admittedly that did
not happen and therefore Section 213(1) would be a bar to the appellant showing that her mother
was the full owner of the property by virtue of the will made in her favour by Dr Miss Mitter. The
difference between a right claimed as a legatee under a will and a right which might arise otherwise
is clear in this very case. The right under the will which was claimed was that Mrs Mitter became the
owner of the entire house. Of course, without the will Mrs Mitter was an equal heir with her
daughters of the property left by Dr Miss Mitter, as the latter would be taken to have died intestate,
and would thus be entitled to one-fourth. It will be seen from the judgment of the High Court that it
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/152314168/ 27
Sri. G. Lokeshwarappa vs State Of Karnataka on 2 June, 2023
has held that the appellant is entitled to the one-fourth share to which Mrs Mitter was entitled as an
heir to Dr Miss Mitter and granted the plaintiff- respondent a declaration with respect to only half
the house. Therefore, the High Court was right in holding that Section 213 would bar the appellant
from establishing the right of her mother as a legatee from Dr Miss Mitter as no Probate or letters of
administration had been obtained of the alleged will of Dr Miss Mitter in favour of Mrs Mitter. The
contention of the appellant on this head must therefore fail."
(Emphasis supplied) What would unmistakably emerge from the aforesaid judgments of the Apex
Court, this Court and that of the High Court of Kerala is that, the Will that is now directed to be
probated for transfer of 22 sites in favour of the petitioner in W.P.No.8023 of 2020 is unsustainable.
The unsustainability is due to the very provisions of the Indian Succession Act. The Board, having a
decree against it, as obtained by the uncle of the petitioner and that decree having become final,
cannot now contend that the Will has to be probated and only then, the fruits of the decree will be
granted to the petitioner in Writ Petition No.8023 of 2020.
Therefore, the resolution and the endorsement/order dated 07-03-2020, in W.P.No.8023 of 2020 is
rendered unsustainable.
The petitioner would also become entitled for a mandamus to the Board for re-conveyance of sites in
favour of the petitioner in Writ Petition No.8023 of 2020, in terms of the decree so granted by the
civil Court in O.S.No.182 of 2014 in terms of its decree dated 20-06-2019.
22. Insofar as the fate of the petitioners in W.P.No.3123 of 2017 is concerned, they are persons who
have deposited certain amount and are in possession of certain orders from various consumer fora,
which have directed execution of sale deeds in their favour by the Board. The conflict now lies with
the order of the Civil Court and that of the order of the District Consumer Forum. The order of the
Civil Court has granted declaratory relief in favour of the uncle of the petitioner in W.P.No.8023 of
2020, which stands on a higher pedestal than the orders that are granted by the Consumer fora in
favour of the petitioners. Therefore, those petitioners are within their rights to avail such remedy as
is available in law against the petitioner in Writ Petition No.8023 of 2020 or the Board as the case
would be. No order in favour of the petitioners can be passed in Writ Petition No.3123 of 2027 in the
teeth of the aforesaid findings in Writ Petition No.8023 of 2020. Writ Petition No.17555 of 2016 is
rendered infructuous as no order become necessary to be passed in the light of the findings in Writ
Petition No.8023 of 2020.
23. For the aforesaid reasons, I pass the following:
ORDER
(i) Writ Petition No.8023 of 2020 is allowed.
(ii) The endorsement dated 07-03-2020 stands obliterated.

(iii) As a consequence, mandamus issues to the 2nd respondent/Karnataka Housing
Board to act in terms of the decree dated 20-06-2019 passed in O.S.No.182 of 2014
by the Court of Principal Civil Judge & CJM, Shivamogga.
(iv) Writ Petition No.17555 of 2016 is disposed of as having become infructuous.
(v) Writ Petition No.3123 of 2017 stands dismissed with liberty reserved to the
petitioners to avail of such remedy as is available in law.
