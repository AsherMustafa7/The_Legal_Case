CORAM: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE
and
HONOURABLE JUSTICE SMT. ANJANA MISHRA
ORAL JUDGMENT
(Per: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE) Date : 22-04-2019 Heard the learned counsel for the
appellant and the learned counsel for the State of Bihar.
2. The appellant is a widow of Late Surbanshi Ram @ Surbansh Ram, who was a Class IV employee
and who died on 12th of June, 2012. The dispute relates to the award of family pension to the widow
of the deceased employee.
3. The learned single Judge has denied the relief on the ground that the appellant being the second
wife of the deceased Patna High Court L.P.A No.72 of 2018 dt.22-04-2019 employee was not entitled
to the family pension keeping in view the relevant rules. Hence this appeal.
4. It is urged on behalf of the appellant that the learned single Judge has overlooked the true impact
of the rules on the peculiar facts of this case where the first wife Lalmuni Devi had already died
during the lifetime of the deceased employee on 18th of May, 2012 itself. Thus, on the date when the
employee died, there was only one widow and surviving wife, namely, the appellant herein.

5. In order to understand the controversy, we may point out that the Family Pension Scheme as was
promulgated and revised by the State Government from time to time earlier contained a provision
that where an employee survived by more than one widow, the pension will be paid to them in equal
share. This is evident from the extract of the revised provisions contained in the Finance
Department's Resolution dated 19th of April, 1990 in respect of the Family Pension Scheme
promulgated with effect from 1964.
6. The aforesaid provision, however, came to be revised by the Resolution of the Finance
Department dated 06th of September, 1996. The same is reproduced herein under:

7. A perusal of the same would indicate that the earlier resolution was taken notice of and an
amendment was made that even if an employee consummates a second marriage during the
subsistence of the first marriage and the first wife is surviving, then in that event the second wife
will not get family pension but her illegitimate children would be entitled to the same.
8. In the instant case, the peculiar fact is that even though there appears to have been a second
marriage, but the first wife had already died before the death of the employee himself. Thus, the
second wife was the only widow surviving as on the date of the death of the employee and there was
nobody else to claim the family pension as the first wife had no children. In the given circumstances
therefore, this peculiar case required a different Patna High Court L.P.A No.72 of 2018
dt.22-04-2019 treatment and interpretation in the light of the Resolution dated 6 th of September,
1996, quoted herein above, and since the appellant was only surviving widow and wife as on the date
of the death of the employee, there is no other prejudice being caused to the Government nor there
being a violation of the Resolution dated 06th of September, 1996, the appellant ought to have been

extended the said benefit. We do not find any such consideration having been made by the learned
single Judge in the impugned judgment dated 06th December, 2017.
9. Accordingly, we allow this appeal and set aside the impugned judgment dated 06.12.2017 and
issue a mandamus to the 3rd respondent for revisiting the matter in the light of the facts stated
above and the Letter No.44 dated 30th March, 2015 is quashed.
10. The appeal and the writ petition both stand disposed of accordingly.
