M/S.Aathi Hotel vs The Assistant Commissioner (St) (Fac) on 8 December, 2021
(cid:12) W.P.No.3474 of 2021
ORDER
The petitioner had challenged the impugned order dated 06.02.2020, which reads as under:-
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
2. It is the case of the petitioner that though the petitioner had filed TRAN-1 and
claimed a credit of Rs.3,86,271/-, the aforesaid credit was never utilized and
therefore even though the petitioner had failed to reply to the Show Cause Notice
dated 09.05.2019 followed by a summary Show Cause Notice dated 31.12.2019, the
question of levying interest and imposing penalty on the petitioner under the
provisions of Tamil Nadu Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 does not arise inasmuch
as the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis entire transitional credit of Rs.3,86,271/-
was reversed by the petitioner in the monthly returns for the month of January 2020
for the Assessment Year 2019-2020.
3. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that Section 74 of the Tamil Nadu
Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 will get attracted only where there is a wrong
utilization of credit availed. In this connection, the learned counsel for the petitioner
has referred to Section 50 (3) of the Act. It is submitted that interest under Section 50
(3) of the Act will apply only in the case of a person who makes undue or excess claim
of Input Tax Credit under sub-section 10 of Section 42 or undue or excess reduction
in output tax liability under sub-section 10 of Section 43 in which case, interest shall
be paid on such undue or excess claim or on such undue or excess
reduction/deduction as the case may be, at such rate not exceeding 24 percentage as
may be notified by the Government on the recommendations of the GST Council.
4. The learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that Section 42 (10) of the
Tamil Nadu Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 is https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
not attracted in the facts and circumstances of the case, as the petitioner has never
utilized the credit which was attempted for transition by filing TRAN-1. He submits
that sub-section 10 to Section 42 will apply when the amount reduced from the
output tax liability in contravention of the provisions of sub-section 7 which has to be
added to the output tax liability of the recipient in his return for the month in which
contravention takes place and such recipient shall be liable to pay tax/interest on the
amount so added at the rate specified under sub-section 3 of Section 50 of the Tamil
Nadu Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017.
5. The learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that Section 42 (7) will not
apply as Section 47 (2) applies to the situation where will apply, in the case of a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131893621/ 2
M/S.Aathi Hotel vs The Assistant Commissioner (St) (Fac) on 8 December, 2021
recipient. Section 42(7) of the Act reads as under:-
“Section 42. Matching, reversal and reclaim of input tax credit-
(7). The recipient shall be eligible to reduce, from his output tax liability, the amount
added under sub-Section (5), if the supplier declares the details of the invoice or debit
note in his valid return within the time specified in sub-Section (9)
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis of Section 39.”
6. The learned counsel for the petitioner has also referred to decision of the Hon'ble
Division Bench of the Patna High Court in the case of Commercial Steel Engineering
Corporation Vs. State of Bihar, [2019] 28 GSTL 579 (Patna). A specific reference was
made to Paras 29 and 35 & 36 which reads as under:-
"29. I have reproduced the relevant provisions of the ‘BGST Act’ which finds mention
in the discussion held for ready reference. The legislative intent present in these
provisions is eloquent and I am in no confusion to hold that be it a charge of wrong
availment or utilization, each is a positive act and it is only when such act is
substantiated that it makes the dealer concerned, liable for recovery of such amount
of tax as availed from the input tax credit or utilized by him but in each of the two
circumstances, the tax available at the credit of the dealer concerned must have been
brought into use by him thus, reducing the credit balance. A plain reading of Section
73 would confirm that it is only on such availment or utilization of credit to reduce
tax liability, which is recoverable under section 73(1) read alongside the other
provisions present thereunder. In fact the position is made even more clear by
reading the said provision alongside sub-section (5), (7), (8), (9) to (11).
30. ......
31. ......
32. ......
33. ......
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
34. ......
35. The legislative intent reflected from a purposeful reading of the provisions
underlying section 140 alongside the provisions of section 73 and Rules 117 and 121 is
that even a wrongly reflected transitional credit in an electronic ledger on its own is
not sufficient to draw penal proceedings until the same or any portion thereof, is put
to use so as to become recoverable.

M/S.Aathi Hotel vs The Assistant Commissioner (St) (Fac) on 8 December, 2021
36. This important aspect of the matter has eluded the wisdom of the respondent
no.3 while passing the order. In fact it is on a complete misappreciation of legal
position which lies at the foundation of the demand raised by the impugned order
whereby the credit amount reflected in the credit ledger to the tune of
Rs.42,73,869.00 has been treated as an outstanding tax liability against the
petitioner to order for its recovery together with interest and penalty even when the
electronic credit ledger status at Annexure 7 confirms to a credit in favour of the
petitioner i.e. a negative tax liability."
7. Opposing the prayer, the learned Additional Government Pleader for the respondent submits that
the petitioner has an alternate remedy under Section 107 of the Tamil Nadu Goods and Services Act,
2017 and therefore this writ petition is liable to be dismissed.
8. The learned Additional Government Pleader for the respondent submits that the petitioner has an
alternate remedy before the Appellate Commissioner and therefore the writ petition is liable to be
dismissed. The learned Additional Government Pleader for the respondent further
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis submits that the petitioner was neither entitled to Input Tax
Credit under the provisions of the erstwhile Tamil Nadu Value Added Tax Act, 2006 nor entitled to
transition in the credit under the provisions of Tamil Nadu Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 and
therefore submits even on merits the petitioner is liable to pay interest and penalty for availing the
transitional credit wrongly.
9. The learned Additional Government Pleader for the respondent further submits that the
petitioner has admitted that the petitioner was not registered as a dealer of furniture products under
the TNVAT Act, 2006 and therefore the attempt of the petitioner to avail credit and transition the
same shows that the petitioner's intention was not bonafide but was to wrongly utilize the input tax
credit which was not available to the petitioner.
10. That apart, it is submitted that the petitioner had un-availed credit for a sum of Rs.2,29,850/-
whereas the petitioner transitioned a credit of Rs.3,86,271/- with a view to wrongly utilize the same.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
11. The learned Additional Government Pleader for the respondent further submits that the interest
is consequential and the penalty is also consequential in terms of the Section 74 of the TNGST Act,
2017 and therefore prays for the dismissal of the writ petition.
12. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned Additional Government Pleader for
the respondents and perused the impugned order and the decision of the Hon'ble Patna High Court
referred to supra.
13. The undisputed facts of the case are that the petitioner is a hotelier and had purchased certain
capital goods in connection with the business. Since GST was being implemented, the petitioner
appears to have availed input tax credit paid on the capital goods which were purchased in
connection with the hotel business with a view to set off the tax liability on the furniture business
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131893621/ 4
M/S.Aathi Hotel vs The Assistant Commissioner (St) (Fac) on 8 December, 2021
which the petitioner intended to start.
14. There are no record to show that the petitioner had started such
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis business in sale of furniture. What is evident is that the petitioner
had wrongly attempted to transitioned a credit of Rs.3,86,271/- hoping that in case of future tax
liability, the petitioner can use the same against the tax liability. Thus, the intention of the petitioner
was not bonafide.
15. After Show Cause Notice was issued to the petitioner on 09.05.2019, the petitioner replied and
admitted the mistake by a reply dated 04.02.2020. The petitioner also reversed the transitional
credit in the returns filed for the month of January 2019-20 in Form GSTR-3B under Rule 61(5) of
the TNGST Rules, 2017. There are no records to show utilization of such credit.
16. Thus, the facts on record indicates that though an improper attempt was made by the petitioner
to transition the aforesaid credit. The petitioner had however not utilized the same and had also
reversed the same on 10.02.2020 after a Show Cause Notice were issued within a period prescribed
under Section 73 of TNGST Act, 2017 by invoking Section 74 of the TNGST Act, 2017. However, the
Show Cause Notice does not invoke the ingredients to justify the invocation of Section 74 of
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis the TNGST Act, 2017 against the petitioner.
17. Be that as it may, if the Show Cause Notice issued to the petitioner on 09.05.2019 is to be
construed as a notice under Section 74 of the TNGST Act, 2017, the Show Cause Notice should have
specifically invoked the ingredients of Section 74(1) of the TNGST Act, 2017. However, the said
notice merely states that due to the unavailability of documents to prove admissibility of the ITC,
Assessment under Section 74 is proceeded. Thus, the Show Cause Notice dated 31.12.2019 does not
meet the requirements of Section 74(9) of the TNGST Act, 2017.
18. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Union of India Vs. Ind-Swift Laboratories Limited [2011] 4 SCC
635 while construing the provisions of erstwhile Cenvat Credit Rules 2002, held that wrong filing of
credit rule attracts interest under the Provisions of the Cenvat Credit Rules 2002 read with Central
Excise Act, 1944. There the credit was availed and the benefit of refund was claimed. The case was
attempted to be settled after payment of the amount ITC availed utilized before the settlement
commission which circled interest at 10% per annum from the due dte as
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis per Section 11 AB of the Central Excise Act, 1944. In paragraph 17
the Court held as under:-
"17. We have very carefully read the impugned judgment and order of the High Court.
The High Court proceeded by reading it down to mean that where CENVAT credit
has been taken and utilized wrongly, interest should be payable from the date the
CENVAT credit has been utilized wrongly for according to the High Court interest
cannot be claimed simply for the reason that the CENVAT credit has been wrongly
taken as such availment by itself does not create any liability of payment of excise
duty. Therefore, High Court on a conjoint reading of Section 11AB of the Act and
Rules 3 & 4 of the Credit Rules proceeded to hold that interest cannot be claimed
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131893621/ 5
M/S.Aathi Hotel vs The Assistant Commissioner (St) (Fac) on 8 December, 2021
from the date of wrong availment of CENVAT credit and that the interest would be
payable from the date CENVAT credit is wrongly utilized. In our considered opinion,
the High Court misread and misinterpreted the aforesaid Rule 14 and wrongly read it
down without properly appreciating the scope and limitation thereof. A statutory
provision is generally read down in order to save the said provision from being
declared unconstitutional or illegal. Rule 14 specifically provides that where CENVAT
credit has been taken or utilized wrongly or has been erroneously refunded, the same
along with interest would be recovered from the manufacturer or the provider of the
output service. The issue is as to whether the aforesaid word "Or"
appearing in Rule 14, twice, could be read as "AND" by way of reading it down as has been done
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis by the High Court. If the aforesaid provision is read as a whole we
find no reason to read the word "OR" in between the expressions 'taken' or 'utilized wrongly' or 'has
been erroneously refunded' as the word "AND". On the happening of any of the three aforesaid
circumstances such credit becomes recoverable along with interest"
19. The ratio in the above case is to be distinguished on facts as in the present case although credit
was wrongly attempted to be transitioned, it was never utilized. Further before levying penalty or
interest, a proper excise was required to be made by a proper officer under Section 74(10) after
ascertaining whether the credit was wrongly availed and wrongly utilised. Though under Sections
73(1) and 74(1) of the Act, proceedings can be initiated for mere wrong availing of Input Tax Credit
followed by imposition of interest penalty either under Section 73 or under Section 74 they stand
attracted only where such credit was not only availed but also utilised for discharging the tax
liability. The proper method would have been to levy penalty under Section 122 of TNGST Act, 2017.
20. Considering the above, I am inclined to hold that the petitioner
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis is not liable to penalty imposed. At the same time, since there was
an attempt to wrongly avail credits and utilise the same as and when the tax liability would have
arisen, the petitioner is held liable to a token penalty. Considering the gravity of the mistake
committed by the petitioner, a penalty Rs.10,000/- is imposed on the petitioner. The impugned
order stands partly quashed.
21. Accordingly, this writ petition stands partly allowed in terms of the above observations. No costs.
Consequently, connected miscellaneous petitions are closed.
