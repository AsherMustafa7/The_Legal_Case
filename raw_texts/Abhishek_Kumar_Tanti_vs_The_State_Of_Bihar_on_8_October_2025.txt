writ petitioner (appellant herein) was held to be not entitled for

Patna High Court L.P.A No.10 of 2023 dt.08-10-2025
2/6
2. The facts, in brief, are that the father of the
appellant died in harness on 22.02.2006 while he was posted as
an Accounts Clerk in the Flood Control Division, Siwan. The
father of the appellant had performed two marriages and the
appellant is the son of the second wife. After the death of
deceased employee (appellant's father), his first wife, Urmila
Devi, filed CWJC No. 14839 of 2006 seeking pensionary
benefits of her deceased husband, in which the present appellant
was a party respondent. The said writ petition was allowed on
05.11.2007
with a direction to the respondents pay the family pension to Urmila Devi and also to consider the
application to be made by the son of the deceased employee within two months for compassionate
appointment.
3. It is the further case of the appellant that he had filed a contempt application, bearing MJC No.
2994 of 2011, against non-compliance of the order of compassionate appointment dated 05.11.2007,
which was disposed of by this Court on 05.09.2011. Thereafter, the claim of the appellant was
rejected by the District Compassionate Appointment Committee, Siwan, vide order dated
06.11.2012, stating that since the government employee had married a second lady during the
lifetime of his first wife, the children born out of the Patna High Court L.P.A No.10 of 2023
dt.08-10-2025 wedlock of the second marriage, are not entitled to compassionate appointment.
4. Being aggrieved with the aforesaid order dated 06.11.2012, the appellant preferred CWJC No.
1442 of 2021 before the learned Single Judge.
5. The learned Single Judge, upon consideration of the materials on record, dismissed the writ
petition on 24.01.2022 on the ground of delay and laches. Aggrieved thereby, the present appeal has
been preferred by the writ petitioner.

6. Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the appellant had applied for his compassionate
appointment well within time and was representing his claim before the concerned authorities
repeatedly, but, the same was rejected on 06.11.2012. He further submits that the claim of the
appellant ought to have been considered in the light of the decision of the Hon'ble Full Bench of this
Court in Bihar State Electricity Board & Ors. v. Chandrashekhar Paswan & Ors. reported in 2019
SCC OnLine Pat 562, which was overlooked by the learned Single Judge while dismissing the writ
petition on the ground of delay and laches.
7. The learned counsel for the respondents submitted that the order of the learned Single Judge
requires no Patna High Court L.P.A No.10 of 2023 dt.08-10-2025 interference, and the learned
Single judge had rightly pronounced the judgment after considering the facts and circumstances of
the present the case.
8. The learned Single Judge after going through the facts had observed the following. Paragraph 4 of
the impugned judgment is reproduced below:
"4. The object of compassionate appointment is to meet immediate harness in the
family. Petitioner's family survived from 22.02.2006 to 06.11.2012 (memo No. 1565)
and even thereafter till date. The petitioner seems to be a fence sitter. After decision
rendered by this Court cited supra, he has opened his eyes in presenting the present
petition. Moreover, Apex Court held that compassionate appointment is not a
fundamental right. Apex Court in the case of State of Jammu and Kashmir V/s.
R.K.Zalpuri and others reported in AIR 2016 SC 3006, Paragraph-20 laid down
certain principles to entertain petition under Article 226 of the Constitution. One of
the principle is delay and laches. Therefore, on the ground of delay and laches
petitioner has not made out prima facie case to entertain the present petition. In the
light of these facts and circumstances, petitioner is not entitled to relief sought in the
present petition."
Patna High Court L.P.A No.10 of 2023 dt.08-10-2025
9. The learned counsel for the appellant relies upon Bihar State Electricity Board & Ors. v.
Chandrashekhar Paswan & Ors. reported in 2019 SCC OnLine Pat 562, whereby a full bench of this
court has held that the children of the second wife are to be considered for appointment on the basis
of compassionate grounds. This judgment, however, finds no application here, as the present case
has to be viewed considering the fact that approximately 19 years have passed since the death of the
appellant's father. The object of such compassionate appointment scheme is to meet immediate
hardship in the family, and here the appellant's family continues to survive initially from 2006 to
2012, and further till date.
10. In our view, compassionate appointment is not a vested right which can be claimed by the
appellant. The purpose of such scheme is that family of the deceased may not go through financial
hardship. In this case, after the death of the appellant's father approximately 19 years have passed,

and the family of appellant continues to survive. Thus, the object of the scheme itself is frustrated in
the present case.
11. Considering the findings given by the learned Single Judge, the facts of the case and the
discussions made above, we do not find any perversity in the order of the learned Patna High Court
L.P.A No.10 of 2023 dt.08-10-2025 Single Judge.
12. Accordingly, we do not find any reason to interfere with the order of the learned Single Judge
and the present appeal stands dismissed.
13. Interlocutory application(s), if any, shall also stand disposed of.
