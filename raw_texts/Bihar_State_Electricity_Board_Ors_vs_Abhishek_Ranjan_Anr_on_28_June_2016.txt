Bihar State Electricity Board & Ors vs Abhishek Ranjan & Anr on 28 June, 2016
The appellant-Bihar State Electricity Board, Patna (hereinafter referred to as "Board") decided to
make appointment to Patna High Court LPA No.289 of 2014 dt.28-06-2016 the vacant posts of
Assistant Electrical Engineer through campus selection process from different Engineering
Institutes in the State of Bihar. The campus selection process was based by the marks obtained by
the candidates in pre-final year and after marks obtained in the final year of the course were taken
into consideration for preparation of final select list. The writ applicant was selected for such
campus selection as BC candidate and was ranked 11 in the merit list of such candidates. A letter of
appointment was issued on the basis of such selection on 28th September, 2011 but before the writ
applicant could join the offer of appointment was withdrawn on 14th October, 2011. The
communication withdrawing the offer of appointment reads as follows:-
"BIHAR STATE ELECTRICITY BOARD, PATNA (Department of General
Administration) Letter No. 1817, Patna, dt. 14.10.11 From P K Govil Joint Secretary
To Sri Abhishek Ranjan C/o Late Radheshyam Mandal Vill. Guria, PO +PS Baunsi
Distt. Banka Sub: Regarding withdrawal of offer of appointment issued under letter
no.1704 dt. 28.9.2011 for appointment to the post of Assistant Electrical Engineer
(General).
Sir, I am directed to inform that on verification it was found that as per decision of
the Board only 10 candidates were selected under BC category on the post of AEE
(Gen.).
As per the merit list of AEE (Gen.) proposed for campus selection, your selection
comes under BC category. Since as per rule only10 posts comes under BC category,
the offer of appointment Patna High Court LPA No.289 of 2014 dt.28-06-2016 issued
under Letter No.1704 dt. 28.09.2011 on the post of Assistant Electrical Engineer
(Gen.) is hereby withdrawn as you rank junior to the last candidate selected in the BC
category."
Aggrieved against the action of the appellant in withdrawing the offer of appointment, the applicant
filed the aforesaid writ application which has since been allowed by the learned Single Bench by the
order impugned, inter alia, on the ground that there were vacancies against the posts for which the
campus selection was made. Therefore, the action of the Board in not offering the appointment to
the applicant is not tenable.
Learned counsel for the appellants points out that the process of campus selection for the post of
Junior Engineer became the subject matter of challenge before a Division Bench of this Court in the
case of Pravin Kumar vs. State of Bihar [2011(4) PLJR 214], decided on 26th July, 2011. Such
process was adversely commented upon.
A perusal of the communication dated 14.10.2011 withdrawing the offer of appointment shows that
the offer for appointment was withdrawn for the reason that there were 10 posts in BC category and
the writ applicant was placed below to the last 10 th candidate selected in BC category. In the
counter affidavit it was explained that there was error in calculating the seats for BC category,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/80934312/ 2
Bihar State Electricity Board & Ors vs Abhishek Ranjan & Anr on 28 June, 2016
therefore, it was decided to be corrected. It was also pointed out that Patna High Court LPA No.289
of 2014 dt.28-06-2016 discrepancies were found in the marks calculated on the basis of
performance up to pre-final year. The same was re-calculated and revised; as a result one Miss
Manisha was selected under BC category. It is also pointed out that only 8 candidates joined under
BC category. Thus, two posts remained vacant. In view of the more requirements of Engineers, the
Board decided to issue advertisement for appointment through open market including the two posts
of BC category.
Learned counsel for the appellants refers to the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case
of Shankarshan Dash vs. Union of India [(1991) 3 SCC 47], and Bihar State Electricity Board vs.
Suresh Prasad [2004 (2) SCC 681]. Learned counsel also refers to a Division Bench judgment of this
Court in the case of Subodh Kumar vs. State of Bihar [2012(2) PLJR 647], wherein in fact the
learned Single Judge was a member of the Bench. In Shankarshan Dash's case (supra), the Court
held to the following effect :-
" 7. It is not correct to say that if a number of vacancies are notified for appointment
and adequate number of candidates are found fit, the successful candidates acquire
an indefeasible right to be appointed which cannot be legitimately denied. Ordinarily
the notification merely amounts to an invitation to qualified candidates to apply for
recruitment and on their selection they do not acquire any right to the post. Unless
the relevant recruitment rules so indicate, the State is under no legal duty to fill up all
or any of the vacancies. However, it does not mean that the State has the licence of
acting in an arbitrary manner. The decision not to fill up the vacancies has to be
taken Patna High Court LPA No.289 of 2014 dt.28-06-2016 bona fide for appropriate
reasons. And if the vacancies or any of them are filled up, the State is bound to
respect the comparative merit of the candidates, as reflected at the recruitment test,
and no discrimination can be permitted. This correct position has been consistently
followed by this Court, and we do not find any discordant note in the decisions in
State of Haryana v. Subhash Chander Marwaha, (1974) 1 SCR : (AIR 1973 SC 2216),
Miss Neelima Shangla v.State of Haryana, (1986) 4 SCC 268 : (AIR 1987 SC 169), or
Jitendra Kuamr v State of Punjab, (1985) 1 SCR 899 :
(AIR 1984 SC 1850).
8. ......................... In this background it was observed that it is, of course, open to the
Government not to fill up all the vacancies for a valid reason, but the selection cannot
be arbitrarily restricted to a few candidates notwithstanding the number of vacancies
and the availability of qualified candidates; and there must be a conscious application
of mind by the Government and the High Court before the number of persons
selected for appointment is restricted. The fact that it was not for the Public Service
Commission to a take a decision in this regard was emphasized in this judgment.
None of these decisions, therefore, supports the appellant".

In Suresh Prasad's case (supra), the Court found that there is no rule mandating the Board to
prepare a waiting list in addition to the panel for the purpose of appointment. Therefore, there
cannot be any direction only for the reason that the candidate was duly selected.
A Division Bench of this Court in the case of Subodh Kumar vs. State of Bihar [2012 (2) PLJR 647)
referring the judgment of this Court in Bihar State Electricity Board vs. Suresh Prasad.(supra),
observed in paragraph -8 as follows:-
"8. In the matter of Bihar State Electricity Board (supra), in similar Patna High Court
LPA No.289 of 2014 dt.28-06-2016 circumstances the Hon'ble Court held that in the
absence of statutory rule to the contrary, the employer was not bound to offer the
unfilled vacancies to the candidates next below the candidates in the merit list. The
Hon'ble Court also considered the above-referred judgment in the matter of Jai
Narain Ram (supra) and has distinguished the same on the ground that the
respondents therein had conceded before the Court that the reserved post could be
filled up by the candidates of reserved categories alone."
On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent-writ applicant refers to the judgments of the
Supreme Court in the cases of R S Mittal vs. Union of India [1995 Supp(2) SCC 230] and Manoj
Manu vs. Union of India [2013(12) SCC 171] as well as Division Bench Judgment of this Court
reported as Ashutosh Kumar Vinayak vs. State of Bihar [2000 (3) PLJR 495], to contend that the
State is bound to offer appointment to the candidates who are in the select list.
We have heard learned counsel for the parties and found that the order of the learned Single Bench
is not sustainable.
In Shankarshan Dash's case, following the case of State of Haryana vs. Subhash Chaner Marwaha
(AIR 1973 SC 2216), the Supreme Court observed that merely because the name of a candidate in the
select list does not give him right of appointment but the State Government must record reason as to
why the appointment is not to be offered. In the present case, the reasons have been recorded in the
letter withdrawing the offer of appointment that the name of the writ Patna High Court LPA No.289
of 2014 dt.28-06-2016 applicant is junior to the candidates relating to the available vacancies. Still
further, in the counter affidavit it has been averred that there are large number of vacancies of
Assistant Engineer; therefore, the existing vacancies in the campus selection process have been
included to be filled up by direct recruitment. Even the process of campus selection has been
adversely commented upon in another judgment of this Court in the case of Pravin Kumar (supra).
Therefore, the action of the appellant in withdrawing the letter of appointment issued to the writ
applicant cannot be said to be unjustified or illegal as it is for the employer not to offer appointment
to a candidate but for a good and valid reason. The valid reason is that the vacant posts should be
filled up through open advertisement rather than from the select list prepared on the basis of
campus interview.
The judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of R S Mittal (supra), is to the effect that
although a person on the select panel has no vested right to be appointed to the post for which he
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/80934312/ 4
Bihar State Electricity Board & Ors vs Abhishek Ranjan & Anr on 28 June, 2016
has been selected, but denial of appointment to a selected candidate without a proper reason is
unjustified. Since the reasons are forthcoming in the present case, therefore, the said judgment does
not help the writ applicant in any manner. Similarly in the case of Manoj Manu (supra), it has been
held that it is always open to the Government not to fill up all the vacancies but there should be valid
Patna High Court LPA No.289 of 2014 dt.28-06-2016 reasons for adopting such action.
The attention of the Division Bench in the case of Ashutosh Kumar Vinayak (supra) was not drawn
to the Supreme Court judgments in the cases of Subhash Chander Marwaha (supra) and
Shankarshan Das (supra), which have laid down the principles contrary which have been laid down
by the Division Bench in Vinayak's case.
In view thereof, we find that the order of the learned Single Bench directing the appellant-Board to
offer appointment to the writ applicant cannot be sustained. Consequently, the present appeal is
allowed. The order dated 10th/12th April, 2013 passed by the learned Single Bench in CWJC No.
8625 of 2012, is set aside and the writ application is dismissed.
