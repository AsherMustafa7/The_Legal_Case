K Kuppuraj vs J. Thrilokamurthy on 5 October, 2020
Crl.A.No.25017/2018 and acquit the petitioner from the
offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I.Act.
This criminal revision petition coming on for Orders,
this day, the Court through video conference made the
following:
ORDER
Heard learned counsel for petitioner. Perused records.
2. Petitioner is before this Court under Section 397 of Cr.P.C. challenging the concurrent judgments
rendered by the courts below convicting the petitioner under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments
Act and sentencing to pay fine of Rs.10,50,000/- and in default to undergo simple imprisonment for
three months.
3. The contention of the learned counsel for petitioner is that the complainant has failed to prove his
capacity to pay huge sum of Rs.10,00,000/- to the petitioner/accused. The plea taken up by the
complainant that he had sold his two pieces of land in the year 2005 and after seven years of the
said sale he had lent Rs.10,00,000/- to the petitioner/accused, could not have been believed by the
courts below, without there being cogent proof in support of the said plea. Further, the learned
counsel pointed out that the trial Court failed to provide adequate opportunity to the
petitioner/accused to substantiate his defence. The application filed by the petitioner/accused under
Section 91 of Cr.P.C. to summon the records from the bank to show that at relevant time the
complainant was not in possession of such huge amount, has been rejected by the trial Court; as a
result, there was no proper opportunity to the petitioner/accused to substantiate his defence.
Further he contends that the trial Court has also failed to appreciate the defence taken up by the
petitioner in proper perspective. As such, there is miscarriage of justice and hence seeks to interfere
in the impugned judgments.
4. On considering the submissions urged by learned counsel for petitioner and on going through the
findings recorded by the courts below, I am unable to accept the submission advanced by the
learned counsel for petitioner. Insofar as the capacity of the complainant to advance hand loan of
Rs.10,00,000/- to the petitioner/accused is concerned, the complainant has produced two Sale
deeds at Ex.P9 and Ex.P10 and has deposed on oath that after discharging the loan due by him, the
remaining amount was paid to the petitioner/accused. This probable explanation has not been
rebutted or falsified in the cross-examination. Even otherwise, in view of the presumption attached
to the cheque, under Section 139 of N.I.Act, burden is on the petitioner/accused to show that he has
not received any consideration from the complainant in respect of the cheque alleged to have been
issued by him. The contention set up by the petitioner/accused that he had issued the said cheque to
one Anitha, adopted daughter of Sri. Lakshman Gowda from whom he borrowed a sum of
Rs.50,000/- has not been substantiated or probablised to any extent. The aforesaid Anitha is not
examined before the Court. No material has been produced to show that at any point of time,
petitioner/accused has borrowed Rs.50,000/- from Sri. Lakshman Gowda. There is also nothing on
record to show that when the demand has been made by the complainant for Rs.10,00,000/-,
accused has taken any action against the aforesaid Anitha for the alleged misuse of the cheque by

her. All these circumstances, therefore go to show that only to escape from the liability arising on
account of dishonour of the cheque, petitioner/accused has come up with a lame excuse, which has
been rightly disbelieved by the trial Court.
5. This Court in exercise of power under Section 397 of Cr.P.C. cannot re-appreciate the evidence
and arrive at a different conclusion, even if different view is possible from the evidence. The
jurisdiction under Section 397 of Cr.P.C. could be exercised only when the decision under challenge
is found grossly erroneous, non-compliance with the provisions of law; finding of fact affecting the
decision is not based on evidence; non-consideration of the material evidence and that the lower
court has exercised the discretion arbitrarily or perversely and acted in excess of its jurisdiction or
abused its power resulting in failure of justice. No such errors or illegalities are found in the
impugned order.
6. On going through the material on record and the contentions urged by the learned counsel for
petitioner, I do not find any error or infirmity in the impugned judgments either in the matter of
appreciating the evidence or in the findings recorded by the courts below. Even the sentence
awarded by the trial Court does not call for any interference. As a result, I do not find any good
ground to admit the petition.
Hence, criminal petition is dismissed at the admission stage.
