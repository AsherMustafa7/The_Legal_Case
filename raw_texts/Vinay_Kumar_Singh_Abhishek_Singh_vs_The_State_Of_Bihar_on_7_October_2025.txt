2/8
3. The prosecution story, in brief, is that respondent
no. 2/ informant submitted her written statement before the SHO
of Mahua Police Station, Vaishali stating therein that on
25.08.2020
informant's son/ Sujit Kumar and Dharmendra Paswan were passing through the road situated in
front of informant's house. It is alleged that appellant no. 2/ Ravi Kumar came on road from north
side in front of gate of Ganaur Paswan and pointed pistol on ear-pit of informant's son/ Sujit Kumar
and while abusing by calling his caste name appellant no. 2 threatened the informant's son to be
killed. Thereafter, informant's son raised alarm upon which nearby people began to assemble there.
Thereafter, appellant no. 2 fled away. It is further alleged that before reaching the informant and her
husband at the place of occurrence, the appellant no. 2 had fled away. It is further alleged that when
appellant no. 1/ Vinay Kumar Singh @ Abhishek Singh was informed on phone regarding the
conduct of his son, he came there and made abusive language indicating caste name and also
assaulted the informant's husband. It is further alleged that appellant no. 2 and 10-12 unknown
persons armed with weapon came there and began to assault and threatened to kill and also abused
by calling caste name. It is further alleged that appellant no. 1 Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ)
No.459 of 2024 dt.07-10-2025 assaulted the informant's elder son by means of lathi due to which he
sustained fracture injury on his hand. It is apprehended by the informant that if any incident takes
place against the informant and her family members, it would be presumed that appellants might
have committed the said occurrence.
4. On the basis of said written statement, Mahua P.S. Case No. 490 of 2020 has been registered for
the offences punishable under Sections 341, 323, 325, 506, 504, 34 of the IPC and Section 3(i)(r)(s)
of SC/ST Act.
5. Learned counsel for the appellants has submitted that appellants, who are father and son, are
innocent and have committed no offence as alleged in the F.I.R. Learned counsel further submits
that appellant no. 1 is Government Prakhand Teacher in Utkarmik Higher School, Supaul and
appellant no. 2 is working in Delhi in a private firm. He further submits that prior to the present
case, appellant no. 1 lodged Mahua P.S. Case No. 489 of 2020 under Sections 341, 323, 353, 379,
427, 385, 504, 34 of the IPC against the informant's husband and her two sons and the present case
is nothing but counter blast of said Mahua P.S. Case No. 489 of 2020. He further submits that
alleged occurrence has not taken place in public place and hence, in the light of ingredients of SC/ST
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/171018729/ 2
Vinay Kumar Singh @ Abhishek Singh vs The State Of Bihar on 7 October, 2025
Act, no offence is Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.459 of 2024 dt.07-10-2025 made out against
the appellants. Learned counsel further submits that there is two days delay in lodging the FIR as
the alleged occurrence took place on 25.08.2020 and FIR has been lodged on 27.08.2020 and no
plausible explanation has been given regarding the said delay. He further submits that the present
case has been lodged by the informant just to misuse the privilege of SC/ST Act. He further
submitted that investigation conducted by the police is faulty and charge sheet has been submitted
under the provision of SC/ST Act just to implicate the appellants. He further submitted that
informant's son has not sustained any injury which falsifies the allegation made in the FIR. Learned
counsel further submits that without application of mind, the concerned court accepted the charge
sheet in toto and took cognizance under Sections 341, 323, 325, 504, 506, 34 of the IPC and Section
3(i)(r)(s) of SC/ST Act against the appellants without having any specific material against them. In
the light of aforesaid fact, order passed by the concerned court is not justified and legal and same is
fit to be set aside.
6. Learned Special Public Prosecutor for the State and learned counsel for the respondent no. 2
submitted that appellants and informant are resident of same village and appellants are well aware
of the fact as to which caste the Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.459 of 2024 dt.07-10-2025
informant and her family members belong to. Learned counsels further submitted that as per
prosecution case, there is allegation against appellant no. 2/ Ravi Kumar that he came on road from
north side in front of gate of Ganaur Paswan and pointed pistol on ear-pit of informant's son and
used abusive language indicating caste name and also threatened to kill. On raising alarm, people of
nearby came and after having seen the people of nearby, appellant no. 2 fled away. The FIR clearly
indicates that the occurrence took place on road and other persons were also present at the place of
occurrence which attracts the mandate of SC/ST Act. There is allegation against appellant no. 1 that
he reached at the place of occurrence and used similar abusive language denoting caste name and
also assaulted the informant's husband and her elder son. It is also alleged that appellant no. 2 and
10-12 unknown persons armed with weapon again came there and used abusive language indicating
caste name and began to assault. Learned counsels further submitted that the accusation as alleged
in the FIR clearly reflects that occurrence took place in public gaze and hence, contention of learned
counsel for the appellants is neither tenable nor sustainable in the light of the accusation made in
the FIR. Learned counsels further submitted that F.I.R. has been lodged Patna High Court CR. APP
(SJ) No.459 of 2024 dt.07-10-2025 under Sections 341, 323, 325, 506, 504, 34 of the IPC and
Section 3(i)(r)(s) of SC/ST Act. Learned counsels further submitted that the investigating officer has
conducted investigation on all points as alleged in the FIR and after completion of investigation
submitted charge sheet under Sections 341, 323, 325, 504, 506, 34 of the IPC and Section 3(i)(r)(s)
of SC/ST Act. He further submits that the learned trial court has found that sufficient material is
available against the appellants and concerned court took cognizance against the appellants under
Sections 341, 323, 325, 504, 506, 34 of the IPC and Section 3(i)(r)(s) of SC/ST Act on the basis of,
prima facie, material available on record. In this way, the trial court has applied its judicial mind
and after going through all the material available on record, the court has passed the reasoned order
and hence, no interference is needed.
7. After hearing the parties concerned as well as material available on record, it is crystal clear that
contention of appellant's counsel is neither tenable nor sustainable in the light of verbatim of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/171018729/ 3
Vinay Kumar Singh @ Abhishek Singh vs The State Of Bihar on 7 October, 2025
informant, who has specifically stated that appellants assaulted the informant's husband and her
son and also used abusive language indicating caste name. The contention of learned counsel for the
State as well as learned Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.459 of 2024 dt.07-10-2025 counsel for
the informant is quite relevant that as per accusation made in the FIR, the occurrence took place in
public gaze. The Investigating Officer has conducted investigation on all points and after completion
of investigation submitted charge sheet under Sections 341, 323, 325, 504, 506, 34 of the IPC and
Section 3(i)(r)(s) of SC/ST Act.
8. It is necessary to cite decision rendered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Sonu Gupta
vs. Deepak Gupta and Others reported in (2015) 3 SCC 424 in which at para 8 it has been held as
follows:-
'8. At the stage of cognizance and summoning the Magistrate is required to apply his
judicial mind only with a view to take cognizance of the offence, or, in other words, to
find out whether a prima facie case has been made out for summoning the accused
persons. At this stage, the learned Magistrate is not required to consider the defence
version or materials or arguments nor is he required to evaluate the merits of the
materials or evidence of the complainant, because the Magistrate must not undertake
the exercise to find out at this stage whether the materials will lead to conviction or
not.'
9. From perusal of the order dated 23.05.2022 passed by Special Judge, SC/ST, Vaishali at Hajipur
in connection with Mahua P.S. Case No. 490 of 2020, SC/ST G.R. No. 169 of 2020, it appears that
order has been passed with due application of mind on the basis of case diary and column 11 of
Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.459 of 2024 dt.07-10-2025 the charge-sheet where name of
appellants have been mentioned. In the light of aforesaid fact, the court has found that a prima facie
case is made out against the appellants.
10. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and also that a prima facie case has been
found against the appellants having regard to the accusations made in the First Information Report
and the material available on the record, this court is not inclined to interfere with the impugned
order dated 23.05.2022.
11. Keeping in view all the aspects and discussions made above, I find no reason to differ from the
finding of the trial court.
12. Accordingly, the present appeal is dismissed at the stage of admission itself.
