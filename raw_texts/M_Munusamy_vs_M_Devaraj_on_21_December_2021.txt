M.Munusamy vs M.Devaraj on 21 December, 2021
of 2010, on the file of the learned Subordinate Judge, Vellore, reversing the common judgment and
decree dated 08.06.2010 passed in O.S.Nos.776 and 744 of 2009 on the file of the learned District
Munsif, Katpadi.
2. During the pendency of these appeals, the respondent in S.A.No.1243 of 2011 viz., M.Devaraj,
filed an application in CMP No.8796 of 2020 under Order 41 Rule 27(a) of Code of Civil Procedure,
praying to receive the additional documents enclosed along with the petition, as additional evidence.
Since the said application is filed in connection with these appeals, the same is also disposed of by
the following common judgment.
3. The laconic averments made in the plaint in O.S.No.273 of 2009, [re-numbered as O.S.No.744 of
2009], are as follows:
(i) The plaintiffs/appellants herein viz., Munuswamy and Devandran are brothers.
The plaintiffs and the defendant/respondent herein-Devaraj, were residing in the
same street. The plaintiffs are the absolute owners of the 'A' schedule property which
is a vacant site, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis S.A.Nos.1242 & 1243 of 2011
measuring about 896 sq.ft. They purchased the same on 13.07.1998 from one
T.P.Anandhan for a sum of Rs.50,000/- vide a registered sale deed, bearing
Document No.2720 of 1998. After made purchase, the plaintiffs have put up a shop
and hut and obtained an electricity connection in S.C.No.201-011-736 in the name of
the 1st plaintiff.
(ii) The plaintiffs are uneducated persons. While at the time they are in need of
money, the 1st plaintiff had told to the defendant, that he is looking for a money
lender, who will be willing to lend a sum of Rs.40,000/- on the mortgage at a
reasonable interest. The defendant then offered to lend the sum, stipulating interest
at 18% per annum on a simple mortgage of the 'A' Schedule mentioned property. The
defendant had told the plaintiffs that he had fixed the date of 21.07.2008 for
registering the mortgage deed and would get the document ready by then. After
giving assurance for registering the mortgage deed, the defendant instead of
preparing the mortgage deed, clandestinely had prepared the sale deed covering an
extent of 280 sq.ft. morefully described in the 'B' Schedule, which is a part of 'A'
schedule matching the loan amount of Rs.41,500/-.
(iii) After the receipt of Rs.40,000/- as a loan from the defendant, the plaintiffs
affixed their signatures in the document and also obtained
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis S.A.Nos.1242 & 1243 of 2011 their mother's thumb
impression as one of the attesting witness. The defendant had also on the same date,
obtained the signatures of the plaintiffs in some typed stamp papers stating that it
was only an agreement to mortgage, required to be submitted to the Registrar's
office.

M.Munusamy vs M.Devaraj on 21 December, 2021
(iv) The plaintiffs believed that the contents of the documents genuinely revealed a
mortgage and not doubted the defendant. Since the transaction was only a mortgage,
the original deed was only with them.
The plaintiffs continued to be in possession and enjoyment of the 'A' schedule property. The hut and
the shop are located only in the 'B' schedule property, which is said to have been conveyed to the
defendant.
(v) After the registration, when at the time, the plaintiffs wanted to redeem the mortgaged property,
in the middle of 'Chithirai' [1st week of May] 2009, they approached the defendant with money and
were shocked to hear from him that the property was already sold to him, for good and valid
consideration and produced the alleged sale deed executed by the plaintiffs in favour of him. After
knowing the same, the plaintiffs applied the certified copy of the said sale deed and found that the
'B' schedule was carved out from 'A' schedule and was the subject matter of the sale.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis S.A.Nos.1242 & 1243 of 2011
(vi) After the plaintiffs came to know about the sale, the Defendant, his men and agents attempted
to interfere with the plaintiffs' peaceful possession and are trying to oust them from the schedule of
properties by using force. Hence, the plaintiffs have filed the suit praying to cancel the sale deed
dated 21.07.2008, fraudulently obtained by the defendant; for granting of permanent injunction
restraining the defendant from creating any encumbrance in the 'B' Schedule property; for
consequential injunction restraining the defendant, his men and agents from interfering with their
peaceful possession and enjoyment of the 'B' schedule property and for costs.
4. The case of the sole defendant in O.S.No.744 of 2009, as averred in the written statement, is as
follows:
(i) The allegation levelled against the defendant saying that the defendant has
fraudulently obtained a sale deed is not correct. The plaint averment that while at the
time, the plaintiffs were looking for a money lender, who would be willing to lend
them a sum of Rs.40,000/- on the mortgage of the above property on reasonable
interest, is a false one.
Previous to the registration of sale deed, the defendant never said that, he
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis S.A.Nos.1242 & 1243 of 2011 would incur the expenses borne out
of mortgage. The plaintiffs never received a sum of Rs.40,000/- as a loan amount. They received the
said sum as a sale consideration. Now, both the plaintiffs have joined together with an ulterior
motive to cheat the defendant. The defendant denies the allegation that the plaintiffs continued to
be in possession and enjoyment of the 'A' schedule property and it is admitted by the defendant that
the hut and shop are located only in the B schedule of the property.
(ii) It is not correct to say that the plaintiffs knew the transaction only when they went to redeem the
mortgage. The plaintiffs with their full consent and knowing fully well and after getting the sale
consideration, then only they executed the legally valid sale deed in favour of the defendant. Now
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193410613/ 3
M.Munusamy vs M.Devaraj on 21 December, 2021
the defendant alone is in the possession and enjoyment of the B schedule property.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis S.A.Nos.1242 & 1243 of 2011
(iii) The Executive Officer, Katpadi Panchayat by his proceedings dated 13.11.2008 granted
permission to construct a new house in the suit property. The suit filed by the plaintiffs is not
maintainable. The same does not have any cause of action and hence, liable to be dismissed.
5. The case of the plaintiff in O.S.No.776 of 2009, is as follows:
(i) The plaintiff-M.Devaraj, has purchased the suit schedule property under the
registered sale deed dated 21.07.2008 for a valid consideration. From the date of
purchase, he is in the possession and enjoyment of the suit property. The defendants
are having the land on the north of the suit property. Now, the defendants, for the
past one week are claiming unfounded right over the suit property. The plaintiff
states that the plaintiff had purchased the suit property with the specific boundaries
and measurements. The defendants are not having any right over the purchased
property.
(ii) Taking advantage that the plaintiff is not having any support, the defendants are
trying to encroach upon the suit property. Hence, the present suit has been filed for
the relief of injunction, restraining the defendants, their servants, agents, etc., from
in any manner interfering with https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis S.A.Nos.1242 &
1243 of 2011 the plaintiff's peaceful possession and enjoyment of the suit property.
6. The case of the defendants, as averred in the written statement filed in O.S.No.776 of 2009, is as
follows:
(i) The plaintiff has burked the earlier suit filed by these defendants for the relief to
cancel the sale deed dated 21.07.2008.
Without asking the relief of declaration, filing the suit for a bare injunction is not maintainable. The
water tax receipts produced by the plaintiff is not pertaining to the connection alleged to be found in
the suit property. The revenue records relied on by the plaintiff does not confer any right to the
plaintiff. Without proper enquiry, the revenue authorities issued a Chitta in the name of plaintiff.
The plaintiff is not at all in possession at any point of time. Hence the suit filed by the plaintiff is
liable for dismissal.
7. Since, both the suits relate to the same property and the party to the proceedings are also one and
the same, the trial Court after framing necessary issues tried the suits jointly. The 1st
plaintiff-Munusamy and the 2nd plaintiff-Devendiran, in O.S.No.744 of 2009 were examined as
PW1 and PW2 respectively. Apart from that, one Papammal gave evidence as
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis S.A.Nos.1242 & 1243 of 2011 PW3 and three documents were
exhibited on their side as Ex.A1 to Ex.A3. Similarly, defendant-Devaraj in O.S.No.744 of 2009 who
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193410613/ 4
M.Munusamy vs M.Devaraj on 21 December, 2021
is the plaintiff in O.S.No.766 of 2009, was examined as DW1. He examined two more witnesses as
DW2 and DW3 and marked eight documents as Ex.B1 to Ex.B8 on his side. Apart from those
documents, copy of the ration card pertains to the plaintiffs in O.S.No.744 of 2009 was marked as
Ex.X1.
8. After elaborate trial, the learned District Munsif, Katpadi, came to the conclusion that the suit
filed in O.S.No.744 of 2009 was proved and while granting the decree for cancelling the sale deed
dated 21.07.2008, granted permanent injunction in respect to B schedule property. Further, he
dismissed the suit filed in O.S.No.776 of 2009.
9. Aggrieved over the same, M.Devaraj, sole defendant in O.S.No.744 of 2009 and sole plaintiff in
O.S.No.776 of 2009, preferred separate appeals in A.S.No.47 of 2010 and A.S.No.50 of 2010. The
learned Subordinate Judge, Vellore, by common judgment and decree dated 30.06.2011, reversed
the findings of the learned District Munsif, Katpadi and allowed both the appeals.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis S.A.Nos.1242 & 1243 of 2011
10. Feeling aggrieved over the same, the respondents in the above referred two appeals viz.,
A.S.Nos.47 and 50 of 2010, have preferred these two second appeals. When the Second Appeals
were taken up for admission, this Court formulated the following substantial questions of law.
“(i) Whether the learned Appellate Court is justified in reversing the findings of the trial Court by
merely applying Sec.92 of the Indian Evidence Act and coming to the conclusion that the appellants
cannot give a contrary evidence against the document sale deed (Ex.A3 = Ex.B1) to claim it to be a
mortgage deed overlooking the provisions of Sec.13 of the Indian Contract Act which mandates that
a transaction or an instrument is valid only if there is a consenus ad idem?
(ii) Is the learned Appellate Court justified in granting a relief of injunction in favour of the
respondent more particularly when he has not come to Court with clean hands which is exposited
through marking of Ex.B2 to B8 claiming to be that of the suit property, when it is actually not?
(iii) When a cloud is created with respect to B Schedule property, is the learned Appellate Court
justified in granting a relief of permanent injunction without there being a prayer for declaration in
O.S.No.776/2009?”
11. When these appeals are pending for consideration, the sole respondent-Devaraj in these appeals,
filed an application in CMP No.8796 of 2020 under Order 41 Rule 27(a) of Code of Civil Procedure,
through which he prayed to receive the petition mentioned sale agreement dated
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis S.A.Nos.1242 & 1243 of 2011 18.07.2008 and the legal notice
dated 20.11.2008 as additional evidence of the respondent in SA No.1243 of 2011.
12. In the affidavit filed in support of the above petition, it is stated as follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193410613/ 5
M.Munusamy vs M.Devaraj on 21 December, 2021
(i) Prior to filing of the suit, the respondents in the Civil Miscellaneous Petition viz.,
M.Munusamy and M.Devendran, executed a sale agreement dated 18.07.2008 in
favour of Devaraj's wife Krishna Gandhi, agreeing to sell the suit property for a valid
consideration. Then only, on 21.07.2008 vide Document No.7380 of 2008, they
executed the sale deed. Before filing the suit in O.S.No.744 of 2009, the respondents
issued a legal notice dated 20.11.2008 through their lower Court counsel viz.,
A.Srinivasan, stating that they have sold only 250 sq.ft. and not 280 sq.ft. Hence, the
said notice would clearly prove that the respondents have executed the sale deed and
not the mortgage deed as alleged.
(ii) During the time of filing the suit, the said documents were misplaced and only at
the time, the appeal was pending before the lower appellate Court, he filed a petition
in I.A.No.73 of 2011 in AS No.50 of 2010, praying to receive those documents as
additional evidence. The https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis S.A.Nos.1242 & 1243 of
2011 counsel on record of the respondents in the first appeal, who issued legal notice
adduced his evidence during the time of enquiry in I.A.No.73 of 2011. In view of the
rule that the counsel on record cannot give evidence in the same case, the application
filed in I.A.No.73 of 2011 was dismissed on 30.06.2011. Since the appeal is decided in
his favour, no revision is filed against the order passed in the interlocutory
application. Now, the said documents are the vital evidence to prove his case. Hence,
it would be necessary to allow this application.
13. The respondents/appellants have filed a courter affidavit to the said Civil Miscellaneous Petition,
wherein they have stated as follows:
The documents sought to be marked were not the subject matter before the Courts
below and are not connected to decide the dispute in the present litigation. The
petitioner has not pleaded about the alleged sale agreement dated 18.07.2008 or
about the alleged legal notice dated 20.11.2008 in his written statement. Though he
had knowledge about the documents that are sought to be marked, has not pleaded
the same at the first instance. After dismissing the application filed in I.A.No.73 of
2011, the petitioner has not challenged the said order and the same has attained
finality. Therefore, the present application is barred under the principles of
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis S.A.Nos.1242 & 1243 of 2011 res judicata. Hence, it
is necessary to dismiss the application filed under Order 41 Rule 27(a) of CPC.
14. Heard Mr.S.Mukunth, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants and
Mr.B.Sundarapandian, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent and perused the
materials available on record.
15. For the purpose of proper identification of the parties, hereinafter, the plaintiffs in O.S.No.744 of
2009 have been referred to as the 'plaintiffs' and the plaintiff in O.S.No.776 of 2009 has been
referred to as the 'defendant'.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193410613/ 6
M.Munusamy vs M.Devaraj on 21 December, 2021
16. Admittedly, the suit 'B' schedule property is the part of 'A' schedule property. Vide registered sale
deed [Ex.A1] dated 13.07.1998, the plaintiffs purchased the 'A' schedule property. In this occasion, it
is the case of the plaintiffs that on 21.07.2008, the defendant-Devaraj, after making a false
representation and by committing fraud, registered the sale deed dated 21.07.2008.
17. It is the further case of the plaintiffs that believing the words of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
S.A.Nos.1242 & 1243 of 2011 the defendant that the document dated 21.07.2008 is only a mortgage
deed for the loan of Rs.40,000/-, they went to the Sub Registrar's office and affixed their signatures.
Thereafter, in May 2009, while at the time the plaintiffs attempted to redeem the mortgage, they
came to know that the document dated 21.07.2008 (Ex.A3), is a sale deed executed by them for
selling the 'B' schedule property to the defendant.
18. It is the contention of the plaintiffs that the documents exhibited on the side of the defendant
viz., Ex.B2 to Ex.B8 would not prove his possession and the same are sufficient to accept the case of
the plaintiffs that the defendant fraudulently obtained a sale deed from the plaintiff.
19. The trial Court while at the time of disposing the suits, decided the issue positively in favour of
the plaintiffs that the defendant has not proved his possession and obviously, the possession of the
'B' schedule property is with the plaintiffs and therefore, the false claim made by the defendant
would be sufficient to accept the case of the plaintiffs.
20. In respect to the said findings, the lower appellate Court while at the time of disposing the
appeals, by following Section 92 of the Indian https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis S.A.Nos.1242 &
1243 of 2011 Evidence Act, reversed the findings arrived at by the trial Court.
21. In general, if a plea of fraud is taken by a party, the burden of proof is on his shoulder, to show
that the alleged document was executed in a fraudulent manner. At this juncture, it is useful and
necessary to see the judgment of this Court in M.Ramalingam (Died) and others Vs.
V.Subramanyam (Died) and others, reported in 2003 (1) MLJ 694, wherein, it is held as follows:
"10 . . . . When the defendant came with a plea stating that the intention of the parties
was only to treat the same as a loan transaction, and it was never intended to be acted
upon, which is inconsistent with the terms of the document, a duty is cast upon the
defendant to strictly prove that it was a different transaction altogether, and what
was recorded in the document was intended to be of no consequence whatsoever. No
doubt, the defendant who came with such a plea, can well adduce evidence to show
that Ex.A-1 agreement though executed by him, was never intended to be operated as
an agreement for sale, but only for a loan transaction, which was not recorded in the
document.”
22. Now applying the principles set out in the above referred judgment to the case in hand, in order
to prove their stand, except the oral evidence given by plaintiffs (PW1 & PW2) and one
Pappammal(PW3), https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis S.A.Nos.1242 & 1243 of 2011 nothing was
shown on their side, to prove the fraudulent act committed by the defendant. Before the trial Court,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/193410613/ 7
M.Munusamy vs M.Devaraj on 21 December, 2021
the document pertains to the purchase made by the plaintiffs in respect to the 'A' schedule property
was marked as Ex.A1. Further, the E.B. Receipts that stand in the name of the 1st plaintiff and the
xerox copy of the sale deed pertains to the 'B' schedule property, which stands in the name of the
defendant were marked as Ex.A2 and Ex.A3 respectively. Since Ex.A1 and A2 are not related to the
allegations levelled by the plaintiffs against the defendant, referring to those documents, is not
useful to decide the issue in these appeals. The crucial aspect which is necessary to decide these
appeals is that, the evidence given by PW1 to PW3 is nothing but against the recital found in Ex.A3.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis S.A.Nos.1242 & 1243 of 2011
23. The lower appellate Court had clearly held that in view of Section 92 of the Indian Evidence Act,
the evidence given by PW1 to PW3, cannot be entertained for accepting the case of the plaintiffs.
Now, on going through the recitals found in Ex.A3, no doubt, in view of the said recitals, the
defendant purchased the suit 'B' schedule property from the plaintiff. Therefore, in this occasion, it
would be necessary to see the implication of Section 92 of Indian Evidence Act, in this case.
24. Section 92 of the Indian Evidence Act, reads as follows:
“Exclusion of evidence or oral agreement When the terms of any such contract, grant
or other disposition of property, or any matter required by law to be reduced to the
form of a document, have been proved according to the last section, no evidence of
any oral agreement or statement shall be admitted, as between the parties to any
such instrument or their representatives in interest, for the purpose of contradicting,
varying, adding to, or subtracting from, its terms:
Proviso(4) The existence of any distinct subsequent oral agreement to rescind or
modify any such contract, grant or disposition of property, may be proved, except in
cases in which such contract, grant or disposition of property is by law required to be
in writing, or has been registered according to the law in force for the time being as to
the registration of documents.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis S.A.Nos.1242 & 1243 of 2011
25. Accordingly, Section 92 of the Indian Evidence Act, contemplates that when terms of any
contract, grant or other disposition of the property or any matter required by law to be reduced in
the form of written documents have been proved, no evidence of an oral agreement or statement is
permissible for the purpose of contradicting, varying, adding or subtracting the said written
document.
26. The pith and substance of sub-clause 4 of Section 92 of Indian Evidence Act is, if a party has
entered into a contract which is not required to be reduced in writing, but such a contract has been
reduced in writing or it is oral, in such situation, it is always open to the parties to the contract to
modify its terms and even substitute a new by oral contract and it can be substituted by parole
evidence.

M.Munusamy vs M.Devaraj on 21 December, 2021
27. Therefore, in the said circumstances, it is necessary to peruse the impugned sale deed dated
21.07.2008, in terms of Section 92 of the Indian Evidence Act, which is extracted hereunder.

28. Hence, in view of the same, it is needless to say that oral evidence given by PW1 to PW3, cannot
be taken into account for considering the case of the plaintiffs. The lower appellate Court has also
taken the same view as the plaintiffs have not proved their case by producing the material evidence.

M.Munusamy vs M.Devaraj on 21 December, 2021
29. It is the submission of the plaintiffs/appellants herein that the exhibits marked on the side of the
defendant, would show that there was a house situated in the 'B' schedule property in the name of
the defendant, on the other hand, the recital found in the sale deed dated 21.07.2008, is in respect to
the vacant site and therefore, it is for the defendant who prayed the relief of permanent injunction
against the plaintiffs, to prove his case. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis S.A.Nos.1242 & 1243 of
2011
30. Now, on considering the said submission with the relevant records, before the trial Court, the
Property Tax Payment Card, Katpadi Municipality, was marked as Ex.B2. In the said document, the
Door number was marked as 56. Though, it would appear as 56, there was some correction in
respect to the word '6'. In otherwise, the said document was executed on 08.08.2008 i.e., after the
completion of sale. Ex.B3 & Ex.B6, are also similar documents pertaining to the Water Tax paid by
the defendant in respect to Door No.56. The entries made in the said document will prove payment
of water tax for the period from from August 2008 to March 2009 to Katpadi Municipality. Ex.B5, is
the copy of the chitta, issued by the Village Administrative Officer, Katpadi, which stands in the
name of both the plaintiffs and the defendant. Ex.B7 and Ex.B8, are the House tax receipts. In the
said receipt, the Door Number has not been mentioned.
31. Before the trial Court, in order to prove his possession, the defendant has produced those
documents and gave evidence as the 'B' schedule property was in his possession. In his cross
examination, he has admitted the lapses found in those documents, now discussed as above.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis S.A.Nos.1242 & 1243 of 2011 Though, it was contended that after
purchase, immediately, he obtained the water connection, being the reason that the House Tax
Receipts produced by the defendant, are not having any Door number, the same cannot be taken
into account that the said documents are material in nature for accepting the possession of the
defendant.
32. However, as rightly pointed out by the learned counsel for the defendant, once the title has been
proved, it should be presumed that the person who proved the title is in the possession of the
disputed property. In this occasion, it is necessary to decide whether the said presumption is
applicable to the present case or not.
33. In this regard, to resolve the said conflict, it would be necessary to see the judgment of our
Hon'ble Apex Court in a case of State of Andhra Pradesh Vs. M/s.Star Bone Mill & Fertiliser Co.
[Civil Appeal No.6690 of 2004] dated 21.02.2013, wherein our Hon'ble Apex Court has held in
respect to the possession and title as follows:
“13. The principle enshrined in Section 110 of the Evidence Act, is based on public
policy with the object of preventing persons from committing breach of peace by
taking law into their own hands, however good their title over the land
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis S.A.Nos.1242 & 1243 of 2011 in question may be. It
is for this purpose, that the provisions of Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963,
Section 145 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, and Sections 154 and 158 of Indian
Penal Code, 1860, were enacted. All the afore- said provisions have the same object.

M.Munusamy vs M.Devaraj on 21 December, 2021
The said presumption is read under Section 114 of the Evidence Act, and applies only
in a case where there is either no proof, or very little proof of ownership on either
side. The maxim “possession follows title” is applicable in cases where proof of actual
possession cannot reasonably be expected, for instance, in the case of waste lands, or
where nothing is known about possession one-way or another. Presumption of title as
a result of possession, can arise only where facts disclose that no title vests in any
party. Possession of the plaintiff is not prima facie wrongful, and title of the plaintiff
is not proved. It certainly does not mean that because a man has title over some land,
he is necessarily in possession of it. It infact means, that if at any time a man with
title was in possession of the said property, the law allows the presumption that such
possession was in continuation of the title vested in him. A person must establish that
he has continued possession of the suit property, while the other side claiming title,
must make out a case of trespass/encroachment etc. Where the apparent title is with
the plaintiffs, it is incumbent upon the defendant, that in order to displace this claim
of apparent title and to establish beneficial title in himself, he must establish by way
of satisfactory evidence, circumstances that favour his version. Even, a revenue
record is not a document of title. It merely raises a presumption in regard to
possession. Presumption of possession and/or continuity thereof, both forward and
backward, can also be raised under Section 110 the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
S.A.Nos.1242 & 1243 of 2011 Evidence Act.”
34. Following the position of law emerged as above, herein also, this Court is in a position to hold
that the defendant is in the possession of the suit schedule property. Therefore, even assuming that
the documents relied on by the defendant are not sufficient to prove his possession, as already
observed, being the reason the title is vested with him, he is entitled to the relief of injunction as
prayed for. The lower appellate Court has also taken the same view and dismissed the appeals.
35. Now coming to CMP No.8796 of 2020, the said application has been filed for receiving two
documents as additional evidence. No doubt, in respect to the same prayer, the petitioner herein has
filed an application before the lower appellate Court under the same provision in IA No.73 of 2011 in
A.S.No.50 of 2010 and the same was dismissed.
36. In respect to the same, the learned counsel for the petitioner/defendant would contend that the
lower appellate Court without assigning any specific reason, dismissed the said application and
therefore, the prayer sought by the petitioner/defendant has to be entertained now.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis S.A.Nos.1242 & 1243 of 2011
37. On considering the said submission with relevant records, it would appear that through the said
application, the petitioner/defendant wants to produce two documents as additional evidence. The
first document is the Sale Agreement dated 18.07.2008, entered into between the
respondents/plaintiffs and the wife of the petitioner/defendant. The second document is the
Lawyer's Notice dated 20.11.2008, issued by the appellants/plaintiffs through their lower Court
counsel viz., A.Srinivasan, stating that they sold only 250 sq.ft and not 280 sq.ft.

M.Munusamy vs M.Devaraj on 21 December, 2021
38. While at the time of disposing the said application, the lower appellate Court has held that since
the counsel who issued the Lawyer's Notice on behalf of the appellants/plaintiffs, has himself filed
the suit, he is not in a position to give evidence in support of the petitioner's case and therefore, the
prayer sought by the petitioner/defendant cannot be granted.
39. It is unfortunate, the said reasoning given by the lower appellate Court is without any merit.
Only because of the reason that the counsel on record, sent the Lawyer's Notice, it cannot be said
that he would necessarily give evidence in this aspect. However, as already stated, when
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis S.A.Nos.1242 & 1243 of 2011 both the appeals filed by the
appellants/plaintiffs, have went against them, the question of receiving the additional evidence does
not arise. Accordingly, in view of the above, the application filed before this Court in CMP No.8796
of 2020, is dismissed.
40. In fine, both the Second Appeals are dismissed. The common judgment and decree dated
30.06.2011 passed by the learned Subordinate Judge, Vellore, in A.S.Nos.47 and 50 of 2010, is
confirmed. No Costs. Consequently, the connected Miscellaneous Petition i.e. M.P.No.1 of 2010, is
closed.
