Sri Venkatesha K N vs Sri Thipregowda on 13 August, 2020
COMMON JUDGMENT
M.F.A.No.5371/2016 has been filed by the claimants, whereas, M.F.A.No.5378/2016 has been filed
by the insurance company against judgment dated 05.04.2016 passed by the Motor Accident Claims
Tribunal. Since, both the appeals arise out of the same accident, they were heard analogously and
are being decided by this common judgment.
2. Facts leading to filing of these appeals briefly stated are that on 13.05.2013 at about 7.00 p.m., the
claimant Venkatesha K.N. was traveling as a pillion rider in motor cycle bearing registration
No.KA-02-HC-8252 from Dimabadahalli to Kodihalli via Iralpod. When the claimant reached near
Sunanada Farm, Kempalanatha Gate, a Tractor bearing registration No. KA-05-T-4788, which was
being driven in a rash and negligent manner by its driver came from the opposite direction and
dashed against the motor cycle of the claimant. As a result of the aforesaid accident, the deceased
fell down and sustained grievous injuries. Thereafter, he was shifted to KIMS Hospital for further
treatment.
3. The claimant thereupon filed a petition under Section 166 of the Act inter alia on the ground that
the accident took place on account of rash and negligent driving of the driver of the tractor. It was
further pleaded that the claimant is a practicing Advocate and used to earn Rs.45,000/- p.m. It was
also pleaded that on account of injuries sustained by him, the claimant was referred to KIMS
hospital where he was admitted as in patient and on 17.05.2013 a surgery was conducted and rod
was installed on the left leg and left hand and the claimant was discharged on 05.06.2013. The
claimant was again admitted in hospital as in patient on 01.07.2013 and second surgery was
conducted on 03.07.2013 and the claimant was discharged on 11.07.2013. Again the claimant was
admitted on 13.06.2015 and third surgery was conducted on 15.06.2015 and the claimant was
discharged on 20.06.2015. The claimant claimed compensation to the tune of Rs.25,00,000/-.
4. The respondent No.1 and 3 did not enter appearance and were proceeded exparte. The
respondent No.2 however, filed the written statement in which averments made in the petition were
denied. It was further pleaded that claimant in collusion with the police authorities have lodged a
false complaint against the tractor in question after a period of one month. However, issuance of
policy in respect of tractor in question was admitted. It was also pleaded that the driver of the
tractor had no valid and effective licence to drive the vehicle.
5. The Claims Tribunal on the basis of the pleadings of the parties, framed the issues and recorded
the evidence. The claimant examined himself as PW1 and Dr.R.Yathish as PW2 and exhibited as
many as 21 documents. The respondent No.2 examined one witness viz., Rajshekar S and exhibited
7 documents. The Claims Tribunal vide impugned judgment dated 05.04.2016 inter alia held that
accident took place on account of rash and negligent driving of the driver of the tractor. It was
further held that the claimant in the aforesaid accident, suffered whole body disability to the extent
of 10% and is entitled to a compensation to the tune of Rs.7,79,000/- along with interest at the rate
of 6% per annum from the date of petition till its realization. Being aggrieved, these appeals have
been filed.

6. Learned counsel for the insurance company submitted that the amount awarded to the claimant
under the head of loss of future income is on the higher side and the driver of the tractor had no
valid driving license and the insurance company could not have been held liable to indemnify the
insured. It is further submitted that the tribunal ought to have appreciated that First Information
Report was lodged after a delay of 33 days and therefore, it was evident that the tractor in question
was falsely implicated in the accident. On the other hand, learned counsel for the claimant while
inviting the attention of this court to the driving licence Ex.R5 submitted that the same was valid for
a period from 31.03.2003 to 31.03.2023 and while referring to Ex.R6 it was pointed out that
unladen weight of the tractor was 1945 Kg and therefore, the same was a light motor vehicle (LMV)
and since, the driver held the LMV licence, he was competent to drive all vehicles of class including
transport vehicles. It is further submitted that since, the claimant was hospitalized and has
undergone three surgeries and had an old mother who lived in a village, the claimant with great
difficulty after discharge from the hospital got the First Information Report lodged and mere delay
in lodging the First Information Report cannot be a ground to doubt claimant's case in genuine
cases. It is further submitted that the tribunal ought to have awarded compensation on account of
loss of income during the period for which the claimant was under treatment and ought to have
appreciated that the claimant remained immobile for a period of nine months and therefore,
amount awarded under the head of pain and suffering and food and nourishment expenses is on the
lower side. It is further submitted that the tribunal has rightly awarded the sum to the claimant
under the head of loss of future income as the claimant has suffered permanent disability.
7. We have considered the submissions made on both the sides and have perused the record. From
perusal of Ex.R5 i.e., the driving licence, it is evident that the driving licence was valid for a period
from 31.03.2003 till 30.03.2023. Under the aforesaid licence, the driver was authorized to drive a
LMV, transport motor vehicle and public service vehicle including a bus. From perusal of Section
2(21) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, it is evident that Light Motor Vehicle means a transport
vehicle or omni bus, the gross vehicle weight of either of which or a motor car or tractor or road
roller the unladen weight of any of which, does not exceed 7,500 kilograms. From perusal of RTO
extract Ex.R6, it is evident that unladen weight of the tractor was 1945 Kilograms. Therefore, the
driver of the tractor who was driving the LMV had a valid driving licence, which is evident from
Ex.R5. In any case, the Supreme Court in case of 'MUKUND DEWANGAN VS. ORIENTAL
INSURANCE COMPANY LIMITED', AIR 2017 SC 3668 has held that the driving holding LMV
licence can drive all vehicles of class including transport vehicle. Therefore, the contention raised on
behalf of the insurance company that the driver of the tractor did not have a valid effective driving
licence need not detain us and the contention that the driver of the tractor did not have an effective
driving licence on the date of accident is repelled. Thus, we hold that the driver of the tractor had a
valid driving licence.
8. The Supreme Court in 'RAVI VS.
BADRINARAYAN AND OTHERS', (2011) 4 SCC 693 has held that delay in lodging the First
Information Report cannot be a ground to doubt the claimants case in genuine cases. It has further
been held that in Indian conditions it is not expected that a person who would rush to police station
after the accident and the treatment of the victim is given priority over lodging of the First

Sri Venkatesha K N vs Sri Thipregowda on 13 August, 2020
Information Report. In the instant case, it is pertinent to note that claimant's mother resides in a
village. The claimant after the accident on 13.05.2013 was hospitalized and was admitted in hospital
and a surgery was performed on 17.05.2013 and he was discharged from the hospital on 05.06.2013.
Thereafter again on 01.07.2013 he was admitted and second surgery was performed on 03.07.2013.
It is pertinent to mention here that claimant has been examined as PW1 and nothing could be
elicited from him in his cross examination with regard to the manner of the accident. Therefore, we
do not find any reason to disbelieve the testimony of the claimant with regard to the manner in
which the accident has taken place and therefore, we hold that merely because there was a delay of
33 days in lodging the First Information Report, it cannot be said that the claim of the claimant is
not genuine.
9. Now we may deal with the question of quantum of compensation. It is pertinent to note that PW1
viz., the claimant in para 7 of his evidence has stated that on account of injuries sustained by him in
the accident he is not able to walk property. Dr.R.Yathish (PW2) in his evidence has stated that the
claimant cannot stand for long duration and has difficulty in climbing stairs and cannot sit crossed
leg. He has assessed the permanent disability sustained by the claimant to the extent of 13% of the
whole body and 40% of the upper left and lower left limb. Thus, undoubtedly, the claimant has lost
his earning capacity as an Advocate and therefore, the tribunal has rightly assessed the permanent
disability to the extent of 10% and taking monthly income of the claimant at Rs.30,000/- has
awarded a sum of Rs.6,12,000/- on account of loss of future income. The aforesaid amount does not
call for any interference in this appeal. It is noteworthy that claimant in para 8 of his evidence has
stated that he has remained bed ridden for nine months and had undergone three surgeries.
However, the tribunal has not awarded any amount to him on account of compensation for the
period of treatment. Therefore, the claimant is awarded a sum of Rs.2,70,000/- as compensation for
the period of treatment taking his income to be Rs.30,000/- per month, as has been found by the
tribunal. In the facts of the case, the amount awarded under the head of pain and suffering is on the
lower side and taking into account the fact that the claimant has undergone three surgeries, we
enhance the same to Rs.75,000/- instead of Rs.25,000/-. Similarly, taking in to account the period
of hospitalization and laid up period, which was for nine months, the amount of Rs.10,000-/-
awarded under the head of food, nourishment and conveyance is on the lower side and the same is
enhanced to Rs.50,000/-. Thus, the claimant is held entitled to an additional sum of Rs.3,60,000/-
as compensation. The aforesaid amount of compensation shall carry interest at the rate of 6% per
annum from the date of filing of the petition till its realization. To the aforesaid extent, the award
passed by the Claims Tribunal is modified. The amount in deposit shall be transmitted to the Claims
Tribunal for disbursement to the claimant.
In view of preceding analysis, M.F.A.No.5371/2016 is partly allowed, whereas M.F.A.No.5378/2016
is dismissed.
