Facts:
2. The petitioner, Charitable Society (Trust) registered under Section 12A of the
Income Tax Act, 1961 (for short, ―the IT Act(cid:130)), namely, ACTION RESEARCH FOR
HEALTH AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, is engaged in the field of
conducting programmes on Health, Women Empowerment, Medicinal Plants, Old
age care and Livelihood etc. 2.1. The Audit Report in Form-10B for the Assessment
Year 2020-21 claiming exemption under Section 12A read with Rule 17B was required
to be filed on or before 15.01.2021 in terms of the Press Release dated 30.12.2020 of
the Government of India, Ministry of Finance Department of Revenue in view of the
challenges faced by the taxpayers in meeting the statutory and regulatory compliance
due to the outbreak of pandemic due to spread of COVID-19 virus. The petitioner
filed the Audit Report in Form 10B prescribed under Rule 17B of the Income Tax
Rules, 1962 (for short, ―IT Rules(cid:130)) on 31.03.2021, thereby there occurred delay of
seventy-six days for the circumstances beyond its control.

Action Research For Health And vs Central Board Of Direct Taxes (Cbdt) on 25 April, 2025
2.2. Pandemic situation prevented many citizen-assessees from complying with the
statutory requirements, which led to promulgation of the Taxation and Other Laws
(Relaxation of Certain Provisions) Ordinance, 2020 (Order 2 of 2020) to provide
certain relaxations related to compliance, such as extension of time limit and waiver
of penalty, in relation to certain specified laws including the IT Act, the Finance Acts,
the Central Excise Act, 1944, the Customs Act, 1962, and the Prohibition of Benami
Property Transactions Act, 1988. The Ordinance provided these relaxations in view of
spread of the coronavirus in India. By virtue of enactment of the Taxation and Other
Laws (Relaxation and Amendment of Certain Provisions) Act, 2020, which has
deemed to have come into force on the 31st day of March, 2020, said Ordinance,
2020 was repealed and action taken thereunder was saved.
2.3. The reason cited by the petitioner for the delay was due to difficulty faced in
movement on account of shutdown clamped by the Government during COVID-19
pandemic.
The normal functioning of the office of the petitioner- Society was affected and irregular attendance
of the staff in the Office, was the cause for the delay in filing the Audit Report in Form 10B. Though
the petitioner- Charitable Society is entitled to claim exemption under Section 12A of the IT Act, the
Department while processing the return of income, such claim of exemption was disallowed on the
ground that the Audit Report was not filed within the period specified under the statute, as a result
of which demand to the tune of Rs.22,01,930/- was raised by issuing intimation dated 30.11.2021
under Section 143 (Annexure-2).
2.4. Citing such bona fide reason preventing the petitioner from filing the Audit Report on or before
15.02.2021, it is stated that the delay of seventy-six days in filing said Audit Report in Form 10B
should have been ignored. Hence, the petitioner on 03.12.2024 filed an application before the
Commissioner of Income Tax (Exemption), Hyderabad-opposite party No.2 under Section 119(2)(b)
of the IT Act with prayer to condone the delay in filing such Audit Report. In furtherance thereof, on
the information being sought for by the Department, vide notice dated 05.12.2024, compliance was
made on 18.12.2024. Nevertheless, the opposite party No.2 without affording opportunity to the
petitioner rejected the application for condonation of delay on 17.02.2025, which is subject-matter
of challenge in the instant writ petition.
Hearing:
3. This matter came up before this Court under the heading ―Fresh Admission(cid:130).
3.1. As short point fell for consideration as to whether reason shown by the petitioner
which prevented it to comply with the statutory requirement within the period
stipulated has been rejected by the Commissioner of Income Tax (Exemptions)
rightfully so that the demand of income tax to the tune of Rs.22,01,930/- under
Section 143 of the IT Act would sustain, on the consent of counsel for both sides, this
matter is disposed of at the stage of ―Fresh Admission(cid:130).

3.2. Accordingly, heard Sri Chitrasen Parida, learned Advocate appearing for the
petitioner and Sri Avinash Kedia, learned Junior Standing Counsel appearing for the
opposite parties.
Rival contentions and submissions:
4. Sri Chitrasen Parida, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submitted that
the Commissioner of Income Tax has rejected the application for condonation of
delay invoking power under Section 119(2)(b) of the Income Tax Act in filing Audit
Report in Form-10B prescribed under Rule 17B of the IT Rules pertaining to the
Assessment Year 2020-21 on flimsy and illogical grounds. The arbitrary exercise of
discretion vested in the Authority would render the impugned order vitiated.
4.1. It is vociferously urged that when there is no dispute that the Audit Report was
required to be filed on or before 15.01.2021, but the same was filed on 31.03.2021, the
reason for the delay of seventy-six days in filing said Report should have been
appreciated pragmatically by condoning the delay. Having thus admitted the Audit
Report, the petitioner should have been allowed the claim for exemption under
Section 12A of the IT Act.
4.2. He submitted that it is common knowledge that force majeure1 situation
prevailed over entire world including India during 2020-22. He would point out that:
i. It is incorrect on the part of the Authority to say that the petitioner was negligent.
There was difficulty in apprising accounts facilitating the Chartered Accountant, who
was practising in Bhubaneswar, to prepare Audit Report coming down from
Patnagarh in the district of Bolangir, from where the petitioner-Society operates, as
the pandemic situation prevailed till 2022, as is apparent from the Order dated
10.01.2022 of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India vide Annexure-9.
1 In business circles, „force majeure(cid:128) describes those uncontrollable events or
circumstances beyond human control such as an event described as an act of God
(like natural calamity, war, strike, riots, etc.) that are not the fault of any party and
that make it difficult or impossible to carry out normal business and perform the
contractual liability despite of readiness and willingness. Generally, on the activation
of the Force Majeure clause in the contract, it absolves both parties from contractual
liability or obligation under the contract. The relevant provisions are embodied under
Sections 32 and 56 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. : Source:
www.livelaw.in/law-firms/articles : COVID-19 Crisis: Force Majeure And Impact On
Contracts From An Indian Law Perspective.
ii. The decision rendered by the Delhi High Court could not have been relied on to reject the
application for condonation of delay inasmuch as no detail has been provided by the concerned
Authority in the order. To illustrate, the date of Judgment is not available nor the reference of its
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/149382458/ 4
Action Research For Health And vs Central Board Of Direct Taxes (Cbdt) on 25 April, 2025
reporting. As it seems the said referred Judgment does not relate to situation like the present one.
iii. The decisions of Supreme Court in Ranka Vrs.
Rewa Coalfields Ltd., AIR 1962 SC 361 and Madras High Court in the case of Madhu Dadha Vrs.
ACIT, 317 ITR 458 have been referred to by the Authority to say that each day's delay needed to be
explained and the delay could be allowed on ―genuine hardship(cid:130). The ratio of said judgments has
not been appropriately applied inasmuch as the Hon'ble Supreme Court in its Order dated
10.01.2022 rendered in Miscellaneous Application No.21 of 2022 in Miscellaneous Application
No.665 of 2021 in Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) No.3 of 2020 acknowledged plight of litigants and
issued directions granting 90 days' from 01.03.2022 for compliance of statutory requirement.
He placed reliance on the following observation made by one of us (Hon'ble Shri Harish Tandon,
Chief Justice) in the case of Joharimal High School, Cuttack Vrs. The Principal Commissioner of
Income Tax (Exemptions), Hyderabad and others, W.P.(C) No. 3183 of 2025, vide Order dated
05.04.2025 in the context of application for condonation under Section 119(2)(b) of the IT Act:
"It appears to us that the authority has taken a stricter view and without adverting to
the explanation offered has proceeded on the basis of the ratio of law culled out from
the various judgment of the apex Court. The law has to be applied not in an adjunct
manner, but in the perspective of the context, i.e., the facts involved therein as each
fact cannot be equated with the other facts and, therefore, a pragmatic approach is
required in relation to an application for condonation of delay."
iv. The principle devised in Union of India Vrs. Dilip Kumar & Co., (2018) 9 SCC 1, being rendered
under different context and factual scenario, could not be applied to the instant case. In the present
case to claim exemption under Section 12A of the IT Act, the Audit Report in Form 10B prescribed
under Rule 17B of the IT Rules has been furnished with a delay of seventy-six days as there was
reasonable cause demonstrating genuine hardship which prevented the petitioner from filing within
the period stipulated.
v. The Commissioner of Income Tax stemming on the Circular No.9/2015, dated 09.06.2015 issued
by the Central Board of Direct Taxes in the matter of consideration of application for condonation of
delay under Section 119(2)(b) of the IT Act, refused to admit the Audit Report claiming benefit of
exemption. It is gross mistake on the part of the Authority concerned and failure on his part to
perceive that such Circular has already been superseded by subsequent Circular.
4.3. With his usual humility, Sri Chitrasen Parida, learned Advocate would submit that the
Commissioner of Income Tax (Exemption), while rejecting the application for condonation of delay
in filing Audit Report in Form 10B under Section 12A read with Rule 17B, passed the Order dated
17.02.2025 not in consonance with terms of Circular 16/2024 [F. No.197/639/2024-ITA-I] dated
18.11.2024 issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (Annexure-7). Expanding his argument he
strenuously contended that the Authority being conscious of the fact that Circular No.9/2015, dated
09.06.2015 has been superseded by virtue of Circular 16/2024 [F. No.197/639/2024-ITA-I] dated
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/149382458/ 5
Action Research For Health And vs Central Board Of Direct Taxes (Cbdt) on 25 April, 2025
18.11.2024, the impugned rejection order cannot be sustained in the eye of law.
5. Sri Avinash Kedia, learned Junior Standing Counsel appearing for the Department-opposite
parties strongly opposed the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner and sought to
justify the reason assigned by the Commissioner of Income Tax (Exemption).
5.1. He strenuously argued in favour of the Department to contend that time schedule specified
under the IT Act and rules framed thereunder is sacrosanct and there cannot be any deviation
therefrom without extension granted under proper notification/circular. The petitioner cannot be
allowed to file documents at his sweet wish. The petitioner was conscious and had knowledge about
the compliance of statutory requirement within the time frame, failing which the claim for
exemption would get rejected. The Commissioner of Income Tax (Exemption) did reject the claim
having regard to instructions and decisions on the subject.
5.2. Having applied his mind rationally, the Order dated 17.02.2025 of the Commissioner of Income
Tax (Exemption) cannot be interfered with. Doing so would be taking away his discretionary power
to consider condonation of delay in filing Audit Report in Form 10B.
5.3. Therefore, the application for condonation of delay, being rightfully rejected by the opposite
party No.2, indulgence in the matter by this Court is unwarranted. Allowing the writ petition would
tantamount to tinker with the demand raised against the petitioner under Section 143 of the IT Act.
Statutory provisions:
6. Relevant provisions of the IT Act are given hereunder.

***
119. Instructions to subordinate authorities.--
(1) The Board may, from time to time, issue such orders, instructions and directions
to other income-tax authorities as it may deem fit for the proper administration of
this Act, and such authorities and all other persons employed in the execution of this
Act shall observe and follow such orders, instructions and directions of the Board:
Provided that no such orders, instructions or directions shall be issued--
(a) so as to require any income-tax authority to make a particular assessment or to
dispose of a particular case in a particular manner; or
(b) so as to interfere with the discretion of the Commissioner (Appeals) in the
exercise of his appellate functions.
(2) Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power,--
(a) the Board may, if it considers it necessary or expedient so to do, for the purpose of
proper and efficient management of the work of assessment and collection of
revenue, issue, from time to time (whether by way of relaxation of any of the
provisions of sections 115P, 115S, 115WD, 115WE, 115WF, 115WG, 115WH, 115WJ,
115WK, 139, 143, 144, 147, 148, 154, 155, 158BFA, sub-section (1A) of Section 201,
sections 210, 211, 234A, 234B, 234C, 234E, 270A, 271, 271C, 271CA and 273 or
otherwise), general or special orders in respect of any class of incomes or fringe
benefits or class of cases, setting forth directions or instructions (not being
prejudicial to assessees) as to the guidelines, principles or procedures to be followed
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/149382458/ 8
Action Research For Health And vs Central Board Of Direct Taxes (Cbdt) on 25 April, 2025
by other income tax authorities in the work relating to assessment or collection of
revenue or the initiation of proceedings for the imposition of penalties and any such
order may, if the Board is of opinion that it is necessary in the public interest so to do,
be published and circulated in the prescribed manner for general information;
(b) the Board may, if it considers it desirable or expedient so to do for avoiding
genuine hardship in any case or class of cases, by general or special order, authorise
any income-
tax authority, not being a Commissioner (Appeals) to admit an application or claim for any
exemption, deduction, refund or any other relief under this Act after the expiry of the period
specified by or under this Act for making such application or claim and deal with the same on merits
in accordance with law;
(c) the Board may, if it considers it desirable or expedient so to do for avoiding genuine hardship in
any case or class of cases, by general or special order for reasons to be specified therein, relax any
requirement contained in any of the provisions of Chapter IV or Chapter VI-A, where the assessee
has failed to comply with any requirement specified in such provision for claiming deduction
thereunder, subject to the following conditions, namely:--
(i) the default in complying with such requirement was due to circumstances beyond
the control of the assessee; and
(ii) the assessee has complied with such requirement before the completion of
assessment in relation to the previous year in which such deduction is claimed:
Provided that the Central Government shall cause every order issued under this
clause to be laid before each House of Parliament."
6.1. Rule 17B of the IT Rules stands thus:
"17B.Audit Report in case of charitable or religious trusts.--
The report of audit of the accounts of trust or institution which is required to be
furnished under clause (b) of Section 12A, shall be in Form No.10B."
Discussions and analysis:
7. Diligent reading of provisions of Section 12A(b) read with Rule 17B alongside Section 119(2)(b) of
the IT Act manifests that the Commissioner of Income Tax being empowered by virtue of Circular
F.No.197/639/2024- ITA-I, dated 18.11.2024 issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes can admit
an application or claim for exemption, deduction, refund or any other relief even after the expiry of
the period specified to make such claim or such application. By condoning the delay the same could
be dealt with on merit.

Action Research For Health And vs Central Board Of Direct Taxes (Cbdt) on 25 April, 2025
7.1. Such power is apparently hedged with condition to consider ―genuine hardship(cid:130). Thus it is
unambiguous that in case of genuine hardship faced by the assessee, the Commissioner of Income
Tax is authorised to consider application after expiry of the period specified for filing Audit Report
in Form 10B in terms of Section 12A read with Rule 17B.
7.2. Citing pandemic situation and extension of period of limitation by the Hon'ble Supreme Court
exercising suo motu power with respect to general and special laws for compliance of statutory
requirement by litigants in view of difficulty faced by them due to shutdown imposed by the
Government, the petitioner approached the Authority concerned by making an application dated
03.12.2024 with a prayer to condone the delay in filing the Audit Report in Form 10B along with
return of income under Section 139 of the IT Act. It is also apprised by the petitioner before the
Commissioner of Income Tax that due to this pandemic situation and as per instructions issued by
the Government of Odisha with regard to shutdown and restricted movement, the assessee has been
functioning its administrative office with limited staff, which caused the delay in submission of
Audit Report and return of income within the period specified.
7.3. A Division Bench of this Court in Basanti Shial Vrs.
Proper Officer, (2022) 106 GSTR 419 = 2022 SCC OnLine Ori 4150 took cognizance of pandemic
situation as a good and sufficient ground for condonation of delay. The Court proceeded to observe
as follows:
"8. From the above narration of facts, it is apparent that the period of three months from the date of
communication of order sought to be appealed against got lapsed during period when the effect of
COVID-19 virus was at its peak. Noteworthy here to refresh that the lock-down was imposed on
March 24, 2020 and there was impediment for the petitioner to file the appeal on or before June 5,
2020.
9. The Hon(cid:128)ble Supreme Court of India In re:
Cognizance for Extension of Limitation, Suo Motu Writ Petition (Civil) No. 3/2020
[2020 SCC OnLine SC 343 = (2020) 19 SCC 10] vide Order dated 23.03.2020
considering the challenge faced by the country on account of COVID-19 Virus and
resultant difficulties that would be faced by litigants across the country in filing their
petitions/applications/ suits/appeals/all other proceedings within the period of
limitation prescribed under the general law of limitation or under Special Law (both
Central and/or State), directed as follows:
„To obviate such difficulties and to ensure that lawyers/litigants do not have to come
physically to file such proceedings in respective Courts/Tribunals across the country
including this Court, it is hereby ordered that a period of limitation in all such
proceedings, irrespective of the limitation prescribed under the general law or Special
Laws whether condonable or not shall stand extended w.e.f. 15th March 2020 till

We are exercising this power under Article 142 read with Article 141 of the
Constitution of India and declare that this order is a binding order within the
meaning of Article 141 on all Courts/Tribunals and authorities.
This order may be brought to the notice of all High Courts for being communicated to
all subordinate Courts/Tribunals within their respective jurisdiction.(cid:128)
10. This Court considering gravity of situation, vide Order dated May 5, 2020 in the matter of Bijaya
Kumar Ragada Vrs. State of Odisha, W. P. (C) No. 9095 of 2020, observed as follows:
„2. Lock-down phase 3.0 throughout the country for two weeks with effect from May
4, 2020 is in currency now. Novel Corona Virus (COVID-
19) has infected more than 46,000 persons so far across the country. The virus, Novel
as it is, in absence of vaccine and medication to arrest its spread, declares with pride
„Hide from me to be safe(cid:128) and „Keep distance from my carrier to be alive(cid:128). The
honourable Prime Minister of India and honourable Chief Minister of our State have
taken well conceived, well thought of, justly considered, tough and hard steps to
contain the crisis arising out of the virus.
3. Staying at home to be safe and maintaining social distance are the only ways to check spread of
the virus. India countries cross sections of people of various religion, faith, cast, creed and colour.
Law abidingness, however, has never been a natural habit of a part of the population.
Irresponsibility is writ large when it comes to conforming to certain sets of discipline and order. In
such a situation, locking down the entire country to keep the people safe was probably the only
remedy available, though outcome of a very tough and difficult decision. We, therefore, are one in
our view that executive Government is best fitted and best suited to contain the crisis arising out of
the virus in its own novel and extraordinary way, provided everything is done within the
constitutional framework and there is proper co- ordination among the implementing agencies.
4. Locking down the entire country was the outcome of a tough decision in fact. Unlocking the
country is going to be more tough and a difficult responsibility. In the process, however, the courts(cid:128)
work throughout the country has suffered and consequently the litigants have been suffering.
5. On the face of the crisis, we are sincerely concerned with the plight of the citizens and the
litigants, majority of whom in our State are poor. They are not in a position to come to the court in
such a situation to seek legal remedies. We also do not want rush of litigants in the courts in
contravention of the 'social distancing' discipline.
6. For the consequential lock down due to COVID-
19 in three phases including the present one, working of this court, other subordinate courts as well
as judicial and quasi-judicial authorities working under the superintendence of this court, has been
affected to a great extent. The situation has resulted in hardship for the litigants and ordinary
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/149382458/ 11
Action Research For Health And vs Central Board Of Direct Taxes (Cbdt) on 25 April, 2025
citizens to approach the court of law to take recourse to legal remedies. With a view to ensure that
the litigants and citizens do not suffer on account of their inability to approach the court of law, we
propose to invoke our plenary power under article 226 and power of superintendence under article
227 of the Constitution of India, our inherent power over the criminal matters under Section 482,
Cr.P.C., our power of superintendence over criminal courts under Section 483, Cr.P.C. and our
inherent power over the civil matters under Section 151 of the C.P.C.
7. We do not see a fathomable end to the present crisis, but we hope that, by the end of the ensuing
summer vacation of this court as well as the subordinate judiciary of the State, the situation shall be
normal or at least near to normal. Keeping such hope in mind, in exercise of our power under
articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India read with sections 482 and 483, Cr.P.C. and Section
151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, we issue the following directions to at least contain the plight of
the litigants and non-litigants.
***
(xi) That it is further directed that if the Government of Odisha and/or any of its Department and/or
functionaries, Central Government and/or its Departments or functionaries or any public sector

the order of this court or any court subordinate to it or the Tribunals, required to do a particular
thing or carry out certain direction in a particular manner in a time frame, which expired or is going
to expire at any time, during the period of lock down or the extended lock down, time for
compliance of such order shall stand extended up to 18th June 2020, unless specifically directed
otherwise.(cid:128) ***"

also be noteworthy to refer to clarification issued from the Commissionerate of

termination of proceedings.

We have passed this order in exercise of our powers under article 142 read with
article 141 of the Constitution of India. Hence it shall be a binding order within the
meaning of article 141 on all courts/Tribunals and authorities.(cid:128) 2.2 The matter of
extension of period of limitation under Section 168A of the CGST Act, 2017 was
deliberated in the 43rd Meeting of GST Council. Council, while providing various
relaxations in the compliances for taxpayers, also recommended that wherever the
timelines for actions have been extended by the honourable Supreme Court, the same
would apply.
3. Accordingly, legal opinion was solicited regarding applicability of the order of the
honourable Supreme Court to the limitations of timelines under GST law. The matter
has been examined on the basis of the legal opinion received in the matter. The
following is observed as per the legal opinion :
(i) The extension granted by the honourable Supreme Court order applies only to
quasi-judicial and judicial matters relating to petitions/ applications/suits/
appeals/all other proceedings. All other proceedings should be understood in the
nature of the earlier used expressions but can be quasi-judicial proceedings. The
honourable Supreme Court has stepped into to grant extensions only with reference
to judicial and quasi-judicial proceedings in the nature of appeals/suits/ petitions,
etc., and has not extended it to every action or proceeding under the CGST Act.
(ii) For the purpose of counting the period(s) of limitation for filing of appeals before
any appellate authority under the GST law, the limitation stands extended till further
orders as ordered by the honourable Supreme Court in Suo Motu Writ Petition (Civil)
No. 3 of 2020 vide order dated 27th April 2021. Thus, as on date, the orders of the
honourable Supreme Court apply to appeals, reviews, revisions, etc., and not to
original adjudication.
(iii) Various orders and extensions passed by the honourable Supreme Court would
apply only to acts and actions which are in nature of judicial, including quasi-
judicial exercise of power and discretion. Even under this category, the honourable Supreme Court
order, applies only to a lis which needs to be pursued within a time frame fixed by the respective
statutes.
(iv) Wherever proceedings are pending, judicial or quasi-judicial which requires to be heard and
disposed off, cannot come to a standstill by virtue of these extension orders. Those cases need to be
adjudicated or disposed off either physically or through the virtual mode based on the prevailing
policies and practices besides instructions if any.
(v) The following actions such as scrutiny of returns, issuance of summons, search, enquiry or
investigations and even consequential arrest in accordance with GST law would not be covered by
the judgment of the honourable Supreme Court.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/149382458/ 14
Action Research For Health And vs Central Board Of Direct Taxes (Cbdt) on 25 April, 2025
(vi) As regards issuance of show-cause notice, granting time for replies and passing orders, the
present orders of the honourable Supreme Court may not cover them even though they are
quasi-judicial proceedings as the same has only been made applicable to matters relating to
petitions/applications/suits, etc.
4. On the basis of the legal opinion, it is hereby clarified that various actions/compliances under
GST can be broadly categorised as follows :
(a) Proceedings that need to be initiated or compliances that need to be done by the
taxpayers :
These actions would continue to be governed only by the statutory mechanism and
time-limit provided/ extensions granted under the statute itself. Various orders of the
honourable Supreme Court would not apply to the said proceedings/compliances on
part of the taxpayers.
(b) Quasi-judicial proceedings by tax authorities :
The tax authorities can continue to hear and dispose off proceedings where they are
performing the functions as quasi- judicial authority. This may, inter alia, include
disposal of application for refund, application for revocation of cancellation of
registration, adjudication proceedings of demand notices, etc. Similarly, appeals
which are filed and are pending, can continue to be heard and disposed off and the
same will be governed by those extensions of time granted by the statutes or
notifications, if any.
(c) Appeals by taxpayers/tax authorities against any quasi-judicial order :
Wherever any appeal is required to filed before Joint/Additional Commissioner
(Appeals), Commissioner (Appeals), Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling,
Tribunal and various courts against any quasi-judicial order or where a proceeding
for revision or rectification of any order is required to be undertaken, the timeline for
the same would stand extended as per the honourable Supreme Court's order.
5. In other words, the extension of timelines granted by honourable Supreme Court vide its order
dated April 27, 2021 is applicable in respect of any appeal which is required to be filed before
Joint/Additional Commissioner (Appeals), Commissioner (Appeals), Appellate Authority for
Advance Ruling, Tribunal and various courts against any quasi- judicial order or where proceeding
for revision or rectification of any order is required to be undertaken, and is not applicable to any
other proceedings under GST laws.
6. It is requested that suitable trade notices may be issued to publicize the contents of this circular.(cid:128)

14. The clarification as issued by the Central Government and adopted by the State Government
seems to be gesture of pragmatic approach to mitigate hardship of concerned during the unforeseen
pandemic. When the OGST Act was enacted in 2017, in order to tide the situation like force majeure
over, appropriate legislation was not in place. However, conceiving the gravity of circumstances that
prevailed over entire world and visualizing insurmountable difficulties faced by human beings, new
provisions by way of amendment to the OGST Act have been inserted in tune with the provisions of
the Taxation and other Laws (Relaxation of Certain Provisions) Ordinance, 2020 and the Taxation
and other Laws (Relaxation of Certain Provisions) Act, 2020. Section 168A thereof was first inserted
with effect from March 31, 2020 by way of promulgation of the Odisha Goods and Services Tax
(Amendment) Ordinance, 2020 (Odisha Ordinance No. 5 of 2020) by the Governor of Odisha on
June 9, 2020 vide Law Department Notification No. 5278-I-Legis-22/2020/L, dated June 11, 2020,
published in the Odisha Gazette Extraordinary No. 856, dated June 11, 2020 and subsequently the
same has been enacted as the Odisha Goods and Services Tax (Amendment) Act, 2020 (Odisha Act 5
of 2020) and was given effect from March 31, 2020.
16. As noticed above the Central Government as also the State Government in line with the
judgment of the honourable Supreme Court have issued orders/ notifications/circulars giving
relaxation to the taxpayers for various compliances under the GST laws. The honourable Supreme
Court disposed of Cognizance for Extension of Limitation, In re, Suo Motu Writ Petition (Civil) No.
3/2020 on March 8, 2021 reported in (2021) 432 ITR 206 (SC) = (2021) 5 SCC 452 = (2021) 3 SCC
(Civ) 40 = (2021) 2 SCC (Cri) 615 = (2021) 2 SCC (L&S) 50 with the following observations and
directions (pages 208 and 209 in 432 ITR) :
„1. Due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, this court took suo motu cognizance
of the situation arising from difficulties that might be faced by the litigants across the
country in filing petitions/applications/suits/appeals/all other proceedings within
the period of limitation prescribed under the general law of limitation or under any
special laws (both Central or State). By an order dated March 27, 2020 (sic March 23,
2020 (Cognizance for Extension of Limitation, In re (2020) 424 ITR 314 (SC) =
(2020) 19 SCC 10 = (2020) SCC OnLine SC 343) this court extended the period of
limitation prescribed under the general law or special laws whether compoundable or
not with effect from March 15, 2020 till further orders. The order dated March 15,
2020 was extended from time to time. Though, we have not seen the end of the
pandemic, there is considerable improvement. The lockdown has been lifted and the
country is returning to normalcy. Almost all the courts and Tribunals are functioning
either physically or by virtual mode. We are of the opinion that the order dated
March 15, 2020 has served its purpose and in view of the changing scenario relating
to the pandemic, the extension of limitation should come to an end.
2. We have considered the suggestions of the learned Attorney General for India
regarding the future course of action. We deem it appropriate to issue the following
directions :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/149382458/ 16
Action Research For Health And vs Central Board Of Direct Taxes (Cbdt) on 25 April, 2025
2.1. In computing the period of limitation for any suit, appeal, application or
proceeding, the period from March 15, 2020 till March 14, 2021 shall stand excluded.
Consequently, the balance period of limitation remaining as on March 15, 2020, if
any, shall become available with effect from March 15, 2021.
2.2. In cases where the limitation would have expired during the period between
March 15, 2020 till March 14, 2021, notwithstanding the actual balance period of
limitation remaining, all persons shall have a limitation period of 90 days from
March 15, 2021. In the event the actual balance period of limitation remaining, with
effect from March 15, 2021, is greater than 90 days, that longer period shall apply.
2.3. The period from March 15, 2020 till March 14, 2021 shall also stand excluded in
computing the periods prescribed under sections 23(4) and 29A of the Arbitration
and Conciliation Act, 1996, Section 12A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 and
provisos (b) and (c) of Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and any
other laws, which prescribe period(s) of limitation for instituting proceedings, outer-
limits (within which the court or Tribunal can condone delay) and termination of proceedings.
2.4. The Government of India shall amend the guidelines for containment zones, to state :
„Regulated movement will be allowed for medical emergencies, provision of essential
goods and services, and other necessary functions, such as, time bound applications,
including for legal purposes, and educational and job-related requirements.(cid:128) ***"
7.4. In Atlas PVC Pipes Limited Vrs. State of Odisha, (2022) 106 GSTR 433 (Ori) =
2022 SCC OnLine Ori 2182 it has been stated thus:
"6.2. Accepting notice on behalf of the opposite parties, namely the Commissioner of
CT & GST, the Joint Commissioner of State Tax (Appeal), CT & GST Territorial
Range, Cuttack-I and CT & GST Officer, Cuttack-I Central Circle, Mr. Mishra, learned
Additional Standing Counsel, therefore, has made fair admission of the fact that the
defect as pointed out by the CT & GST Organisation, being technical, the pedantic
reason ascribed by the appellate authority cannot be countenanced on the face of
decision of this court vide Order dated June 7, 2021 rendered in the case of Shree
Jagannath Traders Vrs. Commissioner of State Tax, Odisha, Cuttack (2021) 94 GSTR
46 (Orissa), (W. P. (C) No. 15061 of 2021), wherein identical issue as that of the
present case fell for consideration. This court framed the following question for
adjudication (page 48 in 94 GSTR) :
„The short point for determination in the present writ petition is whether the
appellate authority under the OGST Act, 2017, was justified in dismissing the
petitioner(cid:128)s appeal, by the impugned order dated March 10, 2021, on the grounds
that the appeal was not presented within the time prescribed under law.(cid:128) 6.3.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/149382458/ 17
Action Research For Health And vs Central Board Of Direct Taxes (Cbdt) on 25 April, 2025
Answering the said question in the negative against the Revenue and in favour of the
petitioner-
appellant, this Court has made the following observation (page 49 in 94 GSTR) :
„12. Considering that the explanation offered by the petitioner is a plausible and not
an unreasonable one, especially in these COVID times, and further considering that a
downloaded copy thereof was in fact submitted along with the appeal which was
otherwise filed within time, this court is of the view that the mere delay in enclosing a
certified copy of order appealed against along with the appeal should not come in the
way of the petitioner's appeal for being considered on merits by the appellate
authority. This is a case of substantial compliance and the interests of justice ought
not to be constrained by a hyper technical view of the requirement that a certified
copy of the order appealed against should be submitted within one week of the filing
of the appeal. To repeat, in these covid times when there is a restricted functioning of
courts and Tribunals in general, a more liberal approach is warranted in matters of
condonation of delay, which cannot be said to be extraordinary.(cid:128) 6.4. In this context
this court also takes note of the decision vide Order dated June 10, 2021 passed in
Shree Udyog Vrs. Commissioner of State Tax, (2022) 106 GSTR 414 (Orissa),
(W.P.(C) No. 14887 of 2021), which is in similitude with that of Shree Jagannath
Traders (2021) 94 GSTR 46 (Orissa).
6.5. It is ex facie clear from the copy of memo of appeal in form GST APL-01 vide
annexure 2 series to the writ petition that having received the Order passed under
Section 74 of the OGST Act on January 20, 2021, the petitioner filed the appeal
invoking Section 107 on April 21, 2021. The statutory prescribed period for preferring
appeal fell within the extended period in consonance with Finance Department
Notification bearing No. 13898-FIN-CT1-TAX-
0002/2020 (SRO No. 129/2021), dated May 7, 2021 issued in exercise of powers under Section

the case of In Re :

5. Taking into consideration the arguments advanced by learned counsel and the impact of the surge
of the virus on public health and adversities faced by litigants in the prevailing conditions, we deem
it appropriate to dispose of M. A. No. 21 of 2022 with the following directions :
(I) The order dated March 23, 2020 is restored and in continuation of the subsequent
orders dated March 8, 2021, April 27, 2021 and September 23, 2021 it is directed that
the period from March 15, 2020 till February 28, 2022 shall stand excluded for the
purposes of limitation as may be prescribed under any general or special laws in
respect of all judicial or quasi-
judicial proceedings.
(II) Consequently, the balance period of limitation remaining as on October 3, 2021, if any, shall
become available with effect from March 1, 2022.
(III) In cases where the limitation would have expired during the period between March 15, 2020 till
February 28, 2022, notwithstanding the actual balance period of limitation remaining, all persons
shall have a limitation period of 90 days from March 1, 2022. In the event the actual balance period
of limitation remaining, with effect from March 1, 2022 is greater than 90 days, that longer period
shall apply.
(IV) It is further clarified that the period from March 15, 2020 till February 28, 2022 shall also
stand excluded in computing the periods prescribed under Sections 23(4) and 29A of the Arbitration
and Conciliation Act, 1996, Section 12A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 and provisos (b) and (c)
of Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and any other laws, which prescribe
period(s) of limitation for instituting proceedings, outer limits (within which the court or tribunal
can condone delay) and termination of proceedings.
6. As prayed for by learned Senior Counsel, M.A. No. 29 of 2022 is dismissed as withdrawn.(cid:128) 6.8. If
present case is considered in the light of aforesaid order dated January 10, 2022 (Cognizance for
Extension of Limitation, In re (2022) 441 ITR 722 (SC) of the honourable Apex Court, the petitioner
is entitled to the benefit of exclusion of limitation of seven days as stipulated in Rule 108(3) of the
OGST Rules inasmuch as the certified copy of the order dated January 20, 2021 being obtained on

Pharmaceuticals Pvt. Ltd. Vrs. Standford Laboratories Pvt. Ltd., the impugned order
passed by the High Court is unsustainable. The operative portion of the order passed
by this Court in Miscellaneous Application No. 21/2022 reads as under: ***
5. In that view of the matter, the period from 15.03.2020 till 28.02.2022 shall have to
be excluded for the purposes of limitation as may be prescribed under any General or
Special Laws in respect of all judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings. The Commercial
Courts Act, 2015 being a Special Law, the said order shall also be applicable with
respect to the limitation prescribed under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 also.
6. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above and more particularly when
the 120 days period expired in the present case on 09.05.2020 which was during the
aforesaid period as prescribed by this Court in the aforesaid order, the High Court
ought to have excluded the aforesaid period for the purpose of filing the written
statement and ought to have permitted to take the written statement on record. The
impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court refusing to condone the
delay and take on record the written statement is hereby quashed and set aside. It is
directed that the written statement, already filed, be taken on record and the same be
considered in accordance with law."
7.6. This Court in the case of Jyoti Ranjan Panda Vrs.
Additional Commissioner of State Tax (Appeal), Balasore, W.P.(C) No.41961 of 2021, in its Order
dated 29.11.2022 made it clear as follows:
"4. The above position is not able to be denied by learned counsel for the
Department. Indeed, the Supreme Court had extended the time periods for various
kinds of cases where the limitation was going to expire during the period when
COVID-19 was active. As explained in Babasaheb Raosaheb Kobarne Vrs. Pyrotek
India Private Limited, 2022 LiveLaw (SC) 520, the extended period of limitation in
terms of the above Supreme Court(cid:128)s orders was binding on all authorities."
7.7. Regard being had to the statement of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India made in East India
Commercial Co. Ltd. Vrs. Collector of Customs, 1962 SCC OnLine SC 142 = (1963) 3 SCR 338 = AIR
1962 SC 18932 that law enunciated by highest Court of the State is to be respected, the relevant
portion of the reported judgment is extracted (SCC OnLine) hereunder:
"31. As we have already noticed in the earlier stage of the judgment, the notice issued
by the respondent charges the appellants thus:
„One of the conditions of the special licence was that the goods would be utilised for
consumption as raw material or accessories in the factory of the licence- holder and
no part thereof would be sold to other parties, but in contravention of that condition

Action Research For Health And vs Central Board Of Direct Taxes (Cbdt) on 25 April, 2025
the appellants sold a part of the goods imported to a third party; and as the goods had
been caused to be issued by fraudulent misrepresentation, they were liable to be
confiscated under Section 167(8) of the Sea Customs Act.(cid:128) Section 167(8) of the Sea
Customs Act can be invoked only if an order issued under Section 3 of 2 The principle
enunciated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in East India Commercial Co. Ltd.
Vrs. Collector of Customs, 1962 SCC OnLine SC 142 = (1963) 3 SCR 338 = AIR 1962
SC 1893 has been followed by this Court in Chowhan Machinery Mart Vrs. State of
Orissa, (2009) 19 VST 178 (Ori) = 2008 SCC OnLine Ori 596.
the Act was infringed during the course of the import or export. The Division Bench of the High
Court held that a contravention of a condition imposed by a licence issued under the Act is not an
offence under Section 5 of the Act. This raises the question whether an Administrative Tribunal can
ignore the law declared by the highest court in the State and initiate proceedings in direct violation
of the law so declared. Under Article 215, every High Court shall be a court of record and shall have
all the powers of such a court including the power to punish for contempt of itself. Under Article
226, it has a plenary power to issue orders or writs for the enforcement of the fundamental rights
and for any other purpose to any person or authority, including in appropriate cases any
Government, within its territorial jurisdiction. Under Article 227 it has jurisdiction over all courts
and tribunals throughout the territories in relation to which it exercises jurisdiction. It would be
anomalous to suggest that a tribunal over which the High Court has superintendence can ignore the
law declared by that court and start proceedings in direct violation of it. If a tribunal can do so, all
the subordinate courts can equally do so, for there is no specific provision, just like in the case of
Supreme Court, making the law declared by the High Court binding on subordinate Courts. It is
implicit in the power of supervision conferred on a superior tribunal that all the tribunals subject to
its supervision should conform to the law laid down by it. Such obedience would also be conducive
to their smooth working : otherwise, there would be confusion in the administration of law and
respect for law would irretrievably suffer. We, therefore, hold that the law declared by the highest
court in the State is binding on authorities or tribunals under its superintendence, and that they
cannot ignore it either in initiating a proceeding or deciding on the rights involved in such a
proceeding. If that be so, the notice issued by the authority signifying the launching of proceedings
contrary to the law laid down by the High Court would be invalid and the proceedings themselves
would be without jurisdiction."
7.8. The decisions referred to supra make it abundantly clear that the pandemic situation prevailed
over since March, 2020 till February, 2022 and COVID-19 virus impacted the litigants largely by
preventing them from complying with the statutory requirement. By virtue of intervention of the
Court, the stipulation as to the statutory period has been extended from time to time.
8. In order to appreciate the reasons assigned for rejection of application for condonation of delay in
filing the Audit Report in Form 10B by the Commissioner of Income Tax (Exemption), it may be
apposite to refer to paragraph-3 of the said Circular No.9/2015 [F. No.312/22/2015-OT] dated
09.06.2015 issued by the Government of India, Ministry of Finance Department of Revenue, Central
Board of Direct Taxes, which stood thus:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/149382458/ 22
Action Research For Health And vs Central Board Of Direct Taxes (Cbdt) on 25 April, 2025
"3. No condonation application for claim of refund/loss shall be entertained beyond
six years from the end of the Assessment Year for which such application/ claim is
made. This limit of six years shall be applicable to all authorities having powers to
condone the delay as per the above prescribed monetary limits, including the Board.
A condonation application should be disposed of within six months from the end of
the month in which the application is received by the competent authority, as far as
possible."
8.1. Be that as it may, said Circular has been ―superseded(cid:130) by virtue of Circular No.16/2024 [F.
No.197/639/2024- ITA-I], dated 18.11.2024 issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes, which
reads as follows:
"In supersession of all earlier Circulars/ Instructions issued by the Central Board of
Direct Taxes („CBDT(cid:128)) from time to time to deal with the applications for
condonation of delay in filing Form 9A/10/10B/10BB for Assessment Year 2018-19
and subsequent Assessment Years, the CBDT in exercise of the powers conferred
under Section 119(2)(b) of the Income Tax Act ((cid:128)the Act(cid:128)), authorizes:-
1.1. the Pr. Commissioner of Income Tax („Pr.CsIT(cid:128))/ Commissioners of Income Tax
(„CsIT(cid:128)) to admit and deal with applications for condonation of delay in filing Form
No.9A/10/10B/10BB for Assessment Year 2018-19 and subsequent Assessment Years
where there is a delay of upto 365 days.
1.2. the Pr. Chief Commissioners of Income Tax („Pr.
CsIT(cid:128))/ Chief Commissioner of Income Tax („CsIT(cid:128))/ Director Generals of Income Tax („DGsIT(cid:128))
to admit and deal with applications for condonation of delay in filing Form No.9A/10/10B/10BB for
Assessment Year 2018- 19 and subsequent Assessment Years where there is a delay of more than
365 days.
2. The Pr. CCsIT/CCsIT/Pr. CsIT/CsIT while entertaining such applications for condonation of
delay in filing Form No.9A/10/10B/10BB, shall satisfy themselves that the applicant was prevented
by reasonable cause from filing such Forms before the expiry of the time allowed and the case is of
genuine hardship on merits.
2.1. Further, in respect of Form No.10, the Pr.
CCsIT/CCsIT/Pr. CsIT/CsIT as the case may be, shall also satisfy themselves that the amount
accumulated or set apart has been invested or deposited in any one or more of the forms or modes
specified in sub-section (5) of Section 11 of the Act.
3. No application for condonation of delay in filing of Form No.9A/10/10B/10BB shall be
entertained beyond three years from the end of the Assessment Year for which such application is
made. The time limit for filing of such application within three years from the end of the Assessment
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/149382458/ 23
Action Research For Health And vs Central Board Of Direct Taxes (Cbdt) on 25 April, 2025
Year will be applicable for application filed on or after the date of issue of this Circular. A
condonation application should be disposed of, as far as possible, within six months from the end of
the month in which such application is received by the Competent Authority.
4. The delegation of powers, as per para 1.1. & 1.2. of this Circular shall cover all such applications
for condonation of delay under Section 119(2)(b) of the Act which are pending as on date of issue of
this Circular.
5. Hindi version to follow."
8.2. The Circular dated 18.11.2024 as referred to above depicts that it empowers the Authorities
inter alia Commissioner of Income Tax to admit and deal with application for condonation of delay
in filing Audit Report in Form 10B with respect to the Assessment Year 2018-19 and ―subsequent
Assessment Years(cid:130) where there is delay of up to 365 days in the event the petitioner demonstrates
that it was prevented for reasonable cause from filing such Report before the expiry of the time
allowed and the case is of genuine hardship on merits. Paragraph 3 of said Circular dated 18.11.2024
further clarifies that no application for condonation of delay in filing of Form No.10B shall be
entertained beyond three years from the end of the Assessment Year for which such application is
made and the time limit for filing of such application within three years from the end of the
Assessment Year will be applicable for application filed on or after the date of issue of the Circular.
8.3. It is not in dispute that the petitioner was required to submit the Audit Report in Form 10B
pertaining to the Assessment Year 2020-21 on or before 15.01.2021. The end of said Assessment
Year is 31.03.2021. Said application being filed with a delay of seventy-six days, in view of paragraph
1.1 read with paragraph 4 of aforementioned Circular the Commissioner of Income Tax is the
competent authority to consider the merit of application for condonation of delay in filing Audit
Report and in terms of paragraph 3 of Circular dated 18.11.2024 three years period of limitation
would lapse on 31.03.2024.
8.4. Despite the fact that the petitioner demonstrated the COVID-19 pandemic prevailed during
2020-22, which is apparent from the decisions cited supra as ―reasonable cause(cid:130) that prevented it
from complying with the statutory requirement and by virtue of intervention of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court of India suo motu, the Audit Report besides Return under Section 139 of the IT Act
was submitted, the Commissioner of Income Tax referred to Circular No.9/2015, dated 09.06.2015,
and omitted to take into consideration Circular dated 18.11.2024, to deny relief. This Court finds
force in the submission of Sri Chitrasen Parida, learned Advocate for the petitioner that after the
Circular dated 09.06.2015 being superseded, it ceased to have operation. The Commissioner of
Income Tax apparently proceeded erroneously by placing reliance on Circular dated 09.06.2015.
The application for condonation of delay in filing Audit Report should have been admitted in terms
of Circular dated 18.11.2024 and decided. The Order dated 17.02.2025, thus, does suffer from
illegality inasmuch as the Circular dated 09.06.2015 has been superseded by the later Circular. On
the date of passing Order refusing to condone the delay, said Circular dated 09.06.2015 did cease to
exist. Therefore, the impugned order of the Commissioner of Income Tax (Exemption) cannot
withstand judicial scrutiny.

8.5. The taxing authorities are supposed to be acquainted with the law enunciated by the Court.
Authoritative pronouncement has been made in the case of Bhagirath Agarwal and Brothers Vrs.
Sales Tax Officer, Ganjam-I Circle, (1975) 36 STC 566 (Ori), which may be quoted hereunder:
"3. Law is no longer in doubt that if the supply was under compulsory levy then it is
not exigible to sales tax : see Union of India Vrs. Sales Tax Officer, Union of India
Vrs. State of Odisha, (1975) 36 STC 557 = (1971) CWR 693. The same view had been
taken by a Bench of this Court as early as 1961 in Cement Ltd. Vrs. State of Odisha,
(1961) 12 STC 205. The Assessing Authority was, under the law, bound to refer to our
decisions, and if he was not inclined to follow them, to distinguish them on facts.
Without understanding anything he simply disposed of the matter by overruling the
objection of the assesse.
***
6. It may be noted for future that in an endowment case, Bhimsen Dixit Vrs. B.K. Mishra,
Commissioner of Hindu Religious Endowments, Orissa, ILR (1971) Cut 987, this Court has held that
the Commissioner of Endowments was guilty of contempt for not having followed the decision of
this Court though the matter was brought to his notice. We clarify the position that subordinate
authorities are bound to acquaint themselves with the decisions of this Court and in case these
authorities are not followed, in appropriate cases they are liable to be proceeded with for contempt."
8.6. This Court in State of Odisha Vrs. Sreepati Ranjan Dash, 2023 SCC OnLine Ori 6207 having
taken cognizance of effect of the word ―supersession(cid:130) found place in a legal document, observed as
follows:
"53. The word "supersede" in law, vide Black(cid:128)s Law Dictionary, 5th Edition, as
referred to in Calcutta Municipal Corporation Vrs. Pawan Kumar Saraf, (1999) 2 SCC
400 = (1999) 1 SCR 74, means "obliterate, set aside, annul, replace, make void or
inefficacious or useless, repeal". The purport of "supersession" has been succinctly
explained in Union of India Vrs. Glaxo India Ltd., (2011) 6 SCC 668 = (2011) 4 SCR
50:
"39. The impugned notification uses the expression "supersession" of the earlier
notification. Therefore, the first question that requires to be considered and
answered by us is, what is the meaning of the expression „supersession(cid:128) and what is
its effect. Webster(cid:128)s Third New International Dictionary defines the word
„supersession(cid:128) to mean „the state of being superseded(cid:128), „removal(cid:128) and
„replacement(cid:128). P. Ramanatha Aiyar(cid:128)s Advanced Law Lexicon defines „superseded(cid:128)
as „set aside(cid:128) and „replaced by(cid:128). The view of this Court in some of the decisions is
that the expression „supersession(cid:128) has to be understood to amount „to repeal(cid:128) and
when notification is repealed, the provisions of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act
would not apply to notifications.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/149382458/ 25
Action Research For Health And vs Central Board Of Direct Taxes (Cbdt) on 25 April, 2025
42. In State of Orissa Vrs. Titaghur Paper Mills Company Ltd., 1985 Supp SCC 280 :
AIR 1985 SC 1293, the specific question whether on „supersession(cid:128) of a notification,
the liability to tax for a period prior to the supersession was wiped out or not, directly
arose and was considered. This Court came to the conclusion that the previous
liability to tax for a period prior to the supersession was not wiped out In our view,
the results that flow from changes in the law by way of amendment, „repeal(cid:128),
„substitution(cid:128) or „supersession(cid:128) on the earlier rights and obligations cannot be
decided on any set formulae. It is essentially a matter of construction and depends on
the intendment of the law as could be gathered from the provisions in accordance
with accepted cannons of construction.
45. In Syed Mustafa Mohamed Ghouse Vrs. State of Mysore, (1963) 1 Cri LJ 372
(Mys), the Sugar (Movement Control) Order, 1959 of 06.11.1959 was passed in
supersession of the Sugar (Movement Control) Order, 1959, dated 27.07.1959. It was
held that in law „supersession(cid:128) has not the same effect as repeal and proceedings of a
superseded order can be commenced. In R.S. Anand Behari Lal Vrs. United Provinces
Govt., AIR 1955 NUC 2769 (All), it was held that in case of supersession of a
notification, the objections and liabilities accrued and incurred under the earlier
notification remain unaffected, since the supersession will be effected from the date
of second notification and not retrospectively, so as to abrogate the earlier
notification from the date of its commencement.(cid:128)
54. The distinction between the word "substitution" and the term "supersession" can
well be deduced from the following dicta of the Hon(cid:128)ble Supreme Court of India in
the case of State of Maharashtra Vrs. Central Provinces Manganese Ore Co. Ltd.,
(1977) 1 SCC 643 = (1977) 39 STC 340 (SC):
„The following passage was also cited from Koteswar Koteswar Vittal Kamath Vrs. K.
Rangappa Balica & Co., (1969) 1 SCC 255 = AIR 1969 SC 504 (at page 509) = (1969) 3
SCR 40 (at p. 47):
„Learned counsel for the respondent, however, urged that the Prohibition Order of
1119 cannot, in any case, be held to have continued after 8 March, 1950, if the
principle laid down by this Court in Firm A.T.B. Mehtab Majid & Co. Vrs. State of
Madras, 1963 Supp (2) SCR 435 = AIR 1963 SC 928 is applied. In that case, Rule 16
of the Madras General Sales Tax (Turnover and Assessment) Rules, 1939, was
impugned. A new Rule 16 was substituted for the old Rule 16 by publication on
September 7, 1955, and this new rule was to be effective from 1 April, 1955. The Court
held that the new Rule 16(2) was invalid because the provisions of that rule
contravened the provisions of Article 304(a) of the Constitution. Thereupon, it was
urged before the Court that, if the impugned rule be held to be invalid, the old Rule
16 gets revived, so that the tax assessed on the basis of that rule will be good. The
Court rejected this submission by holding that:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/149382458/ 26
Action Research For Health And vs Central Board Of Direct Taxes (Cbdt) on 25 April, 2025
„Once the old rule has been substituted by the new rule, it ceases to exist and it does
not automatically get revived when the new rule is held to be invalid(cid:128).
On that analogy, it was argued that, if we hold that the Prohibition Order of 1950 was
invalid, the previous Prohibition Order of 1119 cannot be held to be revived. This
argument ignores the distinction between supersession of a rule, and substitution of a
rule. In the case of 1963 Supp (2) SCR 435 = AIR 1963 SC 928 (supra), the new Rule
16 was substituted for the old Rule 16. The process of substitution consists of two
steps. First, the old rule is made to cease to exist, and, next, the new rule is brought
into existence in its place. Even if the new rule be invalid, the first step of the old rule
ceasing to exist comes into effect and it was for this reason that the Court held that,
on declaration of the new rule as invalid, the old rule could not be held to be
revived(cid:128).
In the above mentioned passage, this Court merely explained the argument which
was accepted in the case of firm A.T.B. Mehtab Majid & Co. Vrs. State of Madras 1963
Supp (2) SCR 435 = AIR 1963 SC 928). After doing so, it distinguished the facts in
Koteswar(cid:128)s case (supra), relating to an alleged substitution of one Prohibition Order
by a subsequent order which was found to be invalid. It recorded its conclusion as
follows (at p. 509):
„In the case before us, there was no substitution of the Prohibition Order of 1950 for
the Prohibition Order of 1119. The Prohibition Order of 1950 was promulgated
independently of the Prohibition Order of 1119, and because of the provisions of law
it would have had the effect of making the Prohibition Order of 1119 inoperative if it
had been a valid order. If the Prohibition Order of 1950 is found-to be void ab initio,
it could never make the Prohibition Order of 1119 inoperative(cid:128).
The argument before us is that since the word „substituted(cid:128) is used in the amending
Act of 1949, it necessarily follows that the process embraces two steps. One of repeal
and another of the new enactment. But, this argument is basically different from the
argument which prevailed in Koteswar(cid:128)s case (supra) where a distinction was drawn
between a „substitution(cid:128) and „supersession(cid:128). It is true that, as the term substitution
was not used there, the old rule was not held to have been repealed. Nevertheless, the
real basis of that decision was that what was called supersession was void ab initio so
that the law remained what it would have been if no such legislative process had
taken place at all. It was held that the void and inoperative legislative process did not
affect the validity of the pre-existing rule. And, this is precisely what is contended or
by the State before us.(cid:128) ***"
8.7. There is no doubt that ―everyday of delay needs to be explained with cogent evidences(cid:130) as per
reference made by the Commissioner of Income Tax to Ranka Vrs. Rewa Coalfields Ltd., AIR 1962
SC 362, nevertheless, instead of pedantic approach, pragmatic approach is preferred in the context
of consideration of condonation of delay. It requires no evidence when the Hon'ble Supreme Court
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/149382458/ 27
Action Research For Health And vs Central Board Of Direct Taxes (Cbdt) on 25 April, 2025
as also this Court recognized the insurmountable difficulties faced by litigants during the COVID
pandemic during 2020-22. Thus, the Order dated 17.02.2025 of the Commissioner of Income Tax
cannot be said to have been passed with rational application of mind.
8.8. Whereas the petitioner has assigned the reason for being prevented during 2021, the restricted
movement declared by the State Government during pandemic situation is sufficient ground for
taking into consideration as a factor for condonation of delay. Plausibility of reason that it was
difficult for the petitioner to come down from Patnagarh in Bolangir district to Bhubaneswar during
the said period should have been appreciated by the Commissioner of Income Tax. The Parliament
as also the State Legislature being conscious of such situation promulgated Ordinance(s) and
introduced the Taxation and Other Laws (Relaxation and Amendment of Certain Provisions) Act,
2020 to put in place devise to meet exigencies during force majeure. Said Act enabled extension of
statutory limitations in different statutes including the Income Tax Act and the Goods and Services
Tax Act.
8.9. In terms of Circular dated 18.11.2024, the Income Tax Authorities inter alia Commissioner of
Income Tax is required to ensure that:
i. The assessee was prevented by ―reasonable cause(cid:130) from filing the return of income
within the due date.
ii. The case demonstrates ―genuine hardship(cid:130) on merits.
iii. The authorities may direct the jurisdictional Assessing Officer to make necessary
inquiries in accordance with the provisions of the Act to ensure that the application is
dealt with on merits in accordance with the law.
8.10. The expression ―reasonable cause(cid:130) has been clarified by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in Abdul Hakim Quraishi Vrs.
State of Bihar, AIR 1961 SC 448 by stating that ‗reasonable' implies intelligent care and
deliberation, that is, the choice of a course which reason dictates. In State of Madhya Pradesh Vrs.
Ramswarup, (1977) 40 STC 613 (MP) it has been observed that:
"REASONABLE CAUSE has not been defined under the Act. Dictionary meaning of
"reasonable" is that which is agreeable to reason, not absurd, within the limits of
reason. The expression "reasonable" therefore means rational, according to the
dictates of reason and not excessive or immoderate. An act is reasonable when it is
confirmable or agreeable to reason having regard to the facts of the particular case."
8.11. The expression ‗reasonable grounds' means something more than prima facie grounds. It
contemplates substantial probable causes for believing that the fact exists. The reasonable belief
contemplates existence of such facts and circumstances as are sufficient in themselves to justify
satisfaction of the authority. [Vide, Collector of Customs Vrs. Ahmadalieva Nodira, (2004) 3 SCC
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/149382458/ 28
Action Research For Health And vs Central Board Of Direct Taxes (Cbdt) on 25 April, 2025
549].
8.12. In B.M. Malani Vrs. CIT, (2008) 10 SCC 617 = (2008) 306 ITR 196 (SC) the term ―genuine
hardship(cid:130) has been explained in the following manner:
"16. The term "genuine" as per the New Collins Concise English Dictionary is defined
as under:
„GENUINE means not fake or counterfeit, real, not pretending (not bogus or merely
a ruse).(cid:128)
17. For interpretation of the aforementioned provision, the principle of purposive
construction should be resorted to. Levy of interest is statutory in nature, inter alia,
for recompensating the Revenue from loss suffered by non-deposit of tax by the
assessee within the time specified therefor. The said principle should also be applied
for the purpose of determining as to whether any hardship had been caused or not. A
genuine hardship would, inter alia, mean a genuine difficulty. That per se would not
lead to a conclusion that a person having large assets would never be in difficulty as
he can sell those assets and pay the amount of interest levied.
18. The ingredients of genuine hardship must be determined keeping in view the
dictionary meaning thereof and the legal conspectus attending thereto. For the said
purpose, another well-known principle, namely, a person cannot take advantage of
his own wrong, may also have to be borne in mind. The said principle, it is conceded,
has not been applied by the courts below in this case, but we may take note of a few
precedents operating in the field to highlight the aforementioned proposition of law.
[See Priyanka Overseas (P) Ltd.
Vrs. Union of India, 1991 Supp (1) SCC 102 (SCC at pp. 122-23, para 39); Union of India Vrs. Major
General Madan Lal Yadav (Retd.), (1996) 4 SCC 127 (SCC at p. 142, paras 28-29); Ashok Kapil Vrs.
Sana Ullah, (1996) 6 SCC 342 (SCC at p. 345, para 7); Sushil Kumar Vrs. Rakesh Kumar, (2003) 8
SCC 673 (SCC at p. 692, para 65, first sentence); Kusheshwar Prasad Singh Vrs. State of Bihar,
(2007) 11 SCC 447 (SCC at pp. 451-52, paras 13-14 and 16).]
19. Thus, the said principle, in our opinion, should be applied even in a case of this nature. A
statutory authority despite receipt of such a request could not have kept mum. It should have taken
some action. It should have responded to the prayer of the appellant. However, another principle
should also be borne in mind, namely, that a statutory authority must act within the four corners of
the statute. Indisputably, the Commissioner has the discretion not to accede to the request of the
assessee, but that discretion must be judiciously exercised. He has to arrive at a satisfaction that the

tax, 2009 SCC OnLine Bom 2195 = (2010) 323 ITR 223 (Bom) the following has been observed
recognizing ―genuine hardship(cid:130):
"14. *** The Gujarat High Court in the case of Gujarat Electric Co. Ltd. Vrs. CIT,
(2002) 255 ITR 396 (Guj), was pleased to hold as under (headnote):
„The Board was not justified in rejecting the claim for refund on the ground that a
case of genuine hardship was not made out by the petitioner and delay in claiming
the relief was not satisfactorily explained, more particularly when the returns could
not be filed in time due to the ill health of the officer who was looking after the
taxation matters of the petitioner.(cid:128) The Madras High Court in the case of R.
Seshammal Vrs. ITO, (1999) 237 ITR 185, was pleased to observe as under (page 187)
:
„This is hardly the manner in which the State is expected to deal with the citizens,
who in their anxiety to comply with all the requirements of the Act pay monies as
advance tax to the State, even though the monies were not actually required to be
paid by them and thereafter seek refund of the monies so paid by mistake after the
proceedings under the Act are dropped by the authorities concerned. The State is not
entitled to plead the hypertechnical plea of limitation in such a situation to avoid
return of the amounts. Section 119 of the Act vests ample power in the Board to
render justice in such a situation. The Board has acted arbitrarily in rejecting the
petitioner(cid:128)s request for refund.(cid:128)
15. The phrase "genuine hardship" used in Section 119(2)(b) should have been
construed liberally even when the petitioner has complied with all the conditions
mentioned in Circular dated October 12, 1993. The Legislature has conferred the
power to condone delay to enable the authorities to do substantive justice to the
parties by disposing of the matters on the merits. The expression "genuine" has
received a liberal meaning in view of the law laid down by the apex court referred to
hereinabove and while considering this aspect, the authorities are expected to bear in
mind that ordinarily the applicant, applying for condonation of delay does not stand
to benefit by lodging its claim late. Refusing to condone delay can result in a
meritorious matter being thrown out at the very threshold and cause of justice being
defeated. As against this, when delay is condoned the highest that can happen is that
a cause would be decided on the merits after hearing the parties. When substantial
justice and technical considerations are pitted against each other, the cause of
substantial justice deserves to be preferred for the other side cannot claim to have a
vested right in injustice being done because of a non-deliberate delay. There is no
presumption that delay is occasioned deliberately, or on account of culpable
negligence, or on account of mala fides. A litigant does not stand to benefit by
resorting to delay. In fact he runs a serious risk. The approach of the authorities
should be justice oriented so as to advance the cause of justice. If refund is
legitimately due to the applicant, mere delay should not defeat the claim for refund."

8.14. The Bombay High Court in Pankaj Kailash Agarwal Vrs.
CIT, (2024) 464 ITR 65 (Bom) = 2024 SCC OnLine Bom 1025 made following discussion:
"12. We would agree with Mr. Sarda that no assessee would stand to benefit by
lodging its claim late. More so, in the case of the nature at hand, where the assessee
would get tax advantage/benefit by way of deduction under Section 80-IC of the Act.
Of course, there cannot be a straitjacket formula to determine what is "genuine
hardship".In our view, certainly the fact that an assessee feels that he would be
paying more tax if he does not get the advantage of deduction under Section 80-IC of
the Act, that will be certainly a "genuine hardship". It would be apposite to reproduce
paragraph 4 of the judgment in K.S. Bilawala Vrs. Pr. CIT, (2024) 463 ITR 766 (Bom)
= (2024) 158 taxmann.com 658 (Bom), which reads as under (para 5, page 768 of
463 ITR):
„4. There cannot be a straitjacket formula to determine what is genuine hardship. In
our view, certainly the fact that an assessee feels he has paid more tax than what he
was liable to pay will certainly cause hardship and that will be certainly a „genuine
hardship(cid:128). This court in Optra Health Pvt. Ltd. Vrs. Addl. CIT, (2024) 462 ITR 238
(Bom); 2023 SCC OnLine Bom 2843 = Writ Petition No. 15544 of 2023 and 10 held
as under (page 241 of 462 ITR):
„9. While considering the genuine hardship, the Principal Chief Commissioner of
Income-tax was not expected to consider a solitary ground as to whether the assessee
was prevented by any substantial cause from filing the corrections within a due time.
Other factors also ought to have been taken into account. The phrase "genuine
hardship" used in Section 119(2)(b) of the Act should have been construed liberally.
The Legislature has conferred the power to condone the delay to enable the
authorities to do substantial justice to the parties by disposing of the matters on
merits. The expression "genuine" has received a liberal meaning in view of the law
laid down by the apex court and while considering this aspect, the authorities are
expected to bear in mind that ordinarily the applicant, applying for condonation of
delay, does not stand to benefit by lodging erroneous returns. Refusing to condone
the delay can result in a meritorious matter being thrown out at the very threshold
and the cause of justice being defeated. As against this, when delay is condoned, the
highest that can happen is that a cause would be decided on merits after hearing the
parties. When substantial justice and technical considerations are pitted against each
other, cause of substantial justice deserves to be preferred, for the other side cannot
claim to have vested right in injustice being done because of a non-
deliberate action. There is no presumption that a delay in correcting an error or
responding to a notice of invalid return received under Section 139(9) of the Act is
occasioned deliberately or on account of culpable negligence or on account of mala
fides. A litigant does not stand to benefit by resorting to delay. In fact, he runs a

serious risk. The approach of the authority should be justice-oriented so as to
advance cause of justice. If the case of an applicant is genuine, mere delay should not
defeat the claim. We find support for this view in Sitaldas K. Motwani Vrs. Director
General of Income- tax, (2010) 323 ITR 223 (Bom) = 2009 SCC OnLine Bom 2195,
relied upon by Mr. Walve, where paragraph Nos. 13 to 17 read as under (page 227 of
323 ITR):
„13. Having heard both the parties, we must observe that while considering the
genuine hardship, respondent No. 1 was not expected to consider a solitary ground so
as to whether the petitioner was prevented by any substantial cause from filing return
within due time. Other factors detailed hereinbelow ought to have been taken into
account.
14. The apex court, in the case of B.M. Malani Vrs. CIT, (supra), has explained the
term „genuine(cid:128) in following words (page 207 of 306 ITR):*** „18. The ingredients of
genuine hardship must be determined keeping in view the dictionary meaning
thereof and the legal conspectus attending thereto.
For the said purpose, another well-known principle, namely, a person cannot take advantage of his
own wrong, may also have to be borne in mind.(cid:128) The Gujarat High Court in the case of Gujarat
Electric Co. Ltd.
Vrs. CIT, (2002) 255 ITR 396 (Guj) = 2001 SCC OnLine Guj 331, was pleased to hold as under
(headnote):
„The Board was not justified in rejecting the claim for refund on the ground that a
case of genuine hardship was not made out by the petitioner and delay in claiming
the relief was not satisfactorily explained, more particularly when the returns could
not be filed in time due to the ill health of the officer who was looking after the
taxation matters of the petitioner.(cid:128) The Madras High Court in the case of R.
Seshammal Vrs. ITO, (1999) 237 ITR 185 (Mad) = 1998 SCC OnLine Mad 951, was
pleased to observe as under (page 187 of 237 ITR):
„This is hardly the manner in which the State is expected to deal with the citizens,
who in their anxiety to comply with all the requirements of the Act pay monies as
advance tax to the State, even though the monies were not actually required to be
paid by them and thereafter, seek refund of the monies so paid by mistake after the

15. The phrase „genuine hardship(cid:128) used in Section 119(2)(b) should have been
construed liberally even when the petitioner has complied with all the conditions
mentioned in Circular dated October 12, 1993. The Legislature has conferred the
power to condone delay to enable the authorities to do substantive justice to the
parties by disposing of the matters on merit. The expression „genuine(cid:128) has received a
liberal meaning in view of the law laid down by the apex court referred to
hereinabove and while considering this aspect, the authorities are expected to bear in
mind that ordinarily the applicant, applying for condonation of delay does not stand
to benefit by lodging its claim late. Refusing to condone delay can result in a
meritorious matter being thrown out at the very threshold and cause of justice being
defeated. As against this, when delay is condoned the highest that can happen is that
a cause would be decided on merits after hearing the parties. When substantial
justice and technical considerations are pitted against each other, cause of substantial
justice deserves to be preferred for the other side cannot claim to have vested right in
injustice being done because of a non-deliberate delay. There is no presumption that
delay is occasioned deliberately, or on account of culpable negligence, or on account
of mala fides. A litigant does not stand to benefit by resorting to delay. In fact he runs
a serious risk. The approach of the authorities should be justice-
oriented so as to advance cause of justice. If refund is legitimately due to the applicant, mere delay
should not defeat the claim for refund.
16. Whether the refund claim is correct and genuine, the authority must satisfy itself that the
applicant has a prima facie correct and genuine claim, does not mean that the authority should
examine the merits of the refund claim closely and come to a conclusion that the applicant(cid:128)s claim
is bound to succeed. This would amount to prejudging the case on merits. All that the authority has
to see is that on the face of it the person applying for refund after condonation of delay has a case
which needs consideration and which is not bound to fail by virtue of some apparent defect. At this
stage, the authority is not expected to go deep into the niceties of law. While determining whether
refund claim is correct and genuine, the relevant consideration is whether on the evidence led, it was
possible to arrive at the conclusion in question and not whether that was the only conclusion which
could be arrived at on that evidence.
17. Having said so, turning to the facts of the matter giving rise to the present petition, we are
satisfied that respondent No. 1 did not consider the prayer for condonation of delay in its proper
perspective. As such, it needs consideration afresh.(cid:128)
10. This was followed by this court in Artist Tree (P.) Ltd. Vrs. CBDT, (2014) 369 ITR 691 (Bom) =
2014 SCC OnLine Bom 1801 = (2014) 52 taxmann.com 152 (Bom) relied upon by Mr. Walve, where
paragraph Nos.19, 21 and 23 read as under (page 701 of 369 ITR):
„19. The circumstance that the accounts were duly audited way back on September
14, 1997, is not a circumstance that can be held against the petitioner. This
circumstance, on the contrary adds force to the explanation furnished by the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/149382458/ 33
Action Research For Health And vs Central Board Of Direct Taxes (Cbdt) on 25 April, 2025
petitioner that the delay in filing of returns was only on account of misplacement or
the TDS certificates, which the petitioner was advised, has to be necessarily filed
along with the return of income in view of the provisions contained in Section 139 of
the said Act read along with the Income-tax Rules, 1962 and in particular the report
in the prescribed forms of return of income then in vogue which required an assessee
to attach the TDS certificates for the refund being claimed. The explanation furnished
is that on account of shifting of registered office, it is possible that TDS certificates
which may have been addressed to the earlier office, got misplaced. There is nothing
counterfeit or bogus in the explanation offered. It cannot be said that the petitioner
has obtained any undue advantage out of delay in filing of Income-tax returns. As
observed in the case of Sitaldas K. Motwani Vrs. Director General of Income-tax,
(2010) 323 ITR 223 (Bom) = 2009 SCC OnLine Bom 2195, there is no presumption
that delay is occasioned deliberately or on account of culpable negligence or on
account of mala fides. It cannot be said that in this case the petitioner has benefited
by resorting to delay. In any case when substantial justice and technical
consideration are pitted against each other, the cause of substantial justice deserves
to prevail without in any manner doing violence to the language of the Act. ***"
8.15. As it appears the Commissioner of Income Tax proceeded with closed mind and
his approach to the issue at hand has been misdirected as if Circular dated
09.06.2015 is still in vogue. The reason ascribed by the petitioner before the
Authority is that it could not come down from Patnagarh in the district of Bolangir to
Bhubaneswar to consult Chartered Accountant and the Organisation was functioning
with limited staff strength during pandemic. Such factors would be embraced within
the fold of ―genuine hardship(cid:130) so as to entitle it to have discretion utilised in its
favour.
8.16. The Commissioner of Income Tax has misplaced the ratio of judgment rendered
by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Union of India Vrs. Dilip Kumar & Co., (2018) 9
SCC 1 for disallowing the exemption claimed by the petitioner, Charitable trust,
under Section 12A of the IT Act read with Rule 17B of the IT Rules. The cause shown
by the petitioner for delay in filing Audit Report in Form 10B was "force majeure"--
Covid-19 pandemic.
8.17. This Court is not oblivious of the clarification of the Central Government to treat
COVID-19 pandemic as force majeure. The issue of Office Memorandum bearing
No.F.18/4/2020-PPD, dated 19.02.2020 is sufficient indicator for necessity to invoke
force majeure clause. The Office Memorandum stands thus:
"No.F.18/4/2020-PPD Government of India Ministry of Finance Department of
Expenditure Procurement Policy Division Room No.512, Lok Nayak Bhavan, New
Delhi dated the 19th February, 2020.

Office Memorandum Subject: Force Majeure Clause (FMC) Attention is invited to
para 9.7.7 of the „Manual for Procurement of Goods, 2017(cid:128) issued by this
Department, which is reproduced as under:
A Force Majeure (FM) means extraordinary events or circumstance beyond human
control such as an event described as an act of God (like a natural calamity) or events
such as a war, strike, riots, crimes (but not including negligence or wrong-doing,
predictable! seasonal rain and any other events specifically excluded in the clause).
An FM clause in the contract frees both parties from contractual liability or obligation
when prevented by such events from fulfilling their obligations under the contract.
An FM clause does not excuse a party(cid:128)s non-performance entirely, but only suspends
it for the duration of the FM. The firm has to give notice of FM as soon as it occurs
and it cannot be claimed ex-post facto. There may be a FM situation affecting the
purchase organisation only. In such a situation, the purchase organisation is to
communicate with the supplier along similar lines as above for further necessary
action. If the performance in whole or in part or any obligation under this contract is
prevented or delayed by any reason of FM for a period exceeding 90 (Ninety) days,
either party may at its option terminate the contract without any financial
repercussion on either side.
2. A doubt has arisen if the disruption of the supply chains due to spread of corona
virus in China or any other country will be covered in the Force Majeure Clause
(FMC). In this regard it is clarified that it should be considered as a case of natural
calamity and FMC may be invoked, wherever considered appropriate, following the
due procedure as above.

8.18. Reference in this regard may be had to Dhanarajamal Govindram Vrs. Shamji Kalidas & Co.,
AIR 1961 SC 1285 = (1961) 3 SCR 1020, wherein it has been described that, "McCardie, J. in
Lebeaupin Vrs. Crispin, (1920) 2 KB 714 has given an account of what is meant by "force majeure",
with reference to its history. The expression "force majeure" is not a mere French version of the
Latin expression "vis major". It is undoubtedly a term of wider import. Difficulties have arisen in the
past as to what could legitimately be included in "force majeure". Judges have agreed that strikes,
breakdown of machinery, which, though normally not included in "vis major" are included in "force
majeure". An analysis of rulings on the subject into which it is not necessary in this case to go, shows
that where reference is made to "force majeure", the intention is to save the performing party from
the consequences of anything over which he has no control. This is the widest meaning that can be
given to "force majeure", and even if this be the meaning, it is obvious that the condition about
"force majeure" in the agreement was not vague. The use of the word "usual" makes all the
difference, and the meaning of the condition may be made certain by evidence about a force majeure
clause, which was in contemplation of parties."

extend to five lakh rupees.
3A. Cognizance, investigation and trial of offences.--
Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974),--
(i) an offence punishable under sub-section (2) or sub-section (3) of Section 3 shall be cognizable
and non-bailable;
(ii) any case registered under sub-section (2) or sub-section (3) of Section 3 shall be investigated by

adjournment of the same beyond the following day to be necessary for reasons to be recorded, and
an endeavor shall be made to ensure that the inquiry or trial is concluded within a period of one
year:
Provided that where the trial is not concluded within the said period, the Judge shall
record the reasons for not having done so:
Provided further that the said period may be extended by such further period, for
reasons to be recorded in writing, but not exceeding six months at a time."
8.20. This apart, in the Disaster Management Act, 2005, the following relevant
provisions are found:

8.22. The Central Board of Direct Taxes have extensively relaxed the datelines for compliance of
different provisions under the IT Act read with rules framed thereunder for COVID-19-related
expenses, it has treated the pandemic as a significant disruption akin to force majeure. These
measures were tailored to address specific challenges rather than invoking a blanket force majeure
clause. Noticeably Circular No. 8/2021 has extended the period for filing returns for the Assessment
Year 2020-21 under Section 139 of the IT Act. Said Circular reads thus:
"F. No.225/49/2021/ITA-II Government of India Ministry of Finance Department of

in respect of Income-tax compliances by the taxpayers:

(Ravinder Maini) Director to the Government of India."
8.23. With the above factual scenario, taking note of functioning of office of the petitioner with
restricted staff and constraints of movement, the reason ascribed by the assessee seems to be
plausible to comprehend within the ken of ―genuine hardship(cid:130).
8.24. Under the aforesaid premise, in the teeth of Circular No.16/2024, dated 18.11.2024 issued by
the Central Board of Direct Taxes superseding Circular dated 09.06.2015, glaring flaw is perceived
on the face of the Order dated 17.02.2025 of the Commissioner of Income Tax (Exemptions).
Conclusion:
9. Since the petitioner was required to file the Audit Report in Form 10B in terms of
Section 12A of the IT Act read with Rule 17B of the IT Rules on or before 15.01.2021
with respect to the Assessment Year 2020-21, but the same was filed on 31.03.2021
with a delay of seventy-six days, the same would be treated to be filed within the
period stipulated under the Circular No.16/2024, dated 18.11.2024 and taking cue
from the observations made in Basanti Shial Vrs. Proper Officer, (2022) 106 GSTR
419 = 2022 SCC OnLine Ori 4150 and Atlas PVC Pipes Limited Vrs. State of Odisha,
(2022) 106 GSTR 433 (Ori) = 2022 SCC OnLine Ori 2182 referring to extension of
period of limitation as considered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Suo Motu Writ
Petition (C) No.3 of 2020, this Court is of the considered view that sufficient cause
has been shown that the petitioner had ―genuine hardship(cid:130) in complying with the
statutory requirement. Therefore, it is warranted to be observed that the application
for condonation of delay of seventy-six days in filing Audit Report in Form 10B
should have received liberal consideration and instead of showing pedantic approach
the Commissioner of Income Tax ought to have been more pragmatic.
9.1. The Commissioner of Income Tax (Exemptions) having not appreciated the
factual aspect in proper perspective and relying on Circular of the year 2015, which
has been superseded by Circular dated 18.11.2024, the Order dated 17.02.2025
cannot be said to have passed in consonance with the factual and legal position as
discussed hereinabove. Having not perceived the genuine hardship of the petitioner
in right earnest, the Commissioner of Income Tax (Exemptions) appears not to have
applied his conscientious discretion to the fact-
situation of the matter.
9.2. Considering the reasons assigned by the petitioner which prevented it from complying with
statutory requirement, the Order dated 17.02.2025 passed by the Commissioner of Income Tax is
liable to be set aside.

10. Ergo, finding that there was ―genuine hardship(cid:130) faced by the petitioner during the relevant
period and the refusal to condoning the delay invoking power under Section 119(2) of the IT Act
being arbitrary exercise of discretion to the fact-situation, Order dated 17.02.2025 passed by the
Commissioner of Income Tax (Exemption), Hyderabad-opposite party No.2 (Annexure-1) is hereby
set aside.
10.1. In consequence thereof, the Commissioner of Income Tax (Exemptions)-opposite party No.2 is
directed to grant all consequential relief to the petitioner by taking into account the Audit Report in
Form 10B pertaining to the Assessment Year 2020-21 submitted on 31.03.2021, as if the same is
filed within period specified invoking Section 119(2)(b) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
10.2. Accordingly, the Order dated 30.11.2021 raising demand of Rs.22,01,930/- for the Assessment
Year 2020-21 vide intimation under Section 143 does require modification, after examination of the
merit the Audit Report in Form 10B furnished under Section 12A of the IT Act read with Rule 17B of
the IT Rules.
10.3. The matter is remitted to the Commissioner of Income Tax (Exemptions) to examine the merit
of Audit Report in Form 10B prescribed under Rule 17B of the IT Rules with reference to returns
filed under Section 139 of the IT Act and modify the intimation under Section 143 (Annexure-2)
accordingly.
11. With the observation made supra and directions issued, the writ petition stands disposed of, but
there shall be no order as to costs.
12. As a result of the disposal of the writ petition, all pending interlocutory applications, if any, shall
stand disposed of.
