i.e., Baba Ghulam Shah Badshah University Act, 2002. The respondent no. 1 is governed by the
University Grants Commission (UGC). In the matter of appointment of faculty, the respondent no. 1
is statutorily obligated to be subject to the regulations issued by the UGC from time to time. In terms
of the UGC notification F.3-1/2009 issued under section 26(1) (e) & (g) of the University Grants
Commission Act, 1953 laying down the University Grants Commission (Minimum Qualification for
Appointment of Teachers and other Academic Staff in Universities and Colleges and others
Measures for the Maintenance of Standards in Higher Education) Regulation, 2010, with respect to
the Assistant Professor the Pay-Band of Rs. 15600-39100 with Academic Grade-Pay of Rs. 6000/-

its faculty of Assistant Professor.
The petitioner came to be appointed as Assistant Professor (Nursing) in the year 2016 pursuant an

out an amendment with respect to the prescribed Pay-Scale of Assistant Professor as mandated by
the UGC Regulations. The petitioner came to be appointed as Assistant Professor with Scale-1 of Rs.
9300-34800 with Grade Pay of Rs. 4800/-.
It is pleaded in the writ petition that before joining as Assistant Professor in the faculty of the
respondent no. 1, the petitioner had registered objection of the splitting of the Assistant Professor's
Pay-Scale of the post to the respondent no. 1 being contrary to the rules and regulations of the UGC
and as such did not waive off his right to earn the Pay-Scale as per the regulations of the UGC. The
petitioner further pleads that in fact previous to the order of selection of the petitioner in the faculty
of the respondent no. 1, the appointment of the faculty of the Assistant Professor in the respondent
no.1 used to be at the Pay-scale as prescribed by the UGC, as is born out from the advertisement
dated 12.12.2015 accompanying the writ petition as annexure-I where there is no such split
Pay-Scale provided to the post of Assistant Professor.
The petitioner is seeking intervention of this Court through the medium of this writ petition to
correct the said anomaly so obtaining with respect to the Pay-Scale of Assistant Professor in the
respondent no. 1.
Prima facie case is made out.
