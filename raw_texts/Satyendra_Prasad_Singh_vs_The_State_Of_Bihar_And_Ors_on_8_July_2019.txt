ORAL JUDGMENT
Date : 08-07-2019
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
In this case, the petitioner is claiming that he should be
inducted in the old pensionary scheme and wrongly he has been
adjusted in the new pensionary scheme taking a plea that certain
persons, who are below in the merit list, have been given the
benefit of old pensionary scheme and non-granting same benefit to
the petitioner reflects an act of arbitrariness and discriminatory
approach towards the petitioner who belongs to same
homogeneous group.

Satyendra Prasad Singh vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 8 July, 2019
On the basis of requisition sent by the District
Administration, Aurangabad, the Bihar Public Service
Patna High Court CWJC No.18273 of 2017 dt.08-07-2019
2/5
Commission (hereinafter to be referred to as 'the Commission')
has issued Advertisement No. 39 of 1998 for the appointment of
Class-3 post inviting application from the interested person having
requisite qualification. Accordingly, the petitioner along with
others applied against the vacancy published and the petitioner
was called upon to appear in the written examination which he has
done successfully, accordingly, the result was published. The
Commission published the result of the successful candidates on
16.01.2003
(Annexure-2), recommended the name of the persons for the purpose of appointment on Class-3
post. The name of the petitioner was at serial no.32. Large number of persons below to the
petitioner in the merit list, were recommended, accordingly, appointed as Class-3 post on 24.1.2004
(Annexure-4).
It will be relevant to state that the persons in the merit list at serial no. 39, 51, 55, 57, 60, 61, 63, 52,
53, 49, 54, 56, 62 and 63 were handed over the appointment on 24.1.2004 but, the petitioner was
unfortunate to receive the appointment letter appointment which compelled the petitioner to
approach this court in C.W.J.C. No. 5025 of 2004. During pendency of that writ application, the
District Administration issued appointment letter in favour of the petitioner on 18.3.2006 and,
accordingly, the petitioner joined the service on 24.3.2006. The new pension Patna High Court
CWJC No.18273 of 2017 dt.08-07-2019 scheme has been introduced on and after 1.9.2005, as the
joining of the petitioner is after the cut-off date, he has been offered the benefit under new
Pensionary Scheme and, those who have been appointed before the cut-off date, they have been
granted the benefit of old pension scheme.
Learned counsel for the petitioner has raised a grievance that the petitioner and others who are
below in the merit list applied against the same advertisement, appeared in the same written
examination along with petitioner and, on being succeeded, have been appointed as Class-3
employee. Admittedly, the name of the petitioner is at serial no.32 and this Court has already
mentioned some of the persons in serial number, as stated above, are below in the merit list who
have been granted the benefit of old pension scheme as they entered into service prior to the

petitioner, that has compelled the petitioner to approach this Court in the present case. The
petitioner was selected as Class-3 employee in same transaction along with others before the cut-off
date of enforcement of new pension scheme, in such event, merely for administrative lapse, the
petitioner was not issued appointment letter but, that has been given after the enforcement of the
pensionary scheme, will not deprive him to claim parity with the persons who are below in the merit
list. As non-granting the Patna High Court CWJC No.18273 of 2017 dt.08-07-2019 identical benefit
at par with others, would lead to invidious discrimination. The petitioner was not appointed along
with others on account of administrative lapses. The petitioner cannot be deprived better
pensionary benefit.
In the counter affidavit, the State has only taken a plea of date of appointment of the petitioner after
1.9.2005 but, has not given an answer as to why the petitioner was deprived of the benefit of
appointment and forcing him to approach to the writ court and, only thereafter, when they could
know that it will be futile to resist the writ petition, the petitioner was granted the benefit of
appointment.
In that view of the matter, this Court is of the view that the petitioner should be treated at par with
the persons who are below in the merit list and, accordingly, the writ of mandamus is issued that the
petitioner should also be granted the pensionary benefit under the old pensionary scheme alike
others who are below in the merit list.
The petitioner has pointed out that the same incident was also taken place with other persons in
different district and this Court has granted the benefit of shifting of date of appointment to those
persons who are below in the merit list.
Patna High Court CWJC No.18273 of 2017 dt.08-07-2019 Let the authority should examine that if
other persons in other places having been granted shifting of date of appointment, in that
circumstances, the petitioner should also be given identical relief but, it is made clear that if the date
of appointment is re- shifted, the same will be notional benefit only.
In the result, this writ application stands allowed to the extent indicated above.
