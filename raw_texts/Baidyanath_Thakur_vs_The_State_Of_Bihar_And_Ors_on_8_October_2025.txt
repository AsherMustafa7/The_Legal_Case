. It is submitted by learned counsel for the petitioners that due to developments which have taken
place during pendency of the instant application, he is not pressing prayer nos.1(i) and 1(iii) of the
writ application. The instant application is confined to prayer no.1(ii) which is for a direction to the
respondent authorities to give the benefit of first and second Assured Career Progression ('ACP' in
short) scheme with effect from 9.8.1999 as per Notification no.4685 dated 25.6.2003 of the Finance
Department, Government of Bihar.
5. The case of the petitioners in brief is that the Patna High Court CWJC No.3915 of 2012
dt.08-10-2025 original petitioner was appointed as a Superior Field Worker on 13.10.1960 and
retired from service on 31.1.2000 while working as Basic Health Worker in the Primary Health
Centre at Masahari in Muzaffarpur. He was granted the first time bound promotion with effect from
1.4.1981 which however was wrongly shifted to 16.5.1984. Further the second time bound promotion
granted to him was cancelled and certain amounts were adjusted against his post retiral dues.
6. The above actions of the respondents led to the petitioner filing CWJC no.690 of 2005 which was
allowed by order dated 7.12.2009.
7. It is further case of the petitioner that though he was given the benefit of first ACP vide order
dated 30.4.2005 with effect from 9.8.1999 but the benefits thereof have still not been paid and

further he has not received the grant of second ACP. All this has led to filing of the instant writ
application for the reliefs as stated herein above.
8. It is submitted by learned counsel for the respondents that while making the claim for grant of
benefits of ACP, the petitioner has not approached this Court with clean hands as he did not make
the prayer for grant of ACP in the writ application filed by him in the year 2005. The said writ Patna
High Court CWJC No.3915 of 2012 dt.08-10-2025 application was confined only with respect to the
grievance of the time bound promotion and recovery of the excess amount.
9. It is submitted by learned counsel appearing for the respondents that the petitioner was
appointed as a Superior Field Worker in 1960 and subsequently under a policy decision of the
government it was decided to adjust all the working hands under the programme in the regular
service of the Health Department as Basic Health Worker. Accordingly, the petitioner's service was
absorbed by order dated 16.5.1974. With respect to grant of ACP it was submitted that by order
dated 30.4.2005 the petitioner was granted the benefit of first ACP with effect from 9.8.1999. As in
the service period the petitioner got regular promotion in the higher scale as Basic Health Worker,
the petitioner is not entitled for second ACP. In view of these facts, it was submitted that there is no
merit in the instant application so far as grant of benefits of second ACP to the petitioner is
concerned and the writ application be dismissed.
10. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the materials on record.
11. The relevant facts in brief are that the petitioner was appointed as a Superior Field Worker in the
year 1960 under the Malaria Eradication Programme, a programme Patna High Court CWJC
No.3915 of 2012 dt.08-10-2025 sponsored by the government. Some time before 1974 the said
programme was closed and as per policy decision of the Government it was decided to adjust all the
working hands under the programme in the regular service of the Health Department as Basic
Health Worker. Accordingly, the petitioner's service was absorbed vide order dated 16.5.1974.
12. The contention of the respondents for not granting the benefits of second ACP to petitioner is
that the petitioner having got regular promotion in his service period as Basic Health Worker, he
was not entitled for the same.
13. As against the aforesaid stand of the respondents, it would be relevant to quote the relevant
portion of the order dated 7.12.2009 passed in CWJC no.690 of 2005 which is as follows :-
"Accordingly, it is that the absorption/adjustment of the petitioner from the post of
Superior Field Worker, upon abolition of the Programme, to the post of Basic Health
Worker by order dated 16.5.1974 was not a promotion."
14. This Court having held that on abolition of the programme the absorption/adjustment of the
petitioner on the post of Basic Health Worker not being a promotion, the contention raised by the
respondents stands clearly answered.
