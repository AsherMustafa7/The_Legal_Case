SINHA, ACJ.
1. The appeals have been preferred against judgment dated 5 th December, 2024 made by the
learned single Judge in several writ petitions. On 13th March, 2025 Mr. Acharya, learned senior
advocate, Advocate General appearing on behalf of appellants (State) requested us to hold appeal
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123252063/ 14
State Of Odisha And Others vs Bisheshawar Biswal And Others on 25 March, 2025
brief in W.A. no.3321 of 2024 (State of Odisha and others v. Bisheshwar Biswal and others). He
submitted, respondents had urged age relaxation, obtained by them on impugned judgment in
respect of recruitment advertised on 22nd September, 2024, pursuant to Odisha Battalion Service
[(Method of Recruitment and Conditions of Service of Sepoys or Constables, Havildars and ASI
(Armed) Order, 2022].
2. He drew our attention to recital in the order saying that it was made in exercise of powers
conferred by section-2 in Police Act, 1861. It was not in exercise of power under article-309 of the
Constitution. Definitions paragraph-2 provides for 'recruitment year' under clause- (i). He laid
emphasis that the meaning given is calendar year, during which advertisement for recruitment is
actually issued. Paragraph-3 gives constitution of the service, to consist of three posts. Paragraph-5
provides for eligibility criteria on recruitment. Clause- (e) under the paragraph is the eligibility on
age of candidates. Upper age limit is 23 years as on 1st day of January of the year, in which the
advertisement for recruitment is issued. Hence, reckoning of age of candidates pursuant to the
advertisement dated 22nd September, 2024 would be upper age limit of 23 years as on 1st January,
2024. He also drew our attention to paragraph-21 on relaxation as provided therein. The paragraph
is reproduced below.
"21. Relaxation - Where the Government on a reference made by the Director General
and Inspector General of Police or otherwise, are satisfied that it is necessary or
expedient so to do in the public interest, it may by order, for reasons to be recorded
in writing, relax any of the provisions of these Order in respect of any class or
category of employees."
(emphasis supplied)
3. He then pointed out, there exists Orissa Civil Service (Fixation of Upper Age Limit) Rules, 1989
notified on 27th October, 1989. Upper age limit for entry into Government service provided by rule
2 carries a proviso. The proviso is reproduced below.
"2. ... ... ...
Provided that only for Odisha Civil Service Combined Competitive Examinations, if
for any reason applications have not been invited by the competent authority to
conduct examination during any particular year to fill up the vacancies of the year,
applicants, who would have been eligible if applications were invited during that
year, shall be eligible to compete at the examination held in the subsequent year."
He submitted, the recruitment contemplated by said advertisement dated 22nd September, 2024 is
for entry into the uniformed force. It is not and cannot be called a civil service. Furthermore, the
rules contemplate annual recruitment and in that context the proviso under above rule.
4. Mr. Acharya submitted, the learned single Judge provided headings in the judgment. He placed
from paragraph-6 under heading 'examination of the legal matrix'. He submitted, several
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123252063/ 15
State Of Odisha And Others vs Bisheshawar Biswal And Others on 25 March, 2025
declarations of law made by the Supreme Court were discussed. He then pointed out from
paragraph-16 in impugned judgment, it carries clear finding that aforesaid rules are not applicable
to police recruitment. The order of 2022 was also found to be valid and comprehensive, to occupy
legislative field for the current recruitment. The learned Judge went on to say, no other rules,
including Orissa Civil Service (Fixation of Upper Age Limit) Rules, 1989 can override its provisions.
He then placed paragraph-24 and conclusion paragraphs-25 to 29 in impugned judgment to submit,
the learned single Judge thereafter erred in law to give direction for revision of the advertisement by
issuance of corrigendum. On query made regarding whether the order provides for exercise of
discretion, Mr. Acharya's answer was in the negative.
5. On 20th March, 2025 Ms. Rath, learned senior advocate appeared on behalf of intervenors in
W.P.(C) no.26079 of 2024 dealt with by impugned judgment, in common with other writ petitions.
W.A. no.3321 of 2024 arises out of said writ petition and, as aforesaid, is one of many appeals
preferred against said judgment.
6. She submitted, the relaxation granted by the learned single Judge must be seen as a direction
made in terms of paragraph-21 in the 2022 order. Use of the word 'employees' in said paragraph has
to be read as 'candidates'. She submitted, part-A of the order is all about candidates. In part-B
dealing with promotion, word 'candidates' has also been used. Hence, the enabling relaxation
paragraph-21 in the order must apply to candidates.
7. On query she submitted, her clients had also filed their substantive writ petition W.P.(C)
no.25203 of 2024. In paragraph 6, the point was taken. Said paragraph is reproduced below.
"6. That Clause 21 of the 2022 order also gives power to the state to grant relaxation
to any criteria including age."
There was no denial in the counter filed by State. Paragraph-15 in impugned judgment took note of
this contention of her clients.
8. She relied on judgment of the Supreme Court in State of Maharashtra v. Prabhu, reported in
(1994) 2 SCC 481 paragraph-4. She submitted, the Supreme Court discussed construction placed by
the High Court, to interfere with order of the Government in exercise of its equity jurisdiction. The
Supreme Court said, one of the principles inherent in exercise of equity jurisdiction for issuance of
certiorari and mandamus is that the exercise of power should be for the sake of justice. It was so
done by the learned single Judge. There be no interference in appeal as impugned judgment is a
good one, on facts and in law.
9. Next date of hearing was 24th March, 2025. Mr. Bahali, learned advocate appeared on behalf of
respondents in W.A. no.3385 of 2024 (State of Odisha and others v. Laxmidhar Jena and others).
He straightaway drew our attention to impugned judgment dated 5th December, 2024, paragraphs
13, 17 to 20, 24 and 25. He laid emphasis on decision of the Supreme Court in High Court of Delhi v.
Devina Sharma reported in (2022) 4 SCC 643.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123252063/ 16
State Of Odisha And Others vs Bisheshawar Biswal And Others on 25 March, 2025
10. Moving on to notification dated 13th September, 2022 carrying the order of 2022 he pointed out
to paragraph-5 giving eligibility criteria for recruitment, as made subject to other provisions in the
order. He clarified, his submission is in the alternative that, if we sustain contention and argument
made by Ms. Rath, then the eligibility criteria being subject to paragraph-21, will add to it. He
submitted further, under clause (c) in paragraph 5, there is relaxation contemplated in respect of
reserve candidates. Exceptional circumstances of COVID-19 should also allow the relaxation in
favour of his clients. He next referred to paragraph-8 in the order to submit that clause- (1)
thereunder would indicate annual recruitment process.
11. Mr. Bahali handed up a brief of orders made by the Supreme Court in Writ Petition (C) no.183 of
2013 (Manish Kumar v. Union of India and others) and Petition for Special Leave to Appeal (C)
no.12569 of 2018 (Rajendra Singh and others v. The State of U.P. and others). Included in the brief
were orders made in W.P.(C) (PIL) no.6622 of 2019, pending in this Court pursuant to final order
dated 11th March, 2019 made in Manish Kumar (supra). Copies of the orders were made over to Mr.
Kar, learned advocate, Government Advocate assisting Mr. Acharya. Lastly, Mr. Bahali relied on
internal communication dated 5th July 2021, text of which is reproduced below.
"Inviting reference to the proposal of State Police Headquarters on the subject cited
above, I am directed to say that Government have been pleased to relax the
provisions of Rule 4 of Odisha Police Service (Method of Recruitment and Conditions
of Service of Constables) Order, 2010 read with Rule 3 of Odisha Police Service
(Method of Recruitment and Conditions of Service of Constables) Amendment Order,
2013 to fill up of 100% vacancies in the rank of Constables in the districts for the year
2021 on one time basis, by way of redeployment instead of 20% in view of the urgent
need of strengthening Civil Police during COVID-19 pandemic situation."
12. Mr. Rath, learned advocate appeared on behalf of respondents in W.A. no.3464 of 2024. He
drew attention to paragraph 8 in the 2022 order. He submitted, the vacancies have been provided
for as existing and anticipated. Existing vacancies in a calendar year would include vacancies arisen
in the period no recruitment was conducted. There has been no recruitment since year 2018. In
considering the existing vacancies the learned single Judge had directed one time relaxation of
upper age limit by six years reckoned from year 2018. This reasoning cannot be interfered with
because it is based on paragraph 8(1) of the 2022 order itself. He moved on to the relaxation
provision by paragraph
21. He pointed out, there is separation in providing for relaxation, between class and category of
employees. The order constitutes part-A and part-B. Part-A relates to candidates as a class and part
B is in respect of promotion and therefore applicable to the categories of employees. As such the
paragraph empowers relaxation being made. Even otherwise than on equity, there be confirmation
of impugned judgment on the direction for relaxation.
13. With reference to article 309 in the Constitution of India Mr. Rath submitted, where in case of a
State there is no rule, it is competent for the Executive to issue an order. In event Court is inclined to
accept contention of appellant that the 2022 order does not provide for relaxation then so far as this

State Of Odisha And Others vs Bisheshawar Biswal And Others on 25 March, 2025
aspect of relaxation regarding a recruitment requirement of eligibility on age is concerned, there is a
gap and it is competent for the State to issue an order. He relied on aforesaid internal
communication dated 5th July, 2021 handed up by Mr. Bahali to submit, there be direction for
issuance of such an order upon reliance of upper age relaxation of six years, as directed in impugned
judgment. He then relied on judgment of the Supreme Court in A.B. Krishna v. State of Karnataka,
reported in (1998) 3 SCC 495, paragraph 8. A passage from the paragraph is reproduced below.
"8. ... ... As a matter of fact, under the scheme of Article 309 of the Constitution, once
a legislature intervenes to enact a law regulating the conditions of service, the power
of the Executive, including the President or the Governor, as the case may be, is
totally displaced on the principle of "doctrine of occupied field". If, however, any
matter is not touched by that enactment, it will be competent for the Executive to
either issue executive instructions or to make a rule under Article 309 in respect of
that matter."
He also relied on view taken by a learned single Judge of this Court by judgment dated 24th
January, 2023 in three writ petitions, lead case being W.P.(C) no.341 of 2023 (Nagen Bhoi and
others v. State of Odisha and others). The learned single Judge had directed one time relaxation in
upper age limit for recruitment of constables (civil) in different districts and establishments of
Odisha Police. He relied on paragraphs 51 to 54 of the judgment.
14. Mr. Rath submitted, his clients are in a situation, or at least most of them, who never ever had
opportunity to apply to be appointed in the class contemplated under part-A in the order of 2022.
He reiterated, there was no recruitment since year 2018. Therefore, a person eligible on age to
compete for recruitment in year 2018, would be over age in the exercise undertaken pursuant to the
order of 2022. As such he thus would be discriminated against by the State in only allowing people
younger than him to compete for recruitment, in violation of article 14 in the Constitution of India.
He added to his point of discrimination by submitting that such a person deprived will stand
deprived as against a person, who will be allowed to compete for existing vacancies occurring in the
long period, in which his client never had opportunity to compete for being recruited. It is therefore
that the learned single Judge, in public interest, directed the one time relaxation.
15. He handed up notification dated 4th September, 2021 published by authority on 4th September,
2021 in the Odisha Gazette Extraordinary. It is Odisha Police Service (Method of Recruitment and
Conditions of Service of Constables) Order, 2021. Paragraph-17 in the order is the same relaxation
clause as appears in paragraph-21 in the 2022 order. He submitted, in Nagen Bhoi (supra)
paragraph-42 onwards, the learned single Judge dealt with relaxation paragraph-17 in the 2021
order. State accepted the judgment on no appeal preferred. Advertisement dated 22nd September,
2024 is in respect of sepoys/constables in the armed battalion, separate from police constables
deputed for policing civil society. The relaxation clauses being same and State having had accepted
view taken in Nagen Bhoi (supra), it cannot now turn around and oppose the relaxation in respect of
the 2022 order. His clients stand on same footing as Nagen Bhoi and others. They are only about
280 of them who had qualified in the written examination, they took pursuant to interim order
granted in the writ petitions.

16. We had on 24th March, 2025 made observation for State to consider granting relaxation, not as
compelled by direction on adjudication, but by themselves.
17. Today Mr. Acharya in reply relies upon on several decisions of the Supreme Court and a view
taken by us for purpose of reliance on further decisions of said Court.
(i) Raghunath Rai Bareja v. Punjab National Bank, reported in (2007) 2 SCC 230, paragraph-29,
reproduced below.
"Learned counsel for the respondent Bank submitted that it will be very unfair if the
appellant who is a guarantor of the loan, and Director of the Company which took the
loan, avoid paying the debt. While we fully agree with the learned counsel that equity
is wholly in favour of the respondent Bank, since obviously a bank should be allowed
to recover its debts, we must, however, state that it is well settled that when there is a
conflict between law and equity, it is the law which has to prevail, in accordance with
the Latin maxim „dura lex sed lex", which means "the law is hard, but it is the law".
Equity can only supplement the law, but it cannot supplant or override it."
He submits, after the learned single Judge having had held that the 2022 order has primacy, there
was no scope for any direction being made on consideration of equity.
(ii) Dr. Amilal Bhat v. State of Rajasthan, reported in (1997) 6 SCC 614, paragraphs 10 and 11.
He submits, the Supreme Court declared that it cannot be said that a person, who was eligible on
age to apply for a vacancy, when arisen can thereafter claim age relaxation on the recruitment notice
having been delayed, unless mala fide was demonstrated on causing the delay.
(iii) State of Uttar Pradesh v. Vikash Kumar Singh, reported in (2022) 1 SCC 347, paragraph 7.1.
Mr. Acharya submits, reliance on this judgment is his contention in the alternative. Relaxation
paragraph 21 in the order of 2022 does not enable relaxation. The Supreme Court in the case had
considered a rule, where there was discretion on the authority, to relax. Even in such a case the
Supreme Court said that the relaxation is at discretion of the competent authority. It cannot be
prayed for as a matter of right. If a conscious decision is taken not to grant the relaxation, merely
because the rule permits relaxation, writ of mandamus cannot be issued directing the competent
authority to grant relaxation.
(iv) Rachna v. Union of India, reported in (2021) 5 SCC 638, paragraphs 38, 39 and 45.
He submits, fixing the age limit is a policy decision. No discrimination can be urged on the age
factor. In the judgment the Supreme Court was dealing with similar claim of persons affected by
COVID-19. Said Court declared that a Court is called upon to consider validity of a policy decision
only when a challenge is made that the policy decision infringes fundamental rights guaranteed by
the Constitution or any other statutory right. Merely because as a matter of policy, in that case, first
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123252063/ 19
State Of Odisha And Others vs Bisheshawar Biswal And Others on 25 March, 2025
respondent had granted relaxation in the past on reason there was a change in the examination
pattern/syllabus, no assistance can be claimed by petitioners in seeking mandamus, to come out
with policy granting relaxation to them as had appeared in the examination.
(v) Our judgment dated 11th March, 2025 in, inter alia, W.A. no.62 of 2025 (Choudhury Saubhagya
Mohan Das v. State of Odisha and others), paragraph 11 for reliance by him on judgments of the
Supreme Court, relied upon in that case.
(a) Chief Manager, Punjab National Bank v. Anit Kumar Das, reported in (2021) 12 SCC 80,
paragraph 17.3 where the Supreme Court declared that it is for the employer to determine and
decide relevancy and suitability of the qualifications for any post and it is not for the Court to
consider and assess.
(b) Maharashtra Public Service Commission v. Sandeep Shriram Warade, reported in (2019) 6 SCC
362, paragraph-9. In that case the Supreme Court said it is for the employer who is best suited to
decide the requirements a candidate must possess according to needs of the employer and nature of
work.
18. Mr. Acharya submits, the direction for granting age relaxation of six years to be incorporated on
corrigendum issued to advertisement dated 22nd September, 2024 could not have been made on
equitable considerations as law stands settled that fixing of age limit is a policy decision. The
advertisement is not under challenge. There has been no demonstration of breach of any
fundamental right by fixation of the policy. The recruitment is for existing vacancies. It is pursuant
to the order of 2022, duly made in exercise of power under section 2 in Police Act, 1861. Interference
in appeal with the direction by impugned judgment is necessary as otherwise a wrong precedent will
be set.
19. Without prejudice to his submissions in prosecuting the appeal, at this stage Mr. Acharya hands
up his instruction of date issued by Special Secretary to Government, Home (D & A) Department in
Government of Odisha. He submits, it is pursuant to observation earlier made by us. Text of the
instruction is reproduced below.
"I am directed to inform you that, a High Level Meeting was held under the
Chairmanship of the Hon(cid:129)ble C.M. in the presence of Advocate General, Odisha,
Chief Secretary, Odisha, ACS, Home Department, DGP, Odisha, Chairman, State
Selection Board and others.
It was decided that as a onetime benevolent measure in the larger interest of the
candidates who had applied for the post of Constables and Sepoys in Battalions
pursuant to the Advertisement No.02/SSB, dt. 22.09.2024 before the date of making
applications and have appeared in the written examination will be given three years
upper age limit relaxation in respective categories of candidates as prescribed in
Method of Recruitment and Conditions of Services of Sepoys, Constables, Havildars
and ASI (Armed) Order, 2022 Vide Notification No.30941/D & A, Dt.13.09.2022 of

State Of Odisha And Others vs Bisheshawar Biswal And Others on 25 March, 2025
Home Department, Govt. of Odisha. This Order may not be cited as a precedent in
future."
Mr. Acharya submits, respondents, if they accept this grant of relaxation of the upper age limit as
made by State, it must be on acceptance of the legal position that State cannot be compelled by
issuance of mandamus.
20. On query from Court, respondents, through their learned advocates, accept the benevolent
measure of being given three years upper age relaxation in respect of categories of candidates, who
appeared in the written examination pursuant to advertisement dated 22nd September, 2024. We
have ascertained that respondents in the appeals concede their grounds of opposition to impugned
order being interfered with in appeal, by accepting the upper age relaxation granted by State, just
now intimated to Court.
21. Impugned judgment is, therefore, set aside. The appeals are accordingly disposed of.
