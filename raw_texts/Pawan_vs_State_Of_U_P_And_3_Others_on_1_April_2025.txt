Pawan vs State Of U.P. And 3 Others on 1 April, 2025
5. Learned counsel for the applicant has argued that the applicant is absolutely innocent and has
been falsely implicated in the present case. The FIR is delayed by about 02 months and 22 days and
there is no explanation of the said delay caused. The victim is a consenting party as is but evident
from the fact that she has married the applicant and has expressed her willingness to spend her life
with him. The victim is major aged about 18 years.
6. Several other submissions have been made on behalf of the applicant to demonstrate the falsity of
the allegations made against him. The circumstances which, as per counsel, led to the false
implication of the applicant have also been touched upon at length. There is no criminal antecedent
of the applicant. The applicant is languishing in jail since 12.1.2025 and he is ready to cooperate
with trial. In case, the applicant is released on bail, he will not misuse the liberty of bail.
7. Per contra, learned State Law Officer has vehemently opposed the bail application.
8. In light of the judgement of the Supreme Court passed in Niranjan Singh and another vs
Prabhakar Rajaram Kharote and others AIR 1980 SC 785, this Court has avoided detailed
examination of the evidence and elaborate documentation of the merits of the case as no party
should have the impression that his case has been prejudiced. A prima facie satisfaction of case is
needed but it is not the same as an exhaustive exploration of the merits in the order itself.
9. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, submissions made by learned counsel for the
parties, the evidence on record, and taking into consideration the settled law of the Supreme Court
passed in Satender Kumar Antil vs. Central Bureau of Investigation and Ors., 2022 INSC 690 and
Manish Sisodia vs. Directorate of Enforcement, 2024 INSC 595 and without expressing any opinion
on the merits of the case, the Court is of the view that the applicant has made out a case for bail. The
bail application is allowed.
10. Let the applicant- Pawan, who is involved in aforementioned case crime be released on bail on
his furnishing a personal bond and two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the
court concerned subject to following conditions. Further, before issuing the release order, the
sureties be verified.
(i) The applicant shall not tamper with evidence.
(ii) The applicant shall remain present, in person, before the Trial Court on dates
fixed for (1) opening of the case, (2) framing of charge and (3) recording of statement
under Section 313 Cr.P.C./351 B.N.S.S. If in the opinion of the Trial Court absence of
the applicant is deliberate or without sufficient cause, then it shall be open for the
Trial Court to treat such default as abuse of liberty of bail and proceed against him in
accordance with law.
11. In case of breach of any of the above conditions, it shall be a ground for cancellation of bail.

12. It is made clear that observations made in granting bail to the applicant shall not in any way
affect the learned trial Judge in forming his independent opinion based on the testimony of the
witnesses.
