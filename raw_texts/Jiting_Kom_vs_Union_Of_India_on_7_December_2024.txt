B E F OR E HON'BLE MRS. JUSTICE GOLMEI GAIPHULSHILLU 07.12.2024 Heard Mr. M.
Ibotombi Singh, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner and Mr. W. Darakishwor, learned Sr.
PCCG appearing for the respondent.
The present application has been filed by the petitioner u/s 439 of Cr.P.C read with section 37 of the
ND&PS Act for releasing the accused/petitioner on bail with the following prayer;
"15. In the premises aforementioned, it is most respectfully prayed that your
Lordship be pleased to:
enlarge the accused on bail in connection with the case NCB Crime No.
05/04/NCB/IMP/WY/CL/2020 dated 07.12.2020 U/S. 22(C), 23, 25 & 29 of NDPS
Act, 1985 (as amended) in S.T. No 14 of 2021 to breathe the fresh air of justice freely
and also for the ends of justice.
And the petitioner, as in duty bound, shall ever remain pray."
The petition has been filed on the following grounds;
(i) The accused is quite innocent; he had never committed any offence which may compel to the
Respondent for prima facie offence under section ND&PS Act;
(ii) The accused was falsely implicated in the complaint of the respondent due to lack of
communication of language problem;
(iii) The petitioner should be given fundamental right to his life and liberty to avail the legal remedy
as available in the law and the same should not be curtailed for any unreasonable reason

whatsoever;
(iv) The accused is being confined in Prison from 7-12-2020 without any progress of the trial, under
the circumstances, where the period of incarceration awaiting adjudication of guilt become unduly
long, the right to life and the protection of fair and reasonable procedure, envisaged by Article 21,
are jeopardized;
(v) By any standard, it is very unlikely that the trial would be concluded in a reasonable period and
that further incarceration of the accused, in the face of extremely unlikely situation of the trial being
completed in near future, would be in negation of the protection of life and personal liberty under
Article 21;
(vi) The denial of bail, in such circumstances would render the procedure not only unreasonable but
unconscionable as well. The trial is not concluded expeditiously, the procedure which deprives the
personal liberty for an inordinate period is then put to the test of fairness and reasonableness,
envisaged by Article 21 of the Constitution.
(vii) The petitioner undertakes to obey all the conditions and to obey any other conditions if
imposed by the Hon'ble Court. Brief fact of the case is that the accused/petitioner was arrested by a
team of NCB on 07.12.2020 from Moreh, Chandel District along with 5 other persons in C/W NCB
Crime No. 05/04/NCB/IMP/ WY/CL/2020 dated 07.12.2020 U/S. 22(C), 23, 25 & 29 of NDPS Act,
1985 (as amended) and seized the following articles in presence of the witnesses under Mahazar;
(i) 78.1 Kgs of Methamphetamine
(ii) 7.97 Kgs of Methamphetamine powder
(iii) 29.5 Ice Crystal

(v) 10.3 Kgs of White Powder of Methaphetamine
(vi) 28,500 of Tramadol Capsule
(vii) 13500 Pregbalin Capsule and
(viii) 140500 of Bus Pirone Hydrocloride Tablet
Learned counsel for the accused/petitioner submits that the accused/petitioner is being confined in
judicial custody since 07.12.2020 without any progress of the trial.
Mr. W. Darakishwor, learned Sr. PCCG submits that out of the cited 8 witnesses in the Charge sheet
only 3 witnesses are remained to be examined. He further relied upon the following Judgment;

Jiting Kom vs Union Of India on 7 December, 2024
(i) Hon'ble Supreme Judgment - Criminal Appeal Nos. 1001- 1002 of 2022 [Narcotics Control
Bureau Vs Mohit Aggarwal]
(ii) (2013) 3 Supreme Court Cases 63 [State of Assam vs Ripa Sarma]
(iii) Delhi High Court Judgment - Bail Application No. 1939 of 2021 [Asante Pinket Owusu Vs NCB]
The accused/petitioner was arrested on 07.12.2020 and are remained in Jail till date, it is almost 4
years and Sections alleged against the present accused/petitioner by the I.O of the case in the FIR

convicted under this sections, are maximum of 20 years and minimum of 10 years. The present
accused/petitioner is in the custody for almost 4 years and not yet completed 5 years of the
minimum punishment.
After hearing both the learned counsel appearing for the parties and after perusal of the application
with the ground and counter affidavit of the respondent, this Court is of the view that the allegation
made against the present accused/petitioner are of very serious in nature and on top of that as per
the submission made by the learned counsel appearing for the respondent as well as step taken by
the respondent investigating authority, the investigating authorities have done their job very well as
per the provision of law in the present case.
Learned counsel for the petitioner relied upon the Hon'ble Supreme Court Judgment in "Criminal
Appeal No. 2790 of 2024". But, reliance's made by the learned counsel for the petitioner is not
applicable in the present case.
Considering the seriousness of the allegations made against the accused/petitioner and the quantum
of seized articles are huge numbers. And considering the facts that the investigating authority has
done their job very well and as per the submission made by the learned counsel for the respondent
that the examination of the PWs is going to be completed only 3 witnesses are to be examined.
Under the facts and circumstances, the present bail application is rejected.
