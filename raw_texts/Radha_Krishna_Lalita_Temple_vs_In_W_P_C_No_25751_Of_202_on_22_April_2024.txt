MR. JUSTICE D.DASH
MR. JUSTICE G. SATAPATHY
Date of Judgment: 22.04.2024
Dash,J. One Reetanjali Sahu, as the original Petitioner, had filed this writ petition as at (A) invoking
the jurisdiction of this Court under Articles 226 & 227 of the Constitution of India with a prayer to
quash the order dated 01.03.2019 passed by the Government in the Department of Law in Appeal
No.2 of 2019 in exercise of the power under sub-section 4 of section 19 of the Odisha Hindu
Religious Endowments Act, 1951 (hereinafter, referred to as O.H.R.E. Act) and direct the learned
Additional Assistant Commissioner of Endowments, Berhampur (Opposite Party No.5) to hold fresh
auction of the immovable properties in question belonging to the Hindu Religious Institution, i.e.,
Radhakrishna Lalita Temple at Hinjili in the District of Ganjam (Odisha) following the modality as
had been directed by the Commissioner of Endowments, Odisha (Opposite Party No.3) in his order
dated 11.12.2018 passed in Original Application No.08 of 2004.
2. Said Petitioner Ritanjali Sahu had raised the following grievances for redressal:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131166151/ 2
Radha Krishna Lalita Temple vs In W.P.(C) No.25751 Of 202 on 22 April, 2024
i) that the Appellate Authority by the impugned order without any reason has illegally
reduced the upset price determined by the learned Commissioner of Endowments;
ii) that after that order of the Appellate Authority, the Interim Trustee, having not at
all followed the procedures prescribed in law and the order of the learned
Commissioner to that effect, which was not varied or set aside in Appeal and rather
flouting all those in collusion Opposite Party No.8 (auction purchaser) has gone
ahead in auctioning the immovable property of the Religious Institution giving the
same as a show in pen and paper and not as reality."
3. At this stage, it be stated that this Court, by order dated 08.10.2020, had disposed of the writ
petition as at (A) by passing the following order "In view of the above, since on the face of the order,
it is apparent that the order under Annexure-1 is neither fair nor in the interest of the deity or
beneficial to the institution and a nullity in the eye of law being not a reasoned/speaking one, this
Court is inclined to quash the same. Accordingly, the order passed by opposite party no.1 dated
01.03.2019 under Annexure-1 is quashed. This Court restores the order passed by the learned
Commissioner of Endowments dated 11.12.2018 in O.A. No.08 of 2004 and directs the opposite
parties to proceed with the auction as per the procedure and upset price fixed by the learned
Commissioner of Endowments and complete the entire exercise within a period of two months from
today. Since this Court has quashed the order passed by the opposite party no.1 dated 01.03.2019
under Annexure-1, the process of auction started, if any, pursuant to such order under Annexure-1 is
also quashed. Opposite party no.5 is directed to take fresh step as directed by the learned
Commissioner of Endowments in its order dated 11.12.2018 in O.A. No.8 of 2004."
With the aforesaid observation and direction, the writ petition is disposed of. "
Challenging the said order, the Interim Trustee, Nilamadhab Sahoo, representing the
Opposite Party No.7- Radha Krishna Lalita Temple along with the Opposite Party
No.8, who claimed to be the auction purchaser of the land in question, had carried an
Appeal to the Hon'ble Supreme Court.
The Hon'ble Supreme Court allowed the said Appeal and by setting aside the
impugned order passed by this Court on 08.10.2020, restored the original proceeding
before this Court and directed for fresh adjudication after hearing the parties
including the Opposite Party No.8, who had not been given the opportunity of
hearing when the writ petition had been disposed of.
The order of the Hon'ble Supreme Court reads as under:-
"xx xx xx
Xx xx xx
6. We are, therefore, inclined to allow the appeal and set aside the impugned order of
the High Court and to restore the writ proceedings before the High Court for fresh
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131166151/ 3
Radha Krishna Lalita Temple vs In W.P.(C) No.25751 Of 202 on 22 April, 2024
consideration. We do so only on the ground that the second appellant who was an
auction purchaser has not been heard by the High Court. We clarify that we have
expressed no opinion on the respective rights and contentions of the parties which
are kept open to be decided by the High Court.
7. The appeal is accordingly allowed by setting aside the impugned judgment and
order of the High Court dated 8 October 2020. Writ Petition Civil No 25751 of 2020
is restored to the file of the High Court for disposal afresh. All the rights and
contentions are kept open.
8. The applications for intervention, impleadment and transposition are disposed of.
9 Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of.
9. Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of."
4. When the matter stood thus, the Petitioners of the writ Petition as at (B) filed an Intervention
petition in the writ Petition as at (A) and this Court on 11.08.2021 had directed as under:-
"xx xx xx In the interim, it is directed that no sale deed will be executed on behalf of anybody by the
Non-Hereditary Managing Trustee of the Temple, possession over the land in question shall not be
handed over to anybody and nature and character of the land in question shall not be changed till
disposal of the Writ petition." In the meantime, the original Petitioner, namely, Ritanjali Sahu filed
an application seeking permission to withdraw the writ petition. That petition as well as the
intervention petition being heard together, this Court, by order dated 17.10.2023, has permitted the
original writ Petitioner, namely, Ritanjali Sahu, to withdraw from the scenario of the proceeding and
allowed the intervention of the present Petitioners for being transposed in place of the original writ
Petitioner, Ritanjali Sahu.
5. Facts necessary for the purpose are stated as follows: -
Radha Krishna Lalita Temple at Hinjili, a Hindu Religious Institution through one
person, namely, Mohan Sahu, who asserted himself as the fit person of the Religious
Institution filed an application under section 19 of the OHRE Act seeking permission
from the learned Commissioner of Endowment, Odisha for sale of the land
measuring in total Ac7.871 decimal (Seven Acres and Eight Hundred and Seventy
One decimals) under different plots appertaining to khata no.978 in Mouza Hinjili
belonging to the Institution.
Although, said application had been filed by the Religious Institution through one
Mohan Sahu claiming himself as the fit person, it was, however, not stated as to what
was his status vis-Ã -vis the Religious Institution.
It was simply stated as under: -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131166151/ 4
Radha Krishna Lalita Temple vs In W.P.(C) No.25751 Of 202 on 22 April, 2024
"That the applicant is the fit person of the above-named temple."
The ground for seeking permission for sale of land was the difficulty in managing the Temple with
limited income that was being earned. Surprisingly, in that petition said Mohan Sahu as the fit
person had even gone to propose the price to be fixed for sale of the immovable property of the
Religious Institution. The petition when was lying as it is, on 15.01.2014, one Nilamadhab Sahu
came up with an application through his lawyer for being substituted therein stating that he being
appointed as Interim Managing Trustee on 31.05.2010 be substituted in place of the erstwhile
Petitioner, namely, Mr. Mohan Sahu, who claiming to be the fit person, had filed the application on
behalf of the Religious Institution seeking permission to sell the above land owned and possessed by
the Religious Institution and asserted that he would then onwards pursue the said application on
behalf of the Religious Institution.
By order dated 16.11.2015, that substitution was allowed and that Interim Managing Trustee
namely, Nilamadhaba Sahoo thus prosecuted the application seeking the permission for sale of the
immovable property of Hindu Religious Institution. The learned Commissioner of Endowment by
his order dated 11.12.2018 granted the permission for sale of the land in question with the condition
that the land would be put to public auction keeping the upset price at Rs.70,00,000/- per Acre and
fixed the modalities/procedures to be followed while holding the said auction as also laying the plan
for investment of the sale price which would be so received keeping in view the interest of the
Institution and for its benefit.
6. That order of the learned Commissioner was challenged by carrying an appeal under section 19
(4) of the OHRE Act by none other than the Religious Institution represented by its Interim
Managing Trustee, namely, Nilamadhab Sahu. The challenge in that Appeal was, however, confined
only to the fixation of the upset price for auction sale of the land. The Appeal came to be heard by
the Hon'ble Minister of Law, Odisha and stood disposed of on 01.03.2019, which is the subject
matter in the writ petition originally filed by Ritanjali Sahu asserting herself as an intending
purchaser of the said property directed to be put to auction sale pursuant to the order raising the
ground that the auction of the immovable property had been conducted in gross violation and
flouting the procedures prescribed under the Rules and orders.
7. The Appellate Authority, in seisin of the Appeal went through the Benchmark Valuation Report
relating to different plots of land as had been submitted by the Sub-Registrar, Hinjli as being called
for by order dated 23.02.2019. The report was post disposal of the original application by the
learned Commissioner of Endowment on 11.12.2018. The said report had been called for during
pendency of the Appeal. Then on going through that report as it reveals from the order, the Bench
mark Valuation of each plot of the land as reported were quoted and the following short order has
been passed:-
"xx xx xx xx After hearing the appellant and the respondent present and the representative on behalf
of the respondent no.1 and the Asst. Law Officer on behalf of the Commissioner of Endowments and
perusal of the copy of the order dated 11.12.2018 passed by the Commissioner of Endowments along
with the case record, the institution is not getting any income from those lands. The said proceeds

fetch more income to the institution. If it will be deposited in any Nationalized bank in a long term
fixed deposit scheme. It appears that there is legal necessity to sale the case land which will be
beneficial to the deity and it appears to me that the price fixed by the learned Endowment
Commissioner is very high about the Bench Mark Valuation. In the fitness of the things and to arrive
at a reasonable price, the price is fixed enhancing 10% over the Bench Mark Valuation."
8. The above order passed in the Appeal is under the challenge in this writ petition.
It be stated at this stage, that in the meantime Radha Krishna Lalita Temple represented by its
Non-Hereditary Trust Board (NHTB) as formed under the orders of the learned Commissioner of
Endowment under section 27 of the OHRE Act filed W.P.(C) No.17479 of 2021 as at (B) with the
prayers to quash the order dated 11.12.2018 passed by the learned Commissioner of Endowment in
O.A No.8 of 2004 as well as the order passed by the Appellate Authority in Appeal No.2 of 2019 and
all subsequent actions and proceedings which have taken place pursuant to those orders. Said writ
petition had been heard with the writ petition as at (A) filed earlier, for their disposal together by
this common judgment.
9. We have heard Dr. K. N. Tripathy, learned Counsel for the present Petitioners in both the writ
petitions. We have also heard Mr. S. N. Das, learned Additional Standing Counsel representing the
State, Ms. P. Naidu, learned Counsel for the Commissioner of Endowment, Mr. S. K. Choudhury,
learned Counsel for the then Interim Trustee, namely, Nilamadhab Sahu who prosecuted the
application under section 19 of the OHRE Act and had carried the Appeal under section 19(4) of the
Act representing the Religious Institution and is no more in the Non- Hereditary Trust Board of the
Religious Institution. We have also heard Mr. T. K. Mishra, learned Counsel for the Opposite Party
No.8, who is the auction purchaser in the auction said to have been held on 18.03.2020 and so far
standing as the beneficiary in the entire process and claims to have derived the right, title, interest
and possession over the property of the Religious Institution by virtue of the sale deed executed and
registered on 03.09.2020 for a consideration of Rs.1,40,00,000/- (Rupees One Crore Forty Lakhs)
paid by him under Fixed Deposit made in the name of the Religious Institution on 05.06.2020 in
HDFC Bank.
We have carefully gone through the averments taken in the writ petition, counter affidavits and
additional affidavits filed by the parties as well as all the documents annexed thereto which would be
referred to as and when so required in course of our discussion to follow.
10. An application under section 19 of the OHRE Act was filed before the learned Commissioner
Endowment on 20.01.2004. The Religious Institution at that time was represented by Mohan
Sahoo, who had asserted himself as the fit person. Said application when was lying like that after
about a decade, one Nilamadhab Sahu on 15.01.2014 stating to have been appointed as Interim
Trustee of the Religious Institution, on 31.05.2010 filed an application for his substitution in place
of Mohan Sahoo, the person who as the fit person had filed the Original Application under
section-19 of the OHRE Act. Said application finally came to be disposed of on 11.12.2018 after lapse
of around 4 years.

Radha Krishna Lalita Temple vs In W.P.(C) No.25751 Of 202 on 22 April, 2024
When said Nilamadhab Sahu, by filing the substitution petition, wanted to pursue the Original
Application filed about a decade back, he, in his application or while amending the application later
provided no such reason/justification as to if the sale of that large patch of land was then also
necessary and beneficial to the Religious Institution indicating the financial condition of the
Institution as regards its income and spending. Be that as it may, the learned Commissioner of
Endowments, while according permission for sale of the land involving acreage of Ac. 7.871 decimal
(Seven Acres and Eight Hundred Seventy One decimals), as ordained under the provision contained
in section 19 of the Act fixed the upset price for the auction sale to be held for said land at Rs.70 lakh
per Acre, which was found to be the minimum adequate market price of the land in that locality. It
was also put as a condition that 30 days before the auction, there shall be advertisement by beat of
drums in the locality as well as by publication in any Odia Daily Newspaper like "Dharitri", "Samaj",
"Sambad", "Samay" or English Daily like "The Times of India" having wide circulation in the
locality. Further order in the interest and benefit of the deity was passed indicating as to how the
fetched sale consideration would be invested. More importantly, it was put as a condition that the
sale be effected within 6 (six) months after the expiry of the period of Appeal or Revision and if no
Appeal or Revision is preferred in the meanwhile and in case of Appeal or Revision as per the orders
of the Appellate/Revisional Authority following the provisions contained in Section 19 (C) (1) of the
OHRE Act that it shall be first offered to the State Government for purchase of the said land for
public purpose which shall not be at the price less than the amount fixed as the adequate
consideration of the land in question, meaning thereby the upset price so fixed.
That Interim Managing Trustee, namely, Nilamdhaba Sahoo on behalf of the Religious Institution
then feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied by that order of the learned Commissioner whereby the
permission for sale of that entire patch of land of Ac.7.871 (Seven Acre Eight Hundred Seveny One
decimals) was allowed, carried an Appeal under section 19(4) of the Act to the Government in the
Department of Law, which came to be heard and disposed of by the Hon'ble Minister of Law. He
filed the Appeal only challenged/questioning the upset price as had been fixed by the learned
Commissioner, Endowments for the auction sale of the property of the Religious Institution as to
have been fixed on a higher side but not challenging any other condition/s.
It has to be borne in mind that by that time, the property was not even put to auction showing any
such result that for such fixation of the up-set price by the learned Commissioner, there being no
participation, the very purpose and objective behind the permission for sale of the land of the
Religious Institution stood frustrated. The Appellate Authority calling for the Benchmark Valuation
and Market Valuation report (as noted) from the concerned Sub-Registrar sat over to observe that it
appeared from the Bench Mark Valuation report that the upset price fixed by the learned
Endowment Commissioner was too high. So, the Appellate Authority fixed the upset price for the
auction of the land giving enhancement of 10% (ten percent) over the Benchmark Valuation shown
by the Sub-Registrar in holding that the same would be reasonable and accordingly, directed that
the auction of the land with that upset price be held.
11. The upset price for sale of the land in public auction which had been set forth by the learned
Endowment Commissioner was Rs.70 lakh per acre for auction sale of Ac.7.871 (Seven Acres and
Eight Hundred Seven One decimals) thus was redetermined by the Appellate Authority in Appeal.

12. 716 Rs.3,75,000/- Rs.70,00,000/- Rs.4,12,500/-
12. From the above, it thus appears that when the learned Commissioner of Endowment had found
out the Adequate Price for the land in question at Rs.70,00,000/- per Acre as he was under the
obligation to do so as provided under section 19 of the OHRE Act; in an Appeal, the Appellate
Authority has held the Adequate Price of different plots of land differently and thereby there has
been reduction in the adequate price for the land, which can be seen from the following table:-

under Plot No.3433, the upset price fixed by the Appellate Authority in Appeal came
to be Rs.81,67,500/-
as against the upset price fixed by the learned Commissioner at Rs.70,00,000/-. For this lone plot of
land, as per order of the Appellate Authority, there has been enhancement of Rs.11,67,500.00
(Rupees Eleven Lakhs Sixty Seven Thousand Five Hundred).
Thus, for all the land covered under 12 plots, when the learned Commissioner had fixed the total
upset price at Rs.5,50,97,000/- (Rupees Five Crores Fifty Lakhs Ninety Seven Thousand), the same
has been fixed at Rs.1,25,03,411/- (Rupees One Crore Twenty Five Lakhs Three Thousand Four
Hundred Eleven). In this way, the Hon'ble Minister, in the Appeal, has reduced the upset price for
all those lands covered under 12 plots for their sale by Rs.4,25,93,589/- (Rupees Four Crores
Twenty Five Lakhs Ninety Three Thousand Five Hundred Eighty Nine).
13. Under the Scheme of the OHRE Act, as provided under section 4 of the section therein, the State
Government, by notification, appoints a person professing the Hindu religion who is a member of
Odisha Superior Judicial Service to be the Commissioner of Endowments with the caveat that he
would cease to hold the office as such when he ceases to profess that religion. The powers and duties
of the Commissioner has been provided in Chapter-II of the said Act under section 7 of the Act,
which reads as under:-
7. Powers and Duties of Commissioner: -
(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the general superintendence of all religious
institutions and endowments shall vest in the Commissioner.;
(2) The Commissioner may do all things which are reasonable and necessary to
ensure that the religious institutions and endowments are properly administered and
that their income is duly appropriated for the purposes which they were founded or
exist.
Explanation: - The Commissioner shall have power to pass such interim orders as he deems
necessary for the proper maintenance of a religious institution, or the proper administration of a
religious endowment including the power to pass such orders if and when necessary for the proper
management of any institution when a dispute concerning the same is pending in a Court.

Radha Krishna Lalita Temple vs In W.P.(C) No.25751 Of 202 on 22 April, 2024
The above provision makes it clear that the learned Commissioner has the general superintendence
over all the Hindu Religious Institutions and Endowments which vest in him and he may do all
things which are reasonable and necessary to ensure that the Religious Institutions and
Endowments are properly administered and their income is duly appropriated for the purpose for
which they were founded and exist.
A bare reading of the above provision would show that when the Religious Institutions and
Endowments are managed by the Officials in the field, the learned Commissioner has the power of
general superintendence over them and for proper administration, providing income and utilization
and the Commissioner may do all such things which are reasonable.
14. The OHRE Act in section 19 creates a bar for transfer by exchange, sale or mortgage and lease for
a period exceeding five years of any immovable property belonging to, or given or endowed for the
purpose of, any Hindu Religious Institution without the sanction of the learned Commissioner. The
learned Commissioner while deciding the matter of sanction as per the provision is under the legal
obligation to look into the necessity for such transfer and find that the same if is beneficial to the
Religious Institution. Any transfer without the sanction as per the said section is not valid and
operative.
15. At this stage, it would be apt and proper to give a careful reading to the said provision of section
19 of the O.H.R.E. Act, which runs as under:-
"19. Alienation of immovable trust Property :-
(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force no
transfer by exchange, sale or mortgage and no lease for a term exceeding five years of
any immovable property belonging to, or given or endowed for the purpose of, any
religious institution, shall be made unless it is sanctioned by the Commissioner as
being necessary for beneficial to the institution and no such transfer shall be valid or
operative unless it is so sanctioned.
Explanation: - A lease for a term not exceeding five years but with a condition of renewal permitting
continuance of the lease beyond five years shall, for the purpose of this Sub-Section, be deemed to
be a lease for a term exceeding five years.

the lessor, failing which, the Commissioner may take action in accordance with the provision of

Radha Krishna Lalita Temple vs In W.P.(C) No.25751 Of 202 on 22 April, 2024
Provided that all structures, permanent or temporary, if any, constructed plants and
machineries and other things installed and kept on the leasehold land, which is a
subject- matter of a lease executed after commencement of the Odisha Hindu
Religious Endowments (Amendment) Act 22 of 1989 by the lessee, his Servants or
agents, shall become the property of the religious institution unless removed from the
land within such period, as may be prescribed, after expiry of the term of lease, in
respect of which the Commissioner shall take action under the provision of Section
68.
(1-c) Notwithstanding anything contained in the proviso to Sub-Section (1-b), no
property belonging to a person other than the lessee shall be subjected to confiscation
under the said proviso, unless such person fails to remove his property within a
period of thirty days from the date of publication of a notice which shall be issued by
the Trustee within such period as may be prescribed after the expiry of the term of
lease:
Provided that any person whose property is affected under Sub-Section (1-c), may file

subject to the decision of the Civil Court, be final.
(2) In according such sanction, the Commissioner may declare it to be subject to such

commencement of the said Act whichever period of expires earlier.
(5) In any case where appeal has not been made to the State Government it appears
to the State Government that the alienation is not necessary or beneficial to the

communicated to them under Sub-Section (3) or the date of the publication of the
order, whichever date is later, call for the record of the case from the Commissioner
and after giving an opportunity of hearing to the parties concerned, revise the order
of the Commissioner:
Provided that in any case where the transfer has not been effected in pursuance of the
order of the Commissioner under sub-Section (1), the State Government may exercise

(6) The State Government may, by order, stay execution of the deed of transfer in
respect of the immovable property which form the subject-matter of an appeal or
revision till the disposal of the appeal, or as the case may be, the revision.
(7) The order of the Commissioner made under this Section shall, subject to orders, if
any, passed in an appeal or revision, be final."
16. As provided in sub-section 2 of section 19 of the O.H.R.E. Act, the learned Commissioner while
according such sanction is empowered to put any such conditions and give any directions as he may
deem necessary regarding utilization of the amount raised by the transactions, the investment
thereof and in case of mortgage even regarding discharge of the same within a reasonable period.
The learned Commissioner, being placed in the position as the super guardian, has to look into
everything in these regards through the prism of the best interest of the Religious Institution for its
optimum benefit and for that end being the paramount consideration since the Religious Institution
is a perpetual minor in the eye of law. The above exercise, as mandated under law, has to be done by
the learned Commissioner only after he takes a decision that there exists the necessity for transfer
the immovable property of the Religious Institution and that is also needed for the benefit and to
serve the best interest of the Religious Institution. As the action of the guardian in respect of the
minor's person and property must satisfy the paramount test and consideration as to the welfare
and benefit of the minor, the same is the case in respect of Religious Institution. By the above
provision, the legislative intends that the learned Commissioner should do all the needful in that
regard.
17. In the given case, the learned Commissioner has granted the sanction for sale of the immovable
property of the Religious Institution by its judgment dated 11.02.2018 basing upon an application
made in the year 2004 that is after about 14 years. Important to note the fact here is that the person
claiming as fit person, who on behalf of Religious Institution had originally filed the application
being no more there to pursue the same, the subsequent Interim Managing Trustee came to pursue
the said application in the year 2015, which is after 11 years of filing of the original application,
which came to be decided after lapse of 14 years.
Be that as it may, the learned Commissioner in its order has arrived at a conclusion that the sale of
the lands in question is essential and would be beneficial to the said Religious Institution. Having
held so, he has fixed the condition that the land in question shall be sold by way of public auction
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131166151/ 12
Radha Krishna Lalita Temple vs In W.P.(C) No.25751 Of 202 on 22 April, 2024
and in the manner as directed. The learned Commissioner, being ordained under law, in the best
interest and for the benefit of the Religious Institution in order to see that when the Religious
Institution would be loosing the land once for all, it must get the optimum consideration, fixed the
upset price for the said auction to be held for the sale of the land at Rs.70,00,000/- per Acre.
18. At the risk of repetition, we find it very interesting and at the same time shocking to put that
before the auction of the immovable property of the Religious Institution was held with the upset
price as fixed by the learned Commissioner that Interim Managing Trustee, Nilamadhab Sahoo,
representing the Religious Institution filed an Appeal under sub-section-4 of section-19 of the Act
raising the objection in only opposing the fixation of the upset price of the land by the learned
Commissioner and questioning that upset price to be excessively high in further praying that the
upset price of all the plots except the one that is plot no.3433 be reduced/lowered down. It is not
understood and rather highly baffling and disturbing to note that when his move as to sale of the
immovable property has been accepted by grant of permission/sanction and the direction of the
learned Commissioner has not at all been carried into action by even putting once to test, how there
had arisen any reason or justification for the Interim Managing Trustee behind the move in Appeal
seeking reduction of the upset price fixed by the learned Commissioner as the minimum adequate
price/consideration for sale of the land of the immovable property of the Religious Institution. The
Interim Managing Trustee is under legal obligation to do any/all such acts in relation to the
Religious Institution, keeping the best interest of the Institution in mind and for its welfare and
benefit. We fail to follow for a moment that this move of filing the Appeal by Interim Managing
Trustee (O.P. No.7) how was in the interest of the Religious Institution and its welfare at that point
of time when the fact remains that more the price is fetched by sale, the more it is beneficial to the
Religious Institution in serving its better interest. Had it been said to be low, to move that it be
enhanced would have been for the interest and benefit of the Religious Institution standing to
reason which here is juxtaposition. The Interim Managing Trustee questioned the upset price where
he had no concern at all and when the fixation of the upset price on a lower side as prayed for by
him, would be highly detriment and against the interest of the Religious Institution. This very move
by the Interim Managing Trustee of the Religious Institution makes it clear as to how he was keen to
safeguard the Religious Institution in acting in that manner, which exposes that he acted adverse to
that interest of the Religious Institution. Had there been the auction once and that if would have
failed due to non-participation, automatically the matter being so reported to the learned
Commissioner, he would have been legally obliged to take the call and revisit the matter in order to
see that the immovable property of the Religious Institution required to be sold for the benefit and
in the interest of the Religious Institution finally materialises and that the condition/direction as
regards upset price does not stand as the impediment on the way of implementation of the order of
sale and accordingly needs modification as deemed just and proper at that time point of time taking
into consideration the surrounding circumstances then prevailing.
Furthermore, even though we say that the Interim Managing Trustee had then no say over the
matter of fixation of the upset price for the auction sale of the immovable property of the Religious
Institution, still that Interim Managing Trustee has nowhere indicated as to what should be the
adequate market price so that the same be fixed as the upset price for the auction and more
importantly, why he seeks for reduction.

Radha Krishna Lalita Temple vs In W.P.(C) No.25751 Of 202 on 22 April, 2024
19. The order of the learned Commissioner Endowments passed in O.A. No.08 of 2004 on
11.12.2018, being received in the Department of Law, Government of Odisha, as required under the
provisions of the Act and Rules, Memorandum of Appeal was presented by Nilamadhaba Sahu, the
said Interim Managing Trustee and came to be received.
The file, being placed before the Appellate Authority on 03.02.2019, he posted the Appeal to
08.02.2019 at 12.00 hours for hearing. Although the file for hearing was submitted before the
Appellate Authority on 07.02.2019 and it was so received in his office, no such order, however, was
passed on 08.02.2019. The Appellate Authority, then suddenly on 16.02.2019 ordered that the
Bench Mark Valuation and the Market Valuation of the concerned land be obtained from the
Sub-Registrar, Hinjili, Ganjam within a week and the Appeal be put up for hearing. Then also no
particular date was fixed. The Sub-Registrar, furnished the Bench Mark Valuation of the land and
simultaneously intimated that no such transaction relating to the land in the nearby locality, having
been made in his office, the Market Valuation of the land could not be ascertained at his end for
being so reported as desired. The report was seen by the Appellate Authority on 08.03.2019, when
the file had been submitted before him upon receipt of the said report of the Sub- Registrar on
28.02.2019 and received in his office on 01.03.2019. When the matter stood thus, on 13.03.2019, the
Section Officer of the Department of Law received the copy of the order dated 01.03.2019 passed by
the Appellate Authority in Appeal Case No.2 of 2019 and then communicated the same to the
learned Commissioner of Endowment and returned the LCR. When the file reveals that Appellate
Authority went through the report on 08.03.2019, it is curious enough to note that the final order in
the Appeal had by then already been passed on 01.03.2019. The final order appears to have been
made ready on the next day of receipt of the file with the said report without perusing the report
although so noted in the final order to have been gone through. The file does not reveal that the
Appeal at any point of time was heard and the Opposite Party No.7 (Appellant therein) had
advanced his submission for reduction of upset price. The date, i.e., 08.02.2019, being fixed as the
date of hearing, the entire file does not show as to if at all thereafter the Appeal has been heard. It is
also interesting to note that when on receipt of the order of the learned Commissioner Endowments,
the file was moved no such order has been passed in declining to initiate any suo motu Revision,
which is mandated in law but then the Appeal filed by the Interim Managing Trustee only
continued. When the Appellant of that Appeal, i.e., the present Opposite Party No.7 had not argued
in the Appeal, how was it then kept alive for the Appellate Authority to pass an order on merit
accepting the whole prayer in the Appeal by reducing the upset price. Viewing all these, it appears as
if the Hon'ble Minister, suo motu reduced the upset price, which was not all within his competence
and power as per law.
20. At this juncture, it is not understood that when the Appellate Authority after having disposed of
the Appeal became functus officio, upon receipt of application dated 23.12.2019 from Iswar Das and
others and letter dated 10.01.2020 from the Additional District Magistrate has passed specific order
that when the period prescribed under sub-section 2 of section 19(C) of the O.H.R.E. Act has expired
and no further extension has been made, "No Objection Certificate" (NOC) be issued to the
concerned Sub-Registrar as well as the Trustee be intimated about it under intimation to the
Collector. Such a direction was given on 06.02.2020, after lapse of about a year after disposal of the
Appeal and that was when the Additional District Magistrate has expressed his concern as under:-

Radha Krishna Lalita Temple vs In W.P.(C) No.25751 Of 202 on 22 April, 2024
"Further, I am to say that though from time to time this office is getting instruction to
dispose of the cases, but due to certain shortcoming observed in the cases, this office
could not dispose it of in time. Hence, you are requested to give necessary
instruction/clarifications deity property-wise transmitted to Government vide above
letters for taking necessary action at this end. However, in the meanwhile this office
has processed the deity land of different religious institutions like (1) Radhakrishna
Lalita Bije at Hinjili, (2) Sri Radha Mohan Mohaprabhu and Radha Damodar
Mahaprabhu Bije at Radha Mohan Matha, Nuasahi, Digapahandi, (3) Sri Raghunath
Mahaprabhu Bije at Nimakhandi and (4) Sri Jatadhareswar Swamy Bije at Khaspa
street, Old Berhampur which will be hoisted in public domain for necessary
information of all possible Government Department for processing the cases to give
"No Objection Certificate" or willingness certificate for use of the deity property for
public use.
Xx xx xx xx"
Although Iswar Das and others claiming to be the Heriditary Trustee and the
Managing Heriditary Trustee of some other Religious Institutions, in that
application, had requested the Secretary, Department of Law to issue appropriate
instruction/direction to the Sub-Registrar, Berhampur for registration of the land in
question as the period of offer letter has crossed the stipulated time since long, it is
not understood as to how these applications were at all entertained by the Appellate
Authority when said applicants had no concern at all in the matter. The Appeal file
contains the photocopy of the said application. There is absolutely no noting in the
file regarding these applications and the file contains the photocopy of one
note-sheet, which is said to be an extract taken from another file opened in the year
2018.
Furthermore, when the Appellate Authority, as per his order, had not received the
report relating to the Market Value of the land from the Sub-Registrar and that report
was only on the Bench Mark Valuation, nothing has been stated about the Market
Valuation of the land and the Appellate Authority appears to have taken the approved
Bench Mark Valuation to be the market value of the land so as to say what would be
the adequate price, which is absolutely incorrect and fundamentally wrong; both
being conceptually and contextually different.
21. The relevant provisions are contained in section-47-A of the Indian Stamp
(Odisha Amendment) Act, 2008 read with the corresponding rules in the Odisha
Stamp Rules, 1952 under Chapter-VI would throw the light on the matter. The
Sub-section-
(1) Section 47-A of the Indian Stamp Act (Odisha Amendment) provides as to how
instruments under-valued to be dealt with. It says that where the Registering Officer
under the Registration Act, 1908, while registering any instrument of conveyance ,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131166151/ 15
Radha Krishna Lalita Temple vs In W.P.(C) No.25751 Of 202 on 22 April, 2024
exchange, gift, partition or settlement has reasons to believe that the market value of
the property which is the subject matter of the instrument has not been rightly set
forth in the instrument or is less than the minimum value determined in accordance
with the rules made under the Act, he shall, before registering such instrument, refer
the matter to the Collector, with an intimation in writing to the person concerned, for
determination of the market value of such property and the proper duty payable
thereon.
Coming to the Odisha Stamp Rules, 1952, we find the market value to have been defined in
Rule-2(f). So, the market value as finds mention in section-47-A of the Act is to be given the
meaning as per the above rule. The market value as defined in the Rule-2(f) of the Odisha Stamp
Rules, 1952 is as under:-
"(i) the value of any property estimated to be the value which in the opinion of the
Collector or the appellate authority, as the case may be, would have fetched or would
fetch, if sold, in the market on the date of execution of the instruments; and
(ii) the value of any property which is the subject matter of conveyance, exchange,
gift, partition or settlement by or on behalf of the Central Government or the State
Government or any authority or body incorporated by or under any law for the time
being in force as shown in the instrument."
Rule-37 of Chapter-VI of Odisha Stamp Rules, 1952 refers to the constitution of the District Level
Valuation Committee and Sub-District (Tahasil Level) Valuation Committee and Rule- 38 provides
the function of the District Level Valuation Committee, when Rule-39 describes the function of the
Sub- District Valuation Committee. In Rule-40, it is stated that market value guidelines prepared
under this Chapter shall be issued as soon as they are prepared and shall thereafter be revised
biennially from the 1st April. It is also provided therein that in case, the Committee fails to revise the
valuation, the Collector as Chairman would enhance the value by ten percent of the value so fixed.
For preparation of the valuation, what have been stated in clause (a) of Rule-39 and the Appendix-II
which provides principle for determination of market value and such other instructions issued by
the Government and Inspector General of Registration (IGR), from time to time shall be taken into
consideration. Under Rule-41-A, the State Government reserves the power to engage reputed
professional agency to examine the procedure for fixation of market value guideline regarding
proper value of the properties in any particular area or areas under such terms and conditions as
considered proper for being taken into account by the Committee for such area/areas.
A conjoint reading of the provisions contained in sub- section 1 of section 47-A of the Stamp (Odisha
Amendment) Act, 2008 and Orissa Stamp Rule made thereunder makes the following things clear:-
"a. the Registering officer before registration of the instrument, has to arrive at a
conclusion that valuation put-forth in the instrument is the proper value of the
property, which is the subject matter of the instrument or in other-words that has not
been undervalued.;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131166151/ 16
Radha Krishna Lalita Temple vs In W.P.(C) No.25751 Of 202 on 22 April, 2024
b. for the purpose of registration, he must have the reasons to believe that the market
value of property, which is the subject matter of the instrument, has been rightly
set-forth in the instrument.; and c. where if not more at least the market value of the
property determined under the said rules made in accordance with the Act has been
set-forth as the market value of said property, which is the subject matter of the
instrument, the Registering Officer would have all the satisfaction that the market
value of the property has been rightly set-forth, then the scope for the Registering
Officer to refer the matter to the Collector for determination of the proper duty
payable thereon would no more be there."
This is because of the reason that the Collector himself is associated in determination of the market
value of the property as provided in the rules. The market value has to be taken to mean so with
reference to the objective set-forth in the Stamp Act in charging stamp duty and the fees for
registration as the consequence. The market value thus determined under the rules is only for the
purpose of acceptance of the document for registration by the Registering Officer by arriving at a
satisfaction that the market value of the property, which is the subject matter of the instrument has
been rightly set-forth in the instrument. The definition of the market value, as given in the rules,
thus is only confined for the purpose as aforesaid and not beyond that to say that the same would be
the market value of the property in question for transfer of the property in open market when the
property is offered in open market for transfer that would depend upon very many factors including
the time when the transfer is being made, the market value meaning the reasonable consideration
thereof can never be equated with the market value determined under the rules as above. That is the
reasons the Sub- Registrar has very rightly stated that as such translations of the land in the locality
has been registered in his office, he was not in a position to report about the market valuation of the
land and he simply supplied the Bench Mark Valuation, i.e., the valuation of land fixed for
satisfaction of the Registering Authority as to market value so as to charge the stamp duty and
consequential collection of the fees for registration.
So, for the purpose of determining the adequate price at which the immovable property belonging to
the Religious Institution for the transfer while according sanction under section 19 of the O.H.R.E.
Act, said market value determined under Rule-2(f) and the other rules made under Chapter-VI of
the Odisha Stamp Rules keeping in view the provisions contained in section 47-A of the Stamp
(Odisha Amendment), 2008 can never so accepted and under no circumstance be held to be the
adequate price. The Appellate Authority, in the present case, while going to pass the order by
substantial reduction of the upset price, has not kept in mind the above fundamental and very
common feature. The determination of the upset price being the adequate price has been done in an
arbitrary manner detriment to the interest and welfare of the Religious Institution and not to benefit
the Religious Institution.
The Appellate Authority has abruptly fixed the upset price by increasing 10% over the said Bench
Mark valuation given by the Sub-Registrar as if offering one peanut more to the Religious
Institution as of charity/grace. For all these aforesaid discussion; we are more than satisfied that the
final order passed in Appeal which has been impugned in this proceeding before us is wholly
unsustainable and should not be allowed to stand and as such liable to be quashed as nonest in the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131166151/ 17
Radha Krishna Lalita Temple vs In W.P.(C) No.25751 Of 202 on 22 April, 2024
eye of law and so also any/all said actions taken/done in pursuance thereof and consequential
thereto must not be allowed to stand. On this ground alone, the order of the Appellate Authority
passed in the Appeals, being impugned in this proceeding before us, is also liable to be set aside.
Thus, it appears that no such effort has been made to ascertain the Market Value of the land in
question to find out the adequate price for its sale for determining the upset price for the land in the
auction sale.
22. Next turning our attention to Sub-section-3 of section 19, we find that it provides that the copy
of the order made by the Commissioner under said section shall be communicated to the State
Government and the Trustee and shall be published in such manner as may be prescribed. The
OHRE Rules 1959 in sub-rule 2 of rule 4 prescribes that the copy of the orders in addition of being
communicated to the State Government, the Trustee or Trustees and to the intended alienees, be
also published by affixation on the notice Board or the front door of the Religious Institution
concerned and in a conspicuous place of the village where the property in question situates. Both
modes have to be complied with and in their absence, the inevitable conclusion would be that there
was no due publication of the order, and that order thus cannot be further carried into action and
even if carried into action, all such actions would be null and void. What we mean here is to say that
the very objective of all these is to protect and safeguard the interest of the Religious Institutions
and Endowments and to do everything in a transparent manner in order to see that the Religious
Institutions and Endowments are not exploited by any such unscrupulous person, even at times by
the person/s in- charge having evil eyes and intention of their own standing detrimental to the
interest and benefit of the Religious Institutions and Endowments, which thus can be prevented and
dealt with stern hands under the law in palce. The other purpose is to bring everything to the notice
of the general public who have the interest in the Religious Institutions/Endowments and thus their
faith does not recede.
Sub-section 4 of section-19 provides that the Trustee or any person having interest may file an
Appeal within the time period to the State Government to modify the order or seeking to set aside
the order of the learned Commissioner sanctioning such transfer in the matter of such transfer of
the immovable property of the Religious Institutions/Endowments. The State Government even
without there being any Appeal when finds that the alienation is not necessary or beneficial to the
Religious Institution or that the consideration fixed in respect of the transfer is inadequate may
within 90 (ninety) days from the date of receipt of the order communicated under sub-section-3 or
the date of publication of the order whichever is later, call for the record from the learned
Commissioner and after giving opportunity of hearing to the parties concerned revise the order of
the learned Commissioner.
Sub-section 7 of section -19 provides that the order of learned Commissioner made under section
19(1) shall be subject to orders, if any, passed in an Appeal or Revision which shall be final.
23. At this moment, it strikes to us, the legislative intent of providing the right of Appeal in this
matter. The person aggrieved by an order of the learned Commissioner is given the right to question,
the said order before Government on the ground that the transfer is not necessary and/or beneficial
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131166151/ 18
Radha Krishna Lalita Temple vs In W.P.(C) No.25751 Of 202 on 22 April, 2024
to or in the interest of the Hindu Religious Institutions/Endowments. The price component thus
gets included to be retested only with reference to the benefit and the interest of the Religious
Institutions/Endowments and keeping that angle in mind and only viewing in that light. The
provisions have to be given a holistic reading in order to cull out the holistic approach to be made in
Appeal. In the present case, when the prayer of the Interim Managing Trustee representing the
Religious Institution for sale of the immovable property belonging to the Religious Institution had
been allowed, the Appellant-Religious Institution represented by that Interim Trustee, had nothing
at all to feel aggrieved. More so, as already stated when the property in question was not put to
auction at the upset price of Rs.70,00,000/- per Acre as fixed by the learned Commissioner, the
prayer of said Interim Trustee representing the Religious Institution only seeking reduction of the
said upset price by carrying an Appeal is not understood as to how at all was to the benefit and in the
interest of the Religious Institution.
24. Furthermore, when nothing is stated that the upset price so fixed was with a view to foil the
move for sale and that it ultimately would not materialize without further indicating as what
approximately should be the adequate price to be fixed as the upset price, the Appeal at the behest of
that Interim Trustee ought to have been dismissed in limini as the Religious Institution when that
Interim Trustee was representing had nothing to be aggrieved by said order as to the upset price
fixed by the learned Commissioner for the auction sale of the immovable property of the Religious
Institution. The right of appeal to modify the order or set it aside as finds mention in sub-section 4
of section 19 of the O.H.R.E. Act, being read harmoniously with all the other sub-sections
thereunder; keeping in view the objective behind the insertion of section 19 in the OHRE Act, clearly
spell out the intention of the legislature that it was so available to reconsider the view referred to in
the orders by which the learned Commissioner has refused to grant sanction or if granted that is in
part but not the whole but certainly not at all in respect of the conditions imposed/fixed and
directions given unless any of those are asserted to be standing adverse to the interest of the
Religious Institution or detriment to its interest without going to benefit but to cause sufferance and
hardship. It becomes more clear when we find in sub-section-5 that the State Government reserves
the right to revise the order only when the alienation is not "necessary or beneficial to the Religious
Institution", which thus empowers the State Government to annul the sanction for sale given by the
learned Commissioner and when the consideration fixed for the transfer is "inadequate", then also
the State Government is empowered to increase the consideration fixed for transfer as would be so
decided as adequate. Therefore, we are of the considered view that no right of Appeal is available
and lies seeking modification of the directions and conditions fixed by the learned Endowment
Commissioner while sanctioning the sale except as stated hereinabove. The provision of law having
given the power to the learned Commissioner to fix any such directions or conditions whiling
granting the sanction for transfer of immovable property belonging to the Religious Institution as it
deems fit and proper and necessary in the interest of the Religious Institution and Endowments and
as beneficial to the Religious Institution and Endowments, no Appeal lies to tinker with such
directions or conditions unless it is shown to be arbitrary and unreasonable, being tested in the
touchstone of the tests as afore-stated and being shown that those directions/conditions were so
deliberately fixed in order to see that the purpose for which the permission/sanction has been
accorded is in that way for such harsh, unreasonable and arbitrary conditions/directions becomes
futile. Any such direction/condition on being found to be unworkable in the field and are unable to

be pressed into service are permissible to be modified/substituted only by the learned
Commissioner and none-else as it is the learned Commissioner, who as per law, is the Super
Guardian sitting to exercise all such power of superintendence over the Trustees, who are the
guardians of the Religious Institutions and Endowments in the field. The only exception remains
that the consideration fixed by the learned Endowment Commissioner being inadequate the same
can be sought to be enhanced by filing Appeal and on that score the Appeal very much lies as it
certainly is in the interest of the Religious Institution and for its benefit.
We are of the firm view that the Religious Institution has no right of Appeal at all seeking reduction
of consideration, as in the given case, the upset price and the Appeal for that reason is not at all
entertainable. The present Appeal by the Religious Institution being against such order of fixation of
the upset price seeking to reduce it substantially which has huge financial implications (which has
taken place in the given case) being not entertainable in the eye of law as per the view, which we
have taken upon interpretation of the provision contained in section- 19 of the OHRE Act, the order
of the Hon'ble Minister, on this ground, is also nonest in the eye of law.
All these, being cumulatively viewed, the present Appeal does not appear to us to be one by the
Religious Institution represented by that Interim Managing Trustee but on Appeal by the said
Interim Managing Trustee in his individual capacity either for serving his own interest or for serving
interest of some others and for their benefit but certainly not for the benefit and interest of the
Religious Institution.
25. Before parting further, we feel it pertinent to make some observations, which we sincerely hope,
will be of immense help to the Authority dealing with such cases and in our view those cannot be
lightly brushed aside. Also, we are of the view that if examination is not made in the light of those,
then the finding on the issue may not stand to the legal scrutiny made in the backdrop of the
objective behind the enactment.
Presently in these matters of immovable property a catch twenty-two situation has arrived and,
therefore, also in cases of necessity for sale, it has to be anxiously thought for a while whether
looking at all the relevant factors, sale is necessary for the whole area or a part and then if in part, by
utilizing a portion of the obtained sale consideration for preservation and protection of the rest part
if would be in the better interest and serving more to the benefit of the Religious
Institution/Endowments. The preservation when made if would fetch much more return, then the
disposal of the immovable property belonging to the Religious Institutions/Endowments in entirety
would not justifiably stand as a decision to test the legal scrutiny. These aspects cannot be
overlooked and it is imperative to consider all those. If one thinks for a moment about sale of
properties and deposit of sale proceeds viewing the rising trend of rate of inflation and
simultaneously to check it, the decreasing trend of interest rate on deposits, it would be justified and
reasonable to accept that in future a time may come when the sum that would be accruing towards
interest would hardly be sufficient to meet the expenses for performance of even very few or even
one of the Niti-Kantis and at that time certainly repentance may come that preservation and
protection of property being made if the sale would have been withheld, that would have yielded the
real benefit and the grave situation would have been so prevented. At that moment, the sale made in

past would prove to be a foolish/wrong move, detriment to the interest of the Religious
Institutions/Endowments. But then nothing would be left in the hands to put the clock the other
way round. So, it is really the important need for due application of mind without being oblivious to
the ground realities, the prevailing situation and accordingly thinking of future with a realistic
approach.
Taking all these into consideration, a balance has to be struck. Simply because a land is likely to be
encroached being in an important or upcoming/growing/developing locality or not fetching income,
the necessity for sale be not the only option to be adopted/chosen. First of all where the Religious
Institution/Endowment is having sustainable income, the examination should be to explore all such
possibilities of protection and preservation of the immovable properties for much more benefit in
future before saying that necessity at said moment for sale exists. These being important
observations taking into account the ground realities in the present days real estate development
and user scenario, the authority ordained with such onerous responsibility and duty must keep in
mind while in seisin of these types of proceeding, lest it may amount to improper exercise or gross
failure to exercise the jurisdiction vested in them as per law. We cannot shut our eyes to the reality
that when population explosion is continuing, in our march for development, employment
generation and economic growth with establishment of large number of various industries in the
anvil, there has been dearth shortage and availability of land and it is so happening at a faster pace
than what used to take place in past years. This position is going to continue and in the days to
come, it is expected to be more at much faster rate as is said by all noted futurist to which Authority
cannot also turn deaf ears.
26. Further, while deciding to allow the sale the method to be adopted as to whether for sale of large
patch of land in one go or in piecemeal is certainly standing as a requirement to be dealt, as a
precondition in order to ensure optimum benefit to the Religious Institutions/Endowments by way
of encouraging and increasing competition. These decisions of course will vary from case to case
because of varying situations which cannot be exhaustively stated. But ignoring these, if the
Authority proceeds, the days may not be too far to see the extinction of these Religious
Institutions/Endowments having adverse affect on our social fabric and living which has their
foundation deeply rooted to these Institutions which we have accepted as integral part of our society
and life. The law makers keeping in mind that the Trustees may even honestly commit the mistake
in taking a decision for alienation, have, therefore, put a rider to vest on them the power or authority
in laying down that it can only be done with prior permission of the learned Commissioner
appointed under section 4 of the O.H.R.E. Act prescribing the powers and duties under section 7 of
the Act. So, the Authority permitting the same has a very responsible function to discharge and duty
to perform in this regard. Once the permission is given, the same must be backed by all sorts of
justifications including those in tune of our above observations which the Authority is called upon
and rather mandated to consider in the present days scenario. All these aspects, however, have not
been touched upon by the learned Commissioner and also in the order of the Appellate Authority in
Appeal.
27. In the result, the writ petitions are allowed. The orders passed on 01.03.2019 in O.A. Appal No.2
of 2019 are hereby quashed.

Consequently, all said actions/deeds, which have taken place pursuant to and in consequence of the
said order which we have quashed are hereby declared null and void and also quashed. The
registered sale deed dated 03.09.2020 in respect of the land in question measuring Ac.07.871
decimals in favour of the Opposite Party No.8 is accordingly declared as void, inoperative and
having no force in the eye of law.
The learned Commissioner Endowments is directed to take all such effective steps within a period of
two months hence to ensure that the immovable property measuring Ac.7.871 decimals (Seven Acre
Eight Hundred Seventy One decimals) belonging to the Religious Institution remains in the hands of
the Religious Institution which is presently managed by the Non-hereditary Trust Board for the
beneficial enjoyment of the Religious Institution in its best interest and in serving the same.
Since, by now more than four years have passed from the order of the learned Commissioner of
Endowment and as it is said by the Non-hereditary Trustees that the requirement for sale of the
immovable property of the said Religious Institution does no more stand as the need in view of flow
of funds to the Religious Institution from other sources; said order dated 11.12.2018 passed by the
learned Commissioner, Endowment in O.A. No.8 of 2004 permitting sale of the land in question is
held to have spent its force and, therefore, it is declared that said order would no more hold the field
so as to be having any force in the eye of law and as such does no more stand to be carried out.
Viewing the conduct of the Opposite Party No.7 that he, being the Interim Managing Trustee of the
Religious Institution, as stated above, has acted in a manner and has been rigorously pursuing the
matter even before us in this proceeding, which must have been at the expense of the very Religious
Institution; which is highly detriment to the interest of the Religious Institution and running
adverse to the Institution and thereby abusing his position as had been assigned, we hereby impose
cost of Rs.5,00,000/- (Rupees Five Lakhs) to be deposited by him in the account of the said
Religious Institution within a period of two (2) months hence; failing which it would be realized by
the Commissioner Endowments as the outstanding dues payable to the Religious Institution as per
law and invite other legal consequences.
The above deposit shall remain in an unencumbered Fixed Deposit in any Nationalized Bank for a
period of ten (10) years further renewable from time to time as per the order of the learned
Commissioner of Endowments and the interest earned therefrom shall pass on to the Savings Bank
Account of the Religious Institution for being spent in the day-to-day affairs of the said Institution
and performance of Nits-Kantis and Seva Puja.
The consideration amount of Rs.1,40,00,000/- (Rupees One Crore Forty Lakhs) kept by the
Opposite Party No.8 in deposit on 05.06.2020 in the name of the Religious Institution under
Annexure-R/8 remaining pledged to the learned Commissioner, Endowments, Bhubaneswar be
refunded to the Opposite Party No.8 within two weeks hence observing the legal formalities.
28. The Writ Petitions are accordingly disposed of.
