ORDER
This petition has been filed seeking direction to the learned Sessions Judge, Special Court for SC/ST
(PoA) Cases, Chengalpattu District, to consider the petitioners' bail application in Crime No.393 of
2021 on the file of the respondent police, on the same day, in the event of their surrender.
2 The respondent police registered a case against the petitioners for the offence under Sections 147,
447, 294(b), 506(i) of IPC r/w Section 3(i)(s) of SC/ST (PoA) Amendment Act, 2015 in Crime
No.393 of 2021. Since the petitioners apprehend arrest by the respondent police in the above case,
filed this petition invoking Section 482 of Cr.P.C. seeking to direct the Court below to consider the
bail application, on the same day, in the event of their surrender.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 3 Heard the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners and the
learned Government Advocate (Crl.Sid) appearing for the respondents and perused the materials
available on record.
4 It is seen that the respondent police registered the present case against the petitioners for the
offence 147, 447, 294(b), 506(i) of IPC r/w Section 3(i)(s) of SC/ST (PoA) Amendment Act, 2015 in
Crime No.393 of 2021. It is to be noted that, if the accused charged for the offence under the Special
Act viz. SC/ST (PoA) Amendment Act, 2015, Section 438 of Cr.P.C.
would not apply and it is barred by the Special Act. It is useful to refer Sections 18 to 21 of the SC/ST
(PoA) Amendment Act, 2015:
18. Section 438 of the Code not to apply to persons committing an offence under the
Act - Nothing in section 438 of the Code shall apply in relation to any case of the code
involving the arrest of any person on an accusation of having committed an offence

Arumugam vs The Deputy Superintendent Of Police on 31 December, 2021
any person; or
(b) the Investigating officer shall not require approval for the arrest, if necessary, of any person,
against whom an accusation of having committed an offence under this Act has been made and no
prcodure other than that provided under this Act or the Code shall apply.
(2) The provisions of section 438 of Code shall not apply to a case under this Act, notwithstanding
any judgment or order or direction of any Court.
19. Section 360 of the Code or the provision of the Probation of Offenders Act not to apply to
persons guilty of an offence under the Act – The provisions of Section 360 of the Code and the
provisions of the Probations of Offenders Act, 1958 (20 of 1958) shall not apply to any person above
the age of eighteen who is found guilty of having committed an offence under this Act.
20. Act to override other laws – Save as otherwise provided in this Act, the provisions of this Act
shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the
time being in force or any custom or usage or any instrument having effect by virtue of any such law.
21. Duty of Government to ensure effective implementation of the Act. - (1) Subject to such rules as
the Central https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Government may make in this behalf, the State
Government shall take such measures as may be necessary for the effective implementation of this
Act.
(2) In particular, and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing provisions, such measures
may include, -
(i)the provision for adequate facilities, including legal aid, to the persons subjected to atrocities to
enable them to avail themselves of justice;
(ii) the provision for travelling and maintenance expenses to witnesses, including the victims of
atrocities, during investigation and trial of offences under this Act;
(iii) the provision for the economic and social rehabilitation of the victims of the atrocities;
(iv) the appointment of officers for initiating or exercising supervision over prosecutions for the
contravention of the provisions of this Act;
(v) the setting up of committees at such appropriate levels as the State Government may think fit to
assist that Government in formulation or implementation of such measures,
(vi) provision for a periodic survey of the working of the provisions of this Act with a view to

Arumugam vs The Deputy Superintendent Of Police on 31 December, 2021
(vii) the identification of the areas where the members of the Scheduled Casetes and the Scheduled
Tribes are likely to be https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis subjected to atrocities and adoption of such
measures so as to ensure safety for such members.
(3) The Central Government shall take such steps as may be necessary to co-ordinate the measures
taken by the State Governments under sub-section (1).
(4) The Central Government shall, every year, place on the table of each House of parliament a
report on the measures taken by itself and by the State Governments in pursuance of the provisions
of this section. Therefore, Section 438 of Cr.P.C. is barred by the Special Act.
5 Further, it is relevant to refer to Section 15-A(3) and (5) of the Act, which reads as follows:
“(3).A Victim or his dependent shall have the right to reasonable, accurate, and
timely notice of any Court proceeding including any bail proceeding and the Special
Public Prosecutor or the State Government shall inform the victim about any
proceedings under this Act.
(5)A victim or his dependent shall be entitled to be heard at any proceeding under
this Act in respect of bail, discharge, release, parole, conviction or sentence of an
accused or any connected proceedings or arguments and file written submission on
conviction, acquittal or sentencing.” On reading of the above provisions of the Special
Act, it is clear that before https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis considering the bail
application, the victim or his dependent should be heard and they should be given
opportunity to offer their objections/representations. It is seen that the petitioners
did not even add the defacto complaint in this petition as party. Therefore, this Court
is of the considered view that the petitioners, in order to bye-pass the above two
provisions of the Special Act, with an intention to escape from the clutches of law,
have invoked Section 482 of Cr.P.C. for getting bail. Unfortunately, the Investigating
Officers are also aiding the accused to escape from the clutches of law and the culprits
with connivance of the Investigating Officer, are managing to escape from the arrest.
6 Further, the enormous power under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. should not be invoked automatically
and the jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C.
should be exercised sparingly. When there is specific bar under the Special Act, this Court cannot
ignore the intention of the Legislators and the purpose of enactment of the Special Act.
7 Under such circumstances, this Court is not inclined to invoke Section 482 of Cr.P.C., which would
amount to ignoring the provisions of the Special Act. Therefore, this petition shall stand dismissed.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 8 On 29.12.2021, when the matter was taken up for hearing, this
Court directed the respondent police to produce the petitioners/accused before this Court on
31.12.2021.

9 Accordingly, today i.e. 31.12.2021, when the matter is taken up for hearing, the learned
Government Advocate (Crl.Side) appearing for the respondents would submit that the calls of the
petitioners Cell Phones are being traced out by the respondent police and hence seeks some more
time to secure the petitioners.
10 It is seen that the occurrence has taken place on 19.12.2021 and the FIR has been registered on
20.12.2021 and the respondent police did not take any steps to secure the accused. Even after
directions of this Court also the Investigating Officer did not take any effective steps to arrest the
accused, which shows lethargic attitude of the Investigating Officer. Further, it is to be noted that
the petitioners/accused have filed the present petition seeking to consider their bail application, in
the event of their surrenders, which means they are readily available in their local area. The
Investigating Officer, with an intention https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis to help the
petitioners/accused to escape from the clutches of law, did not secure them. Further, there is a
prima facie case made out for arresting the accused, the Investigating Officer neither care to Section
18-A of the Act nor the order of this Court dated 29.12.2021, for which, this Court highly contemn
the Investigating Officer.
11 Therefore, the Inspector General of Police, under whose control the Investigating Officer is
working, is directed to take departmental action against the Investigating Officer and file an Action
Taken Report on the same before this Court preferably before the second week of January 2022.
List the matter in the second week of January 2022.
