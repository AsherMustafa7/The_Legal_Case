THIS WRIT PETITION HAVING BEEN HEARD AND
RESERVED FOR ORDERS, COMING ON
FOR PRONOUNCEMENT OF ORDER THIS DAY, G.NARENDAR J.,
MADE THE FOLLOWING:
ORDER
Heard the learned Senior counsel Sri S M
Chandrashekar along with learned counsel for the
petitioner. Learned AAG Sri Subramanya along with learned HCGP Sri Venkatasatyanarayana A for
respondent No.1 and learned Senior counsel Sri D R Ravishankar along with learned counsel Sri V B
Vijayakumar for respondent No.2.
2. The petitioner who was discharging duties as Director of the Directorate of Minorities, Minority
Welfare Department was transferred out of the post by impugned order dated 23.07.2021 and
aggrieved he approached the Tribunal. The Tribunal after a detailed hearing has been pleased to
negate the challenge on the short ground that he does not possess the eligibility stipulated under the
C and R (Cadre and Recruitment) Rules of the minority department i.e.., the Karnataka Minorities
Welfare Services (Cadre and Recruitment) Rules, 2010 published on 15.03.2011 (hereinafter
referred to as the 2011 Rules for the sake of brevity). That the petitioner being in the cadre of Deputy
Secretary was ineligible to be appointed as the Director of the Minorities Department, as the C and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130365118/ 2
Mahiboob Sab vs The State Of Karnataka on 31 May, 2022
R Rules stipulates that the director can only be from among the cadre of Karnataka Administrate
Services (Selection Grade/Higher Pay scale) or Indian Administrative Service (IAS) (Senior Scale
Officer). On that short ground the Tribunal was pleased to repel the challenge mounted by the
petitioner.
3. It is contended on behalf of the petitioner that the post of Deputy Secretary is equivalent in grade
to that of IAS and KAS Officer of Senior scale. In this regard the learned senior counsel would invite
the attention of the Court to the notification issued by the Department of Personnel and
Administrative Reforms bearing No.DPAR 105 SRD 2014, Bengaluru, dated 10.07.2019 and would
take the Court to Schedule I and more particularly would draw the attention to the entry at Sl.No.17
wherein the filling up of the post of Deputy Secretary to Government, Karnataka Government
Secretariat is shown to be by way of promotion from the cadre of Under Secretary to Government,
Karnataka Government Secretariat Services or by posting of IAS and KAS (Group A) (Senior scale)
officers and he would further take the Court through the Note I, which states that out of the posts of
Deputy Secretaries 12 posts shall be filled up by posting IAS or KAS group A (Senior scale officers).
Provided that six posts in the cadre of Deputy Secretaries to Government shall be filled up by the
deputation of officers of the Karnataka Administrative Services shall be filled up by the deputation
of the Karnataka Administrative Services (Senior scale) subject to the condition that an equal
number of officers of the Karnataka Government Secretariat Services are deputed to any other State
Civil Services.
4. From a reading of the above it is apparent that by the said notification the Government has, as a
policy permitted the appointment of officers of the KAS Group A (Senior scale officers) to be posted
as Deputy Secretaries and officiate in the in the post of the Karnataka Government Secretariat.
Further reading of the note only states that the said postings are subject to the condition that an
equal number of officers of the Karnataka Government Secretariat Services are deputed to any other
State Civil Services and in that view he would contend that the posting of the petitioner cannot be
faulted with on the ground that the C and R Rules do not permit the posting of the non KAS or non
IAS officer to the post of Director. In our opinion the said contention is fallacious and requires to be
rejected at the threshold itself. Eligibility once stipulated requires to be adhered to strictly. Merely
because, by the above notification the Karnataka Government Secretariat Services Recruitment
Rules of 2019 enabled the posting of the officers of KAS Group A (Senior scale) to be posted in the
Secretariat Services Department and stipulation of a quid pro quo in the cadre and recruitment
Rules of 2019 of the Karnataka Government Secretariat Services Recruitment Rules, 2019 cannot be
construed as automatically amending C and R Rules of the Karnataka Minorities Welfare Services
(Cadre and Recruitment) Rules, 2010 published on 15.03.2011. The stipulation with regard to the
qualification required to be possessed by the candidates to be appointed as Director, has not been
amended and remains the same. In our opinion it would be fallacious to contend that the C and R
Rules should be deemed to have been amended in view of the amendment carried out to the C and R
Rules of another department/wing of the Government. In our opinion, the case canvassed is too far
fetched and if accepted would result in undesirable consequences and deemed amendments are
unknown to the canons of service law.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130365118/ 3
Mahiboob Sab vs The State Of Karnataka on 31 May, 2022
5. In that view of the matter, the said contention requires to be rejected. To that extent we also
affirm the order of the Tribunal, but while so doing we are constrained to express our dismay the
manner in which the Tribunal has appreciated two rulings of the Division Bench and two rulings of
its own and incidentally one ruling which is by the same bench.
6. A coordinate bench of this Court while disposing of W.P. No.43919/2016 while appreciating the
case of the petitioner therein has been pleased to observe and hold as under :
"2. Prima facie, it appears that the practice on the part of the concerned authority of
transferring an officer from one place to another and the other officer, who is
working at the transferred place is directed to approach before the Government for
his posting, can be said as ex facie by non-application of mind and without there
being any consideration of the fact that at the transferred place, another officer is
already working and he is also required to be simultaneously posted at some other
place. Then only, the vacancy would be available for the earlier officer. For example,
if 'A' is posted, in place of 'B', 'B' is required to be posted somewhere else by
identification of the post. As such, unless the order of transfer of 'B' is passed posting
him to any other place in law, there is no vacancy available for 'A'. Prima facie, the
method adopted is a reverse cycle not known to law and therefore, if not factual
malafide, it would be a legal malafide. Hence, we would have stayed the transfer
order by ad interim order, but as the charge is already taken over by respondent
No.2, before we pass further order, we find it appropriate to direct the State
Government to produce the original file and if respondent No.2 is desirous to make
any submission by filing statement of objections, he may do so."
7. From a reading of the above it is apparent that the Coordinate Bench, even by its interim order, as
noted supra has by its order dated 28.02.2016, had been pleased to hold that transfer of a person
without him being posted elsewhere amounts to a legal malafide i.e., where 'A' is ordered to be
transferred out of his post without there being a movement order against him. In the instant case
the order under challenge would reflect that there is no order transferring the petitioner out of the
said post, but despite the post being occupied the second respondent has been transferred to the
post of Director when the same was not vacant. This aspect has been appreciated by the coordinate
bench and has categorically held that such a transfer would constitute a legal malafide. Proceeding
further the coordinate bench has observed and held in paras 12 and 13 as follows:
"12. The aforesaid record including the statement of objection filed by respondent
No.2 shows the following aspects apparent:
1. When respondent No.2 was directed to be posted by way of transfer by the
impugned order dated 29.07.2016, the petitioner is not simultaneously posted at any
other place.
2. In the order may be of general transfer, nothing is mentioned about the
administrative ground, more particularly, on the aspects as to why the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130365118/ 4
Mahiboob Sab vs The State Of Karnataka on 31 May, 2022
posting/transfer order of the petitioner at any place is not passed.
3. The transfer order is passed in contravention of the guidelines, inasmuch as the
minimum period of two years was not complete and as per the transfer guidelines if
any Officer is to be transferred prior to the expiry of the minimum period of two
years, the approval of the Hon'ble Chief Minister is required, which has not been
obtained.
4. The respondent No.2 appears to have been accommodated by his posting at his
native place may be for his personal ground and circumstances.
5. Inspite of the aforesaid prima facie observations by this Court in order dated
20.08.2016 instead of restoring the petitioner at the place where he was earlier
working, further order is passed for posting of the petitioner at a different place and
the resultant effect is that the impugned transfer order which is subject matter of the
petition before this Court is sought to be implemented by posting of the petitioner at
a new place which was not mentioned in the transfer order.
13. The aforesaid facts and circumstances goes to show that at the first instance, the
transfer order is suffering from legal malafide inasmuch as unless the vacancy was
created of the petitioner by transferring him to a different place, the respondent No.2
could not have been posted at the place where the petitioner was working"
8. The coordinate bench disapproving the action was further pleased to direct passing of
consequential orders in respect of the government servant who had been transferred to an occupied
post and further held that such a government servant would not be entitled to continue to work in
the said post. We are in respectful agreement with the findings of the coordinate bench and would
have unhesitatingly tread the path but for the sole reason that the continuation of the petitioner
would be in contravention of the very C and R Rules of 2010 (15.3.2011). In that view of the matter,
only we are constrained to affirm that part of the order.
9. We also not with dismay that despite the orders of the Division Bench in Hittalmani's case and
Devendrappa S Biradar's case again by a coordinate bench being placed before the Tribunal. The
Tribunal has acted with scant regard and pointedly ignored the legal proposition settled by the
coordinate bench. The consideration of these rulings of the division benches and this court and that
of the Tribunal is reflected in para 4. Apart from that the petitioner has relied on rulings, the
Tribunal, which is bound by the law laid down by the Division Benches has omitted any
consideration of the same. More so when the case of V G Hittalmani was applicable to certain facts
of the case. Atleast to the extent that the second respondent herein could not have been posted to an
occupied post which was not vacant. To that extent the Tribunal was bound to follow the precedent
and ought to have set aside the order or ought to have quashed the order even if it desired not to
continue the petitioner in the post.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130365118/ 5
Mahiboob Sab vs The State Of Karnataka on 31 May, 2022
10. The other aspect of the Hittalmani's case which was binding on the Tribunal is that an officer
could not have been left without a post. The Tribunal for reasons best known has completely ignored
and has not assigned any reasons for not appreciating the rulings. Reading of para Nos.4 and 6 of
the judgment does not reflect any appreciation nor reveals any reasoning for the judgments placed
before not being appreciated and followed. As stated earlier any order of this court restoring the
petitioner to the post would amount to restoring an illegal order i.e., the order dated 29.05.2021 by
which the petitioner came to be posted as the Director of the Minorities Welfare Department as the
same is contrary to the very C and R Rules.
11. With regard to the posting of the second respondent it has been contended by the learned Senior
counsel Sri S M Chandrashekar that the second respondent is also not entitled to be appointed as
the Director. He would strenuously contend that the second respondent belongs to the KAS (Junior
scale) and that the C and R Rules permit only a KAS officer of the selection grade or higher pay scale
to be appointed as the director and that on that ground also the Tribunal erred in not allowing the
application and on the short ground that the second respondent does not satisfy the stipulation
under the C and R Rules has been glossed over by the Tribunal and that the same is wholly
unsustainable.
12. We have perused all the pleadings and material produced. There is no document which
demonstrates the movement of the second respondent from Junior scale to selection grade as on the
date of his appointment as the Director of the minorities department. The Tribunal has rejected the
contention regarding the ineligibility of the second respondent to hold the post by placing reliance
on a communication addressed by a senior accounts officer (Annexure R6) to the Under Secretary to
Government, DPAR (Services-II) dated 8/9-7-2021 which letter has been extracted by the Tribunal
in para 6 and which reads as under:
"Sub: Furnishing of Officiation Certificate under Rule 53(f) of KCSRs in respect of Sri
H.R.Shivakumar, KAS (Sel Gr)-reg.
Ref: No.DPAR 30 ASV 2021 dated 23/03.2021.
Please refer to the above.
I am to inform you that the annual increment date of Sri H.R.Shivakumar, KAS (Sel.
Gr) has been revised to 01/07/2021 consequent upon regulation of pay in accordance
with the Karnataka Civil Services (1998 Batch Gazetted Probationers) (Declaration of
Probation &Fixation of Pay) (Special) Rules, 2021.
The Government vide letter under reference had already furnished officiation
certificate with effect from 29/11/2019 to 23/03/2021. However, in order to release
the annual increment due on 01/07/2021, officiation certificate under Rule 53(f) of
KCSRs is required with effect from 24/03/2021 since the Officer is on Foreign
Service at Karnataka Road Development Corporation Ltd., Bengaluru from
13/02/2020 onwards. The same may be forwarded to this office at the earliest to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130365118/ 6
Mahiboob Sab vs The State Of Karnataka on 31 May, 2022
release increment due to the officer on 01/07/2021."
13. From a reading of the above it is apparent that the pay scale of selection grade has been granted
to the second respondent and that the said officiation certificate has been issued in terms of Rule
53F as the officer i.e., the second respondent was on foreign service or in other words his service
were lent to the Karnataka Road Development Corporation Limited. This officiation certificate
cannot by any stretch of imagination be construed to be a proceeding under the rules whereby the
second respondent would be recognized to have been promoted or conferred a selection grade. The
reasoning otherwise by the Tribunal in our considered opinion is highly fallacious and
unsustainable. Merely because the second respondent has been given the pay scale as on July, 2021
in the absence of any proceedings promoting him to selection grade, it can by no stretch of
imagination be concluded that a mere communication amounts to a proceeding promoting the
petitioner to selection grade and the finding otherwise by the Tribunal would be wholly
unsustainable. The petitioner has produced a document issued by the DPAR Department (Services -
II) Under Secretary wherein in para 2 it is stated as under:

Mahiboob Sab vs The State Of Karnataka on 31 May, 2022
14. From a reading of the above it is apparent that the second respondent came to be appointed to
the KAS cadre (junior scale) on 15.06.2019 and post 15.6.2019 no order promoting the second
respondent has been passed as on 19.8.2021. The above information only reiterates the fact that the
second respondent also does not qualify to be appointed as director of the minorities welfare
department as the C and R Rules clearly stipulates that only a KAS officer of selection grade is
eligible to be appointed.
15. The action of the first respondent is sought to be defended by the Additional Advocate General
Sri R Subramanya. In support an affidavit of one Umadevi, Under Secretary to Government, DPAR
(Services-II) dated 23.11.2021 came to be filed. In para 5 it is deposed as under:
"5. I submit that the Respondent No.2 - Sri H.R.Shivakumar is a KAS (Junior scale)
officer whose pay has been fixed in KAS (Selection Grade) Post from 20.09.2019 in
the pay scale of Rs.90,500 - Rs.1,23,300/- in accordance with the Rule 5 of Karnataka
Civil Services (1998 Batch Gazetted Probationsers) (Declaration of probation and
fixation of pay)(Special), Rules 2021, and the same is herewith produced and marked
as ANNEXURE-R1. Accordingly, the officers pay has been regulated from Office of
the Accountant General (A&E), Karnataka, Bengaluru vide Pay Salary Slip letter
dated 09.07.2021 and the same is herewith produced and marked as Annexure-R2."
16. From the reading of the said paragraph the designation of the second respondent is described as
KAS (junior scale), but that he has been awarded selection grade pay scale from 20.09.2019 under
the provisions of Rule 5 of the Karnataka Civil Services (1998) (gazetted probationers) (Declaration
of probation and fixation of pay)(special), Rules 2021. It would not be out of place to state that this
is nothing but an attempt to divert the Court from the issue of eligibility which is so vehemently
canvassed against the petitioner. It is nothing but some smart drafting. The affidavit though
describes his designation as junior scale, it would place the bogey of him being given a selection
grade pay scale. The qualification or eligibility stipulated under the C and R Rules is not a pay scale,
but the grade or designation of office i.e., the occupant of a designated office, stipulated in the C and
R rules, is alone entitled to be appointed as the director.
17. The history of appointing the second respondent is also produced along with the affidavit i.e.,
notification dated 22.3.2021 which details the history which preceded and mandated the framing of
special rules, 2021. The reading of Rule 2-B, would leave no doubt in the mind of this Court, that the
second respondent who was appointed only in 2019 could not have been conferred or promoted to
selection grade and there is nothing to show that as on the date of their entry into service they were
conferred with any higher grade other than the entry level grade of Junior scale. Rule 4 also provides
for a deemed declaration of the probation. This only leaves us bewildered as to how an officer, with
no administrative experience came to be appointed as Director of a department. In other words, to
head an organization. This fact leaves us bewilder and wondering if there are no competent and
"experienced hands" available in government service to head and give direction to an organization.
We are unable to fathom the reasons behind the appointment of this person, to head and capable of
giving direction to an organization.

Mahiboob Sab vs The State Of Karnataka on 31 May, 2022
18. The reason for fixing and awarding the pay scale of a higher grade is also not difficult to
decipher. From a reading of the Special Rules it is seen that Rule 5 is compensatory nature as
regards the scales of pay but the rules do not confer nor are we able to decipher any deemed
conferment of the higher level than the entry level of KAS junior scale. Another document i.e.,
enclosed along with the affidavit is one that emanates from the office of the Accountant General (A
and D), Karnataka. This document is dated 07.07.2021 further obviates any discussion and leaves
no doubt in the mind of the Court that the second respondent was appointed as a KAS (junior scale)
officer and as on the date of his appointment as the director he continued in the said cadre only i.e.,
KAS (junior grade). To the said affidavit the petitioner has preferred objections.
19. The learned AAG would strenuously canvass that the second respondent having been granted
selection grade pay scale it ought to be construed that the petitioner has been conferred or his
occupying or is promoted to KAS selection grade. In our opinion the second respondent became
entitle to the pay scale on account of the special rules of 2021 and but for the said rules persons like
the petitioners would have been drawing the pay scale attached to their grade i.e., KAS (Junior
Scale). We are flummoxed by this contention and unable to appreciate the attempt of the AAG to
generalize and contend contrary to the special rules, that the grant of the pay scale ought to be
construed as conferring the selection grade itself. This in our considered opinion is contrary to the
mandate and scheme of the service rules and contrary even to the scheme of the special rules. If it
was the intendment of the legislature to confer any such special concession in respect of the
post/grade then the same would have found an expression in an appropriate manner.
20. As noted supra, the special rules do not provide for any such out of turn promotion or deemed
conferment of such grade or cadre. The case canvassed by the learned AAG, in our considered
opinion, is in the teeth of the special rules and the same being contrary to all known canons of
service law, we have no hesitation to reject the same.
21. Our findings are further fortified by the two documents produced by the petitioner along with a
memo dated 12.01.2022. One is the true copy of the notification dated 03.01.2022, whereby officers
who had been transferred by the Election Commission came to be retransferred. The said document
is produced to demonstrate that there are four grades i.e., junior scale, senior scale, selection grade
and super time scale in the KAS cadre. The next document is a booklet published by the Government
of Karnataka and which is titled Civil List of KAS officers, 2020 and it indicates that the same has
been compiled and published by the department of personnel and administrative reforms,
Bengaluru. The booklet comprises of several lists pertaining to the different grades in the cadre of
KAS officers. One is KAS (Senior super time officers), KAS officers (super time scale officers), next is
KAS (selection grade officers) and the learned counsel would take this court to the list of KAS
officers of selection grade and would submit that the name of the second respondent is not found in
the list of KAS selection grade officers published as on 31.07.2020. The learned counsel would next
take the court through the next list i.e., KAS (Senior grade officers) and would point out that the
name of the petitioner is not found even in the said list.
22. Lastly the learned counsel would take us through the list of KAS (Junior scale) officers and point
out that the name of the second respondent is found at Sl.No.1 of the said list and he would highlight
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130365118/ 9
Mahiboob Sab vs The State Of Karnataka on 31 May, 2022
the date of joining and it is shown as 11.2.2020. He would further contend that this list which is
published by the department clearly falsifies the attempt made by the deponent i.e, the Under
Secretary of the said department itself.
23. Per contra, the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the second respondent would
primarily contend that the petitioner has no locus standi to question the appointment of the second
respondent as the Tribunal has found him ineligible (in terms of the C and R of the minority
department, 2011) to hold the post and in that view the petitioner has no locus standi to question the
correctness or otherwise of the order appointing the second respondent to the post of director.
24. At first blush the contention appears to be appealing on but in the facts and circumstances of the
case the said contention requires to be rejected at the threshold itself. Firstly, the petitioner has not
approached this Court in a public interested litigation nor is the petition in the nature of PIL.
Secondly, the petitioner is an aggrieved person as he is sought to be "transferred" from the post,
rather or in other words the second respondent has been appointed to the post occupied by the
petitioner. Whether he is eligible or not to hold the post is not the question or the issue that was
gone into by the respondent while appointing the second respondent to the post. Till date there is no
order of removal of the petitioner on the ground that the petitioner is ineligible to hold the post. On
the other hand the second respondent has been transferred to the post which was held and occupied
by the petitioner. In these circumstances it would be far fetched to not consider the petitioner as an
aggrieved person.
25. The first respondent having transferred the second respondent to the post occupied and held by
this petitioner, and it not being preceded by an order of removal, on the ground of ineligibility of the
petitioner to hold the post, it cannot be gainfully argued that the petitioner cannot have a grievance
against the order posting the second respondent to the post held by him.
26. That apart the order of the first respondent transferring the second respondent to the
petitioner's post is not simultaneously accompanied by an order of movement moving the petitioner
out of the said post. If that be the case the said orders are in the teeth of law laid down by the
coordinate bench in Hittalmani's case. Despite the said legal position staring at the Tribunal and the
respondents, both have acted contrary to the law occupying the field.
27. Be that as it may, the question of eligibility of the petitioner to hold the post is a case that has
been canvassed before the Tribunal only. Assuming that the petitioner was ineligible to hold the post
director, minority welfares department then the order transferring the second respondent ought to
have been preceded by an order removing or canceling the order appointing the petitioner as
director, department of Minorities Welfare. This is not the case of the respondents and the
respondents seek to justify the transfer orders on the ground of ineligibility of the petitioner to hold
the post. Whether at all these issues could have been gone into an application questioning the
correctness of the transfer order which is perse in the teeth of the law laid down by this Court in
Hittalmani's case is itself a moot question. Be that as it may, the contention canvassed by the second
respondent that the petitioner has no locus standi, is requires to be rejected and is accordingly
rejected as the challenge in the application before the Tribunal is to the order of transfer only on the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130365118/ 10
Mahiboob Sab vs The State Of Karnataka on 31 May, 2022
ground that the transfer order is contrary to the law laid down in Hittalmani's case.
28. Another fact which demonstrates that the order impugned before the Tribunal is hit by
Hittalmani's case is the addendum issued by the first respondent on 26.7.2021 whereby the first
respondent has by separate proceedings directed the petitioner to report to the parent department.
This by itself would suffice to demonstrate that the earlier order impugned in the application is
directly hit by the law laid down by the coordinate bench in Hittalmani's case wherein a transfer
order without there being a simultaneous order transferring the occupant of the post has been
decried and held to be a case of legal malafide.
29. The learned senior counsel would emphasize on the officiation certificate and the authorization
issued by the office of the Accountant General (A and D) Karnataka, Bengaluru, whereby the second
respondent has been granted the selection grade pay scale. Another document which is pressed into
effect is Annexure R2 produced by the second respondent which is yet again a document which
refers to giving pay scales in terms of Rule 5 of the 2021 rules. In fact the concluding part of the
sentence in the second para of the first page would obviate any discussions on the issue and negates
the contention that the second respondent has been conferred or given the KAS selection grade post.

31. It is further contended that in these special circumstances the question of insisting upon DPC to
infer conferment of the promotional post is unwarranted. It is contended that in view of the 2021
special rules it has to be construed that the second respondent has been conferred the promotional
post of KAS selection grade. Despite there being no specific provision atleast even a deeming
provisions in the rules which confer such a right on the candidates who were the beneficiaries under
the 2021 special rules. Rule 5 as noted supra has only granted a limited benefit of entitling the
petitioners to draw a salary equivalent to the post that they may have held had they been selected at
the first instance itself. In fact the rule further limits the financial benefits itself i.e., to state that it
would be only prospective in effect and prohibits the candidates from claiming any financial benefits
retrospectively. If that be the intendment of the legislature and where the legislature has deemed it
fit to restrict even the financial benefit it can by no stretch of imagination be considered and held
that the legislature intended to confer or grant deemed promotion to the candidates/beneficiaries
under the special rules. Hence the contention of the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of
the second respondent requires to be rejected on the basis of the very rule under which the second
respondent has been appointed and granted the pay scale. It is no more res integra that a seniority
of a person would commence from the date he is born in service. If the contention canvassed by the
AAG and the senior counsel is accepted it would amount to recognizing the date of entry or birth of
the second respondent in the service from 1998 itself of 2006 itself, which is clearly contrary to the
settled law. On that ground also the contention that promotional post of KAS selection grade ought
to deemed to have been considered requires to be rejected.
32. The learned AAG has relied upon two rulings reported in (2015) 11 SCC 669 rendered in the case
of National Institute of Technology and another vs. Pannalal Choudhury and another and another
ruling reported in (2003) 4 SCC 239 rendered in the case of High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan
vs. P P Singh and another to contend that the subsequent promotion granted to the second
respondent by notification dated 12.01.2022 would cure, the defect or ineligibility of the second
respondent to be appointed to the post of director stands cured. In this regard the learned AAG
would take this Court through the notification dated 12.01.2022 produced as Annexure R2 along
with the statement of objections filed on behalf of the first respondent on 21.01.2022. We are
constrained to express our displeasure. In our opinion this is an act of overreach by the first
respondent. The matter having been seized off by the courts drawing up proceedings and attempting
to cure any lacuna in the case during the pendency itself cannot be appreciated. That too attempting
to cure an incurable defect of eligibility certainly cannot be appreciated at all. As rightly contended
by the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner this is clearly an act of overreach.
33. Be that as it may, we do not wish to delve deeper into the merits of the said notification. It would
suffice to note that the notification places reliance on the 2021 rules for conferring the alleged
promotional post on the second respondent. The said proceedings further refers to a reliance on a
temporary seniority list/provisional seniority list for the purpose of conferring senior scale selection
grade to the officers who have been appointed in 2020 pursuant to the judgment of this Court
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130365118/ 12
Mahiboob Sab vs The State Of Karnataka on 31 May, 2022
rendered in 2016 and affirmed by the Apex Court. We have already held that the Special Rule of
2021 does provide for any deemed promotion or accelerated promotion.
34. As discussed above, it is settled law that seniority of a person will count from the date he is born
in service in other words the day on which he enters or reports to duty. In the instant case the
second respondent has entered service only in 2020 and granting of promotion without holding
DPC or legislating any special provision in this regard, is unknown to service law jurisprudence. We
do not wish to dwell deeper into the correctness/legality or otherwise of the notification in the
present proceedings and we deem it appropriate to reject the said contention.
35. The said contention is also canvassed by the learned Senior counsel appearing on behalf of the
second respondent. He would attempt to canvass a similar case and would contend that the order
dated 12.1.2022 ratifies the earlier order dated 27.3.2021 appointing the second respondent to the
post held by the petitioner. In this regard both the learned AAG and the learned senior counsel
appearing on behalf of the second respondent would place reliance on the ruling reported in 2015
(11) SCC 669 and in particular would take the court through paragraphs 28, 29, 30 to 32 to contend
that it is permissible to ratify and set right any lacuna in the appointment/transfer of the second
respondent to the post of Director. In the said ruling the Hon'ble Apex Court was examining the law
relating to ratification. The observations of the Apex Court in paragraphs 28 to 32 are as under:
"28. That apart, the issue in question could be examined from yet another angle by
applying the law relating to "ratification" which was not taken note of by the High
Court.
29. The expression "ratification" means "the making valid of an act already done".
This principle is derived from the Latin maxim "ratihabitio mandato aequiparatur"
meaning thereby "a subsequent ratification of an act is equivalent to a prior authority
to perform such act". It is for this reason, the ratification assumes an invalid act
which is retrospectively validated.
30. The expression "ratification" was succinctly defined by the English Court in one
old case, Hartman v. Hornsby as under:
" 'Ratification' is the approval by act, word, or conduct, of that which was attempted
(of accomplishment), but which was improperly or unauthorisedly performed in the
first instance."
31. The law of ratification was applied by this Court in Parmeshwari Prasad Gupta v. Union of India.
In that case, the Chairman of the Board of Directors had terminated the services of the General
Manager of a Company pursuant to a resolution taken by the Board at a meeting. It was not in
dispute that the meeting had been improperly held and consequently the resolution passed in the
said meeting terminating the services of the General Manager was invalid. However, the Board of
Directors then convened subsequent meeting and in this meeting affirmed the earlier resolution,
which had been passed in improper meeting. On these facts, the Court held: (SCC pp. 546-47, para
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130365118/ 13
Mahiboob Sab vs The State Of Karnataka on 31 May, 2022
14) "14. ... Even if it be assumed that the telegram and the letter terminating the services of the
appellant by the Chairman was in pursuance of the invalid resolution of the Board of Directors
passed on 16-12-1953 to terminate his services, it would not follow that the action of the Chairman
could not be ratified in a regularly convened meeting of the Board of Directors. The point is that
even assuming that the Chairman was not legally authorised to terminate the services of the
appellant, he was acting on behalf of the Company in doing so, because, he purported to act in
pursuance of the invalid resolution. Therefore, it was open to a regularly constituted meeting of the
Board of Directors to ratify that action which, though unauthorised, was done on behalf of the
Company. Ratification would always relate back to the date of the act ratified and so it must be held
that the services of the appellant were validly terminated on 17-12-1953."
This view was approved by this Court in High Court of Judicature of Rajasthan v. P.P. Singh.
32. The aforesaid principle of law of ratification was again applied by this Court in Maharashtra
State Mining Corpn. v. Sunil. In this case, the respondent was an employee of the appellant
Corporation. Consequent to a departmental enquiry, he was dismissed by the Managing Director of
the appellant. The respondent then filed a writ petition before the High Court. During the pendency
of the writ petition, the Board of Directors of the appellant Corporation passed a resolution ratifying
the impugned action of the Managing Director and also empowering him to take decision in respect
of the officers and staff in the grade of pay the maximum of which did not exceed Rs 4700 p.m.
Earlier, the Managing Director had powers only in respect of those posts where the maximum pay
did not exceed Rs 1900 p.m. The respondent at the relevant time was drawing more than Rs 1800
p.m. Therefore, at the relevant time, the Managing Director was incompetent to dismiss the
respondent. Accordingly, the High Court held the order of dismissal to be invalid. The High Court
further held that the said defect could not be rectified subsequently by the resolution of the Board of
Directors. The High Court set aside the dismissal order and granted consequential relief. The
appellant then filed the appeal in this Court by special leave. Ruma Pal, J. speaking for the
three-Judge Bench, while allowing the appeal and setting aside the order of the High Court held as
under: (Sunil case SCC pp. 96g-h & 97a-b) "The High Court rightly held that an act by a legally
incompetent authority is invalid. But it was entirely wrong in holding that such an invalid act could
not be subsequently 'rectified' by ratification of the competent authority. Ratification by definition
means the making valid of an act already done. The principle is derived from the Latin maxim
ratihabitio mandato aequiparatur, namely, 'a subsequent ratification of an act is equivalent to a
prior authority to perform such act'.
Therefore, ratification assumes an invalid act which is retrospectively validated.
*** In the present case, the Managing Director's order dismissing the respondent from the service
was admittedly ratified by the Board of Directors unquestionably had the power to terminate the
services of the respondent. Since the order of the Managing Director had been ratified by the Board
of Directors such ratification related back to the date of the order and validated it."
36. From a reading of the above and the facts involved in the said case it is apparent that the Apex
Court was not dealing with the issue of eligibility and the Apex Court in the facts and circumstances
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130365118/ 14
Mahiboob Sab vs The State Of Karnataka on 31 May, 2022
involved therein was pleased to hold that the power of ratification was vested in the authority,
namely the Board and hence held that the subsequent ratification by the competent authority of the
initial orders was legal. We have no quarrel with the observations of the law laid down by the Apex
Court. Another ruling is also placed before us by the learned AAG reported in 2003 (4) SCC 239. The
three Judges bench of the Apex Court was yet again dealing with the case of ratifying actions
pursuant to delegated administrative powers and not the question of eligibility which is the issue
involved herein.
37. The bogey of eligibility was raised by the second respondent and on scrutiny we find that even
the second respondent does not possess the eligibility to be appointed as there is no proceeding
whereby the merits of the case of the second respondent interse other officers of the KAS cadre have
been assessed by the department and he has been found fit to be promoted to the next post of
selection grade. In fact the hierarchy in the KAS cadre would indicate there was one more
intermediate scale i.e., of KAS senior scale as is found in the book published by the department of
parliament, DPAR, a wing of the first respondent.
38. Per contra, the learned senior counsel for the petitioner would place reliance on the ruling of the
Apex Court reported in 2021 SCC online SC 1284 in the case of Sunny Abraham vs. Union of India
and another and another and would place reliance on the observations of the Apex Court in
paragraph 13 as follows:
"13. The next question we shall address is as to whether there would be any difference
in the position of law in this case vis-a-vis the case of B.V. Gopinath (supra). In the
latter authority, the charge memorandum without approval of the Disciplinary
Authority was held to be non est in a concluded proceeding. The High Court has
referred to the variants of the expression non est used in two legal phrases in the
judgment under appeal. In the context of our jurisprudence, the term non est conveys
the meaning of something treated to be not in existence because of some legal lacuna
in the process of creation of the subject-instrument. It goes beyond a remediable
irregularity. That is how the Coordinate Bench has construed the impact of not
having approval of the Disciplinary Authority in issuing the charge memorandum. In
the event a legal instrument is deemed to be not in existence, because of certain
fundamental defect in its issuance, subsequent approval cannot revive its existence
and ratify acts done in pursuance of such instrument, treating the same to be valid.
The fact that initiation of proceeding received approval of the Disciplinary Authority
could not lighten the obligation on the part of the employer (in this case the Union of
India) in complying with the requirement of sub-
clause (3) of Rule 14 of CCS (CCA), 1965. We have quoted the two relevant sub-clauses earlier in this
judgment. Sub-clauses (2) and (3) of Rule 14 contemplates independent approval of the Disciplinary
Authority at both stages - for initiation of enquiry and also for drawing up or to cause to be drawn
up the charge memorandum. In the event the requirement of sub-clause (2) is complied with, not
having the approval at the time of issue of charge memorandum under sub-clause (3) would render
the charge memorandum fundamentally defective, not capable of being validated retrospectively.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130365118/ 15
Mahiboob Sab vs The State Of Karnataka on 31 May, 2022
What is non-existent in the eye of the law cannot be revived retrospectively. Life cannot be breathed
into the stillborn charge memorandum. In our opinion, the approval for initiating disciplinary
proceeding and approval to a charge memorandum are two divisible acts, each one requiring
independent application of mind on the part of the Disciplinary Authority. If there is any default in
the process of application of mind independently at the time of issue of charge memorandum by the
Disciplinary Authority, the same would not get cured by the fact that such approval was there at the
initial stage. This was the argument on behalf of the authorities in the case of B.V. Gopinath (supra),
as would be evident from paragraph 8 of the report which we reproduce below:--
"8. Ms. Jaising has elaborately explained the entire procedure that is followed in each
and every case before the matter is put up before the Finance Minister for seeking
approval for initiation of the disciplinary proceedings. According to the learned
Additional Solicitor General, the procedure followed ensures that entire material is
placed before the Finance Minister before a decision is taken to initiate the
departmental proceedings. She submits that approval for initiation of the
departmental proceedings would also amount to approval of the charge memo.
According to the learned Additional Solicitor General, CAT as well as the High Court
had committed a grave error in quashing the departmental proceedings against the
respondents, as the procedure for taking approval of the disciplinary authority to
initiate penalty proceeding is comprehensive and involved decision making at every
level of the hierarchy.""
39. The learned Senior counsel would press the above argument to contend that the eligibility being
a threshold bar cannot be rectified by a subsequent rectification and the initial order of appointment
being vitiated on account of the ineligibility of the second respondent to hold the post the same
could not have been rectified by the subsequent proceedings dated 12.1.2022. He would submit that
the very notification dated 12.01.2022 absolutely demonstrates that the respondents were well
aware that the second respondent was ineligible to hold the post even as on the date of the
impugned order dated 27.3.2021 and hence he would submit that malafides has to be inferred
against the first respondent and the impugned order amounts to a colourable exercise of jurisdiction
and would pray that the writ petition be allowed and the impugned order dated 27.3.2021 be set
aside.
40. The learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the second respondent would press into
service two rulings of the Apex Court reported in 2014 (15) SCC 466 and would place reliance on the
observations of the Apex Court in paragraphs 6 to 13 to contend that the question of eligibility
cannot be gone into as there is no specific challenge to the eligibility of the second respondent to
hold the post. In our opinion the said contention is fallacious for the very proceedings impugned
before the Tribunal and this Court is the order dated 27.3.2021 whereby the petitioner stood
deprived of his right to hold the post and a similar right to hold the post was conferred on the
second respondent. Another ruling of the Apex Court the learned senior counsel would place
reliance which is reported in 2013 (4) SCC 465 would place reliance on the observation of the apex
court in paragraphs 9 to 17. In our opinion the said ruling is of no avail to the petitioner and is
distinguishable on the facts of the instant case. Paragraphs 9 to 11 are extracted herein below for the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130365118/ 16
Mahiboob Sab vs The State Of Karnataka on 31 May, 2022
sake of convenience.
"9. It is a settled legal proposition that a stranger cannot be permitted to meddle in
any proceeding, unless he satisfies the authority/court, that he falls within the
category of aggrieved persons. Only a person who has suffered, or suffers from legal
injury can challenge the act/action/order, etc. in a court of law. A writ petition under
Article 226 of the Constitution is maintainable either for the purpose of enforcing a
statutory or legal right, or when there is a complaint by the appellant that there has
been a breach of statutory duty on the part of the authorities. Therefore, there must
be a judicially enforceable right available for enforcement, on the basis of which writ
jurisdiction is resorted to. The Court can, of course, enforce the performance of a
statutory duty by a public body, using its writ jurisdiction at the behest of a person,
provided that such person satisfies the Court that he has a legal right to insist on such
performance. The existence of such right is a condition precedent for invoking the
writ jurisdiction of the courts. It is implicit in the exercise of such extraordinary
jurisdiction that the relief prayed for must be one to enforce a legal right. In fact, the
existence of such right, is the foundation of the exercise of the said jurisdiction by the
Court. The legal right that can be enforced must ordinarily be the right of the
appellant himself, who complains of infraction of such right and approaches the
Court for relief as regards the same. [Vide State of Orissa v. Madan Gopal Rungta,
Saghir Ahmad v. State of U.P., Calcutta Gas Co. (Proprietary) Ltd. v. State of W.B.,
Rajendra Singh v. State of M.P. and Tamilnad Mercantile Bank Shareholders Welfare
Assn. (2) v. S.C. Sekar .]
10. A "legal right", means an entitlement arising out of legal rules. Thus, it may be defined as an
advantage, or a benefit conferred upon a person by the rule of law. The expression, "person
aggrieved" does not include a person who suffers from a psychological or an imaginary injury; a
person aggrieved must, therefore, necessarily be one whose right or interest has been adversely
affected or jeopardised. (Vide Shanti Kumar R. Canji v. Home Insurance Co. of New York and State
of Rajasthan v. Union of India.)
11. In Anand Sharadchandra Oka v. University of Mumbai, a similar view was taken by this Court,
observing that, if a person claiming relief is not eligible as per requirement, then he cannot be said
to be a person aggrieved regarding the election or the selection of other persons."
41. As noticed by us in the earlier part of this order, the impugned order was contrary and in the
teeth of law settled by this court in Hittalmani's case. That (1) it was premature as the petitioner had
not completed the minimum fixed tenure; (2) there was no simultaneous movement order moving
the petitioner out of the post while transferring and appointing the second respondent to the post
occupied by the petitioner and (3) the order appointing/transferring the second respondent to the
post held by the petitioner was not preceded by any order of removing the petitioner from the post
of Director on the ground of his ineligibility to hold the post. In that view of the matter, in the
absence of an order of removal, the case of the petitioner was squarely covered by the law laid down
by this Court in Hittalmani's case and which has been relied upon by the petitioner, both before the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130365118/ 17
Mahiboob Sab vs The State Of Karnataka on 31 May, 2022
Tribunal and this Court.
42. We refrain from interfering with the proceeding transferring the petitioner out of the post in
view of the C and R Rules of Karnataka Minorities Department (published on 15.3.2011).
Consequently, we reject the writ petition in so far as it seeks to restore the petitioner to post.
43. We partly allow the writ petition. We hold that the second respondent is ineligible to be
transferred and appointed as Director, Minorities Welfare Department, in terms of the very same
cadre and recruitment rules, as no document has been placed before this Court to demonstrate that
any promotion either regular or deemed has been conferred on the second respondent in a manner
known to law as on the date of the impugned order i.e., 23.07.2021.
44. We also hold that the proceedings dated 12.01.2022 is an act of overreach and we direct that
second respondent be forthwith removed from the post of Director, Department of Minorities and
compliance of this order shall be reported to this Court expeditiously.
The writ petition is ordered accordingly.
