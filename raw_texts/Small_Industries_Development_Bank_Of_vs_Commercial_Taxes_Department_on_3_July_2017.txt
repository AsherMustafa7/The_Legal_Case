controversy involved in the present cases, the writ
petitions were analogously heard and by a common order,
they are being disposed of by this Court. Facts of Writ
Petition No. 4441/2015 are narrated hereunder.
The present Writ Petition is of the year 2015 and
inspite of 10 opportunities, no reply has been filed by the
State Government and, therefore, the matter is being
disposed of in the light of the judgment delivered by this
Court in an identical case.
The present Writ Petition has been filed challenging
the auction notice dated 27/6/2015 and as per the relief
clause it has been stated that respondent No.2

learned counsel for the petitioner, at the outset, has argued before this Court that on account of
amendment dated 16/8/2016 the Bank is having first charge over the property and not the State
Government.
