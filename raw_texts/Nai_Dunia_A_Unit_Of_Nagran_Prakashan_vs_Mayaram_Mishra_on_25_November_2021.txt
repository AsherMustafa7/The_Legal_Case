Nai Dunia (A Unit Of Nagran Prakashan ... vs Mayaram Mishra on 25 November, 2021
Heard on admission and interlocutory application vide I.A.13214/2021.
1. Regard being had to the similitude of the facts and arising out of THE HIGH COURT OF
MADHYA PRADESH the awards dated 08/19-08-2019 passed by the Labour Court No.1, Gwalior,
common order is being passed and for convenience's sake, facts of Miscellaneous Petition
No.3307/2021 have been taken for consideration.
2. The instant miscellaneous petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India has been
preferred at the instance of petitioners/employer being crestfallen by award dated 08-08- 2019
passed by Presiding Officer, Labour Court No.1, Gwalior (vide Annexure P/1) whereby reference
under Section 17(2) of The Working Journalists and Other News Paper Employees (Conditions of
Service) and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1955 (hereinafter referred to as "the Act, 1955") has been
decided and amount of Rs.27,54,022/- has been awarded to the employee (awarded amount differs
in each case) with the direction to the employer to pay the same within one month along with
Rs.2,000/- as litigation expenses.
3. Precisely stated facts of the case are that respondent/News Paper Employee filed an application
claiming the benefit of Majithia Wage Board (hereinafter referred to as "the Wage Board") before
the Deputy Labour Commissioner. Employer was put to notice in which claim was resisted by
employer on various grounds. The Deputy Labour Commissioner apprised the State Government
about the dispute and in turn the Government sent THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
the reference for adjudication before the labour Court. The legality, validity and propriety of the
reference made to the labour Court by the State Government under Section 17(2) of the Act, 1955
was put to challenge by the petitioners (in some other identical cases) before High Court of Madhya
Pradesh, Bench at Indore by way of Writ Petition No.16209/2018, 16178/2018, 16185/2018,
16198/2018 (Nai Dunia Vs. State of M.P. and others) and the Coordinate Bench vide order dated 25-
07-2018 decided the case in which reference made was found to be valid and writ petitions were
dismissed. In line of the said order, bunch of writ petitions; which were pending before this Court
(Gwalior Bench) also got disposed of vide order dated 13- 12-2018 in the light of order dated
25-07-2018 as referred above.
4. It further appears that taking exception to the order passed by learned Single Judge, certain writ
appeals were filed and Division Bench by way of bunch of Writ Appeals (vide No.1858/2018 and
other appeals) vide order dated 09-05-2019 decided the said bunch in which order of learned Single
Judge was affirmed and no fault was found in the order of reference passed by the State
Government.
5. It further appears from the submissions and pleadings that both the parties appeared before the
labour Court and labour Court THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH after considering the
pleadings/evidence led/submissions advanced, passed the impugned awards dated 08-08-2019
which are being challenged by petitioners under Article 227 of the Constitution.
6. It further appears that meanwhile employees of petitioners filed Revenue Recovery Certificate
(RRC) proceedings, pursuant to the awards dated 08/19-08-2019 and they were pending execution
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/15246844/ 2
Nai Dunia (A Unit Of Nagran Prakashan ... vs Mayaram Mishra on 25 November, 2021
before the concerned authority, therefore, employees preferred petitions for execution of award in
which Division Bench of this Court in writ petition No.16060/2021 passed certain directions
including the order dated 04-10-2021 wherein Court granted further time till 31st December, 2021
to the concerned authority to execute the RRC and ensure the benefits flowing out of the award and
matter is directed to be taken up in second week of January, 2022 for compliance.
7. With this factual backdrop, it is the submission of learned senior counsel appearing for petitioners
that the application preferred by respondent was purportedly under Section 17(1) of the Act, 1955
and therefore, Deputy Labour Commissioner/State Government erred in making reference to labour
Court under Section 17(2) of the Act, 1955. Learned senior counsel appearing for petitioners laid
much emphasis on the point of delay and laches as according to him, Wage Board gave its THE
HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH recommendations in 2011 and Hon'ble Supreme Court
upheld the recommendations of the Wage Board way back in 2014, therefore, reference made
thereafter in 2017 suffers from delay and laches.
8. It is further submitted that when the employees adopted the mode as per clause 20(j) of the Wage
Board recommendations about acceptance of existing pay scale and emoluments then they waived
their rights as per doctrine of Waiver to reagitate the issue. He relied upon judgment of Apex Court
in the matter of Avishek Raja and others Vs. Sanjay Gupta, (2017) 8 SCC
435. Since no doubt regarding amount due exist, therefore, ignoring this aspect labour Court caused
illegality and perversity.
9. No other arguments were advanced and learned senior counsel fairly submits that he reserves his
arguments further for final hearing.
10. Respondent caused his appearance and filed reply in which he contested the case with equal
vehemence. At the outset, learned senior counsel appearing for respondent referred the scope of
Article 227 of Constitution and while relying upon different pronouncements made by Hon'ble Apex
Court from time to time stressed upon the limited scope of jurisdiction under Article 227 of
Constitution. He relied upon the judgments of Hon'ble Apex THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA
PRADESH Court in the matter of Harjinder Singh Vs. Punjab State Warehousing Corporation,
(2010) 3 SCC 192, Iswarlal Mohanlal Thakkar Vs. Paschim Gujarat Vij Company Limited and
another, (2014) 6 SCC 434 and ABP Private Limited and another Vs. Union of India and others,
(2014) 3 SCC 327. He stressed over the submission that scope of jurisdiction of High Court vis-a-vis
findings of labour Court/Tribunal is limited. Court below after due consideration and evidence led
by the parties came to a conclusion which is just and proper, needs no interference.
11. Through various provisions of the Act, 1955, learned senior counsel placed reliance upon Section
13 of the Act, 1955 to submit that statute gives entitlement to the employee to wages at rates not less
than those specified in the order of Central Government under Section 12.
12. It is submitted that once the scope of reference and its validity has already been decided and
when execution is going on against employer, then petition itself suffers from delay and laches and

Nai Dunia (A Unit Of Nagran Prakashan ... vs Mayaram Mishra on 25 November, 2021
deserves dismissal.
13. Heard the rival contentions and perused the documents appended thereto.
14. It is a case where respondent/employee is seeking the benefits of recommendations of Majithia
Wage Board. So far as scope and THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH validity of reference
is concerned, Coordinate Bench and Division Bench of this Court has gone into detail and thereafter
found the reference to be valid and proper. From the pleadings and submissions, it appear that no
challenge to the said order has been made and therefore, order dated 09-05-2019 passed by Division
Bench attained finality. Once the reference found to be valid then prima facie for deciding the
instant interim application, maintainability of reference to labour Court cannot be looked into.
15. Plea as raised by petitioners regarding delay and laches in making reference is concerned, in
absence of any limitation prescribed as well as the fact that after matter being settled by Hon'ble
Apex Court in 2017 employees which were engaged in procedure for getting the fruits of award then
it was the recurring cause of action and even no delay and laches appear to be existing prima facie in
the case.
16. The aspect of waiver has been discussed in detail by learned Court below and while appreciating
the evidence found prima facie that document of consent was prima facie doubtful and it cannot be
construed as consent. It is to be seen in the light of judgments passed by Hon'ble Apex Court in the
case of Central Inland Water Transport Corporation Limited and Anr. Vs. Brojo Nath Ganguly and
Ors., (1986) 3 SCC 156 and THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH Assistant General
Manager and others Vs. Radhey Shyam Pandey, (2020) 6 SCC 438. In fact Court below referred the
fact regarding one missing page also which could have material bearing. Beside that, execution
proceedings are already going on in which petitioners are expected to comply the spirit of award.
15. Therefore, confining the discussion to the extent of arriving to a prima facie conclusion of
interim relief, this Court does not find the case for interim relief. Therefore, I.A.No.13214/2021
stands rejected. Petitioners shall have to disburse the awarded sum or alternatively deposit awarded
sum before the labour Court in a Fixed Deposit Receipt of a Nationalized Bank, fetching regular
interest on or before 31st December, 2021.
16. Looking to the nature of controversy, matter deserves to be heard at an early date. Since
respondent caused his appearance, therefore, no fresh notice is required to be made. Parties are
expected to complete the pleadings, if any, within six weeks.
17. List the matter in first week of February, 2022 for further orders.
