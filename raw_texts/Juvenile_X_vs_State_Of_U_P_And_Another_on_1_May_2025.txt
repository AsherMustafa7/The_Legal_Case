Juvenile X vs State Of U.P. And Another on 1 May, 2025
3-As per the prosecution case in brief, a first information report was lodged 05.04.2024 with regard
to an incident dated 04.04.2024 against four accused persons including the revisionist for the
offence under Section 302 I.P.C., in which Ram Saran has lost his life.
4-Learned counsel for the revisionist assailing the impugned orders submits that the revisionist was
a juvenile on the date of the alleged incident dated 04.04.2024 and he has been declared juvenile
vide order dated 28.10.2024 of Juvenile Justice Board treating the age of revisionist as 16 years 02
months and 12 days on the date of alleged incident. The revisionist has remained confined in
juvenile home since 12.04.2024.
5-Main substratum of argument of learned counsel for the revisionist is that the revisionist is not
named in the F.I.R. During investigation, complicity of the revisionist came into light that he was
also involved in the conspiracy of the said incident. It is also submitted that co-accused Rahul, who
was also not named in the F.I.R., has been granted bail by the co-ordinate Bench of this Court vide
order dated 10.09.2024 passed in Criminal Misc. Bail Application No. 33492 of 2024, hence, the
bail application of the revisionist is also liable to be allowed on the ground of parity.
6-It is further being emphasized that the revisionist does not have any criminal antecedent to his
credit. Lastly, it is submitted that there is no material on record for believing that the release of
revisionist is likely to bring him into association with any known criminal or expose him to moral,
psychological danger, therefore, aforesaid impugned orders are not sustainable and liable to be set
aside and revisionist is entitled to be released on bail in view of Section 12 of Juvenile Justice (Care
and Protection of Child) Act, 2015.
7-Learned Additional Government Advocate vehemently opposed the present revision. It has thus
been submitted, merely because the revisionist is a juvenile it would not entitle him to bail without
going into the gravity of the offence, the nature of the crime. It is also contended that the bail sought
for has been rightly refused in view of Section 12(1) of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of
Child) Act, 2015.
8-Having considered the arguments so advanced by learned counsel for the parties, I find that
co-accused Rahul, under similar accusation, has been granted bail as noted above.
9-The Court has to see whether the opinion of the learned appellate Court as well as Juvenile Justice
Board recorded in the impugned judgment and orders are in consonance with the provision of
Section 12 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015. Section 12 of the
aforesaid Act lays down three contingencies in which bail could be refused to juvenile. They are:-
(i) if the release is likely to bring him into association with any known criminal, or
(ii) expose him to moral, physical or psychological danger, or
(iii) that his release would defeat the ends of justice.

10-Considering the facts of the case as noted above, it appears that the findings recorded by the
learned Court below are erroneous and cannot be sustained. The aforesaid impugned order dated
21.01.2025 is hereby set aside.
11-Accordingly, the present criminal revision is allowed.
12-Let the revisionist Juvenile X involved in the aforesaid case crime be released on bail on
furnishing a personal bond of his mother namely Smt. Malti Devi who is his natural guardian with
two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned with the following
conditions:-
(i) The revisionist shall not tamper with the evidence or threaten the witnesses;
(ii) The revisionist through guardian shall file an undertaking to the effect that he
shall not seek any adjournment on the date fixed for evidence when the witnesses are
present in court. In case of default of this condition, it shall be open for the trial Court
to treat it as abuse of liberty of bail and pass orders in accordance with law;
(iii) The revisionist through guardian shall remain present before the trial Court on
each date fixed, either personally or through his counsel.
