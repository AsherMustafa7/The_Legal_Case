(BRIJESH @ GAJA Vs STATE OF M.P.)
31
Gwalior, Dated : 22-11-2019
Shri D.S.Kushwah, Advocate for the appellant.
Shri M.S.Rawat, Public Prosecutor for the respondent/State.
Heard on I.A. No.6559/19, repeat application for suspension of sentence and grant of bail to
appellant Brijesh alias Gaja. The first one (I.A. No.180/19) was dismissed as withdrawn vide order
dated 29/3/19.
This criminal appeal assails the judgment dated 20th July, 2013 passed i n Special Session Trial
No.08/2013, by Special Judge (under the M.P. Daikaiti Aur Vypharan Prabhavit Kshetra Adhiniyam
(for short "the Adhiniyam")), Datia, whereby the present appellant stands convicted under section
395 of the IPC read with 13 of the Adhiniyam and to undergo imprisonment for life with fine of
Rs.10,000/- in default to suffer imprisonment for two years and also under section 376(D) of the
IPC to undergo imprisonment for life with fine of Rs.10,000/- in default to suffer imprisonment for
two years, with the direction that the custodial sentences shall run concurrently.
Prosecution story, as found proved, is that on 15/2/2013 appellant along with other five co-convicts
not only robbed the prosecutrix and her husband Jost Xaver Bussman, Swiss Nationals who had
come to India for a tour on bicycle and on the fateful night were camping in a forest near Village
Jharia, district Datia, of cash amount of Rs.10,000/- and other valuables such as Laptop, Battery
Pack, Cellphone, mobile, earphone etc., but also subjected the prosecutrix to rape one after the other
and beat her husband with wooden stick.
Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the trial Court has completely mis-appreciated the
evidence on record. The FIR was lodged against 5 to 7 unknown persons and the prosecutrix
(PW28) has herself 2 CRA-832-2013 stated in her evidence that she could not see the miscreants
due to darkness and dazzling of torch light. There is no evidence on record to identify the present
appellant or to connect him with the crime. Recovery of articles from different places in the forest at
different times, is doubtful.
The prayer is opposed by the learned Public Prosecutor. It is submitted that the Laptop has been
recovered at the instance of present appellant, which has been identified by Jost Xaver Bussman.
DNA test report of the appellant has matched with that of prosecutrix (PW28) and in the DNA test

report (Ex.P/55), appellant's fluid has been found on the clothes, pubic hair, vaginal smear and
swab of the prosecutrix. Besides, the prosecution version is corroborated by medical evidence,
inasmuch as injuries have been noticed in the MLC of the prosecutrix and her husband. In such
circumstances, no indulgence is warranted.
Taking into consideration the overall facts and circumstances of the case, in the opinion of this
Court, no case for suspension of sentence is made out.
The I.A., accordingly, stands dismissed.
