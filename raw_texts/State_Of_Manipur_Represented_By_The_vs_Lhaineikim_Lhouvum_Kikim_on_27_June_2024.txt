JUDGMENT & ORDER
[1] Heard Mr. Lenin Hijam, learned Advocate General
appearing through VC assisted by Mr. Dimal Kumar, learned counsel for
the petitioner and Mr. Colin Gonsalves, learned senior counsel appearing
through VC assisted by Osbert Khaling, learned counsel for the
respondent.
[2] The present petitions have been filed under Section 439(2)
of the Criminal Procedure Code read with Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. with
the following prayer:
"(i) to call for records of in (a) Cril. Misc. (B) Case No. 3
of 2003 and (b) Cril. Misc. (B) Case No. 45 of 2023;
(ii) to quash and set aside the common order dated
28.03.2023 passed by the Ld. Single Judge (NIA),
Imphal West, Manipur in (i) Cril. Misc. (B) Case No. 3
of 2023 and (ii) Cril. Misc. (B) Case No. 45 of 2023;
(iii) to pass any appropriate order or orders or directions
which the Hon'ble Court may deem fit, proper and
just in the present nature of the case."
[3] The grounds for filing the instant petitions are extracted as
under:
(a) There is no legal bar or impediment in filing the
present Cril. Petition under Section 439(2) of the Cr.P.C.
1973 as the applications being Cril. Misc. Case No. 42 of
2023 (Ref.: Cril. Misc. (B) No. 45 of 2023) and Cril. Misc.
Case No. 43 of 2023 (Ref.: Cril. Misc. (B) No. 3 of 2023)
Page 2 of 23
filed under Section 439(2) Cr.P.C. before the Special Judge
(NIA), Imphal for setting aside/modifying the said order
dated 28.03.2023 was held not maintainable as barred by
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/94237945/ 2
State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Lhaineikim Lhouvum@ Kikim on 27 June, 2024
the principles embodied in Section 362 Cr.P.C. In other
words, Cril. Misc. Case No. 42 of 2023 and Cril. Misc. Case
No. 43 of 2023 was decided as not maintainable under
technical ground and not decided on merit.
(b) In passing the said common order dated 28.03.2023
in Cril. Misc. (B) Case No. 3 of 2023 and Cril. Misc. (B) Case
No. 45 of 2023, the Hon'ble Court of Special Judge (NIA),
Imphal West might not have fully examined and considered
the judgment and order dated 02.11.2022 passed by
Hon'ble High Court of Manipur in Bail Application No. 11 of
2022 concerning the same FIR case. In other words, the
common bail order dated 28.03.2023 has over ruled the
Hon'ble Court's order dated 02.11.2022 passed in Bail
Application No. 11 of 2022.
(c) The Ld. Special Judge (NIA), Imphal passed the
impugned common order dated 28.03.2023 only on the
following finding which is against the relevant provisions of
law as well as against the provisions of UA(P) Act:
"12. Thus, relying on the decision of the Hon'ble
Gauhati High Court, I hereby hold that the first Charge-
sheet was an incomplete charge-sheet and as the
accused has been in custody for more than the statutory
period, the accused is entitled to default bail.
Further, the stage in the main case is coming for
charge-consideration. By the submission of the
supplementary charge-sheet, it may also be said that the
investigation of the case is completed and in such a
situation, further custody of the accused would not be
necessary. Like the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that "An
accused person who enjoys freedom is in a much better
Page 3 of 23
position to look after his case and to properly defend
himself than if he were is custody", it would be just and
fair to let the accused be on bail so as to defend himself
properly."
(d) The Hon'ble Court of Special Judge (NIA), Imphal
West, Manipur failed to appreciate that FIR cases
registered against the accused person involved Section 17
& 18 of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, 1967, and
the expressed provision of law under Section 43(D).
(e) The Hon'ble Court of Special Judge (NIA), Imphal
West, Manipur failed to appreciate that FIR cases
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/94237945/ 3
State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Lhaineikim Lhouvum@ Kikim on 27 June, 2024
registered against the accused person involved Section 17
& 18 of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, 1967
wherein the granting of bail is very strict in view of the
judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India passed in
various cases. The relevant portions of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court's judgment passed in NIA v. Zahoor Shah
Watali (2009) 5 SCC 1 are at paragraphs No. 22 to 27.
[4] The respondent's husband namely, Mark T. Haokip was
arrested on 30.05.2022 at 06:40 p.m. in connection with FIR No.
129(5)2022 IPS u/s 120-B/121-A/123/400 IPC & 17 & 18 UA(P) Act and
he was remanded into judicial custody on 09.06.2022. The accused
applied for bail however, the bail application was rejected vide order
dated 21.06.2022 passed in Cril. Misc. (B) Case No. 60 of 2022, for
which, the accused approached this High Court and the same was also
rejected vide order dated 02.11.2022 passed in Bail Appln. No. 11 of
2022.
Page 4 of 23
[5] Further, the accused filed another bail application being
Cril. Misc. (B) No. 3 of 2023 on 17.01.2023. In the meantime, charge-
sheet was submitted under Section 120-B/121/121-A/123/400/511 IPC &
Section 17 & 18 UA(P) Act on 25.11.2022 with a rider that
supplementary charge-sheet will be submitted at the earliest after
prosecution sanctions, due documents and evidences were received from
the competent authorities and the case was registered as Special Trial
Case No. 10 of 2022.
Again, the accused filed another bail application under
Section 167 (2) Cr.P.C. read with Section 45 UAPA & Rule 3 & 4 of UAP
Rules which was registered as Cril. Misc. (B) Case No. 45 of 2023. On the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/94237945/ 4
State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Lhaineikim Lhouvum@ Kikim on 27 June, 2024
same day, the supplementary charge-sheet was also filed.
[6] Vide common order dated 28.03.2023 passed in Cril. Misc.
(B) Case No. 3 of 2023 and Cril. Misc. (B) Case No. 45 of 2023, the Ld.
Special Judge (NIA), Imphal West released the accused on bail. The
operative portions of the order dated 28.03.2023 impugned herein are
extracted as under:
"13. Considering all these aspect, I am of the opinion that bail
may be granted to the accused. In the result, the accused
namely Mark Thangmang Haokip @ Mark T. Haokip, aged about
38 years, resident of Molnom Village, P.O. & P.S. Churachandpur,
Churachandpur District, Manipur is allowed to go bail on his
furnishing a P.R. Bond of Rs. 2,00,000/- (Rupees two lakh only)
with the two sureties (Gazetted Officer) of the like amount and
on the conditions that :
(a) The accused Mark Thangmang Haokip @ Mark T.
Haokip shall not abscond but present himself before
this Court on every date(s) fixed.
Page 5 of 23
(b) The accused shall not influence prosecution
witness(es) so as to dissuade the witness(es) from
disclosing facts before the Court.
(c) The accused shall not leave the State of Manipur
without prior permission of the Court; and
(d)The accused shall not commit similar offence while on
bail.
14. Prayer of the petitioner is allowed and the two bail cases
are disposed of.
15. Place a copy of this order in both the cases."
[7] However, on 29.03.2023, the Ld. Special Judge (NIA),
Imphal West was pleased to pass an order to the effect that the said
common order dated 28.03.2023 impugned herein is kept in abeyance
until further order.
[8] The State of Manipur, against the impugned order dated
28.03.2023 passed by the Ld. Special Judge (NIA), Imphal West,
preferred Cril. Revision Petition being No. 7 of 2023 before this High
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/94237945/ 5
State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Lhaineikim Lhouvum@ Kikim on 27 June, 2024
Court and the same was disposed of vide order dated 22.12.2023 with
the following observation and direction:
"A perusal of Annexure R/2 reflects that vide order dated
29.03.2023, on an application under the provision of Section
439(2) Cr.P.C, filed by Joint Secretary (Home), Government of
Manipur, praying for cancelling the bail granted to the accused
Mark Thangmang Haokip @ Mark T. Haokip, vide order dated
28.03.2023, the learned Special Judge while issuing notice in the
application, kept in abeyance until further order the operation of
the common impugned order dated 28.03.2023.
In view of the foregoing, after hearing learned Advocate
General appearing on behalf of the State of Manipur, the only
course of action that commend itself is to direct the Special
Judge (NIA), Imphal West, Manipur, to hear and determine the
said application under Section 439(2) of Cr.P.C. filed on behalf of
the Joint Secretary, seeking cancellation of the bail expeditiously
and preferably within a period of 6(six) weeks from today. The
matter is accordingly remitted back to the Special Judge (NIA),
Imphal West, Manipur, to be listed for hearing on 17.01.2024.
Page 6 of 23
No further relief is prayed for in the present cril. revision
petition.
The present criminal revision petition is disposed of
accordingly.
Registry is directed to send a copy to all the learned
counsel appearing on behalf of the parties as well as to the Court
of Special Judge (NIA), Imphal West, Manipur, for information
and compliance."
[9] Further, the wife of the accused person (respondent in the
present case) filed Cril. Misc. Case No. 61 of 2023 under Section 362 of
Cr.P.C., 1973 with the prayer for dismissing Cril. Misc. Case No. 42 of
2023 and Cril. Misc. Case No. 43 of 2023 U/S 362 of Cr.P.C. as it is not
maintainable. The said Cril. Misc. Case No. 61 of 2023 was disposed of
by the Ld. Special Judge (NIA), Imphal West and the same is reproduced
herein below:
"16. It may be mentioned that the reply affidavit on behalf of
the State of Manipur, referring to order dated 16.10.2023 of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court passed in Criminal Appeal No. 704 of
2024, has also sated at para No. 8 that offences charged
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/94237945/ 6
State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Lhaineikim Lhouvum@ Kikim on 27 June, 2024
against the accused person include provisions under UA(P) Act
which is a Special Act and the prayer made in the Cril. Misc.
Cases 42 and 43 of 2023 is to set aside/modify the common
bail order dt. 28.03.2023. However, this argument is of no
relevance to the question of maintainability of this Cril. Misc.
Cases.
17. Allowing the Cril. Misc. Cases would amount to this Court
reviewing its own order based on the same facts and
circumstances as they stood at the time the bail order dt.
28.03.2023 was passed. This Court, therefore, is of the opinion
that the applications filed under S. 439 (2) Cr.P.C. for setting
aside / modifying the said order dt.28.03.2023 are not
maintainable as barred by the principles embodied in S. 362
Cr.P.C.
This misc. case is allowed accordingly."
Page 7 of 23
[10] The learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent
Mr. Colin Gonsalves requested this Court to take up the maintainability
issue first before dealing with the merit of the case thereby raising the
maintainability issue stating that the present application ought to have
filed under an appeal but not under present proviso i.e. 439(2) of the
Cr.P.C r/w 482 of the same Code. The learned sr. counsel draws the
attention of the court to section 21 of the NIA Act and submits that
under section 21(4) of the Act provides provision that an appeal shall lie
to the High Court against an order of the Special Court granting or
refusing the bail.
The learned Advocate General submits that the present
application being preferred against bail order, the bail order is admittedly
an interlocutory order, the appeal does not lie in the present case. The
learned Advocate General draws this Court's attention to Section 21(1).
[11] Further, the learned Advocate General submits that Section
21 of the NIA Act will apply only to the Central Agency constituted by the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/94237945/ 7
State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Lhaineikim Lhouvum@ Kikim on 27 June, 2024
Central Government, but the present cases are investigated by the State
Agency as such, the present applications are maintainable. Further, the
learned Advocate General draws this Court's attention to Sections 6 and
10 of the NIA Act, for clarity and for reference Sections 6, 10 and 21 of
the NIA Act are reproduced herein below:-
Page 8 of 23
"6. Investigation of Scheduled Offences -
(1) On receipt of information and recording thereof
under section 154 of the Code relating to any scheduled
Offence the officer-in-charge of the police station shall
forward the report to the State Government forthwith.
(2) On receipt of the report under sub-section (1), the
State Government as expeditiously as possible.
(3) On receipt of report from the State Government,
the Central Government shall determine on the basis of
information made available by the State Government or
received from other sources, within fifteen days from the
date of receipt of the report, whether the offence is a
Scheduled Offence or not and also whether, having
regard to the gravity of the offence and other relevant
factors, it is a fit case to be investigated by the Agency.
(4) Where the Central Government is of the opinion
that the offence is a Scheduled offence and it is a fit case
to be investigated by the Agency, it shall direct the
Agency to investigate the said offence.
(5) Notwithstanding anything contained in this
section, if the Central Government is of the opinion that a
Scheduled Offence has been committed which is required
to be investigated under this Act, it may, suo moto, direct
the Agency to investigate the said offence.
(6) Where any direction has been given under sub-
section (4) or sub-section (5), the State Government and
any police officer of the State Government investigating
the offence shall not proceed with the investigation and
shall forthwith transmit the relevant documents and
records to the Agency.
(7) For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/94237945/ 8
State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Lhaineikim Lhouvum@ Kikim on 27 June, 2024
that till the Agency takes up the investigation of the case,
it shall be the duty of the officer-in-charge of the police
station to continue the investigation."
10. Power of State Government to investigate Scheduled
Offences -- Save as otherwise provided in this Act, nothing
contained in this Act shall affect the powers of the State
Government to investigate and prosecute any Scheduled Offence
or other offences under any law for the time being in force.
Page 9 of 23
21. Appeals.--
(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code,
an appeal shall lie from any judgment, sentence or order,
not being an interlocutory order, of a Special Court to the
High Court both on facts and on law.
(2) Every appeal under sub-section (1) shall be heard
by a bench of two Judges of the High Court and shall, as
far as possible, be disposed of within a period of three
months from the date of admission of the appeal.
(3) Except as aforesaid, no appeal or revision shall lie
to any court from any judgment, sentence or order
including an interlocutory order of a Special Court.
(4) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section
(3) of section 378 of the Code, an appeal shall lie to the
High Court against an order of the Special Court granting
or refusing bail.
(5) Every appeal under this section shall be preferred
within a period of thirty days from the date of the
judgment, sentence or order appealed from:
Provided that the High Court may entertain an
appeal after the expiry of the said period of thirty days if
it is satisfied that the appellant had sufficient cause for
not preferring the appeal within the period of thirty days:
Provided further that no appeal shall be
entertained after the expiry of period of ninety days."
[12] After hearing the rival contentions of the learned counsels
for the parties, I am of the opinion that there are 3 (three) issues raised:
(i) Whether the present petitioner should file the present
petitions on appeal or under the present Sections which
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/94237945/ 9
State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Lhaineikim Lhouvum@ Kikim on 27 June, 2024
the present petitioner filed.
(ii) If at all appeal is to be filed other than the present
Sections under which the petitioner filed, whether which
one of Section 21(1) or Section 21(4) of the NIA Act.
Page 10 of 23
(iii) The present Section 21(1) or 21(4) of the NIA Act will
apply only to the investigation conducted by the agency
constituted by Central Government or can also be
applied to the investigation conducted by the State
agency under the Scheduled Act.
[13] Section 6 relates to the investigating agency constituted by
the Central Government, Section 10 relates to power of the State
Government to investigate the Scheduled offences and Section 21 relates
to appeals challenging the orders passed by the Special Courts (NIA).
[14] It is admitted fact that allowing and rejecting the bail
application is an interlocutory order, but a perusal of Section 21(1) of the
NIA Act says that an appeal shall lie from any judgment, sentence or
order not being an interlocutory order of Special Court to the High Court
on facts and law. However, Section 21(4) specifically mentioned that an
appeal shall lie to the High Court against an order of the Special Court
granting or refusing bail. Hence, it is clear that in spite of being an
interlocutory order, the order of the Special Court granting or refusing
bail shall be filed on an appeal.
[15] On careful perusal of the section 21 NIA Act, it is evident
that the Act does not specify as to whether this section will apply only to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/94237945/ 10
State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Lhaineikim Lhouvum@ Kikim on 27 June, 2024
investigation made by the agency constituted by the Central Government
and not to agency constituted by the State Government. But, on
combined reading of Sections 6, 10 and 21 of the NIA Act, the Act does
not specifically mention about the applicability of Section 21 to Central
Page 11 of 23
Government constituted agency but kept silent as to whether Section 21
shall apply to State Government constituted agency or not. If the Section
21 is to be applied only to the Central Government constituted agency,
then the legislatures must put a provision separately for State
constituted agency. Hence, the Section 21 is silent about the applicability
of the agencies. It is presumed that both Sections 21(1) and 21(4) are
applicable to the investigation conducted by the Central Government as
well as the agency constituted by the State Government (State Agency).
[16] The learned counsel for the respondent further submits
that the present applications filed under Section 439(2) of Cr.P.C. r/w
Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. are not maintainable and liable to be
dismissed. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in (2014) 1 SCC 258 ["State of
Andhra Pradesh through Inspector General, National Investigation
Agency V. Mohd. Hussain @ Saleem" and in the matter of "Pragya
Singh Thakur V. National Investigation Agency"]. The relevant portions
of the judgment are extracted hereunder:
"16. The abovereferred Section 21(4) of the NIA Act provides
that an appeal lies to the High Court against an order of the
Special Court granting or refusing bail. However, sub-section (3)
which is a prior sub-section, specifically states that "except as
aforesaid", no appeal or revision shall lie to any court from any
judgment, sentence or order including an interlocutory order of a
Special Court, no such appeal or revision shall lie to any court
except as provided under sub-sections (1) and (2), meaning
thereby only to the High Court. This is the mandate of Section
21(3) of the NIA Act.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/94237945/ 11
State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Lhaineikim Lhouvum@ Kikim on 27 June, 2024
17. There is no difficulty in accepting the submission on
behalf of the appellant that an order granting or refusing bail is
an interlocutory order. The point however to be noted is that as
provided under Section 21(4) of the NIA Act, the appeal against
such an order lies to the High Court only, and to no other court
as laid down in Section 21(3). Thus it is only the interlocutory
Page 12 of 23
orders granting or refusing bail which are made appealable and
no other interlocutory orders, which is made clear in Section
21(1), which lays down that an appeal shall lie to the High Court
from any judgment, sentence or order, not being an interlocutory
order of a Special Court. Thus other interlocutory orders are not
appealable at all. This is because as provided under Section 19 of
the Act, the trial is to proceed on day-to-day basis. It is to be
conducted expeditiously. Therefore, no appeal is provided
against any of the interlocutory orders passed by the Special
Court. The only exception to this provision is that orders either
granting or refusing bail are made appealable under Section
21(4). This is because those orders are concerning the liberty of
the accused, and therefore although other interlocutory orders
are not appealable, an appeal is provided against the order
granting or refusing the bail. Section 21(4), thus carves out an
exception to the exclusion of interlocutory orders, which are not
therefore very much an order against which an appeal is
permitted under Section 21(1) of the Act.
18. Section 21(2) of the NIA Act provides that every such
appeal under sub-section (1) shall be heard by a Bench of two
Judges of the High Court. This is because of the importance that
is given by Parliament to the prosecution concerning the
Scheduled Offences. They are serious offences affecting the
sovereignty and security of the State amongst other offences, for
the investigation of which this Special Act has been passed. If
Parliament in its wisdom has desired that such appeal shall be
heard only by a Bench of two Judges of the High Court, this
Court cannot detract from the intention of Parliament. Therefore,
the interpretation placed by Mr. Ram Jethmalani on Section 21(1)
that all interlocutory orders are excluded from Section 21(1)
cannot be accepted. If such an interpretation is accepted it will
mean that there will be not appeal against an order granting or
refusing bail. On the other hand, sub-section (4) of Section 21
has made that specific provision, though sub-section (1)
otherwise excludes appeals from interlocutory orders. These
appeals under sub-section (1) are to be heard by a Bench of two
Judges as provided under sub-section (2). This being the
position, there is no merit in the submission canvassed on behalf
of the applicant that appeals against the orders granting or
refusing bail need not be heard by a Bench of two Judges.
20. As noted earlier, the submission of the applicant is
twofold:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/94237945/ 12
State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Lhaineikim Lhouvum@ Kikim on 27 June, 2024
(i) Firstly, as stated above the appeal against an
order granting or refusing bail under Section 21(4) of the
Act need not be before a Bench of two Judges, which is
untenable as noted above.
Page 13 of 23
(ii) The other submission is that the application for
bail which is made by the applicant before the High Court
is an original application under Section 21(4) of the MCOC
Act read with Section 439 of the Code, and is therefore,
maintainable before a Single Judge of the High Court. As
far as this submission is concerned, it has been repelled
in Usmanbhai relied upon by the counsel for the
applicant himself.
21. Usmanbhai was a matter under the Terror5st and
Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (28 of 1987), shortly known
as "TADA" . This Act also had a similar provision in Section 19(1)
thereof which reads as follows:
"19. Appeal. - (1) Notwithstanding anything contained
in the Code, an appeal shall lie as a matter of
right from any judgment, sentence or order, not
being an interlocutory order, of a Designated
Court to the Supreme Court both on facts and on
law.
(2) Except as aforesaid, no appeal or revision shall lie
to any court from any judgment, sentence or
order including an interlocutory order of a
Designated Court.
It is also material to note that Section 20(8) of
TADA had provisions identical to Section 21(40 of MCOC
Act. The Gujarat High Court while interpreting the
provisions of TADA had held that it did not have the
jurisdiction to entertain the application for bail either
under Section 439 or under Section 482 of the Code.
That view was confirmed by this Court by specifically
stating at the end of para 22 of its judgment in
Usmanbhai case in following words : (SCC pp. 289 -
90).
"22. ................ We must accordingly uphold the view
expressed by the High Court that it had no
jurisdiction to entertain an application for bail
under Section 439 or under Section 482 of the
Code."

24. In Para No. 13 of the judgment this Court confirmed the
view taken in Usmanbhai in the following words: (Salimbhai
Abdulgaffar Shaikh case, SCC p. 58).
"13. Section 20 of the TADA contained an identical
provision which expressly excluded the
applicability of Section 438 of the Code but said
nothing about Section 439 and a similar argument
that the power of the High Court to grant bail
under the aforesaid provision consequently
remained intact was repelled in Usmanbhai
Dawoodbhai Menon V. State of Gujarat .
Having regard to the scheme of TADA, it was held
that there was complete exclusion of the
jurisdiction of the High Court to entertain a bail
application under Section 439 of the Code. This
view was reiterated in State of Punjab V.
Kewal Singh.
27.2. And, secondly as far as Prayer 9b) of the petition for
clarification is concerned, it is made clear that inasmuch as the
applicant is being prosecuted for the offences under the MCOC
Act, 1999, as well as the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act,
1967, such offences are triable only by the Special Court, and
therefore application for bail in such matters will have to be
made before the Special Court either under Section 439 or under
Section 482 of the Code. The application for bail filed by the
applicant in the present case is not maintainable before the High
Court.
27.3. Thus, where the NIA Act applies, the original application
for bail shall lie only before the Special Court, and appeal against
the orders therein shall lie to a Bench of two Judges of the High
Court.
In (2020) 10 SCC 616 [Bikramjit Singh V. State of
Punjab], the relevant portion of the judgment is extracted below:
"25. When these provisions are read along with Section
2(1)(d) and the provisos in Section 43-D(2) of the UAPA, the
scheme of the two Acts, which are to be read together, becomes
crystal clear. Under the first proviso to Section 167(2) of the
Code can be extended up to a maximum period of 180 days if
"the Court" is satisfied with the report of the Public Prosecutor
indicating progress of investigation and specific reasons for
detention of the accused beyond the period of 90 days. "The
Court", when read with the extended definition contained in
Section 2(1)(d) of the UAPA, now speaks of the Special Court
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/94237945/ 14
State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Lhaineikim Lhouvum@ Kikim on 27 June, 2024
constituted under Section 22 of the NIA Act. What becomes
clear, therefore, from a reading of these provisions is that all
Page 15 of 23
offences under the UAPA, the Special Court alone has exclusive
jurisdiction to try such offences. This becomes even clearer on a
reading of Section 16 of the NIA Act which makes it clear that
the Special Court may take cognizance of an offence without the
accused being committed to it for trial upon receipt of a
complaint of facts or upon a police report of such facts. What is
equally clear from a reading of Section 16(2) of the NIA Act is
that even though offences may be punishable with imprisonment
for a term not exceeding 3 years, the Special Court alone is to try
such offence - albeit in a summary way if it thinks it fit to do so.
On a conspectus of the abovementioned provisions, Section 13
read with Section 22(2)(ii) of the NIA Act, in particular, the
argument of the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
State of Punjab based on Section 10 of the said Act has no legs
to stand on since the Special Court has exclusive jurisdiction over
every Scheduled Offence investigated by the investigating
agency of the State.
26. Before the NIA Act was enacted, offences under the UAPA
were of two kinds - those with a maximum imprisonment of over
7 years, and those with a maximum imprisonment of 7 years and
under. Under the Code as applicable to offences against other
laws, offences having a maximum sentence of 7 years and under
are triable by the Magistrate's courts, whereas offences having a
maximum sentence of above 7 years are triable by Courts of
Session. This scheme has been completely done away with by
the NIA Act, 2008 as all Scheduled Offences i.e. all offences
under the UAPA, whether investigated by the National
Investigation Agency or by the investigating agencies of the
State Government, are to be tried exclusively by Special Courts
set up under that Act. In the absence of any designated court by
notification issued by either the Central Government or the State
Government, the fall back is upon the Court of Session alone.
Thus, under the aforesaid scheme what becomes clear is that so
far as all offences under the UAPA are concerned, the
Magistrate's jurisdiction to extend time under the first proviso in
Section 43-D(2)(b) is non-existent, "the Court" being either a
Sessions Court, in the absence of a notification specifying a
Special Court, or the Special Court itself. The impugned
Judgment in arriving at the contrary conclusion is incorrect as it
has missed Section 22(2) read with Section 13 of the NIA Act.
Also, the impugned judgment has missed Section 16(1) of the
NIA Act which states that a Special Court may take cognizance of
any offence without the accused being committed to it for trial,
inter alia, upon a police report of such facts."

[17] The learned Advocate General on the other hand fervently
submitted that the maintainability issue does not arise at all as the
present case is investigated by the State investigating authority not by
the agency constituted by the Central Government under Section 6 of
NIA Act. But, the present case is purely a State case constituted under
Section 10 of the NIA Act. Section 21 of NIA Act applies only for the
cases investigated dealt with by the Central Agency
empowered/constituted by the Central Government.
[18] The Law & Legislative Affairs Department, Government of
Manipur issued a notification dated 10.06.2022 wherein under Section 22
(1) of the NIA Act, 2008, the Hon'ble Governor after consultation with
Hon'ble The Chief Justice of the High Court of Manipur, Special Courts
are constituted for trial of offences under any or all the enactments
specified in the Schedule of the said Act and the same is reproduced

[19] The above mentioned notification was made under Section 22 sub-section (1) of
National Investigation Agency Act, 2008. For better appreciation of the above
notification, Section 22 of the NIA Act is reproduced herein below:
"22. Power of State Government to constitute Special Courts.-- (1) The State
Government may constitute one or more Special Courts for the trial of offences under
any or all the enactments specified in the Schedule.
(2) The provisions of this Chapter shall apply to the Special Courts constituted by the
State Government under sub-
section (1) and shall have effect subject to the following modifications, namely--
(i) references to "Central Government" in sections 11 and 15 shall be construed as references to State
Government;
(ii) reference to "Agency" in sub-section (1) of section 13 shall be construed as a reference to the
"investigation agency of the State Government";
(iii) reference to "Attorney-General for India" in sub-
section (3) of section 13 shall be construed as reference to "Advocate-General of the State". (3) The
jurisdiction conferred by this Act on a Special Court shall, until a Special Court is constituted by the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/94237945/ 17
State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Lhaineikim Lhouvum@ Kikim on 27 June, 2024
State Government under sub-section (1) in the case of any offence punishable under this Act,
notwithstanding anything contained in the Code, be exercised by the Court of Session of the division
in which such offence has been committed and it shall have all the powers and follow the procedure
provided under this Chapter. (4) On and from the date when the Special Court is constituted by the
State Government the trial of any offence investigated by the State Government under the
provisions of this Act, which would have been required to be held before the Special Court, shall
stand transferred to that Court on the date on which it is constituted.
[20] On combined reading of both the above notification with Section 22, it is clear that the said
notification for constitution of Special Courts was made under NIA Act. On further perusal of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court's judgment (2020) 10 SCC 616 [Bikramjit Singh V. State of Punjab] and
(2014) 1 SCC 258 ["State of Andhra Pradesh through Inspector General, National Investigation
Agency V. Mohd.
Hussain @ Saleem" and in the matter of "Pragya Singh Thakur V. National Investigation Agency"], it
is evident and clear that the judgment, sentence and order passed by the Special Court constituted
under the Act and investigated by the Central Agency as well as the State Agency under the
scheduled offences will come under Section 21 of the Act.
[21] The learned Advocate General made reference to series of Hon'ble Supreme Court's judgments,
but these judgments and orders are all for consideration of the case on merit of the subject case. But,
right now, the issue of maintainability as to whether the present applications filed under Section 439
(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code read with Section 482 of Cr.P.C. are maintainable or not or are
liable to be filed under Section 21 of NIA Act. This judgment and order of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court will be considered when the matter is heard on merit.
[22] The learned Advocate General submitted that the present applications with the reliefs sought
for come under Section 21(1) of the NIA Act as such, as the dismissal and allowing the bail
application comes under interlocutory order as such not appealable on the other hand, the learned
counsel for the respondent Mr. Gonsalves submitted that the present application comes under
section 21(4) of the NIA Act.
[23] On combined reading of the Section 21(1) and Section 21(4) of the Act, it is evident that the
present applications filed by the State come/fall under section 21(4). The Hon'ble Supreme Court in
(2014) 1 Supreme Court Cases 258 - State of Andra Pradesh through Inspector General, National
Investigation Agency vs Mohd. Hussain Alias Saleem and in the matter of Pragya Singh Thakur vs
National Investigation Agency (Supra) rejected the plea of the applicant that the applications for bail
filed by the applicant are not maintainable before the High Court, an appeal against any order
passed by Special Court shall lie only to the division bench of two judges of High Court. Further, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court at para no. 17, 18, 27.2 & 27.3 observed that:-
"17. There is no difficulty in accepting the submission on behalf of the appellant that
an order granting or refusing bail is an interlocutory order. The point however to be
noted is that as provided under Section 21(4) of the NIA Act, the appeal against such
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/94237945/ 18
State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Lhaineikim Lhouvum@ Kikim on 27 June, 2024
an order lies to the High Court only, and to no other court as laid down in Section
21(3). Thus it is only the interlocutory orders granting or refusing bail which are
made appealable and no other interlocutory orders, which is made clear in Section
21(1), which lays down that an appeal shall lie to the High Court from any judgment,
sentence or order, not being an interlocutory order of a Special Court. Thus other
interlocutory orders are not appealable at all. This is because as provided under
Section 19 of the Act, the trial is to proceed on day-to-day basis. It is to be conducted
expeditiously. Therefore, no appeal is provided against any of the interlocutory
orders passed by the Special Court. The only exception to this provision is that orders
either granting or refusing bail are made appealable under Section 21(4). This is
because those orders are concerning the liberty of the accused, and therefore
although other interlocutory orders are not appealable, an appeal is provided against
the order granting or refusing the bail. Section 21(4), thus carves out an exception to
the exclusion of interlocutory orders, which are not therefore very much an order
against which an appeal is permitted under Section 21(1) of the Act.
18. Section 21(2) of the NIA Act provides that every such appeal under sub-section (1)
shall be heard by a Bench of two Judges of the High Court. This is because of the
importance that is given by Parliament to the prosecution concerning the Scheduled
Offences. They are serious offences affecting the sovereignty and security of the State
amongst other offences, for the investigation of which this Special Act has been
passed. If Parliament in its wisdom has desired that such appeal shall be heard only
by a Bench of two Judges of the High Court, this Court cannot detract from the
intention of Parliament. Therefore, the interpretation placed by Mr. Ram Jethmalani
on Section 21(1) that all interlocutory orders are excluded from Section 21(1) cannot
be accepted. If such an interpretation is accepted it will mean that there will be not
appeal against an order granting or refusing bail. On the other hand, sub-section (4)
of Section 21 has made that specific provision, though sub-section (1) otherwise
excludes appeals from interlocutory orders. These appeals under sub-section (1) are
to be heard by a Bench of two Judges as provided under sub-section (2). This being
the position, there is no merit in the submission canvassed on behalf of the applicant
that appeals against the orders granting or refusing bail need not be heard by a Bench
of two Judges.
27.2. And, secondly as far as Prayer (b) of the petition for clarification is concerned, it
is made clear that inasmuch as the applicant is being prosecuted for the offences
under the MCOC Act, 1999, as well as the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967,
such offences are triable only by the Special Court, and therefore application for bail
in such matters will have to be made before the Special Court either under Section
439 or under Section 482 of the Code. The application for bail filed by the applicant
in the present case is not maintainable before the High Court.
27.3. Thus, where the NIA Act applies, the original application for bail shall lie only
before the Special Court, and appeal against the orders therein shall lie to a Bench of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/94237945/ 19
State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Lhaineikim Lhouvum@ Kikim on 27 June, 2024
two Judges of the High Court.
[24] From the analysis and deliberation made in the preceding paras, 2 (two) facts
have emerged:
It does not say that Section 21 of the NIA Act shall exclusively apply to the matter
dealt with by the Central agency nor does it imply non-applicability of the said
Section to the ones handled by the State agencies. Another fact is that the
Constitution of NIA Courts by the State Government and investigation of the case(s)
by the State agencies are done under the NIA Act as mentioned above. In the event of
the NIA Act not having expressed provisions on the certain issue in this matter, the
relevant provision provided therein under the Act shall be applicable to the issue in
question.
[25] In view of the discussion and observations made above and on combined reading
of the aforesaid Sections 21(1), (2), (3) and (4) of NIA Act with the above observations
made by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, it is crystal clear that the present applications
filed under Section 439(2) of the Criminal Procedure r/w 482 of the same Court are
not maintainable but the present applications ought to have filed under section 21(4)
of NIA Act.
[26] For the aforementioned reasons, the present applications made by the State petitioner are
dismissed as not maintainable. No order as to costs.
