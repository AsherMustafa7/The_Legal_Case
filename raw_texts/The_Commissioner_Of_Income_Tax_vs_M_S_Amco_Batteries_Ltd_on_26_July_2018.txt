1. Both the learned counsels have brought to the notice of this Court that the Central Board of Direct

Court and the earlier monetary limits for the High Courts is upwardly revised from Rs.20,00,000 to
Rs.50,00,000/- w.e.f.
11th July, 2018. The said Circular is quoted below;
F No. 279/Misc. 142/2007-ITJ (Pt) Government of India Date of order :26.07.2018 ITA
No.185/2012 The Commissioner of Income-tax & Anr. vs. M/s.Amco Batteries Ltd., Ministry of

Date of order :26.07.2018 ITA No.185/2012 The Commissioner of Income-tax & Anr. vs. M/s.Amco
Batteries Ltd.,
3. Before Supreme Court 1,00,00,000 It is clarified that an appeal should not be filed merely
because the tax effect in a case exceeds the monetary limits prescribed above. Filing of appeal in
such cases is to be decided on merits of the case.
4. For this purpose, 'tax effect' means the difference between the tax on the total income assessed
and the tax that would have been chargeable had such total income been reduced by the amount of
income in respect of the issues against which appeal is intended to be filed (hereinafter referred to
as 'disputed issues'). Further, 'tax effect' shall be tax including applicable surcharge and cess.
However, the tax will not include any interest thereon, except where chargeability of interest itself is
in dispute. In case the chargeability of interest is the issue under dispute, the amount of interest
shall be the tax effect. In cases where returned loss is reduced or assessed as income, the tax effect
would include notional tax on disputed additions. In case of penalty orders, the tax effect will mean
quantum of penalty deleted or reduced in the order to be appealed against.
5. The Assessing Officer shall calculate the tax effect separately for every assessment year in respect
of the disputed issues in the case of every assessee.
Date of order :26.07.2018 ITA No.185/2012 The Commissioner of Income-tax & Anr. vs. M/s.Amco
Batteries Ltd., If, in the case of an assessee, the disputed issues arise in more than one assessment
year, appeal can be filed in respect of such assessment year or years in which the tax effect in respect
of the disputed issues exceeds the monetary limit specified in para 3. No appeal shall be filed in
respect of an assessment year or years in which the tax effect is less than the monetary limit
specified in para 3. In other words, henceforth, appeals can be filed only with reference to the tax
effect in the relevant assessment year. However, in case of a composite order of any High Court or
appellate authority, which involves more than one assessment year and common issues in more
than one assessment year, appeals shall be filed in respect of all such assessment years even if the
tax effect is less than the prescribed monetary limits in any of the year(s), if it is decided to file
appeal in respect of the year(s) in which tax effect exceeds the monetary limit prescribed. In case
where a composite order/ judgment involves more than one assessee, each assessee shall be dealt
with separately.
6. Further, where income is computed under the provisions of section 115JB or section 115JC, for the
purposes of determination of 'tax effect', tax on the total income assessed shall be computed as per
the following formula-
(A - B)+(C - D) Date of order :26.07.2018 ITA No.185/2012 The Commissioner of Income-tax & Anr.
vs. M/s.Amco Batteries Ltd., where, A = the total income assessed as per the provisions other than
the provisions contained in section 115JB or section 115JC (herein called general provisions);
B = the total income that would have been chargeable had the total income assessed as per the
general provisions been reduced by the amount of the disputed issues under general provisions;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/111113424/ 3
The Commissioner Of Income Tax vs M/S Amco Batteries Ltd on 26 July, 2018
C = the total income assessed as per the provisions contained in section 115JB or section 115JC;
D = the total income that would have been chargeable had the total income assessed as per the
provisions contained in section 115JB or section 1I5JCwas reduced by the amount of disputed issues
under the said provisions:
However, where the amount of disputed issues is considered both under the
provisions contained in section 115JB or section 115JC and under general provisions,
such amount shall not be reduced from total income assessed while determining the
amount under item D.
7. In a case where appeal before a Tribunal or a Court is not filed only on account of the tax effect
being less than the monetary Date of order :26.07.2018 ITA No.185/2012 The Commissioner of
Income-tax & Anr. vs. M/s.Amco Batteries Ltd., limit specified above, the Pr. Commissioner of
Income-tax/ Commissioner of Income Tax shall specifically record that "even though the decision is
not acceptable, appeal is not being filed only on the consideration that the tax effect is less than the
monetary limit specified in this Circular". Further, in such cases, there will be no presumption that
the Income-tax Department has acquiesced in the decision on the disputed issues. The Income-tax
Department shall not be precluded from filing an appeal against the disputed issues in the case of
the same assessee for any other assessment year, or in the case of any other assessee for the same or
any other assessment year, if the tax effect exceeds the specified monetary limits.
8. In the past, a number of instances have come to the notice of the Board, whereby an assessee has
claimed relief from the Tribunal or the Court only on the ground that the Department has implicitly
accepted the decision of the Tribunal or Court in the case of the assessee for any other assessment
year or in the case of any other assessee for the same or any other assessment year, by not filing an
appeal on the same disputed issues. The Departmental representatives/counsels must make every
effort to bring to the notice of the Tribunal or the Court that the Date of order :26.07.2018 ITA
No.185/2012 The Commissioner of Income-tax & Anr. vs. M/s.Amco Batteries Ltd., appeal in such
cases was not filed or not admitted only for the reason of the tax effect being less than the specified
monetary limit and, therefore, no inference should be drawn that the decisions rendered therein
were acceptable to the Department. Accordingly, they should impress upon the Tribunal or the
Court that such cases do not have any precedent value and also bring to the notice of the Tribunal/
Court the provisions of sub section (4) of section 268A of the Income-tax Act, 1961 which read as
under :
"(4) The Appellate Tribunal or Court, hearing such appeal or reference, shall have
regard to the orders, instructions or directions issued under sub-section (1) and the
circumstances under which such appeal or application for reference was filed or not
filed in respect of any case."
9. As the evidence of not filing appeal due to this Circular may have to be produced in courts, the
judicial folders in the office of Pr.CsIT/ CsIT must be maintained in a systemic manner for easy
retrieval.

10. Adverse judgments relating to the following issues should be contested on merits
notwithstanding that the tax effect entailed is less than the monetary limits specified in para 3 above
or there is no tax effect:
Date of order :26.07.2018 ITA No.185/2012 The Commissioner of Income-tax & Anr.
vs. M/s.Amco Batteries Ltd.,
(a) Where the Constitutional validity of the provisions of an Act or Rule is under
challenge, or
(b) Where Board's order, Notification, Instruction or Circular has been held to be
illegal or ultra vires, or
(c) Where Revenue Audit objection in the case has been accepted by the Department,
or
(d) Where the addition relates to undisclosed foreign assets/ bank accounts.
11. The monetary limits specified in para 3 above shall not apply to writ matters and Direct tax
matters other than Income tax. Filing of appeals in other Direct tax matters shall continue to be
governed by relevant provisions of statute and rules. Further, in cases where the tax effect is not
quantifiable or not involved, such as the case of registration of trusts or institutions under section
12A/ 12AA of the IT Act, 1961 etc., filing of appeal shall not be governed by the limits specified in
para 3 above and decision to file appeals in such cases may be taken on merits of a particular case.
12. It is clarified that the monetary limit of Rs. 20 lakhs for filing appeals before the ITAT would
apply equally to cross objections under section 253(4) of the Act. Cross objections below this
monetary limit, already filed, should be pursued for dismissal as Date of order :26.07.2018 ITA
No.185/2012 The Commissioner of Income-tax & Anr. vs. M/s.Amco Batteries Ltd., withdrawn/ not
pressed. Filing of cross objections below the monetary limit may not be considered henceforth.
Similarly, references to High Courts and SLPs/ appeals before Supreme Court below the monetary
limit of Rs. 50 lakhs and Rs. 1 Crore respectively should be pursued for dismissal as withdrawn/ not
pressed. References before High Court and SLPs/ appeals below these limits may not be considered
henceforth.
13. This Circular will apply to SLPs/appeals/cross objections/references to be filed henceforth in
SC/HCs/Tribunal and it shall also apply retrospectively to pending SLPs/ appeals/ cross
objections/references. Pending appeals below the specified tax limits in para 3 above may be
withdrawn/ not pressed."
14. The above may be brought to the notice of all concerned.
15. This issue under Section 268A of the Income-tax Act 1961.
