COMMON ORDER
Factual Matrix:-
These cases are with respect to the order passed by the first respondent in the second
appeal filed under Section 28(6) of the National Medical Commission Act, 2019,
(herein after to be mentioned as NMC Act) by the writ petitioner Medical College
regarding starting of new PG courses for 21 disciplines of broad and super speciality
Post Graduate medical education, rejecting the second appeal, thereby confirming
the decision of the first appeal Committee, that is, the second respondent dated
05.08.2024, which upheld the decision of the third respondent, that is, the Medical
Assessment and Rating Board (herein after to be mentioned as MARB) dated
13.06.2024.
2.The writ petitioner College was established during the academic year 2021 - 2022 with an intake
of 150 seats in the MBBS course. On 16.08.2023, the third respondent issued a public notice,
inviting applications for starting New Courses/Increase of seats in Post Graduate
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 20/05/2025 04:34:47 pm ) W.P.(MD)Nos.126 to
135 and 447 to 456 of 2025 courses, for the academic year 2024 - 2025. Pursuant to such notice, the
petitioner college submitted applications for 21 disciplines of broad and super speciality Post
Graduate medical education. Final order regarding the application of the petitioner College for
starting new PG courses was passed by the third respondent on 13.06.2024, by issuing a letter of
disapproval. The said letter of disapproval was issued on the basis of the review of the standard
assessment form submitted by the petitioner College conducted by the third respondent Board along
with the group of experts and review committee, on the basis of MARB Regulations, 2023, published
on 2nd June 2023, PG - Medical Education Regulation, 2000, issued on 22nd August, 2000. Such
letter of disapproval for the application of the petitioner College for the academic year 2024 - 2025
was issued as per Section 28(3) proviso of the NMC Act, 2019, for not complying attendance, as per
the AEBAS attendance per unit and for non- availability of Essentiality Certificate.
3.Following which, a show cause notice dated 28.03.2024, came to be issued by the third
respondent with respect to the application of the petitioner college for 21 disciplines of broad and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131749895/ 3
M/S.Srinivasan Medical College And ... vs Union Of India on 24 December, 2024
super speciality Post Graduate medical education for the academic year 2024 – 2025, directing the
petitioner college to perform self assessment of its application as mentioned in Post Graduate
Medical Education Regulation, 2000, and submit the report and also a compliance report on the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 20/05/2025 04:34:47 pm ) W.P.(MD)Nos.126 to
135 and 447 to 456 of 2025 deficiencies/inadequacies pointed out in the letter of disapproval along
with duly filled and signed affidavit within 10 days from the date of issuance of the said show cause
notice.
4.However, the petitioner college preferred first appeal before the second respondent on
04.07.2024, in this regard. The second respondent by E-mail dated 05.08.2024, communicated the
petitioner college that the first appeal Committee after hearing the college authority and re-
verifying the documents and records and pointing out the fact that the petitioner college do not have
Essentiality Certificate upheld the decision of the third respondent/MARB. Hence, the petitioner
College preferred second appeal before the first respondent on 12.09.2024. The first respondent by
order dated 24.12.2024 and 08.01.2025 respectively, rejected the second appeal by the petitioner
College for starting various disciplines of broad and super speciality Post Graduate medical
education by separate rejection orders on the same day.
5.Challenging the rejection of these second appeals, the petitioner College has filed these Writ
Petitions and as far as the Writ Petition in W.P.(MD)No.452 of 2025, the petitioner college has
sought for a direction to the respondents to permit them to commence MD community medicine.

6.Heard the resounding submission of the learned Senior Counsels Mr.Maninder Singh and
Mr.B.Saravanan, for the petitioner College, the learned counsel for the second and third
respondents, Ms.Subbaranjini, and the learned Additional Solicitor General of India,
Mr.A.R.L.Sunderesan, for the first respondent, the learned Government Advocate, Mr.Amjad Khan
for the fourth and fifth respondents at length.
7.This case is primarily concerned with the question whether the first respondent is justified in
passing the order dated 24.12.2024 and 08.01.2025 respectively, rejecting the second appeal, more
particularly with respect to the applications for 21 disciplines of broad and super speciality Post
Graduate medical education submitted by the petitioner College.
Submissions:-
8.The learned Senior Counsel Mr.Maninder Singh who appeared for the petitioner
college submitted that Clause 11.1 of the 2000 Regulations stipulates a requirement
of 1 Professor, 1 Associate Professor, 1 Assistant Professor, 1 Senior Resident and 2
Junior Residents to constitute one (1) unit in a board speciality course. In case there
are multiple units, the associate professor can be the unit chief along with two
assistant professors. 1 unit comprises of 30 beds.

9.Clause 12(1) of the 2000 Regulations stipulates that the Professor : Student ratio shall be 1:2
whereas; for other cadres (Associate Professor), the ratio stands at 1:1. He drew the attention of this
Court to the relevant provision, which is extracted as follows:-
“.......The ratio of recognised postgraduate teacher to the number of students to be
admitted for the degree course where diploma is not prescribed shall be 1:2 for a
Professor and 1:1 for other cadre covered by a general note following this rule in each
unit per year subject to a maximum of 5 PG seats for the degree per unit per
academic year provided a complement of 10 teaching beads is added to the
prescribed bed strength of 30 for the unit for broad specialities.....”
10.Further, for the courses of Anesthesiology, Forensic Medicine and Psychiatry [pre and
para-clinical subjects], the ratio of Professor :
Student stands at 1:3 and for other cadres (Associate Professor), the ratio stands at
1:1. He categorically submitted that, for para and pre-clinical subjects such as
Anesthesiology, Forensic Medicine and Psychiatry, the requirements of units and
beds do not apply as per Clause 12(3) of the 2000 Regulations. To substantiate the
same, he drew my attention to the relevant portion which is extracted as follows:-
“....The requirement of units and beds shall not apply in the case of Postgraduate
degree or diploma courses in Basic and para-clinical departments...”

12.The learned Senior Counsel, Mr.B.Saravanan, submitted that the letter of disapproval dated
13.06.2024, on considering the application made by the petitioner College came to be issued on two
grounds, namely, lack of attendance of the faculty as per AEBAS attendance and non-availability of
Essentiality Certificate. A show cause notice dated 28.03.2024, was also issued in this regard.
Following which, when the petitioner College preferred first appeal before the second respondent on
04.07.2024, the decision of the second respondent was communicated to the petitioner College by
the email dated 05.08.2024, in which only the absence of Essentiality Certificate was cited as a
reason for rejection. Against which, when the second appeal was preferred before the first
respondent vide impugned orders dated 24.12.2024 and 08.01.2025 respectively, the first
respondent has once again gone into the aspect of non-availability of attendance of faculty as per
AEBAS attendance and the non-availability of Essentiality Certificate.
13.The second respondent having dispensed with the non- availability of faculties in their order, the
first respondent ought not to have gone into the same in their order. He also insisted that non-
availability of Essentiality Certificate can never ever be fatal for the application made by the
petitioner College for the sole reason that on 21.11.2024, the second respondent had informed the
first respondent https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 20/05/2025 04:34:47 pm )
W.P.(MD)Nos.126 to 135 and 447 to 456 of 2025 vide file No:M-19011/36/2024/NMC/PGMARB,
that it has been decided by NMC to keep in abeyance the requirement of Essentiality Certificate for
starting of new medical PG courses for the academic year 2024-2025. In view of the said
communication, the first respondent ought not to have passed the order of rejection of second
appeal on the reason of non- availability of Essentiality Certificate while the aspect of attendance
has not been gone into by the second respondent in its first appeal and on that basis, pressed for
allowing the Writ Petitions.
14.The learned Deputy Solicitor General of India submitted that, since the applicant College did not
possess attendance of the faculty as per AEBAS attendance and due to the non-availability of
Essentiality Certificate, on consideration of the submissions and documents made by the petitioner
College and after due examination, the Central Government decided to reject the second appeal by
the petitioner College for commencing 21 disciplines of broad and super speciality Post Graduate
medical education and there is no irrelevance or illegality in the same, the same is in order and
pressed for dismissal of Writ Petitions.
15.The learned counsel appearing for the second and third respondent, Ms.Subbaranjani, submitted
that, dispensation of Essentiality Certificate, which was made available to those applicants for new
medical PG courses for the academic year 2024-2025 by https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis (
Uploaded on: 20/05/2025 04:34:47 pm ) W.P.(MD)Nos.126 to 135 and 447 to 456 of 2025
communication of the second respondent dated 21.11.2024, is available only for those institutions
who possess available clinical material and faculties as per regulation and norms of the National
Medical Commission. However, in the instant case, the letter of disapproval itself came to be issued
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131749895/ 6
M/S.Srinivasan Medical College And ... vs Union Of India on 24 December, 2024
by the third respondent only on the ground of lack of appropriate faculties as per regulations and
norms of NMC. Hence, the writ petitioner cannot claim the benefit of the communication issued by
the second respondent to the first respondent dated 21.11.2024, for not possessing Essentiality
Certificate.
16.Further she reiterated that starting or commencing or running a medical college is not a
fundamental right, but education is a fundamental right as such, though the policy of the
Government is towards actively increasing the number of medical colleges, the primordial aspect
which would be taken up for consideration by the third respondent while scrutiny of applications for
commencing new PG courses would be to ensure, whether necessary knowledge, skill and qualitative
medical education could be imparted by the institutions by appointing appropriate number of
faculty and establishing proper infrastructure as per regulations and norms of the National Medical
Commission. Only a properly trained student could effectively cater to the health needs of the people
in a Country with a large population like India.

135 and 447 to 456 of 2025
17.More particularly, the dispensation of Essentiality Certificate could be considered only in cases of
Colleges, which has been established and been running for several years and as far as the instant
case is concerned, the petitioner College is a new College, which was commenced only in the year
2021-2022. She further categorically contended that the rejection of the application made by the
petitioner College came to be made only after appropriate assessment of the standard assessment
form submitted by the petitioner College by the third respondent with a group of experts and review
committee. Only because of the fact that the petitioner College failed to fulfill the expectations and
mandates of MARB Regulations, 2023 and PG - Medical Education Regulation, 2000, the
applications came to be rejected and the same is in order and pressed for dismissal of the Writ
Petitions. Analysis:-
18.For maintaining highest standards in imparting medical education by Medical
Colleges/Institutions in the Country, the Medical Council of India was constituted under the
provisions of Indian Medical Council Act, 1956, (herein after to be mentioned as IMC Act). It had
been the statutory duty of the Medical Council of India to take all such steps, which is required to be
taken for ensuring the maintenance of highest standards in medical education in the Country. Now,

135 and 447 to 456 of 2025

Assessment and Rating Regulations, 2023”, in short, “Establishment of Medical Institutions,
Assessment and Rating Regulations, 2023” (hereinafter to be referred as the Assessment and Rating
Regulations, 2023).
27.The third respondent by a public notice dated 16.08.2023, bearing
No.NMC/MARB/2024-2025/047842, invited applications for Post Graduation courses - broad and
super speciality courses; for new courses/increase of MD/MS, DM/M.Ch seats for the academic year
2024 - 2025. Pursuant to the same, the petitioner medical college made applications on 15.09.2023,
for grant of approval/letter of permission for 21 PG medical disciplines and for starting admissions
in all those PG https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 20/05/2025 04:34:47 pm )
W.P.(MD)Nos.126 to 135 and 447 to 456 of 2025 medical courses for the academic year 2024 -
2025. On receipt of the said applications for various PG courses after initial scrutiny, certain
deficiencies were identified by the third respondent. Hence, separate show cause notice dated
28.03.2024, came to be issued by the third respondent to the petitioner medical college pointing out
the inadequacies in every application.
28.The non-availability of Essentiality Certificate and the lack of AEBAS attendance with respect to
the faculty was considered for the period from 01.01.2024 to 29.02.2024, directing the petitioner
college to perform self-assessment of its application as mentioned in PG Medical Education
Regulation, 2000, and submit a report within 10 days from the date of issuance of the said show
cause notice; to submit the compliance report on the deficiencies/inadequacies and to submit the
duly filled and signed affidavit within 10 days from the date of issuance of the aforesaid show cause
notice. However, the petitioner College did not submit the self-assessment report, compliance report
on the deficiencies/inadequacies and signed affidavit in the format attached in the aforesaid show
cause notice within 10 days from the date of receipt of the show cause notice dated 28.03.2024.
29.Due to the failure of the petitioner College to respond to the said show cause notice, the third
respondent considered the AEBAS data and https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on:
20/05/2025 04:34:47 pm ) W.P.(MD)Nos.126 to 135 and 447 to 456 of 2025 thereafter, forwarded
the applications made by the petitioner College to the expert group for scrutiny and evaluation and
on receipt of the report from the expert group, after final scrutiny, issued the letter of disapproval in
each of the 21 applications on 13.06.2024. The main inadequacy pointed out in the letter of
disapproval is also the non- availability of Essentiality Certificate and the inadequacy in the number
of faculties as per AEBAS attendance. On receipt of the letter of disapproval issued by the third
respondent, the petitioner College woke up suddenly and preferred a first appeal before the second
respondent on 04.07.2024.
30.Even in the first appeal in the compliance report given by the petitioner Medical College, it has
been stated that Essentiality Certificate is not available and that as per their request letter dated
30.03.2024 to the Principal Secretary, Department of Health and Family Welfare and Directorate of
Medical Education, Tamil Nadu, the Directorate appointed a scrutiny team for verification for
issuing the Essentiality Certificate to start PG courses and the inspection has been completed and
that the College is awaiting for Essentiality Certificate from the government of Tamil Nadu. As far as
the faculty position is concerned, the explanation submitted in the appeal is that during the month
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131749895/ 11
M/S.Srinivasan Medical College And ... vs Union Of India on 24 December, 2024
of January 2024 and February 2024, there had been a lot of festival holidays like pongal etc, because
of the same AEBAS attendance percentage was less than 75 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis (
Uploaded on: 20/05/2025 04:34:47 pm ) W.P.(MD)Nos.126 to 135 and 447 to 456 of 2025
percentage for most of the faculties and that due to biometric issues and resignation of some of the
faculties, there had been a lack in AEBAS attendance for the period 1st January 2024 to 29th
January 2024 and as new faculties were appointed in the place of relieved faculties AEBAS
attendance is as per NMC norms for the period 1st May 2024 to 30th June 2024 and the same has
been attached. However, the said appeal was conspicuously silent as to the faculty position and their
AEBAS attendance for the period between 1st March and 30th April 2024.
31.The appeal dated 04.07.2024, submitted by the petitioner College was duly considered by the
second respondent and the mail communication on 05.08.2024, was made by the second
respondent to the petitioner College, communicating the decision of the first appeal committee that
the appeal Committee heard the college authority and re- verified the documents and records and
due to the acceptance of the college authorities that they do not have the Essentiality Certificate
(EC), the committee had upheld the decision of the third respondent.
32.Against which, a second appeal was preferred by the petitioner College on 12.09.2024, before the
first respondent, explaining that the petitioner College has had applied to the Principal Secretary,
Department of Health and Family Welfare, Government of Tamil Nadu, and the Directorate of
Medical Education, Tamil Nadu, for obtaining the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on:
20/05/2025 04:34:47 pm ) W.P.(MD)Nos.126 to 135 and 447 to 456 of 2025 Essentiality Certificate
to their institution for starting the starting the new Post Graduate courses during the academic year
2024-2025 and the same has been duly received from the State Government for 21 departments, for
which they have already made applications and the same may be taken into consideration and
permit the college to start the Post Graduate courses in the institution during the academic year
2024-2025. The Essentiality Certificate dated 10.09.2024 was also enclosed by the petitioner
College along with the second appeal. However, without considering the same, the Central
Government after examination, rejected the second appeal by the petitioner College by the
impugned order dated 24.12.2024 and 08.01.2025 respectively.
33.The learned Senior Counsels appearing for the petitioner Medical College categorically relying
upon the case of the National Medical Commission versus the Principal, K.M.C.T. Medical College
and Others1 submitted that making a party run from Court to Court to seek permission, specifically
when the institute concerned is not a new institute and has been running for the past several years is
only an attempt to harass the institution and the petitioner institution is not a new institution and
categorically submitted that having not considered the factum of faculty position in the first appeal
later in the second appeal, the first respondent ought not to have rejected the second appeal 1SLP(C)
No.-020091-020092 - 2024 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 20/05/2025 04:34:47
pm ) W.P.(MD)Nos.126 to 135 and 447 to 456 of 2025 on the grounds of faculty position and
absence of Essentiality Certificate. Both the learned Senior Counsels heavily relied upon the official
communication dated 21.11.2024, between the second respondent and the first respondent in which
it has been intimated to the first respondent that the NMC has decided to keep in abeyance the
requirement of the Essentiality Certificate for starting of new medical PG courses for the academic
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131749895/ 12
M/S.Srinivasan Medical College And ... vs Union Of India on 24 December, 2024
year 2024-2025.
34.Thus, the two issues arising for consideration in the instant lis is as follows:-
“(1)Whether the petitioner can claim benefit of the exemption letter dated 21.11.2024,
in respect of Essentiality Certificate ?
(2)Whether the faculty strength of the petitioner College met the requirements of the
NMC regulations ?”
35.The notice inviting application for the commencement of PG medical courses for the academic
year 2024-2025 was issued on 16.08.2023. On 15.09.2023, the applications for 21 PG courses was
submitted by the College separately. After initial scrutiny on identifying certain deficiencies, the
show cause notice was issued by the third respondent to the petitioner College on 28.03.2024. The
show cause notice in serial no.2 specified that the Essentiality Certificate is inadequate and in serial
no.5 specifically mentioned that data for AEBAS https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on:
20/05/2025 04:34:47 pm ) W.P.(MD)Nos.126 to 135 and 447 to 456 of 2025 is liable to be
considered for the period 01.01.2024 to 29.02.2024 and for such period, the attendance of the
faculty should be at least 75 percentage and in paragraph no.2 of the show cause notice it is specified
that the compliance report is to be submitted by the College within 10 days of the show cause notice.
36.It is only after this on 30.03.2024, the petitioner College applied seeking Essentiality Certificate
to the State Government and that makes it clear that only after 6 months from the date of
submission of the application form, the petitioner medical College had applied for an Essentiality
Certificate to the Tamil Nadu State Government. In such request letter, it is admitted by the
petitioner medical College in paragraph no.2 that during the academic year 2021- 2023, their
Essentiality Certificate had expired and they further confirmed that the Essentiality Certificate is
required for submission to the second respondent because the petitioner had applied for the various
Post Graduate departments.
37.In the meanwhile, the letter of disapproval dated 13.06.2024, issued by the third respondent
pointed out the same deficiencies cited in the show cause notice and the petitioner College without
raising any demur or protest preferred a first appeal on 04.07.2024 before the second respondent.
More particularly, with respect to the remark of the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded
on: 20/05/2025 04:34:47 pm ) W.P.(MD)Nos.126 to 135 and 447 to 456 of 2025 experts regarding
non-availability of Essentiality Certificate, the writ petitioner College had duly responded that the
Essentiality Certificate was awaited and that they had applied for it, without raising any protest or
question regarding the requirement to produce the Essentiality Certificate.
38.Since it was admitted by the writ petitioner College itself that there is no Essentiality Certificate
and the same is awaited and since the writ petitioner College was not able to provide any probable
explanation for the inadequate faculties during the period 1st January 2024 to 29th February 2024,
left with no other option the first appellate authority, that is, the second respondent confirmed the
order of the third respondent, by rejecting the first appeal on 05.08.2024. In the meanwhile, on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131749895/ 13
M/S.Srinivasan Medical College And ... vs Union Of India on 24 December, 2024
10.09.2024, the petitioner College managed to obtain Essentiality Certificate.
39.Though the second appeal was preferred by the petitioner College enclosing the Essentiality
Certificate on 12.09.2024, since no attempt was made by the petitioner College to satisfy the second
appellate authority, that is, the first respondent with respect to the faculty deficiency, on 04.11.2024,
vide letter bearing No.V. 11013/14/2019-ME-1 (FTS 8290596), the first respondent invited a
Powerpoint Presentation for submission from the petitioner College to
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 20/05/2025 04:34:47 pm ) W.P.(MD)Nos.126 to
135 and 447 to 456 of 2025 present the case of the said College vis-a-vis the disapproval letter of the
NMC, that is, the second respondent, along with the requisite information on 07.11.2024 at 10.30
a.m. However, the AEBAS data submitted by the petitioner College was for a period of their own
choice and not for the relevant period of 1st January 2024 to 29th February 2024.
40.In the meanwhile on 21.11.2024, a letter from the second respondent to the Central Government,
that is, the first respondent clarified that the requirement to submit an Essentiality Certificate has
been kept in abeyance for the academic year 2024-2025 subject to the availability of clinical
material and faculty. Claiming the benefit of the aforesaid letter, the entire narration and argument
of the petitioner College has been put forth by the learned Senior Counsels before me. Section 2 (f)
of the Establishment of Medical Institutions, Assessment and Rating Regulations, 2023, define the
term “Essentiality Certificate” as follows:-
“Essentiality Certificate”(in its abbreviated form EC) shall mean written permission
from the central or concerned state government or the Union Territory
administration as the case may be for the establishment of a new medical
institution.”
41.Further Section 9(a) of the aforesaid Regulations, 2023, makes it clear that no application
submitted by the eligible entity shall be entertained unless it is accompanied with Essentiality
Certificate issued https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 20/05/2025 04:34:47 pm )
W.P.(MD)Nos.126 to 135 and 447 to 456 of 2025 by the concerned State Government or Union
Territory administration or the appropriate authority as the case may be unless otherwise specified
and that the Essentiality Certificate shall be valid at the time of application.
42.However, it is the admitted case of the petitioner Medical College herein that at the time of
making application they did not possess a valid Essentiality Certificate. It is the categorical
contention of the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner medical college that the
second respondent NMC had stood satisfied with the attendance/availability of the requisite faculty
and had restricted the disapproval on the imaginary and unavailable illegal ground of non-
submission of Essentiality Certificate and that the petitioner College had become entitled for grant
of letter of permission for the various PG medical disciplines at the stage of the first appeal itself.
43.However, I am of the considered view that the communication made by the second respondent
NMC to the first respondent vide file dated 21.11.2024, is with respect to the decision to keep in
abeyance the requirement of the Essentiality Certificate for starting of new PG medical courses for
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131749895/ 14
M/S.Srinivasan Medical College And ... vs Union Of India on 24 December, 2024
the academic year 2024 – 2025, subject to the availability of clinical material and faculties as per
regulations and norms of NMC. However, in the instant case, the show cause notice issued by the
third https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 20/05/2025 04:34:47 pm )
W.P.(MD)Nos.126 to 135 and 447 to 456 of 2025 respondent dated 28.03.2024, itself had made
clear that the data for AEBAS attendance for the period 01.01.2024 to 29.02.2024 with respect to
the attendance of faculty should be at least 75 percent, which would precisely indicate the
non-availability of faculty.
44.Without proceeding to submit the compliance report in terms of the aforesaid show cause notice
dated 28.03.2024, within 10 days of the show cause notice, the writ petitioner College proceeded to
prefer a first appeal after the issuance of letter of disapproval by the third respondent on
13.06.2024. It is only on 04.07.2024, the first appeal was preferred by the petitioner College before
the second respondent, that too, without complying the deficiencies pointed out in the show cause
notice by submitting the relevant attendance data for the period from 01.01.2024 to 29.02.2024, but
by submitting for a period of their own choice. For better clarity, the relevant period of the choice of
the petitioner college for seeking grant of letter of approval as submitted in their affidavit and the
impugned orders in all the 20 cases are extracted herein:-

45.A careful perusal of the extracted details itself would show that, even if the details sought for, by
the issuance of show cause notice dated 28.03.2024, was with respect to the period from 1 st
January 2024 to 29th February 2024 and the period relied upon by the writ petitioner College is
from 01.04.2024 to 30.12.2024 without disclosing the details from 01.03.2024 to 31.03.2024, since
the same will not fulfill the faculty requirements as per PG Medical Education Regulations, 2000,
and UG Medical Education Regulations. As far as the dispensation of the production of Essentiality
Certificate as claimed by the petitioner College, the relevant communication dated 21.11.2024,

46.A careful perusal of the same would make it clear that dispensation of Essentiality
Certificate for starting of new medical PG courses for the academic year 2024-2025
would be available for those institutions which possess proper clinical material and
faculties as per the regulations and norms of NMC. However, in the instant case in
the absence of faculties as per the regulations and norms of NMC, the dispensation of
Essentiality Certificate could not be claimed by the petitioner College as a matter of
right. That apart, the third respondent on receipt of applications for the post
graduation courses - broad and super speciality courses for the academic year
2024-2025, in response to its public notice dated 16.08.2023, could process the same
only as mandated by the Regulations of NMC. For better appreciation, the
application process flow chart is derived as follows:-

47.In the instant case, on receipt of application form from the petitioner college after
initial scrutiny on identifying the deficiencies, a show cause notice dated 28.03.2024
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131749895/ 17
M/S.Srinivasan Medical College And ... vs Union Of India on 24 December, 2024
was issued to the petitioner College requiring to submit a compliance report in terms
of the show cause notice within 10 days from the date of show cause notice. Had the
petitioner college duly filed a compliance report within 10 days as required in the first
show cause notice with a self assessment form the issues would have been properly
resolved at that stage itself. However, since a compliance report was not submitted by
the petitioner College, the third respondent was left with no other option rather to
proceed forward to consider the AEBAS data for attendance of the faculty and
thereafter on the basis of the scrutinization and evaluation report received from the
expert group in this regard, a final scrutiny was also made and on the basis of which,
a letter of disapproval was issued by the third respondent on 13.06.2024.
48.Though the second appeal was filed by the petitioner College on 12.09.2024,
enclosing the incumbent certificate, no attempt to satisfy the second appellate
authority with respect to faculty deficiency was diligently taken by the petitioner
College. The concept of AEBAS is Aadhaar Enabled Biometric Attendance System. It
is a real-time attendance monitoring system developed by the Indian government to
improve the productivity of Government employees. AEBAS uses the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 20/05/2025 04:34:47 pm )
W.P.(MD)Nos.126 to 135 and 447 to 456 of 2025 Aadhaar number, which is used by
the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), to authenticate the attendance
of employees. It offers two modes of authentication through fingerprint and through
Aadhaar. That was in 2022 that it was mandated for recording faculty attendance in
all medical colleges throughout India using AEBAS. Such e-tracking system was
introduced to weed out malpractices by Colleges, shortcomings in the earlier physical
inspection system and for greater coordinated monitoring by the regulator.
49.By this, the shortfall in attendance is duly noted by the second respondent and
inadequacy of faculty come to light. Admittedly, at the relevant time for which the
data had to be submitted by the petitioner College along with their application form
that is during the period from 1st January 2024 to 29th February 2024, there was a
shortfall. Such shortfall is claimed to have been cured only from April 2024, leaving
out the month of March 2024. However, the same is also found incorrect from the
admitted data filed by the petitioner College before this Court as extracted supra in
paragraph no.42. The shortfall of faculty has been consistent.
50.The reason put forth by the Senior Counsels appearing for the petitioner College
for the lack of attendance is on account of the Pongal holidays. As for the lack of
attendance being allegedly on account of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis (
Uploaded on: 20/05/2025 04:34:47 pm ) W.P.(MD)Nos.126 to 135 and 447 to 456 of
2025 Pongal holidays, such a plea is unacceptable because the AEBAS system itself
automatically adjusts and recalibrates, based on actual working days and 75
percentage attendance is reckoned in relation to the actual working days only. The
computation in the system automatically excludes holidays and therefore, holidays
have no bearing on attendance. In any event, Pongal holidays in the month of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131749895/ 18
M/S.Srinivasan Medical College And ... vs Union Of India on 24 December, 2024
January 2024 was only for three days.
51.Admittedly, the compliance data submitted by the petitioner College is only from
April 2024, while submitting the first appeal and there is no explanation for the
period from February 2024 to April 2024.
For this reason also, the lack of faculty in the petitioner College is an important reason for
disapproval of permission. The complete data regarding the application status of the petitioner
College as on the date of filing this petition is placed before me by the respondents 2 and 3 and the
same is extracted as follows:-

52.This Court is of the considered view that the first appellate authority was not required to once
again go into the question of adequacy of faculty strength because the only issue before the first
appellate authority was whether the Essentiality Certificate had to be awaited when lack of faculty
had not been satisfactorily complied at all. The compliance form dated 05.04.2024, submitted by
the College was admittedly silent on showing compliance in respect of inadequacy of faculty. Such
compliance form harped only on Essentiality Certificate. Since compliance/rectification is a one
time measure to be effected by the College after receipt of a show cause notice, the third respondent
is required only to ascertain whether all deficiencies pointed out have been complied. In the absence
of such compliance, rejection is natural.
53.The first appellate authority passed an order dated 05.08.2024 and even by then, the Essentiality
Certificate had never been produced by the petitioner medical College. This is without prejudice to
the fact that rectification/compliance was an opportunity to be availed within 10

135 and 447 to 456 of 2025 days of the show cause notice. This left the first appellate authority, that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131749895/ 21
M/S.Srinivasan Medical College And ... vs Union Of India on 24 December, 2024
is, the second respondent with no material for reconsideration and it is pertinent to state that the
petitioner College itself never questioned the requirement of the respondents 2 and 3 in seeking an
Essentiality Certificate.
54.On the other hand, the petitioner College clearly stated that an Essentiality Certificate had been
applied for and the same was awaited. There was no demur or protest to the requirement of
producing an Essentiality Certificate and this Court has no hesitation to observe that all the
contentions of dispensing with the production of Essentiality Certificate put forth by the learned
Senior Counsels, who have appeared for the petitioner College are a sheer afterthought. In fact, the
petitioner College attached a copy of application made by them to the State Government requesting
for issuance of the Essentiality Certificate along with the first appeal. Therefore, all the loud
objections made before this Court seeking dispensation of Essentiality Certificate are vexatious and
the sheer afterthought cannot be countenanced.
55.The petitioner college has not shown compliance in accordance with law, which alone would
entitle the petitioner to receive a letter of permission. Instead the entire Writ Petition is oriented
only to cast aspirations on the second and third respondents. The oblique motives in
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 20/05/2025 04:34:47 pm ) W.P.(MD)Nos.126 to
135 and 447 to 456 of 2025 attacking the respondents 1, 2 and 3 shows the lack of bona fides of the
petitioner College.
56.Section 26(1)(a) of the NMC Act, 2019, confers power on the third respondent/MARB to
determine the procedure for assessing and rating medical institutions for their compliance with
standards laid down by the Undergraduate Medical Education Board or the Post Graduate Medical
Education Board. Further, as per Section 26(1)(b), it is the MARB/third respondent, which has to
grant permission for starting new post graduate courses. Section 23(3) proviso states that before
disapproving any scheme, “an opportunity to rectify defects shall be given to the persons
concerned”. Also Section 29 of the NMC Act, 2019, laid down the criteria for
approving/disapproving the scheme submitted by a college for starting a new course/institution.
Such criteria includes availability of adequate academic faculty. There is no discretion vested in the
NMC to relax academic faculty requirement. Discretionary power itself is vested only with the
Central Government in the circumstances set out under Section 29 of the National Medical
Commission Act, 2019.
57.The applications made by the petitioner College is seeking grant of permission for
commencement of 21 Post Graduation courses - broad and super specialities courses for the
academic year 2024 - 2025. I am of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 20/05/2025
04:34:47 pm ) W.P.(MD)Nos.126 to 135 and 447 to 456 of 2025 the considered view that the faculty
position, which is to be considered on such applications are with respect to those months prior to
when the college applied for enhancement of seats. However, in the instant case though the
application was submitted by the College on 15.09.2023, the show cause notice issued 28.03.2024,
made it clear that the data for AEBAS for the period 01.01.2024 to 29.02.2024 would be relevant to
be considered for the purpose of attendance of faculty.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131749895/ 22
M/S.Srinivasan Medical College And ... vs Union Of India on 24 December, 2024
58.However, without filing a compliance report before the third respondent, the petitioner College
after issuance of letter of disapproval on 13.06.2024 preferred a first appeal before the second
respondent on 04.07.2024 by submitting the data of AEBAS for a period of its own choice, that is,
from the month of April 2024 to December 2024. Even the said data miserably trails to fulfill the
mandates as required for iterating the position of attendance of faculty during that period of time. I
am of the considered view that subsequent appointing of faculty/residents could not be of any avail
for the purpose of application filed previously.
59.The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Manohar Lal Sharma v. Medical Council of India and
Others2, has held as follows:-
“25. ......... A compliance report is called for only to ascertain whether the deficiencies
pointed out were rectified or 2 2013 10 SCC 60 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis (
Uploaded on: 20/05/2025 04:34:47 pm ) W.P.(MD)Nos.126 to 135 and 447 to 456 of
2025 not. If MCI is not satisfied with the manner of compliance, it can conduct a
surprise inspection. After that, no further time or opportunity to rectify the
deficiencies is contemplated, no further opportunity of being heard is provided.”
60.Fully fortified by the aforesaid judgment, I am of the considered view that the compliance report
dated 05.04.2024, ought to have been submitted by the petitioner medical College with a valid EC
and proper faculty who are functional during the period for which AEBAS data was considered, that
is, the period from 1st January 2024 to 29th February 2024. However, having not done the same,
even in the compliance report, the submission of the petitioner College is that they have applied for
Essentiality Certificate to the Government of Tamil Nadu and the same is awaited. Only on receipt of
such compliance report, the letter of disapproval dated 13.06.2024 was issued by the third
respondent.
61.The pertinent point to be mentioned at this juncture is that, the entire compliance exercise was a
one-time opportunity offered by the third respondent and no further time or opportunity to rectify
deficiencies was contemplated or required in terms of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court
extracted supra as well as in terms of the proviso to Section 28 of the NMC Act, 2019. Needless to
state that in the instant case as on the date of scrutiny of the application form, there was a clear
deficiency of non-submission of Essentiality Certificate and https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis (
Uploaded on: 20/05/2025 04:34:47 pm ) W.P.(MD)Nos.126 to 135 and 447 to 456 of 2025
deficiency in proper faculty who were functional during the period for which AEBAS data was
considered. In addition to the same, this Court is of the considered view that, as expected by the
petitioner, the respondents cannot keep on the scrutiny process by keeping the same in indefinite
abeyance so as to facilitate the petitioner College to submit the proper faculty details as well as
Essentiality Certificate and the process of consideration of application for commencement of new
PG courses is a time bound process.
62.The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Medical Council of India versus Kalinga Institute of
Medical Sciences and others3, has held as follows:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131749895/ 23
M/S.Srinivasan Medical College And ... vs Union Of India on 24 December, 2024
“21. A perusal of the decision of the High Court clearly indicates that it considered the
latest report of the Inspection Team as if it was hearing an appeal against the report.
In doing so, the High Court went into great details on issues relating to the number of
teaching beds in the hospital, the limitations in the OPD Department, the number of
units available in the subjects of General Medicine, Pediatrics etc., bed occupancy,
number of Caesarean sections, discrepancy in data of major and minor operations,
computerization in the institution, number of patients in the ICU, number of static
X-ray machines, deficiency of examination halls, lecture theatres, library, students
hostel, interns hostel, playground etc. etc. Surely, this was not within the domain of
the High Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution.
3(2016) 11 SCC 530 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 20/05/2025
04:34:47 pm ) W.P.(MD)Nos.126 to 135 and 447 to 456 of 2025
22. The High Court did not appreciate that the inspection was carried out by eminent
Professors from reputed medical institutions who were experts in the field and the
best persons to give an unbiased report on the facilities in KIMS. The High Court
under Article 226 of the Constitution was certainly not tasked to minutely examine
the contents of the inspection report and weigh them against the objections of KIMS
in respect of each of its 18 items. In our opinion, the High Court plainly exceeded its
jurisdiction in this regard in venturing into seriously disputed factual issues.
23. Learned counsels for KIMS and the students submitted that the High Court was
left with no option but to critically examine the report of the Inspection Team since it
was factually erroneous and did not deserve to be relied on either for the increase in
intake of seats for the academic year 2015-16 or the academic year 2016-17. We see
no reason to accept the submission of learned counsels.
24. Medical education must be taken very seriously and when an expert body certifies
that the facilities in a medical college are inadequate, the Courts are not equipped to
take a different view in the matter except for very cogent jurisdictional reasons such
as mala fides of the Inspection Team, ex facie perversity in the inspection report,
jurisdictional error on the part of the MCI etc. Under no circumstance should the
High Court examine the report as an appellate body – this is simply not the function
of the High Court. In the present case there was no ground made out at law for
setting aside the report of the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on:
20/05/2025 04:34:47 pm ) W.P.(MD)Nos.126 to 135 and 447 to 456 of 2025
Inspection Team.
25. The High Court was of opinion that the Inspection Team was required to conduct
the inspection with reference to the academic year 2015-16 but the report pertains to
the academic year 2016-2017. If that was so, the High Court could have passed an
appropriate order in this regard rather than examine and scrutinize the inspection
report prepared for the academic year 2016-17 which academic year was not at all the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131749895/ 24
M/S.Srinivasan Medical College And ... vs Union Of India on 24 December, 2024
subject matter of consideration or discussion before it. Moreover, invalidation of the
inspection report for the academic year 2016-17 would not automatically invalidate
the inspection report for the academic year 2015-16. Unfortunately, the High Court
spent its energy on adjudicating a non-issue.
26. It appears to us that both the MCI and the Central Government each having twice
considered the inspection report submitted by neutral medical Professors, with the
Central Government having given a personal hearing to KIMS on the second occasion
(and perhaps on the first occasion as well) the matter ought to have been given a
quietus by the High Court at least for the academic year 2015-16.
27. That apart, we are of opinion that the High Court ought to have been more
circumspect in directing the admission of students by its order dated 25th September
2015. There was no need for the High Court to rush into an area that the MCI feared
to tread. Granting admission to students in an educational institution when there is a
serious doubt whether admission should at all be granted is not a matter to be taken
lightly. First of all the career of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on:
20/05/2025 04:34:47 pm ) W.P.(MD)Nos.126 to 135 and 447 to 456 of 2025 a
student is involved – what would a student do if his admission is found to be illegal or
is quashed? Is it not a huge waste of time for him or her? Is it enough to say that the
student will not claim any equity in his or her favour? Is it enough for student to be
told that his or her admission is subject to the outcome of a pending litigation? These
are all questions that arise and for which there is no easy answer. Generally speaking,
it is better to err on the side of caution and deny admission to a student rather than
have the sword of Damocles hanging over him or her. There would at least be some
certainty.”
63.When the writ petitioner College is not able to satisfy the mandates as to the required number of
faculties for each and every PG speciality, for which the petitioner College has made application in
the backdrop of the letter of the second respondent to the first respondent dated 27.11.2024, the
petitioner College cannot claim dispensation of Essentiality Certificate. The petitioner medical
College was commenced only during the academic year 2021- 2022. It is pertinent to state that the
first batch of students of the petitioner College are yet to complete education and the College itself is
of nascent origin only from 2021- 2022. Under such circumstances, this Court cannot sing to the
tunes of the writ petitioner College, who are in a rush to get a positive order from this Court for the
purpose of directing the respondents herein to dispense with the production of Essentiality
Certificate in the absence of adequate faculty strength for the required period for which AEBAS
attendance is https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 20/05/2025 04:34:47 pm )

respondent in the second appeal filed by the writ petitioner College as far as the application related
to the PG course MD community medicine seeking 8 seats in which by order dated 08.01.2025, the
petitioner college being granted with the permission to commence the PG course MD community
medicine with three seats for the academic year 2024-2025, instead of 8 seats would itself prove the
bona-fides of the respondents and for better clarity, the same are extracted here under:-

65.In the said circumstances, the petitioner College cannot succeed in attributing ill
will/vindictiveness/malafide towards the respondents and the said exercise itself would stand as a
proof that the respondents have duly considered the relevant AEBAS data for the period 01.01.2024
to 29.02.2024 and not the period of 01.04.2024 to 31.12.2024, which was later furnished by the
petitioner College as far as the other applications for which the petitioner College has knocked the
doors of this Court before me in the instant lis in hand.
66.Accordingly, I have no hesitation to hold that the respondents have duly considered the
application made by the petitioner College, seeking permission to commence new Post Graduation
courses - broad and super speciality courses for the academic year 2024 - 2025 as far as 23
disciplines are concerned and have granted appropriate permission for two disciplines and has
rejected the case of all the other applications, for which the writ petitioner College has come before
this Court only for the proper deficiencies, which was not duly rectified by the petitioner College, by
availing the one time opportunity offered by the third respondent to rectify the same, by submission
of proper compliance report as pointed out by the third respondent and thereafter, filing a first
appeal or a second appeal before the second and first respondents respectively by submitting AEBAS
attendance records pertaining to https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 20/05/2025
04:34:47 pm ) W.P.(MD)Nos.126 to 135 and 447 to 456 of 2025 another period of their own choice,
rather the period for which was sought for by the authorities, would also not rescue the case of the
petitioners.
