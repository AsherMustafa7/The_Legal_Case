Sections 498-A, 323, 504 of IPC by the applicant-Arif Khan, however, the connected application has

4. In the connected application, on 02.08.2018, the following orders were passed:
"Heard Sri Om Prakash, learned counsel for the applicants and Sri Gaurav Pratap
Singh, learned brief holding for the State.
This application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. has been filed for quashing the
proceedings of Complaint Case No.549 of 2017 (Smt. Majda Khatoon Vs. Arif and
others), under Sections 498-A, 323, 504, I.P.C., police station Rath, District
Hamirpur, pending before the Judicial Magistrate, Rath, District Hamirpur as well as
summoning order dated 04.06.2018.
The marriage between applicant no.1 and the daughter of opposite party no.2 was
solemnized 12 years back.
After having very carefully examined, the submissions made by the learned counsel
for the applicants and perused the material brought on record, I find that applicant
no.1 is concerned, there is no justification for quashing the prosecution of the
aforementioned case.
The prayer to that extent on behalf of applicant nos.1, namely, Arif Khan is hereby
refused.
So far as applicant nos. 2 to 6 are concerned, it has been contended by learned
counsel for the applicants that they are the family members of applicant no.1 and the
allegation levelled against them are wholly vague and no specific allegation has been
levelled against them. Learned counsel for the applicants has placed reliance on the
judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Geeta Mehrotra Vs. State of U.P. and
others reported in 2012 (10) ADJ 464.
Notice on behalf of opposite party no. 1 has been accepted by learned A.G.A.
Issue notice to opposite party no.2 returnable within four weeks at the address given
in the application.

5. On the matter being compromised between the parties, Arif Khan who had earlier preferred the

settled their all disputes and differences in order to maintain harmonious and cordial
relations between them and now, they do not have any grievance against each other.
