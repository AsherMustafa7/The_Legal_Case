[3] The applicant/petitioner married respondent No. 1 on 02.12.2004 and they had 2 (two)
daughters, who are respondent Nos. 2 & 3 respectively. Due to family dispute, respondent No. 1
approached Ld. Judicial Magistrate First Class, Aizawl, Mizoram by way of Criminal Complaint No.
186 of 2012 praying for payment of maintenance and vide order dated 19.03.2013, the Ld. Judicial
Magistrate First Class, Aizawl allowed the Criminal Complaint by directing the petitioner to pay Rs.
1,500/- (Rupees one thousand five hundred) each to his minor daughters i.e. respondent Nos. 2 & 3
and to respondent No. 1 (altogether Rs. 4,000/-
MC(Cril.Revn.Petn.) No. 9 of 2019 with Cril.Revn.Petn. No. 25 of 2019 Page 3 as maintenance
allowance). Thereafter, the applicant/petitioner filed an application being Application No. 81 of
2015 before the Ld. Senior Civil Judge, Mamit District, Mizoram praying for issuing a Divorce
Certificate and vide order dated 25.03.2015 the Ld. Senior Civil Judge, Mamit District, Mizoram
allowed the Application No. 81 of 2015.
[4] Thereafter, the O.Ps./respondents filed a Cril. Misc. Application No. 4 of 2015 before the Ld.
Family Court, Churachandpur, Manipur for enhancement of the monthly maintenance allowance
which was passed in Criminal Complaint No. 186 of 2012 and on 28.10.2016, the Ld. Family Court,
Churachandpur passed an impugned order directing the petitioner to pay the enhance maintenance
allowance. [5] After receiving the impugned order dated 28.10.2016, the applicant/petitioner
searched for an Advocate from Manipur and had taken some time and finally he found an advocate.
Thereafter, the counsel advised to obtain the necessary documents from the Ld. Judicial Magistrate
First Class, Aizawl, Mizoram and he had taken 2 (two) months for obtaining necessary documents.
The petitioner's counsel took some time to prepare the case and waited for 45 days for call and she
had taken some time for obtaining all case records of the Churachandpur Court.
[6] Due to long communication gap between the applicant/petitioner and his counsel and no
progress was made in his case, he decided to engage new counsel. Finally, he found a new counsel
and the new counsel advised him to obtained fresh certified copy of all MC(Cril.Revn.Petn.) No. 9 of
2019 with Cril.Revn.Petn. No. 25 of 2019 Page 4 necessary documents from Mizoram. As such, there
is delay of 940 days on the part of the applicant/petitioner in filing Cril. Revision Petition. It is
prayed that delay of 940 days be condoned.
[7] The respondents filed affidavit-in-opposition wherein it is stated that the revision petition along
with the condonation application were filed after 3 (three) months and no cause is shown as to why
the revision petitioner along with condonation application were filed after 3 (three) months. It is
stated that delay of 940 days in preferring a revision petition is inordinate in nature and no
sufficient cause is shown except mere allegation against one Grace, advocate, for not preferring the
revision petition within the period prescribed by law. Under Article 131 of the Limitation Act, 1963,
the period of limitation for preferring a revision petition is 90 days from the date of order sought to
be revised. Due to the petitioner's negligence, inaction and want of bonafide, he could not prefer the
revision petition well within time prescribed by law. It is stated that sufficient cause as used in
Section 5 of the Limitation Act means a cause beyond the control of the party invoking the said of
the Section. The cause of delay as set forth by the petitioner in his condonation application could
have been avoided if he exercised due care and attention thereof. It is stated that there is no material

to show that the petitioner had appointed any counsel in connection with his case before the Ld.
Family Court, Churachandpur and there is no material to show that the petitioner taken action
against the said advocate for misconduct or otherwise. The petitioner fails to show a due sufficient
cause for the whole of the delay MC(Cril.Revn.Petn.) No. 9 of 2019 with Cril.Revn.Petn. No. 25 of
2019 Page 5 covered by the period between the last day prescribed for filing the revision and the day
on which the revision is filed. It is prayed that the present application be rejected.
[8] The applicant/petitioner filed rejoinder affidavit to the affidavit- in-opposition filed by the
respondents where it is stated that the Ld. Family Court, Churachandpur, Manipur without having
any jurisdiction to take up the matter passed the impugned order dated 28.10.2016 whereby
directing the applicant/petitioner to pay the enhanced maintenance allowance per month to the
respondents. When the impugned order was passed, the applicant/petitioner engaged a lawyer but a
fruitful action could not be taken up and hence, there is no negligence from the part of the
petitioner. It is also stated that the applicant/petitioner has acted diligently and sufficient case has
been explained showing reasons which prevented him from preferring the Cril. Revision Petitioner
during the period of limitation prescribed in the condonation application so as to advance for
substantial justice. It is prayed that the present application may be allowed and the delay of 940
days caused in filing the present Cril. Revision Petitioner be condoned.
[9] Mr. Ajoy Pebam, learned counsel for the applicant submits that the delay is filing the
accompanying petition has been explained and the same has been caused due to facts narrated as
above. He further explains that since the impugned order is passed by a court without any
jurisdiction, the same can be challenged at any time. It is also stated that MC(Cril.Revn.Petn.) No. 9
of 2019 with Cril.Revn.Petn. No. 25 of 2019 Page 6 when serious question of jurisdiction is raised,
court ought to have taken a liberal view. Learned counsel for the applicant refers to the decision in
the case of Prahlad Raut v. All India Institute of Medical Science: 2019 Legal Eagle (SC) 936 @ Para
22 to the point that illegal and void ab initio order can be challenged at any time. Reliance is also
placed on the decision of Divisional Manager, Plantation Division, Andaman & Nicobar Islands v.
Munnu Barrick: (2005) 2 SCC 237 @ Para 23 to emphasise that where serious questions of law were
raised, the court should have taken a liberal view on the application of the condonation. Learned
counsel for the applicant further cites the case of Rajnesh v. Neha: (2021) 2 SCC 324 @ Para 128.3
holding that modification of order passed in previous proceeding can be done in the same
proceeding. It is prayed that the delay so caused be condoned and the main petition be heard on
merit.
[10] Mr. S. Chitaranjan, learned counsel for the respondents submits that no proper explanation has
been given by the applicant for condoning 940 days of inordinate delay in filing the accompanying
revision petition. It is stated that except for blaming on some counsel, sufficient cause has bot been
given for not preferring the revision on time. It is pointed out that the delay so caused is due to the
gross negligence on the part of the applicant. It is clarified that the Family Court at Churachandpur,
Manipur has jurisdiction to entertain the application filed by the respondents and case laws cited by
the applicants are not applicable in the MC(Cril.Revn.Petn.) No. 9 of 2019 with Cril.Revn.Petn. No.
25 of 2019 Page 7 facts of the present case. It is prayed that the application for condonation be
rejected with cost.

[11] This Court has considered the material on record, the submissions made at bar and relevant
case laws. In the present case, the delay of 940 days is somewhat long and the applicant tries to
explain the same to some extent. However, the fact of litigations in States has to be taken into
account. Moreover, the important question of law, ie, competency of a court in Manipur to
enhance/modify the maintenance awarded by a court in Mizoram, is involved in the present case. In
the circumstances, this Court is inclined to hear the main petition on merit, as the question of
jurisdiction and competency of the court has arisen. Accordingly, the delay of 940 days in filing the
accompanying petition against the impugned order dated 28.10.2016 passed by learned Family
Court at Churachandpur, Manipur in Cril. Misc. Application No. 4 of 2015 is condoned, subject to
payment of Rs.2000/- in favour of the respondents. The application is allowed and disposed of.
