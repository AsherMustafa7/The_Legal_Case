3. The prosecution story, in brief, is that respondent
no. 2/ informant submitted his written statement before the SHO
of Sahiyara Police Station, Sitamarhi stating therein that on
15.06.2023
at 7:00 PM, appellant no. 1, who was neighbor of informant, was repairing the house upon which
case is going on and when the same was objected by the informant due to pending litigation, the
appellants and other armed with lathi, danda and sword, started abusing the informant by calling
his caste name. It is alleged that appellant no. 2 assaulted the informant upon his head by means of
sword as a result of which blood started oozing out. Thereafter, other family members of the
informant came and tried to pacify the dispute but all the accused persons started pelting stones
upon the informant and his family members. It is alleged that they also damaged some articles of
informant's house and appellant no. 1 took out Rs. 10,000/- from box. Thereafter, police arrived at
the place of occurrence and informant was taken to the hospital.
4. On the basis of said written statement, Sahiyara P.S. Case No. 107 of 2023 has been registered for
the offences punishable under Sections 341, 323, 324, 307, 337, 448, 427, 379, 504, 34 of the IPC
and Section 3(i)(r)(s) of SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

5. Learned counsel for the appellants submits that in the background of land dispute, the false case
has been instituted against the appellants. He further submits that there is case and counter case
between the parties on the same date of occurrence and the case of appellants is prior to the case
filed by the informant of the present case. In the light of the facts and circumstances of the case, no
offence of SC/ST is made out against the appellants as Title Suit no. 33 of 2017 (Annexure 2) is also
pending since 2017 before the Sub Judge - I, Sitamarhi. He further submits that the present case has
been lodged by the informant just to misuse the privilege of SC/ST Act. He further submitted that
investigation conducted by the police is faulty and charge sheet has been submitted under the
provision of SC/ST Act just to implicate the appellants. Learned counsel for the appellants submits
that investigating officer, after completion of investigation, submitted charge sheet under Sections
341, 323, 337, 448, 427, 504 and 34 of IPC and Section 3(i)(r)(s) of the SC/ST (POA) Act and
without application of judicial mind, the learned trial court has taken cognizance against the
appellants under the said sections. In the light of aforesaid fact, order passed by the concerned court
is not justified and legal and same is fit to be set aside. Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.4621 of

6. Learned Special Public Prosecutor for the State submits that appellants and informant are
neighbor and appellants are well aware of the fact as to which caste informant and his family
members belong to. He further submits that as per prosecution case, the appellants and other armed
with lathi, danda and sword started abusing the informant by calling his caste name. He further
submits that appellant no. 2 assaulted the informant upon his head by means of sword as a result of
which blood started oozing out and appellant no. 1 took out Rs. 10,000/- from the box of
informant's house. He further submits that the FIR clearly indicates that the occurrence had taken
place at the disputed land where repairing of house was going on and other persons were also
present at the place of occurrence which attracts the mandate of SC/ST Act. He further submits that
there is allegation against the appellants and other that they abused the informant by calling his
caste name and appellant no. 2 also assaulted the informant. He further submits that the accusation
as alleged in the FIR clearly reflects that occurrence took place in public gaze and hence, contention
of learned counsel for the appellants is neither tenable nor sustainable in the light of the accusation
made in FIR. He further submits that FIR has been lodged under Sections Sections 341, 323, 324,
307, 337, 448, Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.4621 of 2023 dt.14-10-2025 427, 379, 504, 34 of
the IPC and Section 3(i)(r)(s) of SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. Learned counsels further
submits that the investigating officer has conducted investigation on all points as alleged in the FIR
and after completion of investigation submitted charge sheet under Sections 341, 323, 337, 448,
427, 504 and 34 of IPC and Section 3(i)(r)(s) of the SC/ST (POA) Act. He further submits that the
learned trial court has found that sufficient material is available against the appellants and
concerned court took cognizance against the appellants under Sections 341, 323, 337, 448, 427,
504/34 of IPC and Section 3(1)(r)(s) of SC/ST (POA) Act on the basis of, prima facie, material
available on record. In this way, the trial court has applied its judicial mind and after going through
all the material available on record, the court has passed the reasoned order and hence, no
interference is needed.
7. After hearing the parties concerned as well as material available on record, it is crystal clear that
contention of appellants' counsel is neither tenable nor sustainable in the light of verbatim of the
informant, who has specifically stated that appellants are said to have used abusive language
indicating caste name. The contention of learned counsel for the State is quite relevant as per
accusation made in the FIR. The Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.4621 of 2023 dt.14-10-2025
Investigating Officer has conducted investigation on all points and after completion of investigation
submitted charge sheet under Sections 341, 323, 337, 448, 427, 504 and 34 of IPC and Section
3(i)(r)(s) of the SC/ST (POA) Act.
8. It is necessary to cite decision rendered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Sonu Gupta
vs. Deepak Gupta and Others reported in (2015) 3 SCC 424 in which at para 8 it has been held as
follows:-
'8. At the stage of cognizance and summoning the Magistrate is required to apply his
judicial mind only with a view to take cognizance of the offence, or, in other words, to
find out whether a prima facie case has been made out for summoning the accused
persons. At this stage, the learned Magistrate is not required to consider the defence
version or materials or arguments nor is he required to evaluate the merits of the

Bhikhari Shekh vs The State Of Bihar on 14 October, 2025
materials or evidence of the complainant, because the Magistrate must not undertake
the exercise to find out at this stage whether the materials will lead to conviction or
not.'
9. From perusal of the order dated 24.08.2023 passed by Ist Additional Sessions Judge -cum-
Special Judge, SC/ST (POA) Act, Sitamarhi in connection with Sahiyara P.S. Case No. 107 of 2023, it
appears that the order has been passed upon due consideration of the case diary and charge-sheet
coupled with material available on record.
10. Considering the facts and circumstances of the Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.4621 of 2023
dt.14-10-2025 case and also that a prima facie case has been found against the appellants having
regard to the accusations made in the First Information Report and the material available on the
record, this court is not inclined to interfere with the impugned order dated 24.08.2023.
11. Keeping in view all the aspects and discussions made above, I find no reason to differ from the
finding of the trial court.
12. Accordingly, the present appeal is dismissed at the stage of admission itself.
