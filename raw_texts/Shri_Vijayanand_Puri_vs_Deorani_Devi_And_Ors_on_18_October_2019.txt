Shri Vijayanand Puri vs Deorani Devi And Ors on 18 October, 2019
CAV JUDGMENT
(Per: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE ASHUTOSH KUMAR)
Patna High Court L.P.A No.1467 of 2018 dt.18-10-2019
2/45
Date : 18-10-2019
The appellant-respondent-defendant (Sri
Vijayanand Puri) has put up a challenge to the order dated
16.03.2018
passed in C.W.J.C. No. 19517 of 2013 passed by a learned Single Judge of this Court whereby the
order passed by the Trial court viz. Sub-Judge VI, Patna in Title Suit No. 19 of 1996 dated
13.08.2013, recalling the order dated 12.02.2013 whereby by the evidence of defendant no. 1 in the
suit was closed and allowing the appellant to prove the documents filed on his behalf, has been set
aside.
It appears that the respondents, by way of Title Suit No. 19 of 1996, had sought declaration of their
title over the suit land and sought a further declaration that the sale deed executed by one Nago Devi
in favour of the appellant with respect to disputed land is fraudulent and therefore not binding on
the respondents.
It further appears from the order impugned that the suit was tried and was fixed for judgment on
20.05.2013. The case was adjourned on that date and Patna High Court L.P.A No.1467 of 2018
dt.18-10-2019 another date of 03.06.2013 was fixed for judgment. On that day, case laws were cited
by the respondents-plaintiffs and the appellant-defendant took time for filing judgments in reply. As
a result, the case was adjourned to 05.06.2013 for hearing and judgment. The matter was again
posted on 12.06.2013 for judgment. On that date, the appellant sought an adjournment for further
arguments on the question of law, which prayer was allowed and the case was fixed for arguments
on 01.07.2013 at the instance of the appellant.
It further appears that the appellant had filed certain documents along with the petition under
Order XVII Rule 17 read with 151 of the CPC for recalling the order dated 12.02.2013 whereby the
evidence of defendant no. 1 in the suit was closed. The aforesaid prayer of the appellant was allowed
and an opportunity was given to him to prove the documents by adducing evidence.
Patna High Court L.P.A No.1467 of 2018 dt.18-10-2019 The learned Single Judge, on finding that
the documents brought on record or referred to in the written statement had no concern with the
issues involved in the suit, held that there was no explanation available with the
appellant-defendant for not producing such documents on earlier occasion. The other documents
which were brought on record by the appellant-defendant were the certified copy of the judgment of
Title Suit No. 4 of 1986 which was a probate case preferred by one Faguni Devi against the appellant
for grant of probate/letter of administration with respect to property bequeathed by Nago Devi by
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/28273198/ 2
Shri Vijayanand Puri vs Deorani Devi And Ors on 18 October, 2019
virtue of a registered deed of will dated 30.11.1977. In the aforesaid probate case, which on objection
was converted into a title suit, the registered deed of will and the registered deed of cancellation of
will filed by the appellant-defendant was in issue. The learned Single Judge also found that the
appellant had contested the aforesaid probate case which was dismissed.
Patna High Court L.P.A No.1467 of 2018 dt.18-10-2019 Thus finding that there was no need of those
documents for adjudication of issues involved in the present title suit and that even though such
documents were available with the appellant-defendant from before, and even them it was not
brought on record, the learned Single Judge held that the trial court had committed an error of law
in allowing such a prayer of the appellant- defendant.
The order of the trial court therefore was set aside.
Hence the present appeal.
The writ petition by the respondent-plaintiff was initially filed under Article 226 of the Constitution
of India but it was converted into one under Article 227. Any order passed under Article 227 would
normally not be amenable to Letters Patent Appellate Jurisdiction. However while hearing the
learned counsel for the parties, this Court was of the view that the nature and tenor of the order
passed by the learned Single Judge was that of a grant of Patna High Court L.P.A No.1467 of 2018
dt.18-10-2019 certiorari under Article 226 and not under Article 227 which is a supervisory
jurisdiction. The prima facie reason for us to come to the aforesaid view is the manner in which the
order has been passed by the learned Single Judge wherein there is no reference of the exercise of
power under Article 227. Rather, the manner in which the order of the Trial court has been annulled
without any further direction, reflects that such order was passed by way of a writ of certiorari. If
that be so, then the present appeal would be maintainable.
It would be apposite to extract the order of this Court passed on 24.09.2019 on the issue of
maintainability of the present appeal.
Having heard the appellant in person and Shri Rajendra Narain, learned Senior Counsel for the
contesting respondent, we find an issue of seminal importance having been raised in this case
pertaining to the nature of the proceedings instituted before the learned Single Judge and the extent
of power exercised by the learned Singe Judge while Patna High Court L.P.A No.1467 of 2018
dt.18-10-2019 disposing of the matter, namely, as to whether the writ petition even though initially
labelled as an Article 226 Writ Petition and later on corrected as a petition under Article 227 in
essence was an application in the real sense of the term as used under Article 227 or not? and as to
whether the learned Single Judge while disposing of the matter had exercised a power which was
co-extensive with the powers under Article 226 of the Constitution of India or was an exclusive
power of the judicial superintendence as understood in legal parlance under Article 227 of the
Constitution of India?
Learned counsel for the parties at the bar have advanced their submissions and it is the contention
of Shri Rajendra Narain that the application even though captioned as a writ was in essence a Civil
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/28273198/ 3
Shri Vijayanand Puri vs Deorani Devi And Ors on 18 October, 2019
Miscellaneous application which was factually and actually an application seeking relief from this
Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India before the learned Single Judge.
As a natural sequel to said argument, Shri Narain also urged that once the jurisdiction Patna High
Court L.P.A No.1467 of 2018 dt.18-10-2019 exercised by the learned Single Judge is one that of
Article 227 of the Constitution of India, then in that event, a Letters Patent Appeal under Clause 10
of the Letters Patent Constituting the High Court of Judicature at Patna contained in Appendix E of
the Rules of the High Court at Patna, 1916 could not be maintainable and, therefore, the appeal is
liable to be dismissed.
While defending the judgement of the learned Single Judge, Shri Narain has invited the attention of
the Court to the ratio of the Apex Court in paragraph 15 of the decision in the case of Bagai
Construction through its Proprietor Lalit Bagai Versus Gupta Building Material Store, reported in
(2013) 14 SCC 1, to urge that even otherwise, on an appraisal of the facts of the present case which
has been recorded by the learned Single Judge and is also available in the order sheet of the Court
below, any opportunity of leading evidence after the entire arguments was over would be in breach
of the ratio of the aforesaid judgement. He, therefore, submits that the learned Single Judge,
therefore, in Patna High Court L.P.A No.1467 of 2018 dt.18-10-2019 consonance of the said law laid
down by the Hon'ble Apex Court had only defined the bounds of the Court below while proceeding
to set aside the order passed by the Civil Court. He, therefore, submits that this was not an exercise
of writ of certiorari but it was only an exercise of power of judicial superintendence under Article
227 of the Constitution of India. With the aid of the other judgements cited at the bar, he has urged
that if Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India read together are supplementary and
complimentary to each other, then the extent of judicial superintendence under Article 227 of the
Constitution of India would extend even in respect of the administrative superintendence of the
High Court as envisaged in the provisions aforesaid and, therefore, while exercising such powers,
the High Court can set right such orders which it finds to be travelling beyond the bounds of law.
The contention, therefore, is that the impugned judgement of the learned Single Judge is in the
exercise of Article 227 of the Constitution of India and not an exercise of writ of certiorari so as to
Patna High Court L.P.A No.1467 of 2018 dt.18-10-2019 create a bar in the light of the judgement in
the case of Radhey Shayam and Anr. Versus Chhabi Nath and others, reported in (2015) 5 SCC 423.
We have also traversed the said judgement along with the aid of the other judgements referred to
therein and apart from the same, we have also come across the Division Bench judgement in the
case of Moti Lal Versus State through Shrimati Sagarwati, reported in Indian Law Reports 1952
Allahabad Series 558.
Shri Narain has also invited the attention of the Court to the Division Bench judgement of a recent
origin of this Court in the case of Heera Chand Swarnkar @ Heera Chandra Swarnkar Versus Sri
Radhe Shyam Jee Maharaj Virajman, through Pradeep Kumar & Anr. reported in 2016 (1) PLJR
489. With the aid of the said judgement, he contends that the present appeal which essentially arises
out of an application under Article 227 of the Constitution of India should not be entertained. He
has further substantiated his submissions by contending that labelling of a petition would not Patna
High Court L.P.A No.1467 of 2018 dt.18-10-2019 alter the nature of the relief prayed for and the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/28273198/ 4
Shri Vijayanand Puri vs Deorani Devi And Ors on 18 October, 2019
jurisdiction invoked and, therefore, once the petitioner had filed an application under Article 227 of
the Constitution of India, then the same should be construed as such and the learned Single Judge
should also be presumed to have exercised the said jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution
of India.
On the other hand, the appellant has urged that the learned Single Judge has virtually exercised a
writ of certiorari and a power of judicial review so as to substitute the findings of the Civil Court
which traversed beyond the scope of Article 227 of the Constitution of India. It is his contention that
the manner in which the power has been exercised and the tenor of the order is one of the exercise
of certiorari for setting aside and quashing an order of Civil Court which is clearly bar in view of the
law laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Radhey Shayam and Anr. Versus Chhabi
Nath and others (supra).
Patna High Court L.P.A No.1467 of 2018 dt.18-10-2019 Having heard learned counsel for the
parties, judgement reserved.
The questions which according to us is required to be decided are:
(a) Whether the order impugned is an order under the exercise of jurisdiction under
Articles 226 or 227 of the Constitution of India?
(b) Whether it has to be presumed in the event of the caption of the writ petition that
such an order has been passed under Article 227?
(c) What would be the method of identifying as to whether an order is amenable to
judicial superintendence under Article 227 or such order is amenable to a writ of
certiorari under Article 226?
(d) If the order impugned is an order under Article 226, then was it justified for the
learned Single Judge to pass such an order in view of law laid down in Radhey Shyam
and Anr. vs. Chhabi Patna High Court L.P.A No.1467 of 2018 dt.18-10-2019 Nath and
Ors. (2015) 5 SCC 423. If the order is under Article 227, whether this appeal would be
maintainable?
(e) Lastly, whether the jurisdiction under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of
India are complementary and supplementary to each other or operate in two distinct
fields on different footing?
To answer the aforesaid questions, we deem it appropriate to make some detour in the past for
identifying as to how the law with respect to issuance of writ of certiorari has developed.
There is no dispute that under the Constitution of India, the High Courts have wide powers under
Article 226 to issue prerogative writs including the writ of certiorari. The nature and extent of such
jurisdiction conferred on the High Courts under Article 226 was first considered by Supreme Court
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/28273198/ 5
Shri Vijayanand Puri vs Deorani Devi And Ors on 18 October, 2019
in T.C. Basappa v. T. Nagappa, AIR 1954 SC 440. In the aforesaid case, Justice Mukherjea, who
spoke for the court clearly cautioned that there is no Patna High Court L.P.A No.1467 of 2018
dt.18-10-2019 need for looking back and delving into the history of such prerogative writs as the
powers of the High Courts are clear and broad under Article 226 of the Constitution of India but so
long as such power is exercised within the broad and fundamental parameters which regulate the
exercise of such jurisdiction. While dealing with the features of writ of certiorari, Justice Mhukerjea
listed the area of restraints. It was clearly stipulated that while granting writ of certiorari, the
superior court does not exercise the powers of an appellate tribunal, nor does it review or reweigh
the evidence upon which the determination of an inferior tribunal is based. With a writ of certiorari,
an order without jurisdiction or a palpably erroneous order is demolished but while doing so, the
superior court cannot be superimpose its own opinion.
The scope and jurisdiction of the power of issuance such writs was again examined by a special
Bench of Supreme Court in Smt. Ujjam Bai vs. State of U.P. AIR 1962 SC 1621. The majority opinion
in the Patna High Court L.P.A No.1467 of 2018 dt.18-10-2019 aforesaid case was that where a quasi
judicial authority makes an order in exercise of its jurisdiction under a provision of law which is
intra vires, an error of law or fact committed by that authority cannot be impeached otherwise than
on appeal. However if such wrong decision of the authority is because of lack of jurisdiction, it could
be corrected by a writ of certiorari.
Prior to the aforesaid decisions, the Allahabad High Court in Moti Lal vs. State through Smt.
Sagarwati, The Indian Law Reports 1952 Page 558 had the occasion to deal with the aforesaid issue.
The matter arose out of a very small incident. The complainant had alleged that Moti Lal (applicant)
had stolen a cow from her house after having sold the same to her. In the Panchayati Adalat, Moti
Lal was convicted and fined Rs. 45/- for having stolen the cow. While convicting and sentencing the
applicant, the evidence of one of the Panches was also taken into account. Moti Lal preferred a
revision against that order on the sole ground that Patna High Court L.P.A No.1467 of 2018
dt.18-10-2019 evidence of a Panch could not be taken into account and that such witness could not
have sat on the Bench which decided the case. The revision petition was dismissed by factually
holding that the concerned Panch was not a member of the Bench which decided the case.
Thereafter a petition was filed by Moti Lal under Article 227 of the Constitution, intimating the
court that by mistake of the counsel, name of another Panch was taken but the fact remained that
one of the witnesses/Panch sat on the Bench. The moot question therefore was whether a witness
could be a Judge in a Panchayati Adalat. However while deciding that question, an issue cropped up
whether under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, an order of the Subordinate Tribunal could
have been interfered with; as by that time the law had not developed in the manner as it stands
today and Article 227 of the Constitution was thought to be a forum for exercise of administrative
power of superintendence of the High Court.
Patna High Court L.P.A No.1467 of 2018 dt.18-10-2019 Justice Agrawala, one of the Judges on the
Bench, after going through the provisions contained in Article 227 found that the power of
superintendence was not confined to specific powers given under Clause 2 of Article 227 but it was
for judicial superintendence as well. The same could be done by issuing writs of certiorari or
prohibition. This power of superintendence, traditionally and historically speaking, was never
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/28273198/ 6
Shri Vijayanand Puri vs Deorani Devi And Ors on 18 October, 2019
exercised in England to correct mere errors of law or errors of fact which did not involve errors of
jurisdiction or any error apparent on the face of the record. Agrawala, J. referred to the case of Tej
Ram vs. Harsukh, 1870 (78) ILR 1 All, 101 in which it was held that the writs of certiorari and
prohibition could not be issued for setting right the orders of a subordinate court if it were based on
error of law or fact. Later, on experiencing practical difficulty in not interfering with the judicial
proceedings of a subordinate court, the issue was again revisited by a Full Court of five Judges in
Md. Suleman Khan vs. Fatima 1887 ILR 9, All, 104. Patna High Court L.P.A No.1467 of 2018
dt.18-10-2019 In the aforesaid case, it was held that the power of superintendence included powers
of judicial or quasi judicial character and the revisional powers of the court could be accepted as an
indicator of the extent to which the court could have ordinarily interfered with the findings of the
subordinate tribunals.
Justice Sapru, in Motilal (supra) however, was of the view that the provisions contained in Article
227 provide the power of superintendence which could not be limited to the administrative side but
it also extended to limited judicial character as well.
In Naresh Shridhar Mirajkar vs. State of Maharashtra and Anr., AIR 1967 SC 1, a nine Judges Bench
of the Supreme Court had the occasion to look at the scope of the powers under Article 227 of the
Constitution of India.
In the aforesaid case, Mr. Mirajkar, a reporter with an English Weekly, Blitz, was directed by
Hon'ble Judge (Justice Tarkunde) while trying a suit of defamation, Patna High Court L.P.A
No.1467 of 2018 dt.18-10-2019 not to report the deposition of one of the witnesses. This direction
was oral but when a protest was made and the Bench was asked to pass a written order, the same
was declined. The aforesaid decision of the Hon'ble Judge trying the suit was under challenge before
the Bombay High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution which was dismissed on the ground
that the order challenged was a judicial order of the High Court which was not amenable to a writ
under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The matter travelled to the Supreme Court under
Article 32 of the Constitution of India for enforcement of the fundamental right of Mr. Mirajkar
under Article 19(1)(a) and (g) of the Constitution. The main issue before the Supreme Court was
whether there could be any interdict against an open trial but additionally, an issue also cropped up
relating to the nature and extent of the Supreme Court's jurisdiction to issue writs of certiorari
under Article 32 (2) of the Constitution of India.
Patna High Court L.P.A No.1467 of 2018 dt.18-10-2019 While dealing with the aforesaid issue, the
Supreme Court in Mirajkar (supra) clarified that the power of the Supreme Court under Article
32(2) and the powers of the High Court to issue similar writs under Article 226 were very wide.
Justice Gajendra Gadkar, speaking for himself and for Wanchu, Mudholkar, Sikri and Ramaswami
JJ., held that judicial orders passed by the High Courts in or in relation to proceedings pending
before them are not amenable to be corrected by exercise of writ of certiorari. It would be
unreasonable to attempt to rationalize the assumption of jurisdiction by the Supreme Court under
Article 32 to correct such judicial orders on the "fanciful" hypothesis that High Courts may pass
erroneous orders in or in relation to matters pending before them and that remedy by way of a writ
of certiorari should, therefore, be sought for and be deemed to be included within the scope of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/28273198/ 7
Shri Vijayanand Puri vs Deorani Devi And Ors on 18 October, 2019
Article 32 of the Constitution of India. It was categorically held by the majority of the Judges that
the words used in Article 32 are no doubt wide Patna High Court L.P.A No.1467 of 2018
dt.18-10-2019 but having regard to the relevant considerations, exercise of writ of certiorari under
Article 32 to correct an order passed by a High Court would be repugnant to the well recognized
limitations within which the jurisdiction to issue writs of certiorari could be exercised and would be
inconsistent with the uniform trend of the Supreme Court's decision in relation to the said point.
The same principle applied mutatis mutandis to the powers vested in the High Court under Article
226 of the Constitution of India to correct orders of inferior courts under its jurisdiction.
Again in Rupa Ashok Hurrah vs. Ashok Hurra and Anr. (2002) 4 SCC 388 where a constitutional
question of considerable significance had arisen viz. whether an aggrieved person is entitled to any
relief against a final judgment/order of the Supreme Court after dismissal of review petition, either
under Article 32 of the Constitution or otherwise, the Supreme Court had the occasion to deal with
the powers of the Supreme Court Patna High Court L.P.A No.1467 of 2018 dt.18-10-2019 and the
High Courts in issuance of prerogative writs including the writ of certiorari. In this case also, the
views expressed in Mirajkar (supra) was reiterated.
However in Surya Dev Rai vs. Ram Chander Rai and Others (2003) 6 SCC 675 , a two Judges Bench
of the Supreme Court concluded as follows :
"38. Such like matters frequently arise before the High Courts. We sum up our
conclusions in a nutshell, even at the risk of repetition and state the same as
hereunder:
(1) Amendment by Act 46 of 1999 with effect from 1-7-2002 in Section 115 of the
Code of Civil Procedure cannot and does not affect in any manner the jurisdiction of
the High Court under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution.
(2) Interlocutory orders, passed by the courts subordinate to the High Court, against
which remedy of revision has been excluded by CPC Amendment Act 46 of 1999 are
nevertheless open to challenge in, and continue to be subject to, certiorari and
supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court.
Patna High Court L.P.A No.1467 of 2018 dt.18-10-2019 (3) Certiorari, under Article 226 of the
Constitution, is issued for correcting gross errors of jurisdiction i.e. when a subordinate court is
found to have acted (i) without jurisdiction - by assuming jurisdiction where there exists none, or
(ii) in excess of its jurisdiction - by overstepping or crossing the limits of jurisdiction, or (iii) acting
in flagrant disregard of law or the rules of procedure or acting in violation of principles of natural
justice where there is no procedure specified, and thereby occasioning failure of justice.
(4) Supervisory jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution is exercised for keeping the
subordinate courts within the bounds of their jurisdiction. When a subordinate court has assumed a
jurisdiction which it does not have or has failed to exercise a jurisdiction which it does have or the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/28273198/ 8
Shri Vijayanand Puri vs Deorani Devi And Ors on 18 October, 2019
jurisdiction though available is being exercised by the court in a manner not permitted by law and
failure of justice or grave injustice has occasioned thereby, the High Court may step in to exercise its
supervisory jurisdiction. Patna High Court L.P.A No.1467 of 2018 dt.18-10-2019 (5) Be it a writ of
certiorari or the exercise of supervisory jurisdiction, none is available to correct mere errors of fact
or of law unless the following requirements are satisfied: (i) the error is manifest and apparent on
the face of the proceedings such as when it is based on clear ignorance or utter disregard of the
provisions of law, and (ii) a grave injustice or gross failure of justice has occasioned thereby.
(6) A patent error is an error which is self-evident i.e. which can be perceived or demonstrated
without involving into any lengthy or complicated argument or a long- drawn process of reasoning.
Where two inferences are reasonably possible and the subordinate court has chosen to take one
view, the error cannot be called gross or patent.
(7) The power to issue a writ of certiorari and the supervisory jurisdiction are to be exercised
sparingly and only in appropriate cases where the judicial conscience of the High Court dictates it to
act lest a gross failure of justice or grave injustice should occasion. Care, caution and circumspection
Patna High Court L.P.A No.1467 of 2018 dt.18-10-2019 need to be exercised, when any of the
abovesaid two jurisdictions is sought to be invoked during the pendency of any suit or proceedings
in a subordinate court and the error though calling for correction is yet capable of being corrected at
the conclusion of the proceedings in an appeal or revision preferred thereagainst and entertaining a
petition invoking certiorari or supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court would obstruct the smooth
flow and/or early disposal of the suit or proceedings. The High Court may feel inclined to intervene
where the error is such, as, if not corrected at that very moment, may become incapable of
correction at a later stage and refusal to intervene would result in travesty of justice or where such
refusal itself would result in prolonging of the lis.
(8) The High Court in exercise of certiorari or supervisory jurisdiction will not convert itself into a
court of appeal and indulge in reappreciation or evaluation of evidence or correct errors in drawing
inferences or correct errors of mere formal or technical character. Patna High Court L.P.A No.1467
of 2018 dt.18-10-2019 (9) In practice, the parameters for exercising jurisdiction to issue a writ of
certiorari and those calling for exercise of supervisory jurisdiction are almost similar and the width
of jurisdiction exercised by the High Courts in India unlike English courts has almost obliterated the
distinction between the two jurisdictions. While exercising jurisdiction to issue a writ of certiorari,
the High Court may annul or set aside the act, order or proceedings of the subordinate courts but
cannot substitute its own decision in place thereof. In exercise of supervisory jurisdiction the High
Court may not only give suitable directions so as to guide the subordinate court as to the manner in
which it would act or proceed thereafter or afresh, the High Court may in appropriate cases itself
make an order in supersession or substitution of the order of the subordinate court as the court
should have made in the facts and circumstances of the case.
(emphasis provided)
39. Though we have tried to lay down broad principles and working rules, the fact Patna High Court
L.P.A No.1467 of 2018 dt.18-10-2019 remains that the parameters for exercise of jurisdiction under
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/28273198/ 9
Shri Vijayanand Puri vs Deorani Devi And Ors on 18 October, 2019
Articles 226 or 227 of the Constitution cannot be tied down in a strait- jacket formula or rigid rules.
Not less than often, the High Court would be faced with a dilemma. If it intervenes in pending
proceedings there is bound to be delay in termination of proceedings. If it does not intervene, the
error of the moment may earn immunity from correction. The facts and circumstances of a given
case may make it more appropriate for the High Court to exercise self-restraint and not to intervene
because the error of jurisdiction though committed is yet capable of being taken care of and
corrected at a later stage and the wrong done, if any, would be set right and rights and equities
adjusted in appeal or revision preferred at the conclusion of the proceedings. But there may be cases
where "a stitch in time would save nine". At the end, we may sum up by saying that the power is
there but the exercise is discretionary which will be governed solely by the dictates of judicial
conscience Patna High Court L.P.A No.1467 of 2018 dt.18-10-2019 enriched by judicial experience
and practical wisdom of the judge."
The aforesaid observation of the two Judges Bench in Surya Dev Rai (supra) was not accepted by
another Bench of two Hon'ble Judges of the Supreme Court in Radhey Shyam and Anr. vs. Chhabi
Nath and Ors. (2009) 5 SCC 616 and the issue therefore was referred to a three Judges Bench to
consider the correctness of the law laid down in Surya Dev Rai (supra) that an order of the Civil
Court was amenable to writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution. The reference in the
aforesaid case, viz. Radhey Shyam and Another vs. Chhabi Nath and Others. With Jagdish Prasad
vs. Iqbal Kaur and Others. which has been reported in 2015 (5) SCC 423, has been answered as
follows:
"29. Accordingly, we answer the question referred as follows:
29.1. Judicial orders of the civil court are not amenable to writ jurisdiction under
Article 226 of the Constitution.
29.2 Jurisdiction under Article 227 is distinct from jurisdiction under Article 226.
Patna High Court L.P.A No.1467 of 2018 dt.18-10-2019 29.3 Contrary view in Surya Dev Rai is
overruled."
Now to the question of difference between the powers conferred on the High Courts under Articles
226 and 227 of the Constitution of India.
The Supreme Court in Shalini Shyam Shetty and Anr. vs. Rajendra Shankar Patil (2010) 8 SCC 329,
after having referred to various decisions, concluded as follows:
"46. Articles 226 and 227 stand on substantially different footing. As noted above,
prior to the Constitution, the Chartered High Courts as also the judicial Committee of
the Privy Council could issue prerogative writs in exercise of their original
jurisdiction. (See Umaji Keshao Meshram v. Radhikabai, SCC at p. 469.) However,
after the Constitution every High Court has been conferred with the power to issue
writs under Article 226 and these are original proceeding. (State of U.P. v. Dr. Vijay
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/28273198/ 10
Shri Vijayanand Puri vs Deorani Devi And Ors on 18 October, 2019
Anand Maharaj, AIR p. 951.)
47. The jurisdiction under Article 227 on the other hand is not original nor is it
appellate. This jurisdiction of superintendence under Article 227 is for both
administrative and judicial superintendence. Therefore, the Patna High Court L.P.A
No.1467 of 2018 dt.18-10-2019 powers conferred under Articles 226 and 227 are
separate and distinct and operate in different fields. Another distinction between
these two jurisdictions is that under Article 226, the High Court normally annuls or
quashes an order or proceeding but in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 227,
the High Court, apart from annulling the proceeding, can also substitute the
impugned order by the order which the inferior tribunal should have made. (See
Surya Dev Rai, SCC p. 690, para 25 and also the decision of the Constitution Bench of
this Court in Hari Vishnu Kamath v. Ahmad Ishaque, AIR p. 243, para 20.)
48. The jurisdiction under Article 226 normally is exercised where a party is affected
but power under Article 227 can be exercised by the High Court suo motu as a
custodian of justice. In fact, the power under Article 226 is exercised in favour of
persons or citizens for vindication of their fundamental rights or other statutory
rights. The jurisdiction under Article 227 is exercised by the High Court for
vindication of its position as the highest judicial authority in the State. In certain
cases where Patna High Court L.P.A No.1467 of 2018 dt.18-10-2019 there is
infringement of fundamental right, the relief under Article 226 of the Constitution
can be claimed ex debito justitiae or as a matter of right. But in cases where the High
Court exercises its jurisdiction under Article 227, such exercise is entirely
discretionary and no person can claim it as a matter of right. From an order of a
Single Judge passed under Article 226, a letters patent appeal or an intra-court
appeal is maintainable. But no such appeal is maintainable from an order passed by a
Single Judge of a High Court in exercise of power under Article 227. In almost all the
High Court's rules have been framed for regulating the exercise of jurisdiction under
Article 226. No such rule appears to have been framed for exercise of High Court's
power under Article 227 possibly to keep such exercise entirely in the domain of the
discretion of High Court.
49. On an analysis of the aforesaid decisions of this Court, the following principles on
the exercise of High Court's jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution may be
formulated:
Patna High Court L.P.A No.1467 of 2018 dt.18-10-2019
(a) A petition under Article 226 of the Constitution is different from a petition under
Article 227. The mode of exercise of power by the High Court under these two articles
is also different.
(b) In any event, a petition under Article 227 cannot be called a writ petition.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/28273198/ 11
Shri Vijayanand Puri vs Deorani Devi And Ors on 18 October, 2019
The history of the conferment of writ jurisdiction on High Courts is substantially
different from the history of conferment of the power of superintendence on the High
Courts under Article 227 and have been discussed above.
(c) High Courts cannot, at the drop of a hat, in exercise of its power of
superintendence under Article 227 of the Constitution, interfere with the orders of
tribunals or courts inferior to it. Nor can it, in exercise of this power, act as a court of
appeal over the orders of the court or tribunal subordinate to it. In cases where an
alternative statutory mode of redressal has been provided, that would also operate as
a restrain on the exercise of this power by the High Court.
Patna High Court L.P.A No.1467 of 2018 dt.18-10-2019
(d) The parameters of interference by High Courts in exercise of their power of superintendence
have been repeatedly laid down by this Court. In this regard the High Court must be guided by the
principles laid down by the Constitution Bench of this Court in Waryam Singh and the principles in
Waryam Singh have been repeatedly followed by subsequent Constitution Benches and various
other decisions of this Court.
(e) According to the ratio in Waryam Singh, followed in subsequent cases, the High Court in exercise
of its jurisdiction of superintendence can interfere in order only to keep the tribunals and courts
subordinate to it, "within the bounds of their authority".
(f) In order to ensure that law is followed by such tribunals and courts by exercising jurisdiction
which is vested in them and by not declining to exercise the jurisdiction which is vested in them.
(g) Apart from the situations pointed in (e) and (f), High Court can interfere in exercise of its power
of superintendence when there has been a patent perversity in the Patna High Court L.P.A No.1467
of 2018 dt.18-10-2019 orders of the tribunals and courts subordinate to it or where there has been a
gross and manifest failure of justice or the basic principles of natural justice have been flouted.
(h) In exercise of its power of superintendence High Court cannot interfere to correct mere errors of
law or fact or just because another view than the one taken by the tribunals or courts subordinate to
it, is a possible view. In other words the jurisdiction has to be very sparingly exercised.
(i) The High Court's power of superintendence under Article 227 cannot be curtailed by any statute.
It has been declared a part of the basic structure of the Constitution by the Constitution Bench of
this Court in L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India and therefore abridgment by a constitutional
amendment is also very doubtful.
(j) It may be true that a statutory amendment of a rather cognate provision, like Section 115 of the
Civil Procedure Code by the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act, 1999 does not and cannot cut
down the ambit of High Court's power under Article 227. At the Patna High Court L.P.A No.1467 of
2018 dt.18-10-2019 same time, it must be remembered that such statutory amendment does not
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/28273198/ 12
Shri Vijayanand Puri vs Deorani Devi And Ors on 18 October, 2019
correspondingly expand the High Court's jurisdiction of superintendence under Article 227.
(k) The power is discretionary and has to be exercised on equitable principle. In an appropriate case,
the power can be exercised suo motu.
(l) On a proper appreciation of the wide and unfettered power of the High Court under Article 227, it
transpires that the main object of this article is to keep strict administrative and judicial control by
the High Court on the administration of justice within its territory.
(m) The object of superintendence, both administrative and judicial, is to maintain efficiency,
smooth and orderly functioning of the entire machinery of justice in such a way as it does not bring
it into any disrepute. The power of interference under this article is to be kept to the minimum to
ensure that the wheel of justice does not come to a halt and the fountain of justice remains pure and
unpolluted in order to maintain public confidence in the Patna High Court L.P.A No.1467 of 2018
dt.18-10-2019 functioning of the tribunals and courts subordinate to the High Court.
(n) This reserve and exceptional power of judicial intervention is not to be exercised just for grant of
relief in individual cases but should be directed for promotion of public confidence in the
administration of justice in the larger public interest whereas Article 226 is meant for protection of
individual grievance. Therefore, the power under Article 227 may be unfettered but its exercise is
subject to high degree of judicial discipline pointed out above.
(o) An improper and a frequent
exercise of this power will be
counterproductive and will divest this
extraordinary power of its strength and vitality."
After having glossed over the decisions referred to above, we are of the considered opinion that by
now the law has concretized that there are manifold differences between Articles 226 and 227 of the
Constitution of India and one of the parameters to test whether an order has been passed under
Articles 226 or 227 is that under Article 226, a High Court can annul or quash an order or Patna
High Court L.P.A No.1467 of 2018 dt.18-10-2019 proceeding but under Article 227, a High Court
can, apart from annulling a proceeding in question, can also lay down the boundaries within which
the inferior court is supposed to exercise its jurisdiction in order to rectify any error of law and fact
apparent on the face of the record (also refer to Hari Vishnu Kamath vs. Syed Ahmad Ishaque, AIR
1955 SC 233 ).
In Lokmat Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. vs. ShankarPrasad (1999) 6 SCC 275, the Supreme Court had the
occasion to identify whether a writ petition filed by the respondent was under Articles 226 or 227
and whether an appeal was maintainable against an order passed by the writ court. In the aforesaid
case, the respondent who was a Foreman in the Composing Department of the appellant, was
terminated from service. A complaint was filed by the respondent before the Labour Court alleging
that the appellant had indulged in unfair labour practice. The aforesaid complaint of the respondent
was dismissed by the Labour Court and the revision against the aforesaid dismissal of complaint was
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/28273198/ 13
Shri Vijayanand Puri vs Deorani Devi And Ors on 18 October, 2019
also dismissed by the Industrial Tribunal, Nagpur. The respondent thereafter preferred a writ
petition under Articles 226 and 227, challenging the decisions rendered by both the courts below.
The writ petition also was rejected by the Single Judge. Thereafter, LPA was filed Patna High Court
L.P.A No.1467 of 2018 dt.18-10-2019 before the Division Bench of the High Court of Nagpur which
reversed the orders of the courts below by holding that the appellant had engaged in unfair labour
practice. This order of the Division Bench in Letters Patent Appeal was challenged under Article 136
of the Constitution of India before the Supreme Court by the management/appellant.
One of the major contentions of the appellant was that the Single Judge of the High Court had
passed an order under Article 227 and hence the order was not amenable to an intra Court appeal of
Letters Patent. In support of the aforesaid contention, attention was invited to the relevant
averments in the writ petition as well as the order of the learned Single Judge. On the issue of
maintainability, the Supreme Court referred to the various paragraphs of the writ petition and found
that the respondent had invoked the jurisdiction of the High Court both under Articles 226 and 227
and had tried to make out a case for the High Court's interference, seeking issuance of an
appropriate writ of certiorari under Article
226. The order of the learned Single Judge nowhere stated that the court was considering the writ
petition under Article 226 and the writ was dismissed by observing that the courts below had
appreciated the contentions and rejected the complaint. The Supreme Court did not Patna High
Court L.P.A No.1467 of 2018 dt.18-10-2019 therefore accept the view that the learned Single Judge
had passed an order under Article 227 of the Constitution. Reliance was placed by the Supreme
Court on a decision in Umaji Keshao Meshram vs. Radhikabai 1986 Supp SCC 401 where the same
question was urged and answered as follows:
"107. Petitions are at times filed both under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution.
The case of Hari Vishnu Kamath v. Syed Ahmad Ishaque before this Court was of
such a type. Rule 18 provides that where such petitions are filed against orders of the
tribunals or authorities specified in Rule 18 of Chapter XVII of the Appellate Side
Rules or against decrees or orders of courts specified in that rule, they shall be heard
and finally disposed of by a Single Judge. The question is whether an appeal would lie
from the decision of the Single Judge in such a case. In our opinion, where the facts
justify a party in filing an application either under Article 226 or 227 of the
Constitution, and the party chooses to file his application under both these articles, in
fairness and justice to such party and in order not to deprive him of the valuable right
of Patna High Court L.P.A No.1467 of 2018 dt.18-10-2019 appeal the court ought to
treat the application as being made under Article 226, and if in deciding the matter,
in the final order the court gives ancillary directions which may pertain to Article 227,
this ought not to be held to deprive a party of the right of appeal under clause 15 of
the Letters Patent where the substantial part of the order sought to be appealed
against is under Article 226. Such was the view taken by the Allahabad High Court in
Aidal Singh v. Karan Singh and by the Punjab High Court in Raj Kishan Jain v. Tulsi
Dass and Barham Dutt v. Peoples' Coop.
Transport Society Ltd. and we are in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/28273198/ 14
Shri Vijayanand Puri vs Deorani Devi And Ors on 18 October, 2019
agreement with it."
It was therefore held that once a jurisdiction was invoked under Articles 226 and 227
and the writ petition was dismissed on merits, it could not be said that power was
exercised only under Article 227. The consideration on such issue would depend
upon the relevant averment made in the writ petition, the nature of jurisdiction
invoked by the writ petitioner and the nature of order passed by the learned Single
Judge.
A Division Bench of this Court in Heera Chand Swarnkar @ Heera Chandra Swarnkar
vs. Sri Radhe Patna High Court L.P.A No.1467 of 2018 dt.18-10-2019 Shyam Jee
Maharaj Virajman through Pradeep Kumar & Anr. 2016 (1) PLJR 489 has held as
follows:
"24. What nomenclature has been used by a party, while seeking intervention by
Court is not so material as the contents of the order, which is challenged, as well as
the contents of the order, which has been passed by the High Court. [See State of
M.P. vs. Visan Kumar Shiv Charan Lal, reported in (2008) 15 SCC 233].
25. If the judgment under appeal falls squarely within four corners of Article 227 of
the Constitution of India, it goes without saying that intra-Court appeal from such
judgment would not be maintainable. On the other hand, if the petitioner has
invoked the jurisdiction of the High Court for issuance of certain writ under Article
226 of the Constitution of India, although Article 227 of the Constitution of India is
also mentioned, and, principally, the judgment appealed against falls under Article
226 of the Constitution of India, appeal would be maintainable.
26. What is important to be ascertained is, therefore, the true nature of the Patna
High Court L.P.A No.1467 of 2018 dt.18-10-2019 order passed by the Single Judge
and not what provision he mentions, while exercising such powers. [See Ashok K. Jha
vs. Garden Silk Mills Ltd., reported in (2009) 10 SCC 584].
27. In Ramesh Chandra Sankla vs. Vikram Cement, reported in (2008) 14 SCC 58, the
Supreme Court has held that a statement, made by a learned Single Judge, that he
has exercised power under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, cannot take away
right of appeal against such a judgment if power is, otherwise, found to have been
exercised under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
28. Clarified the Supreme Court, in MMTC vs. CCT, reported in, (2009) 1 SCC 8, that
a High Court shall consider the nature of the controversy, the nature of relief, which
is sought for, and the nature of the order, which might have been passed by a Single
Judge of the High Court in order to decide if the order has been made under Article
226 or 227 of the Constitution of India."

Shri Vijayanand Puri vs Deorani Devi And Ors on 18 October, 2019
Now applying the aforesaid principles to the facts of the present case, it appears that even though
the writ Patna High Court L.P.A No.1467 of 2018 dt.18-10-2019 petition has been filed under Article
227 but the averments made in the writ petition clearly make out that a writ of certiorari was
invoked by the respondent-plaintiff. In the entire order of the learned single Judge, there is no
reference of any exercise of power under Article 227. The tenor of the order clearly reflects that a
writ of certiorari was issued and the order passed by the trial court in allowing the petition under
Order XVIII Rule 17 of the appellant was annulled. No further direction was given by the learned
single Judge nor the boundaries of the exercise of jurisdiction was laid down. It would also be
relevant to note that under Order XVIII Rule 17, a court may, at any stage of suit, recall any witness
who has been examined and may put such questions to him as the court thinks fit. The purpose of
the rule is to enable the court, while trying a suit to clarify any doubt which it may have with regard
to the evidence led by the parties. The said provision is not intended to be used to fill up omissions
in the evidence of a witness who has already been examined. The power under Order XVIII Rule 17
is to be sparingly exercised and in appropriate cases and not as a general rule (also refer to Vadiraj
Nagappa Vernekar vs. Sharadchandra Prabhakar Gogate, 2009 (4) SCC 410).
The learned Single Judge has exercised his discretion and annulled the order of the trial court on the
Patna High Court L.P.A No.1467 of 2018 dt.18-10-2019 ground that the documents which were
allowed to be produced and proved by the appellant-defendant were of no relevance in the suit
which was being tried and that it was attempted to be produced at a much belated stage, when the
case was fixed for delivery of judgment. The jurisdiction of the trial court trying the suit to entertain
such application by the appellant-defendant was under
doubt. Courts have to consistently endeavour to follow a time schedule but in the
present case, the trial court, for no apparent good reason, acceded to the request of
the appellant which primarily appeared to be aimed at delaying the conclusion of the
trial of the suit.
Hence, even though the petition was filed under Article 227 of the Constitution of
India, the learned Single Judge appears to have exercised the powers under Article
226 of the Constitution.
In that event, we hold that the present appeal is maintainable.
Now the irresistible conclusion which we are driven to is that the learned Single Judge issued a writ
of certiorari to correct a judicial order which is not permissible and therefore does not stand the
scrutiny of procedural law.
The same is therefore set aside in view of the law declared in Radhey Shyam and Another vs. Chhabi
Patna High Court L.P.A No.1467 of 2018 dt.18-10-2019 Nath and Others. With Jagdish Prasad vs.
Iqbal Kaur and Others reported in 2015 (5) SCC 423.
The matter is remitted to the learned Single Judge with a request to write out a fresh order in
accordance with law as has been noted by us in the preceding paragraphs.
