I.A. No. 6082 of 2017
The aforementioned I.A. has been preferred
on 31.7.2017 on behalf of the petitioner for staying the
construction of Engineering College on the land of the
College. Since the writ application was filed on 19.8.2017 but
no counter affidavit was filed, hence this Court vide order
dated 5.12.2017, directed to maintain status quo as existing
on that day with regard to the land recorded in the revenue
records in the name of the College in question. In the
meantime the learned counsels for the University and the
State were directed to file counter affidavit. The interim
order reads as follows:
"In the meantime, status quo, as
is existing today, with regard to the lands,

recorded in the revenue records in the name of
the College in question, shall be maintained."
Accordingly, I.A. No. 6082 of 2017 stood
disposed of.
I.A. No. 206 of 2018
The aforementioned I.A. was preferred on
09.01.2018
on behalf of the respondent-State (respondent nos.
4 and 5) for modification of the order dated 5.12.2017, whereby the interim order of status quo was
granted. The aforementioned I.A. was not taken up as it is jointly prayed for disposal of the writ
application since the pleadings were almost complete. Moreover, the interim order of status quo was
with regard to the land recorded in the revenue records in the name of the College in question but
since the specific case of the respondent-State is that the part of the land in question is recorded as
'Gairmajarua Aam' and part of it is recorded 'Gairmajarua Malgujar', and the same is not being
disputed by the either party, hence the status quo order is not affecting the petitioner.
Accordingly, the I.A. No. 206 of 2018 stands disposed of.
Patna High Court CWJC No.11979 of 2017 dt.07-03-2019 The aforementioned I.A. was filed on
16.01.2018 for amendment of the prayer to the extent of quashing Memo No. 434 dated 27.6.2017
passed by the Commissioner, Patna Division, Patna, as contained in Annexure 6, whereby and
whereunder part of the land appertaining to Thana No. 237, Khata No. 1138 and 1139, Plot Nos.
3546, 3549 and 3568, total measuring an area of 4.9 acres has been transferred to Science and
Technology Department, Government of Bihar. Through the same I.A., further prayer was made to
implead the Commissioner, Patna Division, Patna as respondent no. 7. Paragraph no. 1 of I.A. No.
359 of 2018 reads as follows:
"1. That this is an interlocutory application for making additional prayer for dated

Respondent no.7."
Patna High Court CWJC No.11979 of 2017 dt.07-03-2019 Since the Divisional Commissioner, Patna
was already made party respondent no. 7 vide order dated 20.2.2018 and the respondents had no
objection for the amendment of the prayer, hence, I.A. No. 359 of 2018 was disposed of vide order
dated 20.2.2018 to the extent of amendment of the prayer.
The factual matrix of the case is that the then Maharaja Dumraon Ranvijay Prasad Singh executed a
deed of grant registered on 22.2.1945 with regard to 13 acres 35 decimals (21 bigha 7 katha 4
dhoors) of land situated in Ara town. The land is situated in two different localities of Ara town. The
College is located in one side of the town, whereas the land in question is located in the other side of
the town. The land in question is not being utilized till date. However, the College in question
became constituent unit of Magadh University on 9.4.1962. The total area of land measuring 34
acres 59 decimals was submitted by the college in question to the Magadh University claiming the
same from the then Maharaja Dumraon and Adhinath Trust. In October, 1992, Veer Kunwar Singh
University, Ara was carved out from Magadh University and the College in question came within the
jurisdiction of Veer Kunwar Singh University, Ara Patna High Court CWJC No.11979 of 2017
dt.07-03-2019 (hereinafter referred to as the University).
The Government of Bihar took seven resolutions for the good governance and betterment of the
State and one of such resolutions of the State Government, was to establish Engineering College in
each district to restrain brain drain from the State of Bihar. In the district of Bhojpur, one
Engineering College was sanctioned.
On 26.7.2016, the District Magistrate, Ara sought No Objection Certificate from the Registrar of the
University for transfer of 10 acres of land to the Science and Technology Department, Government
of Bihar for establishment of the Engineering College as proposed by the said Department. The
Registrar of the University vide letter dated 01.08.2016, as contained in Annexure 3, requested the
College in question to submit its view in respect of the transfer of the land and the College in its
reply dated 12.8.2016 as contained in Annexure 4, did not agree to the same on the ground that the
land is required for the construction of administrative building, residential quarter of staff and
accordingly, 'No Objection Certificate' was refused.
The land in question was marked as a suitable and viable piece of land by the Collector, Bhojpur and
the Patna High Court CWJC No.11979 of 2017 dt.07-03-2019 proposal for the same was forwarded
to the Principal Secretary, Science and Technology Department, Government of Bihar vide letter no.
134 dated 25.1.2017, as contained in Annexure A to the counter affidavit, filed on behalf of
respondent nos. 4 and 5. The Department of Science and Technology approved the proposal and
transmitted the said intimation to the District Magistrate vide letter no. 669 dated 20.3.2017, as
contained in Annexure B to the counter affidavit, filed on behalf of respondent nos. 4 and 5, with a
request to transmit the proposal for transfer of the land in question. The land in question
appertaining to Khata No. 1138 Khesra No. 3546 and 3569 is recorded in the revenue records as
Gairmajarua Malguzar in the Khatiyan and the land appertaining to Khata No. 1139, Khesra No.
3568 is recorded as Gairmajarua Aam, total area being 7.802 acres. Out of the aforesaid area, 4.90
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/23988747/ 4
H. D. Jain College, Ara vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 7 March, 2019
acres of land was proposed for the construction of the Engineering College. On proposal being
transmitted by the District Magistrate, the Divisional Commissioner, Patna vide order contained in
Memo No. 434 dated 27.6.2017 assented to transfer the land in question to the Science and
Technology Department, Government of Bihar. Consequently, Rs.73.13 crores was sanctioned for
Patna High Court CWJC No.11979 of 2017 dt.07-03-2019 establishment of engineering college on
the land in question.
Clause 3 of the indenture dated 22.2.1945 stipulates that Maharaja Dumraon Ram Ranvijay Prasad
Singh gave 13 acres 35 decimals of land for the infrastructure of H.D. Jain College, Ara and it was
further categorically stipulated that the grantee, the College in question, shall continue in use and
occupation of the land and building so long as the lands and buildings thereon are used exclusively
for the purposes of educational institution. Clause 7 of the said indenture stipulates that in case the
grantee breaches the terms and conditions of the indenture, it will cease to use the land and building
and the grantor shall have the right to resume the grant and re-enter thereon and take possession of
the land and building without any compensation. In pursuance to that, the successor in interest of
the grantor, namely, Maharaja Kamal Singh resumed the land in question and requested the Science
and Technology Department, Government of Bihar for construction of Engineering College and for
that he made proper intimation. On 22.7.2017, the Principal of the College visited the land in
question and found that the government contractor was conducting soil testing for construction of
building for Engineering College and Patna High Court CWJC No.11979 of 2017 dt.07-03-2019
thereafter, the present writ application was filed.
It is submitted by learned Senior counsel for the petitioner that the land was given by the then
Maharaja Dumraon vide indenture dated 22.2.1945. The College in question became constituent
unit of Magadh University on 9.4.1962 and at the time of being constituent unit, the entire land of
the college including the land given by the Maharaja was handed over to the University and hence,
the entire land vested with the Magadh University and consequently with the carving out of Veer
Kunwar Singh University from Magadh University in 1992, the land in question vested with the Veer
Kunwar Singh University. It is further submitted that the land in question is required for the
construction of administrative building, residential quarter and future development of the College
and if the return was not filed by the Maharaja then without initiating a proceeding under Section
4(h) of the Bihar Reforms Act, 1950, the land cannot be taken away. Hence, it is submitted that the
Commissioner, Patna Division has no jurisdiction to transfer the land in question to the State
Government.
It is contended by learned counsel for the respondent nos. 4 and 5, the District Magistrate, Ara and
the Patna High Court CWJC No.11979 of 2017 dt.07-03-2019 Sub-Divisional Officer, Ara that under
seven resolutions for the good governance, the State Government resolved to establish Engineering
College in each district and accordingly, the land in question was selected and Rs.73.13 crores have
been allocated for the construction of Engineering College. The Collector selected the land in
question and forwarded the proposal to the Principal Secretary, Science and Technology
Department, Government of Bihar and consequently, the Department of Science and Technology
approved the proposal with a request to transmit the proposal to the Commissioner, Patna for
transferring the land in question. Since the land in question appertaining to Khata No. 1138 Khesra
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/23988747/ 5
H. D. Jain College, Ara vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 7 March, 2019
No. 3546 and 3569 is recorded in the revenue records as Gairmajarua Malguzar in the Khatiyan and
the land appertaining to Khata No. 1139, Khesra No. 3568 is recorded as Gairmajarua Aam, total
area of the land being 7.802 acres, hence out of the aforesaid area, 4.90 acres of land was selected
for the construction of the Engineering College and a proposal was transmitted by the Collector,
Bhojpur vide letter no. 691 dated 24.4.2017 with Record No. 8 of 2016-17. Consequently, the
Commissioner, Patna transferred 4.90 acres of land to the Science and Technology Patna High
Court CWJC No.11979 of 2017 dt.07-03-2019 Department, Government of Bihar without any cost
vide letter no. 434 dated 27.6.2017, as contained in Annexure C to the counter affidavit filed on
behalf of respondent nos. 4 and 5.
The Collector, Bhojpur, vide memo no. 1182 dated 5.7.2017, as contained in Annexure D to the
counter affidavit filed on behalf of respondent nos. 4 and 5 intimated to the Principal Secretary,
Science and Technology Department, Government of Bihar with regard to the decision of the
Commissioner. It is further submitted that as per Clause 7 of the indenture, in case of breach of
terms and conditions of the indenture, the grantee ceases to use the land and building and the
grantor shall have the right to resume the grant and re-enter thereon and take possession of the land
and building without any compensation. Clause 3 of the aforesaid indenture categorically specifies
that the grantee (the college) shall continue in use and occupation of the land and building so long
as the lands and buildings thereon are used exclusively for the purposes of educational institution.
Since the land was not used for seven decades and is not only recorded in the revenue records as
Gairmajarua Malgujar and Gairmajarua Aam, but it is still vacant, hence, the successor in interest of
the grantor, namely, Maharaja Kamal Singh after Patna High Court CWJC No.11979 of 2017
dt.07-03-2019 giving due notice to the College, took possession of the land in question and
expressed his willingness to give it to the Government for construction of the Engineering College
and consequently necessary communications were made by the successor in interest. The petitioner
also failed to make payment of rent to the grantor as stipulated in the indenture. The then
ex-landlord did not file any return nor any Jamabandi was created, hence the land in question vests
with the State. The successor in interest Maharaja Kamal Singh has not been made party, though
initially the University and the Divisional Commissioner, Patna were also not made party, and till
date the Magadh University has not been added as a party, hence the writ application is fit to be
dismissed for non- joinder of necessary party and above all, such issue involving disputed question
of fact cannot be resolved by this Court, hence the engineering college which is being constructed as
per the wishes of the successor in interest, cannot be interfered by this Court in the present
proceeding.
The principle objective of the indenture was for construction of college or educational institution,
hence the construction of engineering college is for the larger interest, and in tune with the desire of
the grantor, hence, as Patna High Court CWJC No.11979 of 2017 dt.07-03-2019 per the stipulation
of the indenture also, the construction of the engineering college cannot be faulted with and cannot
be questioned by the college which failed to use the land for nearly seven decades.
It is submitted on behalf of respondent nos. 2 and 3, the Principal Secretary, Science and
Technology Department, Government of Bihar and the Director, Science and Technology
Department, Government of Bihar that 4.90 acres of land was transferred under valid order of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/23988747/ 6
H. D. Jain College, Ara vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 7 March, 2019
Commissioner, Patna Division. The land is recorded as Gairmajarua Aam and Gairmajarua Malgujar
in the revenue records and Rs.73.13 crores have been sanctioned for the construction of the
engineering college on 4.90 acres of land in question.
It is submitted on behalf of respondent no. 7, the Commissioner, Patna Division that the land
appertaining to Khata No. 1138, Plot Nos. 3546 and 3569 is recorded as Gairmajarua Malik and land
appertaining to Khata No. 1139 Plot No. 3568 is recorded as Gair Majarua Aam in the records of
right. Admittedly, Maharaja Dumraon has not filed 'return' in terms of the Bihar Land Reforms Act,
1950, hence the land in question stood vested with the State Government. It is Patna High Court
CWJC No.11979 of 2017 dt.07-03-2019 further submitted that the indenture in question specifically
stipulates that the subject land will remain in use and in occupation of the College so long the same
is used exclusively for the purposes of educational institution. Though the petitioner has the right to
possess the same but in case of breach of the terms and conditions of the indenture, the grantor has
the right to resume the grant and since the land in question has not been utilized in terms of the
indenture, the Maharaja Dumraon has shown his willingness for establishment of engineering
college as proposed by the government on the land in question and also intimated that he has taken
possession of the land and has offered the said land for the construction of engineering college. It is
further submitted that the State Government, i.e., in the Department of Revenue and Land Reforms,
has resolved that the government land having area of 3 acres to 5 acres could be transferred from
one department to the other department of the State Government without any cost, by the
Divisional Commissioner and thus, in pursuance to the proposal of the District Magistrate, the
transfer of land in question has been made. The said resolution issued vide memo no. 359 dated
19.5.2014 has been brought on record as Annexure B to the Patna High Court CWJC No.11979 of
2017 dt.07-03-2019 counter affidavit filed by respondent no. 7.
In this hotly contested case, relying upon the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the University dated
5.2.2018, Mr. Arvind Nath Pandey, learned counsel submits that the University is opposing the
construction of engineering college as the entire property of the College vested with the Magadh
University, after its becoming a constituent unit of Magadh University and after carving out of Veer
Kuer Singh University, the entire land of the College has vested with the Veer Kunwar Singh
University. Hence, neither the Maharaja Dumraon nor the State has any right to snatch the land
which stood transferred to the University on the college becoming a constituent unit. It is further
submitted that there is future planning for construction of hostel and quarters for teaching and
non-teaching staff of the college, hence, referring to the provision under Section 23(e) of the Bihar
University Act, 1976, it is submitted that only the Syndicate has the authority to accept the transfer
on behalf of the University of any movable or immovable property. Hence, neither the Maharaja
Dumraon nor the State has any authority to transfer the land in question. It has been prayed that
the State may be directed not to disturb the peaceful possession of Patna High Court CWJC
No.11979 of 2017 dt.07-03-2019 the college over the land in question.
The stand of the University was opposed by the respondent nos. 4 and 5, as belated and as an
afterthought, as per the plea taken in the rejoinder filed on behalf of respondent nos. 4 and 5,
wherein it has been claimed that the land in question being Gairmajarua Aam and Gairmajarua
Malik land and failure to file return on the part of the Maharaja Dumraon as such the land vests
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/23988747/ 7
H. D. Jain College, Ara vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 7 March, 2019
with the State of Bihar.
On behalf of the University, the Registrar filed further counter affidavit on 13th March, 2018
annexing therewith the agreement executed at the time of take over. It is submitted that the lands
donated by the Maharaja Dumraon and Adinath Trust were handed over to the Magadh University.
The petitioner filed a supplementary affidavit, referring to the meeting of Staff Council dated
9.8.2018, where resolution was passed to keep the land of the college intact and to utilize the land in
question for construction of girls hostel, staff quarter under the 'Rastriya Uchcha Siksha Abhiyan'.
In the backdrop of the facts and circumstances discussed hereinabove, the following issue Patna
High Court CWJC No.11979 of 2017 dt.07-03-2019 requires consideration in the present writ
application-
(i) Whether the land in question is Gairmajarua Aam or Gairmajarua Malik and if
aforesaid is the nature of land in question, the Commissioner, Patna Division is
competent to transfer the same to the Department of Science and Technology,
Government of Bihar ?
(ii) Whether there has been renewal of grant after forty years as stipulated in the
indenture ?
(iii) Whether the Commissioner has the jurisdiction to transfer such land to the
Department of Science and Technology, Government of Bihar if the successor in
interest has expressed his desire for setting up of engineering college by the
government over the land in question ?
(iv) Whether the land donated by the Maharaja Dumraon on 22.2.1945 which
remained vacant for seventy years, can be re-entered by the successor in interest of
the grantor on failure to achieve the object mentioned in Clause 7 of the indenture
dated 22.2.1945 ?
(v) Whether the wish of the original Patna High Court CWJC No.11979 of 2017
dt.07-03-2019 grantor can be promoted by the successor in interest by expressing his
desire for setting up of engineering college by the State over the land which remained
vacant ?
(vi) Whether the land in question can be vested with the State on failure of Maharaja
Dumraon to file return in terms of Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950 ?
(vii) Whether the College has the right, title over the land in question on the basis of
indenture as contained in Annexure 1 to the writ application or has only the right of
enjoyment ?
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/23988747/ 8
H. D. Jain College, Ara vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 7 March, 2019
(viii) Whether the land bequeathed by Annexure 1 on terms and condition can
absolutely vest with the Magadh University on taking over the college as its
constituent unit and subsequently to the Veer Kunwar Singh University after creation
of the same in 1992?
This Court is dismayed to find that in spite of giving ample opportunities, neither the petitioner nor
the respondents have brought on record the certified copy of the 'indenture' by virtue of which the
petitioner claims the grant. Patna High Court CWJC No.11979 of 2017 dt.07-03-2019 Photo copies
as well as typed copies of the certified copy of the indenture have been filed but they reflect several
variations. This Court was inclined to dismiss the writ application on this ground alone, but in view
of the fact that so much indulgence has been given, and the existence of indenture, particularly its
Clause 3 and 7 are not in dispute, this Court decided to pass a detailed order in this matter.
The present writ application was filed initially without making the University, the successor in
interest, i.e., the present Maharaja Dumraon or the Commissioner, Patna Division or Magadh
University as party respondents. Though the Veer Kunwar Singh University and the Commissioner,
Patna Division were subsequently added as party respondents on the direction of this Court but till
date neither the successor in interest of grantor nor the Magadh University has been made a party
respondent.
This Court vide order dated 22.2.2018 directed the learned counsel for the respondent-State to bring
on record the R.S. Khatiyan and C.S. Khatiyan on affidavit but the same have not been brought on
record by either party till date.
On consideration of the entire materials as Patna High Court CWJC No.11979 of 2017 dt.07-03-2019
discussed herein above, this Court finds that the land in question was bequeathed on certain terms
and conditions. Those conditions are stipulated in Clause 3 and 7 of the indenture, as contained in
Annexure 1 to the writ application, which read as follows:
"3. The grantee shall continue in use and occupation of the land and buildings therein
without any interference on the part of the grantor so long as the lands and buildings
thereon are used exclusively for purposes of educational institutions."
"7. That when the grantee ceases to use the land and buildings thereon for the
purposes of the college or any public educational institution or on breach of any of
the terms and conditions of be grant, the grantor shall have the rights to resume the
grant and to re-enter hereon and take possession of the land with the buildings
thereon without payments of any compensations for the buildings, wells and other
structures thereon and the grantee shall put forward no objection to re-entry and
occupations of the land and buildings by the grantor."
Clause 3 of the indenture clearly stipulates that the grantee shall continue in use and occupation of
the land and building over the land so long as the lands and Patna High Court CWJC No.11979 of
2017 dt.07-03-2019 buildings are used exclusively for the purposes of educational institution. The
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/23988747/ 9
H. D. Jain College, Ara vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 7 March, 2019
land in question is lying vacant since last seven decades, hence, it is a clear violation of the Clause 3
of indenture. Clause 7 which has been referred as Clause 6 in Annexure 1, clearly stipulates that in
case of breach of terms and conditions of the indenture, the grantee ceases to use the land and
building thereon and the grantor shall have the right to resume the grant and to re-enter on the land
and take possession of the same without any compensation, particularly, if the grantee ceases to use
the land and building for the purposes of college and public educational institution. This is not in
dispute that the land has not been used for the purpose of college or any public educational
institution. Such stipulation further clarifies that the grant was not only for the running of H.D. Jain
College but for running 'public educational institutions' and hence, the establishment of engineering
college cannot be treated as contrary to objective of the indenture to establish 'public educational
institutions'. From further reading of the indenture, it appears that it was by way of lease initially for
the period of forty years ( from April, 1951 to 31st March, 1991) which was subject to renewal for
further forty years at the option of the second Patna High Court CWJC No.11979 of 2017
dt.07-03-2019 party, which reads as follows:
"1. That the First Period of the lease will be from forty years commencing from April,
1951 and ending with the 31st March, 1991.
2. That after the expiry of the first forty years the lease may be renewed and extended
for another forty years at the option of the Second Party."
Clause 7 of the indenture stipulates that on expiry of the lease or if the second party does not desire
to get the lease renewed for the second term then it will belong to the first party. There is nothing on
record to suggest that the petitioner opted for renewal option or it was renewed.
The above facts suggest that the College could not acquire an absolute right, title over the land in
question as the grantor had granted permission to utilize the land for certain purposes and for the
specific period and as such, the land cannot become the absolute property of H.D. Jain College, Ara
and if the petitioner could not acquire the absolute right over the property/land in question but only
the subject land/property was permitted to be used with certain conditions, consequently, the
Magadh University and Veer Patna High Court CWJC No.11979 of 2017 dt.07-03-2019 Kunwar
Singh University also could not acquire the absolute right over the land in question, hence, it cannot
be said that the land is vested with the Magadh University or its successor Veer Kunwar Singh
University.
The issue as regards the entry of land in question in the records of right as Gairmajarua Aam or
Gairmajarua Malgujar cannot be decided in the present writ proceeding. The entry in the records of
right is taken as correct one, unless it is declared otherwise by the competent court of law. The claim
of the respondent State that the land in question is recorded as Gairmajarua Aam or Gairmajarua
Malgujar, has not been denied by the petitioner. There is no issue in the present writ application for
the declaration of the entry of the land being incorrect, hence, this Court refrains from deciding such
issue.

H. D. Jain College, Ara vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 7 March, 2019
So far as the vesting of Zamindari on failure of the then Maharaja Dumraon in filing return is
concerned, it cannot be decided in the present proceeding, rather it can only be decided in an
appropriate proceeding. However, this Court cannot approve the contention of the State that the
land has been vested in the State for failure to file return, as they have not resorted to statutory
provision of Section 4(h) of the Patna High Court CWJC No.11979 of 2017 dt.07-03-2019 Bihar Land
Reforms Act, 1950.
Thus, the only issue that remains in the present writ application, is of balancing the conflicting
interest involved in the present matter between the interest of the petitioner, beneficiary of the grant
vide Annexure 1 vis-a- vis the successor in interest of the grantor, who is not party in the present
proceeding.
The doctrine of Cypres is usually interpreted as a rule providing for interpretation of instruments, in
equity, as nearly as possible, in conformity to the intention of the testator, unless literal construction
is illegal, impracticable or impossible. The beneficiary of the grant vide Annexure 1, i.e. the
successor in interest of the grantor is not a party in the present proceeding, whereas, he has definite
interest on account of dedication of land for specific purpose, hence the doctrine of Cypres gets
attracted in case of frustration of object.
Moreover, both testamentary and non-
testamentary gifts for public charitable purposes must be saved by a wider intervention of Court, as
public interest is served that way, as has been laid down by the Apex Court in the case of State of
U.P. Vs. Bansi Dhar and Ors., reported in Patna High Court CWJC No.11979 of 2017 dt.07-03-2019
AIR 1974 SC 1084. From the perusal of Clauses of the indenture dated 22.2.1945, it becomes
apparent that the larger intention was to give the property for the purposes of establishment of
educational institution, which very well includes the setting up of Engineering College.
The issue whether the re-entry of the grantor is automatic or only on giving notice, or there should
be specific procedure for re-entry, on failure of the object, the Court, in peculiar facts and
circumstances, cannot take any decision in the instant case as the Maharaja Dumraon is not a party
in the present proceeding.
The other conflicting interest is between the interest of the petitioner and the interest of the State to
set up an engineering college over the land in question to stop brain drain. In ordinary situation, in
the matters of conflict of interest, the larger interest would prevail. Since the land in question was
donated for the purpose of promotion of educational institution, the construction of engineering
college over the land in question is definitely in furtherance of the object of indenture.
What is important in the matter of promoting the object of grant vide Annexure 1 is to achieve the
object of Patna High Court CWJC No.11979 of 2017 dt.07-03-2019 promotion of educational
institution serving larger public interest. The intention of the grantor was to promote the extension
of educational institution but for the several decades the land in question was kept without use and
now a stand has been taken by the respondent State to set up an engineering college, as such, there

H. D. Jain College, Ara vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 7 March, 2019
is no conflict of object of Annexure 1. By setting up of engineering college the larger public purpose
is served, whether H.D. Jain College sets up educational institution or the State Government sets up
engineering college, the name behind the setting up the educational institution is secondary. This
Court is of the view that setting up of public educational institution is in larger public interest and it
will benefit the public at large, hence, it would be in furtherance of the object of indenture as
contained in Annexure 1, particularly in the backdrop of the fact that there is no material on record
as to renewal of the grant after forty years and the land being not used by the college for seven
decades; rather it is admitted position that the land in question is still vacant.
Under the aforesaid circumstances, the Court finds that the jurisdiction under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India is not to frustrate the public purpose but Patna High Court CWJC No.11979 of
2017 dt.07-03-2019 to uphold the public purpose, particularly when the successor in interest
Maharaja Dumraon, in so many words, has expressed his willingness for construction of engineering
college on the land in question. It is to be noted here that the Senior Counsel for the petitioner has
heavily relied upon judgment of the Apex Court reported in AIR 1989 SC 997. On scrutiny of the
facts and circumstances, this Court is of the considered view that the judgment cited by the
petitioner as referred above is not attracted in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case as
discussed above. Hence, this Court is not inclined to interfere in the matter for the following
reasons:
(i) There is no conflict of object behind the stipulation made by the grantor in the
indenture contained in Annexure 1, by setting up of engineering college.
(ii) There is no renewal of grant after forty years.
(iii) The land in question was kept vacant for seventy years.
(iv) The successor in interest of the grantor has expressed his desire for setting up of
engineering college by the State Government.
(v)The College and the University have promissory right in terms of Annexure 1 and
they have not acquired absolute Patna High Court CWJC No.11979 of 2017
dt.07-03-2019 right, title over the land in question.
(vi) The land was recorded in the revenue records as Gairmajarua Aam and
Gairmajarua Malgujar.
(vii) It has been held by a Four Judge bench of the Apex Court in the case of DLF
Housing Construction (P) Ltd Vs. Delhi Municipal Corpn. And others (1976) 3 SCC
160 that the question related to the right of ownership over a land, where the basic
facts are disputed and complicated question of law and fact are involved requiring
leading of evidence, the writ court is not a proper forum for seeking relief.
Paragraph 18 of the said judgment reads as follows:

H. D. Jain College, Ara vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 7 March, 2019
"18. In our opinion, in a case where the basic facts are disputed, and complicated
questions of law and fact depending on evidence are involved the writ court is not the
proper forum for seeking relief. The right course of the High Court to follow was to
dismiss the writ petition on this preliminary ground, without entering upon the
merits of the case. In the absence of firm and adequate factual foundation, it was
hazardous to embark upon a determination of the points involved. On this short
ground while setting aside the findings of the High Court, we would dismiss both the
writ petition and the appeal with costs. The appellants may if so advised, seek their
remedy by a regular suit."
Patna High Court CWJC No.11979 of 2017 dt.07-03-2019 Considering the facts and circumstances
discussed hereinabove and noticing the serious disputes as to right, title and interest, this Court is of
the considered view that the discretionary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India
is not the appropriate forum to decide such disputed questions.
Accordingly, this writ application is
dismissed.
