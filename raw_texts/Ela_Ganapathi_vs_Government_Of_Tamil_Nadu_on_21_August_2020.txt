COMMON ORDER
Heard the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners including those who are permitted to make
submissions and the learned Advocate General appearing for the State.
http://www.judis.nic.in W.P.Nos.11366 & 11467 of 2020
2. These writ petitions have been filed to quash the Press Release No.583, dated 13.08.2020 of the
second respondent and consequently direct the first respondent to permit installation and
procession of Vinayaka idols by following social distancing norms.
3. By the impugned release in Release No.583, dated 13.08.2020, which is a publication of the
Government Order passed in G.O.Ms.No.418, dated 14.08.2020, the procession during Vinayagar
Chathurthi scheduled on 22.08.2020 and the consequential activities sought to be controlled /
regulated keeping in view of the pandemic situation prevailing.
4. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioners submitted that they do not wish to undertake
any public procession of any nature, however, individuals will have to be allowed to perform their
religious ceremonies which is being followed over the decades. This includes keeping the Vinayagar
idols before the house, before the temples and immersion in the water bodies. Since this practice is
an age old one and being the final act after the performance of other ceremonies the idol of Lord
Vinayagar cannot be kept at home and only to be immersed, appropriate directions may be issued in
this regard.
http://www.judis.nic.in W.P.Nos.11366 & 11467 of 2020
5. The learned counsel submitted that the organisations which they represent would extend fullest
cooperation to the Government towards the smooth conduct of the religious performances.
6. The learned Advocate General appearing for the State submitted that the challenge made to the
Government Order passed has already been upheld by the Madurai Bench of this Court where
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/176046851/ 3
Ela. Ganapathi vs Government Of Tamil Nadu on 21 August, 2020
processions as been sought for. There is an apprehension of law and order problem apart from the
pandemic situation if procession is permitted. Therefore, though individual activities is not
prohibited, any order may give an impression that the orgainsations have been permitted to go on a
procession and thereafter involved in mass immersion with a larger gathering.
7. At the outset, we are of the view that the order passed by the Hon'ble Madurai Bench of this Court
may not have a bearing on this case, as a larger prayer has been sought for and that too for a
procession. Though the petitioners sought for a larger relief, learned counsel appearing for all the
parties fairly submitted that they would not insist upon either mass procession or mass immersion,
however individuals will have to be http://www.judis.nic.in W.P.Nos.11366 & 11467 of 2020
permitted to undertake and perform the religious ceremonies on the auspicious day as aforesaid.
8. We find that the Government Order passed in G.O.Ms.No.418, dated 14.08.2020 of Public (Law &
Order.B) Department is by taking into consideration of two factors. The first is on the pandemic
situation prevailing and the other law and order. Now the restriction imposed by way of lockdown
has been relaxed considerably. Therefore the movement of the public during the time permitted is
not restricted. Once that is done and in the light of the statement made by the learned Advocate
General there is no difficulty for the individual to perform his religious function, we do not find any
prohibition in the impugned order. Clause (ii) in paragraph 2 of the G.O. has to be read only to mean
to apply to the public procession and therefore the public immersion.
9. Thus, there is no difficulty in holding that the practice which has been followed for decades by the
individual having faith either by placing the idol after performance of the ceremony in front of their
house, temples and immersion in water bodies will not have any bearing to either the pandemic
situation or the law and order. At the risk of repetition, we wish to http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.Nos.11366 & 11467 of 2020 say that it is the individual who does this practices and therefore
there is no possibility of any spread of pandemic. Secondly, it is these individuals who are going to
immerse and not the organisation. Therefore, the regular restriction with respect to the number of
persons also would apply to these cases.
10. The learned Advocate General appearing for the State has submitted that the prohibition of
usage of beach is for the entire beach. In any case, there may be a problem more so in the area
starting from Santhome beach and ending with Napier Bridge.
11. Considering the said submission, we are of the view that the said prohibition may not have an
application when the individual wants to perform the religious obligations in tune with Article 25 of
the Constitution of India. The restriction has been imposed only with the view of stopping the
spread of the pandemic. The pandemic is likely to spread on two grounds viz., when more people
commegrate in a particular place and they stay on the said place thereafter. We are not having such
a situation now. As stated, no group of persons are allowed to undertake the exercise stated supra.
Secondly, even those individual namely family members who are to perform http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.Nos.11366 & 11467 of 2020 the religious obligation, they can at best go to the water body
including the sea, drop the idol and thereafter come back. Therefore, there is no question of staying
back and using the said place. This is also subject to the restriction which is inclusive of the time
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/176046851/ 4
Ela. Ganapathi vs Government Of Tamil Nadu on 21 August, 2020
limit and social distancing. Therefore, we are of the view that the bar to usage of beaches impugned
in the G.O. will not have any application to the aforesaid activities. Further, from the point starting
from Santhome upto Napier bridge, there shall not be any such activity in the said stretch in the
beach in view of the apprehension raised.
12. There are one more issue of much important which we are concerned, pertaining to Vinayagar
idol itself. The idol is prepared by the local artisans. These idols are to be used only once in an year
during the Vinayagar Chathurthi festival. Almost all the idols are made up of clay. The longevity of
the clay that is being used in making of the idol is very limited, it would not last for more than few
days. Therefore, the idols already manufactured by the local artisans would get lost and this cannot
be used for any other purpose. The scores of local artisans who are involved in this business, their
business is drastically affected due to the pandemic and now they will be reduced to starvation and
penury. Hence, on this account also, we are of the view that the directions are necessary as they
would facilitate http://www.judis.nic.in W.P.Nos.11366 & 11467 of 2020 the purpose of usage of the
clay idols manufactured by the local artisans.
13. Accordingly, the writ petitions stands disposed of with the following directions:-
(i) Individuals are permitted to have their Vinayaga idols after the performance of the
ceremony in front of their respective houses.
(ii) Individuals are permitted to drop the Vinayaga idols at the entry point of the
temples. This direction is issued by taking note of Clause (3) of para 2 of the order
under challenge which does not prohibit even the worship before the temples coming
under certain categories.
(iii) Individuals are allowed to immerse the idols which can be carried out only by a
single person in the water bodies. No such activities shall be carried out in the stretch
between Santhome to Napier bridge.
(iv) The permission given is restricted only to the individuals alone and therefore,
there is a total bar to undertake the same activities by organisations.
http://www.judis.nic.in W.P.Nos.11366 & 11467 of 2020
(v)The aforesaid directions are subject to the regular restriction which are already in vogue
including the time restriction and the social distancing.
(vi) For any violation of these directions, the respondents are at liberty to take appropriate action in
the manner known to law as they are applicable only to the individual cases alone.
Consequently, the connected miscellaneous petitions are closed. No costs.
