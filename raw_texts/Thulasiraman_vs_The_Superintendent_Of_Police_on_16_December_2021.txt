For Petitioner : Mrs.P.Yasmin Begum
For Respondents : Mr.E.Antony Sahaya Prabahar,
Addl. Public Prosecutor.
ORDER
Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the
respondents.
2.The petitioner is an youngster aged about 25 years. He is figuring as an accused in Crime No.154 of
2019 and Crime No.564 of 2020 registered on the file of the Naciarkoil Police Station, Thanjavur
District. The petitioner's name has been included in the history sheet maintained by the third
respondent.
Seeking deletion of his name in the history sheet, this writ petition came to be filed.
3.The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that under PSO 749, certain persons
shall be classified as suspects and history sheet shall be opened for them under orders of the
Superintendent of Police. The categories are as follows:-
749. Suspects ---
(1) The following persons shall be classed as suspects and History Sheets shall be
opened for them under orders of the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
Superintendent or Divisional Officer, if so empowered by the Superintendent :—
(a) Persons once convicted under any Section of the Indian Penal Code are
considered to be likely to commit crime;
(b) Persons, not convicted, but believed to be addicted to crime.
(2) The following persons may be classified as rowdies and Rowdy Sheets (Form No.
112) may be opened for them under the orders of the Superintendent or
Sub-Divisional Officer.
(a) Persons, who habitually commit, attempt to commit or abet the commission of
offences involving a breach of peace.
(b) Persons bound over under Sections 106 and 107 Criminal Procedure Code.
(c) Persons who have been convicted under Section 75 of the Madras City Police Act
or twice in two consecutive years under Section 3 Clause 12 of the Town Nuisance
Act.

Thulasiraman vs The Superintendent Of Police on 16 December, 2021
(d) Persons who are illicit distillers and known purveyors of liquor. (G.O.Ms. No. 3461, Home 10th
Dec, 1956.)
(e) Persons either convicted under Section 49-A of the Madras City Police Act, 1888 (Madras Act III
of 1888) or under Section (4) of The Madras Gaming Act, 1930, (Madras Act III of 1930), or
reasonably suspected to be habitually committing or abetting the commission of such offences.
(3) The fact that a History Sheet has been opened for a suspect, other than an ordinary criminal
shall be kept confidential. (G.O.No.480, Judl, 10th August, 1921) https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
(4) All registered rowdies should be kept under the same type of watch as envisaged for registered
suspects. The names of History Sheeted rowdies should be entered in the Station Check Register of
K.Ds and the rowdies should be checked regularly by beat Police Constables in rural Police Stations
and by rowdy patrols in large towns as also by the Sub-Inspector (Law & Order). The checking
however should be discreetly done by the method of enquiries and not in the manner of domiciliary
checks.
(5) Inspectors and Divisional Officers when they visit the area should make their own independent
enquiries and note their findings in the History Sheets and in Inspection Reports, if any.
(6) All reports against notorious rowdies entered in the General Diary of the Station or matters
brought to light on enquiries in the petitions should be entered against them in the personal sheets
and should be dated.
(7) Rowdies are often employed for committing breaches of peace and for intimidating opponents in
times of political or communal tension. Inspectors of Police should take effective and timely action
to control their activities. The active ones among these should be dealt with appropriately under
section 110 (a) and (f) of the Criminal Procedure Code or under section 160 IPC or under section 75
of the Madras City Police Act and section 106 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
(8) Besides registered rowdies for whom separate sheets are maintained, there are a set of
anti-social elements in every street and village, who intimidate the local people and exploit them for
their selfish https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ends. They are often believed to be keeping brothel
houses clandestinely or promoting prohibition offences or offences under the Gaming Act.
Sometimes they have political backing also. The activities of these persons also require vigilant
watch and check. For this purpose a register in Form No. 112 shall be maintained in all Police
Stations. The categories of persons which should be entered into the registers are:
(a) All persons for whom rowdy sheets are maintained under Order No. 749.
(b) Anti-social elements who intimidate people and exploit them for selfish ends, or
actively promote communal disharmony.
(c) Persons believed to be keeping brothels or opium dens or promoting offences
under the Gaming Act.

(d) Persons bound over under Section 110(e) and (f) Criminal Procedure Code.
(e) Persons convicted under Section 294, I.P.C.
(f) Known drunkards.”
4.The petitioner obviously will not fall under any of the aforesaid categories. The petitioner did not
come under the adverse notice of the police prior to 2019. He had not come under adverse notice of
the respondents after 07.05.2020 also. It is also seen that both the cases relate to commission of
offences against a specified individual. The petitioner had not committed any offence involving
breach of peace. Therefore, retaining the petitioner's name in the history sheet would affect his
interest and future.

5.In these circumstances, the respondents are directed to remove the petitioner's name from the
history sheet/rowdy list maintained by the third respondent forthwith and without any delay. The
writ petition is allowed. No costs.
