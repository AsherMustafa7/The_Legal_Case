Dr. L. Ranjit Singh vs Dr. Hemam Priyosakhi Devi on 19 January, 2023
[1] By judgment dated 19.12.2022, a learned Judge of this Court allowed W.P. (C) No. 867 of 2022
and set aside the order dated 12.10.2022 issued by the Under Secretary, Ministry of Health & Family
Welfare, Government of India, whereby additional charge of the post of Director, Regional Institute
of Medical W.A. No. 131 of 2022 Page 1 Sciences (RIMS), Imphal, was entrusted to respondent No. 5
in the writ petition. The learned Judge observed, however, that quashing of the said order would not
preclude the official respondents from making a fresh in-charge arrangement in respect of the
vacant post of Director, RIMS, Imphal, strictly in terms of the provisions of Rule 12(1)(iii) of the
Rules and Regulations of RIMS, Imphal. Aggrieved thereby, respondent No. 5 in the writ petition
filed this appeal. [2] Heard Mr. HS Paonam, learned senior counsel, appearing for the appellant;
Mr. BP Sahu, learned senior counsel, appearing for respondent No. 1, viz., the petitioner in W.P. (C)
No. 867 of 2022; and Mr. Kh. Samarjit, learned DSGI, appearing for the Union of India and RIMS,
Imphal.
[3] Interference by the learned Judge, as is evident from the judgment dated 19.12.2022, was
primarily on the ground that Rule 12(1)(iii) of the Rules and Regulations of RIMS, Imphal, was not
followed. This Rule made it clear that in respect of an unanticipated vacancy in the post of Director,
RIMS, Imphal, the Administrative Ministry was empowered to make an additional charge
arrangement, subject to the condition that the officer to whom such additional charge is assigned is
the senior-most officer in the next lower grade. The learned Judge found that, in terms of the
tentative inter-se seniority list of Professors in RIMS, Imphal, obtaining as on 01.07.2022,
respondent No. 5 in the writ petition stood at serial No. 4, while the petitioner figured at serial No. 2
above him. It is not in dispute even now that no final seniority list is available at the moment and
respondent No.1 herein was shown as senior to the appellant in the tentative seniority list. [4]
Further, the learned Judge found that the authorities had not even considered the cases of the other
senior Professors while placing respondent No. 5 W.A. No. 131 of 2022 Page 2 as the in-charge
Director of RIMS, Imphal. It was on this basis that the learned Judge invalidated the order dated
12.10.2022 passed in favour of respondent No. 5 and left it open to the authorities to make interim
in-charge arrangements strictly as per Rule 12(1)(iii) of the Rules and Regulations of RIMS, Imphal.
[5] It appears that, pursuant thereto, the Deputy Secretary, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare,
Government of India, issued order dated 16.01.2023 which reads as follows: -
"No. U. 12025/15/2020-NE-Part (1) Government of India Ministry of Health &
Family Welfare Nirman Bhawan, New Delhi Dated: 16th January, 2023 ORDER In
compliance of Hon'ble High Court order dated 19.12.2022 in W.P. (C) No. 867 of
2022 filed by Dr. H. Priyosakhi Devi vs UOI & others, this Ministry's order No.
U.12025/53/2022-NE dated 12.10.2022 entrusting additional charge to the post of
Director, RIMS to Dr. L. Ranjit Singh, Prof. Obst & Gynae, RIMS, Imphal is hereby
cancelled.
2. The additional charge to the post of Director, RIMS, Imphal is hereby entrusted to
Dr. H. Priyosakhi Devi, Prof., ENT, RIMS, Imphal upto 11.04.2023 or till regular
appointment of Director, RIMS, Imphal or till further orders, whichever is the
earliest.

[6] In the light of the aforestated development during the pendency of this case, the issue that arises
presently is as to what is left in this appeal for adjudication on merits. Be it noted that the learned
Judge did not issue any positive direction in favour of the petitioner in W.P. (C) No. 867 of 2022 to
the effect that she should be entrusted with the additional charge of the post of Director, RIMS,
W.A. No. 131 of 2022 Page 3 Imphal, and merely left it to the authorities concerned to do the needful
strictly in accordance with Rule 12(1)(iii). In compliance with this direction, the Government of
India, in its wisdom, has now entrusted the additional charge of the post of Director, RIMS, Imphal,
to respondent No. 1 herein.
[7] Mr. HS Paonam, learned senior counsel, would contend that it would be necessary to examine
whether the cases of other senior professors were considered when the decision was taken to entrust
the additional charge to respondent No. 1 herein. However, in our considered opinion, any grievance
that the appellant may have with regard to the later order dated 16.01.2023 would constitute a fresh
cause of action as the decision embodied therein was taken by the authorities independently, in
compliance with the direction of the learned Judge that they should follow the relevant Rule
scrupulously. As to whether there was any error on the part of the authorities in doing so would not
fall for consideration in this appeal and would necessarily have to be subjected to judicial review by
way of independent proceedings instituted in accordance with law.
Leaving it open to the appellant to do so, if so advised, W.A. No. 131 of 2022 is dismissed.
In the circumstances, there shall be no order as to costs.
