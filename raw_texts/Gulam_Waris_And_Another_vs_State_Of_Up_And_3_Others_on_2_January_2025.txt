3. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the impugned FIR has been lodged on
false/vexatious/mischievous allegations and no offences are made out against the petitioners.
4. Learned A.G.A., on instructions, states that the police authorities in compliance of the directions
issued by this Court in Criminal Misc. Bail Application No.45784 of 2020 (Ajeet Chaudhary vs. State
of U.P. and another), reported in AIR ONLINE 2021 All. 1149 and with a view to implement the
provisions of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (Amended
2015), have served the notices upon the informant. Learned AGA has further opposed the prayer for
quashing of the FIR, which discloses cognizable offence.
5. The correctness of the allegations would have to be tested on the basis of the materials collected
during the course of investigation and therefore, in view of the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of State of Haryana and others vs. Bhajan Lal and others, 1992 Supp. (1) SCC 335
and M/s Neeharika Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. vs. State of Maharashtra, AIR 2021 SC 1918 and in
Special Leave to Appeal (Crl.) No.3262/2021 (Leelavati Devi @ Leelawati & another vs. the State of
Uttar Pradesh) decided on 07.10.2021 and the latest judgment in Criminal Appeal No. 843 of 2024
arising out of Special Leave Petition (Crl.) No. 10913 of 2023 (Directorate of Enforcement vs. Niraj
Tyagi & ors.), no case has been made out for interference with the impugned first information
report.
6. Confronted with the situation, learned counsel for the petitioners submits that he does not want
to press the writ petition and the same may be dismissed as not pressed but leave may be accorded
to press the bail/ anticipatory bail.
7. The writ petition is dismissed as not pressed leaving it open for the petitioners to apply before the
competent court for bail/ anticipatory bail in accordance with law.
