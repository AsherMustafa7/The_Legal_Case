2. The learned Counsel for the petitioners, despite, the opportunities granted is not ready. These
petitions are pending from the year 2017 to quash the final report filed for the various offences as
stated above. The crux of the allegation indicate that the accused unlawfully gathered and
committed assault and also caused damage to the property and also made an attempt on life. The
entire occurrence took place to prevent the weaker section of the society from worshiping in the
temple and also committed mischief by fire. When the prosecution materials indicate that serious
allegations are made against the accused, this Court cannot entertain these type of petitions. These
petitions have been filed only to stall the proceedings before the trial Court. In such view of the
matter, this Court is of the view that this is not a fit case to quash the proceedings and this petition is
liable to be dismissed.
