the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920.
vi) To any other relief or reliefs for
which the petitioners are found to be entitled

are that the petitioners are the citizens of the Unites States of
America and holders of passports bearing Nos. A07196056 and

669732407. The petitioners have been made accused in
Jaynagar P.S. Case No. 323 of 2024 registered under Sections
14(b) and 14-C of the Foreigners Act, 1946 and Section 12(3) of
the Passports Act, 1967. The informant of the FIR received an
information that in a white car bearing Registration No. BR-01
PM-6836, which was proceeding from India towards Nepal, two
foreign citizens were travelling. One Sonu Kumar Gupta came
and stated that foreigner citizens were his relatives. On enquiry,
the informant came to know about the petitioners and one Ram
Hriday Singh who were sitting in the car. On further enquiry, the
petitioners mentioned that on 04.11.2024, they had come from
Nepal to Jaynagar with their relative, Sonu Kumar Gupta, and
after staying in Jaynagar for four days they were returning to
Nepal on 09.11.2024. They also stated that they have been
holding valid passports and Visas for Nepal and also e-tourist
Patna High Court CR. WJC No.530 of 2025 dt.26-09-2025
4/22
Visa for entering India. However, it transpired from perusal of
the passports that the passports did not contain any Indian
Immigration Stamp, leading to inference that petitioners were
staying in the country illegally. The passports of the petitioners
were seized along with car in which they were travelling and,
accordingly, a seizure list was prepared. Thereafter, Jaynagar
P.S. Case No. 323 of 2024 was registered.
It also transpires that pursuant to the FIR, Charge
Sheet No. 613 of 2024, dated 30.11.2024, was submitted under
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/90227227/ 3
Craig Allen Moore @ Crag Allen Moore vs The State Of Bihar Through Its Home ... on 26 September, 2025
Sections 14(b) and 14-C of the Foreigners Act, 1946 (for short
'the Foreigners Act') and Section 12(3) of the Passports Act,
1967 (for short 'the Passports Act'). It further transpires that
prior to that, the petitioners were granted bail on 18.02.2024 by
the court of learned Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM),
Madhubani with certain conditions and one of the conditions
was that they would not leave the country without permission of
the court or during the pendency of the trial. Thereafter, the
petitioners filed an application for release of their passports and
vide order dated 26.11.2024, learned court of CJM, Madhubani
directed to release of their passports. It further transpires that the
learned CJM, Madhubani took cognizance of the charge-sheet
on 16.12.2024 under Sections 14(b) and 14-C of the Foreigners
Patna High Court CR. WJC No.530 of 2025 dt.26-09-2025
5/22
Act and Section 12(3) of the Passports Act. Subsequently, on
02.01.2025
, charges were framed against the petitioners under Sections 14(b) and 14-C of the Foreigners Act
and Section 12(3) of the Passports Act.
03. Ms. Shrishti Singh, learned counsel for the petitioners, submitted that the petitioners are
holders of valid passports as well as valid Visa and the facts disclosed in the FIR do not constitute
the offences with which the petitioners have been charged. The allegations made in the FIR, even if
they are taken at their face value and accepted in its entirety, do not prima facie constitute any
offence. Moreover, when there is specific provision under Section 3(2)(c) of the Foreigners Act and
Section 5 of the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 (for short 'the Act of 1920') providing an
efficacious redress, i.e., of deportation, the FIR and subsequent proceedings against the petitioners
suffer from illegality and are liable to be quashed. In the given facts and circumstances, the
petitioners should have been deported under Section 5 of the Act of 1920. Learned counsel further
submitted that when special law governs the alleged offence, the petitioners could not have been
charged under the Foreigners Act and the Passports Act. It is the settled law that provisions of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/90227227/ 4
Craig Allen Moore @ Crag Allen Moore vs The State Of Bihar Through Its Home ... on 26 September, 2025
special law on the subject of specific Patna High Court CR. WJC No.530 of 2025 dt.26-09-2025
legislation must prevail over the provisions of general law, which in the present case is the
Foreigners Act and the Passports Act. Learned counsel further submitted that the case of the
petitioners would be covered under Section 5 of the Act of 1920 and rules framed thereunder read
with Section 3(2)(c) of the Foreigners Act. If the petitioners were found in possession of valid
passports and Visas and if the passports were not endorsed with immigration stamp, the course
open to the authority was to deport the petitioners and this Court, after quashing the criminal
proceedings against the petitioners, needs to pass orders for deportation of the petitioners.
04. Learned counsel further submitted that petitioner no. 1, Craig Allen Moore, suffers from
esophageal cancer and he needs to be regularly seen by his GI Oncologist and has been under
continuous treatment in UCSF Hospital, San Francisco, California. Learned counsel further
submitted that a certificate has been issued by Consulate General of the Unites States of America at
Kolkata, confirming the fact that the petitioner no. 1 is at risk of recurrence of cancer and his
presence in United State is required for clinical follow ups. Thus, the petitioner no. 1 has an
imminent threat to his life, if he is not allowed to see his Oncologist for follow up of his cancer.
Learned counsel Patna High Court CR. WJC No.530 of 2025 dt.26-09-2025 further submitted that
petitioner no. 2, who is the wife of the petitioner no. 1, was born in Nepal and has relatives in India.
The petitioners arrived in Nepal on 29.10.2024 and they decided to travel to India during the holy
festival of Chhath Puja. The petitioners obtained Visas which were the electronic travel
authorization. The petitioners were issued their respective Visas on 24.10.2024 with validity period
till 23.10.2029. Accordingly, they entered into India through Betaunha Border Out Post on
04.11.2024, where their passports and e-Visas were examined and they were allowed to enter the
country. After the Chhath Puja, on 09.11.2024, when the petitioners had been returning through the
same outpost, they were detained and objections were raised on their documentation. The only
allegation against the petitioners is that their passports bore no Immigration Stamps. But, for the
same, there was nothing which could have done by the petitioners as they duly submitted their
passports while entering India and it was incumbent upon the Authorities to stamp their passports.
Learned counsel next submitted that the entire episode shows no violation of provisions under
which the petitioners have been charged and no offence is made out against the petitioners. No
incriminating evidence has come up against the petitioners for having committed any offence, which
Patna High Court CR. WJC No.530 of 2025 dt.26-09-2025 is also evident from the seizure list in
which nothing illegal or nefarious has been seized. The only grievance against the petitioners is that
though they had a Visa, it was not stamped by Indian Immigration and for such infraction, special
provision exists in the Act of 1920 in the form of Section 5, which empowers the Government to
remove such person from the country. Moreover, the Authorities are also empowered under Section
3(2)(c) of the Foreigners Act to remove any foreigner from the country. Learned counsel further
submitted that pursuant to the registration of the FIR, the matter had travelled far and reached the
stage of recording of evidence of prosecution witnesses, however, as the FIR does not disclose
commission of any offence, subsequent proceedings against the petitioners are without jurisdiction
and also need to be quashed and this Court, under its writ jurisdiction, is empowered to quash the
whole proceedings starting from registration of the FIR till the stage of criminal trial against the
petitioners to secure the ends of justice.

05. Learned counsel for the petitioners further submitted that due to deteriorating medical
condition of petitioner no. 1, the petitioners were compelled to file a criminal writ seeking issuance
of exit permit for themselves and vide Patna High Court CR. WJC No.530 of 2025 dt.26-09-2025
order dated 25.03.2025 passed in Criminal Writ Jurisdiction No. 460 of 2025, a Co-ordinate Bench
of this Court permitted the petitioners to travel to United States of America subject to certain
conditions. The petitioners were further directed to report before on or before 29.07.2025. Further,
vide order dated 16.07.2025, the deadline was extended till 15.09.2025 and thereafter, vide order
dated 10.09.2025, it was again extended till 15.12.2025.
06. Learned counsel for the petitioners further submitted that the case of the petitioners is covered
by a Division Bench judgment of this Court in the case of Fadi Fadel Vs. The State of Bihar through
its Home Secretary 7 Ors., 2018 (2) PLJR 400, wherein the Hon'ble Division Bench not only
quashed the FIR but also quashed the subsequent orders taking cognizance as well as framing of
charge as well as whole proceeding arising out of said FIR and ordered for deportation of the
petitioner after holding that the offences alleged in the FIR were not attracted. Learned counsel
further submitted that in the said case, the petitioners lost his way and stayed into the Indian
territory and while trying to return, he was apprehended and charge-sheet was submitted under
Sections 467, 468, 471 and 13, 14B of Foreigners Act. The Hon'ble Patna High Court CR. WJC
No.530 of 2025 dt.26-09-2025 Division Bench, finding that no offence under any of the aforesaid
provisions was made out against the petitioner, quashed the entire criminal proceeding against him.
But, the case of the petitioners stands on much better footing. In the present case, the petitioners are
having valid Visas and only on account of the fact that their passports were not stamped by the
Immigration Official, they have been made to face trial.
07. Learned counsel next referred to the decision of the learned Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in
the case of Williams Rebecca @ William Rebecca @ Rebecca Williams Vs. State of Bihar & Ors,
2022(4) BLJ 710, wherein a Canadian citizen entered into India without an Indian Visa and charge-
sheet was submitted under Section 447 of IPC, Section 14(b) of the Foreigners Act and Section 52 of
Disaster Management Act, 2005. However, the learned Co-ordinate Bench held that the
investigating agency as well as the learned Judicial Magistrate have completely erred in lodging of
the FIR and passing of the order taking cognizance and framing of charge against the petitioner
under the aforesaid provisions and finding that none of the ingredients of those provisions were
available against the petitioner, the Co-ordinate Bench went on to quash the FIR, the order taking
cognizance as well as the order framing charge Patna High Court CR. WJC No.530 of 2025
dt.26-09-2025 against the petitioner. Lastly, the learned counsel relied on decision of another
Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in the case of Farida Malik @ Sana Akhtar Vs. State of Bihar & Ors.,
2024(4) BLJ 71. Even in that case, the petitioner was entered in India without any valid Visa and
had been trying to cross India- Nepal Border to go to Nepal. Charge sheet has been submitted under
Sections 14/14(b) of the Foreigners Act and Sections 419 and 420 of IPC. In the said decision, the
learned Co-ordinate Bench held that there was no reason to lodge F.I.R. against the petitioner, to
take cognizance on the basis of charge-sheet by the learned Magistrate, to frame charge against the
petitioner and to compel her to face trial since the ingredients of the offences under which the
cognizance had been taken and charges had been framed were not present. Thus, the learned
counsel submitted that the case of the petitioners stands on much better footing to the aforesaid
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/90227227/ 6
Craig Allen Moore @ Crag Allen Moore vs The State Of Bihar Through Its Home ... on 26 September, 2025
cited decisions.
08. Counter affidavits have been filed on behalf of the respondents. In the counter affidavit filed by
the State, it has been merely submitted that the petitioners have been rightly charge-sheeted and
they do not deserve any relief. In the counter affidavit filed on behalf of respondent-Union of India,
it has been submitted that the passports of the petitioners were not Patna High Court CR. WJC
No.530 of 2025 dt.26-09-2025 properly endorsed which pointed to the fact that they resided
illegally in this country since the passports of the petitioners did not contain immigration stamp
which is necessary for any foreign national entering into the territory of India in terms of extant
rules. Therefore, for illegal entry into this country, the petitioners were liable to be face criminal
prosecution. It has also been submitted that the petitioners in complete contravention of Section
14(b) 7 14(c) of the Foreigners Act and Section 12(3) of the Passports Act illegally resides in the State
within the the territory of India. Therefore, the learned trial court after proper appreciation of
records of the case, passed order of cognizance dated 16.12.2024 and rightly passed the order dated
02.01.2025 framing charges against the petitioners. It has also been submitted in the counter
affidavit that quashing of an FIR after framing of charge would tantamount to appreciation of
evidence at a premature stage. Reference has also been made to the decision of Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of State of M.P. Vs. S.B. Johari, AIR 2000 SC 665, wherein it has been held that at
the stage of framing the charge inquiry must necessarily be limited to decide if the facts emerging
from such materials constitute the offence with which the accused could be charged. Thus, it has
been submitted in the Patna High Court CR. WJC No.530 of 2025 dt.26-09-2025 counter affidavit
that in the present case it is beyond reasonable doubt that materials available on record prima facie
establish the charges against the petitioners. It has further been submitted that the exercise of writ
jurisdiction by the High Court is an extraordinary power which has to be exercised with great care
and circumspection before embarking to scrutinize the complaint/FIR/charge-sheet in deciding
whether the case is the rarest of rare case to scuttle the prosecution since its inception. The
respondent no. 2, in the counter affidavit, further submitted that the High Court can quash the FIR
under exceptional circumstances and the present case does not fall within any such circumstances
so as to make the FIR liable to be quashed.
09. However, Mr. Rana Vikram Singh, learned Deputy Solicitor General of India (DSG), at the
outset, submitted that though objections have been taken in the counter affidavit against quashing
of the proceedings against the petitioners but in all fairness, the case of the petitioners is squarely
covered by a decision of Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court in the case of Fadi Fadel (supra).
However, Mr. Singh, has pointed out the fact that a Co-ordinate Bench, while considering the prayer
of the petitioners for exit permit in Cr.WJC No. 460 of 2025, has directed the learned trial court to
expedite the trial and has Patna High Court CR. WJC No.530 of 2025 dt.26-09-2025 further
directed the petitioners to join the same through Video Conferencing and if the FIR and criminal
proceedings against the petitioners are quashed, then it would be contradictory to the order of the
Co-ordinate Bench and this issue needs to be reconciled. Thus, the learned DSG, requested this
Court to pass appropriate order as may deem fit and proper in the facts of the case.
10. I have given my thoughtful consideration to the rival submission of the parties and perused the
record.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/90227227/ 7
Craig Allen Moore @ Crag Allen Moore vs The State Of Bihar Through Its Home ... on 26 September, 2025
11. The FIR has been lodged against the petitioners for commission of offence under Sections
Sections 14(b) and 14-C of the Foreigners Act and Section 12(3) of the Passports Act. Further
charge-sheet has been submitted under the same provisions. It further appears that the charges
have also been for the offences under the aforesaid provisions.
12. Now, Section 14 of the Foreigners Act reads under:
"14. Penalty for contravention of provisions of the Act, etc. -- Whoever. --
(a) remains in any area in India for a period exceeding the period for which the visa
was issued to him;
(b) does any act in violation of the conditions of the valid visa issued to him for Patna
High Court CR. WJC No.530 of 2025 dt.26-09-2025 his entry and stay in India or
any part thereunder;
(c) contravenes the provisions of this Act or of any order made thereunder or any
direction given in pursuance of this Act or such order for which no specific
punishment is provided under this Act, shall be punished with imprisonment for a
term which may extend to five years and shall also be liable to fine; and if he has
entered into a bond in pursuance of clause (f) of sub-
section (2) of section 3, his bond shall be forfeited, and any person bound thereby shall pay the
penalty thereof or show cause to the satisfaction of the convicting Court why such penalty should
not be paid by him."
The petitioners have been made accused under Section 14(b) of the Foreigners Act, but the fact of
the case does not show any violation of the conditions of the valid visa issued to the petitioners for
his entry and stay in India or any part thereunder and therefore, no offence under Section 14(b) of
the Foreigners Act is made out against the petitioners.
13. Section 14C of the Foreigners Act provides for penalty for abetment and reads as under:
"14C. Penalty for abetment.--Whoever abets any offence punishable under section 14
or section 14A or section 14B shall, if the act Patna High Court CR. WJC No.530 of
2025 dt.26-09-2025 abetted is committed in consequence of the abetment, be
punished with the punishment provided for the offence."
The aforesaid provision of Section 14C is not applicable in the case of the petitioners since the
petitioners could not be said to have abetted any offence punishable under Sections 14, 14-A or 14-B
of the Foreigners Act.
14. Section 12(3) of the Passports Act provides as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/90227227/ 8
Craig Allen Moore @ Crag Allen Moore vs The State Of Bihar Through Its Home ... on 26 September, 2025
12. Offences and penalties --
.......................................................
(3) Whoever contravenes any condition of a passport or travel document or any provision of this Act
or any rule made thereunder for which no punishment is provided elsewhere in this Act shall be
punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three months or with fine which may
extend to five hundred rupees or with both.
There is no material on record to show that which condition of the Passports or the travel
documents has been contravened by the petitioners. Though, it can be said that not getting an
endorsement on the passport might be covered under violation of passport or Visa document, the
same seems to be Patna High Court CR. WJC No.530 of 2025 dt.26-09-2025 mere infraction for the
reasons that the petitioners are holders of valid passports of a foreign country. They have duly got
electronic Visa when they intended to visit this country. If, at the time of their entry, their passports
were not endorsed with immigration stamp, this irregularity would not attract either the provisions
of Section 14(b) and 14-C of the Foreigners Act or Section 12(3) of the Passports Act. There is
nothing on record to suggest that petitioners have violated or contravened any other provision of the
aforesaid Acts.
15. Now, the Act of 1920 prohibits entry into India without valid Visa but in the facts of the present
case, petitioners were holding valid Visa, therefore, petitioners could not have been arrested under
Section 4 of the Act of 1920, which gives power of arrest to certain officers of the State/Union of
India. Under Section 5 of the Act of 1920, the Central Government has power to direct the removal
of any person from India who in contravention of any rule made under Section 3 prohibiting entry
into India without passport, has entered therein, and thereupon any office of the Government shall
have all reasonable powers necessary to enforce such direction.
16. Rule 3 of Passport (Entry into India) Rules, 1950 (for short 'the Rules, 1950') provides that save
as provided in Patna High Court CR. WJC No.530 of 2025 dt.26-09-2025 rule 4, no person
proceeding from any place outside India shall enter, or attempt to enter, India by water, land or air-
unless he is in possession of a valid passport conforming to the conditions prescribed in rule 5. Rule
-5 of the Rules, 1950, which prescribes for the conditions of a valid passport are as under:
"5. The conditions of a Valid passport are- .............................................
(iv) that when issued by or on behalf of the Government of a foreign country (other
than Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan) it shall have been [endorsed by a proper
Indian diplomatic consular or passport authority or by such authority as may be
authorised in this behalf by the Central Government], by way of visa for India in one
or other of the following kinds, namely:--
(a) a single journey visa, valid for such period not exceeding [five years] as may be
specified therein and for only journey to India;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/90227227/ 9
Craig Allen Moore @ Crag Allen Moore vs The State Of Bihar Through Its Home ... on 26 September, 2025
(b) a transit visa, valid for such period not exceeding one year or the period of validity
of the visa for the country of ultimate destination, as may be specified therein, and for
one or more direct journeys through India undertaken for the sole purpose of
reaching any place or country outside India, permitting on each such journey sojourn
of not more than fifteen days in India unless specially extended by competent
authority; and
(c) an ordinary visa, valid for such period not exceeding ones [five years] as may be
specified therein, and for any number of journeys to India;
(d) a multiple entry, life long visa for journey to India to persons registered as
Overseas Citizen of India under the provisions Patna High Court CR. WJC No.530 of
2025 dt.26-09-2025 of the Citizenship Act, 1955;] ..............................................."
It is nobody's case that the petitioners were not holding valid passports rather they have entered
into Indian territory during Chhath Festival and their passports were not endorsed with
immigration stamp. The petitioners were also having valid Visas for their stay in Nepal.
17. Under the circumstances, it was incumbent upon the authorities to have taken recourse of
deportation of the petitioners instead of lodging the FIR and sending them to prison. But, as on
date, the petitioners have been facing trial in connection with Jaynagar P.S. Case No. 323/2024 and
their deportation could take place only when the trial stands concluded resulting in acquittal of the
petitioners or entire criminal proceedings are quashed against the petitioners. In the facts and
circumstances, I am of the considered opinion that the initiation of criminal prosecution against the
petitioners has been fraught with illegality. So, the continuation of criminal trial against the
petitioners would tantamount to perpetuating the illegality. The prosecuting agency as well as the
learned trial court committed error in proceeding with the trial. The FIR against the petitioners and
all the proceedings pursuant thereto appear to be an abuse of the process of law and if allowed to
Patna High Court CR. WJC No.530 of 2025 dt.26-09-2025 continue, would result in subverting the
ends of justice. Thus, such proceedings ought not to be allowed to proceed any further.
18. However, the learned DSG has flagged the issue about order of a Co-ordinate Bench directing the
learned trial court to expedite the trial and if the criminal proceedings against the petitioners are
quashed, an anomalous situation may arise when there are two contradictory orders of two different
Co- ordinate Benches. But, I think this argument is fallacious. In the matter before the learned
Co-ordinate Bench, the petitioners moved for grant of exit permit to allow them to go back to their
country for medical check-up. The issue of legality/illegality of the criminal proceeding was not a
matter of issue before the learned Co-ordinate Bench. It passed the orders while looking into the
matter from the perspective of allowing exit permit to the petitioners and did not consider into the
merits of the case. Moreover, directing the learned trial court to expedite the trial further appears to
be a routine order without recording any substantive finding on the validity of the proceedings
before the learned trial court. Hence, under these circumstances, I do not think if orders are passed
by this Court Court quashing the criminal proceedings against the petitioners in connection with
Patna High Court CR. WJC No.530 of 2025 dt.26-09-2025 Jaynagar P.S. Case No. 323/2024, the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/90227227/ 10
Craig Allen Moore @ Crag Allen Moore vs The State Of Bihar Through Its Home ... on 26 September, 2025
same would run contrary to the orders of the learned Co-ordinate Bench.
19. A question may arise to jurisdiction of this Court in considering the relief(s) sought by the
petitioners once charge-sheet has been submitted an cognizance has been taken for the offences
mentioned in the charge-sheet and the learned trial court proceeded in the matter. This court is
alive to the fact that once the matter proceeded before the learned trial court after submission of
charge-sheet, cognizance has been taken, charges framed and evidence started, the proceeding
under Article 226 of the Constitution does not remain entertainable. However, considering the
peculiar facts and exceptional circumstances of the case, this Court is inclined to exercise its power
under Article 226 of the Constitution in order to secure the ends of justice.
20. In the light of discussion made here-in-before, the FIR bearing Jaynagar P.S. Case No. 323 of
2024, the order taking cognizance dated 16.12.2024 and the order dated 02.01.2025 framing
charges and all subsequent proceedings against the petitioners are hereby quashed.
21. The respondent nos. 1 and 2 would have been required to take immediate steps for deportation
of the Patna High Court CR. WJC No.530 of 2025 dt.26-09-2025 petitioners to their native country,
the United States of America, in case the petitioners would have stayed in India. However, the
petitioners have already left the country in terms of the order dated 25.03.2025 passed in Cr.WJC
No. 460 of 2025. Since the petitioners have been granted exit permit in terms of a judicial order and
thereafter they left the country, there remains no requirement for their deportation after quashing of
criminal proceeding arising out of Jaynagar P.S. Case No. 323 of 2024.
22. Accordingly, the present criminal writ petition stands allowed.
