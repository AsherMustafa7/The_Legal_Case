Date of Hearing: 13.10.2023 and Date of Judgment: 12.01.2024
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Biraja Prasanna Satapathy, J.
//120// Since on the face of the order passed by this Court in the case of Sarat Chandra Parida Vs.
State of Odisha & Ors. 2015 (II) ILR-CUT-94, the claim of the Petitioners to get the benefit of
pension and other pensionary benefits in terms of the provisions contained under Odisha Aided
Educational Institutions' Employees' Retirement Benefit Rules, 1981 (in short 1981 Rules) has been
rejected and in some of the cases order passed by this Court allowing the benefit in the light of the
order passed in the case of Sarat Chandra Parida when was remitted back by the learned Appellate
Court in various Writ Appeals, all the matters were heard analogously and disposed of by the
present common order.
2. This Court in the case of Sarat Chandra Parida while dealing with the provisions contained under
Rule 3 of 1981 Rules held as follows in Para 8 of the order:-
"8. For application of 1981 Rules to the staff of recognized non-government colleges,
Rule-3 thereof requires that the college concerned must have come under the "direct
payment system This apart there is no other requirement. The plain language of
Rule-3 makes it clear that irrespective of the nature of grant- in- aid given by the
Government to various staff of a college, once the college has required status of one
coming under the direct payment system then even if a staff is not getting full salary
from the Government //121// under the direct payment system or getting only some
aid in whatever form including 'block grant', he will be covered under the Rules & be
entitled to pensionary benefits under the Rules taking into account the amount of aid
he receives from the Government as salary & the period of his qualifying service. It is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187804507/ 85
Unknown vs State Of Odisha & Others ..... Opposite ... on 12 January, 2024
apparent from a plain reading of Rule-3 that the expression, "come under the direct
payment system"
qualifies the institution (college/ school) concerned & not a particular staff of the institution. Had it
been the intention of the legislature that the expression would qualify the 'staff', then it could have
simply said that the staff of aided institutions who are/were receiving their salary under the direct
payment system will be covered under the 1981 Rules."
2.1. The order passed by this Court in the case of Sarat Chandra Parida though was challenged by the
State before the Hon'ble Apex Court in SLP (C) No. 761 of 2016, but the SLP was dismissed on
19.01.2016. After dismissal of the matter before the Hon'ble Apex Court, the order passed in the case
of Sarat Chandra Parida was implemented by the Govt. vide letter No. 24680 dtd.30.08.2016. 2.2. It
is not disputed that Sarat Chandra Parida was in receipt of block grant under Grant-in-aid Order,
2008 and in terms of the order passed by this Court, Petitioner-Sarat Chandra Parida was extended
with the benefit of pension and other pensionary benefits in terms of the provisions contained under
1981 Rules. But by taking a plea that //122// Petitioners herein since are not covered under Direct
Payment System at any stage during the tenure of their services, they are not covered under the
provisions of 1981 Rules and accordingly not eligible to get the benefit of pension and pensionary
benefits. Rule 3 of 1981 Rules reads as follows:-
"3. Application of the rules - These rules shall apply to the teaching staff and non-teaching staff of all
recognized non-Government Colleges, High Schools, Senior Basic Schools and M.E. Schools which
come under the direct payment system and all non- Government Primary Schools including Sanskrit
Tols and Junior Basic Schools fully aided by Government in Education and Youth Services
Department directly or through Panchayat Samitis constituted under the Odisha Panchayat Samiti
Act, 1959 or through a Notified Area Council or Municipality constituted under the Odisha
Municipality constituted under the Odisha Municipal Act, 1950 :
Provided that Government may, be general or special order as may be issued in that
behalf, specify and other educational institution or category of institutions and the
staff working therein to whom the rules shall apply."
2.3. Learned counsels appearing for the Petitioners contended that as provided under
Rule 3 of the 1981 Rules, the Rule shall apply to the teaching and non-teaching staff
of all recognized Non-Govt. Colleges, High Schools, Senior Basic Schools and M.E.
Schools, which come under the //123// Direct Payment System. It is contended that
Petitioners in all these cases are continuing as teaching and non-teaching staff of
recognized Non-Govt. Colleges, High Schools, Senior Basic Schools and M.E. Schools
and all are working in Aided Educational Institutions within the meaning of the
definition under Sec. 3 (b) of the Odisha Education Act, 1969 (in short "the Act"). It is
contended that Sec. 7-C of the Act deals with Grant-in-aid. Section 7-C of the Act
reads as follows:-

2.4. It is contended that in terms of the provisions contained under Sec. 7-C of the
Act, State Govt. within the limits of its economic capacity introduced various
Grant-in-aid Orders (in short GIA) starting from Grant-in-aid Order, 1994. Para 3 &
4 of the Grant-in-aid Order, 1994 reads as follows:-
"3. The following categories of Non-Government Educational Institutions shall only
be eligible for consideration for being notified as Aided Educational Institution:
(1) Higher Secondary Schools or Junior Colleges recognised by and affiliated to the
Council imparting instructions and presenting regular candidates for Higher
Secondary Examinations in Arts, Science or Commerce streams conducted by the
said Council. Government (2) Colleges recognized by Government and affiliated to
any of the Universities imparting instructions an presenting re of the B.Sc. of B.Com.
degree examinations of the Utkal, Berhampur and Sambalpur Universities, with or
without Honours.
Note:- Sanskrit Tols, by whatever name called, conducting Upasastri, Sastri for Acharya Courses of
Shree Jagannath Sanskrit University shall not be covered by this Order.
(3) No Non-Government Education imparting any courses of study other than those specified in
Sub- paras (1) and (2) of this para shall be eligible to be notified as an Aided Educational
Institutions or to receive grant-in-aid from Government for any post in such institution.
//127// (4) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-paras (1) and (2) of this para, no educational
institution established or managed by any Corporation, Municipality or Notified Area Council, Zilla
Parishad, Panchayat Samiti or any Gram Panchayat, any Public Sector Undertaking or Company or
Statutory Body, the Union Government or the Government of any other State shall be deemed to be
a Non-Government Educational Institution for the purposes of this Order and no such educational
institution shall be eligible to be notified as an Aided Educational Institution or to receive
grant-in-aid for any post from the State Government under this Order.
(5) No order according permission or approval or recognition either temporary or otherwise under
the relevant provisions of the Act, or under any Rule applicable to it, and no order of any University
or the Council according affiliation, whether such permission, approval, recognition or affiliation
was accorded prior to the commencement of the Amendment Act, or thereafter shall ipso facto
entitle any Non-Government Educational Institution to be notified as an Aided Educational
Institution or to receive grant-in-aid for any post.
4. For the purposes of this Order, Non-Government Educational Institutions specified in Sub-paras
(1) and (2) of para 3 and the posts in such institutions shall be classified into the following categories
namely :-
A Category-I (i) Non-Government Educational Institutions and approved posts in
such institution which have received grant-in-aid has been sanctioned by
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187804507/ 89
Unknown vs State Of Odisha & Others ..... Opposite ... on 12 January, 2024
Government prior to the commencement of the Amendment Act;
(ii) Other posts in Non-Government Educational Institutions covered under
Category-I(i) which were admissible on the basis of workload and prevalent yardstick
and had been filled up prior to commencement of the Amendment Act, but in respect
of which no grant-in-aid had been sanctioned.
//128// Note: If a question arises whether a post was admissible on the basis of work-load and
prevalent yardstick, the decision of the Director shall be final. B-Category-II (i) Colleges imparting
instructions in and presenting regular candidates for the B.A., B.Sc. or B.Com examinations with or
without Honours of any of the Universities which have been functioning regularly for five years or
more by the 1st June, 1994 after obtaining Government Concurrence recognition and affiliation of
any University, or for three years of more if such institution is located in an educationally backward
district, which has not been notified as an Aided Educational Institution and has not received
grant-in-aid from Government for any post.
(ii) Higher Secondary Schools and Junior Colleges conducting courses in Arts, Science and
Commerce which have been functioning regularly for 5 years or more by the 1st June, 1994 after
obtaining Government concurrence or recognition and of the Council, or for 3 years or more if such
an institution is located in any educationally backward district, but which have not been notified as
aided Educational Institution and have not received grant-in-aid from Government for any post.
C-Category-III Non-Government Educational Institutions of the categories specified in sub-paras (1)
and (2) of para 3 which have already been established and have received recognition of Government
and affiliation prior to the commencement of the Amendment Act but do not come within
Categories I or II of this paragraph, and such institutions which may be established and granted
recognition by Government under the Act or the provision made thereunder and affiliation by the
University by the Council, as the case may be after the commencement of this order." 2.5. It is
contended that after extending the benefit of Grant- in-aid in terms of GIA Order, 1994, State Govt.
taking //129// recourse to the provisions contained under Sec. 7-C of the Act introduced
Grant-in-aid Order, 2004, 2008, 2009, 2014 & 2017 at different point of time inter alia framing the
guideline and entitlement of teaching and non-teaching staff of Aided Educational Institutions to get
the benefit of Grant- in-aid. While Para 10 of GIA Order, 1994 prescribes the modality of payment of
Grant-in-aid, Para 3 & 4 of Grant-in- aid Order, 2004 deals with the entitlement and modality of
payment of Grant-in-aid.
2.6. It is contended that in terms of GIA Order, 1994, Grant- in-aid payable to an Aided Educational
Institution is the sum total of Grant-in-aid admissible towards salary cost at rates specified for each
admissible and approved post from and after the date of eligibility and the Grant-in-aid so payable
shall be disbursed directly to the incumbents appointed and holding the post eligible for
Grant-in-aid either by the Director or through any other agency so authorized by the Govt. But
under GIA Order, 2004, the concept of block grant was introduced and quantum of block grant
includes the amount representing the initial pay of the teaching and non-teaching employees of such
institutions on //130// that date in the pre-revised scale of pay including increments notionally
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187804507/ 90
Unknown vs State Of Odisha & Others ..... Opposite ... on 12 January, 2024
accrued as on the date of the notification, plus Dearness Allowances as admissible thereon.
2.7. Similarly, in GIA Order, 2008 Para 11 while deals with the modality of payment, Para 5(2) of
GIA Order, 2009 deals with such modality. Similarly, under GIA Order, 2014 Para 9 of the order
deals with the modality of payment of Grant-in- aid.
2.8. While as provided under Para 3(3) of GIA Order, 2004, block grant is to be placed through the
Director at the disposal of the Secretary of the Governing Body/Managing Committee of the
concerned Education Institutions proportionately either on quarterly or monthly basis, Para 11 of
GIA Order, 2008 deals with disbursement of block grant in favour of an employee to be disbursed
directly either by the Director or through any other agency so authorized by the Govt. Similarly,
under Para 5(2) of GIA Order, 2009, payment of block grant shall be placed through the Director at
the disposal of the Secretary of the Governing Body of the Educational Institution and Secretary of
the Governing Body //131// at whose disposal the block grant is so placed shall utilize the grant in
the manner and purposes as may be specified by the Director and furnish utilization certificate
thereof. As per Para 11 of GIA Order, 2014, Grant-in-aid was paid directly in favour of the employee.
2.9. Learned counsels appearing for the Petitioners contended that taking into account the economic
capacity of the State as provided under Section 7-C of the Act, State Govt. introduced G.I.A. Order,
1994 and thereafter G.I.A. Order, 2004, 2008, 2009, 2014 & 2017. While under GIA Order, 1994,
the employees of Aided Educational Institutions became eligible to get the benefit of Grant-in-aid
equal to full salary cost, under GIA Order, 2004 onwards, the said Grant was extended in the shape
of block grant and the quantum was specified along with the mode of payment. But the fact remains
that after introduction of the Grant-in- aid Order, 2017, employees who are covered under various
Grant-in-aid Orders and in receipt of full block grant in shape of block grant became eligible to
receive Grant-in-aid as specified under Para 3 of the order.
//132// 2.10. It is contended that Grant-in-aid under GIA Order, 1994 and block grant under GIA
Order, 2004 onwards were released in favour of teaching and non-teaching staff of Aided
Educational Institutions, who are recognized by the Govt. But the mode of payment was either
directly to the employees concerned or though the Secretary of the Governing Body/Managing
Committee as the case may be. It is also contended that the word "Direct Payment System" is no
where defined either under the Odisha Educational Act or under any of the GIA Order.
2.11. It is further contended that as provided under Rule 9 of the Odisha Education (Recruitment
and Conditions of Service of teachers and members of the staff of Aided Educational Institutions)
Rules, 1974 (in short 1974 Rules), every employee of an Aided Educational Institutions shall draw
the same pay, Dearness Allowances and Subsistence Allowances in case of suspension as is
admissible to his counterpart in the Govt. Educational Institutions under the relevant rules. It is
contended that this Court in its Judgment dtd.19.10.2023 in W.P.(C) No. 34453 of 2021 and batch
has already held that the provisions contained under //133// 1974 Rules will be applicable to the
employees of Aided Educational Institutions, who are in receipt of block grant to the same extent as
is applicable to employees in receipt of grant-in-aid under G.I.A. Order, 1994. Therefore, in view of
the applicability of the 1974 Rules to the employees of Aided Educational Institutions, who are in

receipt of block grant, Petitioners herein who are employees working in Aided Educational
Institutions and are in receipt of block grant are also eligible and entitled to draw same pay and
allowances as is admissible to his counterpart in the Govt. Educational Institutions.
2.12. It is also contended that prior to framing of Grant-in- aid Order 1994, teachers of Aided
Educational Institutions were released with their salary in terms of the resolution/circulars issued
by the Govt. in the Education & Health Services Department on 12.06.1974 and subsequent circulars
issued at different point of time. It is contended that in terms of the circulars issued by the Govt. on
12.06.1974 onwards, employees of Aided Educational Institutions were in receipt of their salary
directly.
//134// 2.13. It is also contended that since the term Direct Payment System has not been defined
either under the Act or under the Rules, taking into account the dictionary meaning of the term, it is
to be held that employees in receipt of grant-in-aid under GIA order, 1994 and employees in receipt
of block grant under GIA Order, 2004 onwards are getting the grant directly from the Govt., subject
to the provisions contained under Sec. 7-C of the Act. 2.14. Even though this Court in the case of
Sarat Chandra Parida held accordingly and benefit of pension was also extended in favour of the
Petitioner-Sarat Chandra Parida, but by taking a plea that Petitioners are not in receipt of their
salary under the Direct Payment System, the claim to get the benefit of pension and pensionary
benefits in the light of the order passed in the case of Sarat Chandra Parida was rejected.
2.15. It is also contended that prior to introduction of Grant-in-aid Order, 1994, this Court in the
case of Patras Soreng Vs. State of Odisha & Ors. (1993 (II) OLR 272) in Para 3, while interpreting
Rule 3 of the 1981 Rules held as follows:-
//135//
"3. Employees of aided educational institutions are entitled to retirement benefits as provided in the
Orissa Aided Educational Institutions Employees' Retirement Benefit Rules, 1981 (hereinafter 'the
Rules'). Rule 3 of the Rules, however, states that the same shall apply. Inter alia to the teaching staff,
as was the petitioner, of such schools which come under the "direct payment system". The proviso to
that rule permits the Government to apply the Rules to any other educational institution or category
of institutions as may be specified by general or special order. It is the requirement of the school to
be under the "direct payment system" which has stood in the way of the petitioner in getting the
benefit under the Rules inasmuch as the case of opp. parties 1 and 2, as already noted, is that the
school in question does not come under the direct payment system. It is because of this that the
vires of Rule 3 have been assailed in this petition, inter alia, on the ground that it is discriminatory.
As, however, we are satisfied that despite what has been stated in rule by the petitioner is entitled to
the benefits under the Rules, we are not addressing ourselves on the question of validity of Rule 3 on
the ground that it is discriminatory." 2.16. It is also contended that by taking a plea that Petitioners
are not coming within the definition of Direct Payment System, State Govt. cannot deprive the
Petitioners to get the benefit of pension in terms of the 1981 Rules as pension is not a bounty and the
action of the State is also discriminatory and not sustainable in the eye of law. In support of the
aforesaid submission, learned counsels appearing for the Petitioners relied on the decisions of the

//136// Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of D.S. Nakara & Ors. Vs. Union of India (1983) 1 SCC 305.
Hon'ble Apex Court in Para 2, 12.4, 20, 26 and 28 to 32 has held as follows:-
"2. Do pensioners entitled to receive superannuation or retiring pension under
Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972 ("1972 Rules", for short) form a class as a
whole? Is the date of retirement a relevant consideration for eligibility when a revised
formula for computation of pension is ushered in and made effective from a specified
date? Would differential treatment to pensioners related to the date of retirement
qua the revised formula for computation of pension attract Article 14 of the
Constitution and the element of discrimination liable to be declared unconstitutional
as being violative of Article 14? These and the related questions debated in this group
of petitions call for an answer in the backdrop of a welfare State and bearing in mind
that pension is a socio-economic justice measure providing relief when advancing age
gradually but irrevocably impairs capacity to stand on one's own feet.
XXX XXX XXX 12(4). The principle underlying the guarantee of Article 14 is not that
the same rules of law should be applicable to all persons within the Indian territory
or that the same remedies should be made available to them irrespective of
differences of circumstances. It only means that all persons similarly circumstanced
shall be treated alike both in privileges conferred and liabilities imposed. Equal laws
would have to be applied to all in the same situation, and there should be no
discrimination between one person and another if as regards the subject-matter of
the legislation their position is substantially the same.
//137//

20. The antequated notion of pension being a bounty, a gratuitous payment
depending upon the sweet will or grace of the employer not claimable as a right and,
therefore, no right to pension can be enforced through Court has been swept under
the carpet by the decision of the Constitution Bench in Deokinandan Prasad v. State
of Bihar [(1971) 2 SCC 330 : AIR 1971 SC 1409 : 1971 Supp SCR 634 : (1971) 1 LLJ
557] wherein this Court authoritatively ruled that pension is a right and the payment
of it does not depend upon the discretion of the Government but is governed by the
rules and a government servant coming within those rules is entitled to claim
pension. It was further held that the grant of pension does not depend upon anyone's
discretion. It is only for the purpose of quantifying the amount having regard to
service and other allied matters that it may be necessary for the authority to pass an
order to that effect but the right to receive pension flows to the officer not because of
any such order but by virtue of the rules. This view was reaffirmed in State of Punjab
v. Iqbal Singh. [(1976) 2 SCC 1 : 1976 SCC (L&S) 172 : AIR 1976 SC 667 :
(1976) 3 SCR 360] XXX XXX XXX

26. Let us therefore examine what are the goals that pension scheme seeks to
subserve? A pension scheme consistent with available resources must provide that
the pensioner would be able to live: (i) free from want, with decency, independence
and self-
respect, and (ii) at a standard equivalent at the pre- retirement level. This approach may merit the
criticism that if a developing country like India cannot provide an employee while rendering service
a living wage, how can one be assured of it in retirement? This can be aptly illustrated by a small
illustration. A man with a broken arm asked his doctor whether he will be able to //138// play the
piano after the cast is removed. When assured that he will, the patient replied, "that is funny, I could
not before". It appears that determining the minimum amount required for living decently is
difficult, selecting the percentage representing the proper ratio between earnings and the retirement
income is harder. But it is imperative to note that as self-sufficiency declines the need for his
attendance or institutional care grows. Many are literally surviving now than in the past. We owe it
to them and ourselves that they live, not merely exist. The philosophy prevailing in a given society at
various stages of its development profoundly influences its social objectives. These objectives are in
turn a determinant of a social policy. The law is one of the chief instruments whereby the social
policies are implemented and "pension is paid according to rules which can be said to provide social
security law by which it is meant those legal mechanisms primarily concerned to ensure the
provision for the individual of a cash income adequate, when taken along with the benefits in kind
provided by other social services (such as free medical aid) to ensure for him a culturally acceptable
minimum standard of living when the normal means of doing so failed". (See Social Security Law by
Prof. Harry Calvert, p. 1) XXX XXX XXX
28. Pensions to civil employees of the Government and the defence personnel as administered in
India appear to be a compensation for service rendered in the past. However, as held in Douge v.
Board of Education [302 US 74 : 83 L Ed 57] a pension is closely akin to wages in that it consists of
payment provided by an employer, is paid in consideration of past service and serves the purpose of
helping the recipient meet the expenses of living. This appears to be the nearest to our approach to
pension with the added qualification //139// that it should ordinarily ensure freedom from
undeserved want.
29. Summing up it can be said with confidence that pension is not only compensation for loyal
service rendered in the past, but pension also has a broader significance, in that it is a measure of
socio-economic justice which inheres economic security in the fall of life when physical and mental
prowess is ebbing corresponding to aging process and, therefore, one is required to fall back on
savings. One such saving in kind is when you give your best in the hey-day of life to your employer,
in days of invalidity, economic security by way of periodical payment is assured. The term has been
judicially defined as a stated allowance or stipend made in consideration of past service or a
surrender of rights or emoluments to one retired from service. Thus the pension payable to a
government employee is earned by rendering long and efficient service and therefore can be said to
be a deferred portion of the compensation or for service rendered. In one sentence one can say that
the most practical raison d'etre for pension is the inability to provide for oneself due to old age. One
may live and avoid unemployment but not senility and penury if there is nothing to fall back upon.

30. The discernible purpose thus underlying pension scheme or a statute introducing the pension
scheme must inform interpretative process and accordingly it should receive a liberal construction
and the courts may not so interpret such statute as to render them inane (see American
Jurisprudence, 2d,
881).
31. From the discussion three things emerge: (i) that pension is neither a bounty nor a matter of
grace depending upon the sweet will of the employer and that it creates a vested right subject to
1972 Rules //140// which are statutory in character because they are enacted in exercise of powers
conferred by the proviso to Article 309 and clause (5) of Article 148 of the Constitution; (ii) that the
pension is not an ex gratia payment but it is a payment for the past service rendered; and (iii) it is a
social welfare measure rendering socio-economic justice to those who in the hey-day of their life
ceaselessly toiled for the employer on an assurance that in their old age they would not be left in
lurch. It must also be noticed that the quantum of pension is a certain percentage correlated to the
average emoluments drawn during last three years of service reduced to 10 months under liberalised
pension scheme. Its payment is dependent upon an additional condition of impeccable behaviour
even subsequent to retirement, that is, since the cessation of the contract of service and that it can
be reduced or withdrawn as a disciplinary measure.
32. Having succinctly focussed our attention on the conspectus of elements and incidents of pension
the main question may now be tackled. But, the approach of court while considering such measure is
of paramount importance. Since the advent of the Constitution, the State action must be directed
towards attaining the goals set out in Part IV of the Constitution which, when achieved, would
permit us to claim that we have set up a welfare State. Article 38(1) enjoins the State to strive to
promote welfare of the people by securing and protecting as effective as it may a social order in
which justice -- social, economic and political
-- shall inform all institutions of the national life. In particular the State shall strive to minimise the
inequalities in income and endeavour to eliminate inequalities in status, facilities and opportunities.
Article 39(d) enjoins a duty to see that there is equal pay for equal work for both men and women
and this directive should be understood and interpreted in the //141// light of the judgment of this
Court in Randhir Singh v. Union of India [(1982) 1 SCC 618 : 1982 SCC (L&S) 119] . Revealing the
scope and content of this facet of equality, Chinnappa Reddy, J. speaking for the Court observed as
under: (SCC p. 619, para 1) "Now, thanks to the rising social and political consciousness and the
expectations aroused as a consequence, and the forward-looking posture of this Court, the
underprivileged also are clamouring for their rights and are seeking the intervention of the court
with touching faith and confidence in the court. The Judges of the court have a duty to redeem their
constitutional oath and do justice no less to the pavement-dweller than to the guest of the five-star
hotel."
Proceeding further, this Court observed that where all relevant considerations are the same, persons
holding identical posts may not be treated differently in the matter of their pay merely because they
belong to different departments. If that can't be done when they are in service, can that be done
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187804507/ 95
Unknown vs State Of Odisha & Others ..... Opposite ... on 12 January, 2024
during their retirement? Expanding this principle, one can confidently say that if pensioners form a
class, their computation cannot be by different formula affording unequal treatment solely on the
ground that some retired earlier and some retired later. Article 39(e) requires the State to secure
that the health and strength of workers, men and women, and children of tender age are not abused
and that citizens are not forced by economic necessity to enter avocations unsuited to their age or
strength. Article 41 obligates the State within the limits of its economic capacity and development, to
make effective provision for securing the right to work, to education and to provide assistance in
cases of unemployment, old age, sickness and disablement, and in other cases of undeserved want.
Article 43(3) requires the State to //142// endeavour to secure amongst other things full enjoyment
of leisure and social and cultural opportunities."
2.17. Learned counsels for the Petitioners also relied on the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in
the case of State of Uttar Pradesh & Ors. Vs. Arvind Kumar Srivastav and Ors. (2015) 1 SCC 347),
wherein Hon'ble Apex Court held that when a particular set of employees is given relief by the Court,
all other identical situated persons need to be treated alike by extending that benefit. Hon'ble Apex
Court in Para 22 and 23 of the decision has held as follows:-
"22. The legal principles which emerge from the reading of the aforesaid judgments,
cited both by the appellants as well as the respondents, can be summed up as under.
22.1. The normal rule is that when a particular set of employees is given relief by the
court, all other identically situated persons need to be treated alike by extending that
benefit. Not doing so would amount to discrimination and would be violative of
Article 14 of the Constitution of India. This principle needs to be applied in service
matters more emphatically as the service jurisprudence evolved by this Court from
time to time postulates that all similarly situated persons should be treated similarly.
Therefore, the normal rule would be that merely because other similarly situated
persons did not approach the Court earlier, they are not to be treated differently.
22.2. However, this principle is subject to well- recognised exceptions in the form of
laches and delays //143// as well as acquiescence. Those persons who did not
challenge the wrongful action in their cases and acquiesced into the same and woke
up after long delay only because of the reason that their counterparts who had
approached the court earlier in time succeeded in their efforts, then such employees
cannot claim that the benefit of the judgment rendered in the case of similarly
situated persons be extended to them. They would be treated as fence-sitters and
laches and delays, and/or the acquiescence, would be a valid ground to dismiss their
claim.
22.3. However, this exception may not apply in those cases where the judgment
pronounced by the court was judgment in rem with intention to give benefit to all
similarly situated persons, whether they approached the court or not. With such a
pronouncement the obligation is cast upon the authorities to itself extend the benefit
thereof to all similarly situated persons. Such a situation can occur when the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187804507/ 96
Unknown vs State Of Odisha & Others ..... Opposite ... on 12 January, 2024
subject-matter of the decision touches upon the policy matters, like scheme of
regularisation and the like (see K.C. Sharma v. Union of India [K.C. Sharma v. Union
of India, (1997) 6 SCC 721 : 1998 SCC (L&S) 226] ). On the other hand, if the
judgment of the court was in personam holding that benefit of the said judgment
shall accrue to the parties before the court and such an intention is stated expressly in
the judgment or it can be impliedly found out from the tenor and language of the
judgment, those who want to get the benefit of the said judgment extended to them
shall have to satisfy that their petition does not suffer from either laches and delays
or acquiescence.
23. Viewed from this angle, in the present case, we find that the selection process
took place in the year 1986. Appointment orders were issued in the year 1987, but
were also cancelled vide orders dated 22-6- 1987. The respondents before us did not
challenge //144// these cancellation orders till the year 1996 i.e. for a period of 9
years. It means that they had accepted the cancellation of their appointments. They
woke up in the year 1996 only after finding that some other persons whose
appointment orders were also cancelled got the relief. By that time, nine years had
passed. The earlier judgment had granted the relief to the parties before the Court. It
would also be pertinent to highlight that these respondents have not joined service
nor working like the employees who succeeded in earlier case before the Tribunal. As
of today, 27 years have passed after the issuance of cancellation orders. Therefore,
not only was there unexplained delay and laches in filing the claim petition after a
period of 9 years, it would be totally unjust to direct the appellants to give them
appointment as of today i.e. after a period of 27 years when most of these
respondents would be almost 50 years of age or above."
2.18. Similarly, Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of State of Karnataka & Ors. Vs. C. Lalitha in Para 29
of the Judgment has held as follows:-
"29. Service jurisprudence evolved by this Court from time to time postulates that all
persons similarly situated should be treated similarly. Only because one person has
approached the court that would not mean that persons similarly situated should be
treated differently. It is furthermore well settled that the question of seniority should
be governed by the rules. It may be true that this Court took notice of the subsequent
events, namely, that in the meantime she had also been promoted as Assistant
Commissioner which was a Category I post but the direction to create a
supernumerary post to adjust her must be held to have been issued only with a view
to accommodate her therein as otherwise she might have been reverted and not for
the purpose of conferring a benefit to which she was not otherwise entitled to."
//145// 2.19. It is also contended that State being a model employer, it cannot discriminate the
employees of Aided Educational Institutions by taking the plea that Petitioners since are not covered
under the Direct Payment System, they are not eligible and entitled to get the benefit of pension and
other pensionary benefits. In support of the same, learned counsels appearing for the Petitioners
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187804507/ 97
Unknown vs State Of Odisha & Others ..... Opposite ... on 12 January, 2024
relied on the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of State of Odisha & Anr. Vs. Mamata
Mohanty & Ors. (2011) 3 SCC
436. Hon'ble Apex Court in Para 59 of the said Judgment has held as follows:-
"59. The rule of law inhibits arbitrary action and also makes it liable to be invalidated.
Every action of the State or its instrumentalities should not only be fair, legitimate
and above board but should be without any affection or aversion. It should neither be
suggestive of discrimination nor even give an impression of bias, favouritism and
nepotism. Procedural fairness is an implied mandatory requirement to protect
against arbitrary action where statute confers wide power coupled with wide
discretion on an authority. If the procedure adopted by an authority offends the
fundamental fairness or established ethos or shocks the conscience, the order stands
vitiated. The decision- making process remains bad. [Vide Haji T.M. Hassan Rawther
v. Kerala Financial Corpn. [(1988) 1 SCC 166 :
AIR 1988 SC 157] , Rash Lal Yadav (Dr.) v. State of Bihar [(1994) 5 SCC 267 : 1994
SCC (L&S) 1063 : (1994) 27 ATC 855] and Tata Cellular v. Union of India [(1994) 6
SCC 651]."
//146// 2.20. It is also contended that this Court in the case of Ritanjali Giri @ Paul Vs. State of
Odisha (2016 (I) ILR- CUT-1162) has already held that benefit of appointment under Rehabilitation
Assistance Scheme is also applicable to the employees of Aided Educational Institutions, who are in
receipt of block grant. Similarly, this Court in the case of Radharani Samal Vs. State of Odisha,
123(2016) CLT 218 has held that employees, who are in receipt of block grant are eligible and
entitled to get the benefit of trained graduate scale of pay on completion of 48 years of age.
Similarly, this Court in its Judgment dtd.03.01.2024 in W.P.(C) No. 34453 of 2021 and batch has
already held that the provisions contained under 1974 Rules is also applicable to the employees of
Aided Educational Institutions, who are in receipt of block grant to the extent it is applicable to the
employees who are in receipt of grant-in-aid under GIA Order, 1994.
2.21. It is accordingly contended that in view of the decisions as cited supra and the provisions
contained under the Act vis-à-vis the Grant-in-aid Orders, Petitioners, on the ground that they are
not covered under the Direct Payment //147// Scheme, cannot be denied of the benefit of pension
and pensionary benefits in terms of the provisions contained under the 1981 Rules. The rejection of
the claim of the Petitioner as well as non-consideration of the claim on that score is not sustainable
in the eye of law and it requires interference of this Court.
3.Per Contra, Mr. R.N. Mishra, learned Additional Government Advocate while supporting the
impugned order of rejection, passed in different Writ Petitions as well as non- applicability of the
provisions, contended that Rule-3 of the 1981 Rules is very specific to the effect that unless the
teaching and non-teaching staff of recognised, non- Government Colleges, High Schools etc. coming
under the Direct Payment System and are fully aided, benefit of Rule-3 cannot be extended. It is also
contended that as provided under the proviso to Rule-3, no notification as yet has been issued by the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187804507/ 98
Unknown vs State Of Odisha & Others ..... Opposite ... on 12 January, 2024
Government making applicable the provisions of Rule-3 to the employees of aided educational
institutions, who are in receipt of Block Grant, as the teaching and non- teaching staffs of all those
institutions are not coming under the definition of Direct Payment System nor they are fully //148//
aided. It is contended that provisions of Rule-3 of the 1981 Rules is only applicable to the employees,
who are in receipt of Grant-in-Aid under G.I.A Order, 1994, as they are getting the grant-in-aid
directly with payment of full salary cost and the institutions being fully aided.
3.1. It is also contended that as provided under Rule 3-A of the 1981 Rules, the benefit of 1981 Rules
is not applicable to persons appointed to services and posts in aided educational institutions on or
after the 1st day of January, 2005.
Relying on the provisions contained under Rule 5(1) of the 1981 Rules, learned Additional
Government Advocate contended that full pension admissible under the Rules is not to be given as a
matter of fact to a post unless the service rendered has been approved by the pension sanctioning
authority.
3.2. It is also contended that only the employees, who are in receipt of Grant-in-Aid under G.I.A
Order, 1994 are getting the benefit of Grand-in-Aid under the Direct Payment System and all those
institutions are fully aided. Since the employees who are in receipt of Block-Grant in terms of
//149// G.I.A Order, 2004 onwards are not getting the benefit of Grant-in-Aid under the Direct
Payment System nor those institutions are fully aided, the benefit of Rule-3 cannot be extended in
favour of the employees who are in receipt of Block Grant. It is accordingly contended that in spite
of the order passed by this Court in the case of Sarat Chandra Parida with its due implementation,
since the very provisions contained under Rule 3 is not applicable to the employees working in Block
Grant institutions, no illegality or irregularity has been committed by the Opposite Parties in
rejecting the claim of the Petitioners to get the benefit of pension and other pensionary benefits in
terms of the 1981 Rules.
3.3. With regard to the meaning of Direct Payment System, learned State Counsel also relied on the
decision of this Court in the case of Patras Soreng. Relying on the said decision, learned State
Counsel contended that this Court in Paragraph-4 of the said judgment has held as follows:
"4. We have taken the aforesaid view because the school in question is admittedly fully aided and
Rule 9(1) of the Orissa Education (Recruitment and Conditions of Service of Teachers and Members
of the Staff of Aided Educational Institutions) Rules, 1974 //150// has stated, after its amendment
in 1976, that every employee of an Aided Educational Institution shall ordinarily be paid in the
month following the month to which the claim relates "directly by the Government or by any Officer
or by any Agency authorised by Government". The position, therefore, is that after the aforesaid
1974 Rules were amended in 1976, a member of the staff of an Aided Educational Institution
receives his salary directly from the Government, and, as such, such a school has to be regarded as
under
"the direct payment system* of which Rule 3 of the Rules speaks of. It may be that
before the aforesaid 1974 Rules were amended in 1976, there used to be a distinction
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187804507/ 99
Unknown vs State Of Odisha & Others ..... Opposite ... on 12 January, 2024
between schools receiving aid under the direct payment system and otherwise, which
would appear to be so, inter alia, from what has been stated in Government
Resolution No. 250011/EYS dated July 13, 1978 which has said something about the
direct payment system being not applicable to educational institutions run by the
Christian Minority Community. The 1976 amendment, to which we have referred
earlier, however, leaves no manner of doubt in our mind that a school which is fully
aided, as is the one at hand, has to be regarded as one under the "direct payment
system" of which mention has been made in Rule 3 of the Rules. As to the aforesaid
Government Resolution, we would say that though this seeks to make a distinction
between minority institutions and non- minority institutions as regards the direct
payment system, the same cannot override the statutory rules of 1974 as amendment
in 1976, because of which that resolution and for that matter such other resolutions
could not and did not hold the field."
3.4. It is contended that since the employees who are in receipt of Block Grant are neither coming
under the Direct Payment System nor they are fully aided, even on the face of the order passed in
the case of Sarat Chandra Parida, they //151// are not eligible and entitled to get the benefit of
Rule-3 of the 1981 Rules.
3.5. It is also contended that the provisions contained under Paragraph-10 (i) of the Grant-in-Aid
Orders, 1994, is not there in Grant-in-Aid Order, 2004 or in any other G.I.A Orders issued
subsequently. Paragraph-10(1) of the G.I.A Order, 1994 is reproduced hereunder:-
"10(1). Grant-In-aid payable to an Aided Educational Institution shall be the sum
total of grant- in-aid admissible towards salary cost at rates specified below for each
admissible and approved post from and after the date of eligibility and the grant-in-
aid so payable shall be disbursed directly to the incumbents validly appointed and
holding the post eligible for grant-in-aid, either by the Director or trough any other
agency so authorized by Government, Government may from time to time determine
the mode and form of disbursement.
Provided that Government may require that any part of the grant-in-aid payable as
arrears shall be deposited in the provident fund or that it may be paid in some other
form."
3.6. Learned State Counsel also relied on the provisions contained under Paragraph-11(1) of the
G.I.A Order, 1994 which is reproduced hereunder:
"11.(1) Admissible salary cost for the purpose of computation of grant-in-aid payable
against any post shall mean pay at the lowest stage in the scale of pay //152// with
one increment for each completed year of service after the date of commencement of
payment of grant-in- aid and shall include D.A as the rates made applicable by the
State Government from time to time. The scale of pay prescribed by the State
Government for Non- Government institutions for the that post. Provisions of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187804507/ 100
Unknown vs State Of Odisha & Others ..... Opposite ... on 12 January, 2024
Odisha Service Code relating to grant of increment shall mutatis mutandis apply for
determining eligibility for earning increments subsequent to the first date of
admission of a post into the fold of grant-in-aid. Provisions of the Odisha Service
Code relating to payment of subsistence allowance shall mutatis mutandis apply to an
employee holding an aided post who is placed under suspension by the competent
authority provided that approval of Director has been obtained within the period
stipulated in the relevant Rules.
Illustrations: (a) An approved post in an educational institution notified as an aided
educational institution coming within Category-II completes the qualifying period on
1.5.1993. The date of eligibility of this post will therefore be 1.6.1994. The Scale of Pay
of the post as prescribed by the State Government is say 2,000-
50-2,500-100-3,500/-. The admissible salary cost on 1.6.1994 shall be Rs.2,000/-
plus D.A at the rates made applicable by the State Government . The post will be
entitled to receive grant-in-aid at the rate of 1/3rd of this amount. Ordinarily the post
will be eligible to earn two increments of Rs.50/- each on 1.6.1995 and 1.6.1996. With
effect from 1.6.1996, the admissible salary cost shall be Rs.2,100/plus D.A., as
admissible and the post will be eligible to receive grant- in-aid at the rate of 2/3rd of
this amount.
(b) An approved post admissible on the basis of workload and yardstick was first
filled up on 1.1.1983.
The post completes nine years on 31.12.1991. The college in which this post has been continuing
received concurrence and affiliation from the session 1981-82. This post will be eligible to receive
grant-in-aid from 1.6.1994 but at the rate of full salary cost at the initial //153// stage of the scale of
pay applicable plus D.A as admissible on that pay."
3.7. It is contended that in view of the provisions contained under Paragraph-10(1) and 11(1) of G.I.A
Order, 1994, employees who are in receipt of Grant-in-Aid under G.I.A Order, 1994 since are coming
under the Direct Payment System and the institutions in question are fully aided, the employees
working in Block Grant institutions since are not receiving the Grant-in-Aid under the Direct
Payment System nor the institutions are fully aided, they cannot get the benefit of the provisions
contained under Rule-3 of the 1981 Rules.
3.8. It is also contended that even though the virus of Rule- 3 of 1981 Rules was challenged before
this Court in the case of Patras Soreng, but this Court did not interfere with the said prayer while
disposing the matter vide its order dt.18.06.1993. In the alternate, this Court held that a school,
which is fully aided has to be regarded as one under the Direct Payment System of which mention
has been made in Rule-3 of the 1981 Rules.
//154// 3.9. Making all these submissions, learned Additional Government Advocate contended that
since employees working in Block Grant institutions are neither coming under the Direct Payment
System nor those institutions are fully aided, they are not eligible and entitled to get the benefit of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187804507/ 101

pension in terms of the provisions contained under Rule 3 of the 1981 Rules and as such there is no
illegality or irregularity with regard to rejection of the claim vide the impugned order in question in
different Writ Petitions. 3.10. Learned State Counsel also relied on the provisions contained under
Paragraph-4 of Resolution dt.17.03.1979 issued by the Government in the Education Services
Department. Vide the said resolution, principle of Grant-in- Aid to non-Government Aided High
Schools was issued. Paragraph-4 of the said Resolution held as follows:-
"4. Girls' High Schools in ex-State areas and educational backward area are eligible for a minimum
grant at the rate of Rs.75/- per month, 80% D.A and reimbursement of the entire loss in fee income,
soon after recognition of Class VIII and thereafter, they are eligible for recurring grant at the rate of
three-fourth or net deficit or full net deficit, as the case may be. In other areas all the above facilities
except Rs.75 P.M during the formation period are prescribed."
//155// 3.11. It is also contended that this Court while dealing with the matter in the case of Sarat
Chandra Parida held that the expression "Come under the Direct Payment System"
qualifies the institution concerned and not a particular staff of the institution. This
Court further held that once the college comes under the Direct Payment System,
then even if a staff is not getting full salary from the Government under the Direct
Payment System, he will be covered under these Rules. Similarly, Hon'ble Apex Court
in the case of State of Orissa and Another Vs. Anup Kumar Senapati and Another
2019 (19) SCC 626 in Paragraph-37 has held as follows.
"37. Considering the various provisions of Section 7-C of the Act and the Order of
1994, it is apparent that institutions which received grant-in-aid and post with
respect of which grant-in-aid was being released, have been saved. The reference of
the institution means and includes the posts. They cannot be read in isolation. It
cannot be said that right to claim grant-in- aid has been fixed, accrued, settled,
absolute or complete at the time of the repeal of the order of 2004. As per the
meaning in Black's Law Dictionary, vesting has been defined thus:
"vest, vb. (15c) 1. To confer ownership (of property) upon a person.
2. To invest (a person) with the full title to property. 3. To give (a person) an
immediate, fixed right of present or future enjoyment. 4.
//156// Hist. To put (a person) into possession of land by the ceremony of
investiture. - vesting, n."
4. To the submissions made by the learned State Counsel, learned counsels appearing for the
Petitioners contended that the word "Direct Payment System" has neither been defined in the Act
nor in the Rules. But the word "Direct Payment" as explained in the law of Lexicon means a payment
directly to the obligee and not to an intermediary. Similarly, according to Study.Com, Direct
Payment is electronic funds transfer, electronic funds withdrawal, direct payment or direct
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187804507/ 102
Unknown vs State Of Odisha & Others ..... Opposite ... on 12 January, 2024
withdrawal. As found from Wikipedia, "Direct Payments Scheme" is a UK Govt. initiative in the field
of social services that gives users money directly to pay for their own care, rather than the
traditional route of a local Govt Authority providing care for them.
4.1. It is also contended that in view of the decision rendered by the High Court of Kerala in W.P.(C )
No.2763 of 2010, (Faseela K.P V. State of Kerala & Other) decided on 17.03.2015, only when the
appointing authority makes an appointment and forward the same for approval, the appointment
will take effect only after such approval given //157// by the Educational Officer. Only other such
approval of the appointment, consequential benefit arising under the direct payment schemes of the
Government will come into play. View of the High Court of Kerala reflected in Para-9 of the order is
reproduced hereunder.
"It is only when the appointing authority makes an appointment and forward the
same for approval to the Educational Officer along with required particulars and
documents, the authority can take note f the appointment and approve the same.
Then only the appointment will take effect, making the teacher eligible for approval
of the appointment and for consequential benefits arising under the direct payment
scheme of the Government."
Learned counsel appearing for the Petitioners also relied on a decision of this Court reported in
1994(II) OLR- 534 (Kshitish Ch. Pati & Another Vs. State of Orissa & Others). This Court in
Paragraph-4 of the order has held as follows:-
"4. Approval of a teacher becomes necessary for the purpose of making payment of
the salary under the direct payment scheme and it has got no connection with the
appointment of a teacher given by the Managing Committee."
4.2. It is further contended that while issuing Grant-in-Aid Order, 2004 onwards, Government at
different point of time issued different guideline for payment of Grant-in-Aid. While under G.I.A
Order, 2004 under Paragraph-3(3), Grant-
//158// in-Aid is payable to an employee through the Secretary on being placed by the Government,
under Paragraph-11 of G.I.A Order, 2008, such Block Grant is disbursed directly to the incumbent
validly appointed and holding the post. Similarly, in the Grant-in-Aid Order, 2009 vide Paragraph-
5(2), such Block Grant is payable through the Secretary on being placed by the Director at the
disposal of the Secretary. But in the 2014 Grant-in-Aid Order, vide Paragraph-9, Block Grant so
payable is disbursed directly to the incumbent validly appointed.
4.3. But after coming into force of Grant-in-Aid Order, 2017, all the employees covered under the
Grant-in-Aid Order 2008, 2009 were allowed to receive full Grant-in-Aid in shape of Block Grant as
on 31st December, 2017.
Paragraph-3(3) of G.I.A Order, 2004, Paragraph-11 of G.I.A Order, 2008, Pagragraph-5(2) of the
G.I.A Order, 2009 and Paragraph-9 of the G.I.A Order, 2014 are reproduced hereunder:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187804507/ 103
Unknown vs State Of Odisha & Others ..... Opposite ... on 12 January, 2024
GIA Order, 2004: 3(3) The block grant shall be placed, through the Director, at the
disposal of the Secretary of the Governing Body of the concerned educational
institution proportionately either on quarterly or monthly basis.
//159// GIA Order, 2008: 11. Disbursement of Block Grant:- Block Grant payable to
an Aided Education Institution shall be the sum total of Grant-in-aid admissible
towards salary cost at the rate specified in this order for each admissible and
approved post from and after the date of eligibility and the Block Grant so payable
shall be disbursed directly to the incumbents validly appointed and holding the post
eligible for Grant-in-aid, either by the Director or through any other agency so
authorized by Government, Government may from time to time determine the mode
and form of disbursement.
GIA Order, 2009: 5(2) The Block shall be placed, through the Director, at the
disposal of the Secretary of Governing Body of the concerned educational institution
proportionately either on quarterly or monthly basis.
G.I.A Order, 2014: 9. Grant-in-Aid in the shape of Block Grant payable to an Aided
Educational Institution shall be the sum total of Grant-in-Aid admissible towards
salary cost at the rate specified in this Order for each admissible and approved post
from and after the date of eligibility and the Block Grant so payable shall be
disbursed directly to the incumbents validly appointed and holding the post eligible
for Grant-in-Aid, either by the Director or through any other agency so authorised by
the Government. The Government may from time to time determine the mode and
form of disbursement.
4.4. Relying on the provisions contained under different paragraphs in G.I.A Order,
2004 onwards with regard to mode of payment, learned counsels appearing for the
Petitioners contended that even though Government at different point of time is
releasing the grant-in-aid either //160// directly to the concerned employee or
through the Secretary of the Governing Body or Managing Committee as the case
may be, but the fact remains that it is only after release of the Grant by the
Government that the concerned employee is getting the same either directly or
through the Secretary.
Therefore, it is to be held that such payment is being made directly by the Government. It is
accordingly contended that since there is no hard and fast rule governing the field with regard to
payment of Grant-in-Aid under the Direct Payment System and Government while issuing different
Grant-in-Aid Order is prescribing different modalities for release of the same, for such technicality,
Petitioners, who are employees of recognised aided educational institution cannot be denied of the
benefit of pension in terms of the provisions contained under Rule 3 of 1981 Rules. In support of the
submission that on mere technicality, benefit cannot be denied, learned counsels appearing for the
parties relied on the following decisions:

Unknown vs State Of Odisha & Others ..... Opposite ... on 12 January, 2024
(i) (1989) 12 SCC 691 (Andi Mukta Sadguru Shree Muktajee Vandas Swami Suvarna
Jayanti Mahotsav Smarak Trust & Ors. Vs. V.R. Rudani & Ors.) //161//
(ii) (2012) 12 SCC 331 (Ramesh Ahluwalia Vs. State of Punjab & Ors.) In the case of
Andi Mukta Sadguru Shree Muktajee Vandas Swami Suvarna Jayanti Mahotsav
Smarak Trust, Hon'ble Apex Court in Paragraph-22 has held as follows:
"22. Here again we may point out that mandamus cannot be denied on the ground
that the duty to be enforced is not imposed by the statute. Commenting on the
development of this law, Professor de Smith states: "To be enforceable by mandamus
a public duty does not necessarily have to be one imposed by statute. It may be
sufficient for the duty to have been imposed by charter, common law, custom or even
contract." [ Judicial Review of Administrative Action, 4th Edn., p. 540] We share this
view. The judicial control over the fast expanding maze of bodies affecting the rights
of the people should not be put into watertight compartment. It should remain
flexible to meet the requirements of variable circumstances. Mandamus is a very wide
remedy which must be easily available "to reach injustice wherever it is found".
Technicalities should not come in the way of granting that relief under Article 226.
We, therefore, reject the contention urged for the appellants on the maintainability of
the writ petition."
In the case of Ramesh Ahluwalia, Hon'ble Apex Court in Paragraph-15 has held as follows:
//162// "15. We must, however, notice that the learned Single Judge has dismissed
the writ petition also on the ground that it involves disputed questions of fact.
Mr. Ray, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents has submitted that the appellant
actually has not been able to contradict any of the proven facts. According to the learned counsel,
the remedy of the appellant is to file a civil suit, if so advised. Therefore, the writ petition has been
rightly dismissed by the High Court. Mr Parikh, learned counsel for the appellant, however, submits
that the civil suit would not be an alternative efficacious remedy in the facts of this case. In support
of this submission, he brought to our notice certain observations made by a Constitution Bench of
this Court in T.M.A. Pai Foundation v. State of Karnataka [(2002) 8 SCC 481] . The learned counsel
pointed out that, in the aforesaid case, this Court had directed that the Appellate Tribunal should be
set up in each district of each State to hear appeals over the decisions taken by the disciplinary
bodies of even purely private educational institutions. It was emphasised that speedy resolution of
the disputes between the teachers and the management is in the interest of all i.e. students,
management as well as the teachers concerned. It appears that at the time when the appeal of the
appellant was heard, such a tribunal had not been set up in the State of Punjab. The appeal filed
before the Disciplinary Committee was also not referred to the District Judge by the Disciplinary
Committee."
4.5. In support of the stand that Petitioners cannot be discriminated and are also eligible to get the
benefit of the provision contained under Rule 3 of 1981 Rules, learned counsels appearing for the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187804507/ 105

Petitioners relied on the following decisions:
//163//
1. 2022 SCC Online SC 641 (Rushibhai Jagdishbhai Pathak Vs. Bhavnagar Municipal
Corporation).
2. Civil Appeal No.3860-3862 of 2020 (State of Jharkhand & Others Vs.

decided on 8.12.2021.
In the case of Rushibhai Jagdish bhai Pathak, Hon'ble Apex Court in Paragraph-17 has held as
follows:
"17. We are also inclined to grant interest to the appellants on the arrears at the rate
of 7% per annum, which would be payable with effect from 1st September 2017. We
have fixed the said date for grant of interest as the respondent-Corporation has
accepted the interpretation of the Scheme rendered on 16th August 2016 in the Writ
Petition preferred by Mukeshbhai Jaswantrai Joshi. Normally, and as a model
employer, on accepting the said decision, the respondent- Corporation should have
uniformly applied and granted the benefit to all its similarly situated employees
affected by the order dated 28th October 2010. This would have avoided unnecessary
litigation //164// before the courts, as was held in State of Uttar Pradesh v. Arvind
Kumar Srivastava : (2015) 1 SCC
347."
In the case of State of Jharkhand, Hon'ble Apex Court in Paragraphs-42 & 45 has held as follows:
"42. However, it is important to note that this observation was made by this Court
while discussing the ambit of the doctrine of legitimate expectation under English
law, as it stood then. As we have discussed earlier, there was a substantial conflation
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187804507/ 106
Unknown vs State Of Odisha & Others ..... Opposite ... on 12 January, 2024
or overlap between the doctrines of legitimate expectation and promissory estoppel
even under English law since the former was often invoked as being analogous to the
latter. However, since then and since the judgment of this Court in National
Buildings Construction Corpn. [National Buildings Construction Corpn. v. S.
Raghunathan, (1998) 7 SCC 66 : 1998 SCC (L&S) 1770] , the English law in relation to
the doctrine of legitimate expectation has evolved. More specifically, it has actively
tried to separate the two doctrines and to situate the doctrine of legitimate
expectations on a broader footing.
XXX XXX XXX
45. In Union of India v. P.K. Choudhary [Union of India v. P.K. Choudhary, (2016) 4
SCC 236 : (2016) 1 SCC (L&S) 640] , speaking through T.S. Thakur, C.J., the Court
discussed the decision in Monnet Ispat [Monnet Ispat & Energy Ltd. v. Union of
India, (2012) 11 SCC 1] and noted its reliance on the judgment in Attorney General
for New South Wales v. Quin [Attorney General for New South Wales v. Quin, (1990)
64 Aust LJR 327 : (1990) 170 CLR 1] . It then observed : (P.K. Choudhary case [Union
of India v. P.K. Choudhary, (2016) 4 SCC 236 : (2016) 1 SCC (L&S) 640] , SCC p. 267,
para 56) "56. ... This Court went on to hold that if denial of legitimate expectation in a
given case amounts to denial of a right that is guaranteed or is arbitrary, //165//
discriminatory, unfair or biased, gross abuse of power or in violation of principles of
natural justice, the same can be questioned on the well-known grounds attracting
Article 14 of the Constitution but a claim based on mere legitimate expectation
without anything more cannot ipso facto give a right to invoke these principles."
Thus, the Court held that the doctrine of legitimate expectation cannot be claimed as a right in itself,
but can be used only when the denial of a legitimate expectation leads to the violation of Article 14 of
the Constitution."
In the case of Dr. G. Sedasivan Naik, Hon'ble Apex Court in Paragraphs-32 & 33 has held as follows:
"32. While we accept the settled position of law that the rule applicable in matters of
determination of pension is that which exists at the time of retirement, we are unable
to find any legal basis in the action of the respondent University of selectively
allowing the benefit of Rule 25(a). The law, as recognised by this Court in
Deokinandan Prasad [Deokinandan Prasad v. State of Bihar, (1971) 2 SCC 330 : AIR
1971 SC 1409] and Syed Yousuddin Ahmed [State of A.P. v. Syed Yousuddin Ahmed,
(1997) 7 SCC 24 :
1997 SCC (L&S) 1587] unequivocally states that the pension payable to an employee
on retirement shall be determined on the rules existing at the time of retirement.
However, the law does not allow the employer to apply the rules differently in
relation to persons who are similarly situated.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187804507/ 107
Unknown vs State Of Odisha & Others ..... Opposite ... on 12 January, 2024
33. Therefore, we are of the view that if the respondent University sought to deny the
benefit of Rule 25(a), in light of the proviso which was subsequently inserted thereby
limiting the benefit of the Rule, it ought to have done so uniformly. The proviso could
have been made applicable in relation to all employees who retired from service of
the respondent University following the introduction of the proviso i.e. after
12-2-1985.
However, the action of the respondent University of selectively applying the proviso to Rule 25(a) in
relation to the appellant, while not applying the said proviso in //166// relation to similarly situated
persons, is arbitrary and therefore illegal. Such discrimination, which is not based on any reasonable
classification, is violative of all canons of equality which are enshrined in the Constitution of India."
In the case of Himachal Road Transport Corporation & Another, Hon'ble Apex Court in Paragraph-
15 has held as follows:
"15. In the case of D.S. Nakara1, this Court had treated the pension retirees only, as a
homogeneous class and all the pensioners governed by The 1972 Rules, were treated
as a class, because payment of pension was a continuing obligation on the part of the
State, till life long to the pensioners, unlike the beneficiaries of the Contributory
Provident Fund. In the said case, it was never held that the pension retirees and the
employees in service, constitute a homogeneous class. In the case of R.L Marwaha v.
Union of India and others2, this Court has held that fixing of a date for grant of
benefit, must have nexus with the object sought to be achieved. There cannot be any
2 1987(4) SCC 31 C.A.No.7230/2012 dispute on the proposition. Further, the case of
Union of India and another v. Deoki Nandan Aggarwal3, relates to fixation of cut-off
date, for grant of liberalized Pension Scheme. Even in the case of Subrata Sen and
others v. Union of India and others4, where a cut-off date was fixed for the purpose of
applicability of revised pension scheme this Court has held that all retired employees
constitute one homogeneous class and there cannot be cut-off date fixed to extend
such benefits. All the above said cases which are referred to and relied on by the High
Court are not relevant and cannot be pressed into service, to decide the issue which
arises on the facts of this case."
In the case of State of Rajasthan & Others, Hon'ble Apex Court in Paragraph-28 has held as follows:
//167// "28. It is settled law that when financial rules framed by the Government
such as Pension Rules are capable of more interpretations than one, the Courts
should lean towards that interpretation which goes in favour of the employee."
In the case of Satyanarayan Dora, this Court in Paragraphs-13 to 16 has held as follows:
"13. In D.S. Nakara (supra), at Paragraph-31, the apex Court observed that pension is
neither a bounty nor a matter of grace depending upon the sweet will of the employer
and that it creates a vested right.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187804507/ 108
Unknown vs State Of Odisha & Others ..... Opposite ... on 12 January, 2024
14. In Deokinandan (supra), the apex Court at paragraph-29 observed as follows:
"that the grant of pension does not depend upon any order. It is only for the purpose
of quantifying the amount having regard to the service and other allied matters that it
may be necessary for the authorities to pass an order to that effect, but the right to
receive pension flows to an officer not because of any such order but by virtue of the
rules."
15. In Jitendra Kumar (supra), the apex Court at Paragraph-8 has observed as follows:
"It is thus hard earned benefit which accrues to an employee and is in the nature of
"property". This right to property cannot be taken away without the due process of
law as per the provisions of Article 300 A of the Constitution of India."
16. Therefore, in view of the settled position of law, as discussed above, the right to receive pension
does not depend on any order and flows by virtue of the Pension Rules. The pension accrued to the
Petitioner under the statutory provisions of the Pension Rules, is in a nature of property, which
cannot be taken away by the opposite parties without due process of law. As a consequence thereof,
the pension, which has been accrued to the Petitioner under the Pension Rules, cannot be denied to
//168// him without adopting due process of law. Since there is no adherence of any rule for
denying the benefit admissible to the Petitioner under the Pension Rules, the same cannot be
withheld or stopped or denied to the petitioner in any manner. Consequently, the opposite parties
are obliged under law to pay pension to the Petitioner."
4.6. With regard to the submission of learned State Counsel that in order to be eligible to get the
benefit of Rule-3 of the 1981 Rules, the employees concerned must come under Direct Payment
System and the institutions must be fully aided, it is contended that applicability of Rule-3 of the
1981 Rules is defined differently for non-Government Colleges, High Schools, Senior Basic Schools,
M.E. Schools and non- Govt. Private schools including Sanskrit Tolls and Jr. Basic Schools . While
in the case of non-Government Colleges, High Schools, Sr. Basic Schools and M.E. Schools, the
requirement is that the employees concerned must have received the Grant-in-Aid under the Direct
Payment System, in the case of employees of Government Private Schools including Sanskrit Tools
and Jr. Basic Schools, the Schools must be fully aided. Therefore, the stand taken by the learned
State Counsel that in order to be eligible to get the benefit of Rule 3 of 1981 Rules, the employees
must come //169// under the Direct Payment System and the school must be fully aided is not
acceptable. With the word 'and' as incorporated in Rule-3, it separates the entitlement of the
employees working in Non-Government Colleges, High Schools, Sr. Basic Schools and M.E. Schools
to that of non- Government private schools including Sanskrit Tolls and Jr. Basic Schools. It is
contended that because of the word "and" as indicated in Rule-3, the term "Direct Payment System"
and "fully aided" cannot be read conjointly. 4.7. With regard to the interpretation of the word "and"
so reflected in Rule-3 of 1981 Rules, it is contended that the word "Direct Payment System" and
"Fully Aided" is to be read as separate and not conjointly as contended by the learned State Counsel.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187804507/ 109

4.8. With regard to the interpretation of the word "and" as reflected in Rule-3 of 1981 Rules, ,
learned counsels appearing for the Petitioners relied on the decisions of the Hon'ble Apex Court in
the case of (i) Union of India Vs. Millenium Mumbai Broadcast Private Limited, 2006 SCC 2751 (ii)
S. Krishna and Others Vs. State of Madras and Others 51 S.C 301 (iii) Calcutta Iron Merchant
//170// Association and Another Vs. Commissioner of Commercial Tax and Another 1997 (8) SCC
42.(iv) AIR 1968 SC 1450 (Iswar Singh Bindra & Others Vs. State of U.P.).
In the case of Union of India, Hon'ble Apex Court in Paragraph-14 has held as follows:
"14. In view of the aforementioned express stipulations contained in the agreement, it
is required to construe clause 9 of the agreement at the outset independently. By
reason of the said provision revocation of the licence both for breach of terms and
conditions as also for default in payment of any consideration must precede 30 days'
written notice and a reasonable opportunity of hearing. How the said provision can
be given effect to would depend on the construction of terms and conditions of the
licence. By reason of clause 1.2 as contained in Schedule (C) appended thereto, the
licensor had been conferred with a power to revoke the licence as also to encash and
forfeit the bank guarantee without any notice. The expression "and" occurring in
between the words "right to revoke the licence" and "encash and forfeit the bank
guarantee" must be read as two separate clauses. The same cannot be read as
conjunctive in view of the fact that it is admitted that the revocation of licence is not
permissible without service of 30 days' notice. What was, therefore, permissible is
that the licensor in terms of the said condition of licence may encash and forfeit the
bank guarantee furnished by the licensee without giving any notice. The same would
evidently mean that for the purpose of encashment and forfeiture of the bank
guarantee, no separate notice is required to be given in the event any cause of action
arises therefore."
//171// In the case of S. Krishnan and Others, Hon'ble Apex Court in Paragraph-10 & 49 has held as
follows:-
"10. The Attorney-General, however, contended in the alternative that the
constitutional validity of section 9 (2)
(a) and section 12 (1) of the new Act could be sustained under article 22 (4) (b) which
has been held by a majority of the Judges in A.K. Gopalan v. The State of Madras (1)
to be a distinct and independent provision authorising preventive detention for a
period longer than three months in accordance with a law made by Parliament under
sub-clauses (a) and
(b)of clause (7) of article 22. The Attorney-General claimed that the aforesaid
provisions were such a law, none the less because Parliament may have intended to
make a law within article 22 (4) (a) by providing for a review by an Advisory Board in
all cases of preventive detention. On a question of vires, the intention of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187804507/ 110
Unknown vs State Of Odisha & Others ..... Opposite ... on 12 January, 2024
Legislature is immaterial, and I agree that a provision for an Advisory Board is not a
hall-mark which stamps a preventive detention law as one necessarily falling within
sub-clause (a) of clause (4), so as to make its constitutional validity determinable
exclu- sively with reference to the requirements of that sub- clause. The law could still
be upheld if it fulfilled the conditions laid down in sub-clause (b) of clause (4). Mr.
Nambiyar, however, submitted that the new Act did not fulfil those conditions, for it
is not a law made under subclauses
(a) and (b) of clause (7). The word "and" should be under- stood in its ordinary
conjunctive sense, and the new Act neither prescribes the circumstances and classes
referred to in sub-clause (a)nor the (1) [1950] S.C.R. 88, (1) [1950] S.C.R.88.
maximum period of detention required to be prescribed under sub-clause (b) of clause (7). The
contention is devoid of substance. The new Act can, in my opinion, be regarded as a law made
substantially in accordance //172// with sub-clauses (a) and (b) of clause (7). According to the
majority view in Gopalan's case, sub-clause (a) of clause (7)being an ena- bling provision, the word
"and" should be understood in a disjunctive sense. The combined effect of sections 9(2)(a) and 12(1)
is to provide, in a certain class of cases, name- ly, where detention orders were in force at the
commencement of the new Act, that the persons concerned could be detained for a period longer
than three months if an Advisory Board reports that there are sufficient grounds for detention
within ten weeks from the commencement of the new Act, that is to say, without obtaining the
opinion of an Advisory Board before the expiration of the three months from the commencement of
the detention as provided in sub-clause (a) of clause (4). And, although 'the new Act does not in
express terms prescribe in a separate provision any maximum period as such for which any person
may in any class or classes of cases be detained, it fixes, by extending the duration of the old Act till
the 1st April, 1952, an over- all time limit beyond which preventive detention under the Act cannot
be continued. The general rule in regard to a temporary statute is that, in the absence of special
provi- sion to the contrary, proceedings which are being taken against a person under it will
ipsofacto terminate as soon as the statute expires (Craies on Statutes, 4th Edition, p.347).
Preventive detention which would, but for the Act authorising it, be a continuing wrong, cannot,
therefore, be continued beyond the expiry of the Act itself. The new Act thus in substance prescribes
a maximum period of detention under it by providing that it shall cease to have effect on a specified
date. It seems to me, therefore, that section 9(2)(a) and section 12(1) of the new Act substantially
satisfy the requirements of sub clause (b) of clause (4) of article 22, and cannot be declared
unconstitutional and void.

49. Brush aside for a moment the pettifogging of the law and forget for the nonce all the learned
disputations about this and that, and "and" or "or ", or //173// "may" and "must ". Look past the
mere verbiage of the words and penetrate deep into the heart and spirit of the Constitution. What
sort of State are we intended to be ? Have we not here been given a way of life, the right to individual
freedom, the. utmost the State can confer in that respect consistent with its own safety ? Is not the
sanctity of the individual recognised and emphasised again and again ? Is not our Constitution in

violent contrast to those of States where the State is everything and the individual but a slave or a
serf to serve the will of those who for the time being wield almost absolute power ? I have no doubts
on this score. I hold it therefore to be our duty, when there is ambiguity or doubt about the
construction of any clause in this chapter on Fundamental Rights, to resolve it in favour of the
freedoms which have been so solemnly stressed..Read the magnificent sweep of the preamble :-
"We, the people of India, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a
Sovereign Democratic Republic and to secure to all its citizens: Justice, Liberty,
Equality, Fraternity."
In the case of Calcutta Iron Merchants' Association and Others, Hon'ble Apex Court in Paragraph-8
has held as follows:-
"8. We are of the view that the contention of the learned Counsel for the appellant is
liable to be accepted. While it is not necessary for us to go into the correctness of the
conclusion that the requirement of the provision, if treated as mandatory, is invalid,
the limited question before us is whether it is permissible and possible - in the
context of the language used - to read the words "and furnishes" as "or furnishes". We
shall recast the provision by using the words "or furnishes" in Sub Clause (vd) of
Section 5(2) to find out if it conveys any meaning. So recast, it reads as follows:-
//174// Section 5(2) : In this Act, the expression. taxable turnover means, in the case
of a dealer who is liable to pay tax under Section 4 or under Sub-section (3) of Section
8, that part of his gross turn over during any period which remains after deducting
therefrom -
(a) his turn over during that period in... (va) sales of goods specified in Section 14 of
the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 (Act 74 of 1956) on a prior sale whereof in West
Bengal due tax is shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioner to have been
paid...(vd) sales on iron and steel as specified in Clause (iv) of Section 14 of the
Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, where he proves to the satisfaction of the Commission
that such iron and steel were purchased by him in the same form in West Bengal, on
or after the date with effect from which this sub clause comes into force, registered
dealer or furnishes in the prescribed proforma a declaration containing prescribed
particulars in the prescribed form obtainable in the prescribed manner and duly
signed by the registered dealer from whom such goods were purchased We agree with
the learned Counsel for the appellant that if the sub clause is read as aforesaid, it does
not make sense and the sentence gets distorted from a grammatical point of view
and, therefore, the latter part of the sub-section dealing with the mandatory
requirement of production of declaration from the seller as stated therein, must be
treated as not required to be fulfilled by the assessee for the purpose of the first part
of Sub-clause (vd) of Section 5(2)(a). That would result in deleting the second limb
namely, the underlined portion and leave the first limb intact thus permitting the
affected parties to produce such proof as they can, in respect of the fact to be proved

without being compelled to comply with the second limb of the sub-section.
In the case of Iswar Singh Bindra & Others, Hon'ble Apex Court in Paragraph-11 has held as follows:
//175// "11. Now if the, expression "substances" is to be taken to mean something
other than "medicine" as has been held in our previous decision it becomes difficult
to understand how the word "and" as used in the definition of drug in s. 3 (b) (i)
between "medicines"
and "substances" could have been intended to have been used conjunctively. It would be much more
appropriate in the context to read it disjunctively. In Stroud's Judicial Dictionary, 3rd Ed. it is stated
at page 135 that "and" has Generally a cumulative, sense, requiring, the fulfillment of all the
conditions that it joins together, and herein it is the antithesis of "or". Sometimes, however, even in
such a connection, it is, by force of a contents, read as "or". Similarly in Maxwell on Interpretation of
Statutes, 11th Ed., it has been accepted that "to carry out the intention of the legislature it is
occasionally found necessary to read the conjunctions 'or' and 'and' one for the other". 4.9. Relying
on the decisions so relied on by the learned counsel appearing for the Petitioners, it is contended
that because of the word "and" so reflected in Paragraph-3, the word "Direct payment System" and
"Fully Aided" is to be read disjunctively and not conjunctively. 4.10. Learned counsels appearing for
the Petitioners accordingly contended that since Petitioners who are employees of recognised aided
institutions and are in receipt of Grant-in-Aid directly paid by the Government either //176//
through the Secretary or to the concerned employee, directly, they are eligible and entitled to get the
benefit of pension in terms of the provisions contained under Rule-3 of 1981 Rules. It is also
contended that since similar benefit in terms of order passed by this Court in the case of Sarat
Chandra Parida has already been extended, no discrimination can be made out to the present
petitioners. It is also contended that since provisions of 1974 Rules has been made applicable to the
employees of Block Grant institutions by this Court in its judgment dt.19.10.2023 in W.P.(C )
No.34453 of 2021 and batch, in view of the provisions contained under Rule-9 of the 1974 Rules,
which is also applicable to the employees in receipt of Grant-in-Aid under G.I.A Order, 1994, the
Petitioners are also eligible to get the benefit of Rule 9 of the 1974 Rules. The Petitioners and
employees of aided educational institutions in receipt of Block Grant are also eligible and entitled to
get similar pay and benefit as has been extended in favour of employees who are in receipt of
Grant-in-Aid under G.I.A Order, 1994.
5. I have heard learned counsels appearing for the Petitioners in the present batch of Writ Petitions
and Mr. //177// R.N. Mishra, learned Additional Govt. Advocate along with Mr. S.K. Samal, learned
Addl. Govt. Advocate appearing for the State-Opp. Parties.
6. Having heard learned counsel for the parties and after going through the materials available on
record, this Court finds that the Petitioners herein are all employees of recognised aided educational
institutions. It is found that after due approval of their services, Petitioners herein were extended
with the benefit of Grant-in-Aid under G.I.A. Order, 2004 and subsequent GIA Orders so issued by
the Government at different point of time.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187804507/ 113

6.1. As per the provisions contained under G.I.A Order, 1994 vis-a-vis G.I.A Order, 2004 and
subsequent G.I.A Orders, Grant-in-Aid is being released in favour of the Petitioner's either directly
or through the Secretary of the Governing body or Managing Committee as the case may be. But the
fact remains that such grant is paid to the Petitioners after being released by the Government with
due approval of their services. It is also found that the word "Direct Payment System" has neither
been defined under the Orissa Education Act nor under the 1981 Rules or 1974 //178// Rules. The
word "Direct Payment System" has also not been defined in any of the Grant-in-Aid Order including
G.I.A Order, 1994. This Court after going through the provisions contained under G.I.A Order, 1994
vis-a-vis G.I.A Order, 2004 onwards finds that such Grant-in-Aid is being released in favour of the
Petitioners either directly or through the Secretary of the Governing body or Managing Committee.
Therefore, it is the view of this Court that Petitioners since are in receipt of Grant-in-Aid so paid by
the Government, they are to be treated to have been paid under the Direct Payment System.
6.2. With regard to the stand taken by the learned Counsel for the State that applicability of Rule-3
will be made only in respect of those employees who are coming under the Direct Payment System
and those institutions must be fully aided, this Court after going through the provisions contained
under Rule-3 of the 1981 Rules finds that the word "and" separates the employees working in
non-Govt. Colleges, High Schools, Sr. Basic Schools and M.E. Schools to that of employees working
in non-Govt. Private Schools including Sanskrit Tolls and Jr. Basic Schools. In order to be eligible
//179// to get the benefit of Rule-3 of 1981 Rules, the employees working in Recognised
non-Government Colleges, High Schools, Sr. Basic Schools and M.E. Schools have to come under
the Direct Payment System. Similarly, employees coming under the non-Government Private
Schools including Sanskrit Tolls and Jr. Basic Schools are required to be employees of fully aided
institutions. The stand taken by the learned Counsel for the State that the employee in receipt of
block grant under GIA Order, 2004 and subsequent G.I.A Orders must be under the Direct Payment
System and the school must be fully aided is not acceptable as the Rule is very much clear by
separating one group of employees with that of the other group with the use of word "and".
6.3. In view of such analysis given hereinabove and the decisions so rendered by this Court in the
case of Sarat Chandra Parida as well as the decisions in the case of Ritanjali Giri @ Paul as well as
Radharani Samal, this Court is of the view that employees working in non- Government Aided
Educational institutions and in receipt of Grant-in-Aid under GIA Order 2004 onwards are also
//180// eligible and entitled to get the benefit of pension and other pensionary benefits as provided
under Rule 3 of 1981 Rules. The State being a model employer, placing reliance on the decisions of
the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Arvind Kumar Srivastav, Mamata Mohanty and C. Lalitha, it is
the view of this Court that State cannot discriminate one set of employees from the other set by
taking a plea that the employees are not coming under the Direct Payment System. Since the word
"Direct Payment System" has not been defined either in the Act or under the Rules, on such a
technical plea, Petitioners cannot be deprived of the benefit of pension and pensionary benefits, in
view of the decisions of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of V.S. Rudani and Ramesh Alhuwalia as
cited supra.
7. Therefore, this Court is of the view that the rejection of the Petitioners' claim to get the benefit in
the light of the order passed in the case of Sarat Chandra Parida is not sustainable in the eye of law
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187804507/ 114
Unknown vs State Of Odisha & Others ..... Opposite ... on 12 January, 2024
and accordingly all those orders rejecting the claim of the Petitioners to get the benefit of pension
and other pensionary benefits under 1981 Rules is hereby quashed. While quashing all those orders
in the //181// respective writ petitions, this Court held that the Petitioners are entitled to get the
benefit of pension and other pensionary benefits as has been extended in favour of Sarat Chandra
Parida. This Court accordingly directs Opp. Parties to extend the benefit of pension and other
pensionary benefits as due and admissible in terms of the provisions contained under Rule 3 of 1981
Rules in favour of the Petitioners within a period of three (3) months from the date of receipt of this
order.
8. All the Writ Petitions are accordingly disposed of.
