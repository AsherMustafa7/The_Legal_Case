[3] Subsequently, the petitioner submitted a detailed written statement dated 05.11.2015. However,
vide order dated 27.11.2015 the Commandant, 2nd Bn. Manipur Rifles recalled and revoked the
voluntary retirement order and re-instate the petitioner in service to face Departmental Enquiry in
connection with the aforesaid FIR. The relevant portion of the order dated 27.11.2015 is reproduced
as below:
"Now, therefore, the undersigned Commandant, 2MR Imphal in exercise of the
power conferred upon me under rules 66 of AP Manual Part-III do hereby revoked
and re-instate Ex-Rifleman No.1194148, Md. Nasir Khan from voluntary retirement
with immediate effect and conduct a Departmental enquiry against him for his grave
misconduct by involving FIR case No.12(2)2010 WGI-PS u/s 400/489-C IPC during
his service."
[4] The petitioner challenged the revocation order dated 27.11.2015 by way of writ petition being
WP(C)No.1026 of 2015 and this Court passed an interim order dated 16.12.2015 restraining the
respondents not to take coercive action against the petitioner if he was not able to attend office after
his reinstatement. [5] The Commandant, 2nd Bn. Manipur Rifles issued Memorandum dated
07.01.2016 to the petitioner for initiating Departmental Enquiry against him in connection with the
above mentioned FIR case and the petitioner has challenged the said Memorandum dated
07.01.2016 as well as article of charges by way of the present writ petition i.e. WP(C)No.83 of 2016.
[6] During the course of hearing, Mr. N. Umakanta, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that
vide order dated 13.06.2017 passed by this Court in connected writ petition being WP(C)No.1026 of
2015, the reinstatement order dated 27.11.2015 was quashed on the ground that once the voluntary
retirement of the petitioner was accepted by the authority, the authority did not have jurisdiction to
recall the order by which the relationship between an employer and an employee had already been
snapped and there was no provision to revive the same. The relevant portion of the order dated
13.06.2017 is reproduced herein below:
"7. Normally, an authority which has the power to issue an order has the power to
revoke, amend, vary or rescind the same as provided under Section 21 of the General
Clauses Act, 1987. But in the present case, what is of interest if that by the order
dated 28.03.2015 by accepting the request for voluntary retirement sought by the
petitioner, the relationship of the petitioner and the State Government as an
employee and employer is snapped. Once the voluntary retirement is accepted, a
Government employee ceases to be a Government employee except for the purpose of
any retiral and other benefits which would accrue because of the service already
rendered by the Government employee and which will be governed by the relevant
rules/pension rules. Otherwise, there ceases to be any relationship between the
Government employee and the Government. Therefore, the question which arises is
as to whether once the relationship of employee and employer is snapped, can the
ex-employer i.e., the State Government continue to treat the petitioner as an
employee so as to subject him to any further action by way of giving show cause
notice and recalling an order by which the relationship of an employee and employer
had already been snapped? In the opinion of this Court, once the employer-employee

Md. Nasir Khan vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 3 April, 2024
relationship is snapped, it becomes irreversible. For the same reason, the petitioner
also cannot seek withdrawal of his application for voluntary retirement once it has
been accepted and given effect to. Voluntary retirement is just another method of
terminating the service of the Government employee and as such once the service is
effectively terminated, his relationship with the State Government as a Government
employee ceases and the employee has no further obligation towards the employer
except for the purpose of retiral or pensionery benefits which could be withheld or
deprived of in accordance with the provisions under the relevant Pension Rules. If
the service rules enable the authority to revoke any such order of voluntary
retirement, the matter would have been otherwise. However, the learned Sr. GA for
the State respondents has not been able to show or point out any such provision
under any rule which enables the State Government to revoke an order allowing
voluntary retirement from service which had already become effective. The
relationship between the employee and the employer is governed by the statutory
rules and if the statutory rules do not provide for governing the service conditions
post employment, the employer will have no authority to do anything which is not
provided by the rules. Accordingly, this Court is of the view that the authorities has
no jurisdiction to recall and order by which the relationship between and employer
and an employee has been snapped. Therefore, this Court is of the opinion that the
petition should be allowed as the respondent authorities have no jurisdiction or
authority to recall any such order allowing voluntary retirement.
For the reasons discussed above, the present writ petition is allowed by setting aside
the impugned order dated 27.11.2015."
[7] Mr. N. Umakanta, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner draws the attention of this Court
to the peculiar fact that on perusal of the Show Cause notice and the reinstatement order, the very
purpose of reinstatement of service of the petitioner is to face Departmental Enquiry and once the
reinstatement order is set aside, the proceeding of Departmental Enquiry cannot survive on its own
independently.
[8] On the other hand, Mr. Shyam Sharma, learned GA submits that Departmental Enquiry can be
proceeded against the retired employee and there is no infirmity to continue with impugned
Departmental Enquiry against the petitioner and the same may be allowed to continue. He has also
pointed out that the petitioner has not avail the alternative remedy of approaching the Appellate
Authority under Assam Police Manual and the petitioner approached this Court directly without
affording alternative statutory remedy. It is also stated that the petitioner has concealed the fact of
his involvement in the previous criminal case.
[9] Mr. N. Umakanta, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner has clarified that the petitioner
can approach the Appellate Authority in case of any punishment imposed against him by the
authority but in the present case, the impugned order of reinstatement is not a punishment and
hence there is no occasion to approach the Appellate Authority.

Md. Nasir Khan vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 3 April, 2024
[10] This Court has considered the submission made by the learned counsel for the parties at the Bar
and perused the materials on record. On perusal of the Show cause notice dated 20.10.2015 and the
reinstatement as well as the revocation of voluntary retirement order dated 27.11.2015, it is clear
that the purpose of reinstatement is to initiate Departmental Enquiry against the petitioner in
connection of his involvement in the aforesaid FIR. Once the reinstatement order dated 27.11.2015
has been set aside by this Court by an order dated 13.06.2017 in WP(C)No. 1026 of 2015 filed by the
petitioner herein, the very basic foundation for initiating the Departmental Enquiry against the
petitioner is no longer in existence and the Departmental proceeding is devoid of any authority.
[11] Accordingly, the present writ petition is allowed and the Office Memorandum dated 07.01.2016
and the article of charges are set aside on this limited ground only.
[12] It is clarified that the respondents may proceed as per law if the same is permissible and if so
advised.
[13] With the above observations, this writ petition is disposed of.
