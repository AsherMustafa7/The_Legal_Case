12. The slippers of the deceased which were seized from the place of occurrence was marked as
Material Exhibit-M Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.64 of 2018 dt.16-10-2025 during trial.
13. The learned trial court held that since there is no eye-witness of the occurrence, final decision of
the case was dependent upon circumstantial evidence on appreciation and examination of evidence
on record. The learned trial judge found that the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is
to be drawn was fully established in the instant case in such a manner which are consistent only with
the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused. He also held that the circumstances were conclusive in
nature and excluded every possible hypothesis except the guilt of the accused.
14. In the instant appeal, it is the duty of the court to adjudicate independently as to whether the
evidence on record has established the chain of circumstances consistent only with the hypothesis of
the guilt of the accused and nothing else.
15. We have already narrated the name and status of the witnesses who deposed during trial of the
case. We have also delineated a list of paper exhibits and material exhibits.
16. Let us now scan the evidence on record independently. The informant is the mother of the
deceased. It is ascertain from her evidence that as a daily routine, deceased went to the house of one
Vijay Bhadur Singh to collect milk at Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.64 of 2018 dt.16-10-2025
about 06:00 AM on 10th October, 2016. She did not return to house for a long period, then the
informant conducted a search. While searching, she found her daughter lying in injured condition
on the plot of land adjacent to the House of Yogendra Singh. She immediately took her daughter for
medical treatment to Raghunath Prasad. Raghunath Prasad medically examined her and declared
her death. In her evidence, the informant narrated completely a different story. She stated on oath
that during search, she found spilling of blood on the street in front of Sirkat Singh and the lid of the
milk can was lying in a drain. Seeing this, she become unconscious. Local villagers brought her
home. Then, Jairam Singh, elder brother of her husband told her that he brought her daughter in an
injured condition and laid her down in the courtyard. Local people helped her to go to the courtyard
and she saw her daughter with black mark around her neck, bleeding injury on her head. He
suspected that the appellant committed murder of daughter. This statement and even her suspicion
against the appellant was not stated in the FIR. In her initial statement statement before the police
PW-1 stated that she suspected that some unknown person ((cid:128)(cid:129)(cid:130)(cid:131)(cid:129) (cid:132)(cid:133)(cid:134)(cid:134)(cid:134)) committed murder of
her daughter.
17. PW-2 Harinath Yadav in his evidence failed to Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.64 of 2018
dt.16-10-2025 throw any light as to how the daughter of the informant was murdered. He only
stated on oath that he only heard that the appellant committed murder of the victim girl.
18. It is ascertained from the PW-3, who is elder brother of her father that on 10th October 2016,
around 06:00 AM, he was coming home after defecating in the field when he reached, Yogender
Singh's land, he saw the victim girl going to collect milk with a can in her hand. He also saw Anup
following the victim girl. After some time, there was a hue and cry that the victim was murdered.
Anup brought her dead body and kept it on the courtyard of the house of the informant. PW-3 also

Anup Singh vs The State Of Bihar on 16 October, 2025
stated that when he saw Anup, he was in a state of panic.
19. PW-4, Vivek Kumar Singh is the son of PW-3. It is found from his evidence that on 10th October
2016 at about 06:30/07:00 AM he saw the appellant carrying the victim girl in his lap. The
witnesses asked him about what had happened. The appellant was in a state of panic, he said
nothing thereafter, PW- 4 and Anup took the victim girl to the local doctor by a motorcycle and the
doctor declared her dead. Anup then brought dead body of the victim girl and her home and the
witnesses went to his house. It is important to note that PW-4 was not cross-examined by the
defence.

23. P.W. 7 Vinay Kumar is the Investigating Officer of Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.64 of
2018 dt.16-10-2025 the Brahmpur P.S. Case No. 232 of 2016 dated 10th of October, 2016. He stated
on oath that he recorded fardbeyan as per the statement of P.W. Rita Devi then he prepared the
inquest report of the dead body (Exhibit 4) of the victim girl which was lying on the courtyard of
their house. He also inspected the scene of crime. P.W. 7 ascertained that the scene of crime is on
the lane between the houses of Shirkat Singh and Sri Ram Singh at a distance of about 100 meters
southeast from the house of the deceased. The accused caught hold of the victim girl while she was
going through the lane, injured and ultimately killed her. Blood was found spill at the crime scene.
Bloodstains were also found on the wall of Shirkat's house adjacent to the crime scene. There is a
lane running towards east of the scene of crime which closes after about 10 meters and rural road
goes to Vijay Bahadur Singh's house through Shirkat Singh's door to the north of the place of
occurrence. There is two- storey house of one Ram Singh to the west. There is a dense jungle and
bushes at the distance of about 10 meters to the south of Yogendra Singh's house. The body of the
deceased was found in the same jungle and bushes. The villagers pick it up and took it to her house
and from her house, she was taken to a local doctor. The I.O. also stated on oath that soil and grass
were found scattered Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.64 of 2018 dt.16-10-2025 in the said bush.
A pair of slippers were also found from the place of occurrence which was seized by the I.O. During
trial it was proved that the said slippers belonged to the victim girl.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/159241000/ 7
Anup Singh vs The State Of Bihar on 16 October, 2025
iv) Old healed linear abrasion on back of lower part.
Nature of injury - all the injuries are simple in nature caused by nails. Age of injury within five days.
In cross- examination this witness has stated that he has not mentioned the effect of healing of
injury no. (i). It is not correct to say that abrasion is a kind of would.
25. Other witnesses are formal in nature and detailed discussion of the witnessed appears to be not
necessary.
Argument on behalf of the appellant
26. The learned Advocate on behalf of the appellant submits that in order to bring home charge
against the accused Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.64 of 2018 dt.16-10-2025 in a case based on
circumstantial evidence, circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be
fully established. It has been held that the circumstances concerned "must or should" and not "may
be" established. It has been held that there is not only a grammatical but a legal distinction between
"may be proved" and "must be or should be proved". It has been held that the facts so established
should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused, that is to say, they should
not be explainable on any other hypothesis except that the accused is guilty. It has been held that the
circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency and they should exclude every possible
hypothesis except the one sought to be proved, and that there must be a chain of evidence so
complete so as not to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence
of the accused and must show that in all human probability the act must have been done by the
accused.
27. It is a settled principle of law that however strong a suspicion may be, it cannot take place of a
proof beyond reasonable doubt. In the light of these guiding principles, the learned Advocate for the
appellant invites us to consider the present case.
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.64 of 2018 dt.16-10-2025
28. In support of his argument, he refers to a decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
Pardeep Kumar v. State of Haryana reported in (2024) 3 SCC 324.
29. Coming to the instant case, it is submitted by the learned Advocate for the appellant that the
informant did not state the name of the appellant as the perpetrator of the crime. On the other hand,
in her fardebyan, she stated that some unknown person committed murder of her minor girl. It is
found from her initial statement that she herself saw her daughter lying in injured condition on a
land situated on the adjacent west of the house of one Yogendra Singh. Local villagers and the
informant brought her to the local doctor for medically treatment. The local doctor declared her
dead. In her evidence, she gave completely a different account of the event. She stated on oath that
she saw stains of blood on the lane and the lid of the can in the drain. She became unconscious.
Local people brought her to her house. There she saw the dead body of her daughter lying on the
courtyard. Her Bhaisur (elder brother of her husband), P.W. 3 Jai Ram Singh told her that the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/159241000/ 8
Anup Singh vs The State Of Bihar on 16 October, 2025
appellant brought her daughter and laid her down in the courtyard. Thus, the evidence of P.W. 1
does not support her own story of recovery of the dead body of her girl by her lying on a plot of
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.64 of 2018 dt.16-10-2025 land by the side of the house of one
Yogendra Singh.
30. The conduct of P.W. 3, Jai Ram Singh and P.W. 4 Vivek Kumar Singh was also not beyond
suspicion. Jai Ram came to know that the deceased murdered hearing the hue and cry in the village.
Then the appellant took the body of the deceased and kept it in the courtyard of her house.
Surprisingly, enough Jai Ram did not even feel it necessary to ask the appellant as to how the
informant's girl had died. P.W. 3 further stated that when he saw the appellant, he was in a state of
panic. It is very natural for human being to ask a panic stricken young man to say about the incident
but nothing had happened. Jai Ram allowed Anup to go away without any resistance.
31. Similarly P.W. 4 saw Anup carrying the dead body of the victim girl. He extended his help to
Anup to bring the dead body to the chamber of a local doctor. The doctor declared the victim girl
dead. Under such circumstances also P.W. 4 did not ask the appellant as to how victim girl died.
32. Therefore, it is submitted by the learned Advocate for the appellant that there is a yawning gap
between the charge against the appellant and the evidence that the prosecution has adduced. The
circumstances do not establish the guilt of the appellant at all.
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.64 of 2018 dt.16-10-2025
33. It is further contended by the learned Advocate on behalf of the appellant that there is only one
witness, namely, Jai Ram Singh who stated on oath that while he was returning his house after
defecating, he saw the girl of the informant was going through the lane with a can in her hand and
the appellant was following her. Thus, prosecution tried to make out a case of last scene together
against the appellant.
34. It is submitted by the learned Advocate for the appellant that theory of last scene together
cannot be the basis of conviction in the absence of other circumstances from which conclusion of
guilt can be drawn without any iota of hypothesis or suspicion.
35. The learned Advocate for the appellant further argues that the appellant did not make any
confessional statement before anybody which is admissible in evidence, either judicial or extra
judicial. The Trial Court wrongly place reliance on the statement of the accused made before the
Investigating Officer. It is needless to say that statement before the police officer is not admissible in
evidence.
36. In support of his contention, he refers to paragraph no. 79 and 80 of the Supreme Court decision
in the case of Ramanand v. State of U.P., reported in (2023) 16 SCC 510. In Patna High Court CR.
APP (DB) No.64 of 2018 dt.16-10-2025 our considered view, the ratio of his judgment is not at all
applicable because Hon'ble Supreme Court in paragraph 79 and following paragraphs has dealt with
the evidentiary value of extra judicial confession, any statement confessing guilt before the I.O. is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/159241000/ 9
Anup Singh vs The State Of Bihar on 16 October, 2025
not even an extra judicial confession and it is not at all admissible in evidence. Therefore the above
judgement is not applicable in the facts and circumstances of the case.
37. Referring to another decision in the case of Karakkattu Muhammed Basheer v. State of Kerala
reported in (2024) 10 SCC 813, the learned Advocate on behalf of the appellant submits that
presence of deceased and the appellant on the spot at the same time was not proved by satisfactory
evidence. Only on the basis of P.W. 3 Jai Ram's evidence (P.W.
3), the prosecution wanted to prove that the appellant was following the victim girl on the date and
time of occurrence. If a person follows another on the road, this does not a conclusively prove that
he had met the girl on or near the place of occurrence for the purpose of committing penetrative
sexual assault and murder.
38. We are constrained to note that the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Allarakha Habib
Memon & Ors. v. State of Gujarat reported in (2024) 9 SCC 546 is also not Patna High Court CR.
APP (DB) No.64 of 2018 dt.16-10-2025 applicable in the facts and circumstances of this case
because paragraph 40 of the said decision which has been relied on by the learned Advocate for the
appellant discusses the admissibility of confession of the accused / appellant recorded by the
Medical Officer while preparing the injury report of the accused. No such evidence is brought
forward in the instant case.
Argument on behalf of the respondent-State
39. The learned Government Advocate, on the other hand, submits that there is of course
discrepancy in the initial statement of P.W. 1 made before the police on the basis of which Brhmpur
P.S. Case No. 232 of 2016 was registered and her evidence on time and manner when and how he
saw the dead body of the deceased in her fardebyan. She stated that she saw the dead body of her
daughter lying in injured conditions on the land adjacent to the house of one Yogendra Singh.
However in evidence, she stated that the accused himself brought the dead body of the deceased and
had kept the same on her courtyard. In this regard, the learned Government Advocate submits that
the victim is an illiterate lady. The incident took place on 10 th of October, 2016. Her evidence was
recorded on 8th of March, 2017. Therefore, this Court should not take into account the Patna High
Court CR. APP (DB) No.64 of 2018 dt.16-10-2025 above-mentioned contradiction between the
statement made by P.W. 1 in her fardebyan and her statement on oath and such contradiction
should be regarded as minor discrepancy.
40. It is further submitted by the learned Advocate on behalf of the respondent that P.W. 3 stated in
his evidence that saw the appellant carrying the dead body of deceased and laid her on the courtyard
of the house of the de facto complainant. P.W. 3 also stated that he saw the appellant following the
victim girl when she was going to fetch milk. Thus, from the evidence on record, it is ascertained
that the appellant was following the victim through the lane where she went to collect milk. The
appellant knew that the victim girl used to go to the house of Vijay Bahadur Singh to fetch milk.
Therefore, on the fateful day of incident, he was following the victim girl and her dead body was
found on the lane situated by the side of the house of Yogendra Singh inside a bush. This fact is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/159241000/ 10
Anup Singh vs The State Of Bihar on 16 October, 2025
reveled from the evidence of P.W. 1. If the circumstances are taken together, these suggests that the
victim girl was taken by the appellant inside the bush then she was raped and murdered by the
appellant.
41. It is further urged by the learned Advocate for the State that P.W. 4 saw the appellant carrying
the dead body of the Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.64 of 2018 dt.16-10-2025 victim then he
and the appellant took her by the motorcycle of P.W. 4 to the local doctor. The local doctor declared
her dead. When the dead body was being carried out by the appellant, it was within his special
knowledge to explain as to how the victim died and how he got custody of dead body of the victim.
Not a single witness threw any light over the said fact. It is absolutely natural and probable that the
villagers asked the appellant who brought the dead body of the victim to her hose about the cause of
death of the said minor girl and how he saw and brought the dead body of the said minor girl to her
house. The accused failed to give any such explanation on the above- mentioned questions. When
the appellant failed to explain the circumstances which were under his special knowledge, absence
of such explanation is to be considered as an important circumstance pointing at the guilt of the
accused.
42. The learned Advocate on behalf of the State further submits that from the evidence of Dr.
Bhupendra Nath, P.W. 5 and Dr. Madhu Singh, P.W. 6, it appears that the victim was died of
asphyxia by throttling. There was also signs of recent sexual assault in the private part of the victim.
Thirdly, the accused was medically examined by P.W. 8, Dr. Uday Shankar Tripathi. He found old
healed scratches and aberrations Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.64 of 2018 dt.16-10-2025 on
the hands and other parts of the body of the appellant. The Medical Officer, P.W. 8 opined that such
scratches and aberrations were about five days old. The victim died on 10 th of October, 2016. The
accused was medically examined on 14 th of October, 2016. Thus, medical report suggests that the
appellant received scratch marks and aberrations on his body more or less on the date of
occurrence. The Medical Officer opined that the said scratches and aberrations were caused by nails.
These injuries caused by healed mark also suggest that there was resistance offered by the victim
when she was sexually assaulted and finally murdered.
43. According to the learned Advocate for the appellant all the above circumstances fully establish
the fact from which conclusion of guilt of the accused can be drawn and there is no reason to
interfere against the judgement passed by the trial Court.
Our Assessment
44. In Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra reported in (1984) 4 SCC 116, laid down
the following five golden rules to constitute the proof of a case based on circumstantial evidence.
They are:-
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.64 of 2018 dt.16-10-2025 .....Certainly, it is a
primary principle that the accused must be and not merely may be guilty before a
court can convict and the mental distance between 'may be' and 'must be' is long and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/159241000/ 11
Anup Singh vs The State Of Bihar on 16 October, 2025
divides vague conjectures from sure conclusions."
(2) the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt
of the accused, that is to say, they should not be explainable on any other hypothesis
except that the accused is guilty, (3) the circumstances should be of a conclusive
nature and tendency, (4) they should exclude every possible hypothesis except the
one to be proved, and (5) there must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to
leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the
accused and must show that in all human probability the act must have been done by
the accused.
45. Bearing the above-mentioned principle enunciated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court and
subsequently followed in almost all the judgments on circumstantial evidence including Pardeep
Kumar (supra). Let us now considered the materials on record independently without being swayed
over any extraneous considerations.
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.64 of 2018 dt.16-10-2025
46. There is absolutely no evidence that the appellant had previous inclination or crush over the
victim girl. Though in the evidence P.W. 1 for the first time stated that her daughter once told that
the appellant used to disturb her on the road but such evidence was not supported by any other
person and there is no corroboration in this regard.
47. Coming to the incident which took place on the date of occurrence, we find from the evidence of
P.W. 3 Jai Ram Singh that while he was returning home after defecating, he saw the victim girl
going through the lane to fetch milk and the appellant was following her. There is absolutely no
evidence that anybody saw the victim in association with the appellant. We have already stated that
there are houses of various persons on both sides of the lane through which the victim was
proceeding. Nobody came forward to say that he saw the appellant and the victim proceeding
together through the said lane.
48. Secondly no evidence is forthcoming that the appellant either enticed or forcibly took the victim
inside the bush grow on the land by the said of the house of Yogendra Singh.
49. The Investigating Officer recovered a pair slippers Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.64 of
2018 dt.16-10-2025 of the victim from the said bush. However no evidence was produced by the
prosecution that there was some resistance offered by the victim to the appellant and as a result of
such resistance, the appellant received nail injuries over his body.
50. It is found that the appellant carried the dead body of the victim towards his house. On the way
he met P.W. 4 Vivek Kumar Singh, seeing the conditions of the victim, Vivek and the appellant took
her to the local doctor by a motorcycle and the local doctor declared her dead. Surprisingly enough
neither Jai Ram Singh nor Vivek Singh nor any other villager asked anything to the appellant as to
how the victim died or how did the appellant found the body of the victim.

51. These are the missing links of the chain of circumstances and the prosecution failed to produce
evidence to prove the missing links. The learned Trial Judge failed to consider the scope of Section
27 of the Indian Evidence Act states that any fact which is discovered in consequence of information
received from a person, accused of any offence, in custody of police officer, may be proved when it
relates distinctly to the fact thereby discovered. In other words statement made or information given
by an accused while in police custody must relate "distinctly" to the fact discovered. Patna High
Court CR. APP (DB) No.64 of 2018 dt.16-10-2025
52. Learned Trial Judge accepted the statement of the accused made before the police while he is in
custody because it discovered existence of injury of nail marks on his body. Only on the basis of such
wrong and illegal finding, not supported by law, the accused was held guilty and convicted and
sentenced.
53. Needless to say that as per the existing law provided in Cr.P.C as well BNSS and in the
judgement of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in D.K. Basu's case. It is the first and foremost duty of the
arresting officer to get accused examined medically. Medical examination report and existence of
some injury on the body of the accused is admissible in evidence but the statement made before the
police by the accused confessing his guilt to the fact that while committing the offence, he sustained
nail mark injury over his body cannot be proved with the aid of Section 27 of the Indian Evidence
Act.
54. The decision of the trial Court in this regard is absolutely misconceived.
Conclusion
55. For the reason stated above, we are of the view that prosecution failed to establish the charge
under Sections 302, 201 and 376 of the IPC and Section 5(1) / 6 of the POCSO Act and the
judgement of conviction and the order of sentence is Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.64 of 2018
dt.16-10-2025 liable to be set aside.
56. Accordingly, the instant appeal is allowed.
57. The judgement and order of conviction and sentence passed in POCSO Case No. 31 of 2016
arising out of Brahmpur P.S. Case No. 232 of 2016 is set aside.
58. The appellant is acquitted from the charge and released from the bail bond, and if he remains in
the correction home, he be released at once.
