Mrs. Jebun vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 11 December, 2023
Sharma, learned counsel for the petitioner and Mr. H. Samarjit, learned PP for the State
respondents. Learned PP has submitted the case record along with diary. [2] The present criminal
petition has been filed under Section 482 Cr.PC for quashing/setting aside the FIR No. 86(9) 2021
LIL-PS, u/s 436, 34 IPC and Section 3 & 4 of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property (PDPP)
Act, 1984. [3] The petitioner was appointed as a Chowkidar vide Government order dated
03.12.2016 and posted at the Office of SDO, Lilong until further orders vide order dated 02.01.2017.
The petitioner is staying with her unmarried daughter at the Quarter of the Chowkidar in the SDO
Office Complex. On the fateful intervening night of 31.08.2021-01.09.2021, there was a fire incident
took place at the SDO, Office Complex, Lilong. The SDO, Lilong, who is respondent No. 5, lodged a
report dated 01.09.2021 to the Officer-in-Charge, Lilong Police Station with regard to the said
incident. As per the report of respondent No. 5, the Officer-in-Charge, Lilong Police Station
registered an FIR being No. 86(09) 2021 LIL-PS u/s 436, 34 IPC and 3/4 PDPP Act against some
unknown persons.
[4] On 02.09.2021, the petitioner and one Md. Abdul Hakim, who was LDC, LA/Sub-Registrar,
SDO's Office Lilong were arrested in connection with the said FIR and Cril.Pet. No. 50 of 2022 Page
2 on 04.09.2021, they were remanded to the judicial custody for a period of 15 days with effect from
04.09.2021 to 18.09.2021. On the same day of arrest i.e. 04.09.2021, the Ld. Magistrate released
Mr. Md. Abdul Hakim on bail on medical grounds and remanded the petitioner to judicial custody
till 18.09.2021. The petitioner being detained for more than 48 hours in custody, this led her
suspension from her service. [5] Vide order dated 12.10.2021 passed by the Ld. Session Judge,
Thoubal in Cril. Misc (B) Case No. 167 of 2021, the petitioner was released on bail in connection
with the said FIR by imposing certain terms and conditions and while releasing her on bail, she fully
complied with the terms and conditions as imposed by the Ld. Session Judge, Thoubal. While the
petitioner was in police and judicial custody, she was fully co-operating with the investigating
authorities to find out the exact truth and after her release on bail, she gave full co-operation in
investigating the said FIR. [6] The concerned authorities are still not issuing any revocation order of
the suspension of the petitioner. However, the State Government issued an order dated 25.04.2022
for affording subsistence allowance at an amount equal to 50% of the leave salary.
[7] A Single Judge passed an order dated 09.08.2022 in Cril.Petn. No. 37 of 2021 filed by one Md.
Abdul Hakim (co-accused) for quashing the said FIR and allowed the petition by quashing the FIR
No. 86(09) 2021 Lil-PS on the ground that no headway has been made in terms of implicating the
petitioner in any wrongdoing. When the allegations made in the FIR or the complaint and the
evidence collected in support of the same do not even made out a case against the accused and the
police has not even Cril.Pet. No. 50 of 2022 Page 3 determined whether the fire in question was
caused by human hand or otherwise and no incriminating material has been gathered by them
against the petitioner till date. [8] Respondent Nos. 3 & 4 filed affidavit-in-opposition wherein it is
stated that as per the disclosure of the complainant, respondent No. 5 herein, the petitioner and
others were suspected of committing the offence and they were accordingly arrested and
interrogated. Beyond this, the affidavit-in-opposition is of no assistance as it is mostly rhetorical and
made reference to case law without addressing factual aspects.

[9] Mr. T. Rajendra, learned senior counsel for the petitioner, who also appeared on behalf of the
co-accused in Crl. Petn. No. 37 of 2021, submits that there are no materials against the petitioner
herein with respect to the offences alleged against her. In the counter affidavit of the State, it is
stated that the cause of the fire was by 'some unknown person' and the petitioner and other
co-accused were only suspected without any material as there were staying in the office complex.
Vide order dated 09.08.2022 in Crl. Petn. No. 37 of 2021, learned Single Judge quashed the FIR No.
86(09)2021 LIL PS along with all proceedings consequential there qua the co- accused Md. Abdul
Hakim. While passing the above order, learned Single Judge relied on the decision in the case of
State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal: 1992 Supp (1) SCC
335. Learned senior counsel has pointed out that in the case of the present petitioner, the
prosecution has not able to find out any cogent material to implicate her in the FIR case.
Cril.Pet. No. 50 of 2022 Page 4
[10] Mr. T. Rajendra, learned senior counsel for the petitioner further relies on
the case laws of State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal: 1992 Supp (1) SCC 335 and Ashok Chaturvedi v.
Shiyul H. Chanchani: AIR 1998 SC 2796 to the points that no materials are found against the
petitioner for her involvement in the case and the petitioner has been implicated on the basis of
mere suspicion and counter affidavit of State indicate possibility of involvement of 'some unknown
persons'. It is prayed that as held earlier order by this Court in the case of co-accused, the FIR
against the petitioner be quashed due to absence of any material for proceeding against her. [11] Per
contra, Mr. H. Samarjit, learned PP draws the attention of this Court to the fact that the case of the
petitioner is different from that of co-accused Abdul Hakim. It is pointed out that as the petitioner
was a chowkidar staying in the office campus for its safety, she had a bigger role and she would be
responsible for any lapses. It is submitted that she cannot get the benefit of order dated 09.08.2022
passed by this Court quashing the same FIR against the co-accused Md. Abdul Hakim. It is prayed
that the present petition be dismissed and the petitioner ought to face the trial.
[12] This Court has considered the rival submissions made at bar, the materials on record and the
original case record submitted by the prosecution. [13] On perusal of the statements recorded under
Section 161 CrPC of the witnesses including eyewitnesses who were present when the fire broke out,
none of the witnesses named the petitioner as one of the suspects. One of the witnesses named
Cril.Pet. No. 50 of 2022 Page 5 three persons as probable suspects, but he did not mention the name
of the petitioner. There is not much headway in the investigation. Even though the petitioner was
present at the spot along with many other people, nothing is indicated for her involvement. Perhaps
her presence is quite natural, as she was staying in the office complex as a chowkidar.
[14] In the famous case of State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal: 1992 Supp (1) SCC 335 @ Para 102 & 103,
a 2 Judge Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court illustrated circumstances under which criminal
proceedings could be quashed exercising inherent power under Section 482 CrPC of extraordinary
power under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.

Mrs. Jebun vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 11 December, 2023
102. In the backdrop of the interpretation of the various relevant provisions of the Code under
Chapter XIV and of the principles of law enunciated by this Court in a series of decisions relating to
the exercise of the extraordinary power under Article 226 or the inherent powers under Section 482
of the Code which we have extracted and reproduced above, we give the following categories of cases
by way of illustration wherein such power could be exercised either to prevent abuse of the process
of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice, though it may not be possible to lay down any
precise, clearly defined and sufficiently channelised and inflexible guidelines or rigid formulae and
to give an exhaustive list of myriad kinds of cases wherein such power should be exercised.
(1) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the complaint, even if they are
taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or
make out a case against the accused.
(2) Where the allegations in the first information report and other materials, if any, accompanying
the FIR do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an investigation by police officers under
Section 156(1) of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within the purview of Section
155(2) of the Code.
(3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or complaint and the evidence collected
in support of the same do not Cril.Pet. No. 50 of 2022 Page 6 disclose the commission of any offence
and make out a case against the accused.
(4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable offence but constitute only a
non-cognizable offence, no investigation is permitted by a police officer without an order of a
Magistrate as contemplated under Section 155(2) of the Code. (5) Where the allegations made in the
FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently improbable on the basis of which no prudent person
can ever reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused.
(6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of the Code or the
concerned Act (under which a criminal proceeding is instituted) to the institution and continuance
of the proceedings and/or where there is a specific provision in the Code or the concerned Act,
providing efficacious redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party.
(7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and/or where the proceeding
is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a
view to spite him due to private and personal grudge.
103. We also give a note of caution to the effect that the power of quashing a criminal proceeding
should be exercised very sparingly and with circumspection and that too in the rarest of rare cases;
that the court will not be justified in embarking upon an enquiry as to the reliability or genuineness
or otherwise of the allegations made in the FIR or the complaint and that the extraordinary or
inherent powers do not confer an arbitrary jurisdiction on the court to act according to its whim or
caprice. [15] Considering the facts of the present case juxtaposing with the seven tests laid down in
Bhajan Lal case (supra), conditions Nos. (1), (3) & (5) are satisfied. Forcing the petitioner to face the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/105839087/ 4
Mrs. Jebun vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 11 December, 2023
rigors of a criminal proceedings with these insufficient materials collected by the prosecution would
amount to abuse of criminal proceeding. The higher court, as a harbinger for the custodian of
personal liberty of a citizen, shall not shy from exercising its inherent jurisdiction to terminate such
criminal proceedings.
Cril.Pet. No. 50 of 2022 Page 7
[16] Accordingly, the criminal petition under Section 482 CrPC is allowed and
FIR No. 86(09)2021 Lilong PS under Sections 436 & 34 IPC and Sections 3 & 4 of the Prevention of
Damage to Public Property, 1984 along with all incidental proceedings is quashed qua the
petitioner. Return the case record along with a copy of this order.
