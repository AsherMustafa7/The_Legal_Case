and perused the records.
2. These applications u/s 482 have been filed by the applicants with the prayer to quash impugned
Charge Sheet No.302 of 2022 dated 11.11.2022 and impugned Summoning order dated 09.05.2023
as well as the entire proceedings of Criminal Case No.3841 of 2023, arising out of Case Crime
No.251 of 2022 (State vs. Brijesh Kumar and Others), under Sections 498-A, 323, 504, 506 I.P.C.
and Section 3/4 D.P. Act, Police Station- Tal Behat, District- Lalitpur, pending in the court of
learned Civil Judge (J.D.)/F.T.C., Lalitpur, on the basis of compromise.
3. On 12.12.2024, the following order was passed in the matter:-
"1. Learned counsel for opposite party no.2 has filed short counter affidavit in the
Court today, which is taken on record. Office is directed to register the same.
2. Heard learned counsel for the applicants, learned counsel for the opposite party
no.2 as well as learned A.G.A. for the State and perused the material on record.
3. The present 482 Cr.P.C. application has been filed to quash the impugned Charge
Sheet No.302 of 2022 dated 11.11.2022 and impugned Summoning order dated
09.05.2023 as well as the entire proceedings of Criminal Case No.3841 of 2023,

their dispute and a compromise has been entered into between the parties after
which they have decided to live together. The copy of the said compromise/mutual

proceedings of the aforesaid case be quashed in the light of law laid down by the Apex
Court in the case of Gian Singh v. State of Punjab reported in (2012) 10 SCC 303.

between the parties even in respect of certain cognizable and non compoundable offences. Reference

Another; 2013 (83) ACC 278 and Pramod & Another Vs. State of U.P. & Another (Application U/S
482 No.12174 of 2020, decided on 23rd February, 2021) and Daxaben Vs. State of Gujarat, reported
