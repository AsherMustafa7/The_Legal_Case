ORDER
******************** This common order will govern the captioned two writ petitions and the
captioned miscellaneous petitions (MPs) therein.
2. Captioned writ petitions pertain to 'Arulmigu Thirthavari Sri Irullappa Swami Thirukovil' situate
at Palanganatham in Madurai South Taluk, Madurai District (hereinafter be referred to as 'said
Temple' for the sake of convenience and clarity).
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.(MD)Nos.8130 and 8684 of 2014
3. Appointment of a Fit person to said Temple by the jurisdictional Assistant Commissioner of the
'Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious & Charitable Endowments Department' which shall hereinafter be
referred to as 'TNHR&CE Dept' for the sake of convenience and clarity is the trigger for the
captioned writ petitions.
4. Captioned writ petitions are more than seven years old in this Court. In this order,
'W.P(MD).No.8130 of 2014' shall be referred to as 'senior W.P' and 'W.P(MD).No.8684 of 2014'
shall be referred to as 'junior W.P' for the sake of convenience and clarity. Senior W.P was filed on
06.05.2014 and junior W.P was filed on 02.06.2014. In the junior W.P an interim order has been
granted on 03.06.2014 and in deference to the interim order the aforementioned order appointing
Fit person i.e., 'order dated 11.01.2013 bearing reference Sa.Mu.Na.Ka. 3192/11/Aa2' (hereinafter
referred to as 'first impugned order' for the sake of convenience and clarity) and 'order dated
01.04.2013 bearing reference Nee.Mu.No.15618/2013/E1' (hereinafter referred to as 'second
impugned order') made by the jurisdictional Joint Commissioner of TNHR&CE Dept have been kept
in abeyance or in other words have not been acted upon for half a decade and two years (7 years)
now. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.(MD)Nos.8130 and 8684 of 2014
5. An individual who claims that he is entitled to be in administration of said Temple has filed the
captioned writ petitions. Senior W.P was filed assailing an 'order dated 30.04.2014 bearing
reference Na.Ka.80/2014' made by the jurisdictional Inspector of TNHR&CE Dept (hereinafter
referred to as 'third impugned order' for the sake of convenience and clarity) vide which the
jurisdictional Inspector of TNHR&CE Dept had called upon the writ petitioner to handover details
of immovable property, bank accounts of said Temple to a Fit person. To be noted, vide first
impugned order, the jurisdictional Assistant Commissioner-TNHR&CE Dept had appointed a Fit
Person qua said Temple which was followed by the second impugned order vide which the
jurisdictional Joint Commissioner-TNHR&CE Dept at Chennai had made orders noticing that said
Temple is included as No.305 in a list of small temples.
6. In the hearing today Mr.Mahaboob Athiff of M/s.Ajmal Associates (Law Firm) on behalf of writ
petitioner in both the captioned main writ petitions and Mr.M.Lingadurai, learned Special
Government Pleader assisted by Mr.T.Amjadkhan, learned Government Advocate on
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.(MD)Nos.8130 and 8684 of 2014 behalf of official
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123178699/ 3
E.Murali Manohar vs The Assistant Commissioner on 10 December, 2021
respondents (respondents 1 and 2 in senior W.P and respondents 1 to 3 in junior W.P) are before
me. In today's hearing also the third respondent in senior W.P and fourth respondent in junior W.P
(private respondent) is not before me though this private respondent has entered appearance
through a counsel and name of the counsel is duly shown in the cause list. Private respondent is
more in the nature of an informant and therefore at the highest a formal party. In this view of the
matter as private respondent was not there before this Court in the previous listing also, I proceed
with the cases on hand.
7. Learned counsel for writ petitioner very fairly submitted that a decision in the junior W.P will
decide the fate of the senior W.P also. Therefore, I had the junior W.P heard out which in any case is
dovetailed with the senior W.P and is inextricably intertwined with the factual matrix qua senior
W.P.
8. Assailing the first impugned order and second impugned order which are impugned orders in
junior W.P, learned counsel for writ petitioner made three submissions and they are as follows:
(i) The writ petitioner was not put on prior notice https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.(MD)Nos.8130 and 8684 of 2014 before the first impugned order appointing Fit
Person was made;
(ii) The first impugned order talks about a report of the jurisdictional Inspector but
the writ petitioner was not favoured with a copy of the same; and
(iii) The above are violation of principles of natural justice (NJP).
9. In response to the above submission, learned Special Government Pleader, adverting to the
detailed common counter-affidavit filed on behalf of respondents submitted that the case of the writ
petitioner is predicated on the premise that the said Temple is a private temple but there is no
declaration to this effect the said Temple is not a private temple and therefore the appointment of
Fit Person under Section 49 of 'the Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act,
1959 (Tamil Nadu Act 22 of 1959)' [hereinafter be referred to as 'TNHR&CE Act' for the sake of
brevity] is in order, it deserves to be sustained and the writ petitioner who merely claims that he has
a right to be in administration qua said Temple cannot insist on prior notice.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.(MD)Nos.8130 and 8684 of 2014
10. In response to the above submissions, learned counsel for writ petitioner submitted that there is
no disputation that the writ petitioner is in administration as even the first impugned order refers to
the writ petitioner as 'eilKiw eph;thfp' and writ petitioner is the second noticee in the first impugned
order.
11. I carefully considered the rival pleadings, the competing arguments on either side and the
records that were placed before me (to be noted, learned State counsel were assisted by the Suit
Inspector of TNHR&CE Dept). On a careful analysis of the arguments, case file and the records, I am
of the considered view that the prayer of the writ petitioner in junior W.P cannot be acceded to and

E.Murali Manohar vs The Assistant Commissioner on 10 December, 2021
as a sequitur the senior W.P becomes a non starter. Reasons are as follows:
a) The entire pleadings of the writ petitioner in both the writ petitions are predicated
on the premise that the writ petitioner has a right. It is not a question of the writ
petitioner being in administration, it is a question of whether writ petitioner has right
to be in administration. If the writ petitioner has a right to be in administration, the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.(MD)Nos.8130 and 8684 of 2014 same should
be recognized either under the TNHR&CE Act or it should have been taken out of the
sweep of the TNHR&CE Act by a manner known to law;
b) A careful perusal of the pleadings bring to light that the burden of the song qua the
writ petitioner is two-
fold and it is rather intriguing as to how such a two-fold plea is being taken. In one breath the writ
petitioner says the said Temple is a denominational temple and in the same breath the writ
petitioner also says the said Temple is a private temple. However, both these pleas are not supported
by any shred of paper. Therefore, absent any declaration that the said Temple is denominational
temple (traceable to under Section 107 of TNHR&CE Act read in conjunction with Article 25(2) of
the Constitution of India) or a declaration that the said Temple is a private temple, said temple
clearly comes within the sweep of Sub-section (3) of Section 1 of TNHR&CE Act. Only other
exclusion is exemption by the Government under Section 4 and that is also absent in the case on
hand;
(c) 'Temple' is defined vide Section 6(20) of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.(MD)Nos.8130
and 8684 of 2014 TNHR&CE Act and 'religious institution' is defined under Section 6(18) of
TNHR&CE Act. A careful perusal of these two definitions will bring to light that Temple is a
religious institution within the meaning of Section 6(18) and therefore, a temple would per se come
within the sweep of Section 1(3) of TNHR&CE Act. Law is well settled that there is a presumption
qua public temple and it is for the protagonists of petitions of the nature on hand to demonstrate to
the Court that the petitioner or the religious institution concerned is outside the sweep of
TNHR&CE Act. I do not propose to dilate further on such elucidation as I propose to leave open a
window to the writ petitioner to approach the authorities under Chapter V of TNHR&CE Act or by
way of alternate remedy, the details of which will be set out elsewhere infra in this order. The
argument predicated on prior notice and copy of the report of the Inspector and NJP violation may
arise if the writ petitioner had been recognized as a Trustee in one manner or the other either under
the TNHR&CE Act or as already alluded to supra, the said Temple should have been taken out of the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.(MD)Nos.8130 and 8684 of 2014 sweep of the TNHR&CE
Act in one manner or the other known to law. The records placed before me bring to light that said
Temple is situate in land admeasuring 135 square meters or thereabouts comprised in old S.No.170
vide 18D/A in Madurai Town, Madurai South Taluk (Block 45, Ward XXII) in Madurai District. This
land as per the Town Survey Register (TSR) is a Government poramboke land. This by itself is a
strong pointer against the contention of the writ petitioner that said Temple is a private temple. To
be noted, this is on a demurer, as already alluded to supra there is no shred of document on the part
of the writ petitioner to demonstrate that said Temple is a private temple or that it is a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123178699/ 5
E.Murali Manohar vs The Assistant Commissioner on 10 December, 2021
denominational temple;
(d) The writ petitioner had alternate remedy qua the impugned orders i.e., first impugned order and
second impugned order inter alia under Section 21-A, more particularly 21-A Sub-section (5) and
Section 21 of TNHR&CE Act. These are statutory revisions but the writ petitioner has not chosen to
avail the alternate remedy. It may well have been prudent on the part of the writ
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.(MD)Nos.8130 and 8684 of 2014 petitioner to have availed
the statutory alternate remedy as the matter turns largely on certain factual disputations. It is still
open to writ petitioner but subject to limitation and Section 14 of Limitation Act if the chronological
trajectory enures to the benefit of the writ petitioner in this regard.
12. Having set out the reasons i.e., having set out the dispositive reasoning for not acceding to the
prayers of the writ petitioner, I now proceed to write the other operative portion/parts of this order.
13. The above observations have been made for the limited purpose of disposal of captioned writ
petitions. Therefore, if the writ petitioner chooses to avail the alternate remedy or if the writ
petitioner chooses to approach the authorities concerned under the TNHR&CE Act, more
particularly in accordance with Chapter V of TNHR&CE Act captioned inquiry, it is well open to
quasi-judicial adjudication authority under Chapter V of the TNHR&CE Act to deal with such pleas
on their own merits and in accordance with law untrammeled by observations made in this order.
The same will apply to alternate remedy. However, alternate remedy will be subject to limitation as
indicated elsewhere https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.(MD)Nos.8130 and 8684 of 2014 supra
in this order. The question of limitation qua alternate remedy has to be decided by the authorities
concerned. It will suffice to say that it is open to the writ petitioner to take recourse to Section 14 of
the Limitation Act, 1963 but that again will be a decision or a call which the revisional authority may
have to take.
14. In the light of the narrative, discussion and dispositive reasoning set out supra, all three
captioned writ petitions fail and are dismissed albeit preserving the rights of the writ petitioner to
the limited extent indicated supra in this order. Consequently, captioned MPs also fail and they are
also dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs.
