Shiva, Devendra, Pooran, Bavita, Sunita and Anurag, who are father-in-law, brother-in-law (devar),
sister-in-law (nanad), uncles-in-law, aunts-in-law and brother-in-law (devar) of the deceased
respectively, making allegations inter alia that marriage of his daughter was solemnized in July,
2022 with Rinku, but after some days of her marriage the accused persons started harassing and
assaulting her mounting pressure to bring additional dowry. On 16.06.2024 when his son-in-law
was not at home, who is presently doing a private job in Delhi, the accused persons in collusion with
each other started mounting pressure upon his daughter to bring Rs. 50,000/- (rupees fifty
thousand) from her father. On account of said reason on 17.06.2024, she was done to death and her
dead body was thrown at the railway track near Govindpur village.
4-Main substratum of argument of learned counsel for the applicant is that the applicant is
father-in-law of the deceased and has been falsely implicated in this case. He is a disabled person
and aged about 60 years. He further submits that co-accused Devendra Singh and Pooran Singh
have been granted anticipatory bail vide common order 23.11.2024 in Criminal Misc. Anticipatory
Bail Application No. 11076 of 2024 and co-accused Anurag alias Chuhiya and Devendra Singh have
been granted bail by this Court vide orders dated 29.11.2024 and 10.12.2024 in Criminal Misc. Bail
Application Nos. 42523 of 2023 and 44190 of 2024 respectively, therefore the applicant who is
languishing in jail since 19.09.2024 may be released on bail.
5-Per contra, learned Additional Government Advocate for the State opposed the prayer for bail of
the applicant by contending that there is no major disability of the applicant because as per
disability certificate dated 17.01.2006 of the applicant filed as Annexure no.5, his disability is on
account of non formation of thumb. There is specific allegation of demand of dowry and harassment
of the deceased adopting different modus operandi against the applicant. Dead body of the deceased
was found on the railway track. After the incident, accused persons had absconded. Referring the
post-mortem report of the deceased, it is pointed out that following ante-mortem injuries have been
noted by the doctor :-
(i) Missing of head along with neck.
(ii) Missing of left shoulder along with left upper limb.
(iii) Amputation of right shoulder joint along with right arm and forearm.
(iv) Amputation of left lower limb from lower 2-3rd of femur bone.
(v) ?over the right ankle joint with missing of right foot.
It is further pointed out that Smt. Pinki (elder sister of the deceased-Sunita) has stated inter-alia
that on receiving information when she went to matrimonial home of his sister-Sunita along with
her brother-in-law, she saw there was blood in Sunita's room and verandah and stool on her sisters
bed. She also saw stool on the stairs. On making enquiry about the same, the villagers were standing
on the roof of their house but no one came down. The people who were standing there told that the
accused persons have killed Sunita and taken her away from here. Thereafter, she called mobile

police by dialing 112. Later on, the dead body of her sister was found on a railway track, which was
severed in many pieces. Much emphasis has been given by contending that in this case, Rinku, who
is husband of the deceased has not been made accused because at the time of incident, he was not at
the spot but he was present at Gurgaon, where he does a private job in Zomato Company. During
investigation, the investigating officer also recorded the statement of Rinku (husband of the
deceased), who has also made allegation against his family members for committing murder of his
wife Sunita stating inter-alia that on 20.06.2024, he was told by Mahesh Fauji that on the day of
incident at about 11:00 o'clock, Rohit and Shivani @ Shiva were dragging his wife through rope and
both of them made her sit on a motorcycle inside the house and tied her with a sack. Rohit and
Shivani left with Sunita, the remaining people, namely, Devendra, Babita, Pooran Singh, Anurag @
Chuhia, Sunita and Rajnath Singh followed them on motorcycle. At that time his son was was locked
in a room because he was weeping. Rinku has made specific allegation against his father Rajnath
stating that he used to misbehave with his wife and used to mount pressure upon his wife to bring
Rs. 50,000/- from her parents. On the strength of aforesaid submissions, it is submitted that there
are enough material of cruelty against the applicant and other co-accused persons, hence, the bail
application of the applicant is liable to be rejected.
6-Having heard learned counsel for the parties and examined the matter in its entirety, I find that it
is not in dispute that the deceased died in her in-law's house under abnormal circumstances within
two years of her marriage. There is serious allegation of taking the dead body of the deceased from
the house and throwing it on the railway track. As per post-mortem report, many parts of body of
the deceased were missing. The son of the applicant is one of the witnesses of occurrence.
Considering the nature and manner of crime, I find it is a most heinous offence, hence, I do not find
any good ground to enlarge the applicant on bail.
7-Accordingly, the instant bail application is rejected.
8-It is made clear that the observations contained in the instant order are confined to the issue of
bail and shall not affect the merit of the trial.
