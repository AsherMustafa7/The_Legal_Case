JUDGMENT
This intra court appeal takes an exception to order dated 05.12.2013 passed in writ petition
Nos.5417-5420/2009 and writ petition No.17517/2009, by which the petition preferred by
respondent in which challenge was made to the proceedings under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894
(hereinafter referred to as 'the Act' for short) has been allowed.
2. Facts giving rise to filing of this appeal briefly stated are that land bearing survey number 64
situated at Koratagere Town Kasaba, Tumkur District was an Inam land (hereinafter referred to as
the '[schedule land' for short) was governed by the provisions of Religious and Charitable Inams
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/92089128/ 2
The Town Panchayat vs Sri Krishnappa on 7 November, 2022
Abolition Act, 1955. The father of respondent was a permanent tenant in respect of aforesaid land
who was granted occupancy rights in respect of schedule land measuring 17 acres and 10 guntas.
3. The appellant is the town Panchayat constituted under the provisions of Karnataka Municipalities
Act, 1964. The Panchayat was in need of schedule land as well as land measuring 7 acres of Survey
No.64 for the purposes of Solid Waste Management at Koratagere Town. Thereupon, proceeding
under the Act were set in motion. A Notification under Section 4(1) invoking urgency provision
under Section 17(1) of the Act was issued on 09.12.2004, by which land measuring 3.03 acres was
notified for acquisition.
4. The aforesaid notification was published in the Gazette on 30.12.2004, whereas, the same was
published in newspaper on 17.12.2004 . Even though the urgency provision under Section 17(1) of
the Act was invoked, after a period of 14 months, final notification under section 6 of the Act was
issued on 16.02.2006. Thereafter, the possession of the schedule land was taken on 09.11.2006 and
an award was passed in respect of schedule land on 21.06.2008.
5. Land measuring 7 acres of Sy.No.64 was also required by the appellant for Solid Waste
Management at Koratagere Town. Therefore, a preliminary notification under Section 4(1) read with
Section 17 of the Act was issued on 01.10.2005. After a period of 9 months, notification under
Section 6(1) of the Act was issued on 14.07.2006 and an award was passed on 14.11.2008.
6. The validity of the aforesaid notification was assailed by the respondents in a writ petition. The
learned Single Judge by an order dated 05.12.2013 inter alia held that in the facts and circumstances
of the case, there was no justification for invocation of the provisions of Section 17 of the Act. It was
further held that since, an award has been passed beyond a period of two years from the date of
publication of declaration under Section 6 of the Act, the same has lapsed under Section 11A of the
Act. Accordingly, the proceedings for acquisition of the land initiated by the State Government were
quashed. In the aforesaid factual background, this appeal has been filed.
7. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that even though the award has been passed beyond
a period of two years from the date of publication of declaration under Section 6 of the Act, yet 80%
of the amount of compensation a required to be tendered as per Section 17(3A) of the Act was
tendered before taking possession of the lands. Therefore, the provision of Section 11A of the Act are
not attracted to the fact situation of the case. It is further submitted that since, the land was required
for public purpose urgently i.e., for the purpose of Solid Waste Management at Koratagere Town.
Therefore, the State Government was justified in invoking the provisions of Section 17 of the Act. It
is however submitted that the appellant does not require the land measuring 7 acres. In support of
the submission that the provisions of Section 11A of the Act are not applicable to the fact situation of
the case, reliance has been placed on decision of the Supreme Court rendered in 'DELHI AIR TECH
SERVICES PRIVATE LIMITED AND ANOTHER VS. STATE OF U.P. AND ANR.', 2022 SCC
ONLINE SC 1408.
8. On the other hand, learned Senior counsel for the respondent submitted that learned Single
Judge has correctly concluded that the action of the State Government in invoking the provisions
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/92089128/ 3
The Town Panchayat vs Sri Krishnappa on 7 November, 2022
under Section 17 of the Act is not justified in law. It is further submitted that learned Single judge
has rightly held that the proceeding for acquisition of the land has lapsed under Section 11A of the
Act. In support of aforesaid submission has placed reliance on decision of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in 'UNION OF INDIA AND OTHERS VS. SHIV RAJ AND OTHERS', (2014) 6 SCC 564,
'DEVENDRA KUMAR TYAGI AND OTHERS VS. STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH AND OTHERS',
(2011) 9 SCC 164, 'DEVENDRA SINGH AND OTHERS VS. STATE OF UTTARPRADESH AND
OTHERS', (2011) 9 SCC 551 and 'RADHY SHYAM (DEAD) THROUGH LRS AND OTHERS VS.
STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH AND OTHERS', (2011) 5 SCC 553.
9. On the other hand, learned Additional Government Advocate on perusal of the record fairly stated
that 80% of the amount of compensation, which is required to be tendered in terms of Section
17(3A) of the Act has not been tendered.
10. We have considered the submissions made on both sides and have perused the records. Twin
issues arise for consideration in this appeal Firstly whether the proceeding has lapsed in view of
Section 11 of the Act, and secondly, whether the State Government was justified in invoking the
urgency provisions under Section 17 of the Act.
11. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in 'HINDUSTAN PETROLEUM CORPN. LTD. VS. DARIUS
CHENAI', (2005) 7 SCC 627 held that in view of Article 300-A of the Constitution of India, the State
in exercise of power of eminent domain may interfere with the right of the property of a person by
acquiring the same but the same must be for a public purpose and reasonable compensation
therefor must be paid. In 'N.PADMAMMA VS. S.RAMAKRISHNA REDDY', (2008) 15 SCC 517, it
was held that right to hold the property is a human right as also a constitutional right and the same
cannot be taken away except in accordance with law. Article 300-A of the Constitution of India
protects the right to hold the property. Similar view was taken in 'DELHI AIR TECH SERVICES (P.)
LTD. VS. STATE OF U.P.', (2011) 9 SCC 354. The aforesaid principles were reiterated with approval
in VIDYA DEVI VS. STATE OF HIMACHAL PRADESH', (2020) 2 SCC 569.
12. Section 11A as well as Section 17(3A) of the Act which are relevant for the purpose of controversy
involved in this appeal are extracted below for the facility of reference:
11A Period within which an award shall be made. --
(1) The Collector shall make an award under section 11 within a period of two years
from the date of the publication of the declaration and if no award is made within
that period, the entire proceedings for the acquisition of the land shall lapse:
17 Special powers in cases of urgency.
(3A) Before taking possession of any land under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2), the Collector
shall, without prejudice to the provisions of sub-section (3),--
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/92089128/ 4
The Town Panchayat vs Sri Krishnappa on 7 November, 2022
(a) tender payment of eighty per centum of the compensation for such land as estimated by him to
the persons interested entitled thereto, and
(b) pay it to them, unless prevented by some one or more of the contingencies mentioned in section
31, sub-section (2), and where the Collector is so prevented, the provisions of section 31, sub-section
(2), (except the second proviso thereto), shall apply as they apply to the payment of compensation
under that section.
13. Thus, from perusal of Section 11A of the Act, it is evident that in case, an award is not passed
within a period of two years from the date of publication of declaration, the entire proceedings for
acquisition of the land shall lapse. Section 17(3A) of the Act provides that before taking possession
of the land under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2), the Collector shall, without prejudice to the
provisions of sub-section (3), tender payment of eighty per centum of the compensation for such
land as estimated by him to the persons interested entitled thereto. A three judge bench of Hon'ble
Supreme Court in DELHI AIRTECH SERVICES PRIVATE LIMITED AND ANOTHER supra, has
held as follows:
26. In the result, we pass the following order:
(i) The provision contained in
Section 11A of Act, 1894 shall be
applicable to cases in which the acquiring authority has not complied with the
requirement of sub-section (3A) to Section 17 of Act, 1894 by tendering and paying
eighty per centum of the estimated compensation before taking possession since
possession in such cases cannot be considered to be taken in accordance with law and
the vesting is not absolute.
(ii) If the requirement is complied and possession is taken after tendering and paying eighty per
centum, though there is need to pass an award any pay the balance compensation within a
reasonable time, the rigour of Section 11A of Act, 1894 will not apply so as to render the entire
proceedings for acquisition to lapse in the context of absolute vesting. The right of land loser in such
case is to enforce passing of the award and recover the compensation.
14. We have perused the record. Admittedly, in the instant case, the collector has not tendered 80%
of the amount of compensation before taking the possession of the land in question i.e., on or before
09.11.2006. Therefore, in view of the law laid down by three-judge bench of Hon'ble Supreme Court
in DELHI AIRTECH SERVICES PRIVATE LIMITED (SUPRA), the provisions of Section 11A of the
Act apply to the fact situation of the case. The notification in respect of acquisition of land
measuring 3.03 acres has been issued on 09.12.2004. The final notification was issued on
16.02.2006 and the award was passed beyond a period of 2 years i.e., on 21.06.2008. Therefore, the
learned Single Judge has rightly concluded that the proceedings in respect of land measuring 3.03
acres of survey number 64 situated at Koratagere Town Kasaba, Tumkur District have lapsed under
Section 11 of the Act. As far as the dispute pertaining to 7 acres of land of Sy.No.64 is concerned. The

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/92089128/ 5
The Town Panchayat vs Sri Krishnappa on 7 November, 2022
U.P. AND OTHERS', (2021) SCC ONLINE SC 1115 referred to with approval the principles laid down
in Radhy Shyam's case supra has dealt with the scope and ambit of the exercise of powers under
Section 17 of the Act. Para 77 of the decision rendered Radhy Shyam's case supra reads as under:
77. From the analysis of the relevant statutory provisions and interpretation thereof
by this Court in different cases, the following principles can be culled out:
(i) Eminent domain is a right inherent in every sovereign to take and appropriate
property belonging to citizens for public use. To put it differently, the sovereign is
entitled to reassert its dominion over any portion of the soil of the State including
private property without its owner's consent provided that such assertion is on
account of public exigency and for public good. - Dwarkadas Shrinivas v. Sholapur
Spinning and Weaving Co. Ltd., AIR (1954) SC 119, Chiranjit Lal Chowdhuri v. Union
of India AIR (1951) SC 41 and Jilubhai Nanbhai Khachar v. State of Gujarat (1995)
Supp. (1) SCC 596.
(ii) The legislations which provide for compulsory acquisition of private property by
the State fall in the category of expropriatory legislation and such legislation must be
construed strictly - DLF Qutab Enclave Complex Educational Charitable Trust v.
State of Haryana (2003) 5 SCC 622; State of Maharashtra v. B.E. Billimoria (2003) 7
SCC 336 and Dev Sharan v. State of U.P., Civil Appeal No.2334 of 2011 decided on
7.3.2011.
(iii) Though, in exercise of the power of eminent domain, the Government can acquire the private
property for public purpose, it must be remembered that compulsory taking of one's property is a
serious matter. If the property belongs to economically disadvantaged segment of the society or
people suffering from other handicaps, then the Court is not only entitled but is duty bound to
scrutinize the action/decision of the State with greater vigilance, care and circumspection keeping in
view the fact that the land owner is likely to become landless and deprived of the only source of his
livelihood and/or shelter.
(iv) The property of a citizen cannot be acquired by the State and/or its agencies/instrumentalities
without complying with the mandate of Sections 4, 5-A and 6 of the Act. A public purpose, however,
laudable it may be does not entitle the State to invoke the urgency provisions because the same have
the effect of depriving the owner of his right to property without being heard. Only in a case of real
urgency, the State can invoke the urgency provisions and dispense with the requirement of hearing
the land owner or other interested persons.
(v) Section 17(1) read with Section 17(4) confers extraordinary power upon the State to acquire
private property without complying with the mandate of Section 5-A. These provisions can be
invoked only when the purpose of acquisition cannot brook the delay of even few weeks or months.
Therefore, before excluding the application of Section 5-A, the concerned authority must be fully
satisfied that time of few weeks or months likely to be taken in conducting inquiry under Section 5-A
will, in all probability, frustrate the public purpose for which land is proposed to be acquired.

The Town Panchayat vs Sri Krishnappa on 7 November, 2022
(vi) The satisfaction of the Government on the issue of urgency is subjective but is a condition
precedent to the exercise of power under Section 17(1) and the same can be challenged on the
ground that the purpose for which the private property is sought to be acquired is not a public
purpose at all or that the exercise of power is vitiated due to mala fides or that the concerned
authorities did not apply mind to the relevant factors and the records.
(vii) The exercise of power by the Government under Section 17(1) does not necessarily result in
exclusion of Section 5- A of the Act in terms of which any person interested in land can file objection
and is entitled to be heard in support of his objection. The use of word "may" in sub- section (4) of
Section 17 makes it clear that it merely enables the Government to direct that the provisions of
Section 5-A would not apply to the cases covered under sub- section (1) or (2) of Section 17. In other
words, invoking of Section 17(4) is not a necessary concomitant of the exercise of power under
Section 17(1).
(viii) The acquisition of land for residential, commercial, industrial or institutional purposes can be
treated as an acquisition for public purposes within the meaning of Section 4 but that, by itself, does
not justify the exercise of power by the Government under Section 17(1) and/or 17(4). The Court can
take judicial notice of the fact that planning, execution and implementation of the schemes relating
to development of residential, commercial, industrial or institutional areas usually take few years.
Therefore, the private property cannot be acquired for such purpose by invoking the urgency
provision contained in Section 17(1). In any case, exclusion of the rule of audi alteram partem
embodied in Section 5-A (1) and (2) is not at all warranted in such matters.
(ix) If land is acquired for the benefit of private persons, the Court should view the invoking of
Section 17(1) and/or 17(4) with suspicion and carefully scrutinize the relevant record before
adjudicating upon the legality of such acquisition.
15. In the instant case, the notification under Section 4(1) read with Section 17(1) of the Act was
issued on 09.12.2004. If there was really an urgency in acquisition of the land, the appellant ought
to have acted with quite promptitude. However, final notification under Section 6 of the Act was
issued after a period of 14 months on 16.02.2006 and thereafter, nearly after a period of
approximately 9 months, the possession of the land in question was taken. Therefore, it is evident
that there was no urgency in acquisition of the land in question and the State Government was not
justified in invoking the urgency provision as contained in Section 17(1) of the Act.
16. Thus, it can safely be inferred that right of the respondent to a hearing under Section 5A of the
Act has been taken away without any justifiable reason. Even otherwise, learned counsel for the
appellant has stated that appellant does not require the aforesaid land.
17. Learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that since, the appellant has utilised the land in
question, therefore, the relief is be moulded in facts of the case. From perusal of the photographs
annexed with the petition, we find that the appellant has only constructed a boundary wall and has
dumped garbage on the land in question. Therefore, the land in question measuring 3.03 acres
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/92089128/ 7
The Town Panchayat vs Sri Krishnappa on 7 November, 2022
remains an open land. Therefore, the question of moulding the relief and permitting the appellant to
retain the possession of the land in question does not arise as the respondents cannot be deprived of
their constituted right under Article 300A of the Constitution of India.
In view of preceding analysis we do not find any merit in this appeal the same fails and is here by
dismissed.
