for M/s.R.Thirumoorthy
ORDER
____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis MUNISHWAR NATH BHANDARI, ACJ The
writ petition has been filed seeking a writ of mandamus to forbear the first respondent from
according its approval for the newly elected posts of Coordinator and Joint Coordinator of All India
Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) pursuant to the election notice dated 2.12.2021. An
interim injunction is also sought to restrain the fifth and sixth respondents from announcing the

J.Jayachandran vs The Election Commissioner Of India on 2 December, 2021
election result for the posts of Coordinator and Joint Coordinator pursuant to the election notice,
pending disposal of the writ petition.
2. Learned counsel submits that the petitioner is a loyal and sincere member of the second
respondent political party for more than thirty years, who rendered dedicated service for upliftment
of the people of the Tamil Nadu at large. The second respondent political party came into existence
at the instance of M.G.Ramchandran and was approved by the first respondent in the name of All
India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and allotted a symbol.
____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
3. Learned counsel further submits that recently a resolution dated 1/2.12.2021 was flashed in the
press/media relating to election to the posts of Coordinator and Joint Coordinator of AIADMK,
from which it came to light that the rule relating to election of Coordinator and Joint Coordinator
was amended by providing for direct election by primary members through a single ballot. The third
and fourth respondents jointly announced the election notice on 2.12.2021, where the date of
election to the posts of Coordinator and Joint Coordinator was mentioned to be on 7.12.2021 and,
accordingly, the fifth and sixth respondents were appointed as Election Commissioners. As per the
schedule given therein, the counting of votes and results are scheduled on 8.12.2021. The third and
fourth respondents ignored the mandatory requirement of issuance of notice 21 days prior to the
announcement of the elections and the attempt of the respondents was only to allow two
nominations excluding others.
4. Learned counsel also submits that when the petitioner made an effort to enter into the party
office, he was physically prevented ____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis and brutally
manhandled. The third and fourth respondents along with the fifth and sixth respondents did not
allow any member to submit their nomination papers and, as a consequence, the third and fourth
respondents would definitely get elected pursuant to the elections. The petitioner knowing about the
schedule of election and denial of nomination by none other than the third and fourth respondents
is left with no option but to prefer this writ petition to safeguard the democratic values of the party
and the country. The petitioner seeks conduct of free and fair election even if it is for the post in the
political party for the reason that the members of the political party are elected as Members of
Legislative Assembly and Members of Parliament after the election conducted by the Election
Commission of India. In view of the above, the petitioner challenged the election notice dated
2.12.2021 and, presently, even the result of the election conducted after sacrificing the democratic
value for which the country is known.
5. Learned counsel submits that the writ petition would be maintainable as directions have been
sought against the Election Commission of India. It is in view of the fact that every election is to
____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis be monitored by the Election Commission
under the Representation of the People Act, 1951 (for brevity, "the Act of 1951"). As all the political
parties are registered with the Election Commission of India, the Election Commission of India is
under an obligation even to monitor the internal elections of the parties to maintain the democratic
values. The Election Commission of India failed to intervene in the internal elections of the second
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/105010398/ 3
J.Jayachandran vs The Election Commissioner Of India on 2 December, 2021
respondent political party despite such elections being conducted in an unfair manner depriving any
of the members of the party to participate in the election and, therefore, the relief as sought should
be granted.
6. Referring to the judgment in the case of All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam v. State
Election Commissioner, 2007 (1) CTC 705, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that a public
interest litigation would be maintainable whenever injustice is meted out to large number of people.
The court need not insist on alternative remedy, rather in exceptional and extraordinary situations,
it can exercise the jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The democracy can
function only if there are free and fair elections. The right to vote is a constitutional right and
____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis exercise of such right is accomplishment of
freedom of expression of voters. The failure on the part of the State Election Commission to ensure
free and fair elections may require exercise of the extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India by this Court. It is for the reason that democracy can function only if there are
free and fair elections and duty of the Election Commission is to ensure the same. Taking aforesaid
into consideration, the writ petition has been filed when the Election Commission failed to exercise
its powers to maintain the democratic values and save the valuable right of the voter when it is
otherwise a constitutional right. A reference to paragraphs 147 and 148 of the said judgment was
given, apart from the direction in paragraph 253 of the judgment, to impress upon the Court not
only to entertain the writ petition, but to issue appropriate direction on the Election Commission
not to accord approval for the newly elected posts of Coordinator and Joint Coordinator, rather to
pass appropriate orders to nullify the internal elections of the second respondent political party.
7. Learned counsel for the petitioner has given further reference ____________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis of the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Board of Control
for Cricket in India v. Cricket Association of Bihar and others, (2015) 3 SCC 251, wherein also the
objection to the maintainability of the writ petition against the BCCI was raised. The Apex Court did
not accept the objection, rather the writ petition was maintained keeping in mind the affairs of the
BCCI not only to select the cricket team to represent the country, but even other functions of the
BCCI. Those functions were taken to be public functions and thereby the writ petition was held
maintainable. The expression "State" appearing in Article 12 of the Constitution of India was given
meaning. It is the case of the petitioner that the said judgment is squarely applicable to the present
case. The second respondent political party, AIADMK, represents the public in the elections and
thereby the writ petition would be maintainable against it. A further reference to an earlier
judgment in the case of Zee Telefilms Ltd v. Union of India, (2005) 4 SCC 649, has been given in
paragraph 30 of the judgment in Board of Control for Cricket in India (supra), where the scope of
Article 12 of the Constitution of India was elaborately discussed and held that if the function of a
body is of public nature or State function, the writ petition would be ____________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis maintainable and, accordingly, the prayer is made not only to
maintain the writ petition, but to issue appropriate direction nullifying the election to the posts of
Coordinator and Joint Coordinator of the second respondent political party.
8. We have considered the submission made by learned counsel for the petitioner and perused the
records.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/105010398/ 4
J.Jayachandran vs The Election Commissioner Of India on 2 December, 2021
9. The writ petition has been filed by impleading the Election Commission of India as a party
respondent, apart from the political party (AIADMK) and other private parties as respondents to the
litigation. The petitioner sought directions against the Election Commission of India not to accord
its approval to the newly elected posts of Coordinator and Joint Coordinator of the second
respondent political party. The prayer aforesaid is made without showing or referring to a provision
under the Act of 1951, which obligates the Election Commission to approve the internal elections of
the political party. Learned counsel for the petitioner could not specify the role of the Election
Commission in the internal elections of the political party. It is apart from the fact that no provision
could be referred to ____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis approve or given
cognizance to the result of internal party elections. Thus, learned counsel for the petitioner could
not clarify as to why Election Commission of India has been impleaded as a party respondent. The
issue aforesaid is quite relevant for the reason that all other respondents are private parties in
reference to which question of maintainability of the writ petition needs to be examined.
10. Learned counsel would harp on the issue of democratic values to be maintained by the political
party, but could not refer to any provisions whereby the Election Commission can have a role so as
to pass appropriate direction on the relief prayed for by the petitioner.
11. As per Article 324 of the Constitution of India the superintendence, direction and control of
elections is vested in the Election Commission. It is not for internal election of a political party.
Section 29A of the Act of 1951 pertains to registration with the Election Commission of associations
and bodies as political parties. However, there is nothing in Section 29A that requires an enquiry to
be conducted into the fairness and validity of the internal ____________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis elections held for the posts in a political party. The objection
raised by the petitioner that the elections to the posts of Coordinator and Joint Coordinator of the
second respondent political party were held without adopting democratic procedure cannot be
countenanced, as the Election Commission is not empowered to go into the internal elections of a
political party. All that Section 29A(9) of the Act of 1951 contemplates is that after an association or
body has been registered as a political party, any change in its name, head office, office-bearers,
address, etc., shall be communicated to the Election Commission of India without any delay. Such
power does not confer any corresponding duty on the Election Commission of India to enter into the
internal elections of a political party. In view of the above, we find the impleadment of the Election
Commission of India is for the sake of it.
12. Now next issue that arises for consideration is as to whether the writ petition would be
maintainable against the respondent Nos.2 to 6, private parties. Learned counsel for the petitioner
submitted that the second respondent is discharging public function and thus a writ petition against
it would be maintainable in ____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis the light of the
judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Board of Control for Cricket in India (supra). The BCCI is
not a government functionary, yet a writ petition was found maintainable and, accordingly, applying
the same principle on the ratio propounded by the Supreme Court in the case of Board of Control for
Cricket in India (supra), the present writ petition should be entertained and, in the absence of it, the
democratic values required to be maintained by each party would stand sacrificed. It is more so
when the internal elections conducted for the second respondent political party cannot be said to be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/105010398/ 5
J.Jayachandran vs The Election Commissioner Of India on 2 December, 2021
free and fair.
13. In the case of All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam v. State Election Commissioner
(supra), the writ petition was not filed to challenge the internal elections of a political party, but the
elections to the local bodies. The allegation therein was of mass booth-capturing and rigging.
Therefore, this court took cognizance of the aforesaid to maintain the writ petition seeking free and
fair elections to the local bodies in reference to Article 243 of the Constitution. In the instant case,
the election is not to local bodies, Assembly or Parliament, but internal elections of the political
party. ____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis It is not governed by any of the provisions
of the Constitution or even the provisions of the Act of 1951 so as to direct the Election Commission
not to approve or recognise the internal elections of the party. Moreover, we have already held that
the Election Commission of India has no authority to look into the internal elections of a political
party. In view of the above, the judgment in the case of All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam
v. State Election Commissioner (supra) would have no application as a direction therein in the
concluding paragraph was in reference to the elections to local bodies and not a private body.
14. The other judgment referred by learned counsel for the petitioner is in the case of Board of
Control for Cricket in India (supra), wherein also an objection was raised about the maintainability
of writ petition. The Apex Court threadbare considered the facts of the case, and especially the
functions of the BCCI, to record its finding with reference to Article 12 of the Constitution of India
holding that the BCCI is selecting the cricket team to represent India and is discharging many other
functions of public nature and thereby discharging public duties, thus it would fall ____________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis within the ambit of Article 12 of the Constitution of India.
15. In the case on hand, the second respondent is not discharging duties of the nature discussed by
the Apex Court in the case of Board of Control for Cricket in India (supra) or even in the case of Zee
Telefilms Ltd v. Union of India (supra). In view of the above, the ratio propounded by the Apex
Court in the case of Board of Control for Cricket in India (supra) would not have any application to
the facts of this case.
16. In the light of the discussion made above, we do not find the writ petition to be maintainable
against respondent Nos.2 to 6 and no direction can be issued to the Election Commission of India in
reference to the internal election of the parties. Hence, the writ petition would not be maintainable
in the present case. It is more so when despite an opportunity to learned counsel for the petitioner,
he could not refer to any provision of the Act of 1951 empowering the Election Commission of India
to look into the internal elections of the political party.
____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis For the foregoing reasons, the writ petition fails
and is dismissed finding it to be not maintainable. No costs. Consequently, W.M.P.No. 27625 of
2021 is closed.
