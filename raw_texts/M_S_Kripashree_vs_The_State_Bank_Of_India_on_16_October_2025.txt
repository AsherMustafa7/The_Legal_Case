found entitled to in the facts and
circumstances of the case."
2. At the outset, the Learned counsel
for the respondents raised a preliminary objection
regarding the maintainability of the present writ
petition against the respondent-State Bank of
India.
3. Heard the Learned counsel for both
parties on the issue of maintainability.
4. In support of the maintainability of
Patna High Court CWJC No.14864 of 2019 dt.16-10-2025

the writ petition, the Learned counsel for the
petitioner placed reliance on the decision of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in ABL International Ltd.
and Another vs. Export Credit Guarantee
Corporation of India Ltd. & Ors., reported in
(2004) 3 SCC 553.
5. I find substance in the submissions
advanced on behalf of the petitioner. I have
perused the judgment relied upon and considered
the principles laid down therein.
6. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in ABL
International Ltd. (supra) held as follows:
"26. Therefore, this
objection must also fail because in a
given case it is open to the writ court to
give such monetary relief also.

M/S Kripashree vs The State Bank Of India on 16 October, 2025
27.From the above
discussion of ours, the following legal
principles emerge as to the
maintainability of a writ petition:
(a) In an appropriate case,
a writ petition as against a State or an
instrumentality of a State arising out of
a contractual obligation is
maintainable.
Patna High Court CWJC No.14864 of 2019 dt.16-10-2025
5/25
(b) Merely because some
disputed questions of fact arise for
consideration, same cannot be a
ground to refuse to entertain a writ
petition in all cases as a matter of rule.
(c) A writ petition involving a
consequential relief of monetary claim
is also maintainable."
7. In light of the aforesaid judgment
and considering the facts and circumstances of the
present case, this Court is of the considered view
that the writ petition is maintainable.
8. The matter shall now proceed for
hearing on merits.
9. The brief facts as culled out from
the Writ petition are that the petitioner is a
partnership firm engaged in the franchise business
of Tanishq, having its retail outlet in Patna. In the
regular course of its business, which involves
substantial investments in jewellery, the petitioner
had availed financial assistance from Standard
Chartered Bank, M.G. Road, Bangalore through an
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/183987700/ 4
M/S Kripashree vs The State Bank Of India on 16 October, 2025
E-DFS account with an initial limit of Rs.5 crore
Patna High Court CWJC No.14864 of 2019 dt.16-10-2025
6/25
which was later enhanced to Rs.8 crore. The
transactions with the said bank were regular and
dispute-free. In February 2016, officials of the
respondent, State Bank of India (hereinafter called
as SBI), approached the petitioner with a proposal
to shift its banking relationship with SBI, assuring
smooth, regulars and satisfactory services without
any requirement of personal handling of the
accounts. Trusting these representations, the
petitioner agreed, and opened an E-DFS account
(Account No. 35605845148) at the respondent's
SME Branch, Patna, with a sanctioned limit of Rs.10
crore, as per sanction letter dated 10.02.2016.
10. It is contended in the Writ petition
that on 01.03.2016, SBI remitted a sum of Rs. 1.45
crore by debiting the new DFS account to settle the
petitioner's outstanding dues with Standard
Chartered Bank. The said amount was credited to
the petitioner's E-DFS account in Standard
Chartered Bank, which in turn issued a No Dues
Certificate. However, the debit made by SBI on
01.03.2016
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/183987700/ 5
M/S Kripashree vs The State Bank Of India on 16 October, 2025
in the E-DFS account of the petitioner Patna High Court CWJC No.14864 of 2019 dt.16-10-2025 was
irregular and improper exercise as per standard bank practices, as the E-DFS account is meant
solely for disbursal to suppliers. On 04.03.2016, SBI crediting back the said amount in the E-DFS
account of the petitioner as a corrective measure and simultaneously debiting a newly opened Cash
Credit (CC) account (Account No. 35615613591) with the same sum of Rs.1.45 crore. The petitioner,
on learning of this correction, raised no objection and liquidated the CC account by depositing the
entire principal amount by 28.03.2016 and also paid interest amounting to Rs.75,469 by
02.04.2016. Since 05.04.2016, there were no further transactions in the CC account, confirming that
the account was opened solely for rectification.
11. On 27.06.2018, the petitioner was unexpectedly informed by Tech Mahindra through an email
that a debit transaction for Rs.1.45 crore made on 01.03.2016 in the E-DFS account was not picked
up by the SCFU system and accordingly interest could not be charged on the said amount Patna
High Court CWJC No.14864 of 2019 dt.16-10-2025 so debited to the extent of Rs.27,89,724.62.
Subsequently, on 30.06.2018, the respondent bank debited Rs.28,47,305.14 from the petitioner's E-
DFS account to recover the differential interest in most unreasonable, arbitrary and unfair manner
without prior notice or opportunity of hearing to the petitioner.
12. The petitioner objected to this recovery both orally and in writing through letter dated
17.07.2018, and approached the Banking Ombudsman and the respondent bank's higher authorities.
However, despite acknowledging the system error in its response dated 29.01.2019 to the
Ombudsman, the bank refused to refund the recovered amount. Accordingly, the Banking
Ombudsman dropped the proceedings on jurisdictional grounds and communicated the same via
e-mail dated 15.02.2019 to the petitioner. The respondent, in its official reply dated 04.04.2019 vide
Letter No. SME-BU/19-20/04, reiterated that the interest was correctly recovered due to missed
debit entry, relying on internal Patna High Court CWJC No.14864 of 2019 dt.16-10-2025 system
limitations in E-DFS operations.
13. The Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that it is the admitted position of the
respondent bank that the manual debit entry of Rs.1.45 crore made on 01.03.2016 in the E-DFS
account was not picked up by the SCFU system, and this error was solely attributable to the bank's
internal accounting and software mechanisms.
14. It is further submitted that the respondent bank, upon identifying the procedural defect opened
a CC account on 04.03.2016, debited it with Rs.1.45 crore, and credited the same amount to the
E-DFS account to rectify the error. The petitioner fully repaid the Rs.1.45 crore along with applicable
interest of Rs.75,469 by 02.04.2016. Therefore, there was no loss of interest to the bank in real
terms.
15. It is further submitted that the impugned recovery of Rs.28,47,305.14 in 2018, was calculated as
differential interest on the basis of a system-missed entry, which is arbitrary, and Patna High Court
CWJC No.14864 of 2019 dt.16-10-2025 without legal justification, especially when the actual
liability was already discharged by the petitioner within the prescribed time period.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/183987700/ 6
M/S Kripashree vs The State Bank Of India on 16 October, 2025
16. The recovery was made without issuing any formal demand notice, show cause notice, or
providing any opportunity to the petitioner to contest the claim. This is in gross violation of the
principles of natural justice. It is further submitted that the actions of the respondent in unilaterally
debiting the petitioner's account, despite its own error, are arbitrary, unreasonable, and violative of
Article 14 and Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India. Furthermore, the unauthorized debit
amounts to deprivation of property without authority of law, infringing the constitutional legal right
under Article 300A of the Constitution.
17. It is argued that as per the bank's own admission, the petitioner had already paid the sum of
Rs.1.45 crore along with interest by April 2016. The manual debit which was not picked up by the
system was a technical error that could Patna High Court CWJC No.14864 of 2019 dt.16-10-2025
have been rectified through internal adjustments, without imposing any liability on the petitioner.
17. The Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner, having suffered financial
loss due to the arbitrary recovery, is entitled to a refund of Rs.28,47,305.14/- along with interest
from the date of recovery till the date of payment.
18. In support of the case of the petitioner, the Learned counsel has relied on the following
judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in 1. (Karam Kapahi & Ors. Vs.Lal Chand Public
Charitable Trust & Anr. [(2010) 4 SCC 752], 2. (Eureka Forbes Limited Vs. Allahabad Bank & Ors)
[(2010) 6 SCC 193] and 3. Lloyd Electric & Engineering Limited Vs. State of Himachal Pradesh &
Ors[(2016) 1 SCC 560].
19. The observations made by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Karam Kapahi (supra) are quoted
hereinbelow:
"50. The phrase "approbate Patna High Court CWJC No.14864 of 2019 dt.16-10-2025
and reprobate" is borrowed from Scots law where it is used to express the common
law principles of election, namely, that no party can accept and reject the same
instrument.
51. In the instant case while filing its suit and questioning the title of the Trust, the
Club seeks to reject the lease deed. At the same time while seeking the equitable
remedy under Section 114 of the Transfer of Property Act, the Club is relying on the
same instrument of lease. Legally this is not permissible. (See the observation of
Scrutton, L.J. in Verschures Creameries Ltd. v. Hull and Netherlands Steamship Co.
Ltd. [(1921) 2 KB 608 : 1921 All ER Rep 215 (CA)] , which has been approved by a
Constitution Bench of this Court in Bhau Ram v. Baij Nath Singh [AIR 1961 SC 1327]
.)
52. The principle of election has been very felicitously expressed in the treatise
Equity--A Course of Lectures by F.W. Maitland, Cambridge University, 1947. The
learned author has explained the principle thus:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/183987700/ 7
M/S Kripashree vs The State Bank Of India on 16 October, 2025
"The doctrine of election may be thus stated: That he who Patna High Court CWJC
No.14864 of 2019 dt.16-10-2025 accepts a benefit under a deed or will or other
instrument must adopt the whole contents of that instrument, must conform to all its
provisions and renounce all rights that are inconsistent with it.......
53. In the old equity case of Streatfield v. Streatfield [ Wh & TLC, 9th Edn., Vol. I,
1928] this principle has been discussed in words which are so apt and elegant that I
better quote them:
"Election is the obligation imposed upon a party by courts of equity to choose
between two inconsistent or alternative rights or claims in cases where there is a clear
intention of the person from whom he derives one that he should not enjoy both.
Every case of election, therefore, presupposes a plurality of gifts or rights, with an
intention, express or implied, of the party who has a right to control one or both that
one should be a substitute for the other. The party who is to take has a choice, but he
cannot enjoy the benefit of both [ Story, 3rd Edn., p. 452; Dillon v. Parker, (1818) 1
Swans 359 : 36 ER 422; Thellusson v. Patna High Court CWJC No.14864 of 2019
dt.16-10-2025 Woodford, (1806) 13 Ves 209 : 33 ER
273.] . The principle is stated thus in Jarman on Wills [ 6th Edn., p. 532; and Farwell
on Powers, 3rd Edn., p.
429.] :'That he who accepts a benefit under a deed or will must adopt the whole
contents of the instrument, conforming to all its provisions, and renouncing every
right inconsistent with it' [ See Walpole v. Conway (Lord), 1740 Barn C 153 : 27 ER
593; Kirkham v. Smith, (1749) 1 Ves Sen 258 : 27 ER 1018; Macnamara v. Jones, 1
Bro CC 481 : 28 ER 1251; Blake v. Bunbury, (1792) 4 Bro CC 21 : 29 ER 758;
Wintour v. Clifton, 8 De GM & G 641 :
44 ER 537; Codrington v. Codrington, (1876) LR 7 HL 854 at p. 861; Pitman v.
Crum Ewing, 1911 AC 217 at pp. 228, 233 (HL); Brown v. Gregson, 1920 AC 860 at p. 868 : 1920 All
ER Rep 730 (HL).] . The principle of the doctrine of election is now well settled."
54. This principle has also been explained by this Court in Nagubai Ammal v. B. Shama Rao [AIR
1956 SC 593] . Speaking for a three- Judge Bench of this Court, Venkatarama Ayyar, J. stated in the
Report : (AIR p. Patna High Court CWJC No.14864 of 2019 dt.16-10-2025 602, para 23) "23. ... The
doctrine of election is not however confined to instruments. A person cannot say at one time that a
transaction is valid and thereby obtain some advantage, to which he could only be entitled on the
footing that it is valid, and then turn round and say it is void for the purpose of securing some other
advantage. That is to approbate and reprobate the transaction.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/183987700/ 8
M/S Kripashree vs The State Bank Of India on 16 October, 2025
It is clear from the above observations that the maxim that a person cannot 'approbate and
reprobate' is only one application of the doctrine of election...
55. On the doctrine of election the learned Judge in Nagubai Ammal case [AIR 1956 SC 593] has also
referred to Halsbury's Laws of England (Vol. XIII, p. 464, Para 512) in which this principle of
"approbate and reprobate"
has been described as a species of estoppel which seems to be "intermediate between
estoppel by record and estoppel in pais" (p. 602, para 21 of the Report
20. The observations made by the Patna High Court CWJC No.14864 of 2019
dt.16-10-2025 Hon'ble Supreme Court in Eureka Forbes Limited (supra) are quoted
hereinbelow:
65. Another aspect of this case which required to be considered by this Court is, what
was intended to be suppressed by the legislature by enacting the Recovery Act, 1993
and thereafter, by amending various provisions, including Section 2(g) in the year
2000. Obviously, the mischief which was intended to be controlled and/or
prevention of wastage of securities provided to the Bank, was the main consideration
for such enactment. The purpose was also to prevent wrongdoers from taking
advantage of their wrong/mistakes, whether permissible in law or otherwise. These
preventive measures are required to be applied with care and purposefully in
accordance with law to ensure that the mischief, if not entirely extinguished, is
curbed."
66. The maxim nullus commodum capere potest de injuria sua propria has a clear
mandate of law that, a person who by manipulation of a process frustrates the legal
rights of others, should not be permitted to take Patna High Court CWJC No.14864 of
2019 dt.16-10-2025 advantage of his wrong or manipulations. In the present case
Respondents 2 and 3 and the appellant have acted together while disposing off the
hypothecated goods, and now, they cannot be permitted to turn back to argue, that
since the goods have been sold, liability cannot be fastened upon Respondents 2 and
3 and in any case on the appellant. The Bench of this Court in Ashok Kapil v. Sana
Ullah [(1996) 6 SCC 342] referred to rule of mischief and while explaining the word
"building", held as under: (SCC p. 346, para 11) "11. Stroud's Judicial Dictionary (Vol.
I of the 5th Edn.) states that 'what is a building must always be a question of degree
and circumstances'. Quoting from Victoria City Corpn. v. Bishop of Vancouver Island
[(1921) 2 AC 384 (PC)] (AC at p.
390), the celebrated lexicographer commented that 'the ordinary and natural meaning of the word
"building" includes the fabric and the ground on which it stands'. In Black's Law Dictionary (5th
Edn.) the meaning of 'building' is given as 'A structure or Patna High Court CWJC No.14864 of 2019
dt.16-10-2025 edifice enclosing a space within its walls, and usually, but not necessarily, covered
with a roof'. (emphasis in original). The said description is a recognition of the fact that roof is not a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/183987700/ 9
M/S Kripashree vs The State Bank Of India on 16 October, 2025
necessary and indispensable adjunct for a building because there can be roofless buildings. So a
building, even after losing the roof, can continue to be a building in its general meaning. Taking
recourse to such general meaning in the present context would help to prevent a mischief."
21. The observations made by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Lloyd Electric & Engineering Limited
(supra) are quoted hereinbelow:
"14. The State Government cannot speak in two voices. Once the Cabinet takes a
policy decision to extend its 2004 Industrial Policy in the matter of CST concession to
the eligible units beyond 31-3-2009, up to 31-3- 2013, and the Notification dated
29-5- 2009, accordingly, having been issued by the Department concerned viz.
Department of Industries, thereafter, the Excise and Taxation Department Patna
High Court CWJC No.14864 of 2019 dt.16-10-2025 cannot take a different stand.
What is given by the right hand cannot be taken by the left hand. The Government
shall speak only in one voice. It has only one policy. The departments are to
implement the government policy and not their own policy. Once the Council of
Ministers has taken a decision to extend the 2004 Industrial Policy and extend tax
concession beyond 31-3-2009, merely because the Excise and Taxation Department
took some time to issue the notification, it cannot be held that the eligible units are
not entitled to the concession till the Department issued the notification.
15. It has to be noted that the Finance Department of the State Government had
concurred with the proposal of the Department of Industries to extend the tax
concession beyond 31-3-2009 till 31-3-2013 and the Council of Ministers had
accordingly taken a decision also. No doubt, the statutory notification issued by the
Excise and Taxation Department under Section 8(5)(b) of the Act on 18- 6-2009 has
stated that the eligible Patna High Court CWJC No.14864 of 2019 dt.16-10-2025
units will be entitled to the concession with immediate effect. Merely because such an
expression has been used, it cannot be held that the State Government can levy the
tax against its own policy. The State Government is bound by the policy decision
taken by the Council of Ministers and duly notified by the Department concerned viz.
Department of Industries."
22. The Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent-State Bank of India submits that the
present writ application is devoid of merit, and requires no interference by this Hon'ble Court. It is
contended that no legal or fundamental right of the petitioner has been violated, nor has any injury
been caused.
23. It is further submitted that the writ petition suffers from non-joinder of necessary party, as the
Transferor Secured Creditor, i.e., Standard Chartered Bank, is a necessary party to the dispute but
has not been impleaded in the present proceedings.
Patna High Court CWJC No.14864 of 2019 dt.16-10-2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/183987700/ 10
M/S Kripashree vs The State Bank Of India on 16 October, 2025
24. The Learned counsel for respondents submits that during the process of taking over the
petitioner's existing e-DFS facility of Rs.10 crores from Standard Chartered Bank, a bona fide error
occurred on 01.03.2016, when a sum of Rs.1.45 crores was mistakenly disbursed by debiting the
petitioner's e-DFS account instead of a separate cash credit account. This error was subsequently
rectified by the respondent bank on 04.03.2016 by opening a fresh Cash Credit account.
25. It is contended that interest represents public money, and the bank, being a custodian of such
funds, cannot allow any error to persist. The amount of Rs.28,47,305.14 was recovered as interest
legitimately incurred on account of the missed debit entry that remained undetected due to a system
error. The correction made by the bank was in line with basic accounting principles.
26. The Learned counsel for respondents further submitted that the Patna High Court CWJC
No.14864 of 2019 dt.16-10-2025 petitioner's grievance was already raised before the Banking
Ombudsman, who declined to entertain the same due to lack of jurisdiction. The bank, through its
letter dated 04.04.2019 (Annexure 17/A), only sought to clarify the petitioner's confusion and made
an amicable request to resolve the issue, without any element of arbitrariness or illegality.
27. It is further argued that the dispute raised is merely a matter of rendition of accounts, arising out
of misunderstanding on the part of the petitioner. The writ petition, is an attempt to avoid payment
of legitimately accrued interest, and no relief under Article 226 of the Constitution of India is
warranted in such commercial and accounting matters.
28. Heard the Learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the respondents.
29. Upon careful consideration of the records and the rival submissions of the parties, this Court is
of the considered view that the recovery of Rs.28,47,305.14 from the petitioner's Patna High Court
CWJC No.14864 of 2019 dt.16-10-2025 account is arbitrary, unjustified, and legally unsustainable.
It is not disputed that the manual debit of Rs.1.45 crore on 01.03.2016 was not picked up by the
bank's SCFU system due to a technical failure. The said mistake was entirely on the part of the
respondent bank and its service provider. The petitioner had no role in the said omission. The bank,
upon identifying the issue, tried to rectified it on 04.03.2016 by opening a CC account and crediting
back the E-DFS account. The petitioner acted, in good faith and without demur, repaid the principal
amount of Rs.1.45 crore along with interest by 2016. It is evident from the email dated 29.01.2019
that the bank admitted this procedural lapse and its internal cause. However, despite this
admission, the bank sought to recover notional interest for a period during which the actual liability
was fully discharged. The said recovery, effected unilaterally to the petitioner and without issuance
of any demand notice or opportunity of hearing recovery was made which is a clear violation of
principles of natural justice. Patna High Court CWJC No.14864 of 2019 dt.16-10-2025
30. The bank's act amounts to penalizing the petitioner for its own systemic failure, which is
impermissible in law. No individual or entity can be allowed to take advantage of its own wrong.
This principle has been affirmed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Eureka Forbes Ltd. (supra), and
Karam Kapahi (supra). The respondent bank, being a public sector entity, is expected to act in a fair,
transparent, and accountable manner. The unilateral recovery, in this case, falls foul of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/183987700/ 11
M/S Kripashree vs The State Bank Of India on 16 October, 2025
constitutional mandate amounting to deprivation of property without authority of law. Further the
citations referred by the counsel for the petitioner squarely applies to the phrase "approbate and
reported reprobate i.e. the actions of the respondent Bank."
31. In view of the foregoing discussions, this Court finds no error attributable to the petitioner. The
systemic failure of the respondent bank or its software systems cannot become a ground for
imposing any financial burden on the petitioner, particularly after full and Patna High Court CWJC
No.14864 of 2019 dt.16-10-2025 timely discharge of the loan obligation.
