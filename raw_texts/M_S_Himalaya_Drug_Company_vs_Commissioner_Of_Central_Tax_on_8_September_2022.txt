THIS W.P. COMING ON FOR PRELIMINARY HEARING IN 'B'
GROUP THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:-
ORDER
In this petition, the petitioner seeks quashing of the impugned order in appeal of Annexure-A dated
02.03.2021 passed by respondent No.1-Appellate Authority, whereby the impugned order at
Annexure-B dated 28.02.2019 passed by respondent No.2 was confirmed by respondent
No.1-Appellate Authority.
2. Heard learned counsel for the petitioner, learned CGC for the respondents and perused the
material on record.
3. The material on record discloses that the proceedings initiated against the petitioner was
contested and the same culminated in the impugned order in original dated 28.02.2019 passed by
respondent No.2, which was received by the petitioner on 13.03.2019. Aggrieved by the same,
petitioner preferred an appeal on 14.11.2019 before respondent No.1-Appellate Authority along with
an application for condonation of delay in preferring the appeal. By the impugned order dated
02.03.2021, respondent No.1-Appellate Authority declined to condone the delay in preferring the
appeal and accordingly, dismissed the appeal as barred by limitation. Aggrieved by the impugned
orders, petitioner is before this Court by way of the present petition.
4. It is contended that the inability and omission on the part of the petitioner to prefer the appeal
before the Appellate Authority within the prescribed period was due to bonafide reasons,
unavoidable circumstances and sufficient cause as detailed in the application for condonation of
delay as well as in the present petition. It is contended that though the Appellate Authority does not
have power to condone the delay in preferring the appeal, it is always open for this Court to exercise
its extra ordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India and this Court is
empowered to condone the delay in order to do complete and substantial justice, particularly when
the petitioner has good case to urge on merits and is ready to abide by the terms and conditions to
be imposed by this Court. In support of its contentions, reliance is placed upon the judgment of the
Hon'ble Division Bench in W.A.No.942/2021 [SIMPLEX INFRASTRUCTURES LTD., AND
ANOTHER V/S. THE JOINT COMMISSIONER OF CENTRAL TAX AND OTHERS, D.D. ON
03.12.2021].

5. Per contra, it is the contention of the respondents that there is lack of due diligence and
negligence on the part of the petitioner in preferring the appeal within the prescribed period and no
indulgence can be shown in favour of the petitioner, who has slept over his rights for more than six
months and as such, the petition is liable to be dismissed. Reliance is placed on the judgment of the
Division Bench of this Court in the case of M/S. LAXMI ELECTRONIC MOULDS & PRECISION
ENGINGEERING PRIVATE LTD., V/S. UNION OF INDIA AND OTHERS [W.P.No.53511/2018,
D.D., ON 23.09.2021].
6. A perusal of the material on record, in particular, the application for condonation of delay filed by
the petitioner before the respondent No.1-Appellate Authority as well as the grounds urged in the
Memorandum of Appeal as well as in the present petition will indicate that it is the specific
contention of the petitioner that the impugned order in original dated 28.02.2019 passed by
respondent No.2 was received by the petitioner only on 13.03.2019 when it was delivered to the
inward Section of the petitioner and was not forwarded or handed over to the Senior Manager
(Taxation), who was in charge of the case as well as indirect taxes of the petitioner-Company and
hence, petitioner was not aware of the said order. It is contended that the GST regime having
commenced on 01.07.2017, the extended last date to take input tax credit was 31.03.2019 and
accordingly, the petitioner and its aforesaid officer were over burdened with compliances during
March-2019 to October-2019, since they had GST registration in 24 states and she was traveling to
many states to complete the GST audit. It is further contended that on account of the absence of the
aforesaid officer of the petitioner-Company due to her travel, the impugned order in original was
received by the inward Section and not forwarded/delivered to her and the GST audit being a very
cumbersome process, it took substantial time and the said Officer was not served with the copy of
the order so as to enable her to prefer the appeal within the stipulated period. It is also contended
that the petitioner and the aforesaid officer came to know about order in original only during
October-November, 2019 when the respondents- Revenue sought a clarification from the petitioner
about the status of the order. Immediately thereafter, petitioner took necessary steps to prefer the
appeal before respondent No.1-Appellate Authority along with an application seeking condonation
of delay.
7. The aforesaid facts and circumstances clearly establish that the petitioner had made out valid and
sufficient ground/cause to condone the delay in preferring the appeal before the appellate Authority.
It is also clear that the inability and omission on the part of the petitioner to prefer the appeal within
the prescribed period was due to bonafide reasons, unavoidable circumstances and sufficient cause.
Though it is well settled that Respondent No.1-Appellate Authority does not have power to condone
the delay beyond the extended/condonable period of 30 days after expiry of the initial period of 60
days, by adopting justice oriented approach and in order to do complete and substantial justice, in
the peculiar/special facts and circumstances obtaining in the instant case and in the light of the
material on record which clearly establishes that the delay in preferring the appeal was wholly
unintentional and due to valid and sufficient grounds referred to supra coupled with the fact that the
petitioner has a good case to urge on merits and the balance of convenience in its favour and in view
of the judgment of the Division Bench in Simplex Infrastructure's case supra, I deem it just and
appropriate to exercise my powers under Article 226 of the Constitution of India and condone the
delay in preferring the appeal by the petitioner by setting aside the impugned order at Annexure-A

M/S Himalaya Drug Company vs Commissioner Of Central Tax ... on 8 September, 2022
and remit the matter back to respondent No.1 for reconsideration of the appeal afresh on merits in
accordance with law.
8. In so far as the contention of the respondents that the delay ought not to be condoned in view of
the judgment of the Division Bench in Lakshmi Electronics case supra is concerned, a perusal of the
said judgment will indicate that this Court has declined to exercise its discretion to condone the
delay in the facts and circumstances of the said judgment, which are clearly distinguishable from the
facts of the instant case and consequently, no reliance can be placed upon the said judgment by the
respondent since the same is inapplicable to the case on hand and the said contention cannot be
accepted.
9. In the result, the following:
ORDER
i) Writ petition is allowed subject to the petitioner depositing a sum of Rs.10,000/-
(Rupees Ten Thousand only) to the Advocates Welfare Fund, Bengaluru, within a period of eight
weeks from today.
ii) The impugned order at Annexure-A dated 02.03.2021 passed by the respondent No.1 is hereby
quashed and the application for condonation of delay in preferring the appeal by the petitioner
before respondent No.1 is hereby allowed and the delay in preferring the appeal stands condoned.
iii) The matter is remitted back to respondent No.1 for re-consideration afresh in accordance with
law, without reference to the issue/question regarding condonation of delay and/or limitation in
preferring the appeal which stands concluded in favour of the petitioner by virtue of this order.
iv) The respondent No.1 is directed to consider the appeal preferred by the petitioner-
appellant without reference to the issue/question of limitation and dispose of the appeal on merits
in accordance with law.
v) It is made clear that this order is passed in the peculiar/special facts and circumstances obtaining
in the instant case and shall not be treated as a precedent or having any precedential value for any
purpose, whatsoever.
