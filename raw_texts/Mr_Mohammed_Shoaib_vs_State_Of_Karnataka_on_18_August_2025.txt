21.3. A survey having been conducted on
12.06.2015, the Tahsildar, Bhuvanahalli, has
categorically indicated that there is no
encroachment of any forest land. The orders
passed in the criminal petitions, not having
been challenged, liberty having been exercised,
a report having been submitted by the
Tahsildar that there is no encroachment, the
question of the Forest Department once again
contending that there is an encroachment is
completely impermissible and is not
sustainable.

21.4. A joint survey was conducted in the year 2015,
and a unilateral survey was carried out in the
year 2017, on the basis of which the present
notices have been issued in the year 2021,
which is not permissible. The survey report of
the year 2015 has not been challenged. The
survey carried out in the year 2017 is not a
joint survey of which the Petitioners are part of,
and as such, the present notices could not have

21.5. His submission is that it is not just a show-
cause notice, which is challenged in these
proceedings. It is the jurisdiction of the forest
department to issue a show cause notice after
the same was earlier quashed in the year 2012,
disentitling the Respondents to issue a fresh
show cause notice and or initiate fresh FOC
proceedings, which is under challenge.

Mysore Forest Regulation, 1900 [hereinafter

provides for any limitation period in order to
recover any land which has been used for non-
forest purposes. However, any such recovery
would have to be made within a reasonable
period of time. Merely not providing for a period
of limitation would not empower the Forest
Department to take action at any time they
choose to at their whims and fancies. The
property, having been put to use by private
persons in the year 1936 in respect of survey

10. Apart from the reasoning given by the High
Court, it appears to us that the judgment of this
Court in Ibrahimpatnam (supra) is decisive on the
contention of limitation urged before us. Under
somewhat similar circumstances suo-motu power was
given to the Collector under section 50B (iv) of the
Andhra Pradesh (Telangana Area) Tenancy and

or propriety of such certificate or as to the regularity

"Even before the Division Bench of the High
Court in the writ appeals, the appellants did not
contend that the suo motu power could be
exercised even after a long delay of 13-15 years
because of the fraudulent acts of the non-official
respondents. The focus of attention before the
Division Bench was only on the language of sub-
section (4) of Section 50-B of the Act as to
whether the suo motu power could be exercised
at any time strictly sticking to the language of
that sub-section or it could be exercised within
reasonable time. In the absence of necessary
and sufficient particulars pleaded as regards
fraud and the date or period of discovery of
fraud and more so when the contention that the
suo motu power could be exercised within a
reasonable period from the date of discovery of
fraud was not urged, the learned Single Judge
as well as the Division Bench of the High Court
were right in not examining the question of
fraud alleged to have been committed by the
non-official respondents. Use of the words "at
any time" in Sub-section (4) of Section 50-B of
the Act only indicates that no specific period of
limitation is prescribed within which the suo
motu power could be exercised reckoning or
starting from a particular date advisedly and
contextually. Exercise of suo motu power
depended on facts and circumstances of each
case. In cases of fraud, this power could be
exercised within a reasonable time from the
date of detection or discovery of fraud. While
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 21
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
exercising such power, several factors need to
be kept in mind such as effect on the rights of
the third parties over the immovable property
due to passage of considerable time, change of
hands by subsequent bona fide transfers, the
orders attaining finality under the provisions of
other Acts (such as the Land Ceiling Act).
Hence, it appears that without stating from what
date the period of limitation starts and within
what period the suo motu power is to be
exercised, in Sub-section (4) of Section 50-B of
the Act, the words "at any time" are used to
that the suo motu power could be exercised

within reasonable period from the date of
discovery of fraud depending on facts and
circumstances of each case in the context of the
statute and nature of rights of the parties. Use
of the words "at any time" in Sub-section (4) of
Section 50-B of the Act cannot be rigidly read
letter by letter. It must be read and construed
contextually and reasonably. If one has to
simply proceed on the basis of the dictionary
meaning of the words "at any time", the suo
motu power under Sub-section (4) of Section
50-B of the Act could be exercised even after
decades and then it would lead to anomalous
position leading to uncertainly and complications
seriously affecting the rights of the parties, that
too, over immovable properties. Orders
attaining finality and certainty of the rights of
the parties accrued in the light of the orders
passed must have sanctity. Exercise of suo
motu power "at any time" only means that no
specific period such as days, months or years
are not prescribed reckoning from a particular
date. But that does not mean that "at any time"
should be unguided and arbitrary. In this view,
"at any time" must be understood as within a
reasonable time depending on the facts and
circumstances of each case in the absence of
prescribed period of limitation."
11. We are, therefore, of the view that the use of the
words "at any time" in section 71A is evidence of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 22
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
legislative intent to give sufficient flexibility to the
Deputy Commissioner to implement the socio-
economic policy of the Act viz. to prevent inroads
upon the rights of the ignorant, illiterate and
backward citizens. Thus, where the Deputy
Commissioner chooses to exercise his power under
Section 71A it would be futile to contend that the
period of limitation under Limitation Act has expired.
The period of limitation under the Limitation Act is
intended to bar suits brought in civil courts where the
party himself chooses to exercise his right of seeking
restoration of immovable property. But, where, for
socio-economic reasons, the party may not even be
aware of his own rights, the legislature has stepped

in by making an officer of the State responsible for
doing social justice by clothing him with sufficient
power. However, even such power cannot be
exercised after an unreasonably long time during
which third party interests might have come into
effect. Thus, the test is not whether the period of
limitation prescribed in the Act of 1963 had expired,
but whether the power under Section 71A was sought
to be exercised after unreasonable delay.
21.8. By referring to Sita Sahu's case, he submits
that the period of limitation under Limitation
Act is intended to bar suits brought in Civil
Courts, even where socio-economic reasons
exist, where an officer of the State has been
made responsible for doing social justice, even
then such power cannot be exercised after an
unreasonably long time during which third party
interest might have come into being. Thus,
even if no limitation period is prescribed under

unreasonable delay. He submits that the
exercise of powers under Section 71A is to
restore possession to members of the
scheduled tribes whose lands were unlawfully
transferred by the Deputy Commissioner. That
ruling, he submits, would be equally applicable
as regards a claim that the land in question is a
forest land.
21.9. He relies upon the decision in Chhedi Lal
Yadav and Ors. vs Hari Kishore Yadav and
Ors.2 of the Hon'ble Apex Court, more
particularly para no.9 thereof which is

petition barred by time but filed on 2-11-1995, after
limitation itself was removed from the statute was
maintainable. This Court held that there could be no
resort to Article 137 of the Limitation Act, 1963 even
though no period of limitation was prescribed.
Accordingly, the Court held that the claim petition could
not be rejected at the threshold on the ground of
limitation, after the deletion of sub-section (3) of
Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 which had
provided a period of six months. This view was taken
having regard to the purpose of the statute. We,
however, find that the judgment relied on has no
application to the present case. It is a settled law where
the statute does not provide for a period of limitation,
the provisions of the statute must be invoked within a
reasonable time.

1 acre and 2 guntas, which was sold out of a total of 2
acres and 2 guntas, and further directed the Assistant
Commissioner, Davanagere to restore the disputed

2. The land was originally granted to one Kariyappa
on the basis of a grant which had not been produced
on record. The grant was on 30-6-1965. Kriyappa sold
the land to one Mekha Narasimha Murthy on 15-12-
1977. The appellant, Smt Nekkanti Rama Lakshmi
purchased the land on 27-6-1984 from Mekha
Narasimha Murthy.

contrary is proved, that such person has acquired the

provided for resumption and restitution of granted

Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
an application dated 24-3-2004 i.e. approximately
after 25 years of when the Act came into force.
6. As stated earlier, the Assistant Commissioner,
Davanagere rejected that application. The appellate
authority allowed the application and the High Court
upheld the order of the appellate authority. This
appeal is preferred by the second purchaser of the
said land.
7. Shri R.S. Hedge appearing for the appellant urged
several grounds. It is contended by Shri Hegde that
proceedings are void for non-joinder of the first
purchaser of the land. It is further contended that the
non-alienation period i.e. period for which Kriyappa
could not have transferred the land was not 15 years
but was 10 years under the Rules of the land and,
therefore, transfer was legal having been made after
10 years. However, the applicant had not produced
the original grant, and, therefore, it was not possible
for the purpose to come to a conclusion that the
transfer was in breach of the non-alienation period.
We, however, find that one of the points raised on
behalf of the appellant deserves acceptance. That
point is that the application for restoration of the land
was made by the heir of Kriyappa after unreasonably
long period i.e. 25 years from when the Act came into
force. Section 4 of the Act itself has a ubiquitous
effect in it, annulling the transfer of granted land
"made either before or after the commencement of
the Act" as null and void. The Act does not specify
how much before the commencement of the Act. Thus
on a plain and critical reading of the Act, it seems that
it covers proceedings made in time before the Act was
enacted. However, we are not called upon to deal with
the reasonableness of this provision and we do not
propose to say anything on this. The validity of the
Act has been upheld by a judgment of this Court in
Manchegowda v. State of Karnataka [Manchegowda v.
State of Karnataka, (1984) 3 SCC 301].

8. However, the question that arises is with regard to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 28
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
terms of Section 5 of the Act which enables any
interested person to make an application for having
the transfer annulled as void under Section 4 of the
Act. This section does not prescribe any period within
which such an application can be made. Neither does
it prescribe the period within which suo motu action
may be taken. This Court in Chhedi Lal Yadav v. Hari
Kishore Yadav [Chhedi Lal Yadav v. Hari Kishore
Yadav, (2018) 12 SCC 527 : (2018) 5 SCC (Civ) 427]
and also in Ningappa v. Commr. [Ningappa v.
Commr., (2020) 14 SCC 236] reiterated a settled
position in law that whether statute provided for a
period of limitation, provisions of the statute must be
invoked within a reasonable time. It is held that action
whether on an application of the parties, or suo motu,
must be taken within a reasonable time. That action
arose under the provisions of a similar Act which
provided for restoration of certain lands to farmers
which were sold for arrears of rent or from which they
were ejected for arrears of land from 1-1-1939 to 31-
12-1950. This relief was granted to the farmers due to
flood in Kosi River which make agricultural operations
impossible. An application for restoration was made
after 24 years and was allowed. It is in that
background that this Court upheld that it was
unreasonable to do so. We have no hesitation in
upholding that the present application for restoration
of land made by respondent Rajappa was made after
an unreasonably long period and was liable to be
dismissed on that ground. Accordingly, the judgments
of the Karnataka High Court, namely, R. Rudrappa v.
Commr. [R. Rudrappa v. Commr., 1998 SCC OnLine
Kar 671 : (2000) 1 Kant LJ 523] , Maddurappa v.

been referred to in Nekkanti Ramalakshmi's

to be exercised by an authority are to be

the present case, 85 and 75 years are not a

encroachment of forest land when such survey
numbers are not designated as forest land,
would not arise. These are matters which this
Court can take into account even in a writ

any other remedy.

intercede in this matter.
21.15. As regards the probable contention of the forest
department, which was taken in the suit filed as
also the appeals which were filed thereafter, he
submits that once a grant of the land has been
made, the said land does not continue to be
forest land. Even if the notification relied upon

far back as the year 1932, granted to a defence

in the property being auctioned in the year

it into the exceptions to Section 20 of the

explanation to Section 20 and elaborates that
Section 20 provides an exception to Section 17
of MFR 1900. Section 17 is reproduced
hereunder for easy reference:
17. When the following events have occurred,
viz.-
(a) the period fixed under section 5 for preferring
claims has elapsed, and all claims, (if any) made
within such period have been disposed of by the
Forest Settlement Officer; and
(b) if such claims lave been made, the period fixed
by section 15 for appealing from the orders passed

presented within such period have been disposed of
by the appellate authority; and
(c) all proceedings prescribed by sections 10 and 18

the Government may publish a notification in the

From the date so fixed such forest shall be deemed

each sub-divided portion will be responsible for the
quit-rent due on his portion only, but where no
such apportionment of quit-rent has taken place,
and the proprietary right in an Inam village is held
jointly by several persons, the joint liability of the
shareholder should be insisted upon for arrears of
quit-rent due to Government. If, however,
shareholders, notwithstanding that the lands are
not divided, wish to have their shares separately
registered, so that each sharer may pay his quota
of the Government dues, and produce before the
Deputy Commissioner an agreement signed by all
of them, containing a full statement of the shares
held by each and the amount of quit-rent payable
by him, their several shares may accordingly be
registered; and in such case, or where the shares
have already been separately registered as Vrittis,
the quit-rent due by each sharer may be collected
from him. If any shareholder falls into arrear, his
share shall first be sold and if it does not realize the
arrear due, the joint responsibility may then be
enforced and the other shares also sold, after due
notice. The purchaser of the share sold will acquire
all the rights of the defaulter, but free of all
encumbrances created by him.

favour of defence personnel or in favour of

exception in terms of Section 20, of the MFR

continue to be forest land, either as reserved

(1) No land containing valuable trees or other forest
growth shall be granted by the Deputy
Commissioner, unless the concerned 1[Deputy

latter they are valuable sandal-bearing areas. The
Deputy Commissioner, before granting, such land,
shall get a complete and correct list of all sandal
trees and saplings in the land and record the list in
the register maintained for the purpose and obtain an
agreement from the grantee for preserving all such
trees.
21.31. His submission is that Sub-rule (2) of Rule 41

been introduced in the year 1969, he submits
that there was no such prohibition which was in
existence in the year 1932 when the grant was
made in favour of Defence Personnel, and in
the year 1945 when a grant was made in
favour of Sri.Muniyappa. Thus, going on to
contend now that there was a grant made by
the Deputy Commissioner in violation of sub-
Rule (2) of Rule 41, is a complete
misconception on part of the Forest
Department. He submits that Section 2 of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 46
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
FCA of 1980 would also not be applicable
inasmuch as the said Section relates to
restrictions on de-reservation of forest or use of
forest land for non-forest purposes. This Act
also came into force in the year 1980, and
cannot be made retrospectively applicable to
actions which have been taken in the year 1932
and 1945. His submission is that Section 2 of

the FCA of 1980 would be applicable only to
forest lands which are still forest lands as on
the day the FCA of 1980 came into force.
21.32. The revenue records never having indicated
that the lands were forest land, there being no
document indicating that the Forest department
has any title over the property or control over
the land, the revenue documents too indicate
that the title of the land in survey No. 68 and
69 was vested with the predecessors of the
Petitioners and subsequently with the
Petitioners. The revenue documents being
contrary to any of the claims made by the

Court in B.S. Sandhu vs Government of
India and Ors.4, more particularly para nos.
16 and 17 thereof, which are reproduced
hereunder for easy reference:
16. The High Court has also taken a view in the

District Ropar, was closed in the PLP Act, 1900, it
was "forest land" for the purpose of Section 2 of the
Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. Para 53 of the

entire land of Village Karoran which has been

whether the conclusion of the High Court that the land
which is notified under Section 3 of the PLP Act, 1900
and is regulated by the prohibitory directions notified

21.34. By relying on B.S.Sandhu's case, his
submission is that the word 'forest' must be
understood according to its dictionary meaning
and must cover all statutorily recognised
forests. Even if a forest, as held in T.N. Goda
Varman's case, were to be understood to
apply to areas recorded as forest in the
government record, irrespective of ownership,
the same would not be applicable to the
present case, since there is no ownership
recorded of survey Nos. 68 and 69 in the name
of the government. What is required to be
considered is whether the said land was forest
land or not, when FCA 1980 came into force,
that is, as on 25.10.1980, on the basis of
documents available on record.
21.35. This is not a matter which will require a trial of
a disputed question of fact, inasmuch as it is for

document on record that the land in Survey
Nos. 68 and 69 were forest land, as on
25.10.1980. There being no such documents
that had been placed on record, the Forest
Department having filed a suit for declaration of
title by declaring it to be forest land, there is a
dispute which existed as on 25.10.1980 as
regards the very nature of the land. The same,
not being forest land, the decision in
T.N.Godavarman's case would not be
applicable to the present case.
21.36. He submits that the proceedings and the Show-
cause notice in the present case have been
issued in the very same quashed proceedings in
FOC No. 7 to 9, 13 and 14 of 2006-07. Once
those proceedings have been quashed, they
cannot be revived in a manner other than that

the government notification bearing No. R7803-
6, dated 08.01.1921, whereunder the State
forest came to be constituted, on the ground
that the Petitioners had encroached on the
land.
22.2. He relies upon the decision in Union of India
and Anr vs Kunisetty Satyanarayana5, more
particularly para nos.13 and 14 thereof, which
are reproduced hereunder for easy reference:
13. It is well settled by a series of decisions of this
Court that ordinarily no writ lies against a charge-
sheet or show-cause notice vide Executive Engineer,
Bihar State Housing Board v. Ramesh Kumar
Singh [(1996) 1 SCC 327 : JT (1995) 8 SC 331]
, Special Director v. Mohd. Ghulam Ghouse [(2004)
3 SCC 440 : 2004 SCC (Cri) 826 : AIR 2004 SC
1467] , Ulagappa v. Divisional Commr.,

U.P. v. Brahm Datt Sharma [(1987) 2 SCC 179 :
(1987) 3 ATC 319 : AIR 1987 SC 943] , etc.
14. The reason why ordinarily a writ petition should
not be entertained against a mere show-cause
notice or charge-sheet is that at that stage the writ
petition may be held to be premature. A mere
charge-sheet or show-cause notice does not give
rise to any cause of action, because it does not
amount to an adverse order which affects the rights
of any party unless the same has been issued by a
person having no jurisdiction to do so. It is quite

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 54
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
possible that after considering the reply to the
show-cause notice or after holding an enquiry the
authority concerned may drop the proceedings
and/or hold that the charges are not established. It
is well settled that a writ petition lies when some
right of any party is infringed. A mere show-cause
notice or charge-sheet does not infringe the right of
anyone. It is only when a final order imposing some
punishment or otherwise adversely affecting a party
is passed, that the said party can be said to have
any grievance.
22.3. By relying on Kunishetti-Satnayana's case,
he submits that a show-cause notice cannot be
challenged in writ proceedings.
22.4. He again reiterates that the High Court should
be extremely circumspect while dealing with a
writ petition against a show-cause notice. Thus,
he submits that any and all contentions which
have been taken up by the petitioners in the
present matter could be taken up before the
second respondent in answer to the show-cause
notice. The same is not required to be
considered by this Court in detail as sought to
be contended by the Petitioners. He submits

decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in State of
Karnataka vs I.S. Nirvane Gowda6, more
particularly para no. 4 thereof, which is
reproduced hereunder for easy reference:
Learned counsel for the appellants contended that
the High Court committed a serious error in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 57
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
interfering with the concurrent findings recorded by
both the courts below when those finding s were
based on proper consideration and appreciation of
evidence brought on record. The learned counsel
contended that Exh. D.1- being the true copy of the
gazette Notification dated 26t h June, 1937, was
rightly accepted by the Trial Court as well as the
First Appellate Court an d the High Court was not
justified in not accepting the same particularly when
it had become a part of the record and no objection
had been taken by the respondents at the time of
recording the evidence. He also submitted that
Exh.D.2, being the statement of lands taken for
Indavara State Forest in Hukkund Village, should
have been accepted . He further submitted that
Hanumanthappa- the Range Forest Officer
supported the case of the appellants on the basis of
the record. Merely because the Higher officer in the
department was not examined, his testimony could
not be rejected. The trial court as well as the first
appellate court, based on the evidence, recorded
findings that the lands in question were the part of
reserved forest. We do not find any good ground or
a valid reason for rejection of Exh.-D.1 by the High
Court. When the lands were included in reserve
forest, the entries in the revenue records were of no
consequence and further mere Saguvali Chits did
not confer any title on the suit lands. This apart the
revenue authorities were not competent to deal with
the property which were the part of the reserved
forest. Th e First Appellate Court was right in
affirming the judgment and decree of the Trial

court. We find it difficult to sustain the impugned
judgment and decree as far as these respondents-
I. S. Nirvane Gowda and B. Govindaraj in these two
appeals are concerned. In this view these appeals
are entitled to succeed.
22.7. By relying on Nirvane Gowda's case, he
submits that where the lands were included in a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 58
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
reserved forest, the revenue records were of no
consequence, issuance of saguvali chits and or
the like did not confer any title on the said land.
The revenue authorities were neither
competent nor did they have the authority to
deal with forest land.
22.8. He relies upon Section 30 of the MFR 1900,
which is reproduced hereunder for easy
reference:
30. (1) The Government may, by notification in the
official Gazette, direct that, from a date to be fixed
by such notification, any forest constituted a State
Forest under this Regulation or any portion thereof,
shall cease to be a State Forest or portion of a State
Forest.
(2) From the date so fixed, such forest or portion
shall cease to be a State Forest or portion of a State
Forest; but the rights, if any, which have been
extinguished therein shall not revive in
consequence of such cessation.

government may, by notification, in the official

forest under that regulation and or issue a
notification that it shall cease to be a State
forest or a portion of a State-forest. Thus, he
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 59
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
submits that unless and until the government
issues such a notification under Section 30, any
particular survey No. and or the extent thereof
ceases to be a State forest or a portion of a
State forest, such survey no. and the land
comprised therein shall continue to be a state
forest, as regards which the Petitioners cannot
claim any equity.

accordance with said notification, and it is this
survey report which is the root cause for the
issue of the impugned show-cause notices.

very same proceedings, namely FOC 7. Hence,
the Petitioners cannot have any grievance
therewith. The quashing of FOC No.7, 8, 9, 13

the joint survey not having been conducted and
liberty having been reserved to conduct such a

encroachment having been found, the
authorities are well within their rights to issue a
show cause notice, which is required to be

present writ petition is not maintainable.
22.17. The Authorities are only implementing the

old survey numbers would also continue to

there being no fresh notification in section 17 or

Brijesh Reddy and Anr7, more particularly
para no. 18 thereof, which is reproduced

18. It is clear that the Land Acquisition Act is a
complete code in itself and is meant to serve public
purpose. By necessary implication, the power of the
civil court to take cognizance of the case under
Section 9 CPC stands excluded and a civil court has
no jurisdiction to go into the question of the validity
or legality of the notification under Section 4,
declaration under Section 6 and subsequent
proceedings except by the High Court in a proceeding
under Article 226 of the Constitution. It is thus clear
that the civil court is devoid of jurisdiction to give
declaration or even bare injunction being granted on

22. In view of above, once the notification has been
issued under Section 4 of the Act of 1927, all claims
can be raised before the Forest Settlement Officer,
who can consider the same and decide the claim
after affording opportunity of evidence exercising
the powers of a civil court in the trial of the suit.
After finalisation of the proceedings, the notification
under Section 20 is issued declaring the land as
reserved forest. Section 20 of the Act of 1927 is
extracted hereinbelow:
"20. Notification declaring forest reserved.--
(1) When the following events have occurred,
namely:
(a) the period fixed under Section 6 for preferring
claims have elapsed and all claims (if any) made
under that section or Section 9 have been disposed

(b) if any such claims have been made, the period

(if any) presented within such period have been

(c) all lands (if any) to be included in the proposed
forest, which the Forest Settlement Officer has,
under Section 11, elected to acquire under
the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (1 of 1894), have
become vested in the Government under Section
16 of that Act, the State Government shall publish
a notification in the Official Gazette, specifying
definitely, according to boundary marks erected or
otherwise, the limits of the forest which is to be
reserved, and declaring the same to be reserved
from a date fixed by the notification.
(2) From the date so fixed such forest shall be
deemed to be a reserved forest.
State Amendments
Uttar Pradesh- In Section 20, in sub-section (1),
for clause (b), substitute the following clause,
namely--

disposed by the District Judge; and

25. In view of above, it is evident that as per
scheme of the Act, in the proceeding beginning with
notification under Section 4, all claims regarding land
included in the notification are adjudicated by an
authorised officer i.e. Forest Settlement Officer, who
exercises all the powers of the civil court in trial of
the suits as per Section 8, the appeal of which can
be preferred under Section 17. Section 5 of the Act
of 1927 provides that after issue of a notification
under Section 4, no right shall be acquired in or over
the land comprised in such notification, except by
succession or under a grant or contract in writing

made or entered into by or on behalf of the
Government or some person in whom such right was
vested when the notification was issued. The said
notifications published in the Official Gazettes are
public documents which need not be proved and
they shall be deemed to have been issued in
accordance with law after following the due
procedure of law.
30. In State of U.P. v. Kamal Jeet Singh2, the
Division Bench of this Court considered the scheme
of the Forest Act and has held that the Forest
Settlement Officer has the powers of a civil court and
once the notification under Sections 4 and 20 of the
Forest Act has been issued, it attains finality and
except revision before the State no authority has
jurisdiction to determine the rights as contained in
Section 27-A of the Forest Act. Thus, the Revenue
Authorities could not have determined the rights
under Section 229-B of the U.P. Z.A. & L.R. Act,
1950.
37. It is also noticed that the trial court examined
the legality and validity of the notification issued
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 71
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
under Sections 4 and 20 of the Act of 1927 without
being challenged, whereas the same could not have
been done because the same could even not have
been challenged in suit for permanent injunction. The
notification issued under the statutory provision could
not be held illlegal without being challenged. Even
otherwise, the trial court has held that it is not
completely legal, meaning thereby it's legality has
not been disputed but it has been held only on the
ground that the appellant has failed to prove as to
when notice of the notification was given to the
respondents and when it's munadi was done,
whereas once notification under Sections 4 and 20 of
the Act of 1927 were issued and published in Official
Gazette, it will be deemed that they have been issued
in accordance with law after following due procedure
of law and it could not have been held illegal or
inoperative without challenge to the notifications in
appropriate proceedings but not in a suit for
permanent injunction.

it is for them to have challenged the said

submission is also that by the mere usage of
the word 'grant', it would not de-reserve the
reserve forest without a de-notification. Mere
grant, even if accepted for the purpose of

of the land as a reserve forest, and in this

material placed on record with leave, we are inclined to
grant indulgence in the matter for the following reasons:
(a) Rivers and forests have defined civilizations
throughout the history of mankind. They were revered
and worshiped in ancient India as organic entities.
Kautilya's Arthashaastra mentions about the importance
of forest and forest departments. A lot of forest
jurisprudence has developed by the Apex Court through
a series of directions issued from time to time vide T.N.
Godavarman Thirumulpad Vs. Union of India. Judicial
Institution is a stake holder along with other. The Apex
Court in Common Cause vs. Union of India1 has
observed that natural recourses such as air, water,
forest, lakes, rivers & wildlife are public properties; they
are entrusted to the Government for safe & proper use.
The doctrine of public trust enjoins upon the
Government to protect these resources. Hugo Grotius
(1583-1645) centuries ago declared "That belongs to all
belongs to none and that belongs to none belongs to
all". India is a signatory to several International
Conventions concerning Forests, Ecology and
Environment. These covenants/conventions which have
been ratified by India are binding to the extent that they
are not inconsistent with the provisions of the domestic
law2 . In cases relating to rivers and forests, the
constitutional courts are not mere arbiters but the stake
holders too. Cases of that nature cannot be treated as a
lis inter parte. All this should prelude our discussion in
the matter.
(b) Plaintiffs title came to be clouded in view of orders
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 74
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
made by the Tahasildar u/s 128, the orders made in
appeal by the Asst. Commissioner u/s 136(2) and
affirmation of these orders by the Deputy Commissioner
u/s 136(3) of the 1964 Act. At that level, entries in the
revenue records concerning the suit lands were mutated
in favour of the State Forest Department on the ground
that throughout the said entry stood that way since
1950 and that all of a sudden, Sri.Mayaga's name could
not have been entered in the place of Forest
Department, without any basis. Some of the plaintiffs
had filed W.P.No.29959/2009 laying a challenge to these
orders and a learned Single Judge of this court vide
judgement dated 9.6.2010 disposed off the petition

relegating the plaintiffs to Civil Court inter alia on the
ground that disputed facts were involved. The plaintiffs
have structured their suit on the basis of revenue
entries and that they have not produced any other
material to vouch the title of Sri.Mayaga to these lands.
All other evidentiary material placed by them on record
has nothing to do with the title to the lands in question.
It has been a settled position of law that a suit for
declaration cannot be founded on entries in the revenue
records vide Apex Court decision in PRAHLAD PRADHAN
vs. SONU KUMHAR.
(c) The Appellant-State Government has produced in
this appeal the Mysore Government Notification dated
6.6.1929 issued u/s 17 of the 1900 Act whereby
Chamundibetta State Reserve Forest has been
constituted. Maharajas of Mysore Kingdom were known
for their love for Mother Nature in general and forests in
particular. They used to worship forests as Vanadevata
(Goddess of Forest). The Forest Map has also been
produced by the learned HCGP with leave of the court.
These are not only not disputed by the plaintiffs side but
their learned counsel seeks to rely upon them also to
show that the suit lands have not been comprised in the
said forest. True it is that the survey numbers in which
the suit lands are situate are not in so many words
found in the subject Notification or the Forest Map.
However, when a State Reserve Forest is sought to be
constituted by Notifications of the kind, the land
comprised therein is demarked by the boundary lines. If
suit lands obviously fall within the said boundary lines,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 75
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
non-mentioning of the survey numbers pale into
insignificance. After all, it has been a settled position
since the days of Privy Council that as between numbers
denoting the area and the boundaries, the latter shall
prevail over the former, should there be discordance.
(d) A Coordinate Bench of this Court had an occasion to
consider how State Reserve Forest were formed under
the provisions of the very same statute namely 1900 Act
in W.P.No.23928/2018 (GM-FOR) between
B.R.GANAPATHI SINGH vs. STATE AND OTHERS. What
is observed in paragraphs 25 & 26 would fully support
the case of appellants and therefore, the said
paragraphs are reproduced:

"In the instant case, by virtue of Notification dated
04.08.1994 and as per the boundaries indicated therein,
certain lands were declared to be constituted as
reserved forest i.e., by specifying the constitution and
limits of such land, by intelligible boundaries... A reading
of the provisions from Sections 4 to 17 of the Act would
indicate that when once it has been decided to
constitute land within certain boundaries as reserved
forest and a declaration is made to that effect then, a
proclamation has to be made by the Forest Settlement
Officer. There is a bar to accrual of forest rights over the
land comprised in the Notification, except by succession
or under a grant of contract in writing made or entered
into by or on behalf of the Government or some person
in whom such right, or power to create such right was
vested when the Notification was issued. Thereafter, the
Forest Settlement Officer shall have to make an inquiry
into all claims duly preferred. Where no claim is
preferred under Section 5 of the Act and of the
existence of which no knowledge has been acquired by
inquiry under Section 7 of the Act, all claims shall be
extinguished unless, before the final notification under
Section 17 of the Act is published, the Forest Settlement
Officer is satisfied that a person had sufficient cause for
not preferring such a claim within the period fixed under
Section 5 of the Act. In such case, the Forest Settlement
Officer shall proceed to dispose of the claim as per law.
Where a claim is admitted, the Forest Settlement Officer
has to specify certain details and record the same in the

final record. Subsequent to following of the procedure
contemplated under Sections 5, 6, 11 to 14 of the Act,
the State Government has to publish a Notification,
specifying clearly and according to the boundary marks
erected or otherwise, the limits of the forest which it
intended to constitute as reserved forest and declaring
the same to be a reserved forest from the date fixed by
such notification, subject to the exercise of rights (if
any) specified in such notification. From the date so
fixed, such forest shall be deemed to be a reserved
forest. A Notification issued under Section 17 of the Act
shall be published in accordance with Section 18 of the

(e) There is force in the submission of learned counsel
appearing for the appellants that in the absence of any
challenge to the 1929 Notification, the constitution of
Chamundibetta State Reserved Forest would remain
intact by operation of law. 'Once a forest, always a
forest' should operate as a Thumb Rule vide NARINDER
SINGH vs. DIVESH BHUTANI5 , in these days when
forests are fast depleting with unprecedented
acceleration because of dreadful population growth and
allied factors. The Apex Court has specifically observed
that unless the forest is denotified, the same would
continue as forest ever. There is absolutely no material
on record to indicate that any subsequent Notification
was issued by the State Government denotifying the suit
lands from being State Reserve Forest.
(f) Learned Panel Counsel and the learned HCGP are
more than justified in pointing out that the Revenue
Records since 1950 had reflected the suit lands as being
'State Forest Acquired', for decades uninterruptedly.
However, for the first time, name of Sri.Mayaga S/o
Malla came to be entered only for the years 1970-71 to
1973-74. In some records, his name is continued for a
bit longer period, is also true. On what basis, these
entries came to be abruptly made in the name of a
private party remains a secret within the mystery
wrapped in enigma. Even in appeal, nothing has been
stated by the respondent plaintiffs, despite being
repeatedly asked. The other significant thing is that
even for these years, in the usage column of the RTC,
the word 'Acq' being the short form of acquisition
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 77
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
continues. From the year 1980-81, the entry 'State
Forest Acquired' is restored to other columns without
the name of Mayaga. There is a strong presumption in
the given circumstances u/s 133 of the 1964 Act as to
these long standing entries being genuine. Conversely,
the entries made in the Revenue Records sansany
conveyance or the like does not enjoy presumptive
value.
(g) Pursuant to 1929 Notification issued u/s 17 of the
1900 Act, as observed above, the Chamundibetta State
Reserve Forest came to be formed and it obviously
comprised of the suit lands. The Forest Map which is
more than thirty year old and which has come from the
- 84 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024

HC-KAR
proper custody namely the Forest Department enjoys
presumptive value u/s 90 of the Indian Evidence Act,
1872, nothing of rebuttal having been shown. The
arguable absence of entries in the Revenue Records
would not rob away the legal effect of such a statutory
Notification, making of entries being only incidental to
the same. Whatever be that, there was 1935/1940
Notification issued under the 1894 Act, as well.
However, appellants too have not placed on record any
more material to show that the same resulted into
accomplishment of acquisition of the subject lands. Of
course, decades have rolled since the issuance of that
Notification, is obvious. In the Clin of Time, things
vanish and memory fades, needs no research to know.
(h) The long standing entries in favour of the Forest
Department would also lend credence to the contention
of Sri.P.D.Surana, learned Panel Counsel appearing for
the KSRTC that acquisition having been duly
accomplished, the said entries having been made
continued unopposed and therefore, even if 1929 Forest
Notification is held to have not comprised the suit lands,
there is absolutely no case for the plaintiffs' side. The
Apex Court in STATE OF KARNATAKA VS. I.S. NIRAVANE
GOWDA6 at paragraphs 3 & 4 has observed as under: "
... The learned counsel contended that Ext.D-1, being
the true copy of the Gazette Notification dated
26.6.1937, was rightly accepted by the trial Court as
well as the first appellate Court and the High Court was
not justified in not accepting the same particularly when
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 78
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
it had become a part of the record and no objection had
been taken by the respondents at the time of recoding
the evidence. He also submitted that Ext. D-2, being the
statement of lands taken for Indavara State Forest in
Hukkund Village, should have been accepted. ... The trial
Court as well as the first appellate Court, based on the
evidence, recorded findings that the lands in question
were the part of reserved forest. We do not find any
good ground or a valid reason for rejection of Ext. D-1
by the High Court. When the lands were included in
reserve forest, the entries in the revenue records were
of non consequence and further, mere saguvali chits did
not confer any title on the suit lands. This apart, the
Revenue Authorities were not competent to deal with

the property which was the part of the reserved forest.
..."
(i) Learned counsel appearing for the State & its officials
is right in telling us that in view of the statutory scheme
enacted in 1900 Act as interpreted by the Coordinate
Bench in B.R.GANAPATHI SINGH supra, the suit itself
was not maintainable. The grievance of private citizens
in respect of land comprised in section 17 Notification
has to be worked out as provided under the very same
statute. In fact, at para 36, what has been observed
being supportive of this view, is reproduced: "Further, in
the aforesaid context, we do not think that there can be
any distinction with regard to a piece of land which has
been decided to be constituted as reserved forest under
Section 4(1) of the Act and land being deemed to be
reserved forest under Section 17 of the Act which is like
a final notification. The reason being, once the land is
constituted as reserved forest under Section 4(1) of the
Act, it is by issuance of a Notification then the claims
would have to be made and it is only on the
consideration of the claims that an application for
exclusion of the land constituted as reserved forest
under Section 4(1) of the Act could be ordered. Merely
because the procedure contemplated under the Act
subsequent to the issuance of a Notification under
Section 4 of the Act is not yet completed or no
Notification has been issued under Section 17(1) of the
Act, in our view, would not make any difference, as the
object and purpose of reserving any land is to treat the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 79
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
said land as being constituted a reserved forest. If such
a land or any portion thereof is excluded on adjudication
of claims, it would not find a place in Notification issued
under Section 17 of the Act. In such a case, it would no
longer be constituted as reserved forest. But, till that
procedure is not completed by the Forest Settlement
Officer, it remains to be constituted as reserved forest."
(j) Had land owner Mayaga any grievance against the
formation of Reserve Forest inter alia because of
inclusion of the subject lands, he could have had
recourse for redressal as provided under the provisions
of 1900 Act itself. It is difficult to assume that
Sri.Mayaga had any such grievance inasmuch as he had
not instituted any proceedings either after the formation

of State Reserve Forest or after the issuance of
1935/1940 acquisition Notification. It has been a settled
position of law that once a special statute establishes
separate machinery for working out the grievance,
ordinarily, the jurisdiction of civil courts stands excluded
vide a Five Bench decision in DHULABAI vs. STATE OF
MADHYA PRADESH7 . The following observations therein
are worth advertence: "1) Where the statute gives a
finality to the orders of the special tribunals the Civil
Courts' jurisdiction must be held to be excluded if there
is adequate remedy to do what the Civil Courts would
normally do in a suit... Where there is no express
exclusion the examination of the remedies and the
scheme of the particular Act to find out the intendment
becomes necessary and the result of the inquiry may be
decisive. In the latter case it is necessary to see if the
statute creates a special right or a liability and provides
for the determination of the right or liability and further
lays down that all questions about the said right and
liability shall be determined by the tribunals so
constituted, and whether remedies normally associated
with actions in Civil Courts are prescribed by the said
statute or not." Whether the contention as to
maintainability of a suit was specifically taken in the
pleadings or not, the same can be raised even in appeal,
needs no mentioning. However, such a contention is
loosely taken in the Written Statements.
(k) The vehement contention of learned counsel
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 80
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
appearing for the respondent-plaintiffs that if the 1929
Notification had comprised the suit lands for the
formation of State Reserve Forest, the 1935/1940
Notification would not have been issued under the 1894
Act, appears attractive at the first blush. However, a
deeper examination thereof shows its untenability:
firstly, it is crystal clear that the 1929 Notification has
formed the State Reserve Forest and the Forest Map
appended to the same also shows demarcation of
boundaries within which such a forest is declared.
Therefore, non-mentioning of the survey numbers of
suit lands would not advance the case of plaintiffs.
Whether 1935/1940 acquisition Notification culminated
into acquisition is also not forthcoming. It is possible to
assume that this acquisition Notification resulted into
such a culmination would not come to the rescue of

respondents in view of the 1929 Forest Notification,
more particularly because of the observations made in
GANAPATHI SINGH supra and in NARINDER SINGH too
i.e., 'once the forest, always forest'. Much deliberation
beyond this in this regard is not required.
(l) The last submission of learned counsel appearing for
the respondent-plaintiffs that there is abundant material
to sustain the finding as to the plaintiffs being the
descendants of Sri.Mayaga, does not merit deeper
consideration, in view of our specific finding that the suit
lands are comprised in the State Reserve Forest under
the 1929 statutory Notification, regardless of 1935/1940
acquisition Notification. It is also true that the impugned
judgement & decree do not satisfactorily treat
contentions of the parties in this regard, despite the
battle lines being drawn up by virtue of their pleadings.
(m) There is yet another aspect that arises because of
the Survey Report dated 23.07.2021 which specifically
states that the KSRTC Bus Stand and its allied units do
exist in the area not comprised in the suit lands,
although a small portion thereof partly protrudes in one
of the suit lands. We appreciate the fairness of learned
counsel appearing for the respondent-plaintiffs in
submitting on instructions that his clients are fully in
agreement with the Survey Report and that they have
no objection whatsoever to the same. He has also added
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 81
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
that his clients have absolutely no grievance whatsoever
for the continued existence of the KSRTC Bus Stand and
its allied units/activities.
In the above circumstances, this appeal succeeds; the
impugned judgment & decree of the court below are set
at naught; the suit of respondents in O.S.No.476/2010
is dismissed, however, costs having been made easy in
peculiar circumstances.
A direction issues for the updation/correction of entries
in all the official records concerning the subject lands
and to show the same as being part of Chamundibetta
State Reserve Forest. Compliance Report should be filed
with the Registrar General of this Court within three
months and delay in compliance would be viewed
contemptuously.

two documents which have been placed by the

1977, being the subsequent purchasers, cannot
claim any right, title or interest superior to their

decision of the Hon'ble Madras High Court in B.
Nagaraj vs State of Tamil Nadu10, more
particularly para nos. 7 and 8 thereof, which
are reproduced hereunder for easy reference:
7. In that regard, the judgment of the Apex Court in the
case of Meera Sahni Vs. Lt.Governor of Delhi (reported
in 2008 (9) SCC 177), is also relevant, wherein it was
held that a person entering to the sale or any injunction
of the land under acquisition after issuance of the
Notification under Section 4(1) of the Act of 1894, has
no right to challenge the acquisition proceedings or seek
lapse of the proceedings. The relevant paragraphs of the
said judgment, are quoted hereunder for ready
reference: "17. When a piece of land is sought to be
acquired, a notification under Section 4 of Land
Acquisition Act is required to be issued by the State
Government strictly in accordance with law. The said
notification is also required to be followed by a
declaration to be made under Section 6 of the Land
Acquisition Act and with the issuance of such a
notification any encumbrance created by the owner, or
any transfer made after the issuance of such a
notification would be deemed to be void and would not
be binding on the government. A number of decisions of
this Court have recognized the aforesaid proposition of
law wherein it was held that subsequent purchaser
cannot challenge acquisition proceedings and also the

possession of the land after the declaration under
Section 6 of the Act. 18. In U.P.Jal Nigam Vs. Kalra
Properties (P) Ltd. (1996 (3) SCC 124), it was stated by
this Court that (SCC p.126, para 3): "3. ...Having regard
to the facts of this case, we were not inclined to further
adjourn the case nor to remit the case for fresh
consideration by the High Court. It is well settled law
that after the notification under Section 4(1) is
published in the Gazette any encumbrance created by
the owner does not bind the Government and the
purchaser does not acquire any title to the property."
19. In Sneh Prabha Vs. State of U.P. (1996 (7) SCC
426), it is stated as under (SCC p.430, para 5): "5. ...It
is settled law that any person who purchases land after
publication of the notification under Section 4(1), does
so at his/her own peril. The object of publication of the
notification under Section 4(1) is notice toeveryone that
the land is needed or is likely to be needed for public
purpose and the acquisition proceedings point out and
an implement to anyone to encumber the land acquired
thereunder. It authorizes the designated officer to enter
upon the land to do preliminaries etc. Therefore, any
alienation of the land after the publication of the
notification under Section 4(1) does not bind the
government or the beneficiary under the acquisition. On
taking possession of the land, all rights, title and
interests in land stand vested in the State, under
Section 16 of the Act, free from all encumbrances and
thereby absolute title in the land is acquired
thereunder."
8. In the light of the ratio propounded by the Apex
Court on the issue, so far as the writ petitioners are
concerned, they have no right to challenge the Award
issued in the year 1994, on the ground that it was after
two years of the Declaration under Section 6 of the Act
of 1894, having purchased the land much subsequent to
the Notification issued under Section 4(1) of the Act of
1894.

18. The document dated 14.08.1979 clearly reflected
that Survey No. 67 (old) had been renumbered in

that in 1921 notification under the Forest Regulation
Survey No. 67 was covered. Subsequently in the

prevail over the survey number, the boundaries
being clearly demarcated in the notification
dated 08.1.1921; the change in survey number
cannot be taken advantage of by the Petitioners

Narasimha Shastry vs Mangesha Devaru12,
more particularly para No. 6 thereof which is

6. As early as in the year 1948, the Privy Council in
the case of B.K.A.P. Co-operative
Society v. Government of Palestine [1948 PC 207.]
observed as follows:--
"In construing a grant of land a description by
fixed boundaries is to be preferred to a conflicting
description by area. The statement as to area is to be
rejected as falsa demonstratio."
Same view was taken referring to this decision by
the High Court of Madras in the case
of Siviseshamuthu v. Balakrishna [AIR 1963 Madras
147.] and it was reproduced by the trial Court in its
judgment as-
"Where the property sold is part of a definite
survey number and in the sale deed the exact
boundaries of the part sold are given and the area
mentioned is only approximate, the description by
boundaries should prevail in ascertaining the actual
property sold under the document."
Nagpur High Court in the case of T. Rajlu
Naidu v. M.E.R. Malar [AIR 1930 Nagpur 197.] also
took the same view that-
"In the case of a discrepancy the dimensions and
boundaries and the area specified within the

the quantity specified."

Keeping in view this well established proposition
and principle in the matter of construction of a
document or instrument, the Court has to find out
what exactly was the property sold under the sale
deed relied upon by the plaintiff.
22.35. By relying on Narasimha Shastry's case he
submits that the boundaries would prevail over
measurements and as such, the boundaries as
per the notification would prevail over both
measurements as also the identity of properties
by way of survey number.

6. In the present appeal, the learned counsel for the

identity of the plot sold is clear from the
circumstances which we have already set out above.
He relies on Thakur Barmha v. Jiban Ram

happened was that the judgment-debtor owned a
mahal in which ten annas share was mortgaged while
the remainder was free from encumbrances. A
creditor of his attached and put up for sale six annas
share out of the mortgaged share. The property
attached was sold. When the auction purchasers
applied for the sale certificate they alleged that a
mistake had been made in the schedule of the
property to be sold in that the word "not" had been
omitted from the description of the six annas share
and that the property should have been described as
being six annas not mortgaged. This prayer of theirs
was allowed by the executing court and the appeal to
the High Court failed. On appeal to the Privy Council,
it was held that in a judicial sale only the property
attached can be sold and that property is conclusively
described in and by the schedule to which the
attachment refers, namely, the six annas share
subject to an existing mortgage. The Privy Council
therefore allowed the appeal and observed that a
case of misdescription could be treated as a mere
irregularity; but the case before them was a case of
identity and not of misdescription. It was pointed out
that a property fully identified in the schedule may be
in some respects misdescribed, which would be a
different case. Thus the effect of this decision is that
where there is no doubt as to the identity and there
is only misdescription that could be treated as a mere
irregularity. Another case on which reliance has been
placed on behalf of the respondents is Gossain Das
Kundu v. Mrittunjoy Agnan Sardar [(1913) 18 CLJ
541] . In that case the land sold was described by
boundaries and area; but the area seems to have
been incorrect. It was held to be a case of
misdescription of the area and the boundaries were
held to prevail.
7. We are of opinion that the present case is
analogous to a case of misdescription. As already
pointed out the area, the khata number and the
boundaries all refer to Plot No. 1060 and what has
happened is that in writing the plot number, one zero
has been missed and 1060 has become 160. It is also
important to remember that there is no plot bearing
No. 160 in Khata No. 97. In these circumstances we

are of opinion that the High Court was right in
holding that this is a case of misdescription only and
that the identity of the property sold is well
established, namely, that it is Plot No. 1060. The
matter may have been different if no boundaries had
been given in the final decree for sale as well as in
the sale certificate and only the plot number was
mentioned. But where we have both the boundaries
and the plot number and the circumstances are as in
this case, the mistake in the plot number must be
treated as a mere misdescription which does not
affect the identity of the property sold. The
contention of the appellants therefore with respect to
this plot must fail.
22.37. By relying on Sheodhyan Singh's case, he
submits that when the boundaries have been
clearly identified even if there is mistake in the
survey number, the same would have to be
ignored, thus he submits that the confusion
sought to be created by the petitioners even as
regards survey numbers even after they are re-
numbered is to be ignored by this Court and
what is required to be considered is the
boundary as per the notification published in
the gazette.

41. The law is well settled that if a property is
described by distinct boundaries which can be
identified, any mistake in the survey number of the
land has to be ignored. The maximum 'falsa
demonstration non-nocet' has been applied in such a
situation.
42. Even if the property is known by a definite name
as happens when a particular land has a local name

plaintiffs side but their learned counsel seeks to rely

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 92
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
been comprised in the said forest. True it is that the
survey numbers in which the suit lands are situate
are not in so many words found in the subject
Notification or the Forest Map. However, when a
State Reserve Forest is sought to be constituted by
Notifications of the kind, the land comprised therein
is demarked by the boundary lines. If suit lands
obviously fall within the said boundary lines, non-
mentioning of the survey numbers pale into
insignificance. After all, it has been a settled position
since the days of Privy Council that as between
numbers denoting the area and the boundaries, the
latter shall prevail over the former, should there be
discordance.
22.40. By relying on all of the above case laws, he
submits that the boundaries would prevail over
measurement and or identity of the survey
number. The extent of land in occupation of the
Petitioners coming within the boundaries of the
notification dated 08.01.1921, the same
amounts to forest land as regards which the
State can take necessary action.

evicted. It is no doubt true that according to Section
64-A a show-cause notice has to be issued. But that
can only be with a view to enable the person to
whom notice is issued to show that his land does
not fall within the boundaries of the forest as drawn
up by the Survey of India. If the land is identified as
falling within the Survey of India boundary then
there could be no other defence open to the person
concerned and the State would be under an
obligation and duty to evict the encroacher, by force
if necessary.
22.42. By relying on Godavarman's case he submits
that the scope of an enquiry under 64A has
been dealt with by the Hon'ble Apex Court and
the Hon'ble Apex Court has categorically held
that the only defence available to encroachers
is to show that it does not fall within the

not be applicable in the case of the plaintiffs for the
reason that it does not disclose the Khasra No. of the
suit land of the plaintiffs, it is submitted that an
explanation, given under Section 4(1) of the Forest
Act, specifically holds that for the purpose of
specifying the situation and limits of the land to be
declared as forest land it is sufficient to describe the
limits of the forest by roads, rivers and other readily
intelligible boundaries. For convenience sake, the
explanation of Section 4(1) of the Forest Act is
reproduced below : -
"Explanation.- For the purpose of clause (b), it shall
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 95
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
be sufficient to describe the limits of the forest by
roads, rivers, ridges or other well-known or readily
intelligible boundaries."
15. Dealing with the issue of whether the jurisdiction
of the Civil Court was barred or not, if we see the
decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case
of Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation v. Bal
Mukund Bairwa, reported in (2009) 4 SCC 299, the
Supreme Court has categorically held that if a statute
while creating rights and obligations does not
constitute a forum for enforcing the same, the
plenary jurisdiction of civil court cannot be held to
have been taken away. That is to say in the event if
there is a forum for enforcing the provisions of law in
the special statute created for the specific purpose
then in that case by implication the jurisdiction of the
civil court would be taken away. The decision of the
Supreme Court in the said case was on the basis of
the principles laid down in the case of Rajasthan
State Road Transport Corporation v. Krishna Kant,
reported in AIR 1995 SC 1715, where the Hon'ble
Supreme Court has held that power of a civil court
would be only in a case where there is no other
alternative remedy available for a person for the
recognition, observance and enforcement of his right.
In such case, the recourse of the civil court would be
open. However, in the same judgement, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in categorical terms held that where
there is an alternate remedy under an Act created,
then only the remedy is to approach the forum
created by the said Act.

19. Thus, from the plain reading to the settled
position of law, it is evidently clear that where under
the provisions of law or in a statute, the legislature
has created a hierarchy of authority and also the
provisions of challenging these orders of the
authorities by way of appeal for the determination of
the issues is sufficient for enforcing that the
jurisdiction of the civil court to try the same is barred
as has been decided by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
the case of Desika Charyulu v. State of Andhra
Pradesh, reported in AIR 1964 SC 807. That being so,
the trial Court has erred in law in deciding the issue
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 96
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
that it has the jurisdiction in entertaining Civil Suit

decree dated 30.12.2003 which has also been
affirmed and confirmed by the first appellate Court
vide its judgement and decree dated 25.11.2004
passed in Civil Appeal No. 1-A/2004. Needless to say,
if the law permits the respondents/plaintiffs may
approach the competent authority under the
provisions of law.
22.44. By relying on Chandra Bhan Singh's case, he
submits that it is the limits of the forest by way
of intelligible boundaries which should have to
be considered to determine if any particular
land is part of a forest land or not. The mere
description or identification by a number would
not be sufficient. What is required to be
considered is the boundaries in the notification
reserving the land for forest.

14. Section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908
provides jurisdiction to try all suits of civil nature
excepting those that are expressly or impliedly
barred which reads as under:
"9.Courts to try all civil suits unless barred.--The
courts shall (subject to the provisions herein
contained) have jurisdiction to try all suits of a civil
nature excepting suits of which their cognizance is
either expressly or impliedly barred."
From the above provision, it is clear that courts have
jurisdiction to try all suits of a civil nature excepting
suits of which their cognizance is either expressly or
impliedly barred. The jurisdiction of civil court with
regard to a particular matter can be said to be
excluded if there is an express provision or by
implication it can be inferred that the jurisdiction is

court's jurisdiction for availability of alternative forum
should be taken before the trial court and at the
earliest failing which the higher court may refuse to
entertain the plea in the absence of proof of
prejudice.
15. In State of Bihar v. Dhirendra Kumar [(1995) 4 SCC
229] the core question was whether a civil suit is
maintainable and ad interim injunction could be
issued where proceedings under the Land Acquisition
Act, 1894 was taken pursuant to the notice issued
under Section 9 of the Act and possession delivered
to the beneficiary. On going through the entire
proceedings initiated under the Land Acquisition Act,
this Court held as under: (SCC p. 230, para 3)
"3. ... We are, therefore, inclined to think, as presently
advised, that by necessary implication the power of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 99
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
the civil court to take cognizance of the case under
Section 9 CPC stands excluded, and a civil court has
no jurisdiction to go into the question of the validity
or legality of the notification under Section 4 and
declaration under Section 6, except by the High Court
in a proceeding under Article 226 of the Constitution.
So, the civil suit itself was not maintainable."
After holding so, this Court set aside the finding of
the trial court that there is a prima facie triable issue.
It also held that the order of injunction was without
jurisdiction.
16. In Laxmi Chand v. Gram Panchayat,
Kararia [(1996) 7 SCC 218] while considering Section
9 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 vis-à-vis the
Land Acquisition Act, 1894, this Court held as under:
(SCC p. 220, paras 2-3)
"2. ... It is seen that Section 9 of the Civil
Procedure Code, 1908 gives jurisdiction to the
civil court to try all civil suits, unless barred. The
cognizance of a suit of civil nature may either
expressly or impliedly be barred. The procedure
contemplated under the Act is a special
procedure envisaged to effectuate public

purpose, compulsorily acquiring the land for use
of public purpose. The notification under Section
4 and declaration under Section 6 of the Act are
required to be published in the manner
contemplated thereunder. The inference gives
conclusiveness to the public purpose and the
extent of the land mentioned therein. The award
should be made under Section 11 as envisaged
thereunder. The dissatisfied claimant is provided
with the remedy of reference under Section 18
and a further appeal under Section 54 of the
Act. If the Government intends to withdraw from
the acquisition before taking possession of the
land, procedure contemplated under Section 48
requires to be adhered to. If possession is
taken, it stands vested under Section 16 in the
State with absolute title free from all
encumbrances and the Government has no
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 100
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
power to withdraw from acquisition.
3. It would thus be clear that the scheme of the Act
is complete in itself and thereby the jurisdiction of
the civil court to take cognizance of the cases
arising under the Act, by necessary implication,
stood barred. The civil court thereby is devoid of
jurisdiction to give declaration on the invalidity of
the procedure contemplated under the Act. The
only right an aggrieved person has is to approach
the constitutional courts viz. the High Court and
the Supreme Court under their plenary power
under Articles 226 and 136 respectively with self-
imposed restrictions on their exercise of
extraordinary power. Barring thereof, there is no
power to the civil court."
17. In Bangalore Development Authority v. K.S.
Narayan [(2006) 8 SCC 336] , which arose under
the Bangalore Development Authority Act, 1976 and
which was similar to the case on hand, this Court
held that a civil suit is not maintainable to challenge
the acquisition proceedings. In that case one

passed against the defendant Bangalore
Development Authority, their agents and servants
restraining them from interfering with the
plaintiff's possession and enjoyment of the plaint
scheduled property and from demolishing any
structure situate thereon. The case of the plaintiff
was that the plaintiff purchased the property in
dispute bearing No. 46, situated in Banasawadi
Village, K.R. Pura Hobli, Bangalore, South Taluk
from S. Narayana Gowda by means of a
registered sale deed dated 17-6-1985. The
erstwhile owners of the property had obtained
conversion certificate from the Tahsildar and the
property is situated in a layout which is properly
approved by obtaining conversion for non-
agricultural use from the competent authority.
The plaintiff applied for mutation entries and the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 101
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
same was granted in his favour. The property in
dispute was not covered by any acquisition
proceedings as neither notice of acquisition had
been received nor any award regarding the said
property had been passed. The defendant had no
right, title or interest over the property but it was
trying to dispossess the plaintiff from the same on
the ground of alleged acquisition. The plaintiff
issued a notice to the defendant on 11-7-1989
calling upon it not to interfere with his possession
and enjoyment of the property in dispute....
3. The suit was contested by the defendant Bangalore
Development Authority on the ground inter alia that
the plaintiff was not the owner of the property in
dispute. S. Narayana Gowda, who is alleged to have
executed the sale deed in favour of the plaintiff on
17-6-1985, had no right, title or interest over the
property in dispute and he could not have conveyed
any title to the plaintiff. It was further pleaded that
the disputed land had been acquired by the
Bangalore Development Authority after issuing
preliminary and final notifications in accordance
with the Bangalore Development Authority Act and
the possession had also been taken over and
thereafter it was handed over to the engineering
section on 22-6-1988 after completion of all
formalities. The award for the land acquired had

already been made and the compensation amount
had been deposited in the civil court under Sections
30 and 31(2) of the Land Acquisition Act. It was
specifically pleaded that it was the defendant
Bangalore Development Authority which was in
possession of the plaint scheduled property on the
date of filing of the suit and, therefore, the suit for
injunction filed by the plaintiff was not maintainable
and was liable to be dismissed." (SCC pp. 337-38,
paras 2-3)
It is relevant to note that in the above decision in K.S.
Narayan case [(2006) 8 SCC 336] , the acquisition
proceedings in question had been taken under the
Bangalore Development Authority Act, 1976 and the
provisions of Sections 17 and 19 are somewhat

Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
similar to the provisions of Sections 4 and 6 of the
Land Acquisition Act, 1894. After noting out all the
details, this Court allowed the appeals and set aside
the decision rendered by the High Court.
18. It is clear that the Land Acquisition Act is a
complete code in itself and is meant to serve public
purpose. By necessary implication, the power of the
civil court to take cognizance of the case under
Section 9 CPC stands excluded and a civil court has
no jurisdiction to go into the question of the validity
or legality of the notification under Section 4,
declaration under Section 6 and subsequent
proceedings except by the High Court in a proceeding
under Article 226 of the Constitution. It is thus clear
that the civil court is devoid of jurisdiction to give
declaration or even bare injunction being granted on
the invalidity of the procedure contemplated under
the Act. The only right available for the aggrieved
person is to approach the High Court under Article
226 and this Court under Article 136 with self-
imposed restrictions on their exercise of
extraordinary power.

total bar on the Civil Court to entertain the suit to

not maintainable as envisaged under Section 6(3) of
the Forest Act. The Courts below have committed
serious error in decreeing the suit, there is
perversity and illegality in the judgment and decree

Forest Act. Thus, he once again reiterates that irrespective of the petitioner itself having filed the

is forest land coming within the purview of the Forest Act.

High Court can quash charge sheet or show cause notice if it is found without jurisdiction or for
some other reason if it is

NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR wholly illegal. The said para 16 in Kunishetty Satyanarayana's21
case is reproduced hereunder for easy reference:
16. No doubt, in some very rare and exceptional cases the High Court can quash a
charge-sheet or show-cause notice if it is found to be wholly without jurisdiction or
for some other reason if it is wholly illegal. However, ordinarily the High Court
should not interfere in such a matter.
23.2. He submits that Kunishetty Satyanarayana's case was also distinguished by the
Hon'ble High Court of Madras in S. Sridharan vs Engineer in Chief (WRO) and Chief
Engineer (General), PWD22, more particularly para nos.
19 and 20 thereof, which are reproduced hereunder for easy reference:
19. The decision relied on by the learned Government Advocate in Union of India and
Anr. v. Kunisetty Satyanarayana is not applicable to the question involved in this
matter. In the said decision, the Honourable Apex Court has considered about the
merits and legality of issuing a show cause notice or charge sheet and the question of
delay in issuing the charge memo was not at all considered in the said decision. On
the other hand, the Honourable Apex Court has specifically held even in that decision
as here under:
2006 12 SCC 28 Manu/TN/1088/2009
- 114 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR Writ jurisdiction is discretionary jurisdiction and
hence such discretion under Article 226 should not ordinarily be exercised by
quashing a show cause notice or charge sheet. Albeit, in some very rare and
exceptional cases the High Court can quash a charge sheet or show cause notice if it is
found to be wholly without jurisdiction or for some other reason if it is wholly illegal.
20. As far as the case on hand is concerned, it is to be reiterated that there is an
inordinate and unexplained delay of six years in issuing the first charge memo as the
incident took place during the year 1984 and the first charge memo was issued in the
year 1990 and the said charge memo was ultimately cancelled without any enquiry by
order dated 20.04.2004 without indicating any contemplation of issuing fresh charge
memo against the petitioner. The impugned second charge memo was issued two
months thereafter, i.e., on 30.06.2004 and as such the second charge memo was
issued against the petitioner nearly 20 years after the alleged incident causing grave
prejudice to the petitioner resulting miscarriage of justice and such action of the first
respondent is no doubt wholly illegal and unjustified warranting interference of this
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 105
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
Court to quash the impugned charge memo.
For the foregoing reasons, this Court has no hesitation to come to an irresistible conclusion to the
effect that the inordinate and unexplained delay in issuing the impugned charge memo would vitiate
the disciplinary proceedings and the charge memo dated 30.06.2004 issued by the respondent
herein in his proceedings in Charge Memo No. CII(2)/17421/90-45 is liable to be quashed and
accordingly quashed and the Writ Petition is allowed. Consequently, the connected Miscellaneous
Petitions are closed. There is no order as to costs.

NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR 23.3. He submits by relying on S.Sridharan's case that this Court
could exercise jurisdiction when there is a gross delay in the initiation of the proceedings. As regards
the contention that the proceedings before the Civil Court are without jurisdiction and the findings
of the Civil Court are not required to be looked into, he submits that the said proceedings had not
been initiated by the Petitioners but were initiated by the Respondents, the Respondents after
having initiated civil proceedings cannot now contend otherwise, in fact in the first proceedings filed
by Contending that there is interference with his possession by the Forest Department, Petitioner

having been dismissed, the first appeal having been allowed, in the second appeal filed by the Forest

The State, having competent persons to advise them, having acted on such advice and filed civil
suits, cannot now contend that the civil suit is not maintainable and the findings given in the civil
suit are not binding.

whether the boundaries prevail over the measurement or measurement prevail over boundaries or
whether there is a dispute as regards identity of the property itself is not something which will be

23.6. As regards the contention that there is a fundamental duty on the Government to preserve
forest land, he submits that such duty is required to be exercised within a reasonable period of time.
The notification having been issued on 08.01.1921, the grant having been made in the year 1932, an
auction having been held in the year 1936 in respect of Sy.No.69,

the instant petition.
23.7. He differs from the contention of the learned Additional Advocate General that once lands are
declared as reserved forests, entries in revenue records in subsequent transactions are of no
consequence. He submits that the government itself, having granted the said lands and thereafter
having auctioned the land, the government cannot contend to the contrary; the same would be a
dishonest contention. In this regard, he relies upon the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Anand

19. Mr K.K. Venugopal, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the State of U.P.
strongly supported the view taken by the CEC. The learned counsel submitted that
the omission to identify the trees at the project site as forest or deemed forest was not
due to any mistake or by chance. He pointed out that in the parameters set out by the
State Level Expert Committee for identification of forests or forest-like areas it was
clarified that "trees mean naturally grown perennial trees" and it was further
stipulated that "the plantation done on public land or private land will not be
identified as forest-like area". Mr Venugopal submitted that the guidelines made by
the Expert Committee were reported to this Court and accepted by it on 12-12-2007.
The project site clearly did not come within the parameters fixed by the Expert
Committee and it was rightly not identified as a forest-like area. The parameters fixed
by the Expert Committee for identification of forests or forest-like area were never
challenged by anyone and now it was too late in the day to question those
parameters, more so after those were accepted by this Court. Mr Venugopal
contended that the non-inclusion of the project site as a forest or forest-like area by
the State Level Expert Committee should be conclusive of the fact that the area was
not forest land and the trees standing there were no forest.

21. In the report it was also stated that the latest forest cover assessment by the FSI
was based on satellite data of 2006 and it did not have any data of the later period. It
further stated that the felling of trees might have taken place after October 2006. Mr
Bhushan invited our attention to the order of this Court in T.N. Godavarman
Thirumulpad (98) v. Union of India [(2006) 5 SCC 28] (SCC paras 16, 18, 33, 37, 38)
to show that this Court had accepted the reliability of the FSI Report based on
satellite imagery.
23.8. By relying on Anand Arya's case, he submits that the Hon'ble Apex Court took into
consideration the revenue records and considered the factum that the land had never

records. 23.9. He also relies upon the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Elizabeth Jacob vs

land in the year 1992 after the property was attached and that on 3-11-1994, the
Tahsildar, Peermade wrote to the Forest Department to vacate the land, as it had to
be sold by public auction. The Forest Department did not initiate any action in regard
to the land even thereafter. On the other hand, the Revenue Authorities asserted their
possession and put up the land for sale in 1998 under the provisions of the Act.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 108
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
The appellant purchased the land in the auction-sale and obtained a sale certificate, under which the
land vested in her free from encumbrances.
14. The Division Bench also noticed that the land had been shown as "government poramboke" (that
is wasteland belonging to the Government) in the revenue records at the relevant time and that the
notification under the Forest Act relied upon by the respondents did not show that the land was
forest land. The Division Bench did not record any finding that the land was a forest land, but on the
other hand, held that the State Government had not produced any material to show that the land
was forest land or part of reserve forest. It also observed that as the Revenue Authorities had
proceeded on 2008 15 SCC 166
- 122 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR the basis that Ansari and others had right over the land and as the
Revenue Authorities had sold the land to the appellant in a revenue auction, the State Government
could not in the normal course turn around and say that no rights were acquired by the appellant as
purchaser at the revenue auction. 23.10. By relying on Elizabath Jacob's case, he submits that when
a common man is led to believe that lands have a good title and there are no encumbrances
whatsoever by way of an action of the government itself, the rights of such a common man are
required to be protected.
23.11. He also relies upon the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Godrej and Boyce
Manufacturing Company Ltd. vs State of Maharashtra and Ors.25 more particularly paras nos. 81 to
84 thereof, which are reproduced hereunder for easy reference:
2014 3 SCC 430

81. In Pratibha [Pratibha Coop. Housing Society Ltd. v. State of Maharashtra, (1991)
3 SCC 341] the eight unauthorised floors were constructed in clear and flagrant
violation and disregard of the FSI. The demolition order had already attained finality
in this Court and thereafter six of the unauthorised floors had been demolished and
the seventh was partially demolished. This Court found no justification to interfere
with the demolitions. Again, the issue of compensation does not arise in such a
situation.
82. The application of the principle laid down by this Court, therefore, depends on
the independent facts found in a case. The remedy of demolition cannot be applied
per se with a broad brush to all cases. The State also seems to have realised this and
that is perhaps the reason why it moved the application that it did in Godavarman.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 109
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
83. Looking at the issue from the point of view of the citizen and not only from the
point of view of the State or a well-meaning pressure group, it does appear that even
though the basic principle is that the buyer should beware and therefore if the
appellants and the purchasers of tenements or commercial establishments from the
appellants ought to bear the consequences of unauthorised construction, the
well-settled principle of caveat emptor would be applicable in normal circumstances
and not in extraordinary circumstances as these appeals present, when a citizen is
effectively led up the garden path for several decades by the State itself. The present
appeals do not relate to a stray or a few instances of unauthorised constructions and,
therefore, fall in a class of their own. In a case such as the present, if a citizen cannot
trust the State which has given statutory permissions and provided municipal
facilities, whom should he or she trust?
84. Assuming the disputed land was a private forest, the State remained completely
inactive when construction was going on over acres and acres of land and of a very
large number of buildings thereon and for a few decades. The State permitted the
construction through the development plans and by
- 124 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR granting exemption under the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation)
Act, 1976 and providing necessary infrastructure such as roads and sanitation on the disputed land
and the surrounding area. When such a large-scale activity involving the State is being carried on
over vast stretches of land exceeding a hundred acres, it is natural for a reasonable citizen to assume
that whatever actions are being taken are in accordance with law otherwise the State would certainly
step in to prevent such a massive and prolonged breach of the law. The silence of the State in all the
appeals before us led the appellants and a large number of citizens to believe that there was no
patent illegality in the constructions on the disputed land nor was there any legal risk in investing on
the disputed land. Under these circumstances, for the State or Bombay Environment Action Group
to contend that only the citizen must bear the consequences of the unauthorised construction may
not be appropriate. It is the complete inaction of the State, rather its active consent that has resulted
in several citizens being placed in a precarious position where they are now told that their
investment is actually in unauthorised constructions which are liable to be demolished any time
even after several decades. There is no reason why these citizens should be the only victims of such a
fate and the State be held not responsible for this state of affairs; nor is there any reason why under
such circumstances this Court should not come to the aid of victims of the culpable failure of the
State to implement and enforce the law for several decades. 23.12. By relying on Godrej and Boyce's
case he submits that citizens having acted for several decades on the basis of what has been held out
by the State, the State cannot belatedly take action to the contrary thereto.

which are reproduced hereunder for easy reference:
16. This appeal challenges the said judgment and order. As mentioned hereinbefore
two questions require consideration -- how far and to what extent in exercise of its
jurisdiction under Article 226 or 227 of the Constitution and in this respect regarding
power to deal with factual findings, the jurisdiction of the High Court is akin both
under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution, can the High Court interfere with the
findings of fact? It is well settled that the High Court can set aside or ignore the
findings of fact of an appropriate court if there was no evidence to justify such a
conclusion and if no reasonable person could possibly have come to the conclusion
which the courts below have come or in other words a finding which was perverse in
law. This principle is well settled. In D.N. Banerji v. P.R. Mukherjee [(1952) 2 SCC
619 : AIR 1953 SC 58 : 1953 SCR 302, 305] it was laid down by this Court that unless
there was any grave miscarriage of justice or flagrant violation of law calling for
intervention it was not for the High Court under Articles 226 and 227 of the
Constitution to interfere. If there is evidence on record on which a finding can be
arrived at and if the court has not misdirected itself either on law or on fact, then in
exercise of the power under Article 226 or Article 227 of the Constitution, the High
Court should refrain from interfering with such findings made by the appropriate
authorities. We have noted that both the trial court and the appellate court after
discussing evidence have come to the conclusion that the appellant was a licensee in
possession on or before 1986 4 SCC 447
- 126 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR February 1, 1973. The learned trial court had expressed doubt about
Ex. A but ultimately accepted the position. There was leave and licence agreement. The learned
Appellate Bench of the Court of Small Causes doubted Ex. A and said that it was a concocted story. It
is true that there were discrepancies in the evidence of the obstructionists and there was
inconsistency in the conduct of the judgment-debtor in resisting the suit. Yet all these are for the
courts finding facts and it such fact- finding bodies have acted properly in law and if the findings
could not be described as perverse in law in the sense that no reasonable person properly instructed
in law could have come to such a finding, such findings should not be interfered with within the
exercise of the jurisdiction by the High Court under Article 226 and Article 227 of the Constitution.
17. In case of finding of facts, the court should not interfere in exercise of its jurisdiction under
Article 227 of the Constitution. Reference may be made to the observations of this Court in
Bathutmal Raichand Oswal v. Laxmibai R. Tarta [(1975) 1 SCC 858 : AIR 1975 SC 1297] where this
Court observed that the High Court could not in the guise of exercising its jurisdiction under Article
227 convert itself into a court of appeal when the legislature has not conferred a right of appeal. The
High Court was not competent to correct errors of facts by examining the evidence and
reappreciating. Speaking for the Court, Bhagwati, J. as the learned Chief Justice then was, observed
at p. 1301 of the report as follows: (SCC p. 864, para 7) "The special civil application preferred by the
appellant was admittedly an application under Article 227 and it is, therefore, material only to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 111
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
consider the scope and ambit of the jurisdiction of the High Court under that article. Did the High
Court have jurisdiction in an application under Article 227 to disturb the findings of fact reached by
the District Court? It is well settled by the decision of this Court in Waryam Singh v. Amarnath [AIR
1954 SC 215 :
1954 SCR 565] that the
- 127 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR ... power of superintendence conferred by Article 227
is, as pointed out by Harries, C.J., in Dalmia Jain Airways v. Sukumar Mukherjee
[AIR 1951 Cal 193 (SB)] to be exercised most sparingly and only in appropriate cases
in order to keep the subordinate courts within the bounds of their authority and not
for correcting mere errors.
This statement of law was quoted with approval in the subsequent decision of this Court in
Nagendra Nath Bose v. Commr. of Hills Division [AIR 1958 SC 398 : 1958 SCR 1240] and it was
pointed out by Sinha, J., as he then was, speaking on behalf of the court in that case:
It is thus, clear that the powers of judicial interference under Article 227 of the
Constitution with orders of judicial or quasi-judicial nature, are not greater than the
power under Article 226 of the Constitution. Under Article 226 the power of
interference may extend to quashing an impugned order on the ground of a mistake
apparent on the face of the record. But under Article 227 of the Constitution, the
power of interference is limited to seeing that the tribunal functions within the limits
of its authority."
18. The history and the development of the writ of certiorari, and scope and ambit of
its application have been emphasised by Lord Denning in R. v. Northumberland
Compensation Appeal Tribunal, Ex Parte Shaw [(1952) 1 All ER 122, 128] .
It is not necessary to reiterate these. But the courts must guard themselves against the error
mentioned by Morris, L.J. in the said decision at page 133 to use the power under Article 227 as the
cloak of an appeal in disguise. The writ of certiorari does not lie in order to bring up an order or
decision for rehearing of the issues raised in the proceedings. These inhibitions are more often than
not transgressed by the courts in exercise of jurisdiction under Article 227.
19. In this connection reference may also be made to the observations of this Court in Harbans Lal v.
Jagmohan Saran [(1985) 4 SCC 333] . See in
- 128 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR this connection the observations of this Court in Trimbak
Gangadhar Telang v. Ramchandra Ganesh Bhide [(1977) 2 SCC 437 : AIR 1977 SC 1222] , Smt M.M.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 112
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
Amonkar (Smt) v. S.A. Johari [(1984) 2 SCC 354] and also the observations of this Court in Harbans
Lal v. Jagmohan Saran [(1985) 4 SCC 333] .
20. It is true that in exercise of jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution the High Court
could go into the question of facts or look into the evidence if justice so requires it, if there is any
misdirection in law or a view of fact taken in the teeth of preponderance of evidence. But the High
Court should decline to exercise its jurisdiction under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution to
look into the fact in the absence of clear-cut down reasons where the question depends upon the
appreciation of evidence. The High Court also should not interfere with a finding within the
jurisdiction of the inferior tribunal except where the findings were perverse and not based on any
material evidence or it resulted in manifest injustice (see Trimbak Gangadhar Telang [(1977) 2 SCC
437 : AIR 1977 SC 1222] ). Except to the limited extent indicated above, the High Court has no
jurisdiction. In our opinion therefore, in the facts and circumstances of this case on the question
that the High Court has sought to interfere, it is manifest that the High Court has gone into
questions which depended upon appreciation of evidence and indeed the very fact that the learned
trial Judge came to one conclusion and the Appellate Bench came to another conclusion is
indication of the position that two views were possible in this case. In preferring one view to another
of factual appreciation of evidence, the High Court transgressed its limits of jurisdiction under
Article 227 of the Constitution. On the first point, therefore, the High Court was in error.
21. But the findings of the High Court on the factual aspect would not help the appellant to become a
licensee under Section 15-A of the said Act. It is to that question, therefore, attention must be given.
- 129 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR 23.14. By relying on Chandavarkar Sita Ratna Rao's case, he
submits that a Constitutional Court exercising jurisdiction under Article 227 could go into questions
of fact and look into the evidence if justice so requires it, in the present case, he submits that justice
would require this Court to consider all the facts and pass necessary orders and in this regard he
submits that the show-cause notice issued by the Forest Department in unjust, moreover, the Forest
Department has been harassing the Petitioners for the last several years and the Petitioners do not
expect to be served any justice from the Forest Department itself.

31. So far as the larger question, namely, whether subsequent events can be taken
into consideration by an appellate, revisional or writ court, we express no opinion in
view of the fact that the appeal can be decided without entering into the said
controversy.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 113
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
We may, however, note that the learned counsel for both the sides referred to leading decisions of
this Court. In some of the cases, the Court held that the crucial date for deciding requirement of a
landlord is the date of institution of suit/proceeding. In other cases, however, a contrary view has
been taken. There is thus a cleavage of opinion on that vexed issue. We leave the matter there.
32. On merits, in our judgment, the submission of the learned counsel for the appellants is well
founded that the prescribed authority was wrong in dismissing the application filed by the
landlords. We had already observed that the prescribed authority negatived the contention of the
tenant that the application was not maintainable. It, therefore, entered into the merits of the matter
and decided it against the landlords. It observed that Applicant 6 hailed from "a reputed family of
Dehradun" and "they had a very big business of timber wood". It also noted that Applicant 6 had
been enjoying the facilities of car, scooter, telephone, etc. 23.16. By relying on Shamshad Ahmad's
case he again submits that the powers of the High Courts under Article 226 and 227 are very wide
and extensive, it is for this Court to exercise such jurisdiction to render justice otherwise,
- 131 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR the powers which have been conferred on this Court would be
rendered redundant. 23.17. He relies upon the decision in Sanjay Kumar Jha vs Prakash Chandra
Chaudhary and Ors.28, more particularly para No. 13 thereof, which is reproduced hereunder for
easy reference:
13. It is well settled that in proceedings under Article 226 of the Constitution of India,
the High Court cannot sit as a court of appeal over the findings recorded by a
competent administrative authority, nor reappreciate evidence for itself to correct the
error of fact, that does not go to the root of jurisdiction. The High Court does not
ordinarily interfere with the findings of fact based on evidence and substitute its own
findings, which the High Court has done in this case. Even assuming that there had
been any error in the computation of marks in respect of fixed and movable assets,
the High Court could, at best, have remitted the case of respondent Prakash Chandra
Chaudhary to the authorities concerned for reconsideration.
23.18. By relying on Sanjay Kumar Jha's case his submission is that the High Courts
cannot function as a Court of appeal, insofar as the reappreciation of evidence is
considered when a 2019 2 SCC 499
- 132 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR fact in question is concerned; at most, it may remit such a matter to
cure evidential deficiencies, if any.
23.19. At this stage, on enquiry with the counsels if they are agreeable for a fresh joint survey in
terms of the notification 08.01.2021, though Sri.Kiran Ron, learned AAG submits that the State is
ready for such a joint survey to be carried out, Sri. Chandan submits that there is no fresh survey
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 114
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
which is required to be carried out, survey has already been carried out and a report is placed on
record which could be considered by this Court.
23.20. On further enquiry, as to whether the claim of the Petitioners is that the lands subject matter
of the present petition were the forest lands mentioned in the notification dated 08.09.2021, but
only on account of grant they were not
- 133 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR forest land or is the case of the Petitioners that the land in Sy.No.68
and 69 belonging to the Petitioners were never forest land; the submission of Sri.Chandan, learned
counsel is that the land which is owned and possessed by the Petitioners are not forest lands as per
the joint survey report and as such, there is no requirement of a fresh survey to be carried out. 23.21.
In this regard he refers to the pleadings and or applications which have been filed as also the orders
which have been passed in the earlier proceedings. By referring to the application under Order 6
Rule 17 filed by the plaintiff in OS No.1424/2006 he submits that the application for amendment
filed therein has been rejected, hence the question of any survey now to be conducted would not
arise. The said order having been challenged in WP No.23284/2023, he submits that this Court vide
- 134 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR its order dated 27.10.2023 recording the submission of the learned
AAG has dismissed the Writ Petition as not pressed. Thus, the amendment not having been pressed
into service, there is no challenge to the sale deeds executed by I.N.Mutthanna nor is there any
allegation that false documents have been created over the forest property, as such, the question of
appointment of a Commissioner would not arise.
23.22. He relies upon the IA under Order 26 Rule 9 filed in RFA No.160/2024 for conduct of a
detailed joint survey as per the boundaries mentioned in Notification dated 08.01.2021, which has
been objected to by the Petitioners herein and the said application is still pending consideration.
When such an application is pending in RFA 160/2024 he submits that this Court ought not to
appoint a Commissioner to
- 135 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR conduct a survey of the aforesaid property in terms of the
notification dated 08.1.2024.

(c) so alter the limits of the proposed State Forest as to exclude the tract over which
rights of way or water extend or to exclude forest land of sufficient extent and in a

Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR defence personnel on 17.11.1932 by Darkast No.807/3233 as
entered in the Kethwar register. The grant having been made in favour of Sri.Manik Raj, who had
not paid the due taxes, the property was brought to auction in the year 1936 with respect to survey
No.69, when the same was purchased by Sri.Subbaraya, Mudaliyaar, who subsequently sold the
property to various persons. 27.10. The grant having been made in favour of Sri.Manik Raj, the State
cannot contend otherwise by now claiming that there is no such grant. In terms of Section 20 of the
MFR 1900, the restriction in obtaining any right is only otherwise than through succession or grant
or contract in writing made on behalf of the government. In the present case, there being a grant in
favour of Mr. Manikaraj, the restriction under Section 20 would not be applicable. The
- 145 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR right obtained by Manikaraj is in accordance with the MFR 1900,
which cannot be disturbed. The grant having been made for and on behalf of the government, the
same is found mentioned in the Kethwa Register, pursuant to which taxes have been paid by
Sri.Manikaraj and thereafter by Sri.Subramanya Mudaliyar and as such, irrespective of whether a
notification has been issued under Section 17 or not, the requirement of Section 20 of the MFR 1900
being satisfied, the respondent-State cannot agitate any claim over the property. 27.11. His
submission is also that, insofar as survey No.68 is concerned, this land had been granted in favour
of Sri Muniyappa Devanahalli, which also complies with the requirement of Section 20 of the MFR
1900. A mortgage had been created on the said land, due to default in payment of the monies, the
Assistant Registrar

NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR of Co-operative Societies had initiated proceedings, conducted an
auction of the property when Smt.Sajeeda Begum, participated in the auction and was declared the
successful bidder. As such, his submission in respect of survey No.68 is that the lands initially
granted in favour of Muniyappa Devanahalli were later on auctioned by a government officer, which
also stands the test of section 20 of MFR 1900, and no claim can be made by the State in relation
thereto. 27.12. As regards the proceedings which have been initiated on Section 64 of the FCA 1980,
he submits that those proceedings could be initiated only as regards a reserved forest, district forest,
village forest, or protected forest, if found to be unauthorisedly occupied by any person. Contending
that the requirement of Section 20 has been satisfied,

NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR his submission is that once the grant has been made, the land will
no longer be forest land but would be private land belonging to the grantee and as such Section 64A
would not be applicable. It is on that basis a submission is made that if a grant of land is made under
Section 20, the said land cannot be subjected to a proceedings under Section 64A. 27.13. Reliance
has been placed on the decision in B.S. Sandhu's case to contend that the word 'forest' must be
understood according to dictionary meaning and for the same to be so done, the particular land is
required to be recorded as forest land in government records. 27.14. In the present case, survey
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 120
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
Nos.68 and 69 not being shown as forest land or government land in the revenue records, the
government cannot make any claim to initiate proceedings under Section 64.
- 148 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR 27.15. By relying on Anand Arya's case, it has been contended that
the contents of the revenue records have to be looked into and when the revenue records do not
indicate the land to be shown as forest land, the claim of the State that it is forest land is
unsustainable. 27.16. Reliance is placed on Elizabeth Jacob's case to contend that when a common
man on the basis of the government documents is led to believe that the land is not forest land, the
notification even if issued under Section 17 of the MFR 1900 would not be applicable thereto,
entitling the Respondent-State from invoking the powers under Section 64A of the KFA. 27.17. Per
Contra, the submission of Sri.Kiran Ron, learned Additional Advocate General is that, the
notification issued on 8.01.1921 refers to Survey Nos.66 and 67 of Chikkasane and
- 149 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR survey No. 14 of Bhuvanahalli, these survey numbers underwent a
change with survey No.66 being renumbered as survey No.68 and survey No.67 being renumbered
as survey No.69 and survey No.14 being renumbered as survey No.30 and as such, it is both the old
numbers and the new numbers which are to be taken into consideration together. His submission is
that the notification being in respect of old survey Nos.66 and 67, new survey No.68 and 69, it is
those survey numbers which will be covered under the Section 17 notification.
27.18. The reference made by the petitioners to survey Nos.68 and 69 are as regard the old survey
Nos.68 and 69 and not new survey Nos.68 and 69, therefore by referring to lands in old survey
Nos.68 and 69, the petitioners are seeking to
- 150 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR which is impermissible since new survey No.68 was earlier survey
No.66 and new survey No.69 was earlier survey No.67 which were declared to be Bhuvanahalli State
forest vide notification dated 8.01.1921. On that basis, he submits that there is a very basic issue as
regards the identity of the property. There is no grant of land made in old survey Nos.66 and 67.
27.19. His submission is that it is not the survey number which is required to be considered, but it is
the identification and boundaries of the property which are required to be considered. 27.20. In this
regard, by relying on various judgments cited supra, namely Narasimha Sastry's case, Sheodhyan
Singh's case, Y. Subbarao's case and Mallaiah's case that it is the boundaries which would prevail
over the measurement or, the identification of a land by
- 151 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR way of survey number or the like and as such in so far as the
boundaries forming part of the notification in Section 17 of the MFR 1900, the said notification in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 121
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
Section 17 would operate perpetually.
27.21. Alternatively, by relying on Nirvana Gowda's case, he submits that when a land is included as
a reserved forest, the revenue records and the contents thereof are irrelevant. Issuance of saguvali
chits and/or the like would not confer any title on the said land. Once the land is declared to be
forest land, the revenue authorities have no power to deal with the forest land and by relying on
Section 30 of MFR 1900, he submits that until and unless a notification is issued categorically
stating that a land ceases to be a State forest or a portion of a State forest, the land would continue
to be a State forest.
- 152 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR 27.22. His submission is also that the notification dated 8.01.1921
not having been challenged, the same continuing to be in force, the Petitioners cannot allege
contrary to the said notification and in this regard, he relies upon the decision in Brijesh Reddy and
Surjan Singh. On that basis he submits that a land once reserved as a forest or reserved forest
cannot be de-reserved without a notification having been issued under section 30 in that regard.
27.23. It is in the background of the above submission that the above point framed would have to be
considered and answered. The relevant provisions have been extracted hereinabove, as also the
submissions made by both the Counsels.
- 153 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR 27.24. What has been challenged is only a Show Cause notice and
this court would have normally relegated the petitioners to reply to the show cause notice, however,
there being an insistence on part of the counsel for Petitioners that all issues have to be considered
by this court and the petitioners having submitted to the jurisdiction of this court for such
consideration that the same have been taken up for consideration.
27.25. There is substance in the submission of Learned Additional Advocate General Sri. Kiran
Rhon, learned counsel appearing for the State, Section 20 cannot be considered to be an exception
to Section 17 of the MFR 1900 in all circumstances. Section 20 is reproduced hereunder for easy
reference:
20. No right of any description shall be acquired in or over a State Forest, except by
succession or under grant or contract in writing made by or on behalf of the
Government or of some person in whom such right or the
- 154 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR power to create such right was vested when the notification under
section 17 was published. 27.26. Section 20 would indicate that no right of any description be
acquired in or over a state forest except by succession or under a grant or contract in writing, made
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 122
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
by or on behalf of the government or of some person in whom such right or the power to create such
right was vested when the notification under Section 17 was published. For Section 20 to be
applicable it is required that a grant or contract in writing is made by or on behalf of the
Government or of some person in whom such right or the power to create such right was vested
when the notification under section 17 was published, i.e., to say the time period for consideration of
such grant is at the time when the section 17 notification was issued and not subsequently.
- 155 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR 27.27. Section 17 provides for the land declared as forest to be
deemed as a State forest, and Section 20 provides an exception for a private person to acquire the
land declared to be a State forest, subject to the conditions being satisfied. By an ex facie reading of
Section 20, it is clear that though Section 17 is one which will operate in perpetuity but is however
subject to the rights exercised by the State under Section 20, those conditions are required to be
satisfied for Section 20 to be made applicable.
27.28. Section 20 is worded in the negative, categorically indicating that "no right of any description
shall be acquired" in or over a State Forest and qualifies the same by exceptions namely (i) by
succession or (ii) under grant or contract in writing made by or on behalf of the Government or of
some person in whom such
- 156 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR right or the power to create such right was vested when the
notification under section 17 was published. The Petitioners seek to rely not on the general law but
on the exception, hence it is required for the petitioners to satisfy the requirement/s of the
exception/s. 27.29. In so far as the First Exception is concerned, if a person had a right over the
forest land, which had not been considered before the issuance of the Section 17 notification, such
rights could be passed on by way of succession, which the person claiming to have acquired would
have to prove, be that as it may, this aspect is not being considered in detail in the present case since
no claim has been made under this exception.
27.30. As regards the second exception, a right over forest land can be acquired under a grant or
- 157 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR contract in writing made by or on behalf of the Government or of
some person in whom such right or the power to create such right was vested when the notification
under section 17 was published. Thus, the grant or contract has to be firstly in writing and secondly
made by or on behalf of the Government and cannot be by way of any agreement with a private
party. 27.31. Insofar as survey No.69 is concerned, by relying on the Khetwar register, it is sought to
be contended that the said land has been granted in favour of Sri. Manik Raj on 17.11.1932, who was
a defence personnel in terms of dharkast No.807/32-33 as entered in the Khetwa register, which has
been placed on record. Thus, what has been placed on record is only the Khetwar register to indicate
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 123
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
the alleged acquisition of title by Sri. Manikaraj was by way of a grant/dharkast made in the year
- 158 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR 1932. The dharkast No.807/32-33 is not placed on record, and there
are no other documents other than the Khetwar register placed on record. Thus, the Khetwar
register cannot be regarded as establishing the grant by or on behalf of the Government. The report
of the Thasildar indicates that there is no such grant made and despite a search having been made
no documents have been traced in that regards, thus categorically establishing that there is no such
grant, the petitioners themselves have not placed on record any such grant order.
27.32. The alleged grant/ Dharkast is admittedly subsequent to the notification issued under Section
17, which was issued on 8.1.1921. It has not been established that the grant is in accordance with
law, the subsequent event of the said Sri. Manik Raj not having made
- 159 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR payment of the land revenue in relation to the said land, which had
been granted to him, the said land was brought for auction in the year 1936, and in the said auction,
Sri. Subbaraya Mudilyar is stated to have purchased the said property, is a private transaction and
not one which can be said to be a grant in terms of Section 20. The auction having been conducted
on account off non-payment of land revenue, Sri. Subbaraya Mudaliyar being successful in the said
auction, a sale deed is stated to have been executed in favour of Sri.Subbaraya Mudaliyar, which
would not satisfy the requirement of Section 20, since the acquisition of title by Sri. Subbaraya
Mudaliyar is under contract, in writing, in furtherance of an auction and not a grant made by the
government, or on behalf of the government. Subsequent thereto, there have been various private
sales in respect
- 160 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR of survey No.69, which would not satisfy the strict requirement of
Section 20. Section 20 being an exception it is required that the same is strictly construed and no
liberal interpretation can be given to the same as contended by Shri K. Chandan.
27.33. Insofar as survey No.68 is concerned, the said land had been allegedly granted to Sri.
Muniyappa Devanahalli in the year 1945, again, no document of grant has been placed on record.
Sri. Muniyappa of Devanalli had borrowed money by mortgaging the property. A dispute had been
initiated under the Karnataka Co-operative Societies Act. The Assistant Registrar Co-operative
Societies had bought the property for auction, where the same was purchased by Smt. Sajeeda
Begum. insofar as the grant is concerned in favour of Sri. Muniyappa Devanahalli, the same would

Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR would not satisfy the requirement of Section 20 of the MFR 1900,
insofar as the sale in favour of Smt.Sajeeda Begum is concerned, it is on account of the mortgage
dues that the property, which was mortgaged as security for a private loan, was brought for sale and
the sale, though having been conducted by an officer of the government, and a sale deed came to be
executed in favour of Smt.Sajeeda Begum, the transaction was essentially a private transaction and
would not satisfy the strict requirement of a Grant under section 20 of the Act. Thus, even insofar as
the land in survey No.68 is concerned, the manner of acquisition of title would not satisfy the
requirement of Section 20, which is an exception to Section 17, as indicated supra. 27.34. As regards
the aspect of boundaries prevailing over the measurements and the confusion
- 162 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR regarding survey numbers, many arguments have been advanced on
this aspect. The submission of the counsel for the petitioners is on the basis of the Survey Number
and not as per the boundaries in the notification of the year 1921.
27.35. On enquiry with the counsels if they are agreeable for a fresh joint survey in terms of the
notification 08.01.2021, though Sri.Kiran Ron, learned AAG submits that the State is ready for
another such joint survey to be carried out, Sri. Chandan submits that there is no fresh survey which
needs to be carried out; a survey has already been carried out, and a report has been placed on
record, which could be considered by this Court.
27.36. On further enquiry, as to whether the claim of the Petitioners is that the lands subject matter
- 163 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR of the present petition were the forest lands mentioned in the
notification dated 08.09.2021, but only on account of grant they were not forest land or is the case
of the Petitioners that the land in Sy.No.68 and 69 belonging to the Petitioners were never forest
land; the submission of Sri.Chandan, learned counsel, is that the land which is owned and possessed
by the Petitioners is not forest land as per the joint survey report, and as such, there is no
requirement of a fresh survey to be carried out. In that background, it would be required to be
considered if the Survey report can be accepted as is.
27.37. A joint survey was conducted on 28.01.2015 and 29.01.2015 by the Tahsildar Bhuvanahalli, in
pursuance of the Order Dated 13.06.2012 in Criminal Petition No. 1852-1857 of 2012. The old
survey No. 66 of Chikkasane village has
- 164 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR now been renumbered as survey No. 68, Survey No. 67 of
Chikkasane village is now renumbered as survey No. 69.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 125
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
27.38. The Tahsildar has submitted a survey report in respect of old survey No. 66 and old survey
No. 67, and not with reference to new survey No. 68 and 69 is the contention of Shri Kiran Rohn,
and in that backround the survey report was not accepted and fresh survey was directed to be
conducted since the survey was not conducted in accordance with the Gazette notification dated
08.01.1921. 27.39. Thereafter, the Technical Assistant and Deputy Director of Land Records,
Bangalore Rural District, were directed by the Tahsildar, Devanahalli Taluk to conduct a joint
survey, according to the notification dated 08.01.1921, vide their correspondence dated 21.04.2017.
- 165 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR 27.40. On 10.07.2017, the ADLR, Devanahalli Taluk, issued a notice
to attend the joint survey to be conducted on 25.07.2017. Though Petitioner No.1 received the
notice, the other Petitioners refused to receive the notice. A survey was conducted in the presence of
Petitioner No. 3- Sri. M. A. Mohammad Amanullah, who refused to sign the Mahazar, which is
apparent from the report of the Assistant Conservator of Forests dated 16.09.2017 addressed to the
Deputy Conservator of Forests. The new Survey report it is claimed indicates that the land of the
petitioners comes within the boundaries of the notification dated 08.01.1921 and as held in
Narasimha Sastry's case, Sheodhyan Singh's case, Y. Subbarao's case and Mallaiah's case
irrespective of the change in Survey numbers, if the land falls within the
- 166 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR boundaries of the notification of 1921, it would be a forest land.
27.41. Irrespective of the numbering of the survey numbers, what is required to be considered is the
boundaries of the notification of 1921; if the land claimed by the Petitioners comes within the
boundaries of the forest land, action has to be taken which cannot be faulted with. 27.42. Liberty
having been reserved by this Court in an order dated 13.06.2012 in criminal petition No. 1852 to
1857 of 2012, the first survey was conducted of the Survey numbers and not as per the notification of
the year 1921, as such a fresh survey has been conducted as per the notification of the year 1921 and
proceeded therefrom in the very same proceedings, namely FOC No.7, 8, 9, 13 and 14 of 2006-07. A
survey has now been conducted in terms of
- 167 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR the notification dated 08-01-1921, encroachment having been
found, the authorities are well within their rights to initiate proceedings.
27.43. Hence I answer point No.1 by holding that once a notification has been issued under Section
17 of the MFR 1900 notifying a particular land as a forest land, the said notification would apply in
respect of the said land in perpetuity, subject to denotification in terms of Section 30 and or the
exceptions detailed under Section 20, which would have to be strictly established by the person/s
claiming such benefit of the exception/s.

28. ANSWER TO POINT No.2: Whether the present Writ Petition is maintainable on account of the
same, requiring this Court to consider a disputed question of fact?
- 168 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR 28.1. Much has been sought to be made out by Sri.Kiran Ron,
learned Additional Advocate General, that the present writ petition is not maintainable since the
same relates to the consideration of disputed questions of fact and in this regard, reliance has been
placed by him on the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Kunishetty Satyanarayana's case to
contend that firstly, the disputed questions of fact. Secondly, that what has been challenged is only a
show cause notice under Section 64, which is required to be replied to by the petitioners. 28.2. Per
contra, Sri.K.Chandan., learned counsel appearing for the petitioners relied on Anand Arya's case to
contend that when land has never been shown as forest land and those lands have been granted by
the government, the land loses the character of a forest land and even if it was a forest land and as
such, no
- 169 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR notice under Section 64A could be issued. Reliance has also been
placed on Elizabeth Jacobs' case to contend that when the official document itself indicated that the
property was not government land, private rights in respect thereto could not be granted.
28.3. By relying on Godrej and Boyce case, it has been submitted that when citizens acted for several
decades on the basis of what has been held out by State, the State cannot belatedly take action
contrary thereto. These, he submits, are points of law which are required to be considered. It is not
disputed questions of fact which would be considered by this Court. Even as regards that aspect, by
relying on Chandavarkar Sita Ratna Rao's case, his submission is that a constitutional Court
exercising jurisdiction under Article 227 could go into the question of facts on the basis of a
- 170 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR question of law to render justice where so required. The petitioners,
having been harassed by the respondent-State, this Court ought to come to the rescue of the
petitioners. 28.4. Reliance has been placed on the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Shamshad
Ahmad's case, indicating that the powers of the High Court under Article 226 and 227 are very wide
and extensive, and this Court can exercise such writ jurisdiction to render justice as may be
required. On that basis he submits that in law, the action taken by the respondent being illegal, the
enquiry to be conducted by this Court limited to whether there was a grant made under Section 20
bringing out the exception under Section 20 to the notification of Section 17 thereby confirming
right on the grantee and his successors, his submission is that this Court ought to excise its powers
under
- 171 -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 127
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR Article 226 and 227, in the background of the above submission that
the above point is required to be answered.
28.5. Normally, though this Court has wide powers under Articles 226 and 227, which cannot be
fettered by any particular provision of law, this Court would refrain from entering into a deep
enquiry as regards disputed questions of facts and leave the same to be decided by a Court/authority
exercising appropriate jurisdiction.
28.6. A Judge of the High Court functions in various capacities depending on the roster allocated by
the Hon'ble Chief Justice as the Master of Rolls. It is not that a Judge of the High Court cannot
enquire into a disputed question of fact, which is normally done in the case of a first appeal, where
the entire evidence is re-appreciated,
- 172 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR thereby requiring an enquiry into all the facts relating thereto. In a
second appeal, a Judge of the High Court would restrain himself to consider the point of law, which
is termed as a substantial question of law to be determined. In exercise of powers in different rosters
like a writ petition under Article 227, a Judge of the High Court would exercise supervisory powers
to ascertain if the orders passed by the trial Court are proper and correct. While exercising revision
jurisdiction, a Judge of the High Court would consider if there is an error of jurisdiction or an error
in the exercise of powers, and so on and so forth.
28.7. Insofar as the writ petition is concerned, the same being as summary proceedings whereunder
the reliefs in the nature of issuance of writ is sought for, a Judge of the High Court exercising
summary jurisdiction would normally
- 173 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR refrain from enquiring into disputed questions of facts unless they
are ex facie evident. 28.8. Thus, the restriction imposed is a self-induced restriction and not a
restriction on the basis of the Judge not having the power or ability to do so. This restriction is also
self-imposed to protect the interest of the parties, inasmuch as if there are disputed questions of
fact, the parties are required to be provided an opportunity of adducing evidence, placing the
documents on record and also permitting them to cross-examine each other to ascertain the veracity
thereof so as to arrive at the truth in the matter.
28.9. Insofar as the present case is concerned, essentially what has been contended is that a grant
made in favour of the petitioners is one which would constitute an exception under
- 174 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR Section 20 of the MFR 1900 and as such is an exception to the
restriction imposed by a notification under Section 17 of MFR 1900. 28.10. Ex facie what has been
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 128
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
placed on record is the khetwa register on which basis it is alleged that there is a grant made in
respect of land in survey No.69 in favour of Sri.Manik Raj, way back in the year 1932, and of the
subsequent auction of the said property in the year 1936. However, no order of grant has been
placed on record.
28.11. Similar, is the case as regards survey No.68, which is alleged to be granted to Sri. Muniyappa
Devanahalli in the year 1945, again, no document of grant has been placed on record.
28.12. The actual grant orders in writing made by or on behalf of the Government have not been
- 175 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR placed on record, more so when the location of the property has
been ascertained to be located within the boundaries of the notification of the year 1921. The report
of the Thasildhar indicates that there is no such order of grant available in respect of both the above
survey numbers.
28.13. Once the land is within the boundaries of the notification as held by the Hon'ble Apex Court
in the celebrated judgment in Godavarman's case, in which case, on account of continuous
mandamuses which have been issued and the constant monitoring by the Hon'ble Apex Court, has
resulted in saving of numerous forests and removal of encroachments, all encroachers in a forest
area being required to be evicted. 28.14. A show-cause notice under Section 64-A is issued only with
a view to enable the person to whom the notice is issued to show that his land
- 176 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR does not fall within the boundaries of the forest as drawn up by the
Survey of India and as contained in the notification issued in regard thereto, in the present case the
notification of the year 1921. If the land is identified as falling within the Survey of India boundary
and/or the notification, then there could be no other defence open to the person concerned, namely
the encroacher, and the State would be under an obligation and duty to evict the encroacher, by
force if necessary. The facts being ex-facie clear that, as per the second survey carried out, the
subject land is within the forest boundaries, the Petitioners or anyone claiming through or under
them cannot have any defence.
28.15. These aspects being explicitly clear from the documents on record, I am of the considered
opinion that there is no in-depth enquiry which
- 177 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR is required to be conducted by this Court to ascertain if there are
any exfacie rights vested with the petitioners.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 129
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
28.16. Thus, I answer point No.2 by holding that, insofar as the present case is concerned, as regards
the challenge to the notice under section 64A, firstly, they do not involve any disputed question of
fact requiring in-depth enquiry. Secondly, the survey report indicating that the subject property lies
within the boundaries of the forest notified in the year 1921, the petitioners have no defence to any
eviction order to be passed against them, however they have to be given an opportunity to place any
mitigating circumstances on record for the purpose of consideration of the time to be granted for
such eviction.

29. ANSWER TO POINT NO.3. Whether the respondents could have issued a fresh show cause
notice in F.O.C. No.7/2006-07, F.O.C. No.8/2006-07, F.O.C. No.9/2006-07, F.O.C. No.13/2006-07
and F.O.C. No.14/2006-07 after the said proceedings have been quashed in Crl.P.1852-57 OF 2012?
29.1. The submission of Sri K. Chandan, learned counsel for the petitioners, is that a similar notice
under Section 64 was issued earlier in the year 2006-07, and in furtherance thereof, criminal FOC
Nos. 7, 8, 9, 13, and 14 of 2006- 07 were registered. Challenging the same, the petitioners had filed
criminal petitions under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in Criminal Petition No.
1852 to 1857 of 2012 and this court, vide order dated 13.06.2012 had quashed those proceedings,
reserving liberty to the Forest Department to conduct a survey. The said orders having attained
finality, the FOC proceedings having been quashed, the question of issuance of one more set of
notices

as done now in the very same FOC
proceedings, albeit after a unilateral survey carried out by the Forest Department, is untenable.
29.2. The submission of Sri.Kiran Ron, Additional Advocate General, notes that although the
proceedings were quashed, liberty was reserved to the Forest Department to conduct a survey. A
survey having been carried out by the Forest Department, where encroachment was found,
proceedings have been continued in the said FOC matters. As such, he submits that the continuation
of the said proceedings is proper and correct and no fault was committed. 29.3. Having heard the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 130
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
arguments of both the counsels and having perused the papers, there is no dispute as regards the
earlier proceedings having been initiated in the year 2006-07 and
- 180 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR the same having been quashed. The allegations made in those
proceedings are the very same allegations which are made in the present proceedings. The orders
passed in criminal petition No.1852 to 1857 of 2012 are categorical inasmuch as those FOC
proceedings initiated in the year 2006-07 have been quashed only on the ground that there was no
survey conducted and in that background liberty was reserved to the forest department to carry out
a survey in the presence of the petitioners to ascertain if there was any encroachment. In
furtherance thereof, a survey has been carried out in the presence of the petitioners as regards the
aforesaid survey numbers and a categorical remark made in the said survey by the surveyor that
there is no encroachment by the petitioners of any forest land.
- 181 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR 29.4. Liberty having been reserved by this Court in an order dated
13.06.2012 in criminal petition No. 1852 to 1857 of 2012, the first survey which was conducted of the
Survey numbers not being as per the notification of the year 1921, as such a fresh survey has been
conducted as per the notification of the year 1921 and proceeded therefrom in the very same
proceedings, namely FOC 7. The quashing of FOC No.7, 8, 9, 13 and 14 of 2006-07 was only with
reference to the joint survey not having been conducted and liberty having been reserved to conduct
such a survey. A survey has now been conducted in terms of the notification dated 08-01-1921,
encroachment having been found, the authorities are well within their rights to initiate proceedings.
29.5. The subsequent survey, in my considered opinion, is not a unilateral survey conducted by
- 182 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR the forest department. On 10.07.2017, the ADLR, Devanahalli
Taluk, issued a notice to the Petitioners to attend the joint survey to be conducted on 25.07.2017.
Though Petitioner No.1 received the notice, the other Petitioners refused to receive the notice. A
survey was conducted in the presence of Petitioner No. 3- Sri. M. A. Mohammad Amanullah, who
refused to sign the Mahazar, which is apparent from the report of the Assistant Conservator of
Forests dated 16.09.2017 addressed to the Deputy Conservator of Forests. The new Survey report
indicates that the land of the petitioners comes within the boundaries of the notification dated
08.01.1921.
29.6. As indicated supra, the orders passed in Crl.Petitions No.1852 to 1857 of 2012 are categorical.
The entire order thereof is reproduced hereunder for easy reference:

Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR ORDER Learned Government Pleader has filed
statement of objections.
2. In these petitions, petitioners have sought for quashing of the proceedings in FOC
Nos.7/06-07, 8/06-
07, 9/06-07, 13/06-07, 14/06-07 pending on the file of CJ (Jr. Dn.) and JMFC, Devanahalli.
3. The allegation in the complaint is that, the petitioners have encroached upon the forest land and
accordingly case was registered in FOC Nos.7/06-07, 8/06-07, 9/06- 07, 13/06-07, 14/06-07 for the
offences punishable under Sections 24(g), (gg), 73(d) of Karnataka Forest Act and Rule 41 of Rules
made there under and Section 41(2) of Karnataka Conservative of Forest Act and Section 2 of
Central Forest Protection Act. As against the registration of the cases, the petitioners are before this
court.
4. The facts, which are not in dispute are that, in the year 1936 itself it appears that public auction
conducted in court proceedings for non payment of the revenue. In the court proceedings, one
Subbaraya Mudaliyar purchased the properties. Thereafter, these petitioners each have purchased
portion of the properties in 1977. It is also not in dispute that, the Forest and State had filed a suit
against one of the purchasers in O.S.No.1424/2006 seeking declaration that the land in possession
of the said properties, land encroached upon by the petitioners. It is also not in dispute that the said
suit has been dismissed.
5. If, really the forest department finds that there is any encroachment which the petitioners or their
predecessor were in possession for more than half century, it is open to the forest department to
conduct survey of the land in the presence of the occupier/owner/purchaser of the said property and
based on the survey, if they find there
- 184 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR is any encroachment they can proceed against the occupier in
accordance with law.
6. Further, considering that the even before the purchase of the properties by the petitioners, the
title deeds were in the name of the vendor, these petitioners have been in possession for over
complaint ought not have been filed without proper verification. Hence, I find complaints filed by
the forest authority are perverse and liable to be quashed.
Accordingly, these petitions are allowed. Proceedings in FOC Nos.7/06-07, 8/06-07, 9/06-07,
13/06-07, 14/06- 07 pending on the file of CJ (Jr. Dn.) and JMFC, Devanahalli stand quashed.
Liberty is reserved to the Forest Department, if there is any encroachment, it may conduct the
survey and proceed with the matter in accordance with law. 29.7. Though the FOC proceedings
initiated in furtherance of the notices issued under section 64A of the FC Act had been quashed, the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 132
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
said proceedings did not come to an end. Liberty was reserved to the Forest Department, if there is
any encroachment, it may conduct the survey and proceed with the matter in accordance with law.
- 185 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR 29.8. If a survey were to be carried out and encroachment found,
matter could be proceeded with in accordance with law, it is in view thereof that fresh notices under
Section 64A would be required to be issued and have been so issued, the petitioner would be heard
on the same, which is what has been done. The petitioners will be given an opportunity to reply to
the same, and thereafter, action to be taken. 29.9. In the present matter, a joint survey was
conducted on 28.01.2015 and 29.01.2015 by the Tahsildar Bhuvanahalli, in pursuance of the Order
dated 13.06.2012 in Criminal Petition No. 1852-1857 of 2012. The old survey No. 66 of Chikkasane
village has now been renumbered as survey No. 68, Survey No. 67 of Chikkasane village is now
renumbered as survey No. 69.
- 186 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR 29.10. The Tahsildar has submitted a survey report in respect of old
survey No. 66 and old survey No. 67, and not with reference to new survey No. 68 and 69, it is in
that backround that the survey report was not accepted and fresh survey was directed to be
conducted since the survey was not conducted in accordance with the Gazette notification dated
08.01.1921. 29.11. Liberty having been reserved by this Court in an order dated 13.06.2012 in
criminal petition No. 1852 to 1857 of 2012, the first survey which was conducted of the Survey
numbers and not as per the notification of the year 1921, as such a fresh survey has been conducted
as per the notification of the year 1921 and proceeded therefrom in the very same proceedings,
namely FOC No.7, 8, 9, 13 and 14 of 2006-07. The proceedings were quashed only with reference to
the joint survey not having been
- 187 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR conducted and liberty having been reserved to conduct such a
survey. A survey has now been conducted in terms of the notification dated 08- 01-1921,
encroachment having been found, the authorities are well within their rights to initiate proceedings.
29.12. I answer point No.3 by holding that the Respondents have rightly issued fresh show cause
notices dated 13.11.2020 in FOC No.7, 8, 9, 13 and 14 of 2006-07.
30. ANSWER TO POINT No.4: Whether the first survey carried out in pursuance of the orders in
Crl.Petitions No.1852-57 of 2012, indicating that there is no encroachment of forest land, would
enure to the benefit of the Petitioners requiring the Writ Petitions to be allowed? 30.1. Some of the
contentions relating to this point have been considered in answer to point No.3 above. Suffice it to
say that in the first survey, which had been carried out, the petitioners had
- 188 -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 133
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR participated, and in the second survey, which had been carried out,
the petitioners had chosen not to participate, as indicated supra. 30.2. In my considered opinion,
the Petitioners cannot choose not to participate when it had been pointed out that there was an
error in the earlier survey on account of the earlier survey having been done of the Survey Numbers
and not as per the boundaries of the notification of the year 1921. The First Survey, which had been
carried out, was contrary to the orders passed by this court; it would be for the Principal Chief
Conservator of Forests and the Principal Secretary, Revenue Department to ascertain if there was
any mischief in the carrying out of such a survey with reference to the survey numbers rather than
the boundaries of the notification of the year 1921 and take necessary action against the errant
officials.
- 189 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR 30.3. Respondent-Forest Department was well within its authority
to conduct a fresh survey when such an error was found, more so, when in furtherance of the orders
passed in Criminal Petition No.1852 to 1857 of 2012, the Forest Department was granted liberty to
carry out a survey of the land as per the notification of the year 1921, in the presence of the
petitioners. The liberty which has been granted by this court in its order passed in criminal petition
No.1852 to 1857 of 2012 did not come to an end once the first survey was carried out. When the
aforestated error was found, it was required for any responsible officer of the Forest Department,
who is obliged and duty-bound to protect all forest lands, to conduct a fresh survey as per the
notification of the year 1921. It is if the survey report of the survey numbers were to be accepted by
the forest department
- 190 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR that the officers could have been said to have abdicated their duties.
An action taken to protect forest land cannot be said to be outside the powers of the Officials of the
Forest Department, the same being to correct the mistake committed by the surveyor carrying out
the survey activity without reference to change in the survey numbers and or the boundaries of the
notification of the year 1921. 30.4. As such I answer point number 4 by holding that when a survey
was carried out in pursuance of the orders in criminal petition No. 1852 to 1857 of 2012 indicating
that there is no encroachment of forest land, the same would not enure to the benefit of the
petitioners if the survey was not properly carried out. A subsequent survey after the issuance of
notice to the petitioners carried out as per
- 191 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR the boundaries of the notification of the year 1921 is perfectly valid
and binding on the petitioners, more so when they chose not to particiapate in the said arrvey, the
Petitioners or anyone claiming through or under them cannot seek to take advantage of their own
wrongs by not participating in the survey despite notice having been issued in that regard.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 134
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
31. ANSWER TO POINT No.5: Whether the filing of the civil suit by the Forest Department and the
orders passed therein would disentitle the Forest Department from initiating proceedings under
Section 64A of the Karnataka Forest Act, 1963? 31.1. The submission of Sri Chandan, learned
counsel for the petitioners, is that a suit having been filed by the Forest Department, the Forest
Department failed in the same, and the matter is now pending before the first appellate court,
- 192 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR proceeding under section 64A of the KFA, 1963 could not have been
initiated.
31.2. Per contra, the submission of Kiran Ron, learned the Additional Advocate General, is that the
proceedings in OS No.1424 of 2006 were not required to be initiated. They have been so initiated on
ill-advise. The jurisdiction of the Civil Court is excluded insofar as Forest lands are concerned. A
survey has been conducted on 28-01-2015 and 29-01-2015 in pursuance of the Order dated
13.06.2012, passed in Criminal Petition No.1852-1857 of 2012, the Assistant Conservator of Forest
having received the said survey report on 12.06.2015 being of the opinion that the said survey was
not conducted in accordance with the gazette notification dated 8-01-1921, had requested the Range
Forest Officer, the Assistant Conservator Forest and the Deputy Conservator of Forest for a
- 193 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR fresh survey in terms of the notification dated 8.01.1921. Thereafter
on 10-07-2017, notice was issued by the ADLR to the petitioners for conducting a joint survey on
25-07-2017, the petitioners refused to receive the notice and as such, a survey was carried out.
Though petitioner No. 3 was present at the time of the survey, he refused to sign the mahazar. It is
in furtherance of the same that the survey report has been submitted by the Assistant Conservator of
Forest on 16-09-2017 to the Deputy Conservator of Forest. Thus, he submits that this is a survey
which has not been carried out unilaterally by the Forest Department but through the ADLR and the
officials of the respondent. Notice having been issued to the petitioners, the petitioners had not
participated in the said survey. It is on that basis that notices had been issued under section 64A on
- 194 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR account of encroachment being found during the course of the said
survey.
31.3. His submission, therefore, is that irrespective of a civil suit having been filed by the Forest
Department, the statutory remedies available to the Forest Department could have been and have in
fact been invoked. It is in the background of the aforesaid submission that this issue would have to
be answered. 31.4. Though it is not in dispute that a civil suit in OS No.1424/2006 has been filed by
the Forest Department, the said suit is only in respect of a portion of the subject property. The title,
as observed supra, in that suit and in the present proceedings can be traced to either the grant made
in the year 1932 in respect of survey number 69 or the grant made in respect of survey number 68
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 135
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
made in the year 1945.
- 195 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR 31.5. Irrespective of the title to the property what would have to be
looked into in these kind of matters relating the Forest lands, is whether the land claimed by a
private party like the petitioners comes within the boundaries of the Forest notification, if it does,
then it would be a forest land, and the Petitioners or anyone claiming through or under them would
not have any defence from being evicted in order to clear the encroachment over forest land. 31.6.
The filing of the suit, though only reflects the ineptitude on part of the forest officials who had then
filed the suit, would not deprive the forest department from exercising its powers in accordance with
law. It would, however, be for the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests to take such action as may
be permissible, in accordance with law, against such delinquent
- 196 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR officials, who had, instead of taking up proceedings by exercising
powers in accordance with the applicable law, filed a suit and subsequently an Appeal which is still
pending. 31.7. As such, I answer point number 5 by holding that proceeding under Section 64A of
the Karnataka Forest Act 1963 can be initiated and continued irrespective of the Forest Department
having filed a civil suit relating to the title of the property, since what is required to be decided is
whether the property falls within the boundaries of the notification of the year 2021.
32. ANSWER TO POINT No.6: Can the government after notifying a land to be forest land under
Mysore Forest Regulations 1990 vide notification 08.01.2021 grant any land to defence personnel or
otherwise and what is the effect thereof?
32.1. The submission of Sri. K.Chandan, learned counsel for the petitioners, is that even if the
- 197 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR land had been notified as a forest land vide notification date
8.01.1921, the land in survey number 69 had been granted to Sri.Manik Raj, a defence personnel in
the year 1932 and the land in survey no. 68 was granted to Muniyappa Devanahalli in the year 1945.
It is in that background that Section 20 of the KFR 1900 has been brought into service to contend
that the grantees Manik Raj and Muniyappa Devanahalli acquired ownership rights in terms of the
grant, and there is no prohibition in terms of Section 20 in relation thereto. 32.2. Reliance is also
placed on Rule 99 of the Mysore Land Revenue Rules and Section 187 of the Mysore Land Revenue
Code, which have been reproduced hereinabove. On that basis, it is contended that if a sale has been
executed by an officer of the State representing the State, more particularly when the auction has
been
- 198 -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 136
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR conducted, on confirmation of the sale, the purchaser is required to
be put in possession by the State and a certificate of purchase is required to be issued.
32.3. Reference is also made to Section 24G, 24GG, 24H, 73D of the KFA 1963 and Rule 41(2) of the
KFR 1969 and Section 2(2) of the FCA 1980, on which basis it is submitted that it is only after the
FCA 1980 came into force that the restriction in respect of forest land came to be introduced and
therefore the grant made in the year 1932 and 1945 would be outside the mischief of the FCA 1980.
32.4. Per contra, the submission of Sri.Kiran Ron, learned Additional Advocate General is that once
a land has been declared as forest land, it will continue to forest land and by relying on the decision
of the Hob'ble Apex Court in
- 199 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR Godaverman's case, his submission is that no defence is available to
any person who is found to be in occupation of forest land once the said land is admitted/found to
be forest land. It is in the background of the aforesaid submission that this issue would have to be
answered. 32.5. There cannot be any dispute as regards 24G, which provides that clearance of any
land for cultivation is prohibited in forest land. 24GG, which prohibits the occupation of forest land
for any purpose. Section 24H, prohibits damaging, altering or removing any cairn, wall, ditch,
embankment, fence, hedge, or railing in forest land, etc. There can be no dispute as regards Section
73D, which provides for a penalty for any person altering, destroying or defacing any boundary
mark of forest land. All these provisions would be attracted in the present case since, as admitted by
the Petitioners
- 200 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR themselves, they have formed a layout and are selling the same to
third parties, some of whom are putting up construction of houses on those plots. Once the land has
been found to be within the boundaries of the notification of the year 1921, none of these actions
could have been undertaken by the petitioners or anyone claiming through or under them. The
petitioners took this risk knowing fully well that the Forest Department had laid a claim over this
land, in fact the first suit was filed by one of the petitioners contending that there is interference
with his possession by the Forest Department, Petitioner No. 2-Mohammad Sanaullah, had filed a
suit in O.S. No. 600/1981 seeking a permanent injunction against the Forest Department,
restraining the Forest Department from interfering with the peaceful possession of Petitioner No.2
in Survey No. 69/2. The said
- 201 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR suit came to be dismissed on 13.12.1985 with costs.
32.6. Section 2(2) of the Forest Conservation Act which came into effect from the year 1980 has
imposed a restriction on the de-reservation of forest which came into effect in the year 1980 in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 137
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
terms of Subsection (2) of Section 2 thereof. 32.7. Even according to the learned counsel of the
Petitioners, de-reservation can only be made with the prior approval of the Central government.
This is for the simple reason that the lands in question continue to be part of the Notification of the
year 1921, which has not been challenged. No de-reservation having been made and the hon'ble
Apex Court in Godavarman's case having prohibited any such dereservation, the petitioners cannot
now claim that there is any such dereservation
- 202 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR without placing any document in regard thereto on record.
32.8. In that view of the matter there could not be any grant made of the subject land, once it was
notified to be forest land, there cannot be an estoppel against statute, there being a clear bar under
the statute for using a forest land for non forestry purpose, the petitioners are fully aware of such
embargo and the claim of the Forest department, this I say so for the simple reason that no action
had been taken to develop the property or the like until the turn of the century, by which time action
had been taken by the forest department, and the dispute was pending before the court, the first suit
having been filed by Petitioner No. 2-Mohammad Sanaullah, in O.S. No. 600/1981 seeking a
permanent injunction against the Forest Department, restraining the Forest Department
- 203 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR from interfering with the peaceful possession of Petitioner No.2 in
Survey No. 69/2. The execution of the joint development agreement, obtaining of plan sanction, and
agreements of sale having been entered into in that regard are all after the forest department had
initiated action and the suit had been filed. Hence, all these acts having been committed by the
Petitioners or by persons claiming through or under them, would not entitle them to any equitable
consideration. Insofar as third-party purchasers are concerned, they would always have recourse
against the petitioners. 32.9. Thus, I answer point number 6 by holding that after the Government
notifying the land to be forest land under the Mysore Forest Regulation 1990 vide notification dated
8-01-1921, the alleged grant of land in survey number 69 in the year 1932 and
- 204 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR the grant of land in survey number 68 in the year 1945 is contrary
and violative of the Mysore Forest Regulation 1900 (though no such grant order/s have been placed
on record), the further actions taken in entering into a joint Development Agreement, formation of a
Lay out, sale thereof and proposed construction houses is violative of the Karnataka Forest Rules,
1969 and Forest (Conservation) Act 1980.
33. ANSWER TO POINT No. 7: Whether there is any delay and if there is delay, would it disentitle
the Forest Department from taking action under Section 64A?
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 138
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
33.1. Much has been argued by Sri.Chandan, learned counsel for the petitioners as regards the
alleged delay. His submissions have been detailed out hereinabove. The sum and substance of his
submission is that the grant having been made in the year 1932 in respect
- 205 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR of survey number 69, in the year 1945 in respect of survey number
68, for the first time interference was sought to be made by the Forest department in the year 1979,
as regards which the first suit having been filed by Petitioner No. 2-Mohammad Sanaullah, in O.S.
No. 600/1981 seeking a permanent injunction against the Forest Department, restraining the Forest
Department from interfering with the peaceful possession of Petitioner No.2 in Survey No. 69/2.
Thereafter, the forest department filed a suit in OS No.1424/2006 in the year 2006. Simultaneously,
FOC proceedings were initiated in the year 2006-07. The suit in OS No. 1424 of 2006 came to be
dismissed on 8.03.2012, as regards which RFA 1287 of 2012 has been filed, which also came to be
dismissed. An appeal having been filed before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No.
- 206 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR 5801 of 2022, the said appeal had been remanded to the trial Court
vide order dated 20.09.2022. The trial court once again dismissed the suit on 15.12.2023, which is
pending in appeal in RFA No. 160 of 2024. 33.2. In reply, Sri Kiran Ron, Additional Advocate
General would submit that once a land has been declared to be Forest land, it will always continue to
be Forest land and any encroachment thereof in violation of a notification would provide a
continuing cause of action to the Forest department to initiate action. It is on the basis of the above
submission that this point would have to be answered.
33.3. It is not in dispute that the Forest Department sought to take action in the year 1979, as
regards which the first suit having been filed by
- 207 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR Petitioner No. 2-Mohammad Sanaullah, in O.S. No. 600/1981
seeking a permanent injunction against the Forest Department, restraining the Forest Department
from interfering with the peaceful possession of Petitioner No.2 in Survey No. 69/2, which came to
be dismissed, it is on an appeal being filed that the said appeal was allowed, challenging which the
Forest Department filed the second Appeal, which was withdrawn to file a comprehensive suit which
was so done in the year 2006 as indicated supra, simultaneously the FOC proceeding in FOC 7, 8, 9,
13 and 14 of 2006-07, were taken up which were challenged after 5 years by the Petitioners in
Criminal Petitions No. 1852 to 1857 of 2012, the said criminal petition came to be allowed, reserving
liberty to the Forest Department to conduct a joint survey as per the notification of the year 1921.

Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR 33.4. These facts would indicate that at best till the year 1981 it
could be said that no action had been taken by the Forest Department in respect of the aforesaid
lands. From 1981, the parties have been battling each other in one fora or the other. Thus, at this
stage, having initiated action more than 40 years ago, it cannot be said that there is a delay on the
part of the forest department or that no such action can be taken. All the citations relied upon by the
learned counsel for the Petitioners would not therefore apply the litigation going on the in present
matter for more that 40 years. 33.5. On facts, it is clear that the lands are within the boundaries of
the notification of the year 1921. 33.6. Thus, I answer point number 7 by holding that there is no
gross delay on the part of the Forest department; the proceedings

34. General Directions/recommendations:
34.1. Forests are more than just collections of trees;
they are complex, dynamic ecosystems that provide essential ecological services and significant
economic and social benefits. From a global perspective, forests are considered "carbon sinks,"
absorbing vast amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which helps to mitigate
climate change. The loss of these forests, however, turns them from carbon sinks into carbon
sources, contributing to rising global temperatures and more frequent extreme weather events. 34.2.
The ecological health of forests is critical for the stability of the entire planet and for all living things
more particularly the Human Race to
- 210 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR survive. They harbour a vast majority of the world's land-based
biodiversity, providing homes for countless species. Deforestation leads to habitat loss, forcing
species into fragmented areas where they are more vulnerable to hunting, poaching, and extinction.
Furthermore, forests play a vital role in local water cycles, helping to generate rainfall, and their
removal can disrupt precipitation and river flow patterns, leading to soil erosion. This erosion can,
in turn, degrade arable land, compelling agricultural producers to clear more forest land and
perpetuate a destructive cycle, which also results in global warming, change in seasons, net result of
which is the suffering of all living organisms, more so the human species. In Cities like Bangalore it
can result in reduced water table, increased pollution, dust and the like which are not conducive,
there is
- 211 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR therefore a need for maintaining green spaces as lung spaces to
have better environmental balance in cities 34.3. Forests and lung spaces in and around a city offers

valuable respite from nature's vagaries, ground water protection, protection from pollution etc.,
34.4. Despite their importance, forests face constant threats from deforestation and diversion for
non-forest purposes. While laws like the Forest Conservation Act of 1980 mandate that any
diversion of forest land for non-forest use requires prior approval from the central government,
illegal diversion still occurs in some areas, leading to degradation and loss of forest cover. The
cumulative effect of these activities is not only a loss of forest land but a profound destabilisation of
the entire ecosystem
- 212 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR that is vital for the survival of wildlife, flora, and the communities
that depend on them, which today also includes humans.
34.5. The current case demonstrates that the traditional, paper-based, and siloed administrative
systems are inadequate to resolve complex land title conflicts. While Karnataka has made significant
strides in land records modernisation, the current situation proves that digitisation alone is
insufficient. The critical failure is the lack of a single, unified source of truth.
34.6. The Digital India Land Records Modernisation Programme (DILRMP) has been a significant
initiative, succeeding in computerising land records and integrating Sub-Registrar Offices with land
records. Karnataka's Bhoomi portal,
- 213 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR for instance, has enabled online access to Records of Rights (RTCs)
and mutation details. 34.7. The current dispute demonstrates the program's fundamental limitation:
while records are digitised, they are not necessarily integrated. The Tahsildar's 2015 survey, which
failed to identify the land as forest property, was likely based solely on the Revenue Department's
records, which had not been reconciled with the Forest Department's historical gazette notifications.
This lack of interoperability between different departmental databases means that a seemingly
"clean" title in one system (e.g., Revenue) can conceal a fatal legal defect in another system (e.g.,
Forest). The problem is not the absence of digital records but the absence of a single, authoritative,
and consolidated database that
- 214 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR all government departments must mandatorily reference.
34.8. The solution lies in a radical transformation from siloed digitisation to a unified, integrated
technological platform that serves as a single source of verifiable and credentialised truth for all
land-related information. 34.9. Geographic Information System (GIS)-
based platform: The foundational component must be a Geographic Information System
(GIS)-based platform. This system would function as a digital, unified, and immutable map of all
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 141
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
land parcels in the state. Leveraging high-resolution satellite imagery from agencies like the Forest
Survey of India (FSI) and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), this platform is digitally
demarcating and geo- tagging all notified forest boundaries as per
- 215 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR historical gazette notifications, as also conducting forest cover
mapping using remote sensing data to monitor the status of forests at the state level. This unified
map would then have to be integrated with all other land-related data, including the Revenue
Department's cadastral maps, the Urban Planning Authority's master plans, and all other public and
private land records. The platform is assigning a Unique Land Parcel Identification Number
(ULPIN), or "Bhu-Aadhar," to every land parcel, linking all textual, spatial, and legal records to a
single, immutable digital identity, which is to be incorporated in all land records, which are required
to be QR code enabled as also date and time stampted in order to enable public verification.
- 216 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR 34.10. Automated System: An automated system must be built on
top of the integrated geospatial platform to streamline all land- related applications. This system
would ensure that no land-related action is taken without mandatory, real-time verification against
the unified database. For instance, the Deputy Commissioner and planning authorities like BIAPPA
would have to be legally barred from processing any land conversion or layout sanction application
until the automated system performs a check against the integrated forest map.
34.11. Conflict Alert: If a parcel falls within a notified forest boundary, the system must
automatically reject the application and generate a "Conflict Alert" for all concerned departments.
Similarly, the Sub-Registrar's Office must be linked to this system to prevent the registration of any
sale
- 217 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR deed for a parcel with a "Conflict Alert," as the existence of litigation
or dispute over a property makes it difficult to legally transfer. The online portal for building plan
approvals would also be required to integrate with this system to automatically verify that the land is
legally converted and free from disputes. 34.12. Publicly Accessible Portal: To empower citizens and
foster public trust, the unified platform must include a publicly accessible portal. Through this
portal, any individual, including prospective buyers, can enter a ULPIN, a survey number or such
other identifiable details to view a comprehensive, colour-coded report of the land parcel. This
report would display the land-use classification, ownership history (mutation records), details of any
litigation or encumbrances, and a clear, explicit warning if the land falls within a notified

development zone. This transparency mechanism would serve as a powerful deterrent to fraud,
enabling citizens to perform their own due diligence and effectively acting as a "fraud alert" for every
future buyer. By allowing the public to easily verify land status, it would address the core issue of a
lack of information, which results in misinformation that leads to fraudulent transactions. 34.13.
Reconciliation of Historical Records: The Department of Land and Revenue is directed to
immediately undertake a time-bound, state- wide project to reconcile all historical records,
including Record of Tenancy and Crops, Form 10, Form 11, Mutation Register, Grant registers,
Saguvali Chits, Kethwar registers, Darkast registers, Conversion orders, and any other land revenue
records which may be
- 219 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR maintained as regards that particular land or any other register
where the details of that particular property are available, with the digitised forest and revenue
maps. The outcome of this reconciliation must be a single, authenticated, and immutable record for
each land parcel. The power to rectify errors in revenue records is limited to clerical and
typographical mistakes and cannot be used to alter fundamental land rights or ownership without a
proper legal process. 34.14. ULPIN Implementation: The department shall ensure the mandatory
adoption and use of the Unique Land Parcel Identification Number (ULPIN) for all land parcels. The
ULPIN shall serve as the primary key for linking all textual, spatial, and legal data for each parcel,
ensuring data integrity and preventing future discrepancies.
- 220 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR 34.15. Establishment of an Inter-Departmental Land Dispute
Resolution Cell (IDLDRC): A dedicated, high-level cell, comprising representatives from the
Revenue Department, the Forest Department, and Urban Planning Authorities, shall be established
under the direct supervision of the Chief Secretary. This cell shall be the sole body authorised to
mediate and issue binding, inter-departmental rectification orders for conflicting records. The
Regional Commissioners shall head this cell, as they are tasked with coordinating the work of all
departments at the regional level to resolve inter-departmental problems. 34.16. Digital
Demarcation of Boundaries: The Forest Department is directed to complete the mandatory
geo-tagging and digital demarcation of all notified forest land boundaries, based on
- 221 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR historical gazette notifications. This geo- referenced data must be
integrated into the central geospatial platform established under these directions. The Forest Survey
of India, through its use of remote sensing and satellite data, can create digital maps of forest
boundaries with a high degree of precision, which is essential for this task. 34.17. Mandatory
Geo-Verification: The department shall be legally barred from issuing any notice or initiating
prosecution for alleged encroachments without first verifying the land parcel's location against the
unified, geo- referenced database. Once the system is set up all future notices must explicitly include
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169045797/ 143
Mr. Mohammed Shoaib vs State Of Karnataka on 18 August, 2025
the land parcel's ULPIN and a geo-referenced map. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has also noted that
the only defense open to an encroacher is to
- 222 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR prove that their land does not fall within the notified forest
boundaries.
34.18. Alerts: This court also recognises that there may be cases where diversion of forest land is
made without seeking for necessary permissions or in excess of permissions granted, in such
situations, an alert mechanism to be incorporated in the digital maps, to monitor any changes,
which alert would be sent to all the concerned officers of the Forest and Revenue department to
enable them to take immediate action. The obligation to take action always resting with such
officials, the Alert system will aid in the discharge of their obligations/duties.
34.19. Mandatory Automated Conflict Checks: All urban planning authorities and local bodies,
including BIAPPA and the Deputy
- 223 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR Commissioner, shall be under a legal obligation to perform a
mandatory automated conflict check against the unified land database before sanctioning any layout
plan, land conversion, or building permit. Any application related to a land parcel identified as
forest land shall be automatically and immediately rejected by the system.
34.20. Accountability of Officials: Any official who issues any order/licence/permission/no-
objection, like a land conversion order or a plan sanction, etc., on a land parcel with a conflicting
title, after the implementation of the automated verification system, shall be held personally
accountable for his actions. 34.21. Use of Geo-Referenced Data as Primary Evidence: The
Department of Land Resources is to link e-Courts with land records and
- 224 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR registration databases, providing courts with firsthand, substantive
evidence, including geo- referenced maps and digital records from the unified geospatial platform.
34.22. Green Watch Platform: A unified mobile app and web portal where any citizen can report an
environmental violation with geotagged photos, videos, and documents.
34.23. Aforestation and Carbon Credits: The Government will have to consider the issuance of
Carbon credits for persons or organisations which contribute to afforestation and other projects
with measurable conservation outcomes (e.g., restoring a wetland, reforesting a degraded corridor
segment, achieving a verifiable positive outcome), which would create a direct financial flow from
development to conservation.

- 225 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR 34.24. High-Level Committee: To ensure these directions are not
merely pronouncements but are effectively implemented, a robust monitoring mechanism is
essential. A joint, high-level committee shall be convened, comprising representatives from the
Chief Secretary's office, and the heads of the Land and Revenue, Forest, and Urban Development
Departments, the Law Department, a law officer like an Additional Advocate General and such other
departments that the Chief Secretary, in her wisdom, may decide. The HLC's mandate will be to
oversee the phased implementation of these directions, resolve inter-departmental conflicts as they
arise, and provide a quarterly compliance report to the court. Such a committee, with its
multi-sectoral expertise, can bridge the gap between departments and prevent the "abdication of
- 226 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR responsibilities" that has historically plagued environmental
administration. 34.25. The implementation of these directions is to be done in a time-bound,
phase-wise manner:
34.26. Phase I (Immediate - 3 months): The IDLDRC and HLC are to be established.
Mandatory data sharing protocols for all new land transactions must be put into place, ensuring no
new contradictory records are created. These protocols would function like "data contracts,"
ensuring a common understanding and quality of data exchanged between departments. Blockchain
methodology could also be considered to be used. 34.27. Phase II (Mid-term - 3 months to 1 year):
The unified geospatial platform and the automated verification system must be
completed and made operational. The ULPIN
- 227 -
NC: 2025:KHC:32024 HC-KAR shall be implemented for all new land parcels, and a
public-facing portal shall be launched to enable transparency and citizen due
diligence.
34.28. Phase III (Long-term - 1-2 years): The full integration of all legacy records will
be completed. A significant number of pending disputes will be resolved through the
IDLDRC and the system will achieve its full potential for transparent, secure, and
definitive land governance.
34.29. The recommendations and suggestions above are based on the consideration
of a few of the aspects which have arisen in the matter, the HLC will be free to
consider any other aspect/s relevant to formulate a comprehensive methodology for
bringing about transparency and efficiency while protecting the most
