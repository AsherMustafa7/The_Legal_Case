[2] Accordingly, FIR No. 13(2)2022 TBL-PS U/S 325/307/34 IPC & 27(1) A Act was
registered against the 5 (five) accused, namely (1) N. Gojendro Singh, (2) Md. Atiqur
@ Huk S/o Md. Badur serving in police department as constable of Thoubal Moijing,
(3) N. Alexander Singh S/o N. Achouba Singh serving in Police Department as
constable of Thoubal Ningombam, (4) N. Amitkumar Singh S/o N. Momon Singh of
Thoubal Ningombam and (5) A. Sanjitkumar @ Khun S/o A. Borjao Singh of Thoubal
Ningombam.
Accused No. 1, namely Shri N. Gojendro Singh and accused No. 3, namely Shri N.
Alexander Singh were arrested by the police and produced before the Duty
Magistrate, Thoubal. [3] Vide order dated 13.02.2022, the accused No. 1 and accused
No. 3 were released on bail by the Ld. Duty Magistrate on the ground that there were
no materials in the remand prayer to attract Section 307 IPC and and the remaining
offences were bailable. Thereafter, accused No. 2, namely Md. Atiqur @ Huk by way
of application being Cril.Misc.Case(AB) No. 16 of 2022 and accused No. 4, namely N.
Amitkumar Singh, by way of Cril.Misc.Case(AB) No. 17 of 2022 and accused No. 5,
namely Sanjitkumar @ Khun, by way of Cril.Misc.Case(AB) No. 18 of 2022
approached Ld. Page 4 Sessions Judge, Thoubal praying for anticipatory bail under
Section 438 Cr.PC.
[4] Vide separate and similar orders dated 19.02.2022 in Cril.Misc.Case(AB) No. 16
of 2022, order dated 21.02.2022 in Cril.Misc.Case(AB) No. 17 of 2022 and order
dated 21.02.2022 in Cril.Misc.Case(AB) No. 18 of 2022, the Sessions Judge, Thoubal
rejected all the three anticipatory bail applications on the ground that offence under
Section 325 IPC is bailable and no offence under Section 307 IPC and Section 27(1)
Arms Act are made out and there is no reasonable grounds to grant protection to the
petitioner. The relevant portion is reproduced herein below:
"Another contention that offences U/S 307 IPC and S. 27 (1) Arms Act are not made
out can be looked from a different angle. Further, there is no pleading that the Police
have come in search of him so as to arrest him. Again, the petitioner has stated in
Para No. 7 that following Arnesh Kumar-vs-State of Bihar (2014) 8 SCC 273 that
police do not arrest accused unnecessary. Hence, the non searching of the accused to
arrest him.

Ningombam Amitkumar Singh vs The Officer-In-Charge on 11 April, 2023
As stated by the Ld. counsel for the petitioner that S. 325 is bailable and no offence
U/S 307 IPC and S. 27(1) Arms act is made out, there are no reasonable grounds to
grant protection to the petitioner. His only story on side of his story is that he was not
present at the time of the incident. He has not stated where he was present at that
relevant time.
In these circumstances, the present application is rejected."
[5] By way of the present applications, the petitioners approached this Court for granting
anticipatory bail. It is stated that 2 (two) accused Page 5 persons who were arrested on 13.02.2023
i.e. accused No. 1, Ningombam Gojendro Singh and accused No. 3, Ningombam Alexander Singh
were released by the Ld. Duty Magistrate, Thoubal as no offence under Section 307 IPC was
attracted. The petitioners, i.e. accused Nos. 2, 4 and 5, approached the Court of Ld. Sessions Judge
for grant of anticipatory bail fearing their arrest as done in accused Nos. 1 and 3. The bail
applications of the petitioners were rejected by separate and similar orders on the ground that
offence under Section 307 IPC and Section 27(1) Arms Act were not attracted. There were
apprehensions of the petitioners that they would be arrested by the police in connection with the
FIR as done with the co-accused, i.e. accused Nos. 1 & 3. It is stated that they will abide by any
condition as imposed by this Court.
[6] Common objection has been filed by the Officer-in-Charge, Thoubal Police Station where it is
stated that the injury suffered by the husband of the complainant is simple. It is also stated that 2
(two) license guns were released on Zima by the Ld. CJM, Thoubal. Moreover, it is stated that a copy
of the bail application is not received and thus ground for AB is not known. It is prayed that the bail
application may be rejected. [7] Heard Mr. N. Ibotombi, learned senior counsel assisted by Mr. A.
Rommel, learned counsel for the petitioner and Mr. H. Samarjit, learned PP for the State
respondent.
[8] Mr. N. Ibotombi, learned senior counsel for the petitioners, submits that this case is arising out
during the election period and is Page 6 fabricated one and due to enmity. There is no substance in
the matter. Accused No. 1 and accused No. 3 were released by the Duty Magistrate, Thoubal
rejecting the prayer for police remand on the ground that there was no material to attract Section
307 IPC. The injury report as filed by the police report is simple and as such, in any case, the offence
under Section 307 IPC is not attracted. If that be the case, Mr. N. Ibotombi, learned senior counsel,
submits that the petitioners ought to be granted anticipatory bail by the Ld. Special Sessions Judge,
Thoubal. Otherwise, they are liable to be arrested at any time in connection with the FIR, where
there is no material against them. He prays that application be allowed. [9] Mr. H. Samarjit, learned
PP for the State respondent, submits that there is serious allegation against the petitioners and the
sufficiency/adequacy material against the petitioners are to be considered at the time of charge
hearing and during the trial and the same cannot be considered in a bail application. The offence of
attempt to murder does not require sustaining severe injury in all the cases. There are circumstances
where the offence of attempt to murder is attracted without any injury and he prays that bail
applications may be rejected. [10] Considered the rival submissions of the learned counsel for the
parties and perused the materials available on record. [11] It is seen that the main accused named in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156849160/ 4
Ningombam Amitkumar Singh vs The Officer-In-Charge on 11 April, 2023
the complaint by the complainant and another accused had already been released by the Duty
Magistrate and even prayer for police remand was rejected as Page 7 materials under Section 307
IPC were lacking. However, in the impugned order, the Ld. Sessions Judge, Thoubal rejected the
bail applications with the observation that no offence under Section 307 IPC and Section 27(1) Arms
Act were made out. In such situation, the petitioners are liable to be arrested at any time in the
present FIR when both the Ld. Duty Magistrate as well as the Ld. Sessions Judge, Thoubal had
already observed that there is no material for offence under Section 307 IPC and Section 27(1) Arms
Act. The reasoning of the Ld. Sessions Judge is not proper. [12] Accordingly, bail applications are
allowed and disposed of. The petitioners i.e. accused No. 2, namely Md. Atiqur @ Huk, accused No.
3, namely N. Alexander Singh and accused No. 5, namely A. Sanjitkumar @ Khun are to be released
on bail in case of arrest on PR bond of Rs. 50,000/- with a surety (Govt. Employee) of each like
amount to the satisfaction of the arresting authority subject to the conditions:
(a) The petitioners shall furnish personal bond of Rs.
50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand) each with one surety each of the like amount.
(b) The petitioners shall co-operate with the investigation.
(c) The petitioners shall not tamper with the evidence or influence witnesses.
(d) The petitioners shall not leave Manipur without permission of Ld. Sessions Judge, Thoubal.
Page 8
(e) On breach of any of the aforesaid conditions, the respondent police is entitled to take appropriate
action against the petitioner in accordance with law. [13] It is made clear that the observations made
in this order are limited to the question of grant of anticipatory bail to the petitioners and the merits
of the complaint/case has not been delved into. [14] Send a copy of this order to the Ld. Sessions
Judge, Thoubal and OC, Thoubal PS for information.
