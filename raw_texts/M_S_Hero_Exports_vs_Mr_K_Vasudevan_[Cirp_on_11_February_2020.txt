resulted in the registration of the FIR in Crime No.344 of 2007. Subsequently, a settlement came
into being which resulted in a Memorandum of Understanding dated 08.07.2007, wherein it was

(5)According to the petitioner, the 2nd respondent/Corporate Debtor is due and payable a sum of
Rs.50,08,53,301/- as on 3.05.2018 and therefore, had filed a Claim in Form – B before the 1st
respondent – Resolution Professional. The petitioner also became aware of the fact that the
proceedings under the IBC against the 2nd respondent / Corporate Debtor was initiated by
M/s.Udhayaman Investments Private Limited and vide order dated 12.03.2018, NCLT, Chennai,
had appointed the 1st respondent as the Insolvency Resolution Professional [IRP] and during the
first Committee of Creditors Meeting, the 1st respondent was appointed as IRP with effect from
17.04.2018. However, the petitioner was not put on notice.
(6)The NCLT, Chennai, had approved the Resolution Plan filed by the 3rd respondent on 12.06.2019
and it was not communicated to the revision http://www.judis.nic.in petitioner and it was also not
forwarded by IRP to anyone of the creditors.
(7)It is also the specific case of the petitioner that IRP did not comply with the relevant Regulations
and also stated that in the Arbitration proceedings, the High Court of Delhi had appointed the
Hon'ble Mr.Justice P.K.Balasubramanyam, a retired Judge of the High Court of Delhi as the Sole
Arbitrator and it was put to challenge by the 2nd respondent/Corporate Creditor by filing SLP [C]
No.24580 of 2008 and it was dismissed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India on 17.12.2008 and
pendency of the proceedings, an application for interim measures, was also filed in OMP.No.369 of
2008 before the High Court of Delhi, wherein, Seizure Order also came to be passed.
(8)The revision petitioner sent a E-Mail communication dated 12.04.2019 to the 1st respondent /
IRP requesting him to produce proof of delivery of the rejection of the claim submitted by them and
reasons for such rejection. IRP, in response to the said E-mail communication, sent an E- mail
communication on the same day, i.e., 12.04.2019, stating among other things, that the claim of
Rs.50,08,53,301/- made by them was verified with the documents submitted by them along with the
claim and it was found that it could not be related to any entries in the Books of
http://www.judis.nic.in Accounts and relevant documents were also looked for in the records
available with the 2nd respondent/Corporate Debtor. Even the entire office premises of the 2nd
respondent/Corporate Debtor was also searched and some related files were found only during
January 2019 and on verification of the same, that the revision petitioner, who claims to be the
Operational Creditor was due and owes a sum of Rs.2,20,99,178/- to the 2nd respondent/Corporate
Debtor and no amount is payable to them in terms of the claim and the transaction for the supply of
iron ore and its payments, are also duly reflected in the Books and records. The 1st respondent/IRP,
citing the above said reasons and also referring to other legal proceedings, held that the claim made
by the revision petitioner is not tenable and rather, the 2nd respondent/Corporate Debtor has to
recover a huge amount from the revision petitioner and the said communication also reads that the
claim cannot be collated and included in the list of creditors even as a rejected claim since the
criminal investigation is pending and the Accounts of the 2nd respondent/Corporate Debtor
discloses the amount to be recovered, the claim was treated as abandoned.
(9)The revision petitioner, challenging the said communication, has filed miscellaneous applications
before the NCLT and the NCLT/Tribunal, http://www.judis.nic.in vide impugned order dated
04.11.2019, had dealt with its powers under Rule 11 of the National Company Law Tribunal Rules,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99386593/ 3
M/S.Hero Exports vs Mr.K.Vasudevan [Cirp on 11 February, 2020
[NCLT Rules] and found that the petitioner, under the garb of the application, wants to recall the
Resolution Plan already approved in accordance with law and in the absence of any such provision
for recalling and in exercise of the inherent power under Rule 11, the Authority cannot assume
powers derived under the Companies Act. In paragraph No.7 of the impugned order, the Tribunal
has observed that if at all any party feels aggrieved of the Plan approved, it is always open to such
person to assail the order by filing an appeal, but not to appeal for reversal of the Resolution process
by asking for recalling of the Resolution Plan. (10)The NCLT/ Tribunal, in paragraph No.9 further
observed that assuming recall power is inbuilt in the Code, hen also the concept of recall is
exercisable only in the cases where order is passed without jurisdiction or fraudulently obtained and
the same is not the case here. The NCLT/Tribunal further observed that it also lacks review
jurisdiction and citing the said reasons, has dismissed the miscellaneous application.
(11)Mr.S.R.Rajagopal, learned counsel assisted by Mr.M.Pradeep Shankar, learned counsel for the
petitioner would submit that despite availability of the voluminous records to substantiate the claim,
the http://www.judis.nic.in IRP/1st respondent herein has failed to exercise his jurisdiction vested
in him and without looking into the relevant records, has erroneously rejected the claim of the
revision petitioner vide E-mail communication dated 12.04.2019 and the only remedy available to
the revision petitioner/applicant is to go before NCLT and the NCLT, without understanding the
scope and purport of its inherent power and the contents of the applications, has simply rejected the
same and he would further add that in the light of the reasons assigned by the 1 st respondent / IRP,
the appeal itself is not maintainable before NCLAT and also drawn the attention of this Court to the
relevant provisions of IBC as well as NCLT Rules.
(12)The learned counsel also placed reliance upon the judgment reported in 2019 [17] SCALE 37
[M/s.Embassy Property Developments Private Limited Vs. State of Karnataka and Others].
(13)This Court has carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the
petitioner and also perused the materials placed before it.
(14)It is relevant to extract Rule 11 of the NCLT Rules, 2016:-
Rule 11:INHERENT POWERS:- Nothing in these Rules shall be deemed to limit or
otherwise affect the inherent powers of the Tribunal to make such
http://www.judis.nic.in orders as may be necessary for meeting the ends of justice or
to prevent abuse of the process of the Tribunal.'' (15)The 1st respondent/IRP, in the
E-mail communication dated 12.04.2019, had given reasons and the revision
petitioner/applicant filed two miscellaneous applications with the following prayer:-
''In the light of the above and in the interest of justice and in furtherance of the object
of the Code, it is therefore, prayed that this Hon'ble Tribunal may be pleased to set
aside the order in IND/811/2019 dated 30.08.2019 of the learned Assistant Registrar
of National Company Law Tribunal, Chennai and direct the Registry to number the
Miscellaneous Application and pass such further or other orders as this Hon'ble
Tribunal may deem fit and proper in the circumstances of the case and thus render
justice.'' (16)The NCLT/Tribunal, in the impugned order held that the said prayer
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99386593/ 4
M/S.Hero Exports vs Mr.K.Vasudevan [Cirp on 11 February, 2020
virtually amounts to reversal/recall of the Resolution Plan and the same cause could
be taken as a ground for filing an appeal under Section 32 of IBC and not by way of
this application which is impermissible in law.
As regards exercise of inherent power, the Tribunal has observed that assuming the power of recall
is inbuilt in IBC and it can be exercised only in cases where the order is passed without jurisdiction
or fraudulently http://www.judis.nic.in obtained and that is not the case here and the Tribunal,
further observed that in the absence of specific conferment of review jurisdiction, it cannot exercise
the power to review.
(17)In the decision of M/s.Embassy Property Developments Private Limited Vs. State of Karnataka
and Others reported in 2019 [17] SCALE 37 [cited supra], the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has
considered the interplay between IBC, certain provisions of the Companies Act and Mines and
Minerals [Development and Regulation] Act and Mines and Mineral Concession Rules and other
related Rules as well as the power of the High Court under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution
of India.
(18)The Hon'ble Apex Court, in paragraph No.24 has observed that '' the distinction between lack of
jurisdiction and wrongful exercise of available jurisdiction should certainly be taken into account by
High Courts, when Article 226 is sought to be invoked bypassing a statutory alternative remedy
provided by a special statute.'' In paragraph No.30 of the said judgment, the Hon'ble Apex Court of
India had dealt with the jurisdiction and the powers of NCLT. There cannot be any difficulty in
accepting the proposition laid down by the Apex Court in the above cited decision for the reason that
it is also a well settled position of law. http://www.judis.nic.in (19)The revision petitioner, under the
guise of filing a revision, under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, wants this Court to issue a
positive direction to NCLT, Chennai Bench, to exercise its inherent power in a particular manner. In
the considered opinion of the Court, it cannot issue a positive direction to NCLT, Chennai Bench, as
to how it should exercise its inherent power. The NCLT/Tribunal also found that in real sense, the
revision petitioner wants to recall of the Resolution Plan and the said cause could be taken as a
ground for filing an appeal under Section 32 of IBC. Thus, there is an effective alternate remedy
provided to the revision petitioner who also claimed to be an Operational Creditor. (20)If this Court
starts entertaining revision petitions like this, there is a likelihood of opening of flood gates where
the alleged aggrieved person, without resorting to the alternate remedy of appeal, would often
approach this Court and that is not the object of IBC. (21)This Court, on an independent appraisal of
the entire materials as well as the contents of the impugned order passed by NCLT, Chennai Bench,
is of the considered view that there is no error apparent or infirmity in the reasons assigned and
finds no merit in this Civil Revision Petition. (22)At this juncture, the learned counsel for the
petitioner would submit that the revision petition was filed on 06.12.2019 and it was returned for
http://www.judis.nic.in production of the approval of the Resolution Plan and vide endorsement
dated 22.01.2020, the papers were represented and the revision itself came to be numbered on
05.02.2020. The learned counsel has also drawn the attention of this Court to the proviso to Section
61[2] of IBC and would submit that since the period of limitation is self contained one and that the
impugned order came to be passed as early as on 04.11.2019, the petitioner may not be in a position
to avail the appeal remedy.

M/S.Hero Exports vs Mr.K.Vasudevan [Cirp on 11 February, 2020
(23)This Court has considered the said submission. From the perusal of the papers, it is prima facie
disclosed that the petitioner was diligently prosecuting the proceedings by filing Civil Revision
Petition and though it was presented on 06.12.2019, it came to be numbered on 05.02.2020 after
compliance of certain returns. Therefore, it is for the revision petition to convince the NCLAT as to
how the appeal petition is within the limitation period.
(24)In the result, the Civil Revision Petition stands dismissed. No costs. Consequently, the
connected miscellaneous petition is closed.
