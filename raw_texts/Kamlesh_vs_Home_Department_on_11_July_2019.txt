a non cooperation movement, on account of involvement of some miscreant and anti-social

06- This Court has also carefully gone through the writ petition as well as reply filed by the
respondents. It is true that a very unfortunate incident took place and at the same time the State
Government cannot be blamed for the same. The farmers went on strike and on account of various
incidents, 289 cases have been registered in 13 districts. The return reveals that large number of
paramilitary forces were also deployed. It is true that loss of property has also taken place in the
matter and the State Government has assured before this Court that no Writ Petition

will take place in future and they will take all possible care to ensure that public property is not
destroyed at any cost. 07- Rejoinder has also been filed in the matter and it has been stated that the
persons, who have suffered because of the violence, have not been compensated and the State
should be directed to buy agricultural produce at the Minimum Support Price and strict action
should be taken against the traders, who are selling sub standard seeds, fertilizers, etc. Various other
grounds have also been raised before this Court by filing rejoinder.

fact remains that a Judicial Inquiry Commission headed by Hon'ble Shri Justice J. K. Jain (Retd.)
has been constituted to inquire into the incident dated 06/06/2017. 09- The another important
aspect of the case is that as many as 06 farmers lost their lives and the Commission is inquiring into
each and ever aspect of the case and therefore, as the Commission has already submitted his report,
the State Government shall be free to proceed ahead in accordance with law.
10- This Court, as a Judicial Commission is already looking in to the matter, does not find any
reason to pass any order in the matter at this stage. The State Government shall be free to take
appropriate action in the matter in accordance with law, as the Commission has already submitted
its report.
11- With the aforesaid, Writ Petition No.3595/2017 stands disposed Writ Petition Nos.3595/2017,
