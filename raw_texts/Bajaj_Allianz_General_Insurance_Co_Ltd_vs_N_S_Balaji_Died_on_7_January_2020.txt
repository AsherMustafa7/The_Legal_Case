COMMON JUDGMENT
(Judgment of the Court was delivered by KRISHNAN RAMASAMY, J.,) The Civil Miscellaneous
Appeal in C.M.A.No.45 of 2016 has been filed by the Insurance Company questioning the liability
fixed and quantum of compensation awarded by the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, Chennai in
the Court No.VI of Small Causes, Chennai vide judgment and decree dated 23.07.2015 made in
M.C.O.P.No.3176 of 2009.
The Civil Miscellaneous Appeal in C.M.A.No.832 of 2016 has been filed by the claimants/wife &
minor son of the deceased Balaji against the quantum of award passed by the Motor Accidents
Claims Tribunal, Chennai in the Court No.VI of Small Causes, Chennai vide judgment and decree
dated 23.07.2015 made in M.C.O.P.No.3176 of 2009.
2. The brief facts of the case reads as follows:
On 29.08.2009, at about 20:15 hours, while one N.S.Balaji was riding the motorcycle
bearing Registration No.TN 05 AA 1352 at Anna Flyover, Anna Salai towards South
to North direction, at that time, a car bearing Registration No.TN 07 AJ 1724
belonging to one L.Mahadevan/R3 in both the Appeals and insured by the Insurance
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.M.A.Nos.45 & 832 of 2016 Company/appellant
in C.M.A.No.45 of 2016 & R4 in C.M.A.No.832 of 2016 driven by its driver, came
from behind and dashed against the said Balaji, as a result of which, the said Balaji
sustained grievous head injuries and lost conscious went coma and therefore, died on
05.02.2014. In the year 2009, when the said Balaji was alive, he had preferred a
Claim Petition in M.C.O.P.No.3176 of 2009 through his wife as his next friend as
against the insured and the insurer claiming a sum of Rs.1,00,00,000/-as
compensation.
3. Since both the appeals arise out of the same accident, they were heard together and disposed of by
way of this common judgment.
4. The owner of the car (R3 in both the Appeals) remained ex parte before the Tribunal.
5. The Insurance Company (Appellant in C.M.A.No.45 of 2016 and R4 in C.M.A.No.832 of 2016)
filed a counter statement denying all the averments made by the said Balaji in the Claim Petition.

6. On 23.07.2015, when the matter came up before the Tribunal, on the side of the claimants, 7
witnesses were examined viz., P.W.1 to P.W.7 and 54 documents were marked as exhibits viz., Ex.P1
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.M.A.Nos.45 & 832 of 2016 to Ex.P54 and on the side of the
Insurance Company, 3 witnesses were examined viz., R.W.1 to R.W.3 and 6 documents were marked
as exhibits viz., Ex.R1 to Ex.R6. One document was also marked on the side of the Court viz., Ex.C1.
7. On appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence produced before it, the Tribunal came to
the conclusion that the driver of the offending vehicle (car) was having more opportunity to avoid
the accident. Hence, it fixed the negligent on the driver of the car and liability on the shoulder of the
owner of the car who is the third respondent in both the Appeals. Further, the Tribunal also held
that the offending vehicle (car) was insured with the Insurance Company at the time of accident and
therefore, the Insurance Company is liable to pay the compensation. Finally, it awarded a sum of
Rs.90,01,000/- as compensation in M.C.O.P.No.3176 of 2009. The break up details of the Tribunal
award are as follows:

M.C.O.P.No.3176 of 2009, the said Balaji died on 05.02.2014 due to the head injuries sustained by
him in the accident occurred on 29.08.2009. Subsequent to his death, his mother and father were

9. Mr.T.Karunakaran, learned counsel appearing for the wife and minor son of the deceased viz., R4
& R5 in C.M.A.No.45 of 2016 and Appellants 1 & 2 in C.M.A.No.832 of 2016 fairly submitted that the
wife of the deceased left her matrimonial house with her son since her mother-in-law (R1 in both the
Appeals) was always shouting with her and abusing a lot. She (mother of the deceased) often scolded
the wife and the minor son of the deceased by stating that her son Balaji met with the fateful
accident only because of the reason that he married the unlucky woman and also because of the
pre-mature birth of his minor son. He further submitted that the wife of the deceased
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.M.A.Nos.45 & 832 of 2016 pledged her jewels for the medical
treatment of her husband Balaji and also borrowed money from her father for the medical expenses
of her husband. She (wife of the deceased) almost spent a sum of Rs.7,00,000/- around for the
medical expenses for her husband. Though the mother and father of the deceased are not necessary
parties, however, they were impleaded as petitioners 2 & 3 in the Claim Petition in order to grab the
entire compensation awarded for the death of Balaji. He also submitted that pending the M.C.O.P.,
the father of the deceased died on 15.03.2015 and while the C.M.A is pending before this Court, the
mother of the deceased died on 19.08.2016. The respondents 6 to 10 in C.M.A.No.45 of 2016 are not
the legal heirs of the deceased Balaji. The learned counsel therefore prayed that the entire
compensation may be given to the wife and the minor son of the deceased since they are the direct
legal heirs of the deceased Balaji.
10. Mr.K.Suriyanarayanan, learned counsel appearing for the mother and father of the deceased viz.,
respondents 1 & 2 in both the Appeals would contend that the parents of the deceased had spent a
huge sum of money for the medical treatment of their son Balaji. They have leased out their
residential property and spent the entire lease advance amount of Rs.12 Lakhs for the medical
treatment of their son Balaji. He would also contend that the wife of the deceased Balaji
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.M.A.Nos.45 & 832 of 2016 failed to take care of her husband
Balaji when he was in coma and she left the matrimonial home with her son. He would further
contend that the mother of the deceased left three daughters and two sons as her legal heirs who
were impleaded as respondents 6 to 10 in C.M.A.No.45 of 2016.
11. Mr.J.Michael Visuvasam, learned counsel appearing for the Insurance Company viz., R4 in both
the Appeals would contend that the deceased would not have sustained head injuries if he wore
helmet at the time of accident, however, the deceased Balaji failed to wear the same. As per the
Motor Vehicles Act, non-wearing of helmet is considered as an offense. He would further contend
that the Tribunal failed to fix the negligent/liability on the shoulder of the deceased as he did not
wear the helmet at the time of accident and drove the two wheeler negligently, whereas, it fixed the
100% negligent and liability on the driver of the car.
Liability:
12. The dispute involved in the case on hand is the negligence and liability fixed and quantum of
compensation awarded by the Tribunal in M.C.O.P.No.3176 of 2009. Actually, the accident occurred
only when the car hit back the two wheeler of the deceased. The rough sketch clearly revealed that
the two wheeler of the deceased https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.M.A.Nos.45 & 832 of 2016 and
the offending vehicle (car) of the third respondent were proceeds in the same direction. The driver
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5680069/ 5
Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd vs N.S.Balaji (Died) on 7 January, 2020
of the car (R3 in both the Appeals) could have avoided the accident if he used his driving skill
properly. One Mr.Vijayaraghavan, brother of the deceased was the eyewitness of the accident who
gave a complaint to the Police and the case was registered in Crime No.302/TN3/2009. He also
deposed his evidence as P.W.6. From a perusal of the Police complaint given by P.W.6, it is seen that
the accident occurred due to the negligent on the part of the owner of the offending vehicle (car).
Therefore, the Tribunal rightly held that though the deceased was not wearing helmet at the time of
accident, it was not awarded any contributory negligence on the part of the deceased, and the
Tribunal fixed the entire negligence on the driver of the car and fixed the liability on the owner of
the offending vehicle (car). The car was insured with the fourth respondent and that the Tribunal
directed the fourth respondent to pay the entire compensation to the claimants. Hence, this Court is
of the opinion that there is no need to interfere with the finding of the Tribunal regarding the
fixation of liability.
Quantum:
13. So far as the quantum of compensation is concerned, the offending vehicle (car) was insured
with the Insurance Company at the time of accident. So the Tribunal held that the Insurance
Company is https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.M.A.Nos.45 & 832 of 2016 liable to pay the just
compensation to the claimants. Accordingly, the Tribunal directed the Insurance Company to
deposit a sum of Rs.90,01,000/- with interest at 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of petition
till the date of deposit within two months from the date of award. It also held that out of the award
amount, the mother of the deceased is entitled to get Rs.68,60,200/- and the wife of the deceased is
entitled to a sum of Rs.10,02,800/- and the son of the deceased is entitled to a sum of
Rs.11,38,000/- as compensation.
14. The learned counsel appearing for the mother and father of the deceased would contend that the
parents of the deceased Balaji had spent a huge sum of money for the medical treatment of their son
Balaji and they had also produced the Documents viz., Ex.P13, Nursing Care Bills, Ex.P37, Copy of
Certificate of Physiotherapy and Ex.P38, Copy of Identity Card of Physiotherapist before the
Tribunal to that effect. He would further contend that the wife of the deceased in her deposition,
deposed that she pledged her jewels and also borrowed money from her father for the medical
expenses of her husband Balaji. She further stated that she and her only son are the original legal
heirs of her deceased husband Balaji. However, there is no material evidence was placed by the wife
of the deceased before the Tribunal in order to prove her statement. He also drawn the attention of
this https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.M.A.Nos.45 & 832 of 2016 Court to the details of the
medical bills produced by the parents of the deceased which were marked as exhibits viz., Ex.P10,
Hospital Bills; Ex.P11, Pharmacy Bills; Ex.P12, Physiotherapist Bills; and Ex.P13, Nursing Care Bills.
The details of the said medical bills are mentioned hereinbelow:
Hospital Bills - Rs.22,91,196.43/-
Pharmacy Bills - Rs. 6,65,530.36/-
Physiotherapist Bills - Rs. 8,40,400.00/-
Nursing Care Bills - Rs.16,60,300.79/-

______________________
Total - Rs.54,57,427.00/-
______________________
15. The learned counsel appearing for the Insurance Company fairly submitted that the Insurance
Company has no objection to reimburse the Hospital Bills as well as Pharmacy Bills of the deceased,
however, he strongly objected to reimburse such a huge sum of Rs.8,40,400.00/- towards
Physiotherapist Bills as awarded by the Tribunal since the same is on the higher side. He would
contend that even the Physiotherapist attended the injured at his home everyday for 4½ years, by
paying a sum of Rs.300/- per day, the maximum amount would have been spent will be a sum of
Rs.4,86,000/- only. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.M.A.Nos.45 & 832 of 2016
16. We are of the considered view that the amount awarded by the Tribunal towards Hospital Bills
and Pharmacy Bills are reasonable and therefore, the same remains unaltered. However,
considering the huge amount of Rs.8,40,400/- awarded by the Tribunal towards Physiotherapist
Bills, we incline to modify the same. Accordingly, a sum of Rs.8,40,400/- already awarded towards
Physiotherapist Bill by the Tribunal is modified by this Court as Rs.4,86,000/-.
17. The learned counsel for the Insurance Company also contended that a sum of Rs.16,60,300/-
awarded by the Tribunal towards Nursing Bills of the deceased is on the higher side. He therefore
prayed that a reasonable sum of Rs.10,000/- per month may be awarded towards Nursing Bills of
the deceased.
18. The said contention of the counsel for Insurance Company is reasonable and acceptable by this
Court. Hence, we inclined to award a sum of Rs.5,40,000/- towards Nursing Bills of the deceased.
Rs.10,000/- per month x 54 months = Rs.5,40,000/- Medical Expenses:
19. Therefore, a sum of Rs.55,00,000/- already awarded by the Tribunal towards Medical Expenses
is modified by this Court to https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.M.A.Nos.45 & 832 of 2016
Rs.39,82,726/-. The break up details of the modified Medical Expenses are follows:
Hospital Bills - Rs.22,91,196/-
Pharmacy Bills - Rs. 6,65,530/-
Physiotherapist Bills - Rs. 4,86,000/-
Nursing Bills - Rs. 5,40,000/-

20. The learned counsel appearing for the Insurance Company contended that the amount awarded
by the Tribunal towards Pecuniary Damages; Loss of Love & Affection; Loss of Consortium and
Funeral Expenses are on the higher side. He also contended that Rs.21,76,000/- awarded by the
Tribunal towards Loss of Dependency is also on the higher side. The Tribunal has fixed the notional
income of the deceased as Rs.17,000/- which is on the higher side. The deceased was working as an
Executive Trainee, in Ascent Marketing and his monthly income was Rs.8,500/- at that point of
time when the accident was occurred. However, the Tribunal has fixed a sum of Rs.17,000/- as
notional income of the deceased. Taking into consideration of the fact that on completion of the
training he would get higher amount, the Tribunal fixed the notional income of the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.M.A.Nos.45 & 832 of 2016 deceased as Rs.17,000/-. He
therefore prayed that the notional income of the deceased may be fixed as Rs.11,000/- after
appropriate deduction.
21. Admittedly, the age of the deceased was 34 years at the time of accident and he was working as a
trainee and drawn a sum of Rs.8,500/- as monthly income at that point of time, even if the job of
the deceased is confirmed, he cannot draw a sum of Rs.17,000/- as monthly income. Therefore, we
are of the opinion that the Tribunal wrongly assessed the notional income of the deceased as
Rs.17,000/- per month in the year 2009. As contended by the learned counsel for the Insurance
Company, a sum of Rs.11,000/- is a reasonable notional income of the deceased. Hence, we inclined
to fix a sum of Rs.11,000/- as notional income of the deceased for the purpose of determining the
Loss of Income for the claimants.
22. In the present case, this Court applies the multiplier '16' and 1/3rd deduction is calculated, as
rightly held by the Tribunal. The age of the deceased was 34 years at the time of accident, but, when
he was passed away in the year 2014, he was 38 years. As held by the Honourable Supreme Court in
the case of National Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Pranay Sethi and others reported in 2017 (2) TNMAC
609 (SC), for the age group below 40, 40% of income requires to be
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.M.A.Nos.45 & 832 of 2016 added towards Future Prospects.
Accordingly, we inclined to add 40% of income towards the Future Prospects of the deceased.
Rs.11,000/- + Rs.4,400/- (40%) = Rs.15,400/-
After deducting 1/3rd towards personal expenses of the deceased, the Loss of Income would be
Rs.10,267/-
Rs.15,400 x 2/3 = Rs.10,267/- per month.
Loss of Dependency:
23. By applying the multiplier '16', Loss of Dependency would be Rs.19,71,264/-.
Rs.10,267/- x 12 x 16 = Rs.19,71,264/-

Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd vs N.S.Balaji (Died) on 7 January, 2020
Pecuniary Damages, Loss of Love & Affection and Loss of Consortium:
24. The Tribunal awarded sum of Rs.2,00,000/- towards Pecuniary Damages;
Rs.2,00,000/- towards Loss of Love & Affection to the mother and the minor son of
the deceased and Rs.1,00,000/-
towards Loss of Consortium, which are too high. Therefore, this Court inclined to modify the
amount awarded by the Tribunal towards Pecuniary Damages, Loss of Love & Affection and Loss of
Consortium. Accordingly, this Court modifies the amount awarded by the Tribunal towards
Pecuniary Damages as Rs.1,00,000/-; Loss of Love & Affection https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
C.M.A.Nos.45 & 832 of 2016 as Rs.80,000/- i.e., Rs.40,000/- each to the mother and minor son of
the deceased and Loss of Consortium as Rs.40,000/- to the wife. Funeral Expenses:
25. The Tribunal awarded a sum of Rs.25,000/- towards Funeral Expenses, however,
in the case of National Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Pranay Sethi and others reported in
2017 (2) TNMAC 609 (SC), the Honourable Apex Court even fixed only a sum of
Rs.15,000/-
towards Funeral Expenses. Hence, following the judgment of the Apex Court in Pranay Sethi's case,
this Court awards a sum of Rs.15,000/- towards Funeral Expenses.
Mental Agony:
26. The Tribunal awarded a sum of Rs.8,00,000/- towards Mental Agony which is
quite unusual. No doubt, over 4½ years, the deceased had gone through the mental
agony, but, such a huge sum of Rs.8,00,000/- awarded towards Mental Agony by the
Tribunal is really too high and therefore, we inclined to modify the same as
Rs.50,000/-. Accordingly, the amount already awarded by the Tribunal towards
Mental Agony is reduced to Rs.50,000/- by this Court.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.M.A.Nos.45 & 832 of 2016
27. The Tribunal already awarded a sum of Rs.90,01,000/- as compensation to the claimants and
now, this Court modifies the said award and arrived at a total sum of Rs.62,38,990/- which is
rounded as Rs.62,39,000/-. The break-up details of the award as modified by this Court are as
follows:

28. In the result,
(i) C.M.A.No.45 of 2016 is partly allowed and a sum of Rs.90,01,000/- (Rupees Ninety Lakhs One
Thousand) awarded by the Tribunal is modified by this Court to a sum of Rs.62,38,990/- which is
rounded off as Rs.62,39,000/- (Rupees Sixty Two Lakhs Thirty Nine Thousand). Out of the
modified award amount, wife of the deceased is entitled to a sum of Rs.30,00,000/-; minor son of
the deceased is entitled to Rs.12,39,000/- and the five legal heirs of the deceased first respondent in
both the Appeals viz., respondents 6 to 10 in C.M.A.No.45 of 2016 are entitled to Rs.20,00,000/-
i.e., Rs.4,00,000/- each. The fourth respondent/Insurance Company is directed to deposit the
award amount modified by this Court, deduct the amount, if any, already deposited, along with
interest at 7.5% per annum from the date of petition till the date of deposit to the credit of
M.C.O.P.No.3176 of 2009 within a period of eight weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this
judgment. On such deposit being made, the Tribunal is directed to transfer the award amount
directly to the respective bank account of the wife of the deceased and the legal heirs of the deceased
first respondent in both the Appeals viz., respondents 6 to 10 in C.M.A.No.45 of 2016, as per the
ratio of apportionment ordered by this Court, through RTGS, within a period of three weeks
thereafter. So far the minor son of the deceased is concerned, the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
C.M.A.Nos.45 & 832 of 2016 Tribunal shall deposit the amount of the minor claimant in a fixed
