Director without proper verification and requested them to verify the genuineness of the certificates.

Instead of taking action on the representation, the Health Department by way of the impugned letter
dated 16.2.2022 and the notification dated 5.4.2022 extended the last date for submission of the
Covid duty experience certificate and also the cut-off date for deciding completion of 100 days Covid
duty experience from 31.10.2021 to 25.1.2022. WP(C) No. 256 of 2022, WP(C) No. 257 of 2023,

15. According to the learned senior counsel, the Doctors who are very close with the higher authority
of the State Government and who have not completed 100 days Covid related duties as on
31.10.2021 have submitted their certificates issued by the authority without proper verification,
which necessitated the petitioners in filing the writ petition challenging the impugned letter and the
notification.
16. Mr. Lenin Hijam, the learned Advocate-General appearing for the State respondents, submitted
that the impugned letter and the notification were issued by the official respondents having
considered the issue and there is no arbitrariness as alleged by the petitioners. He would submit that
the contention of the petitioners that the impugned letter dated 16.2.2022 and the notification dated
5.4.2022 were issued by the concerned authority only to give advantage to the Doctors who have not
completed 100 days Covid related duties on or before 31.10.2021 is absolutely incorrect and, only
after proper verification, the concerned authority has issued the Covid duty experience certificates to
the Medical Officers. Therefore, there is no basis in the claim made by the petitioners in W.P.(C)
Nos.256 and 295 of 2022. Thus, a prayer has been made to dismiss the writ petitions. WP(C) No.
256 of 2022, WP(C) No. 257 of 2023, WP(C) No. 295 of 2022, WP(C) No. 363 of 2022 and WP(C)
No. 412 of 2022 P a g e | 18
17. Mr. RS Reisang, the learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent MPSC submitted that
the Deputy Secretary of Health and Family Welfare, Government of Manipur, sent a letter dated
27.10.2021 to the MPSC for modification of the scheme of examination requisitioned for Manipur
Health Services Grade-IV Medical Officers. In the said letter, it has been stated that the individuals
providing service in Covid management will be given priority in the forthcoming regular
Government recruitments after they complete minimum of 100 days of Covid duty with a further
direction that all Doctors who have performed Covid related duties for at least 100 days may be
given 10 additional marks in the written examination out of the full marks of 200 to be conducted by
the MPSC.
18. Mr. Reisang, learned senior counsel further submitted that the impugned letter dated 16.2.2022
was sent to the MPSC to accept the 100 days Covid duty completion certificates duly signed by
Director of Health Services for the period till 25.1.2022 since the newly extended timeline
completion of 100 days Covid duty is to be taken as 25.1.2022. Therefore, there is is no arbitrariness
in the issuing the impugned letter and notification.
WP(C) No. 256 of 2022, WP(C) No. 257 of 2023, WP(C) No. 295 of 2022, WP(C) No. 363 of 2022
and WP(C) No. 412 of 2022 P a g e | 19

19. Mr. Reisang, learned senior counsel further submitted that though the written examination was
held, the result of the examination was not declared in view of the interim order passed by this
Court. He would submit that there has been a delay of more than one year since the publication of
the advertisement and such delay not only affects the sanctity of the recruitment process and
recruiting body, but also adversely affects the hopes and aspiration of the aspirants in general and
the candidates in particular.
W.P.(C) Nos.363 and 412 of 2022:
20. Mr. N. Kumarjit, learned senior counsel for the petitioners in W.P.(C) Nos.363 and 412 of 2022,
submitted that the petitioners were engaged for Covid related duties in Regional Institute of Medical
Sciences Hospital (RIMS), Imphal, which is an autonomous institution under the Ministry of Health
and Family Welfare, Government of India and the certificates for completion of 100 days of Covid
duty have been issued in their favour by the Director of Health Services, Government of Manipur.
However, vide letter dated 5.5.2022, the Director of Health Services, has conveyed that certificates
issued in respect of Covid related duties in RIMS Hospital shall not be considered for awarding 10
additional marks, as RIMS is not under the Government of Manipur.
WP(C) No. 256 of 2022, WP(C) No. 257 of 2023, WP(C) No. 295 of 2022, WP(C) No. 363 of 2022
and WP(C) No. 412 of 2022 P a g e | 20
21. Mr. N. Kumarjit, learned senior counsel, further submitted that the restriction of awarding of 10
additional marks only to candidates who had completed 100 days Covid related duties in Health
Centres/Facilities under the Government of Manipur is arbitrary, illegal and not maintainable in
law. He would submit that the incentive of awarding 10 additional marks in the written examination
for recruitment of MHS Grade-IV (Medical Officers) to candidates who have completed 100 days
Covid related duties has been undertaken by the Government of Manipur upon the recommendation
of the Central Government in terms of the letter dated 3.5.2021 of the Ministry of Health and Family
Welfare. Arguing so, the learned senior counsel submitted that the impugned letter dated 5.5.2022
as well as the notification dated 5.1.2022 are liable to be quashed so far as the exclusion of the
aforesaid incentive scheme to the petitioners on the ground of having completed 100 days of Covid
related duties in RIMS, Imphal.
22. Mr. N. Kumarjit, learned senior counsel, urged that the petitioners in W.P.(C) Nos.363 and 412
of 2022 are opposing the issuance of certificates to candidates who were not working in the Covid
periods and such non-genuine certificates must be strictly verified and cancelled. However, in the
case of petitioners in W.P.(C) Nos.363 and 412 of 2022 is entirely different and their WP(C) No. 256
of 2022, WP(C) No. 257 of 2023, WP(C) No. 295 of 2022, WP(C) No. 363 of 2022 and WP(C) No.
412 of 2022 P a g e | 21 Covid duties are undisputed and cannot be excluded. Therefore, the
exclusion made by the respondent authorties is in violation of the right to equality guaranteed under
Article 14 and Article 16 of the Constitution of India. In support, the learned counsel placed reliance
upon the decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the cases of (i) Union of India and others v.
M.Selvakumar and another, (2017) 3 SCC 504 and State of Madhya Pradesh and others v. Mala
Banerjee, (2015) 7 SCC 698.

23. Refuting the submissions made by learned senior counsel for the petitioners in W.P.(C) No.363
of 2022 and 412 of 2022, the learned Advocate-General appearing for the State respondents
submitted that since the service rendered by the petitioners is not in Health Centres/Facilities under
the Government of Manipur, the respondent authorities have rightly not considered the claim of the
petitioners, however, now the State Cabinet has taken a decision to extend the benefits of awarding
additional 10 marks to the Doctors of RIMS Imphal who were engaged for Covid related duties.
24. This Court considered the rival submissions and also perused the materials available on record.
25. W.P.(C) Nos.256 and 295 of 2022 have been filed by the petitioners alleging that more than 300
Covid duty experience WP(C) No. 256 of 2022, WP(C) No. 257 of 2023, WP(C) No. 295 of 2022,
WP(C) No. 363 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 412 of 2022 P a g e | 22 certificates have been issued by the
Director of Health Services, Government of Manipur, though their services were not utilized as
Doctors in the Health Centres/Facilities; many Doctors who have not completed 100 days Covid
related duties were also provided the Covid duty experience certificates without proper verification
and also many certificates were issued by the Director even after the cut-off date for deciding
completion of 100 days.
26. W.P.(C) Nos.363 and 412 of 2022 have been filed by the another set of petitioners alleging that
the exclusion of awarding of 10 additional marks to the petitioners, who were Doctors in RIMS and
who had completed 100 days Covid related duties in the Heath Centres/Facilities is arbitrary. There
is no room for differentiation or discrimination between the service rendered under the Central
Government and the State Government under the special scheme introduced by the Central
Government. Thus, the prayer of the petitioners in W.P.(C) Nos.363 and 412 of 2022 is that they are
Doctors who have served more than 100 days in Covid-19 treatments at RIMS Hospital, Imphal,
which is a Central Government Hospital.
27. Let us consider the challenge made in W.P.(C) Nos.256 and 295 of 2022 first. According to the
petitioners, including the petitioner Association, the petitioners are genuine WP(C) No. 256 of 2022,
WP(C) No. 257 of 2023, WP(C) No. 295 of 2022, WP(C) No. 363 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 412 of
2022 P a g e | 23 Medical Officers appointed specially for combating Covid related duties utilized till
March, 2022 and the petitioners are facing hardships as all the time they were engaged in the Covid
related duties.
28. The MPSC issued an advertisement dated 1.10.2021 calling for application for direct recruitment
for filling up of 300 MHS Grade-IV (Medical Officers) under Health Department, Government of
Manipur. Pursuant to the advertisement, on 5.1.2022, the MPSC issued a notification informing all
candidates of Manipur Health Services Grade-IV (Medical Officers) that candidates who have
completed 100 days Covid related duties in Health Centres/Facilities under the Government of
Manipur as on 31.10.2021 (last dated of online submission) will be awarded 10 additional marks in
the written examination.
29. The Government of India, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, MEP Section, vide letter dated
3.5.2021, directed all the State Government and Union Territories to utilize the service of the MBBS
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138996918/ 12
Page |2 vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 4 May, 2023
Doctors in the management of Covid-19. Paragraph 15 of the said letter reads thus:
"15. State/UT Governments can provide additional health professionals engaged
through this process, to private Covid Hospitals as well as in surge areas."
WP(C) No. 256 of 2022, WP(C) No. 257 of 2023, WP(C) No. 295 of 2022, WP(C) No. 363 of 2022
and WP(C) No. 412 of 2022 P a g e | 24 Paragraph 17 provides as under:
"17. The Central Government recommends to State/UT Governments to consider
giving preference in regular Government appointments of Health professionals
through the respective Public Service Commission/other recruitment bodies, for
those Health Professionals under this special scheme, who complete a minimum of
100 days of Covid related duty."
30. There is no dispute that the petitioners in W.P.(C) No.256 and 295 of 2022 were
appointed/engaged as Medical Officers in their respective Health Centres/Facilities and they were
issued with Covid duty experience certificates and have also submitted the same to the MPSC within
the stipulated time as directed. The contention of the petitioners is that on 5.4.2022, the MPSC
issued a notification whereby extending the date of submission of the Covid duty experience
certificate upto 11.4.2022 and by the said notification the cut-off date for deciding the completion of
100 days Covid experience was also extended upto 25.1.2022. According to the petitioners, the said
extension of cut- off date from 31.10.2021 to 25.1.2022 and the extension of the last date of
submission of the certificates is highly questionable for the reason that many Doctors who have not
completed 100 days Covid related duties were also provided the experience certificate WP(C) No.
256 of 2022, WP(C) No. 257 of 2023, WP(C) No. 295 of 2022, WP(C) No. 363 of 2022 and WP(C)
No. 412 of 2022 P a g e | 25 without proper verification and many duty experience certificates were
issued by the Director of Health Services, Government of Manipur even after the cut-off date for
deciding the completion of 100 days Covid experience.
31. There is also no dispute that the petitioners in W.P.(C) No.363 and 412 of 2022 were appointed
as Junior Resident (non-academic) for rendering their services in Covid Wards/ICU of RIMS
Hospital, Imphal for nearly six months and they have also applied to the post of MHS Grade-IV
(Medical Officers) and pursuant to the notification, they have submitted Covid duty experience
certificates issued to them to the MPSC before the prescribed deadline. The petitioners in W.P.(C)
Nos.363 and 412 of 2022 are also opposed the issuance of certificates to candidates who were not
working in the Covid periods and such non-genuine certificates must be strictly verified and
cancelled.
32. Since serious allegations are levelled against the Health Department for issuance of Covid duty
experience certificates to underserving candidates who have not been given active duties in Covid
related matters under the Government of Manipur, on 26.4.2022, this Court directed the Director of
Health Services, Government of Manipur, to file an affidavit explaining the WP(C) No. 256 of 2022,
WP(C) No. 257 of 2023, WP(C) No. 295 of 2022, WP(C) No. 363 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 412 of
2022 P a g e | 26 number of certificates issued by the Department for completion of 100 days of

Page |2 vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 4 May, 2023
Covid related duties and also the Government Orders assigning duties to the concerned Doctors in
connection with Covid related duties. At the same time, as an interim measure, the MPSC was
directed not to declare the result of the written examination without the leave of the Court, which
was held as per the re-schedule.
33. It appears that pursuant to the order dated 26.4.2022, the Director of Health Services, Manipur,
sent a letter dated 5.5.2022 to the MPSC stating that 94 (sic) Doctors who have completed 100 days
of Covid related duties in RIMS, Imphal, will not be considered for awarding 10 additional marks in
the written examination for recruitment of MHS Grade-IV (Medical Officer) on the ground that they
had not worked in any Health Centres under the Government of Manipur for Covid related duties.
34. On 6.5.2022, when W.P.(C) No.295 of 2022 has been taken up for admission, this Court passed
the following order:
"Heard Mr. H.S. Paonam, learned senior counsel for the petitioners in W.P.(C)

41. At this juncture, the learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners in W.P.(C) No.295 of
2022 submitted that as per the RTI reply dated 17.10.2022 provided by the JNIMS Authority, only
40 Doctors were engaged as Medical Officers vide order dated 9.12.2020 for a period of six months
and those 40 Doctors were eligible for consideration of the Covid duty experience certificates. The
other Doctors who were appointed vide orders dated 10.6.2021, 22.6.2021,13.7.2021, 15.7.2021,
27.7.2021, 6.8.2021, 7.9.2021, 21.9.2021, 25.9.2021, 29.9.2021, 5.10.2021, WP(C) No. 256 of 2022,
WP(C) No. 257 of 2023, WP(C) No. 295 of 2022, WP(C) No. 363 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 412 of
2022 P a g e | 42 12.10.2021, 18.10.2021, 27.10.2021, 16.11.2021, 26.11.2021, 3.12.2021, 21.12.2021,
5.2.2022, 17.2.2022 and 11.2.2022 as Junior Resident were for a period of less than 100 days and, as
such, they were not eligible for consideration of the Covid duty experience certificates. According to
the learned senior counsel, the Committee for Verification has not examined the illegality pointed
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138996918/ 21
Page |2 vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 4 May, 2023
out by the MPSC vide letter dated 19.4.2022. Arguing so, the learned senior counsel prayed for
rejection of the report of the Committee dated 8.9.2022.
42. When all the 561 Covid duty certificates received from the Registrar (Judicial) of this Court have
been segregated District wise and Health Facility wise for easy examination of the Committee and
verified the same by the team with cross checking and compared with the relevant
engagement/appointment orders, now the petitioners cannot question the report of the Verification
Committee by saying that the Committee has not gone into the illegality pointed by the MPSC in its
letter dated 19.4.2022. This Court is of the considered view that only after considering all aspects,
the Verification Committee had issued the report dated 8.9.2022, which cannot be find faulted by
the petitioners.
43. At this juncture, the learned Advocate General submitted that when the Committee which is an
expert body WP(C) No. 256 of 2022, WP(C) No. 257 of 2023, WP(C) No. 295 of 2022, WP(C) No.
363 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 412 of 2022 P a g e | 43 examined the Covid duty experience certificates
issued to the Doctors and has given its opinion, the petitioners in W.P.(C) Nos.256 and 295 of 2022
have no say and they are unnecessarily, enlarging the scope of the writ petition, which cannot be
entertained by this Court exercising jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
44. We find some force in the said submission made by the learned Advocate General. When the
Committee after a thorough verification has given its finding to the effect that out of 561 Covid duty
experience certificates received by them, 457 were issued by the Director of Health Services,
however, 2 similar copies of the certificate in respect of Dr. Stanley Gangmei were found; 90
certificates issued by the Director of Health Services and 10 certificates were not issued by the
Director of Health Services, Manipur, this Court, exercising jurisdiction under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India cannot interfere with the experts opinion. The only course open to this Court is
to dispose of W.P.(C) Nos.256 and 295 of 2022, as the grievance of the petitioners in those writ
petitions has been redressed.
45. Insofar as the exclusion of the petitioners in W.P.(C) Nos.363 and 412 of 2022 for not awarding
of 10 additional marks in the written examination for recruitment of MHS Grade-IV WP(C) No. 256
of 2022, WP(C) No. 257 of 2023, WP(C) No. 295 of 2022, WP(C) No. 363 of 2022 and WP(C) No.
412 of 2022 P a g e | 44 (Medical Officer) for the sole reason that they served/worked in RIMS
Hospital which is not under the Government of Manipur is concerned, the learned Advocate
General, during the course of arguments, by producing the State Cabinet decision dated 10.4.2023,
submitted that the Doctors who have performed 100 days Covid related duties in RIMS, Imphal as
on 25.1.2022 have also been extended the benefit of 10 additional marks in the written test
conducted by the MPSC for recruitment of MHS Grade-IV (Medical Officers). The learned Advocate
General submitted that recording the decision of the State Cabinet, the writ petitions, being W.P.(C)
Nos.363 and 412 of 2022, may be closed.
46. For better appreciation, the copy of the Cabinet decision produced by the learned Advocate
General, is extracted hereunder:

conducted by the MPSC for recruitment of Medical Officers in MHS Grade-IV has been granted by
the State Cabinet and later on approved by the Hon'ble Chief Minister, this Court is of the view that

RIMS Hospital, Imphal, has been redressed.

Doctors served in RIMS, Imphal and the said position is also accepted by the leaned senior counsel
for the petitioners in W.P.(C) Nos.363 and 412 of 2022, the decisions relied upon by them in the
cases of Sevakumar and Mala Banerjee, supra, have not been elaborated.
50. W.P.(C) No.257 of 2023 has been filed by another set of Doctors who had participated in the
